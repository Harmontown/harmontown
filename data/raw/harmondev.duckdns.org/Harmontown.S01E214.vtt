WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
There is a ghost who lives in Harmontown

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
From just for last 42 in Toronto, Ontario

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
I'm very, very, very honoured to say that Harmontown is now officially in session

00:27.000 --> 00:36.000
Spencer Crittenden, everybody

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Oh, yeah

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Oh, yeah

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
I hope you saw his histogram today of him in his underwear in his hotel room

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
Because I have been pleasuring myself to that all afternoon

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
Let's hear from the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon

01:03.000 --> 01:13.000
There is a ghost who lives in Harmontown

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
Deserved, deserved, earned

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Earned every ounce of it, earned it

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Thank you

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
I believe you

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
I believe you

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Thank you

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
These are some Harmon star... Where'd he go?

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
These are some Harmon star motherfuckers, is what I was going to say

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Thank you, Toronto

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Where's Phillip, the guy that ran me down on the street walking here? Phillip, are you here?

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Hello

01:53.000 --> 02:04.000
I had dinner at a little small Italian joint in a kind of industrial underlit kind of wasteland area across the highway here

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
And a dude just came running up and slapped me on the shoulders

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
And as far as I was concerned, that was the last thing that was going to happen in my life

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
I don't think they understand

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
They're not aliens here, but they definitely don't

02:18.000 --> 02:26.000
A guy, Howard, that was interviewing me for advice today, quoted Tom Sharpling, which I'll now try to re-quote thereby

02:26.000 --> 02:35.000
I'll paraphrase and fuck up his quote, but something akin to Toronto is New York with the upper 10% and the bottom 5% cutoff

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
So it's like a middle-class Valhalla

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Which makes for terrible customer service

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
Because you guys don't have that terror, there's no King's Landing

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
There's no Lannister that will always pay his debts

02:54.000 --> 03:02.000
So why would two oat farmers take less than an hour giving each other oat?

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
There's a slight air of go fuck yourself

03:06.000 --> 03:13.000
To the extent that you drag in a very American sense of entitlement, which I didn't know I had until I came to Toronto

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
The service here is Canadian, all of Canada has Canadian service

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
We're used to like, bring me my, I said butter, like five minutes ago

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
But in Montreal it's kind of like, it's a little more laid back, you're like, oh maybe they're just sleepy

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
They're just pretending to be...

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
Toronto, they're getting shit done, they're just like, no, for real, go fuck yourself

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
I have it on my day planner, go fuck yourself between 11 and 3

03:39.000 --> 03:46.000
I do have stuff to do, I'm fully awake, I'm on wheat grass and I just flew a kite

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
I was at the hockey museum for breakfast, I'm doing things, I'm meeting people

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
The hockey museum breakfast is one of the best breakfasts in Ontario

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
It's just Toronto being obnoxious about how good their food is

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
They're like, come to the hockey museum, it's better than anything you've ever eaten

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
They put pee meal on everything

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
They probably have good coleslaw at strip clubs here

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
I've eaten, I'm going to puke delicious food all over everyone in a second

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
If I don't, it's only because...

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
Oh yeah, Dan was asking, Dan had a little tummy trouble, does anyone have chums here?

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Is that weird to ask the audience for chums?

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
I said, if the Harmontown audience doesn't have chums, then no audience has chums

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Yeah, there's someone on the front

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Second row?

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Oh, someone's running

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Right, okay

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Oh no

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Oh

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Wow, wait, are you from America?

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
This is Canadian tongue, also it's in French, so it's...

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Le tube?

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Okay, calcium and acid

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
Yeah, I'll just, this will get me going just fine

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
I'll do a stage dive and a wrap and we're done

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
We're talking about my...

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
You want to keep us on stage or hand them back to this guy?

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Stole this guy's shit

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Also, I'm not throwing them

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
That's a very large order of antacid to bring to a shop

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
That's the full bottle

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Would you care to come up and explain why you have so many?

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
And here's yours

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
I'm sure here, I take them

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
You're more honored to think that I have them with me

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Than to have them back and be like

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Hello?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
How are you doing?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Grab a mic from behind there

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Here, grab one of those, they're wireless

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Hey, how are you doing?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Oh, hi

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
What's your name?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Jeff

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Jeff, why so many chums?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Probably propensity for red wine

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Oh, so just...

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Just eat too much...

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Tanic acid and fried bullshit

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
I mean, you left your house with a safe

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
I mean, you don't know what's going to happen during your day

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
I know what's not going to happen

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
You're not going to have that much acid in your body

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
Between now and 2020

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
You're also not going to walk through a limousine like a Mentos commercial

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
And get laid afterwards

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
You were wearing jeans and a shirt

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
Was that in your pocket or did you carry that around?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
It was like a...

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
No, yeah, I feel like a kid with me whenever I need to

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Satchel?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
I do, yeah

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Okay, you came with a...

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
A Canadian satchel?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
That's right

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Yeah

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
All writers in LA could move up to Canada and we'd blend right in

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Absolutely, yeah

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
The satchel, guys

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Well, you're up here, what do you do?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Let's plug your album

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Your soundcloud

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
I don't currently have one

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
But no, I'm a promo producer for the Comedy Network

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
That's how you got those good seats and why you need all that antacid

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
You would think so, but...

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
The brutal Canadian TV industry

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
Where everyone's such an asshole at throwing their apologies across the room at each other

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Alright, well, I already forgot your name

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Jeff

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
How could you forget?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Right?

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
You have your own

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
That's why I take it for granted

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Would you agree with me on this? We have the most boring name in the world, don't we?

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Jeff is boring

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
For the most part, but mine's a G, Jeff

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
So I get people angry at me every time they try to write it

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Actually, who cares, never mind

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Yeah, but that's at least a little more interesting

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
That's more of the British Commonwealth

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Yeah

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
The British G there, eh?

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
Jimmy Pardo once kicked me off the stage for having a G in my name

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Jimmy Pardo?

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Yeah

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
He was in town doing a show

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
He spells his name with G, too

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
G...

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Jimmy Pardo?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
It looks like Jimmy Pardo

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
I think it's so amazing how loyal you guys are to kids in the hall

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
There's still that picture of Scott Thompson doing...

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
Every bar has a picture of Scott Thompson doing that old lady character on the wall

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
With the tiara and the dress

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Oh, that's your queen

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Queen buddy

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
This is what I was getting at, someone shouted out

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
But you guys are so friendly

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
You're like, three applause breaks into that dumb joke

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Because you're like, yes, we do support our local...

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
We are wonderful

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
We are in the Queen Elizabeth Theater as we stand

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
And I just called her a dude

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Is she with us?

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
She just turned 140 the other day

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
Did she have a successor?

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Are you guys still doing the royalty thing?

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
She has a son that she is going to see to it

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
She will die before he ever gets near the throne

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Or she won't die, actually, I guess

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
She'll have him destroyed

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Prince Charles will never...

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
Prince Charles is old as two kings got stacked together

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
And she's like, nope, crown his mind, you will never get it

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
It's so confusing, it's the same names as the British people

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
But you guys are...

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
How are you supposed to tell her?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Wait, yes, that's right, go on

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
They're Canadian Queen, it's like...

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
She looks just like the British Queen

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
And now I'm learning she has a prince, the same name as the...

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
The English one that we still have some level of allegiance to

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
We put her on the money

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
They're a sovereign nation here in Canada

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
But they still have some weird Commonwealth affection

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
With the United Kingdom

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Governor General and stuff

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
And the Lieutenant General that answers to her

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
But doesn't actually, but does, but doesn't

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
Gonna get corrected all sorts of times

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Well, five years ago we would have been all a judge

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
We're gonna have had all kinds of fun to poke at

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
How you run the things everywhere

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Just...

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
You know that Justin Trudeau

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
The creator of Bloom County

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Wait, no, I'm sorry

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
It's very...

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Even my joke is ill-informed

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Creators, deep balance

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
I had to wickipedia my dumb joke

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
No, Burke breathed

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Anyways, what about Trudeau?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Jeff, what you don't know is that Dan

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Before he travels to another country

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
He does intensive research

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
I looked at a map and I was like

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
Oh, I will entertain them by saying

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Toronto is Canada's tea bag

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Because it kind of dips into us

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
The Dick Halo move

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
When you look at the map, it's the...

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
It's your balls, like, dipping into our...

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Into our...

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Into our fresh water

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
It's a lot of land mass

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
It's their water

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Oh, my God

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Oh, my God

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Oh, Canada

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
I love how sci-fi this is

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
It's our water, they're yelling

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
It's our water

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Two men enter, one man leaves

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Let them give the people the air

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Let's hear it for Anastasia Jeff, everybody

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Anastasia Jeff

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Anastasia Jeff, here, take your...

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
See for the tunes

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
It's a lot of... It's a lot of times, Jeff

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
Boy, who's sitting next to that guy?

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
That was a... That was a classic...

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Well, this is white male

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Centric thinking

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
That was a classic Torontonian

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
I'm sure the face of the modern Toronto is...

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
You know, would be offended by me

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Implying that with my...

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
But I'm like, that's a Torontonian, like, clip art image

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Is Jeff, he was...

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
He had like a flannel shirt, basically

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
But it was like modern, like it was like...

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
I gotta say...

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
It's like a vestige, like it's like a Marvel...

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
Marvel did like a new Toronto series

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Like, it's like...

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
His character in the 40s was a lumberjack

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
That threw hologram axes

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
But now he's just like a dude

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
He takes selfies and...

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
But he still has...

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
He still had to incorporate the flannel into the...

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
But now he runs a comedy network

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
And it's not... It's not doing well in his tum tum

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Alright, we should check in with Spencer

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
No, no, no, thank you, thank you

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
No need for any of that

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
I was worried I wouldn't have anything to talk about

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
But they're so nice, they just go like

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
I like hot dogs and they're like, yay!

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
And it's like, this show's in the bag

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
But talk to us about Toronto

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Give us some impressions

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Oh man, okay

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
I don't know, I got here, I took a lift

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
No, I took an Uber over here

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
And there's this driveway outside

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
And I wanted the guy to pull into the driveway

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
But he stopped just on the street

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
And when he stopped just on the street

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Someone got into the car

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
A woman

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
And this is a weird thing that happens

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Sometimes you hail Ubers

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Or sometimes someone thinks they're the Uber

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
And they're not or whatever

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
This stuff happens

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
But she got in the car and I was like

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
I saw his phone, it didn't pick anyone else up

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
I don't think you hailed anyone, right?

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
And the taxi guy's like, no

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
No, I did not

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
And I was like, yeah

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
And the woman just, I don't know

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
She said something, but I couldn't really understand her

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
So it was great

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
And then I was like, did you hail an Uber?

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Did you call for an Uber?

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
And she was like, no

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
You said she said something like

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
It's fun to make friends

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
When she entered the car

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
She opened the door and getting into the car

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
She was like, it's great to make new friends

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Yeah, and I believe

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
What we're piecing together here is like

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
To put an agenda

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
Are you sure she wasn't like a sex worker?

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
I'm pretty sure

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
I haven't done my research, but I think it's like

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
You cut off the top 10% of New York

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
The bottom 95% of the guns

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
I think, because otherwise

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Why would people behave this way?

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
Like we come from a land of high anxiety

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
Like where every conversation could be your last

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
And they're just a little more

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
I'm gonna bound up to you

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
But isn't Toronto, I heard from a driver coming in

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
That Toronto violence is kind of on the upswing here

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
You can do it

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
Isn't it traditionally though

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
Has it been renowned as a pretty crime-free place?

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
This is the Niagara Falls place, right?

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
This is the place we share Niagara Falls with

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Half our water

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
No

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
I mean, if you go to Niagara Falls

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
The fun side is the Canadian side

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
Although, that burger came with the big Frankenstein on top

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
That's fucked up

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
You guys could class it up a little bit

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
The hotels look like 70s porn hotels

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
Like put a nice hotel in

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Jesus, the most beautiful vista in the world

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
And the hotel is skeevy as shit

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
You could also be a little less diligent with the shot thing

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Like the measurements of the shots

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
If someone orders a vodka on the rocks

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
You're allowed to just eyeball it

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
But maybe you've cleaned it all up

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I mean, maybe your way is the best way

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Is that a British Commonwealth thing?

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Because in the UK, same thing

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
You get that dram

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Well, we had this argument in text

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
It's technically an everywhere thing

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
But only in airports and in Toronto

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
Are they so exacting

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
And just like uncompromising

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Like they never let up

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
Just like, I've tipped you a thousand dollars

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
Like, I'm buying you a chalet

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Like, will you let capitalism

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Into your cold black communist heart

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
And fucking overpour?

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
I want to enslave you

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
You're working for me, not your owner

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
I'm taking you from him, poor old bunch

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
You'll make more money

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
They don't get it

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
They don't know how happy they'll be

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
If they just go down our path

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
But also, somehow there's still

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
A load of alcoholics in Canada

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
How do you guys do it here?

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Do you have to be wealthy or just drink beer?

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Practice!

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
I think it's because it's just so

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
It's so geometric for them

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
It's more efficient

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
They're just like, I've calculated exactly

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
How drunk I'm going to get

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
I don't know, because I have to do this thing

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
I don't want to draw attention to myself

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
I pointed at a...

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
After a while of going, can I have a double?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Or at a triple?

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Like, this is silly

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I should be able to tell the difference

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
Between what I ordered and the melted ice

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Oh, shit

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Meanwhile, again, a gentleman...

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Canadian vodka

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Canadian vodka is being delivered to the stage

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Hooray!

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Thank you

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
I hope he brought it up for 1,250 people

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Oh, wait, look at this

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
What is going on here?

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
He hates Dijon mustard, this guy

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
What is happening?

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Oh, there's a tie

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
This I love

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
This is going on right away

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Oh, shit

17:45.000 --> 18:01.000
Oh, shit

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Is this 43?

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
I don't know what that means

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
This tie is for a baby

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
That is the precise unit of tie

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
That you are allowed when you order a tie

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
I guess...

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
With the exchange rate

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
This is how long a Canadian tie is

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
This is never going to fucking work

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
This is going to be a...

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Thank you so much

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
I'll be here soon

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
I'll be here one election from now

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
My little baby tie

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Why don't we bring out our good friends

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
that were already here

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
I know them from friendship

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
and stuff and their podcast, The Indoor Kids

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
But you and the rest of the world

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
just know them from all over

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
They're now wrapping up their hit show

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
The Meltdown

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
They...

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
I don't have to introduce them

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Okay

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Hello

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
If someone else joins us, I'll give them my stool

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Hello

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
I brought a chair because I'm wearing a short skirt

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
and these tall stools are not...

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
No, no, no, no

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
But thank you

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
So I brought a chair

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Hey Emily, I was here earlier

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
I loved your hour set before we came on

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
I did a great job, didn't I?

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
I did some of my new stuff

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
A lot of ethnic material

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Camille, you were just out here doing an hour long show?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Yeah

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Was anyone at that show?

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Oh wow

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Is the Adderall flowing freely here?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Is that how you guys have this energy?

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Toss them this way

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
It's all the poutine

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
It's like socialized medicine

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
and everyone has ADD

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
It's really crazy

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
I was doing my show

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
and I'm a grown up

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
and I am a grown up

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
and I found out one of my cousins was in the audience

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
and it really freaked me out

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
I'm picturing like your hot female cousin

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
which is played by you and a wig

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Yeah, same beard

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
I'm always picturing that by the way

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
I'm always picturing you and a wig

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Like when the gremlin wears a wig

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
A lady gremlin

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Like that, but for me

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Chumalia

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Actually, Camille

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
sounds kind of like a female name

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
even where I'm from

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Come on, get out

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Camille is a female name

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
and Camille

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
K-U-M-A-L

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
K-A-M-A

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Nonsense

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
That's so racist

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Since we're being racist, can I ask you

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I won't have this chance

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
because I swear I don't

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
I can't even go and make an ass of myself

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
but I swear

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
This is a safe space

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
It's a safe space for racism

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
I know this is going to sound

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
like a bit

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
I know that I'm stupid and I know

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
I'm just committing to my midwestern

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I don't understand

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Buddy, just ask

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
My Uber driver

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Fuck you

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
I

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
It's perfect

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
It's the modern who's on first

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
I think that, yeah

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
The answer is no

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
The answer is no

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Hassan first

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
His name is Muhammad

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
It's a common name, Muhammad

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
There's a bunch of people named Muhammad

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Are you telling me or asking me

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Well, you could correct me if I'm wrong

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
It's not a unique name

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
It's not like a crazy name

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
It's like John or something

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
It's very common

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Correct

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
When we talk about the whole

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Oh, you made a cartoon

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
We had a thing called Graven Image

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
and all this stuff

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
Why can his name be Muhammad

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
If it's like that

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
That actually is a good question

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
If his name is Muhammad

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
If he's born with the exact face

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
of Prophet Muhammad

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Then that's a horrible crime

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Or the face

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
that Trey Parker and Matt Stone

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
would have drawn

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
That's also bad

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Yeah, if it's fully 2D

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
But I guess that's the

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Asperger part of my question

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
How do we know that's the whole point

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
I would think the whole point against

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
The

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
depiction thing would be

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
That's not supposed to be known

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
That's not supposed to be defiled

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
With

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Depictions and things and mimicry

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
And so why

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
But then a human being

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
But I guess that's the same you see

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Everybody named Jesus

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
It's like, whoa, your mom's like super Catholic

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
But my mom would slap me

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
If I dropped a dish and said Jesus

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
But you name your kid Jesus

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
But the difference is

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
You can draw Jesus and be fine

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
That's true

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Do you want to draw Muhammad right now

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
See

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
I don't think so

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
That's an interesting point

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
And I've never thought about it

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Why are people allowed to be called Muhammad

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
But then you're not allowed to draw his face

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
And also when you're drawing his face

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
How do you know exactly

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
What that guy looks like

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Because every Muslim is

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Born a priori

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
With the knowledge of Muhammad's face

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
In their head

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
And we can all compare it

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
But you can't explain it to white people

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
We can't explain it

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
But if someone draws a picture of Muhammad

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
We look and we're like that's not close enough

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
You're fine

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
So you're punished for being

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
A really good caricaturist

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
You can do a caricature

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Just don't be photorealistic

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
I couldn't do Muhammad like right

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
In a skateboard and like

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
That's what I want to surfboard in one arm

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
But you can only do it if his head

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Is at least the size of his body

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
If the proportions are

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Biologically accurate

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
You're fucked

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Walter Lance explains this

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Do you think that kids born

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Named Muhammad

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Feel like an extra sense of duty

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
To be like more good

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
I mean it's a hell

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Of a thing to have to live up to

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
What if your name is Muhammad

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
You're a young Muslim

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
You're a kid and you go to Disneyland

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
And you get a caricature and like

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
My name is Muhammad

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
These are the questions

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
That are going to get us killed before

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Before we're done

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
What price?

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
$15

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
$15

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Wow

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Or is that a xenophobic thing to say

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
These are questions that are going to get us killed

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
That's contributing to a syndrome

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
I think we've done more things that would get us killed

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Disagree

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Hard disagree

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Like nice Lutheran girls named Mary

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Don't feel compelled to either be a virgin

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Or fuck God

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
They don't feel any extra pressure

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
I don't think

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
That's true

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
And I've never talked to anybody named Jesus

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
About whether or not they feel an extra mantle

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Of growing out their hair

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Or wearing a lot of robes

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Alright

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Well that concludes my Islamic questions

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
You don't have any more?

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
That was it?

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Oh I'm sorry

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
I have an unquenchable empty

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Chalice

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
I'm in an open book right now

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
I won't tell you more secrets

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
What's your feeling?

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
I do have one

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Do you have the equivalent of a bar mitzvah?

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Oh

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
I'm saying you, he was raised Muslim

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
He's not your personal private business

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Whether you're secular or whatever

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
But you were raised in a

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
We don't have a ceremony like that

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Where you go from being a kid to an adult

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
That's like, we don't have that

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Christians have confirmation

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Then you have the bar mitzvah

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
That's 13, the bat mitzvah

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Which I'm told is pronounced bat mitzvah

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Yeah it's bat mitzvah

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
It's Bruce Wein

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Later

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
What am I leaving out?

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Bruce Weinstein

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
I think Wiccans have a thing

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
When you turn 13

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
It's called the twisted root

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Of Hades

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Well I also feel like, that's a fun one

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
I've been to one of those

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
I feel like women have, naturally have

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Menarch

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
That's like a very obvious

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Before and after

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
That I don't think we celebrate enough, we should

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
I was pandering a little bit

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
But it's okay

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
But boys, we don't have

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
An equivalent of that

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Because most Christians don't

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
A lot of Christians I know don't have confirmation

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
I think boys need a boys to mend

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
I think they need like a ceremony

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
It's so hard to say goodbye

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Well yeah

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
We spread it all out

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
And I think that's about state control

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
I think that the

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Axis of power between fathers and sons

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Is such

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Non-governmental power

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
You guys are free to leave right now if you want

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Am I?

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
I think they want us spreading it between

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
I get drunk on prom night

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
I wrestle with you on the kitchen floor

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
But not really

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
It doesn't end with someone being circumcised

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Not if you do it right

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Isn't it capitalism?

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Capitalism wants everyone to be babies

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
But that's different than state control

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
We come from a capitalist state

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
It's a big

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Ball of money that says

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
In God we trust on it

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
It's like it wants you sucking on

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
That titty for your entire life

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
And then it wants to just tell you

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
That being old cost money

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
And then it just watches you die

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
And meanwhile it tells your kids

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Oh you're millennials you hate old people

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
They're like we do

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
And they told the old people

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
You know what really matters? Race

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
And then they tell the kids

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
You know what matters? Racism

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
And then they tell the next generation

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
You know what matters? Kind of race

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
And then everyone's like

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
How come every 30 years

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
We just told that we all hate each other

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
It's all money

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Because they don't want

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
In that same vein don't you think that

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Capitalists wouldn't we then have more

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Oh it's your

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
They want to market curries and cards

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
And yeah exactly

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
That's just the innocent face

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
That's what you're able to trace

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
You'd think we'd have 11 Zs

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
And you're turning 12 Ramas

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
You know

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
They sound like the creepiest uncle

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
In the world right now

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Come in my van for a 12 Ramas

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Cause I think like first wet dream

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
For a young man should be like

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
A celebrate

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
I haven't gotten a wet dream

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
I've never had a wet dream

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
If you did a preemptive strike

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
If you know what I mean

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Then you don't get a wet dream

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Oh that's a bummer

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Let's say I go for weeks

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
And I don't do any preemptive strikes

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
I've never woken up

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
There's no way you've gotten weeks

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
I mean look at you

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Look at you, you clearly jerk off a lot

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
I've dreamt about

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Sex

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Coming and I've never come

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
I did

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Everything okay?

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Did someone just fucking jerk off all over you dude

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
In my sleep

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
I felt like I heard the guy

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
I processed that in my brain

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
It's just ogre from revenge of the nerds

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
I thought it just yelled ogre

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
I pictured the mountains from Game of Thrones

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Oh okay

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Here's a little piece of cultural

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
What dreams were there

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Well I had one in my adulthood

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
I can't remember what I was dreaming of

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
But I remember I did actually

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Finally after years of reading about it

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
In these textbooks and having your

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Your gym teacher tell you about it

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
That I had

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
I was like holy shit I came in my sleep

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Wait when was this how long ago

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
I was like in my 30s

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
You didn't do it as a kid though

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
No never

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
There wasn't anything available

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
For a whole time job

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
I just never turned back

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
One day Pam Gauber

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Looked different and working

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Mindy reruns and

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
The next day every pillow

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
In my mom's apartment was a target

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
There wasn't a surface

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
There wasn't a fabric

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Swatch

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
That wasn't fucking just

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Just humped

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
At first dry

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Because nothing even before anything was coming out

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
I've talked about this before

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Wait Camille

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Camille have you had wet dreams

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
No

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
I always did preemptive strikes

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
And

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
I actually

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
While my cousin was here in the show

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Right before it

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
I told a 10 minute long story about

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
When I first started masturbating

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
And I'll tell you the part that I didn't say

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Because he was here

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Directors cut

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Is not there here

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
He wouldn't say it if he was

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
He's gone

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
The part I didn't

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
I talked about the first time I masturbated

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
And how I blacked out and came to

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Are you stinking

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
I blacked out

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
I had masturbated and you came to

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
You came also

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Really good

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
I closed my eyes a boy

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
And I opened up a man

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
And I blacked out

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
You must have come 7 or 8

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Okay

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
I literally

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
The part I did mention is that

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
I had a very conservative Muslim

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Upbringing so I was like when I first came

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
My body

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
When I first masturbated my body was like

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Had been waiting so long

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
That when I came to I swear this is completely true

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
I found out

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
That I had

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
This is true I had hit the ceiling

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
No

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
No

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Don't

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Don't leave her hanging

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
I swear

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
You're a man now

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Now

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
I swear I woke up

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
And I saw my Muslim repression

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Dripping from the ceiling

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Wait how

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
I swear

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
That's maybe 5 feet

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Right

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Are you being racist about the height of

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Pakistani ceilings

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Everyone knows you people sleep on the floor

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
If the average ceiling is 8 feet

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
I'm pushing the average size ceiling

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
And you're sitting on a toilet

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Cause he's in the bathroom this part I know

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
So you're sitting on a toilet that's

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
So I'm even lower dude

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
I'm hitting the ceiling from this height

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Sitting down

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
I swear

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
I remember I had to stand on top

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Of the toilet to like

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Wipe it

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
How old were you?

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
I was probably like 11

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
And I thought that this is how it always is

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
I didn't do it

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
I would like close my eyes and look away

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
But I've never been able to

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Replicate the results

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
It dribbles out like a broken

34:17.000 --> 34:23.000
Why are you faithful?

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
I find that incredibly remarkable

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
It's really something

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Listen so did I

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Why do you think it is that men

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
I guess the answer

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Is in the question I don't know

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Why would we want to

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
There's ads for pills you can take

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
That make you

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Make there be more

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Make it gush

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
It's enough

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
It's over the size thing

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
That doesn't make any sense

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Logically

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Funny that we also

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Plus everybody wants to

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
It's just kind of funny

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
And I will say speaking for women

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
For those men who are fucking women

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
We don't want that

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
You're not looking for geysers

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
No

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Women are so good at

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
I don't want to say women

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Are good at anything

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Wow

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
That came out wrong

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
No, that is so

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Feminist

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Mr. Trump, my next question

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
That is truly so feminist of you

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
I'm such a feminist

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
I don't want to say women are good at anything

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Dan, thank you

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
There's a fine line

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Finally somebody has the courage

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
I'm a master of all worlds

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
I didn't want to make a sweeping statement about women

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Women are so good

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
And men are so fragile

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Women are so good at

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Intuiting

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
I think that

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Men think

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
All men have experienced

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Maybe a woman saying

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
That's a lot

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
And spinning it

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
And we've been like

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
That's good, huh?

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
I feel like it must

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
I feel like when there's not a lot

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Of what did you call it, Camel

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Dribbles out like a broken water

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
No, no, no, you've been

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Preemptive strike, a lot of preemptive strikes

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Preemptive strikes

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
I've always felt that there was a

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
You can actually get pregnant with a preemptive strike

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Because there is some

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Emptive strike

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Arguably more

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
I read a thing that says

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Because what you're doing

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Is you're getting rid of

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
Overstock.com

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
So if you

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Have one of those special days

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
When you're like

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
You don't have any phone calls till two

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
And

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
You're just

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Going to town

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
You're arguably more fertile

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
I thought I read something

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
It feels weird to be talking about this

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
And have Emily be like two feet lower than us

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
It's tough to be a lady, guys

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Wait, I'll say this

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
When I was a

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Younger woman, I thought that a lot

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Meant that I was

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Like they were really like into me

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
And then now I realize

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
That they just

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
They just haven't masturbated that recently

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Now I get that

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Do you think it also has a million

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Like variables, but do you think

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
That you got that impression from men

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Like do you think that a guy

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
No, I just feel like nobody ever

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Like no guy was ever like

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
That's for you, young lady

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
But I did think like

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
There's a little extra in there for you

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Get yourself something next

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Like

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Like a replica

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Of yourself that's half me

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Get yourself a nice baby

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Don't spread it all in one place

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
A guy never

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Never made me feel that way, but I was like

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
For me, all this

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Like I did have that

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Right

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
All this, that

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Actually makes sense

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
You feeling a weird amount of pride

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
About the amount of

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
And now I just realize it's meant that you've had

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Phone calls all day

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Right

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Yeah, 90am conference call

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Yeah

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
The

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Okay, so

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
If you're with a guy

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
And he is a geyser

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
That's just a dude that has no phone calls

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
It could be a guy

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Lots of phone calls

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
A very busy man

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
It could be a guy that's very excited about

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
You

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
No, because if you just jerked off three times

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Before she came over, it doesn't matter

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
You're still not going to

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Make a bunch of variables

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
I don't want anyone listening to this

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
I don't want anyone

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Listening to this

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Hahaha

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Probably the most water you've had too

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Sorry

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
We'll find out in the year 2030 that it's like

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
It's Skittles

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
You know

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
I was at a bar

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Suspend your disbelief

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
I was at a bar

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
And I ordered tequila

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
With pineapple juice

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
And the bartender or the gal goes

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Uh-huh

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Alright, yeah, that thing, yeah

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
It's sort of pineapple juice

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Trying to make your sperm taste good

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Exactly

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
I was in a

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
Also at a bar

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
And as I was walking out

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
A person

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Kept yelling something

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
It started with an H

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
And it was

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
It was not quite my name

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
And it was like

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
It was so insistent and it kept getting yelled

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
That finally decided like

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Back over my shoulder

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
As I was turning

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
My eyes landed on the guy

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
My brain caught up

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
And realized he was yelling hodor

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Uh

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
And then he was very much directing it at me

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Oh

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
And I looked at him

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
And

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Was he being chased by a lot of white walkers?

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
He

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
He, I mean

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
I've never, I haven't experienced

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Really taking it back

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
I'm not a thin-skinned person

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
It's about intent

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
It's when you realize someone's really

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
Like, wait, what's going on?

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
It's not like, oh no, I look like hodor

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
That guy's handsome

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
But it was like, holy shit

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Like this guy, because I was waiting

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
I turned and looked

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
And he just had this

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Delighted grin on his face

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
But he was a 30 year old man

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
And he just

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Like, once I was looking at him

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
He just smiled and went, hodor

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Maybe

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
He was hodor

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
I

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Yeah, and he was saying

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
He was like, have a good night

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Paul Rudd, Paul Rudd

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Paul Rudd, Paul Rudd

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Is that you?

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
It's like the gift of the mad guy

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Yeah, but he, I mean he just

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
And I was like, so I just kept staring at him

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
And he was like, hodor

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
And his friends were all looking at him

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Like, like, like

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Have you had luck contacting hodor

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Like, like, I just

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
The whole thing was so sociopathic

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
I kind of like, because I waited

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
And I was like, well maybe now

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
He'll say, just kidding

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
I love Harmontown, I'll see you at the show

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
I guess that's silly of me

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
To expect, but I didn't

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Expect it as much as I really needed it

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
In that moment

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
And so I just waited

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
And I just slowly

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Raised a thumb

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
I was like

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
And then turned around

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
And I was like, if I did this

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
In Los Angeles, this person

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Would feel bad

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
That's the dark side of Toronto

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
Do you think he actually

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Thought you were hodor?

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
It could be

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
You asshole, it could be

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
No, I mean people recognize you

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
As the wrong, I mean people recognize people

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
As the wrong celebrities, that definitely happens

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
I legitimately look enough like hodor

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
That the guy could have thought I was hodor

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
But when you look back on it, like

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
There's enough of a chance that I'm not hodor

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
That that guy should not be doing that

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
But you're like

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
A white guy, so it's okay

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Like, I remember once

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
I was at an airport and NBA player

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Chauncey Billips was there

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
And I was like, I can't go up to Chauncey

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Billips and be like, you play in the NBA, right?

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Like, I can't go up

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
To a black guy

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
That's the worst thing I could have done

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
How do you think I felt?

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
You play in the NBA

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Imagine

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
My anxiety the second time

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
I got Mohammed today

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Like when I called the Uber

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
I was like, wait, how can it be him?

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
I ordered an SUV, I'm racist

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
And it was a different Mohammed?

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
No, it was the same dude, he fucking fucked up

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Like these people do not have not these people

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
That's been our show

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Conventional coming everybody

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Ontarians

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Go ahead, what did these people

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Not understand

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Tell us what they're like

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
They do not have Uber down

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
In Toronto

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
You know what? You should report it to the police

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
I'll be a sketch artist

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
What did he look like?

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Here, draw him for me

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
It's not Mohammed that done me wrong

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Mohammed's okay

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
For the love of God, don't draw him

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
I know that was a joke

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
I thought I'd get away with stealing it

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
I don't know

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
They're Uber

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
They're not taking to Uber

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Like a fish to water in Toronto

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
They're not having

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
They're figuring it out

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
We haven't taken an Uber yet

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
You'll watch the car

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Twirl

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
The car will go

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Plant and then you'll get a phone call

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
And you'll be like, are you okay?

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
He's just in a massive accident

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
And they'll just tell you where they are

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
And you'll walk to them for 10 minutes

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
In your head, they're like tumbling

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
They had a horrible accident

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
And you're seeing it

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Are you alright, Mohammed? Are you okay?

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
When I was in Paris

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
In Paris, the Uber is there

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
I don't like Uber, I use Lyft

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Because Lyft is a west coast thing

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
You guys don't have it here, do you?

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Uber, blow, ho-ho's

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
It's the worst

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
In Paris, it's all a bunch of awesome Moroccan dudes

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
And they drive

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Groovy cars

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
And they're super hip and fun

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
It's the best

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
So you've had a good experience with your Uber

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Only in Paris

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
In Toronto, the Uber's here

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
I watched it, you look at the app

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
And you just see a little icon of a car

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Just doing little pirouettes

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
And they have a lot of one-way streets here

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
So it's like, it's not all

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
That wasn't on one-way streets though

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
But he kept making it look like it was

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
And also then you add the, it's crazy

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Because you just see, it looks like a little kid

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
It has a magnet behind a whiteboard

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
It's just like dragging the car around Toronto

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
I don't know what

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Something's gotta give

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
What is on your Apple iWatch?

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Toronto Facts

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Toronto Facts

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Did you know that

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Good job Dustin

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Did you know that Toronto is named after the famed

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
Sidekick to the La Rhone

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Rarranger

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Jesus Christ

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
That was pretty good, that was pretty good

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
That is a great joke

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Shut up, fuck you

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
No, I am not being facetious

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
I am jealous

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
I promise you, I will think of that

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Joke once a week

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Until the day I die

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
I am not joking

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
There is no more

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Did you know someone got

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Murdered here?

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
I don't know

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
What kind of hot buttons I am doing

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
I am just listening to the Chiron

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
They have an

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Inuit population here

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
What is the last name of the artist

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
That just is, they are investigating

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
The murder or something

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
You guys should know your news

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Wait, what

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
From what you said

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
There is an Inuit population

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
And somebody got murdered and an artist

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Is in charge of the investigation

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Sorry, I fell apart

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Because I started to get scared

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
I don't know the local hot button stuff

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
I don't know who I am going to offend

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
By the way, coming this fall to Netflix

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
I am going to watch the fuck out of that show

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
I was drinking in the bar

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
To the TV

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
To get their news crawl

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
It said there was an art

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
The police are still looking for the killer

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Of someone named

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Poo de goop

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Like there is a crazy name

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
For a murder victim

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
And now I feel bad

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
That was a person

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Yeah, it is a human being whose life is

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
And there is probably

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Also cultural ramifications

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Of what I am doing

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
I am probably trampling all over horrible ghosts

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
I really don't know

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
What you are talking about

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
They have a funny name

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Their name is funny

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Everything is funny

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
My name is Goobadoobadoo

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Your name is not Gary Johnson

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
I think that is funny

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
You look weird

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Your instruments are weird

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
I am sorry

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
So I am literally just trying

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
I accept your apology

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
I am just trying to pass through

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
The facts

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
I just have any

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
So there was an Inuit artist

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Who was murdered

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Does anyone have the facts in this case

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Another artist is in charge of songs

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
No, there is no artist in charge of anything

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Was he Inuit or First Nations

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Police are looking for the killer

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Of this artist

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Does anybody know what we are talking about

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
A human being up here

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
She knows

48:11.000 --> 48:16.000
I am sorry

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Poopa Goop

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
This is the Poopa Goop

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Did you just look this up

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
You can sit here

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Take a stool or what's your name

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Anya

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Did you know about this from before

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
Or you just looked this up

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
I did know about it before

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
I brought the beer up too

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
I am very excited about that

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
Yeah, I just looked up the names

48:38.000 --> 48:45.500
name. It's okay, yeah. So tell us everything about this. An award-winning Inuit artist

48:45.500 --> 48:49.880
has been identified as the woman who was found dead earlier this week in the Rudeau River

48:49.880 --> 48:56.380
in Ottawa. And her name is? I'm gonna fuck this up, too. Annie Pudugook. Okay. Pudugook.

48:56.380 --> 49:07.380
You're close. So hilarious to me. Ha ha ha. Her family's in the audience. Even if they're

49:07.380 --> 49:11.640
not, like, there's probably some raging, boiling, like fucking... Dude, I saw the guest

49:11.640 --> 49:17.000
listen and said, Pudugook plus three. Plus two now. Oh.

49:17.000 --> 49:42.580
That was a... I don't know if that was the Sandman or a hockey player. That was a Toronto

49:42.580 --> 49:47.780
version of the Sandman. That was the best thing I've ever seen. All right, well, Anya,

49:47.780 --> 49:55.460
let's get to know you a little bit. Hi, my name's Anya. Anya, aside from being the fastest

49:55.460 --> 50:04.180
Googler in the front two rows, what is your specialty? Oh, I'm a vegan. That's like...

50:04.180 --> 50:12.940
I run a... I love the self-loathing that that was said about. You guys can't... You're

50:12.940 --> 50:16.340
in the wrong town, but that's it. I'm vegetarian. I'm vegetarian. You guys will just put a piece

50:16.340 --> 50:24.020
of bacon on any old thing. I run a, like, with my two best friends, an Instagram account

50:24.020 --> 50:31.140
called VeganGirlfriend. And that's what I do. And I'm a comedian, too, but... What's the

50:31.140 --> 50:37.540
thing? Oh, yeah. Sorry. Sorry. Hang on. Hang on. Hold up. People are more mad about that

50:37.540 --> 50:43.260
than the whole Muhammad drawing thing. Yeah. Yeah, the politeness for their... They don't

50:43.260 --> 50:51.140
have it for their own, or is it... They just love bacon products here. Well, she's leaving

50:51.140 --> 50:57.020
more for you, and she's being very self-effacing and a new... You know, she's putting herself

50:57.020 --> 51:03.820
at risk. What's the goal for the Instagram account? What's the idea behind it? I'm gonna

51:03.820 --> 51:07.300
get in so much trouble. My friends are gonna be so mad at me. I started... Yeah, you don't

51:07.300 --> 51:15.740
want the word to get out. No, no, no. I... Make sure you... You promoted our shit. Make

51:15.740 --> 51:27.420
sure you put them on stage. Wait, VeganGirlfriend? Yeah, that's me. Yeah. Oh, you have 23,000

51:27.420 --> 51:35.420
followers. Hey, you have 23,000 and one follower. Thank you. He is going to follow you later,

51:35.420 --> 51:44.820
I promise. There's no real goal to it. I started it as, like, a fun thing to do, and now Ari

51:44.820 --> 51:51.660
on a Grand Day follows us, and that's all she wrote. Does she lick your doughnuts? That's

51:51.660 --> 51:57.300
a reference to it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Does Ari on a Grand Day lick, lick, lick the crawlers

51:57.300 --> 52:00.580
or something? She was at a store, and she... While the people weren't looking, she licked

52:00.580 --> 52:03.660
the doughnuts, and then said, this is why America sucks so much, is because we have

52:03.660 --> 52:08.020
so many doughnuts. Right, and she said a doughnut... All right, well, whatever. She's a child.

52:08.020 --> 52:13.820
Why am I shaming her for living a life in captivity? She's on camera, it looks like...

52:13.820 --> 52:18.380
It should be more of an outrage that she's on security cam licking doughnuts. She should

52:18.380 --> 52:21.460
be able to get away with licking a doughnut. But she's also a grown up. I think you forget

52:21.460 --> 52:26.100
that because she's very tiny, but she's like... What do you look like? Most pop stars are

52:26.100 --> 52:29.940
like Adele's age, which is crazy, because Adele seems like a grown ass lady, and a lot

52:29.940 --> 52:34.540
of these girls don't, but they're all grown ass ladies. But 50's the new 30. She's 24,

52:34.540 --> 52:40.660
I think. 24's the new 11. I think Adele's like 25. It's crazy. Oh, Adele's 25? Oh, fuck

52:40.660 --> 52:47.380
Ariana Grande. I see what you're saying. She must be an old soul. That's the age when

52:47.380 --> 52:52.620
dementia kicks in and you start licking doughnuts. It tastes good? I will say, if I'm going

52:52.620 --> 52:59.940
to a doughnut shop and there's one that was licked by Ariana Grande, I would pay double

52:59.940 --> 53:09.100
for it. Would you eat it, or would you just... Yes. Slowly and sensuously. You think her

53:09.100 --> 53:16.660
saliva tastes better than other Disney kids, or Disney grown ladies? That's a very difficult

53:16.660 --> 53:24.620
question to answer without the necessary research. Yeah, I'd have to do research. Ariana, I don't

53:24.620 --> 53:31.700
have to get shot in the book in there. So you, your friend Megan, and your friend Alexandra,

53:31.700 --> 53:37.100
you guys have this vegan girlfriend thing, and then it's... It says it's based in Toronto

53:37.100 --> 53:44.060
and L.A. Yeah, my Megan just moved to L.A. Megan. So now we're worldwide. No, she just

53:44.060 --> 53:50.820
moved to L.A. So we're worldwide. Was that Dave Kline out there? Look, this picture has

53:50.820 --> 53:59.300
500 likes. Can you believe this is a cake? No, we can't start doing this. It looks delicious.

53:59.300 --> 54:09.060
How can you believe it? Yeah. Okay. It just looks a lot like it. Have you been to Hogtown

54:09.060 --> 54:15.020
Vegan on Blur? I have. It's fucking good. It's delicious. It's so good. It's amazing.

54:15.020 --> 54:20.980
Maybe you're not a vegetarian. Go to Hogtown Vegan. It's fucking delicious. This looks

54:20.980 --> 54:29.540
great. Cut my cake. It's out of L.A. It's called Cut My Cakes. She makes like granite. That's

54:29.540 --> 54:33.340
what I'm saying. It's like, cake fucks your wife. It's an alt-right foodie Instagram.

54:33.340 --> 54:39.620
That's a fun time. Cut my cake. Cut my cake. Cuck cakes would be great. They would not

54:39.620 --> 54:46.300
need to be vegan though. How many times a week do you get called a cuck on Twitter? Me?

54:46.300 --> 54:52.820
Not that often. You know what? I decided to stop reading my replies and I don't read

54:52.820 --> 54:59.660
them as much. What if they tell you you're awesome? Well, I can hear 50 awesomes and

54:59.660 --> 55:04.500
then one person calls me a cuck and it ruins me. Are you guys both being called cucks because

55:04.500 --> 55:10.020
you have, like, people know you have a wife or a girlfriend? Why are you a cuck? No. They're

55:10.020 --> 55:21.140
liberals. Also because I cucked the shit out of this guy. I don't even know what that

55:21.140 --> 55:27.700
means. I think a lot of dance dances. I don't know what it's a do part of the show. Emily

55:27.700 --> 55:36.140
does a Bazinga and then I do a yeehaw dance. I love it. You guys know what yeehaw is? Of

55:36.140 --> 55:45.020
course you don't. I grew up on yeehaw. Here's what I'm curious. Young Torontonians, what

55:45.020 --> 55:56.340
is your relationship with Take Off You Hoser? Is Dan and I walking down, what street were

55:56.340 --> 56:04.380
we on? Bay? Or some shit? Young? Is it young or you don't know what a street name is? It's

56:04.380 --> 56:08.420
young guy. We're walking down the road and we're like, do people still call each other

56:08.420 --> 56:14.100
hosers? And in the event that somebody is a hoser, do you admonish them to take off?

56:14.100 --> 56:24.860
Yeah. Yeah. People still say hoser here? The answer is no. Yeah. Yeah, we were wondering

56:24.860 --> 56:33.540
or do they even know about that? I've watched Strange Brew 11,000 times. Really? You guys

56:33.540 --> 56:39.340
are actually in New Strange Brew. That's great. Well, I guess that makes sense. It's kind

56:39.340 --> 56:43.860
of a local, I mean, that's like their area, right? That's all we've got. That story's

56:43.860 --> 56:50.500
taking place right around here. You guys, like, Toronton is the home of, like, SCTV, like

56:50.500 --> 56:56.220
all that fucking stuff. Oh, I have a lot of, like, really funny comedy friends, like the

56:56.220 --> 57:02.700
show Monsecone Valley, the guy, Toss Middletich, who plays Richard, is from here. I just texted

57:02.700 --> 57:08.420
him to be like, hey, do you have any Torontotips? He has no Torontotips. The guy that I travel

57:08.420 --> 57:13.100
with when I do Who's Live Anyway with Ryan Stiles and Greg Proops and the gang, it's

57:13.100 --> 57:21.860
Bob Durkash, who was the musician for Toronto Second City for 25 years. Toronto is a comedy

57:21.860 --> 57:25.460
town way back all over the place. For sure. Yeah.

57:25.460 --> 57:31.700
Well, you're saying with all these improv roots here, we should probably get some information

57:31.700 --> 57:41.460
from Rania and then do a hilarious, improvised sketch of some kind. And in the event that

57:41.460 --> 57:44.580
Emily Gordon never has a bezinga, you have to do your dance.

57:44.580 --> 57:49.260
Right. I'm gonna have a bezinga, though.

57:49.260 --> 57:54.980
So, Anya, why don't we just do your biopic? Like, where were you born?

57:54.980 --> 57:58.700
I was born in Canada. I was raised in Ireland.

57:58.700 --> 58:04.860
Raised in Ireland, but born in Canada. Why? I mean, what happened?

58:04.860 --> 58:10.180
Well, where else do you get a name like Anya? I mean, like, aside from Poland and Russia.

58:10.180 --> 58:14.020
Yeah, most of Europe, you can get the name Anya.

58:14.020 --> 58:18.420
All right, so raised in Ireland. Yeah, my parents are from there.

58:18.420 --> 58:23.980
Both parents are Irish. So they just had you in Canada and then absconded.

58:23.980 --> 58:28.660
They had like a house in Ireland and they brought me there and then they came back.

58:28.660 --> 58:31.820
Do you speak Irish? It's not that I don't speak Irish, I'm sorry.

58:31.820 --> 58:38.300
That's not a language. It is. They force it, they have these things

58:38.300 --> 58:44.060
called gale talks, which is like you go there, it's like a confined space where you go just

58:44.060 --> 58:45.740
to speak gale like and you can't speak English.

58:45.740 --> 58:47.860
This is your parents? No, well, this is your parents.

58:47.860 --> 58:54.780
I have an Instagram called Vegan Gale Talk. Gale Friends.

58:54.780 --> 58:59.060
Vegan Gale Friends. Can you believe this is a clock?

58:59.060 --> 59:03.380
Dad, you fixed it. Vegan Gale Friends. Yeah, I blessed it.

59:03.380 --> 59:07.460
He's always blessed in my shit. I blessed it, I blessed it.

59:07.460 --> 59:09.980
You blessed it. Yeah, Vegan Gale Friends.

59:09.980 --> 59:13.900
Yeah. Well, you just mined our friendship.

59:13.900 --> 59:20.020
All right, so you're raised in Ireland. They have a house there. How do you end up back

59:20.020 --> 59:23.860
in Canada? It was really not exciting. We just came back

59:23.860 --> 59:25.820
to Canada. We're going to make it exciting.

59:25.820 --> 59:32.820
Thank you. We came back to Canada and then I moved to Toronto because I was vegan and

59:32.820 --> 59:38.020
I wanted to be vegan in a place where I was raised in a Mennonite town like in Canada.

59:38.020 --> 59:46.820
It's called Elmira, if anybody knows it. What's the place called?

59:46.820 --> 59:57.820
It's called Elmira. Wait, did you just say Elmira? Sorry, couldn't hear it.

59:57.820 --> 01:00:03.220
Do you know what the Urdu word for cupboard is? This is true. Urdu word for cupboard?

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:13.380
Elmira. But it really is. Sorry, I was saying Urdu.

01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:19.820
And all right. I wanted to be a comedian and a vegan at the same time.

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:23.020
That's really hard. The only place to do that is Toronto.

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:31.780
You need meat protein to be on stage. I'm going to die now.

01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:37.180
I feel like the veganism is a point that you really want to be pushed in the movie.

01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:41.540
You want to make sure that's included. It is why I moved out of the Mennonite

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:46.420
capital of Canada. That's probably wrong. All right, thank you.

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:49.700
What is a Mennonite? I was afraid to sound stupid.

01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.780
What is a Mennonite? Thank you, sir.

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:57.220
I'm blaming it all. Mennonites are wrong.

01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:04.580
I need a Mennonomic device to remember what a Mennonite is.

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:09.700
This is the second time I've heard it mentioned in Canada.

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:12.660
Someone mentioned Mennonites to me in Banff and I nodded.

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:17.220
It felt charged. It felt like there was something going on and I was like, okay.

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:19.980
It's like the Amish. Yeah, if you know what an Amish is, you

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:24.060
know what a Mennonite is. It's like a quaker.

01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:31.020
Yeah. Like a Mennonite.

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:34.740
Yeah, yeah, like diet. What do you mean diet Mennonite?

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:39.220
Some dude yelled out diet Mennonite and he was like, hey, exactly.

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:41.580
What do you mean? It's like a lapsed Catholic.

01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:44.900
I just assumed that he meant like Amish is like a diet Mennonite because you guys are

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:47.860
more hardcore. I don't think Amish is a diet, anything.

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:51.020
I think they're the worst. Well, you haven't met a Mennonite then.

01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:55.500
I mean, I have now. I'm not a Mennonite. You are a diet Mennonite.

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:59.580
All right. Who's on first? All right. I think, well, let's thank

01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:04.820
Anya for volunteering or life to us. Anya, everybody.

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:09.020
You should probably go and have a seat and watch your bio pic.

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:15.300
Anya. Let's hear from Anya.

01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:20.580
Oh boy. The girl who knows about Inuits and veganism.

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:28.900
Okay. Good on you. Thank you, sir.

01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:33.900
Do it, Dan. That's a pizzinga. That was a pizzinga.

01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:37.420
I really feel like that guy should get that bottle of vodka Dan just picked up for that

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:38.420
time. Wait, so what?

01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:43.820
The guy just had a funny joke. Dan heard someone stealing vodka and he

01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:49.340
was, he demurred. All right. So, okay. So, right.

01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:52.940
We probably don't have control of her lights, but fade in.

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:56.340
Can we, can we go completely to black to start this off?

01:02:56.340 --> 01:03:06.340
The bridge is gone. There we go.

01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:36.260
Uh, Ontario, 1989. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Patrick.

01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:50.740
Yes, oh, yes. Oh, maybe we, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe it's coming out of me.

01:03:50.740 --> 01:04:02.500
I hope it's a, I hope it's a, it's a strong lad who loves meat.

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:03.500
I think.

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:07.340
I hope you don't give birth to another vegan.

01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:08.340
Let's find out.

01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:11.740
You're going to give birth to a standing up.

01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:14.020
You're going to do another standing birth.

01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:15.020
It's so gross.

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:17.260
So I'll have to get the mop out again.

01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:18.260
It's the Gaelic way.

01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:19.260
It's Gaelic medicine.

01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:20.260
Go ahead.

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:21.260
Just squeeze her out.

01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:22.260
Squeeze her out.

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:42.140
Just squeeze her out, squeeze her out, squeeze her out.

01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:43.140
She's come.

01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:44.140
Hello.

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:45.140
Oh, Philly.

01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:46.140
She's come full dressed.

01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:47.140
She's come fully dressed.

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:48.140
Look at her.

01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:49.140
What if I wasn't?

01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:53.380
Don't watch a pretty Irish lass.

01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:54.380
She's like that.

01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:55.380
A chap on the moon.

01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:56.380
I'm sorry.

01:04:56.380 --> 01:05:00.380
Is that soy milk or is that people milk?

01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:03.860
Because I really, I'm like not into it, mom.

01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:04.860
Kill her.

01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:05.860
Kill her.

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:06.860
She bears the mark.

01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:07.860
Kill her.

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:08.860
No.

01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:09.860
No.

01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:10.860
No.

01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:11.860
She cannot stay here.

01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:12.860
She cannot stay here.

01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:13.860
We have to send her to Canada.

01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:14.860
We are in Canada.

01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:15.860
We're in Canada now.

01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:16.860
Okay, fucking no.

01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:17.860
Are we?

01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:18.860
Yes.

01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:19.860
We're in Canada.

01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:20.860
The only thing I remember to bear...

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:21.860
We're currently in Canada.

01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:22.860
Okay, okay.

01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:23.860
I'm going to go to Ireland.

01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:24.860
Sightbar.

01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:25.860
Sightbar.

01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:26.860
Sightbar.

01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:27.860
No, you'll be raised in Ireland.

01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:28.860
You'll be a...

01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:29.860
We're gonna...

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:30.860
We'll raise her...

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:31.860
We'll raise her...

01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:32.860
She already knows more than us.

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:36.180
We'll raise her in Ireland and then we'll send her back to Toronto.

01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:40.500
She must stay away from the Mennonites.

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.300
If they find out she's vegan.

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:47.180
Oh, the Kalei is in the Shalubas.

01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:49.420
And I'm a hell of a vegan, guys, so...

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:54.460
Oh, my God, she's already a millennial.

01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:55.460
They grow so fast.

01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:58.100
We've got to get you to the mother country.

01:05:58.100 --> 01:05:59.700
There's too many Mennonites about...

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:02.500
Do they have vegan haggis there or a vegan...

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:03.500
Is it gonna be like...

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:04.500
There's shamrocks everywhere.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:05.500
Anya.

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:06.500
Just be careful.

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:07.500
Anya.

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:08.500
Oh.

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:09.500
Anya.

01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:10.500
Yes.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:14.540
I am your spirit guide.

01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:15.540
Thank you spirit guide.

01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:19.900
And as any puttagooka...

01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:28.020
Avenge me!

01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:29.460
I hear the old lord.

01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:30.620
How best to avenge you?

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:31.620
How best?

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:32.620
Uh...

01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:33.620
Start an Instagram account.

01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:44.260
It must be nice to have this all laid out for you.

01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:50.260
Hey, pretty girl, will you be my vegan girlfriend?

01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:55.020
He's a Mennonite.

01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:56.780
He's a diet Mennonite.

01:06:56.780 --> 01:07:00.740
And I think he's hot.

01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:02.140
You mustn't.

01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:03.540
This love is forbidden.

01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:10.940
Oh, Jedediah, Jedediah, you shouldn't mess with these Irish Canadians.

01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:14.180
That's right, I'm Canadian, not Irish.

01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:15.180
Ha!

01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:18.300
She can hear everything we're saying.

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.460
Burn her!

01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:22.180
Run!

01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:24.220
To Ireland with you!

01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:25.780
To Ireland!

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:29.780
Feed the ghillies ghillie...

01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:34.420
Pugs and pugs and pugs and banney pugs.

01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:35.420
This is your...

01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:36.420
Green Hills.

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:37.420
A fine day!

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:38.420
A fine day!

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:43.620
That's not gonna happen again.

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:45.180
She's, she's river dancing.

01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:50.680
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Anya!

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:52.180
Come home for dinner!

01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:54.940
Yes, come on!

01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:57.140
Ireland, 2003.

01:07:57.140 --> 01:08:02.580
What, what, what are we having?

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:06.740
Did you have a good time in the green hills of Ireland?

01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:08.380
Not at all.

01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:11.660
They made me try to speak Gaelic, and I don't even think that's the language.

01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:12.660
With maybe Irish.

01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:13.660
I don't actually know.

01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:20.540
At least you're safe from those filthy Mennonites.

01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:29.740
I personally suspect they had a hand in 9-Eleven.

01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:30.740
I've aged.

01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:31.740
What, what, what, Patrick?

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:32.740
The Mennonites are coming.

01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:43.620
The Mennonites are coming?

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:44.620
Your father's been killed.

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:45.620
Also, winter is coming.

01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:51.620
It's like Mennonites, but they're like, no.

01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:56.620
Hey, I found out the Mennonites were responsible for 9-Eleven.

01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:57.980
And one of their names was Muhammad.

01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:00.500
I've drawn a picture of him.

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:04.980
What the, no, wait, are you on our side or who?

01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:07.860
I just have to finish drawing the beard.

01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:08.860
No!

01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:09.860
No!

01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:10.860
Wait, Anya!

01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:11.860
Freeze time!

01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:12.860
Begin!

01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:18.740
I can only do this once in a lifetime, Anya.

01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:19.740
Your name in Oodoo.

01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:20.740
Do it there.

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:21.740
I'm waiting.

01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:22.740
Father, please.

01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:23.740
Mother, mother, I'm waiting.

01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:24.740
Mother, mother.

01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:32.500
I've grown old, I've grown old.

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:33.500
You look beautiful.

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.940
You look a little like Hodor, though.

01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:39.620
I'm Sally Field with prosthetics.

01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:44.220
Your name in Urdu means cupboard.

01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:46.380
I don't think that's true.

01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:49.980
Look within yourself.

01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:52.780
You'll find canned goods.

01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:55.780
I will be a cupboard for Satan and Choke.

01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:56.780
Anya!

01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:57.780
Anya!

01:09:57.780 --> 01:09:58.780
This is your spirit guide.

01:09:58.780 --> 01:09:59.780
Yes.

01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:00.780
Yes.

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:01.780
Hang on one second.

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:02.780
Any Pogodoo.

01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:03.780
Yes.

01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:04.780
Yes.

01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:05.780
He met your name as Elmira in Urdu.

01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:06.780
Oh, that actually does make sense.

01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:07.780
Thank you, spirit guide.

01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:08.780
Thank you.

01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:09.780
Elmira.

01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:10.780
Oh, wait, wait.

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:11.780
Oh, shit, yeah.

01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:12.780
Oh.

01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:13.780
Yeah.

01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:14.780
Oh.

01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:15.780
Okay.

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:16.780
I was just...

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:17.780
I was just...

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:18.780
Yeah, no, that's good.

01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:19.780
We should wrap this up.

01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:20.780
I've...

01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:21.780
I don't know why.

01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:23.780
It's going great.

01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:29.180
You know what?

01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:32.500
This family has no more left.

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:33.500
You have no choice.

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:37.780
I have no choice but to trust that Mennonite boy that was calling on you.

01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:38.780
What does that mean?

01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:42.660
Does that mean what I think it means?

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:47.780
If this family must continue, by any means, it must continue.

01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:48.780
Here.

01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:53.780
Look.

01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:56.780
What?

01:10:56.780 --> 01:11:04.780
May the town of Elmira be the cupboard in which the non-perishable dry goods of love

01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:12.780
happened to be already when it was opened.

01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:15.780
All this is for you.

01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:17.780
All this is for you.

01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:19.780
I truly feel chosen.

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:21.780
All this is for you.

01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:22.780
All this?

01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:24.780
All this.

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:28.780
You'll see.

01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:29.780
Anya.

01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:30.780
Anya, this is your spirit guide.

01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:31.780
Hang on one second, guys.

01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:32.780
Yes.

01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:33.780
Yes.

01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:34.780
Yes, spirit guide.

01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:35.780
Don't look on his ceiling.

01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:36.780
All this is for you.

01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:37.780
All this is for you.

01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:38.780
All right.

01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:39.780
All right.

01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:40.780
That's it.

01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:41.780
We did it.

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:42.780
We did it.

01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:43.780
That's Anya's biopic.

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:44.780
We fucking did it.

01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:45.780
Yeah.

01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:50.780
Yeah.

01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:51.780
Yo.

01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:52.780
Yo.

01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:53.780
Yo.

01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:54.780
Yo.

01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:55.780
Yo.

01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:56.780
Yo.

01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:57.780
Yo.

01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:58.780
Yo.

01:11:58.780 --> 01:11:59.780
Yo.

01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:00.780
Yo.

01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:01.780
Yo.

01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:06.780
Final credits rap, ending credits rap about the Anya movie.

01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:08.780
I've got a credits rap.

01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:09.780
Yo.

01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:10.780
Anya.

01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:11.780
Anya.

01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:12.780
Anya.

01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:13.780
Anya.

01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:14.780
Anya.

01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:15.780
All right.

01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:16.780
Yo.

01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:17.780
Who's got a men and knight?

01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:18.780
Who's pussy's good and tight?

01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:20.780
Who wants to fuck all night?

01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:21.780
Anya.

01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:22.780
Anya.

01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:23.780
All right.

01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:24.780
All right.

01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:26.780
That got two gangster.

01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:27.780
So quickly, also.

01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:29.780
Who wants to men and knight?

01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:31.780
Who's pussy's good and tight?

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:34.780
Who wants to fuck all night?

01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:35.780
Yeah.

01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:36.780
You peaked too quickly.

01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:39.780
You gotta save that for the end of the rap.

01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:42.780
It was badass, but then the two-thirty of the way through, I was like, who's a human

01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:43.780
being in the audience?

01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:50.580
You should maybe add, your pussy's good and tight.

01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:51.580
You got top that?

01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:52.580
Yeah.

01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:54.580
That could be a record.

01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:58.460
My girlfriend's cousin's in the audience.

01:12:58.460 --> 01:12:59.460
Just met them.

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:03.460
They're like, what's the show about?

01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:04.460
You'll see.

01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:05.460
You'll see.

01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:10.860
Now, have you seen Prairie Home Companion?

01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:14.860
It's like that, but it's a felony.

01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:15.860
And it's not.

01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:16.860
Spencer, how are you doing over there?

01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:18.740
Oh, I'm so good.

01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:22.460
Remember when we were talking about rituals for young adults?

01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:23.460
Yes.

01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:24.460
Bruce Lee Day.

01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:27.940
Tell us more, please.

01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:31.740
I mean, who's the perfect masculine mascot?

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:32.740
Bruce Lee.

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:34.380
To usher you into manhood?

01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:35.380
To everybody.

01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:37.140
To all men.

01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:38.660
Who doesn't look up to Bruce Lee?

01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:40.180
He's fucking perfect.

01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:47.620
He embodies physical acuity, violence in a healthy way that's not like, well, I mean,

01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:48.620
he's a philosopher.

01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:53.980
It's hard to deny that violence is part of, you know, at least the traditional masculine

01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:55.620
identity in some form.

01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:58.540
It's just usually that violence is bad.

01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:00.420
What does one do on Bruce Lee Day?

01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:01.420
What?

01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:04.500
How do you celebrate if you're a 12 or 13-year-old boy?

01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:07.660
You break boards?

01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:13.940
You follow the code of ethics that Bruce Lee puts forth to make you learn how to do a one-inch

01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:14.940
punch?

01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:20.020
Or the one-inch punch that I used to have a little flip book when I was a kid of Bruce

01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:23.900
Lee doing nunchucks, and I would like try and train.

01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:27.860
I would watch the flip book, and then try and train myself to do it.

01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:28.860
That's amazing.

01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:33.140
You're like, you flip, and then you start, and then you're trying to do it in one hand.

01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:34.140
You're like, ah.

01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:35.140
And I have to pause it.

01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:38.660
It's very hard to do a flip book with one hand.

01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:40.180
That's exactly what you would do, though.

01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:42.180
It's a good technique.

01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:47.260
Did you ever try break dancing by watching break in two or something, and then rewinding

01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:48.980
on the VCR, and then you try to do it?

01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:50.620
Doing the slow-mo of it?

01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:51.620
Never worked.

01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:52.620
Turbo in Ozone.

01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:57.780
My brother and I spent hours just trying to learn to break dance, and we never did.

01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:00.860
Can we see a little more of that?

01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:02.940
What do you mean it never worked?

01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:05.260
This is the podcast, right?

01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:06.660
This is called Poppin' and Lockin'.

01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:09.660
Oh my God!

01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:15.660
Holy shit!

01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:26.660
I'm so glad Corey Thelma can be here tonight.

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:36.660
That was amazing.

01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:40.300
Very good.

01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:47.140
It's probably good that little kids, I saw a thing that said, when you go through puberty,

01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:55.460
little boys, like the sexual and the violent parts of their brains start to all match.

01:15:55.460 --> 01:16:00.220
They start to light up like crazy at the same time, and they kind of like drift over.

01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:02.660
Oh, the animal stuff, the sex and the violence.

01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:04.980
Yes, but who do you think is doing the research?

01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:05.980
I know, I know.

01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:09.820
It's such a weird pop-size thing to do.

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:20.500
But if that were true, little boys were prone to hit things with their firetruck toy, and

01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:28.260
you couldn't think of a healthier way to collect and redirect that than martial arts classes.

01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:32.460
Because you would go like, okay, yeah, you have to like, if you really concentrate and

01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:37.300
go to bed when we tell you to, you'll be able to kick the world's ass, but you have to wait

01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:39.300
for the world to attack you.

01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:43.300
It's like, okay, now it's your problem, next generation.

01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:47.940
When this guy's 30, he'll be Ted Bundy, but fuck it.

01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:51.620
He's just like going to bed every night with a poster of a naked man above it, and he's

01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:52.620
just doing push-ups.

01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:55.740
Like, one day I'll beat up everyone.

01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:57.620
But everyone has to attack me first.

01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:01.020
Yeah, I mean, maybe it'll be the way they talk to me at the grocery store, but they'll

01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:06.900
attack me.

01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:07.900
Can I say something?

01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:12.140
When I did my show here earlier tonight, I saw this beautiful theater, and I was like,

01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:18.660
how is Harmontown going to feel like Harmontown in this space?

01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:22.700
And you guys did a great job.

01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:25.900
It's felt like a Harmontown.

01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:26.900
More so, really.

01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:27.900
I mean, they're very chill.

01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:28.900
They're very, very welcoming.

01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:29.900
This is a good audience.

01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:31.900
Yeah, usually much closer.

01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:37.940
It makes me want to meet more of them, like I want to kind of like, is this me pimping

01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:44.580
you guys too much, or Emily, if I like, because you were at one point, you had a therapeutic

01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:53.580
career, you've written many things about relationships and things, we bring up a couple, and get

01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:54.580
to know them.

01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:56.580
Are we going to watch them have sex, or?

01:17:56.580 --> 01:18:01.980
No, I'm just like, maybe they have an issue that they're trying to deal with.

01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:02.980
Well, that's fun.

01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:06.980
I find that often people don't volunteer for things like this, but let's see what happens.

01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:08.980
Well, haven't you been to my show?

01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:10.980
There's a couple right there.

01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:14.900
What's so great is that a couple raised their hands, but also their friends are pointing

01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:15.900
like these guys.

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:16.900
They're like, yeah.

01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:17.900
Get them out of here.

01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:18.900
They've got shit to work out.

01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:21.500
Chad and Natalie, you need to talk to them right now.

01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:23.660
Okay, you guys want to come up?

01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:26.700
You guys really have a, oh my God, Emily.

01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:30.700
So we've got two stools here.

01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:34.700
All right.

01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:37.700
And we're totally going to watch these people have sex.

01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:40.700
We're totally going to watch these people have sex.

01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:41.700
Hello.

01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:44.700
We're totally going to watch these people have sex.

01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:45.700
Hello, hello.

01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:46.700
Nice to meet you.

01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:47.700
Colin and Lauren.

01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:49.700
You have seats at your stools.

01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:50.700
Hello.

01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:51.700
Colin and Lauren, correct?

01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:52.700
Yes, thank you.

01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:53.700
Colin and Lauren, everybody.

01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:56.700
Your first task is you have to figure out how to share a microphone.

01:18:56.700 --> 01:18:58.700
Yeah, I was just going to say.

01:18:58.700 --> 01:18:59.700
Go ahead.

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:00.700
Eat it, right?

01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:05.700
I would say put it in the holder and that way you guys have a natural like give and take

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:09.700
where you have to like lean in and like you have that visual cue of like, I'm going to

01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:10.700
talk.

01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:11.700
No, I'm going to talk.

01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:12.700
Fuck you.

01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:14.460
So your names are again.

01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:15.700
My name is Colin.

01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:16.700
Lauren.

01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:17.700
Colin and Lauren.

01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:18.700
All right.

01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:20.700
So what's the problem?

01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:25.260
I guess, well, we've been living together for the last little bit, but I'm broke and

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:27.180
I'm going to have to move back in with my parents.

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:30.780
So we're going to be splitting up that way, but not all together.

01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:33.620
But yeah, so we're not going to be seeing each other as much.

01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:34.620
You guys have been living together?

01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:35.620
Yes.

01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:36.620
Okay.

01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:39.460
To be fair, we've been living together pretty much since we've known each other.

01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:40.460
How long have you been together?

01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:42.460
About a year now, actually.

01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:43.460
Yeah.

01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:44.460
Okay.

01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:45.460
Not too much.

01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:46.460
So you kind of moved in almost immediately?

01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:47.460
I moved in.

01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:48.460
Yeah.

01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:49.460
I moved in immediately.

01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:50.460
Immediately.

01:19:50.460 --> 01:20:01.580
And, well, and you consumed his, now he has to leave, but wait, how would, how did that

01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:02.580
happen?

01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:05.900
That show game, like you moved, you moved in and now he has to go move his parents and

01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:06.900
you're keeping me apart.

01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:10.740
To somebody paying rent, it sounds like.

01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:11.740
You got a job.

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:13.580
This was an active year for you.

01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:16.420
Are you staying in his place?

01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:18.780
He's moving in, oh no, I'm not staying in his place.

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:19.780
You're moving out of that place.

01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:20.780
Okay.

01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:21.780
Okay.

01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:22.780
Technically, I have my own house.

01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:23.780
I just never go there.

01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:24.780
All right.

01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:25.780
Take it easy.

01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:30.620
You guys came with like seven friends and they're, like, they're up here.

01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:31.620
That's enough.

01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:32.620
All right.

01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:33.620
So Lauren.

01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:36.820
Lauren, you moved in, you moved in to Collins Crib.

01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:37.820
Yeah.

01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:39.460
About a year ago.

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:44.940
And then Collins, you've fallen on hard times and you got to move back in with the family.

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:45.940
Yes.

01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:47.180
Now, Lauren, where are you headed now?

01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:48.740
I have to go to my apartment.

01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:49.860
Well, my house.

01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:50.860
I'm very disappointed.

01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:51.860
You have your own home?

01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:52.860
Yeah.

01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:53.860
I'm very disappointed.

01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:56.860
Why can't Collins move into your fucking house?

01:20:56.860 --> 01:21:02.060
He supported you for a year.

01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:06.260
Well, let me ask first, what's been the rent situation?

01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:10.020
What's been the, who pays the rent in the house that you guys have been in?

01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:11.020
You have been paying.

01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:12.020
So I've been paying the rent.

01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:13.020
I do have a roommate.

01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:14.020
He's with me in the front row as well.

01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:15.020
Sure.

01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:16.020
But yes, I've been paying the rent.

01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:17.020
You haven't been paying the rent.

01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:18.020
No.

01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:19.020
Yes.

01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:20.020
Yes.

01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:21.020
Okay.

01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:22.020
I'll write that.

01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:24.820
So you weren't living with him because you needed to, you just were spending all your

01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:25.820
time.

01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:26.820
That's just kind of unusual.

01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:27.820
You guys want to be together.

01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:29.340
You had, you've been paying rent on your house.

01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:30.340
Yes.

01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:31.340
Okay, gotcha.

01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:32.900
So what is your issue with having him move in with you?

01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:35.940
He's kind of supported you in some, some fashion.

01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:39.300
So what's the issue with having him move in?

01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:42.820
It's not as much him as like my situation.

01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:46.860
What, are you a fanatic or what are you doing?

01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:48.540
Why are you being so vain?

01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:54.620
By the way, the trick to being a therapist is to just ask the most obvious questions.

01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:57.460
So what is your situation?

01:21:57.460 --> 01:22:02.300
I'm new to town and I moved in with people from my residence at university.

01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:04.540
Oh, so you have a bunch of roommates.

01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:06.100
Oh, a ton of roommates.

01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:07.100
Okay.

01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:08.100
Very good people.

01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:09.100
Yeah.

01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:10.100
And you don't, you're not a fan.

01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:11.100
Yeah, exactly.

01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:13.100
Neither of you are fans or just calling?

01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:15.380
Yeah, neither of us are fans.

01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:19.700
And may I ask, are you two, would you consider yourselves in love?

01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:20.700
Very much so.

01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:21.700
Yeah.

01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:22.700
Yeah.

01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:23.700
Perfect.

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:24.700
Perfect.

01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:32.060
You don't want that to be answered at the same time.

01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:33.060
Yes.

01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:37.740
You want one person to say it and the other person in a white hot panic to repeat it.

01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:41.380
I saw a bit of equivocation on that.

01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:42.380
You guys are young.

01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:43.380
Yeah.

01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:46.340
I mean, I will say that's a good time being young.

01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:52.220
Like, look, I've cohabitated with like a thousand people and it's always been the path

01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:54.340
of least resistance, the logical thing to do.

01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:59.420
So if there are a couple of little riddler question marks on their labyrinth like map,

01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:00.420
what the fucking metaphor?

01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:01.420
What is that metaphor?

01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:06.980
I just, I just sprayed my neck on it.

01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:10.660
It's probably all good and well for us to have a couple head scratches when we hear

01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:14.500
the situation because they're at a time in their lives when maybe they shouldn't have

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:16.300
this shit all figured out.

01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:22.620
So it sounds like you had 100% control when it was his apartment, but...

01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:23.860
You always had your own place to go back to.

01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:27.740
She could always, if they had a fight, if he turned out to be like own a collection of

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:33.860
human teeth, like she could just, if he was, if he like during lovemaking cried out, I'm

01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:37.460
actually from Montreal.

01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:38.460
She could quietly slip out.

01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:39.460
I'm a Mennonite.

01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:43.580
You won't have that anymore.

01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:47.460
But not only is it more real, but also it's probably not even possible because it sounds

01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:55.060
like your living situation is more of a like a burning man kind of tent that you're curiously

01:23:55.060 --> 01:24:01.100
committed to though, like you have like a year contract at like a hostel.

01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:08.020
Now Lauren, what is the, or either of you, what do you think the next step is, like Colin

01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:11.060
you're moving into a new place, so you're, you're searching for new places?

01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:12.060
Moving back with my parents.

01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:13.060
Where are your parents?

01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:17.020
My parents, um, we're not from Toronto, we're Peterborough, which is two hours north, they're

01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:18.020
in Peterborough as well.

01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:19.020
Peterborough!

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:20.020
So you guys...

01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:25.020
I have family in Peter, Peterborough, is that what it's called?

01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:26.020
You too?

01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:27.020
Peterborough.

01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:29.020
So you guys are going to be two hours apart now.

01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:32.020
No, we'll just be like, I don't know, ten minute drive.

01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:35.020
Wait, wait, how, where the fuck do you live then?

01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:36.500
Oh, I live in Peterborough too.

01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:38.500
I moved there for school.

01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:39.500
Oh!

01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:40.500
Okay.

01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:41.500
All right, okay.

01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:44.500
So you guys will be, I was like, go ahead Emily, you're the pro here.

01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:49.220
I'm so confused Emily, you have, you have a degree in this one, fucking take over.

01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:54.940
I have a degree in Peterborough, uh, whichever one it is, uh, I think I, and there's a term

01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:59.420
called sliding, not deciding, which is like when people end up, couples end up moving

01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:03.460
in together more out of necessity and like they need cheap rent more than because they've

01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:08.180
decided like I would like to spend all my time and have all my stuff paired with yours

01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:12.980
and those relationships end up splitting often because you don't feel like you're choosing

01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:14.460
to move in with someone you love.

01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:18.460
You feel like this is all we can do right now because we're broke as shit.

01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:19.460
And I think the most...

01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:21.460
You just described three quarters of my adult life.

01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:22.460
Exactly.

01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:24.460
And how do those work out?

01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:25.460
Exactly.

01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:30.460
And I'm just saying, wait, I've done that with several, uh, not, not you love.

01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:33.460
And I decided.

01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:38.460
And also you moved in with me and showed up with two, two, uh, grocery bags.

01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:39.460
I was like, I'm moving in.

01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:41.460
And I was like, I've made a huge mistake.

01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:43.460
That's pretty much what happened.

01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:49.460
They were not grocery bags, they were garbage bags.

01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:53.460
I couldn't fit everything I own into two grocery bags.

01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:54.460
Don't be crazy.

01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:55.460
Garbage bags?

01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:56.460
Sure.

01:25:56.460 --> 01:26:01.460
But you guys need to like, um, I think the obvious like, it doesn't sound like your living

01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:05.460
situation is stable, but I think maybe you need to work on your ideas of like, do you

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:12.460
fully committing to this would be at the next level, would be you guys moving into a place

01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:14.460
that's just the two of you, perhaps if you wanted.

01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:16.460
And maybe it's not time for that now.

01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:20.460
But if that's a goal, maybe that all you can agree on now is that that's the goal.

01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:25.460
And then you go to your parents' house, you go to your fucking burning man, and you guys

01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:31.460
are going to, there's a terror to, I've been in those relationships where I'm like, oh

01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:38.460
man, if we make this, if we go backward, it's going to be a disaster.

01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:41.460
I'm not saying that means it's going to be.

01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:48.460
I am saying if that were possible, then what's the point?

01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:54.460
And you will find, I think that it will romanticize everything.

01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:58.460
You'll be like, you'll be brushing your teeth again before you know it.

01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:00.460
It'll go back to dating.

01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:02.460
Yeah, you'll be dating.

01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:03.460
It'll happen.

01:27:03.460 --> 01:27:05.460
And it doesn't matter if it goes good or goes bad.

01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:09.460
It's not about bring the magic pack and all the spices, all that stuff.

01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:15.460
It's just like, yeah, you guys are children, and you can, you'll sustain this.

01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:20.460
Yeah, I guess my biggest concern is I've made steps to becoming an adult, a millennial adult.

01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:22.460
What have you done?

01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:24.460
401K?

01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:26.460
He moved out of his parents.

01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:30.460
And I work at a bong shop, so those are two adults.

01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:32.460
That's your individual, yeah.

01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:34.460
So you do have a job?

01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:38.460
Yes, but your job doesn't provide you enough to get your own place.

01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:40.460
Exactly, yes.

01:27:40.460 --> 01:27:41.460
What?

01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:43.460
It does suck.

01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:49.460
There's a room full of people here that will forgive you for having to take backwards steps in terms of that.

01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:55.460
The myth of you turning 18, leaving your parents' place and becoming a human being that creates other human beings.

01:27:55.460 --> 01:28:00.460
That's all steeped in a time before they figured out how to really tap the workforce and exploit them.

01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:01.460
You bet!

01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:07.460
Your generation now has seven jobs, and it's what the market will bear.

01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:10.460
I'm sure that's no different in any country you go to.

01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:15.460
It's like, oh, they can all work, and they can all fuck off and be children until they're 80.

01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:20.460
There's no shame in living with your parents until you're 70.

01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:22.460
There's some shame in that.

01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:24.460
There's some shame in that.

01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:25.460
There's some shame in that.

01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:26.460
Maybe a little shame.

01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:30.460
But I think as long as you're striving to whatever you're the next thing is you want to do,

01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:35.460
if it's a better bong shop where you get paid more, that's a thing.

01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:38.460
You got to start your own bong shop, bro.

01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:39.460
Yeah!

01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:43.460
We're looking at legalization 2017 in Canada, so you never go.

01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:44.460
That's amazing.

01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:47.460
So then those bongs will be worthless.

01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:48.460
Exactly.

01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:51.460
Do you think that the vape culture has hurt the bong culture?

01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:52.460
100% no, Jeff.

01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:54.460
I will fight that to a T.

01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:56.460
I didn't have an opinion.

01:28:56.460 --> 01:28:58.460
I would just...

01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:00.460
I get paid to have an opinion.

01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:03.460
I wasn't going fucking Hillary on you, man.

01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:06.460
Where are you guys on Kratom?

01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:09.460
Speaking of which, actually, I sell Kratom at my shop.

01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:11.460
Not for human consumption, of course.

01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:15.460
But no, I have a lot of customers who seriously helps with their addictions.

01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:17.460
Methadone is a serious problem for a lot of people.

01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:18.460
I love this dude.

01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:20.460
If you can find a natural substitute, hey, why not?

01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:21.460
Absolutely.

01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:22.460
This is the direction you need to go in.

01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:23.460
Look how animated you've gotten.

01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:24.460
This is like your passion.

01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:25.460
This is where you need to go.

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:28.460
Why don't you plug where you work right now, and when there's a line outside tomorrow,

01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:30.460
tell your boss, I should be an associate something.

01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:31.460
Yes, thank you.

01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:32.460
Yes.

01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:37.460
I work at Pipe Dreams on George Street in Peterborough, 416 George Street North.

01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:38.460
Come see me.

01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:41.460
We're locally owned and operated for 20 years, so hey.

01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:42.460
Oh, it's a family shop.

01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:43.460
I like that.

01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:46.460
Colin and Lauren's relationship is on GoFundMe.com.

01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:47.460
Yeah!

01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:54.460
And Colin, I'll say at master's degree, couples and family therapy, and this is now what I'm

01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:55.460
doing for a living.

01:29:55.460 --> 01:29:56.460
It's always okay.

01:29:56.460 --> 01:30:00.460
It's always okay to go in a random direction and not do the thing that you thought you

01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:01.460
were supposed to do.

01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:02.460
Yep.

01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:03.460
Never be afraid to start over.

01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:07.460
That's all we're ever going to do over and over again.

01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:12.460
Sorry, I didn't hear any of that.

01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:14.460
It wasn't important.

01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:15.460
About me, Indies.

01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:16.460
Indies, hey.

01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:21.460
I was looking at my one note on my thing.

01:30:21.460 --> 01:30:22.460
Lauren, what is your bag?

01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:23.460
What is your dream gig?

01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:24.460
What do you do?

01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:25.460
What's going on with you?

01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:28.460
I'm actually in school for psychology right now.

01:30:28.460 --> 01:30:29.460
Oh, shit.

01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:30.460
Oh.

01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:31.460
There you go.

01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:34.460
I mean, do it for a few years, see what happens.

01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:39.460
Someday you might be in Harmontown, but fuck, you already are.

01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:41.460
She's so far ahead of you.

01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:42.460
God damn it.

01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:47.460
You ought to actually be at their best and practice for years to end up in Harmontown.

01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:49.460
You may create a Harmontown.

01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:50.460
Emily created it.

01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:52.460
She thought only down this podcast only existed as Emily.

01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:54.460
We're only here because of Emily Gordon.

01:30:54.460 --> 01:30:55.460
Emily Gordon is the reason that-

01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:56.460
Look at that.

01:30:56.460 --> 01:31:03.460
It's a little misleading, but I'll take the applause.

01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:04.460
Thank you.

01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:08.460
Emily Gordon asked a recently fired from NBC, Dan Harmon.

01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:09.460
Would you want to do a show?

01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:10.460
Was that about 10 minutes?

01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:15.460
Yeah, we were just at a bar and I was like, I'm running this theater in LA and I desperately

01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:16.460
need shows.

01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:19.460
You should just get on stage and talk and you're like, okay.

01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:22.460
I've been waiting for someone to say that.

01:31:22.460 --> 01:31:26.460
I thought it was supposed to be a shame to that.

01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:32.460
I would say it's become the thing that's what that theater is known for.

01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:39.460
Can we share like an anarcho-syndicalist kind of little society where Colin gives us bongs

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:48.460
and Lauren and Emily give us psychological advice and Kumail does whatever Kumail does.

01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:53.460
I say things are racist.

01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:54.460
But for free.

01:31:54.460 --> 01:31:55.460
But for free.

01:31:55.460 --> 01:31:56.460
You don't charge.

01:31:56.460 --> 01:32:00.460
It's mutual reciprocity and we all just provide everything.

01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:05.760
I feel like for the vibe that we got on, we walked on stage and the amount of volume and

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:12.460
love that you get when you come into a Harmontown show, not to inflate this own balloon, but

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:17.460
like walking down the street and the people come up and be like, oh, shit, this is Harmontown.

01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:21.060
There's a feeling of community there and I feel like there's a possibility that if we

01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:25.460
all just felt passionate and moved in or out of each other's apartments or back to their

01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:30.300
parents' apartments and all did whatever we all love to do, something fantastic, we could

01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:31.300
get back on.

01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:33.300
Let's run in there with 4,000 people from Ontario.

01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:34.300
All right.

01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:35.300
What were they saying?

01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:36.300
They'd say take off hoses.

01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:37.300
Take off hoses?

01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:38.300
They'd say no.

01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:39.300
These hoses aren't taking off.

01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:40.300
These hoses are here to stay.

01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:53.300
These hoses are, yeah, these hoses aren't taking on the system.

01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:54.300
Lauren.

01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:55.300
It's Lauren.

01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:56.300
Yes.

01:32:56.300 --> 01:33:03.300
So that house you're staying in, that's good practice for an aspiring mental health.

01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:04.300
Yes.

01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:09.300
Do you think, do you think, do you, are they listening?

01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:12.300
I feel they really hope not.

01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:13.300
Okay.

01:33:13.300 --> 01:33:15.300
Are any of them here in the house tonight?

01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:16.300
No.

01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:17.300
Oh, God, no.

01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:18.300
All of Colin's friends are here tonight.

01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:24.300
This seemed like a great bunch.

01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:27.300
I feel like we got the wrong people on stage.

01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:32.300
We have the Canadian Dave Kline over here.

01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:35.300
He's fine down there.

01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:38.300
He's fine down there.

01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:39.300
All right.

01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:40.300
Well, let's keep moving forward.

01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:42.300
Let's hear it for Lauren and Colin.

01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:43.300
Colin and Lauren.

01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:45.300
You saved their relationship, Emily.

01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:46.300
Good job.

01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:47.300
All right.

01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:50.300
We're fucking, we're tearing up Toronto.

01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:55.300
I had, I had deep fried cauliflower tonight.

01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:57.300
Oh, I had that yesterday.

01:33:57.300 --> 01:34:01.300
You can fry cauliflower so deep that it doesn't matter that it's cauliflower.

01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:02.300
That's true.

01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:04.300
It may as well be beef, delicious beef.

01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:07.300
You can put, I had it with buffalo sauce and it was unbelievable.

01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:08.300
Deep fried cauliflower.

01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:09.300
You're so good.

01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:11.300
You can get that Mohawk bent back.

01:34:11.300 --> 01:34:12.300
Mohawk bent.

01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:13.300
All right.

01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:14.300
Oh, I wanted to ask.

01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:15.300
It's good.

01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:16.300
Not a local reference.

01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:17.300
Sorry, guys.

01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:20.300
I, I, I wanted to ask you Canadians.

01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:21.300
All right.

01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:27.300
Do you guys, are you, are you aware of the church of the Latter-day Saints?

01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:33.300
Have you heard the good news about menonitism?

01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:38.300
The great God Menon who provides you with cologne and shaving equipment.

01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:44.300
The smoothest shaved profit in all of Canada.

01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:47.300
Ah, menon.

01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:56.300
Uh, the, the, uh, uh, the, are you, are you guys, there's no way you're, are you even

01:34:56.300 --> 01:34:59.300
familiar with JonBenét Ramsey?

01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:02.300
That's a weird reaction.

01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:03.300
That's a weird reaction.

01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:07.300
This seems like a crazy thing to bring up two hours into a show.

01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:08.300
Is it true?

01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:13.300
It's even crazier thing to cheer for like they just said YouTube was coming on stage.

01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:14.300
Yeah.

01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:15.300
Well, they just did a hole.

01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:16.300
Are you into true crime?

01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:17.300
Love true crime.

01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:18.300
Haven't watched that, but love true crime stuff.

01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:19.300
Did you watch the John Benet thing?

01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:20.300
No, I don't know.

01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:21.300
Is it good?

01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:29.020
There's a guy, Dr. Henry Lee, who's a forensic wizard who has a very, very thick accent.

01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:34.420
Like he's Chinese and he, like he clearly has dedicated most of his brain to like, like

01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:37.300
studying forensics and like, it's.

01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:40.300
Well, what, like, what does he sound like?

01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:43.300
I think it would go a little something.

01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:44.300
Yeah.

01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:45.300
Go ahead.

01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:46.300
Like this.

01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:47.300
In his voice.

01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:48.300
Let's see.

01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:49.300
Let's see.

01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:50.300
Let's see.

01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:51.300
We're talking about cast off patterns of blood on the wall.

01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:52.300
Yeah.

01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:53.300
Maybe it was done.

01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:54.300
Let's do something.

01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:55.300
I mean, just do something.

01:35:55.300 --> 01:35:56.300
I guess you're a fan of the gentleman.

01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:57.300
Yeah.

01:35:57.300 --> 01:35:58.300
Let's say something really inoffensive.

01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:00.300
He's a waiter at a Chinese restaurant.

01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:03.300
A faithful impression.

01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:08.300
Technically, I was going to culminate this in doing an impression of him.

01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:09.300
Okay.

01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:10.300
All right.

01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:13.300
But it won't be racist because it's that one guy.

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:15.300
It's not a whole race.

01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:18.300
I'm actually, I'm just, this is just a personal attack.

01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:21.300
This is a personal.

01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:26.300
Anyway, there's filthy Chinese guy.

01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:28.300
What was he saying?

01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:30.300
He's a genius in his feet.

01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:38.300
He walks into a bar with a, with a, with a Nobel prize winning pollock and a, and a very

01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:39.300
nurturing rabbi.

01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:41.300
And the bartender just comes everywhere.

01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:42.300
It hits the ceiling.

01:36:42.300 --> 01:36:43.300
On the ceiling.

01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:44.300
Yeah.

01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:45.300
Okay.

01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:46.300
Go ahead.

01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:47.300
Sorry.

01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:53.300
Look, you, they were talking about the kid like John Panay, like, like, like, like, it

01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:57.300
comes down to this bowl of pineapple and, uh, are you serious?

01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:58.300
Yeah.

01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:03.300
Like the kid, the brother is like eating pineapple and they like, that's a theory that like, because

01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:07.300
she had some pineapple in her stomach that was digested on a certain amount that, you

01:37:07.300 --> 01:37:11.300
know, if you do a timeline, it's like, well, they're just like, is it?

01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:13.300
And so Dr. Henry Lee is explaining.

01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:18.300
He's like, like the theory of like, what if the brother got really mad, the nine year

01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:23.300
old brother that she took a piece of pineapple out of his, out of his bowl?

01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:24.300
Well, hold on, sir.

01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:28.300
I heard somebody, I'm fascinated that you're agitated by.

01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:30.300
I'm not, I'm not making fun of you.

01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:33.300
So the theory is, that might be, but like, Dr. Henry Lee is here tonight.

01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:38.300
He's like, he's explaining, he's going like, like, how did she get clobbered in the back

01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:40.300
of the head with a heavy object?

01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:42.300
And like, like, what does it have to do with the pineapple?

01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:49.300
And he's explaining and he says, uh, well, how about this?

01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:56.300
She come, she take, he say, don't steal my papal.

01:37:56.300 --> 01:37:57.300
Papal?

01:37:57.300 --> 01:37:58.300
That's it.

01:37:58.300 --> 01:37:59.300
Papal?

01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:03.300
I've never heard so many consonants removed from a word.

01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:08.300
I guess just one, but it's, it's just like such a, don't, don't steal my papal.

01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:09.300
That's a key consonant.

01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:12.300
He's miming a nine year old killing a six year old.

01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:15.300
And he's just like, it's just like, this is so much glee and he's so smart.

01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:17.300
And he's like, and it's like, it's just adorable.

01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:19.300
Like I wanted to make it like a little meme.

01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:22.300
Like, don't steal my papal.

01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:28.300
So his theory is that the brother was eating a bowl of papal.

01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:29.300
The brother was.

01:38:29.300 --> 01:38:30.300
No, the brother was.

01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:31.300
No, the brother was.

01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:32.300
And the sister took the papal.

01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:33.300
And she stole that papal.

01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:34.300
And then he, that's his theory.

01:38:34.300 --> 01:38:36.300
And then there was like a giant eight pound maglite.

01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:38.300
And he, with his nine year old Peter Parker.

01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:39.300
What there was.

01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:40.300
He was like, fuck you.

01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:43.300
What there was was an empty bowl of pineapple.

01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:44.300
He used that to kill her.

01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:45.300
That's the burner weapon.

01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:46.300
Okay.

01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:47.300
What do you do?

01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:48.300
What do you do?

01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:49.300
Would you just making that shit up?

01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:53.300
There was a full bowl of pineapple that supports the theory that's that, that shit was interrupted.

01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:54.300
That next night.

01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:55.300
Oh, we interrupted the papal.

01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:59.300
It was sitting there and then they show the brother, like they show him, like they're

01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:03.300
reviewing the case and they show him a picture of the, of the crime scene, but not the crime

01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:05.300
scene, but the, the, from the house.

01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:07.300
And they show him, there's a bowl of pineapple.

01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:08.300
They go, what's that?

01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:09.300
And he's like, I don't know.

01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:12.300
He didn't, no idea what pineapple is because he's fucked.

01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:13.300
He's like, man.

01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:14.300
Oh shit.

01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:17.300
That, that's the most important fruit in the world.

01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:19.300
So the whole family is involved in disposing of her body.

01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:21.300
I think they covered it up, right?

01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:23.300
The, the brother killed her by mistake.

01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:27.300
It kind of emerges as a, as a, I'm not going to say an uplifting story, but it kind of,

01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:30.300
like, when you look back on it, you go like, I think what we're about to do is one of the

01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:32.300
greatest improv reenactments of all time.

01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:33.300
No.

01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:34.300
No.

01:39:34.300 --> 01:39:35.300
No.

01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:36.300
It's a story.

01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:38.300
It's a story that must be told.

01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:39.300
I don't know.

01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:41.300
It goes to JonBenét Ramsey.

01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:43.300
He's like, no, please.

01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:44.300
I know.

01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:45.300
I know.

01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:46.300
I can't.

01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:47.300
I know.

01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:48.300
Good can come with that.

01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:50.300
I think we'll all wake up with cancer.

01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:55.300
Like, like, that makes us all worse than everyone.

01:39:55.300 --> 01:39:59.300
But they did in this show, this CBS show that they did this two part.

01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:04.300
And one of the things they did is they, they're demonstrating like the, how the wound was

01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:09.300
made and they have, like everybody agrees that the low point of this thing was they put

01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:13.300
a, they put a blonde wig on a pig head.

01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:14.300
Like the Mythbusters.

01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:21.300
And had a child actor boy that was the right age come in, hold the flash money.

01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:22.300
No.

01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:28.300
And the, our friends Karen Kilgariff from Georgia from, from my favorite murder are describing

01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:31.300
that and they're like, they're like, yeah, he's a child actor.

01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:33.300
So he's already somewhere else.

01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:39.300
And the look at, and he's such a good boy, child actor, clubbing a pig head in a wig

01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:42.300
with a mag light to demonstrate how it would have been.

01:40:42.300 --> 01:40:44.300
I can't wait to see his one man show.

01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:45.300
It's going to be great.

01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:46.300
Yeah.

01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:48.300
That sounds like the role of a lifetime.

01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:49.300
Yeah.

01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:52.300
The show is called a papaladay.

01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:53.300
Okay.

01:40:53.300 --> 01:40:55.300
Well, how about this pen apple thing, huh?

01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:57.300
This, that crazy guy doing that dance.

01:40:57.300 --> 01:40:59.300
You guys familiar with that viral thing?

01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:01.300
I saw it and I was like, you know what?

01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:02.300
Some things I don't need to click on.

01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:03.300
So I didn't click on it.

01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:04.300
What it is.

01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:06.300
If you clicked on it, it would go like this.

01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:07.300
I have an apple.

01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:09.300
I have a pen.

01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:11.300
I got an apple pen.

01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:13.300
I got a pen.

01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:15.300
I got a pineapple.

01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:17.300
It's totally coincidence.

01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:19.300
I got a pen pineapple.

01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:21.300
I don't really know the actual how it goes.

01:41:21.300 --> 01:41:22.300
Wait.

01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:24.300
But it's very catchy.

01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:27.300
Oh, the new Gangnam style or whatever.

01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:29.300
Yeah, it's kind of the new Gangnam style.

01:41:29.300 --> 01:41:30.300
Gangnam style?

01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:32.300
It's kind of the new Gangnam style.

01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:36.300
Can you take that again?

01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:40.300
It's sort of a bat mitzvah for a Gangnam style.

01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:43.300
I think.

01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:46.300
I love Canada.

01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:48.300
I love Ontario.

01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:51.300
I think it's my favorite province.

01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:53.300
Yeah?

01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:57.300
What is the capital of Canada?

01:41:57.300 --> 01:42:00.300
Alberta.

01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:02.300
No, Alberta is a province, right?

01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:04.300
Calgary is one of the...

01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:08.300
Toronto is the most populous city in all of Canada.

01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:11.300
Okay, that's a good Toronto fact.

01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:14.300
It has a hockey museum.

01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:16.300
No shit.

01:42:16.300 --> 01:42:18.300
And a CN tower.

01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:22.300
Oh yeah, you can walk up above.

01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:24.300
And it's...

01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:26.300
That was a call back to my show.

01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:29.300
That's how many people are here from the...

01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:31.300
These guys have been here all night.

01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:33.300
So many people stayed here.

01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:35.300
Well, we wanted to write by them.

01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:38.300
We wanted to send them home.

01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:41.300
You should freestyle and that will be it.

01:42:41.300 --> 01:42:45.300
How about a really fast D&D?

01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:48.300
Spencer, could you freestyle?

01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:51.300
Just for you guys.

01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:54.300
We only have like...

01:42:54.300 --> 01:42:56.300
We have to be done in four minutes.

01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:59.300
That sounds like a lot of fun.

01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:02.300
Before we jump on the plane, Jeff,

01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:04.300
I gave you the character sheets, right?

01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:06.300
Hand them out.

01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:08.300
Here they are.

01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:10.300
Spencer, take us to the dungeon.

01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:14.300
You find yourself outside of a waffle iron.

01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:17.300
That's it.

01:43:17.300 --> 01:43:21.300
Should we go in?

01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:25.300
I use trap sense on the waffle iron hinges.

01:43:25.300 --> 01:43:28.300
It's a waffle iron.

01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:30.300
What did you find out?

01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:32.300
Waffle iron seems safe.

01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:34.300
Let's go inside the waffle iron.

01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:36.300
What a waffle.

01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:38.300
Is it open?

01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:40.300
It opens.

01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:42.300
We open it.

01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:44.300
Are we bigger than it?

01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:46.300
It's a waffle iron.

01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:51.300
I thought waffle iron was maybe a chain of restaurants here.

01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:53.300
That's what I thought, too.

01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:55.300
I was thinking waffle house.

01:43:55.300 --> 01:44:01.300
My character is a third level IT engineer.

01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:06.300
It opens the waffle iron and says,

01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:08.300
guys, look.

01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:11.300
The Teflon scratched.

01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:13.300
That's fucked up.

01:44:13.300 --> 01:44:15.300
That can make you sick.

01:44:15.300 --> 01:44:17.300
I'm a hypochondriac, fourth level.

01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:19.300
Fourth level hypochondriac?

01:44:19.300 --> 01:44:21.300
Is that true? Scratched Teflon?

01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:23.300
Yeah, it can give you the flu.

01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:29.300
The stakes are so low for this D&D adventure.

01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:33.300
I'm a 14th level mage,

01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:39.300
and I cast a heel of feet of cold strava fever

01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:41.300
on Emily's character.

01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:42.300
I don't think it worked.

01:44:42.300 --> 01:44:43.300
I don't think it took.

01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:45.300
It didn't work.

01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:47.300
I'm a level 7 vegan.

01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:49.300
Oh, my God.

01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:51.300
Have you been a vegan girlfriend?

01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:54.300
I have a recipe where we can make a waffle

01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:57.300
that won't like rape any animals.

01:44:57.300 --> 01:45:00.300
Is there...

01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:02.300
I look around the waffle iron.

01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:04.300
Is there more stuff here?

01:45:04.300 --> 01:45:06.300
There's a counter.

01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:08.300
Oh, you're in a kitchen.

01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:09.300
Did I say that?

01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:10.300
Oh.

01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:11.300
Okay, you're in a kitchen.

01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:14.300
You're outside of a waffle iron.

01:45:14.300 --> 01:45:17.300
Is there an Elmira anywhere around?

01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:19.300
It's a strange way to put it.

01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:22.300
It makes it sound like the waffle iron is a destination.

01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:24.300
No argument.

01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:26.300
That's absolutely the case.

01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:29.300
I look around for the nearest Elmira.

01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:30.300
Say again?

01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:31.300
The nearest Elmira.

01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:34.300
That's a Pakistani cupboard.

01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:36.300
You open it.

01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:39.300
There's canned food.

01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:42.300
Guys, there's cans and food in here.

01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:44.300
Is there anything to make waffle batter?

01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:45.300
Oh, yeah.

01:45:45.300 --> 01:45:47.300
There's a box of Bisquick.

01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:48.300
It's in a can.

01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:50.300
And I think you only need water to mix with Bisquick.

01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:52.300
Does that have animal parts?

01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:53.300
Bisquick?

01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:54.300
I hope not.

01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:55.300
I don't think so.

01:45:55.300 --> 01:45:57.300
I examine the ingredients.

01:45:57.300 --> 01:46:02.300
Is it vegan?

01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:06.300
I use detect non-vegan products.

01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:08.300
It's non-vegan.

01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:11.300
Also, that's the ingredient salsa says that.

01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:13.300
It's non-vegan.

01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:19.300
I do a 20-minute speech about why veganism is important.

01:46:19.300 --> 01:46:24.300
I explain my gluten allergy.

01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:29.300
I take a picture of Kumail's character while he's doing the 20-minute thing,

01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:34.300
and I upload it with the sunrise filter.

01:46:34.300 --> 01:46:36.300
Ooh, pretty.

01:46:36.300 --> 01:46:41.300
You get 26 likes.

01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:42.300
Damn it, Spencer.

01:46:42.300 --> 01:46:44.300
You're the best person.

01:46:44.300 --> 01:46:48.300
You get four comments, but they're all the comments where they're just

01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:52.300
at replying some fucking random person.

01:46:52.300 --> 01:46:58.300
So I see if I can figure out who the patient zero of this comment thread is.

01:46:58.300 --> 01:47:01.300
It's patient underscore zero.

01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:06.300
What is that person's comment that's tipping off this controversy?

01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:09.300
At patient underscore one.

01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:11.300
Is one spelled out, or is it the number one?

01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:12.300
It's the word one.

01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:13.300
Okay.

01:47:13.300 --> 01:47:14.300
Wait, that's their comment?

01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:15.300
They just...

01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:16.300
Yeah, they're at replying.

01:47:16.300 --> 01:47:17.300
Yeah, they're at replying.

01:47:17.300 --> 01:47:19.300
They want to bring the French in like a...

01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:22.300
Yeah, check out this asshole talking about being a vegan.

01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:23.300
Oh, this sucks.

01:47:23.300 --> 01:47:24.300
All right.

01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:26.300
Are we making waffles or not, you guys?

01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:27.300
I closed that app.

01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:29.300
Yeah.

01:47:29.300 --> 01:47:33.300
I see, is there a new update for my Apple Watch?

01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:34.300
No.

01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:35.300
Okay.

01:47:35.300 --> 01:47:38.300
I've finished my speech about veganism.

01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:39.300
Again.

01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:43.300
Everyone is convinced of the power of your words.

01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:48.300
I take out my staff of golden rage.

01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:51.300
We're just a weapon I just made up.

01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:52.300
Yeah.

01:47:52.300 --> 01:47:54.300
And I strike the waffle iron.

01:47:54.300 --> 01:47:57.300
It goes into a rage.

01:47:57.300 --> 01:47:59.300

Yeah.

01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:01.300
That's what it does.

01:48:01.300 --> 01:48:02.300
Oh, no.

01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:06.300
Wait, does my staff of golden rage give rage to other things?

01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:09.300
Golden rage, yeah.

01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:11.300

All right.
