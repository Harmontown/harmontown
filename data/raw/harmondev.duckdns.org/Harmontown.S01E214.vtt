{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:08.000\nThere is a ghost who lives in Harmontown\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:14.000\nFrom just for last 42 in Toronto, Ontario\n\n00:14.000 --> 00:27.000\nI'm very, very, very honoured to say that Harmontown is now officially in session\n\n00:27.000 --> 00:36.000\nSpencer Crittenden, everybody\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:46.000\nOh, yeah\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:48.000\nOh, yeah\n\n00:48.000 --> 00:52.000\nI hope you saw his histogram today of him in his underwear in his hotel room\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:58.000\nBecause I have been pleasuring myself to that all afternoon\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:03.000\nLet's hear from the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:13.000\nThere is a ghost who lives in Harmontown\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:19.000\nDeserved, deserved, earned\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:28.000\nEarned every ounce of it, earned it\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:29.000\nThank you\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:31.000\nI believe you\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:33.000\nI believe you\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:37.000\nThank you\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:41.000\nThese are some Harmon star... Where'd he go?\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:46.000\nThese are some Harmon star motherfuckers, is what I was going to say\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:48.000\nThank you, Toronto\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:52.000\nWhere's Phillip, the guy that ran me down on the street walking here? Phillip, are you here?\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:53.000\nHello\n\n01:53.000 --> 02:04.000\nI had dinner at a little small Italian joint in a kind of industrial underlit kind of wasteland area across the highway here\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:08.000\nAnd a dude just came running up and slapped me on the shoulders\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:13.000\nAnd as far as I was concerned, that was the last thing that was going to happen in my life\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:15.000\nI don't think they understand\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:18.000\nThey're not aliens here, but they definitely don't\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:26.000\nA guy, Howard, that was interviewing me for advice today, quoted Tom Sharpling, which I'll now try to re-quote thereby\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:35.000\nI'll paraphrase and fuck up his quote, but something akin to Toronto is New York with the upper 10% and the bottom 5% cutoff\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:41.000\nSo it's like a middle-class Valhalla\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:46.000\nWhich makes for terrible customer service\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:50.000\nBecause you guys don't have that terror, there's no King's Landing\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:54.000\nThere's no Lannister that will always pay his debts\n\n02:54.000 --> 03:02.000\nSo why would two oat farmers take less than an hour giving each other oat?\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:06.000\nThere's a slight air of go fuck yourself\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:13.000\nTo the extent that you drag in a very American sense of entitlement, which I didn't know I had until I came to Toronto\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:18.000\nThe service here is Canadian, all of Canada has Canadian service\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:24.000\nWe're used to like, bring me my, I said butter, like five minutes ago\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:29.000\nBut in Montreal it's kind of like, it's a little more laid back, you're like, oh maybe they're just sleepy\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:30.000\nThey're just pretending to be...\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:35.000\nToronto, they're getting shit done, they're just like, no, for real, go fuck yourself\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:39.000\nI have it on my day planner, go fuck yourself between 11 and 3\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:46.000\nI do have stuff to do, I'm fully awake, I'm on wheat grass and I just flew a kite\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:52.000\nI was at the hockey museum for breakfast, I'm doing things, I'm meeting people\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:57.000\nThe hockey museum breakfast is one of the best breakfasts in Ontario\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:00.000\nIt's just Toronto being obnoxious about how good their food is\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:03.000\nThey're like, come to the hockey museum, it's better than anything you've ever eaten\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:07.000\nThey put pee meal on everything\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:11.000\nThey probably have good coleslaw at strip clubs here\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:16.000\nI've eaten, I'm going to puke delicious food all over everyone in a second\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:18.000\nIf I don't, it's only because...\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:21.000\nOh yeah, Dan was asking, Dan had a little tummy trouble, does anyone have chums here?\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:23.000\nIs that weird to ask the audience for chums?\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:28.000\nI said, if the Harmontown audience doesn't have chums, then no audience has chums\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:30.000\nYeah, there's someone on the front\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:31.000\nSecond row?\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:33.000\nOh, someone's running\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:35.000\nRight, okay\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:37.000\nOh no\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:43.000\nOh\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:48.000\nWow, wait, are you from America?\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:53.000\nThis is Canadian tongue, also it's in French, so it's...\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:56.000\nLe tube?\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:59.000\nOkay, calcium and acid\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:03.000\nYeah, I'll just, this will get me going just fine\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:05.000\nI'll do a stage dive and a wrap and we're done\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:11.000\nWe're talking about my...\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:13.000\nYou want to keep us on stage or hand them back to this guy?\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:15.000\nStole this guy's shit\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:17.000\nAlso, I'm not throwing them\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:20.000\nThat's a very large order of antacid to bring to a shop\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:23.000\nThat's the full bottle\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:26.000\nWould you care to come up and explain why you have so many?\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:31.000\nAnd here's yours\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:33.000\nI'm sure here, I take them\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:36.000\nYou're more honored to think that I have them with me\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:38.000\nThan to have them back and be like\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:41.000\nHello?\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:42.000\nHow are you doing?\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nGrab a mic from behind there\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:46.000\nHere, grab one of those, they're wireless\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:47.000\nHey, how are you doing?\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:48.000\nOh, hi\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:49.000\nWhat's your name?\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:50.000\nJeff\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:51.000\nJeff, why so many chums?\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:53.000\nProbably propensity for red wine\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:54.000\nOh, so just...\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:55.000\nJust eat too much...\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:58.000\nTanic acid and fried bullshit\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:01.000\nI mean, you left your house with a safe\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:04.000\nI mean, you don't know what's going to happen during your day\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:06.000\nI know what's not going to happen\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:10.000\nYou're not going to have that much acid in your body\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:13.000\nBetween now and 2020\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:17.000\nYou're also not going to walk through a limousine like a Mentos commercial\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:20.000\nAnd get laid afterwards\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:24.000\nYou were wearing jeans and a shirt\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:27.000\nWas that in your pocket or did you carry that around?\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:28.000\nIt was like a...\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:31.000\nNo, yeah, I feel like a kid with me whenever I need to\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:32.000\nSatchel?\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:33.000\nI do, yeah\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:34.000\nOkay, you came with a...\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:35.000\nA Canadian satchel?\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:36.000\nThat's right\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:37.000\nYeah\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:41.000\nAll writers in LA could move up to Canada and we'd blend right in\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:42.000\nAbsolutely, yeah\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:44.000\nThe satchel, guys\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:48.000\nWell, you're up here, what do you do?\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:49.000\nLet's plug your album\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:52.000\nYour soundcloud\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:54.000\nI don't currently have one\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:57.000\nBut no, I'm a promo producer for the Comedy Network\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:01.000\nThat's how you got those good seats and why you need all that antacid\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:03.000\nYou would think so, but...\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:05.000\nThe brutal Canadian TV industry\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:10.000\nWhere everyone's such an asshole at throwing their apologies across the room at each other\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:14.000\nAlright, well, I already forgot your name\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:15.000\nJeff\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:16.000\nHow could you forget?\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:17.000\nRight?\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:18.000\nYou have your own\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:21.000\nThat's why I take it for granted\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:24.000\nWould you agree with me on this? We have the most boring name in the world, don't we?\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:25.000\nJeff is boring\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:27.000\nFor the most part, but mine's a G, Jeff\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.000\nSo I get people angry at me every time they try to write it\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:31.000\nActually, who cares, never mind\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:33.000\nYeah, but that's at least a little more interesting\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:36.000\nThat's more of the British Commonwealth\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:37.000\nYeah\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:39.000\nThe British G there, eh?\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:43.000\nJimmy Pardo once kicked me off the stage for having a G in my name\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:44.000\nJimmy Pardo?\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:45.000\nYeah\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:46.000\nHe was in town doing a show\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:48.000\nHe spells his name with G, too\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:50.000\nG...\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:51.000\nJimmy Pardo?\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:53.000\nIt looks like Jimmy Pardo\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:56.000\nI think it's so amazing how loyal you guys are to kids in the hall\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.000\nThere's still that picture of Scott Thompson doing...\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:07.000\nEvery bar has a picture of Scott Thompson doing that old lady character on the wall\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:09.000\nWith the tiara and the dress\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nOh, that's your queen\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:15.000\nQueen buddy\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:18.000\nThis is what I was getting at, someone shouted out\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:20.000\nBut you guys are so friendly\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:25.000\nYou're like, three applause breaks into that dumb joke\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:28.000\nBecause you're like, yes, we do support our local...\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:29.000\nWe are wonderful\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:32.000\nWe are in the Queen Elizabeth Theater as we stand\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nAnd I just called her a dude\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nIs she with us?\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:41.000\nShe just turned 140 the other day\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:44.000\nDid she have a successor?\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:47.000\nAre you guys still doing the royalty thing?\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:49.000\nShe has a son that she is going to see to it\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:52.000\nShe will die before he ever gets near the throne\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:53.000\nOr she won't die, actually, I guess\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.000\nShe'll have him destroyed\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:56.000\nPrince Charles will never...\n\n08:56.000 --> 09:00.000\nPrince Charles is old as two kings got stacked together\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:03.000\nAnd she's like, nope, crown his mind, you will never get it\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:06.000\nIt's so confusing, it's the same names as the British people\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:11.000\nBut you guys are...\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:13.000\nHow are you supposed to tell her?\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nWait, yes, that's right, go on\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:19.000\nThey're Canadian Queen, it's like...\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:21.000\nShe looks just like the British Queen\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:24.000\nAnd now I'm learning she has a prince, the same name as the...\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:28.000\nThe English one that we still have some level of allegiance to\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:30.000\nWe put her on the money\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:32.000\nThey're a sovereign nation here in Canada\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:35.000\nBut they still have some weird Commonwealth affection\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.000\nWith the United Kingdom\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:38.000\nGovernor General and stuff\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:40.000\nAnd the Lieutenant General that answers to her\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nBut doesn't actually, but does, but doesn't\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:45.000\nGonna get corrected all sorts of times\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:48.000\nWell, five years ago we would have been all a judge\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:51.000\nWe're gonna have had all kinds of fun to poke at\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\nHow you run the things everywhere\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:55.000\nJust...\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:57.000\nYou know that Justin Trudeau\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:01.000\nThe creator of Bloom County\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.000\nWait, no, I'm sorry\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:05.000\nIt's very...\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nEven my joke is ill-informed\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:10.000\nCreators, deep balance\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:13.000\nI had to wickipedia my dumb joke\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:15.000\nNo, Burke breathed\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:18.000\nAnyways, what about Trudeau?\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:20.000\nJeff, what you don't know is that Dan\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:22.000\nBefore he travels to another country\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:24.000\nHe does intensive research\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:26.000\nI looked at a map and I was like\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:30.000\nOh, I will entertain them by saying\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:33.000\nToronto is Canada's tea bag\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:37.000\nBecause it kind of dips into us\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nThe Dick Halo move\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:42.000\nWhen you look at the map, it's the...\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:45.000\nIt's your balls, like, dipping into our...\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:47.000\nInto our...\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:48.000\nInto our fresh water\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:50.000\nIt's a lot of land mass\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:53.000\nIt's their water\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:57.000\nOh, my God\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:59.000\nOh, my God\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.000\nOh, Canada\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:03.000\nI love how sci-fi this is\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:05.000\nIt's our water, they're yelling\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:07.000\nIt's our water\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:11.000\nTwo men enter, one man leaves\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nLet them give the people the air\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:17.000\nLet's hear it for Anastasia Jeff, everybody\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:19.000\nAnastasia Jeff\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:21.000\nAnastasia Jeff, here, take your...\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:23.000\nSee for the tunes\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:27.000\nIt's a lot of... It's a lot of times, Jeff\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:30.000\nBoy, who's sitting next to that guy?\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:33.000\nThat was a... That was a classic...\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nWell, this is white male\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:37.000\nCentric thinking\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:39.000\nThat was a classic Torontonian\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:42.000\nI'm sure the face of the modern Toronto is...\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:44.000\nYou know, would be offended by me\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:46.000\nImplying that with my...\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:50.000\nBut I'm like, that's a Torontonian, like, clip art image\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:52.000\nIs Jeff, he was...\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nHe had like a flannel shirt, basically\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:56.000\nBut it was like modern, like it was like...\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:57.000\nI gotta say...\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nIt's like a vestige, like it's like a Marvel...\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:02.000\nMarvel did like a new Toronto series\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:04.000\nLike, it's like...\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:06.000\nHis character in the 40s was a lumberjack\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:09.000\nThat threw hologram axes\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:12.000\nBut now he's just like a dude\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:15.000\nHe takes selfies and...\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:16.000\nBut he still has...\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:19.000\nHe still had to incorporate the flannel into the...\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nBut now he runs a comedy network\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:25.000\nAnd it's not... It's not doing well in his tum tum\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:28.000\nAlright, we should check in with Spencer\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:32.000\nNo, no, no, thank you, thank you\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:36.000\nNo need for any of that\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:39.000\nI was worried I wouldn't have anything to talk about\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.000\nBut they're so nice, they just go like\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:43.000\nI like hot dogs and they're like, yay!\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.000\nAnd it's like, this show's in the bag\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:49.000\nBut talk to us about Toronto\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:50.000\nGive us some impressions\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:52.000\nOh man, okay\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:55.000\nI don't know, I got here, I took a lift\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nNo, I took an Uber over here\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nAnd there's this driveway outside\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nAnd I wanted the guy to pull into the driveway\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:03.000\nBut he stopped just on the street\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:05.000\nAnd when he stopped just on the street\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:07.000\nSomeone got into the car\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:08.000\nA woman\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:11.000\nAnd this is a weird thing that happens\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:13.000\nSometimes you hail Ubers\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:15.000\nOr sometimes someone thinks they're the Uber\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:16.000\nAnd they're not or whatever\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:17.000\nThis stuff happens\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nBut she got in the car and I was like\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:23.000\nI saw his phone, it didn't pick anyone else up\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nI don't think you hailed anyone, right?\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:27.000\nAnd the taxi guy's like, no\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:29.000\nNo, I did not\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:30.000\nAnd I was like, yeah\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:33.000\nAnd the woman just, I don't know\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:36.000\nShe said something, but I couldn't really understand her\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:38.000\nSo it was great\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:42.000\nAnd then I was like, did you hail an Uber?\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:44.000\nDid you call for an Uber?\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:47.000\nAnd she was like, no\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:49.000\nYou said she said something like\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:51.000\nIt's fun to make friends\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:52.000\nWhen she entered the car\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:54.000\nShe opened the door and getting into the car\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:56.000\nShe was like, it's great to make new friends\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:58.000\nYeah, and I believe\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:01.000\nWhat we're piecing together here is like\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:04.000\nTo put an agenda\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:08.000\nAre you sure she wasn't like a sex worker?\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:10.000\nI'm pretty sure\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:12.000\nI haven't done my research, but I think it's like\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:14.000\nYou cut off the top 10% of New York\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:16.000\nThe bottom 95% of the guns\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nI think, because otherwise\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:20.000\nWhy would people behave this way?\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:24.000\nLike we come from a land of high anxiety\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:28.000\nLike where every conversation could be your last\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:30.000\nAnd they're just a little more\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:32.000\nI'm gonna bound up to you\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:35.000\nBut isn't Toronto, I heard from a driver coming in\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:39.000\nThat Toronto violence is kind of on the upswing here\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nYou can do it\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:45.000\nIsn't it traditionally though\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:48.000\nHas it been renowned as a pretty crime-free place?\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:51.000\nThis is the Niagara Falls place, right?\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:53.000\nThis is the place we share Niagara Falls with\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nHalf our water\n\n14:58.000 --> 14:59.000\nNo\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:00.000\nI mean, if you go to Niagara Falls\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:02.000\nThe fun side is the Canadian side\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:08.000\nAlthough, that burger came with the big Frankenstein on top\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:10.000\nThat's fucked up\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:12.000\nYou guys could class it up a little bit\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:15.000\nThe hotels look like 70s porn hotels\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:18.000\nLike put a nice hotel in\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:20.000\nJesus, the most beautiful vista in the world\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:22.000\nAnd the hotel is skeevy as shit\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:26.000\nYou could also be a little less diligent with the shot thing\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:28.000\nLike the measurements of the shots\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:32.000\nIf someone orders a vodka on the rocks\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:36.000\nYou're allowed to just eyeball it\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:39.000\nBut maybe you've cleaned it all up\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nI mean, maybe your way is the best way\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:43.000\nIs that a British Commonwealth thing?\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.000\nBecause in the UK, same thing\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:46.000\nYou get that dram\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:47.000\nWell, we had this argument in text\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:49.000\nIt's technically an everywhere thing\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:52.000\nBut only in airports and in Toronto\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:55.000\nAre they so exacting\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nAnd just like uncompromising\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nLike they never let up\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:02.000\nJust like, I've tipped you a thousand dollars\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:05.000\nLike, I'm buying you a chalet\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nLike, will you let capitalism\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:10.000\nInto your cold black communist heart\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:13.000\nAnd fucking overpour?\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:16.000\nI want to enslave you\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:19.000\nYou're working for me, not your owner\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:22.000\nI'm taking you from him, poor old bunch\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:25.000\nYou'll make more money\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:27.000\nThey don't get it\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:28.000\nThey don't know how happy they'll be\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:30.000\nIf they just go down our path\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:32.000\nBut also, somehow there's still\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\nA load of alcoholics in Canada\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:36.000\nHow do you guys do it here?\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:38.000\nDo you have to be wealthy or just drink beer?\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:42.000\nPractice!\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:44.000\nI think it's because it's just so\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:46.000\nIt's so geometric for them\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nIt's more efficient\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:50.000\nThey're just like, I've calculated exactly\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nHow drunk I'm going to get\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:55.000\nI don't know, because I have to do this thing\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:57.000\nI don't want to draw attention to myself\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nI pointed at a...\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nAfter a while of going, can I have a double?\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:03.000\nOr at a triple?\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nLike, this is silly\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nI should be able to tell the difference\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:10.000\nBetween what I ordered and the melted ice\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:11.000\nOh, shit\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nMeanwhile, again, a gentleman...\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:15.000\nCanadian vodka\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:17.000\nCanadian vodka is being delivered to the stage\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:19.000\nHooray!\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:21.000\nThank you\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:23.000\nI hope he brought it up for 1,250 people\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\nOh, wait, look at this\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:29.000\nWhat is going on here?\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\nHe hates Dijon mustard, this guy\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nWhat is happening?\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:35.000\nOh, there's a tie\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:37.000\nThis I love\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.000\nThis is going on right away\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:45.000\nOh, shit\n\n17:45.000 --> 18:01.000\nOh, shit\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:03.000\nIs this 43?\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:07.000\nI don't know what that means\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nThis tie is for a baby\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:13.000\nThat is the precise unit of tie\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:15.000\nThat you are allowed when you order a tie\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nI guess...\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:19.000\nWith the exchange rate\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nThis is how long a Canadian tie is\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:23.000\nThis is never going to fucking work\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:25.000\nThis is going to be a...\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nThank you so much\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:33.000\nI'll be here soon\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nI'll be here one election from now\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:39.000\nMy little baby tie\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:41.000\nWhy don't we bring out our good friends\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:43.000\nthat were already here\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:49.000\nI know them from friendship\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:51.000\nand stuff and their podcast, The Indoor Kids\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:57.000\nBut you and the rest of the world\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:59.000\njust know them from all over\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:01.000\nThey're now wrapping up their hit show\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:03.000\nThe Meltdown\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:05.000\nThey...\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:07.000\nI don't have to introduce them\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:09.000\nOkay\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:27.000\nHello\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:29.000\nIf someone else joins us, I'll give them my stool\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:31.000\nHello\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:33.000\nI brought a chair because I'm wearing a short skirt\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:35.000\nand these tall stools are not...\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:37.000\nNo, no, no, no\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nBut thank you\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:41.000\nSo I brought a chair\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:43.000\nHey Emily, I was here earlier\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.000\nI loved your hour set before we came on\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:47.000\nI did a great job, didn't I?\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:49.000\nI did some of my new stuff\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:51.000\nA lot of ethnic material\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:53.000\nCamille, you were just out here doing an hour long show?\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:55.000\nYeah\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:57.000\nWas anyone at that show?\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:59.000\nOh wow\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:03.000\nIs the Adderall flowing freely here?\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:05.000\nIs that how you guys have this energy?\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:07.000\nToss them this way\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:09.000\nIt's all the poutine\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:11.000\nIt's like socialized medicine\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:13.000\nand everyone has ADD\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:15.000\nIt's really crazy\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:17.000\nI was doing my show\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:19.000\nand I'm a grown up\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:21.000\nand I am a grown up\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:23.000\nand I found out one of my cousins was in the audience\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:25.000\nand it really freaked me out\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:29.000\nI'm picturing like your hot female cousin\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:31.000\nwhich is played by you and a wig\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:33.000\nYeah, same beard\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:37.000\nI'm always picturing that by the way\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:41.000\nI'm always picturing you and a wig\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:43.000\nLike when the gremlin wears a wig\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:45.000\nA lady gremlin\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:47.000\nLike that, but for me\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:49.000\nChumalia\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:51.000\nActually, Camille\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:53.000\nsounds kind of like a female name\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:55.000\neven where I'm from\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:57.000\nCome on, get out\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:59.000\nCamille is a female name\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:01.000\nand Camille\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:03.000\nK-U-M-A-L\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:05.000\nK-A-M-A\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:07.000\nNonsense\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:09.000\nThat's so racist\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:13.000\nSince we're being racist, can I ask you\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:17.000\nI won't have this chance\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.000\nbecause I swear I don't\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:21.000\nI can't even go and make an ass of myself\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:23.000\nbut I swear\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:25.000\nThis is a safe space\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:29.000\nIt's a safe space for racism\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:31.000\nI know this is going to sound\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:33.000\nlike a bit\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:35.000\nI know that I'm stupid and I know\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nI'm just committing to my midwestern\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:39.000\nI don't understand\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:41.000\nBuddy, just ask\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:43.000\nMy Uber driver\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:45.000\nFuck you\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:47.000\nI\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:55.000\nIt's perfect\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:57.000\nIt's the modern who's on first\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:59.000\nI think that, yeah\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:01.000\nThe answer is no\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:03.000\nThe answer is no\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:05.000\nHassan first\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:07.000\nHis name is Muhammad\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:09.000\nIt's a common name, Muhammad\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:11.000\nThere's a bunch of people named Muhammad\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:13.000\nAre you telling me or asking me\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:15.000\nWell, you could correct me if I'm wrong\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:17.000\nIt's not a unique name\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:19.000\nIt's not like a crazy name\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:21.000\nIt's like John or something\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:23.000\nIt's very common\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:25.000\nCorrect\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:27.000\nWhen we talk about the whole\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:29.000\nOh, you made a cartoon\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:31.000\nWe had a thing called Graven Image\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:33.000\nand all this stuff\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:35.000\nWhy can his name be Muhammad\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:37.000\nIf it's like that\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:39.000\nThat actually is a good question\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:41.000\nIf his name is Muhammad\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:43.000\nIf he's born with the exact face\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:45.000\nof Prophet Muhammad\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:47.000\nThen that's a horrible crime\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:49.000\nOr the face\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:51.000\nthat Trey Parker and Matt Stone\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:53.000\nwould have drawn\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:55.000\nThat's also bad\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:57.000\nYeah, if it's fully 2D\n\n22:57.000 --> 22:59.000\nBut I guess that's the\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:01.000\nAsperger part of my question\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:03.000\nHow do we know that's the whole point\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:05.000\nI would think the whole point against\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:07.000\nThe\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:09.000\ndepiction thing would be\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:11.000\nThat's not supposed to be known\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.000\nThat's not supposed to be defiled\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:15.000\nWith\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:17.000\nDepictions and things and mimicry\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:19.000\nAnd so why\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:21.000\nBut then a human being\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:23.000\nBut I guess that's the same you see\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:25.000\nEverybody named Jesus\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:27.000\nIt's like, whoa, your mom's like super Catholic\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:29.000\nBut my mom would slap me\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:31.000\nIf I dropped a dish and said Jesus\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:33.000\nBut you name your kid Jesus\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:35.000\nBut the difference is\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:37.000\nYou can draw Jesus and be fine\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:39.000\nThat's true\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:41.000\nDo you want to draw Muhammad right now\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:43.000\nSee\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:45.000\nI don't think so\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:47.000\nThat's an interesting point\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:49.000\nAnd I've never thought about it\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:51.000\nWhy are people allowed to be called Muhammad\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:53.000\nBut then you're not allowed to draw his face\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:55.000\nAnd also when you're drawing his face\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:57.000\nHow do you know exactly\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:59.000\nWhat that guy looks like\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:01.000\nBecause every Muslim is\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:03.000\nBorn a priori\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:05.000\nWith the knowledge of Muhammad's face\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:07.000\nIn their head\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:09.000\nAnd we can all compare it\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:11.000\nBut you can't explain it to white people\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:13.000\nWe can't explain it\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:15.000\nBut if someone draws a picture of Muhammad\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:17.000\nWe look and we're like that's not close enough\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:19.000\nYou're fine\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:21.000\nSo you're punished for being\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nA really good caricaturist\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:25.000\nYou can do a caricature\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:27.000\nJust don't be photorealistic\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:29.000\nI couldn't do Muhammad like right\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:31.000\nIn a skateboard and like\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:33.000\nThat's what I want to surfboard in one arm\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:35.000\nBut you can only do it if his head\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:37.000\nIs at least the size of his body\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nIf the proportions are\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:41.000\nBiologically accurate\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:43.000\nYou're fucked\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:45.000\nWalter Lance explains this\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:47.000\nDo you think that kids born\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:49.000\nNamed Muhammad\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:51.000\nFeel like an extra sense of duty\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:53.000\nTo be like more good\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:55.000\nI mean it's a hell\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:57.000\nOf a thing to have to live up to\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:59.000\nWhat if your name is Muhammad\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:01.000\nYou're a young Muslim\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:03.000\nYou're a kid and you go to Disneyland\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.000\nAnd you get a caricature and like\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:07.000\nMy name is Muhammad\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:09.000\nThese are the questions\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:11.000\nThat are going to get us killed before\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:13.000\nBefore we're done\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:15.000\nWhat price?\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.000\n$15\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:19.000\n$15\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:21.000\nWow\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:23.000\nOr is that a xenophobic thing to say\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:25.000\nThese are questions that are going to get us killed\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:27.000\nThat's contributing to a syndrome\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:29.000\nI think we've done more things that would get us killed\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:31.000\nDisagree\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:33.000\nHard disagree\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:35.000\nLike nice Lutheran girls named Mary\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:37.000\nDon't feel compelled to either be a virgin\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:39.000\nOr fuck God\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:41.000\nThey don't feel any extra pressure\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:43.000\nI don't think\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:45.000\nThat's true\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:47.000\nAnd I've never talked to anybody named Jesus\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:49.000\nAbout whether or not they feel an extra mantle\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:51.000\nOf growing out their hair\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:53.000\nOr wearing a lot of robes\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:55.000\nAlright\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:57.000\nWell that concludes my Islamic questions\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:59.000\nYou don't have any more?\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:01.000\nThat was it?\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:03.000\nOh I'm sorry\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:05.000\nI have an unquenchable empty\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:07.000\nChalice\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:09.000\nI'm in an open book right now\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:11.000\nI won't tell you more secrets\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:13.000\nWhat's your feeling?\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:15.000\nI do have one\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:17.000\nDo you have the equivalent of a bar mitzvah?\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:19.000\nOh\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:21.000\nI'm saying you, he was raised Muslim\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:23.000\nHe's not your personal private business\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:25.000\nWhether you're secular or whatever\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:27.000\nBut you were raised in a\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:29.000\nWe don't have a ceremony like that\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:31.000\nWhere you go from being a kid to an adult\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:33.000\nThat's like, we don't have that\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:35.000\nChristians have confirmation\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:37.000\nThen you have the bar mitzvah\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:39.000\nThat's 13, the bat mitzvah\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:41.000\nWhich I'm told is pronounced bat mitzvah\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:43.000\nYeah it's bat mitzvah\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nIt's Bruce Wein\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:49.000\nLater\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:51.000\nWhat am I leaving out?\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:53.000\nBruce Weinstein\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:55.000\nI think Wiccans have a thing\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:57.000\nWhen you turn 13\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:59.000\nIt's called the twisted root\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:01.000\nOf Hades\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:03.000\nWell I also feel like, that's a fun one\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:05.000\nI've been to one of those\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:07.000\nI feel like women have, naturally have\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:09.000\nMenarch\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:11.000\nThat's like a very obvious\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:13.000\nBefore and after\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:15.000\nThat I don't think we celebrate enough, we should\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:17.000\nI was pandering a little bit\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:19.000\nBut it's okay\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:21.000\nBut boys, we don't have\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:23.000\nAn equivalent of that\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:25.000\nBecause most Christians don't\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:27.000\nA lot of Christians I know don't have confirmation\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:29.000\nI think boys need a boys to mend\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:31.000\nI think they need like a ceremony\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:33.000\nIt's so hard to say goodbye\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:35.000\nWell yeah\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:37.000\nWe spread it all out\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:39.000\nAnd I think that's about state control\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:41.000\nI think that the\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:43.000\nAxis of power between fathers and sons\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:45.000\nIs such\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:47.000\nNon-governmental power\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:49.000\nYou guys are free to leave right now if you want\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:51.000\nAm I?\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:53.000\nI think they want us spreading it between\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.000\nI get drunk on prom night\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:57.000\nI wrestle with you on the kitchen floor\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:59.000\nBut not really\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:01.000\nIt doesn't end with someone being circumcised\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:03.000\nNot if you do it right\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:05.000\nIsn't it capitalism?\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:07.000\nCapitalism wants everyone to be babies\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:09.000\nBut that's different than state control\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:11.000\nWe come from a capitalist state\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:13.000\nIt's a big\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:15.000\nBall of money that says\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:17.000\nIn God we trust on it\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:19.000\nIt's like it wants you sucking on\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:21.000\nThat titty for your entire life\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:23.000\nAnd then it wants to just tell you\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:25.000\nThat being old cost money\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:27.000\nAnd then it just watches you die\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:29.000\nAnd meanwhile it tells your kids\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:31.000\nOh you're millennials you hate old people\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:33.000\nThey're like we do\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:35.000\nAnd they told the old people\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:37.000\nYou know what really matters? Race\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:39.000\nAnd then they tell the kids\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:41.000\nYou know what matters? Racism\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nAnd then they tell the next generation\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:45.000\nYou know what matters? Kind of race\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nAnd then everyone's like\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:49.000\nHow come every 30 years\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:51.000\nWe just told that we all hate each other\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:53.000\nIt's all money\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:55.000\nBecause they don't want\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:57.000\nIn that same vein don't you think that\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:59.000\nCapitalists wouldn't we then have more\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:01.000\nOh it's your\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:03.000\nThey want to market curries and cards\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:05.000\nAnd yeah exactly\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:07.000\nThat's just the innocent face\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:09.000\nThat's what you're able to trace\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:11.000\nYou'd think we'd have 11 Zs\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:13.000\nAnd you're turning 12 Ramas\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:15.000\nYou know\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:17.000\nThey sound like the creepiest uncle\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:19.000\nIn the world right now\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:21.000\nCome in my van for a 12 Ramas\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:27.000\nCause I think like first wet dream\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:29.000\nFor a young man should be like\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:31.000\nA celebrate\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:33.000\nI haven't gotten a wet dream\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:35.000\nI've never had a wet dream\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:37.000\nIf you did a preemptive strike\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:39.000\nIf you know what I mean\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:41.000\nThen you don't get a wet dream\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:43.000\nOh that's a bummer\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:45.000\nLet's say I go for weeks\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:47.000\nAnd I don't do any preemptive strikes\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:49.000\nI've never woken up\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:51.000\nThere's no way you've gotten weeks\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:55.000\nI mean look at you\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:01.000\nLook at you, you clearly jerk off a lot\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:09.000\nI've dreamt about\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:11.000\nSex\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:13.000\nComing and I've never come\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:15.000\nI did\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:19.000\nEverything okay?\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:21.000\nDid someone just fucking jerk off all over you dude\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:23.000\nIn my sleep\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:25.000\nI felt like I heard the guy\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:27.000\nI processed that in my brain\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:29.000\nIt's just ogre from revenge of the nerds\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:31.000\nI thought it just yelled ogre\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:33.000\nI pictured the mountains from Game of Thrones\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:35.000\nOh okay\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:37.000\nHere's a little piece of cultural\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:39.000\nWhat dreams were there\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:41.000\nWell I had one in my adulthood\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:43.000\nI can't remember what I was dreaming of\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:45.000\nBut I remember I did actually\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:47.000\nFinally after years of reading about it\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:49.000\nIn these textbooks and having your\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:51.000\nYour gym teacher tell you about it\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:53.000\nThat I had\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:55.000\nI was like holy shit I came in my sleep\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:57.000\nWait when was this how long ago\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:59.000\nI was like in my 30s\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\nYou didn't do it as a kid though\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:03.000\nNo never\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:05.000\nThere wasn't anything available\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:07.000\nFor a whole time job\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:09.000\nI just never turned back\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:11.000\nOne day Pam Gauber\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:13.000\nLooked different and working\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:15.000\nMindy reruns and\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:17.000\nThe next day every pillow\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:19.000\nIn my mom's apartment was a target\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:21.000\nThere wasn't a surface\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:23.000\nThere wasn't a fabric\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:25.000\nSwatch\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:27.000\nThat wasn't fucking just\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:29.000\nJust humped\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:31.000\nAt first dry\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:33.000\nBecause nothing even before anything was coming out\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:35.000\nI've talked about this before\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:37.000\nWait Camille\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:39.000\nCamille have you had wet dreams\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:41.000\nNo\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:43.000\nI always did preemptive strikes\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nAnd\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:47.000\nI actually\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:49.000\nWhile my cousin was here in the show\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:51.000\nRight before it\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:53.000\nI told a 10 minute long story about\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.000\nWhen I first started masturbating\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.000\nAnd I'll tell you the part that I didn't say\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nBecause he was here\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:01.000\nDirectors cut\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:03.000\nIs not there here\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:05.000\nHe wouldn't say it if he was\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:07.000\nHe's gone\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:09.000\nThe part I didn't\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:11.000\nI talked about the first time I masturbated\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:13.000\nAnd how I blacked out and came to\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\nAre you stinking\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\nI blacked out\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:19.000\nI had masturbated and you came to\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nYou came also\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nReally good\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nI closed my eyes a boy\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:29.000\nAnd I opened up a man\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:31.000\nAnd I blacked out\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:33.000\nYou must have come 7 or 8\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:35.000\nOkay\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:37.000\nI literally\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:39.000\nThe part I did mention is that\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:41.000\nI had a very conservative Muslim\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:43.000\nUpbringing so I was like when I first came\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:45.000\nMy body\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:47.000\nWhen I first masturbated my body was like\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:49.000\nHad been waiting so long\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:51.000\nThat when I came to I swear this is completely true\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:53.000\nI found out\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:55.000\nThat I had\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.000\nThis is true I had hit the ceiling\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:59.000\nNo\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:01.000\nNo\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:03.000\nDon't\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:05.000\nDon't leave her hanging\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:09.000\nI swear\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:11.000\nYou're a man now\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:13.000\nNow\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:17.000\nI swear I woke up\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:19.000\nAnd I saw my Muslim repression\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.000\nDripping from the ceiling\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:23.000\nWait how\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:25.000\nI swear\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:27.000\nThat's maybe 5 feet\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:29.000\nRight\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:31.000\nAre you being racist about the height of\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:33.000\nPakistani ceilings\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:35.000\nEveryone knows you people sleep on the floor\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:39.000\nIf the average ceiling is 8 feet\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:41.000\nI'm pushing the average size ceiling\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:43.000\nAnd you're sitting on a toilet\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:45.000\nCause he's in the bathroom this part I know\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:47.000\nSo you're sitting on a toilet that's\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:49.000\nSo I'm even lower dude\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:51.000\nI'm hitting the ceiling from this height\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:53.000\nSitting down\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:55.000\nI swear\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:57.000\nI remember I had to stand on top\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:59.000\nOf the toilet to like\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:01.000\nWipe it\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:03.000\nHow old were you?\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:05.000\nI was probably like 11\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:07.000\nAnd I thought that this is how it always is\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:09.000\nI didn't do it\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:11.000\nI would like close my eyes and look away\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:13.000\nBut I've never been able to\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:15.000\nReplicate the results\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:17.000\nIt dribbles out like a broken\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:23.000\nWhy are you faithful?\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:25.000\nI find that incredibly remarkable\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:27.000\nIt's really something\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:29.000\nListen so did I\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:31.000\nWhy do you think it is that men\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:33.000\nI guess the answer\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:35.000\nIs in the question I don't know\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:37.000\nWhy would we want to\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:39.000\nThere's ads for pills you can take\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:41.000\nThat make you\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:43.000\nMake there be more\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:45.000\nMake it gush\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:47.000\nIt's enough\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:49.000\nIt's over the size thing\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:51.000\nThat doesn't make any sense\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:53.000\nLogically\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:55.000\nFunny that we also\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:57.000\nPlus everybody wants to\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:59.000\nIt's just kind of funny\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:01.000\nAnd I will say speaking for women\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:03.000\nFor those men who are fucking women\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:05.000\nWe don't want that\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:07.000\nYou're not looking for geysers\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:09.000\nNo\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:11.000\nWomen are so good at\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:13.000\nI don't want to say women\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:15.000\nAre good at anything\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:17.000\nWow\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:19.000\nThat came out wrong\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:21.000\nNo, that is so\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:23.000\nFeminist\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:25.000\nMr. Trump, my next question\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:27.000\nThat is truly so feminist of you\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:29.000\nI'm such a feminist\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:31.000\nI don't want to say women are good at anything\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:33.000\nDan, thank you\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:35.000\nThere's a fine line\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:37.000\nFinally somebody has the courage\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:39.000\nI'm a master of all worlds\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:41.000\nI didn't want to make a sweeping statement about women\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:43.000\nWomen are so good\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:45.000\nAnd men are so fragile\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:47.000\nWomen are so good at\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:49.000\nIntuiting\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:51.000\nI think that\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:53.000\nMen think\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:55.000\nAll men have experienced\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.000\nMaybe a woman saying\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nThat's a lot\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:01.000\nAnd spinning it\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:03.000\nAnd we've been like\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:05.000\nThat's good, huh?\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:07.000\nI feel like it must\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:09.000\nI feel like when there's not a lot\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:11.000\nOf what did you call it, Camel\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.000\nDribbles out like a broken water\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:15.000\nNo, no, no, you've been\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:17.000\nPreemptive strike, a lot of preemptive strikes\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:19.000\nPreemptive strikes\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:21.000\nI've always felt that there was a\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:23.000\nYou can actually get pregnant with a preemptive strike\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:25.000\nBecause there is some\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:27.000\nEmptive strike\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:29.000\nArguably more\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:31.000\nI read a thing that says\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:33.000\nBecause what you're doing\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:35.000\nIs you're getting rid of\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:39.000\nOverstock.com\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:41.000\nSo if you\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:43.000\nHave one of those special days\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nWhen you're like\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:47.000\nYou don't have any phone calls till two\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:49.000\nAnd\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:51.000\nYou're just\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:53.000\nGoing to town\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:55.000\nYou're arguably more fertile\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:57.000\nI thought I read something\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:59.000\nIt feels weird to be talking about this\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:01.000\nAnd have Emily be like two feet lower than us\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:03.000\nIt's tough to be a lady, guys\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:05.000\nWait, I'll say this\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:07.000\nWhen I was a\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:09.000\nYounger woman, I thought that a lot\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:11.000\nMeant that I was\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:13.000\nLike they were really like into me\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:15.000\nAnd then now I realize\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:17.000\nThat they just\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:19.000\nThey just haven't masturbated that recently\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:21.000\nNow I get that\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:23.000\nDo you think it also has a million\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:25.000\nLike variables, but do you think\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:27.000\nThat you got that impression from men\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:29.000\nLike do you think that a guy\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:31.000\nNo, I just feel like nobody ever\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:33.000\nLike no guy was ever like\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:35.000\nThat's for you, young lady\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:37.000\nBut I did think like\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:39.000\nThere's a little extra in there for you\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:41.000\nGet yourself something next\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:43.000\nLike\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:45.000\nLike a replica\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:47.000\nOf yourself that's half me\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:49.000\nGet yourself a nice baby\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:51.000\nDon't spread it all in one place\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:53.000\nA guy never\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:55.000\nNever made me feel that way, but I was like\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:57.000\nFor me, all this\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:59.000\nLike I did have that\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:01.000\nRight\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:05.000\nAll this, that\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:07.000\nActually makes sense\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:09.000\nYou feeling a weird amount of pride\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:11.000\nAbout the amount of\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:13.000\nAnd now I just realize it's meant that you've had\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:15.000\nPhone calls all day\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:17.000\nRight\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:19.000\nYeah, 90am conference call\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:21.000\nYeah\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:23.000\nThe\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:25.000\nOkay, so\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:27.000\nIf you're with a guy\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:29.000\nAnd he is a geyser\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:31.000\nThat's just a dude that has no phone calls\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:33.000\nIt could be a guy\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:35.000\nLots of phone calls\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:37.000\nA very busy man\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:39.000\nIt could be a guy that's very excited about\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:41.000\nYou\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:43.000\nNo, because if you just jerked off three times\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:45.000\nBefore she came over, it doesn't matter\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:47.000\nYou're still not going to\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:49.000\nMake a bunch of variables\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:51.000\nI don't want anyone listening to this\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:53.000\nI don't want anyone\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:55.000\nListening to this\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:57.000\nHahaha\n\n38:57.000 --> 38:59.000\nProbably the most water you've had too\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:01.000\nSorry\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:03.000\nWe'll find out in the year 2030 that it's like\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:05.000\nIt's Skittles\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:07.000\nYou know\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:09.000\nI was at a bar\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:11.000\nSuspend your disbelief\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:13.000\nI was at a bar\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:15.000\nAnd I ordered tequila\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:17.000\nWith pineapple juice\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:19.000\nAnd the bartender or the gal goes\n\n39:19.000 --> 39:21.000\nUh-huh\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:23.000\nAlright, yeah, that thing, yeah\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:25.000\nIt's sort of pineapple juice\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:27.000\nTrying to make your sperm taste good\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:29.000\nExactly\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:31.000\nI was in a\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:33.000\nAlso at a bar\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:35.000\nAnd as I was walking out\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:37.000\nA person\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:39.000\nKept yelling something\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:41.000\nIt started with an H\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:43.000\nAnd it was\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:45.000\nIt was not quite my name\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:47.000\nAnd it was like\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:49.000\nIt was so insistent and it kept getting yelled\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:51.000\nThat finally decided like\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:53.000\nBack over my shoulder\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:55.000\nAs I was turning\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:57.000\nMy eyes landed on the guy\n\n39:57.000 --> 39:59.000\nMy brain caught up\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:01.000\nAnd realized he was yelling hodor\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:03.000\nUh\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:05.000\nAnd then he was very much directing it at me\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:07.000\nOh\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:09.000\nAnd I looked at him\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:11.000\nAnd\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:13.000\nWas he being chased by a lot of white walkers?\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:15.000\nHe\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:17.000\nHe, I mean\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:19.000\nI've never, I haven't experienced\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:21.000\nReally taking it back\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:23.000\nI'm not a thin-skinned person\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:25.000\nIt's about intent\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:27.000\nIt's when you realize someone's really\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:29.000\nLike, wait, what's going on?\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:31.000\nIt's not like, oh no, I look like hodor\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:33.000\nThat guy's handsome\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:35.000\nBut it was like, holy shit\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:37.000\nLike this guy, because I was waiting\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:39.000\nI turned and looked\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:41.000\nAnd he just had this\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:43.000\nDelighted grin on his face\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:45.000\nBut he was a 30 year old man\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:47.000\nAnd he just\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:49.000\nLike, once I was looking at him\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:51.000\nHe just smiled and went, hodor\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:53.000\nMaybe\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:55.000\nHe was hodor\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:57.000\nI\n\n40:57.000 --> 40:59.000\nYeah, and he was saying\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:01.000\nHe was like, have a good night\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:03.000\nPaul Rudd, Paul Rudd\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:05.000\nPaul Rudd, Paul Rudd\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:07.000\nIs that you?\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:09.000\nIt's like the gift of the mad guy\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:11.000\nYeah, but he, I mean he just\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:13.000\nAnd I was like, so I just kept staring at him\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:15.000\nAnd he was like, hodor\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:17.000\nAnd his friends were all looking at him\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:19.000\nLike, like, like\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:21.000\nHave you had luck contacting hodor\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:23.000\nLike, like, I just\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:25.000\nThe whole thing was so sociopathic\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:27.000\nI kind of like, because I waited\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:29.000\nAnd I was like, well maybe now\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:31.000\nHe'll say, just kidding\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:33.000\nI love Harmontown, I'll see you at the show\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:35.000\nI guess that's silly of me\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:37.000\nTo expect, but I didn't\n\n41:37.000 --> 41:39.000\nExpect it as much as I really needed it\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:41.000\nIn that moment\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:43.000\nAnd so I just waited\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:45.000\nAnd I just slowly\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:47.000\nRaised a thumb\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:49.000\nI was like\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:51.000\nAnd then turned around\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:53.000\nAnd I was like, if I did this\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:55.000\nIn Los Angeles, this person\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:57.000\nWould feel bad\n\n41:57.000 --> 41:59.000\nThat's the dark side of Toronto\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:01.000\nDo you think he actually\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:03.000\nThought you were hodor?\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:05.000\nIt could be\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:07.000\nYou asshole, it could be\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:09.000\nNo, I mean people recognize you\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:11.000\nAs the wrong, I mean people recognize people\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:13.000\nAs the wrong celebrities, that definitely happens\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:15.000\nI legitimately look enough like hodor\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:17.000\nThat the guy could have thought I was hodor\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:19.000\nBut when you look back on it, like\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:21.000\nThere's enough of a chance that I'm not hodor\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:23.000\nThat that guy should not be doing that\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:25.000\nBut you're like\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:27.000\nA white guy, so it's okay\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:29.000\nLike, I remember once\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:31.000\nI was at an airport and NBA player\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:33.000\nChauncey Billips was there\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:35.000\nAnd I was like, I can't go up to Chauncey\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:37.000\nBillips and be like, you play in the NBA, right?\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:39.000\nLike, I can't go up\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:41.000\nTo a black guy\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:43.000\nThat's the worst thing I could have done\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:45.000\nHow do you think I felt?\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:47.000\nYou play in the NBA\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:49.000\nImagine\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:51.000\nMy anxiety the second time\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:53.000\nI got Mohammed today\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:55.000\nLike when I called the Uber\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:57.000\nI was like, wait, how can it be him?\n\n42:57.000 --> 42:59.000\nI ordered an SUV, I'm racist\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:01.000\nAnd it was a different Mohammed?\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:03.000\nNo, it was the same dude, he fucking fucked up\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:05.000\nLike these people do not have not these people\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:07.000\nThat's been our show\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:09.000\nConventional coming everybody\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:11.000\nOntarians\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:13.000\nGo ahead, what did these people\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:15.000\nNot understand\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:17.000\nTell us what they're like\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:19.000\nThey do not have Uber down\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:21.000\nIn Toronto\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:23.000\nYou know what? You should report it to the police\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:25.000\nI'll be a sketch artist\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:27.000\nWhat did he look like?\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:29.000\nHere, draw him for me\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:31.000\nIt's not Mohammed that done me wrong\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:33.000\nMohammed's okay\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:35.000\nFor the love of God, don't draw him\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nI know that was a joke\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:41.000\nI thought I'd get away with stealing it\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:43.000\nI don't know\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:45.000\nThey're Uber\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:47.000\nThey're not taking to Uber\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:49.000\nLike a fish to water in Toronto\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:51.000\nThey're not having\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.000\nThey're figuring it out\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:55.000\nWe haven't taken an Uber yet\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:57.000\nYou'll watch the car\n\n43:57.000 --> 43:59.000\nTwirl\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:01.000\nThe car will go\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:03.000\nPlant and then you'll get a phone call\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:05.000\nAnd you'll be like, are you okay?\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:07.000\nHe's just in a massive accident\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:09.000\nAnd they'll just tell you where they are\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:11.000\nAnd you'll walk to them for 10 minutes\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:13.000\nIn your head, they're like tumbling\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:15.000\nThey had a horrible accident\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:17.000\nAnd you're seeing it\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:19.000\nAre you alright, Mohammed? Are you okay?\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:21.000\nWhen I was in Paris\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:23.000\nIn Paris, the Uber is there\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:25.000\nI don't like Uber, I use Lyft\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:27.000\nBecause Lyft is a west coast thing\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:29.000\nYou guys don't have it here, do you?\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:31.000\nUber, blow, ho-ho's\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:33.000\nIt's the worst\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.000\nIn Paris, it's all a bunch of awesome Moroccan dudes\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:37.000\nAnd they drive\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:39.000\nGroovy cars\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:41.000\nAnd they're super hip and fun\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:43.000\nIt's the best\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:45.000\nSo you've had a good experience with your Uber\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:47.000\nOnly in Paris\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:49.000\nIn Toronto, the Uber's here\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:51.000\nI watched it, you look at the app\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:53.000\nAnd you just see a little icon of a car\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:55.000\nJust doing little pirouettes\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:57.000\nAnd they have a lot of one-way streets here\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:59.000\nSo it's like, it's not all\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:01.000\nThat wasn't on one-way streets though\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:03.000\nBut he kept making it look like it was\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:05.000\nAnd also then you add the, it's crazy\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:07.000\nBecause you just see, it looks like a little kid\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:09.000\nIt has a magnet behind a whiteboard\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:11.000\nIt's just like dragging the car around Toronto\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:13.000\nI don't know what\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:15.000\nSomething's gotta give\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:17.000\nWhat is on your Apple iWatch?\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:19.000\nToronto Facts\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:21.000\nToronto Facts\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:25.000\nDid you know that\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:27.000\nGood job Dustin\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:29.000\nDid you know that Toronto is named after the famed\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:31.000\nSidekick to the La Rhone\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:33.000\nRarranger\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:37.000\nJesus Christ\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:43.000\nThat was pretty good, that was pretty good\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:45.000\nThat is a great joke\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:47.000\nShut up, fuck you\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:49.000\nNo, I am not being facetious\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:51.000\nI am jealous\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:53.000\nI promise you, I will think of that\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:55.000\nJoke once a week\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:57.000\nUntil the day I die\n\n45:57.000 --> 45:59.000\nI am not joking\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:01.000\nThere is no more\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:03.000\nDid you know someone got\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:05.000\nMurdered here?\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:07.000\nI don't know\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:09.000\nWhat kind of hot buttons I am doing\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:11.000\nI am just listening to the Chiron\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:13.000\nThey have an\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:15.000\nInuit population here\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:17.000\nWhat is the last name of the artist\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:19.000\nThat just is, they are investigating\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:21.000\nThe murder or something\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:23.000\nYou guys should know your news\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:25.000\nWait, what\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:27.000\nFrom what you said\n\n46:27.000 --> 46:29.000\nThere is an Inuit population\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:31.000\nAnd somebody got murdered and an artist\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:33.000\nIs in charge of the investigation\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:35.000\nSorry, I fell apart\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:37.000\nBecause I started to get scared\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:39.000\nI don't know the local hot button stuff\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:41.000\nI don't know who I am going to offend\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:43.000\nBy the way, coming this fall to Netflix\n\n46:43.000 --> 46:45.000\nI am going to watch the fuck out of that show\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:47.000\nI was drinking in the bar\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:49.000\nTo the TV\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:51.000\nTo get their news crawl\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:53.000\nIt said there was an art\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:55.000\nThe police are still looking for the killer\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:57.000\nOf someone named\n\n46:57.000 --> 46:59.000\nPoo de goop\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:01.000\nLike there is a crazy name\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:03.000\nFor a murder victim\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:05.000\nAnd now I feel bad\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:07.000\nThat was a person\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:09.000\nYeah, it is a human being whose life is\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:11.000\nAnd there is probably\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:13.000\nAlso cultural ramifications\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:15.000\nOf what I am doing\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:17.000\nI am probably trampling all over horrible ghosts\n\n47:17.000 --> 47:19.000\nI really don't know\n\n47:19.000 --> 47:21.000\nWhat you are talking about\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:23.000\nThey have a funny name\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:25.000\nTheir name is funny\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:27.000\nEverything is funny\n\n47:27.000 --> 47:29.000\nMy name is Goobadoobadoo\n\n47:29.000 --> 47:31.000\nYour name is not Gary Johnson\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:33.000\nI think that is funny\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:35.000\nYou look weird\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:37.000\nYour instruments are weird\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:39.000\nI am sorry\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:41.000\nSo I am literally just trying\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:43.000\nI accept your apology\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:45.000\nI am just trying to pass through\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:47.000\nThe facts\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:49.000\nI just have any\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:51.000\nSo there was an Inuit artist\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:53.000\nWho was murdered\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:55.000\nDoes anyone have the facts in this case\n\n47:55.000 --> 47:57.000\nAnother artist is in charge of songs\n\n47:57.000 --> 47:59.000\nNo, there is no artist in charge of anything\n\n47:59.000 --> 48:01.000\nWas he Inuit or First Nations\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:03.000\nPolice are looking for the killer\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:05.000\nOf this artist\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:07.000\nDoes anybody know what we are talking about\n\n48:07.000 --> 48:09.000\nA human being up here\n\n48:09.000 --> 48:11.000\nShe knows\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:16.000\nI am sorry\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:18.000\nPoopa Goop\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:20.000\nThis is the Poopa Goop\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:22.000\nDid you just look this up\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:24.000\nYou can sit here\n\n48:24.000 --> 48:26.000\nTake a stool or what's your name\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:28.000\nAnya\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:30.000\nDid you know about this from before\n\n48:30.000 --> 48:31.000\nOr you just looked this up\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:33.000\nI did know about it before\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:35.000\nI brought the beer up too\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:37.000\nI am very excited about that\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:38.000\nYeah, I just looked up the names\n\n48:38.000 --> 48:45.500\nname. It's okay, yeah. So tell us everything about this. An award-winning Inuit artist\n\n48:45.500 --> 48:49.880\nhas been identified as the woman who was found dead earlier this week in the Rudeau River\n\n48:49.880 --> 48:56.380\nin Ottawa. And her name is? I'm gonna fuck this up, too. Annie Pudugook. Okay. Pudugook.\n\n48:56.380 --> 49:07.380\nYou're close. So hilarious to me. Ha ha ha. Her family's in the audience. Even if they're\n\n49:07.380 --> 49:11.640\nnot, like, there's probably some raging, boiling, like fucking... Dude, I saw the guest\n\n49:11.640 --> 49:17.000\nlisten and said, Pudugook plus three. Plus two now. Oh.\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:42.580\nThat was a... I don't know if that was the Sandman or a hockey player. That was a Toronto\n\n49:42.580 --> 49:47.780\nversion of the Sandman. That was the best thing I've ever seen. All right, well, Anya,\n\n49:47.780 --> 49:55.460\nlet's get to know you a little bit. Hi, my name's Anya. Anya, aside from being the fastest\n\n49:55.460 --> 50:04.180\nGoogler in the front two rows, what is your specialty? Oh, I'm a vegan. That's like...\n\n50:04.180 --> 50:12.940\nI run a... I love the self-loathing that that was said about. You guys can't... You're\n\n50:12.940 --> 50:16.340\nin the wrong town, but that's it. I'm vegetarian. I'm vegetarian. You guys will just put a piece\n\n50:16.340 --> 50:24.020\nof bacon on any old thing. I run a, like, with my two best friends, an Instagram account\n\n50:24.020 --> 50:31.140\ncalled VeganGirlfriend. And that's what I do. And I'm a comedian, too, but... What's the\n\n50:31.140 --> 50:37.540\nthing? Oh, yeah. Sorry. Sorry. Hang on. Hang on. Hold up. People are more mad about that\n\n50:37.540 --> 50:43.260\nthan the whole Muhammad drawing thing. Yeah. Yeah, the politeness for their... They don't\n\n50:43.260 --> 50:51.140\nhave it for their own, or is it... They just love bacon products here. Well, she's leaving\n\n50:51.140 --> 50:57.020\nmore for you, and she's being very self-effacing and a new... You know, she's putting herself\n\n50:57.020 --> 51:03.820\nat risk. What's the goal for the Instagram account? What's the idea behind it? I'm gonna\n\n51:03.820 --> 51:07.300\nget in so much trouble. My friends are gonna be so mad at me. I started... Yeah, you don't\n\n51:07.300 --> 51:15.740\nwant the word to get out. No, no, no. I... Make sure you... You promoted our shit. Make\n\n51:15.740 --> 51:27.420\nsure you put them on stage. Wait, VeganGirlfriend? Yeah, that's me. Yeah. Oh, you have 23,000\n\n51:27.420 --> 51:35.420\nfollowers. Hey, you have 23,000 and one follower. Thank you. He is going to follow you later,\n\n51:35.420 --> 51:44.820\nI promise. There's no real goal to it. I started it as, like, a fun thing to do, and now Ari\n\n51:44.820 --> 51:51.660\non a Grand Day follows us, and that's all she wrote. Does she lick your doughnuts? That's\n\n51:51.660 --> 51:57.300\na reference to it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Does Ari on a Grand Day lick, lick, lick the crawlers\n\n51:57.300 --> 52:00.580\nor something? She was at a store, and she... While the people weren't looking, she licked\n\n52:00.580 --> 52:03.660\nthe doughnuts, and then said, this is why America sucks so much, is because we have\n\n52:03.660 --> 52:08.020\nso many doughnuts. Right, and she said a doughnut... All right, well, whatever. She's a child.\n\n52:08.020 --> 52:13.820\nWhy am I shaming her for living a life in captivity? She's on camera, it looks like...\n\n52:13.820 --> 52:18.380\nIt should be more of an outrage that she's on security cam licking doughnuts. She should\n\n52:18.380 --> 52:21.460\nbe able to get away with licking a doughnut. But she's also a grown up. I think you forget\n\n52:21.460 --> 52:26.100\nthat because she's very tiny, but she's like... What do you look like? Most pop stars are\n\n52:26.100 --> 52:29.940\nlike Adele's age, which is crazy, because Adele seems like a grown ass lady, and a lot\n\n52:29.940 --> 52:34.540\nof these girls don't, but they're all grown ass ladies. But 50's the new 30. She's 24,\n\n52:34.540 --> 52:40.660\nI think. 24's the new 11. I think Adele's like 25. It's crazy. Oh, Adele's 25? Oh, fuck\n\n52:40.660 --> 52:47.380\nAriana Grande. I see what you're saying. She must be an old soul. That's the age when\n\n52:47.380 --> 52:52.620\ndementia kicks in and you start licking doughnuts. It tastes good? I will say, if I'm going\n\n52:52.620 --> 52:59.940\nto a doughnut shop and there's one that was licked by Ariana Grande, I would pay double\n\n52:59.940 --> 53:09.100\nfor it. Would you eat it, or would you just... Yes. Slowly and sensuously. You think her\n\n53:09.100 --> 53:16.660\nsaliva tastes better than other Disney kids, or Disney grown ladies? That's a very difficult\n\n53:16.660 --> 53:24.620\nquestion to answer without the necessary research. Yeah, I'd have to do research. Ariana, I don't\n\n53:24.620 --> 53:31.700\nhave to get shot in the book in there. So you, your friend Megan, and your friend Alexandra,\n\n53:31.700 --> 53:37.100\nyou guys have this vegan girlfriend thing, and then it's... It says it's based in Toronto\n\n53:37.100 --> 53:44.060\nand L.A. Yeah, my Megan just moved to L.A. Megan. So now we're worldwide. No, she just\n\n53:44.060 --> 53:50.820\nmoved to L.A. So we're worldwide. Was that Dave Kline out there? Look, this picture has\n\n53:50.820 --> 53:59.300\n500 likes. Can you believe this is a cake? No, we can't start doing this. It looks delicious.\n\n53:59.300 --> 54:09.060\nHow can you believe it? Yeah. Okay. It just looks a lot like it. Have you been to Hogtown\n\n54:09.060 --> 54:15.020\nVegan on Blur? I have. It's fucking good. It's delicious. It's so good. It's amazing.\n\n54:15.020 --> 54:20.980\nMaybe you're not a vegetarian. Go to Hogtown Vegan. It's fucking delicious. This looks\n\n54:20.980 --> 54:29.540\ngreat. Cut my cake. It's out of L.A. It's called Cut My Cakes. She makes like granite. That's\n\n54:29.540 --> 54:33.340\nwhat I'm saying. It's like, cake fucks your wife. It's an alt-right foodie Instagram.\n\n54:33.340 --> 54:39.620\nThat's a fun time. Cut my cake. Cut my cake. Cuck cakes would be great. They would not\n\n54:39.620 --> 54:46.300\nneed to be vegan though. How many times a week do you get called a cuck on Twitter? Me?\n\n54:46.300 --> 54:52.820\nNot that often. You know what? I decided to stop reading my replies and I don't read\n\n54:52.820 --> 54:59.660\nthem as much. What if they tell you you're awesome? Well, I can hear 50 awesomes and\n\n54:59.660 --> 55:04.500\nthen one person calls me a cuck and it ruins me. Are you guys both being called cucks because\n\n55:04.500 --> 55:10.020\nyou have, like, people know you have a wife or a girlfriend? Why are you a cuck? No. They're\n\n55:10.020 --> 55:21.140\nliberals. Also because I cucked the shit out of this guy. I don't even know what that\n\n55:21.140 --> 55:27.700\nmeans. I think a lot of dance dances. I don't know what it's a do part of the show. Emily\n\n55:27.700 --> 55:36.140\ndoes a Bazinga and then I do a yeehaw dance. I love it. You guys know what yeehaw is? Of\n\n55:36.140 --> 55:45.020\ncourse you don't. I grew up on yeehaw. Here's what I'm curious. Young Torontonians, what\n\n55:45.020 --> 55:56.340\nis your relationship with Take Off You Hoser? Is Dan and I walking down, what street were\n\n55:56.340 --> 56:04.380\nwe on? Bay? Or some shit? Young? Is it young or you don't know what a street name is? It's\n\n56:04.380 --> 56:08.420\nyoung guy. We're walking down the road and we're like, do people still call each other\n\n56:08.420 --> 56:14.100\nhosers? And in the event that somebody is a hoser, do you admonish them to take off?\n\n56:14.100 --> 56:24.860\nYeah. Yeah. People still say hoser here? The answer is no. Yeah. Yeah, we were wondering\n\n56:24.860 --> 56:33.540\nor do they even know about that? I've watched Strange Brew 11,000 times. Really? You guys\n\n56:33.540 --> 56:39.340\nare actually in New Strange Brew. That's great. Well, I guess that makes sense. It's kind\n\n56:39.340 --> 56:43.860\nof a local, I mean, that's like their area, right? That's all we've got. That story's\n\n56:43.860 --> 56:50.500\ntaking place right around here. You guys, like, Toronton is the home of, like, SCTV, like\n\n56:50.500 --> 56:56.220\nall that fucking stuff. Oh, I have a lot of, like, really funny comedy friends, like the\n\n56:56.220 --> 57:02.700\nshow Monsecone Valley, the guy, Toss Middletich, who plays Richard, is from here. I just texted\n\n57:02.700 --> 57:08.420\nhim to be like, hey, do you have any Torontotips? He has no Torontotips. The guy that I travel\n\n57:08.420 --> 57:13.100\nwith when I do Who's Live Anyway with Ryan Stiles and Greg Proops and the gang, it's\n\n57:13.100 --> 57:21.860\nBob Durkash, who was the musician for Toronto Second City for 25 years. Toronto is a comedy\n\n57:21.860 --> 57:25.460\ntown way back all over the place. For sure. Yeah.\n\n57:25.460 --> 57:31.700\nWell, you're saying with all these improv roots here, we should probably get some information\n\n57:31.700 --> 57:41.460\nfrom Rania and then do a hilarious, improvised sketch of some kind. And in the event that\n\n57:41.460 --> 57:44.580\nEmily Gordon never has a bezinga, you have to do your dance.\n\n57:44.580 --> 57:49.260\nRight. I'm gonna have a bezinga, though.\n\n57:49.260 --> 57:54.980\nSo, Anya, why don't we just do your biopic? Like, where were you born?\n\n57:54.980 --> 57:58.700\nI was born in Canada. I was raised in Ireland.\n\n57:58.700 --> 58:04.860\nRaised in Ireland, but born in Canada. Why? I mean, what happened?\n\n58:04.860 --> 58:10.180\nWell, where else do you get a name like Anya? I mean, like, aside from Poland and Russia.\n\n58:10.180 --> 58:14.020\nYeah, most of Europe, you can get the name Anya.\n\n58:14.020 --> 58:18.420\nAll right, so raised in Ireland. Yeah, my parents are from there.\n\n58:18.420 --> 58:23.980\nBoth parents are Irish. So they just had you in Canada and then absconded.\n\n58:23.980 --> 58:28.660\nThey had like a house in Ireland and they brought me there and then they came back.\n\n58:28.660 --> 58:31.820\nDo you speak Irish? It's not that I don't speak Irish, I'm sorry.\n\n58:31.820 --> 58:38.300\nThat's not a language. It is. They force it, they have these things\n\n58:38.300 --> 58:44.060\ncalled gale talks, which is like you go there, it's like a confined space where you go just\n\n58:44.060 --> 58:45.740\nto speak gale like and you can't speak English.\n\n58:45.740 --> 58:47.860\nThis is your parents? No, well, this is your parents.\n\n58:47.860 --> 58:54.780\nI have an Instagram called Vegan Gale Talk. Gale Friends.\n\n58:54.780 --> 58:59.060\nVegan Gale Friends. Can you believe this is a clock?\n\n58:59.060 --> 59:03.380\nDad, you fixed it. Vegan Gale Friends. Yeah, I blessed it.\n\n59:03.380 --> 59:07.460\nHe's always blessed in my shit. I blessed it, I blessed it.\n\n59:07.460 --> 59:09.980\nYou blessed it. Yeah, Vegan Gale Friends.\n\n59:09.980 --> 59:13.900\nYeah. Well, you just mined our friendship.\n\n59:13.900 --> 59:20.020\nAll right, so you're raised in Ireland. They have a house there. How do you end up back\n\n59:20.020 --> 59:23.860\nin Canada? It was really not exciting. We just came back\n\n59:23.860 --> 59:25.820\nto Canada. We're going to make it exciting.\n\n59:25.820 --> 59:32.820\nThank you. We came back to Canada and then I moved to Toronto because I was vegan and\n\n59:32.820 --> 59:38.020\nI wanted to be vegan in a place where I was raised in a Mennonite town like in Canada.\n\n59:38.020 --> 59:46.820\nIt's called Elmira, if anybody knows it. What's the place called?\n\n59:46.820 --> 59:57.820\nIt's called Elmira. Wait, did you just say Elmira? Sorry, couldn't hear it.\n\n59:57.820 --> 01:00:03.220\nDo you know what the Urdu word for cupboard is? This is true. Urdu word for cupboard?\n\n01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:13.380\nElmira. But it really is. Sorry, I was saying Urdu.\n\n01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:19.820\nAnd all right. I wanted to be a comedian and a vegan at the same time.\n\n01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:23.020\nThat's really hard. The only place to do that is Toronto.\n\n01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:31.780\nYou need meat protein to be on stage. I'm going to die now.\n\n01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:37.180\nI feel like the veganism is a point that you really want to be pushed in the movie.\n\n01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:41.540\nYou want to make sure that's included. It is why I moved out of the Mennonite\n\n01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:46.420\ncapital of Canada. That's probably wrong. All right, thank you.\n\n01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:49.700\nWhat is a Mennonite? I was afraid to sound stupid.\n\n01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.780\nWhat is a Mennonite? Thank you, sir.\n\n01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:57.220\nI'm blaming it all. Mennonites are wrong.\n\n01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:04.580\nI need a Mennonomic device to remember what a Mennonite is.\n\n01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:09.700\nThis is the second time I've heard it mentioned in Canada.\n\n01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:12.660\nSomeone mentioned Mennonites to me in Banff and I nodded.\n\n01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:17.220\nIt felt charged. It felt like there was something going on and I was like, okay.\n\n01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:19.980\nIt's like the Amish. Yeah, if you know what an Amish is, you\n\n01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:24.060\nknow what a Mennonite is. It's like a quaker.\n\n01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:31.020\nYeah. Like a Mennonite.\n\n01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:34.740\nYeah, yeah, like diet. What do you mean diet Mennonite?\n\n01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:39.220\nSome dude yelled out diet Mennonite and he was like, hey, exactly.\n\n01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:41.580\nWhat do you mean? It's like a lapsed Catholic.\n\n01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:44.900\nI just assumed that he meant like Amish is like a diet Mennonite because you guys are\n\n01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:47.860\nmore hardcore. I don't think Amish is a diet, anything.\n\n01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:51.020\nI think they're the worst. Well, you haven't met a Mennonite then.\n\n01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:55.500\nI mean, I have now. I'm not a Mennonite. You are a diet Mennonite.\n\n01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:59.580\nAll right. Who's on first? All right. I think, well, let's thank\n\n01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:04.820\nAnya for volunteering or life to us. Anya, everybody.\n\n01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:09.020\nYou should probably go and have a seat and watch your bio pic.\n\n01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:15.300\nAnya. Let's hear from Anya.\n\n01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:20.580\nOh boy. The girl who knows about Inuits and veganism.\n\n01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:28.900\nOkay. Good on you. Thank you, sir.\n\n01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:33.900\nDo it, Dan. That's a pizzinga. That was a pizzinga.\n\n01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:37.420\nI really feel like that guy should get that bottle of vodka Dan just picked up for that\n\n01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:38.420\ntime. Wait, so what?\n\n01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:43.820\nThe guy just had a funny joke. Dan heard someone stealing vodka and he\n\n01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:49.340\nwas, he demurred. All right. So, okay. So, right.\n\n01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:52.940\nWe probably don't have control of her lights, but fade in.\n\n01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:56.340\nCan we, can we go completely to black to start this off?\n\n01:02:56.340 --> 01:03:06.340\nThe bridge is gone. There we go.\n\n01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:36.260\nUh, Ontario, 1989. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Patrick.\n\n01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:50.740\nYes, oh, yes. Oh, maybe we, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe it's coming out of me.\n\n01:03:50.740 --> 01:04:02.500\nI hope it's a, I hope it's a, it's a strong lad who loves meat.\n\n01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:03.500\nI think.\n\n01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:07.340\nI hope you don't give birth to another vegan.\n\n01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:08.340\nLet's find out.\n\n01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:11.740\nYou're going to give birth to a standing up.\n\n01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:14.020\nYou're going to do another standing birth.\n\n01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:15.020\nIt's so gross.\n\n01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:17.260\nSo I'll have to get the mop out again.\n\n01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:18.260\nIt's the Gaelic way.\n\n01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:19.260\nIt's Gaelic medicine.\n\n01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:20.260\nGo ahead.\n\n01:04:20.260 -->

choice but to trust that Mennonite boy that was calling on you.\n\n01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:38.780\nWhat does that mean?\n\n01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:42.660\nDoes that mean what I think it means?\n\n01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:47.780\nIf this family must continue, by any means, it must continue.\n\n01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:48.780\nHere.\n\n01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:53.780\nLook.\n\n01:10:53.780

wants to men and knight?\n\n01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:31.780\nWho's pussy's good and tight?\n\n01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:34.780\nWho wants to fuck all night?\n\n01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:35.780\nYeah.\n\n01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:36.780\nYou peaked too quickly.\n\n01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:39.780\nYou gotta save that for the end of the rap.\n\n01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:42.780\nIt was badass, but then the two-thirty of the way through, I was like, who's a human\n\n01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:43.780\nbeing in the audience?\n\n01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:50.580\nYou should maybe add, your pussy's good and tight.\n\n01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:51.580\nYou got top that?\n\n01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:52.580\nYeah.\n\n01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:54.580\nThat could be a record.\n\n01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:58.460\nMy girlfriend's cousin's in the audience.\n\n01:12:58.460 --> 01:12:59.460\nJust met them.\n\n01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:03.460\nThey're like, what's the show about?\n\n01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:04.460\nYou'll see.\n\n01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:05.460\nYou'll see.\n\n01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:10.860\nNow, have you seen Prairie Home Companion?\n\n01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:14.860\nIt's like that, but it's a felony.\n\n01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:15.860\nAnd it's not.\n\n01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:16.860\nSpencer, how are you doing over there?\n\n01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:18.740\nOh, I'm so good.\n\n01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:22.460\nRemember when we were talking about rituals for young adults?\n\n01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:23.460\nYes.\n\n01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:24.460\nBruce Lee Day.\n\n01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:27.940\nTell us more, please.\n\n01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:31.740\nI mean, who's the perfect masculine mascot?\n\n01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:32.740\nBruce Lee.\n\n01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:34.380\nTo usher you into manhood?\n\n01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:35.380\nTo everybody.\n\n01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:37.140\nTo all men.\n\n01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:38.660\nWho doesn't look up to Bruce Lee?\n\n01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:40.180\nHe's fucking perfect.\n\n01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:47.620\nHe embodies physical acuity, violence in a healthy way that's not like, well, I mean,\n\n01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:48.620\nhe's a philosopher.\n\n01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:53.980\nIt's hard to deny that violence is part of, you know, at least the traditional masculine\n\n01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:55.620\nidentity in some form.\n\n01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:58.540\nIt's just usually that violence is bad.\n\n01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:00.420\nWhat does one do on Bruce Lee Day?\n\n01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:01.420\nWhat?\n\n01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:04.500\nHow do you celebrate if you're a 12 or 13-year-old boy?\n\n01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:07.660\nYou break boards?\n\n01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:13.940\nYou follow the code of ethics that Bruce Lee puts forth to make you learn how to do a one-inch\n\n01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:14.940\npunch?\n\n01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:20.020\nOr the one-inch punch that I used to have a little flip book when I was a kid of Bruce\n\n01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:23.900\nLee doing nunchucks, and I would like try and train.\n\n01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:27.860\nI would watch the flip book, and then try and train myself to do it.\n\n01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:28.860\nThat's amazing.\n\n01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:33.140\nYou're like, you flip, and then you start, and then you're trying to do it in one hand.\n\n01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:34.140\nYou're like, ah.\n\n01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:35.140\nAnd I have to pause it.\n\n01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:38.660\nIt's very hard to do a flip book with one hand.\n\n01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:40.180\nThat's exactly what you would do, though.\n\n01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:42.180\nIt's a good technique.\n\n01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:47.260\nDid you ever try break dancing by watching break in two or something, and then rewinding\n\n01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:48.980\non the VCR, and then you try to do it?\n\n01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:50.620\nDoing the slow-mo of it?\n\n01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:51.620\nNever worked.\n\n01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:52.620\nTurbo in Ozone.\n\n01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:57.780\nMy brother and I spent hours just trying to learn to break dance, and we never did.\n\n01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:00.860\nCan we see a little more of that?\n\n01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:02.940\nWhat do you mean it never worked?\n\n01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:05.260\nThis is the podcast, right?\n\n01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:06.660\nThis is called Poppin' and Lockin'.\n\n01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:09.660\nOh my God!\n\n01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:15.660\nHoly shit!\n\n01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:26.660\nI'm so glad Corey Thelma can be here tonight.\n\n01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:36.660\nThat was amazing.\n\n01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:40.300\nVery good.\n\n01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:47.140\nIt's probably good that little kids, I saw a thing that said, when you go through puberty,\n\n01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:55.460\nlittle boys, like the sexual and the violent parts of their brains start to all match.\n\n01:15:55.460 --> 01:16:00.220\nThey start to light up like crazy at the same time, and they kind of like drift over.\n\n01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:02.660\nOh, the animal stuff, the sex and the violence.\n\n01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:04.980\nYes, but who do you think is doing the research?\n\n01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:05.980\nI know, I know.\n\n01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:09.820\nIt's such a weird pop-size thing to do.\n\n01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:20.500\nBut if that were true, little boys were prone to hit things with their firetruck toy, and\n\n01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:28.260\nyou couldn't think of a healthier way to collect and redirect that than martial arts classes.\n\n01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:32.460\nBecause you would go like, okay, yeah, you have to like, if you really concentrate and\n\n01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:37.300\ngo to bed when we tell you to, you'll be able to kick the world's ass, but you have to wait\n\n01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:39.300\nfor the world to attack you.\n\n01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:43.300\nIt's like, okay, now it's your problem, next generation.\n\n01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:47.940\nWhen this guy's 30, he'll be Ted Bundy, but fuck it.\n\n01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:51.620\nHe's just like going to bed every night with a poster of a naked man above it, and he's\n\n01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:52.620\njust doing push-ups.\n\n01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:55.740\nLike, one day I'll beat up everyone.\n\n01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:57.620\nBut everyone has to attack me first.\n\n01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:01.020\nYeah, I mean, maybe it'll be the way they talk to me at the grocery store, but they'll\n\n01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:06.900\nattack me.\n\n01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:07.900\nCan I say something?\n\n01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:12.140\nWhen I did my show here earlier tonight, I saw this beautiful theater, and I was like,\n\n01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:18.660\nhow is Harmontown going to feel like Harmontown in this space?\n\n01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:22.700\nAnd you guys did a great job.\n\n01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:25.900\nIt's felt like a Harmontown.\n\n01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:26.900\nMore so, really.\n\n01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:27.900\nI mean, they're very chill.\n\n01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:28.900\nThey're very, very welcoming.\n\n01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:29.900\nThis is a good audience.\n\n01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:31.900\nYeah, usually much closer.\n\n01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:37.940\nIt makes me want to meet more of them, like I want to kind of like, is this me pimping\n\n01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:44.580\nyou guys too much, or Emily, if I like, because you were at one point, you had a therapeutic\n\n01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:53.580\ncareer, you've written many things about relationships and things, we bring up a couple, and get\n\n01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:54.580\nto know them.\n\n01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:56.580\nAre we going to watch them have sex, or?\n\n01:17:56.580 --> 01:18:01.980\nNo, I'm just like, maybe they have an issue that they're trying to deal with.\n\n01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:02.980\nWell, that's fun.\n\n01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:06.980\nI find that often people don't volunteer for things like this, but let's see what happens.\n\n01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:08.980\nWell, haven't you been to my show?\n\n01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:10.980\nThere's a couple right there.\n\n01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:14.900\nWhat's so great is that a couple raised their hands, but also their friends are pointing\n\n01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:15.900\nlike these guys.\n\n01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:16.900\nThey're like, yeah.\n\n01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:17.900\nGet them out of here.\n\n01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:18.900\nThey've got shit to work out.\n\n01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:21.500\nChad and Natalie, you need to talk to them right now.\n\n01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:23.660\nOkay, you guys want to come up?\n\n01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:26.700\nYou guys really have a, oh my God, Emily.\n\n01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:30.700\nSo we've got two stools here.\n\n01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:34.700\nAll right.\n\n01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:37.700\nAnd we're totally going to watch these people have sex.\n\n01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:40.700\nWe're totally

natural like give and take\n\n01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:09.700\nwhere you have to like lean in and like you have that visual cue of like, I'm going to\n\n01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:10.700\ntalk.\n\n01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:11.700\nNo, I'm going to talk.\n\n01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:12.700\nFuck you.\n\n01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:14.460\nSo your names are again.\n\n01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:15.700\nMy name is Colin.\n\n01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:16.700\nLauren.\n\n01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:17.700\nColin and Lauren.\n\n01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:18.700\nAll right.\n\n01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:20.700\nSo what's the problem?\n\n01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:25.260\nI guess, well, we've been living together for the last little bit, but I'm broke and\n\n01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:27.180\nI'm going to have to move back in with my parents.\n\n01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:30.780\nSo we're going to be splitting up that way, but not all together.\n\n01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:33.620\nBut yeah, so we're not going to be seeing each other as much.\n\n01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:34.620\nYou guys have been living together?\n\n01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:35.620\nYes.\n\n01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:36.620\nOkay.\n\n01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:39.460\nTo be fair, we've been living together pretty much since we've known each other.\n\n01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:40.460\nHow long have you been together?\n\n01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:42.460\nAbout a year now, actually.\n\n01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:43.460\nYeah.\n\n01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:44.460\nOkay.\n\n01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:45.460\nNot too much.\n\n01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:46.460\nSo you kind of moved in almost immediately?\n\n01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:47.460\nI moved in.\n\n01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:48.460\nYeah.\n\n01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:49.460\nI moved in immediately.\n\n01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:50.460\nImmediately.\n\n01:19:50.460 --> 01:20:01.580\nAnd, well, and you consumed his, now he has to leave, but wait, how would, how did that\n\n01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:02.580\nhappen?\n\n01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:05.900\nThat show game, like you moved, you moved in and now he has to go move his parents and\n\n01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:06.900\nyou're keeping me apart.\n\n01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:10.740\nTo somebody paying rent, it sounds like.\n\n01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:11.740\nYou got a job.\n\n01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:13.580\nThis was an active year for you.\n\n01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:16.420\nAre you staying in his place?\n\n01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:18.780\nHe's moving in, oh no, I'm not staying in his place.\n\n01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:19.780\nYou're moving out of that place.\n\n01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:20.780\nOkay.\n\n01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:21.780\nOkay.\n\n01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:22.780\nTechnically, I have my own house.\n\n01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:23.780\nI just never go there.\n\n01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:24.780\nAll right.\n\n01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:25.780\nTake it easy.\n\n01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:30.620\nYou guys came with like seven friends and they're, like, they're up here.\n\n01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:31.620\nThat's enough.\n\n01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:32.620\nAll right.\n\n01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:33.620\nSo Lauren.\n\n01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:36.820\nLauren, you moved in, you moved in to Collins Crib.\n\n01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:37.820\nYeah.\n\n01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:39.460\nAbout a year ago.\n\n01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:44.940\nAnd then Collins, you've fallen on hard times and you got to move back in with the family.\n\n01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:45.940\nYes.\n\n01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:47.180\nNow, Lauren, where are you headed now?\n\n01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:48.740\nI have to go to my apartment.\n\n01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:49.860\nWell, my house.\n\n01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:50.860\nI'm very disappointed.\n\n01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:51.860\nYou have your own home?\n\n01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:52.860\nYeah.\n\n01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:53.860\nI'm very disappointed.\n\n01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:56.860\nWhy can't Collins move into your fucking house?\n\n01:20:56.860 --> 01:21:02.060\nHe supported you for a year.\n\n01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:06.260\nWell, let me ask first, what's been the rent situation?\n\n01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:10.020\nWhat's been the, who pays the rent in the house that you guys have been in?\n\n01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:11.020\nYou have been paying.\n\n01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:12.020\nSo I've been paying the rent.\n\n01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:13.020\nI do have a roommate.\n\n01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:14.020\nHe's with me in the front row as well.\n\n01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:15.020\nSure.\n\n01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:16.020\nBut yes, I've been paying the rent.\n\n01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:17.020\nYou haven't been paying the rent.\n\n01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:18.020\nNo.\n\n01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:19.020\nYes.\n\n01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:20.020\nYes.\n\n01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:21.020\nOkay.\n\n01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:22.020\nI'll write that.\n\n01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:24.820\nSo you weren't living with him because you needed to, you just were spending all your\n\n01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:25.820\ntime.\n\n01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:26.820\nThat's just kind of unusual.\n\n01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:27.820\nYou guys want to be together.\n\n01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:29.340\nYou had, you've been paying rent on your house.\n\n01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:30.340\nYes.\n\n01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:31.340\nOkay, gotcha.\n\n01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:32.900\nSo what is your issue with having him move in with you?\n\n01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:35.940\nHe's kind of supported you in some, some fashion.\n\n01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:39.300\nSo what's the issue with having him move in?\n\n01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:42.820\nIt's not as much him as like my situation.\n\n01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:46.860\nWhat, are you a fanatic or what are you doing?\n\n01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:48.540\nWhy are you being so vain?\n\n01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:54.620\nBy the way, the trick to being a therapist is to just ask the most obvious questions.\n\n01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:57.460\nSo what is your situation?\n\n01:21:57.460 --> 01:22:02.300\nI'm new to town and I moved in with people from my residence at university.\n\n01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:04.540\nOh, so you have a bunch of roommates.\n\n01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:06.100\nOh, a ton of roommates.\n\n01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:07.100\nOkay.\n\n01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:08.100\nVery good people.\n\n01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:09.100\nYeah.\n\n01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:10.100\nAnd you don't, you're not a fan.\n\n01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:11.100\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:13.100\nNeither of you are fans or just calling?\n\n01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:15.380\nYeah, neither of us are fans.\n\n01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:19.700\nAnd may I ask, are you two, would you consider yourselves in love?\n\n01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:20.700\nVery much so.\n\n01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:21.700\nYeah.\n\n01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:22.700\nYeah.\n\n01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:23.700\nPerfect.\n\n01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:24.700\nPerfect.\n\n01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:32.060\nYou don't want that to be answered at the same time.\n\n01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:33.060\nYes.\n\n01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:37.740\nYou want one person to say it and the other person in a white hot panic to repeat it.\n\n01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:41.380\nI saw a bit of equivocation on that.\n\n01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:42.380\nYou guys are young.\n\n01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:43.380\nYeah.\n\n01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:46.340\nI mean, I will say that's a good time being young.\n\n01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:52.220\nLike, look, I've cohabitated with like a thousand people and it's always been the path\n\n01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:54.340\nof least resistance, the logical thing to do.\n\n01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:59.420\nSo if there are a couple of little riddler question marks on their labyrinth like map,\n\n01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:00.420\nwhat the fucking metaphor?\n\n01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:01.420\nWhat is that metaphor?\n\n01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:06.980\nI just, I just sprayed my neck on it.\n\n01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:10.660\nIt's probably all good and well for us to have a couple head scratches when we hear\n\n01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:14.500\nthe situation because they're at a time in their lives when maybe they shouldn't have\n\n01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:16.300\nthis shit all figured out.\n\n01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:22.620\nSo it sounds like you had 100% control when it was his apartment, but...\n\n01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:23.860\nYou always had your own place to go back to.\n\n01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:27.740\nShe could always, if they had a fight, if he turned out to be like own a collection of\n\n01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:33.860\nhuman teeth, like she could just, if he was, if he like during lovemaking cried out, I'm\n\n01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:37.460\nactually from Montreal.\n\n01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:38.460\nShe could quietly slip out.\n\n01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:39.460\nI'm a Mennonite.\n\n01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:43.580\nYou won't have that anymore.\n\n01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:47.460\nBut not only is it more real, but also it's probably not even possible because it sounds\n\n01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:55.060\nlike your living situation is more of a like a burning man kind of tent that you're curiously\n\n01:23:55.060 --> 01:24:01.100\ncommitted to though, like you have like a year contract at like a hostel.\n\n01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:08.020\nNow Lauren, what is the, or either of you, what do you think the next step is, like Colin\n\n01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:11.060\nyou're moving into a new place, so you're, you're searching for new places?\n\n01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:12.060\nMoving back with my parents.\n\n01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:13.060\nWhere are your parents?\n\n01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:17.020\nMy parents, um, we're not from Toronto, we're Peterborough, which is two hours north, they're\n\n01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:18.020\nin Peterborough as well.\n\n01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:19.020\nPeterborough!\n\n01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:20.020\nSo you guys...\n\n01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:25.020\nI have family in Peter, Peterborough, is that what it's called?\n\n01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:26.020\nYou too?\n\n01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:27.020\nPeterborough.\n\n01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:29.020\nSo you guys are going to be two hours apart now.\n\n01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:32.020\nNo, we'll just be like, I don't know, ten minute drive.\n\n01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:35.020\nWait, wait, how, where the fuck do you live then?\n\n01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:36.500\nOh, I live in Peterborough too.\n\n01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:38.500\nI moved there for school.\n\n01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:39.500\nOh!\n\n01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:40.500\nOkay.\n\n01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:41.500\nAll right, okay.\n\n01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:44.500\nSo you guys will be, I was like, go ahead Emily, you're the pro here.\n\n01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:49.220\nI'm so confused Emily, you have, you have a degree in this one, fucking take over.\n\n01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:54.940\nI have a degree in Peterborough, uh, whichever one it is, uh, I think I, and there's a term\n\n01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:59.420\ncalled sliding, not deciding, which is like when people end up, couples end up moving\n\n01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:03.460\nin together more out of necessity and like they need cheap rent more than because they've\n\n01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:08.180\ndecided like I would like to spend all my time and have all my stuff paired with yours\n\n01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:12.980\nand those relationships end up splitting often because you don't feel like you're choosing\n\n01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:14.460\nto move in with someone you love.\n\n01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:18.460\nYou feel like this is all we can do right now because we're broke as shit.\n\n01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:19.460\nAnd I think the most...\n\n01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:21.460\nYou just described three quarters of my adult life.\n\n01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:22.460\nExactly.\n\n01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:24.460\nAnd how do those work out?\n\n01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:25.460\nExactly.\n\n01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:30.460\nAnd I'm just saying, wait, I've done that with several, uh, not, not you love.\n\n01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:33.460\nAnd I decided.\n\n01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:38.460\nAnd also you moved in with me and showed up with two, two, uh, grocery bags.\n\n01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:39.460\nI was like, I'm moving in.\n\n01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:41.460\nAnd I was like, I've made a huge mistake.\n\n01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:43.460\nThat's pretty much what happened.\n\n01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:49.460\nThey were not grocery bags, they were garbage bags.\n\n01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:53.460\nI couldn't fit everything I own into two grocery bags.\n\n01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:54.460\nDon't be crazy.\n\n01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:55.460\nGarbage bags?\n\n01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:56.460\nSure.\n\n01:25:56.460 --> 01:26:01.460\nBut you guys need to like, um, I think the obvious like, it doesn't sound like your living\n\n01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:05.460\nsituation is stable, but I think maybe you need to work on your ideas of like, do you\n\n01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:12.460\nfully committing to this would be at the next level, would be you guys moving into a place\n\n01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:14.460\nthat's just the two of you, perhaps if you wanted.\n\n01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:16.460\nAnd maybe it's not time for that now.\n\n01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:20.460\nBut if that's a goal, maybe that all you can agree on now is that that's the goal.\n\n01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:25.460\nAnd then you go to your parents' house, you go to your fucking burning man, and you guys\n\n01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:31.460\nare going to, there's a terror to, I've been in those relationships where I'm like, oh\n\n01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:38.460\nman, if we make this, if we go backward, it's going to be a disaster.\n\n01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:41.460\nI'm not saying that means it's going to be.\n\n01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:48.460\nI am saying if that were possible, then what's the point?\n\n01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:54.460\nAnd you will find, I think that it will romanticize everything.\n\n01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:58.460\nYou'll be like, you'll be brushing your teeth again before you know it.\n\n01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:00.460\nIt'll go back to dating.\n\n01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:02.460\nYeah, you'll be dating.\n\n01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:03.460\nIt'll happen.\n\n01:27:03.460 --> 01:27:05.460\nAnd it doesn't matter if it goes good or goes bad.\n\n01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:09.460\nIt's not about bring the magic pack and all the spices, all that stuff.\n\n01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:15.460\nIt's just like, yeah, you guys are children, and you can, you'll sustain this.\n\n01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:20.460\nYeah, I guess my biggest concern is I've made steps to becoming an adult, a millennial adult.\n\n01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:22.460\nWhat have you done?\n\n01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:24.460\n401K?\n\n01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:26.460\nHe moved out of his parents.\n\n01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:30.460\nAnd I work at a bong shop, so those are two adults.\n\n01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:32.460\nThat's your individual, yeah.\n\n01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:34.460\nSo you do have a job?\n\n01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:38.460\nYes, but your job doesn't provide you enough to get your own place.\n\n01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:40.460\nExactly, yes.\n\n01:27:40.460 --> 01:27:41.460\nWhat?\n\n01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:43.460\nIt does suck.\n\n01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:49.460\nThere's a room full of people here that will forgive you for having to take backwards steps in terms of that.\n\n01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:55.460\nThe myth of you turning 18, leaving your parents' place and becoming a human being that creates other human beings.\n\n01:27:55.460 --> 01:28:00.460\nThat's all steeped in a time before they figured out how to really tap the workforce and exploit them.\n\n01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:01.460\nYou bet!\n\n01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:07.460\nYour generation now has seven jobs, and it's what the market will bear.\n\n01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:10.460\nI'm sure that's no different in any country you go to.\n\n01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:15.460\nIt's like, oh, they can all work, and they can all fuck off and be children until they're 80.\n\n01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:20.460\nThere's no shame in living with your parents until you're 70.\n\n01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:22.460\nThere's some shame in that.\n\n01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:24.460\nThere's some shame in that.\n\n01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:25.460\nThere's some shame in that.\n\n01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:26.460\nMaybe a little shame.\n\n01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:30.460\nBut I think as long as you're striving to whatever you're the next thing is you want to do,\n\n01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:35.460\nif it's a better bong shop where you get paid more, that's a thing.\n\n01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:38.460\nYou got to start your own bong shop, bro.\n\n01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:39.460\nYeah!\n\n01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:43.460\nWe're looking at legalization 2017 in Canada, so you never go.\n\n01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:44.460\nThat's amazing.\n\n01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:47.460\nSo then those bongs will be worthless.\n\n01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:48.460\nExactly.\n\n01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:51.460\nDo you think that the vape culture has hurt the bong culture?\n\n01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:52.460\n100% no, Jeff.\n\n01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:54.460\nI will fight that to a T.\n\n01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:56.460\nI didn't have an opinion.\n\n01:28:56.460 --> 01:28:58.460\nI would just...\n\n01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:00.460\nI get paid to have an opinion.\n\n01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:03.460\nI wasn't going fucking Hillary on you, man.\n\n01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:06.460\nWhere are you guys on Kratom?\n\n01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:09.460\nSpeaking of which, actually, I sell Kratom at my shop.\n\n01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:11.460\nNot for human consumption, of course.\n\n01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:15.460\nBut no, I have a lot of customers who seriously helps with their addictions.\n\n01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:17.460\nMethadone is a serious problem for a lot of people.\n\n01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:18.460\nI love this dude.\n\n01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:20.460\nIf you can find a natural substitute, hey, why not?\n\n01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:21.460\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:22.460\nThis is the direction you need to go in.\n\n01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:23.460\nLook how animated you've gotten.\n\n01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:24.460\nThis is like your passion.\n\n01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:25.460\nThis is where you need to go.\n\n01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:28.460\nWhy don't you plug where you work right now, and when there's a line outside tomorrow,\n\n01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:30.460\ntell your boss, I should be an associate something.\n\n01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:31.460\nYes, thank you.\n\n01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:32.460\nYes.\n\n01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:37.460\nI work at Pipe Dreams on George Street in Peterborough, 416 George Street North.\n\n01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:38.460\nCome see me.\n\n01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:41.460\nWe're locally owned and operated for 20 years, so hey.\n\n01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:42.460\nOh, it's a family shop.\n\n01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:43.460\nI like that.\n\n01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:46.460\nColin and Lauren's relationship is on GoFundMe.com.\n\n01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:47.460\nYeah!\n\n01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:54.460\nAnd Colin, I'll say at master's degree, couples and family therapy, and this is now what I'm\n\n01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:55.460\ndoing for a living.\n\n01:29:55.460 --> 01:29:56.460\nIt's always okay.\n\n01:29:56.460 --> 01:30:00.460\nIt's always okay to go in a random direction and not do the thing that you thought you\n\n01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:01.460\nwere supposed to do.\n\n01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:02.460\nYep.\n\n01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:03.460\nNever be afraid to start over.\n\n01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:07.460\nThat's all we're ever going to do over and over again.\n\n01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:12.460\nSorry, I didn't hear any of that.\n\n01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:14.460\nIt wasn't important.\n\n01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:15.460\nAbout me, Indies.\n\n01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:16.460\nIndies, hey.\n\n01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:21.460\nI was looking at my one note on my thing.\n\n01:30:21.460 --> 01:30:22.460\nLauren, what is your bag?\n\n01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:23.460\nWhat is your dream gig?\n\n01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:24.460\nWhat do you do?\n\n01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:25.460\nWhat's going on with you?\n\n01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:28.460\nI'm actually in school for psychology right now.\n\n01:30:28.460 --> 01:30:29.460\nOh, shit.\n\n01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:30.460\nOh.\n\n01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:31.460\nThere you go.\n\n01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:34.460\nI mean, do it for a few years, see what happens.\n\n01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:39.460\nSomeday you might be in Harmontown, but fuck, you already are.\n\n01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:41.460\nShe's so far ahead of you.\n\n01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:42.460\nGod damn it.\n\n01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:47.460\nYou ought to actually be at their best and practice for years to end up in Harmontown.\n\n01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:49.460\nYou may create a Harmontown.\n\n01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:50.460\nEmily created it.\n\n01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:52.460\nShe thought only down this podcast only existed as Emily.\n\n01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:54.460\nWe're only here because of Emily Gordon.\n\n01:30:54.460 --> 01:30:55.460\nEmily Gordon is the reason that-\n\n01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:56.460\nLook at that.\n\n01:30:56.460 --> 01:31:03.460\nIt's a little misleading, but I'll take the applause.\n\n01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:04.460\nThank you.\n\n01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:08.460\nEmily Gordon asked a recently fired from NBC, Dan Harmon.\n\n01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:09.460\nWould you want to do a show?\n\n01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:10.460\nWas that about 10 minutes?\n\n01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:15.460\nYeah, we were just at a bar and I was like, I'm running this theater in LA and I desperately\n\n01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:16.460\nneed shows.\n\n01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:19.460\nYou should just get on stage and talk and you're like, okay.\n\n01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:22.460\nI've been waiting for someone to say that.\n\n01:31:22.460 --> 01:31:26.460\nI thought it was supposed to be a shame to that.\n\n01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:32.460\nI would say it's become the thing that's what that theater is known for.\n\n01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:39.460\nCan we share like an anarcho-syndicalist kind of little society where Colin gives us bongs\n\n01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:48.460\nand Lauren and Emily give us psychological advice and Kumail does whatever Kumail does.\n\n01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:53.460\nI say things are racist.\n\n01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:54.460\nBut for free.\n\n01:31:54.460 --> 01:31:55.460\nBut for free.\n\n01:31:55.460 --> 01:31:56.460\nYou don't charge.\n\n01:31:56.460 --> 01:32:00.460\nIt's mutual reciprocity and we all just provide everything.\n\n01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:05.760\nI feel like for the vibe that we got on, we walked on stage and the amount of volume and\n\n01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:12.460\nlove that you get when you come into a Harmontown show, not to inflate this own balloon, but\n\n01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:17.460\nlike walking down the street and the people come up and be like, oh, shit, this is Harmontown.\n\n01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:21.060\nThere's a feeling of community there and I feel like there's a possibility that if we\n\n01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:25.460\nall just felt passionate and moved in or out of each other's apartments or back to their\n\n01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:30.300\nparents' apartments and all did whatever we all love to do, something fantastic, we could\n\n01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:31.300\nget back on.\n\n01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:33.300\nLet's run in there with 4,000 people from Ontario.\n\n01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:34.300\nAll right.\n\n01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:35.300\nWhat were they saying?\n\n01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:36.300\nThey'd say take off hoses.\n\n01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:37.300\nTake off hoses?\n\n01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:38.300\nThey'd say no.\n\n01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:39.300\nThese hoses aren't taking off.\n\n01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:40.300\nThese hoses are here to stay.\n\n01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:53.300\nThese hoses are, yeah, these hoses aren't taking on the system.\n\n01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:54.300\nLauren.\n\n01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:55.300\nIt's Lauren.\n\n01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:56.300\nYes.\n\n01:32:56.300 --> 01:33:03.300\nSo that house you're staying in, that's good practice for an aspiring mental health.\n\n01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:04.300\nYes.\n\n01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:09.300\nDo you think, do you think, do you, are they listening?\n\n01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:12.300\nI feel they really hope not.\n\n01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:13.300\nOkay.\n\n01:33:13.300 --> 01:33:15.300\nAre any of them here in the house tonight?\n\n01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:16.300\nNo.\n\n01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:17.300\nOh, God, no.\n\n01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:18.300\nAll of Colin's friends are here tonight.\n\n01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:24.300\nThis seemed like a great bunch.\n\n01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:27.300\nI feel like we got the wrong people on stage.\n\n01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:32.300\nWe have the Canadian Dave Kline over here.\n\n01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:35.300\nHe's fine down there.\n\n01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:38.300\nHe's fine down there.\n\n01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:39.300\nAll right.\n\n01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:40.300\nWell, let's keep moving forward.\n\n01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:42.300\nLet's hear it for Lauren and Colin.\n\n01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:43.300\nColin and Lauren.\n\n01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:45.300\nYou saved their relationship, Emily.\n\n01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:46.300\nGood job.\n\n01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:47.300\nAll right.\n\n01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:50.300\nWe're fucking, we're tearing up Toronto.\n\n01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:55.300\nI had, I had deep fried cauliflower tonight.\n\n01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:57.300\nOh, I had that yesterday.\n\n01:33:57.300 --> 01:34:01.300\nYou can fry cauliflower so deep that it doesn't matter that it's cauliflower.\n\n01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:02.300\nThat's true.\n\n01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:04.300\nIt may as well be beef, delicious beef.\n\n01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:07.300\nYou can put, I had it with buffalo sauce and it was unbelievable.\n\n01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:08.300\nDeep fried cauliflower.\n\n01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:09.300\nYou're so good.\n\n01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:11.300\nYou can get that Mohawk bent back.\n\n01:34:11.300 --> 01:34:12.300\nMohawk bent.\n\n01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:13.300\nAll right.\n\n01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:14.300\nOh, I wanted to ask.\n\n01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:15.300\nIt's good.\n\n01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:16.300\nNot a local reference.\n\n01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:17.300\nSorry, guys.\n\n01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:20.300\nI, I, I wanted to ask you Canadians.\n\n01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:21.300\nAll right.\n\n01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:27.300\nDo you guys, are you, are you aware of the church of the Latter-day Saints?\n\n01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:33.300\nHave you heard the good news about menonitism?\n\n01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:38.300\nThe great God Menon who provides you with cologne and shaving equipment.\n\n01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:44.300\nThe smoothest shaved profit in all of Canada.\n\n01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:47.300\nAh, menon.\n\n01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:56.300\nUh, the, the, uh, uh, the, are you, are you guys, there's no way you're, are you even\n\n01:34:56.300 --> 01:34:59.300\nfamiliar with JonBenét Ramsey?\n\n01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:02.300\nThat's a weird reaction.\n\n01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:03.300\nThat's a weird reaction.\n\n01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:07.300\nThis seems like a crazy thing to bring up two hours into a show.\n\n01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:08.300\nIs it true?\n\n01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:13.300\nIt's even crazier thing to cheer for like they just said YouTube was coming on stage.\n\n01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:14.300\nYeah.\n\n01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:15.300\nWell, they just did a hole.\n\n01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:16.300\nAre you into true crime?\n\n01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:17.300\nLove true crime.\n\n01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:18.300\nHaven't watched that, but love true crime stuff.\n\n01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:19.300\nDid you watch the John Benet thing?\n\n01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:20.300\nNo, I don't know.\n\n01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:21.300\nIs it good?\n\n01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:29.020\nThere's a guy, Dr. Henry Lee, who's a forensic wizard who has a very, very thick accent.\n\n01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:34.420\nLike he's Chinese and he, like he clearly has dedicated most of his brain to like, like\n\n01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:37.300\nstudying forensics and like, it's.\n\n01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:40.300\nWell, what, like, what does he sound like?\n\n01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:43.300\nI think it would go a little something.\n\n01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:44.300\nYeah.\n\n01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:45.300\nGo ahead.\n\n01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:46.300\nLike this.\n\n01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:47.300\nIn his voice.\n\n01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:48.300\nLet's see.\n\n01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:49.300\nLet's see.\n\n01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:50.300\nLet's see.\n\n01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:51.300\nWe're talking about cast off patterns of blood on the wall.\n\n01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:52.300\nYeah.\n\n01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:53.300\nMaybe it was done.\n\n01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:54.300\nLet's do something.\n\n01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:55.300\nI mean, just do something.\n\n01:35:55.300 --> 01:35:56.300\nI guess you're a fan of the gentleman.\n\n01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:57.300\nYeah.\n\n01:35:57.300 --> 01:35:58.300\nLet's say something really inoffensive.\n\n01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:00.300\nHe's a waiter at a Chinese restaurant.\n\n01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:03.300\nA faithful impression.\n\n01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:08.300\nTechnically, I was going to culminate this in doing an impression of him.\n\n01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:09.300\nOkay.\n\n01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:10.300\nAll right.\n\n01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:13.300\nBut it won't be racist because it's that one guy.\n\n01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:15.300\nIt's not a whole race.\n\n01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:18.300\nI'm actually, I'm just, this is just a personal attack.\n\n01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:21.300\nThis is a personal.\n\n01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:26.300\nAnyway, there's filthy Chinese guy.\n\n01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:28.300\nWhat was he saying?\n\n01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:30.300\nHe's a genius in his feet.\n\n01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:38.300\nHe walks into a bar with a, with a, with a Nobel prize winning pollock and a, and a very\n\n01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:39.300\nnurturing rabbi.\n\n01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:41.300\nAnd the bartender just comes everywhere.\n\n01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:42.300\nIt hits the ceiling.\n\n01:36:42.300 --> 01:36:43.300\nOn the ceiling.\n\n01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:44.300\nYeah.\n\n01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:45.300\nOkay.\n\n01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:46.300\nGo ahead.\n\n01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:47.300\nSorry.\n\n01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:53.300\nLook, you, they were talking about the kid like John Panay, like, like, like, like, it\n\n01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:57.300\ncomes down to this bowl of pineapple and, uh, are you serious?\n\n01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:58.300\nYeah.\n\n01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:03.300\nLike the kid, the brother is like eating pineapple and they like, that's a theory that like, because\n\n01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:07.300\nshe had some pineapple in her stomach that was digested on a certain amount that, you\n\n01:37:07.300 --> 01:37:11.300\nknow, if you do a timeline, it's like, well, they're just like, is it?\n\n01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:13.300\nAnd so Dr. Henry Lee is explaining.\n\n01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:18.300\nHe's like, like the theory of like, what if the brother got really mad, the nine year\n\n01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:23.300\nold brother that she took a piece of pineapple out of his, out of his bowl?\n\n01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:24.300\nWell, hold on, sir.\n\n01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:28.300\nI heard somebody, I'm fascinated that you're agitated by.\n\n01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:30.300\nI'm not, I'm not making fun of you.\n\n01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:33.300\nSo the theory is, that might be, but like, Dr. Henry Lee is here tonight.\n\n01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:38.300\nHe's like, he's explaining, he's going like, like, how did she get clobbered in the back\n\n01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:40.300\nof the head with a heavy object?\n\n01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:42.300\nAnd like, like, what does it have to do with the pineapple?\n\n01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:49.300\nAnd he's explaining and he says, uh, well, how about this?\n\n01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:56.300\nShe come, she take, he say, don't steal my papal.\n\n01:37:56.300 --> 01:37:57.300\nPapal?\n\n01:37:57.300 --> 01:37:58.300\nThat's it.\n\n01:37:58.300 --> 01:37:59.300\nPapal?\n\n01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:03.300\nI've never heard so many consonants removed from a word.\n\n01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:08.300\nI guess just one, but it's, it's just like such a, don't, don't steal my papal.\n\n01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:09.300\nThat's a key consonant.\n\n01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:12.300\nHe's miming a nine year old killing a six year old.\n\n01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:15.300\nAnd he's just like, it's just like, this is so much glee and he's so smart.\n\n01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:17.300\nAnd he's like, and it's like, it's just adorable.\n\n01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:19.300\nLike I wanted to make it like a little meme.\n\n01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:22.300\nLike, don't steal my papal.\n\n01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:28.300\nSo his theory is that the brother was eating a bowl of papal.\n\n01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:29.300\nThe brother was.\n\n01:38:29.300 --> 01:38:30.300\nNo, the brother was.\n\n01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:31.300\nNo, the brother was.\n\n01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:32.300\nAnd the sister took the papal.\n\n01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:33.300\nAnd she stole that papal.\n\n01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:34.300\nAnd then he, that's his theory.\n\n01:38:34.300 --> 01:38:36.300\nAnd then there was like a giant eight pound maglite.\n\n01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:38.300\nAnd he, with his nine year old Peter Parker.\n\n01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:39.300\nWhat there was.\n\n01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:40.300\nHe was like, fuck you.\n\n01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:43.300\nWhat there was was an empty bowl of pineapple.\n\n01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:44.300\nHe used that to kill her.\n\n01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:45.300\nThat's the burner weapon.\n\n01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:46.300\nOkay.\n\n01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:47.300\nWhat do you do?\n\n01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:48.300\nWhat do you do?\n\n01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:49.300\nWould you just making that shit up?\n\n01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:53.300\nThere was a full bowl of pineapple that supports the theory that's that, that shit was interrupted.\n\n01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:54.300\nThat next night.\n\n01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:55.300\nOh, we interrupted the papal.\n\n01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:59.300\nIt was sitting there and then they show the brother, like they show him, like they're\n\n01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:03.300\nreviewing the case and they show him a picture of the, of the crime scene, but not the crime\n\n01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:05.300\nscene, but the, the, from the house.\n\n01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:07.300\nAnd they show him, there's a bowl of pineapple.\n\n01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:08.300\nThey go, what's that?\n\n01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:09.300\nAnd he's like, I don't know.\n\n01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:12.300\nHe didn't, no idea what pineapple is because he's fucked.\n\n01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:13.300\nHe's like, man.\n\n01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:14.300\nOh shit.\n\n01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:17.300\nThat, that's the most important fruit in the world.\n\n01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:19.300\nSo the whole family is involved in disposing of her body.\n\n01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:21.300\nI think they covered it up, right?\n\n01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:23.300\nThe, the brother killed her by mistake.\n\n01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:27.300\nIt kind of emerges as a, as a, I'm not going to say an uplifting story, but it kind of,\n\n01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:30.300\nlike, when you look back on it, you go like, I think what we're about to do is one of the\n\n01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:32.300\ngreatest improv reenactments of all time.\n\n01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:33.300\nNo.\n\n01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:34.300\nNo.\n\n01:39:34.300 --> 01:39:35.300\nNo.\n\n01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:36.300\nIt's a story.\n\n01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:38.300\nIt's a story that must be told.\n\n01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:39.300\nI don't know.\n\n01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:41.300\nIt goes to JonBenét Ramsey.\n\n01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:43.300\nHe's like, no, please.\n\n01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:44.300\nI know.\n\n01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:45.300\nI know.\n\n01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:46.300\nI can't.\n\n01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:47.300\nI know.\n\n01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:48.300\nGood can come with that.\n\n01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:50.300\nI think we'll all wake up with cancer.\n\n01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:55.300\nLike, like, that makes us all worse than everyone.\n\n01:39:55.300 --> 01:39:59.300\nBut they did in this show, this CBS show that they did this two part.\n\n01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:04.300\nAnd one of the things they did is they, they're demonstrating like the, how the wound was\n\n01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:09.300\nmade and they have, like everybody agrees that the low point of this thing was they put\n\n01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:13.300\na, they put a blonde wig on a pig head.\n\n01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:14.300\nLike the Mythbusters.\n\n01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:21.300\nAnd had a child actor boy that was the right age come in, hold the flash money.\n\n01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:22.300\nNo.\n\n01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:28.300\nAnd the, our friends Karen Kilgariff from Georgia from, from my favorite murder are describing\n\n01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:31.300\nthat and they're like, they're like, yeah, he's a child actor.\n\n01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:33.300\nSo he's already somewhere else.\n\n01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:39.300\nAnd the look at, and he's such a good boy, child actor, clubbing a pig head in a wig\n\n01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:42.300\nwith a mag light to demonstrate how it would have been.\n\n01:40:42.300 --> 01:40:44.300\nI can't wait to see his one man show.\n\n01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:45.300\nIt's going to be great.\n\n01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:46.300\nYeah.\n\n01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:48.300\nThat sounds like the role of a lifetime.\n\n01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:49.300\nYeah.\n\n01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:52.300\nThe show is called a papaladay.\n\n01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:53.300\nOkay.\n\n01:40:53.300 --> 01:40:55.300\nWell, how about this pen apple thing, huh?\n\n01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:57.300\nThis, that crazy guy doing that dance.\n\n01:40:57.300 --> 01:40:59.300\nYou guys familiar with that viral thing?\n\n01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:01.300\nI saw it and I was like, you know what?\n\n01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:02.300\nSome things I don't need to click on.\n\n01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:03.300\nSo I didn't click on it.\n\n01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:04.300\nWhat it is.\n\n01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:06.300\nIf you clicked on it, it would go like this.\n\n01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:07.300\nI have an apple.\n\n01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:09.300\nI have a pen.\n\n01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:11.300\nI got an apple pen.\n\n01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:13.300\nI got a pen.\n\n01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:15.300\nI got a pineapple.\n\n01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:17.300\nIt's totally coincidence.\n\n01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:19.300\nI got a pen pineapple.\n\n01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:21.300\nI don't really know the actual how it goes.\n\n01:41:21.300 --> 01:41:22.300\nWait.\n\n01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:24.300\nBut it's very catchy.\n\n01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:27.300\nOh, the new Gangnam style or whatever.\n\n01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:29.300\nYeah, it's kind of the new Gangnam style.\n\n01:41:29.300 --> 01:41:30.300\nGangnam style?\n\n01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:32.300\nIt's kind of the new Gangnam style.\n\n01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:36.300\nCan you take that again?\n\n01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:40.300\nIt's sort of a bat mitzvah for a Gangnam style.\n\n01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:43.300\nI think.\n\n01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:46.300\nI love Canada.\n\n01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:48.300\nI love Ontario.\n\n01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:51.300\nI think it's my favorite province.\n\n01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:53.300\nYeah?\n\n01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:57.300\nWhat is the capital of Canada?\n\n01:41:57.300 --> 01:42:00.300\nAlberta.\n\n01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:02.300\nNo, Alberta is a province, right?\n\n01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:04.300\nCalgary is one of the...\n\n01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:08.300\nToronto is the most populous city in all of Canada.\n\n01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:11.300\nOkay, that's a good Toronto fact.\n\n01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:14.300\nIt has a hockey museum.\n\n01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:16.300\nNo shit.\n\n01:42:16.300 --> 01:42:18.300\nAnd a CN tower.\n\n01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:22.300\nOh yeah, you can walk up above.\n\n01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:24.300\nAnd it's...\n\n01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:26.300\nThat was a call back to my show.\n\n01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:29.300\nThat's how many people are here from the...\n\n01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:31.300\nThese guys have been here all night.\n\n01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:33.300\nSo many people stayed here.\n\n01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:35.300\nWell, we wanted to write by them.\n\n01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:38.300\nWe wanted to send them home.\n\n01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:41.300\nYou should freestyle and that will be it.\n\n01:42:41.300 --> 01:42:45.300\nHow about a really fast D&D?\n\n01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:48.300\nSpencer, could you freestyle?\n\n01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:51.300\nJust for you guys.\n\n01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:54.300\nWe only have like...\n\n01:42:54.300 --> 01:42:56.300\nWe have to be done in four minutes.\n\n01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:59.300\nThat sounds like a lot of fun.\n\n01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:02.300\nBefore we jump on the plane, Jeff,\n\n01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:04.300\nI gave you the character sheets, right?\n\n01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:06.300\nHand them out.\n\n01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:08.300\nHere they are.\n\n01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:10.300\nSpencer, take us to the dungeon.\n\n01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:14.300\nYou find yourself outside of a waffle iron.\n\n01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:17.300\nThat's it.\n\n01:43:17.300 --> 01:43:21.300\nShould we go in?\n\n01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:25.300\nI use trap sense on the waffle iron hinges.\n\n01:43:25.300 --> 01:43:28.300\nIt's a waffle iron.\n\n01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:30.300\nWhat did you find out?\n\n01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:32.300\nWaffle iron seems safe.\n\n01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:34.300\nLet's go inside the waffle iron.\n\n01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:36.300\nWhat a waffle.\n\n01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:38.300\nIs it open?\n\n01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:40.300\nIt opens.\n\n01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:42.300\nWe open it.\n\n01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:44.300\nAre we bigger than it?\n\n01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:46.300\nIt's a waffle iron.\n\n01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:51.300\nI thought waffle iron was maybe a chain of restaurants here.\n\n01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:53.300\nThat's what I thought, too.\n\n01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:55.300\nI was thinking waffle house.\n\n01:43:55.300 --> 01:44:01.300\nMy character is a third level IT engineer.\n\n01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:06.300\nIt opens the waffle iron and says,\n\n01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:08.300\nguys, look.\n\n01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:11.300\nThe Teflon scratched.\n\n01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:13.300\nThat's fucked up.\n\n01:44:13.300 --> 01:44:15.300\nThat can make you sick.\n\n01:44:15.300 --> 01:44:17.300\nI'm a hypochondriac, fourth level.\n\n01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:19.300\nFourth level hypochondriac?\n\n01:44:19.300 --> 01:44:21.300\nIs that true? Scratched Teflon?\n\n01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:23.300\nYeah, it can give you the flu.\n\n01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:29.300\nThe stakes are so low for this D&D adventure.\n\n01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:33.300\nI'm a 14th level mage,\n\n01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:39.300\nand I cast a heel of feet of cold strava fever\n\n01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:41.300\non Emily's character.\n\n01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:42.300\nI don't think it worked.\n\n01:44:42.300 --> 01:44:43.300\nI don't think it took.\n\n01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:45.300\nIt didn't work.\n\n01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:47.300\nI'm a level 7 vegan.\n\n01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:49.300\nOh, my God.\n\n01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:51.300\nHave you been a vegan girlfriend?\n\n01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:54.300\nI have a recipe where we can make a waffle\n\n01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:57.300\nthat won't like rape any animals.\n\n01:44:57.300 --> 01:45:00.300\nIs there...\n\n01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:02.300\nI look around the waffle iron.\n\n01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:04.300\nIs there more stuff here?\n\n01:45:04.300 --> 01:45:06.300\nThere's a counter.\n\n01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:08.300\nOh, you're in a kitchen.\n\n01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:09.300\nDid I say that?\n\n01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:10.300\nOh.\n\n01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:11.300\nOkay, you're in a kitchen.\n\n01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:14.300\nYou're outside of a waffle iron.\n\n01:45:14.300 --> 01:45:17.300\nIs there an Elmira anywhere around?\n\n01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:19.300\nIt's a strange way to put it.\n\n01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:22.300\nIt makes it sound like the waffle iron is a destination.\n\n01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:24.300\nNo argument.\n\n01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:26.300\nThat's absolutely the case.\n\n01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:29.300\nI look around for the nearest Elmira.\n\n01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:30.300\nSay again?\n\n01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:31.300\nThe nearest Elmira.\n\n01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:34.300\nThat's a Pakistani cupboard.\n\n01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:36.300\nYou open it.\n\n01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:39.300\nThere's canned food.\n\n01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:42.300\nGuys, there's cans and food in here.\n\n01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:44.300\nIs there anything to make waffle batter?\n\n01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:45.300\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:45:45.300 --> 01:45:47.300\nThere's a box of Bisquick.\n\n01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:48.300\nIt's in a can.\n\n01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:50.300\nAnd I think you only need water to mix with Bisquick.\n\n01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:52.300\nDoes that have animal parts?\n\n01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:53.300\nBisquick?\n\n01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:54.300\nI hope not.\n\n01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:55.300\nI don't think so.\n\n01:45:55.300 --> 01:45:57.300\nI examine the ingredients.\n\n01:45:57.300 --> 01:46:02.300\nIs it vegan?\n\n01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:06.300\nI use detect non-vegan products.\n\n01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:08.300\nIt's non-vegan.\n\n01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:11.300\nAlso, that's the ingredient salsa says that.\n\n01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:13.300\nIt's non-vegan.\n\n01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:19.300\nI do a 20-minute speech about why veganism is important.\n\n01:46:19.300 --> 01:46:24.300\nI explain my gluten allergy.\n\n01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:29.300\nI take a picture of Kumail's character while he's doing the 20-minute thing,\n\n01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:34.300\nand I upload it with the sunrise filter.\n\n01:46:34.300 --> 01:46:36.300\nOoh, pretty.\n\n01:46:36.300 --> 01:46:41.300\nYou get 26 likes.\n\n01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:42.300\nDamn it, Spencer.\n\n01:46:42.300 --> 01:46:44.300\nYou're the best person.\n\n01:46:44.300 --> 01:46:48.300\nYou get four comments, but they're all the comments where they're just\n\n01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:52.300\nat replying some fucking random person.\n\n01:46:52.300 --> 01:46:58.300\nSo I see if I can figure out who the patient zero of this comment thread is.\n\n01:46:58.300 --> 01:47:01.300\nIt's patient underscore zero.\n\n01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:06.300\nWhat is that person's comment that's tipping off this controversy?\n\n01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:09.300\nAt patient underscore one.\n\n01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:11.300\nIs one spelled out, or is it the number one?\n\n01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:12.300\nIt's the word one.\n\n01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:13.300\nOkay.\n\n01:47:13.300 --> 01:47:14.300\nWait, that's their comment?\n\n01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:15.300\nThey just...\n\n01:47:15.300

01:47:26.300\nAre we making waffles or not, you guys?\n\n01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:27.300\nI closed that app.\n\n01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:29.300\nYeah.\n\n01:47:29.300 --> 01:47:33.300\nI see, is there a new update for my Apple Watch?\n\n01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:34.300\nNo.\n\n01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:35.300\nOkay.\n\n01:47:35.300 --> 01:47:38.300\nI've finished my speech about veganism.\n\n01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:39.300\nAgain.\n\n01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:43.300\nEveryone is convinced of the power of your words.\n\n01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:48.300\nI take out my staff of golden rage.\n\n01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:51.300\nWe're just a weapon I just made up.\n\n01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:52.300\nYeah.\n\n01:47:52.300 --> 01:47:54.300\nAnd I strike the waffle iron.\n\n01:47:54.300 --> 01:47:57.300\nIt goes into a rage.\n\n01:47:57.300 --> 01:47:59.300\nThe waffle iron does?\n\n01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:00.300\nYeah.\n\n01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:01.300\nThat's what it does.\n\n01:48:01.300 --> 01:48:02.300\nOh, no.\n\n01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:06.300\nWait, does my staff of golden rage give rage to other things?\n\n01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:09.300\nGolden rage, yeah.\n\n01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:11.300\nLike golden.\n\n01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:14.300\nAll right.\n\n01:48:14.300 --> 01:48:22.300\nLet's hear it for Emily Gordon, Kumail Nanjiani.\n\n01:48:22.300 --> 01:48:25.300\nJeff from the Antacid
