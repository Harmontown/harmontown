WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
Who's got a pen? I need to steal a pen from somebody. Can you tell me a pen, brother?

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
From Burbank, California, at Starburn's Castle, it's the very first time that Harmontown is in session

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
from the beautiful confines of the weird, warehouse-y thing that is Starburn's Castle.

00:27.000 --> 00:34.000
Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden and Charlie.

00:34.000 --> 00:41.000
What up? Oh, yeah. It feels good, doesn't it? It feels in session.

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
It feels extra sexy. Speaking of extra sexy, let's bring out the mayor.

00:48.000 --> 00:57.000
The mayor of Harmontown is Dan Harmon. Thank you.

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
All right. Thanks for joining us at a temporary location or whatever, an experimental location.

01:05.000 --> 01:13.000
Is it not permanent? What's the status? I don't know. I don't make big moves. I work organically.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.000
Why do they call you big moves, Harmon? It's an ironic nickname. In prison, they called me tiny,

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
because the average height is 5'5", and I was like, you know.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
So how was prison? Prison was great. What were you in for again?

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
I started watching the show, what the hell is it called, World's Most Dangerous Prisons,

01:35.000 --> 01:42.000
or Inside Them or something like that? It's called Inside Them, Colin, World's Most Dangerous Prisons.

01:42.000 --> 01:52.000
It's some guy who is kind of, he's from wherever the, what the shrimpy guy,

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
what's his name, he's in the phone booth thing where he's got to talk on the phone or he gets shot.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
Colin Farrell. Colin Farrell. It's this guy that looks like him.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
He's shrimpy?

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
He's a little shrimp. I don't think he's a large man. I don't think Colin Farrell.

02:06.000 --> 02:13.000
They call him a moose.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
There's a guy and then he goes and he gets himself locked up in the world's most dangerous prisons

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
throughout the world. There's a prison in Honduras, I guess that's the murder capital of the world.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
That's probably an easy title to claim, like best pizza or whatever.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
But the prison there, it's like built for like, I don't know, let's say 70 people,

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
I'm pulling numbers out of my ass. There's like 700 people in it.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
It's like very overcrowded as most prisons are. We are generating more bad people than good people these days.

02:42.000 --> 02:50.000
It's a buyer's market. They, at a certain point, it's like, it's escaped from New York.

02:50.000 --> 02:59.000
They like, the guards pulled out and they just like rolled wooden batons like by the box in there

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
and said like, whoever the people you trust the most are, they're the new guards.

03:04.000 --> 03:12.000
And so some of the murderers have sticks and that's their system and it works really well.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
Like the guards can't go in there. They go in there at night to lock up.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
I guess they have like, it's sort of like...

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Wouldn't the bad guys get the sticks first?

03:24.000 --> 03:31.000
The bad guys have the sticks, as one would argue in all of society.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
It just kind of tends to be that way. Good guys don't want sticks.

03:35.000 --> 03:44.000
And so in this prison, some of the rapists and murderers have been deputized to beat the other ones that get out of line.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
But they're deputizing each other? They're saying, hey, crazy guy, you like sticks, how do they pick it?

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
I don't know how they picked it. There's a guy at the top that insists he profits nothing from it.

03:57.000 --> 04:04.000
Who says, well, telling you, if you want a bed, it costs $135 and all this stuff.

04:04.000 --> 04:10.000
The whole place has a kind of... I mean, there was no... Everyone's like lifting weights and everything's very scary

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
and everyone's kind of leering at you. But what you didn't see was like mass chaos.

04:15.000 --> 04:22.000
And it was just this Colin Farrell looking guy going like, oh, I'm filling buckets of water.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
And then he would go and talk to all the mucky mucks within this system, none of whom are guards.

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
And then he'd shoot pool with the guards on the outside of the system that the guards are guarding but can't get in.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
The guards' job? To make sure that all 700 of these people don't at some point go, hey, there's 700 of us.

04:39.000 --> 04:45.000
Let's all escape at the same time. That is their single task is to keep that day from happening.

04:45.000 --> 04:54.000
How they do that? I guess it has something to do with the fact that what separates the prison from the rest of Honduras,

04:54.000 --> 05:02.000
which is like a chain link fence that you had at your grade school playground, which drugs are just flying back and forth over the top of it.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
I think the people in there are kind of happy. The prisoners are... I mean, they're like...

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
They'd like to be out if they could leave any time they wanted, but they can't leave any time they wanted,

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
so they've created a society for themselves that includes weekend-long conjugal visits.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
The wives and children come to visit them. They showed that weekend happening.

05:20.000 --> 05:27.000
And there's no, if you fuck with the wives or children during that weekend, it's like...

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
Obviously, there's repercussions. There's repercussions if you piss off fucking murderers that have sticks.

05:33.000 --> 05:41.000
I'm doing... The law is laid down within that prison, and then the guards shooting billiards with the host of the show

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
who's saying, like, how's it... Do you guys want to have control back?

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
Because one time they tried to take control back, and everyone just went...

05:51.000 --> 05:57.000
And waved their shirts around like strippers and threw garbage cans at them, and they had to leave.

05:57.000 --> 06:05.000
They're like, okay, all right, we'll come look for drugs later. And they were like, yay, we're in prison!

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
We're free!

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
How do you think you would handle prison if you had to do, like, real time, like federal time?

06:11.000 --> 06:17.000
I would start by killing myself the day I was sentenced to prison, because guys like me do not...

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
No matter what movies you've seen.

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
Now, okay, let's get specific. Day one, you're in prison. You go, okay, I want to kill myself.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
I'm going to be here for six years. I want to kill myself. How do you do it?

06:29.000 --> 06:35.000
Wait, no, no, no, I do it in court when the judge says, you're going to print, and I go, bang, bang, bang!

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
I take his gavel and I stick it through my eyeball.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
Because if he did the print, I knew the rest of the word would be isn't.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
So I'm just like, gouge, gouge.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
Do you think you could make it from the desk you sit at to the gavel?

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Without a bailiff?

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
I mean, look, if Batman was in the gallery, you know, in one movie where Batman couldn't even make it

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
to protect Harvey Dent from getting his face toed.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Remember that movie? Batman's in court.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
It was Batman outfit.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
They explained Harvey Dent's turning into Two-Face.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
It was one of those older Batman movies.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
There was a mafia guy, and he had a reveal.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
He had a jar of poison on the witness stand, and he went, hey!

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
And then it cut to Batman in the court going, no!

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
And then it cut to Harvey Dent going, yikes!

07:27.000 --> 07:35.000
And holding a Manila folder across half of his face, hence his transformation into Two-Face.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
A folder?

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
Yeah, I guess it's an older movie than you kids have seen.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
That was the Dark Knight Rises, right? Returns or something?

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
This was the second of these Nolan Batman movies.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
No, no, I don't think it was a Nolan movie.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
I think that was a...

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Doesn't he hold up a folder in that new one, too?

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
I think it's a folder.

07:58.000 --> 08:04.000
I think everyone holds up a folder when Bane takes over because he goes like, I give you back your city!

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
Hold your folders high!

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
And everyone holds up a folder.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
I think that's what you're thinking of.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
So Dan, you're a new gun owner.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Say what?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
You got a weapon now. You got a gun.

08:16.000 --> 08:24.000
I haven't picked it up yet because it seems like it's as hard to usurp democracy as it is to maintain it.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
I feel like this whole country is just going to collapse.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
Were you getting a gun to overthrow democracy?

08:31.000 --> 08:44.000
I was getting a gun to protect my soup and women in the event of total economic destabilization,

08:44.000 --> 08:53.000
which might result in my neighborhood looking up at my home, which looks like Victor Frankenstein's home,

08:53.000 --> 09:00.000
like in a village of people who only know that I've been robbing their graves to assemble some sort of monster.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
I just wanted to have a power tool in my home that can make...

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Drills, holes, and faces.

09:08.000 --> 09:14.000
And people that want water, you know, more than they want politeness.

09:14.000 --> 09:20.000
Do you have fantasies about, like, actually, like, you must, because you've bought a gun.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
What would happen if somebody came up your steps and demanded your water from your weapon?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
No, I would argue that that is fallacious logic.

09:27.000 --> 09:33.000
I bought the gun because I don't have fantasies about what I'd do if shit went that far.

09:33.000 --> 09:41.000
That's why I wanted to buy the gun is from the impulse of feeling like I am not a person that could be relied upon

09:41.000 --> 09:48.000
in a situation of such heightened crisis that, you know, so, no, I don't sit and think,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
man, I hope a guy comes up my sidewalk.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Well, I'm not saying you hope that happens, but like...

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
No, but I also have an entertain...

09:54.000 --> 10:08.000
I just have a vague cloud of chaos in my head where I'm like, well, look what has happened in the first 10 days of this presidency

10:08.000 --> 10:14.000
made me look at the 10-day waiting period that you need to get a gun as a crucial 10 days.

10:14.000 --> 10:22.000
And I now have what makes me feel very comfortable, which is a one-day, a drive to Burbank waiting period.

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
I have a gun waiting for me in a store run by guys who know how to use guns.

10:27.000 --> 10:33.000
I wanted to, you know, so I'm saying like, I'm feeling better now.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Maybe that's what the waiting period is for.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
It's sitting over there.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
I can go pick it up any time.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
It's probably better there than in my cabinet.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
When you were shopping around for, like, on our little Slack...

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
What is Slack?

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
Slack, it's a coordinating app for communicating with teens.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
No, teams.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Teams.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
I was thinking of Snapchat.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
You're thinking of 4chan.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Yeah.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
There's the Burbank firing line, which I've been to a couple of times.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
I'm not a gun guy, but I've shot there a couple of times with friends that have guns.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
It's fun to go shoot a gun, but I wouldn't ever want one.

11:12.000 --> 11:19.000
But I just found out that gun, indoor firing ranges, there's loads of fucking suicides.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
People go in there and they've had three suicides.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Oh, people actually go there to kill themselves.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
No, they go in there to rent a bullet.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
They go, oh, here's my credit card. I'll be right back.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
And they go, bang!

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
And they fucking shoot their fucking brains all over the person next to them.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
And there's been three suicides with the firing line recently.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
And apparently that's not just there. It's everywhere.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
Now, what do we think of that person? Is that person a bad person? Is that person a...

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Yeah, they suck.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
I think that person is a good planner.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
I'm glad they don't shoot other people. It'd be so easy.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
And then, you know, it's just the people who would be at a gun range, so it's not like zeroes.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Right. Well, that's the first thing.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
They're revealing that in the throes of depression enough that life means absolutely nothing to them,

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
that they don't do something that you could do if you thought life meant nothing,

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
which is cheat at the Grand Theft Auto game of life and just go bling, blang, bloom, bloom,

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
like just to see what would happen before you boo-boomed.

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
So, in a way, gun ranges provide a valuable, like, suicide-booth service.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
I just think that's really interesting.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
I don't think I could ever go back to a firing range and be relaxed.

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
I'm not relaxed because you're holding a gun. It's stressful.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
The firing line in Burbank on Victory, I think, I went there once.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
I'd never fired a gun. They said,

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Sir, have you ever fired a weapon before? I said, No, I haven't.

12:36.000 --> 12:42.000
They go, All right, so fill this out. You have to sign some waivers and shit.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
And they said, The first thing that you're going to shoot here is the.357 Magnum,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
which is a cannon.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
And this is to teach you some respect.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
And it was fucking bonkers.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
That thing is so loud and so scary that I couldn't ever relax.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
But now, if I think that the guy next to me might just go,

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
I want to fucking kill myself.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Well, I think you're going to laugh when I say this,

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
but there's something very uplifting about that.

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
Because we're constantly talking to, we're arguing between people,

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
like, well, in a pre-Trump era, there was a big religious connotation

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
that had to do with the division between the left and the right,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
particularly in the idea of like,

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
Oh, what are we going to do if there's no God, there's no morality in all this stuff?

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
And like the, you know, practical minded atheists among us,

13:34.000 --> 13:40.000
the people, it's like, I don't need a bookie man or a fairy tale

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
or a superstition, not to devalue anything that anyone has a personal relationship with,

13:45.000 --> 13:51.000
but I'm just saying like, people don't need that in order to do the cool thing,

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
to do the nice thing.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
An argument could be made that people are particularly geared to,

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
as a perfect example of a situation, you're holding a gun,

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
there's literally a lane of people on either side of you.

14:04.000 --> 14:11.000
You've come here because you have decided that life itself means so little.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
You obviously aren't fearing that you're going to wake up in a pool of lava

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
with like pitchforks going up your butt,

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
because those people definitely make sure you know that suicide's one of the things

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
that will make that happen.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
So you have made your peace with chaos.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
You have made your peace with oblivion.

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
You have an emotional thing going on in your head with a pain of living is so high

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
that you just want it to end.

14:34.000 --> 14:40.000
And you don't, as you step out the door, do this horrible, trollish thing.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
You know, that is not what most of us want to do.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
We are not held in line by getting away with it.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
There's no cops in this room.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
There's no cops like, there's no cops in this room.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
Whee!

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
If there's one outside, he wouldn't let me walk in that door.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
There are paid employees of Harmontown that could fucking kill you

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
if I snap my fingers.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Do not heckle me.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
But there are no cops in this room, man.

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
But it's like we are not held in line by, you know, we are not animals.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
And these Honduran prisoners are, you know,

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
the guy is cutting vegetables with a guy that killed someone with a machete.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
And he's saying, it's weird, I'm cutting cucumbers,

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
and you cut someone with a machete.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
And he's like, huh, what the hell, yeah!

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
So true!

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
Chop, chop, chop, chop.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
I don't know how that supported my point,

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
but it was just something that popped in my head.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
It's a reason why I want to keep watching this series.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Are you getting a gun, Spencer?

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
I don't know. Should I get a gun, you guys?

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
No. I think I heard one yes and one no.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
So there it is.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
No, you posted a very...

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
You're very passionately anti-gun.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
I know a lot of things.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
And here's what I know.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Guns kill people.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
I don't want to kill people.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
I got to say, Dan, I know you don't like being like a game-stated,

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
but I don't like the gun thing.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
It makes me uncomfortable.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
The decision to get a gun is not a thing

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
that I don't expect to be game-stated on, okay?

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
So you're right. I don't like to be game-stated.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
What the fuck is game-stated?

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
It's for the apocalypse.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
I brought it up as a confessional thing

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
because I consider that purchase a...

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
I'm confessing about it.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
I'm not telling people that I did the smartest thing in the world

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
that I recommend everyone do.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
I'm sharing with people

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
that these are crazy times

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
and that we're all dealing with it in weird ways

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
and that liberals are becoming anti-Nazis

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
and anti-Nazis are becoming Nazis

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
and the people who used to say

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
maybe freedom of speech is overrated

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
are now saying, I love the Second Amendment.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
It's confusing times and we're scared

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
and how are we dealing with it and what do we do?

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
I wanted to...

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
I'm not a person with solutions

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
and I'm not a pundit and I'm not an academic.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
I dropped out of college

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
so I'm going to share what I'm going through.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
I'm not going to leave a fucking molecule out of it.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
I bought a gun.

17:24.000 --> 17:31.000
I bought a gun because that's how close

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
to the doomsday line it feels,

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
the clock thing with the doomsday clock.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
What do they call it? The doomsday clock.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
I bought a gun because of the unknown.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
I didn't buy a gun because I thought

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
anything specific was going to happen.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
I bought a gun because for my entire life

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
of should I buy a gun,

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
the pachinko ball of logic always ended

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
with of course not.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
And now we are in times where it landed somewhere else

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
and I think that's notable.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
I don't think it's admirable.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
I think it's inspirational.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
I immediately already, having since talked about it,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
I got a tweet from a guy that was like,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
what would you recommend?

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
What did you get the clock thing?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
And I was like, whoa, shut it down, shut it down.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
I'm not going to have conversations where I proactively influence

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
your decision about these things.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
And God knows where minutes from another sandy hook

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
at which point it's going to take on another religious connotation

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
of like holy shit, I'll be ashamed of myself forever

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
with my third gun again for a little while.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
So don't just value my candor, my confession, my honesty.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
I bought this thing because the morning after the election

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
I went downstairs and after an evening

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
of my girlfriend staring off into space,

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
the moment she saw my dog sitter,

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
they exchanged niceties and then one of them said,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
how are you doing?

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
And they both burst into tears and then everywhere I went

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
everyone had been crying all morning

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
and then they had to dry their tears

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
and they were hollow people.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
That had to get back to work.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
And I felt emasculated.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
I felt helpless.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
I felt like there was something I had to be able to do.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
I'm not Sirhan, Sirhan.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
I don't think the thing I need to do involves the gun.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
I feel like I have no recourse to power.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
And that is an arrogant, narcissistic, white privilege,

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
straight, white, male-like reaction.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
That is notable.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
It's important to measure it.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I bought a fucking gun.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
I didn't delete my Uber app until it was important to defeat Uber

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
because I was fighting another white guy.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
I heard 900 stories from women about how fucking horrible Uber was

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
and then the day that it was a way to give another white guy a black eye

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
I was like, delete.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
I love Lyft now.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Tell me about your podcast.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
You fucking weirdo.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Our next guest is...

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
We should bring out our guest.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
What am I doing?

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
I told him, here's how the show works.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
I go up and I talk for 10 minutes and then I'll bring you up.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Okay, you're ready to go.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
I just met this guy on another show that I did.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Let's just get to know him at the same time

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
because I said you should come on my show

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
and he's a rapper and a creator of Beats.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
I don't know if the title would be DJ,

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
but his name is Open Mike Eagle.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
You go ahead.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
You can move everything you want.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
I can keep talking too.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
He brought his own stool on stage.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
Yeah, that's a power move, I think.

20:52.000 --> 20:57.000
You're allowed to bring your own furniture on stage.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
That's the Chicago way.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
Not only is it just like I'm adding furniture to the mix,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
but also like you hefted it with such ease

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
that it's like I'm a powerful man.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
Yeah, I don't need a gun, I need it.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
It's a small stool though.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
No, I'm not saying it's...

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
I could move that one around too.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
It's the appearance of power, that's the way it's a power move.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
It doesn't have to be a heavy stool.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
He brought it up on stage like he made it.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
He carved it out of a single piece of wood.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Let's do a test while Mike Eagle...

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
Chris, are we ready to do a test where we...

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
What if I said I wanted to cut to a photo for the...

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Oh, shit, he's running.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Okay, I didn't mean to do that.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
No, this is the test, this is the test.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
I didn't realize, I didn't know...

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
In the future, you might be able to...

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
We could just walk probably, walking.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
Chris, what if I said I wanted...

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Yeah, we did it.

21:50.000 --> 21:56.000
White people, white people and one honorary woman.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
So, how do they let a woman sneak into that fucking photo

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
of creepy, gross, just...

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
This is a poster of, now you see me too, I think.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Look at their...

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
I want to talk about a theory I have about this photo,

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
or rather an obsession I have about this photo.

22:13.000 --> 22:18.000
Now, assumption number one that I'm allowed to make

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
because of the geometry of this photo.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
This is a tripod-mounted photograph.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
This is not a quick...

22:25.000 --> 22:31.000
Hey, secretary of labor, labor us a photo with your Samsung,

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
while people hack it so they can see nuclear launch codes

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
in your fucking patio.

22:36.000 --> 22:42.000
The lines are lined up here, this is a tripod-mounted shot.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
It's been swiveled because any human in their right mind

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
would center the desk in the frame.

22:49.000 --> 22:54.000
There are an almost equal number of people on both sides

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
unless you count homophobic pants over here

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
who I think was either...

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
I'm trying to figure out if he's doing a power play

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
and showed up late.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
No, he set the timer.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
He was the guy that went over to the camera.

23:09.000 --> 23:15.000
Wait, Jeff, no. I'm sorry, but the camera's been swiveled.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Do you understand?

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
On what the audience is right side of the frame,

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
what you see is you could measure that line.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
You would take half of that line and you would put it over here.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
If you wanted to know where the frame would be

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
if this desk were centered.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
It would cut right across Pence's shoulder.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
And if Pence wasn't in the shot,

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
by the way, over here, Herman Munster,

23:39.000 --> 23:44.000
secretary of fucking crazy pumpkin head thumbs,

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
a living golem from the...

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
not from Lord of the Rings, from the Hebrew tradition,

23:50.000 --> 23:56.000
an animated man brought here for the purpose of vengeance.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
And behind him, who has two thumbs

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
and looks like Chris Farley's ghost?

24:01.000 --> 24:09.000
That guy's head would be a little over to the right.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
He wouldn't be bent like that.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
He is scrunching in because the camera moved this way.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
The camera moved this way.

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
I believe that these two aren't getting along for good reason.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
I don't think Pence was told this photo was happening.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
He ran in last second.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
I think he was taking a shit.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
He walked by the Oval Office if that's where this is.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
It looks ovular to me.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
I want to know more about the guy with the orange tie.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
No one wears an orange fucking tie.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
It's very clear that you wear red or blue ties.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
This guy's got a Halloween tie back there.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Also, she only gets one thumb.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
All the guys got two thumbs.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
It's a shame that women only have one thumb for every two thumbs a man makes.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
Women actually only get 70% of thumbs.

24:53.000 --> 24:59.000
Women only get eight oceans to every 11 oceans a man makes.

24:59.000 --> 25:04.000
Remember when the national conversation would have been about zero black people in the photo?

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
It would have been just a talking point.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
It's not that we don't notice it.

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
It's that we know they're white nationalists and we have bigger fish to fry now.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
We're like, yeah, well, they're racist.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
They haven't made any bones about that.

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
So we're moving on because we're like, how do we get them out of there?

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
We're no longer policing them and going like, it would be nice to see some diversity in that photo.

25:26.000 --> 25:33.000
We're like, hey, is there anything in this photo that can show us their weakness?

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
Also, has there ever been a kryptonite barrel in the corner?

25:37.000 --> 25:42.000
Has there ever been a desk that big that didn't have a fucking book or a pen on it?

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
It's a desk.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
He doesn't have any shit on it.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
He clearly doesn't want desks.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
He doesn't want to be at that desk.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
That's not a good desk.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
That's not a desk of someone who uses a desk.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
It's a good desk for finding the book of secrets.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
But remember, remember Obama's first couple days in office?

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Hey, Mike, keep it down, would you?

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
I was. Thanks.

26:02.000 --> 26:08.000
I remember when one of the first things, because they have to, it was like, Obama with the Hitler mustaches.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Oh, it's the end of the world, Obama's president.

26:10.000 --> 26:15.000
Oh, God, how can we, how will we live through two years of this, four years of this, eight years of this?

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
It's a black man in the White House.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
We're all going to die.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
And the first thing was, look at him.

26:20.000 --> 26:25.000
He's not even wearing his jacket at the desk, because the first photo was him with his shirt sleeves rolled up,

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
and he was on the phone, fucking papers everywhere, getting to work.

26:29.000 --> 26:34.000
And then somebody split-screened it with Kennedy, and it was, it was like, yeah, I'm a civil servant.

26:34.000 --> 26:39.000
I fucked Marilyn Monroe, but I also, I want work to get done.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
All right, anyways, whatever.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
When did I become political?

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
The answer is when we started dying.

26:43.000 --> 26:48.000
There was a great Twitter moment where somebody posted this picture and said,

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
what's this mixtape called?

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
And then everybody was sending in answers.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
It was great.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
Mine was Male White Marauders.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
This is the name of this picture.

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
It's a hip-hop joke, I'm sorry.

27:03.000 --> 27:10.000
Yeah, well, let's talk about the fact that, about hip-hop jokes that we won't get.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
I'm so full of those, yeah.

27:12.000 --> 27:18.000
We just met, like, I didn't have time, I'm not going to pretend I'm like, oh, I'm a huge fan of open mic eagle,

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
but I liked what you were doing in the show that I met you in, and then I was like, after the show,

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
like, you should come and do my show, but I know nothing about you.

27:25.000 --> 27:30.000
I know you're from Chicago, I know that you're, like, what was your upbringing like?

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Oh shit, it was fucked up.

27:32.000 --> 27:38.000
I lived like, like, right by the projects, like not in them, but kind of like, right by them, and shit.

27:38.000 --> 27:43.000
And I went to elementary school that was, like, nestled within the projects, so I had,

27:43.000 --> 27:51.000
I lived with my grandparents, my mom was fucked up, and yeah, I had to try to have, like, a normal childhood,

27:51.000 --> 27:56.000
except they kept me very sheltered, and there's, like, gunshots and crack cocaine and all that,

27:56.000 --> 28:01.000
and you had uncles and aunts, they're all strung out on shit, but they kept me in the house,

28:01.000 --> 28:07.000
so, like, I just watched a shit ton of, like, fucking cable television in the late 80s and early 90s a lot.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
Raised by your grandparents?

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Yeah.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
And so what was their take on the world around?

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
Stay inside.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
That was it.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Stay, don't, don't go outside.

28:16.000 --> 28:24.000
Did they have, as a white, naive question, did they have a take that was racially based?

28:24.000 --> 28:30.000
Like, did they have talks with you about what to do when the cops and blah, blah, blah, what other black people do?

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
My grandparents were black people.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
What?

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
From the south.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
Let me finish, okay?

28:38.000 --> 28:49.000
And what that meant is all of their talks were alarmingly racist, like, but not in, like, a, like, not in a cute way.

28:49.000 --> 28:55.000
Like, I had a Japanese seventh grade teacher, and the shit that my sweet old grandmother used to say about that, man,

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
it was fucking awful.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
You know, like, she was a great person, but, you know, she was-

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
I think we'd all like to hear.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
I wouldn't, I wouldn't dare.

29:02.000 --> 29:08.000
So we could cluck our tongues and also go, yeah, whoa, whoa.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
It's just an example.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
It would be great.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
So we know how to judge her.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
Yeah, she called, she called her a bunch of shit that obviously was learned in World War II.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Oh, so she would say, like, actual slurs.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
Yes.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
She wouldn't just use stereotypes like, how did she drive to teach you?

29:21.000 --> 29:29.000
No, it was, it was, because she, you know, she, I don't know, it was just part of lexicon for her to say those awful, awful things.

29:29.000 --> 29:39.000
No, but how, and how did she feel about, because she's from a certain generation, like, what was her and your grandpa's, like, their,

29:39.000 --> 29:45.000
it's like, if they're looking at a Korean person, they might have all kinds of, like, comforting things to say about the other,

29:45.000 --> 29:55.000
but what was their feeling about how they fit into their government, their society, their neighborhood, whatever?

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
You know, it was more like, keep your nose to the ground and work.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
They didn't have a lot of, we didn't have a lot of talk about identity.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Like, my dad talked to me about a lot of that stuff.

30:04.000 --> 30:11.000
My grandparents, they were, they were working people and they worked and they wanted to make sure we were safe and did our homework and shit.

30:11.000 --> 30:17.000
They could care less about a lot of, you know, a lot of social and racial identity and that kind of thing.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
So they were just sort of like, were they Christian?

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Yeah.

30:20.000 --> 30:25.000
They were kind of like, just be a good person and go to church and like, be, like, work hard and stay out of trouble.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
Yeah, do your homework, don't hit girls at school, like, you know what I mean?

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
Like, just real straight down the middle shit, you know?

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
And did you mainly adhere to that or were you a rebel in your youth?

30:36.000 --> 30:42.000
Nah, I wore, I wore corduroy's and the sweaters that they brought me from K-Marvel, my grandmother worked.

30:42.000 --> 30:47.000
So my rebelling would be not wearing my shirt all the way up to the top.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
That was my, that was my rebelling.

30:49.000 --> 30:56.000
And what were you interested in when you were like, sixth grade, seventh grade, eighth grade, like, going through puberty, like, what did you imagine?

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
Were you scarred by the Japanese teacher you had, did that fuck you up?

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
No, I loved him, he was fantastic.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
He was an amazing person.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Mr. Matsumoto was fucking awesome.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
Matsumoto, it's like, like, easy to remember too.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Yeah, yeah, he was scarred.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
He made an impression on me.

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
You could just start making up that name and find your way through it and still be right.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
Okay, alright.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
Fuck, I mean, maybe I'm in your grandma's side.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
Maybe I like to dehumanize.

31:25.000 --> 31:31.000
Maybe that and Christ are blankets I wrap around me at night and maybe the world has no other options for me.

31:31.000 --> 31:45.000
No, but what, when you were like, like, pick your age, 10, 11, 12, whatever, but like, at a certain, there's a point where, where your future is like, all, you know, like, like, what was the astronaut dream?

31:45.000 --> 31:56.000
Or the, like, I remember me and my best friend said, we were going to get a boat and we were going to sail into the Bermuda Triangle and we were going to like, just like, find out what the deal was with the Bermuda Triangle.

31:56.000 --> 32:02.000
And we were pinky swearing, we're like, seriously though, you know how old people get fat and old and then they don't want to do that.

32:02.000 --> 32:11.000
And then we were like, no, for real, I fucking know, we're going to look you up and we're like, we set a date and I, you know, of course I fucked him over.

32:11.000 --> 32:28.000
I mean, my personal dream like that was that I had romanticized being like, in like, the Secret Service or some shit, but only because in my dumb mind, the Secret Service guys were like, somebody in the government knows everything.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
And it's got to be those guys.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
They're the Secret Service.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Yeah.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
So they got to know all the secrets.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
They're not the Ignorant Service.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
Exactly.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
They have a secret in their name.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
So I wanted to do that.

32:39.000 --> 32:44.000
It turns out they're just in charge of counterfeiting and protecting the president, I guess.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
I don't know.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
Yeah, that is an interesting answer.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Like, I'm fascinated by the Secret Service too.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
Like, I wonder like, what their definition of a good guy and a bad guy is?

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
Like, what you're supposed to do?

32:55.000 --> 33:00.000
Like, what if the president grabs a hammer and goes at himself with the claw end of it?

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
What's your responsibility as a Secret Service guy?

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
You have to like, jump between him and the hammer.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
Like, you have to get in between the hammer and him.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
Yeah.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
The whole time he's saying, this is for the American people that I'm doing this.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
There's a microchip in my head.

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
Like, are you supposed to as a Secret Service guy be like, that's impossible?

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
You have to, right?

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Or are you supposed to be like, this is my boss?

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
Because presidents have like, fevers and shit too sometimes.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
Only they wake up in cold sweats saying crazy shit all the time.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
And especially they don't have to jump in front of that virus.

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
He has to get right in front of that sneeze that gave him that cold.

33:34.000 --> 33:38.000
The big question is like, when they, I remember when Obama got elected, there was a kind of

33:38.000 --> 33:44.000
doubling up of Secret Service efforts and things, which was simultaneously like, it's

33:44.000 --> 33:49.000
kind of like, by the millennial definitions, it's like, oh, we're racist.

33:49.000 --> 33:53.000
We're noticing he's a black president, so let's close ranks everybody.

33:53.000 --> 33:59.000
It's like, if you drifted further into the outfield when he came up to bats.

33:59.000 --> 34:04.000
I have a friend from high school, my friend Mike Carpio, who listens to the show.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
He drives a cab in New York right now.

34:06.000 --> 34:12.000
He sent a postcard jokingly saying to a friend that was going to Chicago when I think George

34:12.000 --> 34:16.000
Herbert Walker Bush was president, saying like, hey, you're going to meet Chicago.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
Don't shoot the president while you're there, haha.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
And a postcard.

34:20.000 --> 34:25.000
The next morning, knock on the door, two dudes in suits, Secret Service, and they gave him

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
100 questions.

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
Where are you homosexual, are you a member of the Communist Party?

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
And they had the postcard.

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
So they haven't changed their questionnaire from 1955?

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
No, same question.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
Just boilerplate.

34:37.000 --> 34:41.000
Hey, should we cut down on some of these questions?

34:41.000 --> 34:45.000
Hey, what harm is there in knowing if someone's gay?

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
Right.

34:46.000 --> 34:52.000
That was someone at the meeting, they were like, hey, what do we want to know less?

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
We'll wait for them to sue us, then we'll stop asking.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
The news doesn't loosen.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Yeah, we drove all the way to Whittier.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
We're not going to not know if they're gay or not.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
But I am fascinated with that.

35:03.000 --> 35:10.000
The idea of what I was getting to is like, okay, the Secret Service, how much does it

35:10.000 --> 35:14.000
get flushed and switched over for each president?

35:14.000 --> 35:25.000
Like, they have to have a professional code that supersedes.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
Didn't a guy just resign?

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
Like the head of the Secret Service just resigned, I think?

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Is that something I'm making up?

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
Can't keep track.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
National security, right?

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
No, but a different guy.

35:34.000 --> 35:39.000
I think specifically, I think the director of the Secret Service resigned for personal

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
reasons.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Yeah.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
I feel like what I'm doing is literally called upstaging you.

35:44.000 --> 35:50.000
Oh, Mike, by the way, I just got to check, if you need to hook into all your gear there,

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
I have the DI.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
That's right, I got to do the other thing.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
The DI box here.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
Do you need to hook into this?

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
I do.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Because that's your lead.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
How's everybody doing?

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
That's good.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Reading a good comic books.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
Cool.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
Upstage is backstage.

36:06.000 --> 36:10.500
Now, when you get back on the, Mike, Mike, I want to talk about all this gear you have

36:10.500 --> 36:11.500
here.

36:11.500 --> 36:12.500
You got loads of shit.

36:12.500 --> 36:13.500
I do.

36:13.500 --> 36:14.500
That's why you brought a stool.

36:14.500 --> 36:17.500
This stool is not just a power move, this is an actual functional tool.

36:17.500 --> 36:20.500
Yes, it's a thing used for sitting.

36:20.500 --> 36:26.600
The reason why upstaging is a bad thing is because you stay back and you make the other

36:26.600 --> 36:31.240
person go like this, you're fucking them over if you hug the back wall.

36:31.240 --> 36:36.200
I learned that in a trauma club.

36:36.200 --> 36:37.200
Upstaging.

36:37.200 --> 36:44.240
All right, so, yeah, but I don't know, I was just, okay, we don't have, that was a graceful

36:44.240 --> 36:47.400
segue and I want to ruin it because I still want to talk about the Secret Service.

36:47.400 --> 36:50.700
I just imagine you being a Secret Service person and I'm like, okay, so then the guy

36:50.700 --> 36:54.520
comes into the office that's like, what if your, I mean, what if your wife is Muslim?

36:54.520 --> 36:59.680
What if you, like, it's like, what do they do, what a Secret Service guy, we'll have

36:59.680 --> 37:03.200
a Secret Service guy as a guest and we'll ask him all kinds of questions.

37:03.200 --> 37:07.920
For her, you're welcome.

37:07.920 --> 37:14.480
Okay, let's get into the wrapping portion of our show, which should last for now until

37:14.480 --> 37:17.960
90 minutes from now.

37:17.960 --> 37:20.680
So how do we want to do this?

37:20.680 --> 37:23.000
I got a bunch of shit that can be done.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.200
It's just, what do we want to do?

37:25.200 --> 37:28.200
Let's just have an open source process.

37:28.200 --> 37:29.520
Start by giving me a beat.

37:29.520 --> 37:36.000
How did you guys meet while Mike's putting this together?

37:36.000 --> 37:37.400
You guys do what show?

37:37.400 --> 37:49.160
It's funny, we were both, I was a rogue cop and then I had to say hello to my new partner.

37:49.160 --> 37:53.680
Now we just did this show.

37:53.680 --> 37:55.680
Are you making beats on the flat?

37:55.680 --> 38:04.200
No, I'm just going to, I got something to say to that, but thank you for it.

38:04.200 --> 38:07.120
Now are you going to lay down some stuff that you already have written or are you going

38:07.120 --> 38:09.120
to have a freestyle for us?

38:09.120 --> 38:10.120
I don't know.

38:10.120 --> 38:12.120
Well, I don't have anything written to this.

38:12.120 --> 38:14.120
You don't have anything written to this?

38:14.120 --> 38:15.120
Not just.

38:15.120 --> 38:16.120
I do.

38:16.120 --> 38:32.120
Well, when you rap, you rap with your heart, you do your best to do your rapping part because

38:32.120 --> 38:38.240
rap music is never going anywhere.

38:38.240 --> 38:44.200
It's in all of the water, the fire, the wind and your hair, mislead.

38:44.200 --> 38:50.000
Well, I'm a rapping man and I'm here to sing.

38:50.000 --> 38:58.600
I want to rap about everything, but I can't, not yet till I get a harmony in my heart.

38:58.600 --> 39:05.400
I want to do my part, so I bought a gun for some reason.

39:05.400 --> 39:12.240
The president's committing treason just by sitting in that office.

39:12.240 --> 39:18.360
I hear him cough, and I think, is he going to die?

39:18.360 --> 39:25.720
And then I wonder why I'd be happy for somebody to be in pain.

39:25.720 --> 39:27.520
I'm on the hate train.

39:27.520 --> 39:30.080
My name is motherfucking MC.

39:30.080 --> 39:33.440
I'm going to put every vitamin inside of my pee.

39:33.440 --> 39:39.600
I'm going to drink it down and pee it out because that's what a recycling syndrome's

39:39.600 --> 39:40.600
about.

39:40.600 --> 39:45.880
If you're only drinking pee, then water is pee, and if you pee it out, it's twice as

39:45.880 --> 39:47.400
much pee you see.

39:47.400 --> 39:54.440
So you got to seek effervescent freshness, you got to get back to what the quest was.

39:54.440 --> 40:01.040
You can pee in Texas and you can pee on extras, and if you can't pee long, you should stretch

40:01.040 --> 40:08.200
it out like I do, because I got a really small bladder, so I pee longer than I have to in

40:08.200 --> 40:09.200
the bathroom.

40:09.200 --> 40:15.040
I let people think I'm still going when I'm blowing, even though nothing is showing.

40:15.040 --> 40:16.040
Fuck it.

40:16.040 --> 40:17.040
Oh, shit.

40:17.040 --> 40:27.920
Well, now what do we do?

40:27.920 --> 40:31.480
That's the danger of rapping when you're also in control of how long the beats go.

40:31.480 --> 40:32.480
Yeah.

40:32.480 --> 40:34.480
It's also the danger of rapping that early in the show.

40:34.480 --> 40:37.120
I mean, how are we going to follow that with our bullshithes?

40:37.120 --> 40:39.360
Dan, you just dropped $4.

40:39.360 --> 40:40.360
I guess with cash prizes.

40:40.360 --> 40:41.360
Hello.

40:41.360 --> 40:50.320
That's like in video games when you beat someone up and they drop money.

40:50.320 --> 40:55.600
I want to hear more, just more like, you know, rapping.

40:55.600 --> 40:57.520
More rapper.

40:57.520 --> 40:59.520
More extemporaneous freestyle.

40:59.520 --> 41:01.280
That was a nice beat.

41:01.280 --> 41:02.280
I had a good one.

41:02.280 --> 41:03.280
That was good.

41:03.280 --> 41:04.280
All right.

41:04.280 --> 41:05.640
So these are all beats that you made up yourself?

41:05.640 --> 41:12.960
That one was, a lot of this is other people's shit from our songs, and what should I put

41:12.960 --> 41:13.960
on here?

41:13.960 --> 41:16.040
What should we call that last rap?

41:16.040 --> 41:18.800
Well, doing the rapping part.

41:18.800 --> 41:19.800
Oh, yeah.

41:19.800 --> 41:20.800
That hook was great.

41:20.800 --> 41:21.800
That was great.

41:21.800 --> 41:22.800
What?

41:22.800 --> 41:28.160
Is there any significance to the name open mic eagle?

41:28.160 --> 41:29.160
Yeah.

41:29.160 --> 41:33.240
He sounds a little bummed out about that.

41:33.240 --> 41:35.160
I pressed the opposite of a button.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.160
Yeah.

41:36.160 --> 41:42.760
I found the armchair snooze setting like a bored you to death.

41:42.760 --> 41:44.640
No, it's not boredom.

41:44.640 --> 41:48.680
It's just that I should have a way better answer.

41:48.680 --> 41:53.160
And the truth is my government name is Michael Eagle.

41:53.160 --> 41:54.440
Oh, okay.

41:54.440 --> 41:55.440
That's it.

41:55.440 --> 42:02.600
It was fucking Mike Eagle and a rapper bunch at open mics.

42:02.600 --> 42:07.120
And so then I just smashed all that shit together and made a rap name.

42:07.120 --> 42:09.600
You didn't feel like Mike Eagle wasn't cool enough?

42:09.600 --> 42:10.600
You know what?

42:10.600 --> 42:12.480
That's the best name in the world.

42:12.480 --> 42:16.080
In retrospect, you're correct.

42:16.080 --> 42:19.600
It would be the thing to do now, like if you started now, it's to the 2003 or whatever

42:19.600 --> 42:20.600
you started.

42:20.600 --> 42:21.600
Dan, I think about it every day.

42:21.600 --> 42:22.600
Yeah.

42:22.600 --> 42:23.600
But you could also.

42:23.600 --> 42:26.640
If you call yourself Mike Eagle, people will think you made that up.

42:26.640 --> 42:29.880
When you say my name is open mic eagle, they go, oh, his name is Mike Eagle and he's ashamed

42:29.880 --> 42:30.880
of it.

42:30.880 --> 42:31.880
Yeah.

42:31.880 --> 42:33.800
He doesn't believe that that's enough.

42:33.800 --> 42:34.800
I didn't.

42:34.800 --> 42:35.800
I was overcompensating.

42:35.800 --> 42:40.080
It got stuck in it forever.

42:40.080 --> 42:43.560
But you could be like John Cougar, Mellon Camp and just drop the cougar at some point.

42:43.560 --> 42:44.560
Did he drop it?

42:44.560 --> 42:46.480
I don't know what the arc was with that shit at all.

42:46.480 --> 42:50.320
Because he was Johnny Cougar for a while and it was John Cougar, Mellon Camp, and I think

42:50.320 --> 42:52.000
he just went to John Mellon Camp.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
That was a great decision.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
Yeah.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.920
I'm going to draw upon his strength because the cougar was thrust upon him, but Eagle,

42:57.920 --> 42:59.000
you were born with the Eagle.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
I was.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
Yeah.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
You saved your destiny.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.620
I mean, I like it.

43:03.620 --> 43:06.760
I just didn't realize it was enough.

43:06.760 --> 43:07.760
Mike Eagle.

43:07.760 --> 43:10.080
I can't feel like you should you know what it is.

43:10.080 --> 43:11.080
It's my dad's name, too.

43:11.080 --> 43:12.080
Right.

43:12.080 --> 43:13.080
So I never thought it was fucking special.

43:13.080 --> 43:17.040
You know Mike Eagle Junior the second or whatever the fuck.

43:17.040 --> 43:18.040
That's fucked up.

43:18.040 --> 43:19.040
My eagle.

43:19.040 --> 43:25.560
You have to either be like a like film noir detective or a stripper because Mike Eagle

43:25.560 --> 43:26.560
is good.

43:26.560 --> 43:27.560
That's a great name.

43:27.560 --> 43:28.560
I feel like I'm being too I read the Mike.

43:28.560 --> 43:30.360
Mike Eagle novels.

43:30.360 --> 43:30.860
What?

43:30.860 --> 43:34.860
No, I was saying, like, you could write a series of detective novels, my angle.

43:34.860 --> 43:36.860
Like Sam Spade and fucking...

43:36.860 --> 43:38.360
...Dashel Hammett.

43:38.360 --> 43:41.360
I think, I think if he were to be a detective...

43:41.360 --> 43:43.860
I think it would go something like this.

43:46.360 --> 43:47.360
Put a beat on...

43:47.360 --> 43:47.860
Shit.

43:47.860 --> 43:48.860
...before you get beat on.

43:48.860 --> 43:49.860
Whoa!

43:49.860 --> 43:51.360
Beats and P, goddammit.

43:52.360 --> 43:54.360
It's the name of this...

43:54.360 --> 44:01.360
segment.

44:01.360 --> 44:03.360
I like this one a lot.

44:03.360 --> 44:07.360
This takes your height, Dan.

44:07.360 --> 44:11.860
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

44:11.860 --> 44:16.860
Just giving it like a pit set.

44:16.860 --> 44:21.360
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

44:21.360 --> 44:26.360
I don't know.

44:26.360 --> 44:29.360
This is a sample from They Might Be Giants, by the way.

44:29.360 --> 44:31.360
Oh, yeah.

44:31.360 --> 44:33.360
The last one was, too.

44:45.360 --> 44:47.360
Hear me call.

44:47.360 --> 44:56.360
Yeah.

44:56.360 --> 44:58.360
Dan doesn't like this one.

44:58.360 --> 44:59.360
No, I think he does.

44:59.360 --> 45:00.360
No, I'm liking it too much.

45:00.360 --> 45:01.360
I'm sorry, I was just listening.

45:01.360 --> 45:02.360
I don't know.

45:02.360 --> 45:03.360
Here.

45:03.360 --> 45:06.360
You put it in your sleep like a shark upside down.

45:06.360 --> 45:07.360
Yup, yup.

45:07.360 --> 45:08.360
You ever see...

45:08.360 --> 45:09.360
You're like, it's a...

45:09.360 --> 45:10.360
How about a gibberish?

45:10.360 --> 45:12.360
I'm talking gibberish when I...

45:12.360 --> 45:14.360
I rap this bass, I gotta talk gibberish.

45:14.360 --> 45:16.360
Because I can't rap this fast and speak English.

45:16.360 --> 45:19.360
Because I'm rapping too fast, doesn't speak real words.

45:19.360 --> 45:21.360
I fucked her mama like I was watching birds.

45:21.360 --> 45:24.360
Took my binoculars and saw both cities.

45:24.360 --> 45:26.360
I fucked her mama coast to coast in both cities.

45:26.360 --> 45:28.360
Went to New York, Manhattan, Staten Island.

45:28.360 --> 45:32.360
Fucked her mama so hard, she turned into a guy named Ryland.

45:32.360 --> 45:34.360
Psst, psst, psst.

45:34.360 --> 45:38.360
It's like a nephew of my girlfriend.

45:38.360 --> 45:41.360
It's a real name.

45:41.360 --> 45:42.360
Is her name Ryland?

45:42.360 --> 45:43.360
Or Ryland?

45:43.360 --> 45:45.360
Is it Ryland with a D or Ryland?

45:45.360 --> 45:47.360
It confuses people.

45:47.360 --> 45:52.360
Choose better names for your children.

45:52.360 --> 45:56.360
If it's Stephanie, spell it S-G-E-P-H-A-N-I-E.

45:56.360 --> 45:58.360
That's how we know how to spell it.

45:58.360 --> 46:00.360
If you fuck with that, you're gonna doom your kid

46:00.360 --> 46:02.360
to a life of correcting people.

46:07.360 --> 46:11.360
But if you name your kid WubaJub,

46:11.360 --> 46:14.360
spell it out, WubaJub.

46:14.360 --> 46:16.360
How you want to spell it, WubaJub.

46:16.360 --> 46:17.360
You're an inventor.

46:17.360 --> 46:19.360
You're Thomas Edison.

46:19.360 --> 46:22.360
Fucked your mama so hard, let us in to the kitchen

46:22.360 --> 46:23.360
like a vampire.

46:23.360 --> 46:26.360
I fucked your mama till I changed your pussy's tire.

46:26.360 --> 46:27.360
I checked it up.

46:27.360 --> 46:28.360
I put it down.

46:28.360 --> 46:30.360
I changed the lug nuts and drove her ass around.

46:30.360 --> 46:34.360
I treated her with respect.

46:34.360 --> 46:35.360
Then the car wrecked.

46:35.360 --> 46:38.360
Took it back to Amos.

46:38.360 --> 46:42.360
Said, I don't know what happened.

46:42.360 --> 46:43.360
Take it, Mike.

46:43.360 --> 46:45.360
Yeah.

46:45.360 --> 46:47.360
I know what happened.

46:47.360 --> 46:49.360
There's a lot to unpack.

46:49.360 --> 46:51.360
Yes.

46:51.360 --> 46:53.360
There's condoms in the back seats.

46:53.360 --> 46:54.360
Why?

46:54.360 --> 46:55.360
I don't know.

46:55.360 --> 46:57.360
I had acne.

46:57.360 --> 47:00.360
He fucked my mother like some type of athlete.

47:00.360 --> 47:01.360
Or my mom?

47:01.360 --> 47:03.360
Why did I personalize it?

47:03.360 --> 47:04.360
I don't know.

47:04.360 --> 47:05.360
I don't have to.

47:05.360 --> 47:07.360
It could be your mom or your mom.

47:07.360 --> 47:10.360
It could be somebody's mom in Vietnam.

47:10.360 --> 47:11.360
Anywhere.

47:11.360 --> 47:14.360
There's nothing stopping this man from fucking anybody's mother.

47:14.360 --> 47:18.360
And this is the truth I have finally discovered right now.

47:18.360 --> 47:20.360
But he fucked all of our mothers.

47:20.360 --> 47:23.360
So that means all of us are sisters and brothers.

47:23.360 --> 47:26.360
He is a man of many lovers.

47:26.360 --> 47:29.360
As he has said, as he repeated.

47:29.360 --> 47:33.360
And as he said, he excreted all over nasty back seats.

47:33.360 --> 47:36.360
And then he returned the car like nothing happened.

47:36.360 --> 47:39.360
And it was full of used prophylactics.

47:39.360 --> 47:41.360
I'm like, dude, that's disgusting.

47:41.360 --> 47:44.360
Look at the semen you've erupted.

47:44.360 --> 47:46.360
It's like all over the upholstery.

47:46.360 --> 47:49.360
What is this supposed to be?

47:49.360 --> 47:54.360
And he still had to pay full price plus the cleaning fee.

47:54.360 --> 48:00.360
Because the people were like, we're not cleaning semen or cleaning pee.

48:00.360 --> 48:04.360
Because it's all about his liquids.

48:04.360 --> 48:05.360
Because I'm ubiquitous.

48:05.360 --> 48:06.360
Yes.

48:06.360 --> 48:07.360
With my liquidus.

48:07.360 --> 48:08.360
Yes.

48:08.360 --> 48:10.360
This administrativeness.

48:10.360 --> 48:14.360
From the oval oftenness of this coughiness.

48:14.360 --> 48:16.360
I want to put it in a sarcophagus.

48:16.360 --> 48:17.360
I got the pillars.

48:17.360 --> 48:18.360
I got the house.

48:18.360 --> 48:20.360
I want to creep in there like a tiny mouse.

48:20.360 --> 48:23.360
I got superpowers going to shrink my ass down.

48:23.360 --> 48:25.360
Going to go to the oval office and go to ground round.

48:25.360 --> 48:28.360
It's a restaurant chain in the Midwest.

48:32.360 --> 48:35.360
And in the Midwest we kick fresh.

48:35.360 --> 48:38.360
Now I'm fucking with incest, they're small like insects.

48:38.360 --> 48:40.360
Hide them like witsack, witness.

48:40.360 --> 48:43.360
Protection, that's how we do it.

48:43.360 --> 48:45.360
Strangled in here or any section.

48:45.360 --> 48:47.360
Been like the midsection.

48:47.360 --> 48:51.360
Maybe torso, fingers getting their head like horn rolls for twisting.

48:51.360 --> 48:54.360
Just watch how we blow like ballistic missiles.

48:54.360 --> 48:57.360
Cause the shit's wild, not an exile.

48:57.360 --> 48:59.360
Put flows together like textiles.

48:59.360 --> 49:01.360
Smile for miles, never stopping.

49:01.360 --> 49:05.360
I'm tech copper with the news and prime time, a light shine.

49:05.360 --> 49:07.360
They don't want to stand for the tenth time.

49:07.360 --> 49:10.360
Break it down like enzymes when I get within rhymes.

49:10.360 --> 49:12.360
There's no space to be left between.

49:12.360 --> 49:16.360
Come back, have them dancing like bimberine and they system.

49:16.360 --> 49:19.360
Got them hook addicted, nicotine, they a small victory.

49:19.360 --> 49:21.360
I'm coming through pretty big pigs.

49:21.360 --> 49:23.360
Want to get shut down when I clown.

49:23.360 --> 49:26.360
And they don't understand this is that new smackdown.

49:26.360 --> 49:28.360
Referee doing fast counts, one, two, three.

49:28.360 --> 49:31.360
They can't move me, MCs, they think I'm in the food cheese.

49:31.360 --> 49:34.360
But I'm watching, show them double features in the movie.

49:34.360 --> 49:37.360
But it's all this, it's all that we are fat.

49:37.360 --> 49:40.360
The hitter with the ball bat, it's fall star.

49:40.360 --> 49:42.360
They wall march, they generic, we just declare it.

49:42.360 --> 49:47.360
We stare at them, they get embarrassed when we share this freestyle.

49:47.360 --> 49:52.360
How the fuck do you do that, baby?

49:52.360 --> 49:54.360
I don't know how I do that.

49:54.360 --> 50:00.360
How the fuck, how the fuck, how the fuck do you do that?

50:00.360 --> 50:03.360
I don't know how I do that.

50:03.360 --> 50:09.360
Do you eat something special when you grow enough?

50:09.360 --> 50:20.360
Is there a tree in your backyard that grows a special fruit?

50:20.360 --> 50:30.360
Did you win an eBay auction that gave you a special lamp that you rubbed?

50:30.360 --> 50:34.360
Like a wrapping genie.

50:34.360 --> 50:39.360
Oh, what a meanie.

50:39.360 --> 50:41.360
I'm Kevin Meaney, who passed away.

50:41.360 --> 50:43.360
He did pass away.

50:43.360 --> 50:46.360
I rap on a Saturday or Sunday.

50:46.360 --> 50:48.360
I move the crowd like funk sway.

50:48.360 --> 50:50.360
When people rig a major furniture.

50:50.360 --> 50:52.360
Yeah, I rap, but it's earlier.

50:52.360 --> 50:54.360
I will miss you earlier.

50:54.360 --> 50:56.360
That means I'll look through your window.

50:56.360 --> 50:58.360
I'll make you sick and large your fucking lymph nodes.

50:58.360 --> 51:00.360
Like I was cancerous.

51:00.360 --> 51:03.360
MCs want to get pressed up like beats on a master disk.

51:03.360 --> 51:06.360
Next to their name, like Barry Bonds for the asterisks.

51:06.360 --> 51:08.360
After he hits the home run, I am the show gun.

51:08.360 --> 51:11.360
There's no one I kill on my Africans with a blow gun.

51:11.360 --> 51:14.360
When they're trying to do what they do, cause they're predators.

51:14.360 --> 51:18.360
Open cuts your words up like a newspaper editor with op-ed.

51:18.360 --> 51:21.360
I'm not drop dead Fred that old school movie from the 80s.

51:21.360 --> 51:25.360
MCs will try to slay me, but they can't do nothing cause they feel smart as a baby.

51:25.360 --> 51:28.360
But yeah, they got babies and they think they sick.

51:28.360 --> 51:31.360
They want to come through with new shit, but they just miss how we do it.

51:31.360 --> 51:33.360
Hello.

51:33.360 --> 51:35.360
Yeah.

51:35.360 --> 51:37.360
Yeah.

51:37.360 --> 51:39.360
Yeah.

51:39.360 --> 51:41.360
Jesus Christ.

51:41.360 --> 51:44.360
Second you are, cause you ran upholstery with supposed to be.

51:44.360 --> 51:47.360
That made me very happy.

51:47.360 --> 51:50.360
Incredible.

51:50.360 --> 51:52.360
Fuck it.

51:52.360 --> 51:54.360
Oh, Vincent Price breakdown.

51:54.360 --> 51:56.360
Right.

51:56.360 --> 52:00.360
Like me doing the Vincent Price bridge.

52:00.360 --> 52:03.360
Yes.

52:03.360 --> 52:10.360
You're upholstery is scintillating creepy.

52:10.360 --> 52:16.360
The seat coverings are smotherings from the spider's delight.

52:16.360 --> 52:19.360
Oh shit. Ice-tease here too.

52:19.360 --> 52:21.360
Yo, they ain't personal.

52:21.360 --> 52:23.360
It's just business.

52:23.360 --> 52:24.360
Want to fuck your mother?

52:24.360 --> 52:26.360
What is this?

52:26.360 --> 52:28.360
I want to see your pussy to her mouth.

52:28.360 --> 52:31.360
I fucked your mother from the north to the south.

52:31.360 --> 52:32.360
It ain't personal.

52:32.360 --> 52:34.360
It's just me.

52:34.360 --> 52:36.360
I put a bullet in my pee.

52:36.360 --> 52:39.360
I peed out the bullet like a gun.

52:39.360 --> 52:42.360
You telling me this motherfucker's done?

52:42.360 --> 52:43.360
Uh-uh.

52:43.360 --> 52:47.360
Ice-tea to the I to the C to the E and every T and it rhymes.

52:47.360 --> 52:49.360
Everything rhymes with T.

52:49.360 --> 52:50.360
That's all me.

52:50.360 --> 52:52.360
Ice-tea.

52:52.360 --> 52:53.360
Yeah.

52:53.360 --> 52:54.360
Yo, I gotta go.

52:54.360 --> 52:56.360
I'm gonna get an ice cream.

52:56.360 --> 52:59.360
Don't confuse that with what my name means.

52:59.360 --> 53:02.360
My name comes from the streets.

53:02.360 --> 53:05.360
Yo, my sore feet.

53:05.360 --> 53:07.360
They get sore when I walk.

53:07.360 --> 53:10.360
I fucked your mama.

53:10.360 --> 53:11.360
Oh shit.

53:11.360 --> 53:15.360
Jimmy Stewart's here too.

53:15.360 --> 53:25.360
I saw your mama was outside.

53:25.360 --> 53:32.360
Well, obviously I need a B.

53:32.360 --> 53:34.360
Oh yeah.

53:34.360 --> 53:38.360
That was kind of a smooth one.

53:38.360 --> 53:41.360
We can take a break and talk about you again.

53:41.360 --> 53:42.360
Okay.

53:42.360 --> 53:45.360
Now that there's heightened interest in you.

53:45.360 --> 53:46.360
Is there?

53:46.360 --> 53:47.360
Is that what happened?

53:47.360 --> 53:52.360
I saw some skills and things.

53:52.360 --> 53:56.360
So now we're at the point in your life you're being raised by your grandparents.

53:56.360 --> 53:57.360
Oh shit.

53:57.360 --> 53:58.360
Okay.

53:58.360 --> 54:01.360
I forgot that we were talking about the past.

54:01.360 --> 54:04.360
There's a point, so where are you?

54:04.360 --> 54:07.360
You're not like a six year old on the playground that's into hip hop, are you?

54:07.360 --> 54:10.360
No, I was into, I mean this is the thing.

54:10.360 --> 54:13.360
Where I grew up and when I grew up rap was just there.

54:13.360 --> 54:15.360
Rap was there.

54:15.360 --> 54:19.360
My older sister, my first rap I heard, I got in my mom's car.

54:19.360 --> 54:21.360
She was playing fucking Easy Ease first album.

54:21.360 --> 54:23.360
It was fucking 1987.

54:23.360 --> 54:24.360
Oh yeah.

54:24.360 --> 54:25.360
You know what I mean?

54:25.360 --> 54:27.360
The suspense was making me sick.

54:27.360 --> 54:29.360
So I opened it up and the bitch had a dick.

54:29.360 --> 54:32.360
My mom's car when I was six.

54:32.360 --> 54:35.360
And I was like, oh my god, all these curse words, this is fucking great.

54:35.360 --> 54:38.360
But that was just what was all around me.

54:38.360 --> 54:43.360
So I never, I mean at least at that point in my life I wasn't like, oh god, rap is awesome

54:43.360 --> 54:44.360
because it was just life.

54:44.360 --> 54:50.360
And so I actually escaped into rock music and shit that I was seeing on MTV.

54:50.360 --> 54:52.360
Did you associate rap at that age?

54:52.360 --> 54:56.360
You were kind of like, this is, like almost maybe what I associated Country Western with

54:56.360 --> 54:58.360
is like, this is my parents' music, this is grown up shit.

54:58.360 --> 55:01.360
This is like, so did you reject it?

55:01.360 --> 55:04.360
It wasn't so much that I rejected it.

55:04.360 --> 55:08.360
It was just like the soundtrack of my surroundings.

55:08.360 --> 55:11.360
What was the first record or a rap group that you got into?

55:11.360 --> 55:14.360
Was that your own discovery or your own shit?

55:14.360 --> 55:15.360
Trapcore Quest.

55:15.360 --> 55:16.360
Oh yeah.

55:16.360 --> 55:17.360
So all of that shit.

55:17.360 --> 55:21.360
Like all of the Day Last Soul, Trapcore Quest, the brand newbie.

55:21.360 --> 55:23.360
I was really bummed out when Fife died.

55:23.360 --> 55:24.360
Yeah man.

55:24.360 --> 55:27.360
I didn't realize until I read an article at Day Last Soul because I was always like,

55:27.360 --> 55:29.360
why wasn't Day Last Soul's fire?

55:29.360 --> 55:31.360
Why didn't it burn everything down?

55:31.360 --> 55:35.360
And it was like, there was sampling legislation that happened

55:35.360 --> 55:37.360
that I had no idea had anything to do with it.

55:37.360 --> 55:38.360
Yeah.

55:38.360 --> 55:40.360
That a lot of their sound was like very, very...

55:40.360 --> 55:45.360
And they were part of the original lawsuits that changed Hip Hop forever.

55:45.360 --> 55:46.360
Yeah.

55:46.360 --> 55:50.360
Like they were sampling like the turtles and just interludes and shit.

55:50.360 --> 55:58.360
But there were no standing laws or no history for how you go about punishing that.

55:58.360 --> 56:03.360
And so the copyright law for Hip Hop started with them and started with Bismarck E.

56:03.360 --> 56:08.360
And then it became like illegal to the point where these,

56:08.360 --> 56:12.360
the record labels and the guys who owned those masters could sue for the amount of money

56:12.360 --> 56:14.360
that would just kill a whole project.

56:14.360 --> 56:15.360
It could kill a whole label.

56:15.360 --> 56:18.360
It could put everybody in a bankruptcy and it changed Hip Hop forever.

56:18.360 --> 56:20.360
That's why Hip Hop can't sound like it used to.

56:20.360 --> 56:24.360
Like the records that I grew up loving are all illegal right now.

56:24.360 --> 56:26.360
You can't make any of those.

56:26.360 --> 56:29.360
Do you think that when we go to music in general,

56:29.360 --> 56:32.360
even if maybe our grandparents went to Elvis for the same reason,

56:32.360 --> 56:34.360
or Little Richard or whatever, like,

56:34.360 --> 56:37.360
are we going to music when we're in the mood to fuck or fight

56:37.360 --> 56:43.360
and that's why conscientious music, like a message in your music,

56:43.360 --> 56:47.360
like it's gonna never like win that stock market battle where it's like,

56:47.360 --> 56:50.360
hey, over here I got, I'm selling Arrested Development.

56:50.360 --> 56:55.360
Like in the 90s I was like, it seems so much harder

56:55.360 --> 57:00.360
and so much more worthwhile to try to rise above the equally charismatic stuff

57:00.360 --> 57:02.360
like that easy, easy thing you're talking about.

57:02.360 --> 57:05.360
I remember the white guys in the locker room,

57:05.360 --> 57:09.360
just like everyone knew it by syllable.

57:09.360 --> 57:12.360
Like everyone had it memorized and it had infected everybody,

57:12.360 --> 57:15.360
I guess because it was just for the same reason that,

57:15.360 --> 57:19.360
who knows, like what, I'm doing the twist or whatever the fuck,

57:19.360 --> 57:22.360
like it's always been, it's the same as rock and roll.

57:22.360 --> 57:24.360
It's like, oh, they're talking about fucking them,

57:24.360 --> 57:28.360
they're talking about anger, they're talking about something my parents don't like

57:28.360 --> 57:33.360
and this is finally authentic and it's been too inauthentic and now it's authentic,

57:33.360 --> 57:37.360
but the problem is that that authenticity never goes hand in hand with like,

57:37.360 --> 57:39.360
is this a question, Dan, is what you're wondering?

57:39.360 --> 57:42.360
No, no, no, I think it makes perfect sense.

57:42.360 --> 57:47.360
The authenticity doesn't go hand in hand with like, oh, here's an idea.

57:47.360 --> 57:51.360
Authenticity tends to go hand in hand with, I want to smash someone in the face,

57:51.360 --> 57:54.360
I shot someone today, I'm horny.

57:54.360 --> 57:59.360
I mean, you know, what it is with hip hop and I don't know if this speaks to other genres.

57:59.360 --> 58:02.360
I think it is with rock and roll too, but it sticks out more with hip hop.

58:02.360 --> 58:05.360
I know that when I grew up, when hip hop was starting,

58:05.360 --> 58:11.360
there were hella options in terms of the type of content you could get in a popular rap song even.

58:11.360 --> 58:13.360
Not upstaging of getting drunk.

58:13.360 --> 58:18.360
It's all good. You could have NWA and you could have public enemy

58:18.360 --> 58:21.360
and all of that was able to exist in the same space.

58:21.360 --> 58:26.360
What I think happened with rap music is that ultimately,

58:26.360 --> 58:32.360
the rap music that aligns more with like our overarching cultural values,

58:32.360 --> 58:37.360
it becomes easier for that to spread than things that are talking about going against that.

58:37.360 --> 58:43.360
Do you think part of it is because if guys are rapping about being poor

58:43.360 --> 58:48.360
and how they'll always be poor and how being poor makes them angry

58:48.360 --> 58:56.360
and how the kind of lower class lifestyle being maybe not necessarily applauded

58:56.360 --> 59:02.360
by the protagonist in the music, but certainly being coped with, being celebrated,

59:02.360 --> 59:10.360
do you think that maybe part of it is because that's easy to digest for everybody,

59:10.360 --> 59:17.360
including people who can stay racist and like good music?

59:17.360 --> 59:20.360
Right, but what I'm saying specifically about rap music,

59:20.360 --> 59:24.360
because if you look at Dr. Dre's The Chronic album,

59:24.360 --> 59:28.360
and that album changed like everything because it was one of the first times

59:28.360 --> 59:36.360
that a high profile rap release was overtly about like fucking and money

59:36.360 --> 59:39.360
and like you said, shit that people could identify with,

59:39.360 --> 59:44.360
no matter if they liked or identified with the people making it or not,

59:44.360 --> 59:49.360
they could identify with those values, like those are cultural values overall.

59:49.360 --> 59:53.360
And I feel like once people are able to dial into that,

59:53.360 --> 59:58.360
then that shows the mode of hip-hop that was able to become more dominant.

59:58.360 --> 01:00:01.360
There's two different areas here,

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:05.360
because it's like the thing that I always hear over and over,

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:09.360
but that historical era of hip-hop was like, oh, the white people flooded in,

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:16.360
like the suburban white kids that don't, it's not identifiable, but it's still charismatic.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:21.360
The music was good because I was a suburban, I still am a suburban white kid,

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:29.360
like EPMD, Eric B and Rock Him, NWA, Too Short, like all the West Coast stuff,

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:33.360
we all listened to it because the music was good, like the quality was really good,

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:38.360
the production values were really good, and their records were actual albums,

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:43.360
like the whole record said something, it wasn't just a bunch of bullshit,

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.360
and Rock and Roll wasn't doing it then, like Rock and Roll had kind of gone away.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:55.360
So we rejoined Open Mike Eagle's biopic, you're hearing Tribe Called Quest the first time,

01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:03.360
and we're still, as far as I know, because I want to hear the point where you actually are seduced by hip-hop.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:09.360
Okay, that's high school for me, because I first identified with Tribe Called Quest beneath the apple bum,

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:17.360
and I'm seeing images of people, of black people who are cool, but they're not like,

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:22.360
I'm trying to be hard cool, they're like, it's okay for me to be unique,

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:26.360
it's okay for me to rock these weird, afrocentric, baggy, and I wasn't able to do that either,

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:33.360
but I saw self-confident people who weren't trying to portray the hardest image,

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:38.360
and to me that created a space like, oh wait a minute, there's room for me in this culture too,

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:41.360
because I wasn't reflecting those other values either.

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:47.360
So that was the first thing, and in Chicago, on the south side in high school,

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:56.360
there was this place called Promontory Point, it was this park district where they had this city-sanctioned breakdancing class.

01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:04.360
But what the hip-hop community in this city used as this meeting point for people who were into all of the hip-hop arts,

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:08.360
people who were doing graffiti, people who were freestyle rapping, people who were breakdancing,

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:13.360
people who were DJing, they all got together at this place every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon,

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:19.360
and that just flicked something in my head, like oh wait a minute, this is not just some shit to listen to,

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:23.360
it's some shit you can actually do, and taking that layer of distance away from it,

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:26.360
and making it something that I had an entry or access point into.

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:34.360
So maybe intellectualizing it, maybe, but not that that sounds punitive to you, but that's how I experience emotion.

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:42.360
I need to logically realize that it's the right thing to do, that it makes sense to do it,

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:48.360
that it's strategically, that it doesn't compromise me, that it doesn't take anything away from me,

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:50.360
that it's a proper way for me to...

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:59.360
I was like, oh, hugging my girlfriend is a way to maintain that, I'm just wondering maybe if you're a verbal thinker,

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:05.360
if you're a logical thinker, you grow up in that atmosphere and you're like, then in that moment you're like, wait a minute,

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:11.360
and if I could speculate going like, because something that I had to, like back then I remember going like,

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:19.360
somebody had to tell me or I read it somewhere, they were like, oh, don't you understand that going like this with a record in the 80s,

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:26.360
is like the only recourse we've provided kids that used to get tuba lessons,

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:34.360
and that all of the sampling and everything, beatboxing, rapping itself, everything, all of it is,

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:40.360
it's an expression of, it's like banging on pipes underneath the fucking subterranean,

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:45.360
not underneath the subterranean thing, don't let me do this.

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:53.360
And then I was like, oh shit, I had to have a logical, I kind of have to parse it in sci-fi terms myself,

01:03:53.360 --> 01:04:00.360
I'm always like, oh wait, okay, this is the robots and these are the people and this is how we fight and this is what we do,

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:06.360
and maybe that happened to you kind of in that moment where you're like, wait a minute, what do all these things have in common,

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:09.360
they're unsanctioned, they're not...

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:15.360
What was the threshold for you, Mike, when you listened to stuff, you got turned on by that music and then you started saying,

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:19.360
okay, now I have to go get equipment and start making it myself, like how old were you?

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:29.360
I started rapping just as 16, right, and I was seeing people rap at that place, freestyle, they were getting in circles and freestyle rhyming,

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:33.360
and so like me and my friends in high school decided we were going to do that,

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:38.360
and so from like the age of 16 to like 24, all the rap I ever did was freestyle.

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:40.360
So that's why you're better, I started at 42.

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:43.360
Well then yeah, 10,000 hours, you know what I mean?

01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:47.360
That's not true, Dan, you've been doing it since you were 20 and you've been bad at it the whole time.

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:51.360
I started taking it seriously last week, okay?

01:04:51.360 --> 01:05:00.360
Wait, Mike, can you give Dan some pointers because tell him to stop saying the word mouth because he knows he's just going to have to say south after that.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:04.360
But there's a certain pitfalls that you fall into every time.

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.360
Do you rap a lot for real?

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:08.360
In the show, yeah I do.

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:17.360
And truly in the show, because it started as a gimmick in the show, the idea was I rap badly only by virtue of doing the show every week for years,

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:20.360
I'm getting a little bit better, don't tell anyone I said that.

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.360
No, you're not terrible.

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:24.360
It's just practicing, it's like light training.

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:25.360
And that's all it is.

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.360
You have your moments, Dan.

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:30.360
Once in a while, Dan will lay down a really good rhyme.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:37.360
Well, that's the thing that fascinates me about rap because unlike piano lessons, which I regret ever bailing on and stuff,

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:51.360
but here's this thing where there's people who labor, the relationship between freestyle and writing raps is just really fascinating to me.

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:54.360
It deep core fracks the fascination.

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:57.360
I'm not drunk, I'm just making up new words like Shakespeare.

01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:00.360
Also it's 9-11.

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.360
Don't let that alarm you.

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:03.360
It was a little scary.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.360
It was a little scary.

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.360
Were they uninitiated?

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.360
Let me remind you that it's a little scary.

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.360
Just so you know, our fans are crazy people.

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:11.360
They're crazy.

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:15.360
Well, here's the thing you did just before you launched into what we were doing it before.

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:23.360
I was babbling and I was doing bits and then it was literally, I watched you,

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:30.360
like I said like sassafras and then you were like, I'm going to start rapping.

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:31.360
I saw that on your face.

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:38.360
And then I, because I was just like, and by sassafras I mean pineapple and you're like pineapple, apple, babble.

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:48.360
But like you could have gotten away with, in your head you had the option of going with sassafras as a point of departure,

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:53.360
but you were committed to a last dragon like flow.

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.360
Absolutely, absolutely.

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.360
I mean, that's all it is.

01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:02.360
You know, it's just making connections, you know, but in real time that's all it is.

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:05.360
And the enemy is starting to think?

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:08.360
No, the enemy is stopping.

01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:10.360
That's the only enemy is stopping.

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.360
You just keep going.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.360
Just like when me and my friends first started,

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:14.360
But I didn't hear you.

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:15.360
We were all fucking horrible.

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:20.360
And what we used to do, we would get on the phone and call each other old school three way, right?

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:21.360
With no beat.

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.360
And we would just start rapping.

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:24.360
We were fucking awful.

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:28.360
And our whole thing was just don't fucking stop.

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:32.360
And then like, what you started to do after a while is built that catalog of words.

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:37.360
So then it's not mouth and south, it's about and trout and grout and gout and all of that.

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.360
The rhymes don't have to be actual complete rhymes.

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.360
There could be sounds.

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.360
You're just riffing on sounds.

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.360
You don't even have to rhyme.

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.360
You just got to keep going.

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:50.360
Some of the best lyrics in music history, there are no rhymes.

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:54.360
There's a song called Moonlight in Vermont, which is a beautiful lyric and there's no rhyme in it.

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:56.360
And you don't notice that.

01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.360
It's just a great, it's a beautiful lyric.

01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:00.360
It's a poem.

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.360
Somebody requested.

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:05.360
I can't sing it, we're getting sued.

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:09.360
I was in, I did this study with the National Institutes of Health.

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.360
I freestyle in an MRI machine.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:12.360
What?

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:13.360
Yeah, I did.

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:18.360
And like, and they, and I'm a co-author on a fucking National Institute of Health study about it.

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:19.360
Wait, that's right.

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:20.360
Improvisation or freestyling.

01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:23.360
You got an MRI while you were freestyling?

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.360
Yeah, no, like, they bloated me in the machine.

01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:26.360
Can I make a guess?

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:27.360
I'll probably be wrong.

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:33.360
But I would guess because words appear as, for me, they're visual.

01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:38.360
Does the same part of like facial recognition, like spatial recognition come up?

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:41.360
Like what part of your brain lit up in the MRI?

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:43.360
Well, they said, okay, so they've been studying this.

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:47.360
Because they started with studying like improvisational pianists in there.

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:50.360
So they had this little keyboard you can put in there.

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:57.360
So like, they're trying to figure out the brain parts that are active when people reach what's called the flow state.

01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:59.360
And that's any improvisation.

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:00.360
This is not about lead with this.

01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:03.360
No, I mean, that's not, go, go, keep going, keep going.

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:12.360
But it's, and so what they say is like language turns on, but like forethought, like the normal frontal lobe thought turns off.

01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:19.360
And you start thinking with like more reptilian brain, because you don't, you like, because you can't overthink it, like you said.

01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:21.360
But you're still using language.

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:28.360
It's like your reptile brain is shooting lightning through the forebrain, but the forebrain's being used as a fucking silencer and a pistol or any other tool.

01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:37.360
It's like, it's like, it's turned like, man, unfortunately, the results were filled with jargon that I didn't understand at all.

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:42.360
On your part, you mean in your raps, but you're like, I'm in an MRI and I got a dick in my eye.

01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:45.360
How did you not rap about being in the MRI machine?

01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:47.360
It leads for the first 10 minutes.

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.360
It's hard to rhyme.

01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:50.360
I'm gonna do a little oblongata, you know.

01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:53.360
I feel my optic nerve heating up.

01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:56.360
I feel my frontal lobe cooling down.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:58.360
All right.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.360
And you're like, I'm trying too hard.

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:00.360
Pull me out, pull me out.

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:05.360
All right, no, but what part of the brain is active when you're in the flow state?

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:06.360
Like, that's the thing.

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:08.360
It's a combination of lobes.

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:16.360
And I'll have to like, I'd have to like send you the shit because like the front part turns off in a couple of this like parietal temporal turn.

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:19.360
Like it's, it's, it was a complicated thing that they were showing happens.

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:29.360
They put like chess players, like chess masters under CAT scans or MRIs and the, they showed them images of chess boards.

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:36.360
Like of a game, like in like middle game or end game or early game, like, like openings or something like that.

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:42.360
And the same part of their brain lit up that is the same part of your brain that lights up when you see a face that you recognize.

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:43.360
And you go, oh, that's Dan Harmon.

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:44.360
Oh, that's Mike.

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:45.360
Oh, that's Spencer.

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:48.360
They see chess boards as people.

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:51.360
So we should all be spending a lot more time in MRI machines.

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:53.360
Like, like, like this technology is important.

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:59.360
Like we should all just be spending like six hours a day in MRI machines and pooling the results.

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:02.360
They get a lot of money to put shit in MRI machines and see what happens.

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:13.360
Like Dan, you were saying that you got better, like you've been getting better at being in the flow state wrapping over time because you can actually rewire those synapses to create new flow.

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.360
Well, that's what I think is interesting.

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:19.360
Like, well, because remember this, the Ken Keezy metaphor that you told me about?

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:23.360
Like, you ever read Electric Kool-Aid Asset Test?

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:32.360
Ken Keezy, he had this metaphor that for being in the moment, which was like, which is the same thing you're talking about this flow state.

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:40.360
His metaphor was that you walk up to a player piano with the role going and that you, of course, if you didn't know how to play piano, you'd be like,

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:45.360
you could try to play this weird game where you tried to like imitate the keys.

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:48.360
And this is also in Westworld's title sequence.

01:11:48.360 --> 01:12:01.360
But that you, that Ken Keezy had this like concept of if you take enough acid or if you get enough in the moment.

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:02.360
Your fingers fall into those.

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:09.360
Your fingers will start to get so fast because what's stopping you is thinking about observing the keys and blah, blah, blah.

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:19.360
And then, but then the further philosophical concept was that you could get into that state so much that you could finish the song

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:26.360
and then look up and see that the player role didn't have the end of the song on it, that you had known the song itself.

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:27.360
So it's the same thing.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:30.360
And Olympic athletes say essentially the same thing.

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:35.360
Like, because people want to know for very good reasons how the fuck did you jump that high?

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:39.360
I mean, but isn't it similar with writing, too, though, because like I'm like,

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:40.360
I'd like to think so.

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:47.360
Right. Most people can't, most people can't like consciously remember like the mind state they were in when they wrote their best shit or had their best ideas.

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:51.360
Like kind of you just, you're in the moment so much that you kind of separate from it.

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:54.360
Even when I have an amazing show like this one, I'm in a total blackout.

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:55.360
I don't know what's going on.

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:58.360
I'll find out later that we won a podcastie.

01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:11.360
No, but yeah, and that's what's interesting to note is that it practicing shit so often has to do with actually you have to learn some shit,

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:16.360
but then it's like you got to unlearn thinking about it.

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:21.360
They say that like learning a craft like learning piano.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:26.360
If there's genius inside you, the craft will liberate the genius.

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:32.360
So working on something like working on rhyming, working on music, working on writing,

01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:41.360
the hard work that it takes will liberate the genius inside you that was always there.

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.360
Can we try an exercise?

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:44.360
Let's just go back and forth like dueling banjo style.

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:45.360
Okay.

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:47.360
You can just like you're teaching me to drive.

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:50.360
You just do a little bit like what's the definite?

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:52.360
What's a good like short attention span?

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:57.360
You do like a couple of do a little bit and then I'll do a little bit and then you do a little bit.

01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:01.360
Are we going to beat or are we going acapella?

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.360
Oh, should we go acapella?

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.360
I mean, we can just, you know.

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:08.360
I put a real simple beat on.

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:11.360
I got one of them, but yours are going to be better, I'm sure.

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.360
You got what you got?

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:16.360
Well, as Harry Foster, he gave us some beats.

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:18.360
You want to try one of his?

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:21.360
Yeah, then we'd have to switch the deal.

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:26.360
You do yours because you get, you have your finger on the knob a little better than over there.

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:36.360
Red leather, yellow leather, hip hop to the hippity hop.

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:38.360
Dan, can I give you some improv advice?

01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:41.360
Overthink it.

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:42.360
That's so good.

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:45.360
Have you just came up with that right now?

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:48.360
Look, look, look, Mike, he's already, he's already freaking out.

01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:49.360
Tell us this.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:53.360
No, I'm loosening it, look at me, I'm like the air.

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:59.360
I am the sun, I'm the air.

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.360
Shit, I don't know what I got.

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:07.360
Yo, I'm not even saying yo because I'm not thinking about it.

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:09.360
I like this one.

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:16.360
Well, well, well, water, ocean, waves, sky, fuck your mama, came in her eye.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:20.360
Okay, see, now why does it always have to be fucking somebody's mama?

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.360
I don't know because I think about that because it's edible.

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:30.360
Okay, but look, but look, but look, but look, I'll stop you right there because you're doing something in a lot of freestyle raffer zoo.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.360
Thank you.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.360
It's called having a crutch.

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:33.360
Oh.

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:42.360
But like, but like, no, no, no, that's not, that wasn't meant to deflate.

01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:47.360
Like mine used to be when I first started, mine used to be when I'm on the mic, right?

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:48.360
I love that.

01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.360
It'd be like, my name is Mike Eagle.

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:52.360
When up on the mic, I say hi to people.

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:53.360
Like, you know what I mean?

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:57.360
Like, every fucking bar was that.

01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:00.360
But that's some people doing yours happens to be fucking your mama.

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:02.360
Second verse, same as the first.

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:03.360
A little bit louder.

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.360
Well, my name's Chef Daniels and I'm here to say.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:08.360
All right, well, so how do you deal with crutches?

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.360
Did you take a hacksaw to them?

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:12.360
Yeah, you become conscious of them and you just try not to.

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:17.360
But it's there for a reason because we do that to help us get, help us fill the time

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:21.360
between what we said and where we have to get to.

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:27.360
So, so like my therapist would say, she would say, when she takes me through meditation,

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:31.360
she says a thousand times your mind will wander a thousand times.

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:32.360
It can come back.

01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:33.360
Bring it back.

01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:38.360
So if I say fucked your mama, you guys don't start like booing and throwing chairs.

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.360
It's it's my mind.

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:45.360
I got back into the old habit, but and you know it and you become increasingly aware of the crutch.

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:49.360
Because what you'll do, you'll just find other ways to get to where you have to get with the timing

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:52.360
and you just won't say that particular thing every time.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.360
All right.

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:55.360
By the year 2017.

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.360
It's now.

01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:01.360
I'm not going to fuck anyone's mama in a rap.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:08.360
Oh, rapping.

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:11.360
Oh, rapping.

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.360
It's that easy, people.

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.360
It's that easy.

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:17.360
Salt, pepper, fork, spoon.

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.360
Oh, son of the moon.

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:22.360
I got a solar system that's going round and round.

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:25.360
I got my voice in my brain and the brain is the sound.

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:26.360
I got to flow through the rap.

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:27.360
I got to flow through the people.

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:33.360
Here's the motherfucking church and I don't go to the steeple because I go to the altar and I pray to God.

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:36.360
I drop down to my knees and I let him through my body.

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:45.360
I want to get down with you to the break of dawn.

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.360
Go, Mike.

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:47.360
Go, Mike.

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:53.360
Hey, he didn't fuck one mother in that at all.

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:56.360
No mother's reflection in the course of that rap.

01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:57.360
Yeah, yeah.

01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:00.360
No mother's who's fucked and no uppercuts.

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:03.360
Make bread like the company butternut with the squash.

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:05.360
How we do it when we wash them seeds?

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:08.360
They think they old when they come through getting washed.

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:10.360
Yeah, got to stop and take it back.

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:13.360
That's how we do it because the flow's never whacked.

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.360
But how we do it, that's another crush.

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:18.360
And you can go back to that one and try not to say it so much.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.360
Yeah.

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:21.360
Yeah, not so much.

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:23.360
You don't do much and you don't do such.

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:26.360
If you don't do what you're supposed to do, then you do what you're going to do.

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:29.360
If you don't do what you're going to do, you do what you've always done.

01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:31.360
I'm going to have fun and run in the sun.

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:36.360
I'm going to be on the beach and make another one of my buns by cooking it in an oven

01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:39.360
and putting it in the shoving with my dick.

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.360
Okay.

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:41.360
Yeah.

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:43.360
You put your dick in the muffin if you want to.

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:45.360
Fuck the bread and prompt to.

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:46.360
Yeah.

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:48.360
That's how you got to do it.

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:51.360
That's how we do it when we make it to new music.

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:55.360
It's loose and see through your own brain patterns from here to Saturn.

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:56.360
It doesn't matter.

01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:57.360
We can scatter.

01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:58.360
Just like Scatagories.

01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:01.360
And you can listen to this new rapping story.

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:02.360
What?

01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:03.360
Oh, rapping.

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:04.360
Still like a table.

01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:05.360
Put your mama.

01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:06.360
What the fuck are you doing?

01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:07.360
Alright.

01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:08.360
Take it easy.

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:09.360
Go with the flow.

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:10.360
You're going to laugh at some things.

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:11.360
I'm going to go high and low.

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:14.360
I'm not thinking about what I'm saying anymore.

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:17.360
I'm going to, I'm praying for what I want to go through the door.

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:19.360
I want God to come in and light us up.

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:25.360
I want to suck the devil's dick and spit it up into the devil's face until he comes from his eyes.

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.360
I want to give you all a spiritual surprise.

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:30.360
I want to go up to heaven and pray to God.

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:35.360
I'm going to say everybody come down and General Zod's going to fight Superman, but he can't win.

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:37.360
It doesn't matter who he brings.

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:38.360
Superman's going to win.

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:40.360
He's going to shoot him with his laser eyes.

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:44.360
Christopher Reeves died.

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.360
We didn't want him to.

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:48.360
We didn't want him to.

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:54.360
Oh, yeah.

01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:56.360
That was a breakthrough.

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:58.360
That was a breakthrough for us.

01:19:58.360 --> 01:19:59.360
That was great.

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:03.360
That was fucking great.

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:04.360
I want to Spencer to rap.

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:06.360
Spencer's not going to rap at all?

01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:07.360
Yeah, Mike.

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:08.360
I'm not good at it.

01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:12.360
You gave Dan like a, like you gave him freedom to like free fall a bit.

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.360
Yeah, man.

01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:16.360
There's that feeling of abandonment.

01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:17.360
That's right.

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:18.360
Yeah.

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:22.360
I feel like you need to come back every week so I can have therapy sessions like that.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:24.360
I'll come back like two weeks.

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:25.360
Okay.

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:27.360
All right.

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:32.360
Well, we have technically a half hour left until the show ends when we usually end it.

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:36.360
We usually end it with a rap.

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:39.360
Well, I do actually perform rap songs professionally.

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:40.360
Yeah.

01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:41.360
So if I could do...

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:43.360
This is a good time for a musical guest.

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:44.360
All right.

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:45.360
Like you.

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:46.360
I'm here.

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:47.360
I'm here.

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:48.360
Open my giggle.

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:49.360
How much should I do?

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:50.360
Should I just do...

01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:53.360
I'll do very much money.

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:54.360
That's a great call.

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:55.360
I was going to do that anyway.

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:58.360
Does it make you nervous for me to be sitting here or should I go off stage?

01:20:58.360 --> 01:20:59.360
No, no, no.

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:00.360
This is fine.

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:02.360
This is actually a very loving environment we've created.

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:05.360
And I really fucking appreciate it, man.

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:06.360
Yo.

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:07.360
Yo.

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:08.360
Oh, sorry.

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:09.360
Sorry.

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:35.360
Yo, yo, oh, sorry, sorry.

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:53.360
I just need some help with the finances, but hello, my name is Mike Eagle.

01:21:53.360 --> 01:22:01.360
How the fuck are you guys doing tonight?

01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:11.360
What's up, guys?

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:21.360
What's up, guys?

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:35.360
What's up, guys?

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:47.360
What's up, guys?

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:57.360
What's up, guys?
