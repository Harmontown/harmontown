{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:13.000\nWho's got a pen? I need to steal a pen from somebody. Can you tell me a pen, brother?\n\n00:13.000 --> 00:20.000\nFrom Burbank, California, at Starburn's Castle, it's the very first time that Harmontown is in session\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:27.000\nfrom the beautiful confines of the weird, warehouse-y thing that is Starburn's Castle.\n\n00:27.000 --> 00:34.000\nLet's bring out Spencer Crittenden and Charlie.\n\n00:34.000 --> 00:41.000\nWhat up? Oh, yeah. It feels good, doesn't it? It feels in session.\n\n00:41.000 --> 00:48.000\nIt feels extra sexy. Speaking of extra sexy, let's bring out the mayor.\n\n00:48.000 --> 00:57.000\nThe mayor of Harmontown is Dan Harmon. Thank you.\n\n00:57.000 --> 01:05.000\nAll right. Thanks for joining us at a temporary location or whatever, an experimental location.\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:13.000\nIs it not permanent? What's the status? I don't know. I don't make big moves. I work organically.\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:19.000\nWhy do they call you big moves, Harmon? It's an ironic nickname. In prison, they called me tiny,\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:24.000\nbecause the average height is 5'5\", and I was like, you know.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:30.000\nSo how was prison? Prison was great. What were you in for again?\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:35.000\nI started watching the show, what the hell is it called, World's Most Dangerous Prisons,\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:42.000\nor Inside Them or something like that? It's called Inside Them, Colin, World's Most Dangerous Prisons.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:52.000\nIt's some guy who is kind of, he's from wherever the, what the shrimpy guy,\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:57.000\nwhat's his name, he's in the phone booth thing where he's got to talk on the phone or he gets shot.\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:02.000\nColin Farrell. Colin Farrell. It's this guy that looks like him.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:03.000\nHe's shrimpy?\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:06.000\nHe's a little shrimp. I don't think he's a large man. I don't think Colin Farrell.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:13.000\nThey call him a moose.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:17.000\nThere's a guy and then he goes and he gets himself locked up in the world's most dangerous prisons\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:23.000\nthroughout the world. There's a prison in Honduras, I guess that's the murder capital of the world.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:27.000\nThat's probably an easy title to claim, like best pizza or whatever.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:33.000\nBut the prison there, it's like built for like, I don't know, let's say 70 people,\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:37.000\nI'm pulling numbers out of my ass. There's like 700 people in it.\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:42.000\nIt's like very overcrowded as most prisons are. We are generating more bad people than good people these days.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:50.000\nIt's a buyer's market. They, at a certain point, it's like, it's escaped from New York.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:59.000\nThey like, the guards pulled out and they just like rolled wooden batons like by the box in there\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:04.000\nand said like, whoever the people you trust the most are, they're the new guards.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:12.000\nAnd so some of the murderers have sticks and that's their system and it works really well.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:18.000\nLike the guards can't go in there. They go in there at night to lock up.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:20.000\nI guess they have like, it's sort of like...\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:24.000\nWouldn't the bad guys get the sticks first?\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:31.000\nThe bad guys have the sticks, as one would argue in all of society.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:35.000\nIt just kind of tends to be that way. Good guys don't want sticks.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:44.000\nAnd so in this prison, some of the rapists and murderers have been deputized to beat the other ones that get out of line.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:51.000\nBut they're deputizing each other? They're saying, hey, crazy guy, you like sticks, how do they pick it?\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:57.000\nI don't know how they picked it. There's a guy at the top that insists he profits nothing from it.\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:04.000\nWho says, well, telling you, if you want a bed, it costs $135 and all this stuff.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:10.000\nThe whole place has a kind of... I mean, there was no... Everyone's like lifting weights and everything's very scary\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:15.000\nand everyone's kind of leering at you. But what you didn't see was like mass chaos.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:22.000\nAnd it was just this Colin Farrell looking guy going like, oh, I'm filling buckets of water.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:28.000\nAnd then he would go and talk to all the mucky mucks within this system, none of whom are guards.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:34.000\nAnd then he'd shoot pool with the guards on the outside of the system that the guards are guarding but can't get in.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:39.000\nThe guards' job? To make sure that all 700 of these people don't at some point go, hey, there's 700 of us.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:45.000\nLet's all escape at the same time. That is their single task is to keep that day from happening.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:54.000\nHow they do that? I guess it has something to do with the fact that what separates the prison from the rest of Honduras,\n\n04:54.000 --> 05:02.000\nwhich is like a chain link fence that you had at your grade school playground, which drugs are just flying back and forth over the top of it.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:06.000\nI think the people in there are kind of happy. The prisoners are... I mean, they're like...\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:11.000\nThey'd like to be out if they could leave any time they wanted, but they can't leave any time they wanted,\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:16.000\nso they've created a society for themselves that includes weekend-long conjugal visits.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:20.000\nThe wives and children come to visit them. They showed that weekend happening.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:27.000\nAnd there's no, if you fuck with the wives or children during that weekend, it's like...\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:33.000\nObviously, there's repercussions. There's repercussions if you piss off fucking murderers that have sticks.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:41.000\nI'm doing... The law is laid down within that prison, and then the guards shooting billiards with the host of the show\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:47.000\nwho's saying, like, how's it... Do you guys want to have control back?\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:51.000\nBecause one time they tried to take control back, and everyone just went...\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:57.000\nAnd waved their shirts around like strippers and threw garbage cans at them, and they had to leave.\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:05.000\nThey're like, okay, all right, we'll come look for drugs later. And they were like, yay, we're in prison!\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:07.000\nWe're free!\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:11.000\nHow do you think you would handle prison if you had to do, like, real time, like federal time?\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:17.000\nI would start by killing myself the day I was sentenced to prison, because guys like me do not...\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nNo matter what movies you've seen.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:25.000\nNow, okay, let's get specific. Day one, you're in prison. You go, okay, I want to kill myself.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:29.000\nI'm going to be here for six years. I want to kill myself. How do you do it?\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:35.000\nWait, no, no, no, I do it in court when the judge says, you're going to print, and I go, bang, bang, bang!\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:39.000\nI take his gavel and I stick it through my eyeball.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:45.000\nBecause if he did the print, I knew the rest of the word would be isn't.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:47.000\nSo I'm just like, gouge, gouge.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:51.000\nDo you think you could make it from the desk you sit at to the gavel?\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:53.000\nWithout a bailiff?\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:59.000\nI mean, look, if Batman was in the gallery, you know, in one movie where Batman couldn't even make it\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:05.000\nto protect Harvey Dent from getting his face toed.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:07.000\nRemember that movie? Batman's in court.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:09.000\nIt was Batman outfit.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:13.000\nThey explained Harvey Dent's turning into Two-Face.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:15.000\nIt was one of those older Batman movies.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:17.000\nThere was a mafia guy, and he had a reveal.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:20.000\nHe had a jar of poison on the witness stand, and he went, hey!\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:24.000\nAnd then it cut to Batman in the court going, no!\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:27.000\nAnd then it cut to Harvey Dent going, yikes!\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:35.000\nAnd holding a Manila folder across half of his face, hence his transformation into Two-Face.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:37.000\nA folder?\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:42.000\nYeah, I guess it's an older movie than you kids have seen.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:46.000\nThat was the Dark Knight Rises, right? Returns or something?\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:48.000\nThis was the second of these Nolan Batman movies.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:51.000\nNo, no, I don't think it was a Nolan movie.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:53.000\nI think that was a...\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:56.000\nDoesn't he hold up a folder in that new one, too?\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.000\nI think it's a folder.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:04.000\nI think everyone holds up a folder when Bane takes over because he goes like, I give you back your city!\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:07.000\nHold your folders high!\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:09.000\nAnd everyone holds up a folder.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.000\nI think that's what you're thinking of.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nSo Dan, you're a new gun owner.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:14.000\nSay what?\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:16.000\nYou got a weapon now. You got a gun.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:24.000\nI haven't picked it up yet because it seems like it's as hard to usurp democracy as it is to maintain it.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:27.000\nI feel like this whole country is just going to collapse.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:31.000\nWere you getting a gun to overthrow democracy?\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:44.000\nI was getting a gun to protect my soup and women in the event of total economic destabilization,\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:53.000\nwhich might result in my neighborhood looking up at my home, which looks like Victor Frankenstein's home,\n\n08:53.000 --> 09:00.000\nlike in a village of people who only know that I've been robbing their graves to assemble some sort of monster.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:06.000\nI just wanted to have a power tool in my home that can make...\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\nDrills, holes, and faces.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:14.000\nAnd people that want water, you know, more than they want politeness.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:20.000\nDo you have fantasies about, like, actually, like, you must, because you've bought a gun.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:25.000\nWhat would happen if somebody came up your steps and demanded your water from your weapon?\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:27.000\nNo, I would argue that that is fallacious logic.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:33.000\nI bought the gun because I don't have fantasies about what I'd do if shit went that far.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:41.000\nThat's why I wanted to buy the gun is from the impulse of feeling like I am not a person that could be relied upon\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:48.000\nin a situation of such heightened crisis that, you know, so, no, I don't sit and think,\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\nman, I hope a guy comes up my sidewalk.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nWell, I'm not saying you hope that happens, but like...\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nNo, but I also have an entertain...\n\n09:54.000 --> 10:08.000\nI just have a vague cloud of chaos in my head where I'm like, well, look what has happened in the first 10 days of this presidency\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:14.000\nmade me look at the 10-day waiting period that you need to get a gun as a crucial 10 days.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:22.000\nAnd I now have what makes me feel very comfortable, which is a one-day, a drive to Burbank waiting period.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:27.000\nI have a gun waiting for me in a store run by guys who know how to use guns.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:33.000\nI wanted to, you know, so I'm saying like, I'm feeling better now.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:35.000\nMaybe that's what the waiting period is for.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nIt's sitting over there.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nI can go pick it up any time.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:41.000\nIt's probably better there than in my cabinet.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:45.000\nWhen you were shopping around for, like, on our little Slack...\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:47.000\nWhat is Slack?\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:51.000\nSlack, it's a coordinating app for communicating with teens.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:53.000\nNo, teams.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:55.000\nTeams.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:57.000\nI was thinking of Snapchat.\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:59.000\nYou're thinking of 4chan.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.000\nYeah.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:05.000\nThere's the Burbank firing line, which I've been to a couple of times.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:09.000\nI'm not a gun guy, but I've shot there a couple of times with friends that have guns.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:12.000\nIt's fun to go shoot a gun, but I wouldn't ever want one.\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:19.000\nBut I just found out that gun, indoor firing ranges, there's loads of fucking suicides.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:22.000\nPeople go in there and they've had three suicides.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:24.000\nOh, people actually go there to kill themselves.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:26.000\nNo, they go in there to rent a bullet.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.000\nThey go, oh, here's my credit card. I'll be right back.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:30.000\nAnd they go, bang!\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:33.000\nAnd they fucking shoot their fucking brains all over the person next to them.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:37.000\nAnd there's been three suicides with the firing line recently.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:39.000\nAnd apparently that's not just there. It's everywhere.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:43.000\nNow, what do we think of that person? Is that person a bad person? Is that person a...\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:45.000\nYeah, they suck.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.000\nI think that person is a good planner.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:50.000\nI'm glad they don't shoot other people. It'd be so easy.\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:53.000\nAnd then, you know, it's just the people who would be at a gun range, so it's not like zeroes.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nRight. Well, that's the first thing.\n\n11:55.000 --> 12:00.000\nThey're revealing that in the throes of depression enough that life means absolutely nothing to them,\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:04.000\nthat they don't do something that you could do if you thought life meant nothing,\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:09.000\nwhich is cheat at the Grand Theft Auto game of life and just go bling, blang, bloom, bloom,\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:12.000\nlike just to see what would happen before you boo-boomed.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:17.000\nSo, in a way, gun ranges provide a valuable, like, suicide-booth service.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:21.000\nI just think that's really interesting.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:24.000\nI don't think I could ever go back to a firing range and be relaxed.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:29.000\nI'm not relaxed because you're holding a gun. It's stressful.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:33.000\nThe firing line in Burbank on Victory, I think, I went there once.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:34.000\nI'd never fired a gun. They said,\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:36.000\nSir, have you ever fired a weapon before? I said, No, I haven't.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:42.000\nThey go, All right, so fill this out. You have to sign some waivers and shit.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:47.000\nAnd they said, The first thing that you're going to shoot here is the.357 Magnum,\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.000\nwhich is a cannon.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:52.000\nAnd this is to teach you some respect.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:55.000\nAnd it was fucking bonkers.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:59.000\nThat thing is so loud and so scary that I couldn't ever relax.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:02.000\nBut now, if I think that the guy next to me might just go,\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:06.000\nI want to fucking kill myself.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:08.000\nWell, I think you're going to laugh when I say this,\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:11.000\nbut there's something very uplifting about that.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:17.000\nBecause we're constantly talking to, we're arguing between people,\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:21.000\nlike, well, in a pre-Trump era, there was a big religious connotation\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:23.000\nthat had to do with the division between the left and the right,\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nparticularly in the idea of like,\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:30.000\nOh, what are we going to do if there's no God, there's no morality in all this stuff?\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:34.000\nAnd like the, you know, practical minded atheists among us,\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:40.000\nthe people, it's like, I don't need a bookie man or a fairy tale\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:45.000\nor a superstition, not to devalue anything that anyone has a personal relationship with,\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:51.000\nbut I'm just saying like, people don't need that in order to do the cool thing,\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:53.000\nto do the nice thing.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:57.000\nAn argument could be made that people are particularly geared to,\n\n13:57.000 --> 14:01.000\nas a perfect example of a situation, you're holding a gun,\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:04.000\nthere's literally a lane of people on either side of you.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:11.000\nYou've come here because you have decided that life itself means so little.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:15.000\nYou obviously aren't fearing that you're going to wake up in a pool of lava\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.000\nwith like pitchforks going up your butt,\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:21.000\nbecause those people definitely make sure you know that suicide's one of the things\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:22.000\nthat will make that happen.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:25.000\nSo you have made your peace with chaos.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nYou have made your peace with oblivion.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:32.000\nYou have an emotional thing going on in your head with a pain of living is so high\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:34.000\nthat you just want it to end.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:40.000\nAnd you don't, as you step out the door, do this horrible, trollish thing.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:43.000\nYou know, that is not what most of us want to do.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:46.000\nWe are not held in line by getting away with it.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:48.000\nThere's no cops in this room.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:52.000\nThere's no cops like, there's no cops in this room.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:55.000\nWhee!\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:57.000\nIf there's one outside, he wouldn't let me walk in that door.\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:00.000\nThere are paid employees of Harmontown that could fucking kill you\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:02.000\nif I snap my fingers.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:04.000\nDo not heckle me.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:08.000\nBut there are no cops in this room, man.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:13.000\nBut it's like we are not held in line by, you know, we are not animals.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:16.000\nAnd these Honduran prisoners are, you know,\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:20.000\nthe guy is cutting vegetables with a guy that killed someone with a machete.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:24.000\nAnd he's saying, it's weird, I'm cutting cucumbers,\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:26.000\nand you cut someone with a machete.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:29.000\nAnd he's like, huh, what the hell, yeah!\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:31.000\nSo true!\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:34.000\nChop, chop, chop, chop.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:36.000\nI don't know how that supported my point,\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:39.000\nbut it was just something that popped in my head.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nIt's a reason why I want to keep watching this series.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:43.000\nAre you getting a gun, Spencer?\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:46.000\nI don't know. Should I get a gun, you guys?\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:50.000\nNo. I think I heard one yes and one no.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:52.000\nSo there it is.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:55.000\nNo, you posted a very...\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:58.000\nYou're very passionately anti-gun.\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:01.000\nI know a lot of things.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:03.000\nAnd here's what I know.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:05.000\nGuns kill people.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nI don't want to kill people.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:10.000\nI got to say, Dan, I know you don't like being like a game-stated,\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nbut I don't like the gun thing.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:14.000\nIt makes me uncomfortable.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:16.000\nThe decision to get a gun is not a thing\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:18.000\nthat I don't expect to be game-stated on, okay?\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:20.000\nSo you're right. I don't like to be game-stated.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:22.000\nWhat the fuck is game-stated?\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:24.000\nIt's for the apocalypse.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:27.000\nI brought it up as a confessional thing\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:31.000\nbecause I consider that purchase a...\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:34.000\nI'm confessing about it.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:39.000\nI'm not telling people that I did the smartest thing in the world\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:41.000\nthat I recommend everyone do.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:44.000\nI'm sharing with people\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:46.000\nthat these are crazy times\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nand that we're all dealing with it in weird ways\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:51.000\nand that liberals are becoming anti-Nazis\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:53.000\nand anti-Nazis are becoming Nazis\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:57.000\nand the people who used to say\n\n16:57.000 --> 17:00.000\nmaybe freedom of speech is overrated\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:03.000\nare now saying, I love the Second Amendment.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:06.000\nIt's confusing times and we're scared\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:09.000\nand how are we dealing with it and what do we do?\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:11.000\nI wanted to...\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nI'm not a person with solutions\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:15.000\nand I'm not a pundit and I'm not an academic.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:17.000\nI dropped out of college\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:20.000\nso I'm going to share what I'm going through.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:22.000\nI'm not going to leave a fucking molecule out of it.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:24.000\nI bought a gun.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:31.000\nI bought a gun because that's how close\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:35.000\nto the doomsday line it feels,\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:37.000\nthe clock thing with the doomsday clock.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:40.000\nWhat do they call it? The doomsday clock.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:43.000\nI bought a gun because of the unknown.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:46.000\nI didn't buy a gun because I thought\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:48.000\nanything specific was going to happen.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:51.000\nI bought a gun because for my entire life\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:54.000\nof should I buy a gun,\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:57.000\nthe pachinko ball of logic always ended\n\n17:57.000 --> 17:59.000\nwith of course not.\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:02.000\nAnd now we are in times where it landed somewhere else\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:04.000\nand I think that's notable.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nI don't think it's admirable.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:08.000\nI think it's inspirational.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:11.000\nI immediately already, having since talked about it,\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:13.000\nI got a tweet from a guy that was like,\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:15.000\nwhat would you recommend?\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nWhat did you get the clock thing?\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:19.000\nAnd I was like, whoa, shut it down, shut it down.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:22.000\nI'm not going to have conversations where I proactively influence\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:25.000\nyour decision about these things.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:28.000\nAnd God knows where minutes from another sandy hook\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:31.000\nat which point it's going to take on another religious connotation\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:34.000\nof like holy shit, I'll be ashamed of myself forever\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:37.000\nwith my third gun again for a little while.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:41.000\nSo don't just value my candor, my confession, my honesty.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:43.000\nI don't know what the fuck I'm doing.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:47.000\nI bought this thing because the morning after the election\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:51.000\nI went downstairs and after an evening\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:54.000\nof my girlfriend staring off into space,\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:58.000\nthe moment she saw my dog sitter,\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:02.000\nthey exchanged niceties and then one of them said,\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:04.000\nhow are you doing?\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:06.000\nAnd they both burst into tears and then everywhere I went\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\neveryone had been crying all morning\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nand then they had to dry their tears\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:12.000\nand they were hollow people.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:14.000\nThat had to get back to work.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.000\nAnd I felt emasculated.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.000\nI felt helpless.\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:21.000\nI felt like there was something I had to be able to do.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:23.000\nI'm not Sirhan, Sirhan.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:26.000\nI don't think the thing I need to do involves the gun.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:29.000\nI feel like I have no recourse to power.\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:32.000\nAnd that is an arrogant, narcissistic, white privilege,\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:35.000\nstraight, white, male-like reaction.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:36.000\nThat is notable.\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:38.000\nIt's important to measure it.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:40.000\nI bought a fucking gun.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:44.000\nI didn't delete my Uber app until it was important to defeat Uber\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:48.000\nbecause I was fighting another white guy.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:52.000\nI heard 900 stories from women about how fucking horrible Uber was\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:56.000\nand then the day that it was a way to give another white guy a black eye\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:58.000\nI was like, delete.\n\n19:58.000 --> 19:59.000\nI love Lyft now.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:01.000\nTell me about your podcast.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:03.000\nYou fucking weirdo.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:05.000\nOur next guest is...\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:07.000\nWe should bring out our guest.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:08.000\nWhat am I doing?\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:10.000\nI told him, here's how the show works.\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:13.000\nI go up and I talk for 10 minutes and then I'll bring you up.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:15.000\nOkay, you're ready to go.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:18.000\nI just met this guy on another show that I did.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:20.000\nLet's just get to know him at the same time\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:22.000\nbecause I said you should come on my show\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:26.000\nand he's a rapper and a creator of Beats.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:28.000\nI don't know if the title would be DJ,\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:30.000\nbut his name is Open Mike Eagle.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:44.000\nYou go ahead.\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:46.000\nYou can move everything you want.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:47.000\nI can keep talking too.\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:49.000\nHe brought his own stool on stage.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:52.000\nYeah, that's a power move, I think.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:57.000\nYou're allowed to bring your own furniture on stage.\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:59.000\nThat's the Chicago way.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:02.000\nNot only is it just like I'm adding furniture to the mix,\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:04.000\nbut also like you hefted it with such ease\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:06.000\nthat it's like I'm a powerful man.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:09.000\nYeah, I don't need a gun, I need it.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:11.000\nIt's a small stool though.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:13.000\nNo, I'm not saying it's...\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\nI could move that one around too.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:17.000\nIt's the appearance of power, that's the way it's a power move.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.000\nIt doesn't have to be a heavy stool.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:22.000\nHe brought it up on stage like he made it.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:26.000\nHe carved it out of a single piece of wood.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nLet's do a test while Mike Eagle...\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:31.000\nChris, are we ready to do a test where we...\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:35.000\nWhat if I said I wanted to cut to a photo for the...\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:36.000\nOh, shit, he's running.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:37.000\nOkay, I didn't mean to do that.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:39.000\nNo, this is the test, this is the test.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:41.000\nI didn't realize, I didn't know...\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:43.000\nIn the future, you might be able to...\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:45.000\nWe could just walk probably, walking.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:48.000\nChris, what if I said I wanted...\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:50.000\nYeah, we did it.\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:56.000\nWhite people, white people and one honorary woman.\n\n21:56.000 --> 22:00.000\nSo, how do they let a woman sneak into that fucking photo\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:03.000\nof creepy, gross, just...\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:06.000\nThis is a poster of, now you see me too, I think.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:08.000\nLook at their...\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:11.000\nI want to talk about a theory I have about this photo,\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:13.000\nor rather an obsession I have about this photo.\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:18.000\nNow, assumption number one that I'm allowed to make\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:19.000\nbecause of the geometry of this photo.\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:22.000\nThis is a tripod-mounted photograph.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:25.000\nThis is not a quick...\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:31.000\nHey, secretary of labor, labor us a photo with your Samsung,\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:34.000\nwhile people hack it so they can see nuclear launch codes\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:36.000\nin your fucking patio.\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:42.000\nThe lines are lined up here, this is a tripod-mounted shot.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:46.000\nIt's been swiveled because any human in their right mind\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:49.000\nwould center the desk in the frame.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:54.000\nThere are an almost equal number of people on both sides\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:58.000\nunless you count homophobic pants over here\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:01.000\nwho I think was either...\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:04.000\nI'm trying to figure out if he's doing a power play\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:05.000\nand showed up late.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:07.000\nNo, he set the timer.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:09.000\nHe was the guy that went over to the camera.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:15.000\nWait, Jeff, no. I'm sorry, but the camera's been swiveled.\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:17.000\nDo you understand?\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:21.000\nOn what the audience is right side of the frame,\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:23.000\nwhat you see is you could measure that line.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:27.000\nYou would take half of that line and you would put it over here.\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:29.000\nIf you wanted to know where the frame would be\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:31.000\nif this desk were centered.\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:34.000\nIt would cut right across Pence's shoulder.\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:36.000\nAnd if Pence wasn't in the shot,\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:39.000\nby the way, over here, Herman Munster,\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:44.000\nsecretary of fucking crazy pumpkin head thumbs,\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:47.000\na living golem from the...\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:50.000\nnot from Lord of the Rings, from the Hebrew tradition,\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:56.000\nan animated man brought here for the purpose of vengeance.\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:58.000\nAnd behind him, who has two thumbs\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:01.000\nand looks like Chris Farley's ghost?\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:09.000\nThat guy's head would be a little over to the right.\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:11.000\nHe wouldn't be bent like that.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:14.000\nHe is scrunching in because the camera moved this way.\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:16.000\nThe camera moved this way.\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:21.000\nI believe that these two aren't getting along for good reason.\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:24.000\nI don't think Pence was told this photo was happening.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:25.000\nHe ran in last second.\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:27.000\nI think he was taking a shit.\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:30.000\nHe walked by the Oval Office if that's where this is.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:31.000\nIt looks ovular to me.\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:33.000\nI want to know more about the guy with the orange tie.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:36.000\nNo one wears an orange fucking tie.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:39.000\nIt's very clear that you wear red or blue ties.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:42.000\nThis guy's got a Halloween tie back there.\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:44.000\nAlso, she only gets one thumb.\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:46.000\nAll the guys got two thumbs.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:50.000\nIt's a shame that women only have one thumb for every two thumbs a man makes.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:53.000\nWomen actually only get 70% of thumbs.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:59.000\nWomen only get eight oceans to every 11 oceans a man makes.\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:04.000\nRemember when the national conversation would have been about zero black people in the photo?\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:06.000\nIt would have been just a talking point.\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:08.000\nIt's not that we don't notice it.\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:13.000\nIt's that we know they're white nationalists and we have bigger fish to fry now.\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:15.000\nWe're like, yeah, well, they're racist.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.000\nThey haven't made any bones about that.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:21.000\nSo we're moving on because we're like, how do we get them out of there?\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:26.000\nWe're no longer policing them and going like, it would be nice to see some diversity in that photo.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:33.000\nWe're like, hey, is there anything in this photo that can show us their weakness?\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:37.000\nAlso, has there ever been a kryptonite barrel in the corner?\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:42.000\nHas there ever been a desk that big that didn't have a fucking book or a pen on it?\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:43.000\nIt's a desk.\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:45.000\nHe doesn't have any shit on it.\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:47.000\nHe clearly doesn't want desks.\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:48.000\nHe doesn't want to be at that desk.\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:49.000\nThat's not a good desk.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:51.000\nThat's not a desk of someone who uses a desk.\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:55.000\nIt's a good desk for finding the book of secrets.\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:58.000\nBut remember, remember Obama's first couple days in office?\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:00.000\nHey, Mike, keep it down, would you?\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:02.000\nI was. Thanks.\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:08.000\nI remember when one of the first things, because they have to, it was like, Obama with the Hitler mustaches.\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:10.000\nOh, it's the end of the world, Obama's president.\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:15.000\nOh, God, how can we, how will we live through two years of this, four years of this, eight years of this?\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:17.000\nIt's a black man in the White House.\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:18.000\nWe're all going to die.\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:20.000\nAnd the first thing was, look at him.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:25.000\nHe's not even wearing his jacket at the desk, because the first photo was him with his shirt sleeves rolled up,\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:29.000\nand he was on the phone, fucking papers everywhere, getting to work.\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:34.000\nAnd then somebody split-screened it with Kennedy, and it was, it was like, yeah, I'm a civil servant.\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:39.000\nI fucked Marilyn Monroe, but I also, I want work to get done.\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:40.000\nAll right, anyways, whatever.\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:41.000\nWhen did I become political?\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:43.000\nThe answer is when we started dying.\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:48.000\nThere was a great Twitter moment where somebody posted this picture and said,\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:51.000\nwhat's this mixtape called?\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:53.000\nAnd then everybody was sending in answers.\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:54.000\nIt was great.\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:57.000\nMine was Male White Marauders.\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:59.000\nThis is the name of this picture.\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:03.000\nIt's a hip-hop joke, I'm sorry.\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:10.000\nYeah, well, let's talk about the fact that, about hip-hop jokes that we won't get.\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:12.000\nI'm so full of those, yeah.\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:18.000\nWe just met, like, I didn't have time, I'm not going to pretend I'm like, oh, I'm a huge fan of open mic eagle,\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:21.000\nbut I liked what you were doing in the show that I met you in, and then I was like, after the show,\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:25.000\nlike, you should come and do my show, but I know nothing about you.\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:30.000\nI know you're from Chicago, I know that you're, like, what was your upbringing like?\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:32.000\nOh shit, it was fucked up.\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:38.000\nI lived like, like, right by the projects, like not in them, but kind of like, right by them, and shit.\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:43.000\nAnd I went to elementary school that was, like, nestled within the projects, so I had,\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:51.000\nI lived with my grandparents, my mom was fucked up, and yeah, I had to try to have, like, a normal childhood,\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:56.000\nexcept they kept me very sheltered, and there's, like, gunshots and crack cocaine and all that,\n\n27:56.000 --> 28:01.000\nand you had uncles and aunts, they're all strung out on shit, but they kept me in the house,\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:07.000\nso, like, I just watched a shit ton of, like, fucking cable television in the late 80s and early 90s a lot.\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:08.000\nRaised by your grandparents?\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:09.000\nYeah.\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:12.000\nAnd so what was their take on the world around?\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:13.000\nStay inside.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:14.000\nThat was it.\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:16.000\nStay, don't, don't go outside.\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:24.000\nDid they have, as a white, naive question, did they have a take that was racially based?\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:30.000\nLike, did they have talks with you about what to do when the cops and blah, blah, blah, what other black people do?\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:33.000\nMy grandparents were black people.\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:34.000\nWhat?\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:35.000\nFrom the south.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:38.000\nLet me finish, okay?\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:49.000\nAnd what that meant is all of their talks were alarmingly racist, like, but not in, like, a, like, not in a cute way.\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:55.000\nLike, I had a Japanese seventh grade teacher, and the shit that my sweet old grandmother used to say about that, man,\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:57.000\nit was fucking awful.\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:59.000\nYou know, like, she was a great person, but, you know, she was-\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:01.000\nI think we'd all like to hear.\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:02.000\nI wouldn't, I wouldn't dare.\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:08.000\nSo we could cluck our tongues and also go, yeah, whoa, whoa.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:09.000\nIt's just an example.\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:10.000\nIt would be great.\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:11.000\nSo we know how to judge her.\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:15.000\nYeah, she called, she called her a bunch of shit that obviously was learned in World War II.\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:17.000\nOh, so she would say, like, actual slurs.\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:18.000\nYes.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:21.000\nShe wouldn't just use stereotypes like, how did she drive to teach you?\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:29.000\nNo, it was, it was, because she, you know, she, I don't know, it was just part of lexicon for her to say those awful, awful things.\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:39.000\nNo, but how, and how did she feel about, because she's from a certain generation, like, what was her and your grandpa's, like, their,\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:45.000\nit's like, if they're looking at a Korean person, they might have all kinds of, like, comforting things to say about the other,\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:55.000\nbut what was their feeling about how they fit into their government, their society, their neighborhood, whatever?\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:59.000\nYou know, it was more like, keep your nose to the ground and work.\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:02.000\nThey didn't have a lot of, we didn't have a lot of talk about identity.\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:04.000\nLike, my dad talked to me about a lot of that stuff.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:11.000\nMy grandparents, they were, they were working people and they worked and they wanted to make sure we were safe and did our homework and shit.\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:17.000\nThey could care less about a lot of, you know, a lot of social and racial identity and that kind of thing.\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:19.000\nSo they were just sort of like, were they Christian?\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:20.000\nYeah.\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:25.000\nThey were kind of like, just be a good person and go to church and like, be, like, work hard and stay out of trouble.\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:29.000\nYeah, do your homework, don't hit girls at school, like, you know what I mean?\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:33.000\nLike, just real straight down the middle shit, you know?\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:36.000\nAnd did you mainly adhere to that or were you a rebel in your youth?\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:42.000\nNah, I wore, I wore corduroy's and the sweaters that they brought me from K-Marvel, my grandmother worked.\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:47.000\nSo my rebelling would be not wearing my shirt all the way up to the top.\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:49.000\nThat was my, that was my rebelling.\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:56.000\nAnd what were you interested in when you were like, sixth grade, seventh grade, eighth grade, like, going through puberty, like, what did you imagine?\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:59.000\nWere you scarred by the Japanese teacher you had, did that fuck you up?\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\nNo, I loved him, he was fantastic.\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:03.000\nHe was an amazing person.\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:05.000\nMr. Matsumoto was fucking awesome.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:08.000\nMatsumoto, it's like, like, easy to remember too.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:10.000\nYeah, yeah, he was scarred.\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:11.000\nHe made an impression on me.\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:16.000\nYou could just start making up that name and find your way through it and still be right.\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:19.000\nOkay, alright.\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:22.000\nFuck, I mean, maybe I'm in your grandma's side.\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:25.000\nMaybe I like to dehumanize.\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:31.000\nMaybe that and Christ are blankets I wrap around me at night and maybe the world has no other options for me.\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:45.000\nNo, but what, when you were like, like, pick your age, 10, 11, 12, whatever, but like, at a certain, there's a point where, where your future is like, all, you know, like, like, what was the astronaut dream?\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:56.000\nOr the, like, I remember me and my best friend said, we were going to get a boat and we were going to sail into the Bermuda Triangle and we were going to like, just like, find out what the deal was with the Bermuda Triangle.\n\n31:56.000 --> 32:02.000\nAnd we were pinky swearing, we're like, seriously though, you know how old people get fat and old and then they don't want to do that.\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:11.000\nAnd then we were like, no, for real, I fucking know, we're going to look you up and we're like, we set a date and I, you know, of course I fucked him over.\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:28.000\nI mean, my personal dream like that was that I had romanticized being like, in like, the Secret Service or some shit, but only because in my dumb mind, the Secret Service guys were like, somebody in the government knows everything.\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:30.000\nAnd it's got to be those guys.\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:31.000\nThey're the Secret Service.\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:32.000\nYeah.\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:33.000\nSo they got to know all the secrets.\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:35.000\nThey're not the Ignorant Service.\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:36.000\nExactly.\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:38.000\nThey have a secret in their name.\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:39.000\nSo I wanted to do that.\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:44.000\nIt turns out they're just in charge of counterfeiting and protecting the president, I guess.\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:45.000\nI don't know.\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:48.000\nYeah, that is an interesting answer.\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:50.000\nLike, I'm fascinated by the Secret Service too.\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:54.000\nLike, I wonder like, what their definition of a good guy and a bad guy is?\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:55.000\nLike, what you're supposed to do?\n\n32:55.000 --> 33:00.000\nLike, what if the president grabs a hammer and goes at himself with the claw end of it?\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:02.000\nWhat's your responsibility as a Secret Service guy?\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:04.000\nYou have to like, jump between him and the hammer.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:07.000\nLike, you have to get in between the hammer and him.\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:08.000\nYeah.\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:11.000\nThe whole time he's saying, this is for the American people that I'm doing this.\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:13.000\nThere's a microchip in my head.\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:17.000\nLike, are you supposed to as a Secret Service guy be like, that's impossible?\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:18.000\nYou have to, right?\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:20.000\nOr are you supposed to be like, this is my boss?\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:23.000\nBecause presidents have like, fevers and shit too sometimes.\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:26.000\nOnly they wake up in cold sweats saying crazy shit all the time.\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:30.000\nAnd especially they don't have to jump in front of that virus.\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:34.000\nHe has to get right in front of that sneeze that gave him that cold.\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:38.000\nThe big question is like, when they, I remember when Obama got elected, there was a kind of\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:44.000\ndoubling up of Secret Service efforts and things, which was simultaneously like, it's\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:49.000\nkind of like, by the millennial definitions, it's like, oh, we're racist.\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:53.000\nWe're noticing he's a black president, so let's close ranks everybody.\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:59.000\nIt's like, if you drifted further into the outfield when he came up to bats.\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:04.000\nI have a friend from high school, my friend Mike Carpio, who listens to the show.\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:06.000\nHe drives a cab in New York right now.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:12.000\nHe sent a postcard jokingly saying to a friend that was going to Chicago when I think George\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:16.000\nHerbert Walker Bush was president, saying like, hey, you're going to meet Chicago.\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:19.000\nDon't shoot the president while you're there, haha.\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:20.000\nAnd a postcard.\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:25.000\nThe next morning, knock on the door, two dudes in suits, Secret Service, and they gave him\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:26.000\n100 questions.\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:30.000\nWhere are you homosexual, are you a member of the Communist Party?\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:31.000\nAnd they had the postcard.\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:34.000\nSo they haven't changed their questionnaire from 1955?\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:36.000\nNo, same question.\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:37.000\nJust boilerplate.\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:41.000\nHey, should we cut down on some of these questions?\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:45.000\nHey, what harm is there in knowing if someone's gay?\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:46.000\nRight.\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:52.000\nThat was someone at the meeting, they were like, hey, what do we want to know less?\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:55.000\nWe'll wait for them to sue us, then we'll stop asking.\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:57.000\nThe news doesn't loosen.\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:59.000\nYeah, we drove all the way to Whittier.\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:02.000\nWe're not going to not know if they're gay or not.\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:03.000\nBut I am fascinated with that.\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:10.000\nThe idea of what I was getting to is like, okay, the Secret Service, how much does it\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:14.000\nget flushed and switched over for each president?\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:25.000\nLike, they have to have a professional code that supersedes.\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:26.000\nDidn't a guy just resign?\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:29.000\nLike the head of the Secret Service just resigned, I think?\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:31.000\nIs that something I'm making up?\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:32.000\nCan't keep track.\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:33.000\nNational security, right?\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:34.000\nNo, but a different guy.\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:39.000\nI think specifically, I think the director of the Secret Service resigned for personal\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:40.000\nreasons.\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:41.000\nYeah.\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:44.000\nI feel like what I'm doing is literally called upstaging you.\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:50.000\nOh, Mike, by the way, I just got to check, if you need to hook into all your gear there,\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:51.000\nI have the DI.\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:52.000\nThat's right, I got to do the other thing.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:53.000\nThe DI box here.\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:54.000\nDo you need to hook into this?\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:55.000\nI do.\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.000\nBecause that's your lead.\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nHow's everybody doing?\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:02.000\nThat's good.\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:04.000\nReading a good comic books.\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:05.000\nCool.\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:06.000\nUpstage is backstage.\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:10.500\nNow, when you get back on the, Mike, Mike, I want to talk about all this gear you have\n\n36:10.500 --> 36:11.500\nhere.\n\n36:11.500 --> 36:12.500\nYou got loads of shit.\n\n36:12.500 --> 36:13.500\nI do.\n\n36:13.500 --> 36:14.500\nThat's why you brought a stool.\n\n36:14.500 --> 36:17.500\nThis stool is not just a power move, this is an actual functional tool.\n\n36:17.500 --> 36:20.500\nYes, it's a thing used for sitting.\n\n36:20.500 --> 36:26.600\nThe reason why upstaging is a bad thing is because you stay back and you make the other\n\n36:26.600 --> 36:31.240\nperson go like this, you're fucking them over if you hug the back wall.\n\n36:31.240 --> 36:36.200\nI learned that in a trauma club.\n\n36:36.200 --> 36:37.200\nUpstaging.\n\n36:37.200 --> 36:44.240\nAll right, so, yeah, but I don't know, I was just, okay, we don't have, that was a graceful\n\n36:44.240 --> 36:47.400\nsegue and I want to ruin it because I still want to talk about the Secret Service.\n\n36:47.400 --> 36:50.700\nI just imagine you being a Secret Service person and I'm like, okay, so then the guy\n\n36:50.700 --> 36:54.520\ncomes into the office that's like, what if your, I mean, what if your wife is Muslim?\n\n36:54.520 --> 36:59.680\nWhat if you, like, it's like, what do they do, what a Secret Service guy, we'll have\n\n36:59.680 --> 37:03.200\na Secret Service guy as a guest and we'll ask him all kinds of questions.\n\n37:03.200 --> 37:07.920\nFor her, you're welcome.\n\n37:07.920 --> 37:14.480\nOkay, let's get into the wrapping portion of our show, which should last for now until\n\n37:14.480 --> 37:17.960\n90 minutes from now.\n\n37:17.960 --> 37:20.680\nSo how do we want to do this?\n\n37:20.680 --> 37:23.000\nI got a bunch of shit that can be done.\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:25.200\nIt's just, what do we want to do?\n\n37:25.200 --> 37:28.200\nLet's just have an open source process.\n\n37:28.200 --> 37:29.520\nStart by giving me a beat.\n\n37:29.520 --> 37:36.000\nHow did you guys meet while Mike's putting this together?\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:37.400\nYou guys do what show?\n\n37:37.400 --> 37:49.160\nIt's funny, we were both, I was a rogue cop and then I had to say hello to my new partner.\n\n37:49.160 --> 37:53.680\nNow we just did this show.\n\n37:53.680 --> 37:55.680\nAre you making beats on the flat?\n\n37:55.680 --> 38:04.200\nNo, I'm just going to, I got something to say to that, but thank you for it.\n\n38:04.200 --> 38:07.120\nNow are you going to lay down some stuff that you already have written or are you going\n\n38:07.120 --> 38:09.120\nto have a freestyle for us?\n\n38:09.120 --> 38:10.120\nI don't know.\n\n38:10.120 --> 38:12.120\nWell, I don't have anything written to this.\n\n38:12.120 --> 38:14.120\nYou don't have anything written to this?\n\n38:14.120 --> 38:15.120\nNot just.\n\n38:15.120 --> 38:16.120\nI do.\n\n38:16.120 --> 38:32.120\nWell, when you rap, you rap with your heart, you do your best to do your rapping part because\n\n38:32.120 --> 38:38.240\nrap music is never going anywhere.\n\n38:38.240 --> 38:44.200\nIt's in all of the water, the fire, the wind and your hair, mislead.\n\n38:44.200 --> 38:50.000\nWell, I'm a rapping man and I'm here to sing.\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:58.600\nI want to rap about everything, but I can't, not yet till I get a harmony in my heart.\n\n38:58.600 --> 39:05.400\nI want to do my part, so I bought a gun for some reason.\n\n39:05.400 --> 39:12.240\nThe president's committing treason just by sitting in that office.\n\n39:12.240 --> 39:18.360\nI hear him cough, and I think, is he going to die?\n\n39:18.360 --> 39:25.720\nAnd then I wonder why I'd be happy for somebody to be in pain.\n\n39:25.720 --> 39:27.520\nI'm on the hate train.\n\n39:27.520 --> 39:30.080\nMy name is motherfucking MC.\n\n39:30.080 --> 39:33.440\nI'm going to put every vitamin inside of my pee.\n\n39:33.440 --> 39:39.600\nI'm going to drink it down and pee it out because that's what a recycling syndrome's\n\n39:39.600 --> 39:40.600\nabout.\n\n39:40.600 --> 39:45.880\nIf you're only drinking pee, then water is pee, and if you pee it out, it's twice as\n\n39:45.880 --> 39:47.400\nmuch pee you see.\n\n39:47.400 --> 39:54.440\nSo you got to seek effervescent freshness, you got to get back to what the quest was.\n\n39:54.440 --> 40:01.040\nYou can pee in Texas and you can pee on extras, and if you can't pee long, you should stretch\n\n40:01.040 --> 40:08.200\nit out like I do, because I got a really small bladder, so I pee longer than I have to in\n\n40:08.200 --> 40:09.200\nthe bathroom.\n\n40:09.200 --> 40:15.040\nI let people think I'm still going when I'm blowing, even though nothing is showing.\n\n40:15.040 --> 40:16.040\nFuck it.\n\n40:16.040 --> 40:17.040\nOh, shit.\n\n40:17.040 --> 40:27.920\nWell, now what do we do?\n\n40:27.920 --> 40:31.480\nThat's the danger of rapping when you're also in control of how long the beats go.\n\n40:31.480 --> 40:32.480\nYeah.\n\n40:32.480 --> 40:34.480\nIt's also the danger of rapping that early in the show.\n\n40:34.480 --> 40:37.120\nI mean, how are we going to follow that with our bullshithes?\n\n40:37.120 --> 40:39.360\nDan, you just dropped $4.\n\n40:39.360 --> 40:40.360\nI guess with cash prizes.\n\n40:40.360 --> 40:41.360\nHello.\n\n40:41.360 --> 40:50.320\nThat's like in video games when you beat someone up and they drop money.\n\n40:50.320 --> 40:55.600\nI want to hear more, just more like, you know, rapping.\n\n40:55.600 --> 40:57.520\nMore rapper.\n\n40:57.520 --> 40:59.520\nMore extemporaneous freestyle.\n\n40:59.520 --> 41:01.280\nThat was a nice beat.\n\n41:01.280 --> 41:02.280\nI had a good one.\n\n41:02.280 --> 41:03.280\nThat was good.\n\n41:03.280 --> 41:04.280\nAll right.\n\n41:04.280 --> 41:05.640\nSo these are all beats that you made up yourself?\n\n41:05.640 --> 41:12.960\nThat one was, a lot of this is other people's shit from our songs, and what should I put\n\n41:12.960 --> 41:13.960\non here?\n\n41:13.960 --> 41:16.040\nWhat should we call that last rap?\n\n41:16.040 --> 41:18.800\nWell, doing the rapping part.\n\n41:18.800 --> 41:19.800\nOh, yeah.\n\n41:19.800 --> 41:20.800\nThat hook was great.\n\n41:20.800 --> 41:21.800\nThat was great.\n\n41:21.800 --> 41:22.800\nWhat?\n\n41:22.800 --> 41:28.160\nIs there any significance to the name open mic eagle?\n\n41:28.160 --> 41:29.160\nYeah.\n\n41:29.160 --> 41:33.240\nHe sounds a little bummed out about that.\n\n41:33.240 --> 41:35.160\nI pressed the opposite of a button.\n\n41:35.160 --> 41:36.160\nYeah.\n\n41:36.160 --> 41:42.760\nI found the armchair snooze setting like a bored you to death.\n\n41:42.760 --> 41:44.640\nNo, it's not boredom.\n\n41:44.640 --> 41:48.680\nIt's just that I should have a way better answer.\n\n41:48.680 --> 41:53.160\nAnd the truth is my government name is Michael Eagle.\n\n41:53.160 --> 41:54.440\nOh, okay.\n\n41:54.440 --> 41:55.440\nThat's it.\n\n41:55.440 --> 42:02.600\nIt was fucking Mike Eagle and a rapper bunch at open mics.\n\n42:02.600 --> 42:07.120\nAnd so then I just smashed all that shit together and made a rap name.\n\n42:07.120 --> 42:09.600\nYou didn't feel like Mike Eagle wasn't cool enough?\n\n42:09.600 --> 42:10.600\nYou know what?\n\n42:10.600 --> 42:12.480\nThat's the best name in the world.\n\n42:12.480 --> 42:16.080\nIn retrospect, you're correct.\n\n42:16.080 --> 42:19.600\nIt would be the thing to do now, like if you started now, it's to the 2003 or whatever\n\n42:19.600 --> 42:20.600\nyou started.\n\n42:20.600 --> 42:21.600\nDan, I think about it every day.\n\n42:21.600 --> 42:22.600\nYeah.\n\n42:22.600 --> 42:23.600\nBut you could also.\n\n42:23.600 --> 42:26.640\nIf you call yourself Mike Eagle, people will think you made that up.\n\n42:26.640 --> 42:29.880\nWhen you say my name is open mic eagle, they go, oh, his name is Mike Eagle and he's ashamed\n\n42:29.880 --> 42:30.880\nof it.\n\n42:30.880 --> 42:31.880\nYeah.\n\n42:31.880 --> 42:33.800\nHe doesn't believe that that's enough.\n\n42:33.800 --> 42:34.800\nI didn't.\n\n42:34.800 --> 42:35.800\nI was overcompensating.\n\n42:35.800 --> 42:40.080\nIt got stuck in it forever.\n\n42:40.080 --> 42:43.560\nBut you could be like John Cougar, Mellon Camp and just drop the cougar at some point.\n\n42:43.560 --> 42:44.560\nDid he drop it?\n\n42:44.560 --> 42:46.480\nI don't know what the arc was with that shit at all.\n\n42:46.480 --> 42:50.320\nBecause he was Johnny Cougar for a while and it was John Cougar, Mellon Camp, and I think\n\n42:50.320 --> 42:52.000\nhe just went to John Mellon Camp.\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:53.000\nThat was a great decision.\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:54.000\nYeah.\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:57.920\nI'm going to draw upon his strength because the cougar was thrust upon him, but Eagle,\n\n42:57.920 --> 42:59.000\nyou were born with the Eagle.\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:00.000\nI was.\n\n43:00.000 --> 43:01.000\nYeah.\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:02.000\nYou saved your destiny.\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:03.620\nI mean, I like it.\n\n43:03.620 --> 43:06.760\nI just didn't realize it was enough.\n\n43:06.760 --> 43:07.760\nMike Eagle.\n\n43:07.760 --> 43:10.080\nI can't feel like you should you know what it is.\n\n43:10.080 --> 43:11.080\nIt's my dad's name, too.\n\n43:11.080 --> 43:12.080\nRight.\n\n43:12.080 --> 43:13.080\nSo I never thought it was fucking special.\n\n43:13.080 --> 43:17.040\nYou know Mike Eagle Junior the second or whatever the fuck.\n\n43:17.040 --> 43:18.040\nThat's fucked up.\n\n43:18.040 --> 43:19.040\nMy eagle.\n\n43:19.040 --> 43:25.560\nYou have to either be like a like film noir detective or a stripper because Mike Eagle\n\n43:25.560 --> 43:26.560\nis good.\n\n43:26.560 --> 43:27.560\nThat's a great name.\n\n43:27.560 --> 43:28.560\nI feel like I'm being too I read the Mike.\n\n43:28.560 --> 43:30.360\nMike Eagle novels.\n\n43:30.360 --> 43:30.860\nWhat?\n\n43:30.860 --> 43:34.860\nNo, I was saying, like, you could write a series of detective novels, my angle.\n\n43:34.860 --> 43:36.860\nLike Sam Spade and fucking...\n\n43:36.860 --> 43:38.360\n...Dashel Hammett.\n\n43:38.360 --> 43:41.360\nI think, I think if he were to be a detective...\n\n43:41.360 --> 43:43.860\nI think it would go something like this.\n\n43:46.360 --> 43:47.360\nPut a beat on...\n\n43:47.360 --> 43:47.860\nShit.\n\n43:47.860 --> 43:48.860\n...before you get beat on.\n\n43:48.860 --> 43:49.860\nWhoa!\n\n43:49.860 --> 43:51.360\nBeats and P, goddammit.\n\n43:52.360 --> 43:54.360\nIt's the name of this...\n\n43:54.360 --> 44:01.360\nsegment.\n\n44:01.360 --> 44:03.360\nI like this one a lot.\n\n44:03.360 --> 44:07.360\nThis takes your height, Dan.\n\n44:07.360 --> 44:11.860\nOh my god, oh my god, oh my god.\n\n44:11.860 --> 44:16.860\nJust giving it like a pit set.\n\n44:16.860 --> 44:21.360\nOh my god, oh my god, oh my god.\n\n44:21.360 --> 44:26.360\nI don't know.\n\n44:26.360 --> 44:29.360\nThis is a sample from They Might Be Giants, by the way.\n\n44:29.360 --> 44:31.360\nOh, yeah.\n\n44:31.360 --> 44:33.360\nThe last one was, too.\n\n44:45.360 --> 44:47.360\nHear me call.\n\n44:47.360 --> 44:56.360\nYeah.\n\n44:56.360 --> 44:58.360\nDan doesn't like this one.\n\n44:58.360 --> 44:59.360\nNo, I think he does.\n\n44:59.360 --> 45:00.360\nNo, I'm liking it too much.\n\n45:00.360 --> 45:01.360\nI'm sorry, I was just listening.\n\n45:01.360 --> 45:02.360\nI don't know.\n\n45:02.360 --> 45:03.360\nHere.\n\n45:03.360 --> 45:06.360\nYou put it in your sleep like a shark upside down.\n\n45:06.360 --> 45:07.360\nYup, yup.\n\n45:07.360 --> 45:08.360\nYou ever see...\n\n45:08.360 --> 45:09.360\nYou're like, it's a...\n\n45:09.360 --> 45:10.360\nHow about a gibberish?\n\n45:10.360 --> 45:12.360\nI'm talking gibberish when I...\n\n45:12.360 --> 45:14.360\nI rap this bass, I gotta talk gibberish.\n\n45:14.360 --> 45:16.360\nBecause I can't rap this fast and speak English.\n\n45:16.360 --> 45:19.360\nBecause I'm rapping too fast, doesn't speak real words.\n\n45:19.360 --> 45:21.360\nI fucked her mama like I was watching birds.\n\n45:21.360 --> 45:24.360\nTook my binoculars and saw both cities.\n\n45:24.360 --> 45:26.360\nI fucked her mama coast to coast in both cities.\n\n45:26.360 --> 45:28.360\nWent to New York, Manhattan, Staten Island.\n\n45:28.360 --> 45:32.360\nFucked her mama so hard, she turned into a guy named Ryland.\n\n45:32.360 --> 45:34.360\nPsst, psst, psst.\n\n45:34.360 --> 45:38.360\nIt's like a nephew of my girlfriend.\n\n45:38.360 --> 45:41.360\nIt's a real name.\n\n45:41.360 --> 45:42.360\nIs her name Ryland?\n\n45:42.360 --> 45:43.360\nOr Ryland?\n\n45:43.360 --> 45:45.360\nIs it Ryland with a D or Ryland?\n\n45:45.360 --> 45:47.360\nIt confuses people.\n\n45:47.360 --> 45:52.360\nChoose better names for your children.\n\n45:52.360 --> 45:56.360\nIf it's Stephanie, spell it S-G-E-P-H-A-N-I-E.\n\n45:56.360 --> 45:58.360\nThat's how we know how to spell it.\n\n45:58.360 --> 46:00.360\nIf you fuck with that, you're gonna doom your kid\n\n46:00.360 --> 46:02.360\nto a life of correcting people.\n\n46:07.360 --> 46:11.360\nBut if you name your kid WubaJub,\n\n46:11.360 --> 46:14.360\nspell it out, WubaJub.\n\n46:14.360 --> 46:16.360\nHow you want to spell it, WubaJub.\n\n46:16.360 --> 46:17.360\nYou're an inventor.\n\n46:17.360 --> 46:19.360\nYou're Thomas Edison.\n\n46:19.360 --> 46:22.360\nFucked your mama so hard, let us in to the kitchen\n\n46:22.360 --> 46:23.360\nlike a vampire.\n\n46:23.360 --> 46:26.360\nI fucked your mama till I changed your pussy's tire.\n\n46:26.360 --> 46:27.360\nI checked it up.\n\n46:27.360 --> 46:28.360\nI put it down.\n\n46:28.360 --> 46:30.360\nI changed the lug nuts and drove her ass around.\n\n46:30.360 --> 46:34.360\nI treated her with respect.\n\n46:34.360 --> 46:35.360\nThen the car wrecked.\n\n46:35.360 --> 46:38.360\nTook it back to Amos.\n\n46:38.360 --> 46:42.360\nSaid, I don't know what happened.\n\n46:42.360 --> 46:43.360\nTake it, Mike.\n\n46:43.360 --> 46:45.360\nYeah.\n\n46:45.360 --> 46:47.360\nI know what happened.\n\n46:47.360 --> 46:49.360\nThere's a lot to unpack.\n\n46:49.360 --> 46:51.360\nYes.\n\n46:51.360 --> 46:53.360\nThere's condoms in the back seats.\n\n46:53.360 --> 46:54.360\nWhy?\n\n46:54.360 --> 46:55.360\nI don't know.\n\n46:55.360 --> 46:57.360\nI had acne.\n\n46:57.360 --> 47:00.360\nHe fucked my mother like some type of athlete.\n\n47:00.360 --> 47:01.360\nOr my mom?\n\n47:01.360 --> 47:03.360\nWhy did I personalize it?\n\n47:03.360 --> 47:04.360\nI don't know.\n\n47:04.360 --> 47:05.360\nI don't have to.\n\n47:05.360 --> 47:07.360\nIt could be your mom or your mom.\n\n47:07.360 --> 47:10.360\nIt could be somebody's mom in Vietnam.\n\n47:10.360 --> 47:11.360\nAnywhere.\n\n47:11.360 --> 47:14.360\nThere's nothing stopping this man from fucking anybody's mother.\n\n47:14.360 --> 47:18.360\nAnd this is the truth I have finally discovered right now.\n\n47:18.360 --> 47:20.360\nBut he fucked all of our mothers.\n\n47:20.360 --> 47:23.360\nSo that means all of us are sisters and brothers.\n\n47:23.360 --> 47:26.360\nHe is a man of many lovers.\n\n47:26.360 --> 47:29.360\nAs he has said, as he repeated.\n\n47:29.360 --> 47:33.360\nAnd as he said, he excreted all over nasty back seats.\n\n47:33.360 --> 47:36.360\nAnd then he returned the car like nothing happened.\n\n47:36.360 --> 47:39.360\nAnd it was full of used prophylactics.\n\n47:39.360 --> 47:41.360\nI'm like, dude, that's disgusting.\n\n47:41.360 --> 47:44.360\nLook at the semen you've erupted.\n\n47:44.360 --> 47:46.360\nIt's like all over the upholstery.\n\n47:46.360 --> 47:49.360\nWhat is this supposed to be?\n\n47:49.360 --> 47:54.360\nAnd he still had to pay full price plus the cleaning fee.\n\n47:54.360 --> 48:00.360\nBecause the people were like, we're not cleaning semen or cleaning pee.\n\n48:00.360 --> 48:04.360\nBecause it's all about his liquids.\n\n48:04.360 --> 48:05.360\nBecause I'm ubiquitous.\n\n48:05.360 --> 48:06.360\nYes.\n\n48:06.360 --> 48:07.360\nWith my liquidus.\n\n48:07.360 --> 48:08.360\nYes.\n\n48:08.360 --> 48:10.360\nThis administrativeness.\n\n48:10.360 --> 48:14.360\nFrom the oval oftenness of this coughiness.\n\n48:14.360 --> 48:16.360\nI want to put it in a sarcophagus.\n\n48:16.360 --> 48:17.360\nI got the pillars.\n\n48:17.360 --> 48:18.360\nI got the house.\n\n48:18.360 --> 48:20.360\nI want to creep in there like a tiny mouse.\n\n48:20.360 --> 48:23.360\nI got superpowers going to shrink my ass down.\n\n48:23.360 --> 48:25.360\nGoing to go to the oval office and go to ground round.\n\n48:25.360 --> 48:28.360\nIt's a restaurant chain in the Midwest.\n\n48:32.360 --> 48:35.360\nAnd in the Midwest we kick fresh.\n\n48:35.360 --> 48:38.360\nNow I'm fucking with incest, they're small like insects.\n\n48:38.360 --> 48:40.360\nHide them like witsack, witness.\n\n48:40.360 --> 48:43.360\nProtection, that's how we do it.\n\n48:43.360 --> 48:45.360\nStrangled in here or any section.\n\n48:45.360 --> 48:47.360\nBeen like the midsection.\n\n48:47.360 --> 48:51.360\nMaybe torso, fingers getting their head like horn rolls for twisting.\n\n48:51.360 --> 48:54.360\nJust watch how we blow like ballistic missiles.\n\n48:54.360 --> 48:57.360\nCause the shit's wild, not an exile.\n\n48:57.360 --> 48:59.360\nPut flows together like textiles.\n\n48:59.360 --> 49:01.360\nSmile for miles, never stopping.\n\n49:01.360 --> 49:05.360\nI'm tech copper with the news and prime time, a light shine.\n\n49:05.360 --> 49:07.360\nThey don't want to stand for the tenth time.\n\n49:07.360 --> 49:10.360\nBreak it down like enzymes when I get within rhymes.\n\n49:10.360 --> 49:12.360\nThere's no space to be left between.\n\n49:12.360 --> 49:16.360\nCome back, have them dancing like bimberine and they system.\n\n49:16.360 --> 49:19.360\nGot them hook addicted, nicotine, they a small victory.\n\n49:19.360 --> 49:21.360\nI'm coming through pretty big pigs.\n\n49:21.360 --> 49:23.360\nWant to get shut down when I clown.\n\n49:23.360 --> 49:26.360\nAnd they don't understand this is that new smackdown.\n\n49:26.360 --> 49:28.360\nReferee doing fast counts, one, two, three.\n\n49:28.360 --> 49:31.360\nThey can't move me, MCs, they think I'm in the food cheese.\n\n49:31.360 --> 49:34.360\nBut I'm watching, show them double features in the movie.\n\n49:34.360 --> 49:37.360\nBut it's all this, it's all that we are fat.\n\n49:37.360 --> 49:40.360\nThe hitter with the ball bat, it's fall star.\n\n49:40.360 --> 49:42.360\nThey wall march, they generic, we just declare it.\n\n49:42.360 --> 49:47.360\nWe stare at them, they get embarrassed when we share this freestyle.\n\n49:47.360 --> 49:52.360\nHow the fuck do you do that, baby?\n\n49:52.360 --> 49:54.360\nI don't know how I do that.\n\n49:54.360 --> 50:00.360\nHow the fuck, how the fuck, how the fuck do you do that?\n\n50:00.360 --> 50:03.360\nI don't know how I do that.\n\n50:03.360 --> 50:09.360\nDo you eat something special when you grow enough?\n\n50:09.360 --> 50:20.360\nIs there a tree in your backyard that grows a special fruit?\n\n50:20.360 --> 50:30.360\nDid you win an eBay auction that gave you a special lamp that you rubbed?\n\n50:30.360 --> 50:34.360\nLike a wrapping genie.\n\n50:34.360 --> 50:39.360\nOh, what a meanie.\n\n50:39.360 --> 50:41.360\nI'm Kevin Meaney, who passed away.\n\n50:41.360 --> 50:43.360\nHe did pass away.\n\n50:43.360 --> 50:46.360\nI rap on a Saturday or Sunday.\n\n50:46.360 --> 50:48.360\nI move the crowd like funk sway.\n\n50:48.360 --> 50:50.360\nWhen people rig a major furniture.\n\n50:50.360 --> 50:52.360\nYeah, I rap, but it's earlier.\n\n50:52.360 --> 50:54.360\nI will miss you earlier.\n\n50:54.360 --> 50:56.360\nThat means I'll look through your window.\n\n50:56.360 --> 50:58.360\nI'll make you sick and large your fucking lymph nodes.\n\n50:58.360 --> 51:00.360\nLike I was cancerous.\n\n51:00.360 --> 51:03.360\nMCs want to get pressed up like beats on a master disk.\n\n51:03.360 --> 51:06.360\nNext to their name, like Barry Bonds for the asterisks.\n\n51:06.360 --> 51:08.360\nAfter he hits the home run, I am the show gun.\n\n51:08.360 --> 51:11.360\nThere's no one I kill on my Africans with a blow gun.\n\n51:11.360 --> 51:14.360\nWhen they're trying to do what they do, cause they're predators.\n\n51:14.360 --> 51:18.360\nOpen cuts your words up like a newspaper editor with op-ed.\n\n51:18.360 --> 51:21.360\nI'm not drop dead Fred that old school movie from the 80s.\n\n51:21.360 --> 51:25.360\nMCs will try to slay me, but they can't do nothing cause they feel smart as a baby.\n\n51:25.360 --> 51:28.360\nBut yeah, they got babies and they think they sick.\n\n51:28.360 --> 51:31.360\nThey want to come through with new shit, but they just miss how we do it.\n\n51:31.360 --> 51:33.360\nHello.\n\n51:33.360 --> 51:35.360\nYeah.\n\n51:35.360 --> 51:37.360\nYeah.\n\n51:37.360 --> 51:39.360\nYeah.\n\n51:39.360 --> 51:41.360\nJesus Christ.\n\n51:41.360 --> 51:44.360\nSecond you are, cause you ran upholstery with supposed to be.\n\n51:44.360 --> 51:47.360\nThat made me very happy.\n\n51:47.360 --> 51:50.360\nIncredible.\n\n51:50.360 --> 51:52.360\nFuck it.\n\n51:52.360 --> 51:54.360\nOh, Vincent Price breakdown.\n\n51:54.360 --> 51:56.360\nRight.\n\n51:56.360 --> 52:00.360\nLike me doing the Vincent Price bridge.\n\n52:00.360 --> 52:03.360\nYes.\n\n52:03.360 --> 52:10.360\nYou're upholstery is scintillating creepy.\n\n52:10.360 --> 52:16.360\nThe seat coverings are smotherings from the spider's delight.\n\n52:16.360 --> 52:19.360\nOh shit. Ice-tease here too.\n\n52:19.360 --> 52:21.360\nYo, they ain't personal.\n\n52:21.360 --> 52:23.360\nIt's just business.\n\n52:23.360 --> 52:24.360\nWant to fuck your mother?\n\n52:24.360 --> 52:26.360\nWhat is this?\n\n52:26.360 --> 52:28.360\nI want to see your pussy to her mouth.\n\n52:28.360 --> 52:31.360\nI fucked your mother from the north to the south.\n\n52:31.360 --> 52:32.360\nIt ain't personal.\n\n52:32.360 --> 52:34.360\nIt's just me.\n\n52:34.360 --> 52:36.360\nI put a bullet in my pee.\n\n52:36.360 --> 52:39.360\nI peed out the bullet like a gun.\n\n52:39.360 --> 52:42.360\nYou telling me this motherfucker's done?\n\n52:42.360 --> 52:43.360\nUh-uh.\n\n52:43.360 --> 52:47.360\nIce-tea to the I to the C to the E and every T and it rhymes.\n\n52:47.360 --> 52:49.360\nEverything rhymes with T.\n\n52:49.360 --> 52:50.360\nThat's all me.\n\n52:50.360 --> 52:52.360\nIce-tea.\n\n52:52.360 --> 52:53.360\nYeah.\n\n52:53.360 --> 52:54.360\nYo, I gotta go.\n\n52:54.360 --> 52:56.360\nI'm gonna get an ice cream.\n\n52:56.360 --> 52:59.360\nDon't confuse that with what my name means.\n\n52:59.360 --> 53:02.360\nMy name comes from the streets.\n\n53:02.360 --> 53:05.360\nYo, my sore feet.\n\n53:05.360 --> 53:07.360\nThey get sore when I walk.\n\n53:07.360 --> 53:10.360\nI fucked your mama.\n\n53:10.360 --> 53:11.360\nOh shit.\n\n53:11.360 --> 53:15.360\nJimmy Stewart's here too.\n\n53:15.360 --> 53:25.360\nI saw your mama was outside.\n\n53:25.360 --> 53:32.360\nWell, obviously I need a B.\n\n53:32.360 --> 53:34.360\nOh yeah.\n\n53:34.360 --> 53:38.360\nThat was kind of a smooth one.\n\n53:38.360 --> 53:41.360\nWe can take a break and talk about you again.\n\n53:41.360 --> 53:42.360\nOkay.\n\n53:42.360 --> 53:45.360\nNow that there's heightened interest in you.\n\n53:45.360 --> 53:46.360\nIs there?\n\n53:46.360 --> 53:47.360\nIs that what happened?\n\n53:47.360 --> 53:52.360\nI saw some skills and things.\n\n53:52.360 --> 53:56.360\nSo now we're at the point in your life you're being raised by your grandparents.\n\n53:56.360 --> 53:57.360\nOh shit.\n\n53:57.360 --> 53:58.360\nOkay.\n\n53:58.360 --> 54:01.360\nI forgot that we were talking about the past.\n\n54:01.360 --> 54:04.360\nThere's a point, so where are you?\n\n54:04.360 --> 54:07.360\nYou're not like a six year old on the playground that's into hip hop, are you?\n\n54:07.360 --> 54:10.360\nNo, I was into, I mean this is the thing.\n\n54:10.360 --> 54:13.360\nWhere I grew up and when I grew up rap was just there.\n\n54:13.360 --> 54:15.360\nRap was there.\n\n54:15.360 --> 54:19.360\nMy older sister, my first rap I heard, I got in my mom's car.\n\n54:19.360 --> 54:21.360\nShe was playing fucking Easy Ease first album.\n\n54:21.360 --> 54:23.360\nIt was fucking 1987.\n\n54:23.360 --> 54:24.360\nOh yeah.\n\n54:24.360 --> 54:25.360\nYou know what I mean?\n\n54:25.360 --> 54:27.360\nThe suspense was making me sick.\n\n54:27.360 --> 54:29.360\nSo I opened it up and the bitch had a dick.\n\n54:29.360 --> 54:32.360\nMy mom's car when I was six.\n\n54:32.360 --> 54:35.360\nAnd I was like, oh my god, all these curse words, this is fucking great.\n\n54:35.360 --> 54:38.360\nBut that was just what was all around me.\n\n54:38.360 --> 54:43.360\nSo I never, I mean at least at that point in my life I wasn't like, oh god, rap is awesome\n\n54:43.360 --> 54:44.360\nbecause it was just life.\n\n54:44.360 --> 54:50.360\nAnd so I actually escaped into rock music and shit that I was seeing on MTV.\n\n54:50.360 --> 54:52.360\nDid you associate rap at that age?\n\n54:52.360 --> 54:56.360\nYou were kind of like, this is, like almost maybe what I associated Country Western with\n\n54:56.360 --> 54:58.360\nis like, this is my parents' music, this is grown up shit.\n\n54:58.360 --> 55:01.360\nThis is like, so did you reject it?\n\n55:01.360 --> 55:04.360\nIt wasn't so much that I rejected it.\n\n55:04.360 --> 55:08.360\nIt was just like the soundtrack of my surroundings.\n\n55:08.360 --> 55:11.360\nWhat was the first record or a rap group that you got into?\n\n55:11.360 --> 55:14.360\nWas that your own discovery or your own shit?\n\n55:14.360 --> 55:15.360\nTrapcore Quest.\n\n55:15.360 --> 55:16.360\nOh yeah.\n\n55:16.360 --> 55:17.360\nSo all of that shit.\n\n55:17.360 --> 55:21.360\nLike all of the Day Last Soul, Trapcore Quest, the brand newbie.\n\n55:21.360 --> 55:23.360\nI was really bummed out when Fife died.\n\n55:23.360 --> 55:24.360\nYeah man.\n\n55:24.360 --> 55:27.360\nI didn't realize until I read an article at Day Last Soul because I was always like,\n\n55:27.360 --> 55:29.360\nwhy wasn't Day Last Soul's fire?\n\n55:29.360 --> 55:31.360\nWhy didn't it burn everything down?\n\n55:31.360 --> 55:35.360\nAnd it was like, there was sampling legislation that happened\n\n55:35.360 --> 55:37.360\nthat I had no idea had anything to do with it.\n\n55:37.360 --> 55:38.360\nYeah.\n\n55:38.360 --> 55:40.360\nThat a lot of their sound was like very, very...\n\n55:40.360 --> 55:45.360\nAnd they were part of the original lawsuits that changed Hip Hop forever.\n\n55:45.360 --> 55:46.360\nYeah.\n\n55:46.360 --> 55:50.360\nLike they were sampling like the turtles and just interludes and shit.\n\n55:50.360 --> 55:58.360\nBut there were no standing laws or no history for how you go about punishing that.\n\n55:58.360 --> 56:03.360\nAnd so the copyright law for Hip Hop started with them and started with Bismarck E.\n\n56:03.360 --> 56:08.360\nAnd then it became like illegal to the point where these,\n\n56:08.360 --> 56:12.360\nthe record labels and the guys who owned those masters could sue for the amount of money\n\n56:12.360 --> 56:14.360\nthat would just kill a whole project.\n\n56:14.360 --> 56:15.360\nIt could kill a whole label.\n\n56:15.360 --> 56:18.360\nIt could put everybody in a bankruptcy and it changed Hip Hop forever.\n\n56:18.360 --> 56:20.360\nThat's why Hip Hop can't sound like it used to.\n\n56:20.360 --> 56:24.360\nLike the records that I grew up loving are all illegal right now.\n\n56:24.360 --> 56:26.360\nYou can't make any of those.\n\n56:26.360 --> 56:29.360\nDo you think that when we go to music in general,\n\n56:29.360 --> 56:32.360\neven if maybe our grandparents went to Elvis for the same reason,\n\n56:32.360 --> 56:34.360\nor Little Richard or whatever, like,\n\n56:34.360 --> 56:37.360\nare we going to music when we're in the mood to fuck or fight\n\n56:37.360 --> 56:43.360\nand that's why conscientious music, like a message in your music,\n\n56:43.360 --> 56:47.360\nlike it's gonna never like win that stock market battle where it's like,\n\n56:47.360 --> 56:50.360\nhey, over here I got, I'm selling Arrested Development.\n\n56:50.360 --> 56:55.360\nLike in the 90s I was like, it seems so much harder\n\n56:55.360 --> 57:00.360\nand so much more worthwhile to try to rise above the equally charismatic stuff\n\n57:00.360 --> 57:02.360\nlike that easy, easy thing you're talking about.\n\n57:02.360 --> 57:05.360\nI remember the white guys in the locker room,\n\n57:05.360 --> 57:09.360\njust like everyone knew it by syllable.\n\n57:09.360 --> 57:12.360\nLike everyone had it memorized and it had infected everybody,\n\n57:12.360 --> 57:15.360\nI guess because it was just for the same reason that,\n\n57:15.360 --> 57:19.360\nwho knows, like what, I'm doing the twist or whatever the fuck,\n\n57:19.360 --> 57:22.360\nlike it's always been, it's the same as rock and roll.\n\n57:22.360 --> 57:24.360\nIt's like, oh, they're talking about fucking them,\n\n57:24.360 --> 57:28.360\nthey're talking about anger, they're talking about something my parents don't like\n\n57:28.360 --> 57:33.360\nand this is finally authentic and it's been too inauthentic and now it's authentic,\n\n57:33.360 --> 57:37.360\nbut the problem is that that authenticity never goes hand in hand with like,\n\n57:37.360 --> 57:39.360\nis this a question, Dan, is what you're wondering?\n\n57:39.360 --> 57:42.360\nNo, no, no, I think it makes perfect sense.\n\n57:42.360 --> 57:47.360\nThe authenticity doesn't go hand in hand with like, oh, here's an idea.\n\n57:47.360 --> 57:51.360\nAuthenticity tends to go hand in hand with, I want to smash someone in the face,\n\n57:51.360 --> 57:54.360\nI shot someone today, I'm horny.\n\n57:54.360 --> 57:59.360\nI mean, you know, what it is with hip hop and I don't know if this speaks to other genres.\n\n57:59.360 --> 58:02.360\nI think it is with rock and roll too, but it sticks out more with hip hop.\n\n58:02.360 --> 58:05.360\nI know that when I grew up, when hip hop was starting,\n\n58:05.360 --> 58:11.360\nthere were hella options in terms of the type of content you could get in a popular rap song even.\n\n58:11.360 --> 58:13.360\nNot upstaging of getting drunk.\n\n58:13.360 --> 58:18.360\nIt's all good. You could have NWA and you could have public enemy\n\n58:18.360 --> 58:21.360\nand all of that was able to exist in the same space.\n\n58:21.360 --> 58:26.360\nWhat I think happened with rap music is that ultimately,\n\n58:26.360 --> 58:32.360\nthe rap music that aligns more with like our overarching cultural values,\n\n58:32.360 --> 58:37.360\nit becomes easier for that to spread than things that are talking about going against that.\n\n58:37.360 --> 58:43.360\nDo you think part of it is because if guys are rapping about being poor\n\n58:43.360 --> 58:48.360\nand how they'll always be poor and how being poor makes them angry\n\n58:48.360 --> 58:56.360\nand how the kind of lower class lifestyle being maybe not necessarily applauded\n\n58:56.360 --> 59:02.360\nby the protagonist in the music, but certainly being coped with, being celebrated,\n\n59:02.360 --> 59:10.360\ndo you think that maybe part of it is because that's easy to digest for everybody,\n\n59:10.360 --> 59:17.360\nincluding people who can stay racist and like good music?\n\n59:17.360 --> 59:20.360\nRight, but what I'm saying specifically about rap music,\n\n59:20.360 --> 59:24.360\nbecause if you look at Dr. Dre's The Chronic album,\n\n59:24.360 --> 59:28.360\nand that album changed like everything because it was one of the first times\n\n59:28.360 --> 59:36.360\nthat a high profile rap release was overtly about like fucking and money\n\n59:36.360 --> 59:39.360\nand like you said, shit that people could identify with,\n\n59:39.360 --> 59:44.360\nno matter if they liked or identified with the people making it or not,\n\n59:44.360 --> 59:49.360\nthey could identify with those values, like those are cultural values overall.\n\n59:49.360 --> 59:53.360\nAnd I feel like once people are able to dial into that,\n\n59:53.360 --> 59:58.360\nthen that shows the mode of hip-hop that was able to become more dominant.\n\n59:58.360 --> 01:00:01.360\nThere's two different areas here,\n\n01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:05.360\nbecause it's like the thing that I always hear over and over,\n\n01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:09.360\nbut that historical era of hip-hop was like, oh, the white people flooded in,\n\n01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:16.360\nlike the suburban white kids that don't, it's not identifiable, but it's still charismatic.\n\n01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:21.360\nThe music was good because I was a suburban, I still am a suburban white kid,\n\n01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:29.360\nlike EPMD, Eric B and Rock Him, NWA, Too Short, like all the West Coast stuff,\n\n01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:33.360\nwe all listened to it because the music was good, like the quality was really good,\n\n01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:38.360\nthe production values were really good, and their records were actual albums,\n\n01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:43.360\nlike the whole record said something, it wasn't just a bunch of bullshit,\n\n01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.360\nand Rock and Roll wasn't doing it then, like Rock and Roll had kind of gone away.\n\n01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:55.360\nSo we rejoined Open Mike Eagle's biopic, you're hearing Tribe Called Quest the first time,\n\n01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:03.360\nand we're still, as far as I know, because I want to hear the point where you actually are seduced by hip-hop.\n\n01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:09.360\nOkay, that's high school for me, because I first identified with Tribe Called Quest beneath the apple bum,\n\n01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:17.360\nand I'm seeing images of people, of black people who are cool, but they're not like,\n\n01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:22.360\nI'm trying to be hard cool, they're like, it's okay for me to be unique,\n\n01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:26.360\nit's okay for me to rock these weird, afrocentric, baggy, and I wasn't able to do that either,\n\n01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:33.360\nbut I saw self-confident people who weren't trying to portray the hardest image,\n\n01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:38.360\nand to me that created a space like, oh wait a minute, there's room for me in this culture too,\n\n01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:41.360\nbecause I wasn't reflecting those other values either.\n\n01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:47.360\nSo that was the first thing, and in Chicago, on the south side in high school,\n\n01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:56.360\nthere was this place called Promontory Point, it was this park district where they had this city-sanctioned breakdancing class.\n\n01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:04.360\nBut what the hip-hop community in this city used as this meeting point for people who were into all of the hip-hop arts,\n\n01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:08.360\npeople who were doing graffiti, people who were freestyle rapping, people who were breakdancing,\n\n01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:13.360\npeople who were DJing, they all got together at this place every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon,\n\n01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:19.360\nand that just flicked something in my head, like oh wait a minute, this is not just some shit to listen to,\n\n01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:23.360\nit's some shit you can actually do, and taking that layer of distance away from it,\n\n01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:26.360\nand making it something that I had an entry or access point into.\n\n01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:34.360\nSo maybe intellectualizing it, maybe, but not that that sounds punitive to you, but that's how I experience emotion.\n\n01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:42.360\nI need to logically realize that it's the right thing to do, that it makes sense to do it,\n\n01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:48.360\nthat it's strategically, that it doesn't compromise me, that it doesn't take anything away from me,\n\n01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:50.360\nthat it's a proper way for me to...\n\n01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:59.360\nI was like, oh, hugging my girlfriend is a way to maintain that, I'm just wondering maybe if you're a verbal thinker,\n\n01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:05.360\nif you're a logical thinker, you grow up in that atmosphere and you're like, then in that moment you're like, wait a minute,\n\n01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:11.360\nand if I could speculate going like, because something that I had to, like back then I remember going like,\n\n01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:19.360\nsomebody had to tell me or I read it somewhere, they were like, oh, don't you understand that going like this with a record in the 80s,\n\n01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:26.360\nis like the only recourse we've provided kids that used to get tuba lessons,\n\n01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:34.360\nand that all of the sampling and everything, beatboxing, rapping itself, everything, all of it is,\n\n01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:40.360\nit's an expression of, it's like banging on pipes underneath the fucking subterranean,\n\n01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:45.360\nnot underneath the subterranean thing, don't let me do this.\n\n01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:53.360\nAnd then I was like, oh shit, I had to have a logical, I kind of have to parse it in sci-fi terms myself,\n\n01:03:53.360 --> 01:04:00.360\nI'm always like, oh wait, okay, this is the robots and these are the people and this is how we fight and this is what we do,\n\n01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:06.360\nand maybe that happened to you kind of in that moment where you're like, wait a minute, what do all these things have in common,\n\n01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:09.360\nthey're unsanctioned, they're not...\n\n01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:15.360\nWhat was the threshold for you, Mike, when you listened to stuff, you got turned on by that music and then you started saying,\n\n01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:19.360\nokay, now I have to go get equipment and start making it myself, like how old were you?\n\n01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:29.360\nI started rapping just as 16, right, and I was seeing people rap at that place, freestyle, they were getting in circles and freestyle rhyming,\n\n01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:33.360\nand so like me and my friends in high school decided we were going to do that,\n\n01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:38.360\nand so from like the age of 16 to like 24, all the rap I ever did was freestyle.\n\n01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:40.360\nSo that's why you're better, I started at 42.\n\n01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:43.360\nWell then yeah, 10,000 hours, you know what I mean?\n\n01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:47.360\nThat's not true, Dan, you've been doing it since you were 20 and you've been bad at it the whole time.\n\n01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:51.360\nI started taking it seriously last week, okay?\n\n01:04:51.360 --> 01:05:00.360\nWait, Mike, can you give Dan some pointers because tell him to stop saying the word mouth because he knows he's just going to have to say south after that.\n\n01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:04.360\nBut there's a certain pitfalls that you fall into every time.\n\n01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.360\nDo you rap a lot for real?\n\n01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:08.360\nIn the show, yeah I do.\n\n01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:17.360\nAnd truly in the show, because it started as a gimmick in the show, the idea was I rap badly only by virtue of doing the show every week for years,\n\n01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:20.360\nI'm getting a little bit better, don't tell anyone I said that.\n\n01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.360\nNo, you're not terrible.\n\n01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:24.360\nIt's just practicing, it's like light training.\n\n01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:25.360\nAnd that's all it is.\n\n01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.360\nYou have your moments, Dan.\n\n01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:30.360\nOnce in a while, Dan will lay down a really good rhyme.\n\n01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:37.360\nWell, that's the thing that fascinates me about rap because unlike piano lessons, which I regret ever bailing on and stuff,\n\n01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:51.360\nbut here's this thing where there's people who labor, the relationship between freestyle and writing raps is just really fascinating to me.\n\n01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:54.360\nIt deep core fracks the fascination.\n\n01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:57.360\nI'm not drunk, I'm just making up new words like Shakespeare.\n\n01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:00.360\nAlso it's 9-11.\n\n01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.360\nDon't let that alarm you.\n\n01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:03.360\nIt was a little scary.\n\n01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.360\nIt was a little scary.\n\n01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.360\nWere they uninitiated?\n\n01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.360\nLet me remind you that it's a little scary.\n\n01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.360\nJust so you know, our fans are crazy people.\n\n01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:11.360\nThey're crazy.\n\n01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:15.360\nWell, here's the thing you did just before you launched into what we were doing it before.\n\n01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:23.360\nI was babbling and I was doing bits and then it was literally, I watched you,\n\n01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:30.360\nlike I said like sassafras and then you were like, I'm going to start rapping.\n\n01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:31.360\nI saw that on your face.\n\n01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:38.360\nAnd then I, because I was just like, and by sassafras I mean pineapple and you're like pineapple, apple, babble.\n\n01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:48.360\nBut like you could have gotten away with, in your head you had the option of going with sassafras as a point of departure,\n\n01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:53.360\nbut you were committed to a last dragon like flow.\n\n01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.360\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\n\n01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.360\nI mean, that's all it is.\n\n01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:02.360\nYou know, it's just making connections, you know, but in real time that's all it is.\n\n01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:05.360\nAnd the enemy is starting to think?\n\n01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:08.360\nNo, the enemy is stopping.\n\n01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:10.360\nThat's the only enemy is stopping.\n\n01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.360\nYou just keep going.\n\n01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.360\nJust like when me and my friends first started,\n\n01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:14.360\nBut I didn't hear you.\n\n01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:15.360\nWe were all fucking horrible.\n\n01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:20.360\nAnd what we used to do, we would get on the phone and call each other old school three way, right?\n\n01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:21.360\nWith no beat.\n\n01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.360\nAnd we would just start rapping.\n\n01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:24.360\nWe were fucking awful.\n\n01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:28.360\nAnd our whole thing was just don't fucking stop.\n\n01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:32.360\nAnd then like, what you started to do after a while is built that catalog of words.\n\n01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:37.360\nSo then it's not mouth and south, it's about and trout and grout and gout and all of that.\n\n01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.360\nThe rhymes don't have to be actual complete rhymes.\n\n01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.360\nThere could be sounds.\n\n01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.360\nYou're just riffing on sounds.\n\n01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.360\nYou don't even have to rhyme.\n\n01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.360\nYou just got to keep going.\n\n01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:50.360\nSome of the best lyrics in music history, there are no rhymes.\n\n01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:54.360\nThere's a song called Moonlight in Vermont, which is a beautiful lyric and there's no rhyme in it.\n\n01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:56.360\nAnd you don't notice that.\n\n01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.360\nIt's just a great, it's a beautiful lyric.\n\n01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:00.360\nIt's a poem.\n\n01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.360\nSomebody requested.\n\n01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:05.360\nI can't sing it, we're getting sued.\n\n01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:09.360\nI was in, I did this study with the National Institutes of Health.\n\n01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.360\nI freestyle in an MRI machine.\n\n01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:12.360\nWhat?\n\n01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:13.360\nYeah, I did.\n\n01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:18.360\nAnd like, and they, and I'm a co-author on a fucking National Institute of Health study about it.\n\n01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:19.360\nWait, that's right.\n\n01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:20.360\nImprovisation or freestyling.\n\n01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:23.360\nYou got an MRI while you were freestyling?\n\n01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.360\nYeah, no, like, they bloated me in the machine.\n\n01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:26.360\nCan I make a guess?\n\n01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:27.360\nI'll probably be wrong.\n\n01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:33.360\nBut I would guess because words appear as, for me, they're visual.\n\n01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:38.360\nDoes the same part of like facial recognition, like spatial recognition come up?\n\n01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:41.360\nLike what part of your brain lit up in the MRI?\n\n01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:43.360\nWell, they said, okay, so they've been studying this.\n\n01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:47.360\nBecause they started with studying like improvisational pianists in there.\n\n01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:50.360\nSo they had this little keyboard you can put in there.\n\n01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:57.360\nSo like, they're trying to figure out the brain parts that are active when people reach what's called the flow state.\n\n01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:59.360\nAnd that's any improvisation.\n\n01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:00.360\nThis is not about lead with this.\n\n01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:03.360\nNo, I mean, that's not, go, go, keep going, keep going.\n\n01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:12.360\nBut it's, and so what they say is like language turns on, but like forethought, like the normal frontal lobe thought turns off.\n\n01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:19.360\nAnd you start thinking with like more reptilian brain, because you don't, you like, because you can't overthink it, like you said.\n\n01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:21.360\nBut you're still using language.\n\n01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:28.360\nIt's like your reptile brain is shooting lightning through the forebrain, but the forebrain's being used as a fucking silencer and a pistol or any other tool.\n\n01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:37.360\nIt's like, it's like, it's turned like, man, unfortunately, the results were filled with jargon that I didn't understand at all.\n\n01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:42.360\nOn your part, you mean in your raps, but you're like, I'm in an MRI and I got a dick in my eye.\n\n01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:45.360\nHow did you not rap about being in the MRI machine?\n\n01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:47.360\nIt leads for the first 10 minutes.\n\n01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.360\nIt's hard to rhyme.\n\n01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:50.360\nI'm gonna do a little oblongata, you know.\n\n01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:53.360\nI feel my optic nerve heating up.\n\n01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:56.360\nI feel my frontal lobe cooling down.\n\n01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:58.360\nAll right.\n\n01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.360\nAnd you're like, I'm trying too hard.\n\n01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:00.360\nPull me out, pull me out.\n\n01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:05.360\nAll right, no, but what part of the brain is active when you're in the flow state?\n\n01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:06.360\nLike, that's the thing.\n\n01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:08.360\nIt's a combination of lobes.\n\n01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:16.360\nAnd I'll have to like, I'd have to like send you the shit because like the front part turns off in a couple of this like parietal temporal turn.\n\n01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:19.360\nLike it's, it's, it was a complicated thing that they were showing happens.\n\n01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:29.360\nThey put like chess players, like chess masters under CAT scans or MRIs and the, they showed them images of chess boards.\n\n01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:36.360\nLike of a game, like in like middle game or end game or early game, like, like openings or something like that.\n\n01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:42.360\nAnd the same part of their brain lit up that is the same part of your brain that lights up when you see a face that you recognize.\n\n01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:43.360\nAnd you go, oh, that's Dan Harmon.\n\n01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:44.360\nOh, that's Mike.\n\n01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:45.360\nOh, that's Spencer.\n\n01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:48.360\nThey see chess boards as people.\n\n01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:51.360\nSo we should all be spending a lot more time in MRI machines.\n\n01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:53.360\nLike, like, like this technology is important.\n\n01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:59.360\nLike we should all just be spending like six hours a day in MRI machines and pooling the results.\n\n01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:02.360\nThey get a lot of money to put shit in MRI machines and see what happens.\n\n01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:13.360\nLike Dan, you were saying that you got better, like you've been getting better at being in the flow state wrapping over time because you can actually rewire those synapses to create new flow.\n\n01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.360\nWell, that's what I think is interesting.\n\n01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:19.360\nLike, well, because remember this, the Ken Keezy metaphor that you told me about?\n\n01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:23.360\nLike, you ever read Electric Kool-Aid Asset Test?\n\n01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:32.360\nKen Keezy, he had this metaphor that for being in the moment, which was like, which is the same thing you're talking about this flow state.\n\n01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:40.360\nHis metaphor was that you walk up to a player piano with the role going and that you, of course, if you didn't know how to play piano, you'd be like,\n\n01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:45.360\nyou could try to play this weird game where you tried to like imitate the keys.\n\n01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:48.360\nAnd this is also in Westworld's title sequence.\n\n01:11:48.360 --> 01:12:01.360\nBut that you, that Ken Keezy had this like concept of if you take enough acid or if you get enough in the moment.\n\n01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:02.360\nYour fingers fall into those.\n\n01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:09.360\nYour fingers will start to get so fast because what's stopping you is thinking about observing the keys and blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:19.360\nAnd then, but then the further philosophical concept was that you could get into that state so much that you could finish the song\n\n01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:26.360\nand then look up and see that the player role didn't have the end of the song on it, that you had known the song itself.\n\n01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:27.360\nSo it's the same thing.\n\n01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:30.360\nAnd Olympic athletes say essentially the same thing.\n\n01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:35.360\nLike, because people want to know for very good reasons how the fuck did you jump that high?\n\n01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:39.360\nI mean, but isn't it similar with writing, too, though, because like I'm like,\n\n01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:40.360\nI'd like to think so.\n\n01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:47.360\nRight. Most people can't, most people can't like consciously remember like the mind state they were in when they wrote their best shit or had their best ideas.\n\n01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:51.360\nLike kind of you just, you're in the moment so much that you kind of separate from it.\n\n01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:54.360\nEven when I have an amazing show like this one, I'm in a total blackout.\n\n01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:55.360\nI don't know what's going on.\n\n01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:58.360\nI'll find out later that we won a podcastie.\n\n01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:11.360\nNo, but yeah, and that's what's interesting to note is that it practicing shit so often has to do with actually you have to learn some shit,\n\n01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:16.360\nbut then it's like you got to unlearn thinking about it.\n\n01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:21.360\nThey say that like learning a craft like learning piano.\n\n01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:26.360\nIf there's genius inside you, the craft will liberate the genius.\n\n01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:32.360\nSo working on something like working on rhyming, working on music, working on writing,\n\n01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:41.360\nthe hard work that it takes will liberate the genius inside you that was always there.\n\n01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.360\nCan we try an exercise?\n\n01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:44.360\nLet's just go back and forth like dueling banjo style.\n\n01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:45.360\nOkay.\n\n01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:47.360\nYou can just like you're teaching me to drive.\n\n01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:50.360\nYou just do a little bit like what's the definite?\n\n01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:52.360\nWhat's a good like short attention span?\n\n01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:57.360\nYou do like a couple of do a little bit and then I'll do a little bit and then you do a little bit.\n\n01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:01.360\nAre we going to beat or are we going acapella?\n\n01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.360\nOh, should we go acapella?\n\n01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.360\nI mean, we can just, you know.\n\n01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:08.360\nI put a real simple beat on.\n\n01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:11.360\nI got one of them, but yours are going to be better, I'm sure.\n\n01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.360\nYou got what you got?\n\n01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:16.360\nWell, as Harry Foster, he gave us some beats.\n\n01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:18.360\nYou want to try one of his?\n\n01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:21.360\nYeah, then we'd have to switch the deal.\n\n01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:26.360\nYou do yours because you get, you have your finger on the knob a little better than over there.\n\n01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:36.360\nRed leather, yellow leather, hip hop to the hippity hop.\n\n01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:38.360\nDan, can I give you some improv advice?\n\n01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:41.360\nOverthink it.\n\n01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:42.360\nThat's so good.\n\n01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:45.360\nHave you just came up with that right now?\n\n01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:48.360\nLook, look, look, Mike, he's already, he's already freaking out.\n\n01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:49.360\nTell us this.\n\n01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:53.360\nNo, I'm loosening it, look at me, I'm like the air.\n\n01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:59.360\nI am the sun, I'm the air.\n\n01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.360\nShit, I don't know what I got.\n\n01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:07.360\nYo, I'm not even saying yo because I'm not thinking about it.\n\n01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:09.360\nI like this one.\n\n01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:16.360\nWell, well, well, water, ocean, waves, sky, fuck your mama, came in her eye.\n\n01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:20.360\nOkay, see, now why does it always have to be fucking somebody's mama?\n\n01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.360\nI don't know because I think about that because it's edible.\n\n01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:30.360\nOkay, but look, but look, but look, but look, I'll stop you right there because you're doing something in a lot of freestyle raffer zoo.\n\n01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.360\nThank you.\n\n01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.360\nIt's called having a crutch.\n\n01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:33.360\nOh.\n\n01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:42.360\nBut like, but like, no, no, no, that's not, that wasn't meant to deflate.\n\n01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:47.360\nLike mine used to be when I first started, mine used to be when I'm on the mic, right?\n\n01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:48.360\nI love that.\n\n01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.360\nIt'd be like, my name is Mike Eagle.\n\n01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:52.360\nWhen up on the mic, I say hi to people.\n\n01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:53.360\nLike, you know what I mean?\n\n01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:57.360\nLike, every fucking bar was that.\n\n01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:00.360\nBut that's some people doing yours happens to be fucking your mama.\n\n01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:02.360\nSecond verse, same as the first.\n\n01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:03.360\nA little bit louder.\n\n01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.360\nWell, my name's Chef Daniels and I'm here to say.\n\n01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:08.360\nAll right, well, so how do you deal with crutches?\n\n01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.360\nDid you take a hacksaw to them?\n\n01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:12.360\nYeah, you become conscious of them and you just try not to.\n\n01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:17.360\nBut it's there for a reason because we do that to help us get, help us fill the time\n\n01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:21.360\nbetween what we said and where we have to get to.\n\n01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:27.360\nSo, so like my therapist would say, she would say, when she takes me through meditation,\n\n01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:31.360\nshe says a thousand times your mind will wander a thousand times.\n\n01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:32.360\nIt can come back.\n\n01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:33.360\nBring it back.\n\n01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:38.360\nSo if I say fucked your mama, you guys don't start like booing and throwing chairs.\n\n01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.360\nIt's it's my mind.\n\n01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:45.360\nI got back into the old habit, but and you know it and you become increasingly aware of the crutch.\n\n01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:49.360\nBecause what you'll do, you'll just find other ways to get to where you have to get with the timing\n\n01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:52.360\nand you just won't say that particular thing every time.\n\n01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.360\nAll right.\n\n01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:55.360\nBy the year 2017.\n\n01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.360\nIt's now.\n\n01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:01.360\nI'm not going to fuck anyone's mama in a rap.\n\n01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:08.360\nOh, rapping.\n\n01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:11.360\nOh, rapping.\n\n01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.360\nIt's that easy, people.\n\n01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.360\nIt's that easy.\n\n01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:17.360\nSalt, pepper, fork, spoon.\n\n01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.360\nOh, son of the moon.\n\n01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:22.360\nI got a solar system that's going round and round.\n\n01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:25.360\nI got my voice in my brain and the brain is the sound.\n\n01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:26.360\nI got to flow through the rap.\n\n01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:27.360\nI got to flow through the people.\n\n01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:33.360\nHere's the motherfucking church and I don't go to the steeple because I go to the altar and I pray to God.\n\n01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:36.360\nI drop down to my knees and I let him through my body.\n\n01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:45.360\nI want to get down with you to the break of dawn.\n\n01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.360\nGo, Mike.\n\n01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:47.360\nGo, Mike.\n\n01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:53.360\nHey, he didn't fuck one mother in that at all.\n\n01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:56.360\nNo mother's reflection in the course of that rap.\n\n01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:57.360\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:00.360\nNo mother's who's fucked and no uppercuts.\n\n01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:03.360\nMake bread like the company butternut with the squash.\n\n01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:05.360\nHow we do it when we wash them seeds?\n\n01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:08.360\nThey think they old when they come through getting washed.\n\n01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:10.360\nYeah, got to stop and take it back.\n\n01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:13.360\nThat's how we do it because the flow's never whacked.\n\n01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.360\nBut how we do it, that's another crush.\n\n01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:18.360\nAnd you can go back to that one and try not to say it so much.\n\n01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.360\nYeah.\n\n01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:21.360\nYeah, not so much.\n\n01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:23.360\nYou don't do much and you don't do such.\n\n01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:26.360\nIf you don't do
