00:00.000 --> 00:18.880
Hello, one and all. Welcome to NerdMelt Theatre at Meltdown Commons in Hollywood, California.

00:18.880 --> 00:36.880
Harmontown is now in session. Won't you please join me in welcoming to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:36.880 --> 00:49.880
Thank you. So much to do because we took a week off last week and thank you all for coming. I know you had so many comic books to go through because you were all at Comic-Con.

00:49.880 --> 01:00.880
That's why we all go there now for the comic books, right? It's not Sundance or anything. It's a comic book convention.

01:00.880 --> 01:17.880
I mean, we could talk about Comic-Con, we could talk about my upper-end desk copy, which I survived and had a budistic existential experience during, because I got it rough.

01:17.880 --> 01:33.880
Boy, what a surgical procedure I went through. But we could talk about all that, but the truth is it's 8.10 and our first guest has to 10-bar downtown at 8.30. He's got to leave.

01:33.880 --> 01:45.880
I want you to welcome one of our wonderful feral audio podcast brothers, a pioneer of the podcasting medium, in fact. I think he was doing it before everyone had a podcast.

01:45.880 --> 01:48.880
Jeff, you're a Studs Turkle fan, aren't you?

01:48.880 --> 01:51.880
Totally.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.880
I really thought you would be. You're like an artist.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.880
I know very little about Studs.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.880
I'm a fan of his name more than anything.

01:58.880 --> 02:07.880
Well, this guy in some respects is kind of the anti-Dan Harmon because he has very meaningful conversations in good interviews with very interesting people.

02:07.880 --> 02:19.880
And all I do is do bad interviews with people from feral audio. Please welcome Matt Dwyer.

02:19.880 --> 02:25.880
If you want to drink, I could have someone make you one.

02:25.880 --> 02:30.880
Oh, no. I don't want to work yet. So just if somebody else could bartend for me right now.

02:30.880 --> 02:32.880
Your podcast is called Conversations with Matt Dwyer.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.880
Yeah, very narcissistic of me.

02:34.880 --> 02:38.880
I'm proud to be a label mate of yours because I listened to a little bit of it today.

02:38.880 --> 02:46.880
You're one of those guys that I kind of, I guess I wish I was like, but I know I never could be.

02:46.880 --> 02:49.880
I don't even want to be like Matt.

02:49.880 --> 02:51.880
You're a listener and not a talker.

02:51.880 --> 03:00.880
I mean, you're somebody that actually is, as our friend Seek Donnelly who came out here, who's an aneurysm survivor and therefore a shamanic representative.

03:00.880 --> 03:06.880
I said, what do we have to do, those of us in the land of certainty?

03:06.880 --> 03:08.880
And he said, give more than you take.

03:08.880 --> 03:14.880
And I think guys like you give a little more than you take because you book really provocative guests and have really interesting conversations.

03:14.880 --> 03:19.880
And all I do is stand up here and go, I had an endoscopy.

03:19.880 --> 03:24.880
Yeah, well, when I started the show, I was hoping I would be really funny while talking to interesting people.

03:24.880 --> 03:31.880
But when you're talking to like a Black Panther or Wayne Kramer talking about his prison stint, it's really hard to make jokes.

03:31.880 --> 03:37.880
So you don't have to because that Black Panther dude, for instance, I was riveted.

03:37.880 --> 03:45.880
I had to do, I'm trying to write the first episode of Community right now, but I got you cranked up like I'm Terry Gross doing my research.

03:45.880 --> 03:49.880
I didn't want to embarrass myself. You're an adult coming in.

03:49.880 --> 03:51.880
I didn't want to be like, so what's your podcast about?

03:51.880 --> 03:53.880
I wanted to know.

03:53.880 --> 03:55.880
Stan, what is his podcast about?

03:55.880 --> 03:57.880
It's about this Black Panther guy.

03:57.880 --> 04:01.880
362 episodes with one Black Panther guy.

04:01.880 --> 04:06.880
We go each crime to each food because they did a lot of soup kitchen stuff.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.880
We talk about each soup extensively.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.880
What was that guy's name? Pat O'Neill?

04:11.880 --> 04:12.880
Pito Neill.

04:12.880 --> 04:13.880
Pito Neill.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.880
Yeah, he was a little less Irish than...

04:15.880 --> 04:18.880
Really weird, though. He does have a broke.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.880
Black Panther from Kansas City with a broke.

04:20.880 --> 04:21.880
Why?

04:21.880 --> 04:25.880
Why can't we get over this class system that's oppressing the African-American?

04:25.880 --> 04:29.880
We've got to fight the power to be...

04:29.880 --> 04:31.880
Power to the people, motherfuckers.

04:31.880 --> 04:35.880
Someone's trying to take me horseshoe-shaped civil rights.

04:35.880 --> 04:39.880
Very funny. Three white guys doing this.

04:39.880 --> 04:43.880
But one thing that he said that...

04:43.880 --> 04:47.880
He said something so, well, I don't know if it was profound or if it was just sort of like narcissistic.

04:47.880 --> 04:51.880
I'm like, that's what I'm always saying in a Black Panther saying it.

04:51.880 --> 04:55.880
Because he said...

04:55.880 --> 04:57.880
By the way, just a quick backstory.

04:57.880 --> 05:01.880
This guy was basically trumped up charges sometime in the 60s and has been in Tanzania ever since.

05:01.880 --> 05:05.880
Yeah, but before he became a Black Panther, he was like a street hood.

05:05.880 --> 05:09.880
He was a pimp, I believe, which he doesn't even like to talk about.

05:09.880 --> 05:11.880
And then the Black Panthers changed his life.

05:11.880 --> 05:19.880
His charges were trumped up, but he does admit that he did smuggle some guns in his time.

05:19.880 --> 05:21.880
So he had done some pretty crazy things.

05:21.880 --> 05:25.880
And he talks about how the Black Panthers...

05:25.880 --> 05:29.880
The thing that he said that really perked my ears up was when he was talking about how...

05:29.880 --> 05:35.880
The first thing they tried to do to neutralize the Black Panthers propaganda-wise was to call them a racist organization.

05:35.880 --> 05:41.880
And he said, racist organization, all we were preaching from the beginning was about class systems.

05:41.880 --> 05:43.880
And I was like, yes, this is exactly what I'm talking about.

05:43.880 --> 05:45.880
Race is an artificial construct.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.880
I'm always saying...

05:47.880 --> 05:49.880
You don't have to read a fucking book to figure this out.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.880
You do not have to...

05:51.880 --> 05:55.880
I mean, it's great if smart people do smart work to try to figure this out, but it's right under everyone's nose.

05:55.880 --> 05:57.880
Children do not...

05:57.880 --> 05:59.880
Children don't understand what race is.

05:59.880 --> 06:01.880
You get taught this stuff.

06:01.880 --> 06:03.880
This is about poor people and rich people.

06:03.880 --> 06:05.880
Race is a Black organization.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.880
Your primary thrust is going to be on what the Black community can do.

06:07.880 --> 06:13.880
As you would expect poor white people to have a primary thrust maybe on what poor white people could do.

06:13.880 --> 06:15.880
I'm putting words in his mouth at this point.

06:15.880 --> 06:19.880
And then he said, we should all eat more bacon?

06:19.880 --> 06:21.880
Now I'm just trying to get back on Akins.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.880
Black Panthers said it.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.880
But it's always about class.

06:25.880 --> 06:27.880
It's always been about class.

06:27.880 --> 06:33.880
It was so interesting that he could have the calm state of mind having been basically exiled to Tanzania,

06:33.880 --> 06:39.880
where he's running an orphanage, that he was so cool and objective about the global state of affairs.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.880
Yeah, but he didn't...

06:41.880 --> 06:45.880
We've talked besides the podcast too, and he said it took him a long time to get there.

06:45.880 --> 06:51.880
Because I guess there was times in Tanzania where he'd like chase some dudes down the street with a knife and stuff.

06:51.880 --> 06:55.880
He used to be a little temperamental, but now he's like 77.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.880
He's getting a little tuckered out.

06:57.880 --> 07:01.880
Yeah, but he's still like this big, strong motherfucker.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.880
You wouldn't want to screw with him even at 77.

07:03.880 --> 07:05.880
He's a badass.

07:05.880 --> 07:11.880
You also, on that list of your legitimate interviewings, before we get to the thing that I think I really want to plug,

07:11.880 --> 07:13.880
because it drops I think Monday.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.880
Are we dropping it Monday?

07:15.880 --> 07:17.880
Can you give it?

07:17.880 --> 07:19.880
But that Monsanto guy, that was another big one.

07:19.880 --> 07:23.880
A lot of Monsanto fans here tonight.

07:23.880 --> 07:27.880
I didn't know if that was going to be somebody booing Monsanto.

07:27.880 --> 07:31.880
No, they love bioengineered fruit.

07:31.880 --> 07:35.880
This is Los Angeles, nothing grows here unless it's part giraffe.

07:35.880 --> 07:37.880
It's more comic books sounding to have bioengineered fruit.

07:37.880 --> 07:39.880
Yeah, these guys are nerds. They love sci-fi.

07:39.880 --> 07:43.880
Of course they want their oranges to glow in the dark.

07:43.880 --> 07:47.880
But you had this guy, he wasn't specifically a Monsanto employee.

07:47.880 --> 07:53.880
He worked for the main research company that worked for Monsanto.

07:53.880 --> 07:59.880
It sounds kind of bullshitty when you're like, he couldn't say his name because it sounds like you're just being weird,

07:59.880 --> 08:03.880
but he couldn't because they'd come after him and if you've ever seen any documentaries,

08:03.880 --> 08:05.880
Monsanto likes to fuck people in the ass.

08:05.880 --> 08:11.880
And he couldn't, you know, he would get sued to high fucking heaven.

08:11.880 --> 08:15.880
But the greatest thing about that interview is there's a really poignant moment he and I were having

08:15.880 --> 08:19.880
and he couldn't see this, but behind him, his dog was taking a shit.

08:19.880 --> 08:25.880
And it was like one of the, and the dog was just chasing its own stringy shit behind him.

08:25.880 --> 08:29.880
And I was like, why don't I videotape this show?

08:29.880 --> 08:31.880
Why don't you blow the whistle on that?

08:31.880 --> 08:37.880
Talking about Agent Orange and the glow in the dark pineapples.

08:37.880 --> 08:43.880
What do you do when you, like, were you invested at all in that topic,

08:43.880 --> 08:51.880
that area of politics before you found out you were going to get to sit down with a Monsanto whistleblower?

08:51.880 --> 08:56.880
I mean, I'm pretty fucking way to the left.

08:56.880 --> 08:59.880
Like, I might make Chomsky look conservative.

08:59.880 --> 09:03.880
But yeah, I'm always interested in political things.

09:03.880 --> 09:07.880
I mean, when I started doing the show, I was hoping to just talk to anybody because I feel like most people have

09:07.880 --> 09:14.880
interesting stories, but then I'm a weirdo, so I started going after, like, you know, Black Panthers and political radicals.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.880
But how do you go after them?

09:16.880 --> 09:21.880
Well, the Black Panther explained how you go after them in the 60s.

09:21.880 --> 09:27.880
It's amazing who you can find on Facebook.

09:27.880 --> 09:33.880
I found Pete on Facebook, and yeah, I just, and then you start, once you start talking to a bunch of weirdos,

09:33.880 --> 09:37.880
these weirdos go, hey, I got some more weirdos you can talk to.

09:37.880 --> 09:41.880
And a guy I've interviewed twice, Shane Bugby, and I grew up together.

09:41.880 --> 09:46.880
And Shane in high school was, like, publishing G.G. Allen, John Wayne Gacy.

09:46.880 --> 09:51.880
It was like, fresh out of high school, he was Gacy's art dealer.

09:51.880 --> 09:57.880
Like an art dealer, like a guy who dealt art to John Wayne Gacy.

09:57.880 --> 10:02.880
By the way, nobody booed. Monsanto got a boo.

10:02.880 --> 10:06.880
What has Monsanto done for any birthday party?

10:06.880 --> 10:08.880
True.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.880
But Shane has worked with this.

10:14.880 --> 10:19.880
Does someone say Joe Rogan's joke? Or is that some weird mental projection?

10:19.880 --> 10:20.880
I think so.

10:20.880 --> 10:23.880
I thought I heard the words, Joe Rogan's joke?

10:23.880 --> 10:26.880
Jim Gavigan's joke? That's all.

10:26.880 --> 10:28.880
I'm not a stand-up.

10:28.880 --> 10:32.880
I'm sorry if my John Wayne Gacy joke was on someone else's set list.

10:32.880 --> 10:34.880
Anyways, please continue.

10:34.880 --> 10:38.880
Oh, just Shane is, and you should listen to his episodes and Google Shane Bugby,

10:38.880 --> 10:42.880
because he's a guy who's done incredibly crazy things.

10:42.880 --> 10:48.880
And, like, G.G. Allen, he stole Ed Gein's tombstone and toured it around the country.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.880
And then he started his own soda pop company.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.880
He's just some guy who does weird things like that.

10:54.880 --> 10:57.880
But he's hooked me up with a lot of these people, like Paul Krasner.

10:57.880 --> 11:00.880
He hooked me up with Paul Krasner, if you don't know who Paul Krasner is.

11:00.880 --> 11:04.880
Oh, Paul Krasner.

11:04.880 --> 11:10.880
Paul Krasner created The Realist, which was like this really heavy-duty satirical magazine in the 60s.

11:10.880 --> 11:15.880
And the greatest thing about Paul Krasner is he tripped on acid with Groucho Marx.

11:15.880 --> 11:17.880
And he tells the story on my show.

11:17.880 --> 11:22.880
So he really saw Time Fly Like an Arrow and Fruit Fly Like a Banana.

11:22.880 --> 11:25.880
That actually happened.

11:25.880 --> 11:29.880
And Shane's the one who hooked me up with Lucy and Graves.

11:29.880 --> 11:32.880
Lucy and Graves. That's the next thing to talk to you about.

11:32.880 --> 11:36.880
Okay, so you can take over any time you want.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.880
I just want to see if I can get this right.

11:38.880 --> 11:40.880
Is it Woodsboro? Is that the name of this?

11:40.880 --> 11:42.880
The Westboro Baptist Church.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.880
Those are the God Hates Fags people.

11:44.880 --> 11:46.880
God Hates Fags.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.880
Joe Rogan Strip.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.880
Westboro Baptist.

11:50.880 --> 11:55.880
They are more easily known as the God Hates Fags people. They hold a sign that says God Hates Fags

11:55.880 --> 11:58.880
anywhere where they think anyone will be watching.

11:58.880 --> 12:06.880
Like, for instance, as they threatened, they were going to do it at the funeral for the Boston Marathon victims.

12:06.880 --> 12:12.880
They implied, I guess, it was implied that they were going to, yep, we're going to do it there too.

12:12.880 --> 12:14.880
We do it everywhere where the heat is.

12:14.880 --> 12:21.880
Because when a message is that important, you've got to get your billboard up at the corner of Fountain in Wilshire.

12:21.880 --> 12:27.880
So the head of their church, Phelps.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.880
Fred Phelps.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.880
He has a dead grandmother.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.880
I think it was his mother.

12:33.880 --> 12:37.880
So this organization called the Satanic Temple.

12:37.880 --> 12:38.880
Yeah.

12:38.880 --> 12:43.880
They did what they called a pink mass on the grave of his grandmother.

12:43.880 --> 12:47.880
Getting her gay in the afterlife.

12:47.880 --> 12:51.880
They did a Satanic gay ritual.

12:51.880 --> 12:56.880
So Fred Phelps' mom is getting hit with a strap-on as we speak.

12:56.880 --> 12:59.880
And it really blows your mind. I went down a rabbit hole today.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.880
I was like, okay, who are these Satanist guys?

13:01.880 --> 13:04.880
And I mean, I went to their site.

13:04.880 --> 13:10.880
I mean, their name is the setup and the punchline is the fact that they're good people.

13:10.880 --> 13:16.880
I mean, as far as their tenets go, they have nine tenets on their front page of their site.

13:16.880 --> 13:21.880
Follow your compassion. Be good to other humans.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.880
Never push your beliefs on anyone else.

13:23.880 --> 13:25.880
Let people do whatever they want.

13:25.880 --> 13:26.880
Always keep an open mind.

13:26.880 --> 13:30.880
Nothing to do with Satan or eating a chicken heart or anything.

13:30.880 --> 13:33.880
Yeah, they don't do anything. That's the weird misconception.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.880
And we talk about the misconceptions of Satanism.

13:36.880 --> 13:44.880
And we also talk about how this pink mass, which the media treated as something that's been going on for hundreds of years.

13:44.880 --> 13:48.880
I should be clear because I'm a bad interviewer.

13:48.880 --> 13:53.880
This drops on Monday on your podcast, Conversations with Matt Dwyer.

13:53.880 --> 13:58.880
You got to have a conversation with Lucian Greaves, the head of the Satanic temple.

13:58.880 --> 14:05.880
And I rarely get to brag about anything in my life, but he turned down a bunch of people, including Maren, to do my show.

14:05.880 --> 14:08.880
So that's...

14:08.880 --> 14:13.880
Take that, Marc Maron, and all your money.

14:13.880 --> 14:19.880
Marc Maron, can you book us on your show?

14:19.880 --> 14:23.880
And there is going to be, because there is something, and I wish I could say what it is, but I can't.

14:23.880 --> 14:32.880
There's going to be a big twist in this whole Lucian Greaves thing, which Shane Bubby, who I talked about, is going to bust on...

14:32.880 --> 14:39.880
Bust? Is going to break in Vice Magazine, and then I'm going to do a follow-up interview with Lucian as well.

14:39.880 --> 14:43.880
Wow, it's like NBC's StarCross Thursdays back in the old days.

14:43.880 --> 14:51.880
Matt Damon is going to be in Central Perk, but then also Daphne is going to be on MASH, I don't know.

14:51.880 --> 14:54.880
I haven't watched TV in a long time.

14:54.880 --> 14:57.880
It's good that New Media is getting there, too.

14:57.880 --> 15:00.880
So how did that interview go? What's he like? What's his fellow like?

15:00.880 --> 15:03.880
He's like the nicest guy in the world, and he's super smart.

15:03.880 --> 15:12.880
It's not surprising. On its face, it seems like a very juvenile, like, fuck you thing to do, to do anything on someone's grave.

15:12.880 --> 15:17.880
But then you peel back the layers, and you peel back the layers, and you're going like...

15:17.880 --> 15:28.880
I actually cut and pasted a comment from an argument about it on Facebook that I thought justified the existence of comment sections,

15:28.880 --> 15:34.880
because it's like somebody said about this, because he did this pink mass on the grave of a dead woman,

15:34.880 --> 15:38.880
making this guy's loved one gay in the afterlife.

15:38.880 --> 15:45.880
But these are the people who, I mean, their whole belief system is about freedom of religion.

15:45.880 --> 15:54.880
Not to put too fine a point on it, they hide behind the concept of freedom of religion in order to do something that is not really religious,

15:54.880 --> 16:01.880
and it's certainly unconstitutional, which is to imply that other people don't have the freedom to do whatever the fuck they want.

16:01.880 --> 16:09.880
And so this is sort of like, turnabout is fair play, and it's kind of funny to have two chicks make out on this lady's grave,

16:09.880 --> 16:18.880
and I'll say, I'd like to go where the sense of humor seems to be, but somebody said, in a comment section,

16:18.880 --> 16:25.880
of course, someone said, two wrongs don't make a right, okay, that's the response to what he did.

16:25.880 --> 16:31.880
And then this fella, Corey Hammond, I'll name him, I don't care.

16:31.880 --> 16:36.880
He said, and overused cliche statements don't make you intelligent.

16:36.880 --> 16:39.880
The Westboro Baptist Church has always been lawful.

16:39.880 --> 16:46.880
Half of his kids are First Amendment lawyers, and go to court daily to fight their actions, and they always win.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.880
The best way to beat them is at their own game, and this is it.

16:49.880 --> 16:54.880
If you aren't explicit enough to do it, the WBC is, so be explicit enough.

16:54.880 --> 17:01.880
In other words, I don't know, then you go, okay, so we're just getting in a knife fight with people who love knives, and where's that going to go?

17:01.880 --> 17:10.880
But it's certainly, you know, it makes you go like, yeah, these guys are calling themselves Satanists and making themselves heroes,

17:10.880 --> 17:13.880
and it's kind of a wonderful, ticklish thing.

17:13.880 --> 17:19.880
And he's got prosecutors coming after him, and there was a great quote at the end of an article about him recently where he said,

17:19.880 --> 17:26.880
if I go to prison, I'm going to use my powers of Satan to turn it into one big gay orgy.

17:26.880 --> 17:31.880
Talk about light work. I mean, that is not a tough road to hoe.

17:31.880 --> 17:34.880
You're halfway home already.

17:34.880 --> 17:46.880
So, I don't know, how does a guy like me be a guy like you? Do you read more than me? Are you just more interested in other people than yourself?

17:46.880 --> 17:49.880
Do you drink more, drink less?

17:49.880 --> 17:57.880
Oh, no, I drink often during my interviews. Maybe that's not the key, but I just realized early on,

17:57.880 --> 18:06.880
because I probably, in some of my first interviews, I'm trying to be like Johnny Gleb, like, whack-a-woo! And then I was just like, this isn't about you.

18:06.880 --> 18:12.880
Like, I just quickly realized, it's like, these people are, I'm talking to people who are far more intelligent than I'll ever be,

18:12.880 --> 18:17.880
and far more fucking interesting, so shut the fuck up and learn something.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.880
I can't break that barrier! How do you get there?

18:19.880 --> 18:21.880
Well, you're smarter than me, so maybe that's different.

18:21.880 --> 18:23.880
Yeah, that's not true.

18:23.880 --> 18:28.880
But it's like, I interviewed this guy, Dan Kovallak, who sued Coca-Cola for paramil-

18:28.880 --> 18:30.880
My name's Dan!

18:34.880 --> 18:36.880
That's all I thought! Well, you said that.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.880
Please continue.

18:38.880 --> 18:43.880
Oh, no, he's a lawyer who sued Coca-Cola for death squads in-

18:43.880 --> 18:53.880
Doug Stan, Hope's Joke! Coca-Cola was killing union organizers in Columbia, and he found a loophole in our government, or our laws, to sue Coke.

18:53.880 --> 18:59.880
And it's like, there's a documentary about it, actually, and we don't talk about it much, but like, I'm like, what am I going to fucking joke around,

18:59.880 --> 19:01.880
or I'll talk this guy about it?

19:01.880 --> 19:02.880
It's like, this guy's a super-

19:02.880 --> 19:08.880
But how do you ask, what do you ask? I mean, how do you, you have to engage them and get them to the places where you want them to say stuff,

19:08.880 --> 19:14.880
so you have to know all kinds of stuff, and then, I'm such a bad interviewer, it's the running joke.

19:14.880 --> 19:21.880
Yeah, I mean, I guess maybe part of it is I came from an improv background, because I don't have a lot of notes,

19:21.880 --> 19:27.880
when I have maybe five things written down, and I'll just, if something, usually somebody will say something that piques my interest,

19:27.880 --> 19:32.880
and I'll wait for them to finish, and hopefully I can just be like, how about that?

19:32.880 --> 19:34.880
Do you take notes while they're talking?

19:34.880 --> 19:36.880
Mental notes.

19:36.880 --> 19:42.880
Like, I interviewed this guy just a couple of days ago, who's an amazing artist, Rod Lough, or Rodrigo Lough,

19:42.880 --> 19:47.880
but look up his work, but he said something about how sometimes he'll create something, and he'll find it embarrassing,

19:47.880 --> 19:53.880
and then he talked for a bit, and then I was like, alright, why would somebody be embarrassed about, like, this brilliant artist,

19:53.880 --> 19:55.880
who's actually here, by the way.

19:55.880 --> 20:03.880
Why would this guy, who's incredibly brilliant, be embarrassed by something he creates,

20:03.880 --> 20:08.880
and so I wanted to, and comes down to, we're all just fucking insecure and weird.

20:08.880 --> 20:14.880
Yeah, we're all ashamed of ourselves, deep down, and I'm sorry, I've been through several PR experiences lately,

20:14.880 --> 20:22.880
where I've suddenly realized, okay, we're all ashamed of ourselves, and from now on, instead of trying to get everyone to like me,

20:22.880 --> 20:29.880
because I'm ashamed of myself, I'm only going to care about the people who don't make their shame other people's problems.

20:29.880 --> 20:34.880
Like, I think that I'm just going to bother to say that there's shitty people in the world.

20:34.880 --> 20:40.880
I'm not going to keep preaching this thing, where I'm like, I love everybody, fuck half of the people.

20:40.880 --> 20:45.880
Specifically the half of the people that make their very human shame someone else's problem,

20:45.880 --> 20:52.880
someone that says like, I'm ashamed of myself, so shut up over there, stop talking, don't say that, everybody be quiet, everybody be careful,

20:52.880 --> 20:58.880
because I have to be, because I have some weird fucking thing about me, or I don't know how to talk,

20:58.880 --> 21:05.880
like fuck those people. I'm sure they're not evil, but you got to have an enemy, I guess, according to them.

21:05.880 --> 21:06.880
Yeah.

21:06.880 --> 21:07.880
I mean, it's...

21:07.880 --> 21:08.880
John DeLewis' joke!

21:08.880 --> 21:15.880
It's interesting, because I can safely say I've spoken with some people who are legitimately creative geniuses,

21:15.880 --> 21:16.880
and they all have...

21:16.880 --> 21:17.880
Thank you.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.880
I was just about comma Dan Harmon.

21:21.880 --> 21:27.880
But yeah, none of them really fully go, yeah, I got this.

21:27.880 --> 21:30.880
Yeah, I mean, well, yeah, you can't...

21:30.880 --> 21:31.880
You can't, I think.

21:31.880 --> 21:34.880
Not unhelp people, not be effective at all.

21:34.880 --> 21:35.880
Yeah.

21:35.880 --> 21:42.880
Like you have to be fucking terrified in order to be someone effective, I would think.

21:42.880 --> 21:43.880
Otherwise, what do you...

21:43.880 --> 21:45.880
Yeah, you'd be some weirdo.

21:45.880 --> 21:46.880
You have to have a little...

21:46.880 --> 21:53.880
I don't know if this is the Irish working class bullshit in me, but I think you can't really be good at anything unless you kind of hate yourself just a little.

21:53.880 --> 21:54.880
Yeah.

21:54.880 --> 21:59.880
I mean, that's what I love about myself, is how much I hate myself.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.880
I hate how much I love you.

22:01.880 --> 22:06.880
All right, you're a better interviewer than me. Ask me something provocative, and...

22:06.880 --> 22:09.880
See what dad did just there?

22:09.880 --> 22:16.880
He created a construct where he would have someone ask things about him.

22:16.880 --> 22:19.880
I'm looking for a closer. I'm not going to generate it, because I'm not him.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.880
Yeah, but you could have had him interview somebody in the audience.

22:21.880 --> 22:23.880
Oh, okay, good idea, Jeff.

22:23.880 --> 22:26.880
Very smart. Jeff Sober tonight, he's on a cleanse.

22:31.880 --> 22:33.880
I've been sober for like the last ten shows.

22:33.880 --> 22:39.880
I ate four steaks today.

22:39.880 --> 22:43.880
Hey, N.T., will you have a conversation with Matt Dwyer?

22:43.880 --> 22:49.880
This is N.T.

22:49.880 --> 22:51.880
Oh, shit balls.

22:51.880 --> 22:54.880
I only had a little bit of vodka, and I'm falling off the goddamn chair.

22:54.880 --> 23:00.880
N.T. is irregular here, but okay, just dive in.

23:00.880 --> 23:04.880
I don't, without knowing anything about what you do, what do you do?

23:04.880 --> 23:08.880
Right fucking getting deep.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.880
I mean, are you a creative sort or what?

23:10.880 --> 23:17.880
Well, yeah, I want to do writing and stuff, but I recently was let go of a job that I had.

23:17.880 --> 23:19.880
What was the job?

23:19.880 --> 23:21.880
Black Panther.

23:21.880 --> 23:24.880
He was an Irish Black Panther.

23:24.880 --> 23:27.880
Trumped up charges.

23:27.880 --> 23:33.880
I worked like in social media, and I did like movie marketing stuff.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.880
That's just called tweeting that you liked Iron Man 3.

23:36.880 --> 23:40.880
That's not, that never paid anything.

23:40.880 --> 23:45.880
So are you taking that as like, alright, I can fuck this, I'm just going to dedicate my life to writing?

23:45.880 --> 23:48.880
Oh, no, I wanted to do writing before that.

23:48.880 --> 23:52.880
No, I know, but taking the job is like losing your job is maybe like a sign of...

23:52.880 --> 23:55.880
Yeah, like maybe it was time that it needed to happen.

23:55.880 --> 24:00.880
Because I kind of wasn't happy there, so I was like, okay.

24:00.880 --> 24:03.880
See, Dan, you guys, I'm going to hit pause instead of you.

24:03.880 --> 24:06.880
You're not watching because you're making yourself another cocktail over there.

24:06.880 --> 24:11.880
But I've just noticed a trick, a little trick that you can employ when you interview people.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.880
He's looking right at him.

24:13.880 --> 24:17.880
It's very uncomfortable for people with my condition.

24:17.880 --> 24:21.880
Okay, sorry, play.

24:21.880 --> 24:24.880
What kind of writing are you going to do?

24:24.880 --> 24:26.880
Screenwriting.

24:26.880 --> 24:29.880
She just said sitcom writing.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.880
Well, I actually...

24:31.880 --> 24:34.880
He's doing the long con.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.880
It's going to take a couple years.

24:36.880 --> 24:42.880
And he's better than Anatoly who came up a couple weeks ago and was like, hire me as a director, I'm from Russia.

24:42.880 --> 24:46.880
Oh, okay, Anatoly's here.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.880
Hello Anatoly, good to see you.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.880
And Anatoly was at Comic-Con.

24:50.880 --> 24:53.880
Anyways, sorry, derailed your interview.

24:53.880 --> 24:56.880
No, I thought you just said thank you, it was nice seeing you.

24:56.880 --> 24:58.880
I thought you ended it.

24:58.880 --> 24:59.880
Oh, because you have to go?

24:59.880 --> 25:01.880
No, because it was a big laugh.

25:01.880 --> 25:02.880
I know, I know.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.880
Alright, Matt Dwyer.

25:04.880 --> 25:07.880
He's got to go to work.

25:07.880 --> 25:09.880
Let him go to work.

25:09.880 --> 25:10.880
Thank you, sir.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.880
Matt Dwyer, good to see you, Matt.

25:12.880 --> 25:14.880
Hello, hello.

25:14.880 --> 25:15.880
Thank you, Enti.

25:15.880 --> 25:16.880
Thank you, Enti.

25:16.880 --> 25:21.880
So that episode that we were talking about, he interviews, he sits down with Lucy in Greaves,

25:21.880 --> 25:26.880
the Satanic Temple, I'm probably butchering this, about this pink mass thing that took

25:26.880 --> 25:27.880
place on this grave.

25:27.880 --> 25:30.880
It's bound to be a pretty interesting interview.

25:30.880 --> 25:34.880
But I've not listened to his podcast, I've known Matt for a few years, not very well,

25:34.880 --> 25:41.880
but doing Acid with Groucho and gay post-mortem grannies, this is good stuff.

25:41.880 --> 25:42.880
Yeah, I like it.

25:42.880 --> 25:45.880
Yeah, he's a better person than me, why don't you marry him?

25:45.880 --> 25:46.880
Alright.

25:46.880 --> 25:52.880
So, we should, oh, well, Feral Audio, Jeff, you know the Matt Dwyer's part of the Feral

25:52.880 --> 25:53.880
Audio network.

25:53.880 --> 25:54.880
I say, what?

25:54.880 --> 25:55.880
Yeah.

25:55.880 --> 25:58.880
Did you know that there's a lot of interesting content on the Feral Audio network?

25:58.880 --> 25:59.880
Well, I have no idea.

25:59.880 --> 26:05.480
Did you know, for instance, that Erin McGathy's This Feels Terrible has three live episodes

26:05.480 --> 26:07.880
available on the new Feral Audio store?

26:07.880 --> 26:10.880
Shut your mouth.

26:10.880 --> 26:15.880
And if there was an edit point where we were going to play 30 seconds of one of those.

26:15.880 --> 26:18.880
It would go a little something, like this.

26:18.880 --> 26:23.320
Let's bring out our guest, you know her from NBC's Community and a million other things

26:23.320 --> 26:26.880
and being so cool and smart and adorable, Gillian Jacobs.

26:26.880 --> 26:29.880
Just read your notes again.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.880
Stop looking at them.

26:31.880 --> 26:38.880
It says, Gillian, it says, you know her as Britta from NBC's Community, and then it says dot,

26:38.880 --> 26:43.880
dot, dot, Gillian Jacobs exclamation point, like, who are you talking to?

26:43.880 --> 26:49.880
Do you think you might not be able to make the show?

26:49.880 --> 26:52.880
Adam, go out and just be me.

26:52.880 --> 26:55.880
And make sure, I put an exclamation on it.

26:55.880 --> 26:59.880
And we're back.

26:59.880 --> 27:00.880
All right.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.880
So moving on, let's see.

27:02.880 --> 27:03.880
What do we got to talk about?

27:03.880 --> 27:07.880
Let's talk about people shoving tubes down you and you dressing up like a little lady

27:07.880 --> 27:08.880
in a movement.

27:08.880 --> 27:09.880
Yeah.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.880
If you follow me on Instagram, you saw that I was wearing a little gown.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.880
I went and got an upper endoscopy.

27:13.880 --> 27:14.880
I'm 40 years old.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.880
I've had heartburn for about three years.

27:16.880 --> 27:21.880
I've been taking, once I started taking Prilosec every day, everything's fine.

27:21.880 --> 27:27.880
But then I was watching a commercial for Prilosec with Larry the Cable Guy.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.880
And I didn't know where to put my eyes.

27:30.880 --> 27:33.880
So they went to the bottom of the screen where I saw the warnings at the bottom.

27:33.880 --> 27:39.880
And it said, like, if you're taking this for more than, I don't know, six weeks or something like that.

27:39.880 --> 27:43.880
It might be a redneck.

27:43.880 --> 27:47.880
That's Fox wrote it.

27:47.880 --> 27:48.880
See a doctor.

27:48.880 --> 27:49.880
So I did.

27:49.880 --> 27:51.880
And the doctor did what a good doctor does.

27:51.880 --> 27:55.880
He sent me to a friend of his from medical school and charged me a referral fee.

27:55.880 --> 28:02.880
And I went to that guy and he did what a good referral doctor does, which is go down a clipboard

28:02.880 --> 28:08.880
of questions that lead to him recommending a procedure that he makes money off of.

28:08.880 --> 28:10.880
And I signed off on it.

28:10.880 --> 28:15.880
And I went to this little clinic and they, I never, this is my first medical procedure ever.

28:15.880 --> 28:18.880
Unless you count like stitches like for my brother beating my ass.

28:18.880 --> 28:20.880
You were under general anesthesia.

28:20.880 --> 28:21.880
Were you not?

28:21.880 --> 28:22.880
Yeah.

28:22.880 --> 28:23.880
Like they put an IV in me.

28:23.880 --> 28:24.880
It was my first IV.

28:24.880 --> 28:26.880
I feel like I can still feel a little whole.

28:26.880 --> 28:28.880
It's very traumatic.

28:28.880 --> 28:34.880
I don't think we've, I don't think I've ever met anyone that went through what I've been through.

28:34.880 --> 28:38.880
But I was like, I was like laying there in the bed and then, yeah, and then they just

28:38.880 --> 28:42.880
like, they, they put some extra stuff in your IV and they go like, okay, you're going to

28:42.880 --> 28:43.880
get a little sleepy.

28:43.880 --> 28:44.880
And it's like,

28:44.880 --> 28:46.880
And then it's four days later.

28:46.880 --> 28:47.880
It's incredible.

28:47.880 --> 28:49.880
I had my, I mean, just to interject for a second.

28:49.880 --> 28:51.880
I only time I've ever gone under was for my wisdom teeth.

28:51.880 --> 28:54.880
I like a year or two ago had all four taken out.

28:54.880 --> 29:00.880
And apparently there was a struggle because when I woke up, the office was empty.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.880
The doctor was gone.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.880
The nurse was there and she looked fatigued.

29:04.880 --> 29:05.880
And I'm not joking.

29:05.880 --> 29:09.880
My belt was undone and I had defense wounds on my arms.

29:09.880 --> 29:14.880
I had, I had scratches on my forearms consistent with fending off a knife fight.

29:14.880 --> 29:17.880
Can't you even be unconscious normal?

29:17.880 --> 29:18.880
Can't you?

29:18.880 --> 29:19.880
Can't you?

29:19.880 --> 29:22.880
Do you have to be special when you're knocked out too?

29:22.880 --> 29:24.880
I think I got raped.

29:24.880 --> 29:26.880
It's not special.

29:26.880 --> 29:27.880
Me, me, me.

29:27.880 --> 29:29.880
At least he took pictures of my balls.

29:29.880 --> 29:30.880
Something happened.

29:30.880 --> 29:32.880
Maybe X-ray number.

29:32.880 --> 29:33.880
See if there's a,

29:33.880 --> 29:34.880
I don't know, man.

29:34.880 --> 29:37.880
But yeah, but I woke up and I think you're going to get a little sleigh.

29:37.880 --> 29:39.880
And then I didn't even hear the P.

29:39.880 --> 29:41.880
Then I woke up and there was a crime had been committed.

29:41.880 --> 29:42.880
Yeah.

29:42.880 --> 29:45.880
I honestly don't know, no offense to dentists.

29:45.880 --> 29:49.880
If you're a dentist and you, and you work hard and you care about people and you're wonderful.

29:49.880 --> 29:56.880
I'm not saying a statement about dentists, but I am saying that, that being a dentist,

29:56.880 --> 30:01.880
I don't think is enough of a qualification to have that much power over another human being.

30:01.880 --> 30:03.880
By default.

30:03.880 --> 30:07.880
I don't think it's, that's not cool.

30:07.880 --> 30:10.880
He was an oral surgeon, you know.

30:10.880 --> 30:11.880
When they did that.

30:11.880 --> 30:14.880
Well, aren't we all?

30:14.880 --> 30:18.880
Touche.

30:18.880 --> 30:20.880
I think it's pronounced tushy.

30:20.880 --> 30:21.880
No.

30:21.880 --> 30:22.880
I knew you weren't a surgeon.

30:22.880 --> 30:24.880
Serious over a bunch of,

30:24.880 --> 30:29.880
the, the, I'm just saying like, they put me under, they said,

30:29.880 --> 30:30.880
you're going to start to feel drowsy.

30:30.880 --> 30:32.880
I laid on my side and they're like, you're going to start to feel drowsy.

30:32.880 --> 30:34.880
And I just like, it's just like when you fall asleep,

30:34.880 --> 30:36.880
like you can never remember the moment you fell asleep.

30:36.880 --> 30:37.880
You remember being sleepy.

30:37.880 --> 30:41.880
You remember waking up, but, but I mean so much more profound because,

30:41.880 --> 30:47.880
because while I was sleeping, they did like,

30:47.880 --> 30:49.880
ridiculous things to my body.

30:49.880 --> 30:54.880
I mean, most notably shoving a camera down my esophagus for 25 minutes.

30:54.880 --> 30:55.880
And I have no recollection of it.

30:55.880 --> 30:57.880
They could have done butt stuff.

30:57.880 --> 30:59.880
They could have done anything.

30:59.880 --> 31:00.880
And I just woke up.

31:00.880 --> 31:04.880
I came, I came to, you can see it on my Twitter feed.

31:04.880 --> 31:06.880
I wasn't, I wasn't doing anything.

31:06.880 --> 31:09.880
I, the lady who was putting me under,

31:09.880 --> 31:13.880
I think like a friend of hers wrote on season four of community or something.

31:13.880 --> 31:20.880
So, like, so she, like, we were having a conversation about it before she was putting me under.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.880
She's like, oh, my friend wrote on that show.

31:22.880 --> 31:23.880
So-and-so.

31:23.880 --> 31:25.880
And I said, who?

31:25.880 --> 31:27.880
And she's like, so-and-so.

31:27.880 --> 31:28.880
He was a writer in community.

31:28.880 --> 31:31.880
I was like, season four, perhaps.

31:31.880 --> 31:32.880
And she's like, yeah.

31:32.880 --> 31:36.880
And I'm like, yeah, I didn't work on that season.

31:36.880 --> 31:38.880
She's like, oh, you're not working on the show anymore.

31:38.880 --> 31:39.880
I said, I worked on seasons one through three.

31:39.880 --> 31:41.880
Now we're coming back for season five.

31:41.880 --> 31:47.880
And an anesthesiologist went, that's weird.

31:47.880 --> 31:54.880
A woman who, that's how weird it is.

31:54.880 --> 31:58.880
A lady with no, no horse on that race is like, that's weird.

31:58.880 --> 32:00.880
I'm like, yeah, no shit.

32:00.880 --> 32:01.880
Yeah.

32:01.880 --> 32:04.880
I'm going to give you drugs and we're going to shove a hose down your mouth.

32:04.880 --> 32:07.880
But I will say this, from what I know about television,

32:07.880 --> 32:12.880
that's very odd, that situation that you're in.

32:12.880 --> 32:16.880
So I-but I woke up on a gurney and it was moving.

32:16.880 --> 32:19.880
And there were like these ladies looking down at me like I was a baby in a crib.

32:19.880 --> 32:22.880
They're like, it must be adorable for them when people wake up

32:22.880 --> 32:25.880
and they're like smiling at me.

32:25.880 --> 32:31.880
And I went like, give me my phone.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.880
I'm a writer.

32:33.880 --> 32:36.880
And the anesthesiologist went, give him his phone.

32:36.880 --> 32:39.880
He's a writer.

32:39.880 --> 32:44.880
And they gave me my phone and I tried as hard as I could to tweet while I was coming too.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.880
And you could see the tweets.

32:46.880 --> 32:49.880
They're like absolute, like Cyrillic.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.880
It's not your best work.

32:51.880 --> 32:56.880
Like only Anatoly would be able to read them.

32:56.880 --> 32:58.880
Yeah, it was not my finest work.

32:58.880 --> 33:00.880
And it wasn't like I was trying to say something profound.

33:00.880 --> 33:02.880
All I was trying to do was go, I'm trying to tweet.

33:02.880 --> 33:04.880
It wasn't really worth it.

33:04.880 --> 33:06.880
Why did you include, I'm a writer.

33:06.880 --> 33:10.880
How did you think that would expedite you getting the, like this goes above all of our heads?

33:10.880 --> 33:14.880
I'm not, my conscious mind is not accountable to the things my unconscious mind says

33:14.880 --> 33:16.880
as soon as I come out of unconsciousness.

33:16.880 --> 33:22.880
I apparently, I defined myself by what I do and felt like it entitled me to a phone.

33:22.880 --> 33:26.880
I had a friend because you have to get driven home from the hospital when you go under.

33:26.880 --> 33:29.880
So my friend drove me home from getting my teeth pulled.

33:29.880 --> 33:32.880
And I was still on the medication they had,

33:32.880 --> 33:35.880
but they said like in a couple hours a little wear off, go to your pharmacist

33:35.880 --> 33:37.880
and here's the prescription for the stuff.

33:37.880 --> 33:39.880
So I said, oh, my, that was really stoned.

33:39.880 --> 33:44.880
And I said, we have to go to my place because my insurance like pharmacy cards are upstairs.

33:44.880 --> 33:48.880
So I went and got all my insurance cards upstairs and I go, oh, she take this trash out too.

33:48.880 --> 33:52.880
So I took the trash out and we get to the pharmacist.

33:52.880 --> 33:55.880
There's people waiting and I'm like, oh man, it's starting to wear off.

33:55.880 --> 33:56.880
It really hurts.

33:56.880 --> 33:57.880
It really hurts.

33:57.880 --> 34:01.880
And I get to finally get up to the front and I don't have my cards with me.

34:01.880 --> 34:03.880
And we had to go back and look for the cards.

34:03.880 --> 34:04.880
I thrown them out.

34:04.880 --> 34:06.880
I put them in the trash.

34:06.880 --> 34:09.880
I was like, I shouldn't have been allowed that much responsibility.

34:09.880 --> 34:14.880
I shouldn't have been allowed to be in a, even though you need a ride,

34:14.880 --> 34:17.880
it should be illegal to get a ride home with your girlfriend after that.

34:17.880 --> 34:21.880
I was a prick to Erin because I, but I was like, it was like all dressed up.

34:21.880 --> 34:24.880
Like I was, I was the protagonist of the dead zone or something.

34:24.880 --> 34:30.880
You know, I was just being, I was just being mean to her because I had been unconsciousness and back.

34:30.880 --> 34:33.880
I was, I was like, Erin, I don't know.

34:33.880 --> 34:35.880
I wanted to go get a drink.

34:35.880 --> 34:46.880
And, and Erin, the villain in this story had overheard the professional doctors tell me not to drink

34:46.880 --> 34:52.880
because I had anesthetic goodness in my bloodstream.

34:52.880 --> 34:59.880
And so Erin, the villain in this story said, no, I'm not going to take you to the drawing room.

34:59.880 --> 35:05.880
And I was like, Erin, I have been to oblivion and back.

35:05.880 --> 35:13.880
You know, I shouldn't, all I know is I was, for 25 minutes of today, I did not exist.

35:13.880 --> 35:19.880
And I came back into existence and, and, and it shouldn't be, I shouldn't be regretting it.

35:19.880 --> 35:25.880
I, I love my return to consciousness, consciousness so much, I want to go straight to a bar.

35:25.880 --> 35:33.880
I really was like on this trip where I was like, man, I touched, I touched nothingness and I preferred it.

35:33.880 --> 35:36.880
Oh, so you, oh, so you were willfully trying to go get back in there?

35:36.880 --> 35:39.880
Kind of like, like, like, I just wanted to be somewhere dark and cold and have an Amstel.

35:39.880 --> 35:47.880
Like, I really wanted to just be alone more than anything because I really felt like, like, I had, I had never made it to 40

35:47.880 --> 35:54.880
without ever being knocked out voluntarily, by, or by another's hand, I should say.

35:54.880 --> 35:58.880
And, and I felt, I was, I was like, wow, I was, I was gone for 20 minutes.

35:58.880 --> 36:05.880
And then, and then I was back and, and, but it was, and it was great to be back, but it wasn't bad to be gone either.

36:05.880 --> 36:07.880
There wasn't, it wasn't that big a deal.

36:07.880 --> 36:10.880
Yeah, man, I'm right with you, man.

36:10.880 --> 36:12.880
I'm on the same wavelength, bro.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.880
And I kind of felt like that was an important, healthy exercise.

36:14.880 --> 36:20.880
Like, maybe at like a 16 year old's birthdays, they should, they should just have a guy like knock you out.

36:20.880 --> 36:27.880
Just so you can be dead for a second, and, well, that's an unfortunate linkage to the John Wayne Gacy thing from earlier.

36:27.880 --> 36:37.880
Your reactions are weird and your weird people, and it doesn't matter.

36:37.880 --> 36:41.880
The reaction was, they were waiting for what the next statement was going to be.

36:41.880 --> 36:47.880
No, I was saying, like, it should be a rite of passage, but 40 years old is too late to learn that it's okay to not exist.

36:47.880 --> 36:52.880
People knock themselves out all kinds of ways, and then they choke each other.

36:52.880 --> 36:59.880
Yeah, but if I, if I, if I drank a fifth of bourbon and passed out and you shoved a camera down my gut, I'd wake up and go,

36:59.880 --> 37:06.880
stop, stop it, bro.

37:06.880 --> 37:08.880
This is, this is knocked out, out.

37:08.880 --> 37:14.880
Like you, you lose, you know, and I think that the reality of that is a little bit important.

37:14.880 --> 37:17.880
It's not as profound as taking ayahuasca or anything.

37:17.880 --> 37:20.880
It's just like, but it's, it's, 40 is too late to, to learn that.

37:20.880 --> 37:22.880
So you're out for 20 minutes.

37:22.880 --> 37:25.880
Do you recall any, any, any, you know, visits?

37:25.880 --> 37:26.880
No, that's the point.

37:26.880 --> 37:30.880
It's, it's, if that's what, that's our biggest fear with death, right?

37:30.880 --> 37:37.880
Unless you're, unless you really think that, I mean, my biggest fear with death is that your last thought will play out, you know,

37:37.880 --> 37:43.880
like you'll be like, oh shit, did I leave the iron on and then for perceived infinity because your brain is like,

37:43.880 --> 37:49.880
also in charge of how you perceive time, like you'll forever like be wondering about your iron.

37:49.880 --> 37:53.880
But that might be also, was I addicted to my friends or I owe Toby 50 bucks?

37:53.880 --> 37:56.880
Like, they're just like, forever.

37:56.880 --> 38:02.880
Like, but, but I think by and large, our biggest fear is nothingness, oblivion.

38:02.880 --> 38:07.880
My biggest fear is why was my belt off when I came to it?

38:07.880 --> 38:09.880
All right.

38:09.880 --> 38:10.880
I mean, I have no point.

38:10.880 --> 38:11.880
I'm just saying.

38:11.880 --> 38:15.880
I'm just saying, I'm as special as I was before this experience, Jeff.

38:15.880 --> 38:20.880
I am, I am now like, Galvatron to my former Megatron.

38:20.880 --> 38:23.880
I have bathed in the lava of thank you.

38:23.880 --> 38:24.880
Thank you guys in the back.

38:24.880 --> 38:25.880
Are you okay?

38:25.880 --> 38:27.880
Are you, do you get a clean bill of health here?

38:27.880 --> 38:28.880
What's going on?

38:28.880 --> 38:30.880
Well, he didn't, I mean, he said he found a polyp.

38:30.880 --> 38:35.880
They made it sound like that's like a thing that you find like, like a seashell on a beach.

38:35.880 --> 38:37.880
Like he was just like, I just grabbed it.

38:37.880 --> 38:38.880
Like, it wasn't.

38:38.880 --> 38:40.880
You have a coral reef growing inside.

38:40.880 --> 38:43.880
Like everybody has a couple, has a polyp here and there.

38:43.880 --> 38:44.880
He's like, I found a polyp.

38:44.880 --> 38:46.880
Like, like, like he found a penny.

38:46.880 --> 38:49.880
But he said, you know, there's inflammation.

38:49.880 --> 38:50.880
You're 40.

38:50.880 --> 38:51.880
You got heartburn.

38:51.880 --> 38:55.880
I didn't see anything weird.

38:55.880 --> 38:57.880
I didn't, I didn't see Godzilla down there.

38:57.880 --> 39:02.880
I didn't see, didn't see any, but, but they'll give a full report to my doctor.

39:02.880 --> 39:04.880
And you said, you said you're going to stop drinking tomorrow.

39:04.880 --> 39:06.880
You're going on a little juice cleanse.

39:06.880 --> 39:07.880
Yeah, yeah.

39:07.880 --> 39:09.880
I mean, I've not.

39:09.880 --> 39:10.880
Don't, don't applaud.

39:10.880 --> 39:11.880
Don't applaud stopping drinking.

39:11.880 --> 39:16.880
I've got, I'm going on a, I'm going on a cleanse because I've gone way off my diet.

39:16.880 --> 39:19.880
And I think the best way to get back on that diet is to thank you, sir.

39:19.880 --> 39:23.880
We got to stop going to them for anything.

39:23.880 --> 39:27.880
All right.

39:27.880 --> 39:29.880
Our next guest is Anna Toley.

39:29.880 --> 39:31.880
Get up here, Anna Toley.

39:31.880 --> 39:33.880
Let's get that guy back up here.

39:33.880 --> 39:46.880
I didn't know that I would be a guest, so I, I, I, I want to get my 10 bucks for the

39:46.880 --> 39:47.880
ticket back.

39:47.880 --> 39:48.880
The to-

39:48.880 --> 39:49.880
Oh!

39:49.880 --> 39:51.880
He wants his 10 bucks back because he's a guest.

39:51.880 --> 39:53.880
Now I'm a guest at the show.

39:53.880 --> 39:54.880
Hey, this is, we, we want-

39:54.880 --> 39:56.880
That's a dangerous precedent to set, man.

39:56.880 --> 39:57.880
No, no.

39:57.880 --> 40:00.880
If you come up, if you come up on the show, you can have $10.

40:00.880 --> 40:02.880
Here, you know what?

40:02.880 --> 40:04.880
Keep the change.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.880
Perestroika, baby.

40:06.880 --> 40:07.880
$20.

40:07.880 --> 40:08.880
A $20 bill.

40:08.880 --> 40:09.880
How many rubles is that?

40:09.880 --> 40:11.880
Well, because he was a guest last time, too.

40:11.880 --> 40:12.880
It's like 600.

40:12.880 --> 40:13.880
600 rubles?

40:13.880 --> 40:14.880
Yeah.

40:14.880 --> 40:15.880
Damn.

40:15.880 --> 40:19.880
So Anna Toley, I got some follow-up questions having listened to the podcast that you were

40:19.880 --> 40:20.880
on.

40:20.880 --> 40:23.880
You, you, you came up, you said you, you came to UCLA to be a director.

40:23.880 --> 40:24.880
Yep.

40:24.880 --> 40:26.880
We said, do you have any favorite directors?

40:26.880 --> 40:27.880
No.

40:27.880 --> 40:28.880
You don't.

40:28.880 --> 40:29.880
You don't.

40:29.880 --> 40:30.880
I had favorite directors.

40:30.880 --> 40:31.880
I had favorite directors.

40:31.880 --> 40:32.880
It's Wes Anderson.

40:32.880 --> 40:33.880
Oh, Wes Anderson.

40:33.880 --> 40:34.880
Yeah.

40:34.880 --> 40:35.880
Okay, great.

40:35.880 --> 40:36.880
That's like, that's a good guy.

40:36.880 --> 40:37.880
And no one clapping.

40:37.880 --> 40:38.880
No.

40:38.880 --> 40:39.880
Wes Anderson.

40:39.880 --> 40:41.880
Wes Anderson, guys.

40:41.880 --> 40:43.880
Dan just, Dan just shut them off.

40:43.880 --> 40:44.880
Dan just told them to stop.

40:44.880 --> 40:47.880
Well, yeah, I don't, I mean, we're not on good terms, me and the audience.

40:47.880 --> 40:50.880
I think, I think they should just follow their hearts.

40:50.880 --> 40:54.880
You guys, you guys clap or boo whenever you feel like it.

40:54.880 --> 40:56.880
Fuck you!

40:56.880 --> 40:58.880
Show's over!

40:58.880 --> 41:08.880
So then we, we did a scene from Mad Men and you directed us.

41:08.880 --> 41:10.880
Which I thought was, I thought was pretty good.

41:10.880 --> 41:11.880
Our, our scene work?

41:11.880 --> 41:13.880
I thought our, our scene work was pretty, pretty tight.

41:13.880 --> 41:14.880
Absolutely.

41:14.880 --> 41:15.880
Pretty tight.

41:15.880 --> 41:20.880
But, but your direction was that I should dress differently and that the script should

41:20.880 --> 41:21.880
be better.

41:21.880 --> 41:27.880
And then you asked for a job.

41:27.880 --> 41:28.880
Yeah.

41:28.880 --> 41:29.880
Right.

41:29.880 --> 41:31.880
He certainly has the beard to be a director.

41:31.880 --> 41:32.880
Yeah.

41:32.880 --> 41:33.880
And then you came to, you came to Comic-Con.

41:33.880 --> 41:36.880
You were in the Rick and Morty panel at Comic-Con.

41:36.880 --> 41:37.880
Yeah, yeah.

41:37.880 --> 41:42.880
And I, and you, what were you saying at the microphone?

41:42.880 --> 41:43.880
At the begin.

41:43.880 --> 41:44.880
Yeah.

41:44.880 --> 41:47.880
When you got to the microphone, what were, what were you saying at the Rick and Morty

41:47.880 --> 41:48.880
panel?

41:48.880 --> 41:51.880
I was, I was saying that I had an Archer t-shirt.

41:51.880 --> 41:53.880
You had an Archer t-shirt on.

41:53.880 --> 41:54.880
Yeah.

41:54.880 --> 41:55.880
And you were pointing at it.

41:55.880 --> 41:56.880
Yeah.

41:56.880 --> 41:57.880
And there was something.

41:57.880 --> 42:01.880
Everyone, everyone thought that you were saying, God damn it.

42:01.880 --> 42:03.880
What does Archer t-shirt sound like?

42:03.880 --> 42:04.880
Like Machu Picchu.

42:04.880 --> 42:05.880
Yeah.

42:05.880 --> 42:08.880
Oh, everyone was saying, is he saying Machu Picchu?

42:08.880 --> 42:11.880
He's pointing at his Archer t-shirt.

42:11.880 --> 42:15.880
It's not, it's not really a story as much as there's a slice of life.

42:15.880 --> 42:16.880
Yeah.

42:16.880 --> 42:20.880
It's appropriate that you like Wes Anderson because you're kind of a Wes Anderson character

42:20.880 --> 42:21.880
at this point.

42:21.880 --> 42:22.880
Thank you.

42:22.880 --> 42:24.880
You're, you're, you're, you're this.

42:24.880 --> 42:29.880
So, so you go into UCLA, you're gonna, you're gonna, you're gonna make a, a, but you want

42:29.880 --> 42:31.880
to direct TV, not movies, right?

42:31.880 --> 42:33.880
I want to direct both.

42:33.880 --> 42:34.880
Okay, both.

42:34.880 --> 42:35.880
Fine.

42:35.880 --> 42:36.880
All right.

42:36.880 --> 42:41.880
What can, what can, how can we turn Anatoli into a, into a, into a thing that makes people

42:41.880 --> 42:42.880
clap?

42:42.880 --> 42:43.880
Um.

42:43.880 --> 42:44.880
Thank you, Anatoli.

42:44.880 --> 42:45.880
All right.

42:45.880 --> 42:46.880
All right.

42:46.880 --> 42:47.880
Thank you, Anatoli.

42:47.880 --> 42:57.880
Hey, he's fucking, he's 20 bucks in the black right now, man.

42:57.880 --> 42:58.880
Yeah, that's true.

42:58.880 --> 43:03.880
Anatoli, what are you gonna do with all that money?

43:03.880 --> 43:08.880
He will eat.

43:08.880 --> 43:10.880
I like the name Anatoli.

43:10.880 --> 43:13.880
I wish, I'm gonna name my son Anatoli.

43:13.880 --> 43:18.880
You know, I, I, I used to be like in high school, I didn't like reading all that much

43:18.880 --> 43:19.880
because I hated being told what to do.

43:19.880 --> 43:23.880
But then I got crammed in punishment by Dostoevsky, by this young teacher when I was a senior.

43:23.880 --> 43:25.880
And that was the first book I really fell in love with.

43:25.880 --> 43:28.880
And I, like, I became obsessed with Dostoevsky and then Tolstoy and Chekhov.

43:28.880 --> 43:30.880
And I became his big Russofile.

43:30.880 --> 43:35.880
And when I went to USC, I studied, like, I took all these classes in Russian literature.

43:35.880 --> 43:37.880
I went back and read some of the stuff I wrote.

43:37.880 --> 43:38.880
I was smart back then.

43:38.880 --> 43:39.880
I don't know shit anymore.

43:39.880 --> 43:43.880
So hearing the name like Anatoli makes me think of it's war and peace.

43:43.880 --> 43:45.880
It's Anatolian war and peace, isn't it?

43:45.880 --> 43:46.880
You?

43:46.880 --> 43:47.880
Yeah?

43:47.880 --> 43:48.880
Yeah?

43:48.880 --> 43:49.880
It's a huge book.

43:49.880 --> 43:50.880
It's got to be like four.

43:50.880 --> 43:51.880
Yeah.

43:51.880 --> 43:52.880
All right.

43:52.880 --> 43:55.880
It just makes me miss the days when I was smart.

43:55.880 --> 43:56.880
You're still smart.

43:56.880 --> 43:57.880
Yeah.

43:57.880 --> 43:58.880
I'm just saying I'm dumb.

43:58.880 --> 44:00.880
I'm saying, like, when you're in college, your brain is just like, you're, you're so active.

44:00.880 --> 44:01.880
No, it is true.

44:01.880 --> 44:05.880
If you're, if you're under 30, like, you know, you don't know, man, use it for something.

44:05.880 --> 44:08.880
I mean, just use it to have fun or make stuff.

44:08.880 --> 44:10.880
But you don't have to use it to, like, pick at anything.

44:10.880 --> 44:11.880
But yeah, you had to work.

44:11.880 --> 44:13.880
I worked so fucking hard in college.

44:13.880 --> 44:14.880
I never want to work that hard again.

44:14.880 --> 44:15.880
I think that's what it was.

44:15.880 --> 44:18.880
Like, I worked and I got my A's and I just got out of there.

44:18.880 --> 44:20.880
Like, I don't ever want that brain lock.

44:20.880 --> 44:21.880
So you're a writer.

44:21.880 --> 44:26.880
You go through, you force yourself into that procrastination fear that, that brain freeze

44:26.880 --> 44:27.880
of, I'm out of ideas.

44:27.880 --> 44:29.880
You hit those walls, things like that.

44:29.880 --> 44:31.880
Like, I couldn't put myself through that.

44:31.880 --> 44:32.880
Yeah.

44:32.880 --> 44:34.880
I'm multitasking.

44:34.880 --> 44:35.880
I'm multitasking.

44:35.880 --> 44:39.880
Well, then I'll ask you a question while you, while you thumb through your phone, your giant,

44:39.880 --> 44:40.880
your giant phone.

44:40.880 --> 44:41.880
All right.

44:41.880 --> 44:42.880
Ask me a question.

44:42.880 --> 44:44.880
How big is your phone?

44:44.880 --> 44:47.880
How's, how's the writing coming on, on season five?

44:47.880 --> 44:51.880
You know, it's, well, I mean, it's, on Friday, they're applauding.

44:51.880 --> 44:53.880
They didn't even know the answer yet.

44:53.880 --> 44:54.880
Anticipation.

44:54.880 --> 45:00.880
They, the, the, the new writers are coming along very nicely.

45:00.880 --> 45:05.880
The, the, we, on Friday, like the kind of, like a bunch of, a bunch of popcorn kernels

45:05.880 --> 45:06.880
popped at the same time.

45:06.880 --> 45:12.880
We kind of closed out Friday, like realizing that we had a handle on several great episodes

45:12.880 --> 45:13.880
all at once.

45:13.880 --> 45:15.880
And we rode down on a party bus to Comic-Con together.

45:15.880 --> 45:17.880
I got to meet plenty of them.

45:17.880 --> 45:19.880
Not all of them probably, but a lot of them.

45:19.880 --> 45:24.880
I, we're doing, as I've announced, because you have to know this before, well in advance,

45:24.880 --> 45:27.880
we're doing an animated episode this year.

45:27.880 --> 45:34.880
The, and I will say, the animated episode we're doing this year, even for this ridiculous

45:34.880 --> 45:40.880
show that we've been doing in all of its unmarketability, this, our approach to doing the animated

45:40.880 --> 45:44.880
episode this season is, is something that could definitely only be done in season five

45:44.880 --> 45:45.880
of Community.

45:45.880 --> 45:50.880
Like you, meaning that it's like, like even in season three of Community, people would

45:50.880 --> 45:53.880
be like, okay, come on, knock it off.

45:53.880 --> 45:55.880
But now they can't.

45:55.880 --> 45:59.880
And so it's, but, and I don't mean that it's just weird for weird sake.

45:59.880 --> 46:00.880
Quite the opposite.

46:00.880 --> 46:05.880
I mean, it's like, it's like very profound, like, in a way that makes it not, you know,

46:05.880 --> 46:07.880
it's like, this is a sitcom.

46:07.880 --> 46:09.880
But it will also be incredibly funny.

46:09.880 --> 46:13.880
It's going to be a fucking masterpiece if I do say so myself.

46:13.880 --> 46:21.880
Everything sounds horrible when it's followed by applause like that.

46:21.880 --> 46:25.880
Did you write this a profound episode after you got knocked out and saw the other side?

46:25.880 --> 46:29.880
No, I didn't, but I have all new angles on it now that I did.

46:29.880 --> 46:35.880
But no, I mean, it's the thing that I'm most proud of is that I was, you know, I, I, I,

46:35.880 --> 46:39.880
this was after we kind of like started breaking up the rooms and stuff with these writers.

46:39.880 --> 46:45.880
Like it's the thing that makes me so much happier than me staring at a whiteboard and

46:45.880 --> 46:49.880
coming up with something is, is when I leave a room for two hours and come back and people

46:49.880 --> 46:54.880
have landed on something, we just get, we just get some, some brilliant minds in there

46:54.880 --> 46:59.880
that are really, really, really respectful of the, of the medium and have come up with

46:59.880 --> 47:01.880
some incredible shit.

47:01.880 --> 47:04.880
Dino's going to, his name will be on the cover sheet.

47:04.880 --> 47:06.880
Dino's going to write the animated episode.

47:06.880 --> 47:08.880
But I mean, we'll all be writing it together.

47:08.880 --> 47:09.880
That's awesome.

47:09.880 --> 47:11.880
But it's, it's going to be a goodie.

47:11.880 --> 47:12.880
I feel comfortable.

47:12.880 --> 47:14.880
Can you see how many episodes in that will appear?

47:14.880 --> 47:16.880
Actually, no, because we're going to make it stand alone.

47:16.880 --> 47:19.880
It's product, it'll be production code 513 for you.

47:19.880 --> 47:21.880
Community production code heads.

47:21.880 --> 47:22.880
I think you're called.

47:22.880 --> 47:25.880
Freak out when you see the numbers are swapped and stuff.

47:25.880 --> 47:28.880
Any numbers you saw, you see swapped or it's for a reason.

47:28.880 --> 47:32.880
It's, it's because the directors needed certain schedule and stuff like that.

47:32.880 --> 47:36.880
We're giving the animated episode the last production code so that we can put it in.

47:36.880 --> 47:38.880
It's going to stand alone kind of.

47:38.880 --> 47:41.880
So anyways, that's enough of that business.

47:41.880 --> 47:43.880
What else was there?

47:43.880 --> 47:47.880
Went to Comic Con, had a weird stomach ache in front of that panel.

47:47.880 --> 47:49.880
An amazing panel, 6,500 people.

47:49.880 --> 47:53.880
I felt something I'd never felt before, which is like this weird like,

47:53.880 --> 47:58.880
like normally being in front of 6,500 people would be the most relaxing thing in the world for me.

47:58.880 --> 48:00.880
That's my inverted personality.

48:00.880 --> 48:03.880
I only know I exist when I, when people are listening to me talk.

48:03.880 --> 48:08.880
And, but I had this, I came up, I just had this swell of like,

48:08.880 --> 48:11.880
just gastrointestinal like tension.

48:11.880 --> 48:15.880
I felt like the upper half of my stomach had done 1,000 sit-ups.

48:15.880 --> 48:19.880
And I came off stage and explained that to Dino and he said,

48:19.880 --> 48:21.880
yeah, it's like, you got to watch what you say now.

48:21.880 --> 48:24.880
Like, like that's that, you know, that's, that's what happens.

48:24.880 --> 48:26.880
Oh, really? You think that was just like.

48:26.880 --> 48:29.880
Yeah, because I was like, I was so looking forward, so forward to the Rick and Morty panel,

48:29.880 --> 48:32.880
but now this community thing, it's, it's, it's, I'm sure it's all my fault.

48:32.880 --> 48:35.880
I'm not complaining about any of it, but this is just the phenomenon that's happened.

48:35.880 --> 48:38.880
Like, there's so much more wrong I can do than right by talking.

48:38.880 --> 48:41.880
And it's just like, like 6,500 people.

48:41.880 --> 48:47.880
And I'm just like, like, like, like, like, like, take one person

48:47.880 --> 48:50.880
that you could make cry by saying the wrong combination of words,

48:50.880 --> 48:55.880
whether that person is a Jeff Annie shipper, or a person who served proudly

48:55.880 --> 49:00.880
in our nation's armed services, or a double amputee,

49:00.880 --> 49:05.880
or a person that worked really hard on season four,

49:05.880 --> 49:10.880
or a victim of non-consensual sex in the summer of 98,

49:10.880 --> 49:14.880
or is that like someone that works for TV Guide,

49:14.880 --> 49:18.880
who really, really, really wants me to be an asshole.

49:18.880 --> 49:25.880
Like, like, there's so many, I go 6,500 people, 6,500 chances to fuck up

49:25.880 --> 49:28.880
to say the wrong thing. And I think I just, my brain went,

49:28.880 --> 49:30.880
okay, well, you can't deal with that.

49:30.880 --> 49:34.880
So I just pushed it all down into my, into my little Tim Tums.

49:34.880 --> 49:36.880
Tim Tums!

49:36.880 --> 49:40.880
That's where the cake in the vodka goes.

49:40.880 --> 49:42.880
That's not for dealing.

49:42.880 --> 49:45.880
But you don't feel that restriction in here,

49:45.880 --> 49:48.880
but this podcast goes out to a lot more than 6,500 people.

49:48.880 --> 49:52.880
Well, I mean, but, well, walking off that stage, I was like, fuck this.

49:52.880 --> 49:55.880
Like, I refuse to live my life feeling that way.

49:55.880 --> 49:59.880
Fuck you, fuck you in the teeth forever.

49:59.880 --> 50:01.880
Right in the teeth.

50:01.880 --> 50:05.880
If you would ever have anyone feel that way, go fuck you a million times

50:05.880 --> 50:08.880
in the big, fat face.

50:08.880 --> 50:11.880
Just fuck you for wanting people to feel bad.

50:11.880 --> 50:14.880
I just, I've never done anything to hurt anybody.

50:14.880 --> 50:18.880
I've never said anything that I wanted to, you know, make people feel pain.

50:18.880 --> 50:21.880
I just can't do it. I'd rather kill myself.

50:21.880 --> 50:23.880
I'll never feel that way again. It's a horrible experience.

50:23.880 --> 50:25.880
Anyways, okay, so...

50:25.880 --> 50:29.880
Worse than being in San Diego itself, that town is a fucking bummer.

50:29.880 --> 50:34.880
I'm not talking about downtown San Diego.

50:34.880 --> 50:36.880
Around San Diego is quite lovely.

50:36.880 --> 50:38.880
Can you even call it a downtown?

50:38.880 --> 50:39.880
I don't know, man.

50:39.880 --> 50:42.880
There's too many people there. It wasn't the Comic-Con's fault.

50:42.880 --> 50:44.880
It wasn't the people's fault that were there.

50:44.880 --> 50:46.880
You can't get a good bite to eat.

50:46.880 --> 50:48.880
No, I've been there during non-comicon.

50:48.880 --> 50:50.880
It's not, I mean, it's not...

50:50.880 --> 50:52.880
You got your San Francisco's, you got your Portland's,

50:52.880 --> 50:57.880
you got your New York's, your LA's, your Asheville, North Carolina's.

50:57.880 --> 50:59.880
Hipster towns.

50:59.880 --> 51:01.880
San Diego is not a hipster town.

51:01.880 --> 51:05.880
I don't know. It's just a neutral setting of hostility there.

51:05.880 --> 51:07.880
It's not because it's military bases.

51:07.880 --> 51:10.880
The military people you meet in there are quite nice and friendly and polite and cool.

51:10.880 --> 51:15.880
Yeah, but the equipment the military is using experimentally to enrage the populace.

51:15.880 --> 51:17.880
You're familiar with harp?

51:17.880 --> 51:18.880
I don't like it.

51:18.880 --> 51:21.880
I got thrown out of a bar. I wasn't doing anything.

51:21.880 --> 51:23.880
I sassafrassed the bouncer.

51:23.880 --> 51:26.880
I was standing kind of in the doorway.

51:26.880 --> 51:28.880
I was not standing in the door jam.

51:28.880 --> 51:31.880
I was two and a half feet back and a foot over to the side.

51:31.880 --> 51:35.880
So three people could have walked abreast like through that doorway and not bumped into me.

51:35.880 --> 51:37.880
And a guy just came in.

51:37.880 --> 51:39.880
I was the only guy in a suit and kind of a diving bar.

51:39.880 --> 51:42.880
And this guy, and they make all the bouncers there wear shirts to say security on them.

51:42.880 --> 51:45.880
And they all have ear monitors and it's a little much.

51:45.880 --> 51:48.880
And they card you just like checkpoint Charlie.

51:48.880 --> 51:50.880
Like, it's amazing.

51:50.880 --> 51:54.880
Well, essentially they're there for Comic-Con because, you know, it's crowd control and stuff, and that's cool.

51:54.880 --> 52:00.880
But there was a guy dressed as the crow at the bar who may dress like the crow every day.

52:00.880 --> 52:05.880
And was certainly acting like a guy who dresses like, who's like, oh, I get to dress like the crow.

52:05.880 --> 52:07.880
And who's like, brinking shit.

52:07.880 --> 52:09.880
Like, nobody was sassafrassing him.

52:09.880 --> 52:10.880
I was standing there in a suit.

52:10.880 --> 52:12.880
I had some drinks, but I wasn't bothering anybody.

52:12.880 --> 52:13.880
I was kind of just standing there.

52:13.880 --> 52:15.880
And the guy lives like, bro, you can't stand there.

52:15.880 --> 52:22.880
I'm like, and I look down and there's a little concrete square of kind of where the incline of the doorway comes in.

52:22.880 --> 52:24.880
You know, where they had to kind of pave that little way up.

52:24.880 --> 52:26.880
And I was like right on the edge of that.

52:26.880 --> 52:30.880
And so I just kind of semi sarcastically tiptoed just out of it.

52:30.880 --> 52:32.880
And he goes, keep moving, bro.

52:32.880 --> 52:37.880
I'm like, you tell me, I'm going to keep tiptoeing and you tell me when to stop.

52:37.880 --> 52:39.880
You're like, don't sass me, bro.

52:39.880 --> 52:40.880
Don't sass me.

52:40.880 --> 52:45.880
I'm like, look, not only would I never sass you, sir.

52:45.880 --> 52:48.880
I have so much respect for you and what you're doing right now.

52:48.880 --> 52:51.880
I just want to be the world's best customer at this bar.

52:51.880 --> 52:53.880
And I want to know all the rules.

52:53.880 --> 52:54.880
I want to know everything.

52:54.880 --> 52:56.880
So I don't want to get this one wrong.

52:56.880 --> 52:57.880
I go, is this okay?

52:57.880 --> 52:59.880
And he's like, he just gave me the eyeball.

52:59.880 --> 53:05.880
And then an hour later, I'm in the back, like leaning up against like a stack of beer boxes, texting my girlfriend, not doing anything.

53:05.880 --> 53:06.880
Bro, you're wobbly.

53:06.880 --> 53:07.880
You got to go.

53:07.880 --> 53:13.880
Like he took him an hour to get ahead of steam or a couple of shots of drone attack.

53:13.880 --> 53:16.880
He just got fucking like, he was separated from the pack.

53:16.880 --> 53:20.880
And then the things kind of polite on my end kind of went out the window.

53:20.880 --> 53:23.880
Yeah, I've seen you more sober, but I've seen you a lot drunker.

53:23.880 --> 53:26.880
And everyone in that bar was also drunker.

53:26.880 --> 53:29.880
Like, I mean, you weren't doing anything wrong.

53:29.880 --> 53:30.880
He goes, you're wobbly.

53:30.880 --> 53:31.880
And I go, I'm not wobbly.

53:31.880 --> 53:32.880
You can't even talk right now.

53:32.880 --> 53:33.880
You're slurring, bro.

53:33.880 --> 53:34.880
I'm not.

53:34.880 --> 53:35.880
Yeah, you see, you're slurring.

53:35.880 --> 53:36.880
I go, you're a cunt.

53:36.880 --> 53:44.880
And I go, do you read me, big buddy?

53:44.880 --> 53:46.880
Am I coming in?

53:46.880 --> 53:48.880
And then right when you walked over, what's going on?

53:48.880 --> 53:49.880
Well, this guy's a cunt.

53:49.880 --> 53:50.880
Oh, who's this guy?

53:50.880 --> 53:51.880
This guy's a cunt, too.

53:51.880 --> 53:52.880
I don't know.

53:52.880 --> 53:53.880
There's two guys.

53:53.880 --> 53:54.880
This guy's a coward because he did this.

53:54.880 --> 53:56.880
We cocked his fist at me and he didn't do anything.

53:56.880 --> 53:59.880
So cunt, coward, cunt.

53:59.880 --> 54:03.880
Look, don't throw me out of your bar.

54:03.880 --> 54:07.880
Yeah, the people that go into that line of work.

54:07.880 --> 54:08.880
All right.

54:08.880 --> 54:12.880
I mean, well, if you are a cool bouncer and I know there must be a lot of them because

54:12.880 --> 54:13.880
there's a lot of cool places to drink.

54:13.880 --> 54:14.880
They generally are.

54:14.880 --> 54:16.880
They don't work in San Diego.

54:16.880 --> 54:17.880
Yeah, yeah.

54:17.880 --> 54:19.880
They're like, please thank you.

54:19.880 --> 54:20.880
That's not true.

54:20.880 --> 54:23.880
I'm in a very nice bouncer who had the full thing and he was quite helpful and nice,

54:23.880 --> 54:25.880
but he just looks like, I don't know, San Diego.

54:25.880 --> 54:31.880
Too many sideways or backwards baseball hats on white dudes with crocs or flip-flops on.

54:31.880 --> 54:37.880
San Diego may officially get the Jeff Davis patented thumbs down and fart sound.

54:37.880 --> 54:39.880
That means a lot to people.

54:39.880 --> 54:40.880
It does.

54:40.880 --> 54:41.880
What?

54:41.880 --> 54:42.880
I'm not being sarcastic.

54:42.880 --> 54:43.880
Thumbs down and fart sound?

54:43.880 --> 54:44.880
Thumbs down from Jeff.

54:44.880 --> 54:45.880
Like, you know, Jeff.

54:45.880 --> 54:46.880
I rarely do it.

54:46.880 --> 54:48.880
San Diego is a giant county and it's a big city.

54:48.880 --> 54:50.880
There's whales that just got the thumbs down.

54:50.880 --> 54:51.880
Like, you didn't even...

54:51.880 --> 54:52.880
Don't get me started on Blackfish Man.

54:52.880 --> 54:53.880
I just saw that yesterday.

54:53.880 --> 54:55.880
You guys want to get it bummed out?

54:55.880 --> 54:56.880
I wasn't.

54:56.880 --> 54:57.880
It's a bummer.

54:57.880 --> 54:58.880
You know about this movie?

54:58.880 --> 54:59.880
No.

54:59.880 --> 55:00.880
It's a documentary.

55:00.880 --> 55:01.880
Is that like The Cove or something?

55:01.880 --> 55:02.880
No, it's...

55:02.880 --> 55:03.880
Well, kind of.

55:03.880 --> 55:04.880
It's the concrete pool.

55:04.880 --> 55:10.880
It's about SeaWorld's treatment of orcas and the cover-ups of the people that die training

55:10.880 --> 55:11.880
them there.

55:11.880 --> 55:12.880
Wait.

55:12.880 --> 55:13.880
People die?

55:13.880 --> 55:14.880
Yeah, they die.

55:14.880 --> 55:19.880
And it's just an absolute, like, PR just thing.

55:19.880 --> 55:20.880
Because there's one whale...

55:20.880 --> 55:25.880
I don't want to spoil it for everybody, but there is one whale that ate a lady.

55:25.880 --> 55:27.880
It was not much of a spoiler.

55:27.880 --> 55:29.880
Yeah, and it's not because it's in the news and stuff like that.

55:29.880 --> 55:34.880
But what I did not know is this whale's backstory is pretty fascinating.

55:34.880 --> 55:36.880
And this whale has a backstory.

55:36.880 --> 55:42.880
Apparently, it once walked on land and looked much like a pronosaurus.

55:42.880 --> 55:48.280
All right, well, let's bring up the rest of our little rascals and get their two cents

55:48.280 --> 55:49.880
on everything that's happened tonight.

55:49.880 --> 55:50.880
Kumail Nanjiani.

55:50.880 --> 55:51.880
We missed you.

55:51.880 --> 55:52.880
Conan O'Brien's Kumail Nanjiani.

55:52.880 --> 55:53.880
Conan O'Brien's Kumail Nanjiani.

55:53.880 --> 55:54.880
It's been a while.

55:54.880 --> 55:55.880
You know what?

55:55.880 --> 55:56.880
Can I say?

55:56.880 --> 55:57.880
Kind of fuck San Diego.

55:57.880 --> 55:59.380
Would you fuck it right in the teeth?

55:59.380 --> 56:03.880
Would you fuck it with a side of beef?

56:03.880 --> 56:15.880
Would you fuck it on a bagel?

56:15.880 --> 56:19.880
I would fuck it till it queefed.

56:19.880 --> 56:20.880
I like your meter.

56:20.880 --> 56:21.880
Yeah.

56:21.880 --> 56:22.880
A-B-C-B.

56:22.880 --> 56:27.880
That was like a kind of a haiku.

56:27.880 --> 56:28.880
I was that comic on.

56:28.880 --> 56:29.880
I went to see it.

56:29.880 --> 56:30.880
I didn't run into you.

56:30.880 --> 56:35.080
It's like super packed, so I was with my wife and we were walking side by side, and it's

56:35.080 --> 56:39.880
like just a ton of people around, and Emily looked at me and she's like, there's a guy

56:39.880 --> 56:44.960
with his crotch on my butt right now, right behind me.

56:44.960 --> 56:53.040
So I looked back to sort of see, because expecting like a huge crowd, it was just one guy.

56:53.040 --> 56:59.680
It was me, Emily, and then just one guy, nobody else around, just like a butt backpack on,

56:59.680 --> 57:01.680
like just attached to her.

57:01.680 --> 57:09.180
Like the rules of society kind of don't apply, and comic on.

57:09.180 --> 57:14.560
The weird thing that's starting to happen now is that, because I'm old.

57:14.560 --> 57:17.640
I was there in the 90s when I was signed in comic books.

57:17.640 --> 57:20.080
There was a Marvel Center.

57:20.080 --> 57:26.880
There were video game consoles being sold there, but we nerds were allowed to sit on

57:26.880 --> 57:33.120
the floor of hallways with our big bags of shit that we bought at our nerd mecca and

57:33.120 --> 57:34.360
go through shit.

57:34.360 --> 57:37.840
And then there was a tipping point that got crossed, I don't know, let's say six years

57:37.840 --> 57:42.120
ago, I have no idea, whenever, I mean there was just a point where it was like, this movie

57:42.120 --> 57:45.800
has nothing to do with comic books, but it's appearing here anywhere, but I realize community

57:45.800 --> 57:47.000
is part of the problem.

57:47.000 --> 57:52.920
I like returned to this like sun dance of things, but now you just get cattle prodded

57:52.920 --> 57:54.760
if you're a nerd and you try to sit down anywhere.

57:54.760 --> 57:59.840
They're like, keep it moving, keep it moving, and it's like, and yeah, I really hate the

57:59.840 --> 58:05.400
booth babes thing, like that is so fucking gross to me, all those like, I feel horrible

58:05.400 --> 58:09.040
for them too, because they're like, this is the, you know, three days of the year where

58:09.040 --> 58:15.080
they definitely have work, but if you go day three, their eyes are so sad, but there's

58:15.080 --> 58:21.520
also now it's like, it's almost like, it's the worst of all worlds because it was nerd

58:21.520 --> 58:25.320
mecca, but now it's nerd sun dance, and now because it's nerd sun dance, it's a form of

58:25.320 --> 58:29.080
sun dance, so now there's this douchey component coming in.

58:29.080 --> 58:34.000
I saw, I was in a pizza parlor and there were two girls who were in costume and they didn't

58:34.000 --> 58:39.680
know each other, but some guys wanted pictures with them, and then another guy, like with

58:39.680 --> 58:45.160
a backwards baseball cap and some crocs and some flip flops and some flute flops, who's

58:45.160 --> 58:49.840
sitting in the pizza parlor, he started yelling out, he's like, make out, make out!

58:49.840 --> 58:55.320
And I was like, oh, well, whatever, San Diego meets Comic-Con, he had laminates on, he was

58:55.320 --> 59:01.680
a fucking Comic-Con guy, he was just there to see, you know, fucking, Ben Affleck III

59:01.680 --> 59:03.680
or whatever's premiering there, you know?

59:03.680 --> 59:07.560
Are we already at Ben Affleck III?

59:07.560 --> 59:13.840
You know what we are, because we had Ben Affleck I was like, mall rats and stuff, then Ben

59:13.840 --> 59:19.160
Affleck II was Goodwill Hunting, and now Argo is Ben Affleck III.

59:19.160 --> 59:20.160
This is Ben Affleck III.

59:20.160 --> 59:22.680
Well, now he's, yeah, now he's directing and he's got a beard.

59:22.680 --> 59:28.160
Okay, let's, I forgot to bring out the list of our little rascals, we got to get Darla

59:28.160 --> 59:42.640
and Spanky out here, Erin McGathy, and Spencer, Spencer Crittenden, our Dungeon Master.

59:42.640 --> 59:56.560
Aaron, anything, any, any, you have to stand back in the booth and listen to me talk for

59:56.560 --> 59:59.600
an hour, would anything you want to feed that guy?

59:59.600 --> 01:00:10.880
I'm from San Diego, and I, I couldn't agree more, I, I, it is like a douchey, like it's

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:14.800
a, Comic Con is very different than what the town's vibe is generally.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:22.520
Yeah, I mean, like as a, as a high schooler there who felt like an outcast, being, being

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:27.560
really hot and, I mean, the problem is, is that it's so beautiful in San Diego that there's

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:33.000
no, there's no real like art or theater scene that's supported as much as it should be, because

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.800
everyone's like, let's just jet ski.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:42.520
And it's a big retirement community, also it's so hot there that if you're a fat 15-year-old

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:48.680
and you're wearing sweatshirts, everyone notices, and you, you can't really fly, like, fly under

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:54.840
the radar, being unique is not valued in San Diego, but shout out to the two people I still

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:57.600
talk to there.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:59.920
The guy, the Joe Carrara way, sweetie.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:11.560
I mean, San Diego obviously has like, cool parts to it, but it like, there is, there's

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:18.560
a big value put on conformity and being able to wear a mid-drift.

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:19.560
Seafood.

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:20.560
Seafood.

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:21.560
And backwards, backwards.

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:25.760
There's a big jock culture there, and I think it is, it is due in part to the military

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:29.960
basis, which is fine, like, I come from a military family, and I'm not saying that the military

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:33.120
is bad or anything, but there is like, there's a big like macho thing there.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.120
Well, the whole thing about-

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.120
Well, the whole thing about-

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.160
Douchebaggery that I have noticed down there, my brother went to college there, so I was

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:40.360
down there a lot, and I used to go down there for lots of reasons and stuff.

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:44.240
You don't see fights in bars in Los Angeles, almost never.

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.240
I don't know what that's about.

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:48.400
Because they always wanted to protect their face, that's their life.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:55.040
Even like, even in dodgy bars where people are already beat up, like, I think there's

01:01:55.040 --> 01:02:02.000
a level of like, he might shoot me, or I'll be looking over my shoulder for the rest of

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.720
my life if I do that.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:08.760
But in San Diego, people fight in bars, like, it's just a weird tension and a hostility

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:10.560
that I cannot get on board with.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.560
Yeah.

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:12.560
Oh, by the way, can I say something?

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:17.720
This is changing the subject, is that when you woke up, I've heard, and it's easier

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:21.880
that when you wake up, different parts of your brain wakes up at different times.

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:26.720
And so, the part that is more aggressive wakes up before the part that sort of controls

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:27.720
that.

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:28.720
It sounds accurate.

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:31.520
Give me my phone, I'm a writer.

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:43.040
Yeah, so that was just brain chemistry, man, that's not on you.

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:45.920
I punched my mom after I came out of...

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:47.420
You punched your mom?

01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:48.420
I was 12.

01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:49.920
No, don't do that.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:53.160
You haven't met her.

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:58.600
Jeff, look what time it is.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:03.720
I have to be honest, I looked over a minute ago, it was 9.10.

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:04.720
I was...

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.080
However booed you punching your mom, I have to boo them.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.080
Boo.

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.240
Yeah, I apologize afterwards.

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.840
I don't remember doing it.

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:16.720
Also, obviously, if you didn't tell people that you punched your mom, you're not like

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:20.080
going, hey, it's something you should cheer.

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:21.800
Yeah, I'm being revealing and you guys are...

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:24.720
It might have been an ironic boo, I think people are having fun with it.

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:25.720
Well, now I boo your...

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.720
It's a very vocal audience, we were commenting.

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:33.400
Yeah, well, I've engaged them, they can sense in me, they can sense what happened to me

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:38.160
at Comic-Con or they can sense what happened to me in Oblivion.

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:40.080
You know what, I know exactly what you feel.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:42.080
It feels like when you get...

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:46.840
I was like 12 when I had surgery and I had like ear problems my whole life and I would

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:49.440
get these horrible ear ricks and it was like, when you're old enough to have surgery, when

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:52.680
you're old enough to have surgery and when I was 12, I was old enough and I was planned

01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:56.920
for months and I was there waiting and the doctors came in and scrubbed and they were

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.160
like, hey, do you want to go to the circus?

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:03.680
And I was like, fuck you, I'm not an animal.

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:08.120
But I went in and they strapped me down and I fought and they put a mask on my face and

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:13.000
they were like, blow it, there'll be a balloon, one, I'm too old at this point to give a shit

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.800
about a balloon and I remember blowing as hard as I can and being like, there's no balloon,

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.300
I'm like screaming it.

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:24.120
But it feels like such a violation that they can put you out that hard.

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:28.760
When I woke up, I was like angry that they have the ability to do that to me.

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:31.800
Like I have favorite ice cream flavors and shit and you took it all away.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:35.000
Well, I didn't, I should be clear, I didn't feel that way at all.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:41.520
I was, I was so grateful for Western medicine and all that it, I, I, I, I, I, you love balloons.

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:47.400
I didn't want, they said you're going to start to feel drowsy and I was, I was so grateful.

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:53.280
I like, like three seconds and then blink and then I heard like a beep beep and it felt

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:57.920
like I could hear beeping for a while and then to wake up in a crib pushed by ladies

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:02.280
smiling and going, did I die and go to heaven?

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:06.520
I had a camera down my throat and I didn't know I was, I was very, no, I liked that I

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:11.560
was out, but I, I just was a little, like I had all my wisdom teeth out last year and

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:13.960
I was like, don't put me under one go.

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:14.960
Yeah.

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:15.960
Uh, yeah.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.680
No, in a couple of goals, couple of different goals.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:18.680
You opted to be awake.

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:23.320
Well, I hadn't gone to the dentist in like 15 years and I was at a burger place and it

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.920
said, get the Buffalo burger.

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:30.280
If the native, native Americans only ate buffalo and if they had proper dental care, they would

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.400
have lived to be 120 or something.

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:36.760
So I was like, uh, shit, I got a, you know, what restaurant was this?

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:40.000
It's called the fixed burger.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000
So I went to the dentist and I was like, Hey, it's just a regular checkup.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.280
And she was like, emergency dental surgery right now.

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:54.320
Your mouth is a cave of nightmares.

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:56.240
I knew it was going to be back and she was like, give me symptoms.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:07.600
And I said, if I ice cream on the left side of my mouth, my spine hurts.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:08.600
You might be a redneck.

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:13.760
So I had months of surgery for that and I didn't want to go under because that time

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:17.640
when I was 12, it felt, to me, it felt like a violation, but that's very interesting to

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:18.640
me.

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:21.800
I mean, that's, there's a four, there's a fork on the road there.

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:31.880
The fact that you felt, I, my terror, my like, I want to be out because I don't want any

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:32.880
of it to be happening.

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:33.880
Yeah.

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:38.520
But you, but you're like, I didn't want to be there for it, but I didn't want to get

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:39.520
put under that.

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:46.600
While it's happening, I regretted it because they were playing 13 going on 30 and I was

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:52.040
like, this dental surgery is the second worst thing I'm going through right now.

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:53.680
Spencer, have you ever been knocked out?

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:56.800
I'm on stage two.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:00.320
That's, that's not, that's not a complaint.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:01.320
That's not a complaint.

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:06.200
That's just a clarification for our podcast listeners because they heard an applause.

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:09.920
Spencer has, for those of you that never been to or seen a picture of us, Spencer's

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.640
at the kids table over on the side.

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:12.640
Yeah.

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.640
No, I'm, that wasn't a complaint.

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:14.640
I promise.

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:15.640
I'm not, I'm fine.

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:16.640
You've been surgery'd before.

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.640
You've been surgery'd?

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:18.640
Yeah.

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:19.640
What was it?

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:22.320
Is that, is that how you conjugate that?

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:23.320
Why not?

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:24.320
Who cares?

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:25.320
You can barber.

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:26.320
Do you know what I said?

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:27.320
It's a sewing term.

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:28.960
It just, I mean, it made sense, right?

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:29.960
Yeah.

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:30.960
That's all that counts.

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.960
That's the beautiful thing about the English language.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:33.960
What the fuck?

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:40.440
Spencer and Jeff have been fighting all day, just so you guys know.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:41.440
Yeah, no.

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:44.320
I've had all my wisdom teeth out.

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.040
That was crazy.

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:50.480
I've had a, okay, everybody in the audience has to be honest.

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:52.920
Does anyone know what a pylonidyl cyst is?

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:53.920
You?

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:54.920
Is it in your butt?

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:55.920
Yeah, yeah.

01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:01.040
It's not fun, but it's also not terrible, but I had one of those dealt with.

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:02.040
It's a cyst up your butt?

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:04.840
That's interesting because I would think most things to do with your butt would either

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:06.640
be great or terrible.

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:07.640
Yeah.

01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:08.640
And this is like a-

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:12.280
I'd say it's the most, you know, ambivalent thing you could do with your butt.

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:13.600
You could take it or leave it.

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:14.600
Yeah.

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:18.680
Well, that's the weird thing about it because you could like, depending on, you know, the

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:23.280
intensity, sometimes it's better to not have it operated on and sometimes it's better to

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.560
have it operated on.

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:25.560
What is it?

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:26.560
It's a cyst up in your butt hole?

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.560
Okay.

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:31.200
It's like, it's like, it's like, you know, if you have an ingrown hair and it kind of

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:34.160
becomes infected and then if you squeeze it, the hair comes out and there's a tiny little

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.160
bit of pus.

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:39.560
It's like that in that it develops this kind of channel from your hair follicle that gets

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:40.560
infected.

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:41.560
In your butt?

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:42.560
Yeah.

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:43.560
The whole thing is in your butt.

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:46.440
The scent, well, not in your butt, it's in the butt crack.

01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:47.440
Like-

01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:48.440
Oh, so not the hole.

01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:49.440
Yeah, no, above it.

01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:50.440
It's in the-

01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:51.440
It's in the runway.

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:52.440
Lower back.

01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:55.360
It depends on, you know, which direction your approach is.

01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:59.960
My confusion is that why would they bother to call it a special kind of cyst when it's

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:00.960
just-

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:04.960
Well, a cyst implies it's like, you know, in my mind, it's like kind of like a growth,

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:10.440
like a tumorous growth, but it's more like just like a little opening, like a little-

01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:13.320
Is the, what was the word you said before, cysts?

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:14.320
Pylonitral.

01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:15.320
No.

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:16.320
Go away.

01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:17.320
Oh.

01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:18.320
Spencer's dad has-

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.320
Spencer's dad has-

01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:20.320
Hold on.

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:21.320
Hold on.

01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:22.320
Let me explain this.

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:23.800
My dad also had to deal with this.

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:24.800
That's all he's going to contribute.

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:25.800
Spencer's dad has just-

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:26.800
We can stop there.

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:27.800
Spencer's dad just kind of-

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:28.800
Spencer's dad is re-working the stage?

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:29.800
See, he's had a couple.

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:30.800
There you go.

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:31.800
That was-

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:32.800
So much to talk about.

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:33.800
Thank you, Mr. Creighton.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:51.160
My mom came over to my house today to drop off some T-shirts, but she stayed there.

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:52.840
Spencer.

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:55.520
I can't get her out of the chimney.

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:57.960
No, she left eventually.

01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:58.960
Well, I'm-

01:09:58.960 --> 01:09:59.960
I'm-

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:00.960
I'm ornery about my parents.

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:03.560
Well, they can be a drag at your age, you know.

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:04.560
You want-

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:05.560
Yeah.

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:06.560
You want some elbow room.

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.560
It's literally.

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:08.560
Yeah.

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.560
You saw me elbowing them.

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:12.560
Well, you moved out of your parents' home at 23, 24 years old?

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:13.560
Yeah.

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.320
And so what's the problem now?

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.320
Are they happy you're gone?

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:17.320
Sad you're gone?

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:20.960
I just don't, you know, communicate with them like most people communicate with their

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:21.960
parents.

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:25.080
So, you know, I'm like, let's just do it that way.

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:26.080
And that's how I do it.

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.480
And they're going through maybe a little bit of like-

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.480
Well, yeah.

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:30.480
Because I'm great.

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:31.480
Right.

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:32.480
You are great.

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:35.920
I guess without knowing that you probably brought some structure and order possibly to

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:36.920
the household, maybe.

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:37.920
Right.

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:38.920
I'd like to think so.

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:39.920
Yeah.

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:42.480
Hey, before we move, do you want to finish telling us about the-

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:43.480
Yeah.

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:47.040
Well, it just happened and, you know, you could get it cut out for a while.

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:52.760
Does the word that you said before the word sist, does that word mean in the butt crack?

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.400
No, it's really gross.

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:55.960
It means nest of hair.

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:56.960
It doesn't-

01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:57.960
So, it has-

01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.960
It's not an accurate depiction.

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:03.640
The fact that it was in your butt crack has nothing to- that's just incidental, right?

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:04.640
No, it was because-

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.640
You could get one of these on your chest.

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:06.640
You could get one on your arm.

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:09.480
Oh, no, I do call my asshole a nest of hair.

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.680
A pilonitis.

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:14.360
The word nest implies that there's creatures dwelling.

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:15.360
That's why it's gross.

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.360
That's why it's gross.

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:20.080
But I know what it means, so I'm not just going to be like, I don't know what it means.

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:24.000
Have you guys seen the new CW show, Nest of Hair?

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000
It's about San Diego.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:35.760
But I'm still- I mean, I want to know, does that word mean in the butt crack, or does

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:36.760
it-

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:37.760
No, it means nest of hair.

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.240
So, is it something that only happens in the butt crack?

01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:44.840
Yeah, because that's where there's friction, and when you're sitting, that's where sometimes

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:50.440
sweat collects, and if you're in a car or a vehicle, there's agitation when you're bouncing

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:55.080
in the car, and that's why a lot of GIs get it, and it's known as Jeep Butt.

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.080
Jeep Butt.

01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:57.080
Yeah.

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.080
That's cute.

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:02.680
Sometimes you'll see a family of finches fly out of your pants.

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:03.680
Yeah.

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:05.320
I wonder how it's a Jeep Butt.

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:08.080
Could you have one of those, and then it goes away, and then it comes back, or something

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:09.080
like that?

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.000
Yeah, it's like a pimple.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.160
In that, like, you know, it just- it'll get bigger, and then it'll pop, and then it'll

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:17.760
go away, or sometimes in rare cases it could get infected, like a pimple.

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:19.360
You know, like an opening in the skin.

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:21.560
And this is something you had to get surgered.

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:26.040
It will- they recommended it, and we did it, but you don't need to.

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:27.520
Like, it kind of depends.

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:31.160
It's a case by case basis, but essentially what they do is way worse, because it's like

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:36.440
this tiny hole in your skin on your butt, and what they do is they cut out like a wedge

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:37.440
of it.

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:41.240
It's like, you know, when you transplant a plant, where you just take a huge scoop of

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:42.800
earth out from around it.

01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:45.600
So you have a slightly bigger butt than you used to?

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:50.600
No, because they seal it back together, and they literally use, like, glue, like this

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:53.360
crazy adhesive glue stuff, and they glue it back together.

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:58.080
All this feels like you just went to a weird frat party.

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:01.160
I mean, arguably.

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:04.200
Isn't doctoring fraternity?

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:07.480
Is that your mom?

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:08.480
I'm sure.

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:12.800
A gal from the audience, it is a woman.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:18.640
Somebody's boasting that her nest of hair jeep butt pimple was worse than yours.

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:19.720
I don't doubt that.

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:24.440
So they scoop out a hole, and then they, yeah, like glue it back together.

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:27.360
Dan, are you so interested in this because you want to be knocked out again?

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.160
Are you looking for it?

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:31.480
You're wondering if you have a nest of hair.

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:34.720
Yeah, I am a nest of hair.

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:41.480
Okay, all right, well, so you've been knocked out while I did that.

01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:44.480
Did you find it to be a profound experience?

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:45.480
No.

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:52.920
It's a lot like, I don't dream very often, I mean, everyone's going to be like, everybody

01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:53.920
dreams.

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:57.000
I don't really, you know, dream, but I don't dream that much at all.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.560
Yeah, like, it's not like it never happens, but you know, you guys are living your dreams

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:01.560
when you're awake.

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:02.560
Oh, Dan.

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:05.560
No, I'm not even trying to be weird.

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:10.920
Well, you succeeded, great.

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:11.920
I don't know.

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:12.920
That's probably why.

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:13.920
What?

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:14.920
That doesn't make it whatever.

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:16.360
The thing is, I get what you're saying.

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:20.080
I think when you're dreaming, your brain's like getting off excess energy, and I feel

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:23.560
like if you're already using that when you're awake, maybe there's not as much to give off

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:24.560
when you're asleep.

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:25.560
Well, I like that.

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:29.320
I like that a lot more than I thought it meant, what it meant initially.

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:30.640
Your brain is dead.

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.640
Yeah.

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:32.640
Well, just when you're asleep.

01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:33.640
Yeah.

01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:35.520
Because it's so awake when you're awake.

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:36.520
That's what he's saying.

01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:37.520
Yeah.

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:40.200
I dreamt that was Batman a couple of nights ago.

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:46.560
Now, if we know your history of psychic stuff, does that mean that's going to happen?

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:49.200
Wait, but there was a crime that was committed.

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:50.200
Uh-oh.

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:51.200
Fucking tennis, dude.

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:54.200
You're just having an espresso at an Italian cafe.

01:14:54.200 --> 01:15:00.080
We don't need you to sleep on another 9-11 here.

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:06.560
I was Batman, and I was wrongly convicted of like a accuse of a crime that I didn't commit

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:11.080
like by a super villain maybe, and this is definitely, I had watched Robocop the night

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:17.240
before, so I think this is a Robocop dream, but then I had to hide and dress like a regular

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:20.720
person and go through an airport, and I got held by security at an airport, so let's

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:21.720
help the airport.

01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:24.680
This is days ago, so we're all in the clear.

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:25.680
Okay.

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:26.680
Couple days ago.

01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:27.680
Can I plug something?

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:28.680
Yeah.

01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:33.760
Is it Spencer's nest of hair?

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:36.920
Is that like a butt plug sort of play on words thing?

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:37.920
Yeah.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:38.920
I've had a few.

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:39.920
Do people plug?

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:40.920
That's okay, right?

01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:41.920
Yeah.

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:42.920
Go ahead and plug.

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:45.760
I had a special come out on Comedy Central.

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:46.760
You should.

01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:47.760
It's called Beta Mail.

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:48.760
Go to CC.

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:56.960
If you go to CCdirect.ComedyCentral.com, it's $5, that's the cheapest way to get it.

01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:58.280
Or you could torrent it.

01:15:58.280 --> 01:15:59.280
I don't care.

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:03.000
I don't really get that money.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.400
So people in back love torrenting.

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.400
That makes sense.

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:10.800
The people who got here later, they know the ropes.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.920
And you know, so this was a big deal for me when I was airing and I told my parents to

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:14.920
watch it.

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:16.560
And the next day I got a text from my parents.

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:21.760
This is sort of shows what my relationship with them is like, it just said, saw your

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:22.760
program.

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:29.760
I think we may be brother and sister.

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:30.760
Yeah.

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:31.760
Is it like that?

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.880
Did you go back to the punch that happened when you were 12?

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.080
Well, yeah, maybe.

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:38.080
So you woke up, you socked your mom, and was there a melee?

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.080
Did she fire back?

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:40.080
Was there a scuffle?

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:41.080
I think she's still firing back.

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:42.080
Did you follow up?

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:43.080
Did you text back?

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:44.080
No, I didn't talk to them.

01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:45.080
Would I get an uppercut?

01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:46.080
No.

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:47.080
The app is not your program.

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:52.080
Yeah, that was her punching back.

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:57.040
I didn't talk to them for a week, and then I talked to them today, and it wasn't brought

01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.040
out.

01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:02.440
But as a comedian, doing Letterman is the biggest thing you can do.

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:05.640
And I was like, all right, I finally do something that they know what Letterman is.

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:06.640
I do other shit.

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:10.400
They don't know very much about pop culture, but they know Letterman.

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.400
So I did Letterman.

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:15.440
I talked to them on the phone, and they were like, hey, we saw you on Letterman.

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:19.760
And then just told some story about my aunt.

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:22.080
I was like, I don't know what's happening.

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:27.040
What could you say to them that would make them very proud, in a sentence?

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:28.040
I'm Muslim.

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:40.720
All right, Spencer, do you want to dispense the character sheets and get this D&D session

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:41.720
underway?

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:42.720
Yeah, sure.

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:43.720
Why not?

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:47.360
Also, while he does that, it's probably a good time to plug the fact that we're finally

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.800
getting that stuff underway.

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:51.520
We're recording.

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:59.080
It's called Harmon Quest right now, as we're recording this D&D thing that we've been

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:00.800
alluding to forever.

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:06.840
Spencer's Dungeon Mastering, we're playing D&D and recording the audio in front of a

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:12.840
live audience, just as we do here, only we're doing it on a little bit of a budget with

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:19.320
some of our favorite comedic cameo people at the Silent Movie Theater in combination

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:22.920
with screenings of crazy fantasy-themed movies.

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:27.240
And then we're going to take the audio from the role-playing sessions, give it to my studio

01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:31.600
Star Burns, and they're going to stop motion animate the combat and stuff.

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:36.880
It's going to be an awesome movie.

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:41.080
So if you want to be part of that, check online.

01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:42.240
It's called Harmon Quest.

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:43.240
It's at CineFamily.

01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:45.720
It's being done in conjunction with CineFamily.

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:49.840
That's why we're doing the fantasy-themed movies and stuff.

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:52.160
When's the first one coming up?

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.680
That's this coming Saturday.

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:54.680
Is it really?

01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:56.240
Is there money?

01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:59.200
Does it cost money to get in?

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:01.200
How much does it cost to get in?

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:02.200
$80.

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:03.200
$14.

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:04.200
$14.

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:07.840
That's a bargain.

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:10.040
But if you're Anatoly, you make $38.

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:16.280
Yeah, you know, I was thinking about that, I put on like 60 episodes.

01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:25.360
No, but yeah, www.CineFamily.org, that's www.CineFamily.org.

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:34.840
I think the first one might be Excalibur.

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:35.840
Yeah.

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:36.840
Oh, the first film?

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:44.240
The first film is Excalibur, and the first guest is?

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:45.240
Adam Sandler.

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:46.240
It's going to be there.

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:47.240
No shit.

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.920
Now you have to get Adam Sandler.

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:54.480
The first guests, the first night's guests are Blake Anderson from Workaholics and Kumail

01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:55.480
Nagyane.

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:56.480
Kumail Nagyane.

01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:57.480
From Conan O'Brien.

01:19:57.480 --> 01:19:58.480
All right.

01:19:58.480 --> 01:19:59.480
We plug that.

01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:01.960
Spencer, shall we get underway here?

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:02.960
Sure.

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:06.120
Dan, if you pass the sheets down, I will give Spencer his theme music and we can get this

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:10.280
rolling.

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:19.440
Last time our heroes were on the road to Farnheim to end their fight with Admiral Darkstar.

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:24.480
As they traveled north, they went up into the mountains towards Farnheim, the frozen

01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:25.480
city.

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:31.200
Yerch had suggested they stop there to ask for an army or maybe horses or some form of

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:38.400
other style aid from the city, and after many days there they trekked high up mountains

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:42.280
and up onto a specific mountain range in particular.

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:50.280
But there they encountered a deadly blizzard, but through the driving snow and ice they

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:53.760
could see the white walls of the frozen fortress.

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:58.840
There was a bridge, quark suspicious, but Sharpie pushed on.

01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:01.120
They started to cross the bridge.

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:04.200
They did not finish crossing the bridge.

01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:07.840
From afar the city fired cannons and skeletons landed in the ice.

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:11.720
Sharpie tried to reason, but quark leapt into action, tackling one of them, and the gang

01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:12.720
was fighting.

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:18.160
The skeletons attacked with wicked blows, Morene understood the beast's rage, and looked

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:22.240
into its dead eyes in empathy.

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:28.080
Sharpie grasped one of the skeletons with a shocking grasp, surging electrical energy

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:32.840
through its brittle bones, causing it to cause fire and fall on the floor.

01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:34.940
Two skeletons remained.

01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:36.520
What would they do?

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:37.520
Combat is happening.

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:38.520
Now.

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:47.520
Alright, two skeletons left.

01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:48.520
Alright.

01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:49.520
Easy.

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:51.520
Yeah, we're on an icy bridge.

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:52.520
Who's up first Spencer?

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:56.320
Quark, you were wrestling with one of them, you're currently wrestling him and you're

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.800
trying to throw him off the bridge.

01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:01.680
Okay, I just try to grapple him and just throw him off the side.

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:02.680
Yeah.

01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:03.680
Alright.

01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:04.680
That happens.

01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:05.680
Nice.

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:09.520
Grappling with the skeleton, you get the upper hand.

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:11.360
Did you just drop your, that's awesome.

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:12.360
Sorry.

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:16.040
You get the upper hand, you drop to the floor and then throw him over your shoulder and

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:21.240
he goes sailing off the white edge of the icy bridge, he's the abyss.

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:25.600
I yelled, second!

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:27.880
Some skeleton remains.

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:28.880
Whose turn is it?

01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:30.120
That'd be yours.

01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:32.120
Okay.

01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:33.960
How close are we to the skeletons?

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:39.840
You're about 25 feet off, it's kind of engaged with mole rain right now and sharpie, but

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:40.840
you're a bit off.

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:41.840
I'm a bit off?

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:42.840
Yeah.

01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:43.840
Alright, well.

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:44.840
He was always there.

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:45.840
Okay.

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:48.360
Everybody shut up.

01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:51.960
I do, I mean, I take my poison dagger, will that work?

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:54.680
Take that poison dagger through my heart.

01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:57.400
Oh, the poison won't, but the dagger won't.

01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:58.400
Huh?

01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.960
Poison doesn't work on undead.

01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:02.120
Uh, while the dagger does.

01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:03.640
Yeah, that's what I was saying.

01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:04.640
Yeah.

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:05.640
Definitely.

01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:06.640
Cool.

01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:15.240
So I sneak attack the guy and just go to town.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:18.480
Going to town on the guy with a sneak attack.

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:31.600
You strike directly between his shoulder blades, dealing 15 damage.

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:37.840
I give Chris de Burgh a little, uh, chit, did you call it, like, uh, from AA.

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:44.360
That's one, one day of not tying a rope around your dagger when you throw it.

01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:45.360
You know what?

01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:47.160
I thought about it a lot.

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:51.200
I could see, but you spend the toughest day of my life.

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.600
Did you call it a chit?

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:53.600
I know.

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:59.040
Yeah, you get that little chit with a chip chip chip chip chip is a thing too.

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.040
Is it?

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:01.040
Yeah.

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.040
I don't know.

01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:03.040
Google it.

01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:04.040
Yeah.

01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:05.040
It's in your butt.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.040
I believe you guys.

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:07.040
Is it, uh, is it almost dead?

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:09.440
Uh, you don't know it is undead.

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:12.680
It's a lot, but it's, what is it doing right now?

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:15.480
It's, it is, uh, you know, it's being stabbed.

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:17.560
There's a knife in it.

01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:18.560
Okay.

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:19.560
It's not like responding.

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:20.960
How is it reacting?

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.680
It's not like, it's not like a person that feels pain.

01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:24.680
It's more like a skeleton.

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:25.680
No, not like a.

01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:26.680
I'm.

01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:27.680
It's all right.

01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:30.400
That's, you know, the skeletons are me.

01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:33.400
We went over this.

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:34.400
That's a throwback.

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:35.880
Who's, who's next?

01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:37.400
That's Mulrainee's turn.

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:38.400
All right.

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:42.880
Uh, so I have no idea how the skeletons reacting.

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:51.000
So I'm going to just, uh, grapple, I'm going to, I'm going to grapple with the skeleton.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:56.360
I'm going to make eye contact with him and I'll say, thank you for your sacrifice.

01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:59.160
And I try to throw him off the bridge.

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.160
Okay.

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:02.160
Don't look at me, Dan.

01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:07.240
I just want to know like what, how, how, what, you wanted to know how the skeleton

01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:09.000
was reacting before you did that?

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.560
Like what would you have done?

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:15.920
Well, I mean, if Camille did that and he was like, all right guys, come on, let's cool

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:16.920
it.

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:17.920
Oh, okay.

01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:18.920
You just wanted to make sure the monster wasn't.

01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:19.920
Okay.

01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:20.920
All right.

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:21.920
All right.

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:22.920
That's a monster.

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:26.320
Or if he, or if he was on the ground or if he was flying, I mean, I, Spencer's much smarter

01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:27.320
and better than I am.

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.680
No, that makes sense now that you explained it, but yeah.

01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:30.680
Yeah.

01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:35.920
Can I, I also do a pink mass on it to make it gay in the after.

01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:41.880
Does it, do they have to be dead for that?

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:47.520
No, I mean the, for the pink mass, I think you could do it in terms of Satanist ritualism.

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.520
I think you could do it to someone who's alive, right?

01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:53.440
Well, I mean, couldn't they just be like, I'm going to be gay.

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:54.440
Yeah.

01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:57.080
And then they wouldn't need this whole satanic ritual.

01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:58.080
Who are the Satanists?

01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.080
What are you talking about?

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:00.080
The pink mass.

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.080
What is a pink mass?

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:02.080
No, that's it.

01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:07.480
They were doing like a sort of protest on the grave of this lady making her gay in the

01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:08.480
afterlife.

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:09.480
Anyway.

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:10.480
It happened in the show earlier on.

01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:12.480
That doesn't happen in Dungeons and Dragons.

01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:13.480
It fails.

01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:17.520
So you're still, you're still straight.

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:19.520
Yeah, still straight.

01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:20.520
Fuck.

01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:23.600
What, what happened with my grappling?

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:24.600
Yeah.

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:25.600
Okay.

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:28.880
So you managed to wrestle it and you're trying to, trying to flip it over, you know, off the

01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:29.880
edge.

01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:34.080
But you just, you guys go down to the floor and you're just kind of grappling with each

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:35.080
other, wrestling style.

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:36.080
So I didn't.

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:41.360
It didn't, she didn't have enough force to send it over the edge.

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:42.360
Okay.

01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:44.480
But you know, it's down, it sits there.

01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:46.080
But it's on me.

01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:47.080
You're on it also.

01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:48.080
Definitely still straight.

01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:49.080
It's a mutual kerfuffle.

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:50.080
Does he have a boner?

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:51.080
No.

01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:52.080
Yeah, I know.

01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:53.080
That was my joke that he was a skeleton.

01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:54.080
Yeah.

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:55.080
Someone in the audience says he's a skeleton.

01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:56.080
Yeah.

01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:01.160
I'm sorry, I apologize.

01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:02.160
So I'm on him.

01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:03.160
It's not working though.

01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:04.160
Yeah.

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:05.160
He doesn't have a boner.

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:06.160
Okay.

01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:07.160
Just to clarify.

01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:08.160
Putting it in a sharpie.

01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:09.400
Quirk actually does have a boner.

01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:12.280
He gets a boner, a bad boner sometimes.

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:13.280
Just to clarify.

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.080
I've got a battle boner.

01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:16.080
Just like an anger boner.

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:18.960
It's just the only one I'm in, only one I'm in battle.

01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:21.880
Or when you want to fuck a horse or whatever.

01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:25.280
Oh yeah.

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:26.280
Saddle battle.

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:27.280
Putting it.

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:28.280
Saddle boner.

01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:29.280
Saddle boner.

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:33.000
All right.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.280
I can't use shrink item on a skeleton that's only an item, right?

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:37.280
That's correct.

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:40.240
Do I have any shocking grasps left?

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:41.240
Yeah.

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:42.240
Yeah.

01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:45.080
On your trek you gain back all your spells and you've only used one of them.

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:46.080
All right.

01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:51.040
But isn't that also, if he's grappling with her, isn't that going to shock both of them?

01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:53.480
Who knows?

01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:56.440
You've got to do it.

01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.080
Let's see what happens.

01:27:58.080 --> 01:27:59.080
It's magic.

01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:00.080
All right.

01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:08.320
I initiate my shocking grasp and then I say something involving bones.

01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:09.320
Some kind of pun.

01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:10.320
A pun?

01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:11.320
Bone.

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:12.320
You're a bone.

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:13.320
Bone out.

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:14.320
Bone to know you.

01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:15.320
Bone to know you.

01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:16.320
Bone viash.

01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:17.320
Adam Goldberg.

01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:18.320
Adam Goldberg.

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:19.320
Adam Goldberg.

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:20.320
Adam Goldberg.

01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:21.320
Take a bow.

01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:22.320
Stand up.

01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:23.320
Adam Goldberg.

01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:24.320
Bone viash.

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:25.320
That's fantastic.

01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:31.320
It could have been her all night and not top bone viash.

01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:33.320
No, that you would not be.

01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:35.320
I was like, hey, mandible shit.

01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:36.320
Yeah.

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:37.320
Yeah.

01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:39.320
Danzel is bone to know you.

01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:45.320
This has never been my wheelhouse puns, but bone viash.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.320
Yeah.

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:56.200
I do it with an Austrian accent, bone viash and grasping him with a shocking energy.

01:28:56.200 --> 01:29:01.760
Electricity crackles through his bony body and you hear a sizzling from deep within

01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:08.920
his chest and then he catches fire and falls to the floor inert.

01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:18.920
Bricks like he, Skeleton fell apart.

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:19.920
You can't improvise a pun.

01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:20.920
Can you?

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:21.920
He fell like a Skeleton.

01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:22.920
You can't.

01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:23.920
Bricks.

01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:24.920
You can't.

01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:25.920
I win.

01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:26.920
I count it.

01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:27.920
I count it.

01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:28.920
I get 500 experience points.

01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:29.920
He gave himself.

01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:30.920
I'm having my own podcast over here.

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:31.920
It's high time.

01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:32.920
Well, we did it.

01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:40.920
So we did it.

01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:43.920
I forge on towards the far side of the bridge.

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:47.920
You forge on towards the far side of the bridge.

01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:54.920
You see the gates of Fornheim standing tall and imperious.

01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:59.920
They slowly grind open and you can hear a voice from within echo out like a trumpet.

01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:01.920
Welcome to Fornheim.

01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:03.920
The fortress of the mighty.

01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:05.920
The land of the strong.

01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:06.920
I call back.

01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:07.920
Weirdest welcome ever.

01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:08.920
There's no response.

01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:11.920
Huge waste of energy and manpower.

01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:23.920
That would be funny if every time you drove into Indiana, you'd hear, welcome to Indiana.

01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:24.920
The sunshine.

01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:25.920
This is it.

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:30.920
But also like if there was a locked gate that only opened after you fought for Skeletons.

01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:33.920
I mean, just lock the gate harder.

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:35.920
Make signals here again.

01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:39.920
Make it clearer that we're not welcome.

01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:40.920
Metagaming?

01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:43.920
I mean, no, mate.

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:45.920
All right, well, we go in.

01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:46.920
We go in.

01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:47.920
We go in.

01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:48.920
Good call.

01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:53.920
Yeah, you enter the walls of Fornheim and you see stuff.

01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:56.920
I look around to see whether.

01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:58.920
Yeah, sorry.

01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:00.920
I'll go.

01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:03.920
As you enter the massive gates, you're met with an awesome sight.

01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:08.920
The massive city within the massive walls is full of massively oversized buildings.

01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:14.920
With paths as wide as ponds and houses as big as castles as well as towering giants.

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:20.920
These blue-skinned beings with coarse pale blonde and icy hair stand about 15 to 20 feet tall.

01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:26.920
Clanking around in heavy metal armor, talking, conducting in business and are shooting the breeze.

01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:28.920
Literally.

01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:33.920
In sharp contrast to the massive blue figures and icy white trails, or in icy white walls,

01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:35.920
you can make out specks dot around the city.

01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:39.920
Black blobs that you recognize as more of those Skeletons you fought earlier.

01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:44.920
They're marching and patrolling the streets as well as manning the gates and guarding the walls.

01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:48.920
I thought this was like a dwarf town.

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:50.920
I got confused.

01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:54.920
Yeah, maybe we should have done a little more reconnaissance before we came into this place.

01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:56.920
That's something you can do.

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:58.920
Maybe we should get on top of each other's shoulders.

01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:00.920
And put on a giant trench coat?

01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:01.920
Yeah.

01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:05.920
And hold our breath through a blue in the face?

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:07.920
So why are we in this town? I'm sorry.

01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:10.920
Because the guy went, welcome. And we said, let's go. And now we're in here.

01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:12.920
No, no, no. But like, before that.

01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:13.920
Yeah, before that.

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:14.920
Oh, we're looking for Admiral Darkstar.

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:15.920
Okay.

01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:17.920
Yeah, he's to the north and this is on your way to the north.

01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:18.920
He's a bad guy.

01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:20.920
Well, we were talking about raising an army here.

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:21.920
Right.

01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:23.920
That should be no sweat.

01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:25.920
We just killed a couple of their homies out front, didn't we?

01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:28.920
But it seems like that's how you open the door.

01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:30.920
Yeah, maybe, yeah.

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:33.920
Who's the biggest and baddest here?

01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:38.920
Like, let's walk in there and talk a big game and say, look, we're not here to fuck around.

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:42.920
We're here to get an army together and go kill Admiral Darkstar.

01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:47.920
I can use my, I mean, in a different way, I could use my diplomacy.

01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:48.920
Try to talk to them.

01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:49.920
Okay.

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:51.920
But who do we talk to?

01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:52.920
Can we walk?

01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:55.920
Yeah, I look for the sweetest faced giant.

01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:56.920
Okay.

01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:02.920
Well, some guy who's clearly like nicer than the other, that's like giving water to the

01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:03.920
smaller giants.

01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:06.920
I'm just laughing.

01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:07.920
Someone drops a hat.

01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:09.920
He gives them their hat.

01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:15.920
Scanning the city, you see what you make out to be the most jovial of the giants.

01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:18.920
But not in anyone else's expense.

01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:22.920
He's not laughing because he's picking on them.

01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:23.920
Right, right, right.

01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:24.920
Okay.

01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:25.920
Just making sure.

01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:27.920
I mean, that's fine.

01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:28.920
You see him.

01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:30.920
He looks jovial.

01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:31.920
Okay.

01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:33.920
Do you guys mind if I approach?

01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:34.920
Knock yourself out?

01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:35.920
Yeah.

01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:36.920
We'll be back here.

01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:37.920
Okay.

01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:40.920
No, I go with her because we still have our little buddy pack.

01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:41.920
Yes, thank you.

01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:44.920
I go with her because I wouldn't miss this for the world.

01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:51.920
I put on a shirt that says Team Giant on it and I walked there.

01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:56.920
Aaron talking to a non-player character is like every time the smoking man showed up

01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:57.920
in X-Files.

01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:00.920
I am riveted.

01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:05.920
Yeah, so you and Quark are kind of walking up?

01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:07.920
Well, we'll all go.

01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:08.920
Okay.

01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:10.920
You're all walking up.

01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:12.920
Hello, sir.

01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:19.920
He's like, you're closer to heaven.

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:22.920
How does the joke land?

01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:29.920
The giant looks as if perhaps he was bit by a mosquito, sort of like a...

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:31.920
And this is the happiest guy.

01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:32.920
Yeah, yeah.

01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:39.920
And then he kind of looks around and then he looks down at you and then he points at

01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:42.920
you and he's like...

01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:43.920
It landed, it landed.

01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:44.920
Yeah, I think it landed.

01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:45.920
You got a chuckle.

01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:47.920
Hey, good one.

01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:52.920
Boy, since I was a young girl, I have dreamt of being in a town like this.

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:57.920
What is it like to be the most fantastic looking...

01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:00.920
Okay, guys, what do I do?

01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:02.920
No, no, you're doing great.

01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:03.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:05.920
Finish the fantastic looking thing.

01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:08.920
You got it right where you want them.

01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:14.920
Or what is it like to be the most fantastic looking and...

01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:15.920
You emanate this joy.

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:18.920
And me and my friends were very nice, peaceful people.

01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:21.920
And we just wanted to know what was happening here.

01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:23.920
And I've been talking for too long and this is what I do.

01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:26.920
And I drop my papers like in a romantic comedy.

01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:29.920
And I hope that he's going to pick them up.

01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:33.920
Because I'm like, I'm Meg Ryan and I'm just so flustered.

01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:35.920
Oh, I'm such a clumsy bitch.

01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:37.920
What do I do?

01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:45.920
Does he help her with the papers?

01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:50.920
No, his hands are probably too big to pick them up.

01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:55.920
But he doesn't help with the papers.

01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:59.920
Sir Giant, we are travelers from the south heading north.

01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:03.920
And whoa, but did we stop here?

01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:05.920
Mr. Happy?

01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:12.920
I'm Robin Williams.

01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:17.920
We are in pursuit of a threat that threatens all of...

01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:19.920
What's this planet called?

01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:20.920
Earth.

01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:25.920
Earth.

01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:28.920
I'm kind of standing behind all of them

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:33.920
and just instinctively grabbed the handle of my sword.

01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:39.920
I should tell them that I'm like a very well-known singer-songwriter.

01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:42.920
I move my hands like I'm about to take off my tiny little clothes.

01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:47.920
We request an audience with your leader, if you have one,

01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:50.920
or the commission that leads you.

01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:52.920
But you're probably the leader, right?

01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:54.920
I mean, he looks like the leader.

01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:58.920
Either that or a model.

01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:02.920
He kind of just looks at you guys all saying and doing these things

01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:04.920
and describing, saying and doing.

01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:05.920
Can he not hear us?

01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:08.920
No, he is. He's exactly hearing you right now,

01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:09.920
and I'm describing that.

01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:11.920
And he is hearing.

01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:13.920
He's like, yeah, but he's listening,

01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:16.920
and he's looking at you guys, do stuff.

01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:21.920
And then he's like, so, you're looking for the yarrow.

01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:22.920
Yeah, that's it.

01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:24.920
We're looking for the yarrow.

01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:25.920
That's it.

01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:27.920
I don't even know why we forgot the word for it.

01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:28.920
That's exactly right.

01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:31.920
We should have said that when we first showed up.

01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:36.920
Well, it ain't just anyone that can see the yarrow.

01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:39.920
Okay, yeah, who can see the yarrow?

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:41.920
Only the strong.

01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:44.920
Did you hear that thing that was said when you entered the city?

01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:50.920
No, we were busy mocking it.

01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:51.920
We are strong.

01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:53.920
We slayed a couple of...

01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:56.920
Tell him that!

01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:00.920
Dire wolves.

01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:03.920
Good save, bro.

01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:08.920
Yeah, yes, I've plucked many a dire wolf from my garden.

01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:11.920
I don't think he knows what the word means.

01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:13.920
He grows wolves.

01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:15.920
This guy rocks!

01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:19.920
Can we just hang out with him for a while?

01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:22.920
Well, if there was a way that we could prove our strengths,

01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:24.920
other than getting in your...

01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:26.920
Not to put too fine a point on it,

01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:31.920
then a hospitable threshold.

01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:35.920
Tough, tough ice city.

01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:37.920
We would love to prove our strengths

01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:40.920
and or just have our strengths taken as a flier

01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:45.920
and get an audience with a four mention yarrow.

01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:49.920
Also, if you Giants enjoy a show by tiny people,

01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:52.920
maybe the four of us could put on a small show.

01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:53.920
It's true.

01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:55.920
We are singer-songwriters.

01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:58.920
I've recently gotten into doing some sketch comedy stuff.

01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:01.920
I've heard enough of this as the barbarian.

01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:05.920
I'm as tough as any man here.

01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:07.920
Giants or no.

01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:12.920
Then prove it.

01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:14.920
Oh, show me the way.

01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:15.920
Punch me, punch me.

01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:20.920
Okay, I go up to a quirk and I go,

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:25.920
hey, insolent person, and I'm winking at him.

01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:27.920
We're gonna do like a Star Trek movie.

01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:28.920
I got you.

01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:31.920
Hey, shut your mouth, you little fucker.

01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:33.920
I'm one of the 12 different planets.

01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:36.920
Yeah, well, you're not so tough.

01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:37.920
You're not so tough.

01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:38.920
And I get in there and I say,

01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:39.920
no, lay off him.

01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:41.920
I drop my papers again.

01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:46.920
Stop that.

01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:48.920
I can't help it.

01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:51.920
I take Sharpie and I give him a little wink.

01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:54.920
I return the wink and I pick him up over my head

01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:55.920
and start spinning him around.

01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:57.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:00.920
This guy's a real tough customer.

01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:05.920
And then I take him and I find the biggest,

01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:07.920
the biggest busiest ice road

01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:10.920
and I throw him down like I got a roadhouse bar top.

01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:12.920
I just slide him down.

01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:17.920
But I'm so much bigger than you.

01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:18.920
Bunk.

01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:20.920
In the chaos, I go off in the corner

01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:25.920
and I tie a rope to a knife.

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:26.920
Be prepared.

01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:28.920
Always be prepared.

01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:29.920
Okay.

01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:35.920
Yeah, you attempt this display of mock violence

01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:38.920
and it's really pitiful.

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:41.920
Like it's not working.

01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:43.920
It's not working.

01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:48.920
And then he throws you and you go skidding down this ice road

01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:52.920
and then he's like, that's pretty tough.

01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:53.920
I got it.

01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:55.920
Wait, when I throw Sharpie?

01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:56.920
Yeah.

01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:57.920
Oh, he likes that.

01:40:57.920 --> 01:40:59.920
As pitiful as it was, it seemed to have impressed him.

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:01.920
So now we go to see the arm?

01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:03.920
He's like, yeah, you know, I mean,

01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:05.920
if you guys are really that tough,

01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:07.920
but you might have to pull that shit again

01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:09.920
in front of some other giants.

01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:12.920
Oh, I got bit.

01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:20.920
I think we just accidentally blew the roadie.

01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:21.920
Classic.

01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:22.920
Classic mistake.

01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:23.920
Classic.

01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:26.920
Real amateur move.

01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:29.920
Pink Floyd's in the green room.

01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:31.920
Lead the way, sir.

01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:33.920
He's like, I don't lead.

01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:35.920
Follow the silent servants.

01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:38.920
He kind of points at a line of skeletons

01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:40.920
that are kind of patrolling through the city.

01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:44.920
Lead by one of these skeletons is just a blaze on fire.

01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:46.920
He's just lit on fire.

01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:47.920
I say, thank you, sir.

01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:49.920
You are truly the most joyous creature

01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:52.920
that we have encountered in a long time.

01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:54.920
So does a skeleton on fire?

01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:56.920
Yeah, it's kind of walking around through the city,

01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:59.920
melt nice and snow, and there's a column of steam

01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:00.920
kind of rising off of it.

01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:01.920
Cool.

01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:03.920
And you're just walking in a line.

01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:05.920
All right, well, we should follow that.

01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:06.920
Yep.

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:07.920
Okay.

01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:08.920
Do you still have your Giants T-shirt on?

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:10.920
Yeah, I have Team Giants,

01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:13.920
and I've added Blazing Skeleton also.

01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:14.920
And on the back, it says,

01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:19.920
my favorite movie is Ghost Rider.

01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:21.920
I started whistling the theme

01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:24.920
from Bridge over the River Kwai.

01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:30.920
Wait, you were singing when you whistled?

01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:31.920
Well, I don't know how to whistle.

01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:33.920
I can't whistle either.

01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:34.920
High five?

01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:35.920
Yeah.

01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:37.920
So few people don't know how to whistle.

01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:39.920
Anyone can whistle.

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:40.920
No.

01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:43.920
But that's a different story.

01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:45.920
So we're following these silent leaders.

01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:46.920
Silent, whatever.

01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:48.920
Yeah, yeah, the silent servants.

01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:50.920
They're just kind of...

01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:54.920
You really can't control this group.

01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:56.920
I can't really whistle.

01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:03.920
Whistling.

01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:06.920
That was a great try, Dan.

01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:08.920
Hey, it's us or hang out with your dad.

01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:09.920
You pick.

01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:16.920
Hey, man.

01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:18.920
I walk up to one of the silent servants

01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:20.920
and say, excuse me, gentlemen,

01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:22.920
we're looking for Jarl.

01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:23.920
You be so kind.

01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:25.920
You saw what I did to my friend over here.

01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:28.920
I threw him a good 50 meters down the ice road.

01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:29.920
See.

01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:30.920
Make it snappy and show us the way.

01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:31.920
No, no, no.

01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:32.920
Don't be aggressive.

01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:34.920
They respond to might here.

01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:36.920
It's head kind of turns towards you

01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:39.920
and its eyes kind of like glow with a blue flame

01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:41.920
and you can hear a voice out of its chest.

01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:43.920
It's tinny and mechanical sounding.

01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:47.920
It says, don't bother the silent servants.

01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:50.920
I was just told to come over to you.

01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:51.920
Well, they're walking.

01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:52.920
We just follow.

01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:53.920
We follow.

01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:54.920
Okay, we're following.

01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:55.920
Yeah, yeah.

01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:56.920
Sorry.

01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:57.920
That's happened.

01:43:57.920 --> 01:43:58.920
I was just trying to be tough.

01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:00.920
I want to get one of those chess plate things for me

01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:02.920
so that when I fart...

01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:06.920
It wasn't this person.

01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:08.920
Some people think you're chest farted.

01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:10.920
It's like blaming it on the dog.

01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:11.920
You know, you fart and then...

01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:13.920
Oh, so it was me.

01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:14.920
The chest plate.

01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:17.920
I thought when you fart, it just emits a louder mechanical fart

01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:18.920
to hide.

01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:19.920
I didn't think it through.

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:20.920
I just...

01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:23.920
The dots I was connecting were in this order.

01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:25.920
Silent but deadly.

01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:26.920
Silent.

01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:27.920
Silent servants.

01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:28.920
Silent servants.

01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:29.920
I kind of...

01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:31.920
And then from there I was off-roading.

01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:35.920
I was relying on the statistical chance of me being funny when I talked.

01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:39.920
And I blew it, as I do seven out of ten times.

01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:40.920
No.

01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:41.920
So we're following.

01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:43.920
There's a lot of math to it.

01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:44.920
Oh, yeah.

01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:45.920
It's impressive.

01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:48.920
Dan, have you been blaming it on the dog?

01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:49.920
We have a dog.

01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:50.920
And it farts a lot.

01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:51.920
Yeah.

01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:54.920
And I have ramped up my farting.

01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:55.920
It's true.

01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:56.920
You have.

01:44:56.920 --> 01:45:04.920
When Dan was getting his endoscopy, there was a page in the big stack of papers that

01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:07.920
he had assigned that said...

01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:10.920
When the camera goes down, it pushes a lot of air through you.

01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:13.920
So you make sure you release the air.

01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:14.920
Oh, pre-fart.

01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:15.920
Yeah.

01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:18.920
It was giving you permission to fart, like thing.

01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:20.920
This isn't either the time or the place.

01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:21.920
All right.

01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:23.920
So we're following the silent servant.

01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:24.920
Yeah, yeah.

01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:28.920
And they take you around through the city, and you're kind of going by these little snowed

01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:33.080
in little, like, huts that are weird because, you know, this is a giant city, and these

01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:34.920
huts wouldn't fit them.

01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:35.920
Anyway.

01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:36.920
But the skeletons are normal size, right?

01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:37.920
That's true.

01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:38.920
Do they have doors?

01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:39.920
They...

01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:43.320
You can't tell because they're just covered in snow past the door, like, up to their little

01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:44.320
roofs.

01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:45.320
Come on.

01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:46.320
I...

01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:47.320
I stop at one.

01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:48.320
Come on.

01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:49.320
Okay.

01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:50.320
I mean...

01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:51.320
I brush some snow away.

01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:52.320
I'm looking for a little door.

01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:53.320
It has a little door.

01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:59.320
I'm going to knock on the door with my Gandalf staff.

01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:01.320
There's no response.

01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:04.320
I'll be back later.

01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:05.320
Continuing on.

01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:06.320
You go...

01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:09.320
And you got balls, man.

01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:11.320
You know, that was a great, like...

01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:12.320
What is it called?

01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:13.320
Ding and ditch?

01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:14.320
What's it called?

01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:15.320
Yeah, ding-dong ditch.

01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:16.320
Yeah.

01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:17.320
Ding and ditch.

01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:18.320
We didn't do that in Pakistan.

01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:19.320
There's no dong.

01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:20.320
No.

01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:22.320
It's a ding and ditch.

01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:23.320
Ding!

01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:24.320
Run away.

01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:28.320
You have to be in an actual ditch.

01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:31.320
Do doorbells sound different in Pakistan?

01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:32.320
Uh...

01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:33.320
I...

01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:34.320
We...

01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:35.320
I don't know.

01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:36.320
No?

01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:37.320
The same?

01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:38.320
Okay.

01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:39.320
Yeah.

01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:40.320
I was just wondering.

01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:41.320
Yeah, they're not like...

01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:42.320
Because they're animals.

01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:43.320
They're not like...

01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:44.320
No.

01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:45.320
I mean sirens...

01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:46.320
Sirens sound...

01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:48.320
Sirens sound different in every country.

01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:50.320
They just say death to America when I...

01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:52.320
Death to America?

01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:53.320
Death to America?

01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:54.320
I guess they're not home.

01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:56.320
Oh, somebody's here.

01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:57.320
Alright, so we're following?

01:46:57.320 --> 01:46:58.320
Yeah, yeah.

01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:04.320
You go up a massive icy staircase and into a large kind of castle within the city made

01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:05.320
out of ice.

01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:09.320
It's all ice.

01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:13.320
You arrive in a massive room with a ceiling hundreds of feet tall.

01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:14.320
Uh...

01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:15.320
Hi.

01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:16.320
Whatever.

01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:21.640
Massive gold statues line the room and standing in the center of the statues is a massive

01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:24.640
blue giant, easily 30 feet tall.

01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:31.720
He wears a great magenta breastplate and wears a huge brown fur cloak off some oversized

01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:32.720
beast.

01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:35.320
His booming voice echoes through the icy chamber.

01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:39.320
I am Lim Dahl, the Jarl of Fordheim.

01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:42.320
Bow to my might!

01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:47.320
Uh, pretending to have met him previously, I scream out, so nice to see you again!

01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:49.320
Bow to his fucking might!

01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:50.320
Yeah.

01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:52.320
Maybe he'll think that we know each other.

01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:55.320
I bow to his might for sure.

01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:58.320
I say this as I am bowing to his might.

01:47:58.320 --> 01:47:59.320
Okay.

01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:02.320
I definitely blew the roadie.

01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:04.320
I bow to his might.

01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:05.320
Okay.

01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:06.320
I reluctantly bow.

01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:07.320
I can...

01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:09.320
Thank you.

01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:12.320
Might bow to...

01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:16.320
And for that, I thank you.

01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:19.320
Gratitude received.

01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:21.320
What brings you to Fordheim?

01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:24.320
The frozen city.

01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:30.320
It's like an OCD thing, but he has to say the entire thing.

01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:35.320
It's on their license plate frame, I don't know.

01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:39.320
We're looking for some Yalmars.

01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:40.320
Yalars.

01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:41.320
Wait, what?

01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:42.320
Yakars.

01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:43.320
Yalars?

01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:44.320
Jarl!

01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:45.320
He's the Jarl!

01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:46.320
Jarl is the king.

01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:47.320
Jarl means king.

01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:48.320
Jarl is king.

01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:51.320
As I'm following to my knees, I say, I'll never fall in love.

01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:53.320
My career is too important.

01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:57.320
She keeps dropping papers.

01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:58.320
What's on these...

01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:01.320
I pick up the papers and what the fuck is on these things?

01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:03.320
I read your papers.

01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:07.320
He says, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.

01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:09.320
Over and over.

01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:11.320
And we're terrified.

01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:13.320
I didn't really realize he was a Yaller.

01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:16.320
Oh, Jarl of Farnheim!

01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:17.320
Frozen city!

01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:18.320
Yaller?

01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:19.320
Jarl!

01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:20.320
Jarl!

01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:22.320
I know, I'm sorry.

01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:27.320
Gateway to the mountains.

01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:30.320
A great city by a great lake.

01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:35.320
The blue diamond of the north.

01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:40.320
Old Snowy.

01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:43.320
It is our grand pleasure.

01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:48.320
A pleasure exceeded in size only by your stature and might.

01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:53.320
That we arrive here in your slippery, sticky halls.

01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:56.320
In a good way, in a good way.

01:49:56.320 --> 01:50:01.320
I am overcome by your power and I fall down.

01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:04.320
I drop one paper.

01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:12.320
One would no more dare to offend thee than one would dare to stick one's tongue on a common surface.

01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:15.320
Have you seen Christmas story?

01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:17.320
I take out my sword and...

01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:19.320
No, bro!

01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:21.320
And I...

01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:25.320
Pardon me, but can I cleave my way through all the bullshit?

01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:28.320
Whoa!

01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:29.320
Oh boy.

01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:31.320
Fonzie's in town.

01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:34.320
And I put my sword back away with a whoop.

01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:35.320
He puts it away.

01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:36.320
Oh yeah, I took it out.

01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:38.320
I'm not going to walk around with it out.

01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:39.320
You just took it out.

01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:40.320
I took it out too.

01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:41.320
You're just trying to cut the recta.

01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:42.320
I was making a point.

01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:44.320
He regards your social maneuver.

01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:45.320
Great.

01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:47.320
Listen, Limdol, was it?

01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:48.320
Limdol.

01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:50.320
My name is Quark Pfft.

01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:51.320
Well met.

01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:56.320
My friends and I are, after a certain Admiral Darkstar, are you familiar with this gentleman?

01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:59.320
Oh, I'm familiar with this gentleman.

01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:01.320
Which you take?

01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:07.320
I'm not a fond of him.

01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:08.320
Yeah, yeah.

01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:10.320
But we're saying that he's the worst.

01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:12.320
You saw the air quotes around gentlemen, right?

01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:13.320
Yeah.

01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:14.320
Right, right.

01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:19.320
Well, we have one mission and one mission alone, and it's to take him down.

01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:25.320
We could certainly use a little assistance, because as you see, we're just four tiny little fuckers.

01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:27.320
You could use some assistance.

01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:28.320
I just said that.

01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:31.320
But you have something I could use.

01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:32.320
Oh, okay.

01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:33.320
Great.

01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:34.320
This is going to be great.

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:36.320
What's the expression on his face right now, Spencer?

01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:39.320
It's holding all the cards.

01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:41.320
It's an expression.

01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:42.320
Fair enough.

01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:44.320
What is it you want from us?

01:51:44.320 --> 01:51:49.320
Oh, just a few of your fragments of power.

01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:51.320
Oh, boy.

01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:53.320
Can we have a sidebar?

01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:58.320
Gentlemen, do you think he's talking about my business papers?

01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:00.320
I think we should definitely try.

01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:01.320
Okay.

01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:02.320
There was no business.

01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:04.320
One page was just a bunch of drawings of Dixon balls.

01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:12.320
Look, I'm going to be a magazine editor, executive business merger lady some day, and I've got to take all my ladies.

01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:13.320
Okay, stopping.

01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:15.320
Do you have shards of power, right?

01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:18.320
Are those like the amulet of autumn and stuff?

01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:21.320
No, these are stuff that you've collected.

01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:29.320
Guys, the shards of power, if Admiral Darkstar wants all of those, what if this guy is just lying to us and works for him?

01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:31.320
He's going to hand them all over to him.

01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:34.320
Should we ask him if there's something else that he would want instead?

01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:36.320
What do we get in return for these shards?

01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:38.320
Like, exactly.

01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:45.320
I will give you some of my finest horses, as well as a regiment of six frost giant warriors to aid you.

01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:46.320
For how many shards?

01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:48.320
For how many horses?

01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:49.320
I want all of them.

01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:52.320
You want all of their shards?

01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:55.320
All right, sorry, I've had a tough day.

01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:58.320
Sir, is there something else that you would take instead of shards?

01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:04.320
Most of the shards.

01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:08.320
I have goggles of night, do you want that?

01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:10.320
You take that instead of the shards?

01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:17.320
Can somebody who's got more wisdom than me sense motive on this guy?

01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:19.320
You fail to sense his motive.

01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:21.320
I ask somebody else to do it.

01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:25.320
Somebody else also fails.

01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:27.320
All right, I think we got to get my own dice.

01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:33.320
We got to put a bookmark here, because we're in the hall of the Frost Giant.

01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:36.320
Jarl Cliffhanger.

01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:37.320
Jarl Cliffhanger.

01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:39.320
All right, thank you, Kumail Nanjiani.

01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:41.320
Thank you, Erin McGathy.

01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:47.320
Thank you, Spencer, for your dungeon mastery.

01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:54.320
Please, on Saturday, come to the Silent Movie Theater.

01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:55.320
Google it.

01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:58.320
Harmon Quest is called in cooperation with Cine Family.

01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:00.320
Come to the thing.

01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:02.320
All right, it's showtime.

01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:06.320
You want to say a nice little lesson learned?

01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:07.320
What have we learned?

01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:09.320
Gay people should be allowed to be gay.

01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:15.320
If you fuck around with that, Satanists will turn your dead grandma's gay.

01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:18.320
Some Black Panthers are Irish.

01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:27.320
Black Panthers should not be exiled to Tanzania, because that guy could have been doing a lot of good here.

01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:31.320
Instead, he's got an orphanage over there.

01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:36.320
It's possible to have a thing called Jeep Butt.

01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:39.320
All together, a wonderful...

01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:41.320
Oh, and San Diego can go fuck itself.

01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:43.320
Yeah, I guess.

01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:44.320
Downtown mostly.

01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:46.320
But mostly what I think I've learned is that we love you as always.

01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:48.320
Thank you for coming to Harmontown.

01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:49.320
Have a good night.

01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:52.320
We'll see you.

01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:53.320
Run music!

01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:54.320
Run music!

01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:55.320
Run music!

01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:56.320
Keep clapping!

01:54:56.320 --> 01:54:57.320
There we are.

01:54:57.320 --> 01:55:00.320
Oh, my God.

01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:01.320
Thank you so much.

01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:06.320
Anna Tolle and Auntie Adam Goldberg for Bone Viage.

01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:07.320
That's what we should have said.

01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:10.320
We should have just ended with Bone Viage.

01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:11.320
Bone Viage.

01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:13.320
Bone Viage, one and all.

01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:34.320
Run music!
