{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:18.880\nHello, one and all. Welcome to NerdMelt Theatre at Meltdown Commons in Hollywood, California.\n\n00:18.880 --> 00:36.880\nHarmontown is now in session. Won't you please join me in welcoming to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:36.880 --> 00:49.880\nThank you. So much to do because we took a week off last week and thank you all for coming. I know you had so many comic books to go through because you were all at Comic-Con.\n\n00:49.880 --> 01:00.880\nThat's why we all go there now for the comic books, right? It's not Sundance or anything. It's a comic book convention.\n\n01:00.880 --> 01:17.880\nI mean, we could talk about Comic-Con, we could talk about my upper-end desk copy, which I survived and had a budistic existential experience during, because I got it rough.\n\n01:17.880 --> 01:33.880\nBoy, what a surgical procedure I went through. But we could talk about all that, but the truth is it's 8.10 and our first guest has to 10-bar downtown at 8.30. He's got to leave.\n\n01:33.880 --> 01:45.880\nI want you to welcome one of our wonderful feral audio podcast brothers, a pioneer of the podcasting medium, in fact. I think he was doing it before everyone had a podcast.\n\n01:45.880 --> 01:48.880\nJeff, you're a Studs Turkle fan, aren't you?\n\n01:48.880 --> 01:51.880\nTotally.\n\n01:51.880 --> 01:53.880\nI really thought you would be. You're like an artist.\n\n01:53.880 --> 01:55.880\nI know very little about Studs.\n\n01:55.880 --> 01:58.880\nI'm a fan of his name more than anything.\n\n01:58.880 --> 02:07.880\nWell, this guy in some respects is kind of the anti-Dan Harmon because he has very meaningful conversations in good interviews with very interesting people.\n\n02:07.880 --> 02:19.880\nAnd all I do is do bad interviews with people from feral audio. Please welcome Matt Dwyer.\n\n02:19.880 --> 02:25.880\nIf you want to drink, I could have someone make you one.\n\n02:25.880 --> 02:30.880\nOh, no. I don't want to work yet. So just if somebody else could bartend for me right now.\n\n02:30.880 --> 02:32.880\nYour podcast is called Conversations with Matt Dwyer.\n\n02:32.880 --> 02:34.880\nYeah, very narcissistic of me.\n\n02:34.880 --> 02:38.880\nI'm proud to be a label mate of yours because I listened to a little bit of it today.\n\n02:38.880 --> 02:46.880\nYou're one of those guys that I kind of, I guess I wish I was like, but I know I never could be.\n\n02:46.880 --> 02:49.880\nI don't even want to be like Matt.\n\n02:49.880 --> 02:51.880\nYou're a listener and not a talker.\n\n02:51.880 --> 03:00.880\nI mean, you're somebody that actually is, as our friend Seek Donnelly who came out here, who's an aneurysm survivor and therefore a shamanic representative.\n\n03:00.880 --> 03:06.880\nI said, what do we have to do, those of us in the land of certainty?\n\n03:06.880 --> 03:08.880\nAnd he said, give more than you take.\n\n03:08.880 --> 03:14.880\nAnd I think guys like you give a little more than you take because you book really provocative guests and have really interesting conversations.\n\n03:14.880 --> 03:19.880\nAnd all I do is stand up here and go, I had an endoscopy.\n\n03:19.880 --> 03:24.880\nYeah, well, when I started the show, I was hoping I would be really funny while talking to interesting people.\n\n03:24.880 --> 03:31.880\nBut when you're talking to like a Black Panther or Wayne Kramer talking about his prison stint, it's really hard to make jokes.\n\n03:31.880 --> 03:37.880\nSo you don't have to because that Black Panther dude, for instance, I was riveted.\n\n03:37.880 --> 03:45.880\nI had to do, I'm trying to write the first episode of Community right now, but I got you cranked up like I'm Terry Gross doing my research.\n\n03:45.880 --> 03:49.880\nI didn't want to embarrass myself. You're an adult coming in.\n\n03:49.880 --> 03:51.880\nI didn't want to be like, so what's your podcast about?\n\n03:51.880 --> 03:53.880\nI wanted to know.\n\n03:53.880 --> 03:55.880\nStan, what is his podcast about?\n\n03:55.880 --> 03:57.880\nIt's about this Black Panther guy.\n\n03:57.880 --> 04:01.880\n362 episodes with one Black Panther guy.\n\n04:01.880 --> 04:06.880\nWe go each crime to each food because they did a lot of soup kitchen stuff.\n\n04:06.880 --> 04:09.880\nWe talk about each soup extensively.\n\n04:09.880 --> 04:11.880\nWhat was that guy's name? Pat O'Neill?\n\n04:11.880 --> 04:12.880\nPito Neill.\n\n04:12.880 --> 04:13.880\nPito Neill.\n\n04:13.880 --> 04:15.880\nYeah, he was a little less Irish than...\n\n04:15.880 --> 04:18.880\nReally weird, though. He does have a broke.\n\n04:18.880 --> 04:20.880\nBlack Panther from Kansas City with a broke.\n\n04:20.880 --> 04:21.880\nWhy?\n\n04:21.880 --> 04:25.880\nWhy can't we get over this class system that's oppressing the African-American?\n\n04:25.880 --> 04:29.880\nWe've got to fight the power to be...\n\n04:29.880 --> 04:31.880\nPower to the people, motherfuckers.\n\n04:31.880 --> 04:35.880\nSomeone's trying to take me horseshoe-shaped civil rights.\n\n04:35.880 --> 04:39.880\nVery funny. Three white guys doing this.\n\n04:39.880 --> 04:43.880\nBut one thing that he said that...\n\n04:43.880 --> 04:47.880\nHe said something so, well, I don't know if it was profound or if it was just sort of like narcissistic.\n\n04:47.880 --> 04:51.880\nI'm like, that's what I'm always saying in a Black Panther saying it.\n\n04:51.880 --> 04:55.880\nBecause he said...\n\n04:55.880 --> 04:57.880\nBy the way, just a quick backstory.\n\n04:57.880 --> 05:01.880\nThis guy was basically trumped up charges sometime in the 60s and has been in Tanzania ever since.\n\n05:01.880 --> 05:05.880\nYeah, but before he became a Black Panther, he was like a street hood.\n\n05:05.880 --> 05:09.880\nHe was a pimp, I believe, which he doesn't even like to talk about.\n\n05:09.880 --> 05:11.880\nAnd then the Black Panthers changed his life.\n\n05:11.880 --> 05:19.880\nHis charges were trumped up, but he does admit that he did smuggle some guns in his time.\n\n05:19.880 --> 05:21.880\nSo he had done some pretty crazy things.\n\n05:21.880 --> 05:25.880\nAnd he talks about how the Black Panthers...\n\n05:25.880 --> 05:29.880\nThe thing that he said that really perked my ears up was when he was talking about how...\n\n05:29.880 --> 05:35.880\nThe first thing they tried to do to neutralize the Black Panthers propaganda-wise was to call them a racist organization.\n\n05:35.880 --> 05:41.880\nAnd he said, racist organization, all we were preaching from the beginning was about class systems.\n\n05:41.880 --> 05:43.880\nAnd I was like, yes, this is exactly what I'm talking about.\n\n05:43.880 --> 05:45.880\nRace is an artificial construct.\n\n05:45.880 --> 05:47.880\nI'm always saying...\n\n05:47.880 --> 05:49.880\nYou don't have to read a fucking book to figure this out.\n\n05:49.880 --> 05:51.880\nYou do not have to...\n\n05:51.880 --> 05:55.880\nI mean, it's great if smart people do smart work to try to figure this out, but it's right under everyone's nose.\n\n05:55.880 --> 05:57.880\nChildren do not...\n\n05:57.880 --> 05:59.880\nChildren don't understand what race is.\n\n05:59.880 --> 06:01.880\nYou get taught this stuff.\n\n06:01.880 --> 06:03.880\nThis is about poor people and rich people.\n\n06:03.880 --> 06:05.880\nRace is a Black organization.\n\n06:05.880 --> 06:07.880\nYour primary thrust is going to be on what the Black community can do.\n\n06:07.880 --> 06:13.880\nAs you would expect poor white people to have a primary thrust maybe on what poor white people could do.\n\n06:13.880 --> 06:15.880\nI'm putting words in his mouth at this point.\n\n06:15.880 --> 06:19.880\nAnd then he said, we should all eat more bacon?\n\n06:19.880 --> 06:21.880\nNow I'm just trying to get back on Akins.\n\n06:21.880 --> 06:23.880\nBlack Panthers said it.\n\n06:23.880 --> 06:25.880\nBut it's always about class.\n\n06:25.880 --> 06:27.880\nIt's always been about class.\n\n06:27.880 --> 06:33.880\nIt was so interesting that he could have the calm state of mind having been basically exiled to Tanzania,\n\n06:33.880 --> 06:39.880\nwhere he's running an orphanage, that he was so cool and objective about the global state of affairs.\n\n06:39.880 --> 06:41.880\nYeah, but he didn't...\n\n06:41.880 --> 06:45.880\nWe've talked besides the podcast too, and he said it took him a long time to get there.\n\n06:45.880 --> 06:51.880\nBecause I guess there was times in Tanzania where he'd like chase some dudes down the street with a knife and stuff.\n\n06:51.880 --> 06:55.880\nHe used to be a little temperamental, but now he's like 77.\n\n06:55.880 --> 06:57.880\nHe's getting a little tuckered out.\n\n06:57.880 --> 07:01.880\nYeah, but he's still like this big, strong motherfucker.\n\n07:01.880 --> 07:03.880\nYou wouldn't want to screw with him even at 77.\n\n07:03.880 --> 07:05.880\nHe's a badass.\n\n07:05.880 --> 07:11.880\nYou also, on that list of your legitimate interviewings, before we get to the thing that I think I really want to plug,\n\n07:11.880 --> 07:13.880\nbecause it drops I think Monday.\n\n07:13.880 --> 07:15.880\nAre we dropping it Monday?\n\n07:15.880 --> 07:17.880\nCan you give it?\n\n07:17.880 --> 07:19.880\nBut that Monsanto guy, that was another big one.\n\n07:19.880 --> 07:23.880\nA lot of Monsanto fans here tonight.\n\n07:23.880 --> 07:27.880\nI didn't know if that was going to be somebody booing Monsanto.\n\n07:27.880 --> 07:31.880\nNo, they love bioengineered fruit.\n\n07:31.880 --> 07:35.880\nThis is Los Angeles, nothing grows here unless it's part giraffe.\n\n07:35.880 --> 07:37.880\nIt's more comic books sounding to have bioengineered fruit.\n\n07:37.880 --> 07:39.880\nYeah, these guys are nerds. They love sci-fi.\n\n07:39.880 --> 07:43.880\nOf course they want their oranges to glow in the dark.\n\n07:43.880 --> 07:47.880\nBut you had this guy, he wasn't specifically a Monsanto employee.\n\n07:47.880 --> 07:53.880\nHe worked for the main research company that worked for Monsanto.\n\n07:53.880 --> 07:59.880\nIt sounds kind of bullshitty when you're like, he couldn't say his name because it sounds like you're just being weird,\n\n07:59.880 --> 08:03.880\nbut he couldn't because they'd come after him and if you've ever seen any documentaries,\n\n08:03.880 --> 08:05.880\nMonsanto likes to fuck people in the ass.\n\n08:05.880 --> 08:11.880\nAnd he couldn't, you know, he would get sued to high fucking heaven.\n\n08:11.880 --> 08:15.880\nBut the greatest thing about that interview is there's a really poignant moment he and I were having\n\n08:15.880 --> 08:19.880\nand he couldn't see this, but behind him, his dog was taking a shit.\n\n08:19.880 --> 08:25.880\nAnd it was like one of the, and the dog was just chasing its own stringy shit behind him.\n\n08:25.880 --> 08:29.880\nAnd I was like, why don't I videotape this show?\n\n08:29.880 --> 08:31.880\nWhy don't you blow the whistle on that?\n\n08:31.880 --> 08:37.880\nTalking about Agent Orange and the glow in the dark pineapples.\n\n08:37.880 --> 08:43.880\nWhat do you do when you, like, were you invested at all in that topic,\n\n08:43.880 --> 08:51.880\nthat area of politics before you found out you were going to get to sit down with a Monsanto whistleblower?\n\n08:51.880 --> 08:56.880\nI mean, I'm pretty fucking way to the left.\n\n08:56.880 --> 08:59.880\nLike, I might make Chomsky look conservative.\n\n08:59.880 --> 09:03.880\nBut yeah, I'm always interested in political things.\n\n09:03.880 --> 09:07.880\nI mean, when I started doing the show, I was hoping to just talk to anybody because I feel like most people have\n\n09:07.880 --> 09:14.880\ninteresting stories, but then I'm a weirdo, so I started going after, like, you know, Black Panthers and political radicals.\n\n09:14.880 --> 09:16.880\nBut how do you go after them?\n\n09:16.880 --> 09:21.880\nWell, the Black Panther explained how you go after them in the 60s.\n\n09:21.880 --> 09:27.880\nIt's amazing who you can find on Facebook.\n\n09:27.880 --> 09:33.880\nI found Pete on Facebook, and yeah, I just, and then you start, once you start talking to a bunch of weirdos,\n\n09:33.880 --> 09:37.880\nthese weirdos go, hey, I got some more weirdos you can talk to.\n\n09:37.880 --> 09:41.880\nAnd a guy I've interviewed twice, Shane Bugby, and I grew up together.\n\n09:41.880 --> 09:46.880\nAnd Shane in high school was, like, publishing G.G. Allen, John Wayne Gacy.\n\n09:46.880 --> 09:51.880\nIt was like, fresh out of high school, he was Gacy's art dealer.\n\n09:51.880 --> 09:57.880\nLike an art dealer, like a guy who dealt art to John Wayne Gacy.\n\n09:57.880 --> 10:02.880\nBy the way, nobody booed. Monsanto got a boo.\n\n10:02.880 --> 10:06.880\nWhat has Monsanto done for any birthday party?\n\n10:06.880 --> 10:08.880\nTrue.\n\n10:12.880 --> 10:14.880\nBut Shane has worked with this.\n\n10:14.880 --> 10:19.880\nDoes someone say Joe Rogan's joke? Or is that some weird mental projection?\n\n10:19.880 --> 10:20.880\nI think so.\n\n10:20.880 --> 10:23.880\nI thought I heard the words, Joe Rogan's joke?\n\n10:23.880 --> 10:26.880\nJim Gavigan's joke? That's all.\n\n10:26.880 --> 10:28.880\nI'm not a stand-up.\n\n10:28.880 --> 10:32.880\nI'm sorry if my John Wayne Gacy joke was on someone else's set list.\n\n10:32.880 --> 10:34.880\nAnyways, please continue.\n\n10:34.880 --> 10:38.880\nOh, just Shane is, and you should listen to his episodes and Google Shane Bugby,\n\n10:38.880 --> 10:42.880\nbecause he's a guy who's done incredibly crazy things.\n\n10:42.880 --> 10:48.880\nAnd, like, G.G. Allen, he stole Ed Gein's tombstone and toured it around the country.\n\n10:48.880 --> 10:51.880\nAnd then he started his own soda pop company.\n\n10:51.880 --> 10:54.880\nHe's just some guy who does weird things like that.\n\n10:54.880 --> 10:57.880\nBut he's hooked me up with a lot of these people, like Paul Krasner.\n\n10:57.880 --> 11:00.880\nHe hooked me up with Paul Krasner, if you don't know who Paul Krasner is.\n\n11:00.880 --> 11:04.880\nOh, Paul Krasner.\n\n11:04.880 --> 11:10.880\nPaul Krasner created The Realist, which was like this really heavy-duty satirical magazine in the 60s.\n\n11:10.880 --> 11:15.880\nAnd the greatest thing about Paul Krasner is he tripped on acid with Groucho Marx.\n\n11:15.880 --> 11:17.880\nAnd he tells the story on my show.\n\n11:17.880 --> 11:22.880\nSo he really saw Time Fly Like an Arrow and Fruit Fly Like a Banana.\n\n11:22.880 --> 11:25.880\nThat actually happened.\n\n11:25.880 --> 11:29.880\nAnd Shane's the one who hooked me up with Lucy and Graves.\n\n11:29.880 --> 11:32.880\nLucy and Graves. That's the next thing to talk to you about.\n\n11:32.880 --> 11:36.880\nOkay, so you can take over any time you want.\n\n11:36.880 --> 11:38.880\nI just want to see if I can get this right.\n\n11:38.880 --> 11:40.880\nIs it Woodsboro? Is that the name of this?\n\n11:40.880 --> 11:42.880\nThe Westboro Baptist Church.\n\n11:42.880 --> 11:44.880\nThose are the God Hates Fags people.\n\n11:44.880 --> 11:46.880\nGod Hates Fags.\n\n11:46.880 --> 11:48.880\nJoe Rogan Strip.\n\n11:48.880 --> 11:50.880\nWestboro Baptist.\n\n11:50.880 --> 11:55.880\nThey are more easily known as the God Hates Fags people. They hold a sign that says God Hates Fags\n\n11:55.880 --> 11:58.880\nanywhere where they think anyone will be watching.\n\n11:58.880 --> 12:06.880\nLike, for instance, as they threatened, they were going to do it at the funeral for the Boston Marathon victims.\n\n12:06.880 --> 12:12.880\nThey implied, I guess, it was implied that they were going to, yep, we're going to do it there too.\n\n12:12.880 --> 12:14.880\nWe do it everywhere where the heat is.\n\n12:14.880 --> 12:21.880\nBecause when a message is that important, you've got to get your billboard up at the corner of Fountain in Wilshire.\n\n12:21.880 --> 12:27.880\nSo the head of their church, Phelps.\n\n12:27.880 --> 12:29.880\nFred Phelps.\n\n12:29.880 --> 12:31.880\nHe has a dead grandmother.\n\n12:31.880 --> 12:33.880\nI think it was his mother.\n\n12:33.880 --> 12:37.880\nSo this organization called the Satanic Temple.\n\n12:37.880 --> 12:38.880\nYeah.\n\n12:38.880 --> 12:43.880\nThey did what they called a pink mass on the grave of his grandmother.\n\n12:43.880 --> 12:47.880\nGetting her gay in the afterlife.\n\n12:47.880 --> 12:51.880\nThey did a Satanic gay ritual.\n\n12:51.880 --> 12:56.880\nSo Fred Phelps' mom is getting hit with a strap-on as we speak.\n\n12:56.880 --> 12:59.880\nAnd it really blows your mind. I went down a rabbit hole today.\n\n12:59.880 --> 13:01.880\nI was like, okay, who are these Satanist guys?\n\n13:01.880 --> 13:04.880\nAnd I mean, I went to their site.\n\n13:04.880 --> 13:10.880\nI mean, their name is the setup and the punchline is the fact that they're good people.\n\n13:10.880 --> 13:16.880\nI mean, as far as their tenets go, they have nine tenets on their front page of their site.\n\n13:16.880 --> 13:21.880\nFollow your compassion. Be good to other humans.\n\n13:21.880 --> 13:23.880\nNever push your beliefs on anyone else.\n\n13:23.880 --> 13:25.880\nLet people do whatever they want.\n\n13:25.880 --> 13:26.880\nAlways keep an open mind.\n\n13:26.880 --> 13:30.880\nNothing to do with Satan or eating a chicken heart or anything.\n\n13:30.880 --> 13:33.880\nYeah, they don't do anything. That's the weird misconception.\n\n13:33.880 --> 13:36.880\nAnd we talk about the misconceptions of Satanism.\n\n13:36.880 --> 13:44.880\nAnd we also talk about how this pink mass, which the media treated as something that's been going on for hundreds of years.\n\n13:44.880 --> 13:48.880\nI should be clear because I'm a bad interviewer.\n\n13:48.880 --> 13:53.880\nThis drops on Monday on your podcast, Conversations with Matt Dwyer.\n\n13:53.880 --> 13:58.880\nYou got to have a conversation with Lucian Greaves, the head of the Satanic temple.\n\n13:58.880 --> 14:05.880\nAnd I rarely get to brag about anything in my life, but he turned down a bunch of people, including Maren, to do my show.\n\n14:05.880 --> 14:08.880\nSo that's...\n\n14:08.880 --> 14:13.880\nTake that, Marc Maron, and all your money.\n\n14:13.880 --> 14:19.880\nMarc Maron, can you book us on your show?\n\n14:19.880 --> 14:23.880\nAnd there is going to be, because there is something, and I wish I could say what it is, but I can't.\n\n14:23.880 --> 14:32.880\nThere's going to be a big twist in this whole Lucian Greaves thing, which Shane Bubby, who I talked about, is going to bust on...\n\n14:32.880 --> 14:39.880\nBust? Is going to break in Vice Magazine, and then I'm going to do a follow-up interview with Lucian as well.\n\n14:39.880 --> 14:43.880\nWow, it's like NBC's StarCross Thursdays back in the old days.\n\n14:43.880 --> 14:51.880\nMatt Damon is going to be in Central Perk, but then also Daphne is going to be on MASH, I don't know.\n\n14:51.880 --> 14:54.880\nI haven't watched TV in a long time.\n\n14:54.880 --> 14:57.880\nIt's good that New Media is getting there, too.\n\n14:57.880 --> 15:00.880\nSo how did that interview go? What's he like? What's his fellow like?\n\n15:00.880 --> 15:03.880\nHe's like the nicest guy in the world, and he's super smart.\n\n15:03.880 --> 15:12.880\nIt's not surprising. On its face, it seems like a very juvenile, like, fuck you thing to do, to do anything on someone's grave.\n\n15:12.880 --> 15:17.880\nBut then you peel back the layers, and you peel back the layers, and you're going like...\n\n15:17.880 --> 15:28.880\nI actually cut and pasted a comment from an argument about it on Facebook that I thought justified the existence of comment sections,\n\n15:28.880 --> 15:34.880\nbecause it's like somebody said about this, because he did this pink mass on the grave of a dead woman,\n\n15:34.880 --> 15:38.880\nmaking this guy's loved one gay in the afterlife.\n\n15:38.880 --> 15:45.880\nBut these are the people who, I mean, their whole belief system is about freedom of religion.\n\n15:45.880 --> 15:54.880\nNot to put too fine a point on it, they hide behind the concept of freedom of religion in order to do something that is not really religious,\n\n15:54.880 --> 16:01.880\nand it's certainly unconstitutional, which is to imply that other people don't have the freedom to do whatever the fuck they want.\n\n16:01.880 --> 16:09.880\nAnd so this is sort of like, turnabout is fair play, and it's kind of funny to have two chicks make out on this lady's grave,\n\n16:09.880 --> 16:18.880\nand I'll say, I'd like to go where the sense of humor seems to be, but somebody said, in a comment section,\n\n16:18.880 --> 16:25.880\nof course, someone said, two wrongs don't make a right, okay, that's the response to what he did.\n\n16:25.880 --> 16:31.880\nAnd then this fella, Corey Hammond, I'll name him, I don't care.\n\n16:31.880 --> 16:36.880\nHe said, and overused cliche statements don't make you intelligent.\n\n16:36.880 --> 16:39.880\nThe Westboro Baptist Church has always been lawful.\n\n16:39.880 --> 16:46.880\nHalf of his kids are First Amendment lawyers, and go to court daily to fight their actions, and they always win.\n\n16:46.880 --> 16:49.880\nThe best way to beat them is at their own game, and this is it.\n\n16:49.880 --> 16:54.880\nIf you aren't explicit enough to do it, the WBC is, so be explicit enough.\n\n16:54.880 --> 17:01.880\nIn other words, I don't know, then you go, okay, so we're just getting in a knife fight with people who love knives, and where's that going to go?\n\n17:01.880 --> 17:10.880\nBut it's certainly, you know, it makes you go like, yeah, these guys are calling themselves Satanists and making themselves heroes,\n\n17:10.880 --> 17:13.880\nand it's kind of a wonderful, ticklish thing.\n\n17:13.880 --> 17:19.880\nAnd he's got prosecutors coming after him, and there was a great quote at the end of an article about him recently where he said,\n\n17:19.880 --> 17:26.880\nif I go to prison, I'm going to use my powers of Satan to turn it into one big gay orgy.\n\n17:26.880 --> 17:31.880\nTalk about light work. I mean, that is not a tough road to hoe.\n\n17:31.880 --> 17:34.880\nYou're halfway home already.\n\n17:34.880 --> 17:46.880\nSo, I don't know, how does a guy like me be a guy like you? Do you read more than me? Are you just more interested in other people than yourself?\n\n17:46.880 --> 17:49.880\nDo you drink more, drink less?\n\n17:49.880 --> 17:57.880\nOh, no, I drink often during my interviews. Maybe that's not the key, but I just realized early on,\n\n17:57.880 --> 18:06.880\nbecause I probably, in some of my first interviews, I'm trying to be like Johnny Gleb, like, whack-a-woo! And then I was just like, this isn't about you.\n\n18:06.880 --> 18:12.880\nLike, I just quickly realized, it's like, these people are, I'm talking to people who are far more intelligent than I'll ever be,\n\n18:12.880 --> 18:17.880\nand far more fucking interesting, so shut the fuck up and learn something.\n\n18:17.880 --> 18:19.880\nI can't break that barrier! How do you get there?\n\n18:19.880 --> 18:21.880\nWell, you're smarter than me, so maybe that's different.\n\n18:21.880 --> 18:23.880\nYeah, that's not true.\n\n18:23.880 --> 18:28.880\nBut it's like, I interviewed this guy, Dan Kovallak, who sued Coca-Cola for paramil-\n\n18:28.880 --> 18:30.880\nMy name's Dan!\n\n18:34.880 --> 18:36.880\nThat's all I thought! Well, you said that.\n\n18:36.880 --> 18:38.880\nPlease continue.\n\n18:38.880 --> 18:43.880\nOh, no, he's a lawyer who sued Coca-Cola for death squads in-\n\n18:43.880 --> 18:53.880\nDoug Stan, Hope's Joke! Coca-Cola was killing union organizers in Columbia, and he found a loophole in our government, or our laws, to sue Coke.\n\n18:53.880 --> 18:59.880\nAnd it's like, there's a documentary about it, actually, and we don't talk about it much, but like, I'm like, what am I going to fucking joke around,\n\n18:59.880 --> 19:01.880\nor I'll talk this guy about it?\n\n19:01.880 --> 19:02.880\nIt's like, this guy's a super-\n\n19:02.880 --> 19:08.880\nBut how do you ask, what do you ask? I mean, how do you, you have to engage them and get them to the places where you want them to say stuff,\n\n19:08.880 --> 19:14.880\nso you have to know all kinds of stuff, and then, I'm such a bad interviewer, it's the running joke.\n\n19:14.880 --> 19:21.880\nYeah, I mean, I guess maybe part of it is I came from an improv background, because I don't have a lot of notes,\n\n19:21.880 --> 19:27.880\nwhen I have maybe five things written down, and I'll just, if something, usually somebody will say something that piques my interest,\n\n19:27.880 --> 19:32.880\nand I'll wait for them to finish, and hopefully I can just be like, how about that?\n\n19:32.880 --> 19:34.880\nDo you take notes while they're talking?\n\n19:34.880 --> 19:36.880\nMental notes.\n\n19:36.880 --> 19:42.880\nLike, I interviewed this guy just a couple of days ago, who's an amazing artist, Rod Lough, or Rodrigo Lough,\n\n19:42.880 --> 19:47.880\nbut look up his work, but he said something about how sometimes he'll create something, and he'll find it embarrassing,\n\n19:47.880 --> 19:53.880\nand then he talked for a bit, and then I was like, alright, why would somebody be embarrassed about, like, this brilliant artist,\n\n19:53.880 --> 19:55.880\nwho's actually here, by the way.\n\n19:55.880 --> 20:03.880\nWhy would this guy, who's incredibly brilliant, be embarrassed by something he creates,\n\n20:03.880 --> 20:08.880\nand so I wanted to, and comes down to, we're all just fucking insecure and weird.\n\n20:08.880 --> 20:14.880\nYeah, we're all ashamed of ourselves, deep down, and I'm sorry, I've been through several PR experiences lately,\n\n20:14.880 --> 20:22.880\nwhere I've suddenly realized, okay, we're all ashamed of ourselves, and from now on, instead of trying to get everyone to like me,\n\n20:22.880 --> 20:29.880\nbecause I'm ashamed of myself, I'm only going to care about the people who don't make their shame other people's problems.\n\n20:29.880 --> 20:34.880\nLike, I think that I'm just going to bother to say that there's shitty people in the world.\n\n20:34.880 --> 20:40.880\nI'm not going to keep preaching this thing, where I'm like, I love everybody, fuck half of the people.\n\n20:40.880 --> 20:45.880\nSpecifically the half of the people that make their very human shame someone else's problem,\n\n20:45.880 --> 20:52.880\nsomeone that says like, I'm ashamed of myself, so shut up over there, stop talking, don't say that, everybody be quiet, everybody be careful,\n\n20:52.880 --> 20:58.880\nbecause I have to be, because I have some weird fucking thing about me, or I don't know how to talk,\n\n20:58.880 --> 21:05.880\nlike fuck those people. I'm sure they're not evil, but you got to have an enemy, I guess, according to them.\n\n21:05.880 --> 21:06.880\nYeah.\n\n21:06.880 --> 21:07.880\nI mean, it's...\n\n21:07.880 --> 21:08.880\nJohn DeLewis' joke!\n\n21:08.880 --> 21:15.880\nIt's interesting, because I can safely say I've spoken with some people who are legitimately creative geniuses,\n\n21:15.880 --> 21:16.880\nand they all have...\n\n21:16.880 --> 21:17.880\nThank you.\n\n21:19.880 --> 21:21.880\nI was just about comma Dan Harmon.\n\n21:21.880 --> 21:27.880\nBut yeah, none of them really fully go, yeah, I got this.\n\n21:27.880 --> 21:30.880\nYeah, I mean, well, yeah, you can't...\n\n21:30.880 --> 21:31.880\nYou can't, I think.\n\n21:31.880 --> 21:34.880\nNot unhelp people, not be effective at all.\n\n21:34.880 --> 21:35.880\nYeah.\n\n21:35.880 --> 21:42.880\nLike you have to be fucking terrified in order to be someone effective, I would think.\n\n21:42.880 --> 21:43.880\nOtherwise, what do you...\n\n21:43.880 --> 21:45.880\nYeah, you'd be some weirdo.\n\n21:45.880 --> 21:46.880\nYou have to have a little...\n\n21:46.880 --> 21:53.880\nI don't know if this is the Irish working class bullshit in me, but I think you can't really be good at anything unless you kind of hate yourself just a little.\n\n21:53.880 --> 21:54.880\nYeah.\n\n21:54.880 --> 21:59.880\nI mean, that's what I love about myself, is how much I hate myself.\n\n21:59.880 --> 22:01.880\nI hate how much I love you.\n\n22:01.880 --> 22:06.880\nAll right, you're a better interviewer than me. Ask me something provocative, and...\n\n22:06.880 --> 22:09.880\nSee what dad did just there?\n\n22:09.880 --> 22:16.880\nHe created a construct where he would have someone ask things about him.\n\n22:16.880 --> 22:19.880\nI'm looking for a closer. I'm not going to generate it, because I'm not him.\n\n22:19.880 --> 22:21.880\nYeah, but you could have had him interview somebody in the audience.\n\n22:21.880 --> 22:23.880\nOh, okay, good idea, Jeff.\n\n22:23.880 --> 22:26.880\nVery smart. Jeff Sober tonight, he's on a cleanse.\n\n22:31.880 --> 22:33.880\nI've been sober for like the last ten shows.\n\n22:33.880 --> 22:39.880\nI ate four steaks today.\n\n22:39.880 --> 22:43.880\nHey, N.T., will you have a conversation with Matt Dwyer?\n\n22:43.880 --> 22:49.880\nThis is N.T.\n\n22:49.880 --> 22:51.880\nOh, shit balls.\n\n22:51.880 --> 22:54.880\nI only had a little bit of vodka, and I'm falling off the goddamn chair.\n\n22:54.880 --> 23:00.880\nN.T. is irregular here, but okay, just dive in.\n\n23:00.880 --> 23:04.880\nI don't, without knowing anything about what you do, what do you do?\n\n23:04.880 --> 23:08.880\nRight fucking getting deep.\n\n23:08.880 --> 23:10.880\nI mean, are you a creative sort or what?\n\n23:10.880 --> 23:17.880\nWell, yeah, I want to do writing and stuff, but I recently was let go of a job that I had.\n\n23:17.880 --> 23:19.880\nWhat was the job?\n\n23:19.880 --> 23:21.880\nBlack Panther.\n\n23:21.880 --> 23:24.880\nHe was an Irish Black Panther.\n\n23:24.880 --> 23:27.880\nTrumped up charges.\n\n23:27.880 --> 23:33.880\nI worked like in social media, and I did like movie marketing stuff.\n\n23:33.880 --> 23:36.880\nThat's just called tweeting that you liked Iron Man 3.\n\n23:36.880 --> 23:40.880\nThat's not, that never paid anything.\n\n23:40.880 --> 23:45.880\nSo are you taking that as like, alright, I can fuck this, I'm just going to dedicate my life to writing?\n\n23:45.880 --> 23:48.880\nOh, no, I wanted to do writing before that.\n\n23:48.880 --> 23:52.880\nNo, I know, but taking the job is like losing your job is maybe like a sign of...\n\n23:52.880 --> 23:55.880\nYeah, like maybe it was time that it needed to happen.\n\n23:55.880 --> 24:00.880\nBecause I kind of wasn't happy there, so I was like, okay.\n\n24:00.880 --> 24:03.880\nSee, Dan, you guys, I'm going to hit pause instead of you.\n\n24:03.880 --> 24:06.880\nYou're not watching because you're making yourself another cocktail over there.\n\n24:06.880 --> 24:11.880\nBut I've just noticed a trick, a little trick that you can employ when you interview people.\n\n24:11.880 --> 24:13.880\nHe's looking right at him.\n\n24:13.880 --> 24:17.880\nIt's very uncomfortable for people with my condition.\n\n24:17.880 --> 24:21.880\nOkay, sorry, play.\n\n24:21.880 --> 24:24.880\nWhat kind of writing are you going to do?\n\n24:24.880 --> 24:26.880\nScreenwriting.\n\n24:26.880 --> 24:29.880\nShe just said sitcom writing.\n\n24:29.880 --> 24:31.880\nWell, I actually...\n\n24:31.880 --> 24:34.880\nHe's doing the long con.\n\n24:34.880 --> 24:36.880\nIt's going to take a couple years.\n\n24:36.880 --> 24:42.880\nAnd he's better than Anatoly who came up a couple weeks ago and was like, hire me as a director, I'm from Russia.\n\n24:42.880 --> 24:46.880\nOh, okay, Anatoly's here.\n\n24:46.880 --> 24:48.880\nHello Anatoly, good to see you.\n\n24:48.880 --> 24:50.880\nAnd Anatoly was at Comic-Con.\n\n24:50.880 --> 24:53.880\nAnyways, sorry, derailed your interview.\n\n24:53.880 --> 24:56.880\nNo, I thought you just said thank you, it was nice seeing you.\n\n24:56.880 --> 24:58.880\nI thought you ended it.\n\n24:58.880 --> 24:59.880\nOh, because you have to go?\n\n24:59.880 --> 25:01.880\nNo, because it was a big laugh.\n\n25:01.880 --> 25:02.880\nI know, I know.\n\n25:02.880 --> 25:04.880\nAlright, Matt Dwyer.\n\n25:04.880 --> 25:07.880\nHe's got to go to work.\n\n25:07.880 --> 25:09.880\nLet him go to work.\n\n25:09.880 --> 25:10.880\nThank you, sir.\n\n25:10.880 --> 25:12.880\nMatt Dwyer, good to see you, Matt.\n\n25:12.880 --> 25:14.880\nHello, hello.\n\n25:14.880 --> 25:15.880\nThank you, Enti.\n\n25:15.880 --> 25:16.880\nThank you, Enti.\n\n25:16.880 --> 25:21.880\nSo that episode that we were talking about, he interviews, he sits down with Lucy in Greaves,\n\n25:21.880 --> 25:26.880\nthe Satanic Temple, I'm probably butchering this, about this pink mass thing that took\n\n25:26.880 --> 25:27.880\nplace on this grave.\n\n25:27.880 --> 25:30.880\nIt's bound to be a pretty interesting interview.\n\n25:30.880 --> 25:34.880\nBut I've not listened to his podcast, I've known Matt for a few years, not very well,\n\n25:34.880 --> 25:41.880\nbut doing Acid with Groucho and gay post-mortem grannies, this is good stuff.\n\n25:41.880 --> 25:42.880\nYeah, I like it.\n\n25:42.880 --> 25:45.880\nYeah, he's a better person than me, why don't you marry him?\n\n25:45.880 --> 25:46.880\nAlright.\n\n25:46.880 --> 25:52.880\nSo, we should, oh, well, Feral Audio, Jeff, you know the Matt Dwyer's part of the Feral\n\n25:52.880 --> 25:53.880\nAudio network.\n\n25:53.880 --> 25:54.880\nI say, what?\n\n25:54.880 --> 25:55.880\nYeah.\n\n25:55.880 --> 25:58.880\nDid you know that there's a lot of interesting content on the Feral Audio network?\n\n25:58.880 --> 25:59.880\nWell, I have no idea.\n\n25:59.880 --> 26:05.480\nDid you know, for instance, that Erin McGathy's This Feels Terrible has three live episodes\n\n26:05.480 --> 26:07.880\navailable on the new Feral Audio store?\n\n26:07.880 --> 26:10.880\nShut your mouth.\n\n26:10.880 --> 26:15.880\nAnd if there was an edit point where we were going to play 30 seconds of one of those.\n\n26:15.880 --> 26:18.880\nIt would go a little something, like this.\n\n26:18.880 --> 26:23.320\nLet's bring out our guest, you know her from NBC's Community and a million other things\n\n26:23.320 --> 26:26.880\nand being so cool and smart and adorable, Gillian Jacobs.\n\n26:26.880 --> 26:29.880\nJust read your notes again.\n\n26:29.880 --> 26:31.880\nStop looking at them.\n\n26:31.880 --> 26:38.880\nIt says, Gillian, it says, you know her as Britta from NBC's Community, and then it says dot,\n\n26:38.880 --> 26:43.880\ndot, dot, Gillian Jacobs exclamation point, like, who are you talking to?\n\n26:43.880 --> 26:49.880\nDo you think you might not be able to make the show?\n\n26:49.880 --> 26:52.880\nAdam, go out and just be me.\n\n26:52.880 --> 26:55.880\nAnd make sure, I put an exclamation on it.\n\n26:55.880 --> 26:59.880\nAnd we're back.\n\n26:59.880 --> 27:00.880\nAll right.\n\n27:00.880 --> 27:02.880\nSo moving on, let's see.\n\n27:02.880 --> 27:03.880\nWhat do we got to talk about?\n\n27:03.880 --> 27:07.880\nLet's talk about people shoving tubes down you and you dressing up like a little lady\n\n27:07.880 --> 27:08.880\nin a movement.\n\n27:08.880 --> 27:09.880\nYeah.\n\n27:09.880 --> 27:11.880\nIf you follow me on Instagram, you saw that I was wearing a little gown.\n\n27:11.880 --> 27:13.880\nI went and got an upper endoscopy.\n\n27:13.880 --> 27:14.880\nI'm 40 years old.\n\n27:14.880 --> 27:16.880\nI've had heartburn for about three years.\n\n27:16.880 --> 27:21.880\nI've been taking, once I started taking Prilosec every day, everything's fine.\n\n27:21.880 --> 27:27.880\nBut then I was watching a commercial for Prilosec with Larry the Cable Guy.\n\n27:27.880 --> 27:30.880\nAnd I didn't know where to put my eyes.\n\n27:30.880 --> 27:33.880\nSo they went to the bottom of the screen where I saw the warnings at the bottom.\n\n27:33.880 --> 27:39.880\nAnd it said, like, if you're taking this for more than, I don't know, six weeks or something like that.\n\n27:39.880 --> 27:43.880\nIt might be a redneck.\n\n27:43.880 --> 27:47.880\nThat's Fox wrote it.\n\n27:47.880 --> 27:48.880\nSee a doctor.\n\n27:48.880 --> 27:49.880\nSo I did.\n\n27:49.880 --> 27:51.880\nAnd the doctor did what a good doctor does.\n\n27:51.880 --> 27:55.880\nHe sent me to a friend of his from medical school and charged me a referral fee.\n\n27:55.880 --> 28:02.880\nAnd I went to that guy and he did what a good referral doctor does, which is go down a clipboard\n\n28:02.880 --> 28:08.880\nof questions that lead to him recommending a procedure that he makes money off of.\n\n28:08.880 --> 28:10.880\nAnd I signed off on it.\n\n28:10.880 --> 28:15.880\nAnd I went to this little clinic and they, I never, this is my first medical procedure ever.\n\n28:15.880 --> 28:18.880\nUnless you count like stitches like for my brother beating my ass.\n\n28:18.880 --> 28:20.880\nYou were under general anesthesia.\n\n28:20.880 --> 28:21.880\nWere you not?\n\n28:21.880 --> 28:22.880\nYeah.\n\n28:22.880 --> 28:23.880\nLike they put an IV in me.\n\n28:23.880 --> 28:24.880\nIt was my first IV.\n\n28:24.880 --> 28:26.880\nI feel like I can still feel a little whole.\n\n28:26.880 --> 28:28.880\nIt's very traumatic.\n\n28:28.880 --> 28:34.880\nI don't think we've, I don't think I've ever met anyone that went through what I've been through.\n\n28:34.880 --> 28:38.880\nBut I was like, I was like laying there in the bed and then, yeah, and then they just\n\n28:38.880 --> 28:42.880\nlike, they, they put some extra stuff in your IV and they go like, okay, you're going to\n\n28:42.880 --> 28:43.880\nget a little sleepy.\n\n28:43.880 --> 28:44.880\nAnd it's like,\n\n28:44.880 --> 28:46.880\nAnd then it's four days later.\n\n28:46.880 --> 28:47.880\nIt's incredible.\n\n28:47.880 --> 28:49.880\nI had my, I mean, just to interject for a second.\n\n28:49.880 --> 28:51.880\nI only time I've ever gone under was for my wisdom teeth.\n\n28:51.880 --> 28:54.880\nI like a year or two ago had all four taken out.\n\n28:54.880 --> 29:00.880\nAnd apparently there was a struggle because when I woke up, the office was empty.\n\n29:00.880 --> 29:02.880\nThe doctor was gone.\n\n29:02.880 --> 29:04.880\nThe nurse was there and she looked fatigued.\n\n29:04.880 --> 29:05.880\nAnd I'm not joking.\n\n29:05.880 --> 29:09.880\nMy belt was undone and I had defense wounds on my arms.\n\n29:09.880 --> 29:14.880\nI had, I had scratches on my forearms consistent with fending off a knife fight.\n\n29:14.880 --> 29:17.880\nCan't you even be unconscious normal?\n\n29:17.880 --> 29:18.880\nCan't you?\n\n29:18.880 --> 29:19.880\nCan't you?\n\n29:19.880 --> 29:22.880\nDo you have to be special when you're knocked out too?\n\n29:22.880 --> 29:24.880\nI think I got raped.\n\n29:24.880 --> 29:26.880\nIt's not special.\n\n29:26.880 --> 29:27.880\nMe, me, me.\n\n29:27.880 --> 29:29.880\nAt least he took pictures of my balls.\n\n29:29.880 --> 29:30.880\nSomething happened.\n\n29:30.880 --> 29:32.880\nMaybe X-ray number.\n\n29:32.880 --> 29:33.880\nSee if there's a,\n\n29:33.880 --> 29:34.880\nI don't know, man.\n\n29:34.880 --> 29:37.880\nBut yeah, but I woke up and I think you're going to get a little sleigh.\n\n29:37.880 --> 29:39.880\nAnd then I didn't even hear the P.\n\n29:39.880 --> 29:41.880\nThen I woke up and there was a crime had been committed.\n\n29:41.880 --> 29:42.880\nYeah.\n\n29:42.880 --> 29:45.880\nI honestly don't know, no offense to dentists.\n\n29:45.880 --> 29:49.880\nIf you're a dentist and you, and you work hard and you care about people and you're wonderful.\n\n29:49.880 --> 29:56.880\nI'm not saying a statement about dentists, but I am saying that, that being a dentist,\n\n29:56.880 --> 30:01.880\nI don't think is enough of a qualification to have that much power over another human being.\n\n30:01.880 --> 30:03.880\nBy default.\n\n30:03.880 --> 30:07.880\nI don't think it's, that's not cool.\n\n30:07.880 --> 30:10.880\nHe was an oral surgeon, you know.\n\n30:10.880 --> 30:11.880\nWhen they did that.\n\n30:11.880 --> 30:14.880\nWell, aren't we all?\n\n30:14.880 --> 30:18.880\nTouche.\n\n30:18.880 --> 30:20.880\nI think it's pronounced tushy.\n\n30:20.880 --> 30:21.880\nNo.\n\n30:21.880 --> 30:22.880\nI knew you weren't a surgeon.\n\n30:22.880 --> 30:24.880\nSerious over a bunch of,\n\n30:24.880 --> 30:29.880\nthe, the, I'm just saying like, they put me under, they said,\n\n30:29.880 --> 30:30.880\nyou're going to start to feel drowsy.\n\n30:30.880 --> 30:32.880\nI laid on my side and they're like, you're going to start to feel drowsy.\n\n30:32.880 --> 30:34.880\nAnd I just like, it's just like when you fall asleep,\n\n30:34.880 --> 30:36.880\nlike you can never remember the moment you fell asleep.\n\n30:36.880 --> 30:37.880\nYou remember being sleepy.\n\n30:37.880 --> 30:41.880\nYou remember waking up, but, but I mean so much more profound because,\n\n30:41.880 --> 30:47.880\nbecause while I was sleeping, they did like,\n\n30:47.880 --> 30:49.880\nridiculous things to my body.\n\n30:49.880 --> 30:54.880\nI mean, most notably shoving a camera down my esophagus for 25 minutes.\n\n30:54.880 --> 30:55.880\nAnd I have no recollection of it.\n\n30:55.880 --> 30:57.880\nThey could have done butt stuff.\n\n30:57.880 --> 30:59.880\nThey could have done anything.\n\n30:59.880 --> 31:00.880\nAnd I just woke up.\n\n31:00.880 --> 31:04.880\nI came, I came to, you can see it on my Twitter feed.\n\n31:04.880 --> 31:06.880\nI wasn't, I wasn't doing anything.\n\n31:06.880 --> 31:09.880\nI, the lady who was putting me under,\n\n31:09.880 --> 31:13.880\nI think like a friend of hers wrote on season four of community or something.\n\n31:13.880 --> 31:20.880\nSo, like, so she, like, we were having a conversation about it before she was putting me under.\n\n31:20.880 --> 31:22.880\nShe's like, oh, my friend wrote on that show.\n\n31:22.880 --> 31:23.880\nSo-and-so.\n\n31:23.880 --> 31:25.880\nAnd I said, who?\n\n31:25.880 --> 31:27.880\nAnd she's like, so-and-so.\n\n31:27.880 --> 31:28.880\nHe was a writer in community.\n\n31:28.880 --> 31:31.880\nI was like, season four, perhaps.\n\n31:31.880 --> 31:32.880\nAnd she's like, yeah.\n\n31:32.880 --> 31:36.880\nAnd I'm like, yeah, I didn't work on that season.\n\n31:36.880 --> 31:38.880\nShe's like, oh, you're not working on the show anymore.\n\n31:38.880 --> 31:39.880\nI said, I worked on seasons one through three.\n\n31:39.880 --> 31:41.880\nNow we're coming back for season five.\n\n31:41.880 --> 31:47.880\nAnd an anesthesiologist went, that's weird.\n\n31:47.880 --> 31:54.880\nA woman who, that's how weird it is.\n\n31:54.880 --> 31:58.880\nA lady with no, no horse on that race is like, that's weird.\n\n31:58.880 --> 32:00.880\nI'm like, yeah, no shit.\n\n32:00.880 --> 32:01.880\nYeah.\n\n32:01.880 --> 32:04.880\nI'm going to give you drugs and we're going to shove a hose down your mouth.\n\n32:04.880 --> 32:07.880\nBut I will say this, from what I know about television,\n\n32:07.880 --> 32:12.880\nthat's very odd, that situation that you're in.\n\n32:12.880 --> 32:16.880\nSo I-but I woke up on a gurney and it was moving.\n\n32:16.880 --> 32:19.880\nAnd there were like these ladies looking down at me like I was a baby in a crib.\n\n32:19.880 --> 32:22.880\nThey're like, it must be adorable for them when people wake up\n\n32:22.880 --> 32:25.880\nand they're like smiling at me.\n\n32:25.880 --> 32:31.880\nAnd I went like, give me my phone.\n\n32:31.880 --> 32:33.880\nI'm a writer.\n\n32:33.880 --> 32:36.880\nAnd the anesthesiologist went, give him his phone.\n\n32:36.880 --> 32:39.880\nHe's a writer.\n\n32:39.880 --> 32:44.880\nAnd they gave me my phone and I tried as hard as I could to tweet while I was coming too.\n\n32:44.880 --> 32:46.880\nAnd you could see the tweets.\n\n32:46.880 --> 32:49.880\nThey're like absolute, like Cyrillic.\n\n32:49.880 --> 32:51.880\nIt's not your best work.\n\n32:51.880 --> 32:56.880\nLike only Anatoly would be able to read them.\n\n32:56.880 --> 32:58.880\nYeah, it was not my finest work.\n\n32:58.880 --> 33:00.880\nAnd it wasn't like I was trying to say something profound.\n\n33:00.880 --> 33:02.880\nAll I was trying to do was go, I'm trying to tweet.\n\n33:02.880 --> 33:04.880\nIt wasn't really worth it.\n\n33:04.880 --> 33:06.880\nWhy did you include, I'm a writer.\n\n33:06.880 --> 33:10.880\nHow did you think that would expedite you getting the, like this goes above all of our heads?\n\n33:10.880 --> 33:14.880\nI'm not, my conscious mind is not accountable to the things my unconscious mind says\n\n33:14.880 --> 33:16.880\nas soon as I come out of unconsciousness.\n\n33:16.880 --> 33:22.880\nI apparently, I defined myself by what I do and felt like it entitled me to a phone.\n\n33:22.880 --> 33:26.880\nI had a friend because you have to get driven home from the hospital when you go under.\n\n33:26.880 --> 33:29.880\nSo my friend drove me home from getting my teeth pulled.\n\n33:29.880 --> 33:32.880\nAnd I was still on the medication they had,\n\n33:32.880 --> 33:35.880\nbut they said like in a couple hours a little wear off, go to your pharmacist\n\n33:35.880 --> 33:37.880\nand here's the prescription for the stuff.\n\n33:37.880 --> 33:39.880\nSo I said, oh, my, that was really stoned.\n\n33:39.880 --> 33:44.880\nAnd I said, we have to go to my place because my insurance like pharmacy cards are upstairs.\n\n33:44.880 --> 33:48.880\nSo I went and got all my insurance cards upstairs and I go, oh, she take this trash out too.\n\n33:48.880 --> 33:52.880\nSo I took the trash out and we get to the pharmacist.\n\n33:52.880 --> 33:55.880\nThere's people waiting and I'm like, oh man, it's starting to wear off.\n\n33:55.880 --> 33:56.880\nIt really hurts.\n\n33:56.880 --> 33:57.880\nIt really hurts.\n\n33:57.880 --> 34:01.880\nAnd I get to finally get up to the front and I don't have my cards with me.\n\n34:01.880 --> 34:03.880\nAnd we had to go back and look for the cards.\n\n34:03.880 --> 34:04.880\nI thrown them out.\n\n34:04.880 --> 34:06.880\nI put them in the trash.\n\n34:06.880 --> 34:09.880\nI was like, I shouldn't have been allowed that much responsibility.\n\n34:09.880 --> 34:14.880\nI shouldn't have been allowed to be in a, even though you need a ride,\n\n34:14.880 --> 34:17.880\nit should be illegal to get a ride home with your girlfriend after that.\n\n34:17.880 --> 34:21.880\nI was a prick to Erin because I, but I was like, it was like all dressed up.\n\n34:21.880 --> 34:24.880\nLike I was, I was the protagonist of the dead zone or something.\n\n34:24.880 --> 34:30.880\nYou know, I was just being, I was just being mean to her because I had been unconsciousness and back.\n\n34:30.880 --> 34:33.880\nI was, I was like, Erin, I don't know.\n\n34:33.880 --> 34:35.880\nI wanted to go get a drink.\n\n34:35.880 --> 34:46.880\nAnd, and Erin, the villain in this story had overheard the professional doctors tell me not to drink\n\n34:46.880 --> 34:52.880\nbecause I had anesthetic goodness in my bloodstream.\n\n34:52.880 --> 34:59.880\nAnd so Erin, the villain in this story said, no, I'm not going to take you to the drawing room.\n\n34:59.880 --> 35:05.880\nAnd I was like, Erin, I have been to oblivion and back.\n\n35:05.880 --> 35:13.880\nYou know, I shouldn't, all I know is I was, for 25 minutes of today, I did not exist.\n\n35:13.880 --> 35:19.880\nAnd I came back into existence and, and, and it shouldn't be, I shouldn't be regretting it.\n\n35:19.880 --> 35:25.880\nI, I love my return to consciousness, consciousness so much, I want to go straight to a bar.\n\n35:25.880 --> 35:33.880\nI really was like on this trip where I was like, man, I touched, I touched nothingness and I preferred it.\n\n35:33.880 --> 35:36.880\nOh, so you, oh, so you were willfully trying to go get back in there?\n\n35:36.880 --> 35:39.880\nKind of like, like, like, I just wanted to be somewhere dark and cold and have an Amstel.\n\n35:39.880 --> 35:47.880\nLike, I really wanted to just be alone more than anything because I really felt like, like, I had, I had never made it to 40\n\n35:47.880 --> 35:54.880\nwithout ever being knocked out voluntarily, by, or by another's hand, I should say.\n\n35:54.880 --> 35:58.880\nAnd, and I felt, I was, I was like, wow, I was, I was gone for 20 minutes.\n\n35:58.880 --> 36:05.880\nAnd then, and then I was back and, and, but it was, and it was great to be back, but it wasn't bad to be gone either.\n\n36:05.880 --> 36:07.880\nThere wasn't, it wasn't that big a deal.\n\n36:07.880 --> 36:10.880\nYeah, man, I'm right with you, man.\n\n36:10.880 --> 36:12.880\nI'm on the same wavelength, bro.\n\n36:12.880 --> 36:14.880\nAnd I kind of felt like that was an important, healthy exercise.\n\n36:14.880 --> 36:20.880\nLike, maybe at like a 16 year old's birthdays, they should, they should just have a guy like knock you out.\n\n36:20.880 --> 36:27.880\nJust so you can be dead for a second, and, well, that's an unfortunate linkage to the John Wayne Gacy thing from earlier.\n\n36:27.880 --> 36:37.880\nYour reactions are weird and your weird people, and it doesn't matter.\n\n36:37.880 --> 36:41.880\nThe reaction was, they were waiting for what the next statement was going to be.\n\n36:41.880 --> 36:47.880\nNo, I was saying, like, it should be a rite of passage, but 40 years old is too late to learn that it's okay to not exist.\n\n36:47.880 --> 36:52.880\nPeople knock themselves out all kinds of ways, and then they choke each other.\n\n36:52.880 --> 36:59.880\nYeah, but if I, if I, if I drank a fifth of bourbon and passed out and you shoved a camera down my gut, I'd wake up and go,\n\n36:59.880 --> 37:06.880\nstop, stop it, bro.\n\n37:06.880 --> 37:08.880\nThis is, this is knocked out, out.\n\n37:08.880 --> 37:14.880\nLike you, you lose, you know, and I think that the reality of that is a little bit important.\n\n37:14.880 --> 37:17.880\nIt's not as profound as taking ayahuasca or anything.\n\n37:17.880 --> 37:20.880\nIt's just like, but it's, it's, 40 is too late to, to learn that.\n\n37:20.880 --> 37:22.880\nSo you're out for 20 minutes.\n\n37:22.880 --> 37:25.880\nDo you recall any, any, any, you know, visits?\n\n37:25.880 --> 37:26.880\nNo, that's the point.\n\n37:26.880 --> 37:30.880\nIt's, it's, if that's what, that's our biggest fear with death, right?\n\n37:30.880 --> 37:37.880\nUnless you're, unless you really think that, I mean, my biggest fear with death is that your last thought will play out, you know,\n\n37:37.880 --> 37:43.880\nlike you'll be like, oh shit, did I leave the iron on and then for perceived infinity because your brain is like,\n\n37:43.880 --> 37:49.880\nalso in charge of how you perceive time, like you'll forever like be wondering about your iron.\n\n37:49.880 --> 37:53.880\nBut that might be also, was I addicted to my friends or I owe Toby 50 bucks?\n\n37:53.880 --> 37:56.880\nLike, they're just like, forever.\n\n37:56.880 --> 38:02.880\nLike, but, but I think by and large, our biggest fear is nothingness, oblivion.\n\n38:02.880 --> 38:07.880\nMy biggest fear is why was my belt off when I came to it?\n\n38:07.880 --> 38:09.880\nAll right.\n\n38:09.880 --> 38:10.880\nI mean, I have no point.\n\n38:10.880 --> 38:11.880\nI'm just saying.\n\n38:11.880 --> 38:15.880\nI'm just saying, I'm as special as I was before this experience, Jeff.\n\n38:15.880 --> 38:20.880\nI am, I am now like, Galvatron to my former Megatron.\n\n38:20.880 --> 38:23.880\nI have bathed in the lava of thank you.\n\n38:23.880 --> 38:24.880\nThank you guys in the back.\n\n38:24.880 --> 38:25.880\nAre you okay?\n\n38:25.880 --> 38:27.880\nAre you, do you get a clean bill of health here?\n\n38:27.880 --> 38:28.880\nWhat's going on?\n\n38:28.880 --> 38:30.880\nWell, he didn't, I mean, he said he found a polyp.\n\n38:30.880 --> 38:35.880\nThey made it sound like that's like a thing that you find like, like a seashell on a beach.\n\n38:35.880 --> 38:37.880\nLike he was just like, I just grabbed it.\n\n38:37.880 --> 38:38.880\nLike, it wasn't.\n\n38:38.880 --> 38:40.880\nYou have a coral reef growing inside.\n\n38:40.880 --> 38:43.880\nLike everybody has a couple, has a polyp here and there.\n\n38:43.880 --> 38:44.880\nHe's like, I found a polyp.\n\n38:44.880 --> 38:46.880\nLike, like, like he found a penny.\n\n38:46.880 --> 38:49.880\nBut he said, you know, there's inflammation.\n\n38:49.880 --> 38:50.880\nYou're 40.\n\n38:50.880 --> 38:51.880\nYou got heartburn.\n\n38:51.880 --> 38:55.880\nI didn't see anything weird.\n\n38:55.880 --> 38:57.880\nI didn't, I didn't see Godzilla down there.\n\n38:57.880 --> 39:02.880\nI didn't see, didn't see any, but, but they'll give a full report to my doctor.\n\n39:02.880 --> 39:04.880\nAnd you said, you said you're going to stop drinking tomorrow.\n\n39:04.880 --> 39:06.880\nYou're going on a little juice cleanse.\n\n39:06.880 --> 39:07.880\nYeah, yeah.\n\n39:07.880 --> 39:09.880\nI mean, I've not.\n\n39:09.880 --> 39:10.880\nDon't, don't applaud.\n\n39:10.880 --> 39:11.880\nDon't applaud stopping drinking.\n\n39:11.880 --> 39:16.880\nI've got, I'm going on a, I'm going on a cleanse because I've gone way off my diet.\n\n39:16.880 --> 39:19.880\nAnd I think the best way to get back on that diet is to thank you, sir.\n\n39:19.880 --> 39:23.880\nWe got to stop going to them for anything.\n\n39:23.880 --> 39:27.880\nAll right.\n\n39:27.880 --> 39:29.880\nOur next guest is Anna Toley.\n\n39:29.880 --> 39:31.880\nGet up here, Anna Toley.\n\n39:31.880 --> 39:33.880\nLet's get that guy back up here.\n\n39:33.880 --> 39:46.880\nI didn't know that I would be a guest, so I, I, I, I want to get my 10 bucks for the\n\n39:46.880 --> 39:47.880\nticket back.\n\n39:47.880 --> 39:48.880\nThe to-\n\n39:48.880 --> 39:49.880\nOh!\n\n39:49.880 --> 39:51.880\nHe wants his 10 bucks back because he's a guest.\n\n39:51.880 --> 39:53.880\nNow I'm a guest at the show.\n\n39:53.880 --> 39:54.880\nHey, this is, we, we want-\n\n39:54.880 --> 39:56.880\nThat's a dangerous precedent to set, man.\n\n39:56.880 --> 39:57.880\nNo, no.\n\n39:57.880 --> 40:00.880\nIf you come up, if you come up on the show, you can have $10.\n\n40:00.880 --> 40:02.880\nHere, you know what?\n\n40:02.880 --> 40:04.880\nKeep the change.\n\n40:04.880 --> 40:06.880\nPerestroika, baby.\n\n40:06.880 --> 40:07.880\n$20.\n\n40:07.880 --> 40:08.880\nA $20 bill.\n\n40:08.880 --> 40:09.880\nHow many rubles is that?\n\n40:09.880 --> 40:11.880\nWell, because he was a guest last time, too.\n\n40:11.880 --> 40:12.880\nIt's like 600.\n\n40:12.880 --> 40:13.880\n600 rubles?\n\n40:13.880 --> 40:14.880\nYeah.\n\n40:14.880 --> 40:15.880\nDamn.\n\n40:15.880 --> 40:19.880\nSo Anna Toley, I got some follow-up questions having listened to the podcast that you were\n\n40:19.880 --> 40:20.880\non.\n\n40:20.880 --> 40:23.880\nYou, you, you came up, you said you, you came to UCLA to be a director.\n\n40:23.880 --> 40:24.880\nYep.\n\n40:24.880 --> 40:26.880\nWe said, do you have any favorite directors?\n\n40:26.880 --> 40:27.880\nNo.\n\n40:27.880 --> 40:28.880\nYou don't.\n\n40:28.880 --> 40:29.880\nYou don't.\n\n40:29.880 --> 40:30.880\nI had favorite directors.\n\n40:30.880 --> 40:31.880\nI had favorite directors.\n\n40:31.880 --> 40:32.880\nIt's Wes Anderson.\n\n40:32.880 --> 40:33.880\nOh, Wes Anderson.\n\n40:33.880 --> 40:34.880\nYeah.\n\n40:34.880 --> 40:35.880\nOkay, great.\n\n40:35.880 --> 40:36.880\nThat's like, that's a good guy.\n\n40:36.880 --> 40:37.880\nAnd no one clapping.\n\n40:37.880 --> 40:38.880\nNo.\n\n40:38.880 --> 40:39.880\nWes Anderson.\n\n40:39.880 --> 40:41.880\nWes Anderson, guys.\n\n40:41.880 --> 40:43.880\nDan just, Dan just shut them off.\n\n40:43.880 --> 40:44.880\nDan just told them to stop.\n\n40:44.880 --> 40:47.880\nWell, yeah, I don't, I mean, we're not on good terms, me and the audience.\n\n40:47.880 --> 40:50.880\nI think, I think they should just follow their hearts.\n\n40:50.880 --> 40:54.880\nYou guys, you guys clap or boo whenever you feel like it.\n\n40:54.880 --> 40:56.880\nFuck you!\n\n40:56.880 --> 40:58.880\nShow's over!\n\n40:58.880 --> 41:08.880\nSo then we, we did a scene from Mad Men and you directed us.\n\n41:08.880 --> 41:10.880\nWhich I thought was, I thought was pretty good.\n\n41:10.880 --> 41:11.880\nOur, our scene work?\n\n41:11.880 --> 41:13.880\nI thought our, our scene work was pretty, pretty tight.\n\n41:13.880 --> 41:14.880\nAbsolutely.\n\n41:14.880 --> 41:15.880\nPretty tight.\n\n41:15.880 --> 41:20.880\nBut, but your direction was that I should dress differently and that the script should\n\n41:20.880 --> 41:21.880\nbe better.\n\n41:21.880 --> 41:27.880\nAnd then you asked for a job.\n\n41:27.880 --> 41:28.880\nYeah.\n\n41:28.880 --> 41:29.880\nRight.\n\n41:29.880 --> 41:31.880\nHe certainly has the beard to be a director.\n\n41:31.880 --> 41:32.880\nYeah.\n\n41:32.880 --> 41:33.880\nAnd then you came to, you came to Comic-Con.\n\n41:33.880 --> 41:36.880\nYou were in the Rick and Morty panel at Comic-Con.\n\n41:36.880 --> 41:37.880\nYeah, yeah.\n\n41:37.880 --> 41:42.880\nAnd I, and you, what were you saying at the microphone?\n\n41:42.880 --> 41:43.880\nAt the begin.\n\n41:43.880 --> 41:44.880\nYeah.\n\n41:44.880 --> 41:47.880\nWhen you got to the microphone, what were, what were you saying at the Rick and Morty\n\n41:47.880 --> 41:48.880\npanel?\n\n41:48.880 --> 41:51.880\nI was, I was saying that I had an Archer t-shirt.\n\n41:51.880 --> 41:53.880\nYou had an Archer t-shirt on.\n\n41:53.880 --> 41:54.880\nYeah.\n\n41:54.880 --> 41:55.880\nAnd you were pointing at it.\n\n41:55.880 --> 41:56.880\nYeah.\n\n41:56.880 --> 41:57.880\nAnd there was something.\n\n41:57.880 --> 42:01.880\nEveryone, everyone thought that you were saying, God damn it.\n\n42:01.880 --> 42:03.880\nWhat does Archer t-shirt sound like?\n\n42:03.880 --> 42:04.880\nLike Machu Picchu.\n\n42:04.880 --> 42:05.880\nYeah.\n\n42:05.880 --> 42:08.880\nOh, everyone was saying, is he saying Machu Picchu?\n\n42:08.880 --> 42:11.880\nHe's pointing at his Archer t-shirt.\n\n42:11.880 --> 42:15.880\nIt's not, it's not really a story as much as there's a slice of life.\n\n42:15.880 --> 42:16.880\nYeah.\n\n42:16.880 --> 42:20.880\nIt's appropriate that you like Wes Anderson because you're kind of a Wes Anderson character\n\n42:20.880 --> 42:21.880\nat this point.\n\n42:21.880 --> 42:22.880\nThank you.\n\n42:22.880 --> 42:24.880\nYou're, you're, you're, you're this.\n\n42:24.880 --> 42:29.880\nSo, so you go into UCLA, you're gonna, you're gonna, you're gonna make a, a, but you want\n\n42:29.880 --> 42:31.880\nto direct TV, not movies, right?\n\n42:31.880 --> 42:33.880\nI want to direct both.\n\n42:33.880 --> 42:34.880\nOkay, both.\n\n42:34.880 --> 42:35.880\nFine.\n\n42:35.880 --> 42:36.880\nAll right.\n\n42:36.880 --> 42:41.880\nWhat can, what can, how can we turn Anatoli into a, into a, into a thing that makes people\n\n42:41.880 --> 42:42.880\nclap?\n\n42:42.880 --> 42:43.880\nUm.\n\n42:43.880 --> 42:44.880\nThank you, Anatoli.\n\n42:44.880 --> 42:45.880\nAll right.\n\n42:45.880 --> 42:46.880\nAll right.\n\n42:46.880 --> 42:47.880\nThank you, Anatoli.\n\n42:47.880 --> 42:57.880\nHey, he's fucking, he's 20 bucks in the black right now, man.\n\n42:57.880 --> 42:58.880\nYeah, that's true.\n\n42:58.880 --> 43:03.880\nAnatoli, what are you gonna do with all that money?\n\n43:03.880 --> 43:08.880\nHe will eat.\n\n43:08.880 --> 43:10.880\nI like the name Anatoli.\n\n43:10.880 --> 43:13.880\nI wish, I'm gonna name my son Anatoli.\n\n43:13.880 --> 43:18.880\nYou know, I, I, I used to be like in high school, I didn't like reading all that much\n\n43:18.880 --> 43:19.880\nbecause I hated being told what to do.\n\n43:19.880 --> 43:23.880\nBut then I got crammed in punishment by Dostoevsky, by this young teacher when I was a senior.\n\n43:23.880 --> 43:25.880\nAnd that was the first book I really fell in love with.\n\n43:25.880 --> 43:28.880\nAnd I, like, I became obsessed with Dostoevsky and then Tolstoy and Chekhov.\n\n43:28.880 --> 43:30.880\nAnd I became his big Russofile.\n\n43:30.880 --> 43:35.880\nAnd when I went to USC, I studied, like, I took all these classes in Russian literature.\n\n43:35.880 --> 43:37.880\nI went back and read some of the stuff I wrote.\n\n43:37.880 --> 43:38.880\nI was smart back then.\n\n43:38.880 --> 43:39.880\nI don't know shit anymore.\n\n43:39.880 --> 43:43.880\nSo hearing the name like Anatoli makes me think of it's war and peace.\n\n43:43.880 --> 43:45.880\nIt's Anatolian war and peace, isn't it?\n\n43:45.880 --> 43:46.880\nYou?\n\n43:46.880 --> 43:47.880\nYeah?\n\n43:47.880 --> 43:48.880\nYeah?\n\n43:48.880 --> 43:49.880\nIt's a huge book.\n\n43:49.880 --> 43:50.880\nIt's got to be like four.\n\n43:50.880 --> 43:51.880\nYeah.\n\n43:51.880 --> 43:52.880\nAll right.\n\n43:52.880 --> 43:55.880\nIt just makes me miss the days when I was smart.\n\n43:55.880 --> 43:56.880\nYou're still smart.\n\n43:56.880 --> 43:57.880\nYeah.\n\n43:57.880 --> 43:58.880\nI'm just saying I'm dumb.\n\n43:58.880 --> 44:00.880\nI'm saying, like, when you're in college, your brain is just like, you're, you're so active.\n\n44:00.880 --> 44:01.880\nNo, it is true.\n\n44:01.880 --> 44:05.880\nIf you're, if you're under 30, like, you know, you don't know, man, use it for something.\n\n44:05.880 --> 44:08.880\nI mean, just use it to have fun or make stuff.\n\n44:08.880 --> 44:10.880\nBut you don't have to use it to, like, pick at anything.\n\n44:10.880 --> 44:11.880\nBut yeah, you had to work.\n\n44:11.880 --> 44:13.880\nI worked so fucking hard in college.\n\n44:13.880 --> 44:14.880\nI never want to work that hard again.\n\n44:14.880 --> 44:15.880\nI think that's what it was.\n\n44:15.880 --> 44:18.880\nLike, I worked and I got my A's and I just got out of there.\n\n44:18.880 --> 44:20.880\nLike, I don't ever want that brain lock.\n\n44:20.880 --> 44:21.880\nSo you're a writer.\n\n44:21.880 --> 44:26.880\nYou go through, you force yourself into that procrastination fear that, that brain freeze\n\n44:26.880 --> 44:27.880\nof, I'm out of ideas.\n\n44:27.880 --> 44:29.880\nYou hit those walls, things like that.\n\n44:29.880 --> 44:31.880\nLike, I couldn't put myself through that.\n\n44:31.880 --> 44:32.880\nYeah.\n\n44:32.880 --> 44:34.880\nI'm multitasking.\n\n44:34.880 --> 44:35.880\nI'm multitasking.\n\n44:35.880 --> 44:39.880\nWell, then I'll ask you a question while you, while you thumb through your phone, your giant,\n\n44:39.880 --> 44:40.880\nyour giant phone.\n\n44:40.880 --> 44:41.880\nAll right.\n\n44:41.880 --> 44:42.880\nAsk me a question.\n\n44:42.880 --> 44:44.880\nHow big is your phone?\n\n44:44.880 --> 44:47.880\nHow's, how's the writing coming on, on season five?\n\n44:47.880 --> 44:51.880\nYou know, it's, well, I mean, it's, on Friday, they're applauding.\n\n44:51.880 --> 44:53.880\nThey didn't even know the answer yet.\n\n44:53.880 --> 44:54.880\nAnticipation.\n\n44:54.880 --> 45:00.880\nThey, the, the, the new writers are coming along very nicely.\n\n45:00.880 --> 45:05.880\nThe, the, we, on Friday, like the kind of, like a bunch of, a bunch of popcorn kernels\n\n45:05.880 --> 45:06.880\npopped at the same time.\n\n45:06.880 --> 45:12.880\nWe kind of closed out Friday, like realizing that we had a handle on several great episodes\n\n45:12.880 --> 45:13.880\nall at once.\n\n45:13.880 --> 45:15.880\nAnd we rode down on a party bus to Comic-Con together.\n\n45:15.880 --> 45:17.880\nI got to meet plenty of them.\n\n45:17.880 --> 45:19.880\nNot all of them probably, but a lot of them.\n\n45:19.880 --> 45:24.880\nI, we're doing, as I've announced, because you have to know this before, well in advance,\n\n45:24.880 --> 45:27.880\nwe're doing an animated episode this year.\n\n45:27.880 --> 45:34.880\nThe, and I will say, the animated episode we're doing this year, even for this ridiculous\n\n45:34.880 --> 45:40.880\nshow that we've been doing in all of its unmarketability, this, our approach to doing the animated\n\n45:40.880 --> 45:44.880\nepisode this season is, is something that could definitely only be done in season five\n\n45:44.880 --> 45:45.880\nof Community.\n\n45:45.880 --> 45:50.880\nLike you, meaning that it's like, like even in season three of Community, people would\n\n45:50.880 --> 45:53.880\nbe like, okay, come on, knock it off.\n\n45:53.880 --> 45:55.880\nBut now they can't.\n\n45:55.880 --> 45:59.880\nAnd so it's, but, and I don't mean that it's just weird for weird sake.\n\n45:59.880 --> 46:00.880\nQuite the opposite.\n\n46:00.880 --> 46:05.880\nI mean, it's like, it's like very profound, like, in a way that makes it not, you know,\n\n46:05.880 --> 46:07.880\nit's like, this is a sitcom.\n\n46:07.880 --> 46:09.880\nBut it will also be incredibly funny.\n\n46:09.880 --> 46:13.880\nIt's going to be a fucking masterpiece if I do say so myself.\n\n46:13.880 --> 46:21.880\nEverything sounds horrible when it's followed by applause like that.\n\n46:21.880 --> 46:25.880\nDid you write this a profound episode after you got knocked out and saw the other side?\n\n46:25.880 --> 46:29.880\nNo, I didn't, but I have all new angles on it now that I did.\n\n46:29.880 --> 46:35.880\nBut no, I mean, it's the thing that I'm most proud of is that I was, you know, I, I, I,\n\n46:35.880 --> 46:39.880\nthis was after we kind of like started breaking up the rooms and stuff with these writers.\n\n46:39.880 --> 46:45.880\nLike it's the thing that makes me so much happier than me staring at a whiteboard and\n\n46:45.880 --> 46:49.880\ncoming up with something is, is when I leave a room for two hours and come back and people\n\n46:49.880 --> 46:54.880\nhave landed on something, we just get, we just get some, some brilliant minds in there\n\n46:54.880 --> 46:59.880\nthat are really, really, really respectful of the, of the medium and have come up with\n\n46:59.880 --> 47:01.880\nsome incredible shit.\n\n47:01.880 --> 47:04.880\nDino's going to, his name will be on the cover sheet.\n\n47:04.880 --> 47:06.880\nDino's going to write the animated episode.\n\n47:06.880 --> 47:08.880\nBut I mean, we'll all be writing it together.\n\n47:08.880 --> 47:09.880\nThat's awesome.\n\n47:09.880 --> 47:11.880\nBut it's, it's going to be a goodie.\n\n47:11.880 --> 47:12.880\nI feel comfortable.\n\n47:12.880 --> 47:14.880\nCan you see how many episodes in that will appear?\n\n47:14.880 --> 47:16.880\nActually, no, because we're going to make it stand alone.\n\n47:16.880 --> 47:19.880\nIt's product, it'll be production code 513 for you.\n\n47:19.880 --> 47:21.880\nCommunity production code heads.\n\n47:21.880 --> 47:22.880\nI think you're called.\n\n47:22.880 --> 47:25.880\nFreak out when you see the numbers are swapped and stuff.\n\n47:25.880 --> 47:28.880\nAny numbers you saw, you see swapped or it's for a reason.\n\n47:28.880 --> 47:32.880\nIt's, it's because the directors needed certain schedule and stuff like that.\n\n47:32.880 --> 47:36.880\nWe're giving the animated episode the last production code so that we can put it in.\n\n47:36.880 --> 47:38.880\nIt's going to stand alone kind of.\n\n47:38.880 --> 47:41.880\nSo anyways, that's enough of that business.\n\n47:41.880 --> 47:43.880\nWhat else was there?\n\n47:43.880 --> 47:47.880\nWent to Comic Con, had a weird stomach ache in front of that panel.\n\n47:47.880 --> 47:49.880\nAn amazing panel, 6,500 people.\n\n47:49.880 --> 47:53.880\nI felt something I'd never felt before, which is like this weird like,\n\n47:53.880 --> 47:58.880\nlike normally being in front of 6,500 people would be the most relaxing thing in the world for me.\n\n47:58.880 --> 48:00.880\nThat's my inverted personality.\n\n48:00.880 --> 48:03.880\nI only know I exist when I, when people are listening to me talk.\n\n48:03.880 --> 48:08.880\nAnd, but I had this, I came up, I just had this swell of like,\n\n48:08.880 --> 48:11.880\njust gastrointestinal like tension.\n\n48:11.880 --> 48:15.880\nI felt like the upper half of my stomach had done 1,000 sit-ups.\n\n48:15.880 --> 48:19.880\nAnd I came off stage and explained that to Dino and he said,\n\n48:19.880 --> 48:21.880\nyeah, it's like, you got to watch what you say now.\n\n48:21.880 --> 48:24.880\nLike, like that's that, you know, that's, that's what happens.\n\n48:24.880 --> 48:26.880\nOh, really? You think that was just like.\n\n48:26.880 --> 48:29.880\nYeah, because I was like, I was so looking forward, so forward to the Rick and Morty panel,\n\n48:29.880 --> 48:32.880\nbut now this community thing, it's, it's, it's, I'm sure it's all my fault.\n\n48:32.880 --> 48:35.880\nI'm not complaining about any of it, but this is just the phenomenon that's happened.\n\n48:35.880 --> 48:38.880\nLike, there's so much more wrong I can do than right by talking.\n\n48:38.880 --> 48:41.880\nAnd it's just like, like 6,500 people.\n\n48:41.880 --> 48:47.880\nAnd I'm just like, like, like, like, like, like, take one person\n\n48:47.880 --> 48:50.880\nthat you could make cry by saying the wrong combination of words,\n\n48:50.880 --> 48:55.880\nwhether that person is a Jeff Annie shipper, or a person who served proudly\n\n48:55.880 --> 49:00.880\nin our nation's armed services, or a double amputee,\n\n49:00.880 --> 49:05.880\nor a person that worked really hard on season four,\n\n49:05.880 --> 49:10.880\nor a victim of non-consensual sex in the summer of 98,\n\n49:10.880 --> 49:14.880\nor is that like someone that works for TV Guide,\n\n49:14.880 --> 49:18.880\nwho really, really, really wants me to be an asshole.\n\n49:18.880 --> 49:25.880\nLike, like, there's so many, I go 6,500 people, 6,500 chances to fuck up\n\n49:25.880 --> 49:28.880\nto say the wrong thing. And I think I just, my brain went,\n\n49:28.880 --> 49:30.880\nokay, well, you can't deal with that.\n\n49:30.880 --> 49:34.880\nSo I just pushed it all down into my, into my little Tim Tums.\n\n49:34.880 --> 49:36.880\nTim Tums!\n\n49:36.880 --> 49:40.880\nThat's where the cake in the vodka goes.\n\n49:40.880 --> 49:42.880\nThat's not for dealing.\n\n49:42.880 --> 49:45.880\nBut you don't feel that restriction in here,\n\n49:45.880 --> 49:48.880\nbut this podcast goes out to a lot more than 6,500 people.\n\n49:48.880 --> 49:52.880\nWell, I mean, but, well, walking off that stage, I was like, fuck this.\n\n49:52.880 --> 49:55.880\nLike, I refuse to live my life feeling that way.\n\n49:55.880 --> 49:59.880\nFuck you, fuck you in the teeth forever.\n\n49:59.880 --> 50:01.880\nRight in the teeth.\n\n50:01.880 --> 50:05.880\nIf you would ever have anyone feel that way, go fuck you a million times\n\n50:05.880 --> 50:08.880\nin the big, fat face.\n\n50:08.880 --> 50:11.880\nJust fuck you for wanting people to feel bad.\n\n50:11.880 --> 50:14.880\nI just, I've never done anything to hurt anybody.\n\n50:14.880 --> 50:18.880\nI've never said anything that I wanted to, you know, make people feel pain.\n\n50:18.880 --> 50:21.880\nI just can't do it. I'd rather kill myself.\n\n50:21.880 --> 50:23.880\nI'll never feel that way again. It's a horrible experience.\n\n50:23.880 --> 50:25.880\nAnyways, okay, so...\n\n50:25.880 --> 50:29.880\nWorse than being in San Diego itself, that town is a fucking bummer.\n\n50:29.880 --> 50:34.880\nI'm not talking about downtown San Diego.\n\n50:34.880 --> 50:36.880\nAround San Diego is quite lovely.\n\n50:36.880 --> 50:38.880\nCan you even call it a downtown?\n\n50:38.880 --> 50:39.880\nI don't know, man.\n\n50:39.880 --> 50:42.880\nThere's too many people there. It wasn't the Comic-Con's fault.\n\n50:42.880 --> 50:44.880\nIt wasn't the people's fault that were there.\n\n50:44.880 --> 50:46.880\nYou can't get a good bite to eat.\n\n50:46.880 --> 50:48.880\nNo, I've been there during non-comicon.\n\n50:48.880 --> 50:50.880\nIt's not, I mean, it's not...\n\n50:50.880 --> 50:52.880\nYou got your San Francisco's, you got your Portland's,\n\n50:52.880 --> 50:57.880\nyou got your New York's, your LA's, your Asheville, North Carolina's.\n\n50:57.880 --> 50:59.880\nHipster towns.\n\n50:59.880 --> 51:01.880\nSan Diego is not a hipster town.\n\n51:01.880 --> 51:05.880\nI don't know. It's just a neutral setting of hostility there.\n\n51:05.880 --> 51:07.880\nIt's not because it's military bases.\n\n51:07.880 --> 51:10.880\nThe military people you meet in there are quite nice and friendly and polite and cool.\n\n51:10.880 --> 51:15.880\nYeah, but the equipment the military is using experimentally to enrage the populace.\n\n51:15.880 --> 51:17.880\nYou're familiar with harp?\n\n51:17.880 --> 51:18.880\nI don't like it.\n\n51:18.880 --> 51:21.880\nI got thrown out of a bar. I wasn't doing anything.\n\n51:21.880 --> 51:23.880\nI sassafrassed the bouncer.\n\n51:23.880 --> 51:26.880\nI was standing kind of in the doorway.\n\n51:26.880 --> 51:28.880\nI was not standing in the door jam.\n\n51:28.880 --> 51:31.880\nI was two and a half feet back and a foot over to the side.\n\n51:31.880 --> 51:35.880\nSo three people could have walked abreast like through that doorway and not bumped into me.\n\n51:35.880 --> 51:37.880\nAnd a guy just came in.\n\n51:37.880 --> 51:39.880\nI was the only guy in a suit and kind of a diving bar.\n\n51:39.880 --> 51:42.880\nAnd this guy, and they make all the bouncers there wear shirts to say security on them.\n\n51:42.880 --> 51:45.880\nAnd they all have ear monitors and it's a little much.\n\n51:45.880 --> 51:48.880\nAnd they card you just like checkpoint Charlie.\n\n51:48.880 --> 51:50.880\nLike, it's amazing.\n\n51:50.880 --> 51:54.880\nWell, essentially they're there for Comic-Con because, you know, it's crowd control and stuff, and that's cool.\n\n51:54.880 --> 52:00.880\nBut there was a guy dressed as the crow at the bar who may dress like the crow every day.\n\n52:00.880 --> 52:05.880\nAnd was certainly acting like a guy who dresses like, who's like, oh, I get to dress like the crow.\n\n52:05.880 --> 52:07.880\nAnd who's like, brinking shit.\n\n52:07.880 --> 52:09.880\nLike, nobody was sassafrassing him.\n\n52:09.880 --> 52:10.880\nI was standing there in a suit.\n\n52:10.880 --> 52:12.880\nI had some drinks, but I wasn't bothering anybody.\n\n52:12.880 --> 52:13.880\nI was kind of just standing there.\n\n52:13.880 --> 52:15.880\nAnd the guy lives like, bro, you can't stand there.\n\n52:15.880 --> 52:22.880\nI'm like, and I look down and there's a little concrete square of kind of where the incline of the doorway comes in.\n\n52:22.880 --> 52:24.880\nYou know, where they had to kind of pave that little way up.\n\n52:24.880 --> 52:26.880\nAnd I was like right on the edge of that.\n\n52:26.880 --> 52:30.880\nAnd so I just kind of semi sarcastically tiptoed just out of it.\n\n52:30.880 --> 52:32.880\nAnd he goes, keep moving, bro.\n\n52:32.880 --> 52:37.880\nI'm like, you tell me, I'm going to keep tiptoeing and you tell me when to stop.\n\n52:37.880 --> 52:39.880\nYou're like, don't sass me, bro.\n\n52:39.880 --> 52:40.880\nDon't sass me.\n\n52:40.880 --> 52:45.880\nI'm like, look, not only would I never sass you, sir.\n\n52:45.880 --> 52:48.880\nI have so much respect for you and what you're doing right now.\n\n52:48.880 --> 52:51.880\nI just want to be the world's best customer at this bar.\n\n52:51.880 --> 52:53.880\nAnd I want to know all the rules.\n\n52:53.880 --> 52:54.880\nI want to know everything.\n\n52:54.880 --> 52:56.880\nSo I don't want to get this one wrong.\n\n52:56.880 --> 52:57.880\nI go, is this okay?\n\n52:57.880 --> 52:59.880\nAnd he's like, he just gave me the eyeball.\n\n52:59.880 --> 53:05.880\nAnd then an hour later, I'm in the back, like leaning up against like a stack of beer boxes, texting my girlfriend, not doing anything.\n\n53:05.880 --> 53:06.880\nBro, you're wobbly.\n\n53:06.880 --> 53:07.880\nYou got to go.\n\n53:07.880 --> 53:13.880\nLike he took him an hour to get ahead of steam or a couple of shots of drone attack.\n\n53:13.880 --> 53:16.880\nHe just got fucking like, he was separated from the pack.\n\n53:16.880 --> 53:20.880\nAnd then the things kind of polite on my end kind of went out the window.\n\n53:20.880 --> 53:23.880\nYeah, I've seen you more sober, but I've seen you a lot drunker.\n\n53:23.880 --> 53:26.880\nAnd everyone in that bar was also drunker.\n\n53:26.880 --> 53:29.880\nLike, I mean, you weren't doing anything wrong.\n\n53:29.880 --> 53:30.880\nHe goes, you're wobbly.\n\n53:30.880 --> 53:31.880\nAnd I go, I'm not wobbly.\n\n53:31.880 --> 53:32.880\nYou can't even talk right now.\n\n53:32.880 --> 53:33.880\nYou're slurring, bro.\n\n53:33.880 --> 53:34.880\nI'm not.\n\n53:34.880 --> 53:35.880\nYeah, you see, you're slurring.\n\n53:35.880 --> 53:36.880\nI go, you're a cunt.\n\n53:36.880 --> 53:44.880\nAnd I go, do you read me, big buddy?\n\n53:44.880 --> 53:46.880\nAm I coming in?\n\n53:46.880 --> 53:48.880\nAnd then right when you walked over, what's going on?\n\n53:48.880 --> 53:49.880\nWell, this guy's a cunt.\n\n53:49.880 --> 53:50.880\nOh, who's this guy?\n\n53:50.880 --> 53:51.880\nThis guy's a cunt, too.\n\n53:51.880 --> 53:52.880\nI don't know.\n\n53:52.880 --> 53:53.880\nThere's two guys.\n\n53:53.880 --> 53:54.880\nThis guy's a coward because he did this.\n\n53:54.880 --> 53:56.880\nWe cocked his fist at me and he didn't do anything.\n\n53:56.880 --> 53:59.880\nSo cunt, coward, cunt.\n\n53:59.880 --> 54:03.880\nLook, don't throw me out of your bar.\n\n54:03.880 --> 54:07.880\nYeah, the people that go into that line of work.\n\n54:07.880 --> 54:08.880\nAll right.\n\n54:08.880 --> 54:12.880\nI mean, well, if you are a cool bouncer and I know there must be a lot of them because\n\n54:12.880 --> 54:13.880\nthere's a lot of cool places to drink.\n\n54:13.880 --> 54:14.880\nThey generally are.\n\n54:14.880 --> 54:16.880\nThey don't work in San Diego.\n\n54:16.880 --> 54:17.880\nYeah, yeah.\n\n54:17.880 --> 54:19.880\nThey're like, please thank you.\n\n54:19.880 --> 54:20.880\nThat's not true.\n\n54:20.880 --> 54:23.880\nI'm in a very nice bouncer who had the full thing and he was quite helpful and nice,\n\n54:23.880 --> 54:25.880\nbut he just looks like, I don't know, San Diego.\n\n54:25.880 --> 54:31.880\nToo many sideways or backwards baseball hats on white dudes with crocs or flip-flops on.\n\n54:31.880 --> 54:37.880\nSan Diego may officially get the Jeff Davis patented thumbs down and fart sound.\n\n54:37.880 --> 54:39.880\nThat means a lot to people.\n\n54:39.880 --> 54:40.880\nIt does.\n\n54:40.880 --> 54:41.880\nWhat?\n\n54:41.880 --> 54:42.880\nI'm not being sarcastic.\n\n54:42.880 --> 54:43.880\nThumbs down and fart sound?\n\n54:43.880 --> 54:44.880\nThumbs down from Jeff.\n\n54:44.880 --> 54:45.880\nLike, you know, Jeff.\n\n54:45.880 --> 54:46.880\nI rarely do it.\n\n54:46.880 --> 54:48.880\nSan Diego is a giant county and it's a big city.\n\n54:48.880 --> 54:50.880\nThere's whales that just got the thumbs down.\n\n54:50.880 --> 54:51.880\nLike, you didn't even...\n\n54:51.880 --> 54:52.880\nDon't get me started on Blackfish Man.\n\n54:52.880 --> 54:53.880\nI just saw that yesterday.\n\n54:53.880 --> 54:55.880\nYou guys want to get it bummed out?\n\n54:55.880 --> 54:56.880\nI wasn't.\n\n54:56.880 --> 54:57.880\nIt's a bummer.\n\n54:57.880 --> 54:58.880\nYou know about this movie?\n\n54:58.880 --> 54:59.880\nNo.\n\n54:59.880 --> 55:00.880\nIt's a documentary.\n\n55:00.880 --> 55:01.880\nIs that like The Cove or something?\n\n55:01.880 --> 55:02.880\nNo, it's...\n\n55:02.880 --> 55:03.880\nWell, kind of.\n\n55:03.880 --> 55:04.880\nIt's the concrete pool.\n\n55:04.880 --> 55:10.880\nIt's about SeaWorld's treatment of orcas and the cover-ups of the people that die training\n\n55:10.880 --> 55:11.880\nthem there.\n\n55:11.880 --> 55:12.880\nWait.\n\n55:12.880 --> 55:13.880\nPeople die?\n\n55:13.880 --> 55:14.880\nYeah, they die.\n\n55:14.880 --> 55:19.880\nAnd it's just an absolute, like, PR just thing.\n\n55:19.880 --> 55:20.880\nBecause there's one whale...\n\n55:20.880 --> 55:25.880\nI don't want to spoil it for everybody, but there is one whale that ate a lady.\n\n55:25.880 --> 55:27.880\nIt was not much of a spoiler.\n\n55:27.880 --> 55:29.880\nYeah, and it's not because it's in the news and stuff like that.\n\n55:29.880 --> 55:34.880\nBut what I did not know is this whale's backstory is pretty fascinating.\n\n55:34.880 --> 55:36.880\nAnd this whale has a backstory.\n\n55:36.880 --> 55:42.880\nApparently, it once walked on land and looked much like a pronosaurus.\n\n55:42.880 --> 55:48.280\nAll right, well, let's bring up the rest of our little rascals and get their two cents\n\n55:48.280 --> 55:49.880\non everything that's happened tonight.\n\n55:49.880 --> 55:50.880\nKumail Nanjiani.\n\n55:50.880 --> 55:51.880\nWe missed you.\n\n55:51.880 --> 55:52.880\nConan O'Brien's Kumail Nanjiani.\n\n55:52.880 --> 55:53.880\nConan O'Brien's Kumail Nanjiani.\n\n55:53.880 --> 55:54.880\nIt's been a while.\n\n55:54.880 --> 55:55.880\nYou know what?\n\n55:55.880 --> 55:56.880\nCan I say?\n\n55:56.880 --> 55:57.880\nKind of fuck San Diego.\n\n55:57.880 --> 55:59.380\nWould you fuck it right in the teeth?\n\n55:59.380 --> 56:03.880\nWould you fuck it with a side of beef?\n\n56:03.880 --> 56:15.880\nWould you fuck it on a bagel?\n\n56:15.880 --> 56:19.880\nI would fuck it till it queefed.\n\n56:19.880 --> 56:20.880\nI like your meter.\n\n56:20.880 --> 56:21.880\nYeah.\n\n56:21.880 --> 56:22.880\nA-B-C-B.\n\n56:22.880 --> 56:27.880\nThat was like a kind of a haiku.\n\n56:27.880 --> 56:28.880\nI was that comic on.\n\n56:28.880 --> 56:29.880\nI went to see it.\n\n56:29.880 --> 56:30.880\nI didn't run into you.\n\n56:30.880 --> 56:35.080\nIt's like super packed, so I was with my wife and we were walking side by side, and it's\n\n56:35.080 --> 56:39.880\nlike just a ton of people around, and Emily looked at me and she's like, there's a guy\n\n56:39.880 --> 56:44.960\nwith his crotch on my butt right now, right behind me.\n\n56:44.960 --> 56:53.040\nSo I looked back to sort of see, because expecting like a huge crowd, it was just one guy.\n\n56:53.040 --> 56:59.680\nIt was me, Emily, and then just one guy, nobody else around, just like a butt backpack on,\n\n56:59.680 --> 57:01.680\nlike just attached to her.\n\n57:01.680 --> 57:09.180\nLike the rules of society kind of don't apply, and comic on.\n\n57:09.180 --> 57:14.560\nThe weird thing that's starting to happen now is that, because I'm old.\n\n57:14.560 --> 57:17.640\nI was there in the 90s when I was signed in comic books.\n\n57:17.640 --> 57:20.080\nThere was a Marvel Center.\n\n57:20.080 --> 57:26.880\nThere were video game consoles being sold there, but we nerds were allowed to sit on\n\n57:26.880 --> 57:33.120\nthe floor of hallways with our big bags of shit that we bought at our nerd mecca and\n\n57:33.120 --> 57:34.360\ngo through shit.\n\n57:34.360 --> 57:37.840\nAnd then there was a tipping point that got crossed, I don't know, let's say six years\n\n57:37.840 --> 57:42.120\nago, I have no idea, whenever, I mean there was just a point where it was like, this movie\n\n57:42.120 --> 57:45.800\nhas nothing to do with comic books, but it's appearing here anywhere, but I realize community\n\n57:45.800 --> 57:47.000\nis part of the problem.\n\n57:47.000 --> 57:52.920\nI like returned to this like sun dance of things, but now you just get cattle prodded\n\n57:52.920 --> 57:54.760\nif you're a nerd and you try to sit down anywhere.\n\n57:54.760 --> 57:59.840\nThey're like, keep it moving, keep it moving, and it's like, and yeah, I really hate the\n\n57:59.840 --> 58:05.400\nbooth babes thing, like that is so fucking gross to me, all those like, I feel horrible\n\n58:05.400 --> 58:09.040\nfor them too, because they're like, this is the, you know, three days of the year where\n\n58:09.040 --> 58:15.080\nthey definitely have work, but if you go day three, their eyes are so sad, but there's\n\n58:15.080 --> 58:21.520\nalso now it's like, it's almost like, it's the worst of all worlds because it was nerd\n\n58:21.520 --> 58:25.320\nmecca, but now it's nerd sun dance, and now because it's nerd sun dance, it's a form of\n\n58:25.320 --> 58:29.080\nsun dance, so now there's this douchey component coming in.\n\n58:29.080 --> 58:34.000\nI saw, I was in a pizza parlor and there were two girls who were in costume and they didn't\n\n58:34.000 --> 58:39.680\nknow each other, but some guys wanted pictures with them, and then another guy, like with\n\n58:39.680 --> 58:45.160\na backwards baseball cap and some crocs and some flip flops and some flute flops, who's\n\n58:45.160 --> 58:49.840\nsitting in the pizza parlor, he started yelling out, he's like, make out, make out!\n\n58:49.840 --> 58:55.320\nAnd I was like, oh, well, whatever, San Diego meets Comic-Con, he had laminates on, he was\n\n58:55.320 --> 59:01.680\na fucking Comic-Con guy, he was just there to see, you know, fucking, Ben Affleck III\n\n59:01.680 --> 59:03.680\nor whatever's premiering there, you know?\n\n59:03.680 --> 59:07.560\nAre we already at Ben Affleck III?\n\n59:07.560 --> 59:13.840\nYou know what we are, because we had Ben Affleck I was like, mall rats and stuff, then Ben\n\n59:13.840 --> 59:19.160\nAffleck II was Goodwill Hunting, and now Argo is Ben Affleck III.\n\n59:19.160 --> 59:20.160\nThis is Ben Affleck III.\n\n59:20.160 --> 59:22.680\nWell, now he's, yeah, now he's directing and he's got a beard.\n\n59:22.680 --> 59:28.160\nOkay, let's, I forgot to bring out the list of our little rascals, we got to get Darla\n\n59:28.160 --> 59:42.640\nand Spanky out here, Erin McGathy, and Spencer, Spencer Crittenden, our Dungeon Master.\n\n59:42.640 --> 59:56.560\nAaron, anything, any, any, you have to stand back in the booth and listen to me talk for\n\n59:56.560 --> 59:59.600\nan hour, would anything you want to feed that guy?\n\n59:59.600 --> 01:00:10.880\nI'm from San Diego, and I, I couldn't agree more, I, I, it is like a douchey, like it's\n\n01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:14.800\na, Comic Con is very different than what the town's vibe is generally.\n\n01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:22.520\nYeah, I mean, like as a, as a high schooler there who felt like an outcast, being, being\n\n01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:27.560\nreally hot and, I mean, the problem is, is that it's so beautiful in San Diego that there's\n\n01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:33.000\nno, there's no real like art or theater scene that's supported as much as it should be, because\n\n01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.800\neveryone's like, let's just jet ski.\n\n01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:42.520\nAnd it's a big retirement community, also it's so hot there that if you're a fat 15-year-old\n\n01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:48.680\nand you're wearing sweatshirts, everyone notices, and you, you can't really fly, like, fly under\n\n01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:54.840\nthe radar, being unique is not valued in San Diego, but shout out to the two people I still\n\n01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:57.600\ntalk to there.\n\n01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:59.920\nThe guy, the Joe Carrara way, sweetie.\n\n01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:11.560\nI mean, San Diego obviously has like, cool parts to it, but it like, there is, there's\n\n01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:18.560\na big value put on conformity and being able to wear a mid-drift.\n\n01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:19.560\nSeafood.\n\n01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:20.560\nSeafood.\n\n01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:21.560\nAnd backwards, backwards.\n\n01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:25.760\nThere's a big jock culture there, and I think it is, it is due in part to the military\n\n01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:29.960\nbasis, which is fine, like, I come from a military family, and I'm not saying that the military\n\n01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:33.120\nis bad or anything, but there is like, there's a big like macho thing there.\n\n01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.120\nWell, the whole thing about-\n\n01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.120\nWell, the whole thing about-\n\n01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.160\nDouchebaggery that I have noticed down there, my brother went to college there, so I was\n\n01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:40.360\ndown there a lot, and I used to go down there for lots of reasons and stuff.\n\n01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:44.240\nYou don't see fights in bars in Los Angeles, almost never.\n\n01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.240\nI don't know what that's about.\n\n01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:48.400\nBecause they always wanted to protect their face, that's their life.\n\n01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:55.040\nEven like, even in dodgy bars where people are already beat up, like, I think there's\n\n01:01:55.040 --> 01:02:02.000\na level of like, he might shoot me, or I'll be looking over my shoulder for the rest of\n\n01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.720\nmy life if I do that.\n\n01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:08.760\nBut in San Diego, people fight in bars, like, it's just a weird tension and a hostility\n\n01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:10.560\nthat I cannot get on board with.\n\n01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.560\nYeah.\n\n01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:12.560\nOh, by the way, can I say something?\n\n01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:17.720\nThis is changing the subject, is that when you woke up, I've heard, and it's easier\n\n01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:21.880\nthat when you wake up, different parts of your brain wakes up at different times.\n\n01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:26.720\nAnd so, the part that is more aggressive wakes up before the part that sort of controls\n\n01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:27.720\nthat.\n\n01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:28.720\nIt sounds accurate.\n\n01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:31.520\nGive me my phone, I'm a writer.\n\n01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:43.040\nYeah, so that was just brain chemistry, man, that's not on you.\n\n01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:45.920\nI punched my mom after I came out of...\n\n01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:47.420\nYou punched your mom?\n\n01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:48.420\nI was 12.\n\n01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:49.920\nNo, don't do that.\n\n01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:53.160\nYou haven't met her.\n\n01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:58.600\nJeff, look what time it is.\n\n01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:03.720\nI have to be honest, I looked over a minute ago, it was 9.10.\n\n01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:04.720\nI was...\n\n01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.080\nHowever booed you punching your mom, I have to boo them.\n\n01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.080\nBoo.\n\n01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.240\nYeah, I apologize afterwards.\n\n01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.840\nI don't remember doing it.\n\n01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:16.720\nAlso, obviously, if you didn't tell people that you punched your mom, you're not like\n\n01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:20.080\ngoing, hey, it's something you should cheer.\n\n01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:21.800\nYeah, I'm being revealing and you guys are...\n\n01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:24.720\nIt might have been an ironic boo, I think people are having fun with it.\n\n01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:25.720\nWell, now I boo your...\n\n01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.720\nIt's a very vocal audience, we were commenting.\n\n01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:33.400\nYeah, well, I've engaged them, they can sense in me, they can sense what happened to me\n\n01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:38.160\nat Comic-Con or they can sense what happened to me in Oblivion.\n\n01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:40.080\nYou know what, I know exactly what you feel.\n\n01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:42.080\nIt feels like when you get...\n\n01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:46.840\nI was like 12 when I had surgery and I had like ear problems my whole life and I would\n\n01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:49.440\nget these horrible ear ricks and it was like, when you're old enough to have surgery, when\n\n01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:52.680\nyou're old enough to have surgery and when I was 12, I was old enough and I was planned\n\n01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:56.920\nfor months and I was there waiting and the doctors came in and scrubbed and they were\n\n01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.160\nlike, hey, do you want to go to the circus?\n\n01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:03.680\nAnd I was like, fuck you, I'm not an animal.\n\n01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:08.120\nBut I went in and they strapped me down and I fought and they put a mask on my face and\n\n01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:13.000\nthey were like, blow it, there'll be a balloon, one, I'm too old at this point to give a shit\n\n01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.800\nabout a balloon and I remember blowing as hard as I can and being like, there's no balloon,\n\n01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.300\nI'm like screaming it.\n\n01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:24.120\nBut it feels like such a violation that they can put you out that hard.\n\n01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:28.760\nWhen I woke up, I was like angry that they have the ability to do that to me.\n\n01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:31.800\nLike I have favorite ice cream flavors and shit and you took it all away.\n\n01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:35.000\nWell, I didn't, I should be clear, I didn't feel that way at all.\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:41.520\nI was, I was so grateful for Western medicine and all that it, I, I, I, I, I, you love balloons.\n\n01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:47.400\nI didn't want, they said you're going to start to feel drowsy and I was, I was so grateful.\n\n01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:53.280\nI like, like three seconds and then blink and then I heard like a beep beep and it felt\n\n01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:57.920\nlike I could hear beeping for a while and then to wake up in a crib pushed by ladies\n\n01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:02.280\nsmiling and going, did I die and go to heaven?\n\n01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:06.520\nI had a camera down my throat and I didn't know I was, I was very, no, I liked that I\n\n01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:11.560\nwas out, but I, I just was a little, like I had all my wisdom teeth out last year and\n\n01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:13.960\nI was like, don't put me under one go.\n\n01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:14.960\nYeah.\n\n01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:15.960\nUh, yeah.\n\n01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.680\nNo, in a couple of goals, couple of different goals.\n\n01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:18.680\nYou opted to be awake.\n\n01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:23.320\nWell, I hadn't gone to the dentist in like 15 years and I was at a burger place and it\n\n01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.920\nsaid, get the Buffalo burger.\n\n01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:30.280\nIf the native, native Americans only ate buffalo and if they had proper dental care, they would\n\n01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.400\nhave lived to be 120 or something.\n\n01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:36.760\nSo I was like, uh, shit, I got a, you know, what restaurant was this?\n\n01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:40.000\nIt's called the fixed burger.\n\n01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000\nSo I went to the dentist and I was like, Hey, it's just a regular checkup.\n\n01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.280\nAnd she was like, emergency dental surgery right now.\n\n01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:54.320\nYour mouth is a cave of nightmares.\n\n01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:56.240\nI knew it was going to be back and she was like, give me symptoms.\n\n01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:07.600\nAnd I said, if I ice cream on the left side of my mouth, my spine hurts.\n\n01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:08.600\nYou might be a redneck.\n\n01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:13.760\nSo I had months of surgery for that and I didn't want to go under because that time\n\n01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:17.640\nwhen I was 12, it felt, to me, it felt like a violation, but that's very interesting to\n\n01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:18.640\nme.\n\n01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:21.800\nI mean, that's, there's a four, there's a fork on the road there.\n\n01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:31.880\nThe fact that you felt, I, my terror, my like, I want to be out because I don't want any\n\n01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:32.880\nof it to be happening.\n\n01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:33.880\nYeah.\n\n01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:38.520\nBut you, but you're like, I didn't want to be there for it, but I didn't want to get\n\n01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:39.520\nput under that.\n\n01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:46.600\nWhile it's happening, I regretted it because they were playing 13 going on 30 and I was\n\n01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:52.040\nlike, this dental surgery is the second worst thing I'm going through right now.\n\n01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:53.680\nSpencer, have you ever been knocked out?\n\n01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:56.800\nI'm on stage two.\n\n01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:00.320\nThat's, that's not, that's not a complaint.\n\n01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:01.320\nThat's not a complaint.\n\n01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:06.200\nThat's just a clarification for our podcast listeners because they heard an applause.\n\n01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:09.920\nSpencer has, for those of you that never been to or seen a picture of us, Spencer's\n\n01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.640\nat the kids table over on the side.\n\n01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:12.640\nYeah.\n\n01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.640\nNo, I'm, that wasn't a complaint.\n\n01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:14.640\nI promise.\n\n01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:15.640\nI'm not, I'm fine.\n\n01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:16.640\nYou've been surgery'd before.\n\n01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.640\nYou've been surgery'd?\n\n01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:18.640\nYeah.\n\n01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:19.640\nWhat was it?\n\n01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:22.320\nIs that, is that how you conjugate that?\n\n01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:23.320\nWhy not?\n\n01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:24.320\nWho cares?\n\n01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:25.320\nYou can barber.\n\n01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:26.320\nDo you know what I said?\n\n01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:27.320\nIt's a sewing term.\n\n01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:28.960\nIt just, I mean, it made sense, right?\n\n01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:29.960\nYeah.\n\n01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:30.960\nThat's all that counts.\n\n01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.960\nThat's the beautiful thing about the English language.\n\n01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:33.960\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:40.440\nSpencer and Jeff have been fighting all day, just so you guys know.\n\n01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:41.440\nYeah, no.\n\n01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:44.320\nI've had all my wisdom teeth out.\n\n01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.040\nThat was crazy.\n\n01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:50.480\nI've had a, okay, everybody in the audience has to be honest.\n\n01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:52.920\nDoes anyone know what a pylonidyl cyst is?\n\n01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:53.920\nYou?\n\n01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:54.920\nIs it in your butt?\n\n01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:55.920\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:01.040\nIt's not fun, but it's also not terrible, but I had one of those dealt with.\n\n01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:02.040\nIt's a cyst up your butt?\n\n01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:04.840\nThat's interesting because I would think most things to do with your butt would either\n\n01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:06.640\nbe great or terrible.\n\n01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:07.640\nYeah.\n\n01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:08.640\nAnd this is like a-\n\n01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:12.280\nI'd say it's the most, you know, ambivalent thing you could do with your butt.\n\n01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:13.600\nYou could take it or leave it.\n\n01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:14.600\nYeah.\n\n01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:18.680\nWell, that's the weird thing about it because you could like, depending on, you know, the\n\n01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:23.280\nintensity, sometimes it's better to not have it operated on and sometimes it's better to\n\n01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.560\nhave it operated on.\n\n01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:25.560\nWhat is it?\n\n01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:26.560\nIt's a cyst up in your butt hole?\n\n01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.560\nOkay.\n\n01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:31.200\nIt's like, it's like, it's like, you know, if you have an ingrown hair and it kind of\n\n01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:34.160\nbecomes infected and then if you squeeze it, the hair comes out and there's a tiny little\n\n01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.160\nbit of pus.\n\n01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:39.560\nIt's like that in that it develops this kind of channel from your hair follicle that gets\n\n01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:40.560\ninfected.\n\n01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:41.560\nIn your butt?\n\n01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:42.560\nYeah.\n\n01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:43.560\nThe whole thing is in your butt.\n\n01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:46.440\nThe scent, well, not in your butt, it's in the butt crack.\n\n01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:47.440\nLike-\n\n01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:48.440\nOh, so not the hole.\n\n01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:49.440\nYeah, no, above it.\n\n01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:50.440\nIt's in the-\n\n01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:51.440\nIt's in the runway.\n\n01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:52.440\nLower back.\n\n01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:55.360\nIt depends on, you know, which direction your approach is.\n\n01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:59.960\nMy confusion is that why would they bother to call it a special kind of cyst when it's\n\n01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:00.960\njust-\n\n01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:04.960\nWell, a cyst implies it's like, you know, in my mind, it's like kind of like a growth,\n\n01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:10.440\nlike a tumorous growth, but it's more like just like a little opening, like a little-\n\n01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:13.320\nIs the, what was the word you said before, cysts?\n\n01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:14.320\nPylonitral.\n\n01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:15.320\nNo.\n\n01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:16.320\nGo away.\n\n01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:17.320\nOh.\n\n01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:18.320\nSpencer's dad has-\n\n01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.320\nSpencer's dad has-\n\n01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:20.320\nHold on.\n\n01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:21.320\nHold on.\n\n01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:22.320\nLet me explain this.\n\n01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:23.800\nMy dad also had to deal with this.\n\n01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:24.800\nThat's all he's going to contribute.\n\n01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:25.800\nSpencer's dad has just-\n\n01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:26.800\nWe can stop there.\n\n01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:27.800\nSpencer's dad just kind of-\n\n01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:28.800\nSpencer's dad is re-working the stage?\n\n01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:29.800\nSee, he's had a couple.\n\n01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:30.800\nThere you go.\n\n01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:31.800\nThat was-\n\n01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:32.800\nSo much to talk about.\n\n01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:33.800\nThank you, Mr. Creighton.\n\n01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:51.160\nMy mom came over to my house today to drop off some T-shirts, but she stayed there.\n\n01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:52.840\nSpencer.\n\n01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:55.520\nI can't get her out of the chimney.\n\n01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:57.960\nNo, she left eventually.\n\n01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:58.960\nWell, I'm-\n\n01:09:58.960 --> 01:09:59.960\nI'm-\n\n01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:00.960\nI'm ornery about my parents.\n\n01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:03.560\nWell, they can be a drag at your age, you know.\n\n01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:04.560\nYou want-\n\n01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:05.560\nYeah.\n\n01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:06.560\nYou want some elbow room.\n\n01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.560\nIt's literally.\n\n01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:08.560\nYeah.\n\n01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.560\nYou saw me elbowing them.\n\n01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:12.560\nWell, you moved out of your parents' home at 23, 24 years old?\n\n01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:13.560\nYeah.\n\n01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.320\nAnd so what's the problem now?\n\n01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.320\nAre they happy you're gone?\n\n01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:17.320\nSad you're gone?\n\n01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:20.960\nI just don't, you know, communicate with them like most people communicate with their\n\n01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:21.960\nparents.\n\n01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:25.080\nSo, you know, I'm like, let's just do it that way.\n\n01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:26.080\nAnd that's how I do it.\n\n01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.480\nAnd they're going through maybe a little bit of like-\n\n01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.480\nWell, yeah.\n\n01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:30.480\nBecause I'm great.\n\n01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:31.480\nRight.\n\n01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:32.480\nYou are great.\n\n01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:35.920\nI guess without knowing that you probably brought some structure and order possibly to\n\n01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:36.920\nthe household, maybe.\n\n01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:37.920\nRight.\n\n01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:38.920\nI'd like to think so.\n\n01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:39.920\nYeah.\n\n01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:42.480\nHey, before we move, do you want to finish telling us about the-\n\n01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:43.480\nYeah.\n\n01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:47.040\nWell, it just happened and, you know, you could get it cut out for a while.\n\n01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:52.760\nDoes the word that you said before the word sist, does that word mean in the butt crack?\n\n01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.400\nNo, it's really gross.\n\n01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:55.960\nIt means nest of hair.\n\n01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:56.960\nIt doesn't-\n\n01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:57.960\nSo, it has-\n\n01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.960\nIt's not an accurate depiction.\n\n01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:03.640\nThe fact that it was in your butt crack has nothing to- that's just incidental, right?\n\n01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:04.640\nNo, it was because-\n\n01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.640\nYou could get one of these on your chest.\n\n01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:06.640\nYou could get one on your arm.\n\n01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:09.480\nOh, no, I do call my asshole a nest of hair.\n\n01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.680\nA pilonitis.\n\n01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:14.360\nThe word nest implies that there's creatures dwelling.\n\n01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:15.360\nThat's why it's gross.\n\n01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.360\nThat's why it's gross.\n\n01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:20.080\nBut I know what it means, so I'm not just going to be like, I don't know what it means.\n\n01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:24.000\nHave you guys seen the new CW show, Nest of Hair?\n\n01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000\nIt's about San Diego.\n\n01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:35.760\nBut I'm still- I mean, I want to know, does that word mean in the butt crack, or does\n\n01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:36.760\nit-\n\n01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:37.760\nNo, it means nest of hair.\n\n01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.240\nSo, is it something that only happens in the butt crack?\n\n01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:44.840\nYeah, because that's where there's friction, and when you're sitting, that's where sometimes\n\n01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:50.440\nsweat collects, and if you're in a car or a vehicle, there's agitation when you're bouncing\n\n01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:55.080\nin the car, and that's why a lot of GIs get it, and it's known as Jeep Butt.\n\n01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.080\nJeep Butt.\n\n01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:57.080\nYeah.\n\n01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.080\nThat's cute.\n\n01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:02.680\nSometimes you'll see a family of finches fly out of your pants.\n\n01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:03.680\nYeah.\n\n01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:05.320\nI wonder how it's a Jeep Butt.\n\n01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:08.080\nCould you have one of those, and then it goes away, and then it comes back, or something\n\n01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:09.080\nlike that?\n\n01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.000\nYeah, it's like a pimple.\n\n01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.160\nIn that, like, you know, it just- it'll get bigger, and then it'll pop, and then it'll\n\n01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:17.760\ngo away, or sometimes in rare cases it could get infected, like a pimple.\n\n01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:19.360\nYou know, like an opening in the skin.\n\n01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:21.560\nAnd this is something you had to get surgered.\n\n01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:26.040\nIt will- they recommended it, and we did it, but you don't need to.\n\n01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:27.520\nLike, it kind of depends.\n\n01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:31.160\nIt's a case by case basis, but essentially what they do is way worse, because it's like\n\n01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:36.440\nthis tiny hole in your skin on your butt, and what they do is they cut out like a wedge\n\n01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:37.440\nof it.\n\n01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:41.240\nIt's like, you know, when you transplant a plant, where you just take a huge scoop of\n\n01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:42.800\nearth out from around it.\n\n01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:45.600\nSo you have a slightly bigger butt than you used to?\n\n01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:50.600\nNo, because they seal it back together, and they literally use, like, glue, like this\n\n01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:53.360\ncrazy adhesive glue stuff, and they glue it back together.\n\n01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:58.080\nAll this feels like you just went to a weird frat party.\n\n01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:01.160\nI mean, arguably.\n\n01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:04.200\nIsn't doctoring fraternity?\n\n01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:07.480\nIs that your mom?\n\n01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:08.480\nI'm sure.\n\n01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:12.800\nA gal from the audience, it is a woman.\n\n01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:18.640\nSomebody's boasting that her nest of hair jeep butt pimple was worse than yours.\n\n01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:19.720\nI don't doubt that.\n\n01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:24.440\nSo they scoop out a hole, and then they, yeah, like glue it back together.\n\n01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:27.360\nDan, are you so interested in this because you want to be knocked out again?\n\n01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.160\nAre you looking for it?\n\n01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:31.480\nYou're wondering if you have a nest of hair.\n\n01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:34.720\nYeah, I am a nest of hair.\n\n01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:41.480\nOkay, all right, well, so you've been knocked out while I did that.\n\n01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:44.480\nDid you find it to be a profound experience?\n\n01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:45.480\nNo.\n\n01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:52.920\nIt's a lot like, I don't dream very often, I mean, everyone's going to be like, everybody\n\n01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:53.920\ndreams.\n\n01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:57.000\nI don't really, you know, dream, but I don't dream that much at all.\n\n01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.560\nYeah, like, it's not like it never happens, but you know, you guys are living your dreams\n\n01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:01.560\nwhen you're awake.\n\n01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:02.560\nOh, Dan.\n\n01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:05.560\nNo, I'm not even trying to be weird.\n\n01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:10.920\nWell, you succeeded, great.\n\n01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:11.920\nI don't know.\n\n01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:12.920\nThat's probably why.\n\n01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:13.920\nWhat?\n\n01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:14.920\nThat doesn't make it whatever.\n\n01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:16.360\nThe thing is, I get what you're saying.\n\n01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:20.080\nI think when you're dreaming, your brain's like getting off excess energy, and I feel\n\n01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:23.560\nlike if you're already using that when you're awake, maybe there's not as much to give off\n\n01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:24.560\nwhen you're asleep.\n\n01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:25.560\nWell, I like that.\n\n01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:29.320\nI like that a lot more than I thought it meant, what it meant initially.\n\n01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:30.640\nYour brain is dead.\n\n01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.640\nYeah.\n\n01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:32.640\nWell, just when you're asleep.\n\n01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:33.640\nYeah.\n\n01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:35.520\nBecause it's so awake when you're awake.\n\n01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:36.520\nThat's what he's saying.\n\n01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:37.520\nYeah.\n\n01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:40.200\nI dreamt that was Batman a couple of nights ago.\n\n01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:46.560\nNow, if we know your history of psychic stuff, does that mean that's going to happen?\n\n01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:49.200\nWait, but there was a crime that was committed.\n\n01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:50.200\nUh-oh.\n\n01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:51.200\nFucking tennis, dude.\n\n01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:54.200\nYou're just having an espresso at an Italian cafe.\n\n01:14:54.200 --> 01:15:00.080\nWe don't need you to sleep on another 9-11 here.\n\n01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:06.560\nI was Batman, and I was wrongly convicted of like a accuse of a crime that I didn't commit\n\n01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:11.080\nlike by a super villain maybe, and this is definitely, I had watched Robocop the night\n\n01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:17.240\nbefore, so I think this is a Robocop dream, but then I had to hide and dress like a regular\n\n01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:20.720\nperson and go through an airport, and I got held by security at an airport, so let's\n\n01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:21.720\nhelp the airport.\n\n01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:24.680\nThis is days ago, so we're all in the clear.\n\n01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:25.680\nOkay.\n\n01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:26.680\nCouple days ago.\n\n01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:27.680\nCan I plug something?\n\n01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:28.680\nYeah.\n\n01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:33.760\nIs it Spencer's nest of hair?\n\n01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:36.920\nIs that like a butt plug sort of play on words thing?\n\n01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:37.920\nYeah.\n\n01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:38.920\nI've had a few.\n\n01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:39.920\nDo people plug?\n\n01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:40.920\nThat's okay, right?\n\n01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:41.920\nYeah.\n\n01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:42.920\nGo ahead and plug.\n\n01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:45.760\nI had a special come out on Comedy Central.\n\n01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:46.760\nYou should.\n\n01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:47.760\nIt's called Beta Mail.\n\n01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:48.760\nGo to CC.\n\n01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:56.960\nIf you go to CCdirect.ComedyCentral.com, it's $5, that's the cheapest way to get it.\n\n01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:58.280\nOr you could torrent it.\n\n01:15:58.280 --> 01:15:59.280\nI don't care.\n\n01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:03.000\nI don't really get that money.\n\n01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.400\nSo people in back love torrenting.\n\n01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.400\nThat makes sense.\n\n01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:10.800\nThe people who got here later, they know the ropes.\n\n01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.920\nAnd you know, so this was a big deal for me when I was airing and I told my parents to\n\n01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:14.920\nwatch it.\n\n01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:16.560\nAnd the next day I got a text from my parents.\n\n01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:21.760\nThis is sort of shows what my relationship with them is like, it just said, saw your\n\n01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:22.760\nprogram.\n\n01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:29.760\nI think we may be brother and sister.\n\n01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:30.760\nYeah.\n\n01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:31.760\nIs it like that?\n\n01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.880\nDid you go back to the punch that happened when you were 12?\n\n01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.080\nWell, yeah, maybe.\n\n01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:38.080\nSo you woke up, you socked your mom, and was there a melee?\n\n01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.080\nDid she fire back?\n\n01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:40.080\nWas there a scuffle?\n\n01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:41.080\nI think she's still firing back.\n\n01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:42.080\nDid you follow up?\n\n01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:43.080\nDid you text back?\n\n01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:44.080\nNo, I didn't talk to them.\n\n01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:45.080\nWould I get an uppercut?\n\n01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:46.080\nNo.\n\n01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:47.080\nThe app is not your program.\n\n01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:52.080\nYeah, that was her punching back.\n\n01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:57.040\nI didn't talk to them for a week, and then I talked to them today, and it wasn't brought\n\n01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.040\nout.\n\n01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:02.440\nBut as a comedian, doing Letterman is the biggest thing you can do.\n\n01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:05.640\nAnd I was like, all right, I finally do something that they know what Letterman is.\n\n01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:06.640\nI do other shit.\n\n01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:10.400\nThey don't know very much about pop culture, but they know Letterman.\n\n01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.400\nSo I did Letterman.\n\n01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:15.440\nI talked to them on the phone, and they were like, hey, we saw you on Letterman.\n\n01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:19.760\nAnd then just told some story about my aunt.\n\n01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:22.080\nI was like, I don't know what's happening.\n\n01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:27.040\nWhat could you say to them that would make them very proud, in a sentence?\n\n01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:28.040\nI'm Muslim.\n\n01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:40.720\nAll right, Spencer, do you want to dispense the character sheets and get this D&D session\n\n01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:41.720\nunderway?\n\n01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:42.720\nYeah, sure.\n\n01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:43.720\nWhy not?\n\n01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:47.360\nAlso, while he does that, it's probably a good time to plug the fact that we're finally\n\n01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.800\ngetting that stuff underway.\n\n01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:51.520\nWe're recording.\n\n01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:59.080\nIt's called Harmon Quest right now, as we're recording this D&D thing that we've been\n\n01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:00.800\nalluding to forever.\n\n01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:06.840\nSpencer's Dungeon Mastering, we're playing D&D and recording the audio in front of a\n\n01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:12.840\nlive audience, just as we do here, only we're doing it on a little bit of a budget with\n\n01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:19.320\nsome of our favorite comedic cameo people at the Silent Movie Theater in combination\n\n01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:22.920\nwith screenings of crazy fantasy-themed movies.\n\n01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:27.240\nAnd then we're going to take the audio from the role-playing sessions, give it to my studio\n\n01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:31.600\nStar Burns, and they're going to stop motion animate the combat and stuff.\n\n01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:36.880\nIt's going to be an awesome movie.\n\n01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:41.080\nSo if you want to be part of that, check online.\n\n01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:42.240\nIt's called Harmon Quest.\n\n01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:43.240\nIt's at CineFamily.\n\n01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:45.720\nIt's being done in conjunction with CineFamily.\n\n01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:49.840\nThat's why we're doing the fantasy-themed movies and stuff.\n\n01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:52.160\nWhen's the first one coming up?\n\n01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.680\nThat's this coming Saturday.\n\n01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:54.680\nIs it really?\n\n01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:56.240\nIs there money?\n\n01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:59.200\nDoes it cost money to get in?\n\n01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:01.200\nHow much does it cost to get in?\n\n01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:02.200\n$80.\n\n01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:03.200\n$14.\n\n01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:04.200\n$14.\n\n01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:07.840\nThat's a bargain.\n\n01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:10.040\nBut if you're Anatoly, you make $38.\n\n01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:16.280\nYeah, you know, I was thinking about that, I put on like 60 episodes.\n\n01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:25.360\nNo, but yeah, www.CineFamily.org, that's www.CineFamily.org.\n\n01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:34.840\nI think the first one might be Excalibur.\n\n01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:35.840\nYeah.\n\n01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:36.840\nOh, the first film?\n\n01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:44.240\nThe first film is Excalibur, and the first guest is?\n\n01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:45.240\nAdam Sandler.\n\n01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:46.240\nIt's going to be there.\n\n01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:47.240\nNo shit.\n\n01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.920\nNow you have to get Adam Sandler.\n\n01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:54.480\nThe first guests, the first night's guests are Blake Anderson from Workaholics and Kumail\n\n01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:55.480\nNagyane.\n\n01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:56.480\nKumail Nagyane.\n\n01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:57.480\nFrom Conan O'Brien.\n\n01:19:57.480 --> 01:19:58.480\nAll right.\n\n01:19:58.480 --> 01:19:59.480\nWe plug that.\n\n01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:01.960\nSpencer, shall we get underway here?\n\n01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:02.960\nSure.\n\n01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:06.120\nDan, if you pass the sheets down, I will give Spencer his theme music and we can get this\n\n01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:10.280\nrolling.\n\n01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:19.440\nLast time our heroes were on the road to Farnheim to end their fight with Admiral Darkstar.\n\n01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:24.480\nAs they traveled north, they went up into the mountains towards Farnheim, the frozen\n\n01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:25.480\ncity.\n\n01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:31.200\nYerch had suggested they stop there to ask for an army or maybe horses or some form of\n\n01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:38.400\nother style aid from the city, and after many days there they trekked high up mountains\n\n01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:42.280\nand up onto a specific mountain range in particular.\n\n01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:50.280\nBut there they encountered a deadly blizzard, but through the driving snow and ice they\n\n01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:53.760\ncould see the white walls of the frozen fortress.\n\n01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:58.840\nThere was a bridge, quark suspicious, but Sharpie pushed on.\n\n01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:01.120\nThey started to cross the bridge.\n\n01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:04.200\nThey did not finish crossing the bridge.\n\n01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:07.840\nFrom afar the city fired cannons and skeletons landed in the ice.\n\n01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:11.720\nSharpie tried to reason, but quark leapt into action, tackling one of them, and the gang\n\n01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:12.720\nwas fighting.\n\n01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:18.160\nThe skeletons attacked with wicked blows, Morene understood the beast's rage, and looked\n\n01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:22.240\ninto its dead eyes in empathy.\n\n01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:28.080\nSharpie grasped one of the skeletons with a shocking grasp, surging electrical energy\n\n01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:32.840\nthrough its brittle bones, causing it to cause fire and fall on the floor.\n\n01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:34.940\nTwo skeletons remained.\n\n01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:36.520\nWhat would they do?\n\n01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:37.520\nCombat is happening.\n\n01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:38.520\nNow.\n\n01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:47.520\nAlright, two skeletons left.\n\n01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:48.520\nAlright.\n\n01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:49.520\nEasy.\n\n01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:51.520\nYeah, we're on an icy bridge.\n\n01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:52.520\nWho's up first Spencer?\n\n01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:56.320\nQuark, you were wrestling with one of them, you're currently wrestling him and you're\n\n01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.800\ntrying to throw him off the bridge.\n\n01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:01.680\nOkay, I just try to grapple him and just throw him off the side.\n\n01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:02.680\nYeah.\n\n01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:03.680\nAlright.\n\n01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:04.680\nThat happens.\n\n01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:05.680\nNice.\n\n01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:09.520\nGrappling with the skeleton, you get the upper hand.\n\n01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:11.360\nDid you just drop your, that's awesome.\n\n01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:12.360\nSorry.\n\n01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:16.040\nYou get the upper hand, you drop to the floor and then throw him over your shoulder and\n\n01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:21.240\nhe goes sailing off the white edge of the icy bridge, he's the abyss.\n\n01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:25.600\nI yelled, second!\n\n01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:27.880\nSome skeleton remains.\n\n01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:28.880\nWhose turn is it?\n\n01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:30.120\nThat'd be yours.\n\n01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:32.120\nOkay.\n\n01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:33.960\nHow close are we to the skeletons?\n\n01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:39.840\nYou're about 25 feet off, it's kind of engaged with mole rain right now and sharpie, but\n\n01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:40.840\nyou're a bit off.\n\n01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:41.840\nI'm a bit off?\n\n01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:42.840\nYeah.\n\n01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:43.840\nAlright, well.\n\n01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:44.840\nHe was always there.\n\n01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:45.840\nOkay.\n\n01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:48.360\nEverybody shut up.\n\n01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:51.960\nI do, I mean, I take my poison dagger, will that work?\n\n01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:54.680\nTake that poison dagger through my heart.\n\n01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:57.400\nOh, the poison won't, but the dagger won't.\n\n01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:58.400\nHuh?\n\n01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.960\nPoison doesn't work on undead.\n\n01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:02.120\nUh, while the dagger does.\n\n01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:03.640\nYeah, that's what I was saying.\n\n01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:04.640\nYeah.\n\n01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:05.640\nDefinitely.\n\n01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:06.640\nCool.\n\n01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:15.240\nSo I sneak attack the guy and just go to town.\n\n01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:18.480\nGoing to town on the guy with a sneak attack.\n\n01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:31.600\nYou strike directly between his shoulder blades, dealing 15 damage.\n\n01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:37.840\nI give Chris de Burgh a little, uh, chit, did you call it, like, uh, from AA.\n\n01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:44.360\nThat's one, one day of not tying a rope around your dagger when you throw it.\n\n01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:45.360\nYou know what?\n\n01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:47.160\nI thought about it a lot.\n\n01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:51.200\nI could see, but you spend the toughest day of my life.\n\n01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.600\nDid you call it a chit?\n\n01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:53.600\nI know.\n\n01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:59.040\nYeah, you get that little chit with a chip chip chip chip chip is a thing too.\n\n01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.040\nIs it?\n\n01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:01.040\nYeah.\n\n01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.040\nI don't know.\n\n01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:03.040\nGoogle it.\n\n01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:04.040\nYeah.\n\n01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:05.040\nIt's in your butt.\n\n01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.040\nI believe you guys.\n\n01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:07.040\nIs it, uh, is it almost dead?\n\n01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:09.440\nUh, you don't know it is undead.\n\n01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:12.680\nIt's a lot, but it's, what is it doing right now?\n\n01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:15.480\nIt's, it is, uh, you know, it's being stabbed.\n\n01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:17.560\nThere's a knife in it.\n\n01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:18.560\nOkay.\n\n01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:19.560\nIt's not like responding.\n\n01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:20.960\nHow is it reacting?\n\n01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.680\nIt's not like, it's not like a person that feels pain.\n\n01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:24.680\nIt's more like a skeleton.\n\n01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:25.680\nNo, not like a.\n\n01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:26.680\nI'm.\n\n01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:27.680\nIt's all right.\n\n01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:30.400\nThat's, you know, the skeletons are me.\n\n01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:33.400\nWe went over this.\n\n01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:34.400\nThat's a throwback.\n\n01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:35.880\nWho's, who's next?\n\n01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:37.400\nThat's Mulrainee's turn.\n\n01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:38.400\nAll right.\n\n01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:42.880\nUh, so I have no idea how the skeletons reacting.\n\n01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:51.000\nSo I'm going to just, uh, grapple, I'm going to, I'm going to grapple with the skeleton.\n\n01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:56.360\nI'm going to make eye contact with him and I'll say, thank you for your sacrifice.\n\n01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:59.160\nAnd I try to throw him off the bridge.\n\n01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.160\nOkay.\n\n01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:02.160\nDon't look at me, Dan.\n\n01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:07.240\nI just want to know like what, how, how, what, you wanted to know how the skeleton\n\n01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:09.000\nwas reacting before you did that?\n\n01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.560\nLike what would you have done?\n\n01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:15.920\nWell, I mean, if Camille did that and he was like, all right guys, come on, let's cool\n\n01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:16.920\nit.\n\n01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:17.920\nOh, okay.\n\n01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:18.920\nYou just wanted to make sure the monster wasn't.\n\n01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:19.920\nOkay.\n\n01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:20.920\nAll right.\n\n01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:21.920\nAll right.\n\n01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:22.920\nThat's a monster.\n\n01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:26.320\nOr if he, or if he was on the ground or if he was flying, I mean, I, Spencer's much smarter\n\n01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:27.320\nand better than I am.\n\n01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.680\nNo, that makes sense now that you explained it, but yeah.\n\n01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:30.680\nYeah.\n\n01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:35.920\nCan I, I also do a pink mass on it to make it gay in the after.\n\n01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:41.880\nDoes it, do they have to be dead for that?\n\n01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:47.520\nNo, I mean the, for the pink mass, I think you could do it in terms of Satanist ritualism.\n\n01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.520\nI think you could do it to someone who's alive, right?\n\n01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:53.440\nWell, I mean, couldn't they just be like, I'm going to be gay.\n\n01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:54.440\nYeah.\n\n01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:57.080\nAnd then they wouldn't need this whole satanic ritual.\n\n01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:58.080\nWho are the Satanists?\n\n01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.080\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:00.080\nThe pink mass.\n\n01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.080\nWhat is a pink mass?\n\n01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:02.080\nNo, that's it.\n\n01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:07.480\nThey were doing like a sort of protest on the grave of this lady making her gay in the\n\n01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:08.480\nafterlife.\n\n01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:09.480\nAnyway.\n\n01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:10.480\nIt happened in the show earlier on.\n\n01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:12.480\nThat doesn't happen in Dungeons and Dragons.\n\n01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:13.480\nIt fails.\n\n01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:17.520\nSo you're still, you're still straight.\n\n01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:19.520\nYeah, still straight.\n\n01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:20.520\nFuck.\n\n01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:23.600\nWhat, what happened with my grappling?\n\n01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:24.600\nYeah.\n\n01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:25.600\nOkay.\n\n01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:28.880\nSo you managed to wrestle it and you're trying to, trying to flip it over, you know, off the\n\n01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:29.880\nedge.\n\n01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:34.080\nBut you just, you guys go down to the floor and you're just kind of grappling with each\n\n01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:35.080\nother, wrestling style.\n\n01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:36.080\nSo I didn't.\n\n01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:41.360\nIt didn't, she didn't have enough force to send it over the edge.\n\n01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:42.360\nOkay.\n\n01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:44.480\nBut you know, it's down, it sits there.\n\n01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:46.080\nBut it's on me.\n\n01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:47.080\nYou're on it also.\n\n01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:48.080\nDefinitely still straight.\n\n01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:49.080\nIt's a mutual kerfuffle.\n\n01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:50.080\nDoes he have a boner?\n\n01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:51.080\nNo.\n\n01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:52.080\nYeah, I know.\n\n01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:53.080\nThat was my joke that he was a skeleton.\n\n01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:54.080\nYeah.\n\n01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:55.080\nSomeone in the audience says he's a skeleton.\n\n01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:56.080\nYeah.\n\n01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:01.160\nI'm sorry, I apologize.\n\n01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:02.160\nSo I'm on him.\n\n01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:03.160\nIt's not working though.\n\n01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:04.160\nYeah.\n\n01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:05.160\nHe doesn't have a boner.\n\n01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:06.160\nOkay.\n\n01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:07.160\nJust to clarify.\n\n01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:08.160\nPutting it in a sharpie.\n\n01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:09.400\nQuirk actually does have a boner.\n\n01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:12.280\nHe gets a boner, a bad boner sometimes.\n\n01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:13.280\nJust to clarify.\n\n01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.080\nI've got a battle boner.\n\n01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:16.080\nJust like an anger boner.\n\n01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:18.960\nIt's just the only one I'm in, only one I'm in battle.\n\n01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:21.880\nOr when you want to fuck a horse or whatever.\n\n01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:25.280\nOh yeah.\n\n01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:26.280\nSaddle battle.\n\n01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:27.280\nPutting it.\n\n01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:28.280\nSaddle boner.\n\n01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:29.280\nSaddle boner.\n\n01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:33.000\nAll right.\n\n01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.280\nI can't use shrink item on a skeleton that's only an item, right?\n\n01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:37.280\nThat's correct.\n\n01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:40.240\nDo I have any shocking grasps left?\n\n01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:41.240\nYeah.\n\n01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:42.240\nYeah.\n\n01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:45.080\nOn your trek you gain back all your spells and you've only used one of them.\n\n01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:46.080\nAll right.\n\n01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:51.040\nBut isn't that also, if he's grappling with her, isn't that going to shock both of them?\n\n01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:53.480\nWho knows?\n\n01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:56.440\nYou've got to do it.\n\n01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.080\nLet's see what happens.\n\n01:27:58.080 --> 01:27:59.080\nIt's magic.\n\n01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:00.080\nAll right.\n\n01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:08.320\nI initiate my shocking grasp and then I say something involving bones.\n\n01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:09.320\nSome kind of pun.\n\n01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:10.320\nA pun?\n\n01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:11.320\nBone.\n\n01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:12.320\nYou're a bone.\n\n01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:13.320\nBone out.\n\n01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:14.320\nBone to know you.\n\n01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:15.320\nBone to know you.\n\n01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:16.320\nBone viash.\n\n01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:17.320\nAdam Goldberg.\n\n01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:18.320\nAdam Goldberg.\n\n01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:19.320\nAdam Goldberg.\n\n01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:20.320\nAdam Goldberg.\n\n01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:21.320\nTake a bow.\n\n01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:22.320\nStand up.\n\n01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:23.320\nAdam Goldberg.\n\n01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:24.320\nBone viash.\n\n01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:25.320\nThat's fantastic.\n\n01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:31.320\nIt could have been her all night and not top bone viash.\n\n01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:33.320\nNo, that you would not be.\n\n01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:35.320\nI was like, hey, mandible shit.\n\n01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:36.320\nYeah.\n\n01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:37.320\nYeah.\n\n01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:39.320\nDanzel is bone to know you.\n\n01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:45.320\nThis has never been my wheelhouse puns, but bone viash.\n\n01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.320\nYeah.\n\n01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:56.200\nI do it with an Austrian accent, bone viash and grasping him with a shocking energy.\n\n01:28:56.200 --> 01:29:01.760\nElectricity crackles through his bony body and you hear a sizzling from deep within\n\n01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:08.920\nhis chest and then he catches fire and falls to the floor inert.\n\n01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:18.920\nBricks like he, Skeleton fell apart.\n\n01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:19.920\nYou can't improvise a pun.\n\n01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:20.920\nCan you?\n\n01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:21.920\nHe fell like a Skeleton.\n\n01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:22.920\nYou can't.\n\n01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:23.920\nBricks.\n\n01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:24.920\nYou can't.\n\n01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:25.920\nI win.\n\n01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:26.920\nI count it.\n\n01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:27.920\nI count it.\n\n01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:28.920\nI get 500 experience points.\n\n01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:29.920\nHe gave himself.\n\n01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:30.920\nI'm having my own podcast over here.\n\n01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:31.920\nIt's high time.\n\n01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:32.920\nWell, we did it.\n\n01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:40.920\nSo we did it.\n\n01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:43.920\nI forge on towards the far side of the bridge.\n\n01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:47.920\nYou forge on towards the far side of the bridge.\n\n01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:54.920\nYou see the gates of Fornheim standing tall and imperious.\n\n01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:59.920\nThey slowly grind open and you can hear a voice from within echo out like a trumpet.\n\n01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:01.920\nWelcome to Fornheim.\n\n01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:03.920\nThe fortress of the mighty.\n\n01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:05.920\nThe land of the strong.\n\n01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:06.920\nI call back.\n\n01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:07.920\nWeirdest welcome ever.\n\n01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:08.920\nThere's no response.\n\n01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:11.920\nHuge waste of energy and manpower.\n\n01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:23.920\nThat would be funny if every time you drove into Indiana, you'd hear, welcome to Indiana.\n\n01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:24.920\nThe sunshine.\n\n01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:25.920\nThis is it.\n\n01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:30.920\nBut also like if there was a locked gate that only opened after you fought for Skeletons.\n\n01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:33.920\nI mean, just lock the gate harder.\n\n01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:35.920\nMake signals here again.\n\n01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:39.920\nMake it clearer that we're not welcome.\n\n01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:40.920\nMetagaming?\n\n01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:43.920\nI mean, no, mate.\n\n01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:45.920\nAll right, well, we go in.\n\n01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:46.920\nWe go in.\n\n01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:47.920\nWe go in.\n\n01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:48.920\nGood call.\n\n01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:53.920\nYeah, you enter the walls of Fornheim and you see stuff.\n\n01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:56.920\nI look around to see whether.\n\n01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:58.920\nYeah, sorry.\n\n01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:00.920\nI'll go.\n\n01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:03.920\nAs you enter the massive gates, you're met with an awesome sight.\n\n01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:08.920\nThe massive city within the massive walls is full of massively oversized buildings.\n\n01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:14.920\nWith paths as wide as ponds and houses as big as castles as well as towering giants.\n\n01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:20.920\nThese blue-skinned beings with coarse pale blonde and icy hair stand about 15 to 20 feet tall.\n\n01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:26.920\nClanking around in heavy metal armor, talking, conducting in business and are shooting the breeze.\n\n01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:28.920\nLiterally.\n\n01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:33.920\nIn sharp contrast to the massive blue figures and icy white trails, or in icy white walls,\n\n01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:35.920\nyou can make out specks dot around the city.\n\n01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:39.920\nBlack blobs that you recognize as more of those Skeletons you fought earlier.\n\n01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:44.920\nThey're marching and patrolling the streets as well as manning the gates and guarding the walls.\n\n01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:48.920\nI thought this was like a dwarf town.\n\n01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:50.920\nI got confused.\n\n01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:54.920\nYeah, maybe we should have done a little more reconnaissance before we came into this place.\n\n01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:56.920\nThat's something you can do.\n\n01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:58.920\nMaybe we should get on top of each other's shoulders.\n\n01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:00.920\nAnd put on a giant trench coat?\n\n01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:01.920\nYeah.\n\n01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:05.920\nAnd hold our breath through a blue in the face?\n\n01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:07.920\nSo why are we in this town? I'm sorry.\n\n01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:10.920\nBecause the guy went, welcome. And we said, let's go. And now we're in here.\n\n01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:12.920\nNo, no, no. But like, before that.\n\n01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:13.920\nYeah, before that.\n\n01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:14.920\nOh, we're looking for Admiral Darkstar.\n\n01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:15.920\nOkay.\n\n01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:17.920\nYeah, he's to the north and this is on your way to the north.\n\n01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:18.920\nHe's a bad guy.\n\n01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:20.920\nWell, we were talking about raising an army here.\n\n01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:21.920\nRight.\n\n01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:23.920\nThat should be no sweat.\n\n01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:25.920\nWe just killed a couple of their homies out front, didn't we?\n\n01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:28.920\nBut it seems like that's how you open the door.\n\n01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:30.920\nYeah, maybe, yeah.\n\n01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:33.920\nWho's the biggest and baddest here?\n\n01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:38.920\nLike, let's walk in there and talk a big game and say, look, we're not here to fuck around.\n\n01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:42.920\nWe're here to get an army together and go kill Admiral Darkstar.\n\n01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:47.920\nI can use my, I mean, in a different way, I could use my diplomacy.\n\n01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:48.920\nTry to talk to them.\n\n01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:49.920\nOkay.\n\n01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:51.920\nBut who do we talk to?\n\n01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:52.920\nCan we walk?\n\n01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:55.920\nYeah, I look for the sweetest faced giant.\n\n01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:56.920\nOkay.\n\n01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:02.920\nWell, some guy who's clearly like nicer than the other, that's like giving water to the\n\n01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:03.920\nsmaller giants.\n\n01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:06.920\nI'm just laughing.\n\n01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:07.920\nSomeone drops a hat.\n\n01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:09.920\nHe gives them their hat.\n\n01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:15.920\nScanning the city, you see what you make out to be the most jovial of the giants.\n\n01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:18.920\nBut not in anyone else's expense.\n\n01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:22.920\nHe's not laughing because he's picking on them.\n\n01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:23.920\nRight, right, right.\n\n01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:24.920\nOkay.\n\n01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:25.920\nJust making sure.\n\n01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:27.920\nI mean, that's fine.\n\n01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:28.920\nYou see him.\n\n01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:30.920\nHe looks jovial.\n\n01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:31.920\nOkay.\n\n01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:33.920\nDo you guys mind if I approach?\n\n01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:34.920\nKnock yourself out?\n\n01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:35.920\nYeah.\n\n01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:36.920\nWe'll be back here.\n\n01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:37.920\nOkay.\n\n01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:40.920\nNo, I go with her because we still have our little buddy pack.\n\n01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:41.920\nYes, thank you.\n\n01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:44.920\nI go with her because I wouldn't miss this for the world.\n\n01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:51.920\nI put on a shirt that says Team Giant on it and I walked there.\n\n01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:56.920\nAaron talking to a non-player character is like every time the smoking man showed up\n\n01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:57.920\nin X-Files.\n\n01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:00.920\nI am riveted.\n\n01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:05.920\nYeah, so you and Quark are kind of walking up?\n\n01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:07.920\nWell, we'll all go.\n\n01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:08.920\nOkay.\n\n01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:10.920\nYou're all walking up.\n\n01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:12.920\nHello, sir.\n\n01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:19.920\nHe's like, you're closer to heaven.\n\n01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:22.920\nHow does the joke land?\n\n01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:29.920\nThe giant looks as if perhaps he was bit by a mosquito, sort of like a...\n\n01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:31.920\nAnd this is the happiest guy.\n\n01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:32.920\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:39.920\nAnd then he kind of looks around and then he looks down at you and then he points at\n\n01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:42.920\nyou and he's like...\n\n01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:43.920\nIt landed, it landed.\n\n01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:44.920\nYeah, I think it landed.\n\n01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:45.920\nYou got a chuckle.\n\n01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:47.920\nHey, good one.\n\n01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:52.920\nBoy, since I was a young girl, I have dreamt of being in a town like this.\n\n01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:57.920\nWhat is it like to be the most fantastic looking...\n\n01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:00.920\nOkay, guys, what do I do?\n\n01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:02.920\nNo, no, you're doing great.\n\n01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:03.920\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:05.920\nFinish the fantastic looking thing.\n\n01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:08.920\nYou got it right where you want them.\n\n01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:14.920\nOr what is it like to be the most fantastic looking and...\n\n01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:15.920\nYou emanate this joy.\n\n01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:18.920\nAnd me and my friends were very nice, peaceful people.\n\n01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:21.920\nAnd we just wanted to know what was happening here.\n\n01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:23.920\nAnd I've been talking for too long and this is what I do.\n\n01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:26.920\nAnd I drop my papers like in a romantic comedy.\n\n01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:29.920\nAnd I hope that he's going to pick them up.\n\n01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:33.920\nBecause I'm like, I'm Meg Ryan and I'm just so flustered.\n\n01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:35.920\nOh, I'm such a clumsy bitch.\n\n01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:37.920\nWhat do I do?\n\n01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:45.920\nDoes he help her with the papers?\n\n01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:50.920\nNo, his hands are probably too big to pick them up.\n\n01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:55.920\nBut he doesn't help with the papers.\n\n01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:59.920\nSir Giant, we are travelers from the south heading north.\n\n01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:03.920\nAnd whoa, but did we stop here?\n\n01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:05.920\nMr. Happy?\n\n01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:12.920\nI'm Robin Williams.\n\n01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:17.920\nWe are in pursuit of a threat that threatens all of...\n\n01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:19.920\nWhat's this planet called?\n\n01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:20.920\nEarth.\n\n01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:25.920\nEarth.\n\n01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:28.920\nI'm kind of standing behind all of them\n\n01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:33.920\nand just instinctively grabbed the handle of my sword.\n\n01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:39.920\nI should tell them that I'm like a very well-known singer-songwriter.\n\n01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:42.920\nI move my hands like I'm about to take off my tiny little clothes.\n\n01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:47.920\nWe request an audience with your leader, if you have one,\n\n01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:50.920\nor the commission that leads you.\n\n01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:52.920\nBut you're probably the leader, right?\n\n01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:54.920\nI mean, he looks like the leader.\n\n01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:58.920\nEither that or a model.\n\n01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:02.920\nHe kind of just looks at you guys all saying and doing these things\n\n01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:04.920\nand describing, saying and doing.\n\n01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:05.920\nCan he not hear us?\n\n01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:08.920\nNo, he is. He's exactly hearing you right now,\n\n01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:09.920\nand I'm describing that.\n\n01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:11.920\nAnd he is hearing.\n\n01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:13.920\nHe's like, yeah, but he's listening,\n\n01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:16.920\nand he's looking at you guys, do stuff.\n\n01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:21.920\nAnd then he's like, so, you're looking for the yarrow.\n\n01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:22.920\nYeah, that's it.\n\n01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:24.920\nWe're looking for the yarrow.\n\n01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:25.920\nThat's it.\n\n01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:27.920\nI don't even know why we forgot the word for it.\n\n01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:28.920\nThat's exactly right.\n\n01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:31.920\nWe should have said that when we first showed up.\n\n01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:36.920\nWell, it ain't just anyone that can see the yarrow.\n\n01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:39.920\nOkay, yeah, who can see the yarrow?\n\n01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:41.920\nOnly the strong.\n\n01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:44.920\nDid you hear that thing that was said when you entered the city?\n\n01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:50.920\nNo, we were busy mocking it.\n\n01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:51.920\nWe are strong.\n\n01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:53.920\nWe slayed a couple of...\n\n01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:56.920\nTell him that!\n\n01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:00.920\nDire wolves.\n\n01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:03.920\nGood save, bro.\n\n01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:08.920\nYeah, yes, I've plucked many a dire wolf from my garden.\n\n01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:11.920\nI don't think he knows what the word means.\n\n01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:13.920\nHe grows wolves.\n\n01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:15.920\nThis guy rocks!\n\n01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:19.920\nCan we just hang out with him for a while?\n\n01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:22.920\nWell, if there was a way that we could prove our strengths,\n\n01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:24.920\nother than getting in your...\n\n01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:26.920\nNot to put too fine a point on it,\n\n01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:31.920\nthen a hospitable threshold.\n\n01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:35.920\nTough, tough ice city.\n\n01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:37.920\nWe would love to prove our strengths\n\n01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:40.920\nand or just have our strengths taken as a flier\n\n01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:45.920\nand get an audience with a four mention yarrow.\n\n01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:49.920\nAlso, if you Giants enjoy a show by tiny people,\n\n01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:52.920\nmaybe the four of us could put on a small show.\n\n01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:53.920\nIt's true.\n\n01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:55.920\nWe are singer-songwriters.\n\n01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:58.920\nI've recently gotten into doing some sketch comedy stuff.\n\n01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:01.920\nI've heard enough of this as the barbarian.\n\n01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:05.920\nI'm as tough as any man here.\n\n01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:07.920\nGiants or no.\n\n01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:12.920\nThen prove it.\n\n01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:14.920\nOh, show me the way.\n\n01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:15.920\nPunch me, punch me.\n\n01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:20.920\nOkay, I go up to a quirk and I go,\n\n01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:25.920\nhey, insolent person, and I'm winking at him.\n\n01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:27.920\nWe're gonna do like a Star Trek movie.\n\n01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:28.920\nI got you.\n\n01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:31.920\nHey, shut your mouth, you little fucker.\n\n01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:33.920\nI'm one of the 12 different planets.\n\n01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:36.920\nYeah, well, you're not so tough.\n\n01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:37.920\nYou're not so tough.\n\n01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:38.920\nAnd I get in there and I say,\n\n01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:39.920\nno, lay off him.\n\n01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:41.920\nI drop my papers again.\n\n01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:46.920\nStop that.\n\n01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:48.920\nI can't help it.\n\n01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:51.920\nI take Sharpie and I give him a little wink.\n\n01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:54.920\nI return the wink and I pick him up over my head\n\n01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:55.920\nand start spinning him around.\n\n01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:57.920\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:00.920\nThis guy's a real tough customer.\n\n01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:05.920\nAnd then I take him and I find the biggest,\n\n01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:07.920\nthe biggest busiest ice road\n\n01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:10.920\nand I throw him down like I got a roadhouse bar top.\n\n01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:12.920\nI just slide him down.\n\n01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:17.920\nBut I'm so much bigger than you.\n\n01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:18.920\nBunk.\n\n01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:20.920\nIn the chaos, I go off in the corner\n\n01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:25.920\nand I tie a rope to a knife.\n\n01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:26.920\nBe prepared.\n\n01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:28.920\nAlways be prepared.\n\n01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:29.920\nOkay.\n\n01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:35.920\nYeah, you attempt this display of mock violence\n\n01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:38.920\nand it's really pitiful.\n\n01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:41.920\nLike it's not working.\n\n01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:43.920\nIt's not working.\n\n01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:48.920\nAnd then he throws you and you go skidding down this ice road\n\n01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:52.920\nand then he's like, that's pretty tough.\n\n01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:53.920\nI got it.\n\n01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:55.920\nWait, when I throw Sharpie?\n\n01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:56.920\nYeah.\n\n01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:57.920\nOh, he likes that.\n\n01:40:57.920 --> 01:40:59.920\nAs pitiful as it was, it seemed to have impressed him.\n\n01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:01.920\nSo now we go to see the arm?\n\n01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:03.920\nHe's like, yeah, you know, I mean,\n\n01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:05.920\nif you guys are really that tough,\n\n01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:07.920\nbut you might have to pull that shit again\n\n01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:09.920\nin front of some other giants.\n\n01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:12.920\nOh, I got bit.\n\n01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:20.920\nI think we just accidentally blew the roadie.\n\n01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:21.920\nClassic.\n\n01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:22.920\nClassic mistake.\n\n01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:23.920\nClassic.\n\n01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:26.920\nReal amateur move.\n\n01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:29.920\nPink Floyd's in the green room.\n\n01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:31.920\nLead the way, sir.\n\n01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:33.920\nHe's like, I don't lead.\n\n01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:35.920\nFollow the silent servants.\n\n01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:38.920\nHe kind of points at a line of skeletons\n\n01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:40.920\nthat are kind of patrolling through the city.\n\n01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:44.920\nLead by one of these skeletons is just a blaze on fire.\n\n01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:46.920\nHe's just lit on fire.\n\n01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:47.920\nI say, thank you, sir.\n\n01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:49.920\nYou are truly the most joyous creature\n\n01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:52.920\nthat we have encountered in a long time.\n\n01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:54.920\nSo does a skeleton on fire?\n\n01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:56.920\nYeah, it's kind of walking around through the city,\n\n01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:59.920\nmelt nice and snow, and there's a column of steam\n\n01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:00.920\nkind of rising off of it.\n\n01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:01.920\nCool.\n\n01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:03.920\nAnd you're just walking in a line.\n\n01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:05.920\nAll right, well, we should follow that.\n\n01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:06.920\nYep.\n\n01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:07.920\nOkay.\n\n01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:08.920\nDo you still have your Giants T-shirt on?\n\n01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:10.920\nYeah, I have Team Giants,\n\n01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:13.920\nand I've added Blazing Skeleton also.\n\n01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:14.920\nAnd on the back, it says,\n\n01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:19.920\nmy favorite movie is Ghost Rider.\n\n01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:21.920\nI started whistling the theme\n\n01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:24.920\nfrom Bridge over the River Kwai.\n\n01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:30.920\nWait, you were singing when you whistled?\n\n01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:31.920\nWell, I don't know how to whistle.\n\n01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:33.920\nI can't whistle either.\n\n01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:34.920\nHigh five?\n\n01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:35.920\nYeah.\n\n01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:37.920\nSo few people don't know how to whistle.\n\n01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:39.920\nAnyone can whistle.\n\n01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:40.920\nNo.\n\n01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:43.920\nBut that's a different story.\n\n01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:45.920\nSo we're following these silent leaders.\n\n01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:46.920\nSilent, whatever.\n\n01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:48.920\nYeah, yeah, the silent servants.\n\n01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:50.920\nThey're just kind of...\n\n01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:54.920\nYou really can't control this group.\n\n01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:56.920\nI can't really whistle.\n\n01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:03.920\nWhistling.\n\n01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:06.920\nThat was a great try, Dan.\n\n01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:08.920\nHey, it's us or hang out with your dad.\n\n01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:09.920\nYou pick.\n\n01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:16.920\nHey, man.\n\n01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:18.920\nI walk up to one of the silent servants\n\n01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:20.920\nand say, excuse me, gentlemen,\n\n01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:22.920\nwe're looking for Jarl.\n\n01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:23.920\nYou be so kind.\n\n01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:25.920\nYou saw what I did to my friend over here.\n\n01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:28.920\nI threw him a good 50 meters down the ice road.\n\n01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:29.920\nSee.\n\n01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:30.920\nMake it snappy and show us the way.\n\n01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:31.920\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:32.920\nDon't be aggressive.\n\n01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:34.920\nThey respond to might here.\n\n01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:36.920\nIt's head kind of turns towards you\n\n01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:39.920\nand its eyes kind of like glow with a blue flame\n\n01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:41.920\nand you can hear a voice out of its chest.\n\n01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:43.920\nIt's tinny and mechanical sounding.\n\n01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:47.920\nIt says, don't bother the silent servants.\n\n01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:50.920\nI was just told to come over to you.\n\n01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:51.920\nWell, they're walking.\n\n01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:52.920\nWe just follow.\n\n01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:53.920\nWe follow.\n\n01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:54.920\nOkay, we're following.\n\n01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:55.920\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:56.920\nSorry.\n\n01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:57.920\nThat's happened.\n\n01:43:57.920 --> 01:43:58.920\nI was just trying to be tough.\n\n01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:00.920\nI want to get one of those chess plate things for me\n\n01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:02.920\nso that when I fart...\n\n01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:06.920\nIt wasn't this person.\n\n01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:08.920\nSome people think you're chest farted.\n\n01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:10.920\nIt's like blaming it on the dog.\n\n01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:11.920\nYou know, you fart and then...\n\n01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:13.920\nOh, so it was me.\n\n01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:14.920\nThe chest plate.\n\n01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:17.920\nI thought when you fart, it just emits a louder mechanical fart\n\n01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:18.920\nto hide.\n\n01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:19.920\nI didn't think it through.\n\n01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:20.920\nI just...\n\n01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:23.920\nThe dots I was connecting were in this order.\n\n01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:25.920\nSilent but deadly.\n\n01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:26.920\nSilent.\n\n01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:27.920\nSilent servants.\n\n01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:28.920\nSilent servants.\n\n01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:29.920\nI kind of...\n\n01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:31.920\nAnd then from there I was off-roading.\n\n01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:35.920\nI was relying on the statistical chance of me being funny when I talked.\n\n01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:39.920\nAnd I blew it, as I do seven out of ten times.\n\n01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:40.920\nNo.\n\n01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:41.920\nSo we're following.\n\n01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:43.920\nThere's a lot of math to it.\n\n01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:44.920\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:45.920\nIt's impressive.\n\n01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:48.920\nDan, have you been blaming it on the dog?\n\n01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:49.920\nWe have a dog.\n\n01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:50.920\nAnd it farts a lot.\n\n01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:51.920\nYeah.\n\n01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:54.920\nAnd I have ramped up my farting.\n\n01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:55.920\nIt's true.\n\n01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:56.920\nYou have.\n\n01:44:56.920 --> 01:45:04.920\nWhen Dan was getting his endoscopy, there was a page in the big stack of papers that\n\n01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:07.920\nhe had assigned that said...\n\n01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:10.920\nWhen the camera goes down, it pushes a lot of air through you.\n\n01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:13.920\nSo you make sure you release the air.\n\n01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:14.920\nOh, pre-fart.\n\n01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:15.920\nYeah.\n\n01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:18.920\nIt was giving you permission to fart, like thing.\n\n01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:20.920\nThis isn't either the time or the place.\n\n01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:21.920\nAll right.\n\n01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:23.920\nSo we're following the silent servant.\n\n01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:24.920\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:28.920\nAnd they take you around through the city, and you're kind of going by these little snowed\n\n01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:33.080\nin little, like, huts that are weird because, you know, this is a giant city, and these\n\n01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:34.920\nhuts wouldn't fit them.\n\n01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:35.920\nAnyway.\n\n01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:36.920\nBut the skeletons are normal size, right?\n\n01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:37.920\nThat's true.\n\n01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:38.920\nDo they have doors?\n\n01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:39.920\nThey...\n\n01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:43.320\nYou can't tell because they're just covered in snow past the door, like, up to their little\n\n01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:44.320\nroofs.\n\n01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:45.320\nCome on.\n\n01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:46.320\nI...\n\n01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:47.320\nI stop at one.\n\n01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:48.320\nCome on.\n\n01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:49.320\nOkay.\n\n01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:50.320\nI mean...\n\n01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:51.320\nI brush some snow away.\n\n01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:52.320\nI'm looking for a little door.\n\n01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:53.320\nIt has a little door.\n\n01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:59.320\nI'm going to knock on the door with my Gandalf staff.\n\n01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:01.320\nThere's no response.\n\n01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:04.320\nI'll be back later.\n\n01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:05.320\nContinuing on.\n\n01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:06.320\nYou go...\n\n01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:09.320\nAnd you got balls, man.\n\n01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:11.320\nYou know, that was a great, like...\n\n01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:12.320\nWhat is it called?\n\n01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:13.320\nDing and ditch?\n\n01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:14.320\nWhat's it called?\n\n01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:15.320\nYeah, ding-dong ditch.\n\n01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:16.320\nYeah.\n\n01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:17.320\nDing and ditch.\n\n01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:18.320\nWe didn't do that in Pakistan.\n\n01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:19.320\nThere's no dong.\n\n01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:20.320\nNo.\n\n01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:22.320\nIt's a ding and ditch.\n\n01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:23.320\nDing!\n\n01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:24.320\nRun away.\n\n01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:28.320\nYou have to be in an actual ditch.\n\n01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:31.320\nDo doorbells sound different in Pakistan?\n\n01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:32.320\nUh...\n\n01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:33.320\nI...\n\n01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:34.320\nWe...\n\n01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:35.320\nI don't know.\n\n01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:36.320\nNo?\n\n01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:37.320\nThe same?\n\n01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:38.320\nOkay.\n\n01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:39.320\nYeah.\n\n01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:40.320\nI was just wondering.\n\n01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:41.320\nYeah, they're not like...\n\n01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:42.320\nBecause they're animals.\n\n01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:43.320\nThey're not like...\n\n01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:44.320\nNo.\n\n01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:45.320\nI mean sirens...\n\n01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:46.320\nSirens sound...\n\n01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:48.320\nSirens sound different in every country.\n\n01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:50.320\nThey just say death to America when I...\n\n01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:52.320\nDeath to America?\n\n01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:53.320\nDeath to America?\n\n01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:54.320\nI guess they're not home.\n\n01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:56.320\nOh, somebody's here.\n\n01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:57.320\nAlright, so we're following?\n\n01:46:57.320 --> 01:46:58.320\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:04.320\nYou go up a massive icy staircase and into a large kind of castle within the city made\n\n01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:05.320\nout of ice.\n\n01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:09.320\nIt's all ice.\n\n01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:13.320\nYou arrive in a massive room with a ceiling hundreds of feet tall.\n\n01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:14.320\nUh...\n\n01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:15.320\nHi.\n\n01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:16.320\nWhatever.\n\n01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:21.640\nMassive gold statues line the room and standing in the center of the statues is a massive\n\n01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:24.640\nblue giant, easily 30 feet tall.\n\n01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:31.720\nHe wears a great magenta breastplate and wears a huge brown fur cloak off some oversized\n\n01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:32.720\nbeast.\n\n01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:35.320\nHis booming voice echoes through the icy chamber.\n\n01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:39.320\nI am Lim Dahl, the Jarl of Fordheim.\n\n01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:42.320\nBow to my might!\n\n01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:47.320\nUh, pretending to have met him previously, I scream out, so nice to see you again!\n\n01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:49.320\nBow to his fucking might!\n\n01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:50.320\nYeah.\n\n01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:52.320\nMaybe he'll think that we know each other.\n\n01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:55.320\nI bow to his might for sure.\n\n01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:58.320\nI say this as I am bowing to his might.\n\n01:47:58.320 --> 01:47:59.320\nOkay.\n\n01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:02.320\nI definitely blew the roadie.\n\n01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:04.320\nI bow to his might.\n\n01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:05.320\nOkay.\n\n01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:06.320\nI reluctantly bow.\n\n01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:07.320\nI can...\n\n01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:09.320\nThank you.\n\n01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:12.320\nMight bow to...\n\n01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:16.320\nAnd for that, I thank you.\n\n01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:19.320\nGratitude received.\n\n01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:21.320\nWhat brings you to Fordheim?\n\n01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:24.320\nThe frozen city.\n\n01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:30.320\nIt's like an OCD thing, but he has to say the entire thing.\n\n01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:35.320\nIt's on their license plate frame, I don't know.\n\n01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:39.320\nWe're looking for some Yalmars.\n\n01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:40.320\nYalars.\n\n01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:41.320\nWait, what?\n\n01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:42.320\nYakars.\n\n01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:43.320\nYalars?\n\n01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:44.320\nJarl!\n\n01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:45.320\nHe's the Jarl!\n\n01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:46.320\nJarl is the king.\n\n01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:47.320\nJarl means king.\n\n01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:48.320\nJarl is king.\n\n01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:51.320\nAs I'm following to my knees, I say, I'll never fall in love.\n\n01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:53.320\nMy career is too important.\n\n01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:57.320\nShe keeps dropping papers.\n\n01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:58.320\nWhat's on these...\n\n01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:01.320\nI pick up the papers and what the fuck is on these things?\n\n01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:03.320\nI read your papers.\n\n01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:07.320\nHe says, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.\n\n01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:09.320\nOver and over.\n\n01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:11.320\nAnd we're terrified.\n\n01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:13.320\nI didn't really realize he was a Yaller.\n\n01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:16.320\nOh, Jarl of Farnheim!\n\n01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:17.320\nFrozen city!\n\n01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:18.320\nYaller?\n\n01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:19.320\nJarl!\n\n01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:20.320\nJarl!\n\n01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:22.320\nI know, I'm sorry.\n\n01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:27.320\nGateway to the mountains.\n\n01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:30.320\nA great city by a great lake.\n\n01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:35.320\nThe blue diamond of the north.\n\n01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:40.320\nOld Snowy.\n\n01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:43.320\nIt is our grand pleasure.\n\n01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:48.320\nA pleasure exceeded in size only by your stature and might.\n\n01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:53.320\nThat we arrive here in your slippery, sticky halls.\n\n01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:56.320\nIn a good way, in a good way.\n\n01:49:56.320 --> 01:50:01.320\nI am overcome by your power and I fall down.\n\n01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:04.320\nI drop one paper.\n\n01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:12.320\nOne would no more dare to offend thee than one would dare to stick one's tongue on a common surface.\n\n01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:15.320\nHave you seen Christmas story?\n\n01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:17.320\nI take out my sword and...\n\n01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:19.320\nNo, bro!\n\n01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:21.320\nAnd I...\n\n01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:25.320\nPardon me, but can I cleave my way through all the bullshit?\n\n01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:28.320\nWhoa!\n\n01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:29.320\nOh boy.\n\n01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:31.320\nFonzie's in town.\n\n01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:34.320\nAnd I put my sword back away with a whoop.\n\n01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:35.320\nHe puts it away.\n\n01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:36.320\nOh yeah, I took it out.\n\n01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:38.320\nI'm not going to walk around with it out.\n\n01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:39.320\nYou just took it out.\n\n01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:40.320\nI took it out too.\n\n01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:41.320\nYou're just trying to cut the recta.\n\n01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:42.320\nI was making a point.\n\n01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:44.320\nHe regards your social maneuver.\n\n01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:45.320\nGreat.\n\n01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:47.320\nListen, Limdol, was it?\n\n01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:48.320\nLimdol.\n\n01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:50.320\nMy name is Quark Pfft.\n\n01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:51.320\nWell met.\n\n01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:56.320\nMy friends and I are, after a certain Admiral Darkstar, are you familiar with this gentleman?\n\n01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:59.320\nOh, I'm familiar with this gentleman.\n\n01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:01.320\nWhich you take?\n\n01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:07.320\nI'm not a fond of him.\n\n01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:08.320\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:10.320\nBut we're saying that he's the worst.\n\n01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:12.320\nYou saw the air quotes around gentlemen, right?\n\n01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:13.320\nYeah.\n\n01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:14.320\nRight, right.\n\n01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:19.320\nWell, we have one mission and one mission alone, and it's to take him down.\n\n01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:25.320\nWe could certainly use a little assistance, because as you see, we're just four tiny little fuckers.\n\n01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:27.320\nYou could use some assistance.\n\n01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:28.320\nI just said that.\n\n01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:31.320\nBut you have something I could use.\n\n01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:32.320\nOh, okay.\n\n01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:33.320\nGreat.\n\n01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:34.320\nThis is going to be great.\n\n01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:36.320\nWhat's the expression on his face right now, Spencer?\n\n01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:39.320\nIt's holding all the cards.\n\n01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:41.320\nIt's an expression.\n\n01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:42.320\nFair enough.\n\n01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:44.320\nWhat is it you want from us?\n\n01:51:44.320 --> 01:51:49.320\nOh, just a few of your fragments of power.\n\n01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:51.320\nOh, boy.\n\n01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:53.320\nCan we have a sidebar?\n\n01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:58.320\nGentlemen, do you think he's talking about my business papers?\n\n01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:00.320\nI think we should definitely try.\n\n01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:01.320\nOkay.\n\n01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:02.320\nThere was no business.\n\n01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:04.320\nOne page was just a bunch of drawings of Dixon balls.\n\n01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:12.320\nLook, I'm going to be a magazine editor, executive business merger lady some day, and I've got to take all my ladies.\n\n01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:13.320\nOkay, stopping.\n\n01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:15.320\nDo you have shards of power, right?\n\n01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:18.320\nAre those like the amulet of autumn and stuff?\n\n01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:21.320\nNo, these are stuff that you've collected.\n\n01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:29.320\nGuys, the shards of power, if Admiral Darkstar wants all of those, what if this guy is just lying to us and works for him?\n\n01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:31.320\nHe's going to hand them all over to him.\n\n01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:34.320\nShould we ask him if there's something else that he would want instead?\n\n01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:36.320\nWhat do we get in return for these shards?\n\n01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:38.320\nLike, exactly.\n\n01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:45.320\nI will give you some of my finest horses, as well as a regiment of six frost giant warriors to aid you.\n\n01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:46.320\nFor how many shards?\n\n01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:48.320\nFor how many horses?\n\n01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:49.320\nI want all of them.\n\n01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:52.320\nYou want all of their shards?\n\n01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:55.320\nAll right, sorry, I've had a tough day.\n\n01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:58.320\nSir, is there something else that you would take instead of shards?\n\n01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:04.320\nMost of the shards.\n\n01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:08.320\nI have goggles of night, do you want that?\n\n01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:10.320\nYou take that instead of the shards?\n\n01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:17.320\nCan somebody who's got more wisdom than me sense motive on this guy?\n\n01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:19.320\nYou fail to sense his motive.\n\n01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:21.320\nI ask somebody else to do it.\n\n01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:25.320\nSomebody else also fails.\n\n01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:27.320\nAll right, I think we got to get my own dice.\n\n01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:33.320\nWe got to put a bookmark here, because we're in the hall of the Frost Giant.\n\n01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:36.320\nJarl Cliffhanger.\n\n01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:37.320\nJarl Cliffhanger.\n\n01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:39.320\nAll right, thank you, Kumail Nanjiani.\n\n01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:41.320\nThank you, Erin McGathy.\n\n01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:47.320\nThank you, Spencer, for your dungeon mastery.\n\n01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:54.320\nPlease, on Saturday, come to the Silent Movie Theater.\n\n01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:55.320\nGoogle it.\n\n01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:58.320\nHarmon Quest is called in cooperation with Cine Family.\n\n01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:00.320\nCome to the thing.\n\n01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:02.320\nAll right, it's showtime.\n\n01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:06.320\nYou want to say a nice little lesson learned?\n\n01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:07.320\nWhat have we learned?\n\n01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:09.320\nGay people should be allowed to be gay.\n\n01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:15.320\nIf you fuck around with that, Satanists will turn your dead grandma's gay.\n\n01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:18.320\nSome Black Panthers are Irish.\n\n01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:27.320\nBlack Panthers should not be exiled to Tanzania, because that guy could have been doing a lot of good here.\n\n01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:31.320\nInstead, he's got an orphanage over there.\n\n01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:36.320\nIt's possible to have a thing called Jeep Butt.\n\n01:54:36.320 -->
