02:14.880 --> 02:19.600

02:49.040 --> 02:54.440
that was sarcasm but but don't worry about it you're fine you know that we're

all smoke and light I'm killing or you're the worst anyway sorry that got

03:04.880 --> 03:11.920
to you the I'm channeling Andy kindler because he's here tonight I feel like I

03:11.920 --> 03:16.120
was like I'm like biting some of you're not a large enough vessel to hold the

03:16.120 --> 03:19.720
majesty that is Andy kind no no nobody is I'm just saying like I'm doing some

03:19.720 --> 03:24.400
like like some weird like I'm I'm such a fan that I'm kind of like I I wouldn't I

03:24.400 --> 03:29.280
wouldn't be I wouldn't discount the idea that I'm kind of like enchanted and

03:29.280 --> 03:33.680
sort of like have a kindler spell cast on me yeah I think when Andy kindler

03:33.680 --> 03:37.240
enters the room the if you have any antenna at all they're they're they're

03:37.240 --> 03:42.960
hitting a certain frequency of high-speed alacrity cunning and this and the

03:42.960 --> 03:48.160
double triple quadruple self-awareness that turns into such self-denial that

03:48.160 --> 03:52.040
it's like a swirling I think we can say that if he doesn't come at her and give

03:52.040 --> 04:03.680
us the greatest comedy show all right so so yeah he went he went out he went to

04:03.680 --> 04:10.320
get a sandwich oh okay so the haunted hayride okay so you go on it doesn't

04:10.320 --> 04:13.800
matter this is you can imagine for me the haunted hayride is a thing that just

04:13.800 --> 04:19.400
haunts my ability to get home in Los Feliz it clogs up traffic from the five

04:19.400 --> 04:24.960
all the way to my place I don't drive anymore but I went there and you're

04:24.960 --> 04:27.880
being driven you know there's a tractor when you when you're there that's the

04:27.880 --> 04:31.000
irony is that you're driving and you're like slower than the tractor you sitting

04:31.000 --> 04:36.520
on physical hay proper hay yeah there's hay so but there's no chairs so that's

04:36.520 --> 04:41.080
the thing is like it's a chair on hay but here's the here's the thing about

04:41.080 --> 04:44.920
hay and not having chairs and the hayrides even haunted ones I would have

04:44.920 --> 04:50.720
would have assumed before the two nights ago that they're like I don't know why

04:50.720 --> 04:56.200
you'd be riding on hay but I know that you wouldn't be doing it with 65 people

04:56.200 --> 05:02.040
no it should be you and Terry Gar and the it should be you and Terry Gar

05:02.040 --> 05:07.160
or Andy Kiddler or like Mike Nesmith I don't care who it is as long as there's

05:07.160 --> 05:16.960
four to eight of them that would be a fucking good hayride you guys are gonna

05:16.960 --> 05:24.200
have to google three-quarters of that to find out why it would be dynamite you're

05:24.200 --> 05:29.320
gonna love it like when I call them the Coneval of Covech I'm like what just

05:29.320 --> 05:35.880
Google they but but it's hate so okay so what happens is is it loose I'm

05:35.880 --> 05:41.600
picture like a hay wagon it's loose hay it's loose slippery like effectively

05:41.600 --> 05:49.000
lubricating hay it's not it's not bales of tightly bound healthy dog shit like

05:49.000 --> 05:54.640
firm like like like like like like like nobody's fed at table scraps it's like

05:54.640 --> 05:58.760
you revealed some of your own backstory on that no I have the fact that my dog

05:58.760 --> 06:03.760
takes nice firm healthy poops and that and that even just stop what you're

06:03.760 --> 06:09.800
doing because I'm about to ruin the things that you used to all right to

06:09.800 --> 06:15.600
stop so everybody's just let me get to the fucking there's nothing there was

06:15.600 --> 06:20.080
one thing so about that but the chain link there was a chain link area when

06:20.080 --> 06:24.240
you stand in line and you get into the that there's a chain link area right

06:24.240 --> 06:29.000
before you're getting into the hay cart and they haven't all worked out they've

06:29.000 --> 06:35.080
been doing this for a long time not the scary parts but the crowd control parts

06:35.080 --> 06:41.040
the scary parts are apparently decided on by committee three weeks before each

06:41.040 --> 06:48.680
thing and I don't even know I walked out with so many questions I was like I

06:48.680 --> 06:52.760
like like did they are they just upset about school shootings is that why they

06:52.760 --> 06:57.080
just like just threw Rick random shit out there and just hoped it was a little

06:57.080 --> 07:01.320
scary but not upsetting like like like it was like it was like a mildly

07:01.320 --> 07:06.720
uncomfortable hayride not I would not call it haunted in the least by anything

07:06.720 --> 07:15.560
like except for you know the ghost of pride and craftsmanship like I mean

07:15.560 --> 07:20.480
that was certainly there like going remember me you forgot me and I was

07:20.480 --> 07:25.080
like no the ghost of my I'm there's too many ghost jokes that they so take me

07:25.080 --> 07:29.280
through it you're cruising along I'm imagining at like one mile an hour as

07:29.280 --> 07:32.120
you're going through a various little town I have something to tell you about

07:32.120 --> 07:35.960
before that though okay because the line you're in line and I was actually

07:35.960 --> 07:40.200
happy to be there was VIP tickets for like five dollars more where you can

07:40.200 --> 07:48.200
like walk past people and I'll do that in a fucking I would do that under normal

07:48.200 --> 07:54.960
circumstances I would pay 500 times more than you would for the fun of walking

07:54.960 --> 08:02.800
around you if I had to walk eight more times the distance I would I would just

08:02.800 --> 08:09.200
so happy to be moving I would just walk around you and like and be rich I will

08:09.200 --> 08:18.120
I'm not I am not a man of the people but I I did not buy a VIP ticket on purpose

08:18.120 --> 08:22.880
because I was so high I was scared that I was gonna get scared because I said

08:22.880 --> 08:28.480
Dino there's this is I don't like the people touching you and he said they

08:28.480 --> 08:35.080
can't touch you they can't touch you they're not allowed to touch you which is

08:35.080 --> 08:41.240
like the scariest thing in the world they're not allowed to touch you it

08:41.240 --> 08:45.120
sounds a little scary but then they keep repeating that they don't touch them

08:45.120 --> 08:51.200
they won't touch you they're not allowed to touch you you're not allowed to touch

08:51.200 --> 08:57.160
them it's it's like it's like it's like Jonestown and but there's like and then

08:57.160 --> 09:00.680
there's like these like okay so you should you go through the line and then

09:00.680 --> 09:04.640
you get into this chain link area that's designed to hold not the number of

09:04.640 --> 09:11.240
people but the volume of flesh when when the chain link thing right before you

09:11.240 --> 09:17.560
get on the hay cart is full of human tissue they close it behind the last

09:17.560 --> 09:22.680
person after they've shamed the front people you know good come on come on

09:22.680 --> 09:26.280
move in move in and I thought the guy at first I was like oh he's like is he like

09:26.280 --> 09:31.680
a like bad UCB or IO guy doing like a southern character to like create an

09:31.680 --> 09:35.280
air of like because otherwise he's like in the middle of Los Angeles like

09:35.280 --> 09:39.880
bossing people around who are drunk and high and and thought it would be funny

09:39.880 --> 09:45.000
if they paid you to try to scare me motherfucker and like and I and I thought

09:45.000 --> 09:48.800
that's actually brilliant that he that they've adopted like this southern thing

09:48.800 --> 09:52.740
this is like something that people in LA are like maybe like oh shit I saw I saw

09:52.740 --> 09:57.240
those movies I'm not gonna fuck with this guy yeah this guy's Ned Beatty but he

09:57.240 --> 10:03.440
was too authentic and too unfunny to have been trained in anything and he's

10:03.440 --> 10:07.400
because he kept doing these jokes he's like all right people so you get into

10:07.400 --> 10:11.960
this chain link like like just just like this chain link like cauldron because

10:11.960 --> 10:15.840
the doors open then you're gonna get on the hay cart oh it's gonna be so fun

10:15.840 --> 10:19.520
when you get on the hay cart so then you're there and then this guy just like

10:19.520 --> 10:23.400
you know peanut style has his forearms over the top of the chain link fence

10:23.400 --> 10:29.120
looking down at you and he has a little baby bullhorn because you're not that

10:29.120 --> 10:35.720
far away and he got any guys like okay people oh got a couple rules for you

10:35.720 --> 10:43.160
gonna have a good time but you got to follow these rules do not touch the actors

10:43.160 --> 10:49.560
I repeat do not touch the actors that goes for touching him but and then he

10:49.560 --> 10:53.200
would like do some bit and I don't even remember the bit that's how unfunny and

10:53.200 --> 10:58.040
nobody laughed and I was like I think I like dude do not stand when you're on

10:58.040 --> 11:03.280
the hay cart keep all of your arms and hands down by your four point landing

11:03.280 --> 11:09.560
that in other words that is your gluteus Maximus your butt your sugar shaker your

11:09.560 --> 11:15.600
flamethrower I made it funnier than he did like he went he tried to like hit

11:15.600 --> 11:19.560
like his joke was that he was talking hip-hop or something like for a set of

11:19.560 --> 11:23.040
the idea so everyone's just like kind of bumped out there like yes we got it like

11:23.040 --> 11:26.440
these are those are not unimportant rules we're glad you told them to us like

11:26.440 --> 11:29.840
we're not we're not we're not snarky I thought I was with a group of enlightened

11:29.840 --> 11:35.240
people like like like when nobody was causing trouble nobody was he was he

11:35.240 --> 11:39.360
dressed spooky what was he dressed like a like a like a hillbilly like you know

11:39.360 --> 11:42.920
they were all just a fight a tractor driven it's a tractor themed horror

11:42.920 --> 11:48.200
experience it's it's I think you've all you know when you think of horror

11:48.200 --> 11:53.080
staples you think of farm equipment like like chainsaws cut down trees who

11:53.080 --> 11:55.880
would have thought those could be scary well everybody because they can cut

11:55.880 --> 12:01.720
people and have but pitchforks you know who thought that well because they

12:01.720 --> 12:09.920
stab people tractor rides get in the tractor this tractor isn't haunted it's

12:09.920 --> 12:16.040
just just taking a break between its normal tractor functions while going

12:16.040 --> 12:21.680
through a haunted area that's like there's a tractor pulling me it's like

12:21.680 --> 12:25.760
everything's nothing scary when you're being pulled by a tractor so there's

12:25.760 --> 12:29.360
nothing scary rosemary's baby what if she had been an attractor going to the

12:29.360 --> 12:33.200
movie I was like oh you're baby special we want to I think our neighbors are

12:33.200 --> 12:42.280
cultists but we're on a tractor so who cares like Jaws oh god there's that

12:42.280 --> 12:47.560
this isn't this isn't this wasn't sure about a boat accident who I don't know

12:47.560 --> 12:52.360
if he tries to bite us he'll probably break his teeth on the tractor we're on

12:52.360 --> 12:58.120
a tractor you won't even need a bigger tractor you won't don't encourage him

12:58.120 --> 13:04.280
it's it's it's my show encourage me I've been away for a while encourage me so

13:04.280 --> 13:07.440
here's the only thing I can't believe you brought this up I didn't even what's

13:07.440 --> 13:11.400
it's good I really remembered this and I it's like like so is me and Dino and

13:11.400 --> 13:14.960
I was like so we're like yeah yeah we understand the rules so then this guy

13:14.960 --> 13:18.120
like so then there was like some hustle over here like there was some

13:18.120 --> 13:21.920
business happening over here on the outside of the cage and he's like huh

13:21.920 --> 13:29.320
what oh oh okay you know Shelby Shelby Shelby Shelby because he realized and I

13:29.320 --> 13:34.320
want you to remember that moment because he at first he was gonna do it loudly

13:34.320 --> 13:39.440
and do as many bull but but but what you'll find in this story is that is that

13:39.440 --> 13:45.160
the matter he needed to attend to demanded some respect and privacy so he

13:45.160 --> 13:53.560
show me show me we got we got a little handicap over here no I need I need so

13:53.560 --> 13:58.960
we're gonna go second round as a 65 no not 67 because it's too we got we got a

13:58.960 --> 14:06.960
little handicap situation and I'm like I go okay look not when he wants you to

14:06.960 --> 14:12.360
look now now that it's been all this time look and it's good well what did I

14:12.360 --> 14:16.800
see a human being in a wheelchair who is having the scariest night of their

14:16.800 --> 14:23.280
life now the night they feared since the moment whether it was birthed or

14:23.280 --> 14:29.760
whatever ailed them what happened which is the dumbest people in the world

14:29.760 --> 14:37.080
swarming around them calling them a little handicap and everyone being fine

14:37.080 --> 14:43.600
with it while they claw at chain link just struggling for a view of the little

14:43.600 --> 14:52.680
handicap I was fucking blown away and I would you know and I did like a guy

14:52.680 --> 14:56.320
you know I thought at that point I was like well we're certainly not in the

14:56.320 --> 15:03.760
hands of people who care about our feelings and that's scary but they are

15:03.760 --> 15:10.440
very rule-oriented so that undercuts it you can't touch anybody no one can touch

15:10.440 --> 15:17.640
you go to our website if you feel touched get in the get in the thing get in

15:17.640 --> 15:20.440
the thing and then everyone's like wearing clown masks and like trying to

15:20.440 --> 15:24.400
do these bits that are based on like a different world where probably it

15:24.400 --> 15:28.600
didn't have to be said constantly that no one could touch you it's like and

15:28.600 --> 15:33.800
probably there was like I feel like over the years as epidemics of violence in

15:33.800 --> 15:37.520
our country like increased and the committees that run this thing changed

15:37.520 --> 15:42.120
around I feel like I imagine that an explanation of what I experienced that

15:42.120 --> 15:46.760
night that the lights gradually got brighter and that the actors gradually

15:46.760 --> 15:50.760
got more and more scolded for certain terms of phrase and it just results and

15:50.760 --> 15:55.680
just these people just like that are that are just as dumb as someone who might

15:55.680 --> 16:04.360
be able to scare you real good like nothing scarier than a dumb fuck with

16:04.360 --> 16:08.960
your money and suspenders like fucking hanging out like in Charlie have you

16:08.960 --> 16:14.040
ever been to a carnival ever in the last 38 years that's terrifying the last thing

16:14.040 --> 16:18.800
you see is like hold tight keep your shoes and he pulls his lever and you're

16:18.800 --> 16:22.520
like hearing these bolts that you know he doesn't understand just creak and

16:22.520 --> 16:26.200
strain and you're just remembering all of these articles and you're like

16:26.200 --> 16:30.000
trying to figure out if they're apocryphal what are the rates where am I on

16:30.000 --> 16:34.320
this chart why why why is there a rope across my belly I've been on the

16:34.320 --> 16:37.720
Batman right I know what you're capable of I know you're capable of making me

16:37.720 --> 16:40.200
safe

16:40.200 --> 16:48.480
do why why is everything so wooden that when it rains I've had decks do you

16:48.480 --> 16:53.560
check it every day everything's what do why is everything would like so my point

16:53.560 --> 16:58.240
being you could be scary just for nothing just by being a hick and hanging

16:58.240 --> 17:01.880
out so when the thing embarks and but but they're all bound by this code so

17:01.880 --> 17:04.800
they're just sort of like doing this show what were there when that when the

17:04.800 --> 17:08.200
hay right kicks off and you leave the station and you're going out there are

17:08.200 --> 17:11.720
you just passively writing through a little tableau well so okay so then you

17:11.720 --> 17:15.520
go you all file in and stand shoulder to shoulder they keep yelling at you that

17:15.520 --> 17:19.960
you're not that is that as close as you feel you are that you're not close

17:19.960 --> 17:24.320
enough to each other but they can't touch you and you can't touch them but

17:24.320 --> 17:30.520
you know welcome to fucking Jesus Christ I'm so sorry and like it's like like

17:30.520 --> 17:33.880
like just imagine if you got on that thing with the wrong combination of

17:33.880 --> 17:36.920
people I was like thank God for the wonderful people that were on there with

17:36.920 --> 17:45.800
me Mike Nesmith Mike Nesmith Terry Garh Rick Schroeder Norm McDonald little

17:45.800 --> 17:56.360
Wayne Stevie Nicks two Baldwin's but one of them was the sexist non Baldwin you

17:56.360 --> 17:59.560
know that guy's not a real Baldwin I just found that out fake Baldwin I would

17:59.560 --> 18:03.720
lost my faith in the Baldwin name he's not a Baldwin he's some kind named

18:03.720 --> 18:12.000
Baldwin he's not a Baldwin it should be against the law when you have a certain

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
amount of rename real estate in Hollywood all right see you leave the

18:17.000 --> 18:21.080
station and you're going down the front what's the first act of the haunted

18:21.080 --> 18:25.560
hay right what's the first thing you see as you leave chain link what happened

18:25.560 --> 18:30.600
with the handicapped situation they just they just had to take the next cart and

18:30.600 --> 18:35.600
I'm sure they were tended to very sensitively and I'm sure if you go to

18:35.600 --> 18:42.560
their blog you'll find that they love Halloween now so it's Griffith Park it's

18:42.560 --> 18:46.680
by the zoo in the golf course there it's nighttime and you leave just give me a

18:46.680 --> 18:54.000
moment you're now that poor poor little handicapped he called her a little he

18:54.000 --> 18:58.880
referred to a human being I think what he meant to say is a little handicap

18:58.880 --> 19:05.480
situation if he had just said situation I would chuckle but then because of his

19:05.480 --> 19:10.600
concern about it and stuff it'd be like oh that's colloquial and we are 2pc like

19:10.600 --> 19:15.080
he's expressing a need we have a little handicap situation that's a that could

19:15.080 --> 19:19.800
be something a hero says but he just left the word out so as they say he

19:19.800 --> 19:30.240
he reduced someone's humanity was that like like just like they just they they you if you know I had to be talked into go in there that night

19:30.240 --> 19:36.400
Jesus Christ what about me in a wheelchair what do you think I'd never go so that means

19:36.400 --> 19:44.240
somebody fucking could jolt that person they're like please handicap Harmon please

19:44.240 --> 19:48.560
you're so you're such a curmudgeon you're such a loner you say you're it's

19:48.560 --> 19:52.280
unhealthy please come out just once I swear to God I promise promise promise

19:52.280 --> 19:55.680
promise you're gonna have a good time now somebody we got a little handicap here

19:55.680 --> 20:03.520
I want to kill myself and it's depending on my situation I may not be able to I'm

20:03.520 --> 20:08.200
gonna put it into my book I'm gonna write it with my foot and I'm gonna fucking

20:08.200 --> 20:13.560
die a spiritual death and I'm gonna be hanging out as a flesh husk haunting you

20:13.560 --> 20:19.720
there's gonna feel like you think these ghosts scare me you people are the

20:19.720 --> 20:31.640
monsters because you think I'm a ghost so the you get so you get on the thing

20:31.640 --> 20:36.160
and then and then there comes this point and this is this is on me this is my

20:36.160 --> 20:40.320
fault the rest of the evening is my fault because then they go it's I'm so

20:40.320 --> 20:43.960
nervous now I'm like I have to they keep saying that I'm not close enough to

20:43.960 --> 20:47.280
people I feel like I feel like they're right if somebody tells me that I'm

20:47.280 --> 20:51.360
doing something wrong I'm gonna first assume they're right and then it's I'm

20:51.360 --> 20:55.320
like so close to people and then they're like now sit and it was like

20:55.320 --> 20:59.460

did you know you were on came no you aren't fired well yeah this is what I

24:35.640 --> 24:39.760
consider fire you were boom into first of all you you have you went on the hay

24:39.760 --> 24:44.200
ride no most people would not do that for now I know that if you had told me

24:44.200 --> 24:48.040
that if you had been at the dinner that I was at Latino if you just popped out

24:48.040 --> 24:52.080
from from the kitchen and said most people don't do what you're about to

24:52.080 --> 24:58.440
do yeah I said do you know because he's going on it twice it sounds like a heat

24:58.440 --> 25:06.160
like a he-ha convention I don't know he-ha sounded good convention was wrong

25:06.160 --> 25:12.640
and you've not done it correct oh have I done it I grew up on a farm with hate

25:12.640 --> 25:20.920
no I didn't I've never been how did how did they start with the hay rides why

25:20.920 --> 25:26.200
are they riding hay around keep the hay by the barn it's kind of like

25:26.200 --> 25:30.480
Seinfeld every check every time you put it in the cart you're gonna get haunted

25:30.480 --> 25:34.600
right what where are you taking it is there another farm let them grow their

25:34.600 --> 25:39.840
own hay the word hey the word haunted is in your ride who wants to go in a

25:39.840 --> 25:43.760
haunted ride I don't know what a barn is capable of but I know it has its own

25:43.760 --> 25:51.800
hey what oh now who am I I turned into yogurt from Spaceballs from Spaceballs

25:51.800 --> 25:56.160
yeah I'll tell you I never I've never you know I saw that movie coming I was

25:56.160 --> 25:59.800
like no way I'm going to go I didn't I begged all of my friends to go see it I

25:59.800 --> 26:04.560
was at prime you were the D no to that haunted hey right yeah so so the weirdest

26:04.560 --> 26:07.080
thing but about the haunted hey ride stop me if you want to talk about

26:07.080 --> 26:10.520
anything else but here is the here is that here is the weirdest thing like I

26:10.520 --> 26:14.760
had so many questions like they because they never there's no I mean and I'm

26:14.760 --> 26:18.280
not being a snob because they would just take you through scary stuff it was

26:18.280 --> 26:22.160
just sort of like you'd sometimes you'd stop and they'd be like they'd put on a

26:22.160 --> 26:25.800
little show I was like well who's gonna complain about this this is not a

26:25.800 --> 26:29.000
problem but then it was like for the most part it's just people wandering up

26:29.000 --> 26:31.720
and they just keep you know and you just keep remembering they're not allowed to

26:31.720 --> 26:36.520
touch you you should not touch them so it's sort of like it really like takes

26:36.520 --> 26:41.120
the fear out of like the 90th guy coming up just putting his head next

26:41.120 --> 26:46.760
years and going and I'm like but now I'm my anxiety I'm like ah but it's fake

26:46.760 --> 26:51.960
I'm faking it because it's like when you tip at a strip strip bar you know I'm

26:51.960 --> 26:58.080
like I don't know last one was a redhead but that's on me like I don't know I

26:58.080 --> 27:01.800
don't want to take it out on you like I don't know what my job is anymore what

27:01.800 --> 27:10.240
is currency a strip bar strip bar hey Ryan my wrongs am I wrong so so it's so

27:10.240 --> 27:14.400
the way so it's all magical like there are goblins and there were people but

27:14.400 --> 27:18.960
the lighting was bad but in the wrong ways so like what was that word it was

27:18.960 --> 27:23.160
just well it was like they weren't lit so I couldn't like see their faces but

27:23.160 --> 27:26.200
everything was lit for everyone's safety like everything was lit so that the

27:26.200 --> 27:30.320
driver could see the road and so that no one could sue them forever not seeing

27:30.320 --> 27:34.120
something but it wasn't lit there were no key lights you know and there were

27:34.120 --> 27:38.120
there was no blocking so all you were ever seeing was just like shiny mess like

27:38.120 --> 27:42.560
when you took the old Universal Studios tour ride you would go into a thing and

27:42.560 --> 27:46.040
it would stop and you would stop you in front of a place and they would tell you

27:46.040 --> 27:49.360
about the history of the thing and then the flood would happen like that's the

27:49.360 --> 27:54.080
worst that is the worst tour and I've been on it four times and the last time

27:54.080 --> 27:59.240
I went on it it was I was doing a gig up at a private party and the only way to

27:59.240 --> 28:07.360
get to it was I had to go through the tour for the fourth time and it's horrible

28:07.360 --> 28:12.120
the poor is horrible the Jaws shark the Fire Marshal allows that that there's

28:12.120 --> 28:18.560
only one point of no they that was so you're you're waiting into the party if

28:18.560 --> 28:22.280
you have to leave everyone gets to just go around the ride I don't I don't know

28:22.280 --> 28:31.920
I didn't realize you I felt I didn't see any way around the worst part the worst

28:31.920 --> 28:35.240
part is the Moses part where they part the sea but they don't part the sea the

28:35.240 --> 28:39.120
sea just sinks into a thing oh I don't even want to get it I only want to get

28:39.120 --> 28:46.280
into the how it ruins the illusion of all these movies now I know there wasn't

28:46.280 --> 28:54.660
a real shark I was a kid when they when they when they implemented the

28:54.660 --> 28:59.600
King Kong attraction at the Universal Studios to a ride Jeff is 720 years old

28:59.600 --> 29:05.960
implemented I like implemented have you implemented the new ride yet also he's

29:05.960 --> 29:10.080
a cone head he eats toilet paper would like to be implemented into the new ride

29:10.080 --> 29:17.640
we are from we are from France you're gonna get your balls busted tonight oh

29:17.640 --> 29:24.920
you're going down baby you're gonna get kindled 2015 2015 hashtag

29:24.920 --> 29:30.160
batten pending but where the King Kong ride came out they boasted and it was

29:30.160 --> 29:33.240
true when you went in the King Kong is shaking the cables of the Brooklyn

29:33.240 --> 29:37.800
bridge that you are ostensibly on as advertised and your car is

29:37.800 --> 29:43.400
trampled clunkiest but most accurate slogan for a ride over and but what

29:43.400 --> 29:47.040
King Kong was bright close to you when you got right up in front of it banana

29:47.040 --> 29:57.360
scented breath oh no you did my god no detail was left on I wound it's like

29:57.360 --> 30:01.320
it's out of nothing but I bet they had to point it out right there's probably a

30:01.320 --> 30:05.600
sign that the cool part Andy and you tell your friends I will back you up

30:05.600 --> 30:09.440
if you are old-school enough and I know that you are because you have O.G.

30:09.440 --> 30:18.240
written all across here I have O.C. O.C. you have O.C.D. your O.C.G. O.C.G. come on

30:18.240 --> 30:23.560
initial humor is easy come someone come up with something old you're not your

30:23.560 --> 30:31.160
assessor compulsive gangster so I'm shot so many mother fuckers at 73 to be

30:31.160 --> 30:36.440
exact unless you count Stacy because he was already dying when my friend shot

30:36.440 --> 30:43.600
him but I go by actual time of death I was the motherfucker I was supposed to

30:43.600 --> 30:49.800
make sure he was dead now I'm concerned he was not really dead you don't own me

30:49.800 --> 30:54.360
motherfucker you're not a box of matchsticks spilled out under an open

30:54.360 --> 31:01.440
white-shag carpet now I keep checking for my keys

31:02.040 --> 31:10.760
yo a comedy staple ladies and gentlemen yeah white people rapping yeah yo O.C.G.

31:10.760 --> 31:19.600
yeah yeah I can't yo my bullets in the clip I put the left one first as I'm

31:19.600 --> 31:25.480
facing it I got my bullets arranged from left to right because I'm gonna shoot

31:25.480 --> 31:30.760
you with the sharpest bullet tonight but I gotta make sure that the sharpest

31:30.760 --> 31:39.960
ones I touch it three times otherwise my mother might die I getting a pain in

31:39.960 --> 31:58.120
my heart is it a panic attack or have I been shot I can't be sure I'm so fucking

31:58.120 --> 32:03.160
angry right now at the world but my therapist tells me to start trying to

32:03.160 --> 32:07.640
stop worrying about it you try stopping worrying about something yeah what do you

32:07.640 --> 32:20.440
think happens motherfucker you worry more I forgot to put the cap back on the

32:20.440 --> 32:29.120
bottle I forgot to put a cap in your ass I bust the cap back onto the bottle

32:29.120 --> 32:35.320
damn it it doesn't go flat afterwards see what I ruined if I had if I had

32:35.320 --> 32:40.120
fucking loosened my goddamn grip on my show this is all I think rap is somehow

32:40.120 --> 32:48.320
any any you're halfway home if you do that now the rest is just writing in

32:48.320 --> 32:53.520
genius that's right the rest is just talent it seems to help to grow up as

32:53.520 --> 32:56.800
part of a disenfranchised population but people are speculating that that's a

32:56.800 --> 33:02.760
total coincidence I was a reformed Jew around a lot of conservative Jews you

33:02.760 --> 33:11.680
think that was easy no think I didn't suffer in Queens I wanted to be upper

33:11.680 --> 33:15.960
middle class but I was just regular middle-class

33:17.960 --> 33:27.680
why can't we have a better car than it yo yeah I had a support system but at

33:27.680 --> 33:39.440
what price price price price price so one thing one atonal thing about the

33:39.440 --> 33:48.560
haunted a ride was after after a whole unexplained and and and it wasn't

33:48.560 --> 33:52.400
necessary to explain any of this I didn't I required nothing you guys think

33:52.400 --> 33:57.600
oh Dan humble brag like or whatever you're like oh you went on a haunted hey

33:57.600 --> 34:01.680
right and it had third act problems you're trying to flaunt like oh you're

34:01.680 --> 34:05.680
a craftsman you're trying to brand yourself like well when I see a dog

34:05.680 --> 34:10.920
shit in a carpet I just see poop on a carpet but you see who network by

34:10.920 --> 34:14.440
Patty Chayevsky because you're so interesting that's not that's not the

34:14.440 --> 34:18.740
that's not what I'm trying to create I'm saying like I was exactly what they

34:18.740 --> 34:26.400
were thinking I only I only wanted to just as one of you just wanted to be in

34:26.400 --> 34:31.320
a hay cart and be haunted that's all that was all I was looking for I had no

34:31.320 --> 34:38.840
other requirements however the way they haunted me for as long as they did and

34:38.840 --> 34:43.080
continues to haunt you well the thing that continues to haunt me was the

34:43.080 --> 34:48.720
total disruption in tonality that was like because right in the middle of the

34:48.720 --> 34:54.680
whole thing yeah so the whole thing is just like bat people goblin people bucket

34:54.680 --> 35:01.240
people tree people do chain people Viking people it's just random it's just

35:01.240 --> 35:05.760
like I think what they must do is they like must sublet each ten feet of the

35:05.760 --> 35:10.880
park to like some bad improv troop I think I got I felt like just or just like

35:10.880 --> 35:14.840
a committee they just go like okay Gary and his guys they they said they'd come

35:14.840 --> 35:19.280
back but they really want to do the Vikings again oh how many times do I have

35:19.280 --> 35:25.480
to tell them Vikings haven't been scary since 1203 even the Minnesota Vikings

35:25.480 --> 35:38.800
am I right go Packers just late gay right who's that deflate game not not

35:38.800 --> 35:49.800
soon or late enough so in the middle of it after all anyone's done is gone so

35:49.800 --> 35:54.840
then you pull also you start hearing like 60s Motown music and you're like

35:54.840 --> 36:00.440
where's this going how how racist is this gonna get because I just went

36:00.440 --> 36:05.600
through the witch doctor's segment by the way right and I and I and I and I'm

36:05.600 --> 36:12.360
a I'm a white liberal and I won't write a letter but I'm holding on to it but it

36:12.360 --> 36:17.520
but but but but but but they seemed fine with it and by they you know who I

36:17.520 --> 36:24.760
mean the goblins the goblins and I subscribe to the social philosophy that

36:24.760 --> 36:29.240
if it's fine with them it is fine with me but believe me it's still down there

36:29.240 --> 36:33.080
I'm thinking about it what was the Motown song I don't remember it was like

36:33.080 --> 36:39.280
don't mess with I want to kiss your lips cuz my sugar baby loves to kiss your

36:39.280 --> 36:44.360
lips I don't think I don't think either one of those is Motown who's with me

36:44.360 --> 36:54.160
who's with me on this I the Archies is not Motown and then and then what comes

36:54.160 --> 36:58.640
into view is like a cross-section of cornfield and then like this like this

36:58.640 --> 37:04.320
like vintage 60s car I'm like okay I guess this is here it doesn't fit with

37:04.320 --> 37:08.480
anything and then like two kids came out dressed in like like back to the future

37:08.480 --> 37:12.920
to like kind of like 50s attire like they're like sweaters and the pony tails

37:12.920 --> 37:18.480
and I didn't get turned on but it was like I didn't and I didn't say that I

37:18.480 --> 37:24.800
didn't because I did I like who reacts to getting turned on that way it's not

37:24.800 --> 37:30.000
part of the story that move that movie made me so horny am I right back to the

37:30.000 --> 37:33.680
future so the two kids and then they go and then they're like performing but

37:33.680 --> 37:36.560
by the way everyone that's performing like half of the audience is going like

37:36.560 --> 37:41.160
this and every time I do that my neck is behind my leg and people are going are

37:41.160 --> 37:46.400
you okay so I'm trying to strain so it's two actors that go these are the first

37:46.400 --> 37:51.040
people that have spoken any language except for like rattling cans and going

37:51.040 --> 37:56.360
are and we're shooting chains into nothing for the whole time so now all

37:56.360 --> 38:00.000
of a sudden it's halfway through the thing and there's just like two actors

38:00.000 --> 38:03.880
come out and they go like stop it you know what are you doing yeah what are

38:03.880 --> 38:10.920
you doing hey whoa it's my heart baby oh come on hey whoa what's that and they

38:10.920 --> 38:15.240
look and so we all look and there's like some like kind of awkwardly lit thing

38:15.240 --> 38:18.320
that like I kept going like well if that's gonna be a guy that kills you I

38:18.320 --> 38:22.200
want to watch that because when I'm really that's not gonna move is it it's

38:22.200 --> 38:27.320
gonna stay there so like that's gonna be interesting so I was looking at that

38:27.320 --> 38:30.360
but then what happened is they got in the car because they were scared of that

38:30.360 --> 38:36.080
which turns out they that there was gunshots from the car so this is like

38:36.080 --> 38:39.400
not that kind of like show so far it was like I think there's just the most

38:39.400 --> 38:43.120
expensive things that they had to keep it even though there's been you know so

38:43.120 --> 38:46.280
much because I talked to other people are like that right so scary it's like

38:46.280 --> 38:49.400
had this whole theme of serial killers last time because this was clearly just

38:49.400 --> 38:56.640
a fucking just cold-blooded recreation of the fucking zodiac killings like it

38:56.640 --> 39:00.800
was just they got into the car and then there was like strobe lights and gun

39:00.800 --> 39:05.840
shots from inside the car so we've been like being like like like delightfully

39:05.840 --> 39:11.720
harangued by goblins that cannot touch you and then there's this play and it

39:11.720 --> 39:16.440
culminates in just like bang bang bang bang and then again and then the weirder

39:16.440 --> 39:22.680
part is how dumb it is because the guy a guy gets out in a ski mask holding an

39:22.680 --> 39:30.040
axe even though he's I guess I guess he doesn't he's not confident in his

39:30.040 --> 39:34.520
marksmanship or he's like or he or he just ran out of bullets but he's like

39:34.520 --> 39:38.360
he's like now holding an axe so he climbs out and he goes maybe he maybe he

39:38.360 --> 39:48.200
killed a gun with his axe well then the other actors come on go we're fine there

39:48.200 --> 39:53.400
was an axe in the backseat this gentleman was skiing he he he he hates his

39:53.400 --> 39:58.760
second amendment so but he comes out and he walks along the hay cart but the

39:58.760 --> 40:04.000
weird thing is everyone else has been a goblin a troll you can't take your

40:04.000 --> 40:14.800
director's hat off I'm a writer the lighting is wrong it's just structural

40:14.800 --> 40:19.120
it's just because he said he goes like oh hey it's supposed to be funny and

40:19.120 --> 40:22.080
bone-chilling now this was Thursday night all these people are phoning it in

40:22.080 --> 40:27.200
but he was like like my nobody's bones were close to chilled like like they

40:27.200 --> 40:30.640
were everyone's how much were room temperatures how many spines were

40:30.640 --> 40:34.800
tingled no none none no tingling like I like like there was a couple aches and

40:34.800 --> 40:42.560
bakes ooh you'll have aches and bakes you have to you have to come baked you

40:42.560 --> 40:45.160
can save a lot of money just staying home watching like a Jonestown

40:45.160 --> 40:48.480
documentary something like that so then he just keeps going I swear to God I'm

40:48.480 --> 40:51.440
done talking about the fucking hayride but he goes like he follows the hayride

40:51.440 --> 40:54.640
for a while and I cannot stress to you enough no one has spoken to us the

40:54.640 --> 40:58.520
entire time and it's not the end and it's not the beginning this is just the

40:58.520 --> 41:02.000
middle and it will never be addressed again structurally it's just like it's

41:02.000 --> 41:06.480
just this fucking insane temporal shift we're like we were at a witch's house

41:06.480 --> 41:10.160
we were in gumdrop land we were in fucking Pink Floyd's the wall now we're

41:10.160 --> 41:15.760
just in the fucking 60s and an actual historical murder

41:16.760 --> 41:21.400
some people aren't could possibly be relatives of some victims that's not my

41:21.400 --> 41:26.200
point I'm just saying it's totally different it's totally different if the

41:26.200 --> 41:29.560
whole hayride was like oh I know that house that's John Wayne Gacy's house

41:29.560 --> 41:32.920
look in the crawl space there's a strobe light a kid's trying to get out whoa

41:32.920 --> 41:38.440
that's fucked up that really happened yo let's go eat pizza like but it was

41:38.440 --> 41:42.280
nothing like that it was like paper mache lollipop people going like

41:42.280 --> 41:47.760
habada habada habada and then all of a sudden he's like hey Dwayne I don't know

41:47.760 --> 41:51.680
if we should be out when should we tell my parents I'm pregnant hey don't worry

41:51.680 --> 41:55.160
about your baby I'll take great care of it we'll love it forever oh my god he's

41:55.160 --> 41:59.000
gonna go please don't I want to die I want to fucking die oh my god this happened

41:59.000 --> 42:05.840
45 times this year and the guy comes out it does this like bad fucking improv

42:05.840 --> 42:11.200
performance with a ski mask and a hatchet going like oh hey hey you guys and

42:11.200 --> 42:16.840
he's decided all serial killers are from New Jersey oh hey hey you didn't happen

42:16.840 --> 42:24.080
to see anything back there did you and everyone no one says anything because

42:24.080 --> 42:28.440
you can't that's called social engineering Dan oh you didn't you don't

42:28.440 --> 42:31.960
have to see anything did you and I think because it says it in his script like

42:31.960 --> 42:35.600
even though everyone's just going like this he keeps like singling out people

42:35.600 --> 42:40.760
go yeah what about you man did you look like you saw something and she's like

42:40.760 --> 42:48.960
no I didn't like she's what what do you what do you think happens or something

42:48.960 --> 42:55.560
I saw it was fucking you put put the ax down I mean obviously that character knew

42:55.560 --> 43:00.080
we saw something he just shot you people and he was speaking very honestly what

43:00.080 --> 43:03.840
do you think happens if you say you did it we just watch you well here's some

43:03.840 --> 43:09.080
things on the list of that won't happen because that's easier he won't touch you

43:09.080 --> 43:15.120
and you won't stand up you won't touch the wire above your head the tractor

43:15.120 --> 43:18.640
will keep going and I mean what do you think the whole that's so confusing it's

43:18.640 --> 43:21.560
like why didn't they personalize it for that one moment because I was like

43:21.560 --> 43:26.360
listen as unattractive as this idea is like the truth is if we were truly in a

43:26.360 --> 43:30.120
realm where we've seen all the shit that we've seen tonight this guy is the

43:30.120 --> 43:38.120
closest ally we have he has a gun like we're obviously traveling through

43:38.120 --> 43:44.000
dimensions we don't know his story maybe we're gonna fight maybe we judge him and

43:44.000 --> 43:47.760
we find out oh those two people killed his parents or something in the 60s

43:47.760 --> 43:51.480
but I don't we don't know maybe he was framed the whole thing happened to the

43:51.480 --> 43:57.240
dark with strobe like I was like it wasn't scary as my point right it wasn't

43:57.240 --> 44:05.720
scary I'm 42 I want to go on a children's ride and dare me more I also have

44:05.720 --> 44:11.760
complaints about spider-man 9 I'm 49 years old I deserve better in my

44:11.760 --> 44:17.680
spider-man movie all right I just heard myself it took me 50

44:17.680 --> 44:25.720
minutes but I'm ready to go up I think a valuable lesson don't applaud me saying

44:25.720 --> 44:30.840
I'm a good hayride and that's one to grow on a beginning a middle on an end

44:30.840 --> 44:35.680
that's the problem with that was all over the map now I went to not not scary

44:35.680 --> 44:39.760
firm which we talked about no don't bring it up I grew up in Southern

44:39.760 --> 44:44.520
California there's not very firm and in Halloween there is not scary for I love

44:44.520 --> 44:50.440
puns in any format but even when they completely undercut the yes desired

44:50.440 --> 44:56.560
message not scary but actually that that's I actually only when Dino and Dan

44:56.560 --> 44:59.800
pointed out I never thought of it being not scary for him I never thought that's

44:59.800 --> 45:05.720
literally what like phonetically that's what it is I grew I grew up at not

45:05.720 --> 45:11.040
very far the out of the word scary I didn't and you just they had the word

45:11.040 --> 45:20.240
scary for Halloween right yeah it's not all year round but not scary farm in

45:20.240 --> 45:25.760
June I don't know what I say I retract that I retract that what if they what

45:25.760 --> 45:28.600
if they found that out there like gentlemen the not scary brand is

45:28.600 --> 45:33.320
actually catching like wildfire in a way that not berries never did people like

45:33.320 --> 45:38.120
not scary things right they don't like they don't like jelly we found out what

45:38.120 --> 45:43.840
my pitch was that they should call it for Halloween not N.O.T. not scary farm

45:43.840 --> 45:49.960
comma not but spelled K.N.O.T.T. a positive yes there's layers there that you

45:49.960 --> 45:59.600
guys will have to Google there's a movie not scary not scary not not so when I

45:59.600 --> 46:03.560
went to not scary farm there would be there would be fistfights all the time

46:03.560 --> 46:06.960
because they were absolutely allowed to touch you the people that played the

46:06.960 --> 46:11.240
the ghouls and the boogins there they would just jump out of a they would

46:11.240 --> 46:15.440
they would just who they were who were they who there was there was boogins and

46:15.440 --> 46:20.080
googas oh they were really it was authentic then he's just getting shit for

46:20.080 --> 46:24.920
special special Guga boogins is a real love mythical character I think people

46:24.920 --> 46:32.520
say boogins boogins yeah I call them the boogins look boogins it's like Dan

46:32.520 --> 46:37.960
it with bagel I he only read it so when we went there they would jump out and

46:37.960 --> 46:41.800
grab you from behind and scare the ever-loving shit out of you which isn't

46:41.800 --> 46:49.600
really being like scared as it's being startled exactly Millennials so I was

46:49.600 --> 46:52.680
going through a haunted house with Diana Madawassian is I think we're

46:52.680 --> 46:55.800
sophomores in high school we'll start in high school we go to Nassbury farm not

46:55.800 --> 47:00.360
scary farm and I'm we're going through and I had a big crush on Diana Madawassian

47:00.360 --> 47:12.480
who is still she knows yeah and I was she knows what she's doing I was I was a

47:12.480 --> 47:15.880
late bloomer but I was so afraid of girls I was so afraid so I had it by the

47:15.880 --> 47:20.160
hand we're going through it like when this little tunnel driven haunted houses

47:20.160 --> 47:23.560
things where people just jump out at you and stuff and you know I'm gonna walk

47:23.560 --> 47:26.520
through that little corridor there and it's gonna be a bunch of boogins jumping

47:26.520 --> 47:32.760
out at me so I have her by the hand I'm leading her down the hallway and I'm

47:32.760 --> 47:36.520
pulling her she's too afraid there's boogins jumping out at her I'm like

47:36.520 --> 47:40.480
Diana come on just run just come like this look we'll just we'll just go past

47:40.480 --> 47:46.800
this thing and my hand goes slack and I look and I go hey and I say hey and she

47:46.800 --> 47:52.040
head butts me that tooth if you get a close-up that tooth right there sticks

47:52.040 --> 47:57.520
out oh it's got a little piece of hair and tissue on it and that's why you say

47:57.520 --> 48:00.920
boogin you say boogins that's why you say that matter who's seeing matter

48:00.920 --> 48:08.160
who's seeing this isn't I'm haunted by the ghost of an Armenian head I would

48:08.160 --> 48:12.480
like to do it hurt at all by the way she moved my tooth up into my brain but

48:12.480 --> 48:22.920
hey that's our racist stereotype our Armenian skulls are just as soft as not

48:22.920 --> 48:26.920
in my experience Dan not in my experience well you've met a weird woman not

48:26.920 --> 48:36.400
an Armenian spokesmodel I apologies to my friends Rick Rick Rick Tussunian

48:36.400 --> 48:44.560
that's the first time you care about an actually good name Rick Tussunian all

48:44.560 --> 48:49.080
right Andy what were you gonna say come on we oh no I was just saying if we did

48:49.080 --> 48:53.880
a serve if we did like a survey I would say the very few Jews would go to these

48:53.880 --> 49:01.080
haunted house things is already if I wanted I just would take mushrooms on

49:01.080 --> 49:04.080
Halloween or something if I want to have a terrible what would it be like if it

49:04.080 --> 49:10.320
terrible horrible Andy and he say a couple Jews went to not scary for how

49:10.320 --> 49:16.880
would that go well they would be like oh you think this is a thing this is good

49:16.880 --> 49:23.400
for our eyes or I gave my mother one of those 3D books and like she looked at

49:23.400 --> 49:29.280
like you think this is good for your eyes yeah yeah mom that's why that's why

49:29.280 --> 49:33.800
everyone's required to have one at birth by the American Medical Association

49:33.800 --> 49:38.440
it's good for your eyes no we would never there's no chance is anybody else's

49:38.440 --> 49:47.880
fine tingling my spine's been oh oh I remember going through a haunted house

49:47.880 --> 49:53.640
with my brother my older brother who name of bones like like like like like I'll

49:53.640 --> 49:56.480
talk like like I went through a haunted house with him and then it was like I

49:56.480 --> 50:00.240
was scared and there was like I remember this chain link area what it's not chain

50:00.240 --> 50:03.960
link but it was like kind of like mall you know at the mall where they lower the

50:03.960 --> 50:07.160
thing so it's like room to reach through and that was their whole point was that

50:07.160 --> 50:10.520
there was like a whole chamber of zombies strobe lit and they were reaching

50:10.520 --> 50:16.200
through the thing and they were grabbing you this was the 80s this is the 80s if

50:16.200 --> 50:19.280
you weren't getting grabbed you know you weren't having you weren't grabbing back

50:19.280 --> 50:29.640
yeah then David Hasselhoff wasn't there so I got I got scared I was like a 10

50:29.640 --> 50:33.120
year old kid I feel like I was all my memories are from 10 but I was I was I

50:33.120 --> 50:36.840
was like I was like oh oh I got up scared but it was like scared like I don't

50:36.840 --> 50:40.040
know they're grabbing me and was scary and then I just remember like like like

50:40.040 --> 50:44.520
running away like down this hall is all these hands reaching through and the

50:44.520 --> 50:49.640
strobe light and then like looking back because I forgot my brother my big

50:49.640 --> 50:53.360
brother is five years older than me and I look back and just see this strobe lip

50:53.360 --> 50:58.760
in image of my my big brother going motherfucker don't you fucking touch my

50:58.760 --> 51:06.520
little brother and he's like and he's like kicking the fucking like and all

51:06.520 --> 51:12.120
the zombies are now strobe lit but totally fucking they're all like just

51:12.120 --> 51:19.160
uncomfortable like Albert Brooks characters just going like like okay this

51:19.160 --> 51:22.720
happens three times a week we got another one and he's just like motherfucker

51:22.720 --> 51:27.680
don't fuck it don't fuck and I was like like the fucking swirl of emotions I

51:27.680 --> 51:31.720
had because he's like oh that's nice he's not he's not beating me up he's like

51:31.720 --> 51:35.600
big he wants to he wants to beat other people beating up is just his way of

51:35.600 --> 51:43.000
saying things right when he's beating me up he's saying you now he's now he's

51:43.000 --> 51:49.520
noticing them so perfect for me yeah I think that every time he's fighting

51:49.520 --> 51:53.920
somebody he's fighting the boogins within himself I want to I want to tell

51:53.920 --> 51:56.400
not because I owe it to my brother because he wasn't he won't talk to me

51:56.400 --> 51:58.800
anymore because I talked to him talked about him on the podcast but in the

58:05.160 --> 58:12.040
pains like for them well it was a lot of hormones and no I know I was always I

58:12.040 --> 58:16.200
was always I don't know I was they had sized places when I was a kid there was

58:16.200 --> 58:20.560
like a what do you mean some kind of a prank show so yeah you had to line up in

58:20.560 --> 58:25.480
sized places so I like from shortest to tallest for what the bathroom for some

58:25.480 --> 58:30.560
kind of military light maneuver for what we do we ducked in calm old so we

58:30.560 --> 58:34.960

58:34.960 --> 58:39.200
right you don't remember you don't know about trouble we have to goddamn

58:39.200 --> 58:46.200
Rusky I'm still blacklisted I can't get movie roles because I'm blacklisted

58:46.200 --> 58:51.720
that's why you don't see me in movies because of my comedy is the affiliation

58:51.720 --> 58:57.080

58:57.080 --> 59:03.760
your tricks bitch but you did you guys I did we did drill we did tornado drills

59:03.760 --> 59:09.120
whether they would organize you in an rank of height size not right we weren't

59:09.120 --> 59:14.440
ranked I didn't have to go through our training what are you what are you right

59:14.440 --> 59:20.160
thumb at 411 no is anybody has never been arranged in a public school in

59:20.160 --> 59:25.440
sized places before yeah I see some photos maybe for like a photo yeah you're

59:25.440 --> 59:32.800
saying size places it's better than by race I guess let's line up by race unless

59:32.800 --> 59:39.120
doing so is a gateway to finally proving race is an artificial construct

59:39.120 --> 59:44.160
that's true like if there's some major event and they're like like well we

59:44.160 --> 59:48.840
olympics remember when Hitler lost the olympics Jesse Owens yeah he's like he

59:48.840 --> 59:52.480
didn't lose the Olympus Germany time to prove racism at the olympics and we're

59:52.480 --> 59:56.960
like he didn't lose are you gonna tell me something Germany won Germany won all

59:56.960 --> 01:00:02.960
the gold medals oh wet Jesse Owens gold medals track and field Jesse Owens

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:09.840
cleaned up you're too happy sure about how well Germany did 36 Hitler didn't

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:15.560
lose the olympics yes Jesse Owens won a couple of meets well Netanyahu was the

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:25.000
world here we go your friend your friend BB he's trying to say that Hitler

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.160
didn't even want to slaughter the Jews it was some muslims who convinced friends

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:36.240
put them up to it is that what he said it was what this is friends I said stop

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:40.560
smoking at the pool hall you're gonna exterminate six million people you keep

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:50.120
doing that those guys are no good nicks well yes the muslims did two and so did

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:55.080
half of Europe wanted to kill the Jews he hates the muslims BB not net don't

01:00:55.080 --> 01:01:00.720
get me started on religion folks well we do we do want you started well we've

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:05.360
already covered it I'm right and everybody love everybody love everybody

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:10.360
but Netanyahu is he hates the he's such a he's such an evil man that he's wants

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:13.600
to change the history he wants to hit little look good that's his plan now

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:20.000
it wasn't as bad as what we've been making them out to be he didn't want to

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:26.040
he just wanted to give the Jews a talking to I love the fact that for real a

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:31.120
real thing on the table was relocate all the Jews to Madagascar I think you're

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:36.520
gonna say is that a Disney movie or did that really wait what was that on the

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:42.040
table that was the original pitch okay I never heard this no for real that they

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:45.800
wanted it they wanted there's an island off the eastern coast of Africa we'll

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.920
just send everybody there they're that's kind of untenable that's gonna be

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:54.960
pretty complicated can I do the Jewish reaction to that Madagascar

01:01:54.960 --> 01:02:02.640
not bad not so tropical be worse have you been to have you been to Poland not

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:08.040
so good you're you're right you're right across the coast from Libertacia it's

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:15.240
great I'm not yeah I'm not going into the area only because I'm so ignorant of

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:19.360
it I'll end up like running roughshod with my dumb jokes oh I know the way I

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:27.080
know the world I know World War two that's one time period if you could cast

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:33.840
yourself as any character Andy in World War two allies access it could be a

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:39.800
Russian peasant it could be an officer you could be anybody go back in history

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:43.720
portrayers who would you like to portray back and well I first I can say

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:47.320
that I used to have a joke where I said that my career is going so poorly you

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:51.160
know I my career is going so badly I would have played the Jew in Nazi

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:55.640
propaganda films you know it's like someone has someone has to do it someone's

01:02:55.640 --> 01:03:04.440
gonna do it they're gonna cast somebody and then the other the other thing I

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:09.000
had a joke I was like there's no small rule the other thing I looked scared

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:15.080
already there was that movie downfall which is a great movie downfall is one

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:19.640
of the best of all time it's Hitler in the bunker based on his secretary one

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:24.080
that the clips from that everyone uses as the means yes yes yes and based on

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:29.560
the documentary with his secretary yes Hitler had a secretary yeah so I just

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:34.080
may watch all worlds at war that she's awesome the secretary so my thing was

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:37.760
that I would have liked to have punched up that script downfall because I would

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:41.800
have one scene where I walk in I go I just got back from Hitler's bunker has

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:54.440
he been acting strange but I probably would have played I probably would have

01:03:54.440 --> 01:04:02.120
played who would I have played maybe Mussolini that would be the best B

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:07.000
story to a world war two movie ever that's like stars Hitler or like stars

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.960
patent or something but it's like the cut to Hitler and he's like well I'm so

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:17.080
mad but then it's like what's Mussolini doing and it's you don't say I don't like

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:23.040
it yeah you know what why don't you just hang me in the public square

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:30.800
from my memory of a high school World War two the history it's like sort of

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:36.000
like like Italy was sort of Italy was it only ended up on their hat and a ring

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.240
they ended up on the ally side towards the end of the war I found out he was a

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:44.280
windsock he went whatever yeah it was just sort of like and you see the

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:48.800
footage of him not that Hitler looks any less ridiculous but like like like like

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.640
like the guy who was thinking there's other always that footage where he got

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:58.320
he talks like this it's like the iron chic looked more natural like it's so

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:01.560
weird like like like because people were like they're actually they didn't have

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:04.800
cameras on them ever so they were like yeah I'm gonna do this because I saw a

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:08.600
guy do this in a movie awesome footage when when Mussolini bones out of Italy

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:13.800
because he's just completely like left like surrenders and he goes to Nazi

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:17.920
Germany and he gets off a plane and Hitler sees Mussolini who's lost so

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:21.760
much weight because you think it was this big hail robust you know like your

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:27.760
burner with a workout plan kind of thing and and Hitler sees him it's like you

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:31.560
can see like wow you've you don't look so good Mussolini and I'm Hitler Hitler

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:37.040
saying that to him look at me look like the Pringles Spencer how would you do

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:41.720
logo Spencer you're you're a you're a mythologist and a fantasy role player

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:49.680
what a Holocaust denier what is your what is your opinion about what's your

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:57.160
take on the how would you cast yourself if you had to portray a role back in

01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:03.400
then or if you know how do you see yourself definitely definitely just

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:09.520
just one of those SS guys they just they just get the most they get the most fun

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:16.560
you know they're not really do they don't have their name in history you know

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:24.880
but they they did all sorts of terrible great things I didn't expect you to go

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:30.880
that direction was the question what kind of Nazi would you be

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:47.160
because if that is the case then everything's fine he would have been

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:54.360
he would I'd be a handsome blonde Nazi that's what I would be oh devilish oh in

01:06:54.360 --> 01:07:06.200
the fun get the Jews off my line oh in the fun just a guy who does you know a

01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:46.280
like it's like oh it's like I physically skipped it's a yeah because the bump in

01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:52.320
the road made me make the sound I make when I'm getting into a car so he went

01:09:52.320 --> 01:10:01.440

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:11.080
ask from God all right where were you take it oh I love the money but I hate

surprise left Wafa you would be in the Luftwaffe I would yes I also by the way

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:26.680
I said you could be access or allies but you don't have to be German in this you

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:30.040
could be anybody you want I'd be Ramo I would play Ramo you'd be wrong oh yeah

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:39.960
you'd be a great desert go down that go down the desert further and go down to

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:46.160
Cape Town what do you think is a secret to

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:51.920
tactical maneuvers with tanks well you have to let you ask yeah oh was it you

01:10:51.920 --> 01:11:02.200
oh yeah you have to triangulate you do I do a rear guard entry that sounds bad I

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:05.920
don't know anything about I'm gonna make right now that I can't even improv you

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:12.600
be a good Ramo oh yeah just emotionally I'd be good yeah fire up the tanks you

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:17.880
know you have you have sunk fly warm up the tank warm up the tank yeah you know

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:22.760
what I think a good war strategy would be but but I can only test this and by

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:27.000
losing millions of lives you want what do you want the music for this or no no

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.960
there's no music necessary I'm because I'm workshopping this I mean we don't go

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:37.480
on until Tuesday the the the I I'm just thinking like improvisation just bit

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:42.360
balling just thinking like through all okay like I'm thinking like so you like you

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:46.760
put yourself in charge of everybody like you go like I'm in charge of all the

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:54.240
armies right like in my country yeah like and then you go like you go I always

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:58.960
know what I'm doing and it was like I'm doing and then you secretly tell one guy

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:03.040
like right underneath you go like don't ever tell me anything like like like

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:07.360
like but like just let me go let me do my thing and then and then you just

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:13.200
run the whole war so George W. Bush and Cheney yeah he won right he fucking

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:19.480
like yeah yeah yeah yeah I think it's like if you were a strategist what you

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:24.280
would do is you would go like oh don't tell me anything and then let me fucking

01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:29.600
like stand on balconies and because if I slip up it'll be the fucking greatest

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:34.760
strategy since D-Day like it'll be like like cuz I'll just be like I know what

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:38.240
I'm doing and like like like and then there's just a guy just running a war

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:43.920
underneath you I don't know if that would work sounds like you someone would

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:49.880
see through it at some point why is there a guy underneath the podium he

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:54.720
doesn't have to be that's you're thinking of police academy that's the answer

01:12:54.720 --> 01:13:03.560
is because I'm a horny was that you that sucked my dick you guys have to watch

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:10.000
police academy through this like post boat trip post post Caitlyn Jenner

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.480
post fucking like 2015 world like just watch a movie called police academy

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:20.280
where it's just like the one of the runners of the big like yeah and it's

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:25.280
just like the joke is that the the head of all the police

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:33.320
comment down thinks that Steve Gutenberg filleted him right and so he and he's

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:40.680
and he's just like like he's just he's apparently not gay but thinks Steve

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:44.760
Gutenberg is and it's not the joke isn't that the common down is like in the

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:51.440
closet the joke isn't the common down is like yeah I'm so straight that I I don't

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:55.920
want that blowjob to get to me but it felt so good right like it's just a

01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:01.160
weird we were we were so in the closet back then that we were healthier a

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:05.960
little bit a lot of ways because we put people in the center square and we like

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:12.120
celebrated like you mean actuality you know we celebrated gayness like in a way

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:16.480
that we couldn't after we actually acknowledged that it was offensive to

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:20.280
dehumanize people like I it's I think that goes with everything really it's

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:24.240
like you're sort of like there's that day when you graduate to being taken

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:28.240
seriously and everything stops being celebratory but you're right though in

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:32.280
a way because the fact that you can't really have someone like Paul Lynn

01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:35.760
there's a character in a way because you know you'd be stereotypical yeah but

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:39.080
the fact that yeah we didn't know like nobody knew what was going on back right

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:44.960
and so in half the people like yeah I mean I was one of them like like the

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:50.280
biggest bands were Queen and the village people right I don't care if you've ever

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:55.480
heard of them listen to those names their gimmick was not to anyone in the

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:59.760
in Wisconsin there there was it was not known that the gimmick had anything to

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:04.320
do right any form of lifestyle they're all look at the fireman look at the no

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:07.720
yeah look at they wear different outfits and they're singing about the YMCA I

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:11.920
don't know why and then now it's the Navy they're following it with I don't

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:17.080
know they're like any other group they sing about weird things those guys have

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:23.200
a lot of energy and Queen Freddie Mercury was like a fucking belt in that

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:27.080
house like like every America was like yay these people are great every

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:30.320
throughout history I've ever seen that documentary the cellulite closet you

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:34.480
very seen that I am interested to see that because I'm 30 years later but but

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:39.120
like the idea that like like like yeah obviously like there's a not to be

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:44.280
stereotypical but there's a lot of talent like like sequestered in the in the

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:52.680
in the gate like like you are like a prosecuting attorney it's about the

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:58.680
power is now it's 2015 so it's not progressive to say it anymore like five

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:02.360
years ago I was like I love gay people they're so talented now it's like you

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:07.640
weird homophobic weird yeah yeah they're not anything that was my closer was

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:14.720
let's hear it for the gate but but all of that mid 80s late 80s like all this

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:19.840
giant pool of talent like like so many of them died and so like you didn't just

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:24.840
lose artists and like you know singers and like like like visual artists like

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:29.200
you lost you know architects and great minds writers politicians like like a

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:34.800
huge swath of an incredibly intelligent hip happening like section of our

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:38.760
population gone and I don't know that we totally recovered from that like I

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:43.520
think that's a huge like one of the reasons that way we kind of went into a

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:50.520
little bit of a cultural downslide is you had the comedy boom of the late 80s

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:56.200
there was some quality left there were two great gigs back in the 80s you could

01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:01.180
be extended comic or a guy that made brick walls behind comics oh my god the

01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:07.480
brick laying boom winner they're gonna a piece of that brick that brick

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:12.320
concession boy oh boy or if you sold nacho materials back then you can make

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:18.560
money that's what the big if you if you sold giant mallets yeah you know I

01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:24.640
used to I still call Gallagher in June and ask him what melons look good

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:29.560
should I go for the Crenshaw is that looking good is he a is he a good

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:34.200
metric or a bad one I mean he's well he's using them just a right yeah so

01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:38.800
are those the ones that are good to eat that's now I'm really mad at him

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:44.020
it's no upside there's no upside to what he's doing he's ruining perfectly good

01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:48.080
fruit I thought those were I thought that was food that was someone was gonna

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:54.680
throw away do you think he went down to the market and if you tell me if you

01:17:54.680 --> 01:18:00.520
tell me next that his jokes could have fed people I will I will lose my mind

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:05.560
he spends you just spend eight or nine hours a day making sure that they were

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:12.440
all rotten and not good to eat I wish I hadn't said that too as well how can you

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:25.160
follow this guy with the all of our artistic people were dead okay Andy Andy what

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:35.400
is this a tragedy club all of a sudden I mean with a way it's it's 1985 you you

01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:41.640
have to your stand-up career will not survive there's a guy with a hammer for

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:48.240
a head that's like killing on star search there's there's a lady that plays

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:52.360
two violins and she's she's funny too but she plays two violins like like what's

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:57.480
what would your gimmick be gun to your head like what if you was like eat what

01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:07.800
you kill I would go I would go full stereotypical Jew that's not I thought

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:11.840
we're role-playing now it's not it's not he wasn't he wasn't gonna say I get up

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:16.200
and look at a stainless steel mirror and wonder what my when hover cars are gonna

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:20.680
it wasn't anything I got one scene for Rahm I figured out one scene for the

01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:24.360
Rommel movie is me is Rommel what do you mean we're out of gas it's called a

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:42.760
tank Thanksgiving Andy kindler is Rommel Rommel wait hey I admire you so much

01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:48.040
but then part of me is like what what are you doing you're thinking about that

01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:52.440
during the show right yeah what's the matter with me it's so boring to you

01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:57.720
you're just like a part of you know I got it it's just in the background you

01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:01.080
have that much process he's like a squirrel he could be complete nuts that's

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:05.520
right that's right cheek what he's doing I would like to think that that the show

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:09.640
was like fully engaging Andy kindler's brain but it's not possible I think he's

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:14.080
he's like he's like a spider he has I'll embrace it I won't take it personal no I

01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:21.280
think I have a lot of problems and I do have ADHD that kind of a thing no I'm

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:28.960
plugged in do you want to go back to my dumb you said cuz you said what would

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:34.320
you what would you cuz it's a joke it's a joke game but I mean there might be an

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:38.760
answer I would be like what would we do in that era crazies I would be the guy

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:43.360
who I can't even think of a really hacky thing what would be good for me song

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:48.400
parodies well you you did my well no but but but Andy what I'm asking is like

01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:52.760
like based on what can we get a couple song based on what you're good at like

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:57.240
like like like based on your actual like oh shit I want to survive and I'm

01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:02.040
being told that in order to survive I have to like stick out right amongst

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:09.120
like this cavalcade of care we're loud loud suits yeah yeah I mean what would

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:15.440
you hey folks come on what am I nuts what but what do I know I bought this

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:24.280
suit I could be Reagan Reagan guy Reagan guy Reagan guy Reagan guy yeah be

01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:33.560
Reagan guy yeah hey I'm not gonna mention AIDS who we were like yeah Kevin

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:37.160
Meany do you know Kevin me I love Kevin me he's not like he seems he was so funny

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:40.120
and it's like like like I'm not past that's I mean it's just like he's still

01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:44.760
around like he's still around it's so funny but like his gimmick was like he

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:49.200
just like landed it's so funny of people like you land on shit like Larry the

01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:54.120
cable guy is like his name not even from the south yeah I named named Dan

01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:57.520
Anderson or whatever there's YouTube videos of him doing jokes about Velcro

01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:01.560
but and then like at one point in his stand-up act there's like a guy that

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:06.080
comes over with cable and he does his impression of this idiot that's coming

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:10.240
over with cable right the way and then everyone's like like oh what an idiot

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:14.280
that guy is that's so funny and then it's just like after time the Velcro jokes

01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:19.560
go away and it's like it more and more like it just grows outward destiny but

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:27.200
like Kevin Meany's thing was the like like it's just it's just it's just

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:37.080
mother talking to oh yeah but it's like the joy of that yeah crazy person like

01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:40.360
I'm not knocking it at all you're gonna knock your eye out with it you probably

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:45.160
already have your one-eyed jokes that was like oh learn something about comedy

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:50.920
folks not everything is there was life before Dane Cook all right

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:56.720
Gilbert Gottfried used to do a thing when I was when I was like when I was

01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:03.640
like 15 years old humble brag the watching like I remember watching a

01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:06.840
Gilbert Gottfried special and I was like oh that's that guy that talks like this

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:11.680
and he's in the candy bar commercials like I think he was on SNL one year and

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:16.200
I don't know anything about him and I watched his 45 minutes set and it was

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:21.000
like holy shit this guy's a goddamn genius because he would cut he would come

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:26.280
out and he does the comedy and do the act and it doesn't really matter the

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:31.880
performance style but I do it like this and I do it like that and then but then

01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:36.040
he would pause and then there would be a pause and then he'd go

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:40.640
no why would you do something like that you know later would turn out I didn't

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:44.440
know he was doing his impression I think of Seinfeld yeah I used to do a he was

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:51.200
doing super ego it's Seinfeld it's perfect but I didn't even know it was

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:55.400
just funny that he was just doing like a dialogue he was doing his act and I do

01:23:55.400 --> 01:24:00.880
the joke and I do the set up and then the punchline pause now that's not

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:06.440
something you want to do why do you have to screech at people that sounds like

01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:10.320
Groucho a little bit well I'm not I'm not doing I'm not even going to attempt

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:15.520
like Gilbert Godfrey Seinfeld impression well he had that one joke where he

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:20.480
says uh he goes uh thank you the Martian ship landed in the and the head

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:24.600
Martian came up to me and he said Bank as ours a good actor how come he can't get

01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:32.440
a series Bank as our was it was a good actor

01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:41.440
Cassavetes oh these people don't know Bank as our now no you deserve the

01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:45.600
earth to burn to a crisp underneath your feet yeah I'm glad you don't know how to

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:54.160
desalinate seawater here's a hint you boil it it's just too expensive you're

01:24:54.160 --> 01:25:00.960
all gonna die it's a perfectly easy thing to do when there's eight of you

01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:06.160
you're all gonna die you should have your own your own tabloid there's no

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:11.500
water the planet's 80% water there's more of it every day it's too expensive to

01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:15.480
make it drinkable that's your hook that would be your catchphrase I'm too

01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:23.440
expensive to make it drinkable if you put half the money you put it to NASCAR

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:31.920
get her done I'm in a joke today I was a random joke I don't know why where I

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:35.360
was in this area I have no idea because I'm a hack and I'm old and whatever but

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:38.600
as I was like I don't know I was thinking about Jeff Foxworthy and it was

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:45.240
like who doesn't I wrote a tweet and it just said like I'm probably gonna

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:48.760
butcher my own funny tweet but it was just like the joke was just it was

01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:59.080
quote life life isn't given to people Amanda life as a test and I'm giving it

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:07.600
dash Fox leak dialogue from the trailer for Foxworthy by Aaron Sorkin because

01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:14.680
he's famous for giving a redneck test that okay so wait that Aaron Sorkin

01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:19.000
isn't famous no no Jeff Foxworthy is the inventor of walking and talking Foxworthy

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.520
and all caps so then I got so many tweets and there's a people like there's

01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:27.480
like one guy in particular it was like like Fox what Foxworthy is that about

01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:34.600
Jeff Foxworthy scratch that off my list and I know I'm 42 but I'm like like

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:40.240
what what do you mean what did he mean and he's like he kind of stooped a

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:44.360
little bit albeit respectfully like because he's he's not he's not being

01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:49.240
condescending but he understands that I didn't get his joke and he goes like the

01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:54.080
premise of the joke as I is that I mistook the title for being about Jeff

01:26:54.080 --> 01:27:00.800
Foxworthy and so I was no longer a lot oh enthusiastic about seeing the movie

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:06.520
and so I said oh oh I get it now but you're still gonna go see the movie

01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:13.520
right and he goes well now that yes to further bury the shame of my bad

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:19.680
attempted humor yes I will go see it and I said well hold on a second oh if they

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:24.920
make a you know if there's a movie called Foxworthy they're gonna have to

01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:29.680
expect you to make the association with the guy that you thought of immediately

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:37.320
so it wasn't a lame joke you know world where that movie exists and he's like

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:42.720
okay yeah you're right I guess I just like the idea of seeing those red necks

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:50.400
walking out of the movie theater puzzled and I said yeah dumbasses yeah

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:59.880
said they talk about failing a test like the famous test that Jeff Foxworthy

01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:04.480
what's he doing what happened to the test there at the end and what's the

01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:08.520
famous test and he dance like he's not here dancing a very weird place right

01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:15.920
but yeah okay I don't think people would consider it a test you're you're

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:21.560
saying you know you're a red red redneck when right yeah Dan sees that as Jeff

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:27.640
Foxworthy issuing a test on you oh now hold on a second all right if you can

01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:32.040
follow answer the following questions and you just might be a redneck that's

01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:39.000
exactly literally his bit that's why his set wasn't called pollock jokes or like

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:44.040
he literally only just did that you might be a redneck if yes he instead of

01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:48.080
saying how can you tell when a redneck screws in a light bulb he said you might

01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:54.160
be a redneck if boy okay all right bad guy will you ruin the originality of his

01:28:54.160 --> 01:29:00.480
concept with that now I realize it's it seems like a similar like a familiar saw

01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:05.720
well there's some poor kid out there now it's looking for that movie and and he's

01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:09.160
gonna eventually find out that I was big you worry about him the rest of the day

01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:13.320
that guy like what have I done and I heard his feelings that's what I do on

01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:18.880
no because he was proud well I know no I would know I care nothing for I worry

01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:22.080
about I worry about the virtual environment so I worry about I worry

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:26.240
about me doing my job of like like fitting it and making people happy yeah

01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:32.440
well I think the amount of time I spent on Twitter is exact I mean yeah you came

01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:36.400
we've took different flights out of New York I landed in Seattle and I had a

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:41.920
bunch of notifications saying like make them stop make what stop I laid on my

01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:45.720
bed and like I tried to get I think how do I scroll back to the to the origin

01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:55.680
story I had a Twitter meltdown is this true of course it's true that's a word

01:29:55.680 --> 01:30:01.520
that has an empirical definition isn't it how could you ever argue with it if

01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:08.720
someone says you're having a Twitter meltdown meltdown oh yeah yeah I'm

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:15.880
always thinking Andy by the time Dan finishes the story I want three more

01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:20.600
rommel jokes okay okay god damn it you're taking you're making fun of the

01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:25.520
fact that the show isn't enough for his brain no I'm saying his brain is

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:30.440
so commodiously yeah he can't it can't be filled with my petty stories about

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:34.880
defending my behavior you misread me I had the same problem of everybody else

01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:40.280
in the world which is like huge what's going on how how do I look how do I look

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:44.040
while this is happening yeah am I bombing am I not bomb in general every

01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:49.120
competition every minute every meal did I bomb my bombing am I going over well

01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:52.760
so that's what yeah that's it with me which is all I've ever said no no no

01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:56.560
I'm not I'm not wait now I'm worried and I'm doing the same thing because I'm

01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:59.800
worried do you think that I have any problem with with we're doing an

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:05.240
improv an uncomfortable improv now no no no no let me say before we go further I

01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:09.520
was concerned that's the beautiful jellyfish like like crazy ballet that

01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:12.440
we do if we could all just be honest about the fact that we all are

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:16.920
constantly concerned that that is confident and wonderful as we think we

01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:20.840
all are that there's a word for something that doesn't need any input at

01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:24.080
all or any perception of itself through other people's eyes which is like a

01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:29.120
fucking rock or a delay got an error like it's not worth living to be that

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:33.160
and it's like we're primates we're constantly fucking just like hacking it

01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:37.760
up and like like trying to make sure that we're driving okay and it swirls the

01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:41.560
irony that we also know that people don't like people that aren't confident

01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:46.400
people that are there to think and all that stuff but but yeah and we all do

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:51.600
that it's like only if you're self-aware you do that right if you're like 90%

01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:57.960
of the world then I have to carry you and then you go where are my footprints

01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:01.240
and I'm like mother fucker

01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:14.360
it's my joke the Foxworthy movie not yours I'm the Jesus of in that tweet yes

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:20.600
it's the worst when you make a joke and then someone tries to tag your joke

01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:26.400
with your literal joke or that they came up with it happens a lot how can you

01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:33.000
think up everyone kill yourself yeah like to make up an example let's say

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.760
he's got like you're tweeting you're watching a soccer game I'm gonna make

01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:39.080
up an example because I don't want to try to riff like real things I was like

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:46.640
you're like I thought it was I thought it was weird of of Pele to Pele I would

01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:51.640
go with Pele I tried to pick a topic that wouldn't be distracting yeah just

01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:58.200
generic soccer cat Kathy current cast your memories back to the early 70s you

01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:02.760
want to go with Ronaldo you go with Ronaldo over here I'm all I'm as

01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:08.520
interested in you guys about the flake gate but I thought it was weird of so and

01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:13.600
so to hand out such and such you know some comedy for this you tweet that

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:18.920
it's like a joke so then like this so then so then there's like eight replies

01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:25.080
underneath that where people who simply read what you said yeah and apparently

01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:30.960
assumed that what you are in their life is just like some piece of driftwood

01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:35.400
that provides just fucking unentertaining information and they're

01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:38.280
just like they get their blinking tie out and they're just like hey what's that

01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:41.160
you say you say that well how about I connect it to that what are you hey

01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:48.320
highway and it's like wait a minute what the fuck I just said my joke is dry

01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:52.760
and subtle and if like it should be recognizable as a joke

01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:58.720
blinking tie that's the one I would have gone with in the very time I like

01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:02.680
like you got Pele blinking time I guess you'd have to think of a real example

01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:11.720
what the yeah anything that's that that teeters towards satire or irony someone's

01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:15.800
going to absolutely totally miss absolutely think like just read it

01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:20.800
literally and then make their own joke there would be nothing absolutely

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:24.600
nothing in fact it would be shameful it would be market research for instance

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:28.720
to find out that if somebody was like what do you mean that doesn't seem like

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:32.280
a good thing for Pele to do at all like you know what my joke didn't land

01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:36.480
thank you thank you sir like like you know what that's one percent of the

01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:40.200
audience but it still counts for me like I'm gonna work hard I'm a kindler about

01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:46.040
it I'm a kindler and the but but it's the thing that fucking I don't it just

01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:52.600
scrambles my circuits is when somebody's like like Pele more like melee since you

01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:56.160
don't and you're like wait no but it doesn't you can't know you're using my

01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:00.440
my launch pad is not your point of departure it means fictional I made a

01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:06.120
joke you live you live in a joke world you're satirizing a joke universe you

01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:11.800
didn't even think about anything you're just connecting words insane and what

01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:15.760
do you say you can't say I just don't know what to do and everyone goes like

01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:20.120
you do anything why are you on Twitter you're such a loser why are you on

01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:24.800
Twitter I love having a meltdown why are you wasting your time talking to me

01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:31.240
that says a lot about you look at you you're gross you know what you're a

01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:36.440
piece of shit did you like making that guy feel bad well guess what you're

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:47.480
fat oh so so it's bad to make a nice try but what you did was unacceptable but

01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:51.880
you're fat and you're not funny and your shell got canceled and you know I'm

01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:56.800
like I know what you're trying to do and it doesn't feel like anything that's my

01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:06.880
point I can't feel I am how much clearer could I be that I ran into the streets

01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:12.920
and smashed a Ferrari that was driving by and plucked the least likeable

01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:18.040
background person that existed in that moment and bit its head off after saying

01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:23.440
I'm going to bite this guy's head off do you know why because I'm getting a

01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:31.720
divorce and I'm very unhappy with myself a good thing it happened to the one

01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:38.760
fucking guy that deserved it hilarious don't follow me if you don't like it

01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:44.320
don't fucking put all of the fucking lake like this weird like contingent of

01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:50.080
people like huh I saw the paced magazine article I didn't what the fuck are you

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:56.440
talking about I am so sorry that the shit I go through in my kitchen at 3am

01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:03.040
ends up in something called paced magazine I am not complaining about

01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:09.280
that at all however I will tell you that has nothing to do with me your

01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:15.280
relationship with paced magazine is not my fucking problem starting with the

01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:19.240
fact that this is where you get your news and ending with the fact that you

01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:25.680
follow people you hate and that you seek to destroy them by being so mean to

01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:31.320
them and that you're so bad at it that I just want to kiss you because you can't

01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:41.880
even hurt my feelings Chevy Chase oh that hurts so bad you're right I am so

01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:50.760
famous I really am so untalented for how much money I have you're doing great

have you considered being Hannibal Lecter you really got that saying

01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:04.520
exactly what's gonna undo them thing down nobody I went I went sat on my back

01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:10.080
patio and I was watching my dogs take a shit after 48 hours of me going like I

01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:13.960
did this and then people are like I saw that article in Huff Poe and you're a

01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:19.040
bad person I'm like again I don't know what you're talking about I've died this

01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:23.080
is my only place I had a back the fucking said I'm gonna pull this kid's

01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:31.360
legs off then I did it I went back to it several times it's very funny I feel

01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:36.960
nothing it's my whole point I said it I've never been more confident in

01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:42.320
anything I've done in my entire life like what is the opposite of a meltdown a

01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:50.680
build-up I built up what giant roach okay where is that as long as it's

01:38:50.680 --> 01:39:00.960
something that never happens in L.A. and was worth derailing a god I made that

01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:03.360
roach

01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:13.400
you're contriting about it at least that's nice no I'm not okay I'm like I

01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:16.840
am not at all because I like I said I went through it I'm like I know it's

01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:20.760
just funny it was like an art piece like I don't know this person why aren't people

makes up for my lack of personality how about one of my favorite things you ever

01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:53.520
did you're you're at Igby's and you went off on Dennis Miller for a hundred

01:43:53.520 --> 01:44:02.120
years hey look look it's like crime and punishment with carousel and he's so sad

01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:11.000
now he sells smart you listen to him on AM radio if you ever I do driving home

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:14.680
oh god he sells something called smart mouth like he sells these products and

01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:19.480
you know he hates doing it but he's like yeah smart mouth like a breath like a

01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:24.040
breath of shore type thing because he's got a smart mouth that's marriage made

01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:29.520
in heaven synergy conservative heaven if you like synergy baby synergy I haven't

01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:35.200
seen this much synergy since Pepsi turned out to be the most favorite soda and

01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:39.400
back to the future too yeah look look highs and look highs and burglary the

01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:45.560
only uncertainty I see is some some other reference they were late

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:58.640
he was he was he was he was he a switcher was he liberal when when well

01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:03.120
here's the true I think the truth is is that he used to what Kevin Rooney was a

01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:06.200
guy used to work on his show and I think Kevin Rooney was very politically

01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:09.360
aware but I don't think Dennis Miller was ever that politically aware but he was

01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:14.760
funny black and white movie liberal guy right like I thought but I think he was

01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:18.400
a faux liberal I think he was always he was a people pleaser which that's good

01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:23.120
enough for me that's that's you're done as a liberal like like just be a people

01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:27.920
pleaser well I thought he was always unpleasant no no but I mean he was trying

01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:31.600
that was all I'm saying like if that's your goal then you're fine because I

01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:36.480
will lead you to all the right votes and all the right behaviors like like right

01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:40.400
otherwise it's you're going like well I gotta protect me and mine are like okay

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:43.340
well now you're getting into yeah it was up is I mean just unbelievable this guy

01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:48.560
was rich filthy rich lives up in Santa Barbara and he's still miserable since

01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:56.240
9-11 miserable like it was miserable and then use that as a like I'm using

01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:59.840
divorce I'm just like I'm getting divorced like come on you were already a

01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:07.600
piece of shit these colors don't run and you were a San Francisco right oh no

01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:11.200
you LA where did I start you mean yeah well I'm from New York but I started out

01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:14.800
in LA okay so you weren't one of the San Francisco no but I knew but I used to go

01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:18.080
up in the late 80s and early 90s and all those guys when they were living up

01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:21.880
there David Feldman and Brian Paul saying and all those guys yeah what is that

01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:26.280
like I hate to dwell on because I'll never Dennis Miller like the I remember a

01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:29.920
special mr. Miller goes to Washington do you remember that is this after the

01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:33.880
change I don't think it was but no it's way before 9-11 is that what you mean is

01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:37.680
there I don't remember that change yeah I don't know where the change happened

01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:40.200
that's why I'm asking so I know it was after 9-11 because he used to have a

01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:45.240
what his most famous one is like a black and white is the funny one but I don't

01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:48.200
even know that would be funny if I watched it now was he like could you have a

01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:51.480
conservative slant in that I'm just so curious about that I think it was more

01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:56.760
like he would be like he would be liberal like about gay issues and things

01:46:56.760 --> 01:47:00.720
like that but then he would be like yeah let's fry him right so like libertarian

01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:06.560
that's right it's like yeah hey who cares about gay people as long as I got

01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:11.040
money boom right but also he had great writers on the old Dennis Miller show so

01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:14.400
I think people thought that he was a politically aware guy I don't think he

01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:17.920
really ever was I think he's a guy who knows references but doesn't really know

01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:27.520
what they mean necessarily but it's just like colonel Scott's he's like a how

01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:35.040
right he's that kind of encyclopedic memory for any reference oh like a boy

01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:40.240
Rogers all of a sudden triggers on vacation there and I hate those people

01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:45.840
look Marlene a detrick these people don't even care nobody cares about him

01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:49.560
anymore no that's the nice thing that's the thing who do you think is funny

01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:52.920
right now who's who do you think is a kicking ass I love it don't mean you

01:47:52.920 --> 01:48:00.680
James it don't mean there's so many great people Maria Bamford there's so

01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:05.280
many great people I always my mind Ron Funches

01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:16.200
Sheila McCrae cheers to Andy kindler for keeping a gender balance and his

01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:20.440
shout-out to young comics of the day yeah cheers to the same kindler for

01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:23.280
evoking the ghost of pirates

01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:35.880
she will be on your box I will guard this locker with me very barnacle in soul

01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:43.840
plus this airline food is unacceptable if you could resurrect Andy like like

01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:48.680
somebody dead like a dead comic you go see him do a set right now I would be I

01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:53.360
would pick Lenny Bruce because that only the only thing that I've seen is and I

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:56.000
actually enjoy it but a lot of people don't like it is the performance film

01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.880
which is the last yeah so I've seen things on Steve Steve Allen but like

01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:04.440
Richard Pryor we have that concert film which is still the greatest thing of all

01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:08.680
time I think that especially made but we don't have that Lenny Bruce as much

01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:12.120
except on the record yeah he would love to have seen him in the club the stuff

01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:15.560
I've seen Lenny Bruce like you don't like it doesn't match up with how funny he

01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:20.800
was to people that you know are like what they're talking about they saw him

01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:24.200
perform live like their relationship with Lenny Bruce is way different than

01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:27.680
what I get or the movie Lenny for example which is like nothing like Lenny

01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:31.760
Bruce at all what about Bill Hicks did you you must have I got to work with it

01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:36.480
I worked I was very lucky I got to work with Bill Hicks what the week after he

01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:42.840
got sober in 1988 three weeks in a row and he had just gotten and he was like

01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:47.280
kind of so angry and so hilarious like one night he was in Grand Rapids

01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:50.960
Michigan he goes yep next week I'll be on Letterman you people will still be

01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:59.240
here in this shithole he got so activated is that is it have we because I saw

01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:02.040
that documentary about him that was like largely pictures did you see that one

01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:06.480
I haven't seen that like the myth of Bill Hicks I have no I will very very readily

01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:12.000
accept that the myth is 100% and more like like accurate but I also wonder

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:15.880
do comics need that figure in their life of the guy that went rogue and became

01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:19.640
the funniest guy in the world and then and that big because and then pass a

01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:23.040
pathway well I don't know but it's like a lot of people see him and they go I

01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:26.800
mean I think he's one of these things like people who did see Lenny Bruce live

01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:31.040
or did see I mean Bill Hicks live was unbelievable because he was so seamless

01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:34.960
he was so like seamless in that he was talking to the crowd the way he would

01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:40.160
talk and so I think that that might be missed if you see his stuff on video

01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:44.080
right I don't know I mean he's got he has a lot of stuff on you know that he

01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:49.920
filmed but and people get caught up in the the I don't know they get caught up

01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:53.720
in the fucking like well all comics tried to be like him too well that's oh

01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:58.800
yeah the worst of them all yeah all right I didn't stand up when I was

01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:06.240
walking in the post-bill Hicks fucking ma'am right I was like like dude you're

01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:13.560
not that mad about anything you love cheese curds so much you were so funny

01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:21.680
eight minutes ago your entire club was bricks everywhere no you couldn't find

01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:26.040
a door to save your life that's what that's what drove Bill Hicks out of his

01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:31.640
mind yeah you started in Milwaukee yes do you remember any of your openers

01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:38.960
you have it Jeff why don't you go fuck yourself I have never I'm not saying do

01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:43.080
it I think do you I I'm not saying you must do one do you remember any of I know

01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:49.720
it's I don't like I'm going to say no and here's why it's 10 o'clock and I'm

01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:56.200
ashamed of one thing in my life and that is my stand-up set when I was 17 yeah

01:51:56.200 --> 01:52:00.920
but you know the lucky thing though was that we'd have cameras and like you

01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:04.600
it's like you're putting out some challenge for anyone in Milwaukee that

01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:10.720
has there's footage oh yeah did you have an acid wash jacket no worse I had a

01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:20.880
terrible act I watch an old footage of me there used to be a couple of rascals

01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:25.320
comedy club and they somehow I remember signing the release I could see my face

01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:28.760
as I signed it but it was like so they have all this footage of when I had first

01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:32.200
started and so I was scared to death but I did see a joke I like which was a

01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:36.920
world like in 1989 I wrote the joke Jews are obsessed with Hitler because we

01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:40.640
can't remember anything about the pharaoh

01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:49.160
like that holds up that holds up yeah I also did a lot of horrible I find that

01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:55.440
joke too topical I absolutely promise you that it's I like but in the story of

01:52:55.440 --> 01:52:58.280
my life is that I would go like nope you'd hate it you'd hate it you'd hate it

01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:01.880
people like dig it up and they'd go like wait that's awful I'd be like motherfucker

01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:09.880
I I told you I buried one thing like I asked you to bury it and again I'm not

01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:12.600
saying do it is there a joke that you're proud of you remember that you have one

01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:17.600
that you think might still hold up no no no no okay highlights that I remember I

01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:28.760
used the C word in my act like a lot I thought at 17 the reason unsuccessful

01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:35.520
comics didn't use it and Andrew dice clay did is because he was smart and

01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:43.520
brave and I used the C word in a giant chunk of my bit about how I didn't like

01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:58.640
women at my college that were of a certain category that were doing I did a

01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:02.800
then I would talk about jerking off for a while which is like fine we're in safe

01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:08.600
territory like like that's fine like like like like just punish yourself but

01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:13.040
and then I but I would at the time Jeffrey Dahmer had just eaten a bunch of

01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:20.440

01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:46.960
was like a I don't know what my what my premise was I don't know why it was in

01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:51.520
the country Western theme it was a song about masturbation and I would make the

01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:55.080
audience would clap and I would sing the song it was me rhyming about

01:54:55.080 --> 01:55:00.880
masturbation yeah but you're 17 right yes I wish I was 16 but what if you've

01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:03.480

01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:07.160
smoke a pipe at that age I do but I'm telling but all I'm saying is just that

01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:11.280
like I'm like everybody loves to like talk about how bad they were at all

01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:14.200

01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:38.360
Schrab my friend Rob Schrab say he was doing stand-up at the same time a couple

01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:43.240

01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:51.840
Schrab's version of the hack ears in Milwaukee Schrab's bits were like like

01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:06.560
Sorkin wrote a movie and you fucking panned through a club about Rob Schrab

01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:10.560
it's like oh here I am doing my bad stand-up and he would do his other bit

01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:17.880
was like oh you know keep Tonto and and bones from Star Trek but their their

01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:22.440
main job was telling their boss that people were dead and then he would talk

01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:25.640
about that and then he would and then he would do a split-screen effect where he

01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:30.320
would do him dead Kimusabi he's dead Jim him dead Kimusabi like and he was it

01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:34.320
but it was like he he called out the split-screen and it was 1991 and it was

01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:39.760
awesome this guy's so funny and now it's like oh remember we're bad stand-ups

01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:45.160

01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:48.560

Mr. Dan Harmon. Yeah! Dan Harmon! Hey we're gonna be in New York. Talk about New

01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:26.560
York for a second yeah because we saw we sold out the first New York show so we

01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:31.000
we did a second one the night after and we're pretty concerned. What are the

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:38.320
dates November? I don't know but Steve 13th and 14th so come to the I think 13th

01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:42.320
is sold out already. So if you're if you're around the east coast and want to

01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:45.560
come out or if you have a lot of discretionary funds I want to fly

01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:52.640
yourself out first class. If you're at the first show and you're like hey I

01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:57.520
think I'll come to both. The one upside of having no act is that you won't hear

01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:02.600
anything twice. Please come to both shows. Also the second show clothing

01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:15.760
