okay so you go on it doesn't\n\n04:10.320 --> 04:13.800\nmatter this is you can imagine for me the haunted hayride is a thing that just\n\n04:13.800 --> 04:19.400\nhaunts my ability to get home in Los Feliz it clogs up traffic from the five\n\n04:19.400 --> 04:24.960\nall the way to my place I don't drive anymore but I went there and you're\n\n04:24.960 --> 04:27.880\nbeing driven you know there's a tractor when you when you're there that's the\n\n04:27.880 --> 04:31.000\nirony is that you're driving and you're like slower than the tractor you sitting\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:36.520\non physical hay proper hay yeah there's hay so but there's no chairs so that's\n\n04:36.520 --> 04:41.080\nthe thing is like it's a chair on hay but here's the here's the thing about\n\n04:41.080 --> 04:44.920\nhay and not having chairs and the hayrides even haunted ones I would have\n\n04:44.920 --> 04:50.720\nwould have assumed before the two nights ago that they're like I don't know why\n\n04:50.720 --> 04:56.200\nyou'd be riding on hay but I know that you wouldn't be doing it with 65 people\n\n04:56.200 --> 05:02.040\nno it should be you and Terry Gar and the it should be you and Terry Gar\n\n05:02.040 --> 05:07.160\nor Andy Kiddler or like Mike Nesmith I don't care who it is as long as there's\n\n05:07.160 --> 05:16.960\nfour to eight of them that would be a fucking good hayride you guys are gonna\n\n05:16.960 --> 05:24.200\nhave to google three-quarters of that to find out why it would be dynamite you're\n\n05:24.200 --> 05:29.320\ngonna love it like when I call them the Coneval of Covech I'm like what just\n\n05:29.320 --> 05:35.880\nGoogle they but but it's hate so okay so what happens is is it loose I'm\n\n05:35.880 --> 05:41.600\npicture like a hay wagon it's loose hay it's loose slippery like effectively\n\n05:41.600 --> 05:49.000\nlubricating hay it's not it's not bales of tightly bound healthy dog shit like\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:54.640\nfirm like like like like like like like nobody's fed at table scraps it's like\n\n05:54.640 --> 05:58.760\nyou revealed some of your own backstory on that no I have the fact that my dog\n\n05:58.760 --> 06:03.760\ntakes nice firm healthy poops and that and that even just stop what you're\n\n06:03.760 --> 06:09.800\ndoing because I'm about to ruin the things that you used to all right to\n\n06:09.800 --> 06:15.600\nstop so everybody's just let me get to the fucking there's nothing there was\n\n06:15.600 --> 06:20.080\none thing so about that but the chain link there was a chain link area when\n\n06:20.080 --> 06:24.240\nyou stand in line and you get into the that there's a chain link area right\n\n06:24.240 --> 06:29.000\nbefore you're getting into the hay cart and they haven't all worked out they've\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:35.080\nbeen doing this for a long time not the scary parts but the crowd control parts\n\n06:35.080 --> 06:41.040\nthe scary parts are apparently decided on by committee three weeks before each\n\n06:41.040 --> 06:48.680\nthing and I don't even know I walked out with so many questions I was like I\n\n06:48.680 --> 06:52.760\nlike like did they are they just upset about school shootings is that why they\n\n06:52.760 --> 06:57.080\njust like just threw Rick random shit out there and just hoped it was a little\n\n06:57.080 --> 07:01.320\nscary but not upsetting like like like it was like it was like a mildly\n\n07:01.320 --> 07:06.720\nuncomfortable hayride not I would not call it haunted in the least by anything\n\n07:06.720 --> 07:15.560\nlike except for you know the ghost of pride and craftsmanship like I mean\n\n07:15.560 --> 07:20.480\nthat was certainly there like going remember me you forgot me and I was\n\n07:20.480 --> 07:25.080\nlike no the ghost of my I'm there's too many ghost jokes that they so take me\n\n07:25.080 --> 07:29.280\nthrough it you're cruising along I'm imagining at like one mile an hour as\n\n07:29.280 --> 07:32.120\nyou're going through a various little town I have something to tell you about\n\n07:32.120 --> 07:35.960\nbefore that though okay because the line you're in line and I was actually\n\n07:35.960 --> 07:40.200\nhappy to be there was VIP tickets for like five dollars more where you can\n\n07:40.200 --> 07:48.200\nlike walk past people and I'll do that in a fucking I would do that under normal\n\n07:48.200 --> 07:54.960\ncircumstances I would pay 500 times more than you would for the fun of walking\n\n07:54.960 --> 08:02.800\naround you if I had to walk eight more times the distance I would I would just\n\n08:02.800 --> 08:09.200\nso happy to be moving I would just walk around you and like and be rich I will\n\n08:09.200 --> 08:18.120\nI'm not I am not a man of the people but I I did not buy a VIP ticket on purpose\n\n08:18.120 --> 08:22.880\nbecause I was so high I was scared that I was gonna get scared because I said\n\n08:22.880 --> 08:28.480\nDino there's this is I don't like the people touching you and he said they\n\n08:28.480 --> 08:35.080\ncan't touch you they can't touch you they're not allowed to touch you which is\n\n08:35.080 --> 08:41.240\nlike the scariest thing in the world they're not allowed to touch you it\n\n08:41.240 --> 08:45.120\nsounds a little scary but then they keep repeating that they don't touch them\n\n08:45.120 --> 08:51.200\nthey won't touch you they're not allowed to touch you you're not allowed to touch\n\n08:51.200 --> 08:57.160\nthem it's it's like it's like it's like Jonestown and but there's like and then\n\n08:57.160 --> 09:00.680\nthere's like these like okay so you should you go through the line and then\n\n09:00.680 --> 09:04.640\nyou get into this chain link area that's designed to hold not the number of\n\n09:04.640 --> 09:11.240\npeople but the volume of flesh when when the chain link thing right before you\n\n09:11.240 --> 09:17.560\nget on the hay cart is full of human tissue they close it behind the last\n\n09:17.560 --> 09:22.680\nperson after they've shamed the front people you know good come on come on\n\n09:22.680 --> 09:26.280\nmove in move in and I thought the guy at first I was like oh he's like is he like\n\n09:26.280 --> 09:31.680\na like bad UCB or IO guy doing like a southern character to like create an\n\n09:31.680 --> 09:35.280\nair of like because otherwise he's like in the middle of Los Angeles like\n\n09:35.280 --> 09:39.880\nbossing people around who are drunk and high and and thought it would be funny\n\n09:39.880 --> 09:45.000\nif they paid you to try to scare me motherfucker and like and I and I thought\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:48.800\nthat's actually brilliant that he that they've adopted like this southern thing\n\n09:48.800 --> 09:52.740\nthis is like something that people in LA are like maybe like oh shit I saw I saw\n\n09:52.740 --> 09:57.240\nthose movies I'm not gonna fuck with this guy yeah this guy's Ned Beatty but he\n\n09:57.240 --> 10:03.440\nwas too authentic and too unfunny to have been trained in anything and he's\n\n10:03.440 --> 10:07.400\nbecause he kept doing these jokes he's like all right people so you get into\n\n10:07.400 --> 10:11.960\nthis chain link like like just just like this chain link like cauldron because\n\n10:11.960 --> 10:15.840\nthe doors open then you're gonna get on the hay cart oh it's gonna be so fun\n\n10:15.840 --> 10:19.520\nwhen you get on the hay cart so then you're there and then this guy just like\n\n10:19.520 --> 10:23.400\nyou know peanut style has his forearms over the top of the chain link fence\n\n10:23.400 --> 10:29.120\nlooking down at you and he has a little baby bullhorn because you're not that\n\n10:29.120 --> 10:35.720\nfar away and he got any guys like okay people oh got a couple rules for you\n\n10:35.720 --> 10:43.160\ngonna have a good time but you got to follow these rules do not touch the actors\n\n10:43.160 --> 10:49.560\nI repeat do not touch the actors that goes for touching him but and then he\n\n10:49.560 --> 10:53.200\nwould like do some bit and I don't even remember the bit that's how unfunny and\n\n10:53.200 --> 10:58.040\nnobody laughed and I was like I think I like dude do not stand when you're on\n\n10:58.040 --> 11:03.280\nthe hay cart keep all of your arms and hands down by your four point landing\n\n11:03.280 --> 11:09.560\nthat in other words that is your gluteus Maximus your butt your sugar shaker your\n\n11:09.560 --> 11:15.600\nflamethrower I made it funnier than he did like he went he tried to like hit\n\n11:15.600 --> 11:19.560\nlike his joke was that he was talking hip-hop or something like for a set of\n\n11:19.560 --> 11:23.040\nthe idea so everyone's just like kind of bumped out there like yes we got it like\n\n11:23.040 --> 11:26.440\nthese are those are not unimportant rules we're glad you told them to us like\n\n11:26.440 --> 11:29.840\nwe're not we're not we're not snarky I thought I was with a group of enlightened\n\n11:29.840 --> 11:35.240\npeople like like like when nobody was causing trouble nobody was he was he\n\n11:35.240 --> 11:39.360\ndressed spooky what was he dressed like a like a like a hillbilly like you know\n\n11:39.360 --> 11:42.920\nthey were all just a fight a tractor driven it's a tractor themed horror\n\n11:42.920 --> 11:48.200\nexperience it's it's I think you've all you know when you think of horror\n\n11:48.200 --> 11:53.080\nstaples you think of farm equipment like like chainsaws cut down trees who\n\n11:53.080 --> 11:55.880\nwould have thought those could be scary well everybody because they can cut\n\n11:55.880 --> 12:01.720\npeople and have but pitchforks you know who thought that well because they\n\n12:01.720 --> 12:09.920\nstab people tractor rides get in the tractor this tractor isn't haunted it's\n\n12:09.920 --> 12:16.040\njust just taking a break between its normal tractor functions while going\n\n12:16.040 --> 12:21.680\nthrough a haunted area that's like there's a tractor pulling me it's like\n\n12:21.680 --> 12:25.760\neverything's nothing scary when you're being pulled by a tractor so there's\n\n12:25.760 --> 12:29.360\nnothing scary rosemary's baby what if she had been an attractor going to the\n\n12:29.360 --> 12:33.200\nmovie I was like oh you're baby special we want to I think our neighbors are\n\n12:33.200 --> 12:42.280\ncultists but we're on a tractor so who cares like Jaws oh god there's that\n\n12:42.280 --> 12:47.560\nthis isn't this isn't this wasn't sure about a boat accident who I don't know\n\n12:47.560 --> 12:52.360\nif he tries to bite us he'll probably break his teeth on the tractor we're on\n\n12:52.360 --> 12:58.120\na tractor you won't even need a bigger tractor you won't don't encourage him\n\n12:58.120 --> 13:04.280\nit's it's it's my show encourage me I've been away for a while encourage me so\n\n13:04.280 --> 13:07.440\nhere's the only thing I can't believe you brought this up I didn't even what's\n\n13:07.440 --> 13:11.400\nit's good I really remembered this and I it's like like so is me and Dino and\n\n13:11.400 --> 13:14.960\nI was like so we're like yeah yeah we understand the rules so then this guy\n\n13:14.960 --> 13:18.120\nlike so then there was like some hustle over here like there was some\n\n13:18.120 --> 13:21.920\nbusiness happening over here on the outside of the cage and he's like huh\n\n13:21.920 --> 13:29.320\nwhat oh oh okay you know Shelby Shelby Shelby Shelby because he realized and I\n\n13:29.320 --> 13:34.320\nwant you to remember that moment because he at first he was gonna do it loudly\n\n13:34.320 --> 13:39.440\nand do as many bull but but but what you'll find in this story is that is that\n\n13:39.440 --> 13:45.160\nthe matter he needed to attend to demanded some respect and privacy so he\n\n13:45.160 --> 13:53.560\nshow me show me we got we got a little handicap over here no I need I need so\n\n13:53.560 --> 13:58.960\nwe're gonna go second round as a 65 no not 67 because it's too we got we got a\n\n13:58.960 --> 14:06.960\nlittle handicap situation and I'm like I go okay look not when he wants you to\n\n14:06.960 --> 14:12.360\nlook now now that it's been all this time look and it's good well what did I\n\n14:12.360 --> 14:16.800\nsee a human being in a wheelchair who is having the scariest night of their\n\n14:16.800 --> 14:23.280\nlife now the night they feared since the moment whether it was birthed or\n\n14:23.280 --> 14:29.760\nwhatever ailed them what happened which is the dumbest people in the world\n\n14:29.760 --> 14:37.080\nswarming around them calling them a little handicap and everyone being fine\n\n14:37.080 --> 14:43.600\nwith it while they claw at chain link just struggling for a view of the little\n\n14:43.600 --> 14:52.680\nhandicap I was fucking blown away and I would you know and I did like a guy\n\n14:52.680 --> 14:56.320\nyou know I thought at that point I was like well we're certainly not in the\n\n14:56.320 --> 15:03.760\nhands of people who care about our feelings and that's scary but they are\n\n15:03.760 --> 15:10.440\nvery rule-oriented so that undercuts it you can't touch anybody no one can touch\n\n15:10.440 --> 15:17.640\nyou go to our website if you feel touched get in the get in the thing get in\n\n15:17.640 --> 15:20.440\nthe thing and then everyone's like wearing clown masks and like trying to\n\n15:20.440 --> 15:24.400\ndo these bits that are based on like a different world where probably it\n\n15:24.400 --> 15:28.600\ndidn't have to be said constantly that no one could touch you it's like and\n\n15:28.600 --> 15:33.800\nprobably there was like I feel like over the years as epidemics of violence in\n\n15:33.800 --> 15:37.520\nour country like increased and the committees that run this thing changed\n\n15:37.520 --> 15:42.120\naround I feel like I imagine that an explanation of what I experienced that\n\n15:42.120 --> 15:46.760\nnight that the lights gradually got brighter and that the actors gradually\n\n15:46.760 --> 15:50.760\ngot more and more scolded for certain terms of phrase and it just results and\n\n15:50.760 --> 15:55.680\njust these people just like that are that are just as dumb as someone who might\n\n15:55.680 --> 16:04.360\nbe able to scare you real good like nothing scarier than a dumb fuck with\n\n16:04.360 --> 16:08.960\nyour money and suspenders like fucking hanging out like in Charlie have you\n\n16:08.960 --> 16:14.040\never been to a carnival ever in the last 38 years that's terrifying the last thing\n\n16:14.040 --> 16:18.800\nyou see is like hold tight keep your shoes and he pulls his lever and you're\n\n16:18.800 --> 16:22.520\nlike hearing these bolts that you know he doesn't understand just creak and\n\n16:22.520 --> 16:26.200\nstrain and you're just remembering all of these articles and you're like\n\n16:26.200 --> 16:30.000\ntrying to figure out if they're apocryphal what are the rates where am I on\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:34.320\nthis chart why why why is there a rope across my belly I've been on

the here is that here is the weirdest thing like I\n\n26:10.520 --> 26:14.760\nhad so many questions like they because they never there's no I mean and I'm\n\n26:14.760 --> 26:18.280\nnot being a snob because they would just take you through scary stuff it was\n\n26:18.280 --> 26:22.160\njust sort of like you'd sometimes you'd stop and they'd be like they'd put on a\n\n26:22.160 --> 26:25.800\nlittle show I was like well who's gonna complain about this this is not a\n\n26:25.800 --> 26:29.000\nproblem but then it was like for the most part it's just people wandering up\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:31.720\nand they just keep you know and you just keep remembering they're not allowed to\n\n26:31.720 --> 26:36.520\ntouch you you should not touch them so it's sort of like it really like takes\n\n26:36.520 --> 26:41.120\nthe fear out of like the 90th guy coming up just putting his head next\n\n26:41.120 --> 26:46.760\nyears and going and I'm like but now I'm my anxiety I'm like ah but it's fake\n\n26:46.760 --> 26:51.960\nI'm faking it because it's like when you tip at a strip strip bar you know I'm\n\n26:51.960 --> 26:58.080\nlike I don't know last one was a redhead but that's on me like I don't know I\n\n26:58.080 --> 27:01.800\ndon't want to take it out on you like I don't know what my job is anymore what\n\n27:01.800 --> 27:10.240\nis currency a strip bar strip bar hey Ryan my wrongs am I wrong so so it's so\n\n27:10.240 --> 27:14.400\nthe way so it's all magical like there are goblins and there were people but\n\n27:14.400 --> 27:18.960\nthe lighting was bad but in the wrong ways so like what was that word it was\n\n27:18.960 --> 27:23.160\njust well it was like they weren't lit so I couldn't like see their faces but\n\n27:23.160 --> 27:26.200\neverything was lit for everyone's safety like everything was lit so that the\n\n27:26.200 --> 27:30.320\ndriver could see the road and so that no one could sue them forever not seeing\n\n27:30.320 --> 27:34.120\nsomething but it wasn't lit there were no key lights you know and there were\n\n27:34.120 --> 27:38.120\nthere was no blocking so all you were ever seeing was just like shiny mess like\n\n27:38.120 --> 27:42.560\nwhen you took the old Universal Studios tour ride you would go into a thing and\n\n27:42.560 --> 27:46.040\nit would stop and you would stop you in front of a place and they would tell you\n\n27:46.040 --> 27:49.360\nabout the history of the thing and then the flood would happen like that's the\n\n27:49.360 --> 27:54.080\nworst that is the worst tour and I've been on it four times and the last time\n\n27:54.080 --> 27:59.240\nI went on it it was I was doing a gig up at a private party and the only way to\n\n27:59.240 --> 28:07.360\nget to it was I had to go through the tour for the fourth time and it's horrible\n\n28:07.360 --> 28:12.120\nthe poor is horrible the Jaws shark the Fire Marshal allows that that there's\n\n28:12.120 --> 28:18.560\nonly one point of no they that was so you're you're waiting into the party if\n\n28:18.560 --> 28:22.280\nyou have to leave everyone gets to just go around the ride I don't I don't know\n\n28:22.280 --> 28:31.920\nI didn't realize you I felt I didn't see any way around the worst part the worst\n\n28:31.920 --> 28:35.240\npart is the Moses part where they part the sea but they don't part the sea the\n\n28:35.240 --> 28:39.120\nsea just sinks into a thing oh I don't even want to get it I only want to get\n\n28:39.120 --> 28:46.280\ninto the how it ruins the illusion of all

this I didn't I required nothing you guys think\n\n33:52.400 --> 33:57.600\noh Dan humble brag like or whatever you're like oh you went on a haunted hey\n\n33:57.600 --> 34:01.680\nright and it had third act problems you're trying to flaunt like oh you're\n\n34:01.680 --> 34:05.680\na craftsman you're trying to brand yourself like well when I see a dog\n\n34:05.680 --> 34:10.920\nshit in a carpet I just see poop on a carpet but you see who network by\n\n34:10.920 --> 34:14.440\nPatty Chayevsky because you're so interesting that's not that's not the\n\n34:14.440 --> 34:18.740\nthat's not what I'm trying to create I'm saying like I was exactly what they\n\n34:18.740 --> 34:26.400\nwere thinking I only I only wanted to just as one of you just wanted to be in\n\n34:26.400 --> 34:31.320\na hay cart and be haunted that's all that was all I was looking for I had no\n\n34:31.320 --> 34:38.840\nother requirements however the way they haunted me for as long as they did and\n\n34:38.840 --> 34:43.080\ncontinues to haunt you well the thing that continues to haunt me was the\n\n34:43.080 --> 34:48.720\ntotal disruption in tonality that was like because right in the middle of the\n\n34:48.720 --> 34:54.680\nwhole thing yeah so the whole thing is just like bat people goblin people bucket\n\n34:54.680 --> 35:01.240\npeople tree people do chain people Viking people it's just random it's just\n\n35:01.240 --> 35:05.760\nlike I think what they must do is they like must sublet each ten feet of the\n\n35:05.760 --> 35:10.880\npark to like some bad improv troop I think I got I felt like just or just like\n\n35:10.880 --> 35:14.840\na committee they just go like okay Gary and his guys they they said they'd come\n\n35:14.840 --> 35:19.280\nback but they really want to do the Vikings again oh how many times do I have\n\n35:19.280 --> 35:25.480\nto tell them Vikings haven't been scary since 1203 even the Minnesota Vikings\n\n35:25.480 --> 35:38.800\nam I right go Packers just late gay right who's that deflate game not not\n\n35:38.800 --> 35:49.800\nsoon or late enough so in the middle of it after all anyone's done is gone so\n\n35:49.800 --> 35:54.840\nthen you pull also you start hearing like 60s Motown music and you're like\n\n35:54.840 --> 36:00.440\nwhere's this going how how racist is this gonna get because I just went\n\n36:00.440 --> 36:05.600\nthrough the witch doctor's segment by the way right and I and I and I and I'm\n\n36:05.600 --> 36:12.360\na I'm a white liberal and I won't write a letter but I'm holding on to it but it\n\n36:12.360 --> 36:17.520\nbut but but but but but they seemed fine with it and by they you know who I\n\n36:17.520 --> 36:24.760\nmean the goblins the goblins and I subscribe to the social philosophy that\n\n36:24.760 --> 36:29.240\nif it's fine with them it is fine with me but believe me it's still down there\n\n36:29.240 --> 36:33.080\nI'm thinking about it what was the Motown song I don't remember it was like\n\n36:33.080 --> 36:39.280\ndon't mess with I want to kiss your lips cuz my sugar baby loves to kiss your\n\n36:39.280 --> 36:44.360\nlips I don't think I don't think either one of those is Motown who's with me\n\n36:44.360 --> 36:54.160\nwho's with me on this I the Archies is not Motown and then and then what comes\n\n36:54.160 --> 36:58.640\ninto view is like a cross-section of cornfield and then like this like this\n\n36:58.640 --> 37:04.320\nlike vintage 60s car I'm like okay I guess this is here it doesn't fit with\n\n37:04.320 --> 37:08.480\nanything and then like two kids came out dressed in like like back to the future\n\n37:08.480 --> 37:12.920\nto like kind of like 50s attire like they're like sweaters and the pony tails\n\n37:12.920 --> 37:18.480\nand I didn't get turned on but it was like I didn't and I didn't say that I\n\n37:18.480 --> 37:24.800\ndidn't because I did I like who reacts to getting turned on that way it's not\n\n37:24.800 --> 37:30.000\npart of the story that move that movie made me so horny am I right back to the\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:33.680\nfuture so the two kids and then they go and then they're like performing but\n\n37:33.680 --> 37:36.560\nby the way everyone that's performing like half of the audience is going like\n\n37:36.560 --> 37:41.160\nthis and every time I do that my neck is behind my leg and people are going are\n\n37:41.160 --> 37:46.400\nyou okay so I'm trying to strain so it's two actors that go these are the first\n\n37:46.400 --> 37:51.040\npeople that have spoken any language except for like rattling cans and going\n\n37:51.040 --> 37:56.360\nare and we're shooting chains into nothing for the whole time so now all\n\n37:56.360 --> 38:00.000\nof a sudden it's halfway through the thing and there's just like two actors\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:03.880\ncome out and they go like stop it you know what are you doing yeah what are\n\n38:03.880 --> 38:10.920\nyou doing hey whoa it's my heart baby oh come on hey whoa what's that and they\n\n38:10.920 --> 38:15.240\nlook and so we all look and there's like some like kind of awkwardly lit thing\n\n38:15.240 --> 38:18.320\nthat like I kept going like well if that's gonna be a guy that kills you I\n\n38:18.320 --> 38:22.200\nwant to watch that because when I'm really that's not gonna move is it it's\n\n38:22.200 --> 38:27.320\ngonna stay there so like that's gonna be interesting so I was looking at that\n\n38:27.320 --> 38:30.360\nbut then what happened is they got in the car because they were scared of that\n\n38:30.360 --> 38:36.080\nwhich turns out they that there was gunshots from the car so this is like\n\n38:36.080 --> 38:39.400\nnot that kind of like show so far it was like I think there's just the most\n\n38:39.400 --> 38:43.120\nexpensive things that they had to keep it even though there's been you know so\n\n38:43.120 --> 38:46.280\nmuch because I talked to other people are like that right so scary it's like\n\n38:46.280 --> 38:49.400\nhad this whole theme of serial killers last time because this was clearly just\n\n38:49.400 --> 38:56.640\na fucking just cold-blooded recreation of the fucking zodiac killings like it\n\n38:56.640 --> 39:00.800\nwas just they got into the car and then there was like strobe lights and gun\n\n39:00.800 --> 39:05.840\nshots from inside the car so we've been like being like like like delightfully\n\n39:05.840 --> 39:11.720\nharangued by goblins that cannot touch you and then there's this play and it\n\n39:11.720 --> 39:16.440\nculminates in just like bang bang bang bang and then again and then the weirder\n\n39:16.440 --> 39:22.680\npart is how dumb it is because the guy a guy gets out in a ski mask holding an\n\n39:22.680 --> 39:30.040\naxe even though he's I guess I guess he doesn't he's not confident in his\n\n39:30.040 --> 39:34.520\nmarksmanship or he's like or he or he just ran out of bullets but he's like\n\n39:34.520 --> 39:38.360\nhe's like now holding an axe so he climbs out and he goes maybe he maybe he\n\n39:38.360 --> 39:48.200\nkilled a gun with his axe well then the other actors come on go we're fine there\n\n39:48.200 --> 39:53.400\nwas an axe in the backseat this gentleman was skiing he he he he hates his\n\n39:53.400 --> 39:58.760\nsecond amendment so but he comes out and he walks along the hay cart but the\n\n39:58.760 --> 40:04.000\nweird thing is everyone else has been a goblin a troll you can't take your\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:14.800\ndirector's hat off I'm a writer the lighting is wrong it's just structural\n\n40:14.800 --> 40:19.120\nit's just because he said he goes like oh hey it's supposed to be funny and\n\n40:19.120 --> 40:22.080\nbone-chilling now this was Thursday night all these people are phoning it in\n\n40:22.080 --> 40:27.200\nbut he was like like my nobody's bones were close to chilled like like they\n\n40:27.200 --> 40:30.640\nwere everyone's how much were room temperatures how many spines were\n\n40:30.640 --> 40:34.800\ntingled no none none no tingling like I like like there was a couple aches and\n\n40:34.800 --> 40:42.560\nbakes ooh you'll have aches and bakes you have to you have to come baked you\n\n40:42.560 --> 40:45.160\ncan save a lot of money just staying home watching like a Jonestown\n\n40:45.160 --> 40:48.480\ndocumentary something like that so then he just keeps going I swear to God I'm\n\n40:48.480 --> 40:51.440\ndone talking about the fucking hayride but he goes like he follows the hayride\n\n40:51.440 --> 40:54.640\nfor a while and I cannot stress to you enough no one has spoken to us the\n\n40:54.640 --> 40:58.520\nentire time and it's not the end and it's not the beginning this is just the\n\n40:58.520 --> 41:02.000\nmiddle and it will never be addressed again structurally it's just like it's\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:06.480\njust this fucking insane temporal shift we're like we were at a witch's house\n\n41:06.480 --> 41:10.160\nwe were in gumdrop land we were in fucking Pink Floyd's the wall now we're\n\n41:10.160 --> 41:15.760\njust in the fucking 60s and an actual historical murder\n\n41:16.760 --> 41:21.400\nsome people aren't could possibly be relatives of some victims that's not my\n\n41:21.400 --> 41:26.200\npoint I'm just saying it's totally different it's totally different if the\n\n41:26.200 --> 41:29.560\nwhole hayride was like oh I know that house that's John Wayne Gacy's house\n\n41:29.560 --> 41:32.920\nlook in the crawl space there's a strobe light a kid's trying to get out whoa\n\n41:32.920 --> 41:38.440\nthat's fucked up that really happened yo let's go eat pizza like but it was\n\n41:38.440 --> 41:42.280\nnothing like that it was like paper mache lollipop people going like\n\n41:42.280 --> 41:47.760\nhabada habada habada and then all of a sudden he's like hey Dwayne I don't know\n\n41:47.760 --> 41:51.680\nif we should be out when should we tell my parents I'm pregnant hey don't worry\n\n41:51.680 --> 41:55.160\nabout your baby I'll take great care of it we'll love it forever oh my god he's\n\n41:55.160 --> 41:59.000\ngonna go please don't I want to die I want to fucking die oh my god this happened\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:05.840\n45 times this year and the guy comes out it does this like bad fucking improv\n\n42:05.840 --> 42:11.200\nperformance with a ski mask and a hatchet going like oh hey hey you guys and\n\n42:11.200 --> 42:16.840\nhe's decided all serial killers are from New Jersey oh hey hey you didn't happen\n\n42:16.840 --> 42:24.080\nto see anything back there did you and everyone no one says anything because\n\n42:24.080 --> 42:28.440\nyou can't that's called social engineering Dan oh you didn't you don't\n\n42:28.440 --> 42:31.960\nhave to see anything did you and I think because it says it in his script like\n\n42:31.960 --> 42:35.600\neven though everyone's just going like this he keeps like singling out people\n\n42:35.600 --> 42:40.760\ngo yeah what about you man did you look like you saw something and she's like\n\n42:40.760 --> 42:48.960\nno I didn't like she's what what do you what do you think happens or something\n\n42:48.960 --> 42:55.560\nI saw it was fucking you put put the ax down I mean obviously that character knew\n\n42:55.560 --> 43:00.080\nwe saw something he just shot you people and he was speaking very honestly what\n\n43:00.080 --> 43:03.840\ndo you think happens if you say you did it we just watch you well here's some\n\n43:03.840 --> 43:09.080\nthings on the list of that won't happen because that's easier he won't touch you\n\n43:09.080 --> 43:15.120\nand you won't stand up you won't touch the wire above your head the tractor\n\n43:15.120 --> 43:18.640\nwill keep going and I mean what do you think the whole that's so confusing it's\n\n43:18.640 --> 43:21.560\nlike why didn't they personalize it for that one moment because I was like\n\n43:21.560 --> 43:26.360\nlisten as unattractive as this idea is like the truth is if we were truly in a\n\n43:26.360 --> 43:30.120\nrealm where we've seen all the shit that we've seen tonight this guy is the\n\n43:30.120 --> 43:38.120\nclosest ally we have he has a gun like we're obviously traveling through\n\n43:38.120 --> 43:44.000\ndimensions we don't know his story maybe we're gonna fight maybe we judge him and\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:47.760\nwe find out oh those two people killed his parents or something in the 60s\n\n43:47.760 --> 43:51.480\nbut I don't we don't know maybe he was framed the whole thing happened to the\n\n43:51.480 --> 43:57.240\ndark with strobe like I was like it wasn't scary as my point right it wasn't\n\n43:57.240 --> 44:05.720\nscary I'm 42 I want to go on a children's ride and dare me more I also have\n\n44:05.720 --> 44:11.760\ncomplaints about spider-man 9 I'm 49 years old I deserve better in my\n\n44:11.760 --> 44:17.680\nspider-man movie all right I just heard myself it took me 50\n\n44:17.680 --> 44:25.720\nminutes but I'm ready to go up I think a valuable lesson don't applaud me saying\n\n44:25.720 --> 44:30.840\nI'm a good hayride and that's one to grow on a beginning a middle on an end\n\n44:30.840 --> 44:35.680\nthat's the problem with that was all over the map now I went to not not scary\n\n44:35.680 --> 44:39.760\nfirm which we talked about no don't bring it up I grew up in Southern\n\n44:39.760 --> 44:44.520\nCalifornia there's not very firm and in Halloween there is not scary for I love\n\n44:44.520 --> 44:50.440\npuns in any format but even when they completely undercut the yes desired\n\n44:50.440 --> 44:56.560\nmessage not scary but actually that that's I actually only when Dino and Dan\n\n44:56.560 --> 44:59.800\npointed out I never thought of it being not scary for him I never thought that's\n\n44:59.800 --> 45:05.720\nliterally what like phonetically that's what it is I grew I grew up at not\n\n45:05.720 --> 45:11.040\nvery far the out of the word scary I didn't and you just they had the word\n\n45:11.040 --> 45:20.240\nscary for Halloween right yeah it's not all year round but not scary farm in\n\n45:20.240 --> 45:25.760\nJune I don't know what I say I retract that I retract that what if they what\n\n45:25.760 --> 45:28.600\nif they found that out there like gentlemen the not scary brand is\n\n45:28.600 --> 45:33.320\nactually catching like wildfire in a way that not berries never did people like\n\n45:33.320 --> 45:38.120\nnot scary things right they don't like they don't like jelly we found out what\n\n45:38.120 --> 45:43.840\nmy pitch was that they should call it for Halloween not N.O.T. not scary farm\n\n45:43.840 --> 45:49.960\ncomma not but spelled K.N.O.T.T. a positive yes there's layers there that you\n\n45:49.960 --> 45:59.600\nguys will have to Google there's a movie not scary not scary not not so when I\n\n45:59.600 --> 46:03.560\nwent to not scary farm there would be there would be fistfights all the time\n\n46:03.560 --> 46:06.960\nbecause they were absolutely allowed to touch you the people that played the\n\n46:06.960 --> 46:11.240\nthe ghouls and the boogins there they would just jump out of a they would\n\n46:11.240 --> 46:15.440\nthey would just who they were who were they who there was there was boogins and\n\n46:15.440 --> 46:20.080\ngoogas oh they were really it was authentic then he's just getting shit for\n\n46:20.080 --> 46:24.920\nspecial special Guga boogins is a real love mythical character I think people\n\n46:24.920 --> 46:32.520\nsay boogins boogins yeah I call them the boogins look boogins it's like Dan\n\n46:32.520 --> 46:37.960\nit with bagel I he only read it so when we went there they would jump out and\n\n46:37.960 --> 46:41.800\ngrab you from behind and scare the ever-loving shit out of you which isn't\n\n46:41.800 --> 46:49.600\nreally being like scared as it's being startled exactly Millennials so I was\n\n46:49.600 --> 46:52.680\ngoing through a haunted house with Diana Madawassian is I think we're\n\n46:52.680 --> 46:55.800\nsophomores in high school

still she knows yeah and I was she knows what she's doing I was I was a\n\n47:12.480 --> 47:15.880\nlate bloomer but I was so afraid of girls I was so afraid so I had it by the\n\n47:15.880 --> 47:20.160\nhand we're going through it like when this little tunnel driven haunted houses\n\n47:20.160 --> 47:23.560\nthings where people just jump out at you and stuff and you know I'm gonna walk\n\n47:23.560 --> 47:26.520\nthrough that little corridor there and it's gonna be a bunch of boogins jumping\n\n47:26.520 --> 47:32.760\nout at me so I have her by the hand I'm leading her down the hallway and I'm\n\n47:32.760 --> 47:36.520\npulling her she's too afraid there's boogins jumping out at her I'm like\n\n47:36.520 --> 47:40.480\nDiana come on just run just come like this look

do it hurt at all by the way she moved my tooth up into my brain but\n\n48:12.480 --> 48:22.920\nhey that's our racist stereotype our Armenian skulls are just as soft as not\n\n48:22.920 --> 48:26.920\nin my experience Dan not in my experience well you've met a weird woman not\n\n48:26.920 --> 48:36.400\nan Armenian spokesmodel I apologies to my friends Rick Rick Rick

period if you could cast\n\n01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:33.840\nyourself as any character Andy in World War two allies access it could be a\n\n01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:39.800\nRussian peasant it could be an officer you could be anybody go back in history\n\n01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:43.720\nportrayers who would you like to portray back and well I first I can say\n\n01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:47.320\nthat I used to have a joke where I said that my career is going so poorly you\n\n01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:51.160\nknow I my career is going so badly I would have played the Jew in Nazi\n\n01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:55.640\npropaganda films you know it's like someone has someone has to do it someone's\n\n01:02:55.640 --> 01:03:04.440\ngonna do it they're gonna cast somebody and then the other the other thing I\n\n01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:09.000\nhad a joke I was like there's no small rule the other thing I looked scared\n\n01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:15.080\nalready there was that movie downfall which is a great movie downfall is one\n\n01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:19.640\nof the best of all time it's Hitler in the bunker based on his secretary one\n\n01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:24.080\nthat the clips from that everyone uses as the means yes yes yes and based on\n\n01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:29.560\nthe documentary with his secretary yes Hitler had a secretary yeah so I just\n\n01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:34.080\nmay watch all worlds at war that she's awesome the secretary so my thing was\n\n01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:37.760\nthat I would have liked to have punched up that script downfall because I would\n\n01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:41.800\nhave one scene where I walk in I go I just got back from Hitler's bunker has\n\n01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:54.440\nhe been acting strange but I probably would have played I probably would have\n\n01:03:54.440 --> 01:04:02.120\nplayed who would I have played maybe Mussolini that would be the best B\n\n01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:07.000\nstory to a world war two movie ever that's like stars Hitler or like stars\n\n01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.960\npatent or something but it's like the cut to Hitler and he's like well I'm so\n\n01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:17.080\nmad but then it's like what's Mussolini doing and it's you don't say I don't like\n\n01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:23.040\nit yeah you know what why don't you just hang me in the public square\n\n01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:30.800\nfrom my memory of a high school World War two the history it's like sort of\n\n01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:36.000\nlike like Italy was sort of Italy was it only ended up on their hat and a ring\n\n01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.240\nthey ended up on the ally side towards the end of the war I found out he was a\n\n01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:44.280\nwindsock he went whatever yeah it was just sort of like and you see the\n\n01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:48.800\nfootage of him not that Hitler looks any less ridiculous but like like like like\n\n01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.640\nlike the guy who was thinking there's other always that footage where he got\n\n01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:58.320\nhe talks like this it's like the iron chic looked more natural like it's so\n\n01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:01.560\nweird like like like because people were like they're actually they didn't have\n\n01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:04.800\ncameras on them ever so they were like yeah I'm gonna do this because I saw a\n\n01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:08.600\nguy do this in a movie awesome footage when when Mussolini bones out of Italy\n\n01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:13.800\nbecause he's just completely like left like surrenders and he goes to Nazi\n\n01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:17.920\nGermany and he gets off a plane and Hitler sees Mussolini who's lost so\n\n01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:21.760\nmuch weight because you think it was this big hail robust you know like your\n\n01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:27.760\nburner with a workout plan kind of thing and and Hitler sees him it's like you\n\n01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:31.560\ncan see like wow you've you don't look so good Mussolini and I'm Hitler Hitler\n\n01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:37.040\nsaying that to him look at me look like the Pringles Spencer how would you

01:11:58.960\nknow what I'm doing and it was like I'm doing and then you secretly tell one guy\n\n01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:03.040\nlike right underneath you go like don't ever tell me anything like like like\n\n01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:07.360\nlike but like just let me go let me do my thing and then and then you just\n\n01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:13.200\nrun the whole war so George W. Bush and Cheney yeah he won right he fucking\n\n01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:19.480\nlike yeah yeah yeah yeah I think it's like if you were a strategist what you\n\n01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:24.280\nwould do is you would go like oh don't tell me anything and then let me fucking\n\n01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:29.600\nlike stand on balconies and because if I slip up it'll be the fucking greatest\n\n01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:34.760\nstrategy since D-Day like it'll be like like cuz I'll just be like I know what\n\n01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:38.240\nI'm doing and like like like and then there's just a guy just running a war\n\n01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:43.920\nunderneath you I don't know if that would work sounds like you someone would\n\n01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:49.880\nsee through it at some point why is there a guy underneath the podium he\n\n01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:54.720\ndoesn't have to be that's you're thinking of police academy that's the answer\n\n01:12:54.720 --> 01:13:03.560\nis because I'm a horny was that you that sucked my dick you guys have to watch\n\n01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:10.000\npolice academy through this like post boat trip post post Caitlyn Jenner\n\n01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.480\npost fucking like 2015 world like just watch a movie called police academy\n\n01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:20.280\nwhere it's just like the one of the runners of the big like yeah and it's\n\n01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:25.280\njust like the joke is that the the head of all the police\n\n01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:33.320\ncomment down thinks that Steve Gutenberg filleted him right and so he and he's\n\n01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:40.680\nand he's just like like he's just he's apparently not gay but thinks Steve\n\n01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:44.760\nGutenberg is and it's not the joke isn't that the common down is like in the\n\n01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:51.440\ncloset the joke isn't the common down is like yeah I'm so straight that I I don't\n\n01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:55.920\nwant that blowjob to get to me but it felt so good right like it's just a\n\n01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:01.160\nweird we were we were so in the closet back then that we were healthier a\n\n01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:05.960\nlittle bit a lot of ways because we put people in the center square and we like\n\n01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:12.120\ncelebrated like you mean actuality you know we celebrated gayness like in a way\n\n01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:16.480\nthat we couldn't after we actually acknowledged that it was offensive to\n\n01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:20.280\ndehumanize people like I it's I think that goes with everything really it's\n\n01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:24.240\nlike you're sort of like there's that day when you graduate to being taken\n\n01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:28.240\nseriously and everything stops being celebratory but you're right though in\n\n01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:32.280\na way because the fact that you can't really have someone like Paul Lynn\n\n01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:35.760\nthere's a character in a way because you know you'd be stereotypical yeah but\n\n01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:39.080\nthe fact that yeah we didn't know like nobody knew what was going on back right\n\n01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:44.960\nand so in half the people like yeah I mean I was one of them like like the\n\n01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:50.280\nbiggest bands were Queen and the village people right I don't care if you've ever\n\n01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:55.480\nheard of them listen to those names their gimmick was not to anyone in the\n\n01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:59.760\nin Wisconsin there there was it was not known that the gimmick had anything to\n\n01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:04.320\ndo right any form of lifestyle they're all look at the fireman look at the no\n\n01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:07.720\nyeah look at they wear different outfits and they're singing about the YMCA I\n\n01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:11.920\ndon't know why and then now it's the Navy they're following it with I don't\n\n01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:17.080\nknow they're like any other group they sing about weird things those guys have\n\n01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:23.200\na lot of energy and Queen Freddie Mercury was like a fucking belt in that\n\n01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:27.080\nhouse like like every America was like yay these people are great every\n\n01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:30.320\nthroughout history I've ever seen that documentary the cellulite closet you\n\n01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:34.480\nvery seen that I am interested to see that because I'm 30 years later but but\n\n01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:39.120\nlike the idea that like like like yeah obviously like there's a not to be\n\n01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:44.280\nstereotypical but there's a lot of talent like like sequestered in the in the\n\n01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:52.680\nin the gate like like you are like a prosecuting attorney it's about the\n\n01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:58.680\npower is now it's 2015 so it's not progressive to say it anymore like five\n\n01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:02.360\nyears ago I was like I love gay people they're so talented now it's like you\n\n01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:07.640\nweird homophobic weird yeah yeah they're not anything that was my closer was\n\n01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:14.720\nlet's hear it for the gate but but all of that mid 80s late 80s like all this\n\n01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:19.840\ngiant pool of talent like like so many of them died and so like you didn't just\n\n01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:24.840\nlose artists and like you know singers and like like like visual artists like\n\n01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:29.200\nyou lost you know architects and great minds writers politicians like like a\n\n01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:34.800\nhuge swath of an incredibly intelligent hip happening like section of our\n\n01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:38.760\npopulation gone and I don't know that we totally recovered from that like I\n\n01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:43.520\nthink that's a huge like one of the reasons that way we kind of went into a\n\n01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:50.520\nlittle bit of a cultural downslide is you had the comedy boom of the late 80s\n\n01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:56.200\nthere was some quality left there were two great gigs back in the 80s you could\n\n01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:01.180\nbe extended comic or a guy that made brick walls behind comics oh my god the\n\n01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:07.480\nbrick laying boom winner they're gonna a piece of that brick that brick\n\n01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:12.320\nconcession boy oh boy or if you sold nacho materials back then you can make\n\n01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:18.560\nmoney that's what the big if you if you sold giant mallets yeah you know I\n\n01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:24.640\nused to I still call Gallagher in June and ask him what melons look good\n\n01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:29.560\nshould I go for

01:22:56.720\nGilbert Gottfried used to do a thing when I was when I was like when I was\n\n01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:03.640\nlike 15 years old humble brag the watching like I remember watching a\n\n01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:06.840\nGilbert Gottfried special and I was like oh that's that guy that talks like this\n\n01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:11.680\nand he's in the candy bar commercials like I think he was on SNL one year and\n\n01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:16.200\nI don't know anything about him and I watched his 45 minutes set and it was\n\n01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:21.000\nlike holy shit this guy's a goddamn genius because he would cut he would come\n\n01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:26.280\nout and he does the comedy and do the act and it doesn't really matter the\n\n01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:31.880\nperformance style but I do it like this and I do it like that and then but then\n\n01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:36.040\nhe would pause and then there would be a pause and then he'd go\n\n01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:40.640\nno why would you do something like that you know later would turn out I didn't\n\n01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:44.440\nknow he was doing his impression I think of Seinfeld yeah I used to do a he was\n\n01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:51.200\ndoing super ego it's Seinfeld it's perfect but I didn't even know it was\n\n01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:55.400\njust funny that he was just doing like a dialogue he was doing his act and I do\n\n01:23:55.400 --> 01:24:00.880\nthe joke and I do the set up and then the punchline pause now that's not\n\n01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:06.440\nsomething you want to do why do you have to screech at people that sounds like\n\n01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:10.320\nGroucho a little bit well I'm not I'm not doing I'm not even going to attempt\n\n01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:15.520\nlike Gilbert Godfrey Seinfeld impression well he had that one joke where he\n\n01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:20.480\nsays uh he goes uh thank you the Martian ship

too\n\n01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:23.440\nexpensive to make it drinkable if you put half the money you put it to NASCAR\n\n01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:31.920\nget her done I'm in a joke today I was a random joke I don't know why where I\n\n01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:35.360\nwas in this area I have no idea because I'm a hack and I'm old and whatever but\n\n01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:38.600\nas I was like I don't know I was thinking about Jeff Foxworthy and it was\n\n01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:45.240\nlike who doesn't I wrote a tweet and it just said like I'm probably gonna\n\n01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:48.760\nbutcher my own funny tweet but it was just like the joke was just it was\n\n01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:59.080\nquote life life isn't given to people Amanda life as a test and I'm giving it\n\n01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:07.600\ndash Fox leak dialogue from the trailer for Foxworthy by Aaron Sorkin because\n\n01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:14.680\nhe's famous for giving a redneck test that okay so wait that Aaron Sorkin\n\n01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:19.000\nisn't famous no no Jeff Foxworthy is the inventor of walking and talking Foxworthy\n\n01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.520\nand all caps so then I got so many tweets and there's a people like there's\n\n01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:27.480\nlike one guy in particular it was like like Fox what Foxworthy is that about\n\n01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:34.600\nJeff Foxworthy scratch that off my list and I know I'm 42 but I'm like like\n\n01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:40.240\nwhat what do you mean what did he mean and he's like he kind of stooped a\n\n01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:44.360\nlittle bit albeit respectfully like because he's he's not he's not being\n\n01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:49.240\ncondescending but he understands that I didn't get his joke and he goes like the\n\n01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:54.080\npremise of the joke as I is that I mistook the title for being about Jeff\n\n01:26:54.080 --> 01:27:00.800\nFoxworthy and so I was no longer a lot oh enthusiastic about seeing the movie\n\n01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:06.520\nand so I said oh oh I get it now but you're still gonna go see the movie\n\n01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:13.520\nright and he goes well now that yes to further bury the shame of my bad\n\n01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:19.680\nattempted humor yes I will go see it and I said well hold on a second oh if they\n\n01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:24.920\nmake a you know if there's a movie called Foxworthy they're gonna have to\n\n01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:29.680\nexpect you to make the association with the guy that you thought of immediately\n\n01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:37.320\nso it wasn't a lame joke you know world where that movie exists and he's like\n\n01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:42.720\nokay yeah you're right I guess I just like the idea of seeing those red necks\n\n01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:50.400\nwalking out of the movie theater puzzled and I said yeah dumbasses yeah\n\n01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:59.880\nsaid they talk about failing a test like the famous test that Jeff Foxworthy\n\n01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:04.480\nwhat's he doing what happened to the test there at the end and what's the\n\n01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:08.520\nfamous test and he dance like he's not here dancing a very weird place right\n\n01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:15.920\nbut yeah okay I don't think people would consider it a test you're you're\n\n01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:21.560\nsaying you know you're a red red redneck when right yeah Dan sees that as Jeff\n\n01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:27.640\nFoxworthy issuing a test on you oh now hold on a second all right if you can\n\n01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:32.040\nfollow answer the following questions and you just might be a redneck that's\n\n01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:39.000\nexactly literally his bit that's why his set wasn't called pollock jokes or like\n\n01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:44.040\nhe literally only just did that you might be a redneck if yes he instead of\n\n01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:48.080\nsaying how can you tell when a redneck screws in a light bulb he said you might\n\n01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:54.160\nbe a redneck if boy okay all right bad guy will you ruin the originality of his\n\n01:28:54.160 --> 01:29:00.480\nconcept with that now I realize it's it seems like a similar like a familiar saw\n\n01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:05.720\nwell there's some poor kid out there now it's looking for that movie and and he's\n\n01:29:05.720 -->

switcher was he liberal when when well\n\n01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:03.120\nhere's the true I think the truth is is that he used to what Kevin Rooney was a\n\n01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:06.200\nguy used to work on his show and I think Kevin Rooney was very politically\n\n01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:09.360\naware but I don't think Dennis Miller was ever that politically aware but he was\n\n01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:14.760\nfunny black and white movie liberal guy right like I thought but I think he was\n\n01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:18.400\na faux liberal I think he was always he was a people pleaser which that's good\n\n01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:23.120\nenough for me that's that's you're done as a liberal like like just be a people\n\n01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:27.920\npleaser well I thought he was always unpleasant no no but I mean he was trying\n\n01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:31.600\nthat was all I'm saying like if that's your goal then you're fine because I\n\n01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:36.480\nwill lead you to all the right votes and all the right behaviors like like right\n\n01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:40.400\notherwise it's you're going like well I gotta protect me and mine are like okay\n\n01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:43.340\nwell now you're getting into yeah it was up is I mean just unbelievable this guy\n\n01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:48.560\nwas rich filthy rich lives up in Santa Barbara and he's still miserable since\n\n01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:56.240\n9-11 miserable like it was miserable and then use that as a like I'm using\n\n01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:59.840\ndivorce I'm just like I'm getting divorced like come on you were already a\n\n01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:07.600\npiece of shit these colors don't run and you were a San Francisco right oh no\n\n01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:11.200\nyou LA where did I start you mean yeah well I'm from New York but I started out\n\n01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:14.800\nin LA okay so you weren't one of the San Francisco no but I knew but I used to go\n\n01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:18.080\nup in the late 80s and early 90s and all those guys when they were living up\n\n01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:21.880\nthere David Feldman and Brian Paul saying and all those guys yeah what is that\n\n01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:26.280\nlike I hate to dwell on because I'll never Dennis Miller like the I remember a\n\n01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:29.920\nspecial mr. Miller goes to Washington do you remember that is this after the\n\n01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:33.880\nchange I don't think it was but no it's way before 9-11 is that what you mean is\n\n01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:37.680\nthere I don't remember that change yeah I don't know where the change happened\n\n01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:40.200\nthat's why I'm asking so I know it was after 9-11 because he used to have a\n\n01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:45.240\nwhat his most famous one is like a black and white is the funny one but I don't\n\n01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:48.200\neven know that would be funny if I watched it now was he like could you have a\n\n01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:51.480\nconservative slant in that I'm just so curious about that I think it was more\n\n01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:56.760\nlike he would be like he would be liberal like about gay issues and things\n\n01:46:56.760 --> 01:47:00.720\nlike that but then he would be like yeah let's fry him right so like libertarian\n\n01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:06.560\nthat's right it's like yeah hey who cares about gay people as long as I got\n\n01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:11.040\nmoney boom right but also he had great writers on the old Dennis Miller show so\n\n01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:14.400\nI think people thought that he was a politically aware guy I don't think he\n\n01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:17.920\nreally ever was I think he's a guy who knows references but doesn't really know\n\n01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:27.520\nwhat they mean necessarily but it's just like colonel Scott's he's like a how\n\n01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:35.040\nright he's that kind of encyclopedic memory for any reference oh like a boy\n\n01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:40.240\nRogers all of a sudden triggers on vacation there and I hate those people\n\n01:47:40.240 -->

funny\n\n01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:52.920\nright now who's who do you think is a kicking ass I love it don't mean you\n\n01:47:52.920 --> 01:48:00.680\nJames it don't mean there's so many great people Maria Bamford there's so\n\n01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:05.280\nmany great people I always my mind Ron Funches\n\n01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:16.200\nSheila McCrae cheers to Andy kindler for keeping a gender balance and his\n\n01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:20.440\nshout-out to young comics of the day yeah cheers to the same kindler for\n\n01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:23.280\nevoking the ghost of pirates\n\n01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:35.880\nshe will be on your box I will guard this locker with me very barnacle in soul\n\n01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:43.840\nplus this airline food is unacceptable if you could resurrect Andy like like\n\n01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:48.680\nsomebody dead like a dead comic you go see him do a set right now I would be I\n\n01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:53.360\nwould pick Lenny Bruce because that only the only thing that I've seen is and I\n\n01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:56.000\nactually enjoy it but a lot of people don't like it is the performance film\n\n01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.880\nwhich is the last yeah so I've seen things on Steve Steve Allen but like\n\n01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:04.440\nRichard Pryor we have that concert film which is still the greatest thing of all\n\n01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:08.680\ntime I think that especially made but we don't have that Lenny Bruce as much\n\n01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:12.120\nexcept on the record yeah he would love to have seen him in the club the stuff\n\n01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:15.560\nI've seen Lenny Bruce like you don't like it doesn't match up with how funny he\n\n01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:20.800\nwas to people that you know are like what they're talking about they saw him\n\n01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:24.200\nperform live like their relationship with Lenny Bruce is way different than\n\n01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:27.680\nwhat I get or the movie Lenny for example which is like nothing like Lenny\n\n01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:31.760\nBruce at all what about Bill Hicks did you you must have I got to work with it\n\n01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:36.480\nI worked I was very lucky I got to work with Bill Hicks what the week after he\n\n01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:42.840\ngot sober in 1988 three weeks in a row and he had just gotten and he was like\n\n01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:47.280\nkind of so angry and so hilarious like one night he was in Grand Rapids\n\n01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:50.960\nMichigan he goes yep next week I'll be on Letterman you people will still be\n\n01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:59.240\nhere in this shithole he got so activated is that is it have we because I saw\n\n01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:02.040\nthat documentary about him that was like largely pictures did you see that one\n\n01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:06.480\nI haven't seen that like the myth of Bill Hicks I have no I will very very readily\n\n01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:12.000\naccept that the myth is 100% and more like like accurate but I also wonder\n\n01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:15.880\ndo comics need that figure in their life of the guy that went rogue and became\n\n01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:19.640\nthe funniest guy in the world and then and that big because and then pass a\n\n01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:23.040\npathway well I don't know but it's like a lot of people see him and they go I\n\n01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:26.800\nmean I think he's one of these things like people who did see Lenny Bruce live\n\n01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:31.040\nor did see I mean Bill Hicks live was unbelievable because he was so seamless\n\n01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:34.960\nhe was so like seamless in that he was talking to the crowd the way he would\n\n01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:40.160\ntalk and so I think that that might be missed if you see his stuff on video\n\n01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:44.080\nright I don't know I mean he's got he has a lot of stuff on you know that he\n\n01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:49.920\nfilmed but and people get caught up in the the I don't know they get caught up\n\n01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:53.720\nin the fucking like well all comics tried to be like him too well that's oh\n\n01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:58.800\nyeah the worst of them all yeah all right I didn't stand up when I was\n\n01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:06.240\nwalking in the post-bill Hicks fucking ma'am right I was like like dude you're\n\n01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:13.560\nnot that mad about anything you love cheese curds so much you were so funny\n\n01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:21.680\neight minutes ago your entire club was bricks everywhere no you couldn't find\n\n01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:26.040\na door to save your life that's what that's what drove Bill Hicks out of his\n\n01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:31.640\nmind yeah you started in Milwaukee yes do you remember any of your openers\n\n01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:38.960\nyou have it Jeff why don't you go fuck yourself I have never I'm not saying do\n\n01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:43.080\nit I think do you I I'm not saying you must do one do you remember any of I know\n\n01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:49.720\nit's I don't like I'm going to say no and here's why it's 10 o'clock and I'm\n\n01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:56.200\nashamed of one thing in my life and that is my stand-up set when I was 17 yeah\n\n01:51:56.200 --> 01:52:00.920\nbut you know the lucky thing though was that we'd have cameras and like you\n\n01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:04.600\nit's like you're putting out some challenge for anyone in Milwaukee that\n\n01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:10.720\nhas there's footage oh yeah did you have an acid wash jacket no worse I had a\n\n01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:20.880\nterrible act I watch an old footage of me there used to be a couple of rascals\n\n01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:25.320\ncomedy club and they somehow I remember signing the release I could see my face\n\n01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:28.760\nas I signed it but it was like so they have all this footage of when I had first\n\n01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:32.200\nstarted and so I was scared to death but I did see a joke I like which was a\n\n01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:36.920\nworld like in 1989 I wrote the joke Jews are obsessed with Hitler because we\n\n01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:40.640\ncan't remember anything about the pharaoh\n\n01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:49.160\nlike that holds up that holds up yeah I also did a lot of horrible I find that\n\n01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:55.440\njoke too topical I absolutely promise you that it's I like but in the story of\n\n01:52:55.440 --> 01:52:58.280\nmy life is that I would go like nope you'd hate it you'd hate it you'd hate it\n\n01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:01.880\npeople like dig it up and they'd go like wait that's awful I'd be like motherfucker\n\n01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:09.880\nI I told you I buried one thing like I asked you to bury it and again I'm not\n\n01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:12.600\nsaying do it is there a joke that you're proud of you remember that you have one\n\n01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:17.600\nthat you think might still hold up no no no no okay highlights that I remember I\n\n01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:28.760\nused the C word in my act like a lot I thought at 17 the reason unsuccessful\n\n01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:35.520\ncomics didn't use it and Andrew dice clay did is because he was smart and\n\n01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:43.520\nbrave and I used the C word in a giant chunk of my bit about how I didn't like\n\n01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:58.640\nwomen at my college that were of a certain category that were doing I did a\n\n01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:02.800\nthen I would talk about jerking off for a while which is like fine we're in safe\n\n01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:08.600\nterritory like like that's fine like like like like just punish yourself but\n\n01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:13.040\nand then I but I would at the time Jeffrey Dahmer had just eaten a bunch of\n\n01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:20.440\npeople so I had a lot of Dahmer jokes talk about your link was in\n\n01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:29.840\ngo the guy was your your lips to my set list rumble none of them that funny oh\n\n01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:34.760\nyeah oh someone oh we're having someone's joule again or something and then I\n\n01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:42.960\nwould and then I would close I closed with a it wasn't a rap it was a song it\n\n01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:46.960\nwas like a I don't know what my what my premise was I don't know why it was in\n\n01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:51.520\nthe country Western theme it was a song about masturbation and I would make the\n\n01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:55.080\naudience would clap and I would sing the song it was me rhyming about\n\n01:54:55.080 -->

how bad they were at all\n\n01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:14.200\nstuff it's like it's like genuinely it's like you know have you ever been\n\n01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:19.000\ngenuinely ashamed like you're
