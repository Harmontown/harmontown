WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.180
From Hollywood, California, the nexus of entertainment and sexiness, to the Meltdown Theater and Meltdown

00:15.180 --> 00:21.000
comics and NerdMelt and MeltyMelt's Harmontown is now in session.

00:21.000 --> 00:42.000
Wow! Tonight's attendance, 72,000 people. Let's bring out the Game Master, Spencer Fritton!

00:42.000 --> 00:58.000
And just for old time's sake, let's bring out the Mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
There is a, it's a bigger, it's a bigger crowd. We're always sold out but it's a...

01:07.000 --> 01:15.000
Is it big? It sounds big. We're always sold out. But this is extra sold out.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.000
I don't think we're more sold out. I think these people are just more vigorous, more exciting.

01:21.000 --> 01:28.000
Let's not kid ourselves, Jeff. The reason they're packed to the rafters tonight is not because of you or me or Spencer.

01:28.000 --> 01:45.000
It's because last week, we pointed out there was no ice scooper. Oh, shit! And they wanted to be here for the big unveiling.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.000
Dan, kick it off and scoop me some motherfucking ice out of that thing.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
Spencer, talk to Jeff while I make Jeff a drink.

01:54.000 --> 02:01.000
Great. Hey, how's it been going, Jeff? It's pretty good. I've been traveling. I'm a little travel weary, but I'm very good.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
When'd you get back in, Jeff? I just got back in a couple days ago, but it was...

02:05.000 --> 02:28.000
They love a couple days. That was a parody of when they do that, right?

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
It's like the movie Cocktail. You're time cruising here right now.

02:32.000 --> 02:40.000
It was a parody. Thank you, Mr. Hyman.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Okay, so Spencer... Yeah, man.

02:44.000 --> 02:51.000
What did you think about... Okay, so I have to get a car, right? Spencer's been driving me around. I love it. You love it, kind of.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
I love it. No, I love it.

02:53.000 --> 03:02.000
Did you register the anxiety level at UTA when we went there last week?

03:02.000 --> 03:11.000
Spencer and I walk into a place together because he drives me and then I go and then I'll have a meeting.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
It's not a natural thing to have a chauffeur.

03:16.000 --> 03:26.000
No, I think it's the way of the land. It's not, though. It's not the way of the waiting rooms where we go into.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
So the person at the desk is always like, hello.

03:30.000 --> 03:36.000
And then Spencer, because he's like a squire, he's like an erstwhile squire.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
He drove me. He opened the doors. He knew exactly where to go.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
I was just babbling about not wanting to tie my shoes the whole time.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
And then Spencer gets to the desk and then the person goes, can I help you?

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
And Spencer goes, Dan Harmon, to see whoever...

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
Like, he announces me, which is amazing.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Well, I do that anywhere we go, though.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
But then the receptionist goes, you're Dan, and who's he?

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
And he goes, no, this is Dan Harmon. And then she goes, well, who are you?

04:06.000 --> 04:14.000
And he goes, I'm Spencer. And she's like, okay, do you guys want to go to water or Diet Coke or anything?

04:14.000 --> 04:20.000
Well, we'll take waters. And we go sit down. And then she's like, Dan and Spencer are here for the three o'clock meeting.

04:20.000 --> 04:27.000
And then you just have to let it... You're like, it would be weird at any point to stop the momentum and go like,

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
let me explain something here. That's weird and takes really long to explain.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
Well, I think that I generally try to say, oh, don't worry about me when they ask what my deal is.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Well, that's...

04:39.000 --> 04:46.000
Don't you worry. I'll just be over here six feet tall with a two foot long beard.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
I'll just be hiding over here the most interesting looking guy in the universe.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
Yeah. Don't worry about me, like, needs more context than that thing.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
It shouldn't. I mean, those people, they're all about hospitality.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
So they just want to make sure we're adequately respected, which is, you know,

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
it comes to odds because I don't need that in those situations.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
That's the last thing I need is validation from, you know, secretarial staff.

05:12.000 --> 05:19.000
Is there a validation Spencer that you do like want or crave?

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Is there something you would like to hear from staff or anything?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
From staff?

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
I mean, like from strangers.

05:25.000 --> 05:32.000
Well, I just want to just don't walk slowly, I think.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
That'd be good enough.

05:33.000 --> 05:40.000
What do you like to hear from people secretly, even if it's a little selfish and juvenile and not mentally healthy to want it?

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Like, what's something that really puts a wind in yourself?

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
Like a secret thing you wish strangers said or thought about you as you walked into a building?

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
I like things that are useful or being useful to people.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
So that my manifesto is I'll be all like, hey, man, did you know if you're gagging,

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
you can put your thumb through your hand like that BuzzFeed article said, not gag.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
And then people will be like, that helps me.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
And then I'll be like, that's good.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
But yeah, I want to, yeah, I want to.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
You want to be useful?

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
I want to increase the satisfaction of people's lives.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Wait, oh, I'm sorry.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
You wish people would say, give you life-saving tips or you wish?

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
No.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
You wish people would say, oh, I wish they'd appreciate, yeah, the utility that I offer.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Oh, that's good.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
Well, you're in a good position because you have a lot of utility.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Thank you.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
You're a healthy example of somebody who knows what they, knows their needs and gets their needs met.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
That's what my therapist would say.

06:41.000 --> 06:48.000
Dan, if you walked into an office building and like in a busy office corporate setting,

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
what would you wish, like the gatekeepers, like the security person,

06:52.000 --> 06:58.000
like the people that you have to walk past, what do you wish they thought about you on site?

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Oh.

06:59.000 --> 07:07.000
It is he.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
The chosen one.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
We better get our shit together.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Like, I mean,

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
For real.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
No, I am being for real.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
I mean, we're living in a fantasy world.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Let's make a fantasy.

07:22.000 --> 07:28.000
You go into a corporate building like Century City Plaza,

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
like a business meeting, you get into an elevator.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
Everybody in the elevator, there's men, there's women, they're well-dressed.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
You don't know what they do for a living.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
They could be high, low status comparatively.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
What do you wish in your fantasy selfish egotistical brain?

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
What do you wish everybody in that elevator was thinking?

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
Well, I had something teed up, but then you asked the wrong question.

07:54.000 --> 08:00.000
Because my fantasy was that one of the people in the whole elevator would go,

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
Oh, Mr. Harmon, no, I'm sorry.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
And then press a secret button on the elevator.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
And then the side of the elevator would open.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
And it would be like, there would be like fog and lights.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
And I would just be like in my hoodie, like Mark Zuckerberg and I'd go to the other people.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
I'd be like, I don't know.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
I just go through it.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
So I guess the answer to your question is I wish everyone in the elevator had thought.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
What is he doing on this elevator?

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Now pick the person on the elevator that you hate the most.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
What do you wish that person was thinking when that happened, when you went out the side door?

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Wait, sorry, I didn't miss the top of that.

08:42.000 --> 08:49.000
So you get secret side elevator door status and you have your Zuckerberg hoodie on.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
And you leave and you're like, sorry.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
The person that you hated the most on site when you went in the elevator,

08:57.000 --> 09:03.000
what do you wish he or she were thinking as that happened, like to make you the most happy?

09:03.000 --> 09:14.000
I was wrong about football.

09:14.000 --> 09:27.000
Or all the crunches in the world couldn't lift my spirit right now.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Alright, you go into the thing.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
That guy had pizza for breakfast.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
I've eaten nothing but almonds for six weeks.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
And he gets to go through the side of an elevator.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
What happens, I mean, let's fantasize, what happens at the side of the elevator?

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
Does it get you to the floor that you're going to faster?

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
Or does it take you to another realm?

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
Well, I mean, people go into a building and they go up and down.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
That's like people's shit.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
And you'll be in a world of pure imagination.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
The truth is that way.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
This is a fucking lie. This is a rat race.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Oh, I hope I get to the 35th floor.

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
Psych, the real people go this way.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Me and D.L. Hugley.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
Alright, so isn't he the one with the special purple door at the airport?

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
Harmontown deep cut.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
Well, I think that's, I mean, we have special friends here tonight.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
That's probably why it's really packed.

10:31.000 --> 10:38.000
I just wanted to tell you guys that I have a lot of paralysis when I talk to people in person.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
But I could get into that later.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
Like, I don't really know how to talk to people.

10:44.000 --> 10:50.000
But I think in the last few shows, you've gone through leaps and bounds where you have done very good interviews.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
No, but you're talking about, this is a lie up here.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
I'm talking about like actual, like writing in the Uber when the Uber driver goes,

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
uh, let me go up to Fountain.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
He's shorter, he's shorter.

11:03.000 --> 11:10.000
You could go down Holly. We could keep going down Holly.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
No, no, no, Fountain. Fountain!

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
And then I just go, uh...

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Alright.

11:18.000 --> 11:23.000
Because I don't want to talk to you. And it's not even about the conflict.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
It hurts to talk to people. It makes, it's like showering. It hurts my skin.

11:28.000 --> 11:35.000
And like, when we were in New York, and I, like, when I was walking outside that restaurant,

11:35.000 --> 11:41.000
and the waitress, because it was Dino's favorite restaurant, everyone knows Dino's, everyone knows us.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
And the waitress runs into me afterwards and she goes,

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
hey, how are you? Hey, have you met Wes Anderson and Spike Jones?

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
And I'm like, and she points through the window of the restaurant and there they are.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
And I'm like, no, she's like, you should meet him.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
And I'm like, no, I shouldn't.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
That's like royalty, first of all.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
And she's like, you're royalty.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
And I'm like, that's the problem right there is that you saying that and that whole thing being there.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
Like, there's tears and I know what nothing to do with this.

12:16.000 --> 12:24.000
And then she dragged me in and she said, Wes, Spike, do you know Dan Harmon?

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Okay, that's a nightmare.

12:25.000 --> 12:31.000
And they're like, no. And I'm like, hi. Nice to meet you.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
Also, I'm going to go in the back. And I could have done that anyway.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
I don't think I would know if I sat down next to them which one was which.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
I didn't know which one was which either.

12:42.000 --> 12:48.000
And I'm happy about this. We wickipedia it later and my guests would have been wrong.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Because they look very different.

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
But I thought, I thought, you know what, these guys are masters of the lateral.

12:55.000 --> 13:01.000
I bet the guy you think is Spike Jones looks like Wes Anderson.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
And I was right, except I was wrong.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
So I would have made an ass of myself.

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
So how did that come? Did you sit with them or just walk by like meeting the queen?

13:12.000 --> 13:19.000
I'm 42, so I wasn't like, I didn't like, my whole goal was just leave only footprints.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
I just said, hello, nice to meet you. I made eye contact.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
I breathed regularly and I just shook their hands and I made eye contact.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
I didn't go in for the double cup weird like sexy handshake.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
I just shook their hands. I said, hi, nice to meet you.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
It's very, very, very exciting and weird to meet you guys.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
And I walked away and I feel like I won by doing that.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Do you think that they knew who you were?

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
No, no, I hate the question.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
I mean, I wonder if you're not a celebrity, but I wonder if you are on their radar or not.

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
But I could have like through work, you know, having a studio and stuff.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
Like there was, if I had known which one was Spike for sure by looking at him,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
I could have, there was like an in-road there.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
I could have said, oh, we have mutual friends.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
But I just boned out and I think I'm a better person for it.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
But it wasn't about politics.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
It wasn't about star fucking versus like nervousness or anything like that.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
I'm talking about like that could happen with anybody.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
I don't like talking to anybody.

14:20.000 --> 14:26.000
Like I like, I've just gotten able to like do the thing like, you know,

14:26.000 --> 14:32.000
when people, if somebody says like, like, it's like, I forged this world.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Like I'm like Sauron.

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
Like I created this dumb, like weird world for myself where I could be comfortable.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
It's like every little, every little aspect of it is engineered,

14:42.000 --> 14:48.000
including the fact that like the only physical social interactions that I can handle

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
are people like, like on a sidewalk going like,

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
getting excited when they see me and pointing at me so that I know like it's done,

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
where there is no, we don't have to worry about anything.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
But if you meet somebody like at a restaurant or anywhere,

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
Uber driver that doesn't know who you are, that's never fun for you.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
No, God, no, no.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
It's pain, it's physical pain.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
But I've been around you when I've like,

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
when you stumble onto common ground with a stranger and you can go,

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
oh, you get really excited about that.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
But that's always when I'm being introduced to them through a friend

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
or something like that, like when you're hanging out,

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
you know, having drinks and some of those, oh, this is Molly

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
and she's a friend of someone's.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
I was like, oh, what do you do?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Oh, I'm an astronaut.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Oh, Jesus Christ.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
I have like 90 astronaut questions.

15:33.000 --> 15:39.000
And then, yeah, it's, I mean, those, yeah, that's good.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
That's fine.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
So that's not 90% of like how you have to talk to people.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
Like you have to talk to people who are scooping ice cream.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
If you like ice cream, you have to talk to the ice cream person.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
They're like, well, how many scoops do you want?

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
And you're just like, I'm just like, two, two, two.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
Like I just fucking like my brain just explodes.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
I can't.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
That's so funny because like, that's my favorite thing is, what are you doing?

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Is that your phone?

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Oh, it's back here.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
Sorry.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
Like, I'm like infatuated with strangers like,

16:12.000 --> 16:18.000
and the person sitting next to you is the most interesting thing in the world to me.

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
Because of the free fall, the chaos of that moment, when you're talking to somebody and

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
you go, I don't know if we have anything in common at all.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
Sometimes you find out, okay, this person is kind of a bummer.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
Or you go, oh, this person worked on the fucking Saturn 5 rocket.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Like that's fucking amazing.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
But that moment for you is more torture for.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
Yeah, I think we both agree that it's like falling off something.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
And you're just like, I love that.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
I too is my favorite.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
And I'm like, I hate that.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
But I feel like I'm honest.

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
And you're like a Patrick Swayze thrill seeker or something.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
I mean, I like it because you can find out.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
I can be very misanthropic and very philanthropic from moment to moment,

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
depending on the quality of the person sitting next to you.

17:09.000 --> 17:15.000
But it's times when, like I get really endlessly fascinated by a stranger.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
And you do too, but you're, you come at it from a very like.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Holy shit.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
I just got Phil anthropic versus misanthropic.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
Phil as like file, like pedophile, like children.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Yeah.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Yeah.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Like, like, like, I love it.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
Like that's not the file word that you like are the most familiar with.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
God damn it.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
How about?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Guys are always catching me.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
You could have started Philadelphia.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
Well, I know, well, yeah, Philadelphia.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
I'm just getting that now, though.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
That's what I'm saying.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
Like miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Miss Anthropy versus Phil Anthropy.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
I didn't get the Phil.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Misogyny.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Well, Philogyny.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Phil.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
I love Chinese.

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
I love those Chinese up and down Fifth Street and Fourth Avenue.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
How do you do, young ladies? She got a hole where your wiener should be.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Got a Chinese.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
I love your Chinese.

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
Cause I'm a feminist and I'm a town bambam.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
All right.

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
Thanks, thanks, kids.

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
Our next guest is no stranger to Chinese.

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
Andrew Ludweber.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
I do want to bring him out because it's hot up here.

18:39.000 --> 18:44.000
And I want you to see that I'm not the only one that sweats this much.

18:44.000 --> 18:49.000
And I always, I feel like it's, I think you guys know it's hot in this room,

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
but it's six degrees cooler where you're sitting.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
I'm telling you.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
And then you look at me and you go, he's so disgusting.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
I'm hotter than you.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
Just a little hotter.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
There's people sitting out there fanning themselves right now.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
It's like the, like to kill a mockingbird.

19:09.000 --> 19:18.000
I just come to bust up a shipper robe.

19:18.000 --> 19:26.000
It's so hot in here that civil rights are being, like, are back on the table.

19:26.000 --> 19:32.000
It automatically, when it gets hot enough, every room becomes a Southern courtroom.

19:32.000 --> 19:37.000
Tech textbooks may not be allowed in science class tomorrow, depending on what happens tonight,

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
because it's so hot.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
Our next guest is a Gregory Peck, everybody.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Old friend of the show.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
We miss him very much, but we're so glad he spent some time away because he's been busy

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
and has done something really incredible.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
Not that he had not done all kinds of incredible things.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
We were happy with him quite the way he was.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
But he kind of, if you're talking about the person I think you're talking about,

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
he just deals in incredible humanity all the time.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
That's what he fucking does.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
And he does it for no reason.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
He does it because it's what he does.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
He's a magical, like, magic person.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
He's a magical, magic person.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
He's our friend, and let's talk about his new project,

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
which everybody is going to be really excited to see.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
Please welcome back Bobcat Goldthwaite.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Thank you.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
Nice. That's really nice.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
The idea that people would be excited and happy to see you,

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
that's the worst thing that could happen to me.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
When people go, oh, when people are happy and excited to see me,

20:58.000 --> 21:03.000
I just don't want them to be normal.

21:03.000 --> 21:08.000
You're an actor, turned director, probably for the same reason,

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
and your circumstances are so different.

21:11.000 --> 21:16.000
The idea that anybody would ever see me and point is,

21:16.000 --> 21:22.000
kind of, for me, that's the same as saying you should be prom king,

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
but for what you're probably perceiving that moment,

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
is like, oh, that's the guy from Police Academy, and this guy's gonna...

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Yeah, and here he comes.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
I was in Detroit at a film festival, and this guy's like,

21:30.000 --> 21:35.000
I'm your biggest fan, and I took a picture with him,

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
and he's like, what do you do now?

21:38.000 --> 21:45.000
My biggest fan does not have access to IMDb.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
That's what I learned there.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
But it was a good question.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
What would you want people to say, though,

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
because they still have a big ego?

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
If they had, I want them, after I left,

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
that was him, I blew it, fuck!

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
So I do have a big ego.

22:01.000 --> 22:07.000
It's kind of sad, but one of the things that's amazing about you now

22:07.000 --> 22:12.000
is that you accomplish things psychologically

22:12.000 --> 22:17.000
that other people think are just kind of theories from therapy and stuff.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
Fuck you, Harmon, just talk.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
You've had kind of a breech-birth career-wise,

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
in terms of like, because your feet came out first.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
Yeah, I had the career most people had at the beginning, at the end.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
Like, I sold out at the beginning.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
Well, maybe, I mean, it's just like you can use those words,

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
but it's just more to the objective point.

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
Like, you were first famous for your hair and your voice.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
And screenings.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
And your face.

22:44.000 --> 22:49.000
And I mean, that does not to say that your stand-up wasn't awesome,

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
but people were like, my mom was like,

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
that's the guy, that's the screechy guy with the hair.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
And then you, yeah, and then you, but now...

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
Now I'm the mumbling bald guy.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Who's making these amazing things.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
Imagine that, yeah, you're in disguise when you're at the mall.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
You're like, god damn it, nobody...

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
I got hit by TMZ, which I was shocked.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
It was in New York, because in LA, no one cares.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
And they were trying to agitate me, and the guy goes,

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
they're making another police academy to rebooting it.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
Don't you think they should use the original cast?

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
And I was like, no.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
And they go, why not?

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
Because a lot of us are dead.

23:34.000 --> 23:39.000
And then I said, if they're going to reboot it,

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
they should do it.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
They did the 21 Jones Street.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
They should make it a comedy this time.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
And that made the broadcast.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
But then I said, this is what didn't make the broadcast.

23:50.000 --> 23:59.000
I said, it's not really the right time to be doing wacky police comedies, you know.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
The police are killing civilians, you know that.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Police Academy 5, Ferguson.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Oh, Mahoney.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
That first movie in the 80s, it was at the central point of the irony

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
that Krall in the beginning was like, oh, this crazy government,

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
now they're going to let just anybody be a police.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
And then it happened.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
Yeah, the covers, it's like, I'm scratching my head with my gun,

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
and I don't know what to do with my gun, bang, bang, bang, bang.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
And it was like a joke then, and now it's like a horrible reality.

24:32.000 --> 24:37.000
I get, sometimes I'll be doing shows and someone will give me the Police Academy DVD,

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
the first one, and I wasn't in that.

24:41.000 --> 24:46.000
And I just, I'm not in this movie.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
You're not in the first one, you're in the second one.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
No, I didn't think the quality of the script was there yet.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
You were holding out for more of a story structure.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Yeah, I said, this is shit.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Come back to me when there's...

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
Come back to me when Winslow has more of an arc.

25:03.000 --> 25:11.000
When his Atari squiggle doesn't sound exactly like his Nintendo squiggle.

25:11.000 --> 25:16.000
Well, you know, he, he, he's, he's, that is a talent.

25:16.000 --> 25:21.000
I'm not going to just diminish what he does, but, you know, he does that all day long.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
Those noises, like, he really does.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
Like if we were talking, that's his, you know,

25:27.000 --> 25:34.000
you know, and one day it was really cold and miserable and reshooting a scene for the third time

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
and we're in the basement of this building avoiding the weather.

25:37.000 --> 25:42.000
And he found the, you know, the dowel, the inside of a paper towel, the tube.

25:42.000 --> 25:48.000
And so that was, you know, he, it was like backlit when he found it, because he could just, you know...

25:48.000 --> 25:54.000
It sucked Perlman with a fucking shot of that.

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
Yeah, it was like a vintage Strativarius.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
So he, you know, he's making his helicopter farts and just...

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Helicopter?

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
And we're all trying to eat, and I find, and I really feel bad.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
So this is a public apology to him.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
And I just finally go, Michael, no.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
No.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
No.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Swear to God.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Slow clap in the cafeteria.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
No.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Slow clap.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
I feel really bad.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
In my mind when I think of that story, and then a marching band came out.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Da-da-da-da-da-da.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Rip-tally thrown confetti around.

26:30.000 --> 26:35.000
But they're all playing toilet paper tubes.

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
All right, so, since the last time we saw you,

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
I think you were talking about this early on.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
You were shooting footage back when we first made Friends, I even think.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
You've been working on this for a little while, calling it together.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
You have this, should we call him a mentor?

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Yeah, Barry's definitely a mentor.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
The movie is a documentary I made, and it's out now.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
It's called Call Me Lucky.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
And I started doing comedy when I was 16.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
Tom Kenny was 15 in Syracuse in this town next door.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
There is an ad that said they were looking for comedians.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
Because Tommy's always been amazing with voices.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
He called up as a dude.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
He was an adult, not a teenager.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
He's like, yeah, we're a couple comedians.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
We want to come by.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
He's a swear to God.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
I think Wilfred Brimley's coming in to do a set tonight.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
And we showed up, and there's Barry.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
He's just such a character even back then.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
He just looked up, and he said,

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
Is your parents driving you?

27:36.000 --> 27:42.000
So, you know, folks aren't aware of him.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
He's a political sadist still.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
And my favorite Barry Crimmins joke is people say,

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
If you don't love this country, why don't you leave it?

27:49.000 --> 27:55.000
He says, because I don't want to be victimized by its foreign policies.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
So a real sharp guy.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
And he started a club in Boston that a lot of folks like Stephen Wright

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
and Paula Poundstone, myself, a lot of people got their start in this room.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
And he was definitely a mentor and the gatekeeper.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Like, if he thought you were derivative of anyone else,

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
you didn't get on stage.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
And so was Kevin Meany and Steve Sweeney and Lenny Clark.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
All these comics came out of that scene, and he drove it.

28:17.000 --> 28:22.000
I don't feel like, the movie isn't, it's about him.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
I think it's important people meet him and stuff.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
But what it's really about is he, during a performance,

28:27.000 --> 28:32.000
disclosed on stage about his rapes when he was four.

28:32.000 --> 28:38.000
And then he tried to process this.

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
So in the course of him processing it, he went online.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
This is in the early 90s, mid 90s, and AOL just started.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
So there was people exchanging child pornography in chat rooms.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
And he complained to AOL and they didn't do anything.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
And then he went to the cops, and the cops in the movie say,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
We didn't even have computers then.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
So he posed as kids, got all this evidence against AOL,

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
and then took AOL to the floor of the Senate during a judiciary hearing.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
And it was like a Capra story, this nightclub comedian

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
embarrassing this giant corporation.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
And then afterwards there was a shift in him.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
What was the process for him, like, how did he go?

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
By the way, the movie's funny. I know it sounds...

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
The movie's amazing.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
I mean, which is a story in and of itself,

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
is the fact that you've made these movies that people adore

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
because they're so punk rock, they're so you,

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
and they're so sort of just...

29:29.000 --> 29:34.000
If they're nothing else, they are you just trying to steer off

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
of any conceivable road in front of you, shakes the clown.

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
There's people who...

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
And there's an anger to that stuff too.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
I don't see it, but yeah.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
I mean, you're laughing the whole time, but you're humorous.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Kind of like God bless America when we shot a baby.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
I really thought... I really... It was like I wrote it.

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
She goes, don't you have a baby?

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
And he pumps a shotgun, she throws it near and we shoot the baby.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
That was the only thing I've ever written

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
that I thought at some point someone was going to say,

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
hey man, you can't do this, but it never happened.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
I was like, I guess we're shooting a baby today.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
And I said, give me a baby that looks really ugly.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
Like, I wanted it to look like someone shaved a pug, you know?

30:20.000 --> 30:25.000
And the baby came and it was really cute and it didn't cry

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
and it would just sit there like, you know.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
And I feel bad about this too.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
This is my immense story.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
This is a good place to do it.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
The audience is 25 years old.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
They love apologies and punishment.

30:39.000 --> 30:44.000
So the baby didn't cry.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
The parents come in and they go, what are we shooting today?

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
I'm like, you're a baby.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
And then I realized nobody told him what this thing was about.

30:53.000 --> 30:58.000
So we gave him some more money and then that's true.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
It was a stunt bump, I guess.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Stunt bump?

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
The baby just sat there just like this.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
So I would have the parents the day out.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
I'd have them walk off the set and the kid didn't give a shit.

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
And then nothing.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
It took its biscuit out of its mouth.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Nothing, just sat there.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
So then I'd love to tell you I'm a better man than this,

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
but I got down on all fours and I put keys over the lens

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
so it would be looking in the right direction

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
and then I got right in the baby space and I was like...

31:27.000 --> 31:32.000
And the baby would go...

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

31:34.000 --> 31:39.000
And whenever I would duck out of the way,

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
the baby would shut up immediately.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
So the keys were to get the attention

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
and then you were there to horrify the baby.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Correct.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
And as soon as my face wasn't there,

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
it would just shut down.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
It was like that Michigan J. Frog, you know,

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
like, hello my baby, hello my ragtime dog.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
You're running and getting the DP.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
You're like, I swear to God, the big...

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
He was crying.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Sure he was, Bobcat.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Free beer.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
So I imagine some day that kid would be 10

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
and a police academy would come on and be like...

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
And just...

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
And then you'll have your shot.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
I got it.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
But anyways, to whack Schmaltzy about it

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
or just at least kind of mythical,

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
I mean, all of that awesome punk rock,

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
anger, energy, whatever you call it,

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
you don't call it anger, but like...

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
No, I guess it is.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
...cynical, whatever, like non-establishment.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
And you had this father figure early on

32:38.000 --> 32:42.000
in your comedy career who had this scar in his life

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
and then one of your...

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
There's all these different kinds of movies.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
The most recent one before that is this...

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
You know, there's another weird turn for you

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
that found footage like a Bigfoot movie.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
It's like that does not resemble Shakespeare's clown that much.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
It's not like you're a Rob Zombie trying to...

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
Like, you're like, no, you don't get it yet.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
No, I just like Bigfoot.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
The cheerleaders are dumb and they should be tortured.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
One more movie and I swear you're going to get it.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
No, I just wanted to make a Bigfoot movie

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
because I like Bigfoot.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
And...

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
You killed this guy with your first documentary.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
So, Barry, it's what you say, anti-establishment

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
because I met him as a teenager

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
and here's this guy who was totally anti-establishment

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
and he wasn't condescending to us.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
He actually encouraged it.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
So, you know, that was...

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
That really...

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
How did he come out of it?

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Like, is he happy with what happened?

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Is that satisfying for him?

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
I don't think he is happy.

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
No, he's the first one to make those jokes.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
There's a scene in the movie where

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
he actually goes into the basement that this happened in

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
and I was just filming the basement

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
because I thought that was way more powerful

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
just to show these spaces,

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
but I did not want him to go in there

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
and he goes, you go through a problem, you know,

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
you don't go around it.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
There's no demons. I'm demystifying the space.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
I'm going down there. You can film it or not.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Had he been back there since?

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
No, no, he says it's not a place I like to...

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
This is the first time when you've been...

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Yeah, so he was like...

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
So, we had a huge argument

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
and I said,

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
well, just give me five minutes so I can roll.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
And it's in the movie and it's very powerful

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
and there was a reason I was trying to remember,

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
but one of the things happened is

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
he's very eloquent in the basement

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
and then afterwards, because I knew it would happen,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
he went in a shock, you know,

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
he does this weird thing when he's going in a shock

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
and he goes, I can't remember what I said.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Is any of it usable?

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
And I said, oh, it doesn't matter.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
I'm going to play Yackety Sacks.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
So, oh, that's what I was going to say.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Just what you were saying, he said,

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
we were doing a Q&A and I said, you know,

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
and I wanted to film the spaces

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
and I didn't want to do reenactments

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
and he goes, you didn't want to do reenactments.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
It works every time.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
But Bob, Bob,

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
there's a...

35:02.000 --> 35:07.000
Does Barry emerge from this, like,

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
is that more healing for him?

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
Yeah, yeah, and the point of the movie

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
for me was to show

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
he comes out through the other side

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
and not only...

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
he's not a person, a victim of this.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
As he says, I'm not a victim anymore.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
It is about coming all the way through the other side

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
and, you know, he starts off the movie,

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
he's just full of rage and he's still angry,

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
but, you know, his targets are now, you know,

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
more directed at people and things.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
That's the thing that I want people listening to this

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
as far as plugging the movie is concerned,

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
because the tough thing about good movies,

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
especially ones that are profound,

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
that have to do with insights into human darkness,

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
they're not always at the top of your list,

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
no matter how good you know they'll be.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Like, I still haven't seen the act of killing

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
and everyone says it's a great movie.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
I mean, it's the most important movie you'll ever see.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
And that's what...

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
But the thing about that is that I keep saying to people,

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
like, yeah, but don't worry about it.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
It will not challenge you that way.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
It's colorful and whimsical and ironic.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
It's...

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
That's...

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
And your movie is similar in that sense.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
It's why I texted you halfway through it

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
and was like, this is really genius,

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
because there...

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
And it's something about Barry, too.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
I don't think I have the IQ or the vocabulary

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
in what the real important thing

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
about what's on the microscope slide there.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
It has something to do with the fact

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
that he's really smart and really funny

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
and really autonomous and really unafraid

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
of the entire United States government

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
and all of mainstream society

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
and anyone that could ever tell him

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
that he's gross or fat or dirty or stupid.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
He's...

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
And that he doesn't cut the silhouette,

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
therefore, of somebody who is capable

36:55.000 --> 37:00.000
of having something so...

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Just...

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Just so...

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
This is where my vocabulary breaks down.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
The dichotomy is very interesting to me,

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
because he's not...

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
It's like we're used to breaking up the world

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
into guys like that that are like...

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
He didn't...

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
He didn't say, oh, my God, I was molested on stage

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
and then curl up in a ball and start sucking his thumb

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
and then become really unfunny.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
He became even funnier and even smarter

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
and even stronger, but in a process

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
that he had to ask himself questions about,

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
like everything that he had ever thought or done

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
and every formation of all.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
And how do you know, even those of us

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
who can't point to a big red trauma on a map,

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
we have to go to therapy and wonder

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
how much of what makes people chuckle

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
when I talk is unhealthy and how much of it is like.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
I don't know, it's a really...

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
It's an important movie for that reason.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
It's just a...

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
Here, put this on the poster.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
I'm going to give you a great quote.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
Even if he hadn't been molested,

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
this would be a great documentary.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Um...

38:02.000 --> 38:07.000
Well, because he's a really, really incredible...

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Well, I think people would go,

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
well, you know, did you pitch this movie?

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
It's like, where?

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Here you go.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Hey, here's a comedian that you're not familiar with.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
No way, he gets raped as a kid.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Hear me out.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Hear me out.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
It's $10 million, Mr. Goldbach.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
What was it like...

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
Like, did you get...

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
What was it like, the journey for you in that movie?

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Like, did you think that you were going to get through that

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
without it being hard?

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Did you know how hard it would be for you?

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
Like, what was your journey through all that darkness

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
and all that sadness?

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
Yeah, it was...

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
You know, I was very concerned for my friend,

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
and Barry says that whenever the movie would have come first,

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
his well-being was always more important than making a movie,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
even if it was a movie about...

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
But it was...

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
It's been very hard, you know?

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
What did you go through?

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
Like, what was your journey on that?

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Well, it's now, you know?

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
We've had a lot of success with the movie

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
and we show screenings,

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
and people, you know, really like it,

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
so I have to deal with that.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
I don't like success, and then there's...

39:18.000 --> 39:23.000
No, okay, but there's often, after the movie,

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
you know, adult survivors come out when they disclose,

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
and often they're telling me this is the first time

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
they ever did this.

39:28.000 --> 39:32.000
So you get a full portion of that every time you show the movie?

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
Yeah, yeah.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
It's been...

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
I'm glad the movie's helping people.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
I'm glad it's been doing so well and people are receiving it,

39:40.000 --> 39:45.000
but, you know, it's...

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
You know, the birth of the movie,

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
and I'll talk about it here,

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
because the last time we worked together was here.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
You know, Robin Williams is my best friend,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
and he knew...

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
I wanted to do Barry's Story all the way in the mid-90s.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
I thought, you know, we took a swipe at Scripps and everything,

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
because I thought I'd want to have someone play him.

40:04.000 --> 40:09.000
And it was Robin that kind of suggested that I jettisoned that idea.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
I'm smiling, because he's like,

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
he's like, I'm too old to play that role.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
He's like, he's like, why don't you do it as a documentary?

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
So...

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
The last time we talked about this was Tasha's, your daughter's birthday.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Yeah.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
You sat down and said, how are you doing?

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
He said, well, I had a breakup.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
My best friend died, and I'm making a movie about...

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
Child rape, yeah.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
It was even better than that.

40:30.000 --> 40:35.000
It was divorce, broke up, decorating the Christmas tree with another woman.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
My best friend passed away, and then, yeah,

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
for about eight to 12 hours a day, I would edit a...

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
You're dealing with this shit.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Child rape documentary.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
So, it was...

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
I'm really ready to do, like, a talking duck movie.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
It's just something really acid.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Well, that's...

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
I mean, here comes Quackers.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
They were letting you shoot babies before, but now you've like...

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Do you feel like there's like...

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
You get the karma holsters off the, like, full,

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
and you can shoot 11 babies in the next movie?

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
Yeah, at least it wasn't like that duck.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
But Barry wants to do a sequel.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
He called me greedy.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
So, Robin was the one.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
He said, you know, shoot us a duck.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
And he said, I don't have any money.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
And he actually gave me some money to start filming.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
And that's how the whole movie got made, was that.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
You wanted him to do a live-action version of him as Barry?

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
Yeah, that was really what I was thinking.

41:27.000 --> 41:32.000
And then we still were thinking about making it with someone else playing him.

41:32.000 --> 41:36.000
And Barry wrote a script that was about 350 pages long.

41:36.000 --> 41:41.000
And then I took a stab at a script, which actually helped the duck,

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
because I kind of had the structure in my head.

41:43.000 --> 41:48.000
And I didn't do that as a bait and switch how his disclosures reveal.

41:48.000 --> 41:53.000
I just wanted the audience to feel exactly how I felt knowing this guy,

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
knowing this guy really well, and then learning,

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
oh, now it makes sense.

41:58.000 --> 42:03.000
I think the 48 hours version would have been raped at four,

42:03.000 --> 42:07.000
comedian, and then nothing would have been funny for 45 minutes.

42:07.000 --> 42:11.000
Well, it's also like, I want to bring our other friend up,

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
but the other powerful thing about it,

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
maybe this is what I was trying to articulate,

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
is the fact that you do it that way.

42:19.000 --> 42:24.000
Because I feel like sickness, abuse, death,

42:24.000 --> 42:29.000
the things that we fear, the things that we know that are the worst things that can happen to us,

42:29.000 --> 42:34.000
we tend to relate to them emotionally as diseases.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
And when our friends are afflicted with them,

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
we have this temptation to...

42:41.000 --> 42:48.000
It's this terrible syndrome of shame and guilt and stuff that we go like,

42:48.000 --> 42:56.000
oh, God, well, this person, if this terrible thing happened to them, then that makes them a different kind of action figure.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
They need special tools and backpacks and things,

42:59.000 --> 43:07.000
but nobody is more human and more dimensionalized than Barry Crimmins.

43:07.000 --> 43:13.000
Nobody has more tools to deal with any Manticore that would cross his path.

43:13.000 --> 43:20.000
And then this thing is placed in his path,

43:20.000 --> 43:24.000
and we watch him eat it, and we watch him digest it, and we do it with him,

43:24.000 --> 43:28.000
and it humanizes it, and it makes it a real thing, which is really...

43:28.000 --> 43:33.000
I often wonder if Barry...

43:33.000 --> 43:38.000
Because he almost, in my mind, may have been that kid at four,

43:38.000 --> 43:44.000
because his friends were talking about some preschool revolt that he led.

43:44.000 --> 43:49.000
They handed out books, and then he threw them out the window.

43:49.000 --> 43:53.000
They were like, we're not going to need books.

43:53.000 --> 43:59.000
He said that when he disclosed to me that my reaction wasn't...

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
Someone says this to you, now it's on your lap.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
You're re-seeing this person.

44:04.000 --> 44:09.000
And when he told me, he said that it was almost...

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
He talks very affectionately about how I reacted.

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
I was just like, oh, I was kind of...

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
Not happy, but I was just like, oh, well, that makes sense.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
Where did you first see him or hear him?

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
Do you have any favorite jokes, the first jokes that you remember

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
when you first thought he was funny?

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
Oh, yeah, the first time I saw him.

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
The first thing I remember was the first time I saw him walking on stage.

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
He's swilling a beer that he pulled out of his jacket,

44:39.000 --> 44:45.000
and he's smoking, and he's like, ah, I'm on a health kick lately.

44:45.000 --> 44:52.000
We've kept one of our other dear friends up in there.

44:52.000 --> 44:56.000
Like you has been out in the world, and we want to hear what he's been up to.

44:56.000 --> 45:09.000
Let's bring Curtis Armstrong out.

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
What a pleasure.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Thank you.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Thank you.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Hey, buddy.

45:18.000 --> 45:23.000
I have these friendships that literally only exist on stage,

45:23.000 --> 45:27.000
and it's very unhealthy.

45:27.000 --> 45:32.000
I'm just explaining that I'm not a healthy person,

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
and that's what I was talking about earlier.

45:34.000 --> 45:40.000
That goes without saying, but what was interesting for me

45:40.000 --> 45:45.000
is that I'm here because I've been away for a while,

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
and I asked if I could come by, and he said, yeah,

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
but of course he doesn't tell me.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
Oh, that I'm here?

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
That you're here.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
So I show up just as you come out,

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
and it's the first time I think I've been in a room with him

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
in about 30 years or something.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Oh, I didn't know you guys crossed paths with him.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
We did a movie called One Crazy Summer.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Oh, yeah!

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
He's just fucking crying.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
That was my brain.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
Bob, that's what's missing you, Joe Murray, too, right?

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
Joe Murray, yeah.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
Bill Murray, you're right.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Carlos America, the one we love and adore.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
John Cusack.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
I was talking about this movie at Nausea,

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
but why did they make that fucking connection?

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
Well, that's how we met.

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
We were in our 20s, and we made that movie,

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
and it was...

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
I'm a big indoor BB gun enthusiast,

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
but at the time we made that movie,

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
I was a big indoor model rocketry enthusiast.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
So every night I'd go back into my room

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
and build a big rocket,

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
and then shoot it down the hallway of the hotel,

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
because there was this security guard

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
who was like, you guys are making too much noise,

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
and I was like, oh, I'll give you noise.

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
So we would sit there with lawn chairs

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
for this poor guy to come around the corner

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
and go, shoot, shoot, shoot.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Rock it at him.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Yeah, that was a lot of stuff like that.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
It was great, and what was really great about that movie

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
is if you see it now, there's Bill Murray,

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
there's John Cusack.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
Joe, Joe Murray, Joe.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
Now I feel better.

47:08.000 --> 47:12.000
Joe Murray, and Bill, and John Cusack,

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
and to me more.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
To me more.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
But what's really funny about it is

47:17.000 --> 47:21.000
he's so completely took over this movie.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Wow.

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
No, wait, let me finish what I'm saying.

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
So what happens is we all show up in...

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
I love this movie.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
We all think that we have our thing going,

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
and we know what we're doing, and we have our bit,

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
and Cusack's got a name already,

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
and to me he's got a name already.

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
But after about a week on the set,

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
they're all talking like him.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
On camera.

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
Not just off camera, where we're off going,

47:52.000 --> 47:56.000
you know, but on camera.

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
And it started like with Cusack doing it,

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
and then, remember this?

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
Yeah, he did love it.

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
And Joel, and then to me, started doing it.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
So they would be on camera doing scenes

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
that had nothing to do with him.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
And Savage Steve is like,

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
you know, this wasn't supposed to be about Grover's family.

48:14.000 --> 48:18.000
But when we...

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
So to me, he was on General Hospital.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
Cusack had done that Rob Reiner movie,

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
a sure thing.

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
Everybody was coming up.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
Everybody had a high-cute, but Curtis.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
So we had all got to dinner,

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
and nobody would recognize anybody,

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
and it would always be,

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
Booga! It's fucking Booga!

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Booga!

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
Booga, come over here!

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Cage later made Jackie Templeton.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
It's just a Demy's character on that movie.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
No, it was great.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
It was such a great scene.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
There's a scene where Steve told me later,

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
that scene where I...

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
It's with you and I,

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
and I say, talk about a little fat kid who's grown up.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
Yes, oh God, yes.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
And he goes, were you that fat kid?

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
And I was like,

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
no, I used to punch the shit out of him.

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
And I'm almost in tears telling that story.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
I didn't remember.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Steve said that was something I pitched.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
You didn't pitch it.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
I'll tell you exactly what happened.

49:16.000 --> 49:20.000
I'm gonna fucking die over here.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
I'm so happy.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
I have never forgotten this,

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
because I honestly didn't know Bobcat at that point.

49:27.000 --> 49:31.000
He was just this God-like thing

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
that showed up on the set one day,

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
and you couldn't stop, you couldn't speak.

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
You weren't familiar with anything that you hadn't seen him.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
I don't know if I'd seen him.

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
I'd never seen him live,

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
so I don't think I saw him live a lot after.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
But at that time I hadn't seen him.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
But he shows up,

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
and there's just nobody like this man in the world.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
And it wasn't like he was on

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
in that sort of Bobcat character all the time.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
He wasn't doing that.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
But he was so interesting,

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
and so funny, and so smart,

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
and everything, all this great stuff was coming out of him,

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
and you just wanted to sit and listen to him.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
And so we're at lunch one day.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
He comes over to me and says,

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
come here.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
And he takes me into a garage.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
And...

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
I'm not falling for that again.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
And he says,

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
I have this idea for a scene,

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
and I want to run through it with you

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
before I show Savage.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
This is what happened.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
We sit down, and I'm just looking at you,

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
waiting for you to start.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
And you start in on that speech,

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
where you say, you know,

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
there was this little fat kid once,

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
and you go through the whole thing,

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
and it's very funny if you know the movie,

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
and if you see the movie, he's really funny.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
And he tells this whole sad story

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
about the little fat boy,

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
like he's confessing.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
And I say, and I just said to him,

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
as a person,

51:01.000 --> 51:04.000
were you that little fat boy?

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
And he said,

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
no, but I used to beat the shit out of him.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
And I thought it was the best thing I'd ever seen.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
So we got Savage from lunch,

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
and we ran through it again for Savage,

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
and it's the big scene that he has in the movie.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
And he just came up with it.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
But I didn't...

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
Yeah, I was naïve about how things work.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Apparently not.

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
Apparently you could just put a scene in a movie.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
Yeah, I know.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
You were right, you were right.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
When you had me drag community,

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
I didn't do any of that shit.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
You didn't come down and go,

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
what the fuck is going on?

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Goldway's in a scene now?

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
So for real, Curtis,

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
that whole scene, that monologue is all...

51:49.000 --> 51:53.000
Improvised entirely by him in a garage.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Because that's one of the memorable...

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
I know, that's why I'm bringing it up.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
It's one of the big scenes in the movie.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
I do remember it,

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
and I have the best memory in the world.

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
Because I forgot that they were in that movie together.

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
I mean, I get to travel around a lot with Joel Murray,

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
and whom I love and adore,

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
who's one of the most delightful people there is.

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
And he's told stories about working on One Crazy Summer

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
about how much fun you guys had.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Yeah, it was really, really much fun.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
All the partying, because it was the 80s,

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
and it was groove-tastic,

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
really sexy and fun.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
I remember the Q-Sex, like,

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
I got this friend, and he's going to put him in the movie,

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
and it was Piven.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
And Piven shows up, gets hammered,

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
jumps in the pool, cracks his face open

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
on the bottom of the pool.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
It hasn't been on camera yet,

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
and they had a putty his face with mortician's wax.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
He had a big cut in his head.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
Aw, Pivi.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Aw, the Piv.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Poor Pivi.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Mr. Sulfridge.

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
So, well, well, well, well.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Enough One Crazy Summer.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
But that must have been an awesome time to be

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
young comics in,

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
when they were making big comedy films.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Well, I remember that,

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
the name of it was called,

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
what was it, My Summer Vacation?

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
My Summer Vacation.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Yeah, yeah, and then they were saying,

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
Warner Brothers said,

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
you can't call that because they had vacation.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
And so they said,

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
we're going to call it One Crazy Summer.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
And he goes, if they put out Woody Allen movies,

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
they'd be one neurotic Jewish guy.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Yeah.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Yeah, that's what,

53:27.000 --> 53:30.000
I mean, well, to counter what Jeff said,

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
I think the further back you go,

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
and we think in this desolate landscape

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
of where it's catch is catch can,

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
and we just get a little giggled here,

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
and my podcast got 600 hits,

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
and I'm so happy.

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
And I think you talk to the Farrelly Brothers

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
about Kingpin, for example,

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
and you hear this story about how

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
they almost killed themselves.

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
I thought Kingpin was the best Farrelly Brothers movie

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
that has ever been made,

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
but because the world was older then,

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
like the rules are different about,

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
who's telling you what,

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
about whether or not you're being successful,

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
whether or not your movie succeeded.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
And the disparity between,

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
when you're supposed to celebrate,

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
remember the Sony leaks came out,

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
and it was just like,

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
one of the most delightful parts of the Sony leaks

54:19.000 --> 54:22.000
was Channing Tatum's email to everybody at Sony

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
going, yeah, bitches, we did it!

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
Like, because they just made,

54:27.000 --> 54:30.000
like, $740 billion in an hour,

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
I don't even know which movie it was,

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Godzilla vs. Men in Black or whatever,

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
I don't know.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
It doesn't matter,

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
but Channing Tatum was involved,

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
and he was like, yeah, bitches!

54:40.000 --> 54:43.000
He was using C's and exclamation points.

54:43.000 --> 54:46.000
There's gotta be a high-five emoticon.

54:46.000 --> 54:49.000
But it really has nothing to do with whether or not

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
I'm not saying whatever he was talking about

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
was a bad movie.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
I'm saying it was completely disconnected

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
from whether it was a good or bad movie.

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
And because, like, Jeff is saying,

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
oh, that must have been a great time to be alive

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
all these comedy movies.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
I'm gonna assume, God, no.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
I'm assuming that just meant that

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
more hilarious people were being told

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
more times per minute,

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
you really fucked up.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
I can't believe you were in that piece of shit.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
Be in it!

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
It was a piece of shit.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
I never said that.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Why would I do that?

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
I work for Mike Ovitz, God damn it.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
I was recently...

55:23.000 --> 55:27.000
I just did Coke off of the small world ride.

55:27.000 --> 55:35.000
I was in a talking horse movie

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
that put me in comedy jail.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Ended my career.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
Comedy jail.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
And I look at the...

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
I was just recently moving,

55:43.000 --> 55:46.000
I found the script and I scribbled on it

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
and sent it back to my manager.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
I go, why would I do this?

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
And then he had written a dollar sign on it.

55:53.000 --> 55:58.000
I'm shameful telling this.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Well, they're the opposite of therapists.

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
The agents tell you that you should worry about

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
everything and money matters.

56:05.000 --> 56:09.000
And then you go to therapy and it's like, no.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
It's true.

56:11.000 --> 56:16.000
I just make my movies so far out of the system.

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
I love working on community.

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
I love working on people's shows that I respect

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
and have fun and that's great.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
And then I go make these movies.

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
And I don't mean to throw my agent under the bus.

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
I'm not going to be specific.

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
One of my agents, that way I can get him off the hook.

56:33.000 --> 56:38.000
But he called me up and he says,

56:38.000 --> 56:42.000
hey, Sundance.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
I go, yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
You made another movie.

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
That's an actual quote.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
I was like...

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
I feel like...

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
He wasn't along for the ride?

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
No.

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
I just go do him and then let them catch up.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
Wow.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
I don't know.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
What's your agency?

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Is that a personal question?

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Yeah.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
I was just wondering if you're a UTA or not.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
But I was a...

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
I didn't...

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
I think it was an age thing.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
And I think I regarded as like...

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Oh, I guess I made it.

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
I'm like a character in a movie about people that make things

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
because I had a meeting at my agency

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
and I went to the wrong building.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
They had moved four years ago.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
Because I don't...

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
I'm an autopilot.

57:34.000 --> 57:37.000
And somebody goes, oh, what's that dumb fuck doing?

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
If they want to be in business with a dumb fuck, they...

57:39.000 --> 57:43.000
Do they ever send you things for you to...

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
You know what I mean? That you didn't create?

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
Yeah.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
I mean, especially now that I'm trying to do this studio thing,

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
you know, I'm trying to become a suit

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
because I'm a fucking horrible, self-destructive person.

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
Oh, okay.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
And really insecure.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
But I'm trying to...

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
Because I get scripts which is new for me.

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
And then I should just read my emails.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
It was just, this is a very well-written script

58:04.000 --> 58:08.000
and I hate everyone who wrote it.

58:08.000 --> 58:14.000
If I ever see them, I'm going to punch them all in the throat.

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
It's a pass.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
And then I wrote PS.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
If this email does get hacked by the North Koreans,

58:19.000 --> 58:22.000
I'm a really big fan of their irreverent brand of humor.

58:22.000 --> 58:26.000
And I wish them more continued success.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Yeah, I mean, I think at a certain point...

58:28.000 --> 58:32.000
Because I think...

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
It's that movie archetype of like,

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
your agent should just have the pork pie hat

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
and he's just like the really old guy

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
that's just like, you can't leave him now.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
And he's just like, I tell him when they call you,

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
you know the Bobcat deal?

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
The Bobcat deal is a million per script.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
You're just kind of like, well,

58:49.000 --> 58:53.000
at a certain point, you're just out there,

58:53.000 --> 58:56.000
like a log floating on a lake.

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
Like, you know, the importance of representation

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
becomes slightly diminished.

59:01.000 --> 59:04.000
Well, it certainly doesn't help

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
in the types of movies I'm trying to make, you know?

59:07.000 --> 59:10.000
So I just don't waste their time with that stuff.

59:10.000 --> 59:11.000
Right.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
Because then they...

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
I don't resent them.

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
They'll probably try to talk you out of it.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Hey, Bob, are you still doing the kinks thing

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
or can we talk about that?

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
Yeah, I mean, that's my dream project,

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
is that I wrote a screenplay

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
based on School Boys and the Scraze

59:22.000 --> 59:25.000
and Ray Davis has been very involved and encouraging.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
That's one I hope you make.

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
I hope so too.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Well, you know, it's frustrating

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
because it's, you know,

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
dudes in a high school basically singing.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
It seems like that formula's worked before.

59:38.000 --> 59:42.000
I don't know why people are really so skittish around it,

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
but I don't know.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
It's not like I'm coming to them with, you know...

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
What's your relationship?

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
It's like, hey, did he do a musical?

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
No, but he did that baby rape doc

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
and he did a Bigfoot movie.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
He's your man.

59:55.000 --> 59:58.000
So of course you should do a musical,

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
but I don't know what's going to go next.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
I also wrote this Gay Billy Jack movie, which is...

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Gay Billy Jack?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Well, he's not like, yeah.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
I just watched Billy Jack again a couple of days ago,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
like two days ago, cry to the end,

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
because when Tin Soul just starts playing the end of that...

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
You have to turn to Billy Jack.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Well, the first one.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Yeah.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Well, there's Born Losers.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
I'm a big Billy Jack fan.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.000
If you guys have not seen Billy Jack, it's all that's great

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
about the 70s.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
But he kicks ass.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
He kicks ass.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
It's actually politics, but really violent.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
It's about civil rights,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
and it's about anti-establishmentism,

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Arianism, and not Arianism.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
That's not about Arianism.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Yeah, you lost me.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
But anti-establishmism, Arianism,

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
and a little bit of Naziism.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000
In the 70s, there had to be kung fu and karate,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
at all times.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
It's so fucking good.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
It's progressive politics with violence.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
It's such a beautiful mixture, but...

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I'm really proud of Jeff for resisting the urge,

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
because what he really wants to do,

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
because I know he knows it by heart,

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
he wants to do the Billy Jack.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
The speech.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
When I see what you do.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
You know, Bernard.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
You know Bernard.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.000
When Jill and the kids up at the school tell me

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
not to be violent and to be non-violent,

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I try.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
I really try.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I'll do the whole thing.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
I'm not gonna fucking do it.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
No, keep going.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Come on, just do it.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
No, no, no.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Come on.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
That's just the tip.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Do it.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
You can't stop now.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Bobcat, you know what I'm talking about?

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
The ice cream shop.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Of course.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Of course.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
But when I see...

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
When I see what you did.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000
When I see this flower.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
You know what we call her back at the...

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
We call her God's little gift of sunshine.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000
And when I see this boy so degraded,

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
and when I think of a number of years,

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
and he's gonna have to live,

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
with his memory,

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000
this itty-ottic moment of yours,

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I just go, BASIC!

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Yeah.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Now, so, I'm not Jeff's agent,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
and he's not auditioning for Gay Billy Jack,

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
but...

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Yeah.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
So...

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Please, so...

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Everybody, you took that fucking scene

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
and stuck it.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000
So, my ex-wife, I said to her,

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
I was like,

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Dude, I can't do this anymore.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000
I'm so tired of being broke.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
I'm gonna write a genre picture.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Please.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
And I go,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I love Billy Jack.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I'm gonna write a genre picture.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I'm gonna write a Billy Jack movie.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
So, I'm down there writing.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
And she goes,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
How's it going?

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
I go,

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
I'm good.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
I'm good.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
She goes,

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
How long you in?

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
I go,

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
I'm gay now.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000
And she goes,

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000
So, we're just gonna keep renting, huh?

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Go ahead and hate your name.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Go ahead and cheat a fag.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
That's what,

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
that's the whole thing.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Like, he goes into this town,

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
he's trying to drink his whiskey,

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
and someone calls him a fag,

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
and he's gonna,

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000
he says,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I'm gonna have to ask you to stop using that word.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Yes.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
And he goes,

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
He's like,

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
What are you gonna do about it?

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Fag, he goes,

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Well, I'm gonna dislocate his shoulder.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
I'm gonna fracture his kneecap.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
I'm gonna shatter,

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
No, and he goes,

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Oh, then he says,

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
I fucked up.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
And he goes,

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000
And I'm gonna shatter your windpipe.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
And you wanna know something?

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
It's not a goddamn thing to do.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
It's not a goddamn thing you do about it.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
And then,

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
And then,

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
In the script it says,

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
It's just,

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
It's the simplest direction I've ever written.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
It just says,

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
And he does.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
So then,

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
So then he walks back over to the bartender,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
And he finally finishes his whiskey,

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
And he throws it down.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
He says,

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Is there a decent place for a man to stay in this town?

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000
And then it,

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
It's smash cuts to him,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Waking up in bed with the bartender.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000
But,

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
But,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
I gotta say,

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
This scene sounds funny.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Make this movie.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
But,

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Jeff.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
But,

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
If I'm not the fucking Billy Jack.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
But I have to say,

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
I know this sounds like it's a joke,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
But you know,

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
I really do kind of explore,

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
You know,

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
All this stuff about,

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
What's it like being a gay man,

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
And what defines,

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
You know,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Sexuality,

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
And,

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Yeah, I know.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
What the fuck is wrong with me?

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000
I'm so uncommercial.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I have no idea.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Well, yeah,

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
I don't think you have to tell you.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Yeah,

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
I would,

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
I would assume when you told me that,

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Like,

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Yeah,

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
That you weren't like,

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000
This is hilarious.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
These faggots are gonna hate this.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Right,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Right,

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Exactly.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I'm finally letting them have it,

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
See?

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Yeah,

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
In a studio picture,

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
It would have been like,

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Hello?

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
It's like a boat trip.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Boat trip is like a god damn fucking psychedelic,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Boat trip is a fucking atom bomb.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Via Huasca spirit vision.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Boat trip is one of the most amazing,

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
I don't know.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
If you've not seen boat trip,

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Cuba Gooding Jr.,

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
And a series of other culprits,

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Make a movie.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000
It's two guys,

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Somehow,

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
I think,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
I don't know how you feel about it.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I think what happened is,

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Somebody was getting fired,

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
At one of the oldest agencies in the world,

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000
And their fingers locked on their filing cabinet,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Which chipped over,

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
So there was finally the script visible underneath it,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
And then the cleaning lady at the,

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Or cleaning man,

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
At the agency,

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Or you know,

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Cleaning person,

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
And they were like,

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Nice save,

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
They put it on top of the pile,

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
It was on the bottom,

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
It was like a Brazil thing,

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
And the movie got green lit,

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
That's a boat trip.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Are you sure this is the movie

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
That was supposed to be green lit?

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Two guys,

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
That is on the top of the desk.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
They go on a boat,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
And then they find out the first,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
It's a gay boat,

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
We're on a gay boat,

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
We're on a gay boat.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
And then they have to pretend to be gay,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Or they're gonna kick off the boat,

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
And you know,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
The gay guys get to look at six tits if they want,

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Because six don't care if gay guys look at their tits.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Those aren't some real high stakes.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
The movie is like,

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
The movie includes Cuba Gooding Jr.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Coming out of a porthole,

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Into the open air,

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.000
And his cum splatters on someone's face.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
He had won an Oscar

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
30 seconds before this movie was made.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
And then there were like nine movies,

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Like Cuba Gooding Jr.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
And then had nine movies with talking dogs,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
And gay jokes in them.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
What does the cum land on?

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000
The cum goes out the porthole?

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
The cum just lands on a person.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
And then you go like,

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Oh, what about that?

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Crazy summer, that was a chili dog.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
That's right.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
And it landed on my friend Tony V.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
And his famous line was,

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
You kids?

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Yeah, that's right.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Tony V.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Here's one of the weirdest things

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
To look for in boat trip

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
When you rent it tonight, kids.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I'd like to mention that all my movies

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Are available on digital platforms.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
You don't necessarily have to watch boat trips.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
But you'll only be encouraging him.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
He's a documentary filmmaker now.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Watch him after boat trip.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Watch boat trip first.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Don't encourage his phase of like,

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
I hate America.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I'm gonna tour.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
I hate America.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
I'm gonna go to France.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000
There's a scene in boat trip

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Where Cuba Gooding Jr.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Is in love with the woman who thinks that he's gay

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Because that's what he has had to do

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
To survive on the boat.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000
The gay man.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Which affords him the ironic chance

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
To be in close quarters with her.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
She's confiding with him about her single life

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
And how she wishes she could find a man.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000
And if he just keeps lisping and enough

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Then he gets to be with her.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
And so it's very uncomfortable for him.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000
And at one point, the topic of conversation

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Somehow comes to, it either comes to

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
How are you supposed to eat a banana

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Or how are you supposed to suck a dick.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
But in any case, she picks up a banana,

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Peels the banana to show him how she sucks

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Dick.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000
And so the joke is that he's going like

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Ha, ha, I can't believe it.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Oh, she's sucking a banana dick in front of me.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000
The crazy thing, the crazy thing about it

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
If you watch the movie in high def

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Like, you can see his credibility

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Leave the back of his head.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Of her licking the tip of the banana

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
It's unmistakable.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
The prop master for some reason

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Has like, well not for some reason

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
For some, I mean there's some disconnect

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Between industry and government

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
And then the society.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Like the prop master has taken like a tool

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:46.000
And shaped like a visible penis head

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Into the tip of the banana.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000
And I love all prop masters that have ever worked with me

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
You're the fucking best, you're wizards

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000
You collaborate well, I have respect for your craft

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
But this is exactly the kind of thing that, you know

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
That you gotta step on.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
If you were to take a late lunch

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
You might find out that someone was like

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Yeah, well then it says in the script

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000
It's like a dick, so I, what do I do?

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
I fucking, I'm gonna get a raise today

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I'm gonna make it like a dick

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
And then you go like, why are you making a banana

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Like a dick that makes no sense

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000
That's just, that's just, that's just so, that's just so sense

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
But everyone on the set must have been like

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
It looks like a dick.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Johnny, Johnny, get back to the set

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
We're making a hit

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000
The banana, the banana looks like a dick

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Get back here

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:44.000
And universal and Fox and Roobert Murdock

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000
She's like looking and it looks like a dick

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.760
It looks like a dick that carved a dick out of a banana.

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:51.200
It makes no, it's so insane.

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:55.840
Do you think somebody just looked at the banana and was like,

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:57.760
I don't know if this reads like a dick.

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:01.760
It doesn't, it doesn't, it could have just been one.

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:02.960
Do you think it was a studio note?

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:05.520
I don't know, it's like, I eat bananas like that

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:06.440
and I'm not born to eat.

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.400
Can we make the, can we make the, can she be,

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:11.400
I feel like the banana doesn't read as a cock.

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:12.240
Can I feel like me?

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:13.720
Can she be holding some Kiwis?

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:17.080
Yeah, it's the same guy who kept saying,

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:19.720
I'm telling you this should be called gay boat trip.

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:23.880
I don't, I don't know why you're, you're PCing the title.

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.320
It should be called gay boat trip.

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:29.080
We did, we did, we did tests on the title.

01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:30.400
People don't care about boats.

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:31.520
We said gay boat trip.

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.120
They know the movie we're talking about.

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:37.560
It's Kuba Gooding Jr. and Carlos, Carlos, who is it?

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:38.640
Carlos?

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:41.960
No, no, no, no, no, it was Horatio Sands.

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:45.520
Horatio Sands, whom we love and adore.

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:47.920
I don't think everybody has to go home and watch it.

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:51.080
They already did.

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:54.560
Have you gone off on a boat trip ramp before?

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:56.800
No, I don't think so.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.400
It's possible, it's possible.

01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.000
I mean, I'm not busting your chops.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.240
I didn't know if that was like what frost is your cake.

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.080
You know what I mean?

01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:07.560
Like, I guess I, I see that boat trip one more time.

01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:08.640
No, I mean, that's just, I mean.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.200
I'm gonna come so hard.

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:13.560
I, what frost, what frost to my cake is inscrutability.

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.040
Like, I, like, shit that, like, when you look into it,

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.480
you can't find even the, even the most course,

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:22.120
crass, cynical explanation for it.

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:22.960
Yeah.

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:23.800
Like, we used to have a-

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.640
But I think movies like that make it, like, you know,

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:28.920
like I did Sleeping Dogs Lie, it was called Stay Originally,

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:32.280
but it's a rom-com, not a rom-com,

01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:34.200
it's kind of a little bit more my stab at trying

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.160
to do a Woody Allen movie, but it,

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:39.200
with a tiny bit of bestiality in it.

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.480
Just a little bit of bestiality.

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:41.400
Just a hint?

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.240
Yeah.

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:44.080
Just a whisper of bestiality.

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:44.920
It's a back story.

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:45.760
It's just so.

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.600
But I think when people-

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:47.440
It's just so.

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.600
It's just so.

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:51.280
But I think when people hear about it,

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.840
they think that's what they're gonna see, you know,

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:55.760
an actual shot of her spitting dog semen out

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:56.960
and all this stuff, you know,

01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:00.120
and the joke isn't like making fun of her character,

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:03.760
it's actually about, you know, how there's things

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:06.240
in our past that other people can't get past,

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:08.240
and she learns in that movie at the end,

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.960
she says, you know, I learned it's the living up

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:11.680
to the lies that we tell about ourselves

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:13.160
that make us better people.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.480
Yeah.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:16.960
By the way, they made the same movie with an avalanche,

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:19.560
and everyone's like, now I accept it.

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:20.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:25.640
The cat, in your movie, she fucks a dog, but yeah.

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:28.400
But it's all off camera, and it's,

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:30.360
I remember getting this note.

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:31.600
Oh, the avalanche never kills him.

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:36.120
I gotta know that was, could she just jerk the dog off?

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:41.120
Yeah, I swear to God, I was like, what the fuck?

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.200
Which is actually weirder, right?

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:47.040
Yeah.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:49.560
Does anyone be like looking at the dog, you know, yeah.

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:54.560
Like why would you, yeah, you're invested in the,

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:57.320
the dog doesn't need that, like that's just about.

01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:59.760
Yeah, you know, she says it's like something weird,

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.680
you know, that's like touching a toaster that,

01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:03.440
you know, is hot, it was, you know,

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:06.040
she's not in the beastiality, it was just this weird thing.

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:07.360
It was about something that happened

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:08.200
in the course of life.

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:09.920
Yeah, and I needed something that people couldn't get past.

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:12.000
Jerking off a dog can only happen

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.440
as the result of planning.

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:14.840
Plus, if you told somebody else,

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:16.360
just like, you know, once I jerked off a dog,

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:18.280
you go, yeah, that's fucking weird.

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:20.120
You wouldn't.

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:24.640
40% of the people do, I did too, in a barn, on a bed.

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:26.680
That's what it is, so, and that, by the way,

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:28.920
when that movie came out, oh my God,

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:30.360
people would be like that, you know,

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:31.800
the point of that movie was, you know,

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:37.040
it's okay to lie, and because sometimes people

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:39.480
tell the truth, and they're not being kind,

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:42.200
and, but man, as soon as that movie,

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.960
like the lights go up, people go, I'll tell you what,

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:47.840
I had a, whoa, whoa, whoa, people just started telling me

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:53.960
they're beastiality stories, and I don't if you've ever

01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:58.720
felt a lamb's mouth, I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa,

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:01.320
that's not what the movie was about.

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.560
I'll tell you one more story about this movie,

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:07.040
my daughter was 18 or 19, and the movie starts,

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.920
and that's right out of the gate, that scene happens,

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:11.480
and there's this woman, is that Sundance,

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:15.280
and people, you know, and it's not me self-loathing,

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:17.040
everything sells out at Sundance,

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:19.840
so I knew I was like the third or fourth choice,

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.520
you know what I mean, it's like, hey, you know,

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:24.200
it's an Artie Farty movie, I got a Bobcat Goldthwait

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:25.240
movie ticket, you want it, you know,

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:27.080
so it was packed, I was glad people were there,

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:28.800
but they did not know what they're gonna get,

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:31.600
so this scene starts, and this woman's like four rows

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.880
behind us, and she's like, she's gonna leave,

01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:35.760
and she's gathering up her coat and stuff,

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:38.200
and her friend talks her into staying,

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:40.880
and about 50 minutes into the movie,

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:43.600
that same woman was crying watching the movie,

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:45.920
and my daughter goes, look at your friend now,

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:48.120
and I look, and my daughter goes, yeah, you cry, bitch,

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:48.960
you cry.

01:14:48.960 --> 01:15:01.560
For real? Oh my God, now I'm terrified.

01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:02.920
Jeff knows, Jeff knows.

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:04.120
Well, I'm terrified of children now,

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:06.120
because if my child makes me that proud,

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:08.360
I would be like, but can you marry your daughter?

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:12.200
Well, you know what, Bob, your relationship

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:14.080
with your daughter is amazing,

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:15.840
and it occurs, I've never met your daughter,

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:18.400
but you seem to have a great relationship with yours too.

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:21.480
I have one of those.

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:23.960
Bob's daughter, Tasha, she loves you,

01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:27.520
and she's your best friend, and she, like...

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:30.080
But, and the queen of the ball busting,

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:33.400
like at Sundance this year, she's like,

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:36.920
Dad, I have to come over here, and I go, what?

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:41.440
She goes, I got you this, and it means a lot to me,

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:45.960
and I need you to wear this, and it was a police academy

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:53.080
too, crew jacket, and I fucking wore it.

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.240
She knew you, she knows you're not in the first one,

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:57.720
that's sweet. That's smart, yeah.

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.920
That's a good daughter. Yeah, yeah, so, yeah,

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.520
so that's why I wore it in the premiere

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:04.200
of my series debut as a documentary.

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:07.040
Tasha's so cool, and it's so cool to see like a father that,

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:10.040
like, like, I grew up in Los Angeles,

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:13.680
where most of my friends, they don't have a great relationship

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:15.720
with their parents, or they hate their brother,

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:17.360
or they hate their sister, and there's not a lot

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.520
of great stories of families that love each other.

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:22.120
There are plenty, but there's also lots that don't.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:26.000
It's very cool to see, like, Tasha worships you,

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.920
and also treats you like a buddy,

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:31.280
because I think you treat her like a buddy,

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:33.560
and like, that's a very rare thing, and Curtis, like...

01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:34.680
Yeah, it's the same, it's the same,

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:36.440
I feel like you have the same relationship with her,

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:37.920
although I don't know her.

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:38.960
It's always, but...

01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:40.440
Well, you have to take my word for it then.

01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:43.040
I will, but I mean, I think we take your word

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:45.040
for everything because you deal in sincerity,

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:47.280
and I don't think you would ever dissemble

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.320
about something like that.

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:49.160
No.

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:53.560
That's everything that we like about you, too,

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:56.840
as individuals, the fact that you have a great relationship

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:59.640
with your daughter is really remarkable.

01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:03.200
Well, you know, I have to tell you, when I met Bob,

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:09.120
he was the first actor I think I'd worked with

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:13.760
in Hollywood, who's politics,

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:17.440
and particularly gender politics mirrored mine.

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.520
I thought that was so cool,

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:21.480
because there were not many of us.

01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:22.320
Just two of you, eight and women.

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:23.640
Yeah, exactly.

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:28.480
No, and not, because this is like one of our first movies.

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:31.720
It's like, you know what, this movie is less Jimmy Moore.

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:33.240
I just...

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:34.760
I said Moore and Moore.

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:42.120
No, and I met you, and I just assumed,

01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:44.200
oh, everybody in Hollywood's chill.

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.440
Yeah, because that was one of my first movies.

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:48.720
Yeah, I was quite naive about the thing.

01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:51.480
But so we all know each other,

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:54.080
because Eric Idle and his wife, Tanya,

01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.400
and they have a daughter, Lily,

01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:59.240
and my daughter grew up with Lily Idle as a friend.

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:04.240
So I was on Arsenio Hall when he got fired,

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:09.280
and so I walked out and I sprayed paint

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:11.920
and Paramount sucks on the backdrop of the set,

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:14.840
and then I took the monitor,

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:17.440
which cost three grand I found out later on,

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:20.600
and smashed it and put my feet through it

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:21.680
with my Doc Martins.

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:22.960
It was totally premeditated,

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:24.840
because I was like, my Chuck Taylor's are gonna...

01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:25.680
Yeah.

01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:27.840
Yeah, I need to wear my fucking steel-toed docks.

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:28.680
Guess what fucking steel-toed?

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:29.680
Because the monitor's getting fucked up.

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:30.520
12 holes.

01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:31.360
12 holes?

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:32.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, when I'm a baby.

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:33.400
So...

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:38.120
So, you know, if we were making the movie,

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:39.880
it's the guy getting ready for war, you know?

01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:41.600
I mean, what he needs, you know, the weaponry,

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:43.000
you know, so I got my Doc Martins,

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000
I'm ready to go smash up the Arsenio Hall show,

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.040
and I throw the mattresses into the audience, and...

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:51.320
Why were there mattresses?

01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:54.520
The cushions from the couch,

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.600
and then the producers, like, say, get him,

01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:59.160
and Arsenio tackles me,

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:00.480
and as we're going to a commercial,

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:02.720
he whispers in my ear, he goes, thank you.

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:09.720
And so, I leave the show acting like no big deal,

01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:12.600
and I'm now coloring with my daughter,

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.240
and she's eight, and we're coloring.

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:15.080
Oh, my God.

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:16.360
And then the news comes on, it goes,

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:19.640
comedian goes berserk on the Arsenio Hall show.

01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:22.440
And Tasha goes, ugh.

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:24.280
I go, what?

01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:25.240
She goes, sometimes you act like

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:26.720
you don't have a brain in your head.

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:27.560
Ah!

01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:31.720
And I go, but it was just a bit.

01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:33.000
It's just comedy.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.520
She goes, if it was comedy, it wouldn't be on the news.

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:37.080
Ah!

01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:39.200
And then she goes, then she goes,

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:41.440
Lily's dad's not on the news.

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:42.280
Ah!

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:43.120
Ah!

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:43.960
Ah!

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:44.800
Ah!

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:45.800
Eight years old?

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:46.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:49.200
Because Tasha, Tasha is smarter than all of us, right?

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:50.040
Yeah, yeah.

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:51.000
She totally is.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.280
I like that she was doing the math.

01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:55.200
She goes, whoa, hey, no, her dad's in dresses.

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:57.920
But I used to always, ever since high school,

01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:00.640
I used to wear dresses, you know, like skirts,

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:03.640
and it wasn't, it was not, and I didn't do it for camp,

01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:05.640
it was my way of saying, you know,

01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:07.840
if you go to a football part and you show up

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:09.960
in some smart looking coolot,

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:13.800
it fucks up the football team harder than anything, you know.

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.280
I like that you had smart coolots.

01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:16.520
I had very smart.

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:18.040
So I was always like wearing skirts and stuff,

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.280
and when Tasha was little, I'd always be in a skirt,

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:22.920
and then one day I woke her up for school,

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:25.160
and she goes, dad, I've never seen that sweater.

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:26.040
And she goes, yeah, she goes,

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:28.120
that would go so well with your brown skirt.

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:28.960
Ah!

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:29.800
Ah!

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:30.640
Ah!

01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:33.440
And I was like, yeah, you're right, you know.

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:36.400
Can we do a show where we bring Tasha and you out?

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.480
I wonder if she would do it.

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.320
That's pretty funny.

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:40.000
She must because she's fucking groovy.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:40.840
Yeah.

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:41.680
Well, now that's all built up.

01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:42.520
I don't know.

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:44.120
If she's really smart, she'll stay away, right?

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:44.960
Yeah.

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:45.800
Yeah.

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:47.360
I mean, she sounds like the kind of person

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.320
that would be like, no, fuck that.

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:50.400
Curtis, how's your daughter doing?

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:51.880
She's in Europe still?

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:53.400
Yeah, she's in London, yeah.

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:57.520
She just produced her first night of music

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.400
at Shacklewell Arms.

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.360
Three bads.

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:05.560
She is now going places.

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:06.520
That's so cool.

01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:07.640
19.

01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:10.120
I wish I had a daughter that was a genius.

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:11.040
That would be so cool.

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:11.920
I know.

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:12.480
It's fun.

01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:12.960
You may.

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:19.120
You mean I might already?

01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:21.000
You may.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.720
You're a randy little goat.

01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:28.720
That tour in Nam we did, man.

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:30.960
It's not like we were being careful about anything

01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:33.960
but protecting democracy.

01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:34.760
Let me rewrite that.

01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:36.080
Let me rewrite that.

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:40.440
It's not like we were protecting anything but democracy.

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:41.880
Obviously less of a laugh, but you've

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:43.080
spliced it together in a little.

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:46.560
It's not important.

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:47.960
I'm not.

01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:53.080
I mean, in the realm of male comedians especially,

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:57.840
the amount of misogyny, there's so much women

01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:59.400
hating in male comics.

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:01.400
It's kind of axiomatic.

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:07.440
It's very cool and very respectable that there's

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:09.920
two guys that you guys have been doing comedy for so long

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:14.400
and you have a female daughter that you look up to and like.

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.520
That takes a lot of balls to have a female daughter.

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.600
I think if we just have a daughter,

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:26.720
nope, she's going to be a female daughter.

01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:27.640
You know what I'm fucking saying.

01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:29.320
But thank you.

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:32.440
It's there's so much misogyny.

01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:36.520
Also in comedians, misanthropy, like across the board,

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:38.840
the fact that you look up to the women in your life

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:40.320
makes me very, very happy.

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.160
And I've met Tasha.

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:46.120
And Tasha couldn't be cooler and couldn't love you more.

01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:49.520
She speaks of you so highly, Bob, that it's like,

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:51.320
I think she does it to your face too.

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:53.080
I don't think it's a secret.

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:55.760
She tells people that she barely knows like me

01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:58.440
that how much she looks up to you and worships you.

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:02.520
But also she gives you shit, she's just fucking cool

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:05.800
because she really is like, she's high status.

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:08.880
She's fucking, yeah, like, I mean, yeah, we always got,

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:13.600
pet name is jerk, but she loves to, you know,

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.400
like if I'm in a mall, she'll go, Bobcat, Bobcat,

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:22.080
Gulfway, and shit chills.

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:26.720
So I thought the story once, Tony V was at the Riviera,

01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:30.000
he was a comedian buddy of mine, and it was my birthday,

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.800
and Robin was playing the MGM.

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:35.600
And we were all hanging out that weekend.

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:37.240
And I hadn't been on stage in five years

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:38.680
because I'd been directing the Kimmel Show

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.320
and doing other stuff.

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:42.760
And Tony's having a, you know, wasn't the greatest crowd.

01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:44.600
And I go, Tony, bring me up.

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:45.560
And he's like, really?

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:47.680
I go, yeah, and I went up and I started performing.

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:49.440
And my daughter's like, do the voice.

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:54.960
And fucking relentless.

01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:57.720
And then Robin was like, bring me up, you know?

01:23:57.720 --> 01:23:58.560
And I was like, all right.

01:23:58.560 --> 01:23:59.800
And then he came up.

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:02.360
It was just, yeah, it was just beautiful.

01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:04.120
And Tony, we had so much fun.

01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:07.000
I remember we were, this is not that long ago.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.120
And you would be amazed how many people would be like,

01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:13.360
you know, more to the, you know, I mean, this isn't that long.

01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:15.320
Yeah, so we're playing Blackjack.

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:16.360
And Tony's a really big guy.

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:19.280
And this guy goes, hey, Mark, where's Mindy?

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:26.840
And Tony goes, she's over at Fuck Off and asked you to join her.

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:28.480
I remember too, it was just so many.

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:33.040
It was age-appropriate women would go nuts for Robin.

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:37.680
Like, we had to like, it, that's a weird way

01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:39.680
to back into that story.

01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:42.920
No, I just never seen like these Cougars,

01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:44.880
Savard Youth Tigers, they were going mental.

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:47.360
They were like, it was like the Beatles,

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:49.520
but these women were menopausal.

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:51.480
They were like chasing him.

01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:53.200
It's a harder, it's a harder get.

01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:55.920
It's, it's, it's, it's a more respectable, like.

01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:57.720
And it's funny you say that I'm not sexist.

01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:00.600
These menopausal women that were age-appropriate,

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:01.600
but that's really what happened.

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:03.440
I'm not saying you weren't, I'm saying your daughter's not.

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:05.760
Yeah, and I was like, I was like, dude,

01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:07.920
you could pull so much steel wool if you wanted to.

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:15.720
See, I'm not sexist.

01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:17.760
I just wanted to crush any good will

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:19.480
that you had developed for me.

01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:20.760
Steel wool.

01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:23.760
That hurts, steel wool hurts.

01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:29.040
But it gets, it polishes you really clean.

01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:31.760
You know, I mentioned that earlier though.

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:34.680
The last time he and I went on stage was at your show.

01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:37.440
And I remember he was just here at the, at Mount,

01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:38.440
and he goes, what are you doing?

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:39.840
I go, I'm about to do a podcast.

01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:40.800
So he just stayed.

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:41.280
Yeah.

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:43.360
And I was like, I go, and I was like, you want to go up?

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:44.280
He's like, no, I don't want to go up.

01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:45.680
I was like, you don't have to go up.

01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:49.160
And then I remember him just looking like, he's like,

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.960
put me in coach, and he came out.

01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:53.680
Yeah, he was sitting where Curtis is sitting.

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:55.960
He was wearing his little windbreaker, and he was,

01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:58.520
I never, he was so shy.

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:01.720
And so he came out here, and you did the bit, Dan,

01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:04.120
where you're like, fuck these people don't deserve us.

01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:05.680
Like Bobcat goes away, and you came out,

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:07.440
and you told Bobcat to fuck off.

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:10.080
And then you go, Robin Williams, and Robin came out.

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:12.640
And I'm sitting here, so I don't know that that's a joke.

01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:14.000
I didn't see Robin.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.640
And Robin came out and gave me like a niggie and like a headlock.

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:19.200
Because I just met him at Eric's house like two nights

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:22.600
before, where we sang songs like when you go to Eric's house,

01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:23.920
like you sing.

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:26.920
And when he left the stage, he hugged me.

01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:28.160
And I held him.

01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:30.280
And I said, thank you for making everyone think

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:31.760
that you and I are great friends.

01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:32.760
No.

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:37.040
Well, I have a good story about, and my act

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:39.080
is a shaggy dog joke that I tell.

01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:41.240
But it's a true story, and I won't go into the whole story.

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:42.520
I'll try to do a truncated version.

01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:43.480
Tell the whole thing.

01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:45.280
All right.

01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:47.000
I don't know if you have the airplane story.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:47.880
It is a true story.

01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:51.680
I was on a flight going from Los Angeles to New York

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:54.080
in midway through the engine blew up.

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:55.360
And it was terrifying.

01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:57.600
It was really, and I've had enough turbulence and stuff.

01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:01.360
The plane just suddenly was just dumping.

01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:03.920
And it was like G-Force kind of stuff.

01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:05.360
It was really scary.

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:06.600
People were screaming.

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:08.200
I was like, staying calm.

01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:09.520
Check out the flight attendants.

01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:11.360
Flight attendants are looking out the window,

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:13.760
and they're looking around sobbing, sobbing flight

01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:16.440
attendants.

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:17.520
I'm not exaggerating.

01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:19.000
And they're holding each other's hands.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.360
I always thought you were a professional camera.

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:27.800
And I've got to say, I was completely out of my body.

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:28.960
And I'm like, all right.

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:32.240
And the pilot's like, hello, ladies and gentlemen.

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:33.000
This is your pilot.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.720
There's no reason to be alarmed.

01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:37.560
The placating tone of his voice.

01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:42.840
This one's for the black box, on the black box alone.

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:45.680
I just want to say, they told me in the event.

01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:47.120
This isn't a suicide.

01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.400
My insurance is valid.

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:50.880
Everything.

01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:55.000
And I am a sound body and mind.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.760
Well, we got a, Demetri Martin was on the flight.

01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:59.440
And we were just, we were dying.

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:00.240
Demetri Martin.

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:01.280
Because we're sitting there.

01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:04.760
And Demetri's looking out the window going, if a landscape is,

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:09.120
well, is a horizon, then a horizon forms a letter H.

01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:12.000
But he says, no, we both, after we survived this,

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.360
we both kept going, there's no reason to be alarmed.

01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:16.760
Because the guy kept saying that every time.

01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:17.400
He'll be afraid.

01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:18.800
There's no reason to be alarmed.

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:21.080
So, and I'm like, this is the time to,

01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:22.160
that's not comforting.

01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:24.360
If the guy was like going, holy fuck.

01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:25.880
I go, oh, this guy's in it.

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:27.040
He's in it.

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:31.920
Or if he said like, OK, this is fucked up for me too.

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:33.160
But I got this.

01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:36.040
Yeah, or look, I'm going to try some shit.

01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:39.520
I learned in pilot school.

01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:40.920
I'm not making any promises.

01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:43.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:47.200
Everybody get up, move to the left of the plane.

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:49.080
I'm going to freestyle.

01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:54.120
OK, or if he said, OK, here's the final refinement on that.

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:57.760
He goes, the bad news is all bets are off.

01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:00.920
In terms of like, FAA and everything.

01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:03.600
The good news is that means I get to do whatever

01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:04.840
the fuck I want.

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:09.000
And ladies and gentlemen, I'm fucking good.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.720
Or if he said, or if he's just like, smoke.

01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:15.000
Go ahead and smoke, yeah.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.920
Smoke him if you fucking got him.

01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:19.080
Yeah, kiss, light it up.

01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:19.960
Kiss a stranger.

01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:20.960
Rub him out in your seat.

01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:22.560
Fuck it, everybody.

01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:23.920
How's anybody's doing?

01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:26.000
Turn to your neighbor and just go down.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.800
So if you're an atheist and you've ever fantasized

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:32.880
about throwing your baby like a football,

01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:34.960
now would be the time to do it.

01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:36.040
No one will ever know.

01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:37.000
No reason to be alarmed.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:41.520
You got a 15 second window to spike that baby and do this.

01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:46.160
So think about all the times it kept you up at 3 AM.

01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:50.320
All I can say is this is 100% true.

01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:52.800
Other people on the flight was a good portion

01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:55.320
of the United States Special Olympics team.

01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:59.400
This is a relax, just let me finish the story.

01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:00.880
I'm not.

01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:03.680
It was 45 men and women in red, white, and blue running suits

01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:04.200
with medals.

01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:06.040
So if it wasn't the Special Olympics team,

01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:09.760
it was a really big hip hop group with Down syndrome.

01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:15.120
So this isn't one of the titles.

01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:16.960
That's the title of this episode, by the way.

01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:26.560
So the plane's creaning towards the earth.

01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:29.680
And I'm thinking, oh, I'm dying.

01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:31.040
And I thought of Tasha.

01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:32.880
And I thought of my friends.

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:35.840
And then Claire is about, the guy's back on.

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:38.120
He's like, there's no reason to be alarmed.

01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:39.880
Because he's like, oh, that was the other,

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:41.200
the first announcement was, we're

01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:45.360
going to land in Cleveland in two to two and a half minutes.

01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:48.160
Serious.

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:50.600
Was that the scheduled stop or is he just saying, no, no,

01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:52.880
we're going to do that.

01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.640
It's like a Zuckerbrothers movie.

01:30:54.640 --> 01:31:00.600
He's like, OK, the gate is 3H, 4H, 5H, 6H.

01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:03.000
Cleveland, Cleveland.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.920
No, so we're dumping the plane at Cleveland.

01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:09.080
And then he goes, when we land, the runway

01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:13.000
will be covered entirely in foam.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.400
I swear to God, at the very end of the runway

01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:18.080
will be a fire truck.

01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:22.920
And I'm sitting there, and I'm like, this is it.

01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:26.760
And Claire's about, and Dimitri can back this up,

01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:30.080
Claire's about a voice in the back of the plane went, fire truck.

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:35.760
True.

01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:37.840
I swear to God.

01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:38.680
OK.

01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:40.040
And he was excited.

01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:41.760
And I laughed.

01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:43.720
And nobody else, I'm like, fire truck?

01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:44.800
You didn't hear fire truck?

01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:55.120
I went, that was the moment I went from atheist to agnostic.

01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:57.520
I was like, you know what?

01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:00.040
There really might be some sort of higher deity in this world.

01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:01.040
There's a possibility.

01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:04.480
Yeah, there's a higher power.

01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:06.360
And I know.

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:08.280
There also might be some apples.

01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:08.920
Apples?

01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:10.600
And I know people that go, you know,

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:14.000
they are like, and when I tell this story,

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.480
people, of course, come up to me.

01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:18.240
And the thing is, I know plenty of people

01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:19.960
have mentally challenged folks in their family,

01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:20.880
or they work with them.

01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:22.720
But if you don't think they say or do anything funny,

01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:24.760
you're denying that they're human beings.

01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:26.240
Because that's the funniest fucking thing

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:28.680
I've ever heard another human being say.

01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:30.800
Fire truck.

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:32.720
And the tag is, I was always trying to figure out,

01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:34.880
who is going to get top billing if the plane crash was

01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:37.720
going to say, Special Olympics team dies and fiery crash also

01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:41.720
on board 80s comedian Bobcat Goldthwait,

01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:44.080
or Bobcat Goldthwait Special Olympics team, and you go.

01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:46.400
Yeah, I was right.

01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:55.040
So the second time I tell that story, which is 100% true story,

01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:56.560
the second time I tell that story,

01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:59.120
I'm into my act about 10 to 15 minutes.

01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:01.320
And this woman gets up and she's,

01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:05.320
because I didn't have that tag that deflected.

01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:09.760
She goes, my son, she's all upset because she storms out

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:11.800
and she makes a point and then goes to the door,

01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:12.800
and that door is locked.

01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:16.240
So then she has to come back through, and it's horrible.

01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:17.880
And she's got a table full of friends.

01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:20.320
And I was really into my act, seriously, 10, 15 minutes.

01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:22.040
And I go, is that lady gone?

01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:23.160
I go, is she really gone?

01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:24.120
Is she out of the building?

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:25.720
They go, yeah, I go, all right.

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:30.680
Look, I'm not going to do my act.

01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:31.720
And he doesn't know this.

01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:33.440
But here's my friend, Robin Williams.

01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:35.040
Robin, come over here and finish this act.

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:39.480
And so he comes up and he does, like, an hour of stand up.

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:40.560
Wait, was she gone or was she not gone?

01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:41.320
Yes, she was gone.

01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:45.160
So then I come back and I go, all right,

01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:48.600
text your friend right now.

01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:51.680
Let her know what happened.

01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:53.400
Because she's like, oh, what happened after I left?

01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:55.680
Well, he left and Robin Williams did an hour.

01:33:55.680 --> 01:34:01.240
I hope you made your point.

01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:08.280
All my stories about Robin are like, people are like, oh,

01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:09.840
and then he said this and it was wonderful.

01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:13.520
It's always about me throwing him under the bus.

01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:14.920
They really are.

01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:15.960
You had a barracuda.

01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:17.720
Using him as a get out of jail freak.

01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:19.520
We were in the Caribbean in this barracuda.

01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:20.280
We're snorkeling.

01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:21.840
It comes up and it just jerks up.

01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:23.280
And it's right eye to eye with us.

01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:25.200
And I'd love to tell him a better man than this.

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:28.160
I grabbed him, put him right between me and the barracuda,

01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:29.160
not for a laugh.

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:35.720
It's just pure instinct, shit.

01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:37.400
You grab Robin as a human shield?

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:38.520
Yeah.

01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:38.880
Yeah.

01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:42.360
You're like Martin Sheen in the dead zone.

01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:45.440
I'm ashamed, and I even could have got out of it

01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:47.800
because we both started laughing when we run out of the water.

01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:50.200
And he's like, you did that on purpose, didn't you?

01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:54.680
I was like, yeah, I did.

01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:58.680
You've had a good run, you know?

01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:02.600
It would be Robin Williams and other attack by barracuda.

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:06.320
But yeah.

01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:08.440
I've been on lots of playings where I was like, oh shit,

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:10.160
I'll be a footnote on this plane because George

01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:12.440
Sakai is on the plane.

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:14.560
Sulu is on the plane.

01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:18.680
I will not be mentioned on that plane crash.

01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:19.320
Sulu was great.

01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:21.200
Sulu got on the plane before me and Greg Poops,

01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:22.600
and he got on the plane.

01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:25.280
And he's walking up, and there's a guy like,

01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:27.560
hello, Mr. Poops, hello, Mr. Son.

01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:29.920
Oh, Mr. Takei.

01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:31.800
And there's the guy that was working the gate.

01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:36.920
He said, I just saw you on an episode of like fucking,

01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:39.720
what's the fucking show, the fucking some sitcom,

01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:41.560
the Big Bang Theory.

01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:44.280
He said, I just saw you on an episode of Big Bang Theory.

01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:47.600
And George Takei goes, oh, that's very good news.

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:52.920
I can expect a residual.

01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:54.040
He was so good.

01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:56.280
Yeah.

01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:59.200
You're never going to worry about crashing when fucking

01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:00.520
Sulu's on your fucking plane.

01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:01.400
That's very good news.

01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:04.280
Well, yeah, come on.

01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:07.480
It's not, in the show, he's sitting in front of a prop.

01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:09.760
He's not able to control.

01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:10.960
The ship's not in space.

01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:12.400
I feel like, just psychologically,

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:15.080
we all feel like this is the best plane you're ever

01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:17.040
going to be on because he sat in front

01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:20.800
of a spaceship that never died.

01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:21.680
Well, I don't know.

01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:22.800
No, I don't care.

01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:24.960
I'm being an asshole.

01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:30.720
Yeah, Big Bang Theory.

01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:33.320
You're just mad that I said Big Bang Theory.

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:36.240
No, no, you've told us three before about George Takei.

01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:37.240
That's all.

01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:40.720
It's a real.

01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:44.160
And I'm preoccupied about the show.

01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:45.960
We've got to wrap the show up.

01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:46.880
We've been doing a lot of talk.

01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:48.120
No, but you don't get to leave.

01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:50.440
All right.

01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:56.000
Can I make you guys play the game with us for five minutes?

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.920
I was so good at Dungeons & Dragons.

01:36:57.920 --> 01:36:59.920
Sure.

01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:05.440
Let's play a fast and furious combat riddled

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:06.160
Shadowrun right now.

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:09.440
We've got an Eve Libertine and a Dr. Friend.

01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:11.200
So we need to bring D'Morge out here.

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:12.080
D'Morge Brown?

01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:13.560
Shit, we should have brought him.

01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:23.560
Yeah.

01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:24.560
Hello, D'Morge.

01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:25.560
Hello, hello, hello.

01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:26.560
We're fast and furious.

01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:30.560
We're bringing you in the dying embers of a soccer game right now.

01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:31.560
Do I have a bad count?

01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:34.560
Do you have a better bird's eye?

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:35.560
No, we're all good, man.

01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:36.560
OK.

01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:37.560
They can be living embers.

01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:38.560
OK.

01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:42.560
Curtis is going to hand him out because I usually do that pretty badly.

01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:49.560
So in the post-feminist progression of the show, we're bringing no women up.

01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:53.560
Because you know why?

01:37:53.560 --> 01:38:00.560
Because they can take care of themselves.

01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:02.560
Put that in your pipe and smoke it.

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:08.560
And if you don't believe that, maybe you hate women.

01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:11.560
See you next week.

01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:14.560
Yeah, I know.

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:15.560
All right.

01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:20.560
So Spencer, as I recall last time, you guys fought a bunch of ghouls.

01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:23.560
There was a ghoul magnet in a briefcase.

01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:24.560
Ghoul magnet?

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:26.560
You guys beat up a bunch of ghouls.

01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:28.560
What was happening after that, Spencer?

01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:29.560
Should we get a recap for that?

01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:32.560
Well, I mean, that was basically the whole recap.

01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:34.560
But I mean, I could do it.

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:35.560
But no, nothing happened after that.

01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:36.560
OK.

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:38.560
Let's skip the recap just for time to say.

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:39.560
Jump in.

01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:40.560
OK.

01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:43.560
Right now, we have a briefcase full of a ghoul magnet.

01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:45.560
We got fucked over.

01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:47.560
We didn't get the money, right?

01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:48.560
You did not.

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:50.560
We were supposed to get paid by our Johnson.

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:51.560
He fucking boned out.

01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:56.560
And I was standing in a parking lot, and we have a lot of questions.

01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:59.560
We're inside a chain-linked...

01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:04.560
You're outside of a chain-linked parking lot, nearby a dead gas station.

01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:06.560
I'm holding the ghoul magnet briefcase?

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:08.560
Yeah, it's beeping.

01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:13.560
He gave us a fucking ghoul magnet, and I throw it.

01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:16.560
All right.

01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:18.560
Nightblade, what was the name of our Johnson?

01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:19.560
What was the guy's name?

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:21.560
That just screwed us over.

01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:23.560
I tell him.

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:24.560
Spencer?

01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:29.560
He tells you that he didn't ask because he didn't do due diligence.

01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:31.560
We didn't get the name of that guy?

01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:32.560
No, you sure didn't.

01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:37.560
Well, the point of a shadow run really is more about not leaving a paper trail.

01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:43.560
I mean, as enough time passed, where I, as Eve Libertine, can I cast as kind of a spirit,

01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:49.560
or like an eagle to like fly off and follow the car of the person that drove away from us

01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:50.560
and follow that guy?

01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:52.560
It's been far too long for that.

01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:56.560
You can send him to search, but it'll be some time before he...

01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:02.560
Okay, I send off a search eagle to follow that guy,

01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:06.560
because there will be comeuppance for that guy for sure.

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:08.560
Strong.

01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:09.560
Sick.

01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:18.560
Hey, can I use my agony spell on the guy, even though he's getting away,

01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:20.560
but it's a long distance agony spell?

01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:21.560
Can I do one of those?

01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:23.560
You don't have line of sight to him.

01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:25.560
He's far, far off.

01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:31.560
But my mother could do that without seeing me.

01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:34.560
But even if you were just going to try, Curtis, I mean...

01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:35.560
I could try.

01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:38.560
Even if you were just going to try, it would probably sound like...

01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:46.560
Agony!

01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:52.560
Wait, Spencer, is there a way that I can send my eagle that goes off to search for him

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:55.560
and carry that agony along with...

01:40:55.560 --> 01:41:01.560
Can we team up his agony spell on my spiritual eagle to fly on?

01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:04.560
I'm trying to get us out of here in time.

01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:06.560
Yeah, yeah.

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:07.560
Is that a possibility?

01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:09.560
Yeah, but it'll take some special doings.

01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:10.560
Alright.

01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:11.560
What kind?

01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:12.560
It's a lot harder.

01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:14.560
You could pass out, you could even die.

01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:15.560
Oh, shit.

01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:16.560
What, the eagle?

01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:18.560
No, but no.

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:21.560
Spencer, I'm willing to try it.

01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:23.560
I'm willing to sacrifice it.

01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:27.560
If you put the agony on my spiritual eagle.

01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:30.560
But also, I have a lot of spirit sense.

01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:35.560
I touch my red feather earring on my right ear that gives me special spiritual power

01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:39.560
with spirits of air that should protect me more.

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:41.560
That should protect me more.

01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:44.560
And I go, Dr. Friends, hold my hand.

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:46.560
Hold my hand.

01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:48.560
Well, let's all hold hands just in case...

01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:49.560
Let's all hold hands.

01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:53.560
Everybody, if we all hold hands, if we all hold hands together.

01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:56.560
Alright.

01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:03.560
I'm holding my spiritual eagle to go find his mother fucker

01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:04.560
who gave us a fucking...

01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:05.560
Release the eagle!

01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:07.560
Who gave us a ghoul magnet instead of money.

01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:09.560
There was a swirling combination of spirits

01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:12.560
flowing through Horticard's body.

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:15.560
I'm elevating it with my own volumizer

01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:17.560
and sending it back through to the doctor

01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:20.560
and circling it back through to the eagle.

01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:25.560
Agony!

01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:28.560
Fly, eagle! Fly!

01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:33.560
Cos he know you only haiku!

01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:37.560
I sense that the only thing that could possibly be holding this back

01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:40.560
is the psychic blockage in my own body,

01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:42.560
so I lock eyes with Dr. Friend

01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:45.560
and continuing an arc that was established five episodes ago,

01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:49.560
I say, I'm gay too!

01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:54.560
I'm gay too!

01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:59.560
Flithinger!

01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:03.560
Alright.

01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:07.560
See, role-playing is easy.

01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:10.560
People act like it has to do with, like, numbers and...

01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:15.560
DeMorge Brown!

01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:16.560
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:20.560
We've also had Spencer Crittenden.

01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:23.560
Curtis Armstrong.

01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:27.560
I'm Cat Goldflakes.

01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:32.560
Dan Harmon.

01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:36.560
I demand, as Comptroller of Harmontown,

01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:40.560
that Curtis and Bob come back to finish what we started

01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:43.560
on this fucking shadow run.

01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:47.560
Thank you so much, everybody. Drive fast and take chances.

01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:50.560
Keep your eyes peeled for Call Me Lucky,

01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:55.560
and it'll be on your God Knows What medium soon.

01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:59.560
Thanks.

01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:04.560
Did you get any of that?

01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:21.560
It's a good show!
