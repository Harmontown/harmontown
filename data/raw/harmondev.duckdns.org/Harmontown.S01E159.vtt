{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:15.180\nFrom Hollywood, California, the nexus of entertainment and sexiness, to the Meltdown Theater and Meltdown\n\n00:15.180 --> 00:21.000\ncomics and NerdMelt and MeltyMelt's Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:21.000 --> 00:42.000\nWow! Tonight's attendance, 72,000 people. Let's bring out the Game Master, Spencer Fritton!\n\n00:42.000 --> 00:58.000\nAnd just for old time's sake, let's bring out the Mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:03.000\nThank you. Thank you very much.\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:07.000\nThere is a, it's a bigger, it's a bigger crowd. We're always sold out but it's a...\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:15.000\nIs it big? It sounds big. We're always sold out. But this is extra sold out.\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:21.000\nI don't think we're more sold out. I think these people are just more vigorous, more exciting.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:28.000\nLet's not kid ourselves, Jeff. The reason they're packed to the rafters tonight is not because of you or me or Spencer.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:45.000\nIt's because last week, we pointed out there was no ice scooper. Oh, shit! And they wanted to be here for the big unveiling.\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:51.000\nDan, kick it off and scoop me some motherfucking ice out of that thing.\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:54.000\nSpencer, talk to Jeff while I make Jeff a drink.\n\n01:54.000 --> 02:01.000\nGreat. Hey, how's it been going, Jeff? It's pretty good. I've been traveling. I'm a little travel weary, but I'm very good.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:05.000\nWhen'd you get back in, Jeff? I just got back in a couple days ago, but it was...\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:28.000\nThey love a couple days. That was a parody of when they do that, right?\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:32.000\nIt's like the movie Cocktail. You're time cruising here right now.\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:40.000\nIt was a parody. Thank you, Mr. Hyman.\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:44.000\nOkay, so Spencer... Yeah, man.\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:51.000\nWhat did you think about... Okay, so I have to get a car, right? Spencer's been driving me around. I love it. You love it, kind of.\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:53.000\nI love it. No, I love it.\n\n02:53.000 --> 03:02.000\nDid you register the anxiety level at UTA when we went there last week?\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:11.000\nSpencer and I walk into a place together because he drives me and then I go and then I'll have a meeting.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:16.000\nIt's not a natural thing to have a chauffeur.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:26.000\nNo, I think it's the way of the land. It's not, though. It's not the way of the waiting rooms where we go into.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:30.000\nSo the person at the desk is always like, hello.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:36.000\nAnd then Spencer, because he's like a squire, he's like an erstwhile squire.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:40.000\nHe drove me. He opened the doors. He knew exactly where to go.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:43.000\nI was just babbling about not wanting to tie my shoes the whole time.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:47.000\nAnd then Spencer gets to the desk and then the person goes, can I help you?\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:51.000\nAnd Spencer goes, Dan Harmon, to see whoever...\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:55.000\nLike, he announces me, which is amazing.\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:58.000\nWell, I do that anywhere we go, though.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:03.000\nBut then the receptionist goes, you're Dan, and who's he?\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:06.000\nAnd he goes, no, this is Dan Harmon. And then she goes, well, who are you?\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:14.000\nAnd he goes, I'm Spencer. And she's like, okay, do you guys want to go to water or Diet Coke or anything?\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:20.000\nWell, we'll take waters. And we go sit down. And then she's like, Dan and Spencer are here for the three o'clock meeting.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:27.000\nAnd then you just have to let it... You're like, it would be weird at any point to stop the momentum and go like,\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:32.000\nlet me explain something here. That's weird and takes really long to explain.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:38.000\nWell, I think that I generally try to say, oh, don't worry about me when they ask what my deal is.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:39.000\nWell, that's...\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:46.000\nDon't you worry. I'll just be over here six feet tall with a two foot long beard.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:50.000\nI'll just be hiding over here the most interesting looking guy in the universe.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:55.000\nYeah. Don't worry about me, like, needs more context than that thing.\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:59.000\nIt shouldn't. I mean, those people, they're all about hospitality.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:04.000\nSo they just want to make sure we're adequately respected, which is, you know,\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:07.000\nit comes to odds because I don't need that in those situations.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:12.000\nThat's the last thing I need is validation from, you know, secretarial staff.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:19.000\nIs there a validation Spencer that you do like want or crave?\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:22.000\nIs there something you would like to hear from staff or anything?\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:23.000\nFrom staff?\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:25.000\nI mean, like from strangers.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:32.000\nWell, I just want to just don't walk slowly, I think.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:33.000\nThat'd be good enough.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:40.000\nWhat do you like to hear from people secretly, even if it's a little selfish and juvenile and not mentally healthy to want it?\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:43.000\nLike, what's something that really puts a wind in yourself?\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:48.000\nLike a secret thing you wish strangers said or thought about you as you walked into a building?\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:52.000\nI like things that are useful or being useful to people.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:56.000\nSo that my manifesto is I'll be all like, hey, man, did you know if you're gagging,\n\n05:56.000 --> 06:01.000\nyou can put your thumb through your hand like that BuzzFeed article said, not gag.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:03.000\nAnd then people will be like, that helps me.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:05.000\nAnd then I'll be like, that's good.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:08.000\nBut yeah, I want to, yeah, I want to.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:10.000\nYou want to be useful?\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:14.000\nI want to increase the satisfaction of people's lives.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:16.000\nWait, oh, I'm sorry.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:21.000\nYou wish people would say, give you life-saving tips or you wish?\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:22.000\nNo.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:27.000\nYou wish people would say, oh, I wish they'd appreciate, yeah, the utility that I offer.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:28.000\nOh, that's good.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:32.000\nWell, you're in a good position because you have a lot of utility.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:33.000\nThank you.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:39.000\nYou're a healthy example of somebody who knows what they, knows their needs and gets their needs met.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.000\nThat's what my therapist would say.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:48.000\nDan, if you walked into an office building and like in a busy office corporate setting,\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:52.000\nwhat would you wish, like the gatekeepers, like the security person,\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:58.000\nlike the people that you have to walk past, what do you wish they thought about you on site?\n\n06:58.000 --> 06:59.000\nOh.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:07.000\nIt is he.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:11.000\nThe chosen one.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:14.000\nWe better get our shit together.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:15.000\nLike, I mean,\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:16.000\nFor real.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:18.000\nNo, I am being for real.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nI mean, we're living in a fantasy world.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:22.000\nLet's make a fantasy.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:28.000\nYou go into a corporate building like Century City Plaza,\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:32.000\nlike a business meeting, you get into an elevator.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:36.000\nEverybody in the elevator, there's men, there's women, they're well-dressed.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:37.000\nYou don't know what they do for a living.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:40.000\nThey could be high, low status comparatively.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:45.000\nWhat do you wish in your fantasy selfish egotistical brain?\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:49.000\nWhat do you wish everybody in that elevator was thinking?\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:54.000\nWell, I had something teed up, but then you asked the wrong question.\n\n07:54.000 --> 08:00.000\nBecause my fantasy was that one of the people in the whole elevator would go,\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:03.000\nOh, Mr. Harmon, no, I'm sorry.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:07.000\nAnd then press a secret button on the elevator.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:10.000\nAnd then the side of the elevator would open.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:13.000\nAnd it would be like, there would be like fog and lights.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:18.000\nAnd I would just be like in my hoodie, like Mark Zuckerberg and I'd go to the other people.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:21.000\nI'd be like, I don't know.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:24.000\nI just go through it.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:31.000\nSo I guess the answer to your question is I wish everyone in the elevator had thought.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:33.000\nWhat is he doing on this elevator?\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:36.000\nNow pick the person on the elevator that you hate the most.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:40.000\nWhat do you wish that person was thinking when that happened, when you went out the side door?\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:42.000\nWait, sorry, I didn't miss the top of that.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:49.000\nSo you get secret side elevator door status and you have your Zuckerberg hoodie on.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:52.000\nAnd you leave and you're like, sorry.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:57.000\nThe person that you hated the most on site when you went in the elevator,\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:03.000\nwhat do you wish he or she were thinking as that happened, like to make you the most happy?\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:14.000\nI was wrong about football.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:27.000\nOr all the crunches in the world couldn't lift my spirit right now.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:28.000\nAlright, you go into the thing.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:30.000\nThat guy had pizza for breakfast.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:34.000\nI've eaten nothing but almonds for six weeks.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:38.000\nAnd he gets to go through the side of an elevator.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:44.000\nWhat happens, I mean, let's fantasize, what happens at the side of the elevator?\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:47.000\nDoes it get you to the floor that you're going to faster?\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:51.000\nOr does it take you to another realm?\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:54.000\nWell, I mean, people go into a building and they go up and down.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:56.000\nThat's like people's shit.\n\n09:56.000 --> 10:00.000\nAnd you'll be in a world of pure imagination.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:02.000\nThe truth is that way.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:05.000\nThis is a fucking lie. This is a rat race.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:08.000\nOh, I hope I get to the 35th floor.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:13.000\nPsych, the real people go this way.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:15.000\nMe and D.L. Hugley.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:20.000\nAlright, so isn't he the one with the special purple door at the airport?\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:25.000\nHarmontown deep cut.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:29.000\nWell, I think that's, I mean, we have special friends here tonight.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nThat's probably why it's really packed.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:38.000\nI just wanted to tell you guys that I have a lot of paralysis when I talk to people in person.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:41.000\nBut I could get into that later.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:44.000\nLike, I don't really know how to talk to people.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:50.000\nBut I think in the last few shows, you've gone through leaps and bounds where you have done very good interviews.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:53.000\nNo, but you're talking about, this is a lie up here.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:57.000\nI'm talking about like actual, like writing in the Uber when the Uber driver goes,\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:01.000\nuh, let me go up to Fountain.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:03.000\nHe's shorter, he's shorter.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:10.000\nYou could go down Holly. We could keep going down Holly.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:13.000\nNo, no, no, Fountain. Fountain!\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:17.000\nAnd then I just go, uh...\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:18.000\nAlright.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:23.000\nBecause I don't want to talk to you. And it's not even about the conflict.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:28.000\nIt hurts to talk to people. It makes, it's like showering. It hurts my skin.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:35.000\nAnd like, when we were in New York, and I, like, when I was walking outside that restaurant,\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:41.000\nand the waitress, because it was Dino's favorite restaurant, everyone knows Dino's, everyone knows us.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:46.000\nAnd the waitress runs into me afterwards and she goes,\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:50.000\nhey, how are you? Hey, have you met Wes Anderson and Spike Jones?\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:54.000\nAnd I'm like, and she points through the window of the restaurant and there they are.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:58.000\nAnd I'm like, no, she's like, you should meet him.\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:00.000\nAnd I'm like, no, I shouldn't.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:05.000\nThat's like royalty, first of all.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:07.000\nAnd she's like, you're royalty.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:12.000\nAnd I'm like, that's the problem right there is that you saying that and that whole thing being there.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:16.000\nLike, there's tears and I know what nothing to do with this.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:24.000\nAnd then she dragged me in and she said, Wes, Spike, do you know Dan Harmon?\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:25.000\nOkay, that's a nightmare.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:31.000\nAnd they're like, no. And I'm like, hi. Nice to meet you.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:36.000\nAlso, I'm going to go in the back. And I could have done that anyway.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:39.000\nI don't think I would know if I sat down next to them which one was which.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:42.000\nI didn't know which one was which either.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:48.000\nAnd I'm happy about this. We wickipedia it later and my guests would have been wrong.\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:50.000\nBecause they look very different.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:55.000\nBut I thought, I thought, you know what, these guys are masters of the lateral.\n\n12:55.000 --> 13:01.000\nI bet the guy you think is Spike Jones looks like Wes Anderson.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:05.000\nAnd I was right, except I was wrong.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:07.000\nSo I would have made an ass of myself.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:12.000\nSo how did that come? Did you sit with them or just walk by like meeting the queen?\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:19.000\nI'm 42, so I wasn't like, I didn't like, my whole goal was just leave only footprints.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:23.000\nI just said, hello, nice to meet you. I made eye contact.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:27.000\nI breathed regularly and I just shook their hands and I made eye contact.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:31.000\nI didn't go in for the double cup weird like sexy handshake.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:34.000\nI just shook their hands. I said, hi, nice to meet you.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:37.000\nIt's very, very, very exciting and weird to meet you guys.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:41.000\nAnd I walked away and I feel like I won by doing that.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nDo you think that they knew who you were?\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:46.000\nNo, no, I hate the question.\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:51.000\nI mean, I wonder if you're not a celebrity, but I wonder if you are on their radar or not.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:56.000\nBut I could have like through work, you know, having a studio and stuff.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:59.000\nLike there was, if I had known which one was Spike for sure by looking at him,\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:01.000\nI could have, there was like an in-road there.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:05.000\nI could have said, oh, we have mutual friends.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:08.000\nBut I just boned out and I think I'm a better person for it.\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:12.000\nBut it wasn't about politics.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:16.000\nIt wasn't about star fucking versus like nervousness or anything like that.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nI'm talking about like that could happen with anybody.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:20.000\nI don't like talking to anybody.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:26.000\nLike I like, I've just gotten able to like do the thing like, you know,\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:32.000\nwhen people, if somebody says like, like, it's like, I forged this world.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:34.000\nLike I'm like Sauron.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:39.000\nLike I created this dumb, like weird world for myself where I could be comfortable.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:42.000\nIt's like every little, every little aspect of it is engineered,\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:48.000\nincluding the fact that like the only physical social interactions that I can handle\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:53.000\nare people like, like on a sidewalk going like,\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:57.000\ngetting excited when they see me and pointing at me so that I know like it's done,\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:00.000\nwhere there is no, we don't have to worry about anything.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:03.000\nBut if you meet somebody like at a restaurant or anywhere,\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:07.000\nUber driver that doesn't know who you are, that's never fun for you.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:09.000\nNo, God, no, no.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:11.000\nIt's pain, it's physical pain.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nBut I've been around you when I've like,\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:17.000\nwhen you stumble onto common ground with a stranger and you can go,\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.000\noh, you get really excited about that.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nBut that's always when I'm being introduced to them through a friend\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.000\nor something like that, like when you're hanging out,\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:26.000\nyou know, having drinks and some of those, oh, this is Molly\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:28.000\nand she's a friend of someone's.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:30.000\nI was like, oh, what do you do?\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:31.000\nOh, I'm an astronaut.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:32.000\nOh, Jesus Christ.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:33.000\nI have like 90 astronaut questions.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:39.000\nAnd then, yeah, it's, I mean, those, yeah, that's good.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:40.000\nThat's fine.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:43.000\nSo that's not 90% of like how you have to talk to people.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:46.000\nLike you have to talk to people who are scooping ice cream.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:49.000\nIf you like ice cream, you have to talk to the ice cream person.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:51.000\nThey're like, well, how many scoops do you want?\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:54.000\nAnd you're just like, I'm just like, two, two, two.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:57.000\nLike I just fucking like my brain just explodes.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:58.000\nI can't.\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:02.000\nThat's so funny because like, that's my favorite thing is, what are you doing?\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:03.000\nIs that your phone?\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:05.000\nOh, it's back here.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:08.000\nSorry.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:12.000\nLike, I'm like infatuated with strangers like,\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:18.000\nand the person sitting next to you is the most interesting thing in the world to me.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:23.000\nBecause of the free fall, the chaos of that moment, when you're talking to somebody and\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:27.000\nyou go, I don't know if we have anything in common at all.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:30.000\nSometimes you find out, okay, this person is kind of a bummer.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:33.000\nOr you go, oh, this person worked on the fucking Saturn 5 rocket.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:35.000\nLike that's fucking amazing.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:39.000\nBut that moment for you is more torture for.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:42.000\nYeah, I think we both agree that it's like falling off something.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:47.000\nAnd you're just like, I love that.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:49.000\nI too is my favorite.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:51.000\nAnd I'm like, I hate that.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:55.000\nBut I feel like I'm honest.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:59.000\nAnd you're like a Patrick Swayze thrill seeker or something.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:02.000\nI mean, I like it because you can find out.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:06.000\nI can be very misanthropic and very philanthropic from moment to moment,\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:09.000\ndepending on the quality of the person sitting next to you.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:15.000\nBut it's times when, like I get really endlessly fascinated by a stranger.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:19.000\nAnd you do too, but you're, you come at it from a very like.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:20.000\nHoly shit.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:23.000\nI just got Phil anthropic versus misanthropic.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:27.000\nPhil as like file, like pedophile, like children.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:28.000\nYeah.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:29.000\nYeah.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\nLike, like, like, I love it.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:35.000\nLike that's not the file word that you like are the most familiar with.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:37.000\nGod damn it.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:38.000\nHow about?\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:40.000\nGuys are always catching me.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:42.000\nYou could have started Philadelphia.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:45.000\nWell, I know, well, yeah, Philadelphia.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:47.000\nI'm just getting that now, though.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:48.000\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:51.000\nLike miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss,\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:53.000\nMiss Anthropy versus Phil Anthropy.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:54.000\nI didn't get the Phil.\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:55.000\nMisogyny.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:57.000\nWell, Philogyny.\n\n17:57.000 --> 17:59.000\nPhil.\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:03.000\nI love Chinese.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:08.000\nI love those Chinese up and down Fifth Street and Fourth Avenue.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:12.000\nHow do you do, young ladies? She got a hole where your wiener should be.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:13.000\nGot a Chinese.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:15.000\nI love your Chinese.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:20.000\nCause I'm a feminist and I'm a town bambam.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:22.000\nAll right.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:27.000\nThanks, thanks, kids.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:32.000\nOur next guest is no stranger to Chinese.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:36.000\nAndrew Ludweber.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:39.000\nI do want to bring him out because it's hot up here.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:44.000\nAnd I want you to see that I'm not the only one that sweats this much.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:49.000\nAnd I always, I feel like it's, I think you guys know it's hot in this room,\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:51.000\nbut it's six degrees cooler where you're sitting.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:52.000\nI'm telling you.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:56.000\nAnd then you look at me and you go, he's so disgusting.\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:58.000\nI'm hotter than you.\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:02.000\nJust a little hotter.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:06.000\nThere's people sitting out there fanning themselves right now.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:09.000\nIt's like the, like to kill a mockingbird.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:18.000\nI just come to bust up a shipper robe.\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:26.000\nIt's so hot in here that civil rights are being, like, are back on the table.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:32.000\nIt automatically, when it gets hot enough, every room becomes a Southern courtroom.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:37.000\nTech textbooks may not be allowed in science class tomorrow, depending on what happens tonight,\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:40.000\nbecause it's so hot.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:44.000\nOur next guest is a Gregory Peck, everybody.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:46.000\nOld friend of the show.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:50.000\nWe miss him very much, but we're so glad he spent some time away because he's been busy\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:53.000\nand has done something really incredible.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:56.000\nNot that he had not done all kinds of incredible things.\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:59.000\nWe were happy with him quite the way he was.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:02.000\nBut he kind of, if you're talking about the person I think you're talking about,\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:07.000\nhe just deals in incredible humanity all the time.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:09.000\nThat's what he fucking does.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:11.000\nAnd he does it for no reason.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:13.000\nHe does it because it's what he does.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:16.000\nHe's a magical, like, magic person.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:18.000\nHe's a magical, magic person.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:20.000\nHe's our friend, and let's talk about his new project,\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:23.000\nwhich everybody is going to be really excited to see.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:26.000\nPlease welcome back Bobcat Goldthwaite.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:40.000\nThank you.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:45.000\nNice. That's really nice.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:50.000\nThe idea that people would be excited and happy to see you,\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:55.000\nthat's the worst thing that could happen to me.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:58.000\nWhen people go, oh, when people are happy and excited to see me,\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:03.000\nI just don't want them to be normal.\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:08.000\nYou're an actor, turned director, probably for the same reason,\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:11.000\nand your circumstances are so different.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:16.000\nThe idea that anybody would ever see me and point is,\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:22.000\nkind of, for me, that's the same as saying you should be prom king,\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:24.000\nbut for what you're probably perceiving that moment,\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:26.000\nis like, oh, that's the guy from Police Academy, and this guy's gonna...\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nYeah, and here he comes.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:30.000\nI was in Detroit at a film festival, and this guy's like,\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:35.000\nI'm your biggest fan, and I took a picture with him,\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:38.000\nand he's like, what do you do now?\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:45.000\nMy biggest fan does not have access to IMDb.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:48.000\nThat's what I learned there.\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:50.000\nBut it was a good question.\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:52.000\nWhat would you want people to say, though,\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:54.000\nbecause they still have a big ego?\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:56.000\nIf they had, I want them, after I left,\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:59.000\nthat was him, I blew it, fuck!\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:01.000\nSo I do have a big ego.\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:07.000\nIt's kind of sad, but one of the things that's amazing about you now\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:12.000\nis that you accomplish things psychologically\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:17.000\nthat other people think are just kind of theories from therapy and stuff.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:20.000\nFuck you, Harmon, just talk.\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:23.000\nYou've had kind of a breech-birth career-wise,\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:26.000\nin terms of like, because your feet came out first.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:29.000\nYeah, I had the career most people had at the beginning, at the end.\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:32.000\nLike, I sold out at the beginning.\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:35.000\nWell, maybe, I mean, it's just like you can use those words,\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:37.000\nbut it's just more to the objective point.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:42.000\nLike, you were first famous for your hair and your voice.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:43.000\nAnd screenings.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:44.000\nAnd your face.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:49.000\nAnd I mean, that does not to say that your stand-up wasn't awesome,\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:51.000\nbut people were like, my mom was like,\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:55.000\nthat's the guy, that's the screechy guy with the hair.\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:58.000\nAnd then you, yeah, and then you, but now...\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:01.000\nNow I'm the mumbling bald guy.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:03.000\nWho's making these amazing things.\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:06.000\nImagine that, yeah, you're in disguise when you're at the mall.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:08.000\nYou're like, god damn it, nobody...\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:13.000\nI got hit by TMZ, which I was shocked.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:16.000\nIt was in New York, because in LA, no one cares.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:20.000\nAnd they were trying to agitate me, and the guy goes,\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:24.000\nthey're making another police academy to rebooting it.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:27.000\nDon't you think they should use the original cast?\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:29.000\nAnd I was like, no.\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:31.000\nAnd they go, why not?\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:34.000\nBecause a lot of us are dead.\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:39.000\nAnd then I said, if they're going to reboot it,\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:40.000\nthey should do it.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:41.000\nThey did the 21 Jones Street.\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:44.000\nThey should make it a comedy this time.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:47.000\nAnd that made the broadcast.\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:50.000\nBut then I said, this is what didn't make the broadcast.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:59.000\nI said, it's not really the right time to be doing wacky police comedies, you know.\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:02.000\nThe police are killing civilians, you know that.\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:04.000\nPolice Academy 5, Ferguson.\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:10.000\nOh, Mahoney.\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:13.000\nThat first movie in the 80s, it was at the central point of the irony\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:16.000\nthat Krall in the beginning was like, oh, this crazy government,\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:19.000\nnow they're going to let just anybody be a police.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:21.000\nAnd then it happened.\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:24.000\nYeah, the covers, it's like, I'm scratching my head with my gun,\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:28.000\nand I don't know what to do with my gun, bang, bang, bang, bang.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:32.000\nAnd it was like a joke then, and now it's like a horrible reality.\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:37.000\nI get, sometimes I'll be doing shows and someone will give me the Police Academy DVD,\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:41.000\nthe first one, and I wasn't in that.\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:46.000\nAnd I just, I'm not in this movie.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:49.000\nYou're not in the first one, you're in the second one.\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:53.000\nNo, I didn't think the quality of the script was there yet.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:56.000\nYou were holding out for more of a story structure.\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:58.000\nYeah, I said, this is shit.\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:00.000\nCome back to me when there's...\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:03.000\nCome back to me when Winslow has more of an arc.\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:11.000\nWhen his Atari squiggle doesn't sound exactly like his Nintendo squiggle.\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:16.000\nWell, you know, he, he, he's, he's, that is a talent.\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:21.000\nI'm not going to just diminish what he does, but, you know, he does that all day long.\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:24.000\nThose noises, like, he really does.\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:27.000\nLike if we were talking, that's his, you know,\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:34.000\nyou know, and one day it was really cold and miserable and reshooting a scene for the third time\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:37.000\nand we're in the basement of this building avoiding the weather.\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:42.000\nAnd he found the, you know, the dowel, the inside of a paper towel, the tube.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:48.000\nAnd so that was, you know, he, it was like backlit when he found it, because he could just, you know...\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:54.000\nIt sucked Perlman with a fucking shot of that.\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:58.000\nYeah, it was like a vintage Strativarius.\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:02.000\nSo he, you know, he's making his helicopter farts and just...\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:03.000\nHelicopter?\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:06.000\nAnd we're all trying to eat, and I find, and I really feel bad.\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:08.000\nSo this is a public apology to him.\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:12.000\nAnd I just finally go, Michael, no.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:14.000\nNo.\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:15.000\nNo.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:16.000\nSwear to God.\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:18.000\nSlow clap in the cafeteria.\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:20.000\nNo.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:21.000\nSlow clap.\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:23.000\nI feel really bad.\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:26.000\nIn my mind when I think of that story, and then a marching band came out.\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:28.000\nDa-da-da-da-da-da.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:30.000\nRip-tally thrown confetti around.\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:35.000\nBut they're all playing toilet paper tubes.\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:40.000\nAll right, so, since the last time we saw you,\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:42.000\nI think you were talking about this early on.\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:46.000\nYou were shooting footage back when we first made Friends, I even think.\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:49.000\nYou've been working on this for a little while, calling it together.\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:52.000\nYou have this, should we call him a mentor?\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:54.000\nYeah, Barry's definitely a mentor.\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:57.000\nThe movie is a documentary I made, and it's out now.\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:58.000\nIt's called Call Me Lucky.\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:02.000\nAnd I started doing comedy when I was 16.\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:06.000\nTom Kenny was 15 in Syracuse in this town next door.\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:09.000\nThere is an ad that said they were looking for comedians.\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:12.000\nBecause Tommy's always been amazing with voices.\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:14.000\nHe called up as a dude.\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:16.000\nHe was an adult, not a teenager.\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:18.000\nHe's like, yeah, we're a couple comedians.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:19.000\nWe want to come by.\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:20.000\nHe's a swear to God.\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:23.000\nI think Wilfred Brimley's coming in to do a set tonight.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:27.000\nAnd we showed up, and there's Barry.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:30.000\nHe's just such a character even back then.\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:32.000\nHe just looked up, and he said,\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:36.000\nIs your parents driving you?\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:42.000\nSo, you know, folks aren't aware of him.\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:44.000\nHe's a political sadist still.\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:47.000\nAnd my favorite Barry Crimmins joke is people say,\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:49.000\nIf you don't love this country, why don't you leave it?\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:55.000\nHe says, because I don't want to be victimized by its foreign policies.\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:57.000\nSo a real sharp guy.\n\n27:57.000 --> 28:01.000\nAnd he started a club in Boston that a lot of folks like Stephen Wright\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:05.000\nand Paula Poundstone, myself, a lot of people got their start in this room.\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:07.000\nAnd he was definitely a mentor and the gatekeeper.\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:09.000\nLike, if he thought you were derivative of anyone else,\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:10.000\nyou didn't get on stage.\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:13.000\nAnd so was Kevin Meany and Steve Sweeney and Lenny Clark.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:17.000\nAll these comics came out of that scene, and he drove it.\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:22.000\nI don't feel like, the movie isn't, it's about him.\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:24.000\nI think it's important people meet him and stuff.\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:27.000\nBut what it's really about is he, during a performance,\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:32.000\ndisclosed on stage about his rapes when he was four.\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:38.000\nAnd then he tried to process this.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:42.000\nSo in the course of him processing it, he went online.\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:45.000\nThis is in the early 90s, mid 90s, and AOL just started.\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:48.000\nSo there was people exchanging child pornography in chat rooms.\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:50.000\nAnd he complained to AOL and they didn't do anything.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:54.000\nAnd then he went to the cops, and the cops in the movie say,\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:56.000\nWe didn't even have computers then.\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:59.000\nSo he posed as kids, got all this evidence against AOL,\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:03.000\nand then took AOL to the floor of the Senate during a judiciary hearing.\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:06.000\nAnd it was like a Capra story, this nightclub comedian\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:08.000\nembarrassing this giant corporation.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:10.000\nAnd then afterwards there was a shift in him.\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:14.000\nWhat was the process for him, like, how did he go?\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:16.000\nBy the way, the movie's funny. I know it sounds...\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:18.000\nThe movie's amazing.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:20.000\nI mean, which is a story in and of itself,\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:23.000\nis the fact that you've made these movies that people adore\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:26.000\nbecause they're so punk rock, they're so you,\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:29.000\nand they're so sort of just...\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:34.000\nIf they're nothing else, they are you just trying to steer off\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:38.000\nof any conceivable road in front of you, shakes the clown.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:42.000\nThere's people who...\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nAnd there's an anger to that stuff too.\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:47.000\nI don't see it, but yeah.\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:50.000\nI mean, you're laughing the whole time, but you're humorous.\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:52.000\nKind of like God bless America when we shot a baby.\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:56.000\nI really thought... I really... It was like I wrote it.\n\n29:56.000 --> 30:00.000\nShe goes, don't you have a baby?\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:04.000\nAnd he pumps a shotgun, she throws it near and we shoot the baby.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:06.000\nThat was the only thing I've ever written\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:08.000\nthat I thought at some point someone was going to say,\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:11.000\nhey man, you can't do this, but it never happened.\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:13.000\nI was like, I guess we're shooting a baby today.\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:17.000\nAnd I said, give me a baby that looks really ugly.\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:20.000\nLike, I wanted it to look like someone shaved a pug, you know?\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:25.000\nAnd the baby came and it was really cute and it didn't cry\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:28.000\nand it would just sit there like, you know.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:31.000\nAnd I feel bad about this too.\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:34.000\nThis is my immense story.\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:35.000\nThis is a good place to do it.\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:37.000\nThe audience is 25 years old.\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:39.000\nThey love apologies and punishment.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:44.000\nSo the baby didn't cry.\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:47.000\nThe parents come in and they go, what are we shooting today?\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:49.000\nI'm like, you're a baby.\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:53.000\nAnd then I realized nobody told him what this thing was about.\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:58.000\nSo we gave him some more money and then that's true.\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:00.000\nIt was a stunt bump, I guess.\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:02.000\nStunt bump?\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:04.000\nThe baby just sat there just like this.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:06.000\nSo I would have the parents the day out.\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:09.000\nI'd have them walk off the set and the kid didn't give a shit.\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:13.000\nAnd then nothing.\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:16.000\nIt took its biscuit out of its mouth.\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:18.000\nNothing, just sat there.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:20.000\nSo then I'd love to tell you I'm a better man than this,\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:23.000\nbut I got down on all fours and I put keys over the lens\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:25.000\nso it would be looking in the right direction\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:27.000\nand then I got right in the baby space and I was like...\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:32.000\nAnd the baby would go...\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:34.000\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:39.000\nAnd whenever I would duck out of the way,\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:41.000\nthe baby would shut up immediately.\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:43.000\nSo the keys were to get the attention\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nand then you were there to horrify the baby.\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:47.000\nCorrect.\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:49.000\nAnd as soon as my face wasn't there,\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:51.000\nit would just shut down.\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:53.000\nIt was like that Michigan J. Frog, you know,\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.000\nlike, hello my baby, hello my ragtime dog.\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.000\nYou're running and getting the DP.\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nYou're like, I swear to God, the big...\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:01.000\nHe was crying.\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:03.000\nSure he was, Bobcat.\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:05.000\nFree beer.\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:08.000\nSo I imagine some day that kid would be 10\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:10.000\nand a police academy would come on and be like...\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:13.000\nAnd just...\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:16.000\nAnd then you'll have your shot.\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:18.000\nI got it.\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:21.000\nBut anyways, to whack Schmaltzy about it\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.000\nor just at least kind of mythical,\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:26.000\nI mean, all of that awesome punk rock,\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:28.000\nanger, energy, whatever you call it,\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:30.000\nyou don't call it anger, but like...\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:32.000\nNo, I guess it is.\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:35.000\n...cynical, whatever, like non-establishment.\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:38.000\nAnd you had this father figure early on\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:42.000\nin your comedy career who had this scar in his life\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:44.000\nand then one of your...\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:46.000\nThere's all these different kinds of movies.\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:48.000\nThe most recent one before that is this...\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:50.000\nYou know, there's another weird turn for you\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:52.000\nthat found footage like a Bigfoot movie.\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:55.000\nIt's like that does not resemble Shakespeare's clown that much.\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.000\nIt's not like you're a Rob Zombie trying to...\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:59.000\nLike, you're like, no, you don't get it yet.\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:01.000\nNo, I just like Bigfoot.\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:04.000\nThe cheerleaders are dumb and they should be tortured.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:06.000\nOne more movie and I swear you're going to get it.\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:08.000\nNo, I just wanted to make a Bigfoot movie\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:10.000\nbecause I like Bigfoot.\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:12.000\nAnd...\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:16.000\nYou killed this guy with your first documentary.\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:18.000\nSo, Barry, it's what you say, anti-establishment\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:20.000\nbecause I met him as a teenager\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:23.000\nand here's this guy who was totally anti-establishment\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:25.000\nand he wasn't condescending to us.\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:27.000\nHe actually encouraged it.\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:29.000\nSo, you know, that was...\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:31.000\nThat really...\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:33.000\nHow did he come out of it?\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:35.000\nLike, is he happy with what happened?\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:37.000\nIs that satisfying for him?\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:39.000\nI don't think he is happy.\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:42.000\nNo, he's the first one to make those jokes.\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:45.000\nThere's a scene in the movie where\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:49.000\nhe actually goes into the basement that this happened in\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:52.000\nand I was just filming the basement\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:55.000\nbecause I thought that was way more powerful\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:57.000\njust to show these spaces,\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:59.000\nbut I did not want him to go in there\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:01.000\nand he goes, you go through a problem, you know,\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:03.000\nyou don't go around it.\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:05.000\nThere's no demons. I'm demystifying the space.\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:07.000\nI'm going down there. You can film it or not.\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:09.000\nHad he been back there since?\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:11.000\nNo, no, he says it's not a place I like to...\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:13.000\nThis is the first time when you've been...\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:15.000\nYeah, so he was like...\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:17.000\nSo, we had a huge argument\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:19.000\nand I said,\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:22.000\nwell, just give me five minutes so I can roll.\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:24.000\nAnd it's in the movie and it's very powerful\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:26.000\nand there was a reason I was trying to remember,\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:28.000\nbut one of the things happened is\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:30.000\nhe's very eloquent in the basement\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:32.000\nand then afterwards, because I knew it would happen,\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:34.000\nhe went in a shock, you know,\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:36.000\nhe does this weird thing when he's going in a shock\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:38.000\nand he goes, I can't remember what I said.\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:40.000\nIs any of it usable?\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:42.000\nAnd I said, oh, it doesn't matter.\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:44.000\nI'm going to play Yackety Sacks.\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:46.000\nSo, oh, that's what I was going to say.\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nJust what you were saying, he said,\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:50.000\nwe were doing a Q&A and I said, you know,\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:52.000\nand I wanted to film the spaces\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:54.000\nand I didn't want to do reenactments\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nand he goes, you didn't want to do reenactments.\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:58.000\nIt works every time.\n\n34:58.000 --> 35:00.000\nBut Bob, Bob,\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:02.000\nthere's a...\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:07.000\nDoes Barry emerge from this, like,\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:09.000\nis that more healing for him?\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:12.000\nYeah, yeah, and the point of the movie\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:14.000\nfor me was to show\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:16.000\nhe comes out through the other side\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:17.000\nand not only...\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:19.000\nhe's not a person, a victim of this.\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:21.000\nAs he says, I'm not a victim anymore.\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:24.000\nIt is about coming all the way through the other side\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:27.000\nand, you know, he starts off the movie,\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:29.000\nhe's just full of rage and he's still angry,\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:32.000\nbut, you know, his targets are now, you know,\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:35.000\nmore directed at people and things.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:38.000\nThat's the thing that I want people listening to this\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:40.000\nas far as plugging the movie is concerned,\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:43.000\nbecause the tough thing about good movies,\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:45.000\nespecially ones that are profound,\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:47.000\nthat have to do with insights into human darkness,\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:49.000\nthey're not always at the top of your list,\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:51.000\nno matter how good you know they'll be.\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:53.000\nLike, I still haven't seen the act of killing\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:55.000\nand everyone says it's a great movie.\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.000\nI mean, it's the most important movie you'll ever see.\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nAnd that's what...\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:01.000\nBut the thing about that is that I keep saying to people,\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:03.000\nlike, yeah, but don't worry about it.\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:05.000\nIt will not challenge you that way.\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:08.000\nIt's colorful and whimsical and ironic.\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:09.000\nIt's...\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:10.000\nThat's...\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:13.000\nAnd your movie is similar in that sense.\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:15.000\nIt's why I texted you halfway through it\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:17.000\nand was like, this is really genius,\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:19.000\nbecause there...\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:21.000\nAnd it's something about Barry, too.\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:24.000\nI don't think I have the IQ or the vocabulary\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:28.000\nin what the real important thing\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:30.000\nabout what's on the microscope slide there.\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:32.000\nIt has something to do with the fact\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:35.000\nthat he's really smart and really funny\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:38.000\nand really autonomous and really unafraid\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:41.000\nof the entire United States government\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:43.000\nand all of mainstream society\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nand anyone that could ever tell him\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:48.000\nthat he's gross or fat or dirty or stupid.\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:49.000\nHe's...\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:52.000\nAnd that he doesn't cut the silhouette,\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:55.000\ntherefore, of somebody who is capable\n\n36:55.000 --> 37:00.000\nof having something so...\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:02.000\nJust...\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:04.000\nJust so...\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:06.000\nThis is where my vocabulary breaks down.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:09.000\nThe dichotomy is very interesting to me,\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:10.000\nbecause he's not...\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:12.000\nIt's like we're used to breaking up the world\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:15.000\ninto guys like that that are like...\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:17.000\nHe didn't...\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:19.000\nHe didn't say, oh, my God, I was molested on stage\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:21.000\nand then curl up in a ball and start sucking his thumb\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:23.000\nand then become really unfunny.\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:25.000\nHe became even funnier and even smarter\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:28.000\nand even stronger, but in a process\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:30.000\nthat he had to ask himself questions about,\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:33.000\nlike everything that he had ever thought or done\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:35.000\nand every formation of all.\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:37.000\nAnd how do you know, even those of us\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:40.000\nwho can't point to a big red trauma on a map,\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:42.000\nwe have to go to therapy and wonder\n\n37:42.000 --> 37:45.000\nhow much of what makes people chuckle\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:49.000\nwhen I talk is unhealthy and how much of it is like.\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:51.000\nI don't know, it's a really...\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:53.000\nIt's an important movie for that reason.\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:55.000\nIt's just a...\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:56.000\nHere, put this on the poster.\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:57.000\nI'm going to give you a great quote.\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:58.000\nEven if he hadn't been molested,\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:00.000\nthis would be a great documentary.\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:02.000\nUm...\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:07.000\nWell, because he's a really, really incredible...\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:09.000\nWell, I think people would go,\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:11.000\nwell, you know, did you pitch this movie?\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:13.000\nIt's like, where?\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:14.000\nHere you go.\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:16.000\nHey, here's a comedian that you're not familiar with.\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:18.000\nNo way, he gets raped as a kid.\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:20.000\nHear me out.\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:22.000\nHear me out.\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:26.000\nIt's $10 million, Mr. Goldbach.\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:28.000\nWhat was it like...\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:31.000\nLike, did you get...\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:34.000\nWhat was it like, the journey for you in that movie?\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:36.000\nLike, did you think that you were going to get through that\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:37.000\nwithout it being hard?\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:39.000\nDid you know how hard it would be for you?\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:42.000\nLike, what was your journey through all that darkness\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:43.000\nand all that sadness?\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:46.000\nYeah, it was...\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:50.000\nYou know, I was very concerned for my friend,\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:54.000\nand Barry says that whenever the movie would have come first,\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:57.000\nhis well-being was always more important than making a movie,\n\n38:57.000 --> 38:59.000\neven if it was a movie about...\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:01.000\nBut it was...\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:03.000\nIt's been very hard, you know?\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:05.000\nWhat did you go through?\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:06.000\nLike, what was your journey on that?\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:08.000\nWell, it's now, you know?\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:10.000\nWe've had a lot of success with the movie\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:12.000\nand we show screenings,\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:14.000\nand people, you know, really like it,\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:16.000\nso I have to deal with that.\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:18.000\nI don't like success, and then there's...\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:23.000\nNo, okay, but there's often, after the movie,\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:25.000\nyou know, adult survivors come out when they disclose,\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:27.000\nand often they're telling me this is the first time\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:28.000\nthey ever did this.\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:32.000\nSo you get a full portion of that every time you show the movie?\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:33.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:35.000\nIt's been...\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:37.000\nI'm glad the movie's helping people.\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:40.000\nI'm glad it's been doing so well and people are receiving it,\n\n39:40.000 --> 39:45.000\nbut, you know, it's...\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:48.000\nYou know, the birth of the movie,\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:49.000\nand I'll talk about it here,\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:51.000\nbecause the last time we worked together was here.\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:54.000\nYou know, Robin Williams is my best friend,\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:56.000\nand he knew...\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:59.000\nI wanted to do Barry's Story all the way in the mid-90s.\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:02.000\nI thought, you know, we took a swipe at Scripps and everything,\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:04.000\nbecause I thought I'd want to have someone play him.\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:09.000\nAnd it was Robin that kind of suggested that I jettisoned that idea.\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:11.000\nI'm smiling, because he's like,\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:13.000\nhe's like, I'm too old to play that role.\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:16.000\nHe's like, he's like, why don't you do it as a documentary?\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:18.000\nSo...\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:21.000\nThe last time we talked about this was Tasha's, your daughter's birthday.\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:22.000\nYeah.\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:23.000\nYou sat down and said, how are you doing?\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:24.000\nHe said, well, I had a breakup.\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:27.000\nMy best friend died, and I'm making a movie about...\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:29.000\nChild rape, yeah.\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:30.000\nIt was even better than that.\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:35.000\nIt was divorce, broke up, decorating the Christmas tree with another woman.\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:37.000\nMy best friend passed away, and then, yeah,\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:40.000\nfor about eight to 12 hours a day, I would edit a...\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:41.000\nYou're dealing with this shit.\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:43.000\nChild rape documentary.\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:44.000\nSo, it was...\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:47.000\nI'm really ready to do, like, a talking duck movie.\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:50.000\nIt's just something really acid.\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:51.000\nWell, that's...\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:53.000\nI mean, here comes Quackers.\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:56.000\nThey were letting you shoot babies before, but now you've like...\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:57.000\nDo you feel like there's like...\n\n40:57.000 --> 41:00.000\nYou get the karma holsters off the, like, full,\n\n41:00.000 --> 41:03.000\nand you can shoot 11 babies in the next movie?\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:06.000\nYeah, at least it wasn't like that duck.\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:08.000\nBut Barry wants to do a sequel.\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:10.000\nHe called me greedy.\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:13.000\nSo, Robin was the one.\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:15.000\nHe said, you know, shoot us a duck.\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:17.000\nAnd he said, I don't have any money.\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:19.000\nAnd he actually gave me some money to start filming.\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:21.000\nAnd that's how the whole movie got made, was that.\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:24.000\nYou wanted him to do a live-action version of him as Barry?\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:27.000\nYeah, that was really what I was thinking.\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:32.000\nAnd then we still were thinking about making it with someone else playing him.\n\n41:32.000 --> 41:36.000\nAnd Barry wrote a script that was about 350 pages long.\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:41.000\nAnd then I took a stab at a script, which actually helped the duck,\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:43.000\nbecause I kind of had the structure in my head.\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:48.000\nAnd I didn't do that as a bait and switch how his disclosures reveal.\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:53.000\nI just wanted the audience to feel exactly how I felt knowing this guy,\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:56.000\nknowing this guy really well, and then learning,\n\n41:56.000 --> 41:58.000\noh, now it makes sense.\n\n41:58.000 --> 42:03.000\nI think the 48 hours version would have been raped at four,\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:07.000\ncomedian, and then nothing would have been funny for 45 minutes.\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:11.000\nWell, it's also like, I want to bring our other friend up,\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:14.000\nbut the other powerful thing about it,\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:16.000\nmaybe this is what I was trying to articulate,\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:19.000\nis the fact that you do it that way.\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:24.000\nBecause I feel like sickness, abuse, death,\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:29.000\nthe things that we fear, the things that we know that are the worst things that can happen to us,\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:34.000\nwe tend to relate to them emotionally as diseases.\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:37.000\nAnd when our friends are afflicted with them,\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:41.000\nwe have this temptation to...\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:48.000\nIt's this terrible syndrome of shame and guilt and stuff that we go like,\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:56.000\noh, God, well, this person, if this terrible thing happened to them, then that makes them a different kind of action figure.\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:59.000\nThey need special tools and backpacks and things,\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:07.000\nbut nobody is more human and more dimensionalized than Barry Crimmins.\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:13.000\nNobody has more tools to deal with any Manticore that would cross his path.\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:20.000\nAnd then this thing is placed in his path,\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:24.000\nand we watch him eat it, and we watch him digest it, and we do it with him,\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:28.000\nand it humanizes it, and it makes it a real thing, which is really...\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:33.000\nI often wonder if Barry...\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:38.000\nBecause he almost, in my mind, may have been that kid at four,\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:44.000\nbecause his friends were talking about some preschool revolt that he led.\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:49.000\nThey handed out books, and then he threw them out the window.\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:53.000\nThey were like, we're not going to need books.\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:59.000\nHe said that when he disclosed to me that my reaction wasn't...\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:02.000\nSomeone says this to you, now it's on your lap.\n\n44:02.000 --> 44:04.000\nYou're re-seeing this person.\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:09.000\nAnd when he told me, he said that it was almost...\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:12.000\nHe talks very affectionately about how I reacted.\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:16.000\nI was just like, oh, I was kind of...\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:20.000\nNot happy, but I was just like, oh, well, that makes sense.\n\n44:20.000 --> 44:23.000\nWhere did you first see him or hear him?\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:26.000\nDo you have any favorite jokes, the first jokes that you remember\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:29.000\nwhen you first thought he was funny?\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:32.000\nOh, yeah, the first time I saw him.\n\n44:32.000 --> 44:35.000\nThe first thing I remember was the first time I saw him walking on stage.\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:39.000\nHe's swilling a beer that he pulled out of his jacket,\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:45.000\nand he's smoking, and he's like, ah, I'm on a health kick lately.\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:52.000\nWe've kept one of our other dear friends up in there.\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:56.000\nLike you has been out in the world, and we want to hear what he's been up to.\n\n44:56.000 --> 45:09.000\nLet's bring Curtis Armstrong out.\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:12.000\nWhat a pleasure.\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:14.000\nThank you.\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:16.000\nThank you.\n\n45:16.000 --> 45:18.000\nHey, buddy.\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:23.000\nI have these friendships that literally only exist on stage,\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:27.000\nand it's very unhealthy.\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:32.000\nI'm just explaining that I'm not a healthy person,\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:34.000\nand that's what I was talking about earlier.\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:40.000\nThat goes without saying, but what was interesting for me\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:45.000\nis that I'm here because I've been away for a while,\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:48.000\nand I asked if I could come by, and he said, yeah,\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:50.000\nbut of course he doesn't tell me.\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:51.000\nOh, that I'm here?\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:52.000\nThat you're here.\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:54.000\nSo I show up just as you come out,\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:57.000\nand it's the first time I think I've been in a room with him\n\n45:57.000 --> 45:59.000\nin about 30 years or something.\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:01.000\nOh, I didn't know you guys crossed paths with him.\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:03.000\nWe did a movie called One Crazy Summer.\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:05.000\nOh, yeah!\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:07.000\nHe's just fucking crying.\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:08.000\nThat was my brain.\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:11.000\nBob, that's what's missing you, Joe Murray, too, right?\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:12.000\nJoe Murray, yeah.\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:13.000\nBill Murray, you're right.\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:15.000\nCarlos America, the one we love and adore.\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:16.000\nJohn Cusack.\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:17.000\nI was talking about this movie at Nausea,\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:20.000\nbut why did they make that fucking connection?\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:21.000\nWell, that's how we met.\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:25.000\nWe were in our 20s, and we made that movie,\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:26.000\nand it was...\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:29.000\nI'm a big indoor BB gun enthusiast,\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:32.000\nbut at the time we made that movie,\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:35.000\nI was a big indoor model rocketry enthusiast.\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:37.000\nSo every night I'd go back into my room\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:39.000\nand build a big rocket,\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:41.000\nand then shoot it down the hallway of the hotel,\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:43.000\nbecause there was this security guard\n\n46:43.000 --> 46:45.000\nwho was like, you guys are making too much noise,\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:47.000\nand I was like, oh, I'll give you noise.\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:50.000\nSo we would sit there with lawn chairs\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:53.000\nfor this poor guy to come around the corner\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:56.000\nand go, shoot, shoot, shoot.\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:58.000\nRock it at him.\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:00.000\nYeah, that was a lot of stuff like that.\n\n47:00.000 --> 47:02.000\nIt was great, and what was really great about that movie\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:05.000\nis if you see it now, there's Bill Murray,\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:06.000\nthere's John Cusack.\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:07.000\nJoe, Joe Murray, Joe.\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:08.000\nNow I feel better.\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:12.000\nJoe Murray, and Bill, and John Cusack,\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:14.000\nand to me more.\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:15.000\nTo me more.\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:17.000\nBut what's really funny about it is\n\n47:17.000 --> 47:21.000\nhe's so completely took over this movie.\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:23.000\nWow.\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:26.000\nNo, wait, let me finish what I'm saying.\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:29.000\nSo what happens is we all show up in...\n\n47:29.000 --> 47:31.000\nI love this movie.\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:34.000\nWe all think that we have our thing going,\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:37.000\nand we know what we're doing, and we have our bit,\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:39.000\nand Cusack's got a name already,\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:41.000\nand to me he's got a name already.\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:45.000\nBut after about a week on the set,\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:48.000\nthey're all talking like him.\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:49.000\nOn camera.\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:52.000\nNot just off camera, where we're off going,\n\n47:52.000 --> 47:56.000\nyou know, but on camera.\n\n47:56.000 --> 47:59.000\nAnd it started like with Cusack doing it,\n\n47:59.000 --> 48:01.000\nand then, remember this?\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:02.000\nYeah, he did love it.\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:05.000\nAnd Joel, and then to me, started doing it.\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:08.000\nSo they would be on camera doing scenes\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:10.000\nthat had nothing to do with him.\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:11.000\nAnd Savage Steve is like,\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:14.000\nyou know, this wasn't supposed to be about Grover's family.\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:18.000\nBut when we...\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:21.000\nSo to me, he was on General Hospital.\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:24.000\nCusack had done that Rob Reiner movie,\n\n48:24.000 --> 48:26.000\na sure thing.\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:29.000\nEverybody was coming up.\n\n48:29.000 --> 48:32.000\nEverybody had a high-cute, but Curtis.\n\n48:32.000 --> 48:33.000\nSo we had all got to dinner,\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:35.000\nand nobody would recognize anybody,\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:36.000\nand it would always be,\n\n48:36.000 --> 48:39.000\nBooga! It's fucking Booga!\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:41.000\nBooga!\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:44.000\nBooga, come over here!\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:46.000\nCage later made Jackie Templeton.\n\n48:46.000 --> 48:48.000\nIt's just a Demy's character on that movie.\n\n48:48.000 --> 48:49.000\nNo, it was great.\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:51.000\nIt was such a great scene.\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:54.000\nThere's a scene where Steve told me later,\n\n48:54.000 --> 48:56.000\nthat scene where I...\n\n48:56.000 --> 48:58.000\nIt's with you and I,\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:01.000\nand I say, talk about a little fat kid who's grown up.\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:02.000\nYes, oh God, yes.\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:04.000\nAnd he goes, were you that fat kid?\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:05.000\nAnd I was like,\n\n49:05.000 --> 49:07.000\nno, I used to punch the shit out of him.\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:10.000\nAnd I'm almost in tears telling that story.\n\n49:10.000 --> 49:11.000\nI didn't remember.\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:13.000\nSteve said that was something I pitched.\n\n49:13.000 --> 49:14.000\nYou didn't pitch it.\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:16.000\nI'll tell you exactly what happened.\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:20.000\nI'm gonna fucking die over here.\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:22.000\nI'm so happy.\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:24.000\nI have never forgotten this,\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:27.000\nbecause I honestly didn't know Bobcat at that point.\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:31.000\nHe was just this God-like thing\n\n49:31.000 --> 49:33.000\nthat showed up on the set one day,\n\n49:33.000 --> 49:36.000\nand you couldn't stop, you couldn't speak.\n\n49:36.000 --> 49:39.000\nYou weren't familiar with anything that you hadn't seen him.\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:41.000\nI don't know if I'd seen him.\n\n49:41.000 --> 49:42.000\nI'd never seen him live,\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:44.000\nso I don't think I saw him live a lot after.\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:46.000\nBut at that time I hadn't seen him.\n\n49:46.000 --> 49:48.000\nBut he shows up,\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:50.000\nand there's just nobody like this man in the world.\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:52.000\nAnd it wasn't like he was on\n\n49:52.000 --> 49:55.000\nin that sort of Bobcat character all the time.\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:56.000\nHe wasn't doing that.\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:58.000\nBut he was so interesting,\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:01.000\nand so funny, and so smart,\n\n50:01.000 --> 50:03.000\nand everything, all this great stuff was coming out of him,\n\n50:03.000 --> 50:06.000\nand you just wanted to sit and listen to him.\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:09.000\nAnd so we're at lunch one day.\n\n50:09.000 --> 50:11.000\nHe comes over to me and says,\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:12.000\ncome here.\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:14.000\nAnd he takes me into a garage.\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:16.000\nAnd...\n\n50:19.000 --> 50:21.000\nI'm not falling for that again.\n\n50:23.000 --> 50:25.000\nAnd he says,\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:28.000\nI have this idea for a scene,\n\n50:28.000 --> 50:30.000\nand I want to run through it with you\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:32.000\nbefore I show Savage.\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:34.000\nThis is what happened.\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:36.000\nWe sit down, and I'm just looking at you,\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:38.000\nwaiting for you to start.\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:40.000\nAnd you start in on that speech,\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:42.000\nwhere you say, you know,\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:44.000\nthere was this little fat kid once,\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:46.000\nand you go through the whole thing,\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:48.000\nand it's very funny if you know the movie,\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:50.000\nand if you see the movie, he's really funny.\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:53.000\nAnd he tells this whole sad story\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:55.000\nabout the little fat boy,\n\n50:55.000 --> 50:57.000\nlike he's confessing.\n\n50:57.000 --> 50:59.000\nAnd I say, and I just said to him,\n\n50:59.000 --> 51:01.000\nas a person,\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:04.000\nwere you that little fat boy?\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:06.000\nAnd he said,\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:09.000\nno, but I used to beat the shit out of him.\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:12.000\nAnd I thought it was the best thing I'd ever seen.\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:15.000\nSo we got Savage from lunch,\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:17.000\nand we ran through it again for Savage,\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:20.000\nand it's the big scene that he has in the movie.\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:22.000\nAnd he just came up with it.\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:23.000\nBut I didn't...\n\n51:23.000 --> 51:26.000\nYeah, I was naïve about how things work.\n\n51:26.000 --> 51:28.000\nApparently not.\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:31.000\nApparently you could just put a scene in a movie.\n\n51:31.000 --> 51:32.000\nYeah, I know.\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:34.000\nYou were right, you were right.\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:36.000\nWhen you had me drag community,\n\n51:36.000 --> 51:38.000\nI didn't do any of that shit.\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:40.000\nYou didn't come down and go,\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:42.000\nwhat the fuck is going on?\n\n51:42.000 --> 51:44.000\nGoldway's in a scene now?\n\n51:46.000 --> 51:47.000\nSo for real, Curtis,\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:49.000\nthat whole scene, that monologue is all...\n\n51:49.000 --> 51:53.000\nImprovised entirely by him in a garage.\n\n51:53.000 --> 51:55.000\nBecause that's one of the memorable...\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:57.000\nI know, that's why I'm bringing it up.\n\n51:57.000 --> 51:59.000\nIt's one of the big scenes in the movie.\n\n51:59.000 --> 52:00.000\nI do remember it,\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:03.000\nand I have the best memory in the world.\n\n52:03.000 --> 52:06.000\nBecause I forgot that they were in that movie together.\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:09.000\nI mean, I get to travel around a lot with Joel Murray,\n\n52:09.000 --> 52:11.000\nand whom I love and adore,\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:14.000\nwho's one of the most delightful people there is.\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:17.000\nAnd he's told stories about working on One Crazy Summer\n\n52:17.000 --> 52:19.000\nabout how much fun you guys had.\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:21.000\nYeah, it was really, really much fun.\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:23.000\nAll the partying, because it was the 80s,\n\n52:23.000 --> 52:25.000\nand it was groove-tastic,\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:27.000\nreally sexy and fun.\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:28.000\nI remember the Q-Sex, like,\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:31.000\nI got this friend, and he's going to put him in the movie,\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:32.000\nand it was Piven.\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:34.000\nAnd Piven shows up, gets hammered,\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:36.000\njumps in the pool, cracks his face open\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:38.000\non the bottom of the pool.\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:40.000\nIt hasn't been on camera yet,\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:43.000\nand they had a putty his face with mortician's wax.\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:45.000\nHe had a big cut in his head.\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:46.000\nAw, Pivi.\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:48.000\nAw, the Piv.\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:50.000\nPoor Pivi.\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:52.000\nMr. Sulfridge.\n\n52:52.000 --> 52:55.000\nSo, well, well, well, well.\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:57.000\nEnough One Crazy Summer.\n\n52:57.000 --> 52:59.000\nBut that must have been an awesome time to be\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:01.000\nyoung comics in,\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:04.000\nwhen they were making big comedy films.\n\n53:04.000 --> 53:06.000\nWell, I remember that,\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:07.000\nthe name of it was called,\n\n53:07.000 --> 53:09.000\nwhat was it, My Summer Vacation?\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:10.000\nMy Summer Vacation.\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:12.000\nYeah, yeah, and then they were saying,\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:13.000\nWarner Brothers said,\n\n53:13.000 --> 53:15.000\nyou can't call that because they had vacation.\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:16.000\nAnd so they said,\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:19.000\nwe're going to call it One Crazy Summer.\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:21.000\nAnd he goes, if they put out Woody Allen movies,\n\n53:21.000 --> 53:23.000\nthey'd be one neurotic Jewish guy.\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:25.000\nYeah.\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:27.000\nYeah, that's what,\n\n53:27.000 --> 53:30.000\nI mean, well, to counter what Jeff said,\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:33.000\nI think the further back you go,\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:36.000\nand we think in this desolate landscape\n\n53:36.000 --> 53:38.000\nof where it's catch is catch can,\n\n53:38.000 --> 53:40.000\nand we just get a little giggled here,\n\n53:40.000 --> 53:42.000\nand my podcast got 600 hits,\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:43.000\nand I'm so happy.\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:46.000\nAnd I think you talk to the Farrelly Brothers\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:48.000\nabout Kingpin, for example,\n\n53:48.000 --> 53:50.000\nand you hear this story about how\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:52.000\nthey almost killed themselves.\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:55.000\nI thought Kingpin was the best Farrelly Brothers movie\n\n53:55.000 --> 53:56.000\nthat has ever been made,\n\n53:56.000 --> 53:59.000\nbut because the world was older then,\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:01.000\nlike the rules are different about,\n\n54:01.000 --> 54:03.000\nwho's telling you what,\n\n54:03.000 --> 54:05.000\nabout whether or not you're being successful,\n\n54:05.000 --> 54:08.000\nwhether or not your movie succeeded.\n\n54:08.000 --> 54:11.000\nAnd the disparity between,\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:13.000\nwhen you're supposed to celebrate,\n\n54:13.000 --> 54:15.000\nremember the Sony leaks came out,\n\n54:15.000 --> 54:17.000\nand it was just like,\n\n54:17.000 --> 54:19.000\none of the most delightful parts of the Sony leaks\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:22.000\nwas Channing Tatum's email to everybody at Sony\n\n54:22.000 --> 54:24.000\ngoing, yeah, bitches, we did it!\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:27.000\nLike, because they just made,\n\n54:27.000 --> 54:30.000\nlike, $740 billion in an hour,\n\n54:30.000 --> 54:32.000\nI don't even know which movie it was,\n\n54:32.000 --> 54:34.000\nGodzilla vs. Men in Black or whatever,\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:35.000\nI don't know.\n\n54:35.000 --> 54:36.000\nIt doesn't matter,\n\n54:36.000 --> 54:38.000\nbut Channing Tatum was involved,\n\n54:38.000 --> 54:40.000\nand he was like, yeah, bitches!\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:43.000\nHe was using C's and exclamation points.\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:46.000\nThere's gotta be a high-five emoticon.\n\n54:46.000 --> 54:49.000\nBut it really has nothing to do with whether or not\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:51.000\nI'm not saying whatever he was talking about\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:52.000\nwas a bad movie.\n\n54:52.000 --> 54:54.000\nI'm saying it was completely disconnected\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:56.000\nfrom whether it was a good or bad movie.\n\n54:56.000 --> 54:59.000\nAnd because, like, Jeff is saying,\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:01.000\noh, that must have been a great time to be alive\n\n55:01.000 --> 55:02.000\nall these comedy movies.\n\n55:02.000 --> 55:04.000\nI'm gonna assume, God, no.\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:06.000\nI'm assuming that just meant that\n\n55:06.000 --> 55:09.000\nmore hilarious people were being told\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:11.000\nmore times per minute,\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:13.000\nyou really fucked up.\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:15.000\nI can't believe you were in that piece of shit.\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:16.000\nBe in it!\n\n55:16.000 --> 55:17.000\nIt was a piece of shit.\n\n55:17.000 --> 55:18.000\nI never said that.\n\n55:18.000 --> 55:20.000\nWhy would I do that?\n\n55:20.000 --> 55:22.000\nI work for Mike Ovitz, God damn it.\n\n55:22.000 --> 55:23.000\nI was recently...\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:27.000\nI just did Coke off of the small world ride.\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:35.000\nI was in a talking horse movie\n\n55:35.000 --> 55:37.000\nthat put me in comedy jail.\n\n55:37.000 --> 55:39.000\nEnded my career.\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:40.000\nComedy jail.\n\n55:40.000 --> 55:41.000\nAnd I look at the...\n\n55:41.000 --> 55:43.000\nI was just recently moving,\n\n55:43.000 --> 55:46.000\nI found the script and I scribbled on it\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:48.000\nand sent it back to my manager.\n\n55:48.000 --> 55:50.000\nI go, why would I do this?\n\n55:50.000 --> 55:53.000\nAnd then he had written a dollar sign on it.\n\n55:53.000 --> 55:58.000\nI'm shameful telling this.\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:00.000\nWell, they're the opposite of therapists.\n\n56:00.000 --> 56:03.000\nThe agents tell you that you should worry about\n\n56:03.000 --> 56:05.000\neverything and money matters.\n\n56:05.000 --> 56:09.000\nAnd then you go to therapy and it's like, no.\n\n56:09.000 --> 56:11.000\nIt's true.\n\n56:11.000 --> 56:16.000\nI just make my movies so far out of the system.\n\n56:16.000 --> 56:19.000\nI love working on community.\n\n56:19.000 --> 56:22.000\nI love working on people's shows that I respect\n\n56:22.000 --> 56:24.000\nand have fun and that's great.\n\n56:24.000 --> 56:26.000\nAnd then I go make these movies.\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:29.000\nAnd I don't mean to throw my agent under the bus.\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:30.000\nI'm not going to be specific.\n\n56:30.000 --> 56:33.000\nOne of my agents, that way I can get him off the hook.\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:38.000\nBut he called me up and he says,\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:42.000\nhey, Sundance.\n\n56:42.000 --> 56:44.000\nI go, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n56:44.000 --> 56:46.000\nYou made another movie.\n\n56:46.000 --> 56:50.000\nThat's an actual quote.\n\n56:50.000 --> 56:52.000\nI was like...\n\n56:52.000 --> 56:54.000\nI feel like...\n\n56:54.000 --> 56:56.000\nHe wasn't along for the ride?\n\n56:56.000 --> 56:57.000\nNo.\n\n56:57.000 --> 57:00.000\nI just go do him and then let them catch up.\n\n57:00.000 --> 57:01.000\nWow.\n\n57:01.000 --> 57:02.000\nI don't know.\n\n57:02.000 --> 57:04.000\nWhat's your agency?\n\n57:04.000 --> 57:06.000\nIs that a personal question?\n\n57:06.000 --> 57:08.000\nYeah.\n\n57:08.000 --> 57:10.000\nI was just wondering if you're a UTA or not.\n\n57:10.000 --> 57:12.000\nBut I was a...\n\n57:12.000 --> 57:14.000\nI didn't...\n\n57:14.000 --> 57:16.000\nI think it was an age thing.\n\n57:16.000 --> 57:18.000\nAnd I think I regarded as like...\n\n57:18.000 --> 57:20.000\nOh, I guess I made it.\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:23.000\nI'm like a character in a movie about people that make things\n\n57:23.000 --> 57:26.000\nbecause I had a meeting at my agency\n\n57:26.000 --> 57:28.000\nand I went to the wrong building.\n\n57:28.000 --> 57:30.000\nThey had moved four years ago.\n\n57:30.000 --> 57:32.000\nBecause I don't...\n\n57:32.000 --> 57:34.000\nI'm an autopilot.\n\n57:34.000 --> 57:37.000\nAnd somebody goes, oh, what's that dumb fuck doing?\n\n57:37.000 --> 57:39.000\nIf they want to be in business with a dumb fuck, they...\n\n57:39.000 --> 57:43.000\nDo they ever send you things for you to...\n\n57:43.000 --> 57:45.000\nYou know what I mean? That you didn't create?\n\n57:45.000 --> 57:46.000\nYeah.\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:48.000\nI mean, especially now that I'm trying to do this studio thing,\n\n57:48.000 --> 57:50.000\nyou know, I'm trying to become a suit\n\n57:50.000 --> 57:52.000\nbecause I'm a fucking horrible, self-destructive person.\n\n57:52.000 --> 57:53.000\nOh, okay.\n\n57:53.000 --> 57:55.000\nAnd really insecure.\n\n57:55.000 --> 57:56.000\nBut I'm trying to...\n\n57:56.000 --> 57:59.000\nBecause I get scripts which is new for me.\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:02.000\nAnd then I should just read my emails.\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:04.000\nIt was just, this is a very well-written script\n\n58:04.000 --> 58:08.000\nand I hate everyone who wrote it.\n\n58:08.000 --> 58:14.000\nIf I ever see them, I'm going to punch them all in the throat.\n\n58:14.000 --> 58:15.000\nIt's a pass.\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:17.000\nAnd then I wrote PS.\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:19.000\nIf this email does get hacked by the North Koreans,\n\n58:19.000 --> 58:22.000\nI'm a really big fan of their irreverent brand of humor.\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:26.000\nAnd I wish them more continued success.\n\n58:26.000 --> 58:28.000\nYeah, I mean, I think at a certain point...\n\n58:28.000 --> 58:32.000\nBecause I think...\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:34.000\nIt's that movie archetype of like,\n\n58:34.000 --> 58:36.000\nyour agent should just have the pork pie hat\n\n58:36.000 --> 58:38.000\nand he's just like the really old guy\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:41.000\nthat's just like, you can't leave him now.\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:43.000\nAnd he's just like, I tell him when they call you,\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:45.000\nyou know the Bobcat deal?\n\n58:45.000 --> 58:47.000\nThe Bobcat deal is a million per script.\n\n58:47.000 --> 58:49.000\nYou're just kind of like, well,\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:53.000\nat a certain point, you're just out there,\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:56.000\nlike a log floating on a lake.\n\n58:56.000 --> 58:59.000\nLike, you know, the importance of representation\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:01.000\nbecomes slightly diminished.\n\n59:01.000 --> 59:04.000\nWell, it certainly doesn't help\n\n59:04.000 --> 59:07.000\nin the types of movies I'm trying to make, you know?\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:10.000\nSo I just don't waste their time with that stuff.\n\n59:10.000 --> 59:11.000\nRight.\n\n59:11.000 --> 59:12.000\nBecause then they...\n\n59:12.000 --> 59:13.000\nI don't resent them.\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:14.000\nThey'll probably try to talk you out of it.\n\n59:14.000 --> 59:16.000\nHey, Bob, are you still doing the kinks thing\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:17.000\nor can we talk about that?\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:18.000\nYeah, I mean, that's my dream project,\n\n59:18.000 --> 59:20.000\nis that I wrote a screenplay\n\n59:20.000 --> 59:22.000\nbased on School Boys and the Scraze\n\n59:22.000 --> 59:25.000\nand Ray Davis has been very involved and encouraging.\n\n59:25.000 --> 59:27.000\nThat's one I hope you make.\n\n59:27.000 --> 59:28.000\nI hope so too.\n\n59:28.000 --> 59:30.000\nWell, you know, it's frustrating\n\n59:30.000 --> 59:33.000\nbecause it's, you know,\n\n59:33.000 --> 59:36.000\ndudes in a high school basically singing.\n\n59:36.000 --> 59:38.000\nIt seems like that formula's worked before.\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:42.000\nI don't know why people are really so skittish around it,\n\n59:42.000 --> 59:43.000\nbut I don't know.\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:46.000\nIt's not like I'm coming to them with, you know...\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:47.000\nWhat's your relationship?\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:49.000\nIt's like, hey, did he do a musical?\n\n59:49.000 --> 59:51.000\nNo, but he did that baby rape doc\n\n59:51.000 --> 59:53.000\nand he did a Bigfoot movie.\n\n59:53.000 --> 59:55.000\nHe's your man.\n\n59:55.000 --> 59:58.000\nSo of course you should do a musical,\n\n59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000\nbut I don't know what's going to go next.\n\n01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nI also wrote this Gay Billy Jack movie, which is...\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000\nGay Billy Jack?\n\n01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000\nWell, he's not like, yeah.\n\n01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000\nI just watched Billy Jack again a couple of days ago,\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000\nlike two days ago, cry to the end,\n\n01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000\nbecause when Tin Soul just starts playing the end of that...\n\n01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000\nYou have to turn to Billy Jack.\n\n01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000\nWell, the first one.\n\n01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000\nYeah.\n\n01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000\nWell, there's Born Losers.\n\n01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000\nI'm a big Billy Jack fan.\n\n01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.000\nIf you guys have not seen Billy Jack, it's all that's great\n\n01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000\nabout the 70s.\n\n01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000\nBut he kicks ass.\n\n01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000\nHe kicks ass.\n\n01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nIt's actually politics, but really violent.\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000\nIt's about civil rights,\n\n01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000\nand it's about anti-establishmentism,\n\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000\nArianism, and not Arianism.\n\n01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000\nThat's not about Arianism.\n\n01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000\nYeah, you lost me.\n\n01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000\nBut anti-establishmism, Arianism,\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000\nand a little bit of Naziism.\n\n01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000\nIn the 70s, there had to be kung fu and karate,\n\n01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000\nat all times.\n\n01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000\nIt's so fucking good.\n\n01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000\nIt's progressive politics with violence.\n\n01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000\nIt's such a beautiful mixture, but...\n\n01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000\nI'm really proud of Jeff for resisting the urge,\n\n01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000\nbecause what he really wants to do,\n\n01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000\nbecause I know he knows it by heart,\n\n01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000\nhe wants to do the Billy Jack.\n\n01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000\nThe speech.\n\n01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000\nWhen I see what you do.\n\n01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000\nYou know, Bernard.\n\n01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000\nYou know Bernard.\n\n01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.000\nWhen Jill and the kids up at the school tell me\n\n01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000\nnot to be violent and to be non-violent,\n\n01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000\nI try.\n\n01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000\nI really try.\n\n01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000\nI'll do the whole thing.\n\n01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000\nI'm not gonna fucking do it.\n\n01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000\nNo, keep going.\n\n01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000\nCome on, just do it.\n\n01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000\nCome on.\n\n01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000\nThat's just the tip.\n\n01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000\nDo it.\n\n01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000\nYou can't stop now.\n\n01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000\nBobcat, you know what I'm talking about?\n\n01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000\nThe ice cream shop.\n\n01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000\nOf course.\n\n01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000\nOf course.\n\n01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000\nBut when I see...\n\n01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000\nWhen I see what you did.\n\n01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000\nWhen I see this flower.\n\n01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000\nYou know what we call her back at the...\n\n01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000\nWe call her God's little gift of sunshine.\n\n01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000\nAnd when I see this boy so degraded,\n\n01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000\nand when I think of a number of years,\n\n01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000\nand he's gonna have to live,\n\n01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000\nwith his memory,\n\n01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000\nthis itty-ottic moment of yours,\n\n01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.000\nI just go, BASIC!\n\n01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000\nYeah.\n\n01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000\nNow, so, I'm not Jeff's agent,\n\n01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000\nand he's not auditioning for Gay Billy Jack,\n\n01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000\nbut...\n\n01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000\nYeah.\n\n01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000\nSo...\n\n01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000\nPlease, so...\n\n01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000\nEverybody, you took that fucking scene\n\n01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000\nand stuck it.\n\n01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000\nSo, my ex-wife, I said to her,\n\n01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000\nI was like,\n\n01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000\nDude, I can't do this anymore.\n\n01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000\nI'm so tired of being broke.\n\n01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000\nI'm gonna write a genre picture.\n\n01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000\nPlease.\n\n01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000\nAnd I go,\n\n01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000\nI love Billy Jack.\n\n01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000\nI'm gonna write a genre picture.\n\n01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000\nI'm gonna write a Billy Jack movie.\n\n01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000\nSo, I'm down there writing.\n\n01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000\nAnd she goes,\n\n01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000\nHow's it going?\n\n01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000\nI go,\n\n01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000\nI'm good.\n\n01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000\nI'm good.\n\n01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000\nShe goes,\n\n01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000\nHow long you in?\n\n01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000\nI go,\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000\nI'm gay now.\n\n01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000\nAnd she goes,\n\n01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000\nSo, we're just gonna keep renting, huh?\n\n01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000\nGo ahead and hate your name.\n\n01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000\nGo ahead and cheat a fag.\n\n01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000\nThat's what,\n\n01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000\nthat's the whole thing.\n\n01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000\nLike, he goes into this town,\n\n01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000\nhe's trying to drink his whiskey,\n\n01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000\nand someone calls him a fag,\n\n01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000\nand he's gonna,\n\n01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000\nhe says,\n\n01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000\nI'm gonna have to ask you to stop using that word.\n\n01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000\nYes.\n\n01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000\nAnd he goes,\n\n01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000\nHe's like,\n\n01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000\nWhat are you gonna do about it?\n\n01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000\nFag, he goes,\n\n01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000\nWell, I'm gonna dislocate his shoulder.\n\n01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000\nI'm gonna fracture his kneecap.\n\n01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000\nI'm gonna shatter,\n\n01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000\nNo, and he goes,\n\n01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000\nOh, then he says,\n\n01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000\nI fucked up.\n\n01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000\nAnd he goes,\n\n01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000\nAnd I'm gonna shatter your windpipe.\n\n01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000\nAnd you wanna know something?\n\n01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000\nIt's not a goddamn thing to do.\n\n01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000\nIt's not a goddamn thing you do about it.\n\n01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000\nAnd then,\n\n01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000\nAnd then,\n\n01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000\nIn the script it says,\n\n01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000\nIt's just,\n\n01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000\nIt's the simplest direction I've ever written.\n\n01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000\nIt just says,\n\n01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000\nAnd he does.\n\n01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000\nSo then,\n\n01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000\nSo then he walks back over to the bartender,\n\n01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000\nAnd he finally finishes his whiskey,\n\n01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000\nAnd he throws it down.\n\n01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000\nHe says,\n\n01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000\nIs there a decent place for a man to stay in this town?\n\n01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000\nAnd then it,\n\n01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nIt's smash cuts to him,\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000\nWaking up in bed with the bartender.\n\n01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000\nBut,\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000\nBut,\n\n01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000\nI gotta say,\n\n01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000\nThis scene sounds funny.\n\n01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000\nMake this movie.\n\n01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000\nBut,\n\n01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000\nJeff.\n\n01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000\nBut,\n\n01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000\nIf I'm not the fucking Billy Jack.\n\n01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000\nBut I have to say,\n\n01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000\nI know this sounds like it's a joke,\n\n01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000\nBut you know,\n\n01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000\nI really do kind of explore,\n\n01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000\nYou know,\n\n01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000\nAll this stuff about,\n\n01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000\nWhat's it like being a gay man,\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000\nAnd what defines,\n\n01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000\nYou know,\n\n01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000\nSexuality,\n\n01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000\nAnd,\n\n01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000\nYeah, I know.\n\n01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000\nWhat the fuck is wrong with me?\n\n01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000\nI'm so uncommercial.\n\n01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000\nI have no idea.\n\n01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000\nWell, yeah,\n\n01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000\nI don't think you have to tell you.\n\n01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000\nYeah,\n\n01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000\nI would,\n\n01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000\nI would assume when you told me that,\n\n01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000\nLike,\n\n01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000\nYeah,\n\n01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000\nThat you weren't like,\n\n01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000\nThis is hilarious.\n\n01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000\nThese faggots are gonna hate this.\n\n01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000\nRight,\n\n01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000\nRight,\n\n01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000\nExactly.\n\n01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000\nI'm finally letting them have it,\n\n01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000\nSee?\n\n01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nYeah,\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000\nIn a studio picture,\n\n01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000\nIt would have been like,\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000\nHello?\n\n01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000\nIt's like a boat trip.\n\n01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000\nBoat trip is like a god damn fucking psychedelic,\n\n01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000\nBoat trip is a fucking atom bomb.\n\n01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000\nVia Huasca spirit vision.\n\n01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000\nBoat trip is one of the most amazing,\n\n01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000\nIf you've not seen boat trip,\n\n01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000\nCuba Gooding Jr.,\n\n01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000\nAnd a series of other culprits,\n\n01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000\nMake a movie.\n\n01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000\nIt's two guys,\n\n01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000\nSomehow,\n\n01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000\nI think,\n\n01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000\nI don't know how you feel about it.\n\n01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000\nI think what happened is,\n\n01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000\nSomebody was getting fired,\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000\nAt one of the oldest agencies in the world,\n\n01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000\nAnd their fingers locked on their filing cabinet,\n\n01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000\nWhich chipped over,\n\n01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000\nSo there was finally the script visible underneath it,\n\n01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000\nAnd then the cleaning lady at the,\n\n01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000\nOr cleaning man,\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000\nAt the agency,\n\n01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000\nOr you know,\n\n01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000\nCleaning person,\n\n01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000\nAnd they were like,\n\n01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000\nNice save,\n\n01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000\nThey put it on top of the pile,\n\n01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000\nIt was on the bottom,\n\n01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000\nIt was like a Brazil thing,\n\n01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000\nAnd the movie got green lit,\n\n01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000\nThat's a boat trip.\n\n01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000\nAre you sure this is the movie\n\n01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000\nThat was supposed to be green lit?\n\n01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000\nTwo guys,\n\n01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000\nThat is on the top of the desk.\n\n01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000\nThey go on a boat,\n\n01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000\nAnd then they find out the first,\n\n01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000\nIt's a gay boat,\n\n01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000\nWe're on a gay boat,\n\n01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000\nWe're on a gay boat.\n\n01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000\nAnd then they have to pretend to be gay,\n\n01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000\nOr they're gonna kick off the boat,\n\n01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000\nAnd you know,\n\n01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000\nThe gay guys get to look at six tits if they want,\n\n01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000\nBecause six don't care if gay guys look at their tits.\n\n01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.000\nThose aren't some real high stakes.\n\n01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000\nThe movie is like,\n\n01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000\nThe movie includes Cuba Gooding Jr.\n\n01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000\nComing out of a porthole,\n\n01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000\nInto the open air,\n\n01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nAnd his cum splatters on someone's face.\n\n01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000\nHe had won an Oscar\n\n01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000\n30 seconds before this movie was made.\n\n01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000\nAnd then there were like nine movies,\n\n01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000\nLike Cuba Gooding Jr.\n\n01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000\nAnd then had nine movies with talking dogs,\n\n01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000\nAnd gay jokes in them.\n\n01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000\nWhat does the cum land on?\n\n01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000\nThe cum goes out the porthole?\n\n01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000\nThe cum just lands on a person.\n\n01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000\nAnd then you go like,\n\n01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000\nOh, what about that?\n\n01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000\nCrazy summer, that was a chili dog.\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000\nThat's right.\n\n01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000\nAnd it landed on my friend Tony V.\n\n01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000\nAnd his famous line was,\n\n01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000\nYou kids?\n\n01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000\nYeah, that's right.\n\n01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000\nTony V.\n\n01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000\nHere's one of the weirdest things\n\n01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000\nTo look for in boat trip\n\n01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000\nWhen you rent it tonight, kids.\n\n01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000\nI'd like to mention that all my movies\n\n01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000\nAre available on digital platforms.\n\n01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000\nYou don't necessarily have to watch boat trips.\n\n01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000\nBut you'll only be encouraging him.\n\n01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000\nHe's a documentary filmmaker now.\n\n01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000\nWatch him after boat trip.\n\n01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000\nWatch boat trip first.\n\n01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000\nDon't encourage his phase of like,\n\n01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000\nI hate America.\n\n01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000\nI'm gonna tour.\n\n01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000\nI hate America.\n\n01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000\nI'm gonna go to France.\n\n01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000\nThere's a scene in boat trip\n\n01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000\nWhere Cuba Gooding Jr.\n\n01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000\nIs in love with the woman who thinks that he's gay\n\n01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000\nBecause that's what he has had to do\n\n01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000\nTo survive on the boat.\n\n01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000\nThe gay man.\n\n01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000\nWhich affords him the ironic chance\n\n01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000\nTo be in close quarters with her.\n\n01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000\nShe's confiding with him about her single life\n\n01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000\nAnd how she wishes she could find a man.\n\n01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000\nAnd if he just keeps lisping and enough\n\n01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000\nThen he gets to be with her.\n\n01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000\nAnd so it's very uncomfortable for him.\n\n01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000\nAnd at one point, the topic of conversation\n\n01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000\nSomehow comes to, it either comes to\n\n01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000\nHow are you supposed to eat a banana\n\n01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000\nOr how are you supposed to suck a dick.\n\n01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000\nBut in any case, she picks up a banana,\n\n01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000\nPeels the banana to show him how she sucks\n\n01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000\nDick.\n\n01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000\nAnd so the joke is that he's going like\n\n01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000\nHa, ha, I can't believe it.\n\n01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000\nOh, she's sucking a banana dick in front of me.\n\n01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000\nThe crazy thing, the crazy thing about it\n\n01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000\nIf you watch the movie in high def\n\n01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000\nLike, you can see his credibility\n\n01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000\nLeave the back of his head.\n\n01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000\nOf her licking the tip of the banana\n\n01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000\nIt's unmistakable.\n\n01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000\nThe prop master for some reason\n\n01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000\nHas like, well not for some reason\n\n01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000\nFor some, I mean there's some disconnect\n\n01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000\nBetween industry and government\n\n01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000\nAnd then the society.\n\n01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000\nLike the prop master has taken like a tool\n\n01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:46.000\nAnd shaped like a visible penis head\n\n01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000\nInto the tip of the banana.\n\n01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000\nAnd I love all prop masters that have ever worked with me\n\n01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000\nYou're the fucking best, you're wizards\n\n01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000\nYou collaborate well, I have respect for your craft\n\n01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000\nBut this is exactly the kind of thing that, you know\n\n01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000\nThat you gotta step on.\n\n01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000\nIf you were to take a late lunch\n\n01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000\nYou might find out that someone was like\n\n01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000\nYeah, well then it says in the script\n\n01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000\nIt's like a dick, so I, what do I do?\n\n01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000\nI fucking, I'm gonna get a raise today\n\n01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000\nI'm gonna make it like a dick\n\n01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000\nAnd then you go like, why are you making a banana\n\n01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000\nLike a dick that makes no sense\n\n01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000\nThat's just, that's just, that's just so, that's just so sense\n\n01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000\nBut everyone on the set must have been like\n\n01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000\nIt looks like a dick.\n\n01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000\nJohnny, Johnny, get back to the set\n\n01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000\nWe're making a hit\n\n01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000\nThe banana, the banana looks like a dick\n\n01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000\nGet back here\n\n01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:44.000\nAnd universal and Fox and Roobert Murdock\n\n01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000\nShe's like looking and it looks like a dick\n\n01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.760\nIt looks like a dick that carved a dick out of a banana.\n\n01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:51.200\nIt makes no, it's so insane.\n\n01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:55.840\nDo you think somebody just looked at the banana and was like,\n\n01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:57.760\nI don't know if this reads like a dick.\n\n01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:01.760\nIt doesn't, it doesn't, it could have just been one.\n\n01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:02.960\nDo you think it was a studio note?\n\n01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:05.520\nI don't know, it's like, I eat bananas like that\n\n01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:06.440\nand I'm not born to eat.\n\n01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.400\nCan we make the, can we make the, can she be,\n\n01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:11.400\nI feel like the banana doesn't read as a cock.\n\n01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:12.240\nCan I feel like me?\n\n01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:13.720\nCan she be holding some Kiwis?\n\n01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:17.080\nYeah, it's the same guy who kept saying,\n\n01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:19.720\nI'm telling you this should be called gay boat trip.\n\n01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:23.880\nI don't, I don't know why you're, you're PCing the title.\n\n01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.320\nIt should be called gay boat trip.\n\n01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:29.080\nWe did, we did, we did tests on the title.\n\n01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:30.400\nPeople don't care about boats.\n\n01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:31.520\nWe said gay boat trip.\n\n01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.120\nThey know the movie we're talking about.\n\n01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:37.560\nIt's Kuba Gooding Jr. and Carlos, Carlos, who is it?\n\n01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:38.640\nCarlos?\n\n01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:41.960\nNo, no, no, no, no, it was Horatio Sands.\n\n01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:45.520\nHoratio Sands, whom we love and adore.\n\n01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:47.920\nI don't think everybody has to go home and watch it.\n\n01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:51.080\nThey already did.\n\n01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:54.560\nHave you gone off on a boat trip ramp before?\n\n01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:56.800\nNo, I don't think so.\n\n01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.400\nIt's possible, it's possible.\n\n01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.000\nI mean, I'm not busting your chops.\n\n01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.240\nI didn't know if that was like what frost is your cake.\n\n01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.080\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:07.560\nLike, I guess I, I see that boat trip one more time.\n\n01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:08.640\nNo, I mean, that's just, I mean.\n\n01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.200\nI'm gonna come so hard.\n\n01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:13.560\nI, what frost, what frost to my cake is inscrutability.\n\n01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.040\nLike, I, like, shit that, like, when you look into it,\n\n01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.480\nyou can't find even the, even the most course,\n\n01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:22.120\ncrass, cynical explanation for it.\n\n01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:22.960\nYeah.\n\n01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:23.800\nLike, we used to have a-\n\n01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.640\nBut I think movies like that make it, like, you know,\n\n01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:28.920\nlike I did Sleeping Dogs Lie, it was called Stay Originally,\n\n01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:32.280\nbut it's a rom-com, not a rom-com,\n\n01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:34.200\nit's kind of a little bit more my stab at trying\n\n01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.160\nto do a Woody Allen movie, but it,\n\n01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:39.200\nwith a tiny bit of bestiality in it.\n\n01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.480\nJust a little bit of bestiality.\n\n01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:41.400\nJust a hint?\n\n01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.240\nYeah.\n\n01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:44.080\nJust a whisper of bestiality.\n\n01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:44.920\nIt's a back story.\n\n01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:45.760\nIt's just so.\n\n01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.600\nBut I think when people-\n\n01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:47.440\nIt's just so.\n\n01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.600\nIt's just so.\n\n01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:51.280\nBut I think when people hear about it,\n\n01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.840\nthey think that's what they're gonna see, you know,\n\n01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:55.760\nan actual shot of her spitting dog semen out\n\n01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:56.960\nand all this stuff, you know,\n\n01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:00.120\nand the joke isn't like making fun of her character,\n\n01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:03.760\nit's actually about, you know, how there's things\n\n01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:06.240\nin our past that other people can't get past,\n\n01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:08.240\nand she learns in that movie at the end,\n\n01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.960\nshe says, you know, I learned it's the living up\n\n01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:11.680\nto the lies that we tell about ourselves\n\n01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:13.160\nthat make us better people.\n\n01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.480\nYeah.\n\n01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:16.960\nBy the way, they made the same movie with an avalanche,\n\n01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:19.560\nand everyone's like, now I accept it.\n\n01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:20.640\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:25.640\nThe cat, in your movie, she fucks a dog, but yeah.\n\n01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:28.400\nBut it's all off camera, and it's,\n\n01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:30.360\nI remember getting this note.\n\n01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:31.600\nOh, the avalanche never kills him.\n\n01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:36.120\nI gotta know that was, could she just jerk the dog off?\n\n01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:41.120\nYeah, I swear to God, I was like, what the fuck?\n\n01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.200\nWhich is actually weirder, right?\n\n01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:47.040\nYeah.\n\n01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:49.560\nDoes anyone be like looking at the dog, you know, yeah.\n\n01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:54.560\nLike why would you, yeah, you're invested in the,\n\n01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:57.320\nthe dog doesn't need that, like that's just about.\n\n01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:59.760\nYeah, you know, she says it's like something weird,\n\n01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.680\nyou know, that's like touching a toaster that,\n\n01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:03.440\nyou know, is hot, it was, you know,\n\n01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:06.040\nshe's not in the beastiality, it was just this weird thing.\n\n01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:07.360\nIt was about something that happened\n\n01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:08.200\nin the course of life.\n\n01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:09.920\nYeah, and I needed something that people couldn't get past.\n\n01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:12.000\nJerking off a dog can only happen\n\n01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.440\nas the result of planning.\n\n01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:14.840\nPlus, if you told somebody else,\n\n01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:16.360\njust like, you know, once I jerked off a dog,\n\n01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:18.280\nyou go, yeah, that's fucking weird.\n\n01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:20.120\nYou wouldn't.\n\n01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:24.640\n40% of the people do, I did too, in a barn, on a bed.\n\n01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:26.680\nThat's what it is, so, and that, by the way,\n\n01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:28.920\nwhen that movie came out, oh my God,\n\n01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:30.360\npeople would be like that, you know,\n\n01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:31.800\nthe point of that movie was, you know,\n\n01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:37.040\nit's okay to lie, and because sometimes people\n\n01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:39.480\ntell the truth, and they're not being kind,\n\n01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:42.200\nand, but man, as soon as that movie,\n\n01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.960\nlike the lights go up, people go, I'll tell you what,\n\n01:13:44.960 -->

her friend talks her into staying,\n\n01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:40.880\nand about 50 minutes into the movie,\n\n01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:43.600\nthat same woman was crying watching the

friends, they don't have a great relationship\n\n01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:15.720\nwith their parents, or they hate their brother,\n\n01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:17.360\nor they hate their sister, and there's

01:16:36.440\nI feel like you have the same relationship with her,\n\n01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:37.920\nalthough I don't know her.\n\n01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:38.960\nIt's always, but...\n\n01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:40.440\nWell, you have to take my word for it then.\n\n01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:43.040\nI will, but I mean, I think we take your word\n\n01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:45.040\nfor everything because you deal in sincerity,\n\n01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:47.280\nand I don't think you would ever dissemble\n\n01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.320\nabout something like that.\n\n01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:49.160\nNo.\n\n01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:53.560\nThat's everything that we like about you, too,\n\n01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:56.840\nas individuals, the fact that you have a great relationship\n\n01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:59.640\nwith your daughter is really remarkable.\n\n01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:03.200\nWell, you know, I have to tell you, when I met Bob,\n\n01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:09.120\nhe was the first actor I think I'd worked with\n\n01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:13.760\nin Hollywood, who's politics,\n\n01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:17.440\nand particularly gender politics mirrored mine.\n\n01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.520\nI thought that was so cool,\n\n01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:21.480\nbecause there were not many of us.\n\n01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:22.320\nJust two of you, eight and women.\n\n01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:23.640\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:28.480\nNo, and not, because this is like one of our first movies.\n\n01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:31.720\nIt's like, you know what, this movie is less Jimmy Moore.\n\n01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:33.240\nI just...\n\n01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:34.760\nI said Moore and Moore.\n\n01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:42.120\nNo, and I met you, and I just assumed,\n\n01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:44.200\noh, everybody in Hollywood's chill.\n\n01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.440\nYeah, because that was one of my first movies.\n\n01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:48.720\nYeah, I was quite naive about the thing.\n\n01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:51.480\nBut so we all know each other,\n\n01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:54.080\nbecause Eric Idle and his wife, Tanya,\n\n01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.400\nand they have a daughter, Lily,\n\n01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:59.240\nand my daughter grew up with Lily Idle as a friend.\n\n01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:04.240\nSo I was on Arsenio Hall when he got fired,\n\n01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:09.280\nand so I walked out and I sprayed paint\n\n01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:11.920\nand Paramount sucks on the backdrop of the set,\n\n01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:14.840\nand then I took the monitor,\n\n01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:17.440\nwhich cost three grand I found out later on,\n\n01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:20.600\nand smashed it and put my feet through it\n\n01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:21.680\nwith my Doc Martins.\n\n01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:22.960\nIt was totally premeditated,\n\n01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:24.840\nbecause I was like, my Chuck Taylor's are gonna...\n\n01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:25.680\nYeah.\n\n01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:27.840\nYeah, I need to wear my fucking steel-toed docks.\n\n01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:28.680\nGuess what fucking steel-toed?\n\n01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:29.680\nBecause the monitor's getting fucked up.\n\n01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:30.520\n12 holes.\n\n01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:31.360\n12 holes?\n\n01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:32.560\nYeah, yeah, yeah, when I'm a baby.\n\n01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:33.400\nSo...\n\n01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:38.120\nSo, you know, if we were making the movie,\n\n01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:39.880\nit's the guy getting ready for war, you know?\n\n01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:41.600\nI mean, what he needs, you know, the weaponry,\n\n01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:43.000\nyou know, so I got my Doc Martins,\n\n01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000\nI'm ready to go smash up the Arsenio Hall show,\n\n01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.040\nand I throw the mattresses into the audience, and...\n\n01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:51.320\nWhy were there mattresses?\n\n01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:54.520\nThe cushions from the couch,\n\n01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.600\nand then the producers, like, say, get him,\n\n01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:59.160\nand Arsenio tackles me,\n\n01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:00.480\nand as we're going to a commercial,\n\n01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:02.720\nhe whispers in my ear, he goes, thank you.\n\n01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:09.720\nAnd so, I leave the show acting like no big deal,\n\n01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:12.600\nand I'm now coloring with my daughter,\n\n01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.240\nand she's eight, and we're coloring.\n\n01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:15.080\nOh, my God.\n\n01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:16.360\nAnd then the news comes on, it goes,\n\n01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:19.640\ncomedian goes berserk on the Arsenio Hall show.\n\n01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:22.440\nAnd Tasha goes, ugh.\n\n01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:24.280\nI go, what?\n\n01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:25.240\nShe goes, sometimes you act like\n\n01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:26.720\nyou don't have a brain in your head.\n\n01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:27.560\nAh!\n\n01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:31.720\nAnd I go, but it was just a bit.\n\n01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:33.000\nIt's just comedy.\n\n01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.520\nShe goes, if it was comedy, it wouldn't be on the news.\n\n01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:37.080\nAh!\n\n01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:39.200\nAnd then she goes, then she goes,\n\n01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:41.440\nLily's dad's not on the news.\n\n01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:42.280\nAh!\n\n01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:43.120\nAh!\n\n01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:43.960\nAh!\n\n01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:44.800\nAh!\n\n01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:45.800\nEight years old?\n\n01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:46.640\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:49.200\nBecause Tasha, Tasha is smarter than all of us, right?\n\n01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:50.040\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:51.000\nShe totally is.\n\n01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.280\nI like that she was doing the math.\n\n01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:55.200\nShe goes, whoa, hey, no, her dad's in dresses.\n\n01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:57.920\nBut I used to always, ever since high school,\n\n01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:00.640\nI used to wear dresses, you know, like skirts,\n\n01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:03.640\nand it wasn't, it was not, and I didn't do it for camp,\n\n01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:05.640\nit was my way of saying, you know,\n\n01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:07.840\nif you go to a football part and you show up\n\n01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:09.960\nin some smart looking coolot,\n\n01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:13.800\nit fucks up the football team harder than anything, you know.\n\n01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.280\nI like that you had smart coolots.\n\n01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:16.520\nI had very smart.\n\n01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:18.040\nSo I was always like wearing skirts and stuff,\n\n01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.280\nand when Tasha was little, I'd always be in a skirt,\n\n01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:22.920\nand then one day I woke her up for school,\n\n01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:25.160\nand she goes, dad, I've never seen that sweater.\n\n01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:26.040\nAnd she goes, yeah, she goes,\n\n01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:28.120\nthat would go so well with your brown skirt.\n\n01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:28.960\nAh!\n\n01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:29.800\nAh!\n\n01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:30.640\nAh!\n\n01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:33.440\nAnd I was like, yeah, you're right, you know.\n\n01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:36.400\nCan we do a show where we bring Tasha and you out?\n\n01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.480\nI wonder if she would do it.\n\n01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.320\nThat's pretty funny.\n\n01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:40.000\nShe must because she's fucking groovy.\n\n01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:40.840\nYeah.\n\n01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:41.680\nWell, now that's all built up.\n\n01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:42.520\nI don't know.\n\n01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:44.120\nIf she's really smart, she'll stay away, right?\n\n01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:44.960\nYeah.\n\n01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:45.800\nYeah.\n\n01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:47.360\nI mean, she sounds like the kind of person\n\n01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.320\nthat would be like, no, fuck that.\n\n01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:50.400\nCurtis, how's your daughter doing?\n\n01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:51.880\nShe's in Europe still?\n\n01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:53.400\nYeah, she's in London, yeah.\n\n01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:57.520\nShe just produced her first night of music\n\n01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.400\nat Shacklewell Arms.\n\n01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.360\nThree bads.\n\n01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:05.560\nShe is now going places.\n\n01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:06.520\nThat's so cool.\n\n01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:07.640\n19.\n\n01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:10.120\nI wish I had a daughter that was a genius.\n\n01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:11.040\nThat would be so cool.\n\n01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:11.920\nI know.\n\n01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:12.480\nIt's fun.\n\n01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:12.960\nYou may.\n\n01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:19.120\nYou mean I might already?\n\n01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:21.000\nYou may.\n\n01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.720\nYou're a randy little goat.\n\n01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:28.720\nThat tour in Nam we did, man.\n\n01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:30.960\nIt's not like we were being careful about anything\n\n01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:33.960\nbut protecting democracy.\n\n01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:34.760\nLet me rewrite that.\n\n01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:36.080\nLet me rewrite that.\n\n01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:40.440\nIt's not like we were protecting anything but democracy.\n\n01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:41.880\nObviously less of a laugh, but you've\n\n01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:43.080\nspliced it together in a little.\n\n01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:46.560\nIt's not important.\n\n01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:47.960\nI'm not.\n\n01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:53.080\nI mean, in the realm of male comedians especially,\n\n01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:57.840\nthe amount of misogyny, there's so much women\n\n01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:59.400\nhating in male comics.\n\n01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:01.400\nIt's kind of axiomatic.\n\n01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:07.440\nIt's very cool and very respectable that there's\n\n01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:09.920\ntwo guys that you guys have been doing comedy for so long\n\n01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:14.400\nand you have a female daughter that you look up to and like.\n\n01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.520\nThat takes a lot of balls to have a female daughter.\n\n01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.600\nI think if we just have a daughter,\n\n01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:26.720\nnope, she's going to be a female daughter.\n\n01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:27.640\nYou know what I'm fucking saying.\n\n01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:29.320\nBut thank you.\n\n01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:32.440\nIt's there's so much misogyny.\n\n01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:36.520\nAlso in comedians, misanthropy, like across the board,\n\n01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:38.840\nthe fact that you look up to the women in your life\n\n01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:40.320\nmakes me very, very happy.\n\n01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.160\nAnd I've met Tasha.\n\n01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:46.120\nAnd Tasha couldn't be cooler and couldn't love you more.\n\n01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:49.520\nShe speaks of you so highly, Bob, that it's like,\n\n01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:51.320\nI think she does it to your face too.\n\n01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:53.080\nI don't think it's a secret.\n\n01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:55.760\nShe tells people that she barely knows like me\n\n01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:58.440\nthat how much she looks up to you and worships you.\n\n01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:02.520\nBut also she gives you shit, she's just fucking cool\n\n01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:05.800\nbecause she really is like, she's high status.\n\n01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:08.880\nShe's fucking, yeah, like, I mean, yeah, we always got,\n\n01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:13.600\npet name is jerk, but she loves to, you know,\n\n01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.400\nlike if I'm in a mall, she'll go, Bobcat, Bobcat,\n\n01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:22.080\nGulfway, and shit chills.\n\n01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:26.720\nSo I thought the story once, Tony V was at the Riviera,\n\n01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:30.000\nhe was a comedian buddy of mine, and it was my birthday,\n\n01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.800\nand Robin was playing the MGM.\n\n01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:35.600\nAnd we were all hanging out that weekend.\n\n01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:37.240\nAnd I hadn't been on stage in five years\n\n01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:38.680\nbecause I'd been directing the Kimmel Show\n\n01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.320\nand doing other stuff.\n\n01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:42.760\nAnd Tony's having a, you know, wasn't the greatest crowd.\n\n01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:44.600\nAnd I go, Tony, bring me up.\n\n01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:45.560\nAnd he's like, really?\n\n01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:47.680\nI go, yeah, and I went up and I started performing.\n\n01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:49.440\nAnd my daughter's like, do the voice.\n\n01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:54.960\nAnd fucking relentless.\n\n01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:57.720\nAnd then Robin was like, bring me up, you know?\n\n01:23:57.720 --> 01:23:58.560\nAnd I was like, all right.\n\n01:23:58.560 --> 01:23:59.800\nAnd then he came up.\n\n01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:02.360\nIt was just, yeah, it was just beautiful.\n\n01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:04.120\nAnd Tony, we had so much fun.\n\n01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:07.000\nI remember we were, this is not that long ago.\n\n01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.120\nAnd you would be amazed how many people would be like,\n\n01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:13.360\nyou know, more to the, you know, I mean, this isn't that long.\n\n01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:15.320\nYeah, so we're playing Blackjack.\n\n01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:16.360\nAnd Tony's a really big guy.\n\n01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:19.280\nAnd this guy goes, hey, Mark, where's Mindy?\n\n01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:26.840\nAnd Tony goes, she's over at Fuck Off and asked you to join her.\n\n01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:28.480\nI remember too, it was just so many.\n\n01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:33.040\nIt was age-appropriate women would go nuts for Robin.\n\n01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:37.680\nLike, we had to like, it, that's a weird way\n\n01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:39.680\nto back into that story.\n\n01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:42.920\nNo, I just never seen like these Cougars,\n\n01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:44.880\nSavard Youth Tigers, they were going mental.\n\n01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:47.360\nThey were like, it was like the Beatles,\n\n01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:49.520\nbut these women were menopausal.\n\n01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:51.480\nThey were like chasing him.\n\n01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:53.200\nIt's a harder, it's a harder get.\n\n01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:55.920\nIt's, it's, it's, it's a more respectable, like.\n\n01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:57.720\nAnd it's funny you say that I'm not sexist.\n\n01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:00.600\nThese menopausal women that were age-appropriate,\n\n01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:01.600\nbut that's really what happened.\n\n01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:03.440\nI'm not saying you weren't, I'm saying your daughter's not.\n\n01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:05.760\nYeah, and I was like, I was like, dude,\n\n01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:07.920\nyou could pull so much steel wool if you wanted to.\n\n01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:15.720\nSee, I'm not sexist.\n\n01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:17.760\nI just wanted to crush any good will\n\n01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:19.480\nthat you had developed for me.\n\n01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:20.760\nSteel wool.\n\n01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:23.760\nThat hurts, steel wool hurts.\n\n01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:29.040\nBut it gets, it polishes you really clean.\n\n01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:31.760\nYou know, I mentioned that earlier though.\n\n01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:34.680\nThe last time he and I went on stage was at your show.\n\n01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:37.440\nAnd I remember he was just here at the, at Mount,\n\n01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:38.440\nand he goes, what are you doing?\n\n01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:39.840\nI go, I'm about to do a podcast.\n\n01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:40.800\nSo he just stayed.\n\n01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:41.280\nYeah.\n\n01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:43.360\nAnd I was like, I go, and I was like, you want to go up?\n\n01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:44.280\nHe's like, no, I don't want to go up.\n\n01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:45.680\nI was like, you don't have to go up.\n\n01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:49.160\nAnd then I remember him just looking like, he's like,\n\n01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.960\nput me in coach, and he came out.\n\n01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:53.680\nYeah, he was sitting where Curtis is sitting.\n\n01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:55.960\nHe was wearing his little windbreaker, and he was,\n\n01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:58.520\nI never, he was so shy.\n\n01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:01.720\nAnd so he came out here, and you did the bit, Dan,\n\n01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:04.120\nwhere you're like, fuck these people don't deserve us.\n\n01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:05.680\nLike Bobcat goes away, and you came out,\n\n01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:07.440\nand you told Bobcat to fuck off.\n\n01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:10.080\nAnd then you go, Robin Williams, and Robin came out.\n\n01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:12.640\nAnd I'm sitting here, so I don't know that that's a joke.\n\n01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:14.000\nI didn't see Robin.\n\n01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.640\nAnd Robin came out and gave me like a niggie and like a headlock.\n\n01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:19.200\nBecause I just met him at Eric's house like two nights\n\n01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:22.600\nbefore, where we sang songs like when you go to Eric's house,\n\n01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:23.920\nlike you sing.\n\n01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:26.920\nAnd when he left the stage, he hugged me.\n\n01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:28.160\nAnd I held him.\n\n01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:30.280\nAnd I said, thank you for making everyone think\n\n01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:31.760\nthat you and I are great friends.\n\n01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:32.760\nNo.\n\n01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:37.040\nWell, I have a good story about, and my act\n\n01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:39.080\nis a shaggy dog joke that I tell.\n\n01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:41.240\nBut it's a true story, and I won't go into the whole story.\n\n01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:42.520\nI'll try to do a truncated version.\n\n01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:43.480\nTell the whole thing.\n\n01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:45.280\nAll right.\n\n01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:47.000\nI don't know if you have the airplane story.\n\n01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:47.880\nIt is a true story.\n\n01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:51.680\nI was on a flight going from Los Angeles to New York\n\n01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:54.080\nin midway through the engine blew up.\n\n01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:55.360\nAnd it was terrifying.\n\n01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:57.600\nIt was really, and I've had enough turbulence and stuff.\n\n01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:01.360\nThe plane just suddenly was just dumping.\n\n01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:03.920\nAnd it was like G-Force kind of stuff.\n\n01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:05.360\nIt was really scary.\n\n01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:06.600\nPeople were screaming.\n\n01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:08.200\nI was like, staying calm.\n\n01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:09.520\nCheck out the flight attendants.\n\n01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:11.360\nFlight attendants are looking out the window,\n\n01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:13.760\nand they're looking around sobbing, sobbing flight\n\n01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:16.440\nattendants.\n\n01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:17.520\nI'm not exaggerating.\n\n01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:19.000\nAnd they're holding each other's hands.\n\n01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.360\nI always thought you were a professional camera.\n\n01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:27.800\nAnd I've got to say, I was completely out of my body.\n\n01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:28.960\nAnd I'm like, all right.\n\n01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:32.240\nAnd the pilot's like, hello, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:33.000\nThis is your pilot.\n\n01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.720\nThere's no reason to be alarmed.\n\n01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:37.560\nThe placating tone of his voice.\n\n01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:42.840\nThis one's for the black box, on the black box alone.\n\n01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:45.680\nI just want to say, they told me in the event.\n\n01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:47.120\nThis isn't a suicide.\n\n01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.400\nMy insurance is valid.\n\n01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:50.880\nEverything.\n\n01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:55.000\nAnd I am a sound body and mind.\n\n01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.760\nWell, we got a, Demetri Martin was on the flight.\n\n01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:59.440\nAnd we were just, we were dying.\n\n01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:00.240\nDemetri Martin.\n\n01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:01.280\nBecause we're sitting there.\n\n01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:04.760\nAnd Demetri's looking out the window going, if a landscape is,\n\n01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:09.120\nwell, is a horizon, then a horizon forms a letter H.\n\n01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:12.000\nBut he says, no, we both, after we survived this,\n\n01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.360\nwe both kept going, there's no reason to be alarmed.\n\n01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:16.760\nBecause the guy kept saying that every time.\n\n01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:17.400\nHe'll be afraid.\n\n01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:18.800\nThere's no reason to be alarmed.\n\n01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:21.080\nSo, and I'm like, this is the time to,\n\n01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:22.160\nthat's not comforting.\n\n01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:24.360\nIf the guy was like going, holy fuck.\n\n01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:25.880\nI go, oh, this guy's in it.\n\n01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:27.040\nHe's in it.\n\n01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:31.920\nOr if he said like, OK, this is fucked up for me too.\n\n01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:33.160\nBut I got this.\n\n01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:36.040\nYeah, or look, I'm going to try some shit.\n\n01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:39.520\nI learned in pilot school.\n\n01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:40.920\nI'm not making any promises.\n\n01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:43.720\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:47.200\nEverybody get up, move to the left of the plane.\n\n01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:49.080\nI'm going to freestyle.\n\n01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:54.120\nOK, or if he said, OK, here's the final refinement on that.\n\n01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:57.760\nHe goes, the bad news is all bets are off.\n\n01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:00.920\nIn terms of like, FAA and everything.\n\n01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:03.600\nThe good news is that means I get to do whatever\n\n01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:04.840\nthe fuck I want.\n\n01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:09.000\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, I'm fucking good.\n\n01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.720\nOr if he said, or if he's just like, smoke.\n\n01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:15.000\nGo ahead and smoke, yeah.\n\n01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.920\nSmoke him if you fucking got him.\n\n01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:19.080\nYeah, kiss, light it up.\n\n01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:19.960\nKiss a stranger.\n\n01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:20.960\nRub him out in your seat.\n\n01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:22.560\nFuck it, everybody.\n\n01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:23.920\nHow's anybody's doing?\n\n01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:26.000\nTurn to your neighbor and just go down.\n\n01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.800\nSo if you're an atheist and you've ever fantasized\n\n01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:32.880\nabout throwing your baby like a football,\n\n01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:34.960\nnow would be the time to do it.\n\n01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:36.040\nNo one will ever know.\n\n01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:37.000\nNo reason to be alarmed.\n\n01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:41.520\nYou got a 15 second window to spike that baby and do this.\n\n01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:46.160\nSo think about all the times it kept you up at 3 AM.\n\n01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:50.320\nAll I can say is this is 100% true.\n\n01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:52.800\nOther people on the flight was a good portion\n\n01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:55.320\nof the United States Special Olympics team.\n\n01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:59.400\nThis is a relax, just let me finish the story.\n\n01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:00.880\nI'm not.\n\n01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:03.680\nIt was 45 men and women in red, white, and blue running suits\n\n01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:04.200\nwith medals.\n\n01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:06.040\nSo if it wasn't the Special Olympics team,\n\n01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:09.760\nit was a really big hip hop group with Down syndrome.\n\n01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:15.120\nSo this isn't one of the titles.\n\n01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:16.960\nThat's the title of this episode, by the way.\n\n01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:26.560\nSo the plane's creaning towards the earth.\n\n01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:29.680\nAnd I'm thinking, oh, I'm dying.\n\n01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:31.040\nAnd I thought of Tasha.\n\n01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:32.880\nAnd I thought of my friends.\n\n01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:35.840\nAnd then Claire is about, the guy's back on.\n\n01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:38.120\nHe's like, there's no reason to be alarmed.\n\n01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:39.880\nBecause he's like, oh, that was the other,\n\n01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:41.200\nthe first announcement was, we're\n\n01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:45.360\ngoing to land in Cleveland in two to two and a half minutes.\n\n01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:48.160\nSerious.\n\n01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:50.600\nWas that the scheduled stop or is he just saying, no, no,\n\n01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:52.880\nwe're going to do that.\n\n01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.640\nIt's like a Zuckerbrothers movie.\n\n01:30:54.640 --> 01:31:00.600\nHe's like, OK, the gate is 3H, 4H, 5H, 6H.\n\n01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:03.000\nCleveland, Cleveland.\n\n01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.920\nNo, so we're dumping the plane at Cleveland.\n\n01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:09.080\nAnd then he goes, when we land, the runway\n\n01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:13.000\nwill be covered entirely in foam.\n\n01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.400\nI swear to God, at the very end of the runway\n\n01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:18.080\nwill be a fire truck.\n\n01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:22.920\nAnd I'm sitting there, and I'm like, this is it.\n\n01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:26.760\nAnd Claire's about, and Dimitri can back this up,\n\n01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:30.080\nClaire's about a voice in the back of the plane went, fire truck.\n\n01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:35.760\nTrue.\n\n01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:37.840\nI swear to God.\n\n01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:38.680\nOK.\n\n01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:40.040\nAnd he was excited.\n\n01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:41.760\nAnd I laughed.\n\n01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:43.720\nAnd nobody else, I'm like, fire truck?\n\n01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:44.800\nYou didn't hear fire truck?\n\n01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:55.120\nI went, that was the moment I went from atheist to agnostic.\n\n01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:57.520\nI was like, you know what?\n\n01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:00.040\nThere really might be some sort of higher deity in this world.\n\n01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:01.040\nThere's a possibility.\n\n01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:04.480\nYeah, there's a higher power.\n\n01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:06.360\nAnd I know.\n\n01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:08.280\nThere also might be some apples.\n\n01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:08.920\nApples?\n\n01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:10.600\nAnd I know people that go, you know,\n\n01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:14.000\nthey are like, and when I tell this story,\n\n01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.480\npeople, of course, come up to me.\n\n01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:18.240\nAnd the thing is, I know plenty of people\n\n01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:19.960\nhave mentally challenged folks in their family,\n\n01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:20.880\nor they work with them.\n\n01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:22.720\nBut if you don't think they say or do anything funny,\n\n01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:24.760\nyou're denying that they're human beings.\n\n01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:26.240\nBecause that's the funniest fucking thing\n\n01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:28.680\nI've ever heard another human being say.\n\n01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:30.800\nFire truck.\n\n01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:32.720\nAnd the tag is, I was always trying to figure out,\n\n01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:34.880\nwho is going to get top billing if the plane crash was\n\n01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:37.720\ngoing to say, Special Olympics team dies and fiery crash also\n\n01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:41.720\non board 80s comedian Bobcat Goldthwait,\n\n01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:44.080\nor Bobcat Goldthwait Special Olympics team, and you go.\n\n01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:46.400\nYeah, I was right.\n\n01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:55.040\nSo the second time I tell that story, which is 100% true story,\n\n01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:56.560\nthe second time I tell that story,\n\n01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:59.120\nI'm into my act about 10 to 15 minutes.\n\n01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:01.320\nAnd this woman gets up and she's,\n\n01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:05.320\nbecause I didn't have that tag that deflected.\n\n01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:09.760\nShe goes, my son, she's all upset because she storms out\n\n01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:11.800\nand she makes a point and then goes to the door,\n\n01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:12.800\nand that door is locked.\n\n01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:16.240\nSo then she has to come back through, and it's horrible.\n\n01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:17.880\nAnd she's got a table full of friends.\n\n01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:20.320\nAnd I was really into my act, seriously, 10, 15 minutes.\n\n01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:22.040\nAnd I go, is that lady gone?\n\n01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:23.160\nI go, is she really gone?\n\n01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:24.120\nIs she out of the building?\n\n01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:25.720\nThey go, yeah, I go, all right.\n\n01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:30.680\nLook, I'm not going to do my act.\n\n01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:31.720\nAnd he doesn't know this.\n\n01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:33.440\nBut here's my friend, Robin Williams.\n\n01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:35.040\nRobin, come over here and finish this act.\n\n01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:39.480\nAnd so he comes up and he does, like, an hour of stand up.\n\n01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:40.560\nWait, was she gone or was she not gone?\n\n01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:41.320\nYes, she was gone.\n\n01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:45.160\nSo then I come back and I go, all right,\n\n01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:48.600\ntext your friend right now.\n\n01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:51.680\nLet her know what happened.\n\n01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:53.400\nBecause she's like, oh, what happened after I left?\n\n01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:55.680\nWell, he left and Robin Williams did an hour.\n\n01:33:55.680 --> 01:34:01.240\nI hope you made your point.\n\n01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:08.280\nAll my stories about Robin are like, people are like, oh,\n\n01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:09.840\nand then he said this and it was wonderful.\n\n01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:13.520\nIt's always about me throwing him under the bus.\n\n01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:14.920\nThey really are.\n\n01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:15.960\nYou had a barracuda.\n\n01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:17.720\nUsing him as a get out of jail freak.\n\n01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:19.520\nWe were in the Caribbean in this barracuda.\n\n01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:20.280\nWe're snorkeling.\n\n01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:21.840\nIt comes up and it just jerks up.\n\n01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:23.280\nAnd it's right eye to eye with us.\n\n01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:25.200\nAnd I'd love to tell him a better man than this.\n\n01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:28.160\nI grabbed him, put him right between me and the barracuda,\n\n01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:29.160\nnot for a laugh.\n\n01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:35.720\nIt's just pure instinct, shit.\n\n01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:37.400\nYou grab Robin as a human shield?\n\n01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:38.520\nYeah.\n\n01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:38.880\nYeah.\n\n01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:42.360\nYou're like Martin Sheen in the dead zone.\n\n01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:45.440\nI'm ashamed, and I even could have got out of it\n\n01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:47.800\nbecause we both started laughing when we run out of the water.\n\n01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:50.200\nAnd he's like, you did that on purpose, didn't you?\n\n01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:54.680\nI was like, yeah, I did.\n\n01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:58.680\nYou've had a good run, you know?\n\n01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:02.600\nIt would be Robin Williams and other attack by barracuda.\n\n01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:06.320\nBut yeah.\n\n01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:08.440\nI've been on lots of playings where I was like, oh shit,\n\n01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:10.160\nI'll be a footnote on this plane because George\n\n01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:12.440\nSakai is on the plane.\n\n01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:14.560\nSulu is on the plane.\n\n01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:18.680\nI will not be mentioned on that plane crash.\n\n01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:19.320\nSulu was great.\n\n01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:21.200\nSulu got on the plane before me and Greg Poops,\n\n01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:22.600\nand he got on the plane.\n\n01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:25.280\nAnd he's walking up, and there's a guy like,\n\n01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:27.560\nhello, Mr. Poops, hello, Mr. Son.\n\n01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:29.920\nOh, Mr. Takei.\n\n01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:31.800\nAnd there's the guy that was working the gate.\n\n01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:36.920\nHe said, I just saw you on an episode of like fucking,\n\n01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:39.720\nwhat's the fucking show, the fucking some sitcom,\n\n01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:41.560\nthe Big Bang Theory.\n\n01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:44.280\nHe said, I just saw you on an episode of Big Bang Theory.\n\n01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:47.600\nAnd George Takei goes, oh, that's very good news.\n\n01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:52.920\nI can expect a residual.\n\n01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:54.040\nHe was so good.\n\n01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:56.280\nYeah.\n\n01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:59.200\nYou're never going to worry about crashing when fucking\n\n01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:00.520\nSulu's on your fucking plane.\n\n01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:01.400\nThat's very good news.\n\n01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:04.280\nWell, yeah, come on.\n\n01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:07.480\nIt's not, in the show, he's sitting in front of a prop.\n\n01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:09.760\nHe's not able to control.\n\n01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:10.960\nThe ship's not in space.\n\n01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:12.400\nI feel like, just psychologically,\n\n01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:15.080\nwe all feel like this is the best plane you're ever\n\n01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:17.040\ngoing to be on because he sat in front\n\n01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:20.800\nof a spaceship that never died.\n\n01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:21.680\nWell, I don't know.\n\n01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:22.800\nNo, I don't care.\n\n01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:24.960\nI'm being an asshole.\n\n01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:30.720\nYeah, Big Bang Theory.\n\n01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:33.320\nYou're just mad that I said Big Bang Theory.\n\n01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:36.240\nNo, no, you've told us three before about George Takei.\n\n01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:37.240\nThat's all.\n\n01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:40.720\nIt's a real.\n\n01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:44.160\nAnd I'm preoccupied about the show.\n\n01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:45.960\nWe've got to wrap the show up.\n\n01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:46.880\nWe've been doing a lot of talk.\n\n01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:48.120\nNo, but you don't get to leave.\n\n01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:50.440\nAll right.\n\n01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:56.000\nCan I make you guys play the game with us for five minutes?\n\n01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.920\nI was so good at Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n01:36:57.920 --> 01:36:59.920\nSure.\n\n01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:05.440\nLet's play a fast and furious combat riddled\n\n01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:06.160\nShadowrun right now.\n\n01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:09.440\nWe've got an Eve Libertine and a Dr. Friend.\n\n01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:11.200\nSo we need to bring D'Morge out here.\n\n01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:12.080\nD'Morge Brown?\n\n01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:13.560\nShit, we should have brought him.\n\n01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:23.560\nYeah.\n\n01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:24.560\nHello, D'Morge.\n\n01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:25.560\nHello, hello, hello.\n\n01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:26.560\nWe're fast and furious.\n\n01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:30.560\nWe're bringing you in the dying embers of a soccer game right now.\n\n01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:31.560\nDo I have a bad count?\n\n01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:34.560\nDo you have a better bird's eye?\n\n01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:35.560\nNo, we're all good, man.\n\n01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:36.560\nOK.\n\n01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:37.560\nThey can be living embers.\n\n01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:38.560\nOK.\n\n01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:42.560\nCurtis is going to hand him out because I usually do that pretty badly.\n\n01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:49.560\nSo in the post-feminist progression of the show, we're bringing no women up.\n\n01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:53.560\nBecause you know why?\n\n01:37:53.560 --> 01:38:00.560\nBecause they can take care of themselves.\n\n01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:02.560\nPut that in your pipe and smoke it.\n\n01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:08.560\nAnd if you don't believe that, maybe you hate women.\n\n01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:11.560\nSee you next week.\n\n01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:14.560\nYeah, I know.\n\n01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:15.560\nAll right.\n\n01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:20.560\nSo Spencer, as I recall last time, you guys fought a bunch of ghouls.\n\n01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:23.560\nThere was a ghoul magnet in a briefcase.\n\n01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:24.560\nGhoul magnet?\n\n01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:26.560\nYou guys beat up a bunch of ghouls.\n\n01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:28.560\nWhat was happening after that, Spencer?\n\n01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:29.560\nShould we get a recap for that?\n\n01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:32.560\nWell, I mean, that was basically the whole recap.\n\n01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:34.560\nBut I mean, I could do it.\n\n01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:35.560\nBut no, nothing happened after that.\n\n01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:36.560\nOK.\n\n01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:38.560\nLet's skip the recap just for time to say.\n\n01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:39.560\nJump in.\n\n01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:40.560\nOK.\n\n01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:43.560\nRight now, we have a briefcase full of a ghoul magnet.\n\n01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:45.560\nWe got fucked over.\n\n01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:47.560\nWe didn't get the money, right?\n\n01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:48.560\nYou did not.\n\n01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:50.560\nWe were supposed to get paid by our Johnson.\n\n01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:51.560\nHe fucking boned out.\n\n01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:56.560\nAnd I was standing in a parking lot, and we have a lot of questions.\n\n01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:59.560\nWe're inside a chain-linked...\n\n01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:04.560\nYou're outside of a chain-linked parking lot, nearby a dead gas station.\n\n01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:06.560\nI'm holding the ghoul magnet briefcase?\n\n01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:08.560\nYeah, it's beeping.\n\n01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:13.560\nHe gave us a fucking ghoul magnet, and I throw it.\n\n01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:16.560\nAll right.\n\n01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:18.560\nNightblade, what was the name of our Johnson?\n\n01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:19.560\nWhat was the guy's name?\n\n01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:21.560\nThat just screwed us over.\n\n01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:23.560\nI tell him.\n\n01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:24.560\nSpencer?\n\n01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:29.560\nHe tells you that he didn't ask because he didn't do due diligence.\n\n01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:31.560\nWe didn't get the name of that guy?\n\n01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:32.560\nNo, you sure didn't.\n\n01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:37.560\nWell, the point of a shadow run really is more about not leaving a paper trail.\n\n01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:43.560\nI mean, as enough time passed, where I, as Eve Libertine, can I cast as kind of a spirit,\n\n01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:49.560\nor like an eagle to like fly off and follow the car of the person that drove away from us\n\n01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:50.560\nand follow that guy?\n\n01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:52.560\nIt's been far too long for that.\n\n01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:56.560\nYou can send him to search, but it'll be some time before he...\n\n01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:02.560\nOkay, I send off a search eagle to follow that guy,\n\n01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:06.560\nbecause there will be comeuppance for that guy for sure.\n\n01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:08.560\nStrong.\n\n01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:09.560\nSick.\n\n01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:18.560\nHey, can I use my agony spell on the guy, even though he's getting away,\n\n01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:20.560\nbut it's a long distance agony spell?\n\n01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:21.560\nCan I do one of those?\n\n01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:23.560\nYou don't have line of sight to him.\n\n01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:25.560\nHe's far, far off.\n\n01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:31.560\nBut my mother could do that without seeing me.\n\n01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:34.560\nBut even if you were just going to try, Curtis, I mean...\n\n01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:35.560\nI could try.\n\n01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:38.560\nEven if you were just going to try, it would probably sound like...\n\n01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:46.560\nAgony!\n\n01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:52.560\nWait, Spencer, is there a way that I can send my eagle that goes off to search for him\n\n01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:55.560\nand carry that agony along with...\n\n01:40:55.560 --> 01:41:01.560\nCan we team up his agony spell on my spiritual eagle to fly on?\n\n01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:04.560\nI'm trying to get us out of here in time.\n\n01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:06.560\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:07.560\nIs that a possibility?\n\n01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:09.560\nYeah, but it'll take some special doings.\n\n01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:10.560\nAlright.\n\n01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:11.560\nWhat kind?\n\n01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:12.560\nIt's a lot harder.\n\n01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:14.560\nYou could pass out, you could even die.\n\n01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:15.560\nOh, shit.\n\n01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:16.560\nWhat, the eagle?\n\n01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:18.560\nNo, but no.\n\n01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:21.560\nSpencer, I'm willing to try it.\n\n01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:23.560\nI'm willing to sacrifice it.\n\n01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:27.560\nIf you put the agony on my spiritual eagle.\n\n01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:30.560\nBut also, I have a lot of spirit sense.\n\n01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:35.560\nI touch my red feather earring on my right ear that gives me special spiritual power\n\n01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:39.560\nwith spirits of air that should protect me more.\n\n01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:41.560\nThat should protect me more.\n\n01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:44.560\nAnd I go, Dr. Friends, hold my hand.\n\n01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:46.560\nHold my hand.\n\n01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:48.560\nWell, let's all hold hands just in case...\n\n01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:49.560\nLet's all hold hands.\n\n01:41:49.560 -->

money.\n\n01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:09.560\nThere was a swirling combination of spirits\n\n01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:12.560\nflowing through Horticard's body.\n\n01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:15.560\nI'm elevating it with my own volumizer\n\n01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:17.560\nand sending it back through to the doctor\n\n01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:20.560\nand circling it back through to the eagle.\n\n01:42:20.560 -->
