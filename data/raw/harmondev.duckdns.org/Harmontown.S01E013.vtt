00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Hello!

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Harmontown is now in session!

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
Welcome one and all, thank you so much for coming down here to Nerdmelt Theater in Hollywood, California.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
And thank you to all you beautiful weirdos listening on the podcast universe.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Please join me in welcoming the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon!

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Thank you.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Tonight I'd like to complain a lot.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
Just in one of those moods, I have a lot of things I'd like to complain about.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
Actually, I've categorized them all, specifically, because complaining isn't charismatic, ever.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
You could complain even if you had one leg.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
If you complained about it too much, people secretly behind your back would be like,

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
he won't shut the fuck up about it.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
It's like, just fucking own it, man.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
But the guy with one leg that comes in and goes like, hey, let's hop to it.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Everyone's like, Leonard owns it, he loves it.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
Complaining primatologically is not an attractive feature.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
Strangely enough, it seems to have been selected very highly in our species, because we all complain a lot.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
But it doesn't seem to turn anybody on, audiences don't like it.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
And especially in my situation, I find I have a lot of things to complain about.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
So I want to start a new feature, a new Harmontown feature,

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
podcasts, they like little categories and features, little desk bits.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
So I thought in the green room, we call this feature things I'm afraid to complain about,

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
because it'll make me sound like an asshole.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
Things dance afraid to complain about, things dance afraid to complain.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Where's the music?

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Yeah.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
I mean, here's a classic example, just to start you off, what do you mean, Dan?

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
What kind of complaint can make you sound like an asshole?

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Doesn't every complaint make you sound like an asshole?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
No, I complain about lots of stuff all the time.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
This show is very hard to do, by the way.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
It's hard to come down here.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
You think you're a small audience?

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
I have a small heart.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
But here's a real humdinger.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
Things dance afraid about, number one.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
My gardener is doing something wrong.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
I'm not finished.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
I can't put my finger on it, but my decorator agrees.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
He backed me up on it.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
He was leaving, my decorator looked at my front lawn and said,

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
your gardener is doing something wrong.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
And I agree.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
I said, Kurt, you're right.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Is your decorator Greek?

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Or gay?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Did I make him gay?

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
You did a gay character?

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Yeah, well, he is a gay character.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I don't think he would deny that.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
He's a decorator.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
If he's straight, he's required to act gay if he wants business.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
He buys pillows for a living.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
He knows where his bread's buttered.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Do you think that's a possibility that he's faking?

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
I think the pressures are on.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
I could imagine, for real,

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
even though that seems like sitcom fodder.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Truthfully, if you were in the decorating business,

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
I could picture the pressure being on you.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
The feeling of disappointment from the rich people

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
that answer the front door and you're like, hey, Carl.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
I had to drop my wife off.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
I don't know.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I think there's probably pressure on him.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
He could be straight as an arrow.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
That doesn't matter, though.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
I have no complaints about that.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
I have a complaint about the fact that the person

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
whose job it is to water and...

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
I'm not even sure what his job is,

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
but he's doing something wrong.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
The plants feel lifeless.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
And I'm not allowed to complain about that for obvious reasons.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
You guys don't have gardeners.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Your buildings have gardeners.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
My building had a gardener.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
But then when you own a home, you have a gardener.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
If you're going to commit to the archetype of rich guy

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
complaining about gardeners and designers,

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
I would say commit.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
I'm bringing out the worst...

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
These are the worst things.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
I don't want you liking me after this feature is done.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
If you did going in, I want you to go, Jesus Christ.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
What gardener, decorator?

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Go fuck yourself.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Complaining about it.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Fuck you.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
That's what I'm getting off of my chest.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
The plants feel lifeless outside.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Something's going wrong out there.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
And really, if the decorator hadn't said anything,

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
I don't think I would have noticed.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
He's gay all right.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Here's the next one.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
I don't like people trying to help me.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
That's a short one.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Says the guy who has a gardener and a decorator.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Jeff, if that's where you're going,

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
this is going to be a bunch of slam dunks.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
That's not...

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Sorry, are you one step ahead of me on that one?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
I'm sorry.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
Well, I mean, this is a headline on this thing.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
I will withhold my witty bone moans.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Well, I mean, I'm a dick.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
That's the point of the whole thing.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Do whatever you want, Jeff.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Just thank you for not trying to help me.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
I went outside my house today,

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
and there was some kind of sewer emergency happening.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
There was a yellow truck,

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
and there were two people and dickies,

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
and they were putting pitchforks down the hall,

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
and tubes and stuff.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Dickies like the fake turtlenecks?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
What are they called?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Isn't dickies also the name of the fucking...

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
What are those called?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Those kind of industrial kind of cover all shirts.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Yeah, they're called dickies. Thank you.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
They were sticking sticks down the hall.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
I don't know if there was an alligator missing

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
or something.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
We have a missing alligator.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Go out there.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
We got to go to each manhole one by one

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
and poke down it.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
If it comes back bit off like a cartoon,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
then we know we found the right manhole.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Then we got to figure out how to get that alligator

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
back to its owner.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
He responds to the name Twinkie.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
So they're out there and they got cones.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Long story short, I don't think King Harmon

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
is going to be able to get out of his garage.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
King Harmon?

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Yeah, that's just called myself King Harmon.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
It's my garage.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
It's my street.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
They're in front of it. They're poking sticks down a hole.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I went up to them and said,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
good morning.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
I'll be coming through here.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Do you think I'll fit?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
They're like, yeah, you will.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
So I go up to my car

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
and Erin McGathy gets on the other side.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
She spent the night.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
I think

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
I think it's going somewhere.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Did you guys

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
I think if I know what you mean,

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
yes, I did play Fall Out New Vegas

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
all night.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Yes, I did.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Let's just say

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
in hardcore mode.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Which is really cool, by the way.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Fall Out New Vegas fans

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
here.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
I made brief eye contact

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
with one of our few women

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
in the audience. I projected shame

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
under your face.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
I know, I know.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
You're doing nothing wrong. You're just staring forward,

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
looking and listening. But as I was

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
ass-pulling, any video game people are like, oh god, girls.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Which is silly

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
because there's lots of girls and I'm sure they all like video games.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
That's the one-two punch

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
of sexism and then reverse

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
self-loathing.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
That's what nerd men do to women.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
It's the glass floor.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
With

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
spikes on it.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
In the bottom of the hobby shop.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Not very

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
kingly.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Not very kingly, no. Not befitting a king.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
So I get in my car and I back out

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
and the guy

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
he gets behind the car.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
He gets between the car and his poop

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
truck.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
I can see him

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
gesticulating.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
He looked like he was tossing

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
a pizza.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
That's not racist because he wasn't Italian.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
That's

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
how I would describe what he was doing.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
He was like, hey, Luigi, oh, I want the motor

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
pizza. Just shaking his hands

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
like a muppet.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
He had sticks on his elbows and it was someone's

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
birthday. That's all I saw.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
I'm

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
going to do whatever I was going to

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
do.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
My goal isn't to back

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
my car into your poop truck.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
I think that's the one thing I know is there.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
I came over and said good morning to the poop

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
truck driver and said, I'm coming out.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
He doesn't need, now he's standing

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
between my car and the thing he doesn't want

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
me to hit. All he's doing is making me

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
have less space to do my

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
very difficult why turn around a poop

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
truck. I was complaining about it the whole time

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
and Aaron said he's trying to help you.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
I don't care.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
That's what I didn't like about him. He tried to

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
help me. I don't like it.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Yeah.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
I don't like him.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
I don't have to say anymore about that. I resent

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
the amount that he's been in my life already.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
I want him out.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
There are times when people try to help you and

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
they get in the way. That guy was making it

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
harder for you to do the

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
inevitable. Next item.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Everyone should have to wear name tags

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
all the time.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
That's the last time I was ever happy was in

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
kindergarten. Everyone had

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
a Kool-Aid lid around their neck with

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
yarn and it had their name on it

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
and I'm sorry

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
I have to walk a tightrope here.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Because what I want to say,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
first of all, I wish I could say these two

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
things at the same time, but the first thing I

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
want to say is if your name's Dave

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
and

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
you're not a lion tamer

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
you don't have

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
a hat that says Dave on it.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Your name's Dave. It's one of eight

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
names that we have.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
There's nothing wrong with it. My name's Dan.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Here's the thing

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
I wish I could say at the same time

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
because it sounds like I'm bullying guys with

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
unremarkable names.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
I also don't want you to be named

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Xander or

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Ginger Root or

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Safari with two R's

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
and a T.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
I don't like that

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
either. I don't like you.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I don't like people. Your names

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
are not words.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
They should be like everyone,

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
if you fought a bear when you were a kid

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
your name should be fought a bear.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
I think we know we had a chance

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
at that society and someone

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
fucked it up.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
What would your

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
given Indian name be?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
If you were a Cherokee

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
or a Navajo.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
I like the idea of it not being up to me.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
That's a lot of pressure to put on a guy.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Because then everyone's name would be like

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Pretend.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
He's got goggles under the burden of his own dick.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Weakens in the knees when he pees

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
and people would be just doing

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
bitch.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Constantly the target of jealousy among eagles.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Comes a river.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Comes a river.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Use your imagination

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
as a gifted writer.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Sick TP owner.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Pretend

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
you're the village and there's an 8-year-old

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Dan Harmon walking around.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
What do you think?

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Poobs his pants.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Dirty, dirty, dirty face.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
I was very dirty. I would play under

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
the stairs and stuff.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
But maybe on the prairie, maybe I was longing for the prairie.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
There was no stairs there.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
I think I am.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
I'm a little part Native American

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
that one of my dad's

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
was

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Your dad had 8 dads?

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Yeah, he's passed around a lot.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
So it's not a biological connection,

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
but sometimes I feel the nature calling me.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Because

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
one of the guys that hit my grandma

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
was

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
100% chuck-taw.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
I feel it.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Sometimes when I drive past a gas station

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
I'm like, I want to get

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
some lucky strikes and wear

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
more denim.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
And I want to jeep.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
If you were the chief

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
of a tribe, and you know,

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
you kind of are. You're the mayor of Harmontown.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
King Harmon.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
How would you give an Indian name

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
to your girlfriend, Erin?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
What would that be?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Grips like a vice.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
What am I?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
I don't know.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
When did controlling become instigating?

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Does anyone remember?

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I'm going to try to provoke you.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
You could have said,

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
you know, chase his clouds away.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
You could have said something else.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
You made it dirty.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Strawberry head.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Strawberry head.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
That's what I call her.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
And I'd be a little cloud baby.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Erin, you're off mic.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
What would your Indian name be for Dan?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
You can think about that.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
We'll come back to you.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
When you've got it, raise your hand

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
and we'll mic you up.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
We'll send a guy out with a lob.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
All right.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Moving on. The segment's working.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Toothbrushes in hotel rooms

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
and more importantly, toothpaste.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I'll bring the toothbrush.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
As long as you don't outlaw that.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
TSA, which is a private company.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Not a fucking government agency.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Fucking those people at the goddamn airport.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
And by the way, I'm not going to leave the charge,

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
but let's all opt out of the fucking scatterback machines.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
They make me dizzy.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
They make me nauseous.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Something's going wrong.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
I'm sure it's an urban.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
We went through an airport with Dino

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
and Dino was like in line and he said like,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
you know the guy who invented that

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
thing won't go through it.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
And

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
he didn't say it.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
He said it louder than

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
I'm comfortable saying anything in an airport,

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
but he didn't say it.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
But you could tell that they were like

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
they were

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
and I don't know

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
that it's true. I just know that they

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
reacted to their

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
sick of hearing about that.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Little

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
edit

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
and also look up synonyms

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
for moments.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
I don't know.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
And patch it in later with a voice synthesizer.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
I got to keep moving, man.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
I don't want to get on a lot of tangents tonight.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
That's my

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Jack Benny catchphrase.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Did Jack Benny have a catchphrase?

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
What does this say?

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
The physical thing.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
But he started

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
on the radio. So he must have had

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
a verbal equivalent of doing that.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
My oh my.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Rochester.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
That was

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Snaggle Puss.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Toothpaste.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Toothpaste in hotel rooms.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
You're not allowed to bring

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
toothpaste on the plane.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Hotels,

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
you're in the business of trying

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
to anticipate what your guests want.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
We know you have toothpaste.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
The cat is out of the bag

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
because every time we call down to the front desk

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
for it, you have it.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
You have a box of toothpaste.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
You just don't want to put it in the room

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
because some people might not use it.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
And you're going to get rich

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
one nickel at a time.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Unbelievable.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
You have a hotel chain.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Did you make it out of empty

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
toothpaste containers?

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Did you use the money

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
to build the 13th floor that you saved

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
in toothpaste?

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
There's leftover

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
change somewhere in the hotel business.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
A little packet of toothpaste.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
You don't make us call down for soap.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
N words.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I may have mentioned this before.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
I have a real problem with the

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
housekeeping.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
They didn't invent this.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Mostly women, but probably some men

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
that are the housekeepers

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
in the hotels around the world.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
They didn't invent this, but apparently

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
there's a rule, a mandate,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
that they must fold all Kleenex

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
and toilet paper into that neat little V thing

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
to make it easier to use

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
to make it...

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Sometimes

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
your next shit's on us.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
They'll take the first three Kleenex

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
and fold it into some kind of rosette.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
That doesn't say fancy.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
That says previously handled.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Now we're getting into this.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Maybe we'll bring some of you up here.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I would say a little less touching

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
with the paper and the Kleenex.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
I'm going to put this in my nose in a moment.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Why do I want your...

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
You clean bathrooms really.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
The title of this episode will be

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
I'm mad as hell for no real good reason

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
and I am going to take it.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
But I'm going to keep complaining anyway.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
My bathtub doesn't work.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
The one that would shoot water up my butt.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
By loving it.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
And the motor burnt out.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
I don't know who installed this thing

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
but nobody can find the motor.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
I'm going to complain about my contractor too.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
He can't find my bathtub's motor.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
He's punching holes in walls

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
and then he's going,

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
it's not in there.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
There's like three holes. He can't find the motor.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I'm mad at the guy that invented the motor.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
I'm mad at the guy that installed it.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
I'm mad at the contractor.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
I bought this house from

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
and they ran down the driveway

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
sniggering and chuckling

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
counting my money

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
because they knew that bathtub was going to break.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
I have to say that there was a

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Dan Harmon that moved into that house

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
and there was this big bubble bath

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
and he used to get in the bubble bath

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
because Dan not famous for bathing.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Right.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
All of a sudden he became Mr. Bubble Bath.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
He was up to his tits

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
and lather for the first few months

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
and shooting a water jet

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
out of the side of the thing up his asshole

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
jerking off to heaven knows what

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
and you were

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
you were happy as a pig and shit

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
for a long time.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
You know how happy I was?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
I didn't have to jerk off to anything

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
because that's your big question.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
What do you take your iPad in there?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
You put it in a plastic bag in case it falls in?

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
What are you looking at?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
It's so fun. Nothing. I'm not looking at anything.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
I was in a little rave.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
I was just dancing

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
and maybe I'd put on some music.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Maybe like...

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
You had the jet going up the booty

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
and...

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
I'm doing the moves.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
You're covered in suds and then the thing broke

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
and you've become an irascible asshole.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Yeah, I fucking am angry. That's what it is.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
I'm glad we figured this out.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
This is why it's important to talk to people.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
I said the moment you fix that motor

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
we're going to know the difference.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
All right.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
We're going to go to the airport.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Okay?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
At the airport.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
These bars that you go to in the airport.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Remember, you guys don't remember.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
There's a culture to this.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
When you would go to the airport

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
the idea was they had bars at the airport

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
and it was a judgment-free zone

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
because you might be flying

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
in across the world.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
You don't know...

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
What's at 6am?

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
I'll have a margarita

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I'm from Australia.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
I'm selling socks down there.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
To me, it's 2pm.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
The idea of an airport bar

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
was supposed to be a better bar

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
than a regular bar.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
It was a bar where you were

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
floating through. It was like most easily.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Hammerhead could be there.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
You talk to a guy that distributes

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
parts for machines

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
and stuff.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
You get so drunk.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
All you're going to do is get on a plane and maybe die.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
You get drunk.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
It's the one fun thing about

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
stuffing yourself into a metal tube

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
and being bossed around

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
by some of the

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
least remarkable people.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
At just the anxiety level

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
the idea that

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
you could die on one of those things

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
that's safer than a car.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
I don't care.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
I want to die in a car.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
I should probably

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
knock on some kind of wood.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
My hands are on the wheel

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
or at least I'm in the thing.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
I don't know. I see what hits me.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
I would much rather die in a plane crash than in a car wreck.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
If I'm going down

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
I want to be a participant.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
I want to be in that roller coaster

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
and go, Jesus Christ, this is it.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
That's like getting

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
shot at a DMV.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
The last thing you see

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
at threshold guardians

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
feel like you...

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
At 350 miles an hour though

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
that's fun.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
It's going to be awesome

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
to die in a plane crash.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
A car wreck is in a movie

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
where there's always that act tube bullshit

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
with some happy couples backing out of the driveway

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
and they're like, I see this, I could smash

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
and some truck drives them over.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Anybody that writes a movie with that scene

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
I'm going to punch on the dick.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Hey listen man

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
what kind of rice?

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
At my wedding?

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Yeah, your wedding to getting in plane crashes.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
That's a new thing.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
That's a new thing.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
I call it a chain zinger.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
You ask somebody a nonsensical question

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
and you string them along into your zinger.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Sometimes you can chain them real long.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Okay, I did it wrong.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Do it again.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
I think that anyone that writes that

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
sneak attack car crash in a movie

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
should be punching the dick.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Was there a fine involved?

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
For what?

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Did the ASPCA find you?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
For doing what?

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Didn't all the pigeons explode and stuff?

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Did the pigeons explode?

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
I thought they eat rice and then they explode

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
when they're at a wedding.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Wait, I was talking about car crashes and plane crashes.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
I thought you were going to marry getting in

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
fucking plane crashes.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
You won't shut the fuck up about it.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Our next guest.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Chain zinger.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Aaron insists on calling them

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
what kind of rice is.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Which is easier to remember,

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
but it's not going to take off.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
I'm not going to sell that paperback.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
I want a Harris Wittels career here.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
I want a humble brag book on every table.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Can we talk about

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
your brother's bucks,

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
the doll hairs thing?

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Oh, yeah, my brother.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
My brother

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
is very upset.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
I don't know how many of you are long-time listeners,

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
but his brother,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Bones,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
he's a recurring character on this.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Well, not anymore, because I read some of his emails.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
We had Adam read some of his emails,

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
and he was very...

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I understand completely.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I'm not complaining about my brother

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
being offended by how I talk about him.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
My goal is to make fun of him

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
when I talk about him.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
I'm squeezing him like a sponge.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
I'm trying to get joy for other people

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
out of him.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
He's had enough.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
He doesn't get any more from me.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
I want something from him.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
He's my big brother,

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
so you get to think about him like that.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
I challenge him to fly out from wherever he is

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
to come to Hollywood, California

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
and be on the show.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Live on stage.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Everybody?

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
You hear that, Bones?

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
You're pussy.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
They're calling you out.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
They're calling you out, you pussy.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
He can stay at your place, man.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
I got a couch.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Bones, you're staying with me.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Maybe he'll try to convince you he invented peanut butter and jelly.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Wait, what?

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
No.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
I get to tell people about that.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
He doesn't get to be mad.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
If your brother tries to convince you

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
he invented peanut butter and jelly when you're kids,

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
when you're 39 and you tell people about that,

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
he doesn't get to be mad.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Whatever. He can be as mad as he wants.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
I don't care.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
That's adorable big brother stuff.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Yeah, you get to do that.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Anyways, why'd we bring him up?

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Oh, doll hairs.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
One time, you know that doll hairs thing?

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
I got like, hey, I'll give you $20

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
if you run into the traffic

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
and then the big brother says,

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
I said doll hairs.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
So my brother did that to me once

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
and I was like, okay, all right.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
My brain grew a little bit.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
I was like, all right.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Note to self.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Keep a little leprechaun file

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
if it seems too good to be true,

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
dot, dot, dot, and all that.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Add a little serotonin connection

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
to the concept of currency

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
and possible word play.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
And so one time,

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
he said, I don't remember

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
what the dare was.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Like, go jump over that prickly plant

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
or something stupid.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Like, what do we, rare rabbit?

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
He said, I'll give you 100 bucks.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
And I said,

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
and I was a little precocious little kid.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
So I went, yeah, right.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
I know that means male deer.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Like, he's going to give me 100 male deer.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
But I was running through.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
I was like, okay, let's figure this out.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
In the old west, I would have been worth like $5,000.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
And he said, he said, no,

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
I'm not going to give you male deer.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
I said bucks. I'm going to give you 100 bucks.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
And I was like, okay, bucks, bucks, bucks,

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
then nothing, nothing.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Like, okay, and I jumped over the thing,

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
whatever it was.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
And then he grabbed me

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
and he kind of started humping me

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
and said,

26:42.000 --> 26:54.000
I'll give you 100 bucks.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Now, if he heard me telling that story,

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
he'd get, apparently,

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
he'd get in a big huff.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
I mean, you know, he was probably 12.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
He would say it didn't happen.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Right.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
He would impugn your memory of that.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Why would I make that up?

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
He would probably live it about this

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
insinuation that I had concocted

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
that he would wear,

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
he would put a tube sock on his dick and balls

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
and let the sock hang down

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
and being naked and he'd run into the living room

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
when my mom was there and be like,

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
ah, and my mom would go, ah, stop it.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
And so he wrote in his email,

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
he was like,

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
what the fuck are you making shit of?

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Like, what are you fucking like?

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
People pay you to make up shit like this?

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Kind of like really trying to high road me

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
and I said,

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
I have a Polaroid of you doing it.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
I literally have photographic evidence

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
in my home

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
of use.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Yeah, I think mom took the Polaroid

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
because you're standing

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
with your hands on your waist

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
like a superhero

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
with a sock on your cock.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
And then in his next response

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
he was like, this is starting to sound

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
a little gay, you got pictures of me naked

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
of that.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Like, just

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
dipping and dodging and like,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
just own the fucking sock, who cares?

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Anyways,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
what was the, god damn it,

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
and then he said in the same email,

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
and I did it years before the fucking chili peppers.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Because

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
I mentioned it,

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
I think that the chili peppers did it too

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
and he bothered to,

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
you gotta pick a flag, man.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
That one I like,

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
be a big brother like that.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
I did it way before the fucking chili peppers

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
and I was like, hey man, you know what,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
I will put a correction section in my,

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
I don't think I implied that the chili peppers

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
did it first, by the way.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
We could talk about this all day, but

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
his indignance was

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
kind of shut things down.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
He successfully made me feel bad for making him

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
the butt of my jokes. It's like behind the music

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
except he's not in a band.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
When I put myself in his shoes

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
I fully support his

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
right to be

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
really offended, pissed off, frustrated,

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
irritated, whatever.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Which is why I challenge him to come to California.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
I was offering him,

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
I was giving him the heads up and saying,

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
anything you write in an email back in response,

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
I'll have Adam read that too

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
and

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
try to get your revenge.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
I'm not saying that's fair, but it's like what I'm offering.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
And then he was saying

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
he takes more than that, man,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
and I was like, what do you want?

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
I don't like him.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
He wanted me to, I don't know,

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
I just felt like it was moments from asking for a

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
truck or something.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Why did you bring him up?

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Oh, but Fox, yeah, he's done, he's toast.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Okay, that's it.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
We were talking about, we were at the drawing room

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
talking to Joe Unger about Ring of Fire.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Right, that's how that came up.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Joe, who's a regular at the drawing room,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
talking about Johnny Cash, everyone loves Johnny Cash,

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
playing him in the jukebox, having a good time.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
My friend Joe is a great dude.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
He's from Tennessee.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
He talks with a great Tennessee accent,

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
man, you're the real deal.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
He's the grooviest guy in the world.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
He's like an old, yeah, kind of Sam Elliott

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
kind of figure at the drawing room.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
And then he said today, he wasn't perpetuating

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
this myth, but he was in states.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
So somebody, you ever hear,

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
somebody told me Ring of Fire

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
is a prisoner he talked to.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
I was talking to a prisoner.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
It was a guy who had been in jail.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
That's the person that told him that.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
That was going around a prison.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
All right.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Yeah, that Johnny Cash was gay

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
and that Ring of Fire

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
is about a man's

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
butthole.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
I don't think that's how being gay works.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
I don't think that's how being secretly gay

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
country superstar works.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
You're like, oh, I feel like such a fraud.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
I gotta somehow

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
express myself

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
and my sexuality.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
I'll

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
make a song called

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Ring of Fire. The Ring of Fire is secretly

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
a butthole.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
I don't think that's how it works.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
I don't believe that theory.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
How do you think it works?

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
I don't know. What do you mean?

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
What did George Michael do?

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
What do you do when you're

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
polysexual

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
and you live in a

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
homophobic world

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
and people like to hear you sing

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
and women like to throw panties at you

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
and you have to write songs.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
You are ambiguous about the object

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
of your love.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
You say, baby, baby, I love sleeping

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
with you and you know that you're talking

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
about Steve.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
You leave he and she out of it.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
You don't say, there's

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
a circular tunnel

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
in my future

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
and I'm going inside

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
and it's walls are brown

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
and I look around

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
and I

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
like to go here again.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Butthole.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Butthole.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
You don't do that.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Because that's not what's...

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Gay people are human beings

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
is the theme of this show tonight.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
We hate to bury the lead.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
They're not like kids'

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
serial spokes models that

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
just crave buttholes.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
The way a rabbit craves

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
lucky charms or tricks or whatever.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
They're not defined by...

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
What way a rabbit craves

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
lucky charms?

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
An Irish rabbit.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
They're not like

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
the cookie crook.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
The

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
butt is just a thing that

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
there's a co-relation.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
It's not a cause-effect relationship.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
They're not mythical creatures.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
So tonight, Harmontown

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
tackles the sensitive

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
issue of homosexuality.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
We're going to face this head-on

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
and not in a weird make-policy kind of way.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
There's been some big old...

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
There's been some big do-ins

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
in the world of gay rights.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
I saw something on red and I can't remember what it was.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Is anybody well-versed on this?

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Anybody know the reason stuff?

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
If you're a minor

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
in California,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
what's your name, sir?

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Nathaniel.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
I'm trying to be the fancy

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
version of me.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
I've grown up

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
hurt by Nathaniel's.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
When you're a Daniel

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
in a Nathaniel's world,

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
it hurts.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
You always feel like

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
less.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Don't complain.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
I wish some

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
just-hearted gym coach could have

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
made you into a Daniel.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
What Nathaniel reminded me of

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
is they passed legislation in California.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
It's

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
unconstitutional. I don't know

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
what the language is going to be.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
It's against the law

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
to try to straighten

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
gay kids.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
It's illegal

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
to have

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
programs

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
that cure camps that you go to.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
You learn that the reason you're gay

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
is because of Jesus

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
and they put enough into you

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
to make you straight.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
You basically kidnap them.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
It's sort of like

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
because they're minors.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
They kidnap you

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
when you're going.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
The law gets fuzzy when it's

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
drug addiction and mental illness

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
and stuff. If you're a minor,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
what if you're not addicted

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
to any drugs and you're not crazy?

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
You're just 16 and you're kind of gay.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
California

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
now says mom and dad

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
have to answer

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
to the law if they stuff

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
you in the station wagon and take you to a special

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
place where they show you the glory

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
of the vagina by flashcard.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
I was pointing at it

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
with a pointer.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
That's how I learned it, Dan.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
A trail of M&Ms into these

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
fiberglass

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
vaginas

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
or little trails of dicks.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
They're like, look, we know

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
we're going to wean you off it

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
with no pun intended.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
The flashcards,

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
there's a hundred of them. They start off like dicks

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
but they slowly morph into like

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
kind of neuter and then they become a vagina

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
at the end of them.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
If they actually made approaches like that, that would be great

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
because they don't actually just break down even more barriers

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
because halfway through the morphed

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
dick vagina, some kids will go, wait,

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
that's what I like.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
I didn't even know that was a thing.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
I'm googling it.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
I like that half dick vagina thing.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
I like that.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
I like that very small hole with a clitoris

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
the size of a flashlight.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
I don't know what you call that.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Some kind of Dr. Seuss

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
creature. I want one of them.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
I learned it by watching you.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Anyways, yeah. Thank you, California.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
I thought it was other stuff.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
You know what?

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
You know what I love about gay rights?

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
This is what I love about it.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
As a straight, white, fat,

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
lazy, liberal.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Gay rights is so easy.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
It's not easy for gay people.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
They're going through a turbulent time of trying to

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
be treated equally.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
They're being bullied and whatever.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
They want to create a world for themselves

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
and their loved ones where

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
that doesn't matter to the goddamn government

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
in a world where so much

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
more weird shit

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
doesn't matter to the government.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
They can look the other way.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
I'm Proopsin' it.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I'm not going to do it.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
I'm not at his level. I don't read the newspaper.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
But the gay rights thing

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
is so easy.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
You don't expend any energy

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
being in favor of it.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
You know those women

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
that

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
yeah.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Remember

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
when that little girl

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
got killed, Joan, Benet, Ramsey,

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
the little girl.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Sometimes this happens in the news.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
It's all quiet down.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
There's always the people

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
you read about them

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
in articles

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
and it's like a periphery

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
to the story that

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
because the story is happening

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
there's people outside the suspect's

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
house yelling at them

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
going.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
You see it on the news, you'll see B-roll of

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
these women.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
It's usually women.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
It's okay for me to say that

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
because I realize

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
that women are

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
these are crazy women.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
They're not crazy because of their women.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
I think they're watching the news

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
and they see that someone may have killed a baby

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
and they get

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
so excited

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
because the lines between good and evil

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
are a change and they just

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
show up outside these houses with

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
bloody Barbie dolls and go

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
whore killer!

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Whore killer! Baby killer!

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
And it's like

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
what a brave stance.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
You're such a hero.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
You're so...

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
I should really pitch in.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Here I am on my way to work

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
while I let the justice system deal with

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
someone who may have killed a baby.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Letting that person

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
who may or may not have killed a baby

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
know that I'm against killing babies.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Dan, are you soft

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
on baby killing?

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Softer than these strange people.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
And I guess that there's a

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
relationship I'm drawing there.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
I'm pointing at myself, I'm looking at the man

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
in the mirror. Dan Harmon would rather have a

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
jacuzzi jet up his asshole than

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
save a baby being killed.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Come on, man.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
I can't remember what I was saying.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
It's just...

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
More like comp interupturling.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Interloping.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
I don't know.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
I think...

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
I'm an advocate

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
of my gay chums.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
I want them to have everything that they

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
can possibly have and more.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Outside of more.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
I think they should be gayer.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
And they should have more of the gayer they are.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
I think there should be a social program

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
that if you register

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
as an official gay person

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
you should have a better car.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Because you're out there

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
representing the forefront

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
of a raised consciousness.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
A gay reward system?

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Yeah, give you a little...

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
whatever. I'm being glib.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
But why is that so easy for me to say?

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Well, because it's easy.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Because the alternative is

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
like these idiots.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Who cares what gay people do?

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
How often do you get an opportunity

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
to be heroic by saying,

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
I don't care what you do?

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
That's a lazy person's dream.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
So I'm calling myself out on that.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
That's my point.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
I'm being like a fat southern lady

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
on the front lawn of a suspected murderer

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
yelling baby killer when I say

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
great job, California.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
I'm passing that gay legislation.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
So who cares, Harmon?

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Your cookies in the mail

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
from the Gay Federation.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
How do you think

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
you could properly

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
reward the gay community?

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
With a big kiss.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
I don't know.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
What do you mean? Money?

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
I don't know.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
I give to that

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
organization.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
I should give more.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Actually, I slouched out

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
this year.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
I'm not saying this is where anyone should spend their money,

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
but it's something very comforting

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
to me about it.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
It's called the Los Angeles Gay

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
and Lesbian Center.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
The money

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
that you give them goes to just helping

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
super

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
teen runaways, basically.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Specifically, who are running away

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
from a life that's being hard on them

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
because they are lesbian, gay, bisexual,

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
whatever, or transgender.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Kids that are going to end up

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
because of that,

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
they're just going to become a statistic.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
They're going to go downhill.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
It's a shelter you can go to.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
They give you a certain amount of time

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
that you can just stay there for free

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
and get your shit together.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
There's programs and stuff from there

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
and they try to...

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
A lot of people come to LA

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
running from shit in Iowa.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
It's a nicer place

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
for someone to end up.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Hunger is a better thing to solve

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
with your money.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
You asked how to give back

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
to the gay community.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
If you're wondering, the Library of Congress

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
suggests the LA Gay and Lesbian Center.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
I probably got the name wrong.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
I was on the road doing comedy shows.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
We were in Central, Missouri

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
and Illinois.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
I'm straight.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
When I walk into a restaurant

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
or a bar

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
in really rural America,

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
they're safe to assume

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
that I could be from the moon.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
I don't look like anybody that's from there.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
When I say,

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
do you have anything as vegetarian?

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
I almost get gay-bassed

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
for that.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Being vegetarian

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
in certain parts of the country

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
is pretty rough.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
I feel like I can relate

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
to the...

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
to the...

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
to the persecution.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Yeah, well, it's like

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
I feel bullied by my gardener.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
I don't know what he's doing.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
I don't think that's fair.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Do I have to learn special gardener language?

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
What would you call it?

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Spanish?

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
In order to be able to say...

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Sorry, Juliet,

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
our friend visiting from Mexico.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
You're not a gardener.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
You are?

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
You have a gardener.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
I'm rich.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
She's rich.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
What nationality is your gardener?

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Mexican.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
There you go.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
It's supposed to be so much more uncomfortable there, right?

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
They're like...

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
I'm kidding.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Can we talk about the fact that

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
you tell me a story about

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
sometimes your TV turns on?

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
I want to ask Juliet something.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
National in the audience.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
I want to ask about the music,

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
because there's guys working on my house right now.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
This is continuing the theme of unlikeability.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
I'm an uncharismatic person.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
I am lazy.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
It sounds like polka, yeah.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Oh, sorry.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
I'm Mexican.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
You want a cookie?

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
I know.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
He made a very sad face

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
and held out his hand and nodded his head.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
It's a Nortanio style, right?

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Orcordians, right?

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
That's polka.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
It sounds so much like polka, though,

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
that it's crazy.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
It's like Joseph Campbell would go crazy.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
I don't understand the connection between

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Poland and Mexico.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Well, that's the geographic connection.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
There you go.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
German immigrants

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
to the northern of the country.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
And then it just

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
merged.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Now everybody likes it and I'm running away from it.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Do we have that mic?

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Or should we repeat that for the podcast?

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
That's probably not going to be heard, right?

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Should we have Giulietta come up as a special guest?

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Yeah, that's right.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
We're going to bring Giulietta

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
from Mexico.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Giulietta, everybody, from Mexico.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
She's going to explain to us why

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
the polka music sounds like polka.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Here, you can take this mic and I'll grab one.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Okay.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Yeah, this is a very interesting story from the north of the country.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Wait, I want to introduce you first.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Giulietta

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
for hardcore

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Armenians, like people who are cross-platform

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
multiple

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
year Armenians.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Giulietta is a community fan

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
who draws a lot of the

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
cool community fan art.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
You would see her on Twitter.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
She's at Juju Giulietta.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
At Juju Giulietta.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
You've seen

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
some interesting community fan art,

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
some of which I have hanging in my home.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
I've seen many.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
She's based in Mexico

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
and she's out here visiting and looking for job opportunities

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
and stuff.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Don't tell immigration.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
I want to hear the story of

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
she's out here getting married.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Is that

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
how it works?

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
She's out here taking pictures

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
of the Hollywood sign.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Over and over again.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Do you think immigration listens to podcasts?

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
I absolutely

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
have no intentions of instilling jobs

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
from Americans or

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
stealing their wives. That's not what I'm doing here.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Just also don't. Check your clothes

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
for seeds and other agriculture

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
when you go home.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
I'm definitely not smuggling anything.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
I don't want any of our fine iceberg lettuce

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
growing

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
and it'll fuck up your whole ecosystem.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
It's 98% water.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
That's the secret.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
I want to hear the story of the guy

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
climbing in your window.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
You really want to hear that story?

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Why watch CNN?

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
We don't watch CNN.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Here's a glimpse of

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
just this small part of

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
where in Mexico are you from?

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
I'm from Monterrey.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
It's the northeast of the country south of Texas.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
It's a pretty cool way to

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
the states.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Do you want to tell that story?

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
I was watching the

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
acclamation episode.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
At 7.45pm

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
I was watching it on stream or something

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
and suddenly a guy just went into

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
this room. My house is very weird

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
and I just looked away from a computer.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
I was reading an article

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
on the studio

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
and I was just like, excuse me?

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
And then he was just like

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
I'm going to take this. He was just trying to

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
grab my brother's laptop.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
He came in the window? No, just through a door.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Oh, he came through the door? Through a door, yeah.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
She's innovative.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Chill illegal, somebody said.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
We got a lawyer

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
in the crowd.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you're going to hear

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
the defense emphasize that

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
he came through a door.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
And that you come through doors on your birthday

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
when you love your mother, you come through a door.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
It's still illegal.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
You show clips from Twilight.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Isn't that true though?

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
That you use your door as a window sometimes?

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
I quote your uncle

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
at a movie theater. This is from

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
last July. He said you

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
made a better door than a window.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
That's prosecution

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
rests.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Actually

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
he jumped

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
a fence and he dropped about 18 feet

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
because my house is really strange

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
and then he came through that door.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
So he's a desperate man

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
coming in. Yeah, he had already tried to steal

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
a car before that.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Same guy? Same guy.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
And he also tried to rob a woman with a knife

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
before that. He got nothing right

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
because in the end my dad

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
he just bit the shit out of him.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
It's like dead wood down there.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
At some point my mom came out with a sword.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
I am never going to do that.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Sorry, wait a second. It's like Tokyo down there.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Your mother wields a sword?

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
She's a fencer.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
She did fencing.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Oh really? She did fencing so she like

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
swords and she had a like a... Is it Saber or Epay?

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
No, it wasn't Epay.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Either way this guy picked the wrong house.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Then my dad is like 6'4".

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
He's like the Spencer.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
They call him El Spencer.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Spencer is our dungeon master.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
He's a giant.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
So what happened to the guy?

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Your dad kicked the tar out of him.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Yeah, and then my mom was like

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
your dad's glasses.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
He can't see without these glasses because

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
he took the glasses off to fight the guy.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Yeah, I know the guy's in jail

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
for the next 14 years or something.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Wow.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
It was like finally something worked out.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
And you left all that to come here, huh?

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
That was like 2 years ago.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Really?

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
That was the point where you started.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
I should get a passport.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
I already had one, but I need to

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
I really need to get the fuck out of here.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
The first thing pushing me out was the music.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Yeah, we're talking about the music.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Alright, just polka music.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Repeat what you said as an explanation

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
for how polka sounding music

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
ends up coming out of a boom box

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
with the guys that are painting my ceiling.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Who don't seem Polish.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
But the music sounds so...

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
I'm from Milwaukee.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
I know Polish culture.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
I bowl.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
I have like a 150 average.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
I get spares and stuff.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
This start is not as interesting as just

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
German immigrants coming to the north of the country

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
and just settling there and mixing with

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
the people from there.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
And that's why people like me are white.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
In Mexico.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
So yeah, that's basically it.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
It's just regional music

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
and it's awful.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
But it's mostly from

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
the north of the country.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
But I assume like, yeah, because country western

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
it sounds pretty similar.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
And a lot of like...

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
When you get specific with a specific type

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
of music and you're just listening to that

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
type of music, I can't

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
tell the difference between

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
what genre of music you call it

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
when you hear like a

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
young black woman going,

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
"'Cause you made me

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
feelin' my opportunities.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
I felt so right."

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Like it's more of a showcase

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
of their vocal chords and there's no...

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
You can't even hear the music behind it.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
R&B maybe you call that.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
So you've got some pipes on her.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
I wouldn't know.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
If you played three of those in a row I'd be like,

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
you'd get mad and go,

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
no, that was like, one thing was from

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
78 and I'd go,

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
I'm sorry, I don't know.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Can we hear a little more of that?

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Yes!

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
You treated me kind

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
of opportunities

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
from the break of dawn

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
to the evening

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
light.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
We felt the time

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
when you

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
give me

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
give me

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
give me

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
you

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
in the city.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
In the city.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
That's Lou Reed.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Let's hear it for

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Julietta, thank you so much.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Our correspondent from south of the border.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
If you're looking for someone to draw something

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
and you can

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
provide

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
something that would

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
work on a work visa form,

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
you know.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
You want to be an animator?

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
You are an animator, yes.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Juju Julietta

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
at

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Twitter.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
Did you guys have a fight there? Do you want to be an animator?

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
I am an animator.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
It was a little fight.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
I'm the only one that picks up on this stuff.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
I know when people are pissed.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Julietta's pissed.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
That was pretty good singing, Harmon.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
I didn't know you had that range.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
You made me fish

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
go,

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
go down to the avenue.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
I'm a very 70s racist

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
with the cities in the avenue

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
and the street.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
The lyrics,

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
who am I thinking of?

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
If you pick out the lyrics, it's really just about

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
loving

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
and people being loved and are you coming to love me?

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
I let you go.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
It's just so,

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
because you're not listening to the person and going,

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
holy shit, she can really sing.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
But you have

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
a surprising range of octaves.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
You're like Mariah Carey.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
God rest your soul.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
I wasn't trying to be funny.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Do you remember

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
when Whitney Houston

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
died and the next day

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
her best of album was

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
cynically released?

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
No, it was already, it was just

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
$5 more.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
And everyone thought it was, everyone

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
wrote into Apple and said, how dare you?

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
It was really crass and disgusting.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
I have some respect.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
And Apple went, oh no, no.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
As you might expect, Apple is run by a computer.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
The price goes up

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
when the wholesale price goes up.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
It's just an algorithm and everyone slowly turned

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
to Sony Records.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
And Sony Records went,

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
what the hell?

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
What a mistake.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
I don't know.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
No apology.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
No admission of gullism.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Just a simple,

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
I didn't do it.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Jerry, did you do it?

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
I didn't do it.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
What's her algorithm?

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
I ain't got no algorithms over here.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
I hope her beautiful

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
sounding ghost

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
is hitting

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
high C-Boos

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
in their Reese Ways

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
keeping their children awake.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
What's the highest note you can hit?

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
You got pretty high there.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Start in your middle, like baritone, tenor.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
I want to see how high

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
you can actually hit a note.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
I was impressed though.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Is there a song that goes up to a certain point?

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Should we get a song?

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
I will always love you.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
I don't know the lyrics to that.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
I'm sorry.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
I know that part.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
But

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
I need to lead up to it.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Don't hit your

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
wagon to any real song.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
You

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
I want to lead up to it.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
You gave

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
me the best of me.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
And you gave

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
myself to.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
You treated me, treated me

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
good.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
And you made me

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
feel

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
like a cuckoo.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
What is that?

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Is that like an

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
A cup? What is the terminology?

56:18.000 --> 56:24.000
I think that was flat L.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
I'm sick of having these conversations

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
about head high versus body high

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
at the dispensary.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
I don't

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
get it. I'm never going to get it.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
It seems to me that if my body

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
gets high enough, my head's going to

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
freak out anyway.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
There's no logic to that

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
distinction.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Here's what I want to avoid.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Smoking pot and freaking out.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
I shouldn't be smoking pot. I'm 39.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
What am I doing with my life?

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
And then running into the street like Martin Lawrence in my

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
underwear.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
But I'm pot.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
I'm getting hungry and falling asleep.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
But

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
I just, you know,

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
how does that help?

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
It's more of a head high.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
What does that mean?

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
It's head high. That's stupid.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
I'm complaining about this.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
This is in my segment of complaining about things

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
you have no right to complain about.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
You can't tell the difference between those two things?

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Well, I don't know. I can't.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Your body gets high.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
What does that make any sense?

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
Your arms and legs don't work.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Your body is all...

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
That's not a thing, though.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Your head's not on top of a body

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
that is high.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
That's dumb.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Man, hold on.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Do you do drugs?

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
No, I just...

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
If I find out that you have been doing drugs...

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
I have a lot of anxiety

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
and I have a prescription.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
This is the great state of California.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
So you got renewed?

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Yeah.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
What'd you get?

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Body high.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
I'm just going to commit to that.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
I don't know.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Body...

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
Banana fruit, yuccas,

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Obi-Wan, Skywalker,

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Yoda,

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Plenty, OG,

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Cush Cush, the orange...

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Orange dynamite.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Like, give it a rest.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
You guys are high.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Like, you go into these places

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
and it's like...

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
You guys are high when you...

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
When you furnished this place, you were high

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
when you said, let's open a pot store.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
You were high last night when you took inventory.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
You're high when you're giving me change.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
You're...

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
It's adorable.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
I'll take 20 grams of

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Apple Nut

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Cinecruise.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Dan...

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
The Terminator...

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
I want to give you a challenge.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
I love Apple Nut Cinecruise,

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
but would you name me three other strains

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
of weed at your dispensary?

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Yeah, like Octo...

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
And...

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Blue Monkey

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
and...

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Critter Bitter...

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Back Tax...

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Romney Razor...

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Back to the Future Part Cush...

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Back to the Future Part Cush...

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Desperado...

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Mindy Kaling...

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Extreme...

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Did Spencer get here?

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Spencer, come up on stage right now.

59:48.000 --> 59:54.000
Spencer, our Dungeon Master, get up here.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
And also, before Spencer sets up,

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
a reminder, Halloween,

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
what's the Harmontown right before Halloween?

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
There's one on the 22nd

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
and then there's one on the 29th.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000
And for the 29th, I would say that is our Halloween night.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Dan and I

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
and Aaron,

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
we will all be dressed as

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Jarith from the movie Labyrinth, David Bowie's character.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
And we encourage you all to come here.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
We want a room full of Jariths.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
We want the more Jariths the better

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
and may the best Jarith win.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
And we're all going to find some poor fucking bar

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
in Los Angeles.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
And I want 900 Jariths to walk into that bar.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
So please, October 29th,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
please come in your Jarith costume.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
You got a mic over there, Spencer?

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Did anyone who wasn't drinking as much as me remember,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
did Adam Goldberg close the show last week?

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
He did. Adam, are you here?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Yeah.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
If I recall, you sang an aria to End Our Show last time.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Did he come up on stage?

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
He did. He stood right here and he sang a...

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
It's all a blackout.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
He sang like a Man of La Mancha kind of thing up here.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
It was fantastic.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Was it good? It ended our show.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Well, I don't know. Maybe people got mad and left.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
No, it was triumph.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
I can't remember.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
It was a triumph.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Spencer, catch us up with one of your patented Spencer recaps.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000
All right. Let's see here.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
When we last met, our heroes...

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Your guys are throwing me off.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
When we last met, our heroes were turning in a quest

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000
to the captain of the Wardens, Ferris.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Played by Greg Poops.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
It was cool.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
After getting the quest turned in,

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000
they adjourned to the tavern where they met with Chacha.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Chacha reminded them of their encounter with Tylenol with Codeine,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
a mystical unicorn,

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000
revealed to be the patron saint of the Connie Forest.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
There was a guy who gave you guys horses.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
He gave you a strange emerald dagger.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Right.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:16.000
You were introduced to the hastily cobbled together figure, Admiral Darkstar.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000
It was said that he owns...

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Lords over part of the forest that Tylenol lives in,

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
and that there's an evil part of the forest

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
that is threatening to overtake the good part of the forest.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:33.000
The forces of Admiral Darkstar threaten to overtake the forest of Connie through the shadows.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
And he's an admiral in what, Navy?

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
He's got a... You don't know.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
I mean, you don't have, like, the internet.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Okay.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
All right.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Snap.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Dungeon Snap.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
It's a very snarky god.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
You got Dungeon Snap.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
All right, so...

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
If Dungeon Snap me

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Feeding my bosom like the ocean

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Deep as my heart

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
How? Snap. Dungeon.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Snap. Dungeon.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Snap!

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
You guys are, you guys are clapping

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
wearily like anyone asked you to clap, like...

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Dan, that got precisely the amount of applause that deserved.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
I didn't want any.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
So, and I resent you acting like I wanted any.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
No, by going, by slow clapping it.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Like a tired old rich uncle.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
No, they were just punctuating it.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
All right, Spencer, where do we stand right now?

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000
You had fell in asleep at camp.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
You awakened a stupor and you're not sure exactly what's happening.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Tylenol with codeine is gone.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Was he really there or did you imagine the whole thing?

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.000
All the same, you feel like you should investigate the forest of shadows.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Where did Mulraine Sedona go?

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Our half elf companion.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
You want to come up here?

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Is she playing? I don't know.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Well, I know she was gone last week

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
and we just went and hung out with the unicorns

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
and I don't think she's there.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
In your high adventures you had managed to wander away

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
from your compatriot Mulraine Sedona

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
but being a ranger adept at tracking

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
she's managed to find you.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:29.000
You'll never get away.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Yeah, that's good dungeon mastering there.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
All right.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Spencer!

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Spencer, I investigate our surroundings.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.000
You see a winding path that heads towards gnarled dark trees.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Perhaps these are twisted by the arcane workings of the forest of shadows.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I think that's where we're going.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
You know, we're still first level.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
We keep acting like we're up for bigger and bad or shit

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
but we keep getting our...

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
I don't know, I'm just a little worried.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I would like to exercise caution.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
I don't want to die.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
We're not level two.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Well, look, I'm a gnome barbarian

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
and I'm always spoiling for a fight.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000
There's one thing that I hate, it's a gnarled tree.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
I'm going to go right at those mother crows.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
We don't even know.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
So far we've been mercenaries,

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
like working for a promised reward, you know, some bubble.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Yeah, are we after anything right now?

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Well, now we're just aligned.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Now we're just caring about a unicorn's forest.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Spencer, what are we headed toward?

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
What's our goal right now?

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Admiral Darkstar hosts a dark ziggurat

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
brought deep within the forest of shadows where his dark cult...

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
What's a ziggurat again?

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:56.000
It's like a temple to ancient evil mayhaps

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000
where dark rituals and sacrifices and midnight sturns.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000
And what's a...

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Well, I have you, what's a duvet?

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
I don't know.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
It's just a blanket, right?

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
I thought it was a blanket.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000
It's a sheet that you put a blanket inside.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
It's the inside part.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
There's a duvet cover and then there's the duvet.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Yeah, you put the duvet in there.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Isn't that just a comforter?

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Do you have a duvet in your inventory?

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
He knows what a ziggurat is.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
I've got a bedroll.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Is that like a duvet?

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Yeah, I had a bedroll.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000
I lost my bedroll.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Spencer, I'm going to go out on a limb here.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Here's a bad pitch, crazy pitch.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Okay.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Like, hey, just spitball.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Like, we keep, it's a very dangerous life we're living.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000
And there's nothing wrong with just walking away.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Like, this dark forest is going to take over the light forest.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
I mean, is anyone really going to die?

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
It's just going to be a darker forest.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000
They're already like hazardous places.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
What sort of life are you going to go back to?

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
What do you got back home?

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Well, I'm not going to go back home.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I just want to do different adventures.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Do what?

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Well, you know, we don't even know who we are, man.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Like, what is this, what is this world?

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:21.000
I thought we made an agreement that when we met in the Mines of Calderon?

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Yeah.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
The Howling Mines of Calderon.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Dude, do you not remember the Howling Mines of Calderon?

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
It's not cool to bring that up.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.000
And I storm off, and I storm off into the woods.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I catch up with Quark.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Quark.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Sharpie.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
I'm Sharpie.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I'm sorry.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
I'm very sorry.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Should I leave?

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
No.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
No.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
I was speaking to the both of you.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Perhaps you should just kiss each other's ring of fires.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
And be happy.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Call back.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Why do we keep hanging out with a homophobic elf?

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
I'm not a homophobic.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Why are you, you're a homophobic.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
You're a homophobic by discouraging the homosexuality.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.000
I'm a homa and courage omic.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:16.000
I'm out of earshot of this because I've picked a sentimentally lit clearing in the woods.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.000
If possible, if there's a place where there's a lake, I'm looking at the lake.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000
But I'm not presuming the presence of a lake.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Is there a lake?

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:30.000
And I'm looking, and I'm seeing the reflection of my father's face on the water.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000
And I'm having flashbacks to my early life.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000
I'm just hearing echoey voiceover of things like,

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Sharpie, you've got to try harder than that.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000
You're no son of mine, mine, mine.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.000
I'm kissing my arrows.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
That's how I count.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000
If you guys are going to stand around and play grab-ass, I'm going to go toward the gnarled trees.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:07.000
If you want to part company, I'm more of an adventurer than maybe you are.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
I feel guilty and catch up a quirk.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I want to keep having my emotional moment, but I want to do it in turns.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000
I don't want to take up any more time than an average round of melee.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Do you want to do it in song, maybe?

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
No, no.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Do you want to look in the lake and maybe sing in a high falsetto?

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:30.000
I'm having a dexter flashback to a conversation with my dad and his magic workshop.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Dad, what are you doing?

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Making a wand, son.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Making a wand, son.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000
So is the wand magic automatically just because you make it?

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
You're magic. We're all magic.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000
I am magic.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
God damn it, you're going to hit.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Dad.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000
I hit you.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Ow!

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Sorry, son, it's not about you.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Dad, what is it? You can talk to me about anything.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
It's your mother.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
I had a mother?

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.000
You have a mother. I keep her in a hole underneath pounds and pounds of leaves.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:25.000
She's giving me a lot of shit lately for keeping her in that hole.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Just don't get mixed up with a woman and don't put her in a hole.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Also, I have pancreatic cancer.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:44.000
All right, I shake out of my doldrums and I find my compatriots newly invigorated by a recent emotional epiphany.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Meeting back up with your compatriots, they seem surprised that you've arrived so quickly.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I just had a flashback at the lake about my parents and I want to go back to my hometown.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000
That's right, son, believe in yourself.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.000
That fire inside of you is true and it's going to burn down any dishonesty.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000
I can hear him right now.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:12.000
And I'm not going to be able to give my all to this Admiral Darkstar mission while I'm listening to thoughts of my father.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
I got to go back and talk to him.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
I got to find out who I am.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Is there a chance that your father is Admiral Darkstar?

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000
You'd love that, wouldn't you?

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Maybe the atonement with the father in this mission is maybe a literal father.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Maybe what we're after is for you to atone with yourself and your lack of self-worth

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.000
and what you call your superiority complex is this weird inferiority complex

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000
because you never live up to the expectations your father put on you.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Promise me something, Quark.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.000
If I do this mission with you, we bring Admiral Darkstar to justice.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Come with me to my homeland.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:03.000
So I can learn who I am.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
I will do it under one condition.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000
And you have to make me a promise.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
I will.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:18.000
That she'll consecrate this pact in song.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:25.000
And I want you to hit a note higher than you've ever hit in this entire show.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:44.000
From volcanic mounds of mist nestled in gondor's shores, the Buttsalot clan majesty spread forever through the fields

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:52.000
and the heart of Zaron himself couldn't bring the skies to horn

01:12:52.000 --> 01:13:00.000
but the swords and steel and horses hides make brew inside the storm

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:08.000
and the heart of the mountain makes the Buttsalot's heart twice as strong

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:15.000
and if you want my steel inside you, don't do me wrong

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:23.000
because my father's father's horse groomsman was a mightier man than thee

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:31.000
and I'll poop the sun and oceans and I'll turn the skies to pee.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.000
That's hard to tell everybody. Thank you for coming.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000
We'll have a real adventure next week.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Well, next week apparently the skies turned to pee.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Spencer, our Dungeon Master.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Good job.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Erin McGathy recreating the role of Mole Rain, Santana, Saldana.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
All of you wonderful people here.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Julieta, also while we're at it, Katie Levine, our audio recording, Zac McKeever,

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Emily Gordon, producer, Daniel Cramer, program director, Justin Marshall, podcast producer,

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Mo Fathelbabonsai, director, Jenny Finer, artist.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Once again, I'm Jeff Davis.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Hear it for Dan Harmon, the mayor of Harmon Sound.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Dan.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Now we are here.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.000
It's Dan Adieu.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Dan Adieu, your light and heart will shine.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Good night, you motherfucker.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:15:18.000
We did it.
