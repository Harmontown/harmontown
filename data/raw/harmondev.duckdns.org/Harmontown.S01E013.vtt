{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:02.000\nHello!\n\n00:11.000 --> 00:15.000\nLadies and gentlemen, Harmontown is now in session!\n\n00:19.000 --> 00:23.000\nWelcome one and all, thank you so much for coming down here to Nerdmelt Theater in Hollywood, California.\n\n00:23.000 --> 00:27.000\nAnd thank you to all you beautiful weirdos listening on the podcast universe.\n\n00:27.000 --> 00:32.000\nPlease join me in welcoming the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon!\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:53.000\nThank you.\n\n00:53.000 --> 00:57.000\nTonight I'd like to complain a lot.\n\n00:57.000 --> 01:01.000\nJust in one of those moods, I have a lot of things I'd like to complain about.\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:07.000\nActually, I've categorized them all, specifically, because complaining isn't charismatic, ever.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:10.000\nYou could complain even if you had one leg.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:13.000\nIf you complained about it too much, people secretly behind your back would be like,\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:16.000\nhe won't shut the fuck up about it.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:18.000\nIt's like, just fucking own it, man.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:21.000\nBut the guy with one leg that comes in and goes like, hey, let's hop to it.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:24.000\nEveryone's like, Leonard owns it, he loves it.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:29.000\nComplaining primatologically is not an attractive feature.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:35.000\nStrangely enough, it seems to have been selected very highly in our species, because we all complain a lot.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:39.000\nBut it doesn't seem to turn anybody on, audiences don't like it.\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:44.000\nAnd especially in my situation, I find I have a lot of things to complain about.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:48.000\nSo I want to start a new feature, a new Harmontown feature,\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:53.000\npodcasts, they like little categories and features, little desk bits.\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:59.000\nSo I thought in the green room, we call this feature things I'm afraid to complain about,\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:03.000\nbecause it'll make me sound like an asshole.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:08.000\nThings dance afraid to complain about, things dance afraid to complain.\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:11.000\nWhere's the music?\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:13.000\nYeah.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:18.000\nI mean, here's a classic example, just to start you off, what do you mean, Dan?\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:20.000\nWhat kind of complaint can make you sound like an asshole?\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:22.000\nDoesn't every complaint make you sound like an asshole?\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:24.000\nNo, I complain about lots of stuff all the time.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:26.000\nThis show is very hard to do, by the way.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:28.000\nIt's hard to come down here.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:30.000\nYou think you're a small audience?\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:33.000\nI have a small heart.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:37.000\nBut here's a real humdinger.\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:42.000\nThings dance afraid about, number one.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:48.000\nMy gardener is doing something wrong.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:50.000\nI'm not finished.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:55.000\nI can't put my finger on it, but my decorator agrees.\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:57.000\nHe backed me up on it.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:02.000\nHe was leaving, my decorator looked at my front lawn and said,\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:04.000\nyour gardener is doing something wrong.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:06.000\nAnd I agree.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:08.000\nI said, Kurt, you're right.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:11.000\nIs your decorator Greek?\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:13.000\nOr gay?\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:15.000\nDid I make him gay?\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:17.000\nYou did a gay character?\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:20.000\nYeah, well, he is a gay character.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:22.000\nI don't think he would deny that.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:24.000\nHe's a decorator.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:28.000\nIf he's straight, he's required to act gay if he wants business.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:30.000\nHe buys pillows for a living.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:32.000\nHe knows where his bread's buttered.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:34.000\nDo you think that's a possibility that he's faking?\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:37.000\nI think the pressures are on.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:39.000\nI could imagine, for real,\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:41.000\neven though that seems like sitcom fodder.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:43.000\nTruthfully, if you were in the decorating business,\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:45.000\nI could picture the pressure being on you.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:50.000\nThe feeling of disappointment from the rich people\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:53.000\nthat answer the front door and you're like, hey, Carl.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:56.000\nI had to drop my wife off.\n\n03:56.000 --> 04:00.000\nI don't know.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:02.000\nI think there's probably pressure on him.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:04.000\nHe could be straight as an arrow.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:06.000\nThat doesn't matter, though.\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:08.000\nI have no complaints about that.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:12.000\nI have a complaint about the fact that the person\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:15.000\nwhose job it is to water and...\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:17.000\nI'm not even sure what his job is,\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:19.000\nbut he's doing something wrong.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:21.000\nThe plants feel lifeless.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:24.000\nAnd I'm not allowed to complain about that for obvious reasons.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:26.000\nYou guys don't have gardeners.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:29.000\nYour buildings have gardeners.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:32.000\nMy building had a gardener.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:35.000\nBut then when you own a home, you have a gardener.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:38.000\nIf you're going to commit to the archetype of rich guy\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:40.000\ncomplaining about gardeners and designers,\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:42.000\nI would say commit.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:44.000\nI'm bringing out the worst...\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:46.000\nThese are the worst things.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:48.000\nI don't want you liking me after this feature is done.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:51.000\nIf you did going in, I want you to go, Jesus Christ.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:53.000\nWhat gardener, decorator?\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:54.000\nGo fuck yourself.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:56.000\nComplaining about it.\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:57.000\nFuck you.\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:00.000\nThat's what I'm getting off of my chest.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:03.000\nThe plants feel lifeless outside.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:05.000\nSomething's going wrong out there.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:07.000\nAnd really, if the decorator hadn't said anything,\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:09.000\nI don't think I would have noticed.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:13.000\nHe's gay all right.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:15.000\nHere's the next one.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:17.000\nI don't like people trying to help me.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:19.000\nThat's a short one.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:22.000\nSays the guy who has a gardener and a decorator.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:27.000\nJeff, if that's where you're going,\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:29.000\nthis is going to be a bunch of slam dunks.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:33.000\nThat's not...\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:35.000\nSorry, are you one step ahead of me on that one?\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:36.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:39.000\nWell, I mean, this is a headline on this thing.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:41.000\nI will withhold my witty bone moans.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:45.000\nWell, I mean, I'm a dick.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:47.000\nThat's the point of the whole thing.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:49.000\nDo whatever you want, Jeff.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:52.000\nJust thank you for not trying to help me.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:58.000\nI went outside my house today,\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:02.000\nand there was some kind of sewer emergency happening.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:04.000\nThere was a yellow truck,\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:06.000\nand there were two people and dickies,\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:08.000\nand they were putting pitchforks down the hall,\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:10.000\nand tubes and stuff.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:12.000\nDickies like the fake turtlenecks?\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:14.000\nWhat are they called?\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:16.000\nIsn't dickies also the name of the fucking...\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:18.000\nWhat are those called?\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:20.000\nThose kind of industrial kind of cover all shirts.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:22.000\nYeah, they're called dickies. Thank you.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:26.000\nThey were sticking sticks down the hall.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:28.000\nI don't know if there was an alligator missing\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:30.000\nor something.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:32.000\nWe have a missing alligator.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:34.000\nGo out there.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:36.000\nWe got to go to each manhole one by one\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:38.000\nand poke down it.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:40.000\nIf it comes back bit off like a cartoon,\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:42.000\nthen we know we found the right manhole.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:44.000\nThen we got to figure out how to get that alligator\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:46.000\nback to its owner.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:48.000\nHe responds to the name Twinkie.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:52.000\nSo they're out there and they got cones.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:54.000\nLong story short, I don't think King Harmon\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:56.000\nis going to be able to get out of his garage.\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:58.000\nKing Harmon?\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.000\nYeah, that's just called myself King Harmon.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nIt's my garage.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:04.000\nIt's my street.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:06.000\nThey're in front of it. They're poking sticks down a hole.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nI went up to them and said,\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:10.000\ngood morning.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:12.000\nI'll be coming through here.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:14.000\nDo you think I'll fit?\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:16.000\nThey're like, yeah, you will.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:18.000\nSo I go up to my car\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nand Erin McGathy gets on the other side.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:22.000\nShe spent the night.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:24.000\nI think\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:26.000\nI think it's going somewhere.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:28.000\nDid you guys\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:32.000\nI think if I know what you mean,\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:34.000\nyes, I did play Fall Out New Vegas\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:36.000\nall night.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:38.000\nYes, I did.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nLet's just say\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:42.000\nin hardcore mode.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:44.000\nWhich is really cool, by the way.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:46.000\nFall Out New Vegas fans\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:48.000\nhere.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:50.000\nI made brief eye contact\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:52.000\nwith one of our few women\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:54.000\nin the audience. I projected shame\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:56.000\nunder your face.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.000\nI know, I know.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nYou're doing nothing wrong. You're just staring forward,\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:02.000\nlooking and listening. But as I was\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:04.000\nass-pulling, any video game people are like, oh god, girls.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nWhich is silly\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nbecause there's lots of girls and I'm sure they all like video games.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:10.000\nThat's the one-two punch\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:12.000\nof sexism and then reverse\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:14.000\nself-loathing.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:16.000\nThat's what nerd men do to women.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:18.000\nIt's the glass floor.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:20.000\nWith\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:22.000\nspikes on it.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:24.000\nIn the bottom of the hobby shop.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nNot very\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:28.000\nkingly.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\nNot very kingly, no. Not befitting a king.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nSo I get in my car and I back out\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nand the guy\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:36.000\nhe gets behind the car.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:38.000\nHe gets between the car and his poop\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:40.000\ntruck.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:42.000\nI can see him\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:44.000\ngesticulating.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:46.000\nHe looked like he was tossing\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:48.000\na pizza.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:50.000\nThat's not racist because he wasn't Italian.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:52.000\nThat's\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nhow I would describe what he was doing.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:56.000\nHe was like, hey, Luigi, oh, I want the motor\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\npizza. Just shaking his hands\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nlike a muppet.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nHe had sticks on his elbows and it was someone's\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:04.000\nbirthday. That's all I saw.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:06.000\nI'm\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\ngoing to do whatever I was going to\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\ndo.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:12.000\nMy goal isn't to back\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:14.000\nmy car into your poop truck.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:16.000\nI think that's the one thing I know is there.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:18.000\nI came over and said good morning to the poop\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:20.000\ntruck driver and said, I'm coming out.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nHe doesn't need, now he's standing\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nbetween my car and the thing he doesn't want\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nme to hit. All he's doing is making me\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:28.000\nhave less space to do my\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:30.000\nvery difficult why turn around a poop\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:32.000\ntruck. I was complaining about it the whole time\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:34.000\nand Aaron said he's trying to help you.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nI don't care.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:38.000\nThat's what I didn't like about him. He tried to\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:40.000\nhelp me. I don't like it.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nYeah.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nI don't like him.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nI don't have to say anymore about that. I resent\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nthe amount that he's been in my life already.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\nI want him out.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nThere are times when people try to help you and\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nthey get in the way.

guy.\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:18.000\nYeah, I know the guy's in jail\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:20.000\nfor the next 14 years or something.\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:22.000\nWow.\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:24.000\nIt was like finally something worked out.\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:26.000\nAnd you left all that to come here, huh?\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:30.000\nThat was like 2 years ago.\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:32.000\nReally?\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:34.000\nThat was the point where you started.\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:36.000\nI should get a passport.\n\n49:36.000 --> 49:38.000\nI already had one, but I need to\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:40.000\nI really need to get the fuck out of here.\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:44.000\nThe first thing pushing me out was the music.\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:46.000\nYeah, we're talking about the music.\n\n49:46.000 --> 49:48.000\nAlright, just polka music.\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:50.000\nRepeat what you said as an explanation\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:52.000\nfor how polka sounding music\n\n49:52.000 --> 49:54.000\nends up coming out of a boom box\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:56.000\nwith the guys that are painting my ceiling.\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:58.000\nWho don't seem Polish.\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:00.000\nBut the music sounds so...\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:02.000\nI'm from Milwaukee.\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:04.000\nI know Polish culture.\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:08.000\nI bowl.\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:10.000\nI have like a 150 average.\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:14.000\nI get spares and stuff.\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:16.000\nThis start is not as interesting as just\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:18.000\nGerman immigrants coming to the north of the country\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:20.000\nand just settling there and mixing with\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:22.000\nthe people from there.\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:24.000\nAnd that's why people like me are white.\n\n50:24.000 --> 50:26.000\nIn Mexico.\n\n50:28.000 --> 50:30.000\nSo yeah, that's basically it.\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:32.000\nIt's just regional music\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:34.000\nand it's awful.\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:36.000\nBut it's mostly from\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:38.000\nthe north of the country.\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:40.000\nBut I assume like, yeah, because country western\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:42.000\nit sounds pretty similar.\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:44.000\nAnd a lot of like...\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:46.000\nWhen you get specific with a specific type\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:48.000\nof music and you're just listening to that\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:50.000\ntype of music, I can't\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:52.000\ntell the difference between\n\n50:52.000 -->

Let's see here.\n\n01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000\nWhen we last met, our heroes...\n\n01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000\nYour guys are throwing me off.\n\n01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000\nWhen we last met, our heroes were turning in a quest\n\n01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000\nto the captain of the Wardens, Ferris.\n\n01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000\nPlayed by Greg Poops.\n\n01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000\nIt was cool.\n\n01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000\nAfter getting the quest turned in,\n\n01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000\nthey adjourned to the tavern where they met with Chacha.\n\n01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000\nChacha reminded them of their encounter with Tylenol with Codeine,\n\n01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000\na mystical unicorn,\n\n01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000\nrevealed to be the patron saint of the Connie Forest.\n\n01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000\nThere was a guy who gave you guys horses.\n\n01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000\nHe gave you a strange emerald dagger.\n\n01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000\nRight.\n\n01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:16.000\nYou were introduced to the hastily cobbled together figure, Admiral Darkstar.\n\n01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000\nIt was said that he owns...\n\n01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000\nLords over part of the forest that Tylenol lives in,\n\n01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000\nand that there's an evil part of the forest\n\n01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000\nthat is threatening to overtake the good part of the forest.\n\n01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:33.000\nThe forces of Admiral Darkstar threaten to overtake the forest of Connie through the shadows.\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000\nAnd he's an admiral in what, Navy?\n\n01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000\nHe's got a... You don't know.\n\n01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000\nI mean, you don't have, like, the internet.\n\n01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000\nOkay.\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000\nAll right.\n\n01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000\nSnap.\n\n01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000\nDungeon Snap.\n\n01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000\nIt's a very snarky god.\n\n01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000\nYou got Dungeon Snap.\n\n01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000\nAll right, so...\n\n01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000\nIf Dungeon Snap me\n\n01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000\nFeeding my bosom like the ocean\n\n01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000\nDeep as my heart\n\n01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000\nHow? Snap. Dungeon.\n\n01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000\nSnap. Dungeon.\n\n01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000\nSnap!\n\n01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000\nYou guys are, you guys are clapping\n\n01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000\nwearily like anyone asked you to clap, like...\n\n01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000\nDan, that got precisely the amount of applause that deserved.\n\n01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000\nI didn't want any.\n\n01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000\nSo, and I resent you acting like I wanted any.\n\n01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000\nNo, by going, by slow clapping it.\n\n01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000\nLike a tired old rich uncle.\n\n01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000\nNo, they were just punctuating it.\n\n01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000\nAll right, Spencer, where do we stand right now?\n\n01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000\nYou had fell in asleep at camp.\n\n01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nYou awakened a stupor and you're not sure exactly what's happening.\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000\nTylenol with codeine is gone.\n\n01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000\nWas he really there or did you imagine the whole thing?\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.000\nAll the same, you feel like you should investigate the forest of shadows.\n\n01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000\nWhere did Mulraine Sedona go?\n\n01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000\nOur half elf companion.\n\n01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000\nYou want to come up here?\n\n01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000\nIs she playing? I don't know.\n\n01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000\nWell, I know she was gone last week\n\n01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000\nand we just went and hung out with the unicorns\n\n01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000\nand I don't think she's there.\n\n01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000\nIn your high adventures you had managed to wander away\n\n01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000\nfrom your compatriot Mulraine Sedona\n\n01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000\nbut being a ranger adept at tracking\n\n01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000\nshe's managed to find you.\n\n01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:29.000\nYou'll never get away.\n\n01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000\nYeah, that's good dungeon mastering there.\n\n01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000\nAll right.\n\n01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000\nSpencer!\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000\nSpencer, I investigate our surroundings.\n\n01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.000\nYou see a winding path that heads towards gnarled dark trees.\n\n01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000\nPerhaps these are twisted by the arcane workings of the forest of shadows.\n\n01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000\nI think that's where we're going.\n\n01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000\nYou know, we're still first level.\n\n01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000\nWe keep acting like we're up for bigger and bad or shit\n\n01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000\nbut we keep getting our...\n\n01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000\nI don't know, I'm just a little worried.\n\n01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000\nI would like to exercise caution.\n\n01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000\nI don't want to die.\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000\nWe're not level two.\n\n01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:14.000\nWell, look, I'm a gnome barbarian\n\n01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000\nand I'm always spoiling for a fight.\n\n01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000\nThere's one thing that I hate, it's a gnarled tree.\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000\nI'm going to go right at those mother crows.\n\n01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000\nWe don't even know.\n\n01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000\nSo far we've been mercenaries,\n\n01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000\nlike working for a promised reward, you know, some bubble.\n\n01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000\nYeah, are we after anything right now?\n\n01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000\nWell, now we're just aligned.\n\n01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000\nNow we're just caring about a unicorn's forest.\n\n01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000\nSpencer, what are we headed toward?\n\n01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000\nWhat's our goal right now?\n\n01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000\nAdmiral Darkstar hosts a dark ziggurat\n\n01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000\nbrought deep within the forest of shadows where his dark cult...\n\n01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000\nWhat's a ziggurat again?\n\n01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:56.000\nIt's like a temple to ancient evil mayhaps\n\n01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000\nwhere dark rituals and sacrifices and midnight sturns.\n\n01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000\nAnd what's a...\n\n01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000\nWell, I have you, what's a duvet?\n\n01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000\nIt's just a blanket, right?\n\n01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000\nI thought it was a blanket.\n\n01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000\nIt's a sheet that you put a blanket inside.\n\n01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000\nIt's the inside part.\n\n01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000\nThere's a duvet cover and then there's the duvet.\n\n01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000\nYeah, you put the duvet in there.\n\n01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000\nIsn't that just a comforter?\n\n01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000\nDo you have a duvet in your inventory?\n\n01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000\nHe knows what a ziggurat is.\n\n01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000\nI've got a bedroll.\n\n01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000\nIs that like a duvet?\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000\nYeah, I had a bedroll.\n\n01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000\nI lost my bedroll.\n\n01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000\nSpencer, I'm going to go out on a limb here.\n\n01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000\nHere's a bad pitch, crazy pitch.\n\n01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000\nOkay.\n\n01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000\nLike, hey, just spitball.\n\n01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.000\nLike, we keep, it's a very dangerous life we're living.\n\n01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000\nAnd there's nothing wrong with just walking away.\n\n01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.000\nLike, this dark forest is going to take over the light forest.\n\n01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000\nI mean, is anyone really going to die?\n\n01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000\nIt's just going to be a darker forest.\n\n01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000\nThey're already like hazardous places.\n\n01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000\nWhat sort of life are you going to go back to?\n\n01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000\nWhat do you got back home?\n\n01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000\nWell, I'm not going to go back home.\n\n01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000\nI just want to do different adventures.\n\n01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000\nDo what?\n\n01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000\nWell, you know, we don't even know who we are, man.\n\n01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:15.000\nLike, what is this, what is this world?\n\n01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:21.000\nI thought we made an agreement that when we met in the Mines of Calderon?\n\n01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000\nYeah.\n\n01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000\nThe Howling Mines of Calderon.\n\n01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000\nDude, do you not remember the Howling Mines of Calderon?\n\n01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000\nIt's not cool to bring that up.\n\n01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.000\nAnd I storm off, and I storm off into the woods.\n\n01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000\nI catch up with Quark.\n\n01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000\nQuark.\n\n01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000\nSharpie.\n\n01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000\nI'm Sharpie.\n\n01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000\nI'm very sorry.\n\n01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000\nShould I leave?\n\n01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000\nNo.\n\n01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000\nNo.\n\n01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000\nI was speaking to the both of you.\n\n01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000\nPerhaps you should just kiss each other's ring of fires.\n\n01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000\nAnd be happy.\n\n01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000\nCall back.\n\n01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000\nWhy do we keep hanging out with a homophobic elf?\n\n01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000\nI'm not a homophobic.\n\n01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000\nWhy are you, you're a homophobic.\n\n01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000\nYou're a homophobic by discouraging the homosexuality.\n\n01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.000\nI'm a homa and courage omic.\n\n01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:16.000\nI'm out of earshot of this because I've picked a sentimentally lit clearing in the woods.\n\n01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.000\nIf possible, if there's a place where there's a lake, I'm looking at the lake.\n\n01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000\nBut I'm not presuming the presence of a lake.\n\n01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000\nIs there a lake?\n\n01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:30.000\nAnd I'm looking, and I'm seeing the reflection of my father's face on the water.\n\n01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000\nAnd I'm having flashbacks to my early life.\n\n01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000\nI'm just hearing echoey voiceover of things like,\n\n01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:44.000\nSharpie, you've got to try harder than that.\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000\nYou're no son of mine, mine, mine.\n\n01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.000\nI'm kissing my arrows.\n\n01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000\nThat's how I count.\n\n01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000\nIf you guys are going to stand around and play grab-ass, I'm going to go toward the gnarled trees.\n\n01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:07.000\nIf you want to part company, I'm more of an adventurer than maybe you are.\n\n01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000\nI feel guilty and catch up a quirk.\n\n01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.000\nI want to keep having my emotional moment, but I want to do it in turns.\n\n01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000\nI don't want to take up any more time than an average round of melee.\n\n01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000\nDo you want to do it in song, maybe?\n\n01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000\nNo, no.\n\n01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000\nDo you want to look in the lake and maybe sing in a high falsetto?\n\n01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:30.000\nI'm having a dexter flashback to a conversation with my dad and his magic workshop.\n\n01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000\nDad, what are you doing?\n\n01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000\nMaking a wand, son.\n\n01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:41.000\nMaking a wand, son.\n\n01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000\nSo is the wand magic automatically just because you make it?\n\n01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000\nYou're magic.
