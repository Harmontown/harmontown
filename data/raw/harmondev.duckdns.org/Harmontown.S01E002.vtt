WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.200
Good evening.

00:01.200 --> 00:06.720
Parmenians, Parmenianettes,

00:06.720 --> 00:10.240
herey, herey, welcome to the best night of your lives.

00:11.520 --> 00:16.020
Let's welcome the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:16.020 --> 00:17.020
Thank you.

00:17.020 --> 00:18.020
Thank you.

00:18.020 --> 00:19.020
Thank you.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.020
Thank you.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.020
Thank you.

00:21.020 --> 00:22.020
Thank you.

00:22.020 --> 00:23.020
Thank you.

00:23.020 --> 00:24.020
Thank you.

00:24.020 --> 00:25.020
Thank you.

00:25.020 --> 00:26.020
Thank you.

00:26.020 --> 00:27.020
Thank you.

00:27.020 --> 00:28.020
Thank you.

00:28.020 --> 00:29.020
Who needs a card?

00:29.020 --> 00:30.020
Who needs a card?

00:30.020 --> 00:31.020
Please.

00:31.020 --> 00:32.020
What a crowd.

00:32.020 --> 00:33.020
What a crowd.

00:33.020 --> 00:35.020
I'd like to welcome and thank our acting comptroller, Erin McGathy.

00:35.020 --> 00:36.020
Oh!

00:36.020 --> 00:37.020
Hi.

00:37.020 --> 00:41.020
I'm very nervous and insecure.

00:41.020 --> 00:42.020
Don't be alarmed.

00:42.020 --> 00:43.620
Jeff just texted me.

00:43.620 --> 00:46.100
If you're on stage right now, turn off your phone.

00:46.100 --> 00:49.020
I'm already failing.

00:49.020 --> 00:53.320
Well, with advice like that flowing in, how can?

00:53.320 --> 00:54.320
Don't worry.

00:54.320 --> 01:02.480
also is my acting girlfriend. We've talked about it on the drive up here. We're both

01:02.480 --> 01:09.080
absolute consummate preparationists. We simply just, we really...

01:09.080 --> 01:13.920
So we're sure that we invented a word. Yes. We actually sat down and said, what will

01:13.920 --> 01:17.400
the word be for people who prepare a lot? And we said, let's stutter as we say it.

01:17.400 --> 01:24.800
Alright. It was all planned out. Every experience. This is the inception of talking. Everything's

01:24.800 --> 01:28.600
planned out. You'll record it and you'll go back over and go, no the van backed over

01:28.600 --> 01:34.760
as they were slalloming. Which works perfectly. What a Jack movie. Can we admit, no? Oh,

01:34.760 --> 01:43.640
okay, no. Alright. Alright. Hey, man. I am not Napoleon. I am a populist. I'm Obama.

01:43.640 --> 01:51.880
If you don't like, if you like something, I like it. Inception. Three dreams at the

01:51.880 --> 02:03.720
same time. Couple notes. They start that movie, Two Dreams Deep. I wish I could use the N

02:03.720 --> 02:11.120
word. It's like, please. It's a fucking movie about dreams being real. Give me a taste.

02:11.120 --> 02:27.080
Don't assume I'm stupid. It's dramatic music. But step into it. Every pool has stairs. You

02:27.080 --> 02:35.280
just wander in. Show me an example of a dream. A guy being in the dream. Hey, man. You enjoying

02:35.280 --> 02:42.600
that soup? Yes, I am. It's delicious. You know what I love about it? It's so real. Psych.

02:42.600 --> 02:50.280
You're dreaming. I thought that soup was real. So in conclusion, sir, I think you could use

02:50.280 --> 03:00.400
my services. You're hired. It's the way that you use it. And then do the credits. And then

03:00.400 --> 03:04.600
in the credits, like reveal, like, okay, there's a little call to adventure. There were two

03:04.600 --> 03:11.880
dreams deep. And then have the threshold be, we need to go three dreams deep, maybe. Or

03:11.880 --> 03:17.040
three deep. That's never charismatic when you forget the are in dreams. It makes you,

03:17.040 --> 03:24.200
that makes all of you go, I should be up there. I can say the word dreams. Well, the wizards

03:24.200 --> 03:33.000
behind the curtain. No longer. The emperor's clothes are here. Which is the name of your

03:33.000 --> 03:39.640
autobiography. Both of those things. I got a little sidetracked. I want to make a promise

03:39.640 --> 03:45.160
to you that's not going to happen tonight. Harmontown is, for those of you who have

03:45.160 --> 03:50.280
not been here nine, ten times, we've done this. It's a town meeting. I think that's very

03:50.280 --> 03:57.480
clear from the description of the show, which is now going to be a weekly podcast. It seems

03:57.480 --> 04:03.880
like that deserves applause. It's a thing that's seen when a comic says I just had a baby. And

04:03.880 --> 04:09.680
then half the time they didn't. You ever notice that? You notice the comics, they always say

04:09.680 --> 04:14.280
they had babies. And then they just, they're just taking you for a fucking ride. They had

04:14.280 --> 04:18.080
a baby and you go, where do you go? AIDS.

04:18.080 --> 04:24.320
Danda's, Dana Gould. You didn't have a baby, Dana Gould.

04:24.320 --> 04:28.760
And as exclusively observational comic, comic humor.

04:28.760 --> 04:35.640
In keeping with my meta-sensibility, they got me fired. I'm a comics comic. Comics,

04:35.640 --> 04:45.760
comics, comics. It's like the first scene of Inception. Hard to follow. Labyrinthine.

04:45.760 --> 04:51.160
You know, like Back to the Future. No. That movie started with a kid who wasn't time traveling.

04:51.160 --> 04:59.240
I don't mean to shake my cane at you, Christopher Nolan. Did he direct that?

04:59.240 --> 05:00.240
I don't know.

05:00.240 --> 05:05.640
David Finchman? Batman? Who directed it? That doesn't matter.

05:05.640 --> 05:11.880
Let's hear it for Back to the Future.

05:11.880 --> 05:15.840
Tonight we wanted to, the concern was that Aaron is stepping in for Jeff so that the

05:15.840 --> 05:21.320
night would, my fear with people that are couples, entertaining people is that it will

05:21.320 --> 05:24.360
devolve very quickly into a kind of Regis and Kathy thing.

05:24.360 --> 05:25.360
Well it's so hard to say.

05:25.360 --> 05:28.520
Where's you youngsters, Regis and Kelly?

05:28.520 --> 05:31.880
You love me so much. So you were worried you were going to be distracted by my beautiful

05:31.880 --> 05:32.880
face.

05:32.880 --> 05:36.280
Yeah, that it would be saccharin or that we'd go, remember that time you did that? No,

05:36.280 --> 05:37.280
you did it.

05:37.280 --> 05:47.600
But you know, so I want to, I think that saying that out loud will keep that from happening.

05:47.600 --> 05:48.600
I'm probably wrong.

05:48.600 --> 05:49.600
Well let's forget it.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.600
Okay.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.600
For now.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.600
You're so cute tonight.

05:52.600 --> 05:57.600
You look very handsome. Look how thin Dan looks.

05:57.600 --> 06:02.560
See, it's not happening. This isn't a morning show.

06:02.560 --> 06:08.640
You all should see how Danny looks underneath those clothes. I see how he looks naked. Because

06:08.640 --> 06:13.560
we're dating and we're so in love. Am I doing this right?

06:13.560 --> 06:17.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You gave me a flashback when you said, to this morning we were having

06:17.800 --> 06:20.760
breakfast and then breakfast turned into like 3 p.m.

06:20.760 --> 06:27.760
Breakfast on each other's bits. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

06:27.760 --> 06:28.760
The,

06:28.760 --> 06:29.760
We were having breakfast this morning.

06:29.760 --> 06:35.400
I said, oh, you look like you lost weight and then I lifted up my, I went like that.

06:35.400 --> 06:40.800
That's what the guy at the bar did. Except you can do it. You're fine. I love you guys.

06:40.800 --> 06:44.560
But this guy did it. I was like, get out. I got up out of a booth at a restaurant and

06:44.560 --> 06:47.560
then somebody said, oh, you look, yo, where'd it go? Where's the tummy? And I said, here

06:47.560 --> 06:48.560
it is.

06:48.560 --> 06:53.760
And this guy at the bar went, he was talking to his friend and so you have to, I have to,

06:53.760 --> 06:58.480
you have to rewind, put your play head where I lift the shirt and you'll know where I do

06:58.480 --> 07:03.840
it. But I'm rewinding. Now you're from, this is like inception.

07:03.840 --> 07:04.840
Knock your chair over.

07:04.840 --> 07:12.840
Whoa, that always wakes you up. Where, what are the suitcases with the things? Come on

07:12.840 --> 07:13.840
guys.

07:13.840 --> 07:17.000
And what is Ellen Page, what is Ellen Page's role in that whole movie? She's learning

07:17.000 --> 07:20.480
how to do it. She never does it. She never does it.

07:20.480 --> 07:24.440
We're alienating them, honey. They love inception.

07:24.440 --> 07:29.200
I love, I thought that was great. A lot of them left a lot of Rotten Tomatoes reviews

07:29.200 --> 07:36.280
that they're deeply ashamed of, but they got to fucking stick it out. Three years later,

07:36.280 --> 07:43.120
you can't fucking let it go. You're the same way about goodwill hunting, you little fuckers.

07:43.120 --> 07:52.560
How many of you own it? Did you buy it? Fuck you, buddy. I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. I'm

07:52.560 --> 07:59.040
sorry. Mixed signals. I'm sorry. Thank you for being honest. Fuck you for lying, all

07:59.040 --> 08:04.120
of you. Because none of you own it. Wait, no, you were all honest too. You didn't raise

08:04.120 --> 08:08.440
your hands. Thank you all for being honest. Fuck me for not liking goodwill hunting. It's

08:08.440 --> 08:12.720
a great movie. Listen to the name. You like those apples?

08:12.720 --> 08:20.840
Hey, hey, no, no, answer the question. Do you like apples? I, I, fuck you. You fucking

08:20.840 --> 08:29.720
dork. No, no, no, just answer it. Okay, yes, I like apples, which, okay, you're putting

08:29.720 --> 08:35.400
me in the awkward position of having a stance on fucking apples. You're an idiot. But yes,

08:35.400 --> 08:44.200
I like apples. I just got a phone number. I don't, please, you're embarrassing yourself.

08:44.200 --> 08:52.520
Me, my parents, humanity, giraffes, any errant spy drones passing over, every, the thermograph

08:52.520 --> 08:58.560
of you is embarrassing. Holding a phone number, bragging about it with the apple tea up. Fuck

08:58.560 --> 09:03.280
you. It's not, you don't give that movie an Oscar. What you get from that is 10 more

09:03.280 --> 09:09.720
movies like that. Saving the Rebecca's Dreaming. Good, silvering.

09:09.720 --> 09:15.680
Logline. Logline for saving the Rebecca's Dreaming. Rebecca is a small town girl who's

09:15.680 --> 09:18.280
been in the big cities. She's coming back. They don't have loglines. They're fucking

09:18.280 --> 09:22.760
pieces of shit. All they have is a special font that looks like on Golden Pond. That's

09:22.760 --> 09:31.520
all they have. Goodwill hunting. It means nothing. That's dumb. You can't just string

09:31.520 --> 09:39.600
words together. Robocop. Fuck you. Awesome. Oscar. Where's the Oscar for Robocop? Thank

09:39.600 --> 09:47.480
you, gentlemen. And lady. So we're at Little Don's. He left up your sweater. I left up

09:47.480 --> 09:51.760
my shirt and the guy goes, so put the play head back to, I get out of the booth and the

09:51.760 --> 09:58.840
guy, I go, so this is the guy, and so I got to tell you where the camera is. Okay. This

09:58.840 --> 10:06.880
is, you're me, all of you. I'll play myself. You just lifted your shirt. So he's talking

10:06.880 --> 10:12.160
to his friend. Who's identical? They're both like, they're both built like me. I don't

10:12.160 --> 10:15.000
know if it's important to say that. They both look like big burly bears. They're both

10:15.000 --> 10:21.760
like, they're really good at pool. And that's not a compliment. They look like guys that's

10:21.760 --> 10:26.680
like, I don't know what Trevor and Joey are skilled at, and then you play pool with them

10:26.680 --> 10:31.600
and you're like, oh. Oh, they're good at pool. They're good at pool. Oh. All right. So the

10:31.600 --> 10:37.040
guy's at the bar of this restaurant, which is two feet from the booth. I stand up. Someone

10:37.040 --> 10:40.920
says, you look like, where's your belly? Where is it? I can't find it. That's a really

10:40.920 --> 10:48.200
nice thing to say. That was me. Oh, some lady. The guy said fucking gross. He looked at my

10:48.200 --> 10:54.520
belly and said fucking gross. And you don't blame them. Who cares? My theory. This is

10:54.520 --> 11:00.440
a morning show. There might be coffee in this cup. My theory on that guy is that he was

11:00.440 --> 11:04.680
an is homophobic. So we saw a man left up his shirt and he didn't want his buddy to think

11:04.680 --> 11:08.920
that he liked it. So reflexively, he was like, this is gross. I don't like it. I don't like

11:08.920 --> 11:17.040
it. I would never suck at it. That's a good girlfriend at any rate. The guy called me

11:17.040 --> 11:23.080
gross. He just wants to fuck you. That's a good girlfriend. Well, that's my, that's

11:23.080 --> 11:28.840
my explanation for anyone who's ever rude to me. So stop trying to fuck me so hard.

11:28.840 --> 11:41.640
Mom. My mom's dad. Here is not a good girlfriend. You woke me up at 5.40 this morning. You weren't

11:41.640 --> 11:49.800
awake. You decided that in your sleep, you were having such a great dream. But I was

11:49.800 --> 11:59.760
awakened at 5.40 a.m. to Aaron saying, Dan, Dan, Dan. Oh, fuck shit. Look, look and get

11:59.760 --> 12:03.600
it. You got to do that. Hold up the stick. Look at the stick. And she's pointing the

12:03.600 --> 12:08.600
corner of the room. And I, what's the stick? She's got the microphone. Hold up the stick.

12:08.600 --> 12:18.080
You have to do it. And I, okay, I'm holding it. And she went. And then at 7.40, I'm like

12:18.080 --> 12:23.400
still two hours later, I'm like staring at the ceiling worried about my finances. Every

12:23.400 --> 12:29.200
once in a while, she's like. So like the stick dream is amazing. It's got like, it's got

12:29.200 --> 12:34.520
like a comic figure in it. Like Charlie Callas comes out later as the, as the stick party.

12:34.520 --> 12:41.400
Raise your hand if you know who Charlie Callas is. There are five people, six people in their

12:41.400 --> 12:46.240
hands. Most of them are our friends. Because they've all gotten drunk with Jeff Davis and

12:46.240 --> 12:49.880
he's made you watch Charlie Callas on YouTube for three hours.

12:49.880 --> 12:53.280
Charlie Callas is this incredibly unfunny comic from

12:53.280 --> 12:54.840
Sweetie. He's dead.

12:54.840 --> 13:03.320
Oh, he is dead. He's a dead unfunny comic from the six seasons, 70s who for no reason just

13:03.320 --> 13:07.720
makes nonsense noises in the middle of explaining stories that no one cares about.

13:07.720 --> 13:13.040
Why don't you give us an example? Charlie Callas impression is impeccable.

13:13.040 --> 13:18.480
Can you give us a suggestion for an activity that Charlie Callas might talk about?

13:18.480 --> 13:21.480
Sure. Sure. What's an activity? Pool.

13:21.480 --> 13:28.800
Pool? All right. So me and my friends, we went to the pool hall and one of them grabbed

13:28.800 --> 13:35.840
a cue off the wall and I was like, and then he took the pool and took the pool ball and

13:35.840 --> 13:43.200
put it on the thing and I was like, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.

13:43.200 --> 13:46.400
There's a phone call? Yeah. Sorry. It doesn't make sense.

13:46.400 --> 13:47.400
Yeah. Yeah.

13:47.400 --> 14:00.600
Hello. This is pool calling. And then we all went home.

14:00.600 --> 14:01.600
Thank you.

14:01.600 --> 14:09.320
Yeah. Good job applauding that because Charlie Callas is dead, but his wife, Rebecca Callas

14:09.320 --> 14:12.680
isn't. I'm sorry, honey. Come on up here.

14:12.680 --> 14:18.360
My husband is just fucking crying and she just blows her brains everywhere.

14:18.360 --> 14:24.280
But as she's blowing her brains, she says like, I'm going to kill. I'm going to kill.

14:24.280 --> 14:33.560
I'm going to kill. It'll be so funny when you Google it.

14:33.560 --> 14:38.200
So Aaron and I have a perfect relationship, which is why, and also Aaron has a podcast

14:38.200 --> 14:42.600
about relationships because, you know, do you remember the name of it?

14:42.600 --> 14:46.160
It's this feels terrible. All right. I just wanted you to say it.

14:46.160 --> 14:49.280
Oh, I'm sorry. Does someone boo?

14:49.280 --> 14:55.240
Yeah. Well, they're booing your awkward approach to integrated marketing. Right. They're not

14:55.240 --> 14:59.160
booing your podcast. They're booing. Like if Calgon came in and said, that sounds like

14:59.160 --> 15:07.680
a clean situation, then they go boo. Thank you for sponsoring Harmontown. Fuck you for

15:07.680 --> 15:08.680
shoehorning it.

15:08.680 --> 15:09.680
Sure.

15:09.680 --> 15:10.680
Should we talk about?

15:10.680 --> 15:12.960
Oh yeah. I know. I'm sorry. You're saying we have a perfect relationship.

15:12.960 --> 15:19.160
Right. Right. That's the facade. This is like Sherman's March or I never saw it.

15:19.160 --> 15:26.800
It's like Inception. You think it's a dream and the perfect relationship is going to turn

15:26.800 --> 15:31.000
out to not be perfect. Like Inception. Like the guy eating the soup is going to turn out

15:31.000 --> 15:37.040
to fucking that movie. Really, you guys are going to just stick to it. You just love it.

15:37.040 --> 15:41.120
You're just going to die for it. Like if I come at Inception with a buoy knife, you're

15:41.120 --> 15:49.080
going to just fucking, like, you're going to me, the creator of community. That doesn't

15:49.080 --> 15:56.360
give you pause. There's no loyalty. There's no Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker. Father, please.

15:56.360 --> 16:02.440
Your emperor is killing me. You won't pick up Inception and dump it into a fucking laser

16:02.440 --> 16:10.600
pit for me in your Ewoks. That's what you are. You'll sing and dance. You don't care

16:10.600 --> 16:18.600
if your moon of indoor is taken over by the empire. I got no use for you. Just don't

16:18.600 --> 16:25.480
cook C-3PO. I haven't seen that movie in a while. I think we're going to cook C-3PO.

16:25.480 --> 16:30.040
In soup? I don't know. He sat up and they're like, oh, he's a god. That movie fucking bite

16:30.040 --> 16:37.400
a dick, too. Fucking Ewoks. You guys are almost too young. It's got to the point. When I came

16:37.400 --> 16:43.640
out to LA, I was like, if I mentioned Star Wars, oh my god. Now you're all, and this

16:43.640 --> 16:49.200
is what I love about you. You're beyond racism. You don't give a shit anymore. You don't

16:49.200 --> 16:54.840
wear watches. You don't have landlines. You don't give a fuck about George Lucas. The

16:54.840 --> 17:02.840
idea that black people can't swim is boring. It's not funny. It's not shocking. You're

17:02.840 --> 17:10.520
like, again, with the black people, fuck you. I'm a quarter Apache. I got a Chinese guy

17:10.520 --> 17:17.840
growing out of the top of my head. I'm half hologram. Even if I'm Thoroughbred Eskimo,

17:17.840 --> 17:21.720
I still don't give a shit about your dumb racial humor. What are you, Don Rickles? Fuck

17:21.720 --> 17:32.240
you. Those are the things that I love about you. But you guys should know, since you're

17:32.240 --> 17:37.320
so young and so beyond it, that Return of the Jedi movie, those Ewoks were supposed

17:37.320 --> 17:40.320
to be Chewbacca's. All right, that's it. That's all I'm going to say about it.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.320
Wait, were they really?

17:41.320 --> 17:44.200
Do you imagine a planet of Chewbacca's? I know they're called Wookies.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.800
I guess I'll research this on my own time. I didn't realize that before.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.000
Yeah. How badass would that have been?

17:49.000 --> 17:52.520
Wait, oh, you mean originally they were little Chewbacca's. I thought you meant that.

17:52.520 --> 17:58.520
They were going to be Wookies. Someone's muttering something. I've incited a nerd rage. It's

17:58.520 --> 18:02.680
valuable. It's valuable. Who's muttering? Who's muttering? It's okay. What are you

18:02.680 --> 18:03.680
saying?

18:03.680 --> 18:04.680
It would have been like the holiday special.

18:04.680 --> 18:09.640
Oh, like what? Do you think the Ewoks would have saved the holiday special? You think

18:09.640 --> 18:10.640
that would have been... No.

18:10.640 --> 18:11.640
I just wanted to get you, man.

18:11.640 --> 18:12.640
All right, all right. I'll buy you a drink afterwards.

18:12.640 --> 18:13.640
He just wants to have sex with you.

18:13.640 --> 18:14.640
Thank you, baby. Thank you.

18:14.640 --> 18:15.640
You're welcome.

18:15.640 --> 18:16.640
All right, so...

18:16.640 --> 18:28.440
We asked you guys to ask us for relationship advice.

18:28.440 --> 18:34.600
Questions, relationship questions. And here's the first one. Here it comes.

18:34.600 --> 18:38.920
All right, here it comes. Along with a sound effect.

18:38.920 --> 18:53.240
There's the relationship of Saurus descending from the Pleistocene of romance to Jesus Christ.

18:53.240 --> 18:59.240
I'm sorry. No, wait. No, it's time for a question.

18:59.240 --> 19:05.720
All right. There's a little bit of overcompensation here. You probably... Erin's insecure about

19:05.720 --> 19:12.520
filling in for Jeff. She brought an iPad sound board. I applaud it. I applaud effort.

19:12.520 --> 19:13.520
Thank you.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.520
That's why I love inception.

19:15.520 --> 19:16.520
Also...

19:16.520 --> 19:24.520
Because it tries too hard. And if you guys don't like this, then you're hypocrites.

19:24.520 --> 19:28.200
I don't want to be the inception of Girlfriend.

19:28.200 --> 19:32.440
No, just the sound board is... It's the...

19:32.440 --> 19:35.040
If I was a movie, what movie would I be? Girlfriend wise?

19:35.040 --> 19:36.040
Citizen Kane.

19:36.040 --> 19:37.040
All right.

19:37.040 --> 19:44.840
Jesus Christ, get out, get out, get out. Pull up. Citizen Motherfuckin' Kane.

19:44.840 --> 19:48.840
So, with your friends and colleagues, you say you love it, but alone you hate it?

19:48.840 --> 19:49.840
No, no, no, no.

19:49.840 --> 19:50.840
I got it.

19:50.840 --> 19:51.840
No.

19:51.840 --> 19:52.840
Thank you, Erin.

19:52.840 --> 19:56.840
Or is it Wells directing it? Some people choose to not understand it, and I say fuck

19:56.840 --> 19:58.840
you to them. Over pie.

19:58.840 --> 20:04.840
All right. Question number one.

20:04.840 --> 20:09.840
It does. It makes no sense.

20:09.840 --> 20:12.840
No, you're calling up the information.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.840
What?

20:14.840 --> 20:22.840
It's the information in 1973? Why am I using a rotary phone?

20:22.840 --> 20:24.840
Question number one.

20:24.840 --> 20:34.840
What is the significance of a man-slash-woman's relationship with their cat?

20:34.840 --> 20:36.840
Oh, that's important.

20:36.840 --> 20:38.840
Because you have a very close relationship with your cat.

20:38.840 --> 20:41.840
Yeah, cats are about... I would kill the music. I don't want to give notes during the show.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.840
I'm sorry. I'll stop doing the sound effects.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.840
Oh, my God.

20:45.840 --> 20:47.840
I thought it was going to be a different sound.

20:47.840 --> 20:51.840
No, it's fine. It's fine. I want to see where it's going. It's fine.

20:51.840 --> 20:56.840
We talked about this. Your job is not to be Jeff Davis, so this is a whole new thing.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.840
She's got an iPad full of sound effects.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.840
Let's just...

21:00.840 --> 21:12.840
Guys, it's fine. He's trying to explain something to me.

21:12.840 --> 21:16.840
We're fine. It's part of the show.

21:16.840 --> 21:22.840
Get off the stage, audience. Stop poking Dan.

21:22.840 --> 21:29.840
I've never had to do this with 200 people at the same time, but guys, she's really cool.

21:29.840 --> 21:36.840
I swear to God.

21:36.840 --> 21:38.840
That was the last one.

21:38.840 --> 21:41.840
Dogs require discipline on behalf of humans.

21:41.840 --> 21:47.840
I don't want to use bad words like arrogance and ego. Confidence would be a better word.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.840
You have to have your shit together to have a dog.

21:50.840 --> 21:56.840
So if the guy or girl that you're interested in, whoever wrote this question, is a dog person

21:56.840 --> 22:01.840
and you're a cat person, then I think what you have to understand is that you might be prone

22:01.840 --> 22:03.840
to act like a little baby in the relationship.

22:03.840 --> 22:07.840
You have to stay on your shit about that.

22:07.840 --> 22:11.840
I think cat people...to own a cat is to say,

22:11.840 --> 22:14.840
I don't want responsibility to the animal kingdom.

22:14.840 --> 22:16.840
It doesn't mean that you're incapable of taking it on.

22:16.840 --> 22:20.840
It's to say, I'm not ready for it yet. I don't want it yet.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.840
People that have dogs are gone like, you know what? I got my shit together.

22:23.840 --> 22:28.840
I want a fucking animal to walk around

22:28.840 --> 22:31.840
and I'm going to be the sunshine and rain in its life.

22:31.840 --> 22:35.840
If I forget to look at it, it's going to have a heart attack.

22:35.840 --> 22:40.840
If I don't tell it a pillow isn't a sandwich, it won't know.

22:40.840 --> 22:44.840
I might have to hit it. All kinds of weird shit.

22:44.840 --> 22:47.840
Hey, don't. Whoa, whoa.

22:47.840 --> 22:53.840
I didn't spend 500,000 years slowly warping the genes of a wolf.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.840
Don't come crying to me.

22:56.840 --> 23:00.840
I like cats. They're brand new.

23:00.840 --> 23:04.840
Egyptians just invented them, like 1,000 years ago.

23:04.840 --> 23:09.840
But I'm happy to make this announcement. Dan is buying a golden doodle.

23:09.840 --> 23:13.840
See, thank you for holding your applause until you got verification from me.

23:13.840 --> 23:18.840
It may take a little while. We researched the kind of dogs that I might get

23:18.840 --> 23:21.840
if I was going to get a dog now that I'm fired.

23:21.840 --> 23:25.840
And the community was my dog.

23:25.840 --> 23:31.840
It has sadly stopped fetching my slippers

23:31.840 --> 23:38.840
and has in fact taken to pissing on my face and my sleep

23:38.840 --> 23:43.840
and having panels at Comic-Con without me.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.840
It's you.

23:45.840 --> 23:49.840
Dan, while that was happening, how did you react to that?

23:49.840 --> 23:53.840
I started cleaning my house. Just for two days, I started moving boxes around.

23:53.840 --> 23:57.840
I was muttering things like, I thought you hated nerds.

23:57.840 --> 24:01.840
And then I would find out I made a shelf wrong and I was kicking across

24:01.840 --> 24:05.840
and I was like, I fucking hate my fucking life.

24:05.840 --> 24:10.840
I'm a wreck. The show broke up with me. It dumped me.

24:10.840 --> 24:13.840
When you dump somebody, don't awe me.

24:13.840 --> 24:16.840
I don't mean don't do anything. You can do whatever you want.

24:16.840 --> 24:20.840
Don't feel sorry for me. I'm not saying these things do illicit pity.

24:20.840 --> 24:23.840
It's a confession. I need to get this off my chest.

24:23.840 --> 24:26.840
I feel warped and bad and petty about it.

24:26.840 --> 24:32.840
Outside, I smile at people and I go, they drive by and go, toot toot, you got fired.

24:32.840 --> 24:36.840
And I go, good morning, Ralph.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.840
I guess they wanted to go in a different direction.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.840
Just taking out the trash.

24:42.840 --> 24:47.840
It's my duty, you know, to keep a smile.

24:47.840 --> 24:50.840
I'm bummed out.

24:50.840 --> 24:52.840
I love my show.

24:52.840 --> 24:56.840
What if they took your baby? What if they came in your window and took your baby?

24:56.840 --> 24:59.840
You'd probably just take your baby.

24:59.840 --> 25:02.840
You'd probably start cleaning your house.

25:02.840 --> 25:04.840
Working on your shelving units.

25:04.840 --> 25:07.840
And every once in a while, you'd find out that for the third time,

25:07.840 --> 25:10.840
you had the Home Depot guy cut it a tenth of an inch too long.

25:10.840 --> 25:13.840
So it still doesn't fit in the fucking thing.

25:13.840 --> 25:15.840
You just erupt into things like,

25:15.840 --> 25:19.840
I'm doing a shelving unit. Why are you fucking firing me then?

25:19.840 --> 25:23.840
In fact, I was trying to move my chair.

25:23.840 --> 25:26.840
So I was trying to move a reclining chair.

25:26.840 --> 25:28.840
Can you just kill the music though?

25:28.840 --> 25:30.840
I'm so sorry. I can't hear it very well.

25:30.840 --> 25:32.840
I mean, I swear to God.

25:32.840 --> 25:36.840
Jeff never does this.

25:36.840 --> 25:38.840
He just, he, you know, he's very...

25:38.840 --> 25:45.840
He also never blows you.

25:45.840 --> 25:46.840
On the weekends.

25:46.840 --> 25:49.840
Do I tell her?

25:49.840 --> 25:52.840
We stepped on each other's...

25:52.840 --> 25:54.840
I had a dream.

25:54.840 --> 25:57.840
The weird thing about the 540 wake-up

25:57.840 --> 25:59.840
in the middle of a very intense anxiety dream.

25:59.840 --> 26:03.840
But in the dream, Aaron and Jeff and I were on mushrooms.

26:03.840 --> 26:06.840
I haven't told Jeff this yet. He's out of town.

26:06.840 --> 26:09.840
And in the dream was such a vivid dream.

26:09.840 --> 26:12.840
And I was in a rage. I'm surprised I wasn't like shouting in my sleep

26:12.840 --> 26:15.840
because in my dream I was constantly angry and so stressed out.

26:15.840 --> 26:20.840
In my dream, Jeff and my girlfriend and myself were on mushrooms

26:20.840 --> 26:22.840
and like hanging out and having a good time.

26:22.840 --> 26:27.840
And at the end of a big fun three-person mushroom trip,

26:27.840 --> 26:28.840
Aaron said,

26:28.840 --> 26:31.840
Guys, you know what? This is going amazing.

26:31.840 --> 26:35.840
Like, let's just do this.

26:35.840 --> 26:38.840
Let's just, call me crazy. Let's just do it.

26:38.840 --> 26:40.840
And I was like, what?

26:40.840 --> 26:42.840
And Jeff was like, yeah, I know what she means.

26:42.840 --> 26:45.840
Let's fucking do it.

26:45.840 --> 26:48.840
We've been thinking about it.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.840
Sounds like you've been thinking about it.

26:50.840 --> 26:55.840
Well, obviously.

26:55.840 --> 26:57.840
It's an anxiety I have.

26:57.840 --> 27:01.840
And I'm in the dream going, I only get to play one character.

27:01.840 --> 27:07.840
I'm going like, no, I don't want to look at my friend's dick

27:07.840 --> 27:10.840
and I don't want to watch him fuck my girlfriend

27:10.840 --> 27:13.840
and I don't want to high five them while I do it.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.840
Was it an eyeful?

27:15.840 --> 27:17.840
I could go on and on for the reasons I don't want to do this,

27:17.840 --> 27:21.840
but I'm sorry guys. And then that's when the dream started.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.840
When the nightmare kicked into high gear

27:23.840 --> 27:25.840
because the rest of the dream, it seemed like hours,

27:25.840 --> 27:28.840
you know, like an inception, like time slows down.

27:28.840 --> 27:31.840
So really, you should rent it.

27:31.840 --> 27:35.840
Give it a chance, guys.

27:35.840 --> 27:38.840
So I was awoken from that by my girlfriend going,

27:38.840 --> 27:42.840
pick up the stick with the microphone.

27:42.840 --> 27:44.840
Everyone's having a great time but me.

27:44.840 --> 27:47.840
I sound like the best.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.840
Really quick, when I saw Inception in the theater,

27:50.840 --> 27:52.840
I saw with a couple friends.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.840
You were 12.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.840
My mom had to take me off of her breast

27:56.840 --> 27:58.840
and she showed me to the...

27:58.840 --> 28:03.840
She held you up and said, one day you'll get this.

28:03.840 --> 28:05.840
I saw Inception at the arc light

28:05.840 --> 28:09.840
and the last shot of Inception, it's not really a spoiler,

28:09.840 --> 28:11.840
is a shot of a top turning

28:11.840 --> 28:13.840
and you don't know if it's going to fall over,

28:13.840 --> 28:15.840
which would mean that he's not in a dream

28:15.840 --> 28:17.840
or if it's going to keep on spinning,

28:17.840 --> 28:18.840
which means he is in a dream

28:18.840 --> 28:20.840
because he finally gets what he wants.

28:20.840 --> 28:22.840
The credits started going up

28:22.840 --> 28:24.840
and a woman behind me said,

28:24.840 --> 28:26.840
here we go again!

28:26.840 --> 28:31.840
A diss with a movie was about a demented top.

28:31.840 --> 28:35.840
Here we go again!

28:35.840 --> 28:38.840
And that woman walked out going, Inception's great.

28:38.840 --> 28:41.840
You know, fuck you guys.

28:41.840 --> 28:45.840
Among dummies, Erin McGathy text messages

28:45.840 --> 28:48.840
scrolling back to the night...

28:48.840 --> 28:50.840
Uh-oh.

28:52.840 --> 28:54.840
I was trying to move a chair through a doorway

28:54.840 --> 28:56.840
that was too narrow for the chair.

28:58.840 --> 29:02.840
Welcome to the most entertaining story of your life.

29:02.840 --> 29:05.840
Also, there were buttons nearby.

29:05.840 --> 29:11.840
The walls were creamed.

29:11.840 --> 29:13.840
Garrison Keeler in it.

29:16.840 --> 29:18.840
How many more people are going to be in his town?

29:18.840 --> 29:21.840
Arthur's chair has become an item of much recompense.

29:24.840 --> 29:28.840
The cushioning was forgiving.

29:28.840 --> 29:31.840
Sean Connery's Garrison Keeler Impressionist.

29:31.840 --> 29:33.840
It is right on.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.840
It is right on.

29:35.840 --> 29:39.840
Most things in Lake Wobegon don't rack all the bullets.

29:42.840 --> 29:44.840
I'd really like to not get sidetracked tonight.

29:44.840 --> 29:45.840
Okay, I'm sorry.

29:45.840 --> 29:46.840
Okay, so chair.

29:46.840 --> 29:48.840
You're trying to move...

29:48.840 --> 29:50.840
Everyone buckle in.

29:50.840 --> 29:52.840
He was trying to move a chair.

29:52.840 --> 29:53.840
It's a character study.

29:53.840 --> 29:54.840
It's funny.

29:54.840 --> 29:56.840
I was trying to move a chair through a door.

29:56.840 --> 29:59.840
The chair, I really think I came out of the gate

29:59.840 --> 30:03.840
swinging an inception, and I think that's the moral of tonight.

30:03.840 --> 30:05.840
I really fucked myself.

30:05.840 --> 30:06.840
No, you're doing fine.

30:06.840 --> 30:08.840
I wish I could take it back, man.

30:08.840 --> 30:10.840
I wish I could like that movie.

30:10.840 --> 30:12.840
I wish someone could incept into my head.

30:14.840 --> 30:17.840
The idea that that movie is like Robocop.

30:17.840 --> 30:23.840
Because it looks like a lot of skiing to me.

30:23.840 --> 30:28.840
Yeah, those dreamscapes weren't very cool.

30:28.840 --> 30:30.840
Did you say dreamscape?

30:30.840 --> 30:32.840
The original inception.

30:32.840 --> 30:33.840
Thank you, sir.

30:33.840 --> 30:34.840
Thank you.

30:34.840 --> 30:36.840
They all came together.

30:36.840 --> 30:38.840
The dreamscape club all came together.

30:38.840 --> 30:40.840
All of my colleagues in the back.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.840
Yeah, that's what it's like to have a 27-year-old girlfriend,

30:42.840 --> 30:43.840
by the way.

30:43.840 --> 30:44.840
I'm 39.

30:44.840 --> 30:46.840
I'm like, let me show you the real inception.

30:46.840 --> 30:48.840
Dennis Quaid in dreamscape.

30:48.840 --> 30:50.840
And then he just shows me his dick.

30:50.840 --> 30:52.840
I do that all the time.

30:52.840 --> 30:54.840
Ladies.

30:58.840 --> 31:00.840
But his dick is a dream within a dream.

31:00.840 --> 31:01.840
It's crazy.

31:01.840 --> 31:02.840
It's crazy.

31:02.840 --> 31:04.840
I look at it, and I see myself naked in science class,

31:04.840 --> 31:06.840
and then I see myself skiing.

31:08.840 --> 31:10.840
With dicks for poles.

31:12.840 --> 31:14.840
With it would be really low to the ground,

31:14.840 --> 31:15.840
like crouching.

31:15.840 --> 31:18.840
But then the dick looks up and goes, I'm the architect.

31:18.840 --> 31:20.840
It's my dream.

31:20.840 --> 31:23.840
That's why the balls have different hair on them.

31:23.840 --> 31:26.840
And then Alan Page says, I have no reason to be here.

31:26.840 --> 31:28.840
There's no reason for me to be here.

31:28.840 --> 31:29.840
I was in Juneau.

31:29.840 --> 31:30.840
That's it.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.840
And then Joseph Gordon-Levitt says,

31:32.840 --> 31:34.840
I thought it was in a better movie than this.

31:34.840 --> 31:35.840
I did pretty good in this movie.

31:35.840 --> 31:37.840
I'm going to abuse this over-validation.

31:37.840 --> 31:40.840
And then Leonardo DiCaprio said, I love yachts.

31:42.840 --> 31:44.840
Because of Titanic?

31:44.840 --> 31:46.840
No, no, no, no.

31:46.840 --> 31:49.840
I mean, we can all agree that Leonardo DiCaprio is a bad person.

31:49.840 --> 31:51.840
I mean, there's probably somebody here.

31:51.840 --> 31:52.840
I mean, come on.

31:52.840 --> 31:54.840
He's got to be a shitty, terrible person.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.840
He's an okay actor.

31:56.840 --> 31:57.840
You can see it on his face.

31:57.840 --> 31:59.840
He's a bad person.

31:59.840 --> 32:01.840
When he's at charity events, deep down inside,

32:01.840 --> 32:04.840
he's like, I don't really care if people die of cancer.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.840
I don't have a yacht.

32:06.840 --> 32:08.840
He loves yachts.

32:09.840 --> 32:10.840
And models.

32:10.840 --> 32:12.840
You can't trust people who love yachts.

32:12.840 --> 32:14.840
Yachts shouldn't be around.

32:14.840 --> 32:16.840
Are you basing?

32:17.840 --> 32:19.840
Was he ever on a yacht to your knowledge?

32:19.840 --> 32:21.840
Yes, he was on four yachts.

32:22.840 --> 32:23.840
At the same time?

32:26.840 --> 32:28.840
Every time I've seen a picture of him in a magazine,

32:28.840 --> 32:31.840
he's with a different starlet on a yacht.

32:31.840 --> 32:32.840
Really?

32:32.840 --> 32:34.840
Like, lively on a yacht.

32:34.840 --> 32:37.840
Gazelle Bunchen.

32:38.840 --> 32:40.840
You know why I think he's on a yacht, baby?

32:40.840 --> 32:42.840
He probably just wants to fuck you.

32:42.840 --> 32:43.840
Yeah.

32:43.840 --> 32:44.840
I'm a good boy.

32:44.840 --> 32:45.840
Probably.

32:45.840 --> 32:48.840
There's someone who's not laughing at everything I see in the back.

32:48.840 --> 32:50.840
Hey, man, how can it happen?

32:52.840 --> 32:53.840
I do that too.

32:53.840 --> 32:54.840
I'm sorry, babe.

32:54.840 --> 32:55.840
I do the same thing.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.840
A lot of the fights we have are because we're the same person.

32:57.840 --> 32:59.840
You're as dishonest and narcissistic as me.

32:59.840 --> 33:03.840
And I also play to whoever's not laughing.

33:03.840 --> 33:04.840
There's always a guy.

33:04.840 --> 33:05.840
There's always a guy.

33:05.840 --> 33:07.840
There's a couple people who are like...

33:08.840 --> 33:12.840
I thought you were going to make up a new sitcom.

33:12.840 --> 33:13.840
For me.

33:13.840 --> 33:15.840
I don't know what...

33:15.840 --> 33:17.840
And I don't blame you.

33:17.840 --> 33:19.840
It's $10 and I'll see you after the show.

33:19.840 --> 33:22.840
How about the male and female version of the same person

33:22.840 --> 33:23.840
trying to do a show together?

33:23.840 --> 33:25.840
One is dressed like his best friend

33:25.840 --> 33:27.840
and he just explained that he wanted to have a three-way

33:27.840 --> 33:28.840
with his best friend.

33:29.840 --> 33:30.840
How about that?

33:30.840 --> 33:31.840
All right.

33:32.840 --> 33:34.840
So I was trying to move a chair through a door.

33:34.840 --> 33:42.840
And I took off my shirt because I was sweating.

33:42.840 --> 33:44.840
And I'm shedding a few,

33:44.840 --> 33:46.840
but I still look ridiculous with my shirt off.

33:46.840 --> 33:47.840
So she came upstairs

33:47.840 --> 33:49.840
and she saw me standing over this chair

33:49.840 --> 33:50.840
that I couldn't get through a doorway.

33:50.840 --> 33:52.840
I looked like just a bad...

33:52.840 --> 33:54.840
I was playing this game of Tetris with one piece,

33:54.840 --> 33:57.840
trying to flip it.

33:57.840 --> 34:00.840
I just drenched in sweat and I've taken off my shirt

34:00.840 --> 34:04.840
and I look like a community theater version of Stanley Kowalski.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.840
I had tried to move the chair through the door

34:08.840 --> 34:09.840
every conceivable way.

34:09.840 --> 34:11.840
It's kind of shaped like a whistle, this thing.

34:11.840 --> 34:13.840
I can picture like a whistle.

34:13.840 --> 34:14.840
Do they have whistles now?

34:14.840 --> 34:16.840
Are those made to obsolete by Wi-Fi?

34:16.840 --> 34:17.840
Is there like a...

34:17.840 --> 34:19.840
Do they still wear on the football field?

34:19.840 --> 34:20.840
They're like, no, use a laser now.

34:20.840 --> 34:22.840
You shine it in their eyes.

34:22.840 --> 34:23.840
I don't know.

34:23.840 --> 34:24.840
I don't follow sports.

34:24.840 --> 34:25.840
Maybe the whistle...

34:25.840 --> 34:26.840
You don't have the whistle, do you?

34:26.840 --> 34:27.840
There's a whistle.

34:27.840 --> 34:30.840
I was trying to figure out...

34:30.840 --> 34:32.840
I put the back through the very narrow doorway.

34:32.840 --> 34:33.840
It occurred to me.

34:33.840 --> 34:37.840
I figured out one angle and I shared this with Erin

34:37.840 --> 34:39.840
because I trust her and love her.

34:39.840 --> 34:40.840
Thank you.

34:40.840 --> 34:41.840
That's the end of the story.

34:43.840 --> 34:44.840
Next question.

34:44.840 --> 34:46.840
Why are you so pretty, Erin?

34:46.840 --> 34:47.840
Weird.

34:48.840 --> 34:49.840
I don't know.

34:50.840 --> 34:52.840
This is my spirit, my good spirit.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.840
Sorry.

34:57.840 --> 35:00.840
She actually does work as a replacement for Jeff Davis.

35:01.840 --> 35:04.840
Do you have any stories about the time you ordered milk

35:04.840 --> 35:06.840
and the chef said thank you?

35:06.840 --> 35:07.840
Thank you.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.840
No one ever orders milk like that.

35:09.840 --> 35:10.840
No one ever orders milk like that.

35:10.840 --> 35:12.840
How did you learn to order milk?

35:13.840 --> 35:14.840
I don't know.

35:14.840 --> 35:16.840
Were you born milk special?

35:16.840 --> 35:17.840
Thank you.

35:17.840 --> 35:18.840
I guess I was.

35:18.840 --> 35:19.840
I don't know.

35:19.840 --> 35:20.840
I don't fucking care.

35:20.840 --> 35:24.840
I said I'm going to have to take the door off the hinges

35:24.840 --> 35:26.840
in order to get the chair through.

35:26.840 --> 35:27.840
It almost makes it through.

35:27.840 --> 35:28.840
I got to take the door off the hinges.

35:28.840 --> 35:30.840
Erin's immediate response.

35:31.840 --> 35:32.840
Don't do that.

35:32.840 --> 35:33.840
It's a two-man job.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.840
Have you ever taken a door off the hinges before

35:36.840 --> 35:38.840
and tried to put it back on?

35:38.840 --> 35:39.840
It's a two-man job.

35:39.840 --> 35:41.840
It's harder than you think.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.840
It screws in some wood.

35:43.840 --> 35:44.840
It's a fucking door.

35:44.840 --> 35:45.840
It's a door.

35:45.840 --> 35:47.840
No, I've never, to be perfectly honest with you,

35:47.840 --> 35:50.840
I've never taken a door off the hinges and put it back on.

35:50.840 --> 35:52.840
Well, it's harder than you think.

35:53.840 --> 35:54.840
You've taken a door off the hinges.

35:54.840 --> 35:56.840
Well, Erin, I didn't actually ask for your help.

35:56.840 --> 35:59.840
And even if I did, I don't think telling someone

35:59.840 --> 36:01.840
not to do something is helping them.

36:01.840 --> 36:05.840
I find that to be very discouraging, actually.

36:05.840 --> 36:07.840
And you definitely said it as sweet and reasonable

36:07.840 --> 36:09.840
as you're saying it now.

36:10.840 --> 36:13.840
So she goes, well, I'm going to go out drinking again.

36:13.840 --> 36:14.840
Again?

36:19.840 --> 36:20.840
I said, I'm going to go out fucking.

36:20.840 --> 36:21.840
I'm going to go out fucking I guess.

36:21.840 --> 36:22.840
Oh, no laugh.

36:22.840 --> 36:23.840
I'm so sorry.

36:23.840 --> 36:24.840
I didn't say that.

36:24.840 --> 36:25.840
I was going out of the karaoke.

36:25.840 --> 36:26.840
I'm so sorry.

36:26.840 --> 36:27.840
Don't pollute the story with bits

36:27.840 --> 36:28.840
because the truth is funnier than everything.

36:28.840 --> 36:29.840
You're right.

36:29.840 --> 36:30.840
You're right.

36:30.840 --> 36:31.840
You're right.

36:31.840 --> 36:32.840
You're right.

36:32.840 --> 36:33.840
You're right.

36:33.840 --> 36:34.840
I want to go out and drink in the drawing room.

36:34.840 --> 36:35.840
You left.

36:35.840 --> 36:37.840
And I was like, oh, fuck, it's a door.

36:37.840 --> 36:38.840
So she's right.

36:38.840 --> 36:40.840
It's kind of hard to take off a door by yourself

36:40.840 --> 36:43.840
unless you put a fucking thing under the door.

36:43.840 --> 36:46.920
It's like cartoon logic.

36:46.920 --> 36:47.920
It's like, why is it hard?

36:47.920 --> 36:50.880
Oh, because the door, if you take a screw, the unscrew,

36:50.880 --> 36:52.880
it'll start to fall off the hinges.

36:52.880 --> 36:55.120
Oh no, what am I gonna do?

36:55.120 --> 36:57.160
What am I, what am I a fucking fox?

36:57.160 --> 36:58.000
Am I a beaver?

36:58.000 --> 36:59.400
No, I'm a primate.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.480
I think I'll go get a thing that's as high

37:01.480 --> 37:03.000
as the door comes off the ground.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.240
Put it under the door so that when it comes off the hinges,

37:05.240 --> 37:06.760
it's resting on that.

37:06.760 --> 37:08.440
Ta-da!

37:08.440 --> 37:10.160
And I took it off its fucking hinges

37:10.160 --> 37:12.080
and I put the chair through the door

37:12.080 --> 37:14.840
and I put the door back on the hinges

37:14.840 --> 37:19.080
and I sent my drinking girlfriend two photos,

37:19.080 --> 37:22.000
one of the chair in the room that it was too small,

37:22.000 --> 37:23.200
so too big to get into,

37:23.200 --> 37:25.760
and the other of the newly intact door,

37:25.760 --> 37:29.600
rehinged and ready for closing or opening.

37:31.120 --> 37:35.960
And I said, now, so you'll be me and I'll be you.

37:35.960 --> 37:37.640
All right, so you be me, I'll be you.

37:37.640 --> 37:40.960
Now, it was probably a two-man job,

37:40.960 --> 37:43.360
but you probably forgot I have the power of 10 men.

37:43.360 --> 37:45.360
And no idea that Tim Allen had cloned himself

37:45.360 --> 37:48.360
and there were 50, 10 Allens in there.

37:55.960 --> 37:57.560
Wow, you won.

37:57.560 --> 37:58.400
All right, let's just read in

37:58.400 --> 37:59.240
and then we'll talk about it.

37:59.240 --> 38:00.080
Erin.

38:00.080 --> 38:02.520
She's good, she's good.

38:02.520 --> 38:04.000
It probably was a two-man job,

38:04.000 --> 38:07.960
but you probably forgot I have the power of 10 men.

38:07.960 --> 38:12.960
That's awesome.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.600
I'm legitimately impressed.

38:17.600 --> 38:18.720
I don't want you to be impressed.

38:18.720 --> 38:19.920
I want you to be supportive of me

38:19.920 --> 38:21.600
and in the face of adversity.

38:27.040 --> 38:29.400
Or, or I guess you could fire me

38:29.400 --> 38:34.400
and tell everyone that I did it unofficially.

38:36.520 --> 38:39.720
Jesus, I'm sorry.

38:39.720 --> 38:41.840
Pay attention to the punctuation.

38:41.840 --> 38:42.920
Jesus, period.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.440
Okay, okay.

38:44.440 --> 38:45.960
I'm sorry, period.

38:47.440 --> 38:49.120
I love you, period.

38:49.120 --> 38:49.960
All right.

38:49.960 --> 38:52.000
You really did it, period.

38:53.720 --> 38:54.560
Pause.

38:55.560 --> 38:58.200
Sorry, I was trying to save you heartache.

38:58.200 --> 39:00.440
Lesson learned, no punctuation.

39:05.320 --> 39:06.680
So no response for a while.

39:06.680 --> 39:07.760
20 minutes later.

39:09.200 --> 39:10.400
Are you mad at me?

39:11.280 --> 39:12.120
No.

39:13.400 --> 39:14.320
Okay.

39:15.680 --> 39:16.920
It's not that crowded here

39:16.920 --> 39:18.960
if you want to drink exclamation points.

39:19.920 --> 39:21.320
Just me and Kimber.

39:22.880 --> 39:24.320
No thanks.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.800
Very tired.

39:25.800 --> 39:29.840
Okay, period.

39:29.840 --> 39:32.000
You sure you're not upset?

39:32.000 --> 39:32.920
Question mark?

39:32.920 --> 39:34.920
I don't have enough energy to be upset,

39:34.920 --> 39:36.560
but I can't take away the same shame

39:36.560 --> 39:38.800
you feel for not believing in my door powers.

39:43.160 --> 39:46.320
That is, that is shame you are putting on yourself.

39:53.480 --> 39:54.840
Dash, dash.

39:54.840 --> 39:56.680
Okay.

39:56.680 --> 39:57.520
True.

39:58.760 --> 40:02.000
Is it okay if Kimber stays in your guest room?

40:02.000 --> 40:03.520
That's fine.

40:03.520 --> 40:04.360
Thank you.

40:07.480 --> 40:08.480
Oh, this is this morning.

40:08.480 --> 40:09.480
Yeah, this is morning.

40:09.480 --> 40:10.600
Unimportant.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.520
He left, I woke up to an empty bed,

40:12.520 --> 40:13.800
so I texted him.

40:15.640 --> 40:18.680
You can play Minecraft in here, smile face.

40:18.680 --> 40:23.600
Oh, does nobody need to hold up the stick anymore?

40:23.600 --> 40:25.200
Because if that's why I was downstairs,

40:25.200 --> 40:26.920
I'm fucking 540 in the morning,

40:26.920 --> 40:27.760
hold up the stick.

40:27.760 --> 40:30.720
Oh, fucking three-way, 11 dream bitch.

40:33.280 --> 40:34.960
I'm gonna go play a video game

40:34.960 --> 40:38.960
where my efforts are rewarded in a linear fashion.

40:38.960 --> 40:42.080
That's the name of my 70s metal band,

40:42.080 --> 40:43.800
three-way, 11 dream bitch.

40:43.800 --> 40:47.120
That's the name of my 70s metal band, three-way, 11 dream bitch.

40:50.120 --> 40:54.000
She's a three-way, 11 dream bitch.

40:55.280 --> 40:56.520
She likes.

40:58.840 --> 41:01.560
Abercrombie and fish, I got her.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.000
Speaking of which, I'm wearing this sweater

41:03.000 --> 41:04.800
to honor the fact that the air conditioning

41:04.800 --> 41:05.720
is working in this room.

41:05.720 --> 41:06.880
I'm sure you guys are.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.520
They used to get sweltering hot in here.

41:10.520 --> 41:14.360
The fact that I can wear a sweater up here is amazing,

41:14.360 --> 41:16.120
and we owe that to, I believe we owe that to,

41:16.120 --> 41:18.440
well, we owe that to everybody at Meltdown Comics.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.440
They don't have to, this place is always packed.

41:21.440 --> 41:23.520
They can tell you to go fuck yourselves as a customer.

41:23.520 --> 41:26.320
They have your money, they have your devotion,

41:26.320 --> 41:28.520
but they choose to adjust the climate

41:28.520 --> 41:31.120
at the expense of thousands of dollars to them.

41:31.120 --> 41:34.280
They want you to be happy as well as lucrative.

41:35.280 --> 41:38.840
And the good people at True Value, yes.

41:38.840 --> 41:42.840
True Value, did someone say True Value?

41:44.760 --> 41:47.680
We make hardware stores, not slogans.

41:48.720 --> 41:49.840
True Value.

41:52.360 --> 41:53.200
All right.

41:53.200 --> 41:54.680
And butter.

41:54.680 --> 41:55.520
I have some more.

41:55.520 --> 41:57.080
Sticker than milk.

41:57.080 --> 41:58.400
And twice as yellow.

42:02.280 --> 42:05.480
Better than pee since 1940, butter.

42:05.480 --> 42:11.080
Just do the, break it up, because there's people

42:11.080 --> 42:13.960
in the back who, the charisma zone is here.

42:13.960 --> 42:16.840
Like these people get splashed, it's like a SeaWorld show.

42:16.840 --> 42:19.520
They feel the brine and the shrimp on their faces.

42:19.520 --> 42:21.080
They're like, I fucking love whales.

42:21.080 --> 42:23.920
Like, can I get a whale hat on my way out?

42:23.920 --> 42:24.960
I love whales.

42:24.960 --> 42:26.240
It's not in the halfway of the drive home.

42:26.240 --> 42:28.080
They're like, what the fuck was that?

42:28.080 --> 42:29.680
What's a whale's pie?

42:29.680 --> 42:31.120
The people, as you go further back,

42:31.120 --> 42:31.960
there's people in the back who are like,

42:31.960 --> 42:33.840
what the fuck's going on?

42:33.840 --> 42:35.600
That guy's just talking to his girlfriend

42:35.600 --> 42:37.960
about fucking, whether his ass is fat

42:37.960 --> 42:40.320
and fuck these people.

42:40.320 --> 42:41.160
I didn't say that.

42:41.160 --> 42:42.080
I'd fire him too.

42:43.760 --> 42:45.640
You don't have to keep, I guess I do that

42:45.640 --> 42:47.000
to get that reaction out.

42:47.000 --> 42:51.000
I also probably did some stuff to get fired.

42:53.440 --> 42:54.800
I'm sure I did.

42:54.800 --> 42:56.640
Like I never, ever, ever did anything

42:56.640 --> 42:58.360
they wanted me to do.

42:58.360 --> 43:00.080
Like they always were going, they were like,

43:00.080 --> 43:02.520
hey, you should have Martin Short on the show.

43:02.520 --> 43:04.960
They didn't get to be like the three amigos

43:04.960 --> 43:06.080
with Chevy Chays.

43:07.240 --> 43:08.080
Okay.

43:09.320 --> 43:10.440
I'm on it.

43:11.360 --> 43:12.200
Sh.

43:13.480 --> 43:15.560
So how's the video game episode coming?

43:16.640 --> 43:17.720
They didn't like me.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.440
I didn't listen to them.

43:19.440 --> 43:20.800
I'm not a hero for doing that.

43:20.800 --> 43:22.440
That's childish.

43:22.440 --> 43:23.920
If you ever have a television show,

43:23.920 --> 43:25.440
you should clean your plate.

43:25.440 --> 43:26.440
Do your show.

43:26.440 --> 43:28.800
Do it the way that they want you to do it.

43:28.800 --> 43:32.880
Otherwise, you won't get to make a television show tomorrow.

43:34.560 --> 43:35.840
You just be hanging out.

43:38.720 --> 43:40.880
If you like television so much,

43:42.160 --> 43:43.280
do it right.

43:46.160 --> 43:47.000
All right.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.880
But my relationship is perfect.

43:49.880 --> 43:51.480
I'm not here to give TV show advice.

43:51.480 --> 43:52.960
Are you raising your hand, sir?

43:52.960 --> 43:54.360
Listen, well, this is important.

43:54.360 --> 43:57.280
Well, it's just what you just reminded me.

43:57.280 --> 43:58.240
I had heard of one point,

43:58.240 --> 44:00.320
the video game episode was the...

44:00.320 --> 44:01.160
Yeah.

44:01.160 --> 44:02.800
Was that ever the case?

44:02.800 --> 44:03.640
Wait, what?

44:03.640 --> 44:04.640
The video game episode was what?

44:04.640 --> 44:08.240
The video game ever, the finale of last season?

44:08.240 --> 44:09.600
No, no, no, no, no, no.

44:09.600 --> 44:12.520
It has, he asked, was the video game episode

44:12.520 --> 44:13.480
ever the finale?

44:13.480 --> 44:17.080
People, the big fans are like the production codes

44:17.080 --> 44:19.480
of the episodes, like the numbers 320,

44:19.480 --> 44:20.680
321, 322.

44:20.680 --> 44:23.200
Sometimes we shuffle episodes and those are a tip off.

44:23.200 --> 44:26.360
We do do that, like because we do,

44:26.360 --> 44:28.600
we do make, and it is a disservice

44:28.600 --> 44:29.840
to the continuity of the show.

44:29.840 --> 44:32.920
Sometimes we're like, well, 313 is a happier episode.

44:32.920 --> 44:34.480
We're coming back from a break or whatever.

44:34.480 --> 44:36.240
We're like shuffle it a little bit.

44:36.240 --> 44:37.920
And I always tell people when we do that.

44:37.920 --> 44:40.600
And then on the DVD, well, I have no control right now,

44:40.600 --> 44:43.240
but they're supposed to correct that on the DVD.

44:43.240 --> 44:44.760
In the cases of things like that,

44:44.760 --> 44:46.120
the production codes of the episodes,

44:46.120 --> 44:48.400
like with the Christmas episode that was stopped animated

44:48.400 --> 44:49.880
and that video game episode,

44:49.880 --> 44:53.800
we tend to just give it the latest production code number

44:53.800 --> 44:57.320
because why, I'm not necessarily sure

44:57.320 --> 44:58.880
it has something to do with just giving it,

44:58.880 --> 44:59.800
like, because it's like,

44:59.800 --> 45:01.800
that's a post-productive intensive episode.

45:01.800 --> 45:02.840
We're gonna get to that.

45:02.840 --> 45:04.960
That'll be the last one that we finish producing.

45:04.960 --> 45:07.560
Let's just call it 322, for instance.

45:07.560 --> 45:09.800
And then the other one, so it was never,

45:09.800 --> 45:13.480
there was never, I would never do a finale

45:13.480 --> 45:15.360
like with just them playing video games.

45:15.360 --> 45:17.280
I would do it with a guy going in a cardboard box

45:17.280 --> 45:19.160
and just turning it into a flash of light.

45:19.160 --> 45:21.840
Because I'm a genius.

45:23.520 --> 45:28.440
Anyway, so, very odd of you to just blurt out that question,

45:28.440 --> 45:32.400
but no, there's no problem with it, that's fine.

45:32.400 --> 45:34.560
It didn't turn into a rape or anything.

45:34.560 --> 45:39.240
It's alarming to people when someone does that

45:39.240 --> 45:40.520
because it's possible then

45:40.520 --> 45:42.400
that you could just start raping people

45:42.400 --> 45:44.760
and no one would be able to do anything about it.

45:44.760 --> 45:48.640
So the whole feeling of social order kind of collapses.

45:48.640 --> 45:51.080
There's 200 people, if you all just charged me,

45:51.080 --> 45:53.000
you could kill me.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.160
If you all just started talking or eating peanuts,

45:55.160 --> 45:56.880
even if you all ate peanuts in unison,

45:56.880 --> 45:59.720
that would be a form of, absolutely, it would overpower me

45:59.720 --> 46:01.840
and I would, you wouldn't be able to hear me.

46:01.840 --> 46:02.680
Also understand it.

46:02.680 --> 46:03.520
You have all the power.

46:03.520 --> 46:06.560
So, with apartheid, I need you to not know that.

46:07.680 --> 46:09.760
I need to delay that realization

46:09.760 --> 46:11.560
that you guys are in charge.

46:12.480 --> 46:13.880
What were we talking about?

46:16.080 --> 46:17.360
We're going on to our next question.

46:17.360 --> 46:18.720
Oh, right, right, right, yeah, next question.

46:18.720 --> 46:21.280
Dan, do you believe in love at first night?

46:21.280 --> 46:22.720
At first night, I'm sorry.

46:22.720 --> 46:23.560
Oh.

46:23.560 --> 46:24.400
Oh.

46:29.400 --> 46:32.480
Freudian slip at first sight.

46:34.080 --> 46:34.960
Discuss.

46:34.960 --> 46:36.600
I'm gonna say, well, I'm gonna say no

46:36.600 --> 46:39.120
because the definition of love is,

46:39.120 --> 46:44.120
I believe that people who end up happy together forever,

46:44.400 --> 46:46.480
you can trickle back and find out

46:46.480 --> 46:48.240
that they, when they saw each other,

46:48.240 --> 46:50.840
they were into each other at an intense level,

46:50.840 --> 46:52.720
unshared by any previous relationship.

46:52.720 --> 46:55.120
But that might be coincidence,

46:55.120 --> 46:58.280
because I think that love is, true love is,

46:58.280 --> 47:01.960
you, number one, you die for the other person.

47:01.960 --> 47:04.800
That's a hard one to, that's a tough order to fill.

47:06.200 --> 47:07.040
For real?

47:07.040 --> 47:08.840
Well, there might even be like degrees of love.

47:08.840 --> 47:10.880
Love in Roman numeral three.

47:12.440 --> 47:16.440
But, but, but also like.

47:16.440 --> 47:18.800
You have to be, well, when you love somebody,

47:18.800 --> 47:22.480
you have to be willing to endure their bullshit.

47:22.480 --> 47:25.800
Like that high fidelity monologue about,

47:25.800 --> 47:28.120
you know, you're not allowed to compare

47:28.120 --> 47:30.000
the women that you see on the street

47:30.000 --> 47:31.720
to the ratty panties that are hanging over

47:31.720 --> 47:33.040
your shower curtain.

47:33.040 --> 47:36.680
I'm paraphrasing a better writer than me,

47:36.680 --> 47:39.680
but, but, but you, that monologue is.

47:39.680 --> 47:41.000
I'm making a curtain.

47:41.000 --> 47:44.360
It's, the person that you're with every day,

47:44.360 --> 47:46.240
as you say, when you eventually marry them,

47:46.240 --> 47:47.720
it's the, for better or for worse thing.

47:47.720 --> 47:50.200
You're taking a vow, not because you want to like,

47:50.200 --> 47:52.080
what it turns into in Western societies,

47:52.080 --> 47:53.440
we just like hold hands and go like, all right,

47:53.440 --> 47:56.320
no, promise for real, except unless we get a divorce.

47:56.320 --> 48:00.000
Okay, go, it's really supposed to be like,

48:00.000 --> 48:03.800
no, because you're going to be shitty sometimes.

48:03.800 --> 48:06.240
Like I'm, I'm not going to, you know,

48:06.240 --> 48:08.560
I'm going to average things out now.

48:08.560 --> 48:10.200
I'm not going to base it on whether or not

48:10.200 --> 48:12.040
every date goes perfectly.

48:12.040 --> 48:13.520
We're not even going to date anymore.

48:13.520 --> 48:14.880
We're going to have breakfast together.

48:14.880 --> 48:16.160
And it's like, you're going to be in a bad mood.

48:16.160 --> 48:18.000
I'm going to be in a bad mood and, you know,

48:18.000 --> 48:20.600
I'm going to want to hit you with an iron.

48:20.600 --> 48:21.440
Jesus.

48:23.120 --> 48:24.040
We'll talk later.

48:24.040 --> 48:27.400
I wish you an iron more.

48:27.400 --> 48:29.400
I hate that I have to do all the ironing

48:30.680 --> 48:32.120
and that you stand there and watch me

48:32.120 --> 48:34.120
with your head in a head holder.

48:34.120 --> 48:35.040
And I just.

48:35.040 --> 48:36.240
I love my head holder.

48:37.640 --> 48:39.640
It's perfect for nothing.

48:39.640 --> 48:40.480
It's perfect for nothing.

48:40.480 --> 48:41.320
It doesn't exist.

48:41.320 --> 48:42.720
Can you draw out the reading of the next question

48:42.720 --> 48:44.080
so I can get a drink?

48:44.080 --> 48:46.320
Yeah, I'm holding, I'm covered in questions.

48:48.600 --> 48:49.560
Here we go.

48:49.560 --> 48:50.400
Let's see.

48:50.400 --> 48:52.760
Begatti, can you make this work?

48:52.760 --> 48:53.880
Here it goes.

48:53.880 --> 48:54.720
It's coming out.

48:54.720 --> 48:56.200
And there it is.

48:56.200 --> 48:57.040
All right.

49:03.200 --> 49:06.320
Not such a bad girl friend.

49:09.320 --> 49:10.960
Ooh.

49:10.960 --> 49:15.960
She has her moments, like the lamb allergy lie,

49:17.360 --> 49:19.760
which we'll get to in just a moment.

49:19.760 --> 49:22.080
I don't think it's going to be very fun.

49:22.080 --> 49:22.920
I will.

49:22.920 --> 49:24.720
Now I feel like it has to be,

49:24.720 --> 49:26.880
I don't think it's going to be a long story.

49:26.880 --> 49:27.720
No.

49:29.240 --> 49:32.120
Once upon a time, Erin pretended to have a lamb allergy

49:33.080 --> 49:34.400
just to get her way.

49:34.400 --> 49:35.240
The end.

49:37.680 --> 49:40.600
They lived happily ever after.

49:40.600 --> 49:41.440
Question mic?

49:45.040 --> 49:46.720
Next question.

49:46.720 --> 49:48.080
What's the question?

49:48.080 --> 49:50.800
I'm going to react to you saying a question mark.

49:50.800 --> 49:52.360
We have a very happy relationship,

49:52.360 --> 49:53.680
you fucking asshole.

49:53.680 --> 49:58.680
I'm just trying to make the nice people happy.

49:59.120 --> 50:00.480
I just want them to.

50:00.480 --> 50:01.520
Go back to your ex-girlfriends.

50:01.520 --> 50:02.880
You guys had a lot of fun.

50:02.880 --> 50:07.640
It's fine, I'm sure no one will have me.

50:10.640 --> 50:13.080
It's like dating myself.

50:13.080 --> 50:14.600
It's the fucking worst.

50:16.120 --> 50:18.160
And the best.

50:18.160 --> 50:19.240
So arrogant.

50:19.240 --> 50:20.720
I'm not going to defend our relationship.

50:20.720 --> 50:21.720
It's passionate.

50:21.720 --> 50:22.560
Again?

50:23.760 --> 50:25.800
There are crimes of passion where someone cuts someone's

50:25.800 --> 50:27.760
head off with a chainsaw.

50:27.760 --> 50:29.440
That's a crime of passion.

50:29.440 --> 50:31.080
I'm passionately in love with you.

50:31.080 --> 50:35.200
I may decapitate you at some point.

50:35.200 --> 50:36.440
I mean, Dan, you're my,

50:36.440 --> 50:38.040
I want to say in front of everybody,

50:38.040 --> 50:39.600
Dan, you're my best friend.

50:39.600 --> 50:40.440
Oh.

50:41.880 --> 50:43.120
I love Tron.

50:47.960 --> 50:51.280
And I love attention from strangers, gentlemen.

50:52.920 --> 50:55.040
Don't do that, don't put your shingle out

50:55.040 --> 50:56.160
because it harm my town.

50:56.160 --> 51:00.160
This is apropos of this line of conversation.

51:00.160 --> 51:02.000
I've been with my boyfriend for eight years.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.200
I love him, but we fight all the time.

51:04.200 --> 51:05.360
What should I do?

51:06.240 --> 51:07.400
Wait, is that for real?

51:07.400 --> 51:08.240
Oh, okay.

51:09.560 --> 51:10.400
Marry him.

51:10.400 --> 51:12.240
Ha ha ha.

51:12.240 --> 51:14.080
You've been with him for eight years.

51:14.080 --> 51:15.640
If you're asking that question,

51:15.640 --> 51:18.520
you're looking for someone to like fire a gun

51:18.520 --> 51:20.640
at the starting line that's you getting out

51:20.640 --> 51:21.480
of our relationship.

51:21.480 --> 51:22.880
You don't ask that question if you-

51:22.880 --> 51:25.600
Not necessarily because if you fight all the time,

51:25.600 --> 51:27.000
a lot of the times like people-

51:27.000 --> 51:28.240
But why would you ask that question

51:28.240 --> 51:29.560
if you weren't happy?

51:29.560 --> 51:31.280
Because other people are constantly going,

51:31.280 --> 51:33.000
you know, you guys fight all the time.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.400
Like, if you and I were on a desert island,

51:34.400 --> 51:38.200
I wouldn't know that I fought with you all the time.

51:38.200 --> 51:39.120
Right.

51:39.120 --> 51:40.920
I'm just interacting with you

51:40.920 --> 51:42.360
the way a mommy does a daddy.

51:43.720 --> 51:45.000
The way I understand it.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.760
And then my sane friends go,

51:47.760 --> 51:50.480
Jesus Christ, you guys hate each other.

51:51.120 --> 51:55.640
Like, does the person that wrote that down

51:55.640 --> 51:57.040
want to retain their anonymity

51:57.040 --> 51:59.200
or can you answer a couple questions by shouting out?

51:59.200 --> 52:01.320
Yeah, just simple.

52:01.320 --> 52:03.160
There are 20 guys in the audience

52:03.160 --> 52:04.960
that are about to throw up.

52:04.960 --> 52:05.800
Okay.

52:07.280 --> 52:08.200
If you want to come up, come up.

52:08.200 --> 52:09.200
If you're okay with that.

52:09.200 --> 52:10.040
Come on down.

52:10.040 --> 52:11.360
Come on down.

52:11.360 --> 52:14.720
This would be a good time for sound cue.

52:14.720 --> 52:15.880
Here it comes.

52:15.880 --> 52:17.240
Here's the sound cue.

52:18.080 --> 52:19.240
Hear it.

52:19.240 --> 52:21.720
Sorry, you can take this.

52:21.720 --> 52:24.120
I'm sorry, first of all, I'm sorry about my girlfriend.

52:24.120 --> 52:26.280
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

52:26.280 --> 52:28.480
Welcome to the bottom of the sea

52:28.480 --> 52:32.240
where, or the inside of a uterus,

52:32.240 --> 52:33.720
whatever that sound effect was.

52:33.720 --> 52:34.560
It's comfortable.

52:34.560 --> 52:35.400
It's cozy.

52:36.280 --> 52:38.000
Your name is ma'am.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
My name's Tiffany.

52:39.000 --> 52:39.840
Tiffany.

52:39.840 --> 52:40.840
You got to call her a miss, brah.

52:42.520 --> 52:44.440
I don't know that code.

52:44.440 --> 52:45.680
I don't know.

52:45.680 --> 52:50.320
Call always, gentlemen always call young women miss.

52:50.320 --> 52:51.160
All right.

52:51.160 --> 52:53.280
So when you get called ma'am, it's a bummer, right?

52:53.280 --> 52:54.240
No, go ahead.

52:54.240 --> 52:55.080
Call me ma'am.

52:55.080 --> 52:57.480
All right, thanks for selling me out.

52:57.480 --> 52:59.160
Sisterhood.

52:59.160 --> 53:01.480
I'm wearing a suit, but I'm a woman.

53:01.480 --> 53:03.480
Back me up, ma'am.

53:03.480 --> 53:05.280
I don't know.

53:05.280 --> 53:06.240
All right, so I'm sorry.

53:06.240 --> 53:09.120
What's your name, young little tater tot?

53:10.520 --> 53:11.560
My name's Tiffany.

53:11.560 --> 53:12.400
Tiffany, right.

53:12.400 --> 53:13.220
You've already said that.

53:13.220 --> 53:14.060
Okay, got it.

53:14.060 --> 53:14.900
All right.

53:14.900 --> 53:15.740
Nomadic advice.

53:15.740 --> 53:16.580
Tiffany gave a-

53:16.580 --> 53:17.420
A Tiffany.

53:17.420 --> 53:18.880
Tiffany, the name was Tiffany.

53:20.240 --> 53:21.240
All right, Tiffany.

53:22.120 --> 53:24.480
So you're, is he here?

53:24.480 --> 53:25.320
Yeah, he's back there.

53:25.320 --> 53:26.160
Oh, Jesus.

53:26.160 --> 53:27.480
Yeah.

53:27.480 --> 53:31.160
He was very mad that I wrote that question, actually.

53:31.160 --> 53:33.160
And we had a little fight about it.

53:33.160 --> 53:35.000
We had a little fight about it.

53:35.000 --> 53:35.840
I'm being mad.

53:35.840 --> 53:36.680
Yeah, of course.

53:36.680 --> 53:38.360
You guys, yeah, well, that's what Erin

53:38.360 --> 53:39.960
and I fight about fighting.

53:39.960 --> 53:41.800
So, so, so.

53:41.800 --> 53:43.120
Tiffany, you're 26.

53:43.120 --> 53:45.240
No, I was like listening to what you were saying

53:45.240 --> 53:47.720
and it felt exactly like when she said,

53:47.720 --> 53:49.560
you can, you can play Minecraft in here.

53:49.560 --> 53:53.120
I'm like the, I think I've texted that to him before.

53:53.120 --> 53:54.440
No.

53:54.440 --> 53:56.400
Okay, did you ever read that,

53:56.400 --> 53:58.640
men are from Mars, women are from Venus thing?

53:58.640 --> 53:59.480
No.

53:59.480 --> 54:00.480
There was a, I didn't either,

54:00.480 --> 54:01.920
but I listened to the book on tape.

54:01.920 --> 54:07.040
And, and the guy, cause I was taking a road trip

54:07.040 --> 54:10.200
and the guy said that women are like waves.

54:10.200 --> 54:12.680
They crash, they rise and fall

54:12.680 --> 54:14.200
and men are like rubber bands.

54:14.200 --> 54:17.360
They back away and then they snap forward.

54:17.360 --> 54:18.200
So you've probably-

54:18.200 --> 54:19.040
Also they're everywhere.

54:19.040 --> 54:19.880
You can always find a new one.

54:19.880 --> 54:24.720
Yeah.

54:24.720 --> 54:28.680
I love you, I love you so much.

54:28.680 --> 54:29.520
I love you so much.

54:29.520 --> 54:30.360
I'm so sorry.

54:30.360 --> 54:32.080
I'm just as happy as a podcast producer.

54:32.080 --> 54:33.120
Cause like, oh, there's an edit point.

54:33.120 --> 54:34.640
We can pretend the show ended there.

54:34.640 --> 54:38.440
I'm in the middle of an interview.

54:38.440 --> 54:40.400
Tiffany, how, how old are you when you,

54:40.400 --> 54:43.000
how old were you guys when you first started dating?

54:43.000 --> 54:45.200
We were 16 and now we're 24.

54:45.200 --> 54:46.040
Whoa.

54:46.040 --> 54:48.760
How old were you guys when you moved in together?

54:48.760 --> 54:52.560
Um, in 19, 19.

54:52.560 --> 54:54.200
Okay. In 19, 19.

54:54.200 --> 54:55.720
No, no, I got it.

54:55.720 --> 54:56.560
I'm sorry.

54:56.560 --> 54:57.400
That was me being-

54:57.400 --> 54:58.520
I was trying to think of it.

54:58.520 --> 54:59.360
No, you got it.

54:59.360 --> 55:00.200
We were 18 years old.

55:00.200 --> 55:01.040
You're great.

55:01.040 --> 55:02.400
I would like to be your friend.

55:02.400 --> 55:06.560
Um, I, we, we change.

55:06.560 --> 55:08.480
I would say no matter what happens,

55:08.480 --> 55:11.480
we all change so much from 16 to 24.

55:11.480 --> 55:12.600
We turn into different people.

55:12.600 --> 55:14.080
We become different people.

55:14.080 --> 55:15.040
So no matter what happened,

55:15.040 --> 55:17.840
there, there are no heroes or villains.

55:17.840 --> 55:18.800
As Dan told me once,

55:18.800 --> 55:20.360
there's no good or bad and love.

55:20.360 --> 55:22.360
There's just honest and dishonest.

55:22.360 --> 55:24.000
So let's get them up here.

55:25.680 --> 55:26.520
Can we do that?

55:26.520 --> 55:27.520
He doesn't want to come up here.

55:27.520 --> 55:28.360
I'm so sorry.

55:28.360 --> 55:29.920
Is he willing to come up or is he-

55:29.920 --> 55:30.760
No, don't.

55:30.760 --> 55:31.800
Okay. No, don't make him.

55:31.800 --> 55:32.640
That's the-

55:32.640 --> 55:33.480
No, that's it.

55:33.480 --> 55:35.760
The, uh, but it's, it's, it's-

55:35.760 --> 55:38.120
I mean, come up if you want to come up.

55:38.120 --> 55:41.080
Don't have me telling you to do things I don't care.

55:44.080 --> 55:45.280
Men are like-

55:45.280 --> 55:47.120
We get invites to your imaginary wedding.

55:47.120 --> 55:48.160
They're rubber bands.

55:48.160 --> 55:51.160
Men, men pull back when they feel like

55:51.160 --> 55:54.480
there's a risk of them being emasculated

55:54.480 --> 55:56.080
or confined, constricted.

55:56.080 --> 55:59.680
Men, men have this like tendency according to this book.

55:59.680 --> 56:00.520
I'll trust this guy.

56:00.520 --> 56:03.480
He sounds like he's eating a ton of pussy.

56:03.480 --> 56:06.480
If you, if you ever heard his voice on tape,

56:06.480 --> 56:09.440
he just sounds the most masculine guy in the world.

56:11.920 --> 56:14.160
But, but he says something that kind of resonated with me.

56:14.160 --> 56:16.120
It's like, yeah, women go up and down.

56:16.120 --> 56:17.840
What's the most frequent conversation?

56:17.840 --> 56:19.880
What's the most frequent ending to every argument

56:19.880 --> 56:21.800
that men and women have?

56:21.800 --> 56:24.640
It's, uh, I didn't want, with a woman saying,

56:24.640 --> 56:27.400
I didn't want you to do anything about it.

56:27.400 --> 56:30.880
I just wanted you to like support me.

56:30.880 --> 56:33.200
And the man going, I don't understand what the fuck you're-

56:33.200 --> 56:36.400
Wasn't that you with the door to her?

56:36.400 --> 56:38.120
Yeah, well, that's a, look.

56:38.120 --> 56:43.120
Uh, all right, back on Team Women.

56:43.120 --> 56:47.600
We welcome you back on behalf of all the ladies.

56:47.600 --> 56:50.160
I told her, I told her, Mariam,

56:50.160 --> 56:51.160
you've been together eight years.

56:51.160 --> 56:53.400
That was before the 16th thing that you have,

56:53.400 --> 56:55.000
you adjust for inflation there.

56:55.000 --> 56:58.360
Six, 16 to 20 doesn't count,

56:58.360 --> 57:00.720
but that doesn't mean that your relationship doesn't count.

57:00.720 --> 57:02.680
That's still a four year relationship.

57:02.680 --> 57:04.480
I don't, not good at math.

57:05.720 --> 57:08.240
I have never gone more than three years.

57:08.240 --> 57:09.440
And at the end of three years,

57:09.440 --> 57:12.200
like a relationship to last a certain length,

57:12.200 --> 57:14.160
like there's a, I'm a behaviorist,

57:14.160 --> 57:17.920
not a, I think that if people are together,

57:17.920 --> 57:19.680
then it says that they want to be together.

57:19.680 --> 57:21.880
And if in that relationship they're fighting,

57:21.880 --> 57:24.920
then it says that both of them are kind of like

57:24.920 --> 57:27.160
committing to this like opera where you fight,

57:27.160 --> 57:28.920
and that's a definition of relationship.

57:28.920 --> 57:32.000
And like, if you, if he's going like,

57:32.000 --> 57:34.880
I'm gonna go down to my boxers and like disappear

57:34.880 --> 57:37.000
and hide in the closet and play on my laptop.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.120
And God knows what, and you're going like,

57:39.120 --> 57:40.840
I don't know, I just want, you know,

57:40.840 --> 57:45.080
I say, take your hands off the wheel,

57:45.080 --> 57:46.200
and if the car goes in the ditch,

57:46.200 --> 57:47.640
you're not going to die because it's not a car,

57:47.640 --> 57:48.480
it's a relationship.

57:48.480 --> 57:51.200
I, I would say,

57:51.200 --> 57:52.040
Good analogy.

57:52.040 --> 57:53.760
That's my advice to everyone here

57:53.760 --> 57:55.200
for every problem that you have.

57:55.200 --> 57:56.160
I guess we could, yeah.

57:56.160 --> 57:57.880
I would say, I would say no matter what,

57:57.880 --> 58:00.200
and I hope this isn't a catalyst for like a,

58:00.200 --> 58:01.760
like a big conversation you have.

58:01.760 --> 58:02.760
You're going to have a huge fight.

58:02.760 --> 58:03.600
You're just trying to be really careful.

58:03.600 --> 58:04.640
I know, I know, but I just,

58:04.640 --> 58:08.360
I just want to say that like we are culture values,

58:08.360 --> 58:10.600
love and commitment so much, and that's important,

58:10.600 --> 58:12.320
but like no matter what happens,

58:12.320 --> 58:14.280
that means something that you guys were together

58:14.280 --> 58:15.120
for so long.

58:15.120 --> 58:15.960
That's meaningful.

58:15.960 --> 58:17.800
And like I had early relationships,

58:17.800 --> 58:21.560
and I bet with non-geniuses.

58:21.560 --> 58:26.560
Those relationships that you have are important,

58:29.520 --> 58:30.920
and if something was to happen,

58:30.920 --> 58:33.880
and you guys were to go on different paths,

58:33.880 --> 58:36.160
it doesn't negate what you had already,

58:36.160 --> 58:37.360
and you could still love each other,

58:37.360 --> 58:39.880
even if you want different things.

58:39.880 --> 58:41.920
I mean, you may call him from time to time,

58:41.920 --> 58:42.760
just ask him if he wants to fuck you with a drawing.

58:42.760 --> 58:44.640
Jesus Christ, he's trying to break up with her,

58:44.640 --> 58:47.280
like right in front of him.

58:47.280 --> 58:50.160
This is why women drive me nuts, we're done.

58:51.320 --> 58:52.800
Am I, what, I'm siding with a guy,

58:52.800 --> 58:53.640
because he's a guy?

58:53.640 --> 58:55.120
I hate myself.

58:55.120 --> 58:57.800
No, it's fine, there's no, there's no, there's no side.

58:57.800 --> 59:00.760
Tiffany, I will say you are in for a world of shit

59:00.760 --> 59:02.720
when you go back to your seat.

59:02.720 --> 59:04.480
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

59:04.480 --> 59:06.320
All right, well, thanks, Tiffany, for being here.

59:06.320 --> 59:07.160
It's here for Tiffany.

59:07.160 --> 59:10.640
And a relationship for us, for our paltry.

59:12.640 --> 59:14.600
Ooh, this is a good question.

59:14.600 --> 59:16.960
We didn't commit any crimes just now

59:16.960 --> 59:19.440
that numerous reality shows don't commit.

59:19.440 --> 59:20.480
Like, there was that reality show

59:20.480 --> 59:22.320
that basically murdered Corey Hame,

59:22.320 --> 59:25.200
just for, you know, I don't think that.

59:25.200 --> 59:27.760
The hilarious of you, we're on drugs in the house,

59:27.760 --> 59:29.400
like one more drugs, and he's dead,

59:29.400 --> 59:31.040
and they're like, well, I guess that show's canceled.

59:31.040 --> 59:34.600
No, I don't want anyone to break up,

59:34.600 --> 59:37.240
I just, I want people to not feel guilty

59:37.240 --> 59:38.480
for their paths changing,

59:38.480 --> 59:41.320
or to not value their previous relationships.

59:41.320 --> 59:43.120
Right, but she didn't, her question wasn't,

59:43.120 --> 59:46.520
and I don't want to fight with you, but, again.

59:46.520 --> 59:49.320
But her question wasn't, what do I do

59:49.320 --> 59:50.640
about the fact that our past changed?

59:50.640 --> 59:52.680
But there's a reason why you ask a question,

59:52.680 --> 59:54.520
like if I put in like, well, not.

59:54.520 --> 59:55.920
I fucking hate you so much.

59:55.920 --> 01:00:00.280
I just, like, I just, we'll have it out in the car.

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:05.280
Wow, I turned into, let's try it, let's see what happens.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:07.560
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:11.640
All right, Dan Harmon, a relationship expert,

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:15.240
how do I get out of the friend zone?

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.080
How do I?

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.200
Oh, you know, the friend zone.

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:22.160
I run it into the ground, fucking, like, tell her,

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.160
I'm assuming this is a dude.

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:29.120
There is such a thing as a girl

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.080
that ends up in the friend zone, but, ugh.

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:35.160
There's wispy mustache sweat on this,

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:38.560
so I believe it is, I believe it is a dude.

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:41.480
There is, there is a, every once in a while,

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:43.800
a canvas wants to know how to treat a paintbrush,

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:46.840
but, yeah, it's probably a guy asking

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.760
how to get out of the friend zone.

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.000
It happens, sometimes you paint by going like this

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:51.960
with an easel.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:56.960
Uh, the answer, we were in the friend zone.

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.720
You already know the answer to that question.

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:06.720
You tell her how you feel because she will run

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:11.320
like you're a fucking atom bomb, like you,

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:13.560
and be honest with yourself about whether you can

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:17.360
stand hanging out with her when sex is off the table.

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.840
The friend zone thing is like a sticking point with me

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:23.480
because I had that issue with you.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.000
Oh, that's what you said.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.500
You and I were the, yeah, I fucking, I wanted to die.

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:33.880
I thinly tolerated it, but I said to you,

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.720
I demanded to know what this really meant,

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.280
this platonic relationship.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:40.360
Did it mean that you had other irons in the fire?

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:41.480
Is that what that means?

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:42.920
Does it you and me, hang on.

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:46.600
The idea that you not being ready for a relationship,

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:51.600
does that mean that you're not ready for a relationship

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.560
with like seven dudes at the same time?

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.560
Or does that mean that you really like me?

01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:00.720
But I, that's not really the point because it's her,

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:01.840
how she responds is up to her.

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.000
But there were reasons, right.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.400
Like it wasn't, it wasn't a normal shitty girl situation.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.600
There were reasons behind it.

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.760
The thing with it, the thing that a guy has to do

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:12.560
to protect himself from that is to always just like,

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:17.480
as uncharismatic and as like, we're encouraged as guys,

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:19.560
we go, women always call us liars.

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:21.360
They always go like, oh, guys are pigs,

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.920
you're liars and all this stuff.

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:26.360
Guys are, we are pigs, dogs, whatever that animal,

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:27.960
whatever animal metaphor you want to use,

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.160
but we're simple.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.800
We are capable of just being honest and blunt

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.160
about what it is we want.

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.280
And we kind of like get trained over time,

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.600
probably justifiably, to have a little bit of

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:42.600
grace about it, but that can slide into lying

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:49.560
and deceiving and like playing some weird game.

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.040
And then on the other side, there are honest women

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:56.080
who are cool with that and will say to guys like,

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:59.160
I think you might, you say you want to be platonic friends,

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:02.400
but I feel like this is more than that.

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.960
I just want to make sure you understand, right?

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:06.600
Okay, communication works.

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.760
But then there are as many dishonest women

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.760
as there are dishonest men, and so what happens

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.720
is there's a guy on one side going like,

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:15.000
I'm in it for the long con.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.040
I'm going to sneak in the back door.

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:21.280
She's with Richard right now, but I'm there when she cries.

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.680
I've got her umbrella.

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.680
I love umbrellas.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:29.080
To put under her eyes for her cheeks?

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.160
Something like that.

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.440
Who's this talking to me?

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.680
Is it God?

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:36.760
This is God, Jerry.

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.600
Oh God, keep it down, will you?

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:42.160
Jerry, Jerry, I want to talk to you.

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:44.000
I'm just talking to myself, the audience,

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.800
Shakespearean character, sometimes they talk outward

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:48.120
to share their thoughts and feelings.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:48.960
Yeah, yeah, I hear you.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.200
It's not necessarily an invitation

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:51.640
to a fucking full dialogue.

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:54.720
I'm just a guy trying to get laid.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:57.240
Jerry, first of all, I love your burlap pants.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:03.800
Second of all, sometimes everybody, women and men,

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:07.040
men and men go through different stages of insecurity.

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:07.880
Oh God.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.560
How'd you make such an exciting world?

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:21.000
Are you the same God that invented flamingos?

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.680
You're just dragging me down.

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:24.520
Oh yeah, that was me.

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.480
I was in a good mood.

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:28.400
I created the flamingo and the platypus.

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.440
What can I do to get you back in that mood?

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:33.760
I'm looking for more of a flamingo God,

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.920
less of a Judd Hirsch from Taxi God.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.080
Jerry, I talked to very few people.

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:40.520
You're wasting your God time.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.360
Point taken, finish up.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:50.840
Jerry, women and men, when they're first starting today,

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:52.400
they're sometimes insecure.

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.160
So I think that sometimes nice guys,

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.800
when they're younger, when they're teenagers

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.880
and are in their early 20s and they approach women

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.760
and they're like, I just wanna be friends,

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:02.640
it's hard when you're insecure

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.400
to accept that somebody likes you.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.680
So then when women get older,

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:10.160
that insecurity thing kind of changes a little bit.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.280
So with that friend thing,

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:15.040
like maybe it's more about her than it is about you

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:19.640
and you should probably go bark up a different tree

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:20.680
or become a rock star.

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:21.840
All right, what are you saying?

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:23.920
Like take your God mask off, Erin.

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.400
It was me the whole time.

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.680
It was me, Dan, the whole time.

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.400
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:31.240
No, no, no.

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.520
You're saying that some of the situations

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:34.360
where men are-

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.440
I guess if it's friends over then,

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.320
the friends over person, if you're comfortable,

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:39.840
if you could just scream at your age really quick.

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:42.160
If you're gonna-

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:44.880
Oh, the guy who, well yeah, he doesn't wanna,

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.720
he doesn't, he's sitting with the chick

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.880
that he's in the friend zone with.

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:49.720
She thinks that he's awesome.

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:50.760
And she's like, thank you so much

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:52.760
for giving me a ride to Alex's house.

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:53.600
I appreciate it.

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.880
He's three years into a nine year jackpot.

01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:57.840
I was saying like, I was-

01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.640
He's not gonna fuck it up for us.

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:02.200
He's not like Tiffany and Zorro,

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:03.040
whoever she can be.

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:05.760
I'm speaking a Zorro.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.160
Well, I assume he's Zorro.

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:10.200
He fucking gets away with murder with her.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.600
We don't, the friend zone, don't get in it.

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:14.920
That's the only advice we can give.

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:16.640
It's like saying, how do I get out of quicksand?

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:17.480
You can't murder your dad.

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:19.320
Well, I just wanna say it's more-

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:21.320
Don't ever, when you see it, step around it.

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.440
I would say, I would say-

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:24.280
Where's no shoes?

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.920
The board, I would say across the board.

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.280
And I think ladies will agree with me.

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:30.800
If your intentions are romantic, fucking own that.

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:33.720
Don't be like, hey, like, yeah, this isn't a date.

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:36.240
I mean, if I can just drive you to coffee or whatever.

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.920
And then all of a sudden, say like,

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:40.440
by the way, I'm gonna look at pussy.

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.480
Like that's the worst.

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.520
That's dishonest.

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:48.200
If you, my friends are like shaking their heads.

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.680
So don't do that.

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.760
Well, I'm just saying like, if you're interested in somebody,

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:55.960
first look Jerry in the mirror and say,

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:59.200
Jerry, you're cool because you're smart.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.920
You made these burlap pants.

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.080
No one wears burlap pants.

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.400
And then when you see a girl that you like,

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:06.240
go up to her.

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.680
Hey, hey, oh, what's your name?

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:10.880
My name is Angela.

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:13.200
Hey, Angela, I think you're real beautiful.

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.680
If I could buy you a drink sometime, I would love that.

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.040
Oh, thank you.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.280
Don't do, it doesn't always work.

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:24.280
But it's more likely to get you laid than the alternative,

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:27.600
which is like, hey, hey, my name is Jerry.

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.080
What's your name?

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:29.920
Angela?

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:33.360
Cool, cool, doing a bring your standup show.

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:34.840
A lot of friends are coming.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:36.400
It's not a date.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.760
Not a date.

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.520
Yeah, if you want to come, that'd be great.

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:40.960
I'll be Facebooking you later.

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.360
So we agree on something.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:45.640
That I agree, yeah, ask women out.

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:47.560
Like that's a great way to avoid,

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:49.280
like ask them out to dinner.

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:53.160
Say, let's watch Breaking Bad together.

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.560
I don't, like, tell them basically,

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.080
I'm interested in you.

01:07:58.080 --> 01:07:59.000
Well, that's where I,

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.040
Well, and that's what you did.

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:03.360
Yeah, well, at first I said,

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:06.600
platonic drinks, I did that once, that's my limit.

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:08.320
I said, hey, platonic drinks, right?

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.320
Yep, okay, how can you turn that down?

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.720
Cause you'd be a monster, that's my bear trap.

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:13.560
Psh.

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:18.280
That's the friend zone working for you.

01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:20.640
Then after platonic drinks, you go,

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:23.120
guess what, someone's interested in something

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.800
a little bit more happy.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:28.160
And then they tell you yes or no.

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:30.480
The difficult thing is not being afraid of the no.

01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:31.440
That's the horrible thing.

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:32.840
Cause you feel like if they say no,

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:36.320
then your balls fall off and a fish hook grabs you

01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:39.840
and you, it turns out you lived in a pond your whole life

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:42.560
and that someone gets to eat you if women don't like you.

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:43.960
All right, we're going to do,

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:45.840
welcome to the rapid fire round.

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:49.520
We're, this is the part of Harmontown.

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:52.040
All of my answers will be three words.

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:52.880
Okay.

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:53.720
No.

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:57.640
Okay, should I put on music?

01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:58.480
No.

01:08:58.480 --> 01:08:59.320
Okay.

01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:02.000
Cause you will press a button

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.800
and it'll be a philasa raptor.

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:05.640
Are you sure?

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.000
Well, just a little.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.040
All right, you're A, I'm sorry.

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.600
Okay.

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:12.680
What is true love?

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:18.160
You don't have to limit yourself.

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:20.520
I, I'll, I'll have my hand up.

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:22.760
Dying for another.

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:23.600
All right.

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.240
How do I know, how do I know it's love?

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:30.920
You died, sir.

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:37.000
My wife, my wife isn't a redhead.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.520
What should I do?

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:42.600
Show her.

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:43.440
Clare all.

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:49.400
All right.

01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:51.400
What's too gross of an age difference

01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:52.720
when the ladies older?

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:56.120
I, lady in parentheses and 31.

01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:57.160
Seven.

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:01.520
But.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:02.600
Oh.

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:03.440
Awesome.

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:07.200
I don't know if I had a minimum of three.

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:08.440
I said, Mac.

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:11.520
What are your views on masturbation

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:15.560
of the, in parentheses of a sexual and artistic kind?

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:17.760
And then an asterisk and its effect

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.320
on romantic relationships.

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:22.320
Do it constantly.

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.000
Thank you everybody.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.440
This has been Harmon Tell.

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:28.360
Let's hear it for Dan Harmon.

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.880
If you guys want to talk to me,

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:33.920
I'll be, oh shit.

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:35.640
I want to thank people.

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:36.480
You're playing the thing.

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:37.440
Here we go.

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:38.280
Let's play it.

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:39.720
I want to thank some people that are involved in the show

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:41.400
now that we're actually podcasting it.

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:42.240
Really fucking.

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.840
Also, if you want to, I'll take a little break,

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.160
but I'll be hovering around here.

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.840
If you want to like talk to me.

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.440
I don't want to be presumptuous about that.

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.120
I don't pretend that anyone wants to talk to me.

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:52.480
Guys, it really means a lot to him.

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:53.680
So please come up and talk to him.

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:56.480
I want to thank you for coming to a Harmontown Town meeting.

01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:58.280
We'll do another one next week, another weekly,

01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:00.000
but I want to thank Katie Levine

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.160
for doing the audio recording here on site.

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:03.000
Thank you.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:03.840
Thank you.

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:07.320
Zac McKeever for doing all things technical,

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:09.760
making sure we don't pop and whistle and everything,

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:10.880
audio related.

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.600
Emily Gordon, who I don't think is here,

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.080
but she's the producer of the live shows.

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:17.560
Her idea to do this in the first place.

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:20.160
Daniel Kramer, the program director,

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:24.200
and Mo Fatahbab, god damn it, Mo.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:25.040
Did I get that right?

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:25.880
Fatahbab?

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:26.720
It's Egyptian.

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:28.840
Mo Fatahbab is the on-site director,

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:30.600
and Daniel Kramer is the program director.

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:32.840
Dustin Marshall is our podcast producer.

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:36.760
He's in charge of making sure we can get on the air for you.

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:39.600
And I also want to give a very special thanks to Jenny Fine,

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.760
who made our Harmontown winning logo

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:44.480
for the Harmontown podcast.

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:45.480
Thank you, Jenny.

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:48.320
Thank you so much for...

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.920
Dustin Marshall and Dustin Marshall.

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:51.040
I thank Dustin Marshall.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:51.880
All right.

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:53.040
I'm gonna fucking break up with you

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:55.080
as soon as the show's over.

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.080
Thank you for coming.

01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:58.040
No one's amused by that anger.

01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:59.680
It's always been funny to me.

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:01.200
I'm from Wisconsin.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:02.360
Thank you so much.

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:03.200
I love you, Jan.

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.040
Dan, I love you.

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:05.040
I love you, too.

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.760
Thank you for coming to our Valentine's edition

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:07.760
of Harmontown.

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:10.240
I'll see you next week.

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:29.920
Thank you so much.
