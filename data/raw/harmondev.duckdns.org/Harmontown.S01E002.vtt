{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:01.200\nGood evening.\n\n00:01.200 --> 00:06.720\nParmenians, Parmenianettes,\n\n00:06.720 --> 00:10.240\nherey, herey, welcome to the best night of your lives.\n\n00:11.520 --> 00:16.020\nLet's welcome the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:16.020 --> 00:17.020\nThank you.\n\n00:17.020 --> 00:18.020\nThank you.\n\n00:18.020 --> 00:19.020\nThank you.\n\n00:19.020 --> 00:20.020\nThank you.\n\n00:20.020 --> 00:21.020\nThank you.\n\n00:21.020 --> 00:22.020\nThank you.\n\n00:22.020 --> 00:23.020\nThank you.\n\n00:23.020 --> 00:24.020\nThank you.\n\n00:24.020 --> 00:25.020\nThank you.\n\n00:25.020 --> 00:26.020\nThank you.\n\n00:26.020 --> 00:27.020\nThank you.\n\n00:27.020 --> 00:28.020\nThank you.\n\n00:28.020 --> 00:29.020\nWho needs a card?\n\n00:29.020 --> 00:30.020\nWho needs a card?\n\n00:30.020 --> 00:31.020\nPlease.\n\n00:31.020 --> 00:32.020\nWhat a crowd.\n\n00:32.020 --> 00:33.020\nWhat a crowd.\n\n00:33.020 --> 00:35.020\nI'd like to welcome and thank our acting comptroller, Erin McGathy.\n\n00:35.020 --> 00:36.020\nOh!\n\n00:36.020 --> 00:37.020\nHi.\n\n00:37.020 --> 00:41.020\nI'm very nervous and insecure.\n\n00:41.020 --> 00:42.020\nDon't be alarmed.\n\n00:42.020 --> 00:43.620\nJeff just texted me.\n\n00:43.620 --> 00:46.100\nIf you're on stage right now, turn off your phone.\n\n00:46.100 --> 00:49.020\nI'm already failing.\n\n00:49.020 --> 00:53.320\nWell, with advice like that flowing in, how can?\n\n00:53.320 --> 00:54.320\nDon't worry.\n\n00:54.320 --> 01:02.480\nalso is my acting girlfriend. We've talked about it on the drive up here. We're both\n\n01:02.480 --> 01:09.080\nabsolute consummate preparationists. We simply just, we really...\n\n01:09.080 --> 01:13.920\nSo we're sure that we invented a word. Yes. We actually sat down and said, what will\n\n01:13.920 --> 01:17.400\nthe word be for people who prepare a lot? And we said, let's stutter as we say it.\n\n01:17.400 --> 01:24.800\nAlright. It was all planned out. Every experience. This is the inception of talking. Everything's\n\n01:24.800 --> 01:28.600\nplanned out. You'll record it and you'll go back over and go, no the van backed over\n\n01:28.600 --> 01:34.760\nas they were slalloming. Which works perfectly. What a Jack movie. Can we admit, no? Oh,\n\n01:34.760 --> 01:43.640\nokay, no. Alright. Alright. Hey, man. I am not Napoleon. I am a populist. I'm Obama.\n\n01:43.640 --> 01:51.880\nIf you don't like, if you like something, I like it. Inception. Three dreams at the\n\n01:51.880 --> 02:03.720\nsame time. Couple notes. They start that movie, Two Dreams Deep. I wish I could use the N\n\n02:03.720 --> 02:11.120\nword. It's like, please. It's a fucking movie about dreams being real. Give me a taste.\n\n02:11.120 --> 02:27.080\nDon't assume I'm stupid. It's dramatic music. But step into it. Every pool has stairs. You\n\n02:27.080 --> 02:35.280\njust wander in. Show me an example of a dream. A guy being in the dream. Hey, man. You enjoying\n\n02:35.280 --> 02:42.600\nthat soup? Yes, I am. It's delicious. You know what I love about it? It's so real. Psych.\n\n02:42.600 --> 02:50.280\nYou're dreaming. I thought that soup was real. So in conclusion, sir, I think you could use\n\n02:50.280 --> 03:00.400\nmy services. You're hired. It's the way that you use it. And then do the credits. And then\n\n03:00.400 --> 03:04.600\nin the credits, like reveal, like, okay, there's a little call to adventure. There were two\n\n03:04.600 --> 03:11.880\ndreams deep. And then have the threshold be, we need to go three dreams deep, maybe. Or\n\n03:11.880 --> 03:17.040\nthree deep. That's never charismatic when you forget the are in dreams. It makes you,\n\n03:17.040 --> 03:24.200\nthat makes all of you go, I should be up there. I can say the word dreams. Well, the wizards\n\n03:24.200 --> 03:33.000\nbehind the curtain. No longer. The emperor's clothes are here. Which is the name of your\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:39.640\nautobiography. Both of those things. I got a little sidetracked. I want to make a promise\n\n03:39.640 --> 03:45.160\nto you that's not going to happen tonight. Harmontown is, for those of you who have\n\n03:45.160 --> 03:50.280\nnot been here nine, ten times, we've done this. It's a town meeting. I think that's very\n\n03:50.280 --> 03:57.480\nclear from the description of the show, which is now going to be a weekly podcast. It seems\n\n03:57.480 --> 04:03.880\nlike that deserves applause. It's a thing that's seen when a comic says I just had a baby. And\n\n04:03.880 --> 04:09.680\nthen half the time they didn't. You ever notice that? You notice the comics, they always say\n\n04:09.680 --> 04:14.280\nthey had babies. And then they just, they're just taking you for a fucking ride. They had\n\n04:14.280 --> 04:18.080\na baby and you go, where do you go? AIDS.\n\n04:18.080 --> 04:24.320\nDanda's, Dana Gould. You didn't have a baby, Dana Gould.\n\n04:24.320 --> 04:28.760\nAnd as exclusively observational comic, comic humor.\n\n04:28.760 --> 04:35.640\nIn keeping with my meta-sensibility, they got me fired. I'm a comics comic. Comics,\n\n04:35.640 --> 04:45.760\ncomics, comics. It's like the first scene of Inception. Hard to follow. Labyrinthine.\n\n04:45.760 --> 04:51.160\nYou know, like Back to the Future. No. That movie started with a kid who wasn't time traveling.\n\n04:51.160 --> 04:59.240\nI don't mean to shake my cane at you, Christopher Nolan. Did he direct that?\n\n04:59.240 --> 05:00.240\nI don't know.\n\n05:00.240 --> 05:05.640\nDavid Finchman? Batman? Who directed it? That doesn't matter.\n\n05:05.640 --> 05:11.880\nLet's hear it for Back to the Future.\n\n05:11.880 --> 05:15.840\nTonight we wanted to, the concern was that Aaron is stepping in for Jeff so that the\n\n05:15.840 --> 05:21.320\nnight would, my fear with people that are couples, entertaining people is that it will\n\n05:21.320 --> 05:24.360\ndevolve very quickly into a kind of Regis and Kathy thing.\n\n05:24.360 --> 05:25.360\nWell it's so hard to say.\n\n05:25.360 --> 05:28.520\nWhere's you youngsters, Regis and Kelly?\n\n05:28.520 --> 05:31.880\nYou love me so much. So you were worried you were going to be distracted by my beautiful\n\n05:31.880 --> 05:32.880\nface.\n\n05:32.880 --> 05:36.280\nYeah, that it would be saccharin or that we'd go, remember that time you did that? No,\n\n05:36.280 --> 05:37.280\nyou did it.\n\n05:37.280 --> 05:47.600\nBut you know, so I want to, I think that saying that out loud will keep that from happening.\n\n05:47.600 --> 05:48.600\nI'm probably wrong.\n\n05:48.600 --> 05:49.600\nWell let's forget it.\n\n05:49.600 --> 05:50.600\nOkay.\n\n05:50.600 --> 05:51.600\nFor now.\n\n05:51.600 --> 05:52.600\nYou're so cute tonight.\n\n05:52.600 --> 05:57.600\nYou look very handsome. Look how thin Dan looks.\n\n05:57.600 --> 06:02.560\nSee, it's not happening. This isn't a morning show.\n\n06:02.560 --> 06:08.640\nYou all should see how Danny looks underneath those clothes. I see how he looks naked. Because\n\n06:08.640 --> 06:13.560\nwe're dating and we're so in love. Am I doing this right?\n\n06:13.560 --> 06:17.800\nYeah, yeah, yeah. You gave me a flashback when you said, to this morning we were having\n\n06:17.800 --> 06:20.760\nbreakfast and then breakfast turned into like 3 p.m.\n\n06:20.760 --> 06:27.760\nBreakfast on each other's bits. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\n\n06:27.760 --> 06:28.760\nThe,\n\n06:28.760 --> 06:29.760\nWe were having breakfast this morning.\n\n06:29.760 --> 06:35.400\nI said, oh, you look like you lost weight and then I lifted up my, I went like that.\n\n06:35.400 --> 06:40.800\nThat's what the guy at the bar did. Except you can do it. You're fine. I love you guys.\n\n06:40.800 --> 06:44.560\nBut this guy did it. I was like, get out. I got up out of a booth at a restaurant and\n\n06:44.560 --> 06:47.560\nthen somebody said, oh, you look, yo, where'd it go? Where's the tummy? And I said, here\n\n06:47.560 --> 06:48.560\nit is.\n\n06:48.560 --> 06:53.760\nAnd this guy at the bar went, he was talking to his friend and so you have to, I have to,\n\n06:53.760 --> 06:58.480\nyou have to rewind, put your play head where I lift the shirt and you'll know where I do\n\n06:58.480 --> 07:03.840\nit. But I'm rewinding. Now you're from, this is like inception.\n\n07:03.840 --> 07:04.840\nKnock your chair over.\n\n07:04.840 --> 07:12.840\nWhoa, that always wakes you up. Where, what are the suitcases with the things? Come on\n\n07:12.840 --> 07:13.840\nguys.\n\n07:13.840 --> 07:17.000\nAnd what is Ellen Page, what is Ellen Page's role in that whole movie? She's learning\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:20.480\nhow to do it. She never does it. She never does it.\n\n07:20.480 --> 07:24.440\nWe're alienating them, honey. They love inception.\n\n07:24.440 --> 07:29.200\nI love, I thought that was great. A lot of them left a lot of Rotten Tomatoes reviews\n\n07:29.200 --> 07:36.280\nthat they're deeply ashamed of, but they got to fucking stick it out. Three years later,\n\n07:36.280 --> 07:43.120\nyou can't fucking let it go. You're the same way about goodwill hunting, you little fuckers.\n\n07:43.120 --> 07:52.560\nHow many of you own it? Did you buy it? Fuck you, buddy. I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. I'm\n\n07:52.560 --> 07:59.040\nsorry. Mixed signals. I'm sorry. Thank you for being honest. Fuck you for lying, all\n\n07:59.040 --> 08:04.120\nof you. Because none of you own it. Wait, no, you were all honest too. You didn't raise\n\n08:04.120 --> 08:08.440\nyour hands. Thank you all for being honest. Fuck me for not liking goodwill hunting. It's\n\n08:08.440 --> 08:12.720\na great movie. Listen to the name. You like those apples?\n\n08:12.720 --> 08:20.840\nHey, hey, no, no, answer the question. Do you like apples? I, I, fuck you. You fucking\n\n08:20.840 --> 08:29.720\ndork. No, no, no, just answer it. Okay, yes, I like apples, which, okay, you're putting\n\n08:29.720 --> 08:35.400\nme in the awkward position of having a stance on fucking apples. You're an idiot. But yes,\n\n08:35.400 --> 08:44.200\nI like apples. I just got a phone number. I don't, please, you're embarrassing yourself.\n\n08:44.200 --> 08:52.520\nMe, my parents, humanity, giraffes, any errant spy drones passing over, every, the thermograph\n\n08:52.520 --> 08:58.560\nof you is embarrassing. Holding a phone number, bragging about it with the apple tea up. Fuck\n\n08:58.560 --> 09:03.280\nyou. It's not, you don't give that movie an Oscar. What you get from that is 10 more\n\n09:03.280 --> 09:09.720\nmovies like that. Saving the Rebecca's Dreaming. Good, silvering.\n\n09:09.720 --> 09:15.680\nLogline. Logline for saving the Rebecca's Dreaming. Rebecca is a small town girl who's\n\n09:15.680 --> 09:18.280\nbeen in the big cities. She's coming back. They don't have loglines. They're fucking\n\n09:18.280 --> 09:22.760\npieces of shit. All they have is a special font that looks like on Golden Pond. That's\n\n09:22.760 --> 09:31.520\nall they have. Goodwill hunting. It means nothing. That's dumb. You can't just string\n\n09:31.520 --> 09:39.600\nwords together. Robocop. Fuck you. Awesome. Oscar. Where's the Oscar for Robocop? Thank\n\n09:39.600 --> 09:47.480\nyou, gentlemen. And lady. So we're at Little Don's. He left up your sweater. I left up\n\n09:47.480 --> 09:51.760\nmy shirt and the guy goes, so put the play head back to, I get out of the booth and the\n\n09:51.760 --> 09:58.840\nguy, I go, so this is the guy, and so I got to tell you where the camera is. Okay. This\n\n09:58.840 --> 10:06.880\nis, you're me, all of you. I'll play myself. You just lifted your shirt. So he's talking\n\n10:06.880 --> 10:12.160\nto his friend. Who's identical? They're both like, they're both built like me. I don't\n\n10:12.160 --> 10:15.000\nknow if it's important to say that. They both look like big burly bears. They're both\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:21.760\nlike, they're really good at pool. And that's not a compliment. They look like guys that's\n\n10:21.760 --> 10:26.680\nlike, I don't know what Trevor and Joey are skilled at, and then you play pool with them\n\n10:26.680 --> 10:31.600\nand you're like, oh. Oh, they're good at pool. They're good at pool. Oh. All right. So the\n\n10:31.600 --> 10:37.040\nguy's at the bar of this restaurant, which is two feet from the booth. I stand up. Someone\n\n10:37.040 --> 10:40.920\nsays, you look like, where's your belly? Where is it? I can't find it. That's a really\n\n10:40.920 --> 10:48.200\nnice thing to say. That was me. Oh, some lady. The guy said fucking gross. He looked at my\n\n10:48.200 --> 10:54.520\nbelly and said fucking gross. And you don't blame them. Who cares? My theory. This is\n\n10:54.520 --> 11:00.440\na morning show. There might be coffee in this cup. My theory on that guy is that he was\n\n11:00.440 --> 11:04.680\nan is homophobic. So we saw a man left up his shirt and he didn't want his buddy to think\n\n11:04.680 --> 11:08.920\nthat he liked it. So reflexively, he was like, this is gross. I don't like it. I don't like\n\n11:08.920 --> 11:17.040\nit. I would never suck at it. That's a good girlfriend at any rate. The guy called me\n\n11:17.040 --> 11:23.080\ngross. He just wants to fuck you. That's a good girlfriend. Well, that's my, that's\n\n11:23.080 --> 11:28.840\nmy explanation for anyone who's ever rude to me. So stop trying to fuck me so hard.\n\n11:28.840 --> 11:41.640\nMom. My mom's dad. Here is not a good girlfriend. You woke me up at 5.40 this morning. You weren't\n\n11:41.640 --> 11:49.800\nawake. You decided that in your sleep, you were having such a great dream. But I was\n\n11:49.800 --> 11:59.760\nawakened at 5.40 a.m. to Aaron saying, Dan, Dan, Dan. Oh, fuck shit. Look, look and get\n\n11:59.760 --> 12:03.600\nit. You got to do that. Hold up the stick. Look at the stick. And she's pointing the\n\n12:03.600 --> 12:08.600\ncorner of the room. And I, what's the stick? She's got the microphone. Hold up the stick.\n\n12:08.600 --> 12:18.080\nYou have to do it. And I, okay, I'm holding it. And she went. And then at 7.40, I'm like\n\n12:18.080 --> 12:23.400\nstill two hours later, I'm like staring at the ceiling worried about my finances. Every\n\n12:23.400 --> 12:29.200\nonce in a while, she's like. So like the stick dream is amazing. It's got like, it's got\n\n12:29.200 --> 12:34.520\nlike a comic figure in it. Like Charlie Callas comes out later as the, as the stick party.\n\n12:34.520 --> 12:41.400\nRaise your hand if you know who Charlie Callas is. There are five people, six people in their\n\n12:41.400 --> 12:46.240\nhands. Most of them are our friends. Because they've all gotten drunk with Jeff Davis and\n\n12:46.240 --> 12:49.880\nhe's made you watch Charlie Callas on YouTube for three hours.\n\n12:49.880 --> 12:53.280\nCharlie Callas is this incredibly unfunny comic from\n\n12:53.280 --> 12:54.840\nSweetie. He's dead.\n\n12:54.840 --> 13:03.320\nOh, he is dead. He's a dead unfunny comic from the six seasons, 70s who for no reason just\n\n13:03.320 --> 13:07.720\nmakes nonsense noises in the middle of explaining stories that no one cares about.\n\n13:07.720 --> 13:13.040\nWhy don't you give us an example? Charlie Callas impression is impeccable.\n\n13:13.040 --> 13:18.480\nCan you give us a suggestion for an activity that Charlie Callas might talk about?\n\n13:18.480 --> 13:21.480\nSure. Sure. What's an activity? Pool.\n\n13:21.480 --> 13:28.800\nPool? All right. So me and my friends, we went to the pool hall and one of them grabbed\n\n13:28.800 --> 13:35.840\na cue off the wall and I was like, and then he took the pool and took the pool ball and\n\n13:35.840 --> 13:43.200\nput it on the thing and I was like, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.\n\n13:43.200 --> 13:46.400\nThere's a phone call? Yeah. Sorry. It doesn't make sense.\n\n13:46.400 --> 13:47.400\nYeah. Yeah.\n\n13:47.400 --> 14:00.600\nHello. This is pool calling. And then we all went home.\n\n14:00.600 --> 14:01.600\nThank you.\n\n14:01.600 --> 14:09.320\nYeah. Good job applauding that because Charlie Callas is dead, but his wife, Rebecca Callas\n\n14:09.320 --> 14:12.680\nisn't. I'm sorry, honey. Come on up here.\n\n14:12.680 --> 14:18.360\nMy husband is just fucking crying and she just blows her brains everywhere.\n\n14:18.360 --> 14:24.280\nBut as she's blowing her brains, she says like, I'm going to kill. I'm going to kill.\n\n14:24.280 --> 14:33.560\nI'm going to kill. It'll be so funny when you Google it.\n\n14:33.560 --> 14:38.200\nSo Aaron and I have a perfect relationship, which is why, and also Aaron has a podcast\n\n14:38.200 --> 14:42.600\nabout relationships because, you know, do you remember the name of it?\n\n14:42.600 --> 14:46.160\nIt's this feels terrible. All right. I just wanted you to say it.\n\n14:46.160 --> 14:49.280\nOh, I'm sorry. Does someone boo?\n\n14:49.280 --> 14:55.240\nYeah. Well, they're booing your awkward approach to integrated marketing. Right. They're not\n\n14:55.240 --> 14:59.160\nbooing your podcast. They're booing. Like if Calgon came in and said, that sounds like\n\n14:59.160 --> 15:07.680\na clean situation, then they go boo. Thank you for sponsoring Harmontown. Fuck you for\n\n15:07.680 --> 15:08.680\nshoehorning it.\n\n15:08.680 --> 15:09.680\nSure.\n\n15:09.680 --> 15:10.680\nShould we talk about?\n\n15:10.680 --> 15:12.960\nOh yeah. I know. I'm sorry. You're saying we have a perfect relationship.\n\n15:12.960 --> 15:19.160\nRight. Right. That's the facade. This is like Sherman's March or I never saw it.\n\n15:19.160 --> 15:26.800\nIt's like Inception. You think it's a dream and the perfect relationship is going to turn\n\n15:26.800 --> 15:31.000\nout to not be perfect. Like Inception. Like the guy eating the soup is going to turn out\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:37.040\nto fucking that movie. Really, you guys are going to just stick to it. You just love it.\n\n15:37.040 --> 15:41.120\nYou're just going to die for it. Like if I come at Inception with a buoy knife, you're\n\n15:41.120 --> 15:49.080\ngoing to just fucking, like, you're going to me, the creator of community. That doesn't\n\n15:49.080 --> 15:56.360\ngive you pause. There's no loyalty. There's no Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker. Father, please.\n\n15:56.360 --> 16:02.440\nYour emperor is killing me. You won't pick up Inception and dump it into a fucking laser\n\n16:02.440 --> 16:10.600\npit for me in your Ewoks. That's what you are. You'll sing and dance. You don't care\n\n16:10.600 --> 16:18.600\nif your moon of indoor is taken over by the empire. I got no use for you. Just don't\n\n16:18.600 --> 16:25.480\ncook C-3PO. I haven't seen that movie in a while. I think we're going to cook C-3PO.\n\n16:25.480 --> 16:30.040\nIn soup? I don't know. He sat up and they're like, oh, he's a god. That movie fucking bite\n\n16:30.040 --> 16:37.400\na dick, too. Fucking Ewoks. You guys are almost too young. It's got to the point. When I came\n\n16:37.400 --> 16:43.640\nout to LA, I was like, if I mentioned Star Wars, oh my god. Now you're all, and this\n\n16:43.640 --> 16:49.200\nis what I love about you. You're beyond racism. You don't give a shit anymore. You don't\n\n16:49.200 --> 16:54.840\nwear watches. You don't have landlines. You don't give a fuck about George Lucas. The\n\n16:54.840 --> 17:02.840\nidea that black people can't swim is boring. It's not funny. It's not shocking. You're\n\n17:02.840 --> 17:10.520\nlike, again, with the black people, fuck you. I'm a quarter Apache. I got a Chinese guy\n\n17:10.520 --> 17:17.840\ngrowing out of the top of my head. I'm half hologram. Even if I'm Thoroughbred Eskimo,\n\n17:17.840 --> 17:21.720\nI still don't give a shit about your dumb racial humor. What are you, Don Rickles? Fuck\n\n17:21.720 --> 17:32.240\nyou. Those are the things that I love about you. But you guys should know, since you're\n\n17:32.240 --> 17:37.320\nso young and so beyond it, that Return of the Jedi movie, those Ewoks were supposed\n\n17:37.320 --> 17:40.320\nto be Chewbacca's. All right, that's it. That's all I'm going to say about it.\n\n17:40.320 --> 17:41.320\nWait, were they really?\n\n17:41.320 --> 17:44.200\nDo you imagine a planet of Chewbacca's? I know they're called Wookies.\n\n17:44.200 --> 17:46.800\nI guess I'll research this on my own time. I didn't realize that before.\n\n17:46.800 --> 17:49.000\nYeah. How badass would that have been?\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:52.520\nWait, oh, you mean originally they were little Chewbacca's. I thought you meant that.\n\n17:52.520 --> 17:58.520\nThey were going to be Wookies. Someone's muttering something. I've incited a nerd rage. It's\n\n17:58.520 --> 18:02.680\nvaluable. It's valuable. Who's muttering? Who's muttering? It's okay. What are you\n\n18:02.680 --> 18:03.680\nsaying?\n\n18:03.680 --> 18:04.680\nIt would have been like the holiday special.\n\n18:04.680 --> 18:09.640\nOh, like what? Do you think the Ewoks would have saved the holiday special? You think\n\n18:09.640 --> 18:10.640\nthat would have been... No.\n\n18:10.640 --> 18:11.640\nI just wanted to get you, man.\n\n18:11.640 --> 18:12.640\nAll right, all right. I'll buy you a drink afterwards.\n\n18:12.640 --> 18:13.640\nHe just wants to have sex with you.\n\n18:13.640 --> 18:14.640\nThank you, baby. Thank you.\n\n18:14.640 --> 18:15.640\nYou're welcome.\n\n18:15.640 --> 18:16.640\nAll right, so...\n\n18:16.640 --> 18:28.440\nWe asked you guys to ask us for relationship advice.\n\n18:28.440 --> 18:34.600\nQuestions, relationship questions. And here's the first one. Here it comes.\n\n18:34.600 --> 18:38.920\nAll right, here it comes. Along with a sound effect.\n\n18:38.920 --> 18:53.240\nThere's the relationship of Saurus descending from the Pleistocene of romance to Jesus Christ.\n\n18:53.240 --> 18:59.240\nI'm sorry. No, wait. No, it's time for a question.\n\n18:59.240 --> 19:05.720\nAll right. There's a little bit of overcompensation here. You probably... Erin's insecure about\n\n19:05.720 --> 19:12.520\nfilling in for Jeff. She brought an iPad sound board. I applaud it. I applaud effort.\n\n19:12.520 --> 19:13.520\nThank you.\n\n19:13.520 --> 19:15.520\nThat's why I love inception.\n\n19:15.520 --> 19:16.520\nAlso...\n\n19:16.520 --> 19:24.520\nBecause it tries too hard. And if you guys don't like this, then you're hypocrites.\n\n19:24.520 --> 19:28.200\nI don't want to be the inception of Girlfriend.\n\n19:28.200 --> 19:32.440\nNo, just the sound board is... It's the...\n\n19:32.440 --> 19:35.040\nIf I was a movie, what movie would I be? Girlfriend wise?\n\n19:35.040 --> 19:36.040\nCitizen Kane.\n\n19:36.040 --> 19:37.040\nAll right.\n\n19:37.040 --> 19:44.840\nJesus Christ, get out, get out, get out. Pull up. Citizen Motherfuckin' Kane.\n\n19:44.840 --> 19:48.840\nSo, with your friends and colleagues, you say you love it, but alone you hate it?\n\n19:48.840 --> 19:49.840\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n19:49.840 --> 19:50.840\nI got it.\n\n19:50.840 --> 19:51.840\nNo.\n\n19:51.840 --> 19:52.840\nThank you, Erin.\n\n19:52.840 --> 19:56.840\nOr is it Wells directing it? Some people choose to not understand it, and I say fuck\n\n19:56.840 --> 19:58.840\nyou to them. Over pie.\n\n19:58.840 --> 20:04.840\nAll right. Question number one.\n\n20:04.840 --> 20:09.840\nIt does. It makes no sense.\n\n20:09.840 --> 20:12.840\nNo, you're calling up the information.\n\n20:12.840 --> 20:14.840\nWhat?\n\n20:14.840 --> 20:22.840\nIt's the information in 1973? Why am I using a rotary phone?\n\n20:22.840 --> 20:24.840\nQuestion number one.\n\n20:24.840 --> 20:34.840\nWhat is the significance of a man-slash-woman's relationship with their cat?\n\n20:34.840 --> 20:36.840\nOh, that's important.\n\n20:36.840 --> 20:38.840\nBecause you have a very close relationship with your cat.\n\n20:38.840 --> 20:41.840\nYeah, cats are about... I would kill the music. I don't want to give notes during the show.\n\n20:41.840 --> 20:43.840\nI'm sorry. I'll stop doing the sound effects.\n\n20:43.840 --> 20:45.840\nOh, my God.\n\n20:45.840 --> 20:47.840\nI thought it was going to be a different sound.\n\n20:47.840 --> 20:51.840\nNo, it's fine. It's fine. I want to see where it's going. It's fine.\n\n20:51.840 --> 20:56.840\nWe talked about this. Your job is not to be Jeff Davis, so this is a whole new thing.\n\n20:56.840 --> 20:58.840\nShe's got an iPad full of sound effects.\n\n20:58.840 --> 21:00.840\nLet's just...\n\n21:00.840 --> 21:12.840\nGuys, it's fine. He's trying to explain something to me.\n\n21:12.840 --> 21:16.840\nWe're fine. It's part of the show.\n\n21:16.840 --> 21:22.840\nGet off the stage, audience. Stop poking Dan.\n\n21:22.840 --> 21:29.840\nI've never had to do this with 200 people at the same time, but guys, she's really cool.\n\n21:29.840 --> 21:36.840\nI swear to God.\n\n21:36.840 --> 21:38.840\nThat was the last one.\n\n21:38.840 --> 21:41.840\nDogs require discipline on behalf of humans.\n\n21:41.840 --> 21:47.840\nI don't want to use bad words like arrogance and ego. Confidence would be a better word.\n\n21:47.840 --> 21:50.840\nYou have to have your shit together to have a dog.\n\n21:50.840 --> 21:56.840\nSo if the guy or girl that you're interested in, whoever wrote this question, is a dog person\n\n21:56.840 --> 22:01.840\nand you're a cat person, then I think what you have to understand is that you might be prone\n\n22:01.840 --> 22:03.840\nto act like a little baby in the relationship.\n\n22:03.840 --> 22:07.840\nYou have to stay on your shit about that.\n\n22:07.840 --> 22:11.840\nI think cat people...to own a cat is to say,\n\n22:11.840 --> 22:14.840\nI don't want responsibility to the animal kingdom.\n\n22:14.840 --> 22:16.840\nIt doesn't mean that you're incapable of taking it on.\n\n22:16.840 --> 22:20.840\nIt's to say, I'm not ready for it yet. I don't want it yet.\n\n22:20.840 --> 22:23.840\nPeople that have dogs are gone like, you know what? I got my shit together.\n\n22:23.840 --> 22:28.840\nI want a fucking animal to walk around\n\n22:28.840 --> 22:31.840\nand I'm going to be the sunshine and rain in its life.\n\n22:31.840 --> 22:35.840\nIf I forget to look at it, it's going to have a heart attack.\n\n22:35.840 --> 22:40.840\nIf I don't tell it a pillow isn't a sandwich, it won't know.\n\n22:40.840 --> 22:44.840\nI might have to hit it. All kinds of weird shit.\n\n22:44.840 --> 22:47.840\nHey, don't. Whoa, whoa.\n\n22:47.840 --> 22:53.840\nI didn't spend 500,000 years slowly warping the genes of a wolf.\n\n22:53.840 --> 22:56.840\nDon't come crying to me.\n\n22:56.840 --> 23:00.840\nI like cats. They're brand new.\n\n23:00.840 --> 23:04.840\nEgyptians just invented them, like 1,000 years ago.\n\n23:04.840 --> 23:09.840\nBut I'm happy to make this announcement. Dan is buying a golden doodle.\n\n23:09.840 --> 23:13.840\nSee, thank you for holding your applause until you got verification from me.\n\n23:13.840 --> 23:18.840\nIt may take a little while. We researched the kind of dogs that I might get\n\n23:18.840 --> 23:21.840\nif I was going to get a dog now that I'm fired.\n\n23:21.840 --> 23:25.840\nAnd the community was my dog.\n\n23:25.840 --> 23:31.840\nIt has sadly stopped fetching my slippers\n\n23:31.840 --> 23:38.840\nand has in fact taken to pissing on my face and my sleep\n\n23:38.840 --> 23:43.840\nand having panels at Comic-Con without me.\n\n23:43.840 --> 23:45.840\nIt's you.\n\n23:45.840 --> 23:49.840\nDan, while that was happening, how did you react to that?\n\n23:49.840 --> 23:53.840\nI started cleaning my house. Just for two days, I started moving boxes around.\n\n23:53.840 --> 23:57.840\nI was muttering things like, I thought you hated nerds.\n\n23:57.840 --> 24:01.840\nAnd then I would find out I made a shelf wrong and I was kicking across\n\n24:01.840 --> 24:05.840\nand I was like, I fucking hate my fucking life.\n\n24:05.840 --> 24:10.840\nI'm a wreck. The show broke up with me. It dumped me.\n\n24:10.840 --> 24:13.840\nWhen you dump somebody, don't awe me.\n\n24:13.840 --> 24:16.840\nI don't mean don't do anything. You can do whatever you want.\n\n24:16.840 --> 24:20.840\nDon't feel sorry for me. I'm not saying these things do illicit pity.\n\n24:20.840 --> 24:23.840\nIt's a confession. I need to get this off my chest.\n\n24:23.840 --> 24:26.840\nI feel warped and bad and petty about it.\n\n24:26.840 --> 24:32.840\nOutside, I smile at people and I go, they drive by and go, toot toot, you got fired.\n\n24:32.840 --> 24:36.840\nAnd I go, good morning, Ralph.\n\n24:36.840 --> 24:39.840\nI guess they wanted to go in a different direction.\n\n24:39.840 --> 24:42.840\nJust taking out the trash.\n\n24:42.840 --> 24:47.840\nIt's my duty, you know, to keep a smile.\n\n24:47.840 --> 24:50.840\nI'm bummed out.\n\n24:50.840 --> 24:52.840\nI love my show.\n\n24:52.840 --> 24:56.840\nWhat if they took your baby? What if they came in your window and took your baby?\n\n24:56.840 --> 24:59.840\nYou'd probably just take your baby.\n\n24:59.840 --> 25:02.840\nYou'd probably start cleaning your house.\n\n25:02.840 --> 25:04.840\nWorking on your shelving units.\n\n25:04.840 --> 25:07.840\nAnd every once in a while, you'd find out that for the third time,\n\n25:07.840 --> 25:10.840\nyou had the Home Depot guy cut it a tenth of an inch too long.\n\n25:10.840 --> 25:13.840\nSo it still doesn't fit in the fucking thing.\n\n25:13.840 --> 25:15.840\nYou just erupt into things like,\n\n25:15.840 --> 25:19.840\nI'm doing a shelving unit. Why are you fucking firing me then?\n\n25:19.840 --> 25:23.840\nIn fact, I was trying to move my chair.\n\n25:23.840 --> 25:26.840\nSo I was trying to move a reclining chair.\n\n25:26.840 --> 25:28.840\nCan you just kill the music though?\n\n25:28.840 --> 25:30.840\nI'm so sorry. I can't hear it very well.\n\n25:30.840 --> 25:32.840\nI mean, I swear to God.\n\n25:32.840 --> 25:36.840\nJeff never does this.\n\n25:36.840 --> 25:38.840\nHe just, he, you know, he's very...\n\n25:38.840 --> 25:45.840\nHe also never blows you.\n\n25:45.840 --> 25:46.840\nOn the weekends.\n\n25:46.840 --> 25:49.840\nDo I tell her?\n\n25:49.840 --> 25:52.840\nWe stepped on each other's...\n\n25:52.840 --> 25:54.840\nI had a dream.\n\n25:54.840 --> 25:57.840\nThe weird thing about the 540 wake-up\n\n25:57.840 --> 25:59.840\nin the middle of a very intense anxiety dream.\n\n25:59.840 --> 26:03.840\nBut in the dream, Aaron and Jeff and I were on mushrooms.\n\n26:03.840 --> 26:06.840\nI haven't told Jeff this yet. He's out of town.\n\n26:06.840 --> 26:09.840\nAnd in the dream was such a vivid dream.\n\n26:09.840 --> 26:12.840\nAnd I was in a rage. I'm surprised I wasn't like shouting in my sleep\n\n26:12.840 --> 26:15.840\nbecause in my dream I was constantly angry and so stressed out.\n\n26:15.840 --> 26:20.840\nIn my dream, Jeff and my girlfriend and myself were on mushrooms\n\n26:20.840 --> 26:22.840\nand like hanging out and having a good time.\n\n26:22.840 --> 26:27.840\nAnd at the end of a big fun three-person mushroom trip,\n\n26:27.840 --> 26:28.840\nAaron said,\n\n26:28.840 --> 26:31.840\nGuys, you know what? This is going amazing.\n\n26:31.840 --> 26:35.840\nLike, let's just do this.\n\n26:35.840 --> 26:38.840\nLet's just, call me crazy. Let's just do it.\n\n26:38.840 --> 26:40.840\nAnd I was like, what?\n\n26:40.840 --> 26:42.840\nAnd Jeff was like, yeah, I know what she means.\n\n26:42.840 --> 26:45.840\nLet's fucking do it.\n\n26:45.840 --> 26:48.840\nWe've been thinking about it.\n\n26:48.840 --> 26:50.840\nSounds like you've been thinking about it.\n\n26:50.840 --> 26:55.840\nWell, obviously.\n\n26:55.840 --> 26:57.840\nIt's an anxiety I have.\n\n26:57.840 --> 27:01.840\nAnd I'm in the dream going, I only get to play one character.\n\n27:01.840 --> 27:07.840\nI'm going like, no, I don't want to look at my friend's dick\n\n27:07.840 --> 27:10.840\nand I don't want to watch him fuck my girlfriend\n\n27:10.840 --> 27:13.840\nand I don't want to high five them while I do it.\n\n27:13.840 --> 27:15.840\nWas it an eyeful?\n\n27:15.840 --> 27:17.840\nI could go on and on for the reasons I don't want to do this,\n\n27:17.840 --> 27:21.840\nbut I'm sorry guys. And then that's when the dream started.\n\n27:21.840 --> 27:23.840\nWhen the nightmare kicked into high gear\n\n27:23.840 --> 27:25.840\nbecause the rest of the dream, it seemed like hours,\n\n27:25.840 --> 27:28.840\nyou know, like an inception, like time slows down.\n\n27:28.840 --> 27:31.840\nSo really, you should rent it.\n\n27:31.840 --> 27:35.840\nGive it a chance, guys.\n\n27:35.840 --> 27:38.840\nSo I was awoken from that by my girlfriend going,\n\n27:38.840 --> 27:42.840\npick up the stick with the microphone.\n\n27:42.840 --> 27:44.840\nEveryone's having a great time but me.\n\n27:44.840 --> 27:47.840\nI sound like the best.\n\n27:47.840 --> 27:50.840\nReally quick, when I saw Inception in the theater,\n\n27:50.840 --> 27:52.840\nI saw with a couple friends.\n\n27:52.840 --> 27:54.840\nYou were 12.\n\n27:54.840 --> 27:56.840\nMy mom had to take me off of her breast\n\n27:56.840 --> 27:58.840\nand she showed me to the...\n\n27:58.840 --> 28:03.840\nShe held you up and said, one day you'll get this.\n\n28:03.840 --> 28:05.840\nI saw Inception at the arc light\n\n28:05.840 --> 28:09.840\nand the last shot of Inception, it's not really a spoiler,\n\n28:09.840 --> 28:11.840\nis a shot of a top turning\n\n28:11.840 --> 28:13.840\nand you don't know if it's going to fall over,\n\n28:13.840 --> 28:15.840\nwhich would mean that he's not in a dream\n\n28:15.840 --> 28:17.840\nor if it's going to keep on spinning,\n\n28:17.840 --> 28:18.840\nwhich means he is in a dream\n\n28:18.840 --> 28:20.840\nbecause he finally gets what he wants.\n\n28:20.840 --> 28:22.840\nThe credits started going up\n\n28:22.840 --> 28:24.840\nand a woman behind me said,\n\n28:24.840 --> 28:26.840\nhere we go again!\n\n28:26.840 --> 28:31.840\nA diss with a movie was about a demented top.\n\n28:31.840 --> 28:35.840\nHere we go again!\n\n28:35.840 --> 28:38.840\nAnd that woman walked out going, Inception's great.\n\n28:38.840 --> 28:41.840\nYou know, fuck you guys.\n\n28:41.840 --> 28:45.840\nAmong dummies, Erin McGathy text messages\n\n28:45.840 --> 28:48.840\nscrolling back to the night...\n\n28:48.840 --> 28:50.840\nUh-oh.\n\n28:52.840 --> 28:54.840\nI was trying to move a chair through a doorway\n\n28:54.840 --> 28:56.840\nthat was too narrow for the chair.\n\n28:58.840 --> 29:02.840\nWelcome to the most entertaining story of your life.\n\n29:02.840 --> 29:05.840\nAlso, there were buttons nearby.\n\n29:05.840 --> 29:11.840\nThe walls were creamed.\n\n29:11.840 --> 29:13.840\nGarrison Keeler in it.\n\n29:16.840 --> 29:18.840\nHow many more people are going to be in his town?\n\n29:18.840 --> 29:21.840\nArthur's chair has become an item of much recompense.\n\n29:24.840 --> 29:28.840\nThe cushioning was forgiving.\n\n29:28.840 --> 29:31.840\nSean Connery's Garrison Keeler Impressionist.\n\n29:31.840 --> 29:33.840\nIt is right on.\n\n29:33.840 --> 29:35.840\nIt is right on.\n\n29:35.840 --> 29:39.840\nMost things in Lake Wobegon don't rack all the bullets.\n\n29:42.840 --> 29:44.840\nI'd really like to not get sidetracked tonight.\n\n29:44.840 --> 29:45.840\nOkay, I'm sorry.\n\n29:45.840 --> 29:46.840\nOkay, so chair.\n\n29:46.840 --> 29:48.840\nYou're trying to move...\n\n29:48.840 --> 29:50.840\nEveryone buckle in.\n\n29:50.840 --> 29:52.840\nHe was trying to move a chair.\n\n29:52.840 --> 29:53.840\nIt's a character study.\n\n29:53.840 --> 29:54.840\nIt's funny.\n\n29:54.840 --> 29:56.840\nI was trying to move a chair through a door.\n\n29:56.840 --> 29:59.840\nThe chair, I really think I came out of the gate\n\n29:59.840 --> 30:03.840\nswinging an inception, and I think that's the moral of tonight.\n\n30:03.840 --> 30:05.840\nI really fucked myself.\n\n30:05.840 --> 30:06.840\nNo, you're doing fine.\n\n30:06.840 --> 30:08.840\nI wish I could take it back, man.\n\n30:08.840 --> 30:10.840\nI wish I could like that movie.\n\n30:10.840 --> 30:12.840\nI wish someone could incept into my head.\n\n30:14.840 --> 30:17.840\nThe idea that that movie is like Robocop.\n\n30:17.840 --> 30:23.840\nBecause it looks like a lot of skiing to me.\n\n30:23.840 --> 30:28.840\nYeah, those dreamscapes weren't very cool.\n\n30:28.840 --> 30:30.840\nDid you say dreamscape?\n\n30:30.840 --> 30:32.840\nThe original inception.\n\n30:32.840 --> 30:33.840\nThank you, sir.\n\n30:33.840 --> 30:34.840\nThank you.\n\n30:34.840 --> 30:36.840\nThey all came together.\n\n30:36.840 --> 30:38.840\nThe dreamscape club all came together.\n\n30:38.840 --> 30:40.840\nAll of my colleagues in the back.\n\n30:40.840 --> 30:42.840\nYeah, that's what it's like to have a 27-year-old girlfriend,\n\n30:42.840 --> 30:43.840\nby the way.\n\n30:43.840 --> 30:44.840\nI'm 39.\n\n30:44.840 --> 30:46.840\nI'm like, let me show you the real inception.\n\n30:46.840 --> 30:48.840\nDennis Quaid in dreamscape.\n\n30:48.840 --> 30:50.840\nAnd then he just shows me his dick.\n\n30:50.840 --> 30:52.840\nI do that all the time.\n\n30:52.840 --> 30:54.840\nLadies.\n\n30:58.840 --> 31:00.840\nBut his dick is a dream within a dream.\n\n31:00.840 --> 31:01.840\nIt's crazy.\n\n31:01.840 --> 31:02.840\nIt's crazy.\n\n31:02.840 --> 31:04.840\nI look at it, and I see myself naked in science class,\n\n31:04.840 --> 31:06.840\nand then I see myself skiing.\n\n31:08.840 --> 31:10.840\nWith dicks for poles.\n\n31:12.840 --> 31:14.840\nWith it would be really low to the ground,\n\n31:14.840 --> 31:15.840\nlike crouching.\n\n31:15.840 --> 31:18.840\nBut then the dick looks up and goes, I'm the architect.\n\n31:18.840 --> 31:20.840\nIt's my dream.\n\n31:20.840 --> 31:23.840\nThat's why the balls have different hair on them.\n\n31:23.840 --> 31:26.840\nAnd then Alan Page says, I have no reason to be here.\n\n31:26.840 --> 31:28.840\nThere's no reason for me to be here.\n\n31:28.840 --> 31:29.840\nI was in Juneau.\n\n31:29.840 --> 31:30.840\nThat's it.\n\n31:30.840 --> 31:32.840\nAnd then Joseph Gordon-Levitt says,\n\n31:32.840 --> 31:34.840\nI thought it was in a better movie than this.\n\n31:34.840 --> 31:35.840\nI did pretty good in this movie.\n\n31:35.840 --> 31:37.840\nI'm going to abuse this over-validation.\n\n31:37.840 --> 31:40.840\nAnd then Leonardo DiCaprio said, I love yachts.\n\n31:42.840 --> 31:44.840\nBecause of Titanic?\n\n31:44.840 --> 31:46.840\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n31:46.840 --> 31:49.840\nI mean, we can all agree that Leonardo DiCaprio is a bad person.\n\n31:49.840 --> 31:51.840\nI mean, there's probably somebody here.\n\n31:51.840 --> 31:52.840\nI mean, come on.\n\n31:52.840 --> 31:54.840\nHe's got to be a shitty, terrible person.\n\n31:54.840 --> 31:56.840\nHe's an okay actor.\n\n31:56.840 --> 31:57.840\nYou can see it on his face.\n\n31:57.840 --> 31:59.840\nHe's a bad person.\n\n31:59.840 --> 32:01.840\nWhen he's at charity events, deep down inside,\n\n32:01.840 --> 32:04.840\nhe's like, I don't really care if people die of cancer.\n\n32:04.840 --> 32:06.840\nI don't have a yacht.\n\n32:06.840 --> 32:08.840\nHe loves yachts.\n\n32:09.840 --> 32:10.840\nAnd models.\n\n32:10.840 --> 32:12.840\nYou can't trust people who love yachts.\n\n32:12.840 --> 32:14.840\nYachts shouldn't be around.\n\n32:14.840 --> 32:16.840\nAre you basing?\n\n32:17.840 --> 32:19.840\nWas he ever on a yacht to your knowledge?\n\n32:19.840 --> 32:21.840\nYes, he was on four yachts.\n\n32:22.840 --> 32:23.840\nAt the same time?\n\n32:26.840 --> 32:28.840\nEvery time I've seen a picture of him in a magazine,\n\n32:28.840 --> 32:31.840\nhe's with a different starlet on a yacht.\n\n32:31.840 --> 32:32.840\nReally?\n\n32:32.840 --> 32:34.840\nLike, lively on a yacht.\n\n32:34.840 --> 32:37.840\nGazelle Bunchen.\n\n32:38.840 --> 32:40.840\nYou know why I think he's on a yacht, baby?\n\n32:40.840 --> 32:42.840\nHe probably just wants to fuck you.\n\n32:42.840 --> 32:43.840\nYeah.\n\n32:43.840 --> 32:44.840\nI'm a good boy.\n\n32:44.840 --> 32:45.840\nProbably.\n\n32:45.840 --> 32:48.840\nThere's someone who's not laughing at everything I see in the back.\n\n32:48.840 --> 32:50.840\nHey, man, how can it happen?\n\n32:52.840 --> 32:53.840\nI do that too.\n\n32:53.840 --> 32:54.840\nI'm sorry, babe.\n\n32:54.840 --> 32:55.840\nI do the same thing.\n\n32:55.840 --> 32:57.840\nA lot of the fights we have are because we're the same person.\n\n32:57.840 --> 32:59.840\nYou're as dishonest and narcissistic as me.\n\n32:59.840 --> 33:03.840\nAnd I also play to whoever's not laughing.\n\n33:03.840 --> 33:04.840\nThere's always a guy.\n\n33:04.840 --> 33:05.840\nThere's always a guy.\n\n33:05.840 --> 33:07.840\nThere's a couple people who are like...\n\n33:08.840 --> 33:12.840\nI thought you were going to make up a new sitcom.\n\n33:12.840 --> 33:13.840\nFor me.\n\n33:13.840 --> 33:15.840\nI don't know what...\n\n33:15.840 --> 33:17.840\nAnd I don't blame you.\n\n33:17.840 --> 33:19.840\nIt's $10 and I'll see you after the show.\n\n33:19.840 --> 33:22.840\nHow about the male and female version of the same person\n\n33:22.840 --> 33:23.840\ntrying to do a show together?\n\n33:23.840 --> 33:25.840\nOne is dressed like his best friend\n\n33:25.840 --> 33:27.840\nand he just explained that he wanted to have a three-way\n\n33:27.840 --> 33:28.840\nwith his best friend.\n\n33:29.840 --> 33:30.840\nHow about that?\n\n33:30.840 --> 33:31.840\nAll right.\n\n33:32.840 --> 33:34.840\nSo I was trying to move a chair through a door.\n\n33:34.840 --> 33:42.840\nAnd I took off my shirt because I was sweating.\n\n33:42.840 --> 33:44.840\nAnd I'm shedding a few,\n\n33:44.840 --> 33:46.840\nbut I still look ridiculous with my shirt off.\n\n33:46.840 --> 33:47.840\nSo she came upstairs\n\n33:47.840 --> 33:49.840\nand she saw me standing over this chair\n\n33:49.840 --> 33:50.840\nthat I couldn't get through a doorway.\n\n33:50.840 --> 33:52.840\nI looked like just a bad...\n\n33:52.840 --> 33:54.840\nI was playing this game of Tetris with one piece,\n\n33:54.840 --> 33:57.840\ntrying to flip it.\n\n33:57.840 --> 34:00.840\nI just drenched in sweat and I've taken off my shirt\n\n34:00.840 --> 34:04.840\nand I look like a community theater version of Stanley Kowalski.\n\n34:06.840 --> 34:08.840\nI had tried to move the chair through the door\n\n34:08.840 --> 34:09.840\nevery conceivable way.\n\n34:09.840 --> 34:11.840\nIt's kind of shaped like a whistle, this thing.\n\n34:11.840 --> 34:13.840\nI can picture like a whistle.\n\n34:13.840 --> 34:14.840\nDo they have whistles now?\n\n34:14.840 --> 34:16.840\nAre those made to obsolete by Wi-Fi?\n\n34:16.840 --> 34:17.840\nIs there like a...\n\n34:17.840 --> 34:19.840\nDo they still wear on the football field?\n\n34:19.840 --> 34:20.840\nThey're like, no, use a laser now.\n\n34:20.840 --> 34:22.840\nYou shine it in their eyes.\n\n34:22.840 --> 34:23.840\nI don't know.\n\n34:23.840 --> 34:24.840\nI don't follow sports.\n\n34:24.840 --> 34:25.840\nMaybe the whistle...\n\n34:25.840 --> 34:26.840\nYou don't have the whistle, do you?\n\n34:26.840 --> 34:27.840\nThere's a whistle.\n\n34:27.840 --> 34:30.840\nI was trying to figure out...\n\n34:30.840 --> 34:32.840\nI put the back through the very narrow doorway.\n\n34:32.840 --> 34:33.840\nIt occurred to me.\n\n34:33.840 --> 34:37.840\nI figured out one angle and I shared this with Erin\n\n34:37.840 --> 34:39.840\nbecause I trust her and love her.\n\n34:39.840 --> 34:40.840\nThank you.\n\n34:40.840 --> 34:41.840\nThat's the end of the story.\n\n34:43.840 --> 34:44.840\nNext question.\n\n34:44.840 --> 34:46.840\nWhy are you so pretty, Erin?\n\n34:46.840 --> 34:47.840\nWeird.\n\n34:48.840 --> 34:49.840\nI don't know.\n\n34:50.840 --> 34:52.840\nThis is my spirit, my good spirit.\n\n34:52.840 --> 34:54.840\nSorry.\n\n34:57.840 --> 35:00.840\nShe actually does work as a replacement for Jeff Davis.\n\n35:01.840 --> 35:04.840\nDo you have any stories about the time you ordered milk\n\n35:04.840 --> 35:06.840\nand the chef said thank you?\n\n35:06.840 --> 35:07.840\nThank you.\n\n35:07.840 --> 35:09.840\nNo one ever orders milk like that.\n\n35:09.840 --> 35:10.840\nNo one ever orders milk like that.\n\n35:10.840 --> 35:12.840\nHow did you learn to order milk?\n\n35:13.840 --> 35:14.840\nI don't know.\n\n35:14.840 --> 35:16.840\nWere you born milk special?\n\n35:16.840 --> 35:17.840\nThank you.\n\n35:17.840 --> 35:18.840\nI guess I was.\n\n35:18.840 --> 35:19.840\nI don't know.\n\n35:19.840 --> 35:20.840\nI don't fucking care.\n\n35:20.840 --> 35:24.840\nI said I'm going to have to take the door off the hinges\n\n35:24.840 --> 35:26.840\nin order to get the chair through.\n\n35:26.840 --> 35:27.840\nIt almost makes it through.\n\n35:27.840 --> 35:28.840\nI got to take the door off the hinges.\n\n35:28.840 --> 35:30.840\nErin's immediate response.\n\n35:31.840 --> 35:32.840\nDon't do that.\n\n35:32.840 --> 35:33.840\nIt's a two-man job.\n\n35:33.840 --> 35:36.840\nHave you ever taken a door off the hinges before\n\n35:36.840 --> 35:38.840\nand tried to put it back on?\n\n35:38.840 --> 35:39.840\nIt's a two-man job.\n\n35:39.840 --> 35:41.840\nIt's harder than you think.\n\n35:41.840 --> 35:43.840\nIt screws in some wood.\n\n35:43.840 --> 35:44.840\nIt's a fucking door.\n\n35:44.840 --> 35:45.840\nIt's a door.\n\n35:45.840 --> 35:47.840\nNo, I've never, to be perfectly honest with you,\n\n35:47.840 --> 35:50.840\nI've never taken a door off the hinges and put it back on.\n\n35:50.840 --> 35:52.840\nWell, it's harder than you think.\n\n35:53.840 --> 35:54.840\nYou've taken a door off the hinges.\n\n35:54.840 --> 35:56.840\nWell, Erin, I didn't actually ask for your help.\n\n35:56.840 --> 35:59.840\nAnd even if I did, I don't think telling someone\n\n35:59.840 --> 36:01.840\nnot to do something is helping them.\n\n36:01.840 --> 36:05.840\nI find that to be very discouraging, actually.\n\n36:05.840 --> 36:07.840\nAnd you definitely said it as sweet and reasonable\n\n36:07.840 --> 36:09.840\nas you're saying it now.\n\n36:10.840 --> 36:13.840\nSo she goes, well, I'm going to go out drinking again.\n\n36:13.840 --> 36:14.840\nAgain?\n\n36:19.840 --> 36:20.840\nI said, I'm going to go out fucking.\n\n36:20.840 --> 36:21.840\nI'm going to go out fucking I guess.\n\n36:21.840 --> 36:22.840\nOh, no laugh.\n\n36:22.840 --> 36:23.840\nI'm so sorry.\n\n36:23.840 --> 36:24.840\nI didn't say that.\n\n36:24.840 --> 36:25.840\nI was going out of the karaoke.\n\n36:25.840 --> 36:26.840\nI'm so sorry.\n\n36:26.840 --> 36:27.840\nDon't pollute the story with bits\n\n36:27.840 --> 36:28.840\nbecause the truth is funnier than everything.\n\n36:28.840 --> 36:29.840\nYou're right.\n\n36:29.840 --> 36:30.840\nYou're right.\n\n36:30.840 --> 36:31.840\nYou're right.\n\n36:31.840 --> 36:32.840\nYou're right.\n\n36:32.840 --> 36:33.840\nYou're right.\n\n36:33.840 --> 36:34.840\nI want to go out and drink in the drawing room.\n\n36:34.840 --> 36:35.840\nYou left.\n\n36:35.840 --> 36:37.840\nAnd I was like, oh, fuck, it's a door.\n\n36:37.840 --> 36:38.840\nSo she's right.\n\n36:38.840 --> 36:40.840\nIt's kind of hard to take off a door by yourself\n\n36:40.840 --> 36:43.840\nunless you put a fucking thing under the door.\n\n36:43.840 --> 36:46.920\nIt's like cartoon logic.\n\n36:46.920 --> 36:47.920\nIt's like, why is it hard?\n\n36:47.920 --> 36:50.880\nOh, because the door, if you take a screw, the unscrew,\n\n36:50.880 --> 36:52.880\nit'll start to fall off the hinges.\n\n36:52.880 --> 36:55.120\nOh no, what am I gonna do?\n\n36:55.120 --> 36:57.160\nWhat am I, what am I a fucking fox?\n\n36:57.160 --> 36:58.000\nAm I a beaver?\n\n36:58.000 --> 36:59.400\nNo, I'm a primate.\n\n36:59.400 --> 37:01.480\nI think I'll go get a thing that's as high\n\n37:01.480 --> 37:03.000\nas the door comes off the ground.\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:05.240\nPut it under the door so that when it comes off the hinges,\n\n37:05.240 --> 37:06.760\nit's resting on that.\n\n37:06.760 --> 37:08.440\nTa-da!\n\n37:08.440 --> 37:10.160\nAnd I took it off its fucking hinges\n\n37:10.160 --> 37:12.080\nand I put the chair through the door\n\n37:12.080 --> 37:14.840\nand I put the door back on the hinges\n\n37:14.840 --> 37:19.080\nand I sent my drinking girlfriend two photos,\n\n37:19.080 --> 37:22.000\none of the chair in the room that it was too small,\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:23.200\nso too big to get into,\n\n37:23.200 --> 37:25.760\nand the other of the newly intact door,\n\n37:25.760 --> 37:29.600\nrehinged and ready for closing or opening.\n\n37:31.120 --> 37:35.960\nAnd I said, now, so you'll be me and I'll be you.\n\n37:35.960 --> 37:37.640\nAll right, so you be me, I'll be you.\n\n37:37.640 --> 37:40.960\nNow, it was probably a two-man job,\n\n37:40.960 --> 37:43.360\nbut you probably forgot I have the power of 10 men.\n\n37:43.360 --> 37:45.360\nAnd no idea that Tim Allen had cloned himself\n\n37:45.360 --> 37:48.360\nand there were 50, 10 Allens in there.\n\n37:55.960 --> 37:57.560\nWow, you won.\n\n37:57.560 --> 37:58.400\nAll right, let's just read in\n\n37:58.400 --> 37:59.240\nand then we'll talk about it.\n\n37:59.240 --> 38:00.080\nErin.\n\n38:00.080 --> 38:02.520\nShe's good, she's good.\n\n38:02.520 --> 38:04.000\nIt probably was a two-man job,\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:07.960\nbut you probably forgot I have the power of 10 men.\n\n38:07.960 --> 38:12.960\nThat's awesome.\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:17.600\nI'm legitimately impressed.\n\n38:17.600 --> 38:18.720\nI don't want you to be impressed.\n\n38:18.720 --> 38:19.920\nI want you to be supportive of me\n\n38:19.920 --> 38:21.600\nand in the face of adversity.\n\n38:27.040 --> 38:29.400\nOr, or I guess you could fire me\n\n38:29.400 --> 38:34.400\nand tell everyone that I did it unofficially.\n\n38:36.520 --> 38:39.720\nJesus, I'm sorry.\n\n38:39.720 --> 38:41.840\nPay attention to the punctuation.\n\n38:41.840 --> 38:42.920\nJesus, period.\n\n38:42.920 --> 38:44.440\nOkay, okay.\n\n38:44.440 --> 38:45.960\nI'm sorry, period.\n\n38:47.440 --> 38:49.120\nI love you, period.\n\n38:49.120 --> 38:49.960\nAll right.\n\n38:49.960 --> 38:52.000\nYou really did it, period.\n\n38:53.720 --> 38:54.560\nPause.\n\n38:55.560 --> 38:58.200\nSorry, I was trying to save you heartache.\n\n38:58.200 --> 39:00.440\nLesson learned, no punctuation.\n\n39:05.320 --> 39:06.680\nSo no response for a while.\n\n39:06.680 --> 39:07.760\n20 minutes later.\n\n39:09.200 --> 39:10.400\nAre you mad at me?\n\n39:11.280 --> 39:12.120\nNo.\n\n39:13.400 --> 39:14.320\nOkay.\n\n39:15.680 --> 39:16.920\nIt's not that crowded here\n\n39:16.920 --> 39:18.960\nif you want to drink exclamation points.\n\n39:19.920 --> 39:21.320\nJust me and Kimber.\n\n39:22.880 --> 39:24.320\nNo thanks.\n\n39:24.320 --> 39:25.800\nVery tired.\n\n39:25.800 --> 39:29.840\nOkay, period.\n\n39:29.840 --> 39:32.000\nYou sure you're not upset?\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:32.920\nQuestion mark?\n\n39:32.920 --> 39:34.920\nI don't have enough energy to be upset,\n\n39:34.920 --> 39:36.560\nbut I can't take away the same shame\n\n39:36.560 --> 39:38.800\nyou feel for not believing in my door powers.\n\n39:43.160 --> 39:46.320\nThat is, that is shame you are putting on yourself.\n\n39:53.480 --> 39:54.840\nDash, dash.\n\n39:54.840 --> 39:56.680\nOkay.\n\n39:56.680 --> 39:57.520\nTrue.\n\n39:58.760 --> 40:02.000\nIs it okay if Kimber stays in your guest room?\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:03.520\nThat's fine.\n\n40:03.520 --> 40:04.360\nThank you.\n\n40:07.480 --> 40:08.480\nOh, this is this morning.\n\n40:08.480 --> 40:09.480\nYeah, this is morning.\n\n40:09.480 --> 40:10.600\nUnimportant.\n\n40:10.600 --> 40:12.520\nHe left, I woke up to an empty bed,\n\n40:12.520 --> 40:13.800\nso I texted him.\n\n40:15.640 --> 40:18.680\nYou can play Minecraft in here, smile face.\n\n40:18.680 --> 40:23.600\nOh, does nobody need to hold up the stick anymore?\n\n40:23.600 --> 40:25.200\nBecause if that's why I was downstairs,\n\n40:25.200 --> 40:26.920\nI'm fucking 540 in the morning,\n\n40:26.920 --> 40:27.760\nhold up the stick.\n\n40:27.760 --> 40:30.720\nOh, fucking three-way, 11 dream bitch.\n\n40:33.280 --> 40:34.960\nI'm gonna go play a video game\n\n40:34.960 --> 40:38.960\nwhere my efforts are rewarded in a linear fashion.\n\n40:38.960 --> 40:42.080\nThat's the name of my 70s metal band,\n\n40:42.080 --> 40:43.800\nthree-way, 11 dream bitch.\n\n40:43.800 --> 40:47.120\nThat's the name of my 70s metal band, three-way, 11 dream bitch.\n\n40:50.120 --> 40:54.000\nShe's a three-way, 11 dream bitch.\n\n40:55.280 --> 40:56.520\nShe likes.\n\n40:58.840 --> 41:01.560\nAbercrombie and fish, I got her.\n\n41:01.560 --> 41:03.000\nSpeaking of which, I'm wearing this sweater\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:04.800\nto honor the fact that the air conditioning\n\n41:04.800 --> 41:05.720\nis working in this room.\n\n41:05.720 --> 41:06.880\nI'm sure you guys are.\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:10.520\nThey used to get sweltering hot in here.\n\n41:10.520 --> 41:14.360\nThe fact that I can wear a sweater up here is amazing,\n\n41:14.360 --> 41:16.120\nand we owe that to, I believe we owe that to,\n\n41:16.120 --> 41:18.440\nwell, we owe that to everybody at Meltdown Comics.\n\n41:19.640 --> 41:21.440\nThey don't have to, this place is always packed.\n\n41:21.440 --> 41:23.520\nThey can tell you to go fuck yourselves as a customer.\n\n41:23.520 --> 41:26.320\nThey have your money, they have your devotion,\n\n41:26.320 --> 41:28.520\nbut they choose to adjust the climate\n\n41:28.520 --> 41:31.120\nat the expense of thousands of dollars to them.\n\n41:31.120 --> 41:34.280\nThey want you to be happy as well as lucrative.\n\n41:35.280 --> 41:38.840\nAnd the good people at True Value, yes.\n\n41:38.840 --> 41:42.840\nTrue Value, did someone say True Value?\n\n41:44.760 --> 41:47.680\nWe make hardware stores, not slogans.\n\n41:48.720 --> 41:49.840\nTrue Value.\n\n41:52.360 --> 41:53.200\nAll right.\n\n41:53.200 --> 41:54.680\nAnd butter.\n\n41:54.680 --> 41:55.520\nI have some more.\n\n41:55.520 --> 41:57.080\nSticker than milk.\n\n41:57.080 --> 41:58.400\nAnd twice as yellow.\n\n42:02.280 --> 42:05.480\nBetter than pee since 1940, butter.\n\n42:05.480 --> 42:11.080\nJust do the, break it up, because there's people\n\n42:11.080 --> 42:13.960\nin the back who, the charisma zone is here.\n\n42:13.960 --> 42:16.840\nLike these people get splashed, it's like a SeaWorld show.\n\n42:16.840 --> 42:19.520\nThey feel the brine and the shrimp on their faces.\n\n42:19.520 --> 42:21.080\nThey're like, I fucking love whales.\n\n42:21.080 --> 42:23.920\nLike, can I get a whale hat on my way out?\n\n42:23.920 --> 42:24.960\nI love whales.\n\n42:24.960 --> 42:26.240\nIt's not in the halfway of the drive home.\n\n42:26.240 --> 42:28.080\nThey're like, what the fuck was that?\n\n42:28.080 --> 42:29.680\nWhat's a whale's pie?\n\n42:29.680 --> 42:31.120\nThe people, as you go further back,\n\n42:31.120 --> 42:31.960\nthere's people in the back who are like,\n\n42:31.960 --> 42:33.840\nwhat the fuck's going on?\n\n42:33.840 --> 42:35.600\nThat guy's just talking to his girlfriend\n\n42:35.600 --> 42:37.960\nabout fucking, whether his ass is fat\n\n42:37.960 --> 42:40.320\nand fuck these people.\n\n42:40.320 --> 42:41.160\nI didn't say that.\n\n42:41.160 --> 42:42.080\nI'd fire him too.\n\n42:43.760 --> 42:45.640\nYou don't have to keep, I guess I do that\n\n42:45.640 --> 42:47.000\nto get that reaction out.\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:51.000\nI also probably did some stuff to get fired.\n\n42:53.440 --> 42:54.800\nI'm sure I did.\n\n42:54.800 --> 42:56.640\nLike I never, ever, ever did anything\n\n42:56.640 --> 42:58.360\nthey wanted me to do.\n\n42:58.360 --> 43:00.080\nLike they always were going, they were like,\n\n43:00.080 --> 43:02.520\nhey, you should have Martin Short on the show.\n\n43:02.520 --> 43:04.960\nThey didn't get to be like the three amigos\n\n43:04.960 --> 43:06.080\nwith Chevy Chays.\n\n43:07.240 --> 43:08.080\nOkay.\n\n43:09.320 --> 43:10.440\nI'm on it.\n\n43:11.360 --> 43:12.200\nSh.\n\n43:13.480 --> 43:15.560\nSo how's the video game episode coming?\n\n43:16.640 --> 43:17.720\nThey didn't like me.\n\n43:17.720 --> 43:19.440\nI didn't listen to them.\n\n43:19.440 --> 43:20.800\nI'm not a hero for doing that.\n\n43:20.800 --> 43:22.440\nThat's childish.\n\n43:22.440 --> 43:23.920\nIf you ever have a television show,\n\n43:23.920 --> 43:25.440\nyou should clean your plate.\n\n43:25.440 --> 43:26.440\nDo your show.\n\n43:26.440 --> 43:28.800\nDo it the way that they want you to do it.\n\n43:28.800 --> 43:32.880\nOtherwise, you won't get to make a television show tomorrow.\n\n43:34.560 --> 43:35.840\nYou just be hanging out.\n\n43:38.720 --> 43:40.880\nIf you like television so much,\n\n43:42.160 --> 43:43.280\ndo it right.\n\n43:46.160 --> 43:47.000\nAll right.\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:49.880\nBut my relationship is perfect.\n\n43:49.880 --> 43:51.480\nI'm not here to give TV show advice.\n\n43:51.480 --> 43:52.960\nAre you raising your hand, sir?\n\n43:52.960 --> 43:54.360\nListen, well, this is important.\n\n43:54.360 --> 43:57.280\nWell, it's just what you just reminded me.\n\n43:57.280 --> 43:58.240\nI had heard of one point,\n\n43:58.240 --> 44:00.320\nthe video game episode was the...\n\n44:00.320 --> 44:01.160\nYeah.\n\n44:01.160 --> 44:02.800\nWas that ever the case?\n\n44:02.800 --> 44:03.640\nWait, what?\n\n44:03.640 --> 44:04.640\nThe video game episode was what?\n\n44:04.640 --> 44:08.240\nThe video game ever, the finale of last season?\n\n44:08.240 --> 44:09.600\nNo, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n44:09.600 --> 44:12.520\nIt has, he asked, was the video game episode\n\n44:12.520 --> 44:13.480\never the finale?\n\n44:13.480 --> 44:17.080\nPeople, the big fans are like the production codes\n\n44:17.080 --> 44:19.480\nof the episodes, like the numbers 320,\n\n44:19.480 --> 44:20.680\n321, 322.\n\n44:20.680 --> 44:23.200\nSometimes we shuffle episodes and those are a tip off.\n\n44:23.200 --> 44:26.360\nWe do do that, like because we do,\n\n44:26.360 --> 44:28.600\nwe do make, and it is a disservice\n\n44:28.600 --> 44:29.840\nto the continuity of the show.\n\n44:29.840 --> 44:32.920\nSometimes we're like, well, 313 is a happier episode.\n\n44:32.920 --> 44:34.480\nWe're coming back from a break or whatever.\n\n44:34.480 --> 44:36.240\nWe're like shuffle it a little bit.\n\n44:36.240 --> 44:37.920\nAnd I always tell people when we do that.\n\n44:37.920 --> 44:40.600\nAnd then on the DVD, well, I have no control right now,\n\n44:40.600 --> 44:43.240\nbut they're supposed to correct that on the DVD.\n\n44:43.240 --> 44:44.760\nIn the cases of things like that,\n\n44:44.760 --> 44:46.120\nthe production codes of the episodes,\n\n44:46.120 --> 44:48.400\nlike with the Christmas episode that was stopped animated\n\n44:48.400 --> 44:49.880\nand that video game episode,\n\n44:49.880 --> 44:53.800\nwe tend to just give it the latest production code number\n\n44:53.800 --> 44:57.320\nbecause why, I'm not necessarily sure\n\n44:57.320 --> 44:58.880\nit has something to do with just giving it,\n\n44:58.880 --> 44:59.800\nlike, because it's like,\n\n44:59.800 --> 45:01.800\nthat's a post-productive intensive episode.\n\n45:01.800 --> 45:02.840\nWe're gonna get to that.\n\n45:02.840 --> 45:04.960\nThat'll be the last one that we finish producing.\n\n45:04.960 --> 45:07.560\nLet's just call it 322, for instance.\n\n45:07.560 --> 45:09.800\nAnd then the other one, so it was never,\n\n45:09.800 --> 45:13.480\nthere was never, I would never do a finale\n\n45:13.480 --> 45:15.360\nlike with just them playing video games.\n\n45:15.360 --> 45:17.280\nI would do it with a guy going in a cardboard box\n\n45:17.280 --> 45:19.160\nand just turning it into a flash of light.\n\n45:19.160 --> 45:21.840\nBecause I'm a genius.\n\n45:23.520 --> 45:28.440\nAnyway, so, very odd of you to just blurt out that question,\n\n45:28.440 --> 45:32.400\nbut no, there's no problem with it, that's fine.\n\n45:32.400 --> 45:34.560\nIt didn't turn into a rape or anything.\n\n45:34.560 --> 45:39.240\nIt's alarming to people when someone does that\n\n45:39.240 --> 45:40.520\nbecause it's possible then\n\n45:40.520 --> 45:42.400\nthat you could just start raping people\n\n45:42.400 --> 45:44.760\nand no one would be able to do anything about it.\n\n45:44.760 --> 45:48.640\nSo the whole feeling of social order kind of collapses.\n\n45:48.640 --> 45:51.080\nThere's 200 people, if you all just charged me,\n\n45:51.080 --> 45:53.000\nyou could kill me.\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:55.160\nIf you all just started talking or eating peanuts,\n\n45:55.160 --> 45:56.880\neven if you all ate peanuts in unison,\n\n45:56.880 --> 45:59.720\nthat would be a form of, absolutely, it would overpower me\n\n45:59.720 --> 46:01.840\nand I would, you wouldn't be able to hear me.\n\n46:01.840 --> 46:02.680\nAlso understand it.\n\n46:02.680 --> 46:03.520\nYou have all the power.\n\n46:03.520 --> 46:06.560\nSo, with apartheid, I need you to not know that.\n\n46:07.680 --> 46:09.760\nI need to delay that realization\n\n46:09.760 --> 46:11.560\nthat you guys are in charge.\n\n46:12.480 --> 46:13.880\nWhat were we talking about?\n\n46:16.080 --> 46:17.360\nWe're going on to our next

46:36.600\nI'm gonna say, well, I'm gonna say no\n\n46:36.600 --> 46:39.120\nbecause the definition of love is,\n\n46:39.120 --> 46:44.120\nI believe that people who end up happy together forever,\n\n46:44.400 --> 46:46.480\nyou can trickle back and find out\n\n46:46.480 --> 46:48.240\nthat they, when they saw each other,\n\n46:48.240 --> 46:50.840\nthey were into each other at an intense level,\n\n46:50.840 --> 46:52.720\nunshared by any previous relationship.\n\n46:52.720 --> 46:55.120\nBut that might be coincidence,\n\n46:55.120 --> 46:58.280\nbecause I think that love is,

just as happy as a podcast producer.\n\n54:32.080 --> 54:33.120\nCause like, oh, there's an edit point.\n\n54:33.120 --> 54:34.640\nWe can pretend the show ended there.\n\n54:34.640 --> 54:38.440\nI'm in the middle of an interview.\n\n54:38.440 --> 54:40.400\nTiffany, how, how old are you when you,\n\n54:40.400 --> 54:43.000\nhow old were you guys when you first started dating?\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:45.200\nWe were 16 and now we're 24.\n\n54:45.200 --> 54:46.040\nWhoa.\n\n54:46.040 --> 54:48.760\nHow old were you guys when you moved in together?\n\n54:48.760 --> 54:52.560\nUm, in 19, 19.\n\n54:52.560 --> 54:54.200\nOkay. In 19, 19.\n\n54:54.200 --> 54:55.720\nNo, no, I got it.\n\n54:55.720 --> 54:56.560\nI'm sorry.\n\n54:56.560 --> 54:57.400\nThat was me being-\n\n54:57.400 --> 54:58.520\nI was trying to think of it.\n\n54:58.520 --> 54:59.360\nNo, you got it.\n\n54:59.360 --> 55:00.200\nWe were 18 years old.\n\n55:00.200 --> 55:01.040\nYou're great.\n\n55:01.040 --> 55:02.400\nI would like to be your friend.\n\n55:02.400 --> 55:06.560\nUm, I, we, we change.\n\n55:06.560 --> 55:08.480\nI would say no matter what happens,\n\n55:08.480 --> 55:11.480\nwe all change so much from 16 to 24.\n\n55:11.480 --> 55:12.600\nWe turn into different people.\n\n55:12.600 --> 55:14.080\nWe become different people.\n\n55:14.080 --> 55:15.040\nSo no matter what happened,\n\n55:15.040 --> 55:17.840\nthere, there are no heroes or villains.\n\n55:17.840 --> 55:18.800\nAs Dan told me once,\n\n55:18.800 --> 55:20.360\nthere's no good or bad and love.\n\n55:20.360 --> 55:22.360\nThere's just honest and dishonest.\n\n55:22.360 --> 55:24.000\nSo let's get them up here.\n\n55:25.680 --> 55:26.520\nCan we do that?\n\n55:26.520 --> 55:27.520\nHe doesn't want to come up here.\n\n55:27.520 --> 55:28.360\nI'm so sorry.\n\n55:28.360 --> 55:29.920\nIs he willing to come up or is he-\n\n55:29.920 --> 55:30.760\nNo, don't.\n\n55:30.760 --> 55:31.800\nOkay. No, don't make him.\n\n55:31.800 --> 55:32.640\nThat's the-\n\n55:32.640 --> 55:33.480\nNo, that's it.\n\n55:33.480 --> 55:35.760\nThe, uh, but it's, it's, it's-\n\n55:35.760 --> 55:38.120\nI mean, come up if you want to come up.\n\n55:38.120 --> 55:41.080\nDon't have me telling you to do things I don't care.\n\n55:44.080 --> 55:45.280\nMen are like-\n\n55:45.280 --> 55:47.120\nWe get invites to your imaginary wedding.\n\n55:47.120 --> 55:48.160\nThey're rubber bands.\n\n55:48.160 --> 55:51.160\nMen, men pull back when they feel like\n\n55:51.160 --> 55:54.480\nthere's a risk of them being emasculated\n\n55:54.480 --> 55:56.080\nor confined, constricted.\n\n55:56.080 --> 55:59.680\nMen, men have this like tendency according to this book.\n\n55:59.680 --> 56:00.520\nI'll trust this guy.\n\n56:00.520 --> 56:03.480\nHe sounds like he's eating a ton of pussy.\n\n56:03.480 --> 56:06.480\nIf you, if you ever heard his voice on tape,\n\n56:06.480 --> 56:09.440\nhe just sounds the most masculine guy in the world.\n\n56:11.920 --> 56:14.160\nBut, but he says something that kind of resonated with me.\n\n56:14.160 --> 56:16.120\nIt's like, yeah, women go up and down.\n\n56:16.120 --> 56:17.840\nWhat's the most frequent conversation?\n\n56:17.840 --> 56:19.880\nWhat's the most frequent ending to every argument\n\n56:19.880 --> 56:21.800\nthat men and women have?\n\n56:21.800 --> 56:24.640\nIt's, uh, I didn't want, with a woman saying,\n\n56:24.640 --> 56:27.400\nI didn't want you to do anything about it.\n\n56:27.400 --> 56:30.880\nI just wanted you to like support me.\n\n56:30.880 --> 56:33.200\nAnd the man going, I don't understand what the fuck you're-\n\n56:33.200 --> 56:36.400\nWasn't that you with the door to her?\n\n56:36.400 --> 56:38.120\nYeah, well, that's a, look.\n\n56:38.120 --> 56:43.120\nUh, all right, back on Team Women.\n\n56:43.120 --> 56:47.600\nWe welcome you back on behalf of all the ladies.\n\n56:47.600 --> 56:50.160\nI told her, I told her, Mariam,\n\n56:50.160 --> 56:51.160\nyou've been together eight years.\n\n56:51.160 --> 56:53.400\nThat was before the 16th thing that you have,\n\n56:53.400 --> 56:55.000\nyou adjust for inflation there.\n\n56:55.000 --> 56:58.360\nSix, 16 to 20 doesn't count,\n\n56:58.360 --> 57:00.720\nbut that doesn't mean that your relationship doesn't count.\n\n57:00.720 --> 57:02.680\nThat's still a four year relationship.\n\n57:02.680 --> 57:04.480\nI don't, not good at math.\n\n57:05.720 --> 57:08.240\nI have never gone more than three years.\n\n57:08.240 --> 57:09.440\nAnd at the end of three years,\n\n57:09.440 --> 57:12.200\nlike a relationship to last a certain length,\n\n57:12.200 --> 57:14.160\nlike there's a, I'm a behaviorist,\n\n57:14.160 --> 57:17.920\nnot a, I think that if people are together,\n\n57:17.920 --> 57:19.680\nthen it says that they want to be together.\n\n57:19.680 --> 57:21.880\nAnd if in that relationship they're fighting,\n\n57:21.880 --> 57:24.920\nthen it says that both of them are kind of like\n\n57:24.920 --> 57:27.160\ncommitting to this like opera where you fight,\n\n57:27.160 --> 57:28.920\nand that's a definition of relationship.\n\n57:28.920 --> 57:32.000\nAnd like, if you, if he's going like,\n\n57:32.000 --> 57:34.880\nI'm gonna go down to my boxers and like disappear\n\n57:34.880 --> 57:37.000\nand hide in the closet and play on my laptop.\n\n57:37.000 --> 57:39.120\nAnd God knows what, and you're going like,\n\n57:39.120 --> 57:40.840\nI don't know, I just want, you know,\n\n57:40.840 --> 57:45.080\nI say, take your hands off the wheel,\n\n57:45.080 --> 57:46.200\nand if the car goes in the ditch,\n\n57:46.200 --> 57:47.640\nyou're not going to die because it's not a car,\n\n57:47.640 --> 57:48.480\nit's a relationship.\n\n57:48.480 --> 57:51.200\nI, I would say,\n\n57:51.200 --> 57:52.040\nGood analogy.\n\n57:52.040 --> 57:53.760\nThat's my advice to everyone here\n\n57:53.760 --> 57:55.200\nfor every problem that you have.\n\n57:55.200 --> 57:56.160\nI guess we could, yeah.\n\n57:56.160 --> 57:57.880\nI would say, I would say no matter what,\n\n57:57.880 --> 58:00.200\nand I hope this isn't a catalyst for like a,\n\n58:00.200 --> 58:01.760\nlike a big conversation you have.\n\n58:01.760 --> 58:02.760\nYou're going to have a huge fight.\n\n58:02.760 --> 58:03.600\nYou're just trying to be really careful.\n\n58:03.600 --> 58:04.640\nI know, I know, but I just,\n\n58:04.640 --> 58:08.360\nI just want to say that like we are culture values,\n\n58:08.360 --> 58:10.600\nlove and commitment so much, and that's important,\n\n58:10.600 --> 58:12.320\nbut like no matter what happens,\n\n58:12.320 --> 58:14.280\nthat means something that you guys were together\n\n58:14.280 --> 58:15.120\nfor so long.\n\n58:15.120 --> 58:15.960\nThat's meaningful.\n\n58:15.960 --> 58:17.800\nAnd like I had early relationships,\n\n58:17.800 --> 58:21.560\nand I bet with non-geniuses.\n\n58:21.560 --> 58:26.560\nThose relationships that you have are important,\n\n58:29.520 --> 58:30.920\nand if something was to happen,\n\n58:30.920 --> 58:33.880\nand you guys were to go on different paths,\n\n58:33.880 --> 58:36.160\nit doesn't negate what you had already,\n\n58:36.160 --> 58:37.360\nand you could still love each other,\n\n58:37.360 --> 58:39.880\neven if you want different things.\n\n58:39.880 --> 58:41.920\nI mean, you may call him from time to time,\n\n58:41.920 --> 58:42.760\njust ask him if he wants to fuck you with a drawing.\n\n58:42.760 --> 58:44.640\nJesus Christ, he's trying to break up with her,\n\n58:44.640 --> 58:47.280\nlike right in front of him.\n\n58:47.280 --> 58:50.160\nThis is why women drive me nuts, we're done.\n\n58:51.320 --> 58:52.800\nAm I, what, I'm siding with a guy,\n\n58:52.800 --> 58:53.640\nbecause he's a guy?\n\n58:53.640 --> 58:55.120\nI hate myself.\n\n58:55.120 --> 58:57.800\nNo, it's fine, there's no, there's no, there's no side.\n\n58:57.800 --> 59:00.760\nTiffany, I will say you are in for a world of shit\n\n59:00.760 --> 59:02.720\nwhen you go back to your seat.\n\n59:02.720 --> 59:04.480\nYeah, yeah, I think so.\n\n59:04.480 --> 59:06.320\nAll right, well, thanks, Tiffany, for being here.\n\n59:06.320 --> 59:07.160\nIt's here for Tiffany.\n\n59:07.160 --> 59:10.640\nAnd a relationship for us, for our paltry.\n\n59:12.640 --> 59:14.600\nOoh, this is a good question.\n\n59:14.600 --> 59:16.960\nWe didn't commit any crimes just now\n\n59:16.960 --> 59:19.440\nthat numerous reality shows don't commit.\n\n59:19.440 --> 59:20.480\nLike, there was that reality show\n\n59:20.480 --> 59:22.320\nthat basically murdered Corey Hame,\n\n59:22.320 --> 59:25.200\njust for, you know, I don't think that.\n\n59:25.200 --> 59:27.760\nThe hilarious of you, we're on drugs in the house,\n\n59:27.760 --> 59:29.400\nlike one more drugs, and he's dead,\n\n59:29.400 --> 59:31.040\nand they're like, well, I guess that show's canceled.\n\n59:31.040 --> 59:34.600\nNo, I don't want anyone to break up,\n\n59:34.600 --> 59:37.240\nI just, I want people to not feel guilty\n\n59:37.240 --> 59:38.480\nfor their paths changing,\n\n59:38.480 --> 59:41.320\nor to not value their previous relationships.\n\n59:41.320 --> 59:43.120\nRight, but she didn't, her question wasn't,\n\n59:43.120 --> 59:46.520\nand I don't want to fight with you, but, again.\n\n59:46.520 --> 59:49.320\nBut her question wasn't, what do I do\n\n59:49.320 --> 59:50.640\nabout the fact that our past changed?\n\n59:50.640 --> 59:52.680\nBut there's a reason why you ask a question,\n\n59:52.680 --> 59:54.520\nlike if I put in like, well, not.\n\n59:54.520 --> 59:55.920\nI fucking hate you so much.\n\n59:55.920 --> 01:00:00.280\nI just, like, I just, we'll have it out in the car.\n\n01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:05.280\nWow, I turned into, let's try it, let's see what happens.\n\n01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:07.560\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:11.640\nAll right, Dan Harmon, a relationship expert,\n\n01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:15.240\nhow do I get out of the friend zone?\n\n01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.080\nHow do I?\n\n01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.200\nOh, you know, the friend zone.\n\n01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:22.160\nI run it into the ground, fucking, like, tell her,\n\n01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.160\nI'm assuming this is a dude.\n\n01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:29.120\nThere is such a thing as a girl\n\n01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.080\nthat ends up in the friend zone, but, ugh.\n\n01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:35.160\nThere's wispy mustache sweat on this,\n\n01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:38.560\nso I believe it is, I believe it is a dude.\n\n01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:41.480\nThere is, there is a, every once in a while,\n\n01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:43.800\na canvas wants to know how to treat a paintbrush,\n\n01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:46.840\nbut, yeah, it's probably a guy asking\n\n01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.760\nhow to get out of the friend zone.\n\n01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.000\nIt happens, sometimes you paint by going like this\n\n01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:51.960\nwith an easel.\n\n01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:56.960\nUh, the answer, we were in the friend zone.\n\n01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.720\nYou already know the answer to that question.\n\n01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:06.720\nYou tell her how you feel because she will run\n\n01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:11.320\nlike you're a fucking atom bomb, like you,\n\n01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:13.560\nand be honest with yourself about whether you can\n\n01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:17.360\nstand hanging out with her when sex is off the table.\n\n01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.840\nThe friend zone thing is like a sticking point with me\n\n01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:23.480\nbecause I had that issue with you.\n\n01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.000\nOh, that's what you said.\n\n01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.500\nYou and I were the, yeah, I fucking, I wanted to die.\n\n01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:33.880\nI thinly tolerated it, but I said to you,\n\n01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.720\nI demanded to know what this really meant,\n\n01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.280\nthis platonic relationship.\n\n01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:40.360\nDid it mean that you had other irons in the fire?\n\n01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:41.480\nIs that what that means?\n\n01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:42.920\nDoes it you and me, hang on.\n\n01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:46.600\nThe idea that you not being ready for a relationship,\n\n01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:51.600\ndoes that mean that you're not ready for a relationship\n\n01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.560\nwith like seven dudes at the same time?\n\n01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.560\nOr does that mean that you really like me?\n\n01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:00.720\nBut I, that's not really the point because it's her,\n\n01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:01.840\nhow she responds is up to her.\n\n01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.000\nBut there were reasons, right.\n\n01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.400\nLike it wasn't, it wasn't a normal shitty girl situation.\n\n01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.600\nThere were reasons behind it.\n\n01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.760\nThe thing with it, the thing that a guy has to do\n\n01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:12.560\nto protect himself from that is to always just like,\n\n01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:17.480\nas uncharismatic and as like, we're encouraged as guys,\n\n01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:19.560\nwe go, women always call us liars.\n\n01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:21.360\nThey always go like, oh, guys are pigs,\n\n01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.920\nyou're liars and all this stuff.\n\n01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:26.360\nGuys are, we are pigs, dogs, whatever that animal,\n\n01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:27.960\nwhatever animal metaphor you want to use,\n\n01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.160\nbut we're simple.\n\n01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.800\nWe are capable of just being honest and blunt\n\n01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.160\nabout what it is we want.\n\n01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.280\nAnd we kind of like get trained over time,\n\n01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.600\nprobably justifiably, to have a little bit of\n\n01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:42.600\ngrace about it, but that can slide into lying\n\n01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:49.560\nand deceiving and like playing some weird game.\n\n01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.040\nAnd then on the other side, there are honest women\n\n01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:56.080\nwho are cool with that and will say to guys like,\n\n01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:59.160\nI think you might, you say you want to be platonic friends,\n\n01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:02.400\nbut I feel like this is more than that.\n\n01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.960\nI just want to make sure you understand, right?\n\n01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:06.600\nOkay, communication works.\n\n01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.760\nBut then there are as many dishonest women\n\n01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.760\nas there are dishonest men, and so what happens\n\n01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.720\nis there's a guy on one side going like,\n\n01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:15.000\nI'm in it for the long con.\n\n01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.040\nI'm going to sneak in the back door.\n\n01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:21.280\nShe's with Richard right now, but I'm there when she cries.\n\n01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.680\nI've got her umbrella.\n\n01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.680\nI love umbrellas.\n\n01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:29.080\nTo put under her eyes for her cheeks?\n\n01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.160\nSomething like that.\n\n01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.440\nWho's this talking to me?\n\n01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.680\nIs it God?\n\n01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:36.760\nThis is God, Jerry.\n\n01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.600\nOh God, keep it down, will you?\n\n01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:42.160\nJerry, Jerry, I want to talk to you.\n\n01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:44.000\nI'm just talking to myself, the audience,\n\n01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.800\nShakespearean character, sometimes they talk outward\n\n01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:48.120\nto share their thoughts and feelings.\n\n01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:48.960\nYeah, yeah, I hear you.\n\n01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.200\nIt's not necessarily an invitation\n\n01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:51.640\nto a fucking full dialogue.\n\n01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:54.720\nI'm just a guy trying to get laid.\n\n01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:57.240\nJerry, first of all, I love your burlap pants.\n\n01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:03.800\nSecond of all, sometimes everybody, women and men,\n\n01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:07.040\nmen and men go through different stages of insecurity.\n\n01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:07.880\nOh God.\n\n01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.560\nHow'd you make such an exciting world?\n\n01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:21.000\nAre you the same God that invented flamingos?\n\n01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.680\nYou're just dragging me down.\n\n01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:24.520\nOh yeah, that was me.\n\n01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.480\nI was in a good mood.\n\n01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:28.400\nI created the flamingo and the platypus.\n\n01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.440\nWhat can I do to get you back in that mood?\n\n01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:33.760\nI'm looking for more of a flamingo God,\n\n01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.920\nless of a Judd Hirsch from Taxi God.\n\n01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.080\nJerry, I talked to very few people.\n\n01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:40.520\nYou're wasting your God time.\n\n01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.360\nPoint taken, finish up.\n\n01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:50.840\nJerry, women and men, when they're first starting today,\n\n01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:52.400\nthey're sometimes insecure.\n\n01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.160\nSo I think that sometimes nice guys,\n\n01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.800\nwhen they're younger, when they're teenagers\n\n01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.880\nand are in their early 20s and they approach women\n\n01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.760\nand they're like, I just wanna be friends,\n\n01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:02.640\nit's hard when you're insecure\n\n01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.400\nto accept that somebody likes you.\n\n01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.680\nSo then when women get older,\n\n01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:10.160\nthat insecurity thing kind of changes a little bit.\n\n01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.280\nSo with that friend thing,\n\n01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:15.040\nlike maybe it's more about her than it is about you\n\n01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:19.640\nand you should probably go bark up a different tree\n\n01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:20.680\nor become a rock star.\n\n01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:21.840\nAll right, what are you saying?\n\n01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:23.920\nLike take your God mask off, Erin.\n\n01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.400\nIt was me the whole time.\n\n01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.680\nIt was me, Dan, the whole time.\n\n01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.400\nWhat the fuck are you talking about?\n\n01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:31.240\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.520\nYou're saying that some of the situations\n\n01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:34.360\nwhere men are-\n\n01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.440\nI guess if it's friends over then,\n\n01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.320\nthe friends over person, if you're comfortable,\n\n01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:39.840\nif you could just scream at your age really quick.\n\n01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:42.160\nIf you're gonna-\n\n01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:44.880\nOh, the guy who, well yeah, he doesn't wanna,\n\n01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.720\nhe doesn't, he's sitting with the chick\n\n01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.880\nthat he's in the friend zone with.\n\n01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:49.720\nShe thinks that he's awesome.\n\n01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:50.760\nAnd she's like, thank you so much\n\n01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:52.760\nfor giving me a ride to Alex's house.\n\n01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:53.600\nI appreciate it.\n\n01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.880\nHe's three years into a nine year jackpot.\n\n01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:57.840\nI was saying like, I was-\n\n01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.640\nHe's not gonna fuck it up for us.\n\n01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:02.200\nHe's not like Tiffany and Zorro,\n\n01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:03.040\nwhoever she can be.\n\n01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:05.760\nI'm speaking a Zorro.\n\n01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.160\nWell, I assume he's Zorro.\n\n01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:10.200\nHe fucking gets away with murder with her.\n\n01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.600\nWe don't, the friend zone, don't get in it.\n\n01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:14.920\nThat's the only advice we can give.\n\n01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:16.640\nIt's like saying, how do I get out of quicksand?\n\n01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:17.480\nYou can't murder your dad.\n\n01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:19.320\nWell, I just wanna say it's more-\n\n01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:21.320\nDon't ever, when you see it, step around it.\n\n01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.440\nI would say, I would say-\n\n01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:24.280\nWhere's no shoes?\n\n01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.920\nThe board, I would say across the board.\n\n01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.280\nAnd I think ladies will agree with me.\n\n01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:30.800\nIf your intentions are romantic, fucking own that.\n\n01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:33.720\nDon't be like, hey, like, yeah, this isn't a date.\n\n01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:36.240\nI mean, if I can just drive you to coffee or whatever.\n\n01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.920\nAnd then all of a sudden, say like,\n\n01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:40.440\nby the way, I'm gonna look at pussy.\n\n01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.480\nLike that's the worst.\n\n01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.520\nThat's dishonest.\n\n01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:48.200\nIf you, my friends are like shaking their heads.\n\n01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.680\nSo don't do that.\n\n01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.760\nWell, I'm just saying like, if you're interested in somebody,\n\n01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:55.960\nfirst look Jerry in the mirror and say,\n\n01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:59.200\nJerry, you're cool because you're smart.\n\n01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.920\nYou made these burlap pants.\n\n01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.080\nNo one wears burlap pants.\n\n01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.400\nAnd then when you see a girl that you like,\n\n01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:06.240\ngo up to her.\n\n01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.680\nHey, hey, oh, what's your name?\n\n01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:10.880\nMy name is Angela.\n\n01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:13.200\nHey, Angela, I think you're real beautiful.\n\n01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.680\nIf I could buy you a drink sometime, I would love that.\n\n01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.040\nOh, thank you.\n\n01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.280\nDon't do, it doesn't always work.\n\n01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:24.280\nBut it's more likely to get you laid than the alternative,\n\n01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:27.600\nwhich is like, hey, hey, my name is Jerry.\n\n01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.080\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:29.920\nAngela?\n\n01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:33.360\nCool, cool, doing a bring your standup show.\n\n01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:34.840\nA lot of friends are coming.\n\n01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:36.400\nIt's not a date.\n\n01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.760\nNot a date.\n\n01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.520\nYeah, if you want to come, that'd be great.\n\n01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:40.960\nI'll be Facebooking you later.\n\n01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.360\nSo we agree on something.\n\n01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:45.640\nThat I agree, yeah, ask women out.\n\n01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:47.560\nLike that's a great way to avoid,\n\n01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:49.280\nlike ask them out to dinner.\n\n01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:53.160\nSay, let's watch Breaking Bad together.\n\n01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.560\nI don't, like, tell them basically,\n\n01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.080\nI'm interested in you.\n\n01:07:58.080 --> 01:07:59.000\nWell, that's where I,\n\n01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.040\nWell, and that's what you did.\n\n01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:03.360\nYeah, well, at first I said,\n\n01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:06.600\nplatonic drinks, I did that once, that's my limit.\n\n01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:08.320\nI said, hey, platonic drinks, right?\n\n01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.320\nYep, okay, how can you turn that down?\n\n01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.720\nCause you'd be a monster, that's my bear trap.\n\n01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:13.560\nPsh.\n\n01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:18.280\nThat's the friend zone working for you.\n\n01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:20.640\nThen after platonic drinks, you go,\n\n01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:23.120\nguess what, someone's interested in something\n\n01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.800\na little bit more happy.\n\n01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:28.160\nAnd then they tell you yes or no.\n\n01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:30.480\nThe difficult thing is not being afraid of the no.\n\n01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:31.440\nThat's the horrible thing.\n\n01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:32.840\nCause you feel like if they say no,\n\n01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:36.320\nthen your balls fall off and a fish hook grabs you\n\n01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:39.840\nand you, it turns out you lived in a pond your whole life\n\n01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:42.560\nand that someone gets to eat you if women don't like you.\n\n01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:43.960\nAll right, we're going to do,\n\n01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:45.840\nwelcome to the rapid fire round.\n\n01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:49.520\nWe're, this is the part of
