00:00.000 --> 00:22.840
Hello gang, from the Dynasty Typewriter at the Hayworth whatever the theater is called

00:22.840 --> 00:35.360
down here, MacArthur Park, Los Angeles, Harmontown is now in session, Episode 301.

00:35.360 --> 00:39.760
Oh shit, is my voice back? I just got loud for no reason. Let's bring out the Game Master

00:39.760 --> 00:55.520
Extraordinaire, Spencer Crittenden everybody. He's all in brown, he's down to clown. What's

00:55.520 --> 01:01.280
in that little lunchbox baby? What is this? Treasures. You got secret treasures in there?

01:01.280 --> 01:07.520
What? You got secret treasures in there? Yeah, I got secret treasures. Can I know your secret?

01:07.520 --> 01:17.200
No. We'll find out. Fantastic. I feel like I have to yell. Well, let's not. Let's stop. How

01:17.200 --> 01:20.280
about this? Yeah, you and I can stop yelling and we can bring out the Mayor of Harmontown.

01:20.280 --> 01:38.560
Who? Dan Harmon. Yo, I got a little baby backpack. I got a little baby backpack. I'm back and packing

01:38.560 --> 01:46.960
where it's back at. A millennial backpack. A little tiny thing the size of a wallet hanging on my back.

01:46.960 --> 01:58.040
What are you calling? A little baby tiny backpack. It proves I'm 19. I only got so much shit, so why

01:58.040 --> 02:09.560
would I have a bigger backpack than it? I just have room for my ecstasy. And your phone. I got a

02:09.560 --> 02:18.960
little tiny backpack. It's a Rick and Morty little tiny backpack. And I see like in proper

02:18.960 --> 02:25.600
like, like millennial style, you kept the tags on it to prove that it's, you know. Well, I wanted to

02:25.600 --> 02:28.720
keep it in kind of mint condition because I thought I'd give it away to an audience member tonight.

02:28.720 --> 02:37.680
Are you saying that somebody here at the Dynasty Typeway is going to go home with a tiny wallet

02:37.680 --> 02:47.920
outside a millennial backpack? You thought all you were going to get. There's an impressive, it's a

02:47.920 --> 02:54.000
whole mosaic of Rick and Morty scenes and things. It was in my office on the pile of this merch every

02:54.000 --> 02:58.840
day comes in. Here's the toothbrush, here's the watch, here's the thing. And there's a little tiny

02:58.840 --> 03:05.160
backpack. I brought it home to Cody. She said, I'm a little old for a little tiny backpack. Why don't

03:05.160 --> 03:12.640
you take it to the show and give it away to somebody. So I will. And you have worn it. I saw it. So you

03:12.640 --> 03:27.760
can sell it. You'll be able to say it was worn by Dan Harmon. Okay, so what's going on? I mentioned,

03:27.760 --> 03:33.880
we were just talking, you said you liked the Ant-Man and the Wasp. Yeah, the new Ant-Man movie.

03:33.880 --> 03:40.200
Haven't seen it. Good for our friend Chris McKenna of the community, the beating heart of

03:40.200 --> 03:45.760
community. I think he's heavily involved in that Ant-Man business. So it's good to hear that that's

03:45.760 --> 03:51.520
good. I really like Deadpool 2. I think I mentioned that again. I thought Deadpool 2 was awesome. Why

03:51.520 --> 03:57.280
do you like it? I don't know. Maybe it's a sad state of movies these days, but it's just when

03:57.280 --> 04:04.280
you're shocked that something like lands. That's why I like all the Marvel movies. It's just like,

04:04.280 --> 04:12.080
I like superheroes and this is a movie. Yeah. This didn't kick me in the face. Yeah. I mean,

04:12.080 --> 04:16.040
overall, I won't be lying. I'm 45 years old. I think I'm allowed to say, I don't really care

04:16.040 --> 04:25.960
about your Marvels. Sure. You're a spider. I get it. You climb walls. You're still climbing them.

04:25.960 --> 04:30.440
There's been like nine actors playing. It's a kid. I know. I know you can climb walls. I don't

04:30.440 --> 04:36.720
care anymore. I also don't know what I care about. I mean, don't go to me for what you should be

04:36.720 --> 04:43.000
watching. My taste buds are dying. So is my soul. I sit in bed and I'm living either the best life

04:43.000 --> 04:49.080
or the worst life. I listen to podcasts about people being murdered and I play Minecraft. I'm

04:49.080 --> 04:56.760
slowly rotting away with a big smile on my face. So if I was 19, it'd probably be a great time

04:56.760 --> 05:04.360
to care about the spider people. What's he doing on that wall? Walls are for stopping you from

05:04.360 --> 05:09.960
walking. He's walking up it. Holy shit. What kind of guy is he? He's a spider guy. Okay. If you're

05:09.960 --> 05:15.120
19, you're probably like, Jesus Christ, this is my diehard. Yeah, man. I don't know. I don't know

05:15.120 --> 05:19.760
from kids. I don't know what you care about. It should be called spider guy, not spider man. He

05:19.760 --> 05:26.200
was young. He was a kid. It should be called spider dude or spider. Spider dude is something. Now,

05:26.200 --> 05:32.800
spider child I don't like. What's the movie with the little girl with the purple wig and she kicks

05:32.800 --> 05:43.400
everybody's ass? Spider child. Huh? Spider child. Kick ass. Kick ass. Okay. Right. It's a movie about

05:43.400 --> 05:48.840
a girl just kicking everybody's dick around the room for fucking two hours, right? I guess so,

05:48.840 --> 06:05.040
yeah. I don't get out that much, but I promise you that the controversy over the e-scooters is

06:05.040 --> 06:12.600
definitely manufactured. Thank you. I see it as nothing but a boon. I have never been troubled

06:12.600 --> 06:19.920
by a person riding around on a scooter that they rented with an app. I've seen them. I've puzzled

06:19.920 --> 06:26.800
at them and then someone's explained them to me and my only thought was this is fantastic. It'll

06:26.800 --> 06:32.880
probably take me years to muster the courage to walk up to one and be like, so what do I do? It's

06:32.880 --> 06:40.800
real fun. But like, have you read one? Oh, yeah. Up and down the shop. Me and Dan have a shop now.

06:40.800 --> 06:48.320
You haven't been on one? No, I've been on one. It was a lot of fun. I think that people just like

06:48.320 --> 06:52.280
being mad about stuff, right? They used to be mad about rock and roll and now they're mad about

06:52.280 --> 06:58.680
scooters. I'm not familiar with the beef about the... Well, in Santa Monica, there's a lot of these

06:58.680 --> 07:12.480
scooters. Dan, take it away. Well, I... Dan takes it away. I certainly don't want to blindly dismiss

07:12.480 --> 07:20.160
if anybody has a legitimate grievance. I just, I sort of like, come on. There's a, you know,

07:20.160 --> 07:26.160
tech is being used laterally and experimentally as it should be. Somebody, like, you know,

07:26.160 --> 07:32.600
it's funny how culture progresses and things. I think it's the impressiveness of it way outweighs

07:32.600 --> 07:41.880
any possible inconvenience. Right. Like, the potential solutions, you know, they just have

07:41.880 --> 07:46.520
these scooters. They just like, you just throw them out in the street. You just throw them. Like,

07:46.520 --> 07:53.280
there's no, they don't have stations. There's no, it's sort of like GPS technology and these

07:53.280 --> 07:59.200
things that we associate with, like, bridling us and, oh, we're all in a Orwellian society. It's

07:59.200 --> 08:03.320
like, well, yeah, but it also means you could just take this fucking lump of metal and just go

08:03.320 --> 08:09.920
out in the sidewalk and just rolls and lands. And if you find one... Yeah, I walked out of my place.

08:09.920 --> 08:15.440
There was one in the bush in front of my place. I'm like, is this, is this somebody that wants

08:15.440 --> 08:20.240
this back? Like, did somebody drop this off to go take a pee and wants this back or can I just

08:20.240 --> 08:24.160
steal his scooter? I don't know what that was. If it's in the bush, I think he's hiding it so

08:24.160 --> 08:28.240
you can't find it so he can get it. It was inside the bush. It was just resting. It was nestling.

08:28.240 --> 08:32.800
Yeah, somebody visited your neighbor and they left it there. Like, like we did with dirt bikes in

08:32.800 --> 08:37.320
83. That's like, you know, you ride your dirt bike and then you fucking ditch it, you run in and

08:37.320 --> 08:41.440
play Atari. Yeah, but somebody stole my red line dirt bike and I was fucking pissed off. Well,

08:41.440 --> 08:45.720
yeah, because it was your dirt bike to steal. And now imagine a world where, okay, who needs to own

08:45.720 --> 08:50.000
this piece of shit? I'm just taking it to my friend's house to play Atari. But let's say I go to

08:50.000 --> 08:55.360
your place on one of these e-scooters, right? I'm not walking or driving to Dan's place. I'm gonna

08:55.360 --> 08:59.840
take one of these. Use a scooter. I found a scooter in a bush. I live, I live in Chelsea. He lives

08:59.840 --> 09:07.520
in Upper West Side. Yeah. That tracks. It's a bit of a ride. I'm gonna play some Atari. We just

09:07.520 --> 09:13.240
take the A train. Okay. But anyway, but let's say I go, oh, I found a scooter in a bush. What's it

09:13.240 --> 09:19.000
say? The first ride is only a dollar. I figure out how to make it work. There's a QR code. Yeah,

09:19.000 --> 09:26.280
you scan it. And now I'm on a thing and now it's going and I'm in a suit and I look like a vampire

09:26.280 --> 09:34.920
in a scooter. And I get to your place and then I drop it off, just leave it. Just leave it. And

09:34.920 --> 09:39.400
then I come out and go, where's my scooter? Well, now you don't have a ride home. But yeah, I mean,

09:39.400 --> 09:42.320
it's not guaranteed because someone could come by and find it. Just fucking scoop up my scooter. I

09:42.320 --> 09:46.000
think you can also locate them with your, you can go like, where's the nearest one? You can go find

09:46.000 --> 09:50.920
it. Yeah, you can keep. Can I stash it? Like, can I put it in your garage? Well, you can take it

09:50.920 --> 09:54.880
into the house. Yeah. Or you can just stay renting it. Then someone goes, where's my nearest

09:54.880 --> 09:58.400
scooter? And they go, oh, Dan Harmon's house. Oh, is that true? That's what I'm confused. You stay

09:58.400 --> 10:04.920
renting it like, okay, so if you went to the 7-Eleven, Jeff, you just, you don't unrent it. And then

10:04.920 --> 10:09.520
that means if someone comes up to try and get it, they can't because it's already in use by you. So

10:09.520 --> 10:13.760
that that bush scooter might have already been. Oh, you're paying for the time. Yeah, yeah, you

10:13.760 --> 10:19.000
pay for it in time. Yeah, but then you get paid to charge it. So if you take a scooter home and

10:19.000 --> 10:25.040
charge it, you get like 10 bucks for that. This is French. It's awesome. Here's the problem. It was

10:25.040 --> 10:31.440
rolled out in Santa Monica, which just has garbage traffic and especially garbage bike traffic, which

10:31.440 --> 10:35.080
doesn't integrate well with street traffic. It's already hard for bikes. That's the, I get that. Right.

10:35.080 --> 10:38.960
It's already hard enough for bicyclists. But that's the thing is, so all the problems that apply to

10:38.960 --> 10:43.480
bicyclists are now applying to scooters, but since they're easier to use and you don't have to go

10:43.480 --> 10:48.120
out and be a weird biker to drive a bike, don't get me wrong. If you like a bike, that's good. But

10:48.120 --> 10:53.960
anyone can do it. So we're having more of a traffic problem because all this bike, you know,

10:53.960 --> 10:58.360
what is essentially bike traffic is now being forced to contend with road traffic. And that's a

10:58.360 --> 11:03.560
problem because the roads weren't built for bikes. But that's a problem for bikes and not scooters.

11:03.560 --> 11:08.840
It's just a problem. It's like, it's bad etiquette on a bicycle to be on the sidewalk. I hate when

11:08.840 --> 11:13.480
bikers are on the sidewalk. But now scooters are all over the goddamn sidewalk and I'm gonna get killed

11:13.480 --> 11:18.920
by a family of scooter people. Right. But you would have got killed by a bike two weeks ago. So

11:18.920 --> 11:25.320
you're just fearing rock and roll. I just want to add this as a as a former LA bicyclist. I just

11:25.320 --> 11:29.960
want to add I'd rather have people hate me for being on the sidewalk than fucking die. Right.

11:29.960 --> 11:35.720
Because like, it's not a bicycle friendly city. Anyways, blah, blah, blah. A lot of bicyclists get

11:35.720 --> 11:41.480
killed in the road by by drivers and stuff. Like that's a huge issue in LA. Right. And they have

11:41.480 --> 11:46.040
the right of way. And yet they're getting like probably hurt as if they were motorcyclists who

11:46.040 --> 11:49.240
know what they're signing up for. Sorry if you're out there and you got injured in a motorcycle

11:49.240 --> 11:55.160
accident. I'm just being glib. But I mean, bicycles can't split lanes and stuff. You're just riding

11:55.160 --> 11:59.640
on the side of the road. Look, I get I get frustrated by a bicyclist in front of me too. But

11:59.640 --> 12:04.760
then I go like, come on, Dan, we live near each other. Spencer, if you're down with us, we can

12:04.760 --> 12:09.000
do it together. I'd love to. Let's let's find take one of these scooters. Let's find some me

12:09.000 --> 12:12.840
scooters and fucking just like take it to the streets like fuck it. Well, I do want to break

12:12.840 --> 12:18.280
that. Yeah, and go like, let's learn to do this. Like, you know, so that because it's like, I

12:18.280 --> 12:22.120
yeah, I want to know how to do it. It's great. How do you know if the battery is going to die

12:22.120 --> 12:28.680
on it? It'll tell you when you scan or looking for them. It's great. Spencer, you got all the

12:28.680 --> 12:33.560
answers today, man. I'm sorry. Well, that's what we want to be. What's that fucking treasure basket

12:33.560 --> 12:48.200
you've got? Not all the answers. All right, so I was eating dinner with my friend and we were

12:48.200 --> 12:53.480
talking about our dads and like, like sayings and things. It was actually Heath who you remember

12:53.480 --> 12:59.160
from the dad fish episode. We were having dinner and we're just so the topic of dads had come

12:59.160 --> 13:03.880
up again and like he's he he attributed the saying to his dad, which I have heard before.

13:04.600 --> 13:09.400
And I wrote it down because it's like, I really have always had a problem with the saying that

13:09.400 --> 13:14.360
his dad would say, you know, like if you if you would go like, well, I wish I wish we could have

13:14.360 --> 13:20.200
gone to the zoo today. And then like his dad would say, well, wish in one hand and shit in the other

13:20.200 --> 13:30.440
and see which one fills up faster. That's the fucking most awful thing I've ever heard. It just

13:30.440 --> 13:40.200
doesn't it doesn't scan for me. It doesn't you don't wish into anything. I like like it almost

13:40.200 --> 13:44.760
makes its own counter argument because it's sort of like like your one hairs breath away from saying

13:44.760 --> 13:51.880
fill one hand with wishes and fill the other hand with shit and see which is more valuable.

13:53.080 --> 14:00.360
Like a handful of shit. We'll see. A handful of wishes is like the ratio of value to

14:01.160 --> 14:06.040
amount of you have to wash it. It's like amazing. You could wish for a toilet. You could wish for

14:06.040 --> 14:13.240
like it just seems like it's more practical to fill your one hand with shit. But that's not

14:13.240 --> 14:19.880
sustainable. Your hand fills right up. If you're wishing into your hand, you'll be fucking doing

14:19.880 --> 14:26.280
it for weeks. I got two handful of wishes right now. And you can still use them to do stuff. Yeah,

14:26.920 --> 14:31.960
I wish Spencer would tell me what's on that fucking lunchbox on his desk. I got a bunch of

14:31.960 --> 14:40.440
pocket operators in it. Look. Oh, whoa. Yeah. Wow. There you go. Pocket operators. They make music.

14:40.440 --> 14:45.800
I don't even know what that is. It's good. They're like little synthesizers that the kids are doing.

14:45.800 --> 14:50.200
All the kids, they love them. There's a book called What Makes Sammy Run by Bud Shilberg.

14:51.320 --> 14:57.400
Like kind of the antagonist in it is Sammy Glick. And he says it's like about the Hollywood system

14:57.400 --> 15:03.320
back in the like 30s, 40s, 50s. I don't know. It's been a while. And 60s. Yeah. No, it's poor that.

15:03.320 --> 15:08.440
And he says your friend doesn't want to write that like punch up your script for $50. And he goes,

15:08.440 --> 15:12.680
you tell someone so if he doesn't like $50, he can shit in his hat, pull it over his head and call

15:12.680 --> 15:21.560
it curls. That's the best thing. I think a lot of people get away with invoking shit. And these

15:21.560 --> 15:25.240
like quick statements are like counting on you to not think twice about it. My dad used to say,

15:25.240 --> 15:32.360
if I wanted any shit out of you, I'll squeeze your head. Wait, what? Yeah. But then he would often add

15:32.360 --> 15:35.720
and it'll come out of your ears. Because I think he thought that wait, this kid's four years old.

15:35.720 --> 15:41.160
He doesn't even understand what I'm saying. But he understands child abuse. Well, I was just saying

15:41.160 --> 15:43.960
like, if I want shit out of you, I'll squeeze your head. And then I think you'd see a blank

15:43.960 --> 15:48.280
stare and be like, it'll come out of your ears. Because your head's full of shit.

15:48.280 --> 15:52.520
That's the most softened the blow of that statement. Well, it just it helps the jokeland,

15:52.520 --> 15:56.280
I guess. I don't know if that's your goal. What's the first part? If I need shit out of you,

15:56.280 --> 16:00.280
if I want any shit out of you, I'll squeeze your head. Well, you know there's an easier way to do it.

16:00.280 --> 16:08.200
Squeeze the butt. Well, yeah. Yeah. You can't. You can't. You can't. You first feed them,

16:08.200 --> 16:11.880
give them a hot meal. Right, yeah. Yeah, provide for them. Yes. And just actually,

16:11.880 --> 16:15.400
just wait, you don't even have to squeeze them. That's what I'm saying. If I went, Dan, if I

16:15.400 --> 16:19.800
want any shit out of you, I'm going to take you to Arby's. If I want any shit out of you, I'll

16:19.800 --> 16:24.840
keep going to work from nine to five and accepting the accountability that comes with reproduction

16:24.840 --> 16:30.760
and providing you with a... I will wait six to eight hours after I fed you. And I'll put a special

16:30.760 --> 16:39.000
trap into the toilet because apparently I'm in this for shit. Not wishes. You should put a wish

16:39.000 --> 16:46.200
trap under your butt. A little wish trap. What if you can shit wishes? The whole value of wishes

16:46.200 --> 16:52.520
is that they have zero rest mass. That means they can move at the speed of light. You can wish

16:52.520 --> 16:57.480
a thousand times. It won't cost you anything. Wish, wish, wish, wish, wish, wish. I didn't

16:57.480 --> 17:03.880
suffer anything. That's the whole point. Fucking wish away, motherfuckers. You can't flush a wish.

17:03.880 --> 17:08.840
You don't have to poop. It costs you nothing to wish. You know what it profits you every once

17:08.840 --> 17:14.760
in a while? You come up with a fucking e-scooter business. I wish I was a fucking millionaire.

17:14.760 --> 17:20.040
That's the whole idea. I wish, wish, wish, wish, wish, wish. Fucking wish away. Don't

17:20.040 --> 17:27.160
shit in your hand. Someone wished a toilet existed. That guy was smart. Or lady.

17:30.200 --> 17:37.800
Madam crapper. I wish I didn't just shit in my hand. I just wish shit in one hand or wish in

17:37.800 --> 17:44.760
one hand shit in the other and see which one fills up faster. All right, Dad, I went away and did

17:44.760 --> 17:53.000
what you said and I have a handful of shit. See? I still don't get your point, man. I just said

17:53.000 --> 17:58.200
I wish you were a better dad. You could fill up. Like I still don't understand your point. I just

17:58.200 --> 18:02.200
have shit in my hand. Like that's like just reinforced. I feel like I already had that in

18:02.200 --> 18:06.120
the form of your fatherhood. You should have called his bluff and go, all right, give me,

18:06.120 --> 18:10.920
give me 20 minutes. And then come back out with a handful of shit and another hand go,

18:10.920 --> 18:17.880
the wishes filled up faster. I mean, how do you know? Like what is a wish way? What is its mass?

18:17.880 --> 18:22.200
I don't have like wishes are the only part of humanity. That's our redeeming quality to be

18:22.200 --> 18:28.040
able to wish. Penguins can't wish. We're going to fuck them. Talk to penguins in 50 years.

18:29.080 --> 18:33.800
You won't be able to. You know why? They couldn't wish. We could. What did we wish for?

18:34.440 --> 18:39.160
Greenhouse effect. Indirectly. We didn't really want that. We wished for cars.

18:39.160 --> 18:45.320
Penguins just wished for tuna, I think, I assume. I don't know. Or salmon.

18:45.320 --> 18:49.000
Penguins should have wished for droppings. What did penguins eat? Penguins should have wished

18:49.000 --> 18:52.600
for hams, but they can't hold anything. They can't even hold their own shit.

18:54.200 --> 18:57.160
You try to hold shit in a penguin flipper? It's going to fall right off.

18:57.960 --> 19:01.320
I don't want to throw penguins under the bus at a time when they're probably under a lot of

19:01.320 --> 19:06.120
fire from the climate. They should have wished for the retention of flight.

19:06.120 --> 19:12.760
Like, what makes a bird of all creatures think maybe we should get back into the ocean?

19:12.760 --> 19:17.720
Yeah, they should have wished that they didn't have to carry their child's egg on their feet for

19:17.720 --> 19:22.040
four months while their spouse was on the fish tank. I'm a little iffy even on the mammals that

19:22.040 --> 19:31.000
go back. All due respect to my boys, the dolphins. Like, props. West side. Like, we get it. Like,

19:31.000 --> 19:36.280
fucking, maybe shit was going ham up here. Like, you were like a dog creature. You know, maybe I

19:36.280 --> 19:39.720
could have flippers that go back. Is this your influence of hanging out with Dave Kline that

19:39.720 --> 19:43.880
you have all this new? I guess I'm kind of going off of his, like, maybe I'm learning to, like,

19:43.880 --> 19:49.320
be encouraged by him. Maybe if he's happy, I'm happy. So maybe that's what's happening. But no,

19:49.320 --> 19:52.840
it's like, like, whales were probably these brontosaurus, isn't there? Like, this is fucking

19:52.840 --> 19:58.280
bullshit. Like, I'm on your side as a brontosaurus creature, like a Loch Ness monster. Like, that's

19:58.280 --> 20:03.000
what a whale would have looked like before it went back. It was, like, experimenting with, like,

20:03.000 --> 20:09.080
well, I've been told that if I start breathing oxygen, I can eat leaves and hang out. And then

20:09.080 --> 20:19.400
it's like, and then something comes up, disembowels. I was like, fuck this. And it goes back. I'm,

20:19.400 --> 20:32.520
like, on that guy's side. That's, I'm, like, good, good for you. You know, do you know what a Dave Kline whale says?

20:32.520 --> 20:52.440
Well, let's bring out Rob Schrab. Well, something exotic is about to happen. I can't even see.

20:52.440 --> 21:10.200
Wow, you know what? Dan's leaving the stage as Rob takes the stage after taking of Dan's popcorn.

21:10.200 --> 21:25.640
Rob, test the new chair. It doesn't look more comfortable. What do you think? Is it comfortable?

21:25.640 --> 21:32.600
It's kind of like a high chair. Yeah. Is that what we're, is that the angle we're going for?

21:32.600 --> 21:35.880
People are trying to make you happy, Rob. We're trying to make you, we're trying to make you more

21:35.880 --> 21:48.200
comfortable. Cushions! I got a cushion. Do you want mine? I knew it. I knew it. I still can't see,

21:48.200 --> 21:54.520
but I know what's happening. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. There's a new chair.

21:54.520 --> 22:09.240
This chair does look comfortable. This has been Harmontown Musical Chairs.

22:11.880 --> 22:15.640
Thanks, Dave. I win! I win!

22:15.640 --> 22:25.800
Rob, what are your thoughts on Senator McCain dying?

22:34.360 --> 22:40.920
Here's the thing. Podcast dynamite. Here's the thing. Give me my popcorn. No, no.

22:40.920 --> 22:45.800
All right, you can have it a little. Give us thoughts on John McCain dying.

22:47.080 --> 22:53.480
I think it's sad when anything dies, you know, I mean, but I, you know, I didn't share his

22:53.480 --> 22:59.320
belief system, but he seemed like he was trying to do some good stuff. He fought for our country. He

22:59.320 --> 23:04.680
got his POW, you know, I mean, like, he did some, he tried to do some good stuff.

23:04.680 --> 23:10.680
Spencer, what do you think about Rob's thoughts on John McCain dying? I think they were too safe.

23:12.040 --> 23:17.240
I don't think he took a real stand. I'm kind of like, like, like what a rivet would have as a

23:17.240 --> 23:23.320
thought, like a frog or a rivets are a valuable part of society. Let me ask you one question.

23:23.880 --> 23:31.720
Do you usually go to frogs for like political commentary? No, you don't. So don't go to me

23:31.720 --> 23:38.680
for political commentary either. Go for me for chair criticisms. Try. What do you think about

23:38.680 --> 23:45.160
the genocide going on in Myanmar right now? I'm against it. Next question. I can't.

23:45.720 --> 23:49.160
Too safe. Because the people committing it are just trying to keep genocide from happening.

23:53.240 --> 23:57.720
I think popcorn's bad for the show. You guys, I think it's, I think it's good. Good for the tummy.

23:57.720 --> 24:01.720
Nobody wants to hear people eat during a thing. They'll live. Like, when I, like,

24:01.720 --> 24:05.400
they can watch. There's a commercial and there's people eating, like a Carl's Jr. commercial.

24:05.400 --> 24:10.760
People, the sound of people eating was going to fucking barf. I was hungry. I don't know how

24:10.760 --> 24:19.160
much Carl's Jr. ads amplify the sound of eating. I don't, I don't know that that's true. I think

24:19.160 --> 24:23.880
that if anyone knows how unattractive the sound of eating is, it's the companies trying to sell

24:23.880 --> 24:31.240
that. Is there anybody in the audience, preferably of the, of the, of the persuasion, but I'm not

24:31.240 --> 24:38.920
going to. Hey, that was great, man. Now go on. Hey, if you're serving the audience, let me hear you

24:38.920 --> 25:00.120
say, yeah. Yeah. Is there anybody in the audience that is the, is the, that, that identifies as

25:00.120 --> 25:05.800
the kind of person that would like to wear a tiny backpack who also wait, wait for it. Sorry.

25:05.800 --> 25:13.400
Sorry. Who also would give us honest feedback from their perspective on what they expect from

25:13.400 --> 25:19.960
the show moving forward. Okay. All right. You're, you're committed. Okay. Come on up. All right.

25:19.960 --> 25:34.120
All right. From the second row. Hello. Your name is Nova.

25:34.120 --> 25:43.080
Nova galaxy across the milky way. Your backpack is here for you.

25:43.080 --> 25:46.200
Here you go. Nova plastic on the hand.

25:47.880 --> 25:55.880
Make sure you cut off the tags. Major Tom. Well, your name is Nova.

25:55.880 --> 26:02.120
Nova. Yeah. Hello, Nova. Welcome supernova to the show.

26:03.640 --> 26:08.120
Making over your backpack.

26:09.320 --> 26:16.280
Nova. Hey, hey, Nova. Nova was in Planet of the Apes, the original Planet of the Apes.

26:16.280 --> 26:27.000
I know. Yeah. Is that a blood? Hey, hey, hey. One more thing. Nova was a television show. Yep.

26:27.000 --> 26:35.800
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. That's all I got. A car. What? A car, a star. Yeah. You're probably

26:35.800 --> 26:42.520
an expert on this. What else are you named? You know what would be better is what, what am I named

26:42.520 --> 26:47.960
after? Don't answer that. Don't answer that. Don't answer that. Don't answer that. Don't answer that.

26:47.960 --> 26:58.040
Okay. Moving on to you. Thievery. Nova, what do you think qualifies you to wear the coveted

26:58.040 --> 27:03.080
tiny Rick and Morty backpack? I don't know. I'm a pretty huge super fan of Harmontown.

27:03.080 --> 27:07.720
I've been to like almost every show at this theater. And I love Rick and Morty very much.

27:07.720 --> 27:11.880
I resent this line of questioning. Yeah. She doesn't have to prove nothing.

27:11.880 --> 27:15.560
Yeah. I mean, it's a, it's a consumer product. You just have to want the backpack. You don't

27:15.560 --> 27:19.400
have to earn the backpack. Well, okay. I have a follow-up question. What do you,

27:19.400 --> 27:22.680
what do you think is going to go into that backpack first? What's, what's,

27:22.680 --> 27:25.960
what are you going to carry around in your smart little tote bag? All right, I'll move it.

27:30.280 --> 27:37.160
Phone wallet? Phone and wallet. That's fair. Yeah. Is that one thing? Like a hyphen? No, I don't have

27:37.160 --> 27:43.080
the little thing with that part of it. I just, I don't, I, I'm so sorry about my friend. That's

27:43.080 --> 27:49.960
totally cool. Hey, what are you doing for Labor Day weekend, Nova? Labor Day weekend

27:49.960 --> 27:55.160
going to be showing off that backpack. Got any tattoos? Yeah. Go get, get some tattoos on the

27:55.160 --> 28:00.600
backpack on Labor Day weekend. You want to go get a tattoo on Labor Day weekend with me and Rob?

28:00.600 --> 28:08.840
I'm going to go see the Meg on Labor Day weekend. Yeah. Some empty seats for the Meg.

28:08.840 --> 28:13.480
I try to bring a young person up and, and, and, and. I'm trying to relate the Meg.

28:14.760 --> 28:20.040
It's just traumatizing them. They're going to be like, I don't even know what happened. It was

28:20.040 --> 28:26.520
like Thanksgiving at my uncle's. It's much better. Okay. As long as you're having a good time. Yeah.

28:26.520 --> 28:32.760
But also, and, and then also if the audience is having a good time, but then also on top of that,

28:33.320 --> 28:37.960
I should have a good time. Yeah, it's your show. We'll stop being such a fucking stick in the

28:37.960 --> 28:45.720
deck and get in the game, man. I'm not a stick in the deck. I'm not a stick in the deck. Take that

28:45.720 --> 28:54.520
back. Take it back. Your arms are folded. Yeah. Well, you know what? This is an allowable posture

28:54.520 --> 29:00.760
for somebody. You got some snot dripping off your mustache. It's vodka. This isn't your show.

29:00.760 --> 29:06.360
Are you kissing? Did you just? Someone's acting like a real stick in the deck over there. Nova.

29:08.200 --> 29:13.800
Nova. I don't want to put you in between this. Nova. But choose between me and Rob.

29:14.840 --> 29:17.560
Nova, you must use the power crystals. Your backpack is on the line.

29:18.200 --> 29:23.320
Nova, you must use the power crystals or you won't be able to open the galaxy door.

29:23.320 --> 29:33.400
Nova, believe in yourself. Nova, please. Nova, give me a name, Nova. What's my name, Rob?

29:34.440 --> 29:39.560
I just want to die sometimes. Is that why you listen to the show? Because you sometimes just

29:39.560 --> 29:44.200
want to die and you're like, Dean knows what it's like. Like he gets sad. Yeah. Okay, good. That's

29:44.200 --> 29:49.240
what I thought. And so he kind of ruins it sometimes, right? No. Okay. That was my job.

29:49.240 --> 29:55.320
I don't like when he makes you legitimately upset. No, but he's not upset. Get a little

29:55.320 --> 30:01.880
frustrated. Look at his arms. Look at his posture. I get concerned about shape of show. I get

30:01.880 --> 30:07.320
concerned about $10. I get concerned about you driving from Silver Lake, wherever you're coming

30:07.320 --> 30:14.520
from. Santa Clarita. Santa Clarita. I mean, that's a long drive. And then you choke up with some

30:14.520 --> 30:21.960
money. Santa Clarita diet. Do you ever watch that? I want you to have a good time. I always

30:21.960 --> 30:28.920
have a good time. So yes. I love you and I love Schrab. Okay. Nova, what do you do for a living,

30:28.920 --> 30:36.680
if I may ask? Nothing currently. I'm unemployed. I've never been applauded for that. You can

30:36.680 --> 30:40.360
charge e-scooters. You can go grab them. You can take them and charge them. Yeah, I mean, I see

30:40.360 --> 30:48.680
people doing that. It's crazy. I thought they were self-mowed powered. They are self-mowed powered.

30:50.200 --> 30:54.360
They need to be charged. And then there's like cultures of kids, like they roll in

30:54.360 --> 30:59.560
scooter charging gangs. Yeah, they do. Or with each other. That sounds fun. Hey, man. That scooter is

30:59.560 --> 31:06.520
the property of sticky. That's on my turn. I don't know this sticky, but I know this scooter belongs

31:06.520 --> 31:13.880
to the Jet Boys. Get them. And they have scooter fights, but all the scooters are out of battery.

31:14.520 --> 31:19.800
You're never alone. They inch forward on scooters going and then try to like steer it with one

31:19.800 --> 31:25.960
hand. They're all wobbling. It's hard to do Jerome Robin's choreography when you're on a scooter.

31:25.960 --> 31:34.040
What? Here's my concern, Nova. Can I ask you, is podcast culture, do you listen to podcasts

31:34.040 --> 31:38.680
when you're like going to sleep at night, like you make a part of your life? I listen to podcasts

31:38.680 --> 31:43.320
just throughout like my whole day, because I feel too, I don't know, kind of like lonely or sad with

31:43.320 --> 31:48.840
like nothing on. Yeah. So yeah. So I listen to Harmontown or Game Grumps, which is technically

31:48.840 --> 31:55.800
not a podcast, but there's no like face cam. So it's like a podcast. But yeah, I don't listen to

31:55.800 --> 32:04.600
a wide variety of things. So like my concern as an old timer is I'm thinking about you,

32:05.880 --> 32:12.360
kids. I'm like, oh, if I was Nova and I was going to sleep when I was listening to Harmontown,

32:12.360 --> 32:18.360
can I rely on this show to like have like a consistency and a like sort of like, oh,

32:18.360 --> 32:24.360
I'm coming home to Harmontown. But it's like, like I just that's that's when I express anxiety is

32:24.360 --> 32:28.280
that's what I'm worried about. I definitely have like a coming home to Harmontown of like,

32:28.280 --> 32:34.600
I don't know, there's so much diversity in like 300 episodes, you know, at least four white people

32:34.600 --> 32:47.400
up here. Four white men. The hallmark of Harmontown is our rich diversity. I don't know how diversified

32:47.400 --> 32:55.640
this show is. It's not my fault. Yeah, we've had in 301 episodes, we've had four women on stage.

32:55.640 --> 33:01.880
Anyways, continue Nova. Dan Harmon.wn's not good for sleep. I don't know. It's like the

33:01.880 --> 33:06.920
sorry about the live show thing. And then the diversity of like, there might be a guest and

33:06.920 --> 33:10.520
that's like their voices different or whatever. But how does that slot? Well, like, like, like,

33:10.520 --> 33:14.840
is there a certain time of day or a certain activity that the podcast works especially

33:14.840 --> 33:22.680
best for? It's best for Sims, just like making houses in Sims. Sims 4? Sims 4? Yeah. So like,

33:22.680 --> 33:26.280
like that would be because I've listened to it while I played Minecraft and it does kind of work.

33:26.280 --> 33:29.240
I feel like when you talk about Minecraft, I'm like, yeah, that's how I feel about Sims.

33:29.240 --> 33:32.600
Should we get Sims as a sponsor and have Nova do an ad for us right now?

33:34.040 --> 33:36.440
You can try it. Nova, do a little ad read and we're gonna, we're gonna,

33:36.440 --> 33:49.960
we're gonna spec add. Hey, so Sims, very broken, very fun. Yeah, you get to live as little people,

33:49.960 --> 33:53.160
but they don't do anything interesting. They just kind of go around the house. You make yourself

33:53.160 --> 33:57.880
food and stuff. You can have little careers. I just like making houses because it's fun.

33:58.520 --> 34:03.800
Do you like green diamonds floating above heads? Do you like trapping people and swimming pools?

34:03.800 --> 34:07.160
Do you like watching your Sims go to the bathroom for a weirdly long time?

34:07.160 --> 34:10.840
Do you like making your Sims pee on the floor and mop it up while crying?

34:10.840 --> 34:14.920
No, I don't like doing bad things to my Sims. It makes me feel sad. I get to attach to them.

34:14.920 --> 34:18.760
I'm like, they're people. I just like making houses mostly playing is not my favorite.

34:18.760 --> 34:21.480
Okay, I don't know if that was a good Sims ad, but I think it was. I don't think so.

34:22.440 --> 34:27.800
I started Sims and I played it for a while and then you come back home and it just flies

34:27.800 --> 34:31.080
everywhere and everyone's bummed out. I'm like, this is, I don't know why everyone who plays

34:31.080 --> 34:36.840
Sims seems to be so bad at it. It's pretty easy for me. You have to be dedicated to it.

34:37.720 --> 34:41.320
Yeah, you can't just leave it on and the Sims do weird things and you're like, no,

34:41.320 --> 34:46.040
you have to go to work and you're all invested. You're like, no, you're gonna be late for work.

34:46.600 --> 34:53.080
I do get that Tomagachi anxiety. The idea of a game that if I leave it,

34:54.280 --> 34:57.800
I fuck up by doing nothing. I'm like, that's what I'm trying to get away from in life.

34:57.800 --> 35:08.040
Are there any other events where you get Tomagachi anxiety? If you're waiting in line at the bank,

35:09.000 --> 35:15.720
do you get a Tomagachi anxiety? Or if traffic is like a parking lot on the coral

35:15.720 --> 35:19.400
vibe, we've all been there. Just imagine anyone listening to this show. Tomagachi

35:20.040 --> 35:27.080
anxiety. Or your mom is talking to you. You get a word and edgewise. That's when I get the

35:27.080 --> 35:33.800
Tomagachi anxiety. You still like us both? Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, I don't get it.

35:34.520 --> 35:40.120
I just, I feel like Schrab's Schrab's level of chaos has leveled up because of his new chair.

35:41.240 --> 35:45.960
He's feeling very relaxed. It's a big top, isn't it? Like, I've never been happier. It's like,

35:47.560 --> 35:52.600
does anyone, does anyone perceive the real story here, which is me throwing buckets of

35:52.600 --> 35:57.560
enabling on him, trying to make him happy? Like, like, like, should I dig a pit of spikes and have

35:57.560 --> 36:02.920
him fall into it? And like, all I do is that the chairs have been getting more cushioned. I keep

36:02.920 --> 36:07.400
appeasing him more and more. I flew him to Boston. Like, no one's telling this story.

36:09.320 --> 36:13.480
You're telling the story on the show. I know when it's uncharismatic for me to tell it. Someone

36:13.480 --> 36:17.640
else has to tell it. Anyways, he's a monster. I don't know if anyone else can understand the

36:17.640 --> 36:24.120
complexities between you guys' 20-year relationship. Dan flew Rob out to Boston. Thanks.

36:28.360 --> 36:34.280
Was there more to this story? Aren't you guys going to buy weed together? I heard.

36:34.280 --> 36:40.840
Yeah, we're gonna, we're gonna, I, I, okay, so here's the deal. Two weeks ago, Rob approached me.

36:40.840 --> 36:48.120
And I go, hey, Spencer, can you teach me how to vape? And Spencer said,

36:49.160 --> 36:58.520
go on, go on. What's my line? Yes. Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay. And now he, we're gonna do it on Wednesday.

36:58.520 --> 37:03.160
You guys are gonna go buy, go to a dispensary? Yeah, I told Schrab I would show him the ropes.

37:03.160 --> 37:08.600
Just wait a minute. A dispensary. Yeah, yeah, it sounds the same. Oh, yeah. Let me, let's run through

37:08.600 --> 37:14.600
some names that sound like Spencer. Suspender. No, we've done this before. Suspense. Suspension.

37:15.240 --> 37:22.520
Dispense. Dispenser. That's about all of them. But no, I told Schrab we'd take him to the store

37:22.520 --> 37:27.320
next time I was going, but I haven't been smoking weed, so it like, it took a lot longer. So next

37:27.320 --> 37:34.760
time you see me, I'm gonna be like, oh, peace and love, man. Man, you guys gotta, you guys gotta

37:34.760 --> 37:44.840
just relax. Peace and love, man. Why, why, why are you doing all the war, man? I'm talking about

37:44.840 --> 37:52.040
peace and love, man. We need to get down, just smoke some God. You got Maui, Maui, and leave this

37:52.040 --> 37:58.040
shit, man. So you, so you, Spencer, you know a dispensary that turns Rob into a black

37:58.040 --> 38:04.680
exploitation character? Man, you need to get down with the glass, man. I'm gonna smoke some

38:04.680 --> 38:10.200
vape. I'm gonna smoke all the vape. Nova, do you, do you vape it up? Do you, are you a vaporizer?

38:10.200 --> 38:15.000
No, no, I've never done weed or cigarettes or anything. I'm not against it. I just haven't done

38:15.000 --> 38:26.040
it. Yeah. If you feel different, you drive different. What? You know what I'm saying?

38:26.040 --> 38:30.680
You what different? You drive different, man. I would assume so. I gotta, I gotta go to this

38:30.680 --> 38:35.000
dispensary. Yeah, man. Fucking blow in my mind. I'd probably like it. Did they, did they, did they

38:35.000 --> 38:43.160
sell vape shirts and vape posters? They sell vape hats and vape socks. Fucking A, man. Vape socks,

38:43.160 --> 38:49.000
vape socks. What's a vape sock? It's a sock for your vape. All right. I'm gonna take some, I'm

38:49.000 --> 38:56.600
gonna take four vape socks, a couple hats. I'll take a vape. Now give me three. It's worse

38:56.600 --> 39:01.000
when you're up here. Yeah, it's worse when you're on stage. It's a lot of show. The show? Yeah.

39:01.000 --> 39:09.000
No, no, no. I'm gonna take, I'll take three vape. Take one of these. Oh my god. Thank you. I'm so

39:09.000 --> 39:13.080
glad I did. This is why you're here. Finally. Like, and now I have to bring every single person up one

39:13.080 --> 39:25.160
at a time and go like, see? Like, but I mean, so where your parents are, are they, are they

39:25.160 --> 39:30.840
astronomers, public television supporters? They're kind of hippies. They like science. They likes

39:30.840 --> 39:36.280
the show, I guess. They like the stars kind of thing. Carl Sagan kind of thing. No, they wanted

39:36.280 --> 39:41.880
something unique, but not like weird. And yeah, they like science. And they're kind of, yeah, I

39:41.880 --> 39:50.280
don't know. Are you a scientific person too? I don't know. I like psychology and sociology and

39:50.280 --> 39:54.360
stuff, not so much like the physical sciences. I can't wrap my head around it like I don't care

39:54.360 --> 39:57.800
why, why a rock was formed. I don't know. They should have named you science. Seems important.

39:57.800 --> 40:03.160
They should have named you mouth foods. What, what interests you about psychology and

40:03.160 --> 40:12.840
sociology? Like, which expound on those fascinations. Like, okay. Yeah, the kind of stuff that fascinates

40:12.840 --> 40:18.840
you. I don't even know. But, um, well, I'll just go with the psychology, sociology thing. I really

40:18.840 --> 40:26.920
like, I really like trying to figure out how people work. I don't know. I have, I have Asperger's,

40:26.920 --> 40:32.920
so I'm always trying to like, yeah, yeah. I know I feel the same way. I feel like I really need to

40:32.920 --> 40:37.160
understand people. Why do people are doing what they're doing? Yeah, because I just don't get it.

40:37.160 --> 40:42.200
What are they thinking? I don't understand. I don't know why I'm doing what I'm doing. I don't

40:42.200 --> 40:47.800
know what people, I like trying to figure out the things. It'd be comforting to think there was maybe

40:47.800 --> 40:53.400
a couple rules. Yeah. I would be very nice to know why people do some of the things they do,

40:53.400 --> 40:57.800
not even because I'm upset about it, just because it's like, why, why, why, why am I doing what I

40:57.800 --> 41:02.520
do? So do you think, like, do you see yourself in this? Look, this is a question grown-ups ask kids

41:02.520 --> 41:09.000
that gets frustrating. So your answer, you can plead the fifth. But like, do you see yourself

41:09.000 --> 41:14.520
in any kind of vocation in particular? Is there a fantasy job? The only thing that I've really

41:14.520 --> 41:18.840
always been, there's, there's, like, everything that I see, I'm like, I want to do that. I want

41:18.840 --> 41:22.760
to do that. I want to do that. But the thing that I've always been like, yes, that absolutely

41:22.760 --> 41:27.800
sounds amazing, is I've always liked acting, like always, like theater acting, not like I want to be

41:27.800 --> 41:32.120
a star or whatever, but I don't know. I just, yeah, I like being in plays and stuff. Just showing up

41:32.120 --> 41:37.720
and doing the job. Yeah, exactly. There's not like take-home work. I mean, there is, but not like,

41:37.720 --> 41:42.680
during the show's run at least. But did you do theater, like high school, college? Yeah, I always

41:42.680 --> 41:47.560
did. Like, the second that I was old enough to be in the school play and elementary school, because

41:47.560 --> 41:53.000
you weren't allowed to do it. What play? In fourth grade. Peter Pan. Who'd you play? Gentlemen

41:53.000 --> 41:57.960
Starkey. Uh, he's not like famous. He's like, there's like Captain Hook, Smee, then Starkey,

41:57.960 --> 42:02.840
and he was really like, unhappy. Oh yeah, no, he's, or no, that's, that's neat. Sorry, I was thinking

42:02.840 --> 42:08.760
it was neat. That role is the anchor of the third act. Actually, he's a plot point. Do you remember

42:08.760 --> 42:16.680
any of his lines? No. No, I just remember him being like, I gotta take my gun out and then Smee

42:16.680 --> 42:22.120
being like, dude, for real. No, they're children. Like, stop. I don't know. It was really fun. I like

42:22.120 --> 42:29.800
him feelings a lot. Don't you wonder, like, if acting was a job that, if all jobs kind of,

42:29.800 --> 42:34.760
if there was some fantasy society where everything paid kind of in accordance with some sort of

42:34.760 --> 42:41.480
shared value system, like, because acting has this like built-in thing where it's like, well,

42:41.480 --> 42:47.240
maybe one day you'll be Batman. And because one day you'll be Batman, and then you'll buy a million

42:47.240 --> 42:50.840
houses, like- You suffer now by being a little cat through commercials or whatever.

42:50.840 --> 42:54.200
And so if you tell your mom, she's just like, well, what are you doing? Well, I'm acting. And

42:54.200 --> 42:57.960
she's like, well, I hope you get a break. And she means like, maybe one day you'll be Batman.

42:57.960 --> 43:02.360
But it's like, well, that's not necessarily a result of me acting well. And I'm kind of actually

43:02.360 --> 43:10.280
curious, like, people who like, like, like, if we really got to choose and we could make a living

43:10.280 --> 43:15.480
wage, and you could like do backbreaking acting work in a theater, and it had nothing, it wasn't

43:15.480 --> 43:22.600
attached to this idea of my goal is to be Susan Sarandon. And the, and it was just like, actually,

43:22.600 --> 43:28.680
I would like to do this for my life if you, as a society, could provide me with a guarantee that

43:28.680 --> 43:34.440
I can do it for 30 years. Like, like, that we could like come into Black Box Theater and go like,

43:34.440 --> 43:39.960
hello, I'm Aunt Susan. And people would be like, yay. Yeah, I think you can like, I mean, do you think

43:39.960 --> 43:44.120
that everyone would be like, I want that job, that's a privileged job? Because I don't think so. I

43:44.120 --> 43:48.520
think people would be like, no, that sucks. No, people think like, if you say you want to be an actor

43:48.520 --> 43:52.120
or a singer, people are like, oh, you know, just like, yeah, every little kid wants to be an actor

43:52.120 --> 43:54.920
or a singer, because they want to be famous and want people to pay attention to that stuff. But

43:54.920 --> 44:00.200
if fame wasn't an actual like thing, it was like, you actually saw what it took to be like, I would

44:00.200 --> 44:05.720
still love acting. And I think a lot of people would never want to be an actor. Yeah, they're

44:05.720 --> 44:12.200
totally happy. Kind of like washing dishes. Yeah, I mean, is there a role that you like, if you could

44:12.200 --> 44:17.560
do any role like on any like either small theater or like, like Broadway, like, is there a certain

44:17.560 --> 44:23.400
role that you would freak out for? I would, there's like a lot, I would love to, there's a lot,

44:24.200 --> 44:29.080
I don't know, that's, there's like a long list and stuff, but I would absolutely love to be like,

44:29.080 --> 44:34.440
I don't know, I've been, I've always been cast into like small character roles. And then I've also

44:34.440 --> 44:39.400
never been considered kind of feminine enough or masculine enough for any of the characters. So I

44:39.400 --> 44:43.400
always end up with little bit roles and stuff that can kind of be gender neutral. And I would love

44:43.400 --> 44:47.720
to be like a protagonist or something like Seymour in Little Shop of Horrors or like,

44:47.720 --> 44:51.720
something like that. Let's construct a gender neutral protagonist role and we'll do a, I don't

44:51.720 --> 44:55.320
know, it could be a male role, but just if they would cast me in it and be like, I'm allowed to

44:55.320 --> 44:59.960
play that role. Let's figure something out and then we'll, we'll do an embarrassing improvised

44:59.960 --> 45:04.200
version of it. Would you rather be a male lead in a show or a female lead? Yeah. Yeah. See,

45:04.200 --> 45:08.760
you as a Seymour would be fantastic, I would love that. Thanks. All right, then I'll be, I'll be

45:08.760 --> 45:16.600
your, your, your either, either your, your, my Audrey. Yeah, I'll be your, I'll be your plant,

45:16.600 --> 45:20.680
your Audrey. I'd love to be the plant too. That's a big dream is to be the plant. I wouldn't even

45:20.680 --> 45:24.520
have to be on stage, but I could just be turned up behind stage. Oh yeah, you could really ham it

45:24.520 --> 45:31.160
up. Act one, here we go. This is Nova's, she's not auditioning. This is just her living her, her life.

45:33.000 --> 45:40.920
I'm a plant. I'm not doing any. Seymour, what do you, why are you, you're denying me?

45:43.240 --> 45:49.400
Like, I know it's yes and, but this is a little, hmm. Okay, Seymour, I understand. I respect your

45:49.400 --> 45:54.920
boundaries. Thank you, Audrey too. I love you. Please don't eat me. You don't, you don't get to be a

45:54.920 --> 46:00.920
functioning plant without being able to work with your environment. I get it. Okay. All right, that's

46:00.920 --> 46:06.360
good. Look, I would love to play along, but being on stage here is enough. I got up of a boundary

46:06.360 --> 46:12.840
somewhere. Sure. That was a good plant, Dan. I liked your plant. It was very meek, which was

46:12.840 --> 46:18.440
interesting. Yeah, I'm willing to take risks. He's usually played very big and stuff. Hey, Dan.

46:18.440 --> 46:23.960
Dan, I just saw a church, and I went and saw a fantastic production. It's in Hollywood,

46:23.960 --> 46:28.920
if you guys are around until the 16th of Cabaret, which I love. It's a really good production.

46:29.480 --> 46:34.520
In a very tiny theater at the Lex, or the, it's a celebration theater. It's called Cabaret at the

46:34.520 --> 46:41.640
Lex. It's really, really good. You like Cabaret? I have not seen it, but I would love to. Yeah,

46:42.440 --> 46:45.480
I recommend it. You must go to it. Dan, you want to do a little Cabaret for us?

46:45.480 --> 46:50.760
Yeah, I have a memory. Are you familiar with the film or the play? Of course. Front to back. All

46:50.760 --> 46:59.000
right. It's a musical. Chicago, I know. That's kind of similar. What do you know about? It's a musical

46:59.000 --> 47:07.720
about Nazi times. Yeah, Nazi times. And there's a cabaret that you're in. Okay. I'll just start

47:07.720 --> 47:12.120
like doing a little umpire kind of intro. I know Cabaret. I know the whole show.

47:12.120 --> 47:16.120
Right. That's, of course, you're doing me a very well-known song.

47:18.440 --> 47:30.680
There's a cabaret starting right now. You're about to see a cabaret with me.

47:30.680 --> 47:42.600
It doesn't matter if there's Nazis. It doesn't matter if there's not cabaret. I have a cabaret

47:42.600 --> 47:54.840
for you. Subtext. I saw the whole show. I'm very familiar with it. I'm sorry. Yeah. I have a degree.

47:54.840 --> 48:00.200
I got a degree in it. I thought I was throwing you a curve ball. No, not at all. Cabaret,

48:00.200 --> 48:07.880
I get it. It's a show. How about let's do a little Music Man? Right. Music Man. Robert Preston.

48:07.880 --> 48:13.320
Yeah. Like Gary Indiana. Gary Anthony Williams. Gary Anthony Williams.

48:15.800 --> 48:24.360
That's a deep cut. Yeah. No, I saw that movie. He keeps telling everybody they're going to have

48:24.360 --> 48:31.320
trumpets. But then he's a con artist. And then the lady's like, you ain't got no trumpets.

48:31.320 --> 48:35.880
And then he's like, no, I got trumpets for real. And then at the end, he has magic trumpets.

48:37.560 --> 48:41.080
They get some real trumpets. The trumpets are fake. They get some real trumpets. Dream trumpets. Do

48:41.080 --> 48:45.560
you know? Do you see? I haven't seen it in a long time. They get real trumpets and they come in,

48:45.560 --> 48:49.800
but he doesn't know how to teach music. Right. But they all know how to play them. No,

48:49.800 --> 48:53.160
they don't. Because he normally splits town before that with everybody's money,

48:53.160 --> 48:56.200
but he falls in love with the... But then in the end, they all come in and they're like,

48:56.200 --> 49:02.680
foot, foot up, and they don't know how to play. But they all suck. And they're all terrible.

49:02.680 --> 49:10.120
But the families, the parents, they're so proud of their kids for even playing shitty music.

49:10.120 --> 49:14.360
Which is kind of a linear progression, because that's exactly what we already understood to be

49:14.360 --> 49:17.560
the con, that the parents would be so proud that he would sell them the instruments. No, no, no.

49:17.560 --> 49:21.240
There's no curvature in that story. Normally, he sells them the instruments,

49:21.240 --> 49:25.640
sells them the uniforms, and then fucks off with the money. But he's able to sell them based on

49:25.640 --> 49:29.800
the parents' pride and desire for their kids to be special. But normally, he's gone before they

49:29.800 --> 49:37.080
find out that he... So, this is a time he sticks around to find out that... That some problems

49:37.080 --> 49:44.360
solve themselves, as they do in shitty stories. It's like if Godzilla was about to fight Mathura

49:44.360 --> 49:54.040
and had a heart attack. And the Japanese army is like, look, Godzilla, he ate too much sandwich.

49:54.040 --> 50:00.840
Oh, boo. Oh, boo. Wow. What was that, actually? What did you say? It was... It was Godzilla.

50:00.840 --> 50:07.720
Come on. Is this Lyman's? Somebody called... Crazy rich Asians is... That's literally the title.

50:07.720 --> 50:14.840
And you come off with that Charlie Chan bullshit. What the fuck in 1979?

50:14.840 --> 50:20.120
I just said Godzilla in Crazy Rich Asian Food. Oh, God. You guys are weak.

50:21.720 --> 50:27.880
See, this is interesting, because at least in Japan, don't they literally transpose the L and R

50:27.880 --> 50:33.240
syllable? So, I mean, definitely, it's still racist because that's what we make fun of them for.

50:33.240 --> 50:40.360
God, Zira. They use the R. It just seems tricky. I mean, we should definitely avoid it, but I just

50:40.360 --> 50:47.560
like, that is what happens. Yeah, but it's like... It's the danger of coming up with rules for racism

50:47.560 --> 50:52.520
is that you don't want anybody to think that the goal is to get away with being racist or prove

50:52.520 --> 50:57.000
that they're not racist, because you don't want anybody... Somebody asked me in an interview today

50:57.800 --> 51:02.040
is so-and-so racist. It was a gotcha question about somebody well-known and so supposed to

51:02.040 --> 51:09.000
answer the question. And I said, that's a deeply irresponsible question to ask or answer about

51:09.000 --> 51:17.800
anybody right now, because if you... Is the goal to get a not racist card from Monday

51:17.800 --> 51:25.880
so that you can be as racist as possible on Wednesday? There is no... You don't want to ask

51:25.880 --> 51:31.800
that or answer that. What you want to do is try to maybe figure out how to not be racist

51:31.800 --> 51:35.880
tomorrow, which is probably going to change the definition. Right, like a lot of sensitivity

51:35.880 --> 51:40.040
training and stuff for like, don't be racist, don't be sexist is more like, don't say these words,

51:40.040 --> 51:44.920
or that kind of thing, which makes people go, oh, so how do I get around those words when the whole

51:44.920 --> 51:49.400
leitmotif is like, empathy, empathy, empathy. How not to do sexist or racist things, but you're

51:49.400 --> 51:59.160
still sexist or racist? Like, you know, not like you, but like a person. If the movement was focused

51:59.160 --> 52:03.960
on like, it was like, hey, there's people out here. Not like you. Like a person. Hey, there's

52:03.960 --> 52:15.480
people out here. Like an actual human. Like a person with feelings. I won't have those words put

52:15.480 --> 52:23.080
in my mouth. I just repeated what you said, sweetheart. Okay, fine. Darling. But it's hard to

52:23.080 --> 52:26.760
come up with rules, like just treat people like people. Treat them like they were your best friend,

52:26.760 --> 52:31.320
and then you're like, well, my best friends and I used to play smear the queer with the ball up as

52:31.320 --> 52:37.240
rare. It's like, yeah, what I'm saying to you is like, wasn't a great game. Wait, I never was

52:37.240 --> 52:44.600
satisfying enough for the language. I never heard the ball of the rear part. 70s, Wisconsin.

52:45.880 --> 52:51.960
Problematized. Yeah. But anyways, but yeah, I know it's time wears on. It's just like, oh,

52:51.960 --> 52:57.720
wait a minute, like all this all these rules have to be about like, can we actually worry about

52:57.720 --> 53:02.200
hurting each other? Like stopping people saying a word doesn't mean everyone's suddenly not racist

53:02.200 --> 53:08.680
or sexist. In fact, it actually teaches people how to exploit certain rules because hackers are

53:08.680 --> 53:13.160
all about code. You can talk really well and then not say certain words and stuff. And then somebody

53:13.160 --> 53:17.080
who doesn't really know the who doesn't really know the rules or whatever, but they're clearly like a

53:17.080 --> 53:23.480
good person who's not racist or sexist or whatever. They're not on the real like the wavelength of

53:23.480 --> 53:30.040
like, we're not allowed to say this anymore or something like that. And conversely, the kinds

53:30.040 --> 53:36.360
of people who are into rules, i.e., like those are the people that are going to be the first people

53:36.360 --> 53:41.000
to like adapt and pick up on shit and go like, oh, so if I say this and don't say that and then I

53:41.000 --> 53:43.880
say this and don't say that and then if you said that and then you said that and then you said that

53:43.880 --> 53:49.720
and they're like the kinds of people that have those kinds of brains, they're pretty largely

53:49.720 --> 53:57.400
dangerous people. They got that way because they are not focused on empathy. Yeah, they're more

53:57.400 --> 54:02.200
concerned with like self-image rather than actually being good to other people. They're just like,

54:02.200 --> 54:06.280
I want everyone to think that I'm being good to other people or whatever. I don't know, I don't

54:06.280 --> 54:09.240
want it to, I'm like scared to talk about this too much. Yeah, I don't want to drag you into

54:09.240 --> 54:16.040
someone's pit where they're like, did you hear Harbid Town? You're a friend Nova. I have a few

54:16.040 --> 54:27.800
bones to pick. Anyways. Nova, what's your last name? Mandel? You, what? Mandel? Okay. You wanted

54:27.800 --> 54:32.440
to be special. My name? Nova special? Nova special. I don't know, like there's like Nova

54:32.440 --> 54:37.640
specials, right? I don't know. My name's already Nova, like I'm identifiable. If somebody actually

54:37.640 --> 54:41.160
knows me or is in my life, they'll be like, that's Nova. They're not going to be like,

54:41.160 --> 54:44.840
that's a different John or whatever. It's not like the Mandel gives me away.

54:47.320 --> 54:56.280
There's a Nova special that I can never watch because my dogs won't allow me. It's about dogs.

54:56.280 --> 55:00.200
They freak out too much. It's the one about dogs. I don't think I've ever seen an episode of Nova,

55:00.200 --> 55:04.680
except I remember one time in science class, they were like, let's put on a movie. So they put on

55:04.680 --> 55:10.200
Nova. So then it was like the big logo flashed on the screen, Nova. And then like big dramatic

55:10.200 --> 55:17.400
music and everyone was like, yeah. We get to make out. What? What'd you say? I didn't hear.

55:18.600 --> 55:23.160
It's cool. I left Nova. I watch it all the time. Thanks. Yeah.

55:25.320 --> 55:29.880
Yeah. Didn't you ask me to talk about how I am? I mean, we can talk about anything you want.

55:29.880 --> 55:34.520
Okay, good. Moving forward. Well, I think she was going to eulogize John McCain, right?

55:34.520 --> 55:47.000
No. Yeah, I just, yeah, you listened to the show. You know, like, what's my job? What am I supposed

55:47.000 --> 55:52.920
to do? It's, I think it's the same from that it's always been. I mean, maybe it's been different

55:52.920 --> 55:58.120
in your head, but it's always like kind of seemed the same of, well, you can have a lot of internal

55:58.120 --> 56:02.120
things going on. And then we kind of get the same results at the end or whatever. You just,

56:02.120 --> 56:07.000
you know, you come out and you talk and then it's like, it's your show. You have Spencer and you have

56:08.040 --> 56:15.720
Jeff and then you have Schrab. Hey. Can I ask you a question? Okay. When is he doing it right?

56:17.240 --> 56:22.680
Well, I don't, I don't know. Would you listening to it? You're like, oh, yeah, this is, this is he's

56:22.680 --> 56:26.440
doing it right. Well, Harmontown is Harmontown. Like there's like, if you're talking about like

56:26.440 --> 56:30.680
your dog door or whatever, like I might think it's hilarious and then somebody else might be like,

56:30.680 --> 56:34.200
and then you might be talking about a drink you had and then someone else might think it's hilarious.

56:34.200 --> 56:39.400
And I might be like, but I always love the show because if I, I don't get people who are like,

56:39.400 --> 56:42.920
I hit every episode except these kinds of episodes. Like, I mean, if you're like that,

56:42.920 --> 56:48.760
fine, be picky with your stuff. But for me, it's just, but for me, it's just like, I love,

56:48.760 --> 56:53.000
like, I love Harmontown and I probably wouldn't listen to it if I didn't always really like it.

56:53.800 --> 56:57.880
And I don't know. I'm really like, you talk a lot about how special it was at like

56:57.880 --> 57:05.080
the meltdown and stuff. And like, I'm like sad that I never got to go there because I was like,

57:05.080 --> 57:08.440
listening to every single episode through and I was like, when I catch up, I'll go and then you

57:08.440 --> 57:16.120
guys had lost Starburns. And what was that? No, this is so sad that there's already a post

57:16.120 --> 57:23.000
meltdown generation. That's so sad. Are you going to stab your parents? Like, like, like,

57:23.000 --> 57:28.520
it's a whole generation board. I'm always going to stab your parents. No, I've always been happy

57:28.520 --> 57:34.600
to still listen to the show. But are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Are you going to weaponize your

57:34.600 --> 57:42.280
tiny Rick and Morty backpack? Fill it with rocks. That could be something that was too ready an

57:42.280 --> 57:50.040
answer. That was. I just saw it and I just thought rocks. I like that you went stone age on that.

57:50.040 --> 57:53.400
That's fantastic. I don't fill with knives or something just rocks. That's fine.

57:55.800 --> 57:59.800
Yeah, I mean, every time I am the exits are two to the right.

58:02.680 --> 58:06.760
I don't know. I'll just I'll just talk about like, since I've been coming here and stuff like,

58:08.120 --> 58:10.760
yeah, I caught up with all the episodes and I was like, oh, they don't have a theater. And then I

58:10.760 --> 58:13.880
kept thinking like, please don't end, please don't end, please don't end if they can't find a theater

58:13.880 --> 58:18.280
or whatever. And you guys came here and I was so happy. And then every single time I'm like, I hope

58:18.280 --> 58:22.200
he's not like I'm good on the show. I hope he's not like I'm good on the show. Hope he's not gonna

58:22.200 --> 58:26.920
what? End the show and the show. Oh, God, I don't want to hold people hostage with that. That's awful.

58:28.040 --> 58:33.320
Horrible archetype. Maybe you'll end the show. What do you think? No, no, no, I don't feel that way

58:33.320 --> 58:38.760
at all. I know. I mean, I blow things up in my head. So I hear like one tone and I'm like,

58:38.760 --> 58:43.880
yeah, clearly, I'm participating in that somehow or you wouldn't be saying that. Yeah, no, I mean,

58:43.880 --> 58:51.080
I guess. Are you gonna end the show, Dan? Let me think about it. It depends how many people

58:51.080 --> 58:57.000
love me. No, I know, I really don't. That's not my intention. Dan will not end the show. But I mean,

58:57.000 --> 59:06.680
every time I, but I mean, almost every single week since since you started doing the shows here,

59:06.680 --> 59:11.000
I just I come early. So I'm ahead in line. And then I make friends with someone in line. And then

59:11.000 --> 59:15.880
some people come back like a lot. And then we sit next to each other during the show. And then,

59:16.760 --> 59:21.160
you know, I love the show. After listening to the podcast so long, then coming here,

59:21.160 --> 59:28.200
like the first couple shows, which is like, I get really excited by things. So I was like,

59:28.200 --> 59:32.840
completely starstruck. And now it's I've calmed down a little bit. Now you're over it for sure.

59:32.840 --> 59:39.240
No, I'm not over it, sir. I'm just like, now you felt the onstage sadness that goes on up here.

59:39.240 --> 59:44.280
No, I'm just like, my excitement levels are off the charts. Now I can just actually like enjoy

59:44.280 --> 59:49.080
the show without this. I kind of get it in the sense of like, like the podcast that I listen to,

59:49.080 --> 59:54.680
some of them I even like Cody and I talk about like very candidly, in a way that I wouldn't

59:54.680 --> 59:59.560
you like, are we we're hate listening to this podcast, we love this podcast. It's like, the

59:59.560 --> 01:00:06.760
lines blur. But the behavior doesn't change, which is something a guy like me would obsess about.

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:13.800
Like, wait, am I doing good or bad? You like me or hate me. But it's like a podcast that

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:17.800
that people are listening to, they're listening to because it's like part of their family. And

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:24.920
your family, you're like, you're like, Uncle Henry, like, whatever, like, I don't do I do

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:30.360
I admire him? Do I do I think I should do what he says or anything? It's just sort of like,

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:34.280
no, he's Uncle Henry is always there. Because I listen to these podcasts that are like sort of,

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:40.280
if they experiment too much, I actually get mad at them. And I'm kind of like, like, oh,

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:44.760
this guy always does that. And then I put it on and I'm like, then they do something different.

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:49.640
And I'm like, what are you doing? Stop it. Well, I'm not listening for anything other than just

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:54.120
the people that are on the show. You and Spencer and Jeff and then whoever else might be here,

01:00:54.120 --> 01:01:04.280
like, Rob or Brandon or whatever. God bless you. God bless you. I don't need it. I don't need it.

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:08.280
Whoever else. You're doing a great job. You guys are the three that are here every week. Yeah,

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:13.560
also, we are. And there's Brandon. This is exactly what Dan wants to hear. You're doing great.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:18.360
No, that was that specific. I was like, do you need a drink or anything? I wish.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:24.440
Oh, no. Can I pour your drink? You're all right. Do you drink? You don't get high,

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:31.240
but do you drink? Are you driving? Do you pass the popcorn? Don't give them the popcorn.

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:35.160
I was going to offer my popcorn because I had about the same amount left. I'm okay. Thank you.

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:39.880
No, not again. There's not a lot left. Are you sure you want it?

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:47.320
Yes, give it to me. There's not enough left. There's plenty. Look at this.

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:53.080
That's the best stuff. I have to enjoy it really hard out of spite.

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:58.280
You get that bottom of the popcorn bag, toothbreaker shit. That's the saltiest stuff.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:05.880
Don't put it on my bag. Would you say, though, among your top, if you were to grab a couple

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:10.760
words, like an adjective, I present you with a C of adjectives, and I say, Nova.

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:22.440
Nova, pick your, like, here's a handful of adjectives, and you're just grabbing them. Go.

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:33.080
Would you, true or false, from the Dan Harmon thing, you're like, oh, well, honesty. I want

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:37.800
honesty. Dan's going to be honest with me. You're going to grab honesty, right? Transparency.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:46.040
Don't make a sound. I mean, or do because I'm transparent and I'll deal with the fucking hurt

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:52.040
that you just inflicted on me in real time when you're like, because you're such an, you're so

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:58.360
honest, that person that they're like, if he's honest, if he's, fuck you, I'm going to kill myself

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:06.760
and mention you in the note. C3H. You don't even know. That's your seat.

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:11.960
Used to say that a lot. Like, I'm going to write a suicide note. You're going to be in it.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:16.280
Like, it's an awesome, it's an awesome fucking burn, isn't it? It's hard to kill yourself and

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:20.280
mention you in the note. It goes hard. It does not go late at a person like baller.

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:25.080
It's like your version of baller. Yeah. You're balling. I'm a baller, like

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:32.360
depressive kind of every baller. Manic depressive baller. Yeah. But I also don't advocate for.

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:36.440
I got to say, you and Nova, I've just met her, but I've known you for a long time. You guys are

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:44.360
both some real manic depressive ballers. Thanks, man. It's true. But anyway,

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:48.440
Quentin Crisp said in a suicide note, you should never take anybody with you. You should be classy

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:52.760
about it. Like, don't say like, oh, I blame that person. Like, you leave it alone.

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:55.720
I'm trying to figure out. That's why you're a suicide note writer.

01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:02.200
It's a little suicide note. Remember that tonight. Some jokes are funny because they go too far.

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:04.840
Like, I'm going to put you in my suicide note, but it has to be the time and the place,

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.800
like Harmontown is the time and the place, because that's the way that they should know it.

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:13.240
And I have a rich tradition of perfectly blocking the tightrope. I never. Yeah, everyone loves it.

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:21.000
I've never faulted. I mean, yeah, with the honesty thing, it's less honesty, specifically that word.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.600
The word is more authenticity. Like, and like, genuineness or whatever of like, you just come

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:30.520
out here and be yourself. You're not like, okay, this is like, I don't know. I've never really.

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:34.120
So then if that person is going through a crisis where they're like, who the fuck am I?

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:41.400
Then it's like, start things start to get a little bit brektian to borrow a phrase that I

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:47.720
heard a college student once say. I hardly know what it means. But you know, like, it's like,

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:55.240
oh, shit, like, like where that's the thing. Like, oh, hey, the podcast is about me figuring out

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:59.320
what the podcast is. And then you're like, well, that and 50 cents will get me a Snickers.

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:04.040
I mean, I've never like not listened to an episode because you're in a bad mood, but like

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:12.840
I saw I'm dating myself 50 cents once bought you a Snickers that in a pot, a handful of shit will

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:20.040
fill one hand. I don't understand what that was supposed to what that dad's point was. I have no

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:25.640
idea. I can't even begin to kind of be real mean, I think was his point. Yeah, just trying to kind

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:31.720
of be smart. He was sort of indoctrinating his son into a world of substance. He's saying like,

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:38.040
welcome to the world of substance. Like, real things are shit. Anything that fills your hand

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:44.280
is worth something. And that's it. But it's like, things that are real are shit. Are you saying

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:50.920
that because the guy that owns you has a hand full of something invisible called credit? Like,

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:56.120
like, don't you work for a fucking corporation that doesn't even have a hand that is already filled

01:05:56.120 --> 01:06:02.840
with like fucking debt? I know it makes me mad. Fuck dad. Not dad. Yeah. I mean, yeah, but like,

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:08.360
you know, capitalism and stuff. Fuck capitalism and dad. Fuck capitalism and dad. For the same

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:11.640
reason. Except for the narrow window of capitalism that assures me an exit strategy.

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:22.920
It's basically saying don't dream because like, what is a wish? Like, I have to go to work this

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:28.680
morning. He's kind of saying like, let me try to like, like, like, punch up his like, like, like,

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:35.880
like he's like, here's, here's, here's my pitch on what are you saying? Hey, son, poop in one hand

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:44.120
and wish in the other and tell me which gets you more peanuts. Neither. No, poop has peanuts in

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:48.280
it. It's gross, but only if you eat peanuts. It doesn't just have peanuts in it. Magic. No,

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:51.400
poop comes right now. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. Okay. I didn't know

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:58.520
it. You didn't watch Nova. I got one. Hey, I got one. I got one. Eat these peanuts. Hey,

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:03.720
I got now shit in your hand. Hey, I got. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, mine requires a certain

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:10.280
amount of peanuts. I got one shit in one hand. Shit in the other hand.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:17.640
I'd see all the shit in your hand. Yeah. And you can kill them both with one stone, right?

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:22.520
Wish you had some soap and wish and see what happens because you don't have the hand.

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:29.560
There's more shit. Shit in one hand. Shit in the other hand. Look at the mess you made. Now,

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:34.840
go to the bathroom and clean up the shit on your hands before we have dinner. That's life.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:41.880
Shit in one hand. Shit in the other hand. Then you'll find out whether you're left or right-handed.

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:49.640
Which one you drop faster or something? You always poop. Shit in both hands at the same time.

01:07:49.640 --> 01:08:02.040
Rub them on your feet. Roll around in it. Eat the shit. Wish you didn't do that.

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:09.320
And see what happens. And be like, wish for the shit to be gone. See if anything happens,

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:20.120
you know, just like... It's weird that the anti-wish lobby is so adamant about fictionalizing their

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:24.760
metaphors to drive it home. It's like, aren't you a pragmatist? Just tell me, wishes don't mean

01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:31.800
anything. Like, what's with the narrative, fucking anti-wish man? Like, hey, why don't you take a

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:36.680
wish and put it in a dragon's ass? Like, whoa, hey, what are we in Narnia here? I thought wishes

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:41.480
don't mean anything. I think wishes are worth more than shit, at least in this world. Definitely.

01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:46.600
I mean, shit is like literal negative value in most situations. Yeah, you got to wash it off.

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:49.640
You're like, I got to get rid of this. It's a liability. You have work to do. You're like,

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:54.200
I got to get rid of this shit. It's based on classics that actually landed. Like, daddisms,

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:59.720
like for instance, my dad would say, if you would go, well, if we do this and they would do that,

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:06.520
my dad would say, if my aunt had balls, she'd be my uncle. Or if frogs had wings, they would

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:16.120
bump their ass a hoppin'. Ifs and buts were dicks. We'd all have a merry Christmas.

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:21.080
Yeah, it turns out, actually, life caught up to dad. If my aunt had balls, she'd be my uncle. Now

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:26.840
you could say, actually, dad, let's ask them what pronoun they'd prefer. Yeah, I would actually,

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:31.000
a huge thing that I actually really love about the show is that there's been like transgender people

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:36.600
on stage because like, I'm transgender and there's like, they're nowhere to be found. Like, you know,

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:42.920
if birds and bees were poos and bees, I was being sincere. The air would smell all stinky.

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:46.280
Now I'm embarrassed that I brought it up because you made a joke of it.

01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:51.160
No, you felt vulnerable and you felt like you assailed your vulnerability. No, I'm

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:56.440
glad you feel, I'm glad that you feel comfortable about that. I didn't mean to assail your

01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:00.760
vulnerability. That's okay. I love that you've talked about it. It's amazing. I am not a person

01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:06.280
who is. Makes me very happy. I try to police myself being reactive to things like, I sense

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:11.480
my reactions to things like, I'm an old man and then I see something in the headlines and I,

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:15.240
you know, I have that same instinct that other people have. I go, well, now this,

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:19.960
oh brother. Yeah, these bird scooters. I feel like an old man too. I see things like, oh,

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:24.840
this new technology and I'm like, for like, you know, some new culture. I'm like, why are they

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:28.440
doing that? You know, but then I try to go like, well, wait a minute, what are we doing here?

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:33.400
Yeah, I try to be like, okay, so what if people are doing something like either it'll pass or

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:37.400
if it's like not like a dumb thing, then maybe we'll stick around and it'll be fine.

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:44.040
Hey, if you guys, if you guys tried the void, the VR experience, the VR thing at the Glendale

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:49.320
Gallery. Yeah. Yeah. Levy, where is the, I don't mean to be, I think the ice bucket. Oh, yeah,

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:55.320
the ice thing. Yeah. Have you done it? No melting ice bucket. We'll make it happen over time. Okay.

01:10:55.320 --> 01:11:04.840
Spencer? Yes. You have done it? No, no. The void. The VR experience. Yeah, I did it. I did it.

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:11.960
You don't like sincerity. What? Is that you guys don't like sincerity? He really did do the void.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:18.680
Huh? That's honesty. That's true. You're right. I'm sorry for. What? You were talking about

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:26.520
technology, right? I guess. In a way. You were saying there's this new technology. I love what

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:30.440
ever happens on the show. I think Nova's implying that the trans thing. Steve Levy, everybody. Steve

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:38.040
Levy. Thank you. No, we don't need to talk about that though. It's fine. Right. And I think that's

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:41.800
out there. Yeah, they didn't. I just want to say that because I really. Steve Levy walking through

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:44.280
the aisle. I just want to say that because I really do appreciate that about you. It makes

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:48.280
me really, really happy. I'm really glad to hear you say that. I honestly, I need to,

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:53.640
I need to hear that because I often, because I've often in the past like, because like,

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:57.560
like I just, the story of my life is that I just blunder through these minefields and I'm just

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:01.320
like, well, if I just pee myself, then everybody will get the message that I don't mean anybody

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:05.240
any harm. Yeah, that's kind of how I do things too. And it gets a little tricky sometimes. Yeah,

01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:12.120
yeah, it does. I mean, I definitely, yeah, like, I don't mind that you like blunder through things

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:21.160
or whatever. Like I'd rather people talk about things than just pretend. I'd rather. So much.

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:29.560
No, but you're the best, by the way. Thanks. I love you up here.

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:35.560
Yeah, I'd rather people talk about things than like ignore them because they're and try to pretend

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:39.480
they don't exist because they're afraid of messing something up. You know, like I'd rather you like

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:43.960
kind of address it even if you like blunder quote unquote, but that's just me. Like a lot of people

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:47.400
kind of in my circles kind of don't feel that way. They're like, if you say a wrong word,

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:51.480
fuck you, you know, and I'm like, I understand that stuff too. Because I understand like,

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:56.440
like, I mean, I've look, it's been a like the last two years in particular has been a fucking

01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:02.600
crazy roller coaster ride for even my archetype. So like, even before that shit, you why you made

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:06.920
a watch me going up and down and like learning about like, Oh, how do I address this and how

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:11.960
to what language do I use here? And then election happens. And it's like, Oh, now I'm learning,

01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:18.360
like what it's actually like to feel like you're like isolated and that you have no control.

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:25.880
And it's like, welcome to the party from it's, it's, it's very interesting. Like I, I can't

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:31.640
remember what my point was. I'm probably too drunk. But, but I do appreciate that because I'm

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:35.880
trying to listen to books now on tape that are like called like, getting over your addiction to

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:41.960
approval. Like, like, like, I like now at this point in this, this, this, this, this twilight

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:51.000
of my life, like, like my thing, like, like, like, my thing has to be about that's, that's like,

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:58.200
my ironic job is like, I have this like tank of shame that like, it's nobody else's fault that

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:03.080
it's there. And it's like, it has nothing to do with like, whether or not I've paid more dues than

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:08.600
anybody else. It's just a fucking fact that like, I have this crazy battery of filled with shame.

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:14.440
And like anybody that says if somebody says pass the salt, there's a 20% higher chance

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:20.120
that I'll figure out a way to turn it into you didn't pass the salt earlier, you piece of shit,

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:24.840
that it's just, it's just like weird shit like that. Like, like, I got this like fucking bucket

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:31.160
of shame driving me. Absolutely. And so that makes it in particular, like, it's like, Oh,

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:35.960
what's with this approval addiction? Because if you're going to try to get people's approval,

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:39.000
then you're going to run into situations where people are going to say, actually,

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:43.560
I'll take a pass on that you didn't get my approval. And if that's going to make you fly

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:47.480
into a rage, maybe you shouldn't be in the approval game, or maybe you should lose the shame,

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:52.920
etc. So I'm listening to all these fucking like books on tape that are like, hey, like, like,

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:58.680
don't care what people think. But at the same time, like, how does that help? Yeah, I mean,

01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:03.080
it's it's a it's a turbulent mess. And so because it's a turbulent mess, I think that's

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:07.720
the good news about it is that actually, we could we could actually all call out to each other

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:14.920
over a whirlpool, like, actually a quality achieved. If it gets if it gets that chaotic,

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:20.520
we can all be like, I can't tell the difference between anybody right now. I'm pretty sure it's

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:29.880
just us versus a whirlpool. Like, who doesn't want to drown? And everyone goes, yay. And anybody

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:35.960
that says, I do want to drown, it's like, all right, sounds like you're in pain. Like, like,

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:40.200
because why should you want to drown? And anybody that's like, you should drown, I'm not drowning.

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:48.120
It's like, okay, you fucking diluted Nazi. But even then, for agreement says that guy's made of light.

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:56.440
I don't know. I'm going to figure it out with one thing tonight is that Nazis are made of light.

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:05.240
I refuse that to be the title of the show. Are you saying we shouldn't call it

01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:10.200
Nazis are made of light? Yeah, I mean, I definitely get the like approval thing and like the built

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:14.280
in shame thing of like, I'll totally apologetically be myself all the time. But if anybody calls me

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:20.840
on anything, I'll be like, you're right. I'm like, hey, it's totally cool. However,

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:24.360
past the salt is fine. You know, it's all good. And then if anybody were to be like,

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:27.480
why'd you pass the salt like that? Even if it wasn't super mean, I'd just be like,

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:30.360
you're right. I'm a piece of shit. I didn't pass it right. I need to figure out exactly how to pass

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:37.880
it right. Otherwise, like, you know, I'm really cool with people asking me to pass the salt.

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:43.000
That's nice. If they want the salt, everything's a fucking competition with you.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:50.840
And it's on my side of the table. I could stop for two seconds, two microns,

01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:58.360
and pass the salt over to somebody. Maybe I've been using it. Maybe I've been bow guarding the salt.

01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:01.560
God damn it. He finally wins. I've known this guy for 80 years.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:07.320
Feels like it. I met him in Amber. That's how old we are.

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:15.080
In where? Amber. It's like just resin. We were both on top of a Brontosaurus.

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:20.200
And I was like, hello. And he was like, hi. And then we got bored out and shipped here.

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:25.160
We're a thousand years old. Yeah, I had a friend for like six years, which is a long time when

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:28.360
you're like a teenager or whatever. And it's like, yeah, by the end, we just like hate each other

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:31.160
and stuff. You know, it's like, all right, he's still my best friend. I don't know.

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:33.160
Yeah, the closest people and all that shit.

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:40.520
Yeah. But you know, it's kind of like, like, you know, the thing I'm like,

01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:44.600
I'm listening to the self esteem book. And the thing that blew my mind that actually

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:47.960
really challenged me because I was like, fuck, they took that away from me, too,

01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:53.720
is self loathing. It's like, it's it's another fucking dodge. That's the thing.

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:58.360
I just realized that the other day, like it blew, I was in my shower, I was in my shower,

01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:02.760
and I had to get out of the shower. Well, it's just another way of like giving

01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:06.920
into yourself critic. And like, you're basically doing it. It's a dodge. It's like a,

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:11.400
it's like a checkkiting scheme. It's an excuse. If you were to say to me, like, oh,

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:15.240
you said some transphobic shit in the last podcast. And if I were to go,

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:20.200
yeah, I'm a piece of fucking shit. I'm so fucking transphobic. What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:23.800
You know, and if I then you're like, it's like, I'm an apology or anything like that. Yeah,

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:28.280
I'm like, it's not a real wreck turning it on you. Right. And like, also, I'm just like avoiding

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:31.880
everything. I do that to you turn into the victim. You're like, Oh, I feel bad, you know,

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:35.320
so like, you know, I don't know. When I was a kid, if anyone ever accused me of like, Oh,

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:39.320
you were mean to this person, which like I never was, it was just like, if someone misinterpreted

01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:43.560
something I said or something, and like, I would just immediately just burst into tears,

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:47.560
because, and it was like legitimate. I wasn't faking it of like, Oh, what was me,

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:52.120
but maybe like unconsciously I was, I don't know. Well, I did. Well, it fucking hurts to think

01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:55.800
it feels better to be the victim. Don't like you. It fucking hurts to the worst thing that could

01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:59.960
ever happen. Yeah, absolutely. Like you could hit me in the face with a two by four. I would take

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:04.920
that over. Like when I was on the playground, and people would punch me, like the thing that would

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:09.320
make me cry would be somebody coming up and sticking up for me and going like, Hey, leave

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:14.760
him alone. And then I'd start crying, because it'd be like, Oh, I'm like causing everybody like,

01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:19.000
Oh, like you're like making people like have to pay attention to you or something.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:25.320
Cool guy now has to take time out of his day. Oh, I'm fine with this piece of shit, like

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:29.240
fucking hit me harder. Like it only makes me stronger. Like now this fucking cool dude's

01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:35.800
got to come up like fucking pony boy. And yeah, like, it doesn't even have to be like people

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:41.240
liking you. It's just like a first and a tears ability. No, don't just stick up for me. You

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:48.200
went to school with Ralph Machio. Wow. I mean, it was 83 every. Yes, we all did. Okay. You said

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:53.800
you looked like Ralph Machio. Spencer, what was your shower epiphany? Just what Dan was saying.

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:59.720
Like a self hatred is like just an excuse to not really like it's a stopping point because

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:06.920
you're like, Oh, should I should I go exercising? No, I hate myself. I don't have to do that.

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:11.000
But it's like, well, no, you thought of the exercising because that's something probably

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:15.080
important that you should do. And you shouldn't just stop thinking about it by short cutting

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:19.640
it with I hate myself. And yeah, so I think that's what he was getting at is it's a dodge.

01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:24.200
Anything you're kind of focusing on yourself, you're basically shutting down those avenues

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:27.800
that we're going to be frustrating, which is connection where you might be accountable.

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:31.880
You might have to do the awkward, painful thing of like not being a hero or a villain and just

01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:39.640
saying to somebody, Oh, did I like hard like just regular person that maybe is or isn't

01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:44.280
high maintenance, like a maybe should or shouldn't be my friend and isn't a hero or a villain, but

01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:52.600
just is saying I'd prefer it if you gave me Splendid instead of sweet and low, like the

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:57.000
tendency to go like, fuck this bitch, like fuck this shit, like fuck people and I'm going to

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.720
give as much as I take and or is going like, Yeah, I'm a piece of shit. I can't do anything. Right.

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:05.800
Both of those are the same. There are alternatives to just going like, Okay, cool. So Splendid

01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:12.280
next time. But also sometimes self loathing feels but also sometimes the self loathing as opposed

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:15.800
to turning it out on other people can feel safer because you feel like you're not hurting anyone.

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:20.120
No, you feel like that's fine. That's like classic fucked up shit where you're like,

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:23.880
I mean, you're like, like no offense to people who actually have their doing this. I'm saying

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:28.680
like, like, like, we know this manifestation where people are like, I'm gonna fucking cut myself

01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:33.160
until you call me back and all that shit. Like that's, that's an instinct that humans have,

01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:38.040
like because we it'll it'll give you a dopamine spike doesn't work back to that comfort place.

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:44.760
What, what did you, what did you just say? Villain, we found a villain. Now I'm comfortable.

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:51.480
He said, he said, we're boring. No, I didn't. He said, no, it's not. I said, it doesn't work.

01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:55.560
It doesn't work. Oh, okay. Well, we agree with that. So it's fine. We'll look the other way while I

01:21:55.560 --> 01:22:04.360
dry my eyes. And I'm comfortable in this awesome chair that I got for you. You're welcome. You

01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:09.720
I haven't stopped smiling. Yeah, I mean, that maybe that's why I love Harmonytone so much,

01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:13.480
because I see so much myself in you and stuff. And also, like, you're in your 40s. So I'm like,

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:19.480
okay, cool, like, you know, if that's the worst that could happen. Yeah, you're like, I'm not

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:24.280
kidding. I mean, I would like to think that honestly, because I was like, you know, like,

01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:31.320
honestly, if the worst it gets is like, like, I can still be like fumbling around in 45. And

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:36.520
like, it's cool. That's that is like, that's what I want to hear. Yeah, I don't I don't know,

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:40.200
I don't pay a lot of attention to stuff made by people like my age, because I'm like, well,

01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:48.600
what do you have to offer me? Oh, more and more every year. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. That's glib.

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:53.800
I guess any fantasy requests as far as like segments, like, like, like, if you if you could

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:59.880
just fantasize about like, you're listening to it, you're, you're, I can't remember what you said you

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:07.320
were. What your ideal is that? Oh, yeah, you're playing Sims and you listen to podcasts. So any

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:13.080
like, you're like, God, I wish they would do like a top 10 list or just any kind of my favorite parts

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:18.600
of all time of the show are when this is not a fantasy thing. This happens constantly. My favorite

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:30.040
part of any episode is when you D&D. Wait, sorry, sorry, I cut you off. Yeah, what are you gonna

01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:36.040
say now? Is the is the beginning when you come out and you have funny stories from your life of

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:39.640
like something weird happened with a dog door, or even just someone ran into my garage, because I'm

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:43.080
very lonely and pathetic. And it feels like I have a friend, you know, who's like telling me about

01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:48.840
something that I actually am not bored by. And, you know, or it's funny or like this, the, you

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:53.320
know, people beat the little light at the, you know, whatever. Yeah, yeah, and it probably feels

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:59.160
good. I would imagine I hope that to know that like, oh, if I fantasize about slowly getting

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:03.640
richer and richer, that I realize that that actually just constricts your life experience

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:09.320
down to this like dilated, like, like, Harmon just keeps talking about how his toilet works.

01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:16.280
It kind of like, I guess I'm more, I have more flower petals when I'm 25. I don't know if that

01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:20.360
segment of the show has a bigger meaning for me. That's like the funniest part of the show. I

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:24.520
always think about I just go like, well, what is that? What is comedy? It's like, you're supposed

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:29.240
to be drawing from living your life. And then I just think about like, I think the only person

01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:34.440
that's nailed it so far is Larry David, because he migrated to HBO and then was like, literally,

01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:40.600
like, this is a show about me arguing with my gardener. And I'd like, but you think like,

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:47.400
that is genuinely the progression. Like, if you're, if you are successful at getting people to

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:54.600
laugh, like you, you are rewarded in our glorious society to a level where you're like, I no longer,

01:24:55.880 --> 01:25:01.320
you don't have, I, the top of this podcast is I would come out and I would go, like, I'm so sick

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:07.000
of people telling me to tie my shoes. You said that a lot. Like, I that that would be a such a

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.720
dishonest thing right now. I would come out, I would have to come out now and say, I'm so sick

01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:15.960
of the guilt that comes with knowing that everyone's afraid to tell me anything about my shoes or

01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:21.080
else they'll get fired. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, you self advocate enough and then you're like, it's not

01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:25.800
relatable. And it's also a little uncomfortable. And it doesn't, it's like, there's a little bit of

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:31.800
a loop there. But it's honest. Well, it's also when I wanted to be. It's a way like, you know,

01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:36.680
but also like, like, who want, yeah, like, yeah, I do get that about comedy for sure. Like, I talk

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:40.280
about like acting like I don't need to be famous. And that's what I know I like. But I fantasized

01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:45.000
a lot about maybe enjoying being a standup comic, or making like a sitcom or something where like,

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.480
I create the characters, and then I can express darker things, you know, like I can kind of

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:54.760
express less savory things, because it's funny. You know, like, I don't have to, I don't, yeah.

01:25:54.760 --> 01:26:00.760
Let me give you a choice between, but without like, if you, because I think like, as far as like,

01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:06.280
guests that we would book, like, in terms of categories, like your favorite, like,

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:11.160
screenwriters, like, like people that do what I do, me talking to them,

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:22.280
anti-fascist activists, who feel the way I feel about, about not going gently into

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:27.960
this fucking horrible night, at the risk of depressing all of us, and also offending like,

01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:34.520
the 30% of us who are more than welcome here. And then, what's-

01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:35.480
30%?

01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:39.320
Oh my god.

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:46.600
Look, my math is notoriously wrong, but I still get a weird feeling it's going to turn out to be

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:52.600
right. But, but, and then, I don't know, there's a third category you could, you could make it up,

01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:55.240
but like, like, like, I can't, like, like, like, should I, I should just have-

01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:56.680
Trash delivery!

01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:04.040
Or, or like, Paul, you're too young, you remember, Paul Appoundstone had a show on a

01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:08.440
showtire or HBO or something, and she would just have like, literally like, a firefighter,

01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:11.960
or like, meter maid, or something like, like, like, like, like, she would just, like, it was

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:14.280
sort of like, these are the people in your neighborhood, kind of like-

01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:17.400
Like, we went, like, when we had the guy who, like, worked at Target and, like, knew about

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:21.320
all the targets and stuff, like, he knew all the insider stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:22.440
Well, I probably don't remember that one.

01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:23.400
Maybe it was just, like, from the audience.

01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:24.760
It was, like, Scoota or something.

01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:25.880
Scoota, yeah, that was Scoota.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.200
Let's get Scoota back, huh? That guy was hot.

01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:33.240
I know, I wish there were, like, there's, like, no, there's, like, hardly anybody here-

01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:35.960
Let's get him a, let's get him a line of Scoota, and he can Scoota back over.

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:40.040
That was good, that was good. I don't know why that didn't get the response.

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:41.880
The third category would be like, like, like-

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:43.240
No, that, that's honesty.

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:46.680
My callbacks are so fucking rich and dense that people really can't-

01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:48.840
You're too smart for the room, Jeff.

01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:49.240
Oh, yeah.

01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:50.600
Oh, yeah.

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:52.520
I can go, I can go, I can go and say,

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:55.880
let's book Edward Newmeyer, he wrote Robocop, let's book, like, like,

01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:57.720
I just go, like, all the screenwriters, you know?

01:27:57.720 --> 01:27:59.720
Like, I would just want to reach out to all the screenwriters,

01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:02.680
but then is my show just, like, Elvis Mitchell?

01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:07.800
Like, like, I'm just talking, well, page 10 of Robocop, and you chose to do this,

01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:09.480
you know, like, I don't know.

01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:13.320
Let's get people that are way too, like, fancy for us,

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:15.400
but they have to do yoga with Dave Kline.

01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:16.840
Let's get-

01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:19.480
Oh, yeah, I was one of the people who came up and did that, that was weird.

01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:20.920
That was awesome, that was amazing.

01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:22.360
It was wild.

01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:24.440
That was, that was wild, that's exactly the word I would use.

01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:24.920
Oh, yeah.

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:27.080
You're telling me.

01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:28.200
Should we try a little D&D?

01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:31.560
Yeah, I mean, well, let's let Nova plug her album.

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:35.640
Yeah, Nova, what's your, your new record comes out?

01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:37.640
Oh, sorry, but what is your pronoun?

01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:41.240
Sorry, I kept you referring to you as her, and you said you were trans.

01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:43.000
I don't know.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.240
It's, you're up in the air.

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:49.880
If I, if I, if I had my wish, I would use they, but a lot of people don't want to use they.

01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:51.880
It's, it's, it's, well, we're catching up.

01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:54.120
It's like, it's gonna, it might take a little time.

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:56.360
They're, they're, they're, yeah.

01:28:58.200 --> 01:28:59.000
He is good too.

01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:01.800
They're all fine.

01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:02.680
Awesome.

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:08.120
Awesome. What's the, what's the, what's the, do you want to, do you want to deliver any

01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:13.880
parting, look this up, go to this, go to that, donate to this, like anything.

01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:14.760
This is your chance.

01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:15.880
Hey, catch me on Tumblr.

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:20.840
That's the only thing I do that's visible to any other people.

01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:23.640
Have you seen my post, my post about almond milk?

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:25.560
No, do you have a Tumblr?

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:28.120
Some people talk about my post about almond milk.

01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:29.080
I don't like almond milk.

01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:30.040
I don't like it either.

01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:31.160
You might enjoy my post.

01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:34.040
I, I, I can't, I can't stop talking about your almond milk.

01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:35.000
I would enjoy that post.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:35.720
It's not sweet.

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:37.240
Well, they're sweet, but that's not good either.

01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:38.120
I mean, don't search it out.

01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:40.280
But if you see it, it has a lot of notes.

01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:41.160
Are you on Tumblr?

01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:42.200
I was, yeah.

01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:42.840
Oh, not anymore.

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:43.800
Not, not actively.

01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:44.280
Yeah.

01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:44.440
Sorry.

01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:45.960
I love almond milk.

01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:47.000
Yeah.

01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:48.440
Well, that's nice.

01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:50.600
That's fine.

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:51.880
All right, let's give it up for Nova, everybody.

01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:52.600
Thank you so much.

01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:53.000
Nova.

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:55.480
Thanks for joining us up here.

01:29:55.480 --> 01:30:01.000
Thank you.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:02.520
Thanks so much.

01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:10.120
Dan.

01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:11.000
That was fun, huh?

01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:12.200
Yeah.

01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:12.520
Dan.

01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:14.440
But.

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:17.880
Dan, that was very, that was a very emotional,

01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:19.320
very sensitive talk.

01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:20.680
Don't fucking mock me.

01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:21.640
No, you look very,

01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:24.840
this is something I haven't seen in a while.

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:27.480
You know, whatever, anything that happened to value

01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:29.800
between me and this guest.

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:30.600
I enjoyed it.

01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:32.200
It was in spite of you.

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:34.120
Why, why, why?

01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:37.480
And you have no right now to patronize.

01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:37.880
I'm not.

01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:39.720
And, and I mean just.

01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:42.520
I'm trying to give you a compliment.

01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:43.800
I'm saying you did a great job.

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:46.040
I hear your dog whistle blowing.

01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:49.800
I hear your dog whistle blowing.

01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:50.680
Hey, Dan, I hear your, Dan.

01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:53.720
And I feel your bellow call.

01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:54.120
Dan, come on.

01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:57.320
I hear your dog whistle blowing.

01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:00.680
You always do this song when I'm trying to get serious.

01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:02.280
This fake Johnny Cash song.

01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:05.960
You always do this Ursat's Johnny Cash needle drop

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.000
that you don't have to pay for.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:07.400
Yeah.

01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:11.640
I hear that dog whistle blowing.

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:13.640
I want to, I want to hear all of this stuff.

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:16.120
What happened, what happened to you over the weekend

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:16.600
that you were.

01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:19.480
Because the rim of my cup.

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:21.320
What happened to you?

01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:25.880
The cup full of bullets and the prisons.

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:27.480
What's up?

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:30.520
I'm Johnny Cash.

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:33.400
I'm going round.

01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:38.280
I've never felt this forest found.

01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:45.400
I'd eat a million redwood trees and drove a Chevy to the dam.

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:51.160
And I spent a night in prison and I ate your mama's ham.

01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:54.760
I'm Johnny Cash.

01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:57.320
I was in prison.

01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:00.600
I'm Johnny Cash.

01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:02.600
I invented the prism.

01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:10.680
I was there when Isaac Newton's apple fell on top of his tawny head.

01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:19.080
And I took him to Falson prison and I had sex with his head.

01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:27.240
And because when you're tough, you sing.

01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:34.440
Country Western high security wing.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:41.240
Johnny Cash, ring of fire, potato man, tire wire.

01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:46.200
I've eaten that redwood tree and I'm free.

01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:49.640
Johnny Cash.

01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:50.040
Sorry.

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:51.400
I'm sorry.

01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:53.560
I am my only entertaining myself.

01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:54.520
Steve Levy plays in D&D, everybody.

01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:57.400
Levy, are you out there?

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:00.280
Are you amongst?

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.600
Every time I try to take it to a serious place, you got to sing that song.

01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:06.840
Steve Levy to the stage.

01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:07.960
Here he is, everybody.

01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:08.440
Hell yeah.

01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:13.640
I like to sing from the heart.

01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:16.920
That's the laziest hand shake.

01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:17.720
May it come to me.

01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:19.000
Shake my hand.

01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:20.680
Shake, don't.

01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:21.320
Put it down.

01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:23.080
Our time is short, Spence.

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:23.480
I'm sorry.

01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:25.160
Wait, Spence, there's a thing.

01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:26.440
Don't you have a thing, Spence?

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:28.360
I got way too many things.

01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:30.200
Holy shit, you guys.

01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:30.920
I got things.

01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:37.240
First of all, Dan, Nova said the favorite part of the show was when, at the beginning,

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:40.200
when you're telling the stories, did you clock that as like, oh yeah,

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:43.640
when I have all this great stuff prepared, that's when you enjoy it?

01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:47.560
No, because I never really, I never flattered myself

01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:51.160
was thinking that that's when the stuff's good.

01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:51.960
Oh, it's great.

01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:54.120
We heard it from the source.

01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:58.760
Well, that seems like a, yeah, I mean, like, oh, my favorite part of the broccoli

01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:00.840
is the pad of butter on top of it.

01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:01.560
Yeah.

01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:02.600
Well, tough titties.

01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:05.000
It's broccoli.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:05.800
Yeah.

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:08.360
Yeah, I know, but I, yeah, they, I sure.

01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:11.080
I just wanted to ask, I'd forget behind stage, backstage.

01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:14.360
Is that like a subtle note from you that you're like, I wish you prepared more?

01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:17.560
No, I just, that was what I, that was what my interpretation and I was like,

01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:18.920
well, Dan hates himself too.

01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:20.760
I wonder if that was his interpretation.

01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:24.120
Yeah, but you don't want to, you don't want to put more anxiety on me about

01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:25.160
preparing for the show.

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:27.160
No, you don't have to do any of that.

01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:30.520
I wanted to, if you felt that way, tell you not to.

01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:33.400
But look what I've done instead.

01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:37.400
I feel like you're flipping the script on me where you're like,

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:40.280
yeah, your D&D is your whole fucking shitty show.

01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:41.560
No, no, no, no, no.

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:44.600
How would you like it if everyone was relying on you to prepare stuff

01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:45.640
and you were unprepared?

01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:47.560
No, no, this is, that was not my intent.

01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:51.480
I see how obvious it is to see now that that's how it reads.

01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:54.680
This is all, this is like last week all over again.

01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:58.200
We have to, we have to learn to have empathy

01:34:58.200 --> 01:34:59.960
or we're never going to communicate with each other.

01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:00.520
Yeah, man.

01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:01.800
It's rough out there.

01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:02.520
Look what I just did.

01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:04.440
I just did the thing that we were talking about where I'm like,

01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:06.280
oh, you hate me because I do this and like,

01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:07.640
I'm doing that because I'm not communicating.

01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:08.520
I do that too.

01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:09.160
It's great.

01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:10.840
I'm working through it together.

01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:13.000
You're a good friend and you've been my friend forever.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:13.080
Yeah, man.

01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:14.920
And like, you're great.

01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:15.880
We're going to do it.

01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:16.840
Yeah, all right.

01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:17.560
Tonight.

01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:19.000
That's more awkward to say than I hate myself.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:19.560
No, it's cool.

01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:20.600
I appreciate you saying that.

01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:20.760
And?

01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:21.800
I feel the same way.

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:22.280
And?

01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:23.320
Rob's good too.

01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:23.720
And?

01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:24.440
Rob's not right.

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:26.120
He has his moments, but Jesus Christ,

01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:27.640
tonight has featured none of them.

01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:31.320
So that was, no, you had some moments.

01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:33.560
That was thing one.

01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:39.320
Thing two is in my news update, my dad has a VCR now.

01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:40.520
Whoa.

01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:45.640
He got a VCR from a Harmontown fan named Alejandro,

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:47.400
who lives in the area.

01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:49.800
And he hooked my dad up with a VCR,

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:53.160
and he's going to watch the VHS tapes he has

01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:56.280
and see if it's among them, the Goonies thing.

01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:57.720
The Goonies commercial.

01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:01.160
Yeah, we're not sure he has it, but we will find out soon.

01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:03.960
Will you explain to the people who haven't heard the other

01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:05.640
episode what we're talking about?

01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:08.920
So when I was a kid, I was maybe in a Goonies commercial

01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:13.080
that my dad shot, and he put it on local cable TV

01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:14.840
or local TV or something.

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:17.240
And it might exist, and everyone but me

01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:18.040
thought that was cool.

01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:18.760
So?

01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:24.120
I'm going to melt if I ever see that.

01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:26.600
It's sure to be a letdown.

01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:27.560
There's no way it's not.

01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:30.680
No, I'm glad if you like it.

01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:31.320
That'll be good.

01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:35.080
I think just seeing you as a kid is good enough.

01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:35.800
Sure.

01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:38.680
I got a beard and everything.

01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:40.600
All right, Spencer, it's been 1,000 years.

01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:41.560
One more thing.

01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:43.640
Oh, yeah, you got your chest of magic over here.

01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:46.040
I actually, I don't want to alarm anybody,

01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:48.440
but I actually started another podcast.

01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:50.280
It's about being a dungeon master,

01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:51.240
and I'm giving advice to dungeon masters.

01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:54.760
I saw that shit in the most awkward way possible,

01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:57.160
which is Instagram just browsing.

01:36:57.160 --> 01:36:58.120
Right.

01:36:58.120 --> 01:36:59.320
I knew it.

01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:00.760
It's just D&D.

01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:02.120
It's just DMing.

01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:03.480
It's not comedy.

01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:04.920
It's not funny.

01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:06.440
It's not entertaining.

01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:08.200
It's like going to class.

01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:09.720
It's studying.

01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:10.680
It's not good.

01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:12.440
It's where we talk shit about us.

01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:13.640
Yeah.

01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:17.400
So you can hear me talking shit about six or seven episodes

01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:19.320
in when I'm sure Dan hasn't listened to anything.

01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:19.960
Right.

01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:22.200
All right, Spencer, I'm going to my second level

01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:25.000
druid spells, and I'm going to lay some heavy shit on you.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.080
OK.

01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:30.520
I guarantee you, I'm going to chill metal on this one.

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:31.640
It's called Master Manual.

01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:32.840
You can check it out.

01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:34.120
Yeah, well, I was just going to say completely that.

01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:35.320
I'm also on another.

01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:38.440
Master Manual, not on Starburn's audio.

01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:40.600
Well, you know, they can court us.

01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:45.720
I'm not opposed to it.

01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:46.600
Make an offer.

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:51.560
I'm on a.

01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:52.920
You know what I'm saying?

01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:56.760
I know exactly what you're saying.

01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:00.040
And I don't predict you'll be coming over.

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:01.480
That's a self deprecating statement.

01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:01.960
Sure.

01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:03.400
Yeah, I mean, I'm open to it.

01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:05.240
I think you should hold yourself to a higher standard.

01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:08.440
Well, I hold myself to a higher standard.

01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:09.480
I'm on a podcast.

01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:10.360
Another D&D podcast.

01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:11.640
Oh, yeah, Fear Initiative.

01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:13.000
Fear Initiative on the Blum House.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.720
What the fuck, you know?

01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:16.280
Hey, you snooze.

01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:16.680
You lose.

01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:17.400
Suck my dick.

01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:17.960
Let's play.

01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:27.240
And they're so nice to me over there.

01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:29.080
They're so nice.

01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:32.360
I walk in and go, Rob, how you doing?

01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:34.040
What did you do this weekend?

01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:35.000
That's nice.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:35.640
How did it?

01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:36.920
What are your dreams?

01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:37.480
What are you?

01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:38.120
What did you?

01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:39.720
What are your interests?

01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:41.240
That's really cool.

01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:41.800
Wow.

01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:42.280
All right, Spencer.

01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:42.920
I'm listening.

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:44.120
Give him three weeks.

01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:45.640
Catch us all up because it's been a thousand years.

01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:47.800
Wait, Spencer, isn't there a thing that you wanted to play?

01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:49.160
What are you talking about?

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:50.440
I thought there's a video clip.

01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:51.560
Oh, yeah, that'll be later.

01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:52.360
Oh, OK, cool.

01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:53.960
I got a video clip.

01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:54.680
I knew.

01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:56.120
I didn't know what you were talking about.

01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:58.360
Yeah, speaking of preparedness, this guy.

01:38:58.360 --> 01:38:59.800
It's the Goonies.

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:00.280
No.

01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:01.560
Yeah, no, it's not.

01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:04.600
Was your laptop in the freezer?

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:05.960
What's that?

01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:07.560
I'm sorry, Jeff.

01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:08.680
OK, never mind.

01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:09.240
This angle.

01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:11.080
My iPad finger's getting sore over here.

01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:11.880
Oh, no.

01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:12.600
Yeah, go ahead, Rob.

01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:16.120
Let's all pray for Jeff.

01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:17.480
Dick's out for Jeff.

01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:19.960
Jeff's out for Jeff.

01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:21.480
Let's find this path.

01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:22.920
Man, remember Harambe?

01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:23.720
Good times.

01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:24.360
Oh, man.

01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:25.000
Simpler times.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:29.160
Why are we trolling involved caring about a gorilla?

01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:31.240
Instead of a president?

01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:32.840
Yeah, good times.

01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:33.720
Sorry, Jeff.

01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:37.560
I know how much you've been needing this.

01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:40.040
Sorry, I'm sorry.

01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:41.560
Last time on Harmon.

01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:42.280
One more thing.

01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:42.760
Yeah.

01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:49.480
You see, there's happy time murders, movie.

01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:52.200
I'm aware of it.

01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:55.880
Apparently, it didn't do well this last weekend.

01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:57.160
It did not, yeah.

01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:02.120
Apparently, people weren't ready for the happy time murders.

01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:02.840
OK, go.

01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:05.000
OK.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.680
There's edges, and then there's cutting edges.

01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:11.320
And society is not ready for the cutting edges.

01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:12.920
They cut too many edges.

01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:14.840
All right, what are you telling me?

01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:17.320
A muppet is doing something.

01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:18.200
What the heck?

01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:19.080
Wait a minute.

01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:20.280
Hold on a second.

01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:22.360
I got a rule for muppets in my life,

01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:25.160
and it ain't got nothing to do with this other business.

01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:29.720
Puppets are supposed to teach me how to spell, not murder.

01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:31.480
Next thing you're telling me, Bugs Bunny's

01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:32.520
got a cup in his hand.

01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:33.400
What are you telling me?

01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:35.560
Get the fuck out of here with this shit.

01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:37.240
Get the fuck out of there with him.

01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:41.480
You can pry my 70-year-old IP from my cold, dead fingers.

01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:43.240
I'm not doing this.

01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:45.960
I'm not watching no murders.

01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:47.320
Happy, sad, angry murders.

01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:51.160
Falling people that go like this are limited to my childhood.

01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:55.320
Crank yankers every commercial since 1970.

01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:57.320
And a fourth season of Community.

01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:57.800
Let's go.

01:40:57.800 --> 01:40:58.800
Goddamn it!

01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:02.600
Last time.

01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:04.480
You're in good company, happy time.

01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:06.680
Go for it, please.

01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:08.040
It was under my protest.

01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:09.920
It was written on a whiteboard.

01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:10.400
Keep going.

01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:11.960
Do not do it.

01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:13.560
You're killing your own show.

01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:14.360
Come on, let's go.

01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:20.600
It said that the billboards say no sesame, all street.

01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:21.920
It doesn't make any sense.

01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:23.200
It doesn't realize that.

01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:23.720
They got it.

01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:25.880
That's the actual billboard that I drove by.

01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:27.240
Somebody needed something.

01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:29.600
I would say give me a little more sesame

01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:31.960
on a little less street.

01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:36.000
You've got to find that Sesame Street sweet spot.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.600
Sesame Street was already heavily street.

01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:40.440
Yeah.

01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:42.040
That was actually the fucking point of the show.

01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:43.280
That was the point, yeah.

01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:45.480
That was truly the point of the show.

01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:47.840
It was like saying, I was like, look at these kids.

01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:49.480
I mean, Mr. Hooper died.

01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:51.120
Let's go.

01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:53.000
Last time on Harmontown.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:53.720
One more thing.

01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:55.080
Yeah.

01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:56.400
It's obviously a joke.

01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:57.000
It's a good joke.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.360
Lower the flag.

01:41:58.360 --> 01:41:59.080
It's a funny joke.

01:41:59.080 --> 01:41:59.640
It's a funny joke.

01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:01.240
It's been working a lot.

01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:04.680
Will you please lower the flag?

01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:06.080
He deserves to be honored.

01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:07.960
You haven't said anything about Senator McCain.

01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:08.920
You've said nothing.

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:10.480
Oh, yeah.

01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:11.800
Well, I think that, um.

01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:15.240
Can we honor the senator from, since 1986,

01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:17.880
he was the governor of Arizona, Jesus Christ.

01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:20.440
I'm just mad at people telling other people what to do.

01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:22.240
It's just like, everybody shut the fuck up.

01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:23.960
Well, just tell us he's a hero.

01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:24.560
Or don't.

01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:25.640
Just shut the fuck up.

01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:27.280
Just everybody shut the fuck up.

01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:28.120
Just shut up.

01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:29.960
Just shut the fuck up.

01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:31.160
Just shut up.

01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:32.000
But you haven't done it.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.520
You haven't told us he's a hero yet.

01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:34.360
I don't care.

01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:36.360
I'm just going to shut the fuck up.

01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:37.320
Because it doesn't matter.

01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:38.040
That's what I want.

01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:39.440
I don't want to hear about John McCain.

01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:41.200
I don't not want to hear about John McCain.

01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:43.320
I want everybody to shut the fuck up.

01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:44.760
Quit trying to pull shit.

01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:46.120
It doesn't fucking matter.

01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:48.120
Yeah.

01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:49.760
Now I'm going to bring him back.

01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:52.280
And that's also, that sounds like it's about D&D.

01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:55.880
It truly is about John McCain's death.

01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:57.280
Just shut the fuck up.

01:42:57.280 --> 01:42:58.160
I don't care.

01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:00.160
Yeah.

01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:01.120
It's my favorite.

01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:03.360
It's become my favorite episode of the show ever.

01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:04.480
This is a good episode.

01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:05.440
Yeah.

01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:06.240
I never thought.

01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:07.800
I didn't like where I came out here.

01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:09.080
We had Nova.

01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:11.600
Now we've gone Supernova.

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:12.800
Supernova.

01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:16.200
Nova was the gateway to a satisfying episode.

01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:16.760
Hell, man.

01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:18.040
We broke free.

01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:18.320
OK.

01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:19.520
We have 30 seconds for D&D.

01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:20.020
OK.

01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:20.280
Here we go.

01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:21.200
It's good.

01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:22.160
It's going to be great.

01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:24.680
Last time on Harmontown, our heroes,

01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:26.480
they were at a new town.

01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:26.960
What was it?

01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:28.360
The town of Doronester.

01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:30.760
They were searching for Patchen's gem.

01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:32.320
They found Patchen's gem.

01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:36.080
But they lost Patchen's and set the town on fire.

01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:37.480
They left the town.

01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:39.320
And they were looking for Patchen's

01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:41.840
when they got a crow from their friend brother

01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:43.760
Absalon from the church.

01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:46.000
He was like, you're being reassigned.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.600
We need your help over this way at this other place

01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:53.720
where they're having a log jam at the stone mines.

01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:55.760
And so you were heading over there

01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:57.040
in the hope that Patchen's would

01:43:57.040 --> 01:43:58.960
be in that general direction.

01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:02.680
Then you ran into a cult, a cult of exercise people.

01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:06.040
You exercised with them and then left.

01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:08.000
Then you came across another cult.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.680
This new cult was more culty and less fun than the last cult.

01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:15.360
They were summoning something, a demon.

01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:19.800
For some strange reason, and I thought of this over and over,

01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:22.440
for some very strange and out of character reason,

01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:24.000
two of the characters who I can't even

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.080
remember their identities, they helped the cult summon

01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:33.280
a demon, which is the antithesis of their jobs.

01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:35.920
We left them in the middle of the ritual,

01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:39.080
a gateway opening in the floor, giant pentagrams

01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:40.560
scrawled into the earth.

01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:44.520
And through that game way, a giant, giant fucking demon

01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:48.840
arm was shooting forth into the material plane.

01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:50.120
All right.

01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:51.120
Yeah.

01:44:51.120 --> 01:45:06.080
So gate has opened up and a huge, this seems like it's maybe

01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:10.360
a 30-foot tall demon's arm is bursting out of the ground.

01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:12.440
Well, not out of the ground, out of the hole in the ground

01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:14.880
that was formed by magic, a portal.

01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:17.120
And his hand is raising way up.

01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:18.360
Yeah, he's like crawling.

01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:21.960
He's reaching around trying to pull himself out of this portal

01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:23.120
right now.

01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:25.440
Could this be our savior?

01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:28.120
You guys are religious.

01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:30.840
Your job is to smite evil.

01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:33.960
It's a big part of this whole thing.

01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:35.520
I mean, you can turn against that,

01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:38.160
but just let me know so I can know what to do.

01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:39.000
We're doing our jobs.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.080
We want this thing to come through so we could smite it.

01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:42.600
Yeah, let's fucking go.

01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:43.800
Let's smite this demon.

01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:44.800
Let's start smiting.

01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:46.920
He just asked if it was evil.

01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:48.200
Now you want to smite it.

01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:52.040
Yeah, I'm just keeping my eye on you.

01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:53.240
We're trying to have a good time.

01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:53.920
Oh, yeah.

01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:55.480
Oh, yeah, I got a high road here.

01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:58.440
I shoot a fire bolt at the demon arm.

01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:00.280
All right, I got to get my dice.

01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:04.080
Oh, you didn't have your fucking dice out.

01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:07.920
You're all that fucking bluster.

01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:09.120
Got to get his dice out.

01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:13.480
Well, while you're doing the dice, go ahead.

01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:14.400
You're doing it already.

01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:17.160
All right, it's a mutant of fire being a demon,

01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:18.200
but you do hit it.

01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:19.800
OK, well, that's something.

01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:21.280
Yeah, it's knowledge.

01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:25.360
Well, one box check.

01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:27.680
Do I get live and learn XP on that one?

01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:30.120
Oh, yeah, you get three experience.

01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:33.240
It's good.

01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:35.240
God damn it.

01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:36.440
You guys take it.

01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:41.160
Dan, you're seeing Steven Schrobb, right?

01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:42.080
They were in the ritual.

01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:42.720
You guys?

01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:43.360
Yeah.

01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:44.520
You see Steven Schrobb.

01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:47.360
They're holding magical ritual ingredients,

01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:49.040
and they're summoning a demon.

01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:50.240
And you're like, what?

01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:52.920
I look away for two seconds, that kind of thing, you know?

01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:54.360
That's where you're at right now.

01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:55.320
Yeah.

01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:57.200
What's the environment that we're in right now?

01:46:57.200 --> 01:46:58.240
It's rolling hills.

01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:00.600
This part's a flat expanse.

01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:02.080
Also, there's no trees or anything.

01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:04.720
Not near by, just grass.

01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:07.440
If Schrobb and I stop our little ritual,

01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:08.600
does the gateway close?

01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:10.760
You don't know.

01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:14.160
There's been this ongoing thing where I'm out of everything.

01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:15.600
That was a mistake.

01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:16.320
I told you that.

01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:17.000
I was wrong.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.400
You have your spells back because it's been multiple days.

01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:19.960
Oh, shit.

01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:20.600
Yeah, sorry.

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:21.080
My bad.

01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:21.720
All right.

01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:23.640
Oh, I'm back, baby.

01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:25.040
Wait, before you expend anything,

01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:27.480
Schrobb, shouldn't we just try to close this portal?

01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:29.640
Yeah, let's say everything backwards.

01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:30.640
Yeah.

01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:32.640
Uh, OK.

01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:46.640
And we're bowing up while we're doing this.

01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:48.200
And we're really committing to it.

01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:48.960
Right.

01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:49.480
Did you?

01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:50.480
You're taking note of that?

01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:52.200
We're really committing to it.

01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:53.040
And like?

01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:54.160
The biggest arms.

01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:55.760
The biggest arms.

01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:01.040
And we're really nailing the backwards talking, right?

01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:02.640
I think the cultists are impressed.

01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:03.240
Yeah.

01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:04.080
Well, oh, yeah.

01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:05.400
Well, that's important.

01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:06.280
Right.

01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:09.440
Fucking idiot.

01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:10.520
Oh, name calling.

01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:11.120
Oh, yeah.

01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:15.680
No, let's get through this life and make sure we meet one goal.

01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:18.840
Impress the cultists.

01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:21.960
Yeah, that's a chaotic world.

01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:23.480
Oh, the mountain can talk.

01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:25.680
There's a double deer.

01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:28.320
That chest has a fucking ghost in it.

01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:30.720
But let's keep things focused.

01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:32.640
Impress the cultists.

01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:35.720
You fucking idiots.

01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:37.880
You have one religion, but not you.

01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:38.360
You know what?

01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:40.080
You're a shambling mound.

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:42.320
I expect more from you.

01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:44.840
Thank you for acknowledging my race.

01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:47.880
That's fine.

01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:49.800
It's just fucking disappointing.

01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:52.400
And I'm not saying this stuff because it would take a turn.

01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:53.920
OK.

01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:55.800
I indicate that with a look.

01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:56.760
Right, yeah, of course.

01:48:56.760 --> 01:49:00.960
And also, I also want to add that it's mostly directed

01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:04.040
toward me, because I don't, I don't, I'm so floating.

01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:07.480
Like, I don't fucking like, I'm not a commander.

01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:11.120
I don't know how to handle this shit.

01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:12.840
This is shit that you're doing to me,

01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:15.760
because I don't know how to fucking clean it up, OK?

01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:17.240
Because I'm not a fucking leader.

01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:20.880
So when you do this shit, you do it to me.

01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:24.000
Because I'm not your fucking dad.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.440
I'm just a dude trying to not die.

01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:27.680
So you fuck me.

01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:28.240
You know what?

01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:29.040
When you do this shit.

01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:29.520
You know what?

01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:30.080
You know what?

01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:30.800
You know what?

01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:31.360
Fuck it.

01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:32.160
I'm done.

01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:34.800
I stop bowing backwards and saying stop.

01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:35.640
I, I,

01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:36.240
Shut up.

01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:36.880
Throw down my shit.

01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:37.600
Knock it off.

01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:38.640
And I start walking home.

01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:39.520
No, you don't.

01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:41.040
No, no, shut up.

01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:41.520
Fine.

01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:42.520
No, no, no, no.

01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:43.360
You don't like how I do it?

01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:44.360
I'm going back and forth.

01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:45.360
Knock it off.

01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:47.840
Trying to kill somebody in my living room.

01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:48.520
You wish.

01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:49.960
Hide up, build up.

01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:51.480
I'm trying to deliver tea.

01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:52.920
I never asked for this.

01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:54.600
My dog's got to be let out.

01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:55.400
I'm going.

01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:55.720
All right.

01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:57.120
First of all, you guy.

01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:57.880
I'll deal with you.

01:49:57.880 --> 01:49:59.240
I don't need to be talked to like this.

01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:00.840
Steve, keep him away from me.

01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:02.920
DJ.

01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:07.400
I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to channel.

01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:08.320
Apology.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.560
I want to get managed that.

01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:15.080
You're rested.

01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:17.000
I want to channel.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:18.960
Smite.

01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:21.480
Mm-hmm.

01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:24.040
Which?

01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:25.560
The right one.

01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:26.960
The right one.

01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:28.920
That's an attack that you use on a target.

01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:32.040
I want to smite the, the arm.

01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:33.240
Oh yeah, they think it's, yeah.

01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:34.560
All right.

01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:36.160
There's a 30 foot demon arm coming out of here.

01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:37.760
Yeah, and I'm smiting it.

01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:39.360
And it's super easy to hit.

01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:43.840
Ah, arm.

01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:46.080
Anti-arm.

01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:49.040
All right, you smite it for 11 good damage.

01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:50.440
It slices open.

01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:52.680
Anyways.

01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:54.160
Schrab is walking away, right?

01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:55.000
I'm walking away.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:56.560
I'm, I'm just a silhouette.

01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:57.600
All right, there he goes.

01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:58.800
There he goes, everybody.

01:50:58.800 --> 01:50:59.520
The hero.

01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:01.440
You know.

01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:05.840
I'm calling you a hero.

01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:08.840
Yeah, I'm saying you're a hero.

01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:12.280
Yeah, I'm saying you're a hero.

01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:15.280
I'm being sarcastic.

01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:19.000
As Schrab walks away, instantly the portal that was being

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.720
open starts destabilizing.

01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:22.880
You see its edges start to waver,

01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:25.680
and they get bigger and smaller and stuff.

01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:28.440
And now, now like a shoulder and a head of the demons

01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:30.600
like, like coming through.

01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:33.800
But now it like kind of cinches tight around him.

01:51:33.800 --> 01:51:35.880
So he's like kind of more stuck than he was,

01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:37.640
but now he's more out than he was.

01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:40.360
And he starts lashing out about.

01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:42.160
Let's see what happens.

01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:45.080
Nothing.

01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:48.880
Well, let me, let me, let me try again.

01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:50.920
I don't know what you're talking about because you're gone.

01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:52.880
By the way, everything that happens is your fault

01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:54.360
because you left.

01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:56.240
Yeah, everything that happens.

01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:58.640
Can't hear you.

01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:01.800
I can only hear the people that work hard to make this happen.

01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:04.880
The cultist gesture at Steve as if to try and make you

01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:07.960
reposition yourself in the circle.

01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:09.920
Well, look, we hear you.

01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:10.640
I'm sorry.

01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:11.200
Me?

01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:13.680
And I promise this is for change.

01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:16.440
I take my elvish blade, and I go right for the,

01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:19.960
the, the, the wounds that Dan created.

01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:27.280
OK, you miss as you step out of the circle.

01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:30.400
The, the thing D, D, what do you call it?

01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:31.560
It deregulates.

01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:32.280
I don't know.

01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:35.360
It fucks up more and it, it, it's cinches tight.

01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:38.720
And now it looks like it's kind of strangling the demon,

01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:42.040
but not like lethally, just like he's like, ah, this is an asshole.

01:52:42.040 --> 01:52:45.640
So Carlos, now this is the time to get him.

01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:48.800
I'm going to, can I cast bull strength on Carlos

01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:52.240
and give him, yeah, definitely.

01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:55.000
You'll get plus four strength for one minute.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.200
If I, if I cast bull strength on you,

01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:59.000
I'm going to let you fucking take this.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:02.560
But what am I, I don't, you're going to kill the demon.

01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:04.760
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to give you plus four

01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:05.200
strengths.

01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:05.560
OK.

01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:08.440
You want to do that?

01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:09.400
Can't hear you.

01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:10.560
Don't hear anybody.

01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:19.080
Is there a mosquito around?

01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:20.080
Ooh.

01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:21.600
I just, OK.

01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:23.520
OK, I cast bull strength on Carlos.

01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:24.200
That happens.

01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:25.840
You get all strong and such.

01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:28.760
All right, well then, physically I'm strong.

01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:30.720
Oh yeah, four more.

01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:32.000
Well then I, I'm going to use my.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:33.920
You got a plus four, go kick some butt.

01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:35.280
We got a strangled demon.

01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:37.560
Yeah, and there's four more cultists.

01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:43.080
OK, well then I'm physically using my, my morning star.

01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:45.160
All right.

01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:47.400
It's not impressive.

01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:51.600
It is when you clock, what do you attack?

01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:53.400
What do you mean, time, times two critical?

01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:55.240
What are you attacking?

01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:57.680
The thing, the arm, shoulder.

01:53:57.680 --> 01:53:59.800
You clock him right in the shoulder.

01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:03.720
It deals another 12 damage.

01:54:03.720 --> 01:54:05.200
Yeah.

01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:07.160
It's, it's not, it's hurting him,

01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:08.920
but it's like, he's a giant, giant.

01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:13.320
OK, thank you for the, making me better than I am.

01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:14.320
That's not really what I do.

01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:15.680
Is the portal still closing?

01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:18.560
It's like cinched tight around him, the demon's stuck.

01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:20.120
It's like he can't get all the way out

01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:22.160
because the ritual has been disrupted.

01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:23.160
Oh.

01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:26.160
Mm, mm, mm, ah.

01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:31.440
Who's the worst?

01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:32.840
Hey Chris, you want to roll the clip?

01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:34.440
Chris is our clip.

01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:36.080

01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:37.880
so here's your mission complete screen.

01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:38.880
