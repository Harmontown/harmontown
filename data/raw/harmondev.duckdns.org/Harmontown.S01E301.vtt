{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:22.840\nHello gang, from the Dynasty Typewriter at the Hayworth whatever the theater is called\n\n00:22.840 --> 00:35.360\ndown here, MacArthur Park, Los Angeles, Harmontown is now in session, Episode 301.\n\n00:35.360 --> 00:39.760\nOh shit, is my voice back? I just got loud for no reason. Let's bring out the Game Master\n\n00:39.760 --> 00:55.520\nExtraordinaire, Spencer Crittenden everybody. He's all in brown, he's down to clown. What's\n\n00:55.520 --> 01:01.280\nin that little lunchbox baby? What is this? Treasures. You got secret treasures in there?\n\n01:01.280 --> 01:07.520\nWhat? You got secret treasures in there? Yeah, I got secret treasures. Can I know your secret?\n\n01:07.520 --> 01:17.200\nNo. We'll find out. Fantastic. I feel like I have to yell. Well, let's not. Let's stop. How\n\n01:17.200 --> 01:20.280\nabout this? Yeah, you and I can stop yelling and we can bring out the Mayor of Harmontown.\n\n01:20.280 --> 01:38.560\nWho? Dan Harmon. Yo, I got a little baby backpack. I got a little baby backpack. I'm back and packing\n\n01:38.560 --> 01:46.960\nwhere it's back at. A millennial backpack. A little tiny thing the size of a wallet hanging on my back.\n\n01:46.960 --> 01:58.040\nWhat are you calling? A little baby tiny backpack. It proves I'm 19. I only got so much shit, so why\n\n01:58.040 --> 02:09.560\nwould I have a bigger backpack than it? I just have room for my ecstasy. And your phone. I got a\n\n02:09.560 --> 02:18.960\nlittle tiny backpack. It's a Rick and Morty little tiny backpack. And I see like in proper\n\n02:18.960 --> 02:25.600\nlike, like millennial style, you kept the tags on it to prove that it's, you know. Well, I wanted to\n\n02:25.600 --> 02:28.720\nkeep it in kind of mint condition because I thought I'd give it away to an audience member tonight.\n\n02:28.720 --> 02:37.680\nAre you saying that somebody here at the Dynasty Typeway is going to go home with a tiny wallet\n\n02:37.680 --> 02:47.920\noutside a millennial backpack? You thought all you were going to get. There's an impressive, it's a\n\n02:47.920 --> 02:54.000\nwhole mosaic of Rick and Morty scenes and things. It was in my office on the pile of this merch every\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:58.840\nday comes in. Here's the toothbrush, here's the watch, here's the thing. And there's a little tiny\n\n02:58.840 --> 03:05.160\nbackpack. I brought it home to Cody. She said, I'm a little old for a little tiny backpack. Why don't\n\n03:05.160 --> 03:12.640\nyou take it to the show and give it away to somebody. So I will. And you have worn it. I saw it. So you\n\n03:12.640 --> 03:27.760\ncan sell it. You'll be able to say it was worn by Dan Harmon. Okay, so what's going on? I mentioned,\n\n03:27.760 --> 03:33.880\nwe were just talking, you said you liked the Ant-Man and the Wasp. Yeah, the new Ant-Man movie.\n\n03:33.880 --> 03:40.200\nHaven't seen it. Good for our friend Chris McKenna of the community, the beating heart of\n\n03:40.200 --> 03:45.760\ncommunity. I think he's heavily involved in that Ant-Man business. So it's good to hear that that's\n\n03:45.760 --> 03:51.520\ngood. I really like Deadpool 2. I think I mentioned that again. I thought Deadpool 2 was awesome. Why\n\n03:51.520 --> 03:57.280\ndo you like it? I don't know. Maybe it's a sad state of movies these days, but it's just when\n\n03:57.280 --> 04:04.280\nyou're shocked that something like lands. That's why I like all the Marvel movies. It's just like,\n\n04:04.280 --> 04:12.080\nI like superheroes and this is a movie. Yeah. This didn't kick me in the face. Yeah. I mean,\n\n04:12.080 --> 04:16.040\noverall, I won't be lying. I'm 45 years old. I think I'm allowed to say, I don't really care\n\n04:16.040 --> 04:25.960\nabout your Marvels. Sure. You're a spider. I get it. You climb walls. You're still climbing them.\n\n04:25.960 --> 04:30.440\nThere's been like nine actors playing. It's a kid. I know. I know you can climb walls. I don't\n\n04:30.440 --> 04:36.720\ncare anymore. I also don't know what I care about. I mean, don't go to me for what you should be\n\n04:36.720 --> 04:43.000\nwatching. My taste buds are dying. So is my soul. I sit in bed and I'm living either the best life\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:49.080\nor the worst life. I listen to podcasts about people being murdered and I play Minecraft. I'm\n\n04:49.080 --> 04:56.760\nslowly rotting away with a big smile on my face. So if I was 19, it'd probably be a great time\n\n04:56.760 --> 05:04.360\nto care about the spider people. What's he doing on that wall? Walls are for stopping you from\n\n05:04.360 --> 05:09.960\nwalking. He's walking up it. Holy shit. What kind of guy is he? He's a spider guy. Okay. If you're\n\n05:09.960 --> 05:15.120\n19, you're probably like, Jesus Christ, this is my diehard. Yeah, man. I don't know. I don't know\n\n05:15.120 --> 05:19.760\nfrom kids. I don't know what you care about. It should be called spider guy, not spider man. He\n\n05:19.760 --> 05:26.200\nwas young. He was a kid. It should be called spider dude or spider. Spider dude is something. Now,\n\n05:26.200 --> 05:32.800\nspider child I don't like. What's the movie with the little girl with the purple wig and she kicks\n\n05:32.800 --> 05:43.400\neverybody's ass? Spider child. Huh? Spider child. Kick ass. Kick ass. Okay. Right. It's a movie about\n\n05:43.400 --> 05:48.840\na girl just kicking everybody's dick around the room for fucking two hours, right? I guess so,\n\n05:48.840 --> 06:05.040\nyeah. I don't get out that much, but I promise you that the controversy over the e-scooters is\n\n06:05.040 --> 06:12.600\ndefinitely manufactured. Thank you. I see it as nothing but a boon. I have never been troubled\n\n06:12.600 --> 06:19.920\nby a person riding around on a scooter that they rented with an app. I've seen them. I've puzzled\n\n06:19.920 --> 06:26.800\nat them and then someone's explained them to me and my only thought was this is fantastic. It'll\n\n06:26.800 --> 06:32.880\nprobably take me years to muster the courage to walk up to one and be like, so what do I do? It's\n\n06:32.880 --> 06:40.800\nreal fun. But like, have you read one? Oh, yeah. Up and down the shop. Me and Dan have a shop now.\n\n06:40.800 --> 06:48.320\nYou haven't been on one? No, I've been on one. It was a lot of fun. I think that people just like\n\n06:48.320 --> 06:52.280\nbeing mad about stuff, right? They used to be mad about rock and roll and now they're mad about\n\n06:52.280 --> 06:58.680\nscooters. I'm not familiar with the beef about the... Well, in Santa Monica, there's a lot of these\n\n06:58.680 --> 07:12.480\nscooters. Dan, take it away. Well, I... Dan takes it away. I certainly don't want to blindly dismiss\n\n07:12.480 --> 07:20.160\nif anybody has a legitimate grievance. I just, I sort of like, come on. There's a, you know,\n\n07:20.160 --> 07:26.160\ntech is being used laterally and experimentally as it should be. Somebody, like, you know,\n\n07:26.160 --> 07:32.600\nit's funny how culture progresses and things. I think it's the impressiveness of it way outweighs\n\n07:32.600 --> 07:41.880\nany possible inconvenience. Right. Like, the potential solutions, you know, they just have\n\n07:41.880 --> 07:46.520\nthese scooters. They just like, you just throw them out in the street. You just throw them. Like,\n\n07:46.520 --> 07:53.280\nthere's no, they don't have stations. There's no, it's sort of like GPS technology and these\n\n07:53.280 --> 07:59.200\nthings that we associate with, like, bridling us and, oh, we're all in a Orwellian society. It's\n\n07:59.200 --> 08:03.320\nlike, well, yeah, but it also means you could just take this fucking lump of metal and just go\n\n08:03.320 --> 08:09.920\nout in the sidewalk and just rolls and lands. And if you find one... Yeah, I walked out of my place.\n\n08:09.920 --> 08:15.440\nThere was one in the bush in front of my place. I'm like, is this, is this somebody that wants\n\n08:15.440 --> 08:20.240\nthis back? Like, did somebody drop this off to go take a pee and wants this back or can I just\n\n08:20.240 --> 08:24.160\nsteal his scooter? I don't know what that was. If it's in the bush, I think he's hiding it so\n\n08:24.160 --> 08:28.240\nyou can't find it so he can get it. It was inside the bush. It was just resting. It was nestling.\n\n08:28.240 --> 08:32.800\nYeah, somebody visited your neighbor and they left it there. Like, like we did with dirt bikes in\n\n08:32.800 --> 08:37.320\n83. That's like, you know, you ride your dirt bike and then you fucking ditch it, you run in and\n\n08:37.320 --> 08:41.440\nplay Atari. Yeah, but somebody stole my red line dirt bike and I was fucking pissed off. Well,\n\n08:41.440 --> 08:45.720\nyeah, because it was your dirt bike to steal. And now imagine a world where, okay, who needs to own\n\n08:45.720 --> 08:50.000\nthis piece of shit? I'm just taking it to my friend's house to play Atari. But let's say I go to\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:55.360\nyour place on one of these e-scooters, right? I'm not walking or driving to Dan's place. I'm gonna\n\n08:55.360 --> 08:59.840\ntake one of these. Use a scooter. I found a scooter in a bush. I live, I live in Chelsea. He lives\n\n08:59.840 --> 09:07.520\nin Upper West Side. Yeah. That tracks. It's a bit of a ride. I'm gonna play some Atari. We just\n\n09:07.520 --> 09:13.240\ntake the A train. Okay. But anyway, but let's say I go, oh, I found a scooter in a bush. What's it\n\n09:13.240 --> 09:19.000\nsay? The first ride is only a dollar. I figure out how to make it work. There's a QR code. Yeah,\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:26.280\nyou scan it. And now I'm on a thing and now it's going and I'm in a suit and I look like a vampire\n\n09:26.280 --> 09:34.920\nin a scooter. And I get to your place and then I drop it off, just leave it. Just leave it. And\n\n09:34.920 --> 09:39.400\nthen I come out and go, where's my scooter? Well, now you don't have a ride home. But yeah, I mean,\n\n09:39.400 --> 09:42.320\nit's not guaranteed because someone could come by and find it. Just fucking scoop up my scooter. I\n\n09:42.320 --> 09:46.000\nthink you can also locate them with your, you can go like, where's the nearest one? You can go find\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:50.920\nit. Yeah, you can keep. Can I stash it? Like, can I put it in your garage? Well, you can take it\n\n09:50.920 --> 09:54.880\ninto the house. Yeah. Or you can just stay renting it. Then someone goes, where's my nearest\n\n09:54.880 --> 09:58.400\nscooter? And they go, oh, Dan Harmon's house. Oh, is that true? That's what I'm confused. You stay\n\n09:58.400 --> 10:04.920\nrenting it like, okay, so if you went to the 7-Eleven, Jeff, you just, you don't unrent it. And then\n\n10:04.920 --> 10:09.520\nthat means if someone comes up to try and get it, they can't because it's already in use by you. So\n\n10:09.520 --> 10:13.760\nthat that bush scooter might have already been. Oh, you're paying for the time. Yeah, yeah, you\n\n10:13.760 --> 10:19.000\npay for it in time. Yeah, but then you get paid to charge it. So if you take a scooter home and\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:25.040\ncharge it, you get like 10 bucks for that. This is French. It's awesome. Here's the problem. It was\n\n10:25.040 --> 10:31.440\nrolled out in Santa Monica, which just has garbage traffic and especially garbage bike traffic, which\n\n10:31.440 --> 10:35.080\ndoesn't integrate well with street traffic. It's already hard for bikes. That's the, I get that. Right.\n\n10:35.080 --> 10:38.960\nIt's already hard enough for bicyclists. But that's the thing is, so all the problems that apply to\n\n10:38.960 --> 10:43.480\nbicyclists are now applying to scooters, but since they're easier to use and you don't have to go\n\n10:43.480 --> 10:48.120\nout and be a weird biker to drive a bike, don't get me wrong. If you like a bike, that's good. But\n\n10:48.120 --> 10:53.960\nanyone can do it. So we're having more of a traffic problem because all this bike, you know,\n\n10:53.960 --> 10:58.360\nwhat is essentially bike traffic is now being forced to contend with road traffic. And that's a\n\n10:58.360 --> 11:03.560\nproblem because the roads weren't built for bikes. But that's a problem for bikes and not scooters.\n\n11:03.560 --> 11:08.840\nIt's just a problem. It's like, it's bad etiquette on a bicycle to be on the sidewalk. I hate when\n\n11:08.840 --> 11:13.480\nbikers are on the sidewalk. But now scooters are all over the goddamn sidewalk and I'm gonna get killed\n\n11:13.480 --> 11:18.920\nby a family of scooter people. Right. But you would have got killed by a bike two weeks ago. So\n\n11:18.920 --> 11:25.320\nyou're just fearing rock and roll. I just want to add this as a as a former LA bicyclist. I just\n\n11:25.320 --> 11:29.960\nwant to add I'd rather have people hate me for being on the sidewalk than fucking die. Right.\n\n11:29.960 --> 11:35.720\nBecause like, it's not a bicycle friendly city. Anyways, blah, blah, blah. A lot of bicyclists get\n\n11:35.720 --> 11:41.480\nkilled in the road by by drivers and stuff. Like that's a huge issue in LA. Right. And they have\n\n11:41.480 --> 11:46.040\nthe right of way. And yet they're getting like probably hurt as if they were motorcyclists who\n\n11:46.040 --> 11:49.240\nknow what they're signing up for. Sorry if you're out there and you got injured in a motorcycle\n\n11:49.240 --> 11:55.160\naccident. I'm just being glib. But I mean, bicycles can't split lanes and stuff. You're just riding\n\n11:55.160 --> 11:59.640\non the side of the road. Look, I get I get frustrated by a bicyclist in front of me too. But\n\n11:59.640 --> 12:04.760\nthen I go like, come on, Dan, we live near each other. Spencer, if you're down with us, we can\n\n12:04.760 --> 12:09.000\ndo it together. I'd love to. Let's let's find take one of these scooters. Let's find some me\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:12.840\nscooters and fucking just like take it to the streets like fuck it. Well, I do want to break\n\n12:12.840 --> 12:18.280\nthat. Yeah, and go like, let's learn to do this. Like, you know, so that because it's like, I\n\n12:18.280 --> 12:22.120\nyeah, I want to know how to do it. It's great. How do you know if the battery is going to die\n\n12:22.120 --> 12:28.680\non it? It'll tell you when you scan or looking for them. It's great. Spencer, you got all the\n\n12:28.680 --> 12:33.560\nanswers today, man. I'm sorry. Well, that's what we want to be. What's that fucking treasure basket\n\n12:33.560 --> 12:48.200\nyou've got? Not all the answers. All right, so I was eating dinner with my friend and we were\n\n12:48.200 --> 12:53.480\ntalking about our dads and like, like sayings and things. It was actually Heath who you remember\n\n12:53.480 --> 12:59.160\nfrom the dad fish episode. We were having dinner and we're just so the topic of dads had come\n\n12:59.160 --> 13:03.880\nup again and like he's he he attributed the saying to his dad, which I have heard before.\n\n13:04.600 --> 13:09.400\nAnd I wrote it down because it's like, I really have always had a problem with the saying that\n\n13:09.400 --> 13:14.360\nhis dad would say, you know, like if you if you would go like, well, I wish I wish we could have\n\n13:14.360 --> 13:20.200\ngone to the zoo today. And then like his dad would say, well, wish in one hand and shit in the other\n\n13:20.200 --> 13:30.440\nand see which one fills up faster. That's the fucking most awful thing I've ever heard. It just\n\n13:30.440 --> 13:40.200\ndoesn't it doesn't scan for me. It doesn't you don't wish into anything. I like like it almost\n\n13:40.200 --> 13:44.760\nmakes its own counter argument because it's sort of like like your one hairs breath away from saying\n\n13:44.760 --> 13:51.880\nfill one hand with wishes and fill the other hand with shit and see which is more valuable.\n\n13:53.080 --> 14:00.360\nLike a handful of shit. We'll see. A handful of wishes is like the ratio of value to\n\n14:01.160 --> 14:06.040\namount of you have to wash it. It's like amazing. You could wish for a toilet. You could wish for\n\n14:06.040 --> 14:13.240\nlike it just seems like it's more practical to fill your one hand with shit. But that's not\n\n14:13.240 --> 14:19.880\nsustainable. Your hand fills right up. If you're wishing into your hand, you'll be fucking doing\n\n14:19.880 --> 14:26.280\nit for weeks. I got two handful of wishes right now. And you can still use them to do stuff. Yeah,\n\n14:26.920 --> 14:31.960\nI wish Spencer would tell me what's on that fucking lunchbox on his desk. I got a bunch of\n\n14:31.960 --> 14:40.440\npocket operators in it. Look. Oh, whoa. Yeah. Wow. There you go. Pocket operators. They make music.\n\n14:40.440 --> 14:45.800\nI don't even know what that is. It's good. They're like little synthesizers that the kids are doing.\n\n14:45.800 --> 14:50.200\nAll the kids, they love them. There's a book called What Makes Sammy Run by Bud Shilberg.\n\n14:51.320 --> 14:57.400\nLike kind of the antagonist in it is Sammy Glick. And he says it's like about the Hollywood system\n\n14:57.400 --> 15:03.320\nback in the like 30s, 40s, 50s. I don't know. It's been a while. And 60s. Yeah. No, it's poor that.\n\n15:03.320 --> 15:08.440\nAnd he says your friend doesn't want to write that like punch up your script for $50. And he goes,\n\n15:08.440 --> 15:12.680\nyou tell someone so if he doesn't like $50, he can shit in his hat, pull it over his head and call\n\n15:12.680 --> 15:21.560\nit curls. That's the best thing. I think a lot of people get away with invoking shit. And these\n\n15:21.560 --> 15:25.240\nlike quick statements are like counting on you to not think twice about it. My dad used to say,\n\n15:25.240 --> 15:32.360\nif I wanted any shit out of you, I'll squeeze your head. Wait, what? Yeah. But then he would often add\n\n15:32.360 --> 15:35.720\nand it'll come out of your ears. Because I think he thought that wait, this kid's four years old.\n\n15:35.720 --> 15:41.160\nHe doesn't even understand what I'm saying. But he understands child abuse. Well, I was just saying\n\n15:41.160 --> 15:43.960\nlike, if I want shit out of you, I'll squeeze your head. And then I think you'd see a blank\n\n15:43.960 --> 15:48.280\nstare and be like, it'll come out of your ears. Because your head's full of shit.\n\n15:48.280 --> 15:52.520\nThat's the most softened the blow of that statement. Well, it just it helps the jokeland,\n\n15:52.520 --> 15:56.280\nI guess. I don't know if that's your goal. What's the first part? If I need shit out of you,\n\n15:56.280 --> 16:00.280\nif I want any shit out of you, I'll squeeze your head. Well, you know there's an easier way to do it.\n\n16:00.280 --> 16:08.200\nSqueeze the butt. Well, yeah. Yeah. You can't. You can't. You can't. You first feed them,\n\n16:08.200 --> 16:11.880\ngive them a hot meal. Right, yeah. Yeah, provide for them. Yes. And just actually,\n\n16:11.880 --> 16:15.400\njust wait, you don't even have to squeeze them. That's what I'm saying. If I went, Dan, if I\n\n16:15.400 --> 16:19.800\nwant any shit out of you, I'm going to take you to Arby's. If I want any shit out of you, I'll\n\n16:19.800 --> 16:24.840\nkeep going to work from nine to five and accepting the accountability that comes with reproduction\n\n16:24.840 --> 16:30.760\nand providing you with a... I will wait six to eight hours after I fed you. And I'll put a special\n\n16:30.760 --> 16:39.000\ntrap into the toilet because apparently I'm in this for shit. Not wishes. You should put a wish\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:46.200\ntrap under your butt. A little wish trap. What if you can shit wishes? The whole value of wishes\n\n16:46.200 --> 16:52.520\nis that they have zero rest mass. That means they can move at the speed of light. You can wish\n\n16:52.520 --> 16:57.480\na thousand times. It won't cost you anything. Wish, wish, wish, wish, wish, wish. I didn't\n\n16:57.480 --> 17:03.880\nsuffer anything. That's the whole point. Fucking wish away, motherfuckers. You can't flush a wish.\n\n17:03.880 --> 17:08.840\nYou don't have to poop. It costs you nothing to wish. You know what it profits you every once\n\n17:08.840 --> 17:14.760\nin a while? You come up with a fucking e-scooter business. I wish I was a fucking millionaire.\n\n17:14.760 --> 17:20.040\nThat's the whole idea. I wish, wish, wish, wish, wish, wish. Fucking wish away. Don't\n\n17:20.040 --> 17:27.160\nshit in your hand. Someone wished a toilet existed. That guy was smart. Or lady.\n\n17:30.200 --> 17:37.800\nMadam crapper. I wish I didn't just shit in my hand. I just wish shit in one hand or wish in\n\n17:37.800 --> 17:44.760\none hand shit in the other and see which one fills up faster. All right, Dad, I went away and did\n\n17:44.760 --> 17:53.000\nwhat you said and I have a handful of shit. See? I still don't get your point, man. I just said\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:58.200\nI wish you were a better dad. You could fill up. Like I still don't understand your point. I just\n\n17:58.200 --> 18:02.200\nhave shit in my hand. Like that's like just reinforced. I feel like I already had that in\n\n18:02.200 --> 18:06.120\nthe form of your fatherhood. You should have called his bluff and go, all right, give me,\n\n18:06.120 --> 18:10.920\ngive me 20 minutes. And then come back out with a handful of shit and another hand go,\n\n18:10.920 --> 18:17.880\nthe wishes filled up faster. I mean, how do you know? Like what is a wish way? What is its mass?\n\n18:17.880 --> 18:22.200\nI don't have like wishes are the only part of humanity. That's our redeeming quality to be\n\n18:22.200 --> 18:28.040\nable to wish. Penguins can't wish. We're going to fuck them. Talk to penguins in 50 years.\n\n18:29.080 --> 18:33.800\nYou won't be able to. You know why? They couldn't wish. We could. What did we wish for?\n\n18:34.440 --> 18:39.160\nGreenhouse effect. Indirectly. We didn't really want that. We wished for cars.\n\n18:39.160 --> 18:45.320\nPenguins just wished for tuna, I think, I assume. I don't know. Or salmon.\n\n18:45.320 --> 18:49.000\nPenguins should have wished for droppings. What did penguins eat? Penguins should have wished\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:52.600\nfor hams, but they can't hold anything. They can't even hold their own shit.\n\n18:54.200 --> 18:57.160\nYou try to hold shit in a penguin flipper? It's going to fall right off.\n\n18:57.960 --> 19:01.320\nI don't want to throw penguins under the bus at a time when they're probably under a lot of\n\n19:01.320 --> 19:06.120\nfire from the climate. They should have wished for the retention of flight.\n\n19:06.120 --> 19:12.760\nLike, what makes a bird of all creatures think maybe we should get back into the ocean?\n\n19:12.760 --> 19:17.720\nYeah, they should have wished that they didn't have to carry their child's egg on their feet for\n\n19:17.720 --> 19:22.040\nfour months while their spouse was on the fish tank. I'm a little iffy even on the mammals that\n\n19:22.040 --> 19:31.000\ngo back. All due respect to my boys, the dolphins. Like, props. West side. Like, we get it. Like,\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:36.280\nfucking, maybe shit was going ham up here. Like, you were like a dog creature. You know, maybe I\n\n19:36.280 --> 19:39.720\ncould have flippers that go back. Is this your influence of hanging out with Dave Kline that\n\n19:39.720 --> 19:43.880\nyou have all this new? I guess I'm kind of going off of his, like, maybe I'm learning to, like,\n\n19:43.880 --> 19:49.320\nbe encouraged by him. Maybe if he's happy, I'm happy. So maybe that's what's happening. But no,\n\n19:49.320 --> 19:52.840\nit's like, like, whales were probably these brontosaurus, isn't there? Like, this is fucking\n\n19:52.840 --> 19:58.280\nbullshit. Like, I'm on your side as a brontosaurus creature, like a Loch Ness monster. Like, that's\n\n19:58.280 --> 20:03.000\nwhat a whale would have looked like before it went back. It was, like, experimenting with, like,\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:09.080\nwell, I've been told that if I start breathing oxygen, I can eat leaves and hang out. And then\n\n20:09.080 --> 20:19.400\nit's like, and then something comes up, disembowels. I was like, fuck this. And it goes back. I'm,\n\n20:19.400 --> 20:32.520\nlike, on that guy's side. That's, I'm, like, good, good for you. You know, do you know what a Dave Kline whale says?\n\n20:32.520 --> 20:52.440\nWell, let's bring out Rob Schrab. Well, something exotic is about to happen. I can't even see.\n\n20:52.440 --> 21:10.200\nWow, you know what? Dan's leaving the stage as Rob takes the stage after taking of Dan's popcorn.\n\n21:10.200 --> 21:25.640\nRob, test the new chair. It doesn't look more comfortable. What do you think? Is it comfortable?\n\n21:25.640 --> 21:32.600\nIt's kind of like a high chair. Yeah. Is that what we're, is that the angle we're going for?\n\n21:32.600 --> 21:35.880\nPeople are trying to make you happy, Rob. We're trying to make you, we're trying to make you more\n\n21:35.880 --> 21:48.200\ncomfortable. Cushions! I got a cushion. Do you want mine? I knew it. I knew it. I still can't see,\n\n21:48.200 --> 21:54.520\nbut I know what's happening. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. There's a new chair.\n\n21:54.520 --> 22:09.240\nThis chair does look comfortable. This has been Harmontown Musical Chairs.\n\n22:11.880 --> 22:15.640\nThanks, Dave. I win! I win!\n\n22:15.640 --> 22:25.800\nRob, what are your thoughts on Senator McCain dying?\n\n22:34.360 --> 22:40.920\nHere's the thing. Podcast dynamite. Here's the thing. Give me my popcorn. No, no.\n\n22:40.920 --> 22:45.800\nAll right, you can have it a little. Give us thoughts on John McCain dying.\n\n22:47.080 --> 22:53.480\nI think it's sad when anything dies, you know, I mean, but I, you know, I didn't share his\n\n22:53.480 --> 22:59.320\nbelief system, but he seemed like he was trying to do some good stuff. He fought for our country. He\n\n22:59.320 --> 23:04.680\ngot his POW, you know, I mean, like, he did some, he tried to do some good stuff.\n\n23:04.680 --> 23:10.680\nSpencer, what do you think about Rob's thoughts on John McCain dying? I think they were too safe.\n\n23:12.040 --> 23:17.240\nI don't think he took a real stand. I'm kind of like, like, like what a rivet would have as a\n\n23:17.240 --> 23:23.320\nthought, like a frog or a rivets are a valuable part of society. Let me ask you one question.\n\n23:23.880 --> 23:31.720\nDo you usually go to frogs for like political commentary? No, you don't. So don't go to me\n\n23:31.720 --> 23:38.680\nfor political commentary either. Go for me for chair criticisms. Try. What do you think about\n\n23:38.680 --> 23:45.160\nthe genocide going on in Myanmar right now? I'm against it. Next question. I can't.\n\n23:45.720 --> 23:49.160\nToo safe. Because the people committing it are just trying to keep genocide from happening.\n\n23:53.240 --> 23:57.720\nI think popcorn's bad for the show. You guys, I think it's, I think it's good. Good for the tummy.\n\n23:57.720 --> 24:01.720\nNobody wants to hear people eat during a thing. They'll live. Like, when I, like,\n\n24:01.720 --> 24:05.400\nthey can watch. There's a commercial and there's people eating, like a Carl's Jr. commercial.\n\n24:05.400 --> 24:10.760\nPeople, the sound of people eating was going to fucking barf. I was hungry. I don't know how\n\n24:10.760 --> 24:19.160\nmuch Carl's Jr. ads amplify the sound of eating. I don't, I don't know that that's true. I think\n\n24:19.160 --> 24:23.880\nthat if anyone knows how unattractive the sound of eating is, it's the companies trying to sell\n\n24:23.880 --> 24:31.240\nthat. Is there anybody in the audience, preferably of the, of the, of the persuasion, but I'm not\n\n24:31.240 --> 24:38.920\ngoing to. Hey, that was great, man. Now go on. Hey, if you're serving the audience, let me hear you\n\n24:38.920 --> 25:00.120\nsay, yeah. Yeah. Is there anybody in the audience that is the, is the, that, that identifies as\n\n25:00.120 --> 25:05.800\nthe kind of person that would like to wear a tiny backpack who also wait, wait for it. Sorry.\n\n25:05.800 --> 25:13.400\nSorry. Who also would give us honest feedback from their perspective on what they expect from\n\n25:13.400 --> 25:19.960\nthe show moving forward. Okay. All right. You're, you're committed. Okay. Come on up. All right.\n\n25:19.960 --> 25:34.120\nAll right. From the second row. Hello. Your name is Nova.\n\n25:34.120 --> 25:43.080\nNova galaxy across the milky way. Your backpack is here for you.\n\n25:43.080 --> 25:46.200\nHere you go. Nova plastic on the hand.\n\n25:47.880 --> 25:55.880\nMake sure you cut off the tags. Major Tom. Well, your name is Nova.\n\n25:55.880 --> 26:02.120\nNova. Yeah. Hello, Nova. Welcome supernova to the show.\n\n26:03.640 --> 26:08.120\nMaking over your backpack.\n\n26:09.320 --> 26:16.280\nNova. Hey, hey, Nova. Nova was in Planet of the Apes, the original Planet of the Apes.\n\n26:16.280 --> 26:27.000\nI know. Yeah. Is that a blood? Hey, hey, hey. One more thing. Nova was a television show. Yep.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:35.800\nUh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. That's all I got. A car. What? A car, a star. Yeah. You're probably\n\n26:35.800 --> 26:42.520\nan expert on this. What else are you named? You know what would be better is what, what am I named\n\n26:42.520 --> 26:47.960\nafter? Don't answer that. Don't answer that. Don't answer that. Don't answer that. Don't answer that.\n\n26:47.960 --> 26:58.040\nOkay. Moving on to you. Thievery. Nova, what do you think qualifies you to wear the coveted\n\n26:58.040 --> 27:03.080\ntiny Rick and Morty backpack? I don't know. I'm a pretty huge super fan of Harmontown.\n\n27:03.080 --> 27:07.720\nI've been to like almost every show at this theater. And I love Rick and Morty very much.\n\n27:07.720 --> 27:11.880\nI resent this line of questioning. Yeah. She doesn't have to prove nothing.\n\n27:11.880 --> 27:15.560\nYeah. I mean, it's a, it's a consumer product. You just have to want the backpack. You don't\n\n27:15.560 --> 27:19.400\nhave to earn the backpack. Well, okay. I have a follow-up question. What do you,\n\n27:19.400 --> 27:22.680\nwhat do you think is going to go into that backpack first? What's, what's,\n\n27:22.680 --> 27:25.960\nwhat are you going to carry around in your smart little tote bag? All right, I'll move it.\n\n27:30.280 --> 27:37.160\nPhone wallet? Phone and wallet. That's fair. Yeah. Is that one thing? Like a hyphen? No, I don't have\n\n27:37.160 --> 27:43.080\nthe little thing with that part of it. I just, I don't, I, I'm so sorry about my friend. That's\n\n27:43.080 --> 27:49.960\ntotally cool. Hey, what are you doing for Labor Day weekend, Nova? Labor Day weekend\n\n27:49.960 --> 27:55.160\ngoing to be showing off that backpack. Got any tattoos? Yeah. Go get, get some tattoos on the\n\n27:55.160 --> 28:00.600\nbackpack on Labor Day weekend. You want to go get a tattoo on Labor Day weekend with me and Rob?\n\n28:00.600 --> 28:08.840\nI'm going to go see the Meg on Labor Day weekend. Yeah. Some empty seats for the Meg.\n\n28:08.840 --> 28:13.480\nI try to bring a young person up and, and, and, and. I'm trying to relate the Meg.\n\n28:14.760 --> 28:20.040\nIt's just traumatizing them. They're going to be like, I don't even know what happened. It was\n\n28:20.040 --> 28:26.520\nlike Thanksgiving at my uncle's. It's much better. Okay. As long as you're having a good time. Yeah.\n\n28:26.520 --> 28:32.760\nBut also, and, and then also if the audience is having a good time, but then also on top of that,\n\n28:33.320 --> 28:37.960\nI should have a good time. Yeah, it's your show. We'll stop being such a fucking stick in the\n\n28:37.960 --> 28:45.720\ndeck and get in the game, man. I'm not a stick in the deck. I'm not a stick in the deck. Take that\n\n28:45.720 --> 28:54.520\nback. Take it back. Your arms are folded. Yeah. Well, you know what? This is an allowable posture\n\n28:54.520 --> 29:00.760\nfor somebody. You got some snot dripping off your mustache. It's vodka. This isn't your show.\n\n29:00.760 --> 29:06.360\nAre you kissing? Did you just? Someone's acting like a real stick in the deck over there. Nova.\n\n29:08.200 --> 29:13.800\nNova. I don't want to put you in between this. Nova. But choose between me and Rob.\n\n29:14.840 --> 29:17.560\nNova, you must use the power crystals. Your backpack is on the line.\n\n29:18.200 --> 29:23.320\nNova, you must use the power crystals or you won't be able to open the galaxy door.\n\n29:23.320 --> 29:33.400\nNova, believe in yourself. Nova, please. Nova, give me a name, Nova. What's my name, Rob?\n\n29:34.440 --> 29:39.560\nI just want to die sometimes. Is that why you listen to the show? Because you sometimes just\n\n29:39.560 --> 29:44.200\nwant to die and you're like, Dean knows what it's like. Like he gets sad. Yeah. Okay, good. That's\n\n29:44.200 --> 29:49.240\nwhat I thought. And so he kind of ruins it sometimes, right? No. Okay. That was my job.\n\n29:49.240 --> 29:55.320\nI don't like when he makes you legitimately upset. No, but he's not upset. Get a little\n\n29:55.320 --> 30:01.880\nfrustrated. Look at his arms. Look at his posture. I get concerned about shape of show. I get\n\n30:01.880 --> 30:07.320\nconcerned about $10. I get concerned about you driving from Silver Lake, wherever you're coming\n\n30:07.320 --> 30:14.520\nfrom. Santa Clarita. Santa Clarita. I mean, that's a long drive. And then you choke up with some\n\n30:14.520 --> 30:21.960\nmoney. Santa Clarita diet. Do you ever watch that? I want you to have a good time. I always\n\n30:21.960 --> 30:28.920\nhave a good time. So yes. I love you and I love Schrab. Okay. Nova, what do you do for a living,\n\n30:28.920 --> 30:36.680\nif I may ask? Nothing currently. I'm unemployed. I've never been applauded for that. You can\n\n30:36.680 --> 30:40.360\ncharge e-scooters. You can go grab them. You can take them and charge them. Yeah, I mean, I see\n\n30:40.360 --> 30:48.680\npeople doing that. It's crazy. I thought they were self-mowed powered. They are self-mowed powered.\n\n30:50.200 --> 30:54.360\nThey need to be charged. And then there's like cultures of kids, like they roll in\n\n30:54.360 --> 30:59.560\nscooter charging gangs. Yeah, they do. Or with each other. That sounds fun. Hey, man. That scooter is\n\n30:59.560 --> 31:06.520\nthe property of sticky. That's on my turn. I don't know this sticky, but I know this scooter belongs\n\n31:06.520 --> 31:13.880\nto the Jet Boys. Get them. And they have scooter fights, but all the scooters are out of battery.\n\n31:14.520 --> 31:19.800\nYou're never alone. They inch forward on scooters going and then try to like steer it with one\n\n31:19.800 --> 31:25.960\nhand. They're all wobbling. It's hard to do Jerome Robin's choreography when you're on a scooter.\n\n31:25.960 --> 31:34.040\nWhat? Here's my concern, Nova. Can I ask you, is podcast culture, do you listen to podcasts\n\n31:34.040 --> 31:38.680\nwhen you're like going to sleep at night, like you make a part of your life? I listen to podcasts\n\n31:38.680 --> 31:43.320\njust throughout like my whole day, because I feel too, I don't know, kind of like lonely or sad with\n\n31:43.320 --> 31:48.840\nlike nothing on. Yeah. So yeah. So I listen to Harmontown or Game Grumps, which is technically\n\n31:48.840 --> 31:55.800\nnot a podcast, but there's no like face cam. So it's like a podcast. But yeah, I don't listen to\n\n31:55.800 --> 32:04.600\na wide variety of things. So like my concern as an old timer is I'm thinking about you,\n\n32:05.880 --> 32:12.360\nkids. I'm like, oh, if I was Nova and I was going to sleep when I was listening to Harmontown,\n\n32:12.360 --> 32:18.360\ncan I rely on this show to like have like a consistency and a like sort of like, oh,\n\n32:18.360 --> 32:24.360\nI'm coming home to Harmontown. But it's like, like I just that's that's when I express anxiety is\n\n32:24.360 --> 32:28.280\nthat's what I'm worried about. I definitely have like a coming home to Harmontown of like,\n\n32:28.280 --> 32:34.600\nI don't know, there's so much diversity in like 300 episodes, you know, at least four white people\n\n32:34.600 --> 32:47.400\nup here. Four white men. The hallmark of Harmontown is our rich diversity. I don't know how diversified\n\n32:47.400 --> 32:55.640\nthis show is. It's not my fault. Yeah, we've had in 301 episodes, we've had four women on stage.\n\n32:55.640 --> 33:01.880\nAnyways, continue Nova. Dan Harmon.wn's not good for sleep. I don't know. It's like the\n\n33:01.880 --> 33:06.920\nsorry about the live show thing. And then the diversity of like, there might be a guest and\n\n33:06.920 --> 33:10.520\nthat's like their voices different or whatever. But how does that slot? Well, like, like, like,\n\n33:10.520 --> 33:14.840\nis there a certain time of day or a certain activity that the podcast works especially\n\n33:14.840 --> 33:22.680\nbest for? It's best for Sims, just like making houses in Sims. Sims 4? Sims 4? Yeah. So like,\n\n33:22.680 --> 33:26.280\nlike that would be because I've listened to it while I played Minecraft and it does kind of work.\n\n33:26.280 --> 33:29.240\nI feel like when you talk about Minecraft, I'm like, yeah, that's how I feel about Sims.\n\n33:29.240 --> 33:32.600\nShould we get Sims as a sponsor and have Nova do an ad for us right now?\n\n33:34.040 --> 33:36.440\nYou can try it. Nova, do a little ad read and we're gonna, we're gonna,\n\n33:36.440 --> 33:49.960\nwe're gonna spec add. Hey, so Sims, very broken, very fun. Yeah, you get to live as little people,\n\n33:49.960 --> 33:53.160\nbut they don't do anything interesting. They just kind of go around the house. You make yourself\n\n33:53.160 --> 33:57.880\nfood and stuff. You can have little careers. I just like making houses because it's fun.\n\n33:58.520 --> 34:03.800\nDo you like green diamonds floating above heads? Do you like trapping people and swimming pools?\n\n34:03.800 --> 34:07.160\nDo you like watching your Sims go to the bathroom for a weirdly long time?\n\n34:07.160 --> 34:10.840\nDo you like making your Sims pee on the floor and mop it up while crying?\n\n34:10.840 --> 34:14.920\nNo, I don't like doing bad things to my Sims. It makes me feel sad. I get to attach to them.\n\n34:14.920 --> 34:18.760\nI'm like, they're people. I just like making houses mostly playing is not my favorite.\n\n34:18.760 --> 34:21.480\nOkay, I don't know if that was a good Sims ad, but I think it was. I don't think so.\n\n34:22.440 --> 34:27.800\nI started Sims and I played it for a while and then you come back home and it just flies\n\n34:27.800 --> 34:31.080\neverywhere and everyone's bummed out. I'm like, this is, I don't know why everyone who plays\n\n34:31.080 --> 34:36.840\nSims seems to be so bad at it. It's pretty easy for me. You have to be dedicated to it.\n\n34:37.720 --> 34:41.320\nYeah, you can't just leave it on and the Sims do weird things and you're like, no,\n\n34:41.320 --> 34:46.040\nyou have to go to work and you're all invested. You're like, no, you're gonna be late for work.\n\n34:46.600 --> 34:53.080\nI do get that Tomagachi anxiety. The idea of a game that if I leave it,\n\n34:54.280 --> 34:57.800\nI fuck up by doing nothing. I'm like, that's what I'm trying to get away from in life.\n\n34:57.800 --> 35:08.040\nAre there any other events where you get Tomagachi anxiety? If you're waiting in line at the bank,\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:15.720\ndo you get a Tomagachi anxiety? Or if traffic is like a parking lot on the coral\n\n35:15.720 --> 35:19.400\nvibe, we've all been there. Just imagine anyone listening to this show. Tomagachi\n\n35:20.040 --> 35:27.080\nanxiety. Or your mom is talking to you. You get a word and edgewise. That's when I get the\n\n35:27.080 --> 35:33.800\nTomagachi anxiety. You still like us both? Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, I don't get it.\n\n35:34.520 --> 35:40.120\nI just, I feel like Schrab's Schrab's level of chaos has leveled up because of his new chair.\n\n35:41.240 --> 35:45.960\nHe's feeling very relaxed. It's a big top, isn't it? Like, I've never been happier. It's like,\n\n35:47.560 --> 35:52.600\ndoes anyone, does anyone perceive the real story here, which is me throwing buckets of\n\n35:52.600 --> 35:57.560\nenabling on him, trying to make him happy? Like, like, like, should I dig a pit of spikes and have\n\n35:57.560 --> 36:02.920\nhim fall into it? And like, all I do is that the chairs have been getting more cushioned. I keep\n\n36:02.920 --> 36:07.400\nappeasing him more and more. I flew him to Boston. Like, no one's telling this story.\n\n36:09.320 --> 36:13.480\nYou're telling the story on the show. I know when it's uncharismatic for me to tell it. Someone\n\n36:13.480 --> 36:17.640\nelse has to tell it. Anyways, he's a monster. I don't know if anyone else can understand the\n\n36:17.640 --> 36:24.120\ncomplexities between you guys' 20-year relationship. Dan flew Rob out to Boston. Thanks.\n\n36:28.360 --> 36:34.280\nWas there more to this story? Aren't you guys going to buy weed together? I heard.\n\n36:34.280 --> 36:40.840\nYeah, we're gonna, we're gonna, I, I, okay, so here's the deal. Two weeks ago, Rob approached me.\n\n36:40.840 --> 36:48.120\nAnd I go, hey, Spencer, can you teach me how to vape? And Spencer said,\n\n36:49.160 --> 36:58.520\ngo on, go on. What's my line? Yes. Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay. And now he, we're gonna do it on Wednesday.\n\n36:58.520 --> 37:03.160\nYou guys are gonna go buy, go to a dispensary? Yeah, I told Schrab I would show him the ropes.\n\n37:03.160 --> 37:08.600\nJust wait a minute. A dispensary. Yeah, yeah, it sounds the same. Oh, yeah. Let me, let's run through\n\n37:08.600 --> 37:14.600\nsome names that sound like Spencer. Suspender. No, we've done this before. Suspense. Suspension.\n\n37:15.240 --> 37:22.520\nDispense. Dispenser. That's about all of them. But no, I told Schrab we'd take him to the store\n\n37:22.520 --> 37:27.320\nnext time I was going, but I haven't been smoking weed, so it like, it took a lot longer. So next\n\n37:27.320 --> 37:34.760\ntime you see me, I'm gonna be like, oh, peace and love, man. Man, you guys gotta, you guys gotta\n\n37:34.760 --> 37:44.840\njust relax. Peace and love, man. Why, why, why are you doing all the war, man? I'm talking about\n\n37:44.840 --> 37:52.040\npeace and love, man. We need to get down, just smoke some God. You got Maui, Maui, and leave this\n\n37:52.040 --> 37:58.040\nshit, man. So you, so you, Spencer, you know a dispensary that turns Rob into a black\n\n37:58.040 --> 38:04.680\nexploitation character? Man, you need to get down with the glass, man. I'm gonna smoke some\n\n38:04.680 --> 38:10.200\nvape. I'm gonna smoke all the vape. Nova, do you, do you vape it up? Do you, are you a vaporizer?\n\n38:10.200 --> 38:15.000\nNo, no, I've never done weed or cigarettes or anything. I'm not against it. I just haven't done\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:26.040\nit. Yeah. If you feel different, you drive different. What? You know what I'm saying?\n\n38:26.040 --> 38:30.680\nYou what different? You drive different, man. I would assume so. I gotta, I gotta go to this\n\n38:30.680 --> 38:35.000\ndispensary. Yeah, man. Fucking blow in my mind. I'd probably like it. Did they, did they, did they\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:43.160\nsell vape shirts and vape posters? They sell vape hats and vape socks. Fucking A, man. Vape socks,\n\n38:43.160 --> 38:49.000\nvape socks. What's a vape sock? It's a sock for your vape. All right. I'm gonna take some, I'm\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:56.600\ngonna take four vape socks, a couple hats. I'll take a vape. Now give me three. It's worse\n\n38:56.600 --> 39:01.000\nwhen you're up here. Yeah, it's worse when you're on stage. It's a lot of show. The show? Yeah.\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:09.000\nNo, no, no. I'm gonna take, I'll take three vape. Take one of these. Oh my god. Thank you. I'm so\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:13.080\nglad I did. This is why you're here. Finally. Like, and now I have to bring every single person up one\n\n39:13.080 --> 39:25.160\nat a time and go like, see? Like, but I mean, so where your parents are, are they, are they\n\n39:25.160 --> 39:30.840\nastronomers, public television supporters? They're kind of hippies. They like science. They likes\n\n39:30.840 --> 39:36.280\nthe show, I guess. They like the stars kind of thing. Carl Sagan kind of thing. No, they wanted\n\n39:36.280 --> 39:41.880\nsomething unique, but not like weird. And yeah, they like science. And they're kind of, yeah, I\n\n39:41.880 --> 39:50.280\ndon't know. Are you a scientific person too? I don't know. I like psychology and sociology and\n\n39:50.280 --> 39:54.360\nstuff, not so much like the physical sciences. I can't wrap my head around it like I don't care\n\n39:54.360 --> 39:57.800\nwhy, why a rock was formed. I don't know. They should have named you science. Seems important.\n\n39:57.800 --> 40:03.160\nThey should have named you mouth foods. What, what interests you about psychology and\n\n40:03.160 --> 40:12.840\nsociology? Like, which expound on those fascinations. Like, okay. Yeah, the kind of stuff that fascinates\n\n40:12.840 --> 40:18.840\nyou. I don't even know. But, um, well, I'll just go with the psychology, sociology thing. I really\n\n40:18.840 --> 40:26.920\nlike, I really like trying to figure out how people work. I don't know. I have, I have Asperger's,\n\n40:26.920 --> 40:32.920\nso I'm always trying to like, yeah, yeah. I know I feel the same way. I feel like I really need to\n\n40:32.920 --> 40:37.160\nunderstand people. Why do people are doing what they're doing? Yeah, because I just don't get it.\n\n40:37.160 --> 40:42.200\nWhat are they thinking? I don't understand. I don't know why I'm doing what I'm doing. I don't\n\n40:42.200 --> 40:47.800\nknow what people, I like trying to figure out the things. It'd be comforting to think there was maybe\n\n40:47.800 --> 40:53.400\na couple rules. Yeah. I would be very nice to know why people do some of the things they do,\n\n40:53.400 --> 40:57.800\nnot even because I'm upset about it, just because it's like, why, why, why, why am I doing what I\n\n40:57.800 --> 41:02.520\ndo? So do you think, like, do you see yourself in this? Look, this is a question grown-ups ask kids\n\n41:02.520 --> 41:09.000\nthat gets frustrating. So your answer, you can plead the fifth. But like, do you see yourself\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:14.520\nin any kind of vocation in particular? Is there a fantasy job? The only thing that I've really\n\n41:14.520 --> 41:18.840\nalways been, there's, there's, like, everything that I see, I'm like, I want to do that. I want\n\n41:18.840 --> 41:22.760\nto do that. I want to do that. But the thing that I've always been like, yes, that absolutely\n\n41:22.760 --> 41:27.800\nsounds amazing, is I've always liked acting, like always, like theater acting, not like I want to be\n\n41:27.800 --> 41:32.120\na star or whatever, but I don't know. I just, yeah, I like being in plays and stuff. Just showing up\n\n41:32.120 --> 41:37.720\nand doing the job. Yeah, exactly. There's not like take-home work. I mean, there is, but not like,\n\n41:37.720 --> 41:42.680\nduring the show's run at least. But did you do theater, like high school, college? Yeah, I always\n\n41:42.680 --> 41:47.560\ndid. Like, the second that I was old enough to be in the school play and elementary school, because\n\n41:47.560 --> 41:53.000\nyou weren't allowed to do it. What play? In fourth grade. Peter Pan. Who'd you play? Gentlemen\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:57.960\nStarkey. Uh, he's not like famous. He's like, there's like Captain Hook, Smee, then Starkey,\n\n41:57.960 --> 42:02.840\nand he was really like, unhappy. Oh yeah, no, he's, or no, that's, that's neat. Sorry, I was thinking\n\n42:02.840 --> 42:08.760\nit was neat. That role is the anchor of the third act. Actually, he's a plot point. Do you remember\n\n42:08.760 --> 42:16.680\nany of his lines? No. No, I just remember him being like, I gotta take my gun out and then Smee\n\n42:16.680 --> 42:22.120\nbeing like, dude, for real. No, they're children. Like, stop. I don't know. It was really fun. I like\n\n42:22.120 --> 42:29.800\nhim feelings a lot. Don't you wonder, like, if acting was a job that, if all jobs kind of,\n\n42:29.800 --> 42:34.760\nif there was some fantasy society where everything paid kind of in accordance with some sort of\n\n42:34.760 --> 42:41.480\nshared value system, like, because acting has this like built-in thing where it's like, well,\n\n42:41.480 --> 42:47.240\nmaybe one day you'll be Batman. And because one day you'll be Batman, and then you'll buy a million\n\n42:47.240 --> 42:50.840\nhouses, like- You suffer now by being a little cat through commercials or whatever.\n\n42:50.840 --> 42:54.200\nAnd so if you tell your mom, she's just like, well, what are you doing? Well, I'm acting. And\n\n42:54.200 --> 42:57.960\nshe's like, well, I hope you get a break. And she means like, maybe one day you'll be Batman.\n\n42:57.960 --> 43:02.360\nBut it's like, well, that's not necessarily a result of me acting well. And I'm kind of actually\n\n43:02.360 --> 43:10.280\ncurious, like, people who like, like, like, if we really got to choose and we could make a living\n\n43:10.280 --> 43:15.480\nwage, and you could like do backbreaking acting work in a theater, and it had nothing, it wasn't\n\n43:15.480 --> 43:22.600\nattached to this idea of my goal is to be Susan Sarandon. And the, and it was just like, actually,\n\n43:22.600 --> 43:28.680\nI would like to do this for my life if you, as a society, could provide me with a guarantee that\n\n43:28.680 --> 43:34.440\nI can do it for 30 years. Like, like, that we could like come into Black Box Theater and go like,\n\n43:34.440 --> 43:39.960\nhello, I'm Aunt Susan. And people would be like, yay. Yeah, I think you can like, I mean, do you think\n\n43:39.960 --> 43:44.120\nthat everyone would be like, I want that job, that's a privileged job? Because I don't think so. I\n\n43:44.120 --> 43:48.520\nthink people would be like, no, that sucks. No, people think like, if you say you want to be an actor\n\n43:48.520 --> 43:52.120\nor a singer, people are like, oh, you know, just like, yeah, every little kid wants to be an actor\n\n43:52.120 --> 43:54.920\nor a singer, because they want to be famous and want people to pay attention to that stuff. But\n\n43:54.920 --> 44:00.200\nif fame wasn't an actual like thing, it was like, you actually saw what it took to be like, I would\n\n44:00.200 --> 44:05.720\nstill love acting. And I think a lot of people would never want to be an actor. Yeah, they're\n\n44:05.720 --> 44:12.200\ntotally happy. Kind of like washing dishes. Yeah, I mean, is there a role that you like, if you could\n\n44:12.200 --> 44:17.560\ndo any role like on any like either small theater or like, like Broadway, like, is there a certain\n\n44:17.560 --> 44:23.400\nrole that you would freak out for? I would, there's like a lot, I would love to, there's a lot,\n\n44:24.200 --> 44:29.080\nI don't know, that's, there's like a long list and stuff, but I would absolutely love to be like,\n\n44:29.080 --> 44:34.440\nI don't know, I've been, I've always been cast into like small character roles. And then I've also\n\n44:34.440 --> 44:39.400\nnever been considered kind of feminine enough or masculine enough for any of the characters. So I\n\n44:39.400 --> 44:43.400\nalways end up with little bit roles and stuff that can kind of be gender neutral. And I would love\n\n44:43.400 --> 44:47.720\nto be like a protagonist or something like Seymour in Little Shop of Horrors or like,\n\n44:47.720 --> 44:51.720\nsomething like that. Let's construct a gender neutral protagonist role and we'll do a, I don't\n\n44:51.720 --> 44:55.320\nknow, it could be a male role, but just if they would cast me in it and be like, I'm allowed to\n\n44:55.320 --> 44:59.960\nplay that role. Let's figure something out and then we'll, we'll do an embarrassing improvised\n\n44:59.960 --> 45:04.200\nversion of it. Would you rather be a male lead in a show or a female lead? Yeah. Yeah. See,\n\n45:04.200 --> 45:08.760\nyou as a Seymour would be fantastic, I would love that. Thanks. All right, then I'll be, I'll be\n\n45:08.760 --> 45:16.600\nyour, your, your either, either your, your, my Audrey. Yeah, I'll be your, I'll be your plant,\n\n45:16.600 --> 45:20.680\nyour Audrey. I'd love to be the plant too. That's a big dream is to be the plant. I wouldn't even\n\n45:20.680 --> 45:24.520\nhave to be on stage, but I could just be turned up behind stage. Oh yeah, you could really ham it\n\n45:24.520 --> 45:31.160\nup. Act one, here we go. This is Nova's, she's not auditioning. This is just her living her, her life.\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:40.920\nI'm a plant. I'm not doing any. Seymour, what do you, why are you, you're denying me?\n\n45:43.240 --> 45:49.400\nLike, I know it's yes and, but this is a little, hmm. Okay, Seymour, I understand. I respect your\n\n45:49.400 --> 45:54.920\nboundaries. Thank you, Audrey too. I love you. Please don't eat me. You don't, you don't get to be a\n\n45:54.920 --> 46:00.920\nfunctioning plant without being able to work with your environment. I get it. Okay. All right, that's\n\n46:00.920 --> 46:06.360\ngood. Look, I would love to play along, but being on stage here is enough. I got up of a boundary\n\n46:06.360 --> 46:12.840\nsomewhere. Sure. That was a good plant, Dan. I liked your plant. It was very meek, which was\n\n46:12.840 --> 46:18.440\ninteresting. Yeah, I'm willing to take risks. He's usually played very big and stuff. Hey, Dan.\n\n46:18.440 --> 46:23.960\nDan, I just saw a church, and I went and saw a fantastic production. It's in Hollywood,\n\n46:23.960 --> 46:28.920\nif you guys are around until the 16th of Cabaret, which I love. It's a really good production.\n\n46:29.480 --> 46:34.520\nIn a very tiny theater at the Lex, or the, it's a celebration theater. It's called Cabaret at the\n\n46:34.520 --> 46:41.640\nLex. It's really, really good. You like Cabaret? I have not seen it, but I would love to. Yeah,\n\n46:42.440 --> 46:45.480\nI recommend it. You must go to it. Dan, you want to do a little Cabaret for us?\n\n46:45.480 --> 46:50.760\nYeah, I have a memory. Are you familiar with the film or the play? Of course. Front to back. All\n\n46:50.760 --> 46:59.000\nright. It's a musical. Chicago, I know. That's kind of similar. What do you know about? It's a musical\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:07.720\nabout Nazi times. Yeah, Nazi times. And there's a cabaret that you're in. Okay. I'll just start\n\n47:07.720 --> 47:12.120\nlike doing a little umpire kind of intro. I know Cabaret. I know the whole show.\n\n47:12.120 --> 47:16.120\nRight. That's, of course, you're doing me a very well-known song.\n\n47:18.440 --> 47:30.680\nThere's a cabaret starting right now. You're about to see a cabaret with me.\n\n47:30.680 --> 47:42.600\nIt doesn't matter if there's Nazis. It doesn't matter if there's not cabaret. I have a cabaret\n\n47:42.600 --> 47:54.840\nfor you. Subtext. I saw the whole show. I'm very familiar with it. I'm sorry. Yeah. I have a degree.\n\n47:54.840 --> 48:00.200\nI got a degree in it. I thought I was throwing you a curve ball. No, not at all. Cabaret,\n\n48:00.200 --> 48:07.880\nI get it. It's a show. How about let's do a little Music Man? Right. Music Man. Robert Preston.\n\n48:07.880 --> 48:13.320\nYeah. Like Gary Indiana. Gary Anthony Williams. Gary Anthony Williams.\n\n48:15.800 --> 48:24.360\nThat's a deep cut. Yeah. No, I saw that movie. He keeps telling everybody they're going to have\n\n48:24.360 --> 48:31.320\ntrumpets. But then he's a con artist. And then the lady's like, you ain't got no trumpets.\n\n48:31.320 --> 48:35.880\nAnd then he's like, no, I got trumpets for real. And then at the end, he has magic trumpets.\n\n48:37.560 --> 48:41.080\nThey get some real trumpets. The trumpets are fake. They get some real trumpets. Dream trumpets. Do\n\n48:41.080 --> 48:45.560\nyou know? Do you see? I haven't seen it in a long time. They get real trumpets and they come in,\n\n48:45.560 --> 48:49.800\nbut he doesn't know how to teach music. Right. But they all know how to play them. No,\n\n48:49.800 --> 48:53.160\nthey don't. Because he normally splits town before that with everybody's money,\n\n48:53.160 --> 48:56.200\nbut he falls in love with the... But then in the end, they all come in and they're like,\n\n48:56.200 --> 49:02.680\nfoot, foot up, and they don't know how to play. But they all suck. And they're all terrible.\n\n49:02.680 --> 49:10.120\nBut the families, the parents, they're so proud of their kids for even playing shitty music.\n\n49:10.120 --> 49:14.360\nWhich is kind of a linear progression, because that's exactly what we already understood to be\n\n49:14.360 --> 49:17.560\nthe con, that the parents would be so proud that he would sell them the instruments. No, no, no.\n\n49:17.560 --> 49:21.240\nThere's no curvature in that story. Normally, he sells them the instruments,\n\n49:21.240 --> 49:25.640\nsells them the uniforms, and then fucks off with the money. But he's able to sell them based on\n\n49:25.640 --> 49:29.800\nthe parents' pride and desire for their kids to be special. But normally, he's gone before they\n\n49:29.800 --> 49:37.080\nfind out that he... So, this is a time he sticks around to find out that... That some problems\n\n49:37.080 --> 49:44.360\nsolve themselves, as they do in shitty stories. It's like if Godzilla was about to fight Mathura\n\n49:44.360 --> 49:54.040\nand had a heart attack. And the Japanese army is like, look, Godzilla, he ate too much sandwich.\n\n49:54.040 --> 50:00.840\nOh, boo. Oh, boo. Wow. What was that, actually? What did you say? It was... It was Godzilla.\n\n50:00.840 --> 50:07.720\nCome on. Is this Lyman's? Somebody called... Crazy rich Asians is... That's literally the title.\n\n50:07.720 --> 50:14.840\nAnd you come off with that Charlie Chan bullshit. What the fuck in 1979?\n\n50:14.840 --> 50:20.120\nI just said Godzilla in Crazy Rich Asian Food. Oh, God. You guys are weak.\n\n50:21.720 --> 50:27.880\nSee, this is interesting, because at least in Japan, don't they literally transpose the L and R\n\n50:27.880 --> 50:33.240\nsyllable? So, I mean, definitely, it's still racist because that's what we make fun of them for.\n\n50:33.240 --> 50:40.360\nGod, Zira. They use the R. It just seems tricky. I mean, we should definitely avoid it, but I just\n\n50:40.360 --> 50:47.560\nlike, that is what happens. Yeah, but it's like... It's the danger of coming up with rules for racism\n\n50:47.560 --> 50:52.520\nis that you don't want anybody to think that the goal is to get away with being racist or prove\n\n50:52.520 --> 50:57.000\nthat they're not racist, because you don't want anybody... Somebody asked me in an interview today\n\n50:57.800 --> 51:02.040\nis so-and-so racist. It was a gotcha question about somebody well-known and so supposed to\n\n51:02.040 --> 51:09.000\nanswer the question. And I said, that's a deeply irresponsible question to ask or answer about\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:17.800\nanybody right now, because if you... Is the goal to get a not racist card from Monday\n\n51:17.800 --> 51:25.880\nso that you can be as racist as possible on Wednesday? There is no... You don't want to ask\n\n51:25.880 --> 51:31.800\nthat or answer that. What you want to do is try to maybe figure out how to not be racist\n\n51:31.800 --> 51:35.880\ntomorrow, which is probably going to change the definition. Right, like a lot of sensitivity\n\n51:35.880 --> 51:40.040\ntraining and stuff for like, don't be racist, don't be sexist is more like, don't say these words,\n\n51:40.040 --> 51:44.920\nor that kind of thing, which makes people go, oh, so how do I get around those words when the whole\n\n51:44.920 --> 51:49.400\nleitmotif is like, empathy, empathy, empathy. How not to do sexist or racist things, but you're\n\n51:49.400 --> 51:59.160\nstill sexist or racist? Like, you know, not like you, but like a person. If the movement was focused\n\n51:59.160 --> 52:03.960\non like, it was like, hey, there's people out here. Not like you. Like a person. Hey, there's\n\n52:03.960 --> 52:15.480\npeople out here. Like an actual human. Like a person with feelings. I won't have those words put\n\n52:15.480 --> 52:23.080\nin my mouth. I just repeated what you said, sweetheart. Okay, fine. Darling. But it's hard to\n\n52:23.080 --> 52:26.760\ncome up with rules, like just treat people like people. Treat them like they were your best friend,\n\n52:26.760 --> 52:31.320\nand then you're like, well, my best friends and I used to play smear the queer with the ball up as\n\n52:31.320 --> 52:37.240\nrare. It's like, yeah, what I'm saying to you is like, wasn't a great game. Wait, I never was\n\n52:37.240 --> 52:44.600\nsatisfying enough for the language. I never heard the ball of the rear part. 70s, Wisconsin.\n\n52:45.880 --> 52:51.960\nProblematized. Yeah. But anyways, but yeah, I know it's time wears on. It's just like, oh,\n\n52:51.960 --> 52:57.720\nwait a minute, like all this all these rules have to be about like, can we actually worry about\n\n52:57.720 --> 53:02.200\nhurting each other? Like stopping people saying a word doesn't mean everyone's suddenly not racist\n\n53:02.200 --> 53:08.680\nor sexist. In fact, it actually teaches people how to exploit certain rules because hackers are\n\n53:08.680 --> 53:13.160\nall about code. You can talk really well and then not say certain words and stuff. And then somebody\n\n53:13.160 --> 53:17.080\nwho doesn't really know the who doesn't really know the rules or whatever, but they're clearly like a\n\n53:17.080 --> 53:23.480\ngood person who's not racist or sexist or whatever. They're not on the real like the wavelength of\n\n53:23.480 --> 53:30.040\nlike, we're not allowed to say this anymore or something like that. And conversely, the kinds\n\n53:30.040 --> 53:36.360\nof people who are into rules, i.e., like those are the people that are going to be the first people\n\n53:36.360 --> 53:41.000\nto like adapt and pick up on shit and go like, oh, so if I say this and don't say that and then I\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:43.880\nsay this and don't say that and then if you said that and then you said that and then you said that\n\n53:43.880 --> 53:49.720\nand they're like the kinds of people that have those kinds of brains, they're pretty largely\n\n53:49.720 --> 53:57.400\ndangerous people. They got that way because they are not focused on empathy. Yeah, they're more\n\n53:57.400 --> 54:02.200\nconcerned with like self-image rather than actually being good to other people. They're just like,\n\n54:02.200 --> 54:06.280\nI want everyone to think that I'm being good to other people or whatever. I don't know, I don't\n\n54:06.280 --> 54:09.240\nwant it to, I'm like scared to talk about this too much. Yeah, I don't want to drag you into\n\n54:09.240 --> 54:16.040\nsomeone's pit where they're like, did you hear Harbid Town? You're a friend Nova. I have a few\n\n54:16.040 --> 54:27.800\nbones to pick. Anyways. Nova, what's your last name? Mandel? You, what? Mandel? Okay. You wanted\n\n54:27.800 --> 54:32.440\nto be special. My name? Nova special? Nova special. I don't know, like there's like Nova\n\n54:32.440 --> 54:37.640\nspecials, right? I don't know. My name's already Nova, like I'm identifiable. If somebody actually\n\n54:37.640 --> 54:41.160\nknows me or is in my life, they'll be like, that's Nova. They're not going to be like,\n\n54:41.160 --> 54:44.840\nthat's a different John or whatever. It's not like the Mandel gives me away.\n\n54:47.320 --> 54:56.280\nThere's a Nova special that I can never watch because my dogs won't allow me. It's about dogs.\n\n54:56.280 --> 55:00.200\nThey freak out too much. It's the one about dogs. I don't think I've ever seen an episode of Nova,\n\n55:00.200 --> 55:04.680\nexcept I remember one time in science class, they were like, let's put on a movie. So they put on\n\n55:04.680 --> 55:10.200\nNova. So then it was like the big logo flashed on the screen, Nova. And then like big dramatic\n\n55:10.200 --> 55:17.400\nmusic and everyone was like, yeah. We get to make out. What? What'd you say? I didn't hear.\n\n55:18.600 --> 55:23.160\nIt's cool. I left Nova. I watch it all the time. Thanks. Yeah.\n\n55:25.320 --> 55:29.880\nYeah. Didn't you ask me to talk about how I am? I mean, we can talk about anything you want.\n\n55:29.880 --> 55:34.520\nOkay, good. Moving forward. Well, I think she was going to eulogize John McCain, right?\n\n55:34.520 --> 55:47.000\nNo. Yeah, I just, yeah, you listened to the show. You know, like, what's my job? What am I supposed\n\n55:47.000 --> 55:52.920\nto do? It's, I think it's the same from that it's always been. I mean, maybe it's been different\n\n55:52.920 --> 55:58.120\nin your head, but it's always like kind of seemed the same of, well, you can have a lot of internal\n\n55:58.120 --> 56:02.120\nthings going on. And then we kind of get the same results at the end or whatever. You just,\n\n56:02.120 --> 56:07.000\nyou know, you come out and you talk and then it's like, it's your show. You have Spencer and you have\n\n56:08.040 --> 56:15.720\nJeff and then you have Schrab. Hey. Can I ask you a question? Okay. When is he doing it right?\n\n56:17.240 --> 56:22.680\nWell, I don't, I don't know. Would you listening to it? You're like, oh, yeah, this is, this is he's\n\n56:22.680 --> 56:26.440\ndoing it right. Well, Harmontown is Harmontown. Like there's like, if you're talking about like\n\n56:26.440 --> 56:30.680\nyour dog door or whatever, like I might think it's hilarious and then somebody else might be like,\n\n56:30.680 --> 56:34.200\nand then you might be talking about a drink you had and then someone else might think it's hilarious.\n\n56:34.200 --> 56:39.400\nAnd I might be like, but I always love the show because if I, I don't get people who are like,\n\n56:39.400 --> 56:42.920\nI hit every episode except these kinds of episodes. Like, I mean, if you're like that,\n\n56:42.920 --> 56:48.760\nfine, be picky with your stuff. But for me, it's just, but for me, it's just like, I love,\n\n56:48.760 --> 56:53.000\nlike, I love Harmontown and I probably wouldn't listen to it if I didn't always really like it.\n\n56:53.800 --> 56:57.880\nAnd I don't know. I'm really like, you talk a lot about how special it was at like\n\n56:57.880 --> 57:05.080\nthe meltdown and stuff. And like, I'm like sad that I never got to go there because I was like,\n\n57:05.080 --> 57:08.440\nlistening to every single episode through and I was like, when I catch up, I'll go and then you\n\n57:08.440 --> 57:16.120\nguys had lost Starburns. And what was that? No, this is so sad that there's already a post\n\n57:16.120 --> 57:23.000\nmeltdown generation. That's so sad. Are you going to stab your parents? Like, like, like,\n\n57:23.000 --> 57:28.520\nit's a whole generation board. I'm always going to stab your parents. No, I've always been happy\n\n57:28.520 --> 57:34.600\nto still listen to the show. But are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Are you going to weaponize your\n\n57:34.600 --> 57:42.280\ntiny Rick and Morty backpack? Fill it with rocks. That could be something that was too ready an\n\n57:42.280 --> 57:50.040\nanswer. That was. I just saw it and I just thought rocks. I like that you went stone age on that.\n\n57:50.040 --> 57:53.400\nThat's fantastic. I don't fill with knives or something just rocks. That's fine.\n\n57:55.800 --> 57:59.800\nYeah, I mean, every time I am the exits are two to the right.\n\n58:02.680 --> 58:06.760\nI don't know. I'll just I'll just talk about like, since I've been coming here and stuff like,\n\n58:08.120 --> 58:10.760\nyeah, I caught up with all the episodes and I was like, oh, they don't have a theater. And then I\n\n58:10.760 --> 58:13.880\nkept thinking like, please don't end, please don't end, please don't end if they can't find a theater\n\n58:13.880 --> 58:18.280\nor whatever. And you guys came here and I was so happy. And then every single time I'm like, I hope\n\n58:18.280 --> 58:22.200\nhe's not like I'm good on the show. I hope he's not like I'm good on the show. Hope he's not gonna\n\n58:22.200 --> 58:26.920\nwhat? End the show and the show. Oh, God, I don't want to hold people hostage with that. That's awful.\n\n58:28.040 --> 58:33.320\nHorrible archetype. Maybe you'll end the show. What do you think? No, no, no, I don't feel that way\n\n58:33.320 --> 58:38.760\nat all. I know. I mean, I blow things up in my head. So I hear like one tone and I'm like,\n\n58:38.760 --> 58:43.880\nyeah, clearly, I'm participating in that somehow or you wouldn't be saying that. Yeah, no, I mean,\n\n58:43.880 --> 58:51.080\nI guess. Are you gonna end the show, Dan? Let me think about it. It depends how many people\n\n58:51.080 --> 58:57.000\nlove me. No, I know, I really don't. That's not my intention. Dan will not end the show. But I mean,\n\n58:57.000 --> 59:06.680\nevery time I, but I mean, almost every single week since since you started doing the shows here,\n\n59:06.680 --> 59:11.000\nI just I come early. So I'm ahead in line. And then I make friends with someone in line. And then\n\n59:11.000 --> 59:15.880\nsome people come back like a lot. And then we sit next to each other during the show. And then,\n\n59:16.760 --> 59:21.160\nyou know, I love the show. After listening to the podcast so long, then coming here,\n\n59:21.160 --> 59:28.200\nlike the first couple shows, which is like, I get really excited by things. So I was like,\n\n59:28.200 --> 59:32.840\ncompletely starstruck. And now it's I've calmed down a little bit. Now you're over it for sure.\n\n59:32.840 --> 59:39.240\nNo, I'm not over it, sir. I'm just like, now you felt the onstage sadness that goes on up here.\n\n59:39.240 --> 59:44.280\nNo, I'm just like, my excitement levels are off the charts. Now I can just actually like enjoy\n\n59:44.280 --> 59:49.080\nthe show without this. I kind of get it in the sense of like, like the podcast that I listen to,\n\n59:49.080 --> 59:54.680\nsome of them I even like Cody and I talk about like very candidly, in a way that I wouldn't\n\n59:54.680 --> 59:59.560\nyou like, are we we're hate listening to this podcast, we love this podcast. It's like, the\n\n59:59.560 --> 01:00:06.760\nlines blur. But the behavior doesn't change, which is something a guy like me would obsess about.\n\n01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:13.800\nLike, wait, am I doing good or bad? You like me or hate me. But it's like a podcast that\n\n01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:17.800\nthat people are listening to, they're listening to because it's like part of their family. And\n\n01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:24.920\nyour family, you're like, you're like, Uncle Henry, like, whatever, like, I don't do I do\n\n01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:30.360\nI admire him? Do I do I think I should do what he says or anything? It's just sort of like,\n\n01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:34.280\nno, he's Uncle Henry is always there. Because I listen to these podcasts that are like sort of,\n\n01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:40.280\nif they experiment too much, I actually get mad at them. And I'm kind of like, like, oh,\n\n01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:44.760\nthis guy always does that. And then I put it on and I'm like, then they do something different.\n\n01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:49.640\nAnd I'm like, what are you doing? Stop it. Well, I'm not listening for anything other than just\n\n01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:54.120\nthe people that are on the show. You and Spencer and Jeff and then whoever else might be here,\n\n01:00:54.120 --> 01:01:04.280\nlike, Rob or Brandon or whatever. God bless you. God bless you. I don't need it. I don't need it.\n\n01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:08.280\nWhoever else. You're doing a great job. You guys are the three that are here every week. Yeah,\n\n01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:13.560\nalso, we are. And there's Brandon. This is exactly what Dan wants to hear. You're doing great.\n\n01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:18.360\nNo, that was that specific. I was like, do you need a drink or anything? I wish.\n\n01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:24.440\nOh, no. Can I pour your drink? You're all right. Do you drink? You don't get high,\n\n01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:31.240\nbut do you drink? Are you driving? Do you pass the popcorn? Don't give them the popcorn.\n\n01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:35.160\nI was going to offer my popcorn because I had about the same amount left. I'm okay. Thank you.\n\n01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:39.880\nNo, not again. There's not a lot left. Are you sure you want it?\n\n01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:47.320\nYes, give it to me. There's not enough left. There's plenty. Look at this.\n\n01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:53.080\nThat's the best stuff. I have to enjoy it really hard out of spite.\n\n01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:58.280\nYou get that bottom of the popcorn bag, toothbreaker shit. That's the saltiest stuff.\n\n01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:05.880\nDon't put it on my bag. Would you say, though, among your top, if you were to grab a couple\n\n01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:10.760\nwords, like an adjective, I present you with a C of adjectives, and I say, Nova.\n\n01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:22.440\nNova, pick your, like, here's a handful of adjectives, and you're just grabbing them. Go.\n\n01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:33.080\nWould you, true or false, from the Dan Harmon thing, you're like, oh, well, honesty. I want\n\n01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:37.800\nhonesty. Dan's going to be honest with me. You're going to grab honesty, right? Transparency.\n\n01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:46.040\nDon't make a sound. I mean, or do because I'm transparent and I'll deal with the fucking hurt\n\n01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:52.040\nthat you just inflicted on me in real time when you're like, because you're such an, you're so\n\n01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:58.360\nhonest, that person that they're like, if he's honest, if he's, fuck you, I'm going to kill myself\n\n01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:06.760\nand mention you in the note. C3H. You don't even know. That's your seat.\n\n01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:11.960\nUsed to say that a lot. Like, I'm going to write a suicide note. You're going to be in it.\n\n01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:16.280\nLike, it's an awesome, it's an awesome fucking burn, isn't it? It's hard to kill yourself and\n\n01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:20.280\nmention you in the note. It goes hard. It does not go late at a person like baller.\n\n01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:25.080\nIt's like your version of baller. Yeah. You're balling. I'm a baller, like\n\n01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:32.360\ndepressive kind of every baller. Manic depressive baller. Yeah. But I also don't advocate for.\n\n01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:36.440\nI got to say, you and Nova, I've just met her, but I've known you for a long time. You guys are\n\n01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:44.360\nboth some real manic depressive ballers. Thanks, man. It's true. But anyway,\n\n01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:48.440\nQuentin Crisp said in a suicide note, you should never take anybody with you. You should be classy\n\n01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:52.760\nabout it. Like, don't say like, oh, I blame that person. Like, you leave it alone.\n\n01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:55.720\nI'm trying to figure out. That's why you're a suicide note writer.\n\n01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:02.200\nIt's a little suicide note. Remember that tonight. Some jokes are funny because they go too far.\n\n01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:04.840\nLike, I'm going to put you in my suicide note, but it has to be the time and the place,\n\n01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.800\nlike Harmontown is the time and the place, because that's the way that they should know it.\n\n01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:13.240\nAnd I have a rich tradition of perfectly blocking the tightrope. I never. Yeah, everyone loves it.\n\n01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:21.000\nI've never faulted. I mean, yeah, with the honesty thing, it's less honesty, specifically that word.\n\n01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.600\nThe word is more authenticity. Like, and like, genuineness or whatever of like, you just come\n\n01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:30.520\nout here and be yourself. You're not like, okay, this is like, I don't know. I've never really.\n\n01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:34.120\nSo then if that person is going through a crisis where they're like, who the fuck am I?\n\n01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:41.400\nThen it's like, start things start to get a little bit brektian to borrow a phrase that I\n\n01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:47.720\nheard a college student once say. I hardly know what it means. But you know, like, it's like,\n\n01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:55.240\noh, shit, like, like where that's the thing. Like, oh, hey, the podcast is about me figuring out\n\n01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:59.320\nwhat the podcast is. And then you're like, well, that and 50 cents will get me a Snickers.\n\n01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:04.040\nI mean, I've never like not listened to an episode because you're in a bad mood, but like\n\n01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:12.840\nI saw I'm dating myself 50 cents once bought you a Snickers that in a pot, a handful of shit will\n\n01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:20.040\nfill one hand. I don't understand what that was supposed to what that dad's point was. I have no\n\n01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:25.640\nidea. I can't even begin to kind of be real mean, I think was his point. Yeah, just trying to kind\n\n01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:31.720\nof be smart. He was sort of indoctrinating his son into a world of substance. He's saying like,\n\n01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:38.040\nwelcome to the world of substance. Like, real things are shit. Anything that fills your hand\n\n01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:44.280\nis worth something. And that's it. But it's like, things that are real are shit. Are you saying\n\n01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:50.920\nthat because the guy that owns you has a hand full of something invisible called credit? Like,\n\n01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:56.120\nlike, don't you work for a fucking corporation that doesn't even have a hand that is already filled\n\n01:05:56.120 --> 01:06:02.840\nwith like fucking debt? I know it makes me mad. Fuck dad. Not dad. Yeah. I mean, yeah, but like,\n\n01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:08.360\nyou know, capitalism and stuff. Fuck capitalism and dad. Fuck capitalism and dad. For the same\n\n01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:11.640\nreason. Except for the narrow window of capitalism that assures me an exit strategy.\n\n01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:22.920\nIt's basically saying don't dream because like, what is a wish? Like, I have to go to work this\n\n01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:28.680\nmorning. He's kind of saying like, let me try to like, like, like, punch up his like, like, like,\n\n01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:35.880\nlike he's like, here's, here's, here's my pitch on what are you saying? Hey, son, poop in one hand\n\n01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:44.120\nand wish in the other and tell me which gets you more peanuts. Neither. No, poop has peanuts in\n\n01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:48.280\nit. It's gross, but only if you eat peanuts. It doesn't just have peanuts in it. Magic. No,\n\n01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:51.400\npoop comes right now. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. Okay. I didn't know\n\n01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:58.520\nit. You didn't watch Nova. I got one. Hey, I got one. I got one. Eat these peanuts. Hey,\n\n01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:03.720\nI got now shit in your hand. Hey, I got. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, mine requires a certain\n\n01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:10.280\namount of peanuts. I got one shit in one hand. Shit in the other hand.\n\n01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:17.640\nI'd see all the shit in your hand. Yeah. And you can kill them both with one stone, right?\n\n01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:22.520\nWish you had some soap and wish and see what happens because you don't have the hand.\n\n01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:29.560\nThere's more shit. Shit in one hand. Shit in the other hand. Look at the mess you made. Now,\n\n01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:34.840\ngo to the bathroom and clean up the shit on your hands before we have dinner. That's life.\n\n01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:41.880\nShit in one hand. Shit in the other hand. Then you'll find out whether you're left or right-handed.\n\n01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:49.640\nWhich one you drop faster or something? You always poop. Shit in both hands at the same time.\n\n01:07:49.640 --> 01:08:02.040\nRub them on your feet. Roll around in it. Eat the shit. Wish you didn't do that.\n\n01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:09.320\nAnd see what happens. And be like, wish for the shit to be gone. See if anything happens,\n\n01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:20.120\nyou know, just like... It's weird that the anti-wish lobby is so adamant about fictionalizing their\n\n01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:24.760\nmetaphors to drive it home. It's like, aren't you a pragmatist? Just tell me, wishes don't mean\n\n01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:31.800\nanything. Like, what's with the narrative, fucking anti-wish man? Like, hey, why don't you take a\n\n01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:36.680\nwish and put it in a dragon's ass? Like, whoa, hey, what are we in Narnia here? I thought wishes\n\n01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:41.480\ndon't mean anything. I think wishes are worth more than shit, at least in this world. Definitely.\n\n01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:46.600\nI mean, shit is like literal negative value in most situations. Yeah, you got to wash it off.\n\n01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:49.640\nYou're like, I got to get rid of this. It's a liability. You have work to do. You're like,\n\n01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:54.200\nI got to get rid of this shit. It's based on classics that actually landed. Like, daddisms,\n\n01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:59.720\nlike for instance, my dad would say, if you would go, well, if we do this and they would do that,\n\n01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:06.520\nmy dad would say, if my aunt had balls, she'd be my uncle. Or if frogs had wings, they would\n\n01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:16.120\nbump their ass a hoppin'. Ifs and buts were dicks. We'd all have a merry Christmas.\n\n01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:21.080\nYeah, it turns out, actually, life caught up to dad. If my aunt had balls, she'd be my uncle. Now\n\n01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:26.840\nyou could say, actually, dad, let's ask them what pronoun they'd prefer. Yeah, I would actually,\n\n01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:31.000\na huge thing that I actually really love about the show is that there's been like transgender people\n\n01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:36.600\non stage because like, I'm transgender and there's like, they're nowhere to be found. Like, you know,\n\n01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:42.920\nif birds and bees were poos and bees, I was being sincere. The air would smell all stinky.\n\n01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:46.280\nNow I'm embarrassed that I brought it up because you made a joke of it.\n\n01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:51.160\nNo, you felt vulnerable and you felt like you assailed your vulnerability. No, I'm\n\n01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:56.440\nglad you feel, I'm glad that you feel comfortable about that. I didn't mean to assail your\n\n01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:00.760\nvulnerability. That's okay. I love that you've talked about it. It's amazing. I am not a person\n\n01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:06.280\nwho is. Makes me very happy. I try to police myself being reactive to things like, I sense\n\n01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:11.480\nmy reactions to things like, I'm an old man and then I see something in the headlines and I,\n\n01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:15.240\nyou know, I have that same instinct that other people have. I go, well, now this,\n\n01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:19.960\noh brother. Yeah, these bird scooters. I feel like an old man too. I see things like, oh,\n\n01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:24.840\nthis new technology and I'm like, for like, you know, some new culture. I'm like, why are they\n\n01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:28.440\ndoing that? You know, but then I try to go like, well, wait a minute, what are we doing here?\n\n01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:33.400\nYeah, I try to be like, okay, so what if people are doing something like either it'll pass or\n\n01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:37.400\nif it's like not like a dumb thing, then maybe we'll stick around and it'll be fine.\n\n01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:44.040\nHey, if you guys, if you guys tried the void, the VR experience, the VR thing at the Glendale\n\n01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:49.320\nGallery. Yeah. Yeah. Levy, where is the, I don't mean to be, I think the ice bucket. Oh, yeah,\n\n01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:55.320\nthe ice thing. Yeah. Have you done it? No melting ice bucket. We'll make it happen over time. Okay.\n\n01:10:55.320 --> 01:11:04.840\nSpencer? Yes. You have done it? No, no. The void. The VR experience. Yeah, I did it. I did it.\n\n01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:11.960\nYou don't like sincerity. What? Is that you guys don't like sincerity? He really did do the void.\n\n01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:18.680\nHuh? That's honesty. That's true. You're right. I'm sorry for. What? You were talking about\n\n01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:26.520\ntechnology, right? I guess. In a way. You were saying there's this new technology. I love what\n\n01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:30.440\never happens on the show. I think Nova's implying that the trans thing. Steve Levy, everybody. Steve\n\n01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:38.040\nLevy. Thank you. No, we don't need to talk about that though. It's fine. Right. And I think that's\n\n01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:41.800\nout there. Yeah, they didn't. I just want to say that because I really. Steve Levy walking through\n\n01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:44.280\nthe aisle. I just want to say that because I really do appreciate that about you. It makes\n\n01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:48.280\nme really, really happy. I'm really glad to hear you say that. I honestly, I need to,\n\n01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:53.640\nI need to hear that because I often, because I've often in the past like, because like,\n\n01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:57.560\nlike I just, the story of my life is that I just blunder through these minefields and I'm just\n\n01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:01.320\nlike, well, if I just pee myself, then everybody will get the message that I don't mean anybody\n\n01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:05.240\nany harm. Yeah, that's kind of how I do things too. And it gets a little tricky sometimes. Yeah,\n\n01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:12.120\nyeah, it does. I mean, I definitely, yeah, like, I don't mind that you like blunder through things\n\n01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:21.160\nor whatever. Like I'd rather people talk about things than just pretend. I'd rather. So much.\n\n01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:29.560\nNo, but you're the best, by the way. Thanks. I love you up here.\n\n01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:35.560\nYeah, I'd rather people talk about things than like ignore them because they're and try to pretend\n\n01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:39.480\nthey don't exist because they're afraid of messing something up. You know, like I'd rather you like\n\n01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:43.960\nkind of address it even if you like blunder quote unquote, but that's just me. Like a lot of people\n\n01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:47.400\nkind of in my circles kind of don't feel that way. They're like, if you say a wrong word,\n\n01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:51.480\nfuck you, you know, and I'm like, I understand that stuff too. Because I understand like,\n\n01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:56.440\nlike, I mean, I've look, it's been a like the last two years in particular has been a fucking\n\n01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:02.600\ncrazy roller coaster ride for even my archetype. So like, even before that shit, you why you made\n\n01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:06.920\na watch me going up and down and like learning about like, Oh, how do I address this and how\n\n01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:11.960\nto what language do I use here? And then election happens. And it's like, Oh, now I'm learning,\n\n01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:18.360\nlike what it's actually like to feel like you're like isolated and that you have no control.\n\n01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:25.880\nAnd it's like, welcome to the party from it's, it's, it's very interesting. Like I, I can't\n\n01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:31.640\nremember what my point was. I'm probably too drunk. But, but I do appreciate that because I'm\n\n01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:35.880\ntrying to listen to books now on tape that are like called like, getting over your addiction to\n\n01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:41.960\napproval. Like, like, like, I like now at this point in this, this, this, this, this twilight\n\n01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:51.000\nof my life, like, like my thing, like, like, like, my thing has to be about that's, that's like,\n\n01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:58.200\nmy ironic job is like, I have this like tank of shame that like, it's nobody else's fault that\n\n01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:03.080\nit's there. And it's like, it has nothing to do with like, whether or not I've paid more dues than\n\n01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:08.600\nanybody else. It's just a fucking fact that like, I have this crazy battery of filled with shame.\n\n01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:14.440\nAnd like anybody that says if somebody says pass the salt, there's a 20% higher chance\n\n01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:20.120\nthat I'll figure out a way to turn it into you didn't pass the salt earlier, you piece of shit,\n\n01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:24.840\nthat it's just, it's just like weird shit like that. Like, like, I got this like fucking bucket\n\n01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:31.160\nof shame driving me. Absolutely. And so that makes it in particular, like, it's like, Oh,\n\n01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:35.960\nwhat's with this approval addiction? Because if you're going to try to get people's approval,\n\n01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:39.000\nthen you're going to run into situations where people are going to say, actually,\n\n01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:43.560\nI'll take a pass on that you didn't get my approval. And if that's going to make you fly\n\n01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:47.480\ninto a rage, maybe you shouldn't be in the approval game, or maybe you should lose the shame,\n\n01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:52.920\netc. So I'm listening to all these fucking like books on tape that are like, hey, like, like,\n\n01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:58.680\ndon't care what people think. But at the same time, like, how does that help? Yeah, I mean,\n\n01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:03.080\nit's it's a it's a turbulent mess. And so because it's a turbulent mess, I think that's\n\n01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:07.720\nthe good news about it is that actually, we could we could actually all call out to each other\n\n01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:14.920\nover a whirlpool, like, actually a quality achieved. If it gets if it gets that chaotic,\n\n01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:20.520\nwe can all be like, I can't tell the difference between anybody right now. I'm pretty sure it's\n\n01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:29.880\njust us versus a whirlpool. Like, who doesn't want to drown? And everyone goes, yay. And anybody\n\n01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:35.960\nthat says, I do want to drown, it's like, all right, sounds like you're in pain. Like, like,\n\n01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:40.200\nbecause why should you want to drown? And anybody that's like, you should drown, I'm not drowning.\n\n01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:48.120\nIt's like, okay, you fucking diluted Nazi. But even then, for agreement says that guy's made of light.\n\n01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:56.440\nI don't know. I'm going to figure it out with one thing tonight is that Nazis are made of light.\n\n01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:05.240\nI refuse that to be the title of the show. Are you saying we shouldn't call it\n\n01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:10.200\nNazis are made of light? Yeah, I mean, I definitely get the like approval thing and like the built\n\n01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:14.280\nin shame thing of like, I'll totally apologetically be myself all the time. But if anybody calls me\n\n01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:20.840\non anything, I'll be like, you're right. I'm like, hey, it's totally cool. However,\n\n01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:24.360\npast the salt is fine. You know, it's all good. And then if anybody were to be like,\n\n01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:27.480\nwhy'd you pass the salt like that? Even if it wasn't super mean, I'd just be like,\n\n01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:30.360\nyou're right. I'm a piece of shit. I didn't pass it right. I need to figure out exactly how to pass\n\n01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:37.880\nit right. Otherwise, like, you know, I'm really cool with people asking me to pass the salt.\n\n01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:43.000\nThat's nice. If they want the salt, everything's a fucking competition with you.\n\n01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:50.840\nAnd it's on my side of the table. I could stop for two seconds, two microns,\n\n01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:58.360\nand pass the salt over to somebody. Maybe I've been using it. Maybe I've been bow guarding the salt.\n\n01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:01.560\nGod damn it. He finally wins. I've known this guy for 80 years.\n\n01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:07.320\nFeels like it. I met him in Amber. That's how old we are.\n\n01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:15.080\nIn where? Amber. It's like just resin. We were both on top of a Brontosaurus.\n\n01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:20.200\nAnd I was like, hello. And he was like, hi. And then we got bored out and shipped here.\n\n01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:25.160\nWe're a thousand years old. Yeah, I had a friend for like six years, which is a long time when\n\n01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:28.360\nyou're like a teenager or whatever. And it's like, yeah, by the end, we just like hate each other\n\n01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:31.160\nand stuff. You know, it's like, all right, he's still my best friend. I don't know.\n\n01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:33.160\nYeah, the closest people and all that shit.\n\n01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:40.520\nYeah. But you know, it's kind of like, like, you know, the thing I'm like,\n\n01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:44.600\nI'm listening to the self esteem book. And the thing that blew my mind that actually\n\n01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:47.960\nreally challenged me because I was like, fuck, they took that away from me, too,\n\n01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:53.720\nis self loathing. It's like, it's it's another fucking dodge. That's the thing.\n\n01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:58.360\nI just realized that the other day, like it blew, I was in my shower, I was in my shower,\n\n01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:02.760\nand I had to get out of the shower. Well, it's just another way of like giving\n\n01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:06.920\ninto yourself critic. And like, you're basically doing it. It's a dodge. It's like a,\n\n01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:11.400\nit's like a checkkiting scheme. It's an excuse. If you were to say to me, like, oh,\n\n01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:15.240\nyou said some transphobic shit in the last podcast. And if I were to go,\n\n01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:20.200\nyeah, I'm a piece of fucking shit. I'm so fucking transphobic. What the fuck is wrong with you?\n\n01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:23.800\nYou know, and if I then you're like, it's like, I'm an apology or anything like that. Yeah,\n\n01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:28.280\nI'm like, it's not a real wreck turning it on you. Right. And like, also, I'm just like avoiding\n\n01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:31.880\neverything. I do that to you turn into the victim. You're like, Oh, I feel bad, you know,\n\n01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:35.320\nso like, you know, I don't know. When I was a kid, if anyone ever accused me of like, Oh,\n\n01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:39.320\nyou were mean to this person, which like I never was, it was just like, if someone misinterpreted\n\n01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:43.560\nsomething I said or something, and like, I would just immediately just burst into tears,\n\n01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:47.560\nbecause, and it was like legitimate. I wasn't faking it of like, Oh, what was me,\n\n01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:52.120\nbut maybe like unconsciously I was, I don't know. Well, I did. Well, it fucking hurts to think\n\n01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:55.800\nit feels better to be the victim. Don't like you. It fucking hurts to the worst thing that could\n\n01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:59.960\never happen. Yeah, absolutely. Like you could hit me in the face with a two by four. I would take\n\n01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:04.920\nthat over. Like when I was on the playground, and people would punch me, like the thing that would\n\n01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:09.320\nmake me cry would be somebody coming up and sticking up for me and going like, Hey, leave\n\n01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:14.760\nhim alone. And then I'd start crying, because it'd be like, Oh, I'm like causing everybody like,\n\n01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:19.000\nOh, like you're like making people like have to pay attention to you or something.\n\n01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:25.320\nCool guy now has to take time out of his day. Oh, I'm fine with this piece of shit, like\n\n01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:29.240\nfucking hit me harder. Like it only makes me stronger. Like now this fucking cool dude's\n\n01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:35.800\ngot to come up like fucking pony boy. And yeah, like, it doesn't even have to be like people\n\n01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:41.240\nliking you. It's just like a first and a tears ability. No, don't just stick up for me. You\n\n01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:48.200\nwent to school with Ralph Machio. Wow. I mean, it was 83 every. Yes, we all did. Okay. You said\n\n01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:53.800\nyou looked like Ralph Machio. Spencer, what was your shower epiphany? Just what Dan was saying.\n\n01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:59.720\nLike a self hatred is like just an excuse to not really like it's a stopping point because\n\n01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:06.920\nyou're like, Oh, should I should I go exercising? No, I hate myself. I don't have to do that.\n\n01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:11.000\nBut it's like, well, no, you thought of the exercising because that's something probably\n\n01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:15.080\nimportant that you should do. And you shouldn't just stop thinking about it by short cutting\n\n01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:19.640\nit with I hate myself. And yeah, so I think that's what he was getting at is it's a dodge.\n\n01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:24.200\nAnything you're kind of focusing on yourself, you're basically shutting down those avenues\n\n01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:27.800\nthat we're going to be frustrating, which is connection where you might be accountable.\n\n01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:31.880\nYou might have to do the awkward, painful thing of like not being a hero or a villain and just\n\n01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:39.640\nsaying to somebody, Oh, did I like hard like just regular person that maybe is or isn't\n\n01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:44.280\nhigh maintenance, like a maybe should or shouldn't be my friend and isn't a hero or a villain, but\n\n01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:52.600\njust is saying I'd prefer it if you gave me Splendid instead of sweet and low, like the\n\n01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:57.000\ntendency to go like, fuck this bitch, like fuck this shit, like fuck people and I'm going to\n\n01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.720\ngive as much as I take and or is going like, Yeah, I'm a piece of shit. I can't do anything. Right.\n\n01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:05.800\nBoth of those are the same. There are alternatives to just going like, Okay, cool. So Splendid\n\n01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:12.280\nnext time. But also sometimes self loathing feels but also sometimes the self loathing as opposed\n\n01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:15.800\nto turning it out on other people can feel safer because you feel like you're not hurting anyone.\n\n01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:20.120\nNo, you feel like that's fine. That's like classic fucked up shit where you're like,\n\n01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:23.880\nI mean, you're like, like no offense to people who actually have their doing this. I'm saying\n\n01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:28.680\nlike, like, like, we know this manifestation where people are like, I'm gonna fucking cut myself\n\n01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:33.160\nuntil you call me back and all that shit. Like that's, that's an instinct that humans have,\n\n01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:38.040\nlike because we it'll it'll give you a dopamine spike doesn't work back to that comfort place.\n\n01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:44.760\nWhat, what did you, what did you just say? Villain, we found a villain. Now I'm comfortable.\n\n01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:51.480\nHe said, he said, we're boring. No, I didn't. He said, no, it's not. I said, it doesn't work.\n\n01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:55.560\nIt doesn't work. Oh, okay. Well, we agree with that. So it's fine. We'll look the other way while I\n\n01:21:55.560 --> 01:22:04.360\ndry my eyes. And I'm comfortable in this awesome chair that I got for you. You're welcome. You\n\n01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:09.720\nI haven't stopped smiling. Yeah, I mean, that maybe that's why I love Harmonytone so much,\n\n01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:13.480\nbecause I see so much myself in you and stuff. And also, like, you're in your 40s. So I'm like,\n\n01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:19.480\nokay, cool, like, you know, if that's the worst that could happen. Yeah, you're like, I'm not\n\n01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:24.280\nkidding. I mean, I would like to think that honestly, because I was like, you know, like,\n\n01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:31.320\nhonestly, if the worst it gets is like, like, I can still be like fumbling around in 45. And\n\n01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:36.520\nlike, it's cool. That's that is like, that's what I want to hear. Yeah, I don't I don't know,\n\n01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:40.200\nI don't pay a lot of attention to stuff made by people like my age, because I'm like, well,\n\n01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:48.600\nwhat do you have to offer me? Oh, more and more every year. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. That's glib.\n\n01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:53.800\nI guess any fantasy requests as far as like segments, like, like, like, if you if you could\n\n01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:59.880\njust fantasize about like, you're listening to it, you're, you're, I can't remember what you said you\n\n01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:07.320\nwere. What your ideal is that? Oh, yeah, you're playing Sims and you listen to podcasts. So any\n\n01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:13.080\nlike, you're like, God, I wish they would do like a top 10 list or just any kind of my favorite parts\n\n01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:18.600\nof all time of the show are when this is not a fantasy thing. This happens constantly. My favorite\n\n01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:30.040\npart of any episode is when you D&D. Wait, sorry, sorry, I cut you off. Yeah, what are you gonna\n\n01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:36.040\nsay now? Is the is the beginning when you come out and you have funny stories from your life of\n\n01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:39.640\nlike something weird happened with a dog door, or even just someone ran into my garage, because I'm\n\n01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:43.080\nvery lonely and pathetic. And it feels like I have a friend, you know, who's like telling me about\n\n01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:48.840\nsomething that I actually am not bored by. And, you know, or it's funny or like this, the, you\n\n01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:53.320\nknow, people beat the little light at the, you know, whatever. Yeah, yeah, and it probably feels\n\n01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:59.160\ngood. I would imagine I hope that to know that like, oh, if I fantasize about slowly getting\n\n01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:03.640\nricher and richer, that I realize that that actually just constricts your life experience\n\n01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:09.320\ndown to this like dilated, like, like, Harmon just keeps talking about how his toilet works.\n\n01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:16.280\nIt kind of like, I guess I'm more, I have more flower petals when I'm 25. I don't know if that\n\n01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:20.360\nsegment of the show has a bigger meaning for me. That's like the funniest part of the show. I\n\n01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:24.520\nalways think about I just go like, well, what is that? What is comedy? It's like, you're supposed\n\n01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:29.240\nto be drawing from living your life. And then I just think about like, I think the only person\n\n01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:34.440\nthat's nailed it so far is Larry David, because he migrated to HBO and then was like, literally,\n\n01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:40.600\nlike, this is a show about me arguing with my gardener. And I'd like, but you think like,\n\n01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:47.400\nthat is genuinely the progression. Like, if you're, if you are successful at getting people to\n\n01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:54.600\nlaugh, like you, you are rewarded in our glorious society to a level where you're like, I no longer,\n\n01:24:55.880 --> 01:25:01.320\nyou don't have, I, the top of this podcast is I would come out and I would go, like, I'm so sick\n\n01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:07.000\nof people telling me to tie my shoes. You said that a lot. Like, I that that would be a such a\n\n01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.720\ndishonest thing right now. I would come out, I would have to come out now and say, I'm so sick\n\n01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:15.960\nof the guilt that comes with knowing that everyone's afraid to tell me anything about my shoes or\n\n01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:21.080\nelse they'll get fired. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, you self advocate enough and then you're like, it's not\n\n01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:25.800\nrelatable. And it's also a little uncomfortable. And it doesn't, it's like, there's a little bit of\n\n01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:31.800\na loop there. But it's honest. Well, it's also when I wanted to be. It's a way like, you know,\n\n01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:36.680\nbut also like, like, who want, yeah, like, yeah, I do get that about comedy for sure. Like, I talk\n\n01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:40.280\nabout like acting like I don't need to be famous. And that's what I know I like. But I fantasized\n\n01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:45.000\na lot about maybe enjoying being a standup comic, or making like a sitcom or something where like,\n\n01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.480\nI create the characters, and then I can express darker things, you know, like I can kind of\n\n01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:54.760\nexpress less savory things, because it's funny. You know, like, I don't have to, I don't, yeah.\n\n01:25:54.760 --> 01:26:00.760\nLet me give you a choice between, but without like, if you, because I think like, as far as like,\n\n01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:06.280\nguests that we would book, like, in terms of categories, like your favorite, like,\n\n01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:11.160\nscreenwriters, like, like people that do what I do, me talking to them,\n\n01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:22.280\nanti-fascist activists, who feel the way I feel about, about not going gently into\n\n01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:27.960\nthis fucking horrible night, at the risk of depressing all of us, and also offending like,\n\n01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:34.520\nthe 30% of us who are more than welcome here. And then, what's-\n\n01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:35.480\n30%?\n\n01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:39.320\nOh my god.\n\n01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:46.600\nLook, my math is notoriously wrong, but I still get a weird feeling it's going to turn out to be\n\n01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:52.600\nright. But, but, and then, I don't know, there's a third category you could, you could make it up,\n\n01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:55.240\nbut like, like, like, I can't, like, like, like, should I, I should just have-\n\n01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:56.680\nTrash delivery!\n\n01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:04.040\nOr, or like, Paul, you're too young, you remember, Paul Appoundstone had a show on a\n\n01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:08.440\nshowtire or HBO or something, and she would just have like, literally like, a firefighter,\n\n01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:11.960\nor like, meter maid, or something like, like, like, like, like, she would just, like, it was\n\n01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:14.280\nsort of like, these are the people in your neighborhood, kind of like-\n\n01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:17.400\nLike, we went, like, when we had the guy who, like, worked at Target and, like, knew about\n\n01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:21.320\nall the targets and stuff, like, he knew all the insider stuff.

beginning,\n\n01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:40.200\nwhen you're telling the stories, did you clock that as like, oh yeah,\n\n01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:43.640\nwhen I have all this great stuff prepared, that's when you enjoy it?\n\n01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:47.560\nNo, because I never really, I never flattered myself\n\n01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:51.160\nwas thinking that that's when the stuff's good.\n\n01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:51.960\nOh, it's great.\n\n01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:54.120\nWe heard it from the source.\n\n01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:58.760\nWell, that seems like a, yeah, I mean, like, oh, my favorite part of the broccoli\n\n01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:00.840\nis the pad of butter on top of it.\n\n01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:01.560\nYeah.\n\n01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:02.600\nWell, tough

01:34:11.080\nI just wanted to ask, I'd forget behind stage, backstage.\n\n01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:14.360\nIs that like a subtle note from you that you're like, I wish you prepared more?\n\n01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:17.560\nNo, I just, that was what I, that was what my interpretation and I was like,\n\n01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:18.920\nwell, Dan hates himself too.\n\n01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:20.760\nI wonder if that was his interpretation.\n\n01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:24.120\nYeah, but you don't want to, you don't want to put more anxiety on me about\n\n01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:25.160\npreparing for the show.\n\n01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:27.160\nNo, you don't have to do any of that.\n\n01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:30.520\nI wanted to, if you felt that way, tell you not to.\n\n01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:33.400\nBut look what I've done instead.\n\n01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:37.400\nI feel like you're flipping the script on me where you're like,\n\n01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:40.280\nyeah, your D&D is your whole fucking shitty show.\n\n01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:41.560\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:44.600\nHow would you like it if everyone was relying on you to prepare stuff\n\n01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:45.640\nand you were unprepared?\n\n01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:47.560\nNo, no, this is, that was not my intent.\n\n01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:51.480\nI see how obvious it is to see now that that's how it reads.\n\n01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:54.680\nThis is all, this is like last week all over again.\n\n01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:58.200\nWe have to, we have to learn to have empathy\n\n01:34:58.200 --> 01:34:59.960\nor we're never going to communicate with each other.\n\n01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:00.520\nYeah, man.\n\n01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:01.800\nIt's rough out there.\n\n01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:02.520\nLook what I just did.\n\n01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:04.440\nI just did the thing that we were talking about where I'm like,\n\n01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:06.280\noh, you hate me because I do this and like,\n\n01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:07.640\nI'm doing that because I'm not communicating.\n\n01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:08.520\nI do that too.\n\n01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:09.160\nIt's great.\n\n01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:10.840\nI'm working through it together.\n\n01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:13.000\nYou're a good friend and you've been my friend forever.\n\n01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:13.080\nYeah, man.\n\n01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:14.920\nAnd like, you're great.\n\n01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:15.880\nWe're going to do it.\n\n01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:16.840\nYeah, all right.\n\n01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:17.560\nTonight.\n\n01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:19.000\nThat's more awkward to say than I hate myself.\n\n01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:19.560\nNo, it's cool.\n\n01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:20.600\nI appreciate you saying that.\n\n01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:20.760\nAnd?\n\n01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:21.800\nI feel the same way.\n\n01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:22.280\nAnd?\n\n01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:23.320\nRob's good too.\n\n01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:23.720\nAnd?\n\n01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:24.440\nRob's not right.\n\n01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:26.120\nHe has his moments, but Jesus Christ,\n\n01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:27.640\ntonight has featured none of them.\n\n01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:31.320\nSo that was, no, you had some moments.\n\n01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:33.560\nThat was thing one.\n\n01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:39.320\nThing two is in my news update, my dad has a VCR now.\n\n01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:40.520\nWhoa.\n\n01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:45.640\nHe got a VCR from a Harmontown fan named Alejandro,\n\n01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:47.400\nwho lives in the area.\n\n01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:49.800\nAnd he hooked my dad up with a VCR,\n\n01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:53.160\nand he's going to watch the VHS tapes he has\n\n01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:56.280\nand see if it's among them, the Goonies thing.\n\n01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:57.720\nThe Goonies commercial.\n\n01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:01.160\nYeah, we're not sure he has it, but we will find out soon.\n\n01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:03.960\nWill you explain to the people who haven't heard the other\n\n01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:05.640\nepisode what we're talking about?\n\n01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:08.920\nSo when I was a kid, I was maybe in a Goonies commercial\n\n01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:13.080\nthat my dad shot, and he put it on local cable TV\n\n01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:14.840\nor local TV or something.\n\n01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:17.240\nAnd it might exist, and everyone but me\n\n01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:18.040\nthought that was cool.\n\n01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:18.760\nSo?\n\n01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:24.120\nI'm going to melt if I ever see that.\n\n01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:26.600\nIt's sure to be a letdown.\n\n01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:27.560\nThere's no way it's not.\n\n01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:30.680\nNo, I'm glad if you like it.\n\n01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:31.320\nThat'll be good.\n\n01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:35.080\nI think just seeing you as a kid is good enough.\n\n01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:35.800\nSure.\n\n01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:38.680\nI got a beard and everything.\n\n01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:40.600\nAll right, Spencer, it's been 1,000 years.\n\n01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:41.560\nOne more thing.\n\n01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:43.640\nOh, yeah, you got your chest of magic over here.\n\n01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:46.040\nI actually, I don't want to alarm anybody,\n\n01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:48.440\nbut I actually started another podcast.\n\n01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:50.280\nIt's about being a dungeon master,\n\n01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:51.240\nand I'm giving advice to dungeon masters.\n\n01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:54.760\nI saw that shit in the most awkward way possible,\n\n01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:57.160\nwhich is Instagram just browsing.\n\n01:36:57.160 --> 01:36:58.120\nRight.\n\n01:36:58.120 --> 01:36:59.320\nI knew it.\n\n01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:00.760\nIt's just D&D.\n\n01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:02.120\nIt's just DMing.\n\n01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:03.480\nIt's not comedy.\n\n01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:04.920\nIt's not funny.\n\n01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:06.440\nIt's not entertaining.\n\n01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:08.200\nIt's like going to class.\n\n01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:09.720\nIt's studying.\n\n01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:10.680\nIt's not good.\n\n01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:12.440\nIt's where we talk shit about us.\n\n01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:13.640\nYeah.\n\n01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:17.400\nSo you can hear me talking shit about six or seven episodes\n\n01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:19.320\nin when I'm sure Dan hasn't listened to anything.\n\n01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:19.960\nRight.\n\n01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:22.200\nAll right, Spencer, I'm going to my second level\n\n01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:25.000\ndruid spells, and I'm going to lay some heavy shit on you.\n\n01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.080\nOK.\n\n01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:30.520\nI guarantee you, I'm going to chill metal on this one.\n\n01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:31.640\nIt's called Master Manual.\n\n01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:32.840\nYou can check it out.\n\n01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:34.120\nYeah, well, I was just going to say completely that.\n\n01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:35.320\nI'm also on another.\n\n01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:38.440\nMaster Manual, not on Starburn's audio.\n\n01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:40.600\nWell, you know, they can court us.\n\n01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:45.720\nI'm not opposed to it.\n\n01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:46.600\nMake an offer.\n\n01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:51.560\nI'm on a.\n\n01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:52.920\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:56.760\nI know exactly what you're saying.\n\n01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:00.040\nAnd I don't predict you'll be coming over.\n\n01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:01.480\nThat's a self deprecating statement.\n\n01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:01.960\nSure.\n\n01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:03.400\nYeah, I mean, I'm open to it.\n\n01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:05.240\nI think you should hold yourself to a higher standard.\n\n01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:08.440\nWell, I hold myself to a higher standard.\n\n01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:09.480\nI'm on a podcast.\n\n01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:10.360\nAnother D&D podcast.\n\n01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:11.640\nOh, yeah, Fear Initiative.\n\n01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:13.000\nFear Initiative on the Blum House.\n\n01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.720\nWhat the fuck, you know?\n\n01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:16.280\nHey, you snooze.\n\n01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:16.680\nYou lose.\n\n01:38:16.680 -->

nice.\n\n01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:32.360\nI walk in and go, Rob, how you doing?\n\n01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:34.040\nWhat did you do this weekend?\n\n01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:35.000\nThat's nice.\n\n01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:35.640\nHow did it?\n\n01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:36.920\nWhat are your dreams?\n\n01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:37.480\nWhat are you?\n\n01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:38.120\nWhat did you?\n\n01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:39.720\nWhat are your interests?\n\n01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:41.240\nThat's really cool.\n\n01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:41.800\nWow.\n\n01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:42.280\nAll right, Spencer.\n\n01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:42.920\nI'm listening.\n\n01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:44.120\nGive him three weeks.\n\n01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:45.640\nCatch us all up because it's been a thousand years.\n\n01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:47.800\nWait, Spencer, isn't there a thing that you wanted to play?\n\n01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:49.160\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:50.440\nI thought there's a video clip.\n\n01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:51.560\nOh, yeah, that'll be later.\n\n01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:52.360\nOh, OK, cool.\n\n01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:53.960\nI got a video clip.\n\n01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:54.680\nI knew.\n\n01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:56.120\nI didn't know what you were talking about.\n\n01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:58.360\nYeah, speaking of preparedness, this guy.\n\n01:38:58.360 --> 01:38:59.800\nIt's the Goonies.\n\n01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:00.280\nNo.\n\n01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:01.560\nYeah, no, it's not.\n\n01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:04.600\nWas your laptop in the freezer?\n\n01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:05.960\nWhat's that?\n\n01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:07.560\nI'm sorry, Jeff.\n\n01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:08.680\nOK, never mind.\n\n01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:09.240\nThis angle.\n\n01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:11.080\nMy iPad finger's getting sore over here.\n\n01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:11.880\nOh, no.\n\n01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:12.600\nYeah, go ahead, Rob.\n\n01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:16.120\nLet's all pray for Jeff.\n\n01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:17.480\nDick's out for Jeff.\n\n01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:19.960\nJeff's out for Jeff.\n\n01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:21.480\nLet's find this path.\n\n01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:22.920\nMan, remember Harambe?\n\n01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:23.720\nGood times.\n\n01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:24.360\nOh, man.\n\n01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:25.000\nSimpler times.\n\n01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:29.160\nWhy are we trolling involved caring about a gorilla?\n\n01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:31.240\nInstead of a president?\n\n01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:32.840\nYeah, good times.\n\n01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:33.720\nSorry, Jeff.\n\n01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:37.560\nI know how much you've been needing this.\n\n01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:40.040\nSorry, I'm sorry.\n\n01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:41.560\nLast time on Harmon.\n\n01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:42.280\nOne more thing.\n\n01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:42.760\nYeah.\n\n01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:49.480\nYou see, there's happy time murders, movie.\n\n01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:52.200\nI'm aware of it.\n\n01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:55.880\nApparently, it didn't do well this last weekend.\n\n01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:57.160\nIt did not, yeah.\n\n01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:02.120\nApparently, people weren't ready for the happy time murders.\n\n01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:02.840\nOK, go.\n\n01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:05.000\nOK.\n\n01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.680\nThere's edges, and then there's cutting edges.\n\n01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:11.320\nAnd society is not ready for the cutting edges.\n\n01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:12.920\nThey cut too many edges.\n\n01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:14.840\nAll right, what are you telling me?\n\n01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:17.320\nA muppet is doing something.\n\n01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:18.200\nWhat the heck?\n\n01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:19.080\nWait a minute.\n\n01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:20.280\nHold on a second.\n\n01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:22.360\nI got a rule for muppets in my life,\n\n01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:25.160\nand it ain't got nothing to do with this other business.\n\n01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:29.720\nPuppets are supposed to teach me how to spell, not murder.\n\n01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:31.480\nNext thing you're telling me, Bugs Bunny's\n\n01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:32.520\ngot a cup in his hand.\n\n01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:33.400\nWhat are you telling me?\n\n01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:35.560\nGet the fuck out of here with this shit.\n\n01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:37.240\nGet the fuck out of there with him.\n\n01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:41.480\nYou can pry my 70-year-old IP from my cold, dead fingers.\n\n01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:43.240\nI'm not doing this.\n\n01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:45.960\nI'm not watching no murders.\n\n01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:47.320\nHappy, sad, angry murders.\n\n01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:51.160\nFalling people that go like this are limited to my childhood.\n\n01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:55.320\nCrank yankers every commercial since 1970.\n\n01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:57.320\nAnd a fourth season of Community.\n\n01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:57.800\nLet's go.\n\n01:40:57.800 --> 01:40:58.800\nGoddamn it!\n\n01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:02.600\nLast time.\n\n01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:04.480\nYou're in good company, happy time.\n\n01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:06.680\nGo for it, please.\n\n01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:08.040\nIt was under my protest.\n\n01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:09.920\nIt was written on a whiteboard.\n\n01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:10.400\nKeep going.\n\n01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:11.960\nDo not do it.\n\n01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:13.560\nYou're killing your own show.\n\n01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:14.360\nCome on, let's go.\n\n01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:20.600\nIt said that the billboards say no sesame, all street.\n\n01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:21.920\nIt doesn't make any sense.\n\n01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:23.200\nIt doesn't realize that.\n\n01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:23.720\nThey got it.\n\n01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:25.880\nThat's the actual billboard that I drove by.\n\n01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:27.240\nSomebody needed something.\n\n01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:29.600\nI would say give me a little more sesame\n\n01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:31.960\non a little less street.\n\n01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:36.000\nYou've got to find that Sesame Street sweet spot.\n\n01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.600\nSesame Street was already heavily street.\n\n01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:40.440\nYeah.\n\n01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:42.040\nThat was actually the fucking point of the show.\n\n01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:43.280\nThat was the point, yeah.\n\n01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:45.480\nThat was truly the point of the show.\n\n01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:47.840\nIt was like saying, I was like, look at these kids.\n\n01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:49.480\nI mean, Mr. Hooper died.\n\n01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:51.120\nLet's go.\n\n01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:53.000\nLast time on Harmontown.\n\n01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:53.720\nOne more thing.\n\n01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:55.080\nYeah.\n\n01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:56.400\nIt's obviously a joke.\n\n01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:57.000\nIt's a good joke.\n\n01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.360\nLower the flag.\n\n01:41:58.360 --> 01:41:59.080\nIt's a funny joke.\n\n01:41:59.080 --> 01:41:59.640\nIt's a funny joke.\n\n01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:01.240\nIt's been working a lot.\n\n01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:04.680\nWill you please lower the flag?\n\n01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:06.080\nHe deserves to be honored.\n\n01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:07.960\nYou haven't said anything about Senator McCain.\n\n01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:08.920\nYou've said nothing.\n\n01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:10.480\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:11.800\nWell, I think that, um.\n\n01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:15.240\nCan we honor the senator from, since 1986,\n\n01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:17.880\nhe was the governor of Arizona, Jesus Christ.\n\n01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:20.440\nI'm just mad at people telling other people what to do.\n\n01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:22.240\nIt's just like, everybody shut the fuck up.\n\n01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:23.960\nWell, just tell us he's a hero.\n\n01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:24.560\nOr don't.\n\n01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:25.640\nJust shut the fuck up.\n\n01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:27.280\nJust everybody shut the fuck up.\n\n01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:28.120\nJust shut up.\n\n01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:29.960\nJust shut the fuck up.\n\n01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:31.160\nJust shut up.\n\n01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:32.000\nBut you haven't done it.\n\n01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.520\nYou haven't told us he's a hero yet.\n\n01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:34.360\nI don't care.\n\n01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:36.360\nI'm just going to shut the fuck up.\n\n01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:37.320\nBecause it doesn't matter.\n\n01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:38.040\nThat's what I want.\n\n01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:39.440\nI don't want to hear about John McCain.\n\n01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:41.200\nI don't not want to hear about John McCain.\n\n01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:43.320\nI want everybody to shut the fuck up.\n\n01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:44.760\nQuit trying to pull shit.\n\n01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:46.120\nIt doesn't fucking matter.\n\n01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:48.120\nYeah.\n\n01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:49.760\nNow I'm going to bring him back.\n\n01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:52.280\nAnd that's also, that sounds like it's about D&D.\n\n01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:55.880\nIt truly is about John McCain's death.\n\n01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:57.280\nJust shut the fuck up.\n\n01:42:57.280 --> 01:42:58.160\nI don't care.\n\n01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:00.160\nYeah.\n\n01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:01.120\nIt's my favorite.\n\n01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:03.360\nIt's become my favorite episode of the show ever.\n\n01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:04.480\nThis is a good episode.\n\n01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:05.440\nYeah.\n\n01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:06.240\nI never thought.\n\n01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:07.800\nI didn't like where I came out here.\n\n01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:09.080\nWe had Nova.\n\n01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:11.600\nNow we've gone Supernova.\n\n01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:12.800\nSupernova.\n\n01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:16.200\nNova was the gateway to a satisfying episode.\n\n01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:16.760\nHell, man.\n\n01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:18.040\nWe broke free.\n\n01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:18.320\nOK.\n\n01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:19.520\nWe have 30 seconds for D&D.\n\n01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:20.020\nOK.\n\n01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:20.280\nHere we go.\n\n01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:21.200\nIt's good.\n\n01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:22.160\nIt's going to be great.\n\n01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:24.680\nLast time on Harmontown, our heroes,\n\n01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:26.480\nthey were at a new town.\n\n01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:26.960\nWhat was it?\n\n01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:28.360\nThe town of Doronester.\n\n01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:30.760\nThey were searching for Patchen's gem.\n\n01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:32.320\nThey found Patchen's gem.\n\n01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:36.080\nBut they lost Patchen's and set the town on fire.\n\n01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:37.480\nThey left the town.\n\n01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:39.320\nAnd they were looking for Patchen's\n\n01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:41.840\nwhen they got a crow from their friend brother\n\n01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:43.760\nAbsalon from the church.\n\n01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:46.000\nHe was like, you're being reassigned.\n\n01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.600\nWe need your help over this way at this other place\n\n01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:53.720\nwhere they're having a log jam at the stone mines.\n\n01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:55.760\nAnd so you were heading over there\n\n01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:57.040\nin the hope that Patchen's would\n\n01:43:57.040 --> 01:43:58.960\nbe in that general direction.\n\n01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:02.680\nThen you ran into a cult, a cult of exercise people.\n\n01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:06.040\nYou exercised with them and then left.\n\n01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:08.000\nThen you came across another cult.\n\n01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.680\nThis new cult was more culty and less fun than the last cult.\n\n01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:15.360\nThey were summoning something, a demon.\n\n01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:19.800\nFor some strange reason, and I thought of this over and over,\n\n01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:22.440\nfor some very strange and out of character reason,\n\n01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:24.000\ntwo of the characters who I can't even\n\n01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.080\nremember their identities, they helped the cult summon\n\n01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:33.280\na demon, which is the antithesis of their jobs.\n\n01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:35.920\nWe left them in the middle of the ritual,\n\n01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:39.080\na gateway opening in the floor, giant pentagrams\n\n01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:40.560\nscrawled into the earth.\n\n01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:44.520\nAnd through that game way, a giant, giant fucking demon\n\n01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:48.840\narm was shooting forth into the material plane.\n\n01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:50.120\nAll right.\n\n01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:51.120\nYeah.\n\n01:44:51.120 --> 01:45:06.080\nSo gate has opened up and a huge, this seems like it's maybe\n\n01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:10.360\na 30-foot tall demon's arm is bursting out of the ground.\n\n01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:12.440\nWell, not out of the ground, out of the hole in the ground\n\n01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:14.880\nthat was formed by magic, a portal.\n\n01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:17.120\nAnd his hand is raising way up.\n\n01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:18.360\nYeah, he's like crawling.\n\n01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:21.960\nHe's reaching around trying to pull himself out of this portal\n\n01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:23.120\nright now.\n\n01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:25.440\nCould this be our savior?\n\n01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:28.120\nYou guys are religious.\n\n01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:30.840\nYour job is to smite evil.\n\n01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:33.960\nIt's a big part of this whole thing.\n\n01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:35.520\nI mean, you can turn against that,\n\n01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:38.160\nbut just let me know so I can know what to do.\n\n01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:39.000\nWe're doing our jobs.\n\n01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.080\nWe want this thing to come through so we could smite it.\n\n01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:42.600\nYeah, let's fucking go.\n\n01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:43.800\nLet's smite this demon.\n\n01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:44.800\nLet's start smiting.\n\n01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:46.920\nHe just asked if it was evil.\n\n01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:48.200\nNow you want to smite it.\n\n01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:52.040\nYeah, I'm just keeping my eye on you.\n\n01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:53.240\nWe're trying to have a good time.\n\n01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:53.920\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:55.480\nOh, yeah, I got a high road here.\n\n01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:58.440\nI shoot a fire bolt at the demon arm.\n\n01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:00.280\nAll right, I got to get my dice.\n\n01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:04.080\nOh, you didn't have your fucking dice out.\n\n01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:07.920\nYou're all that fucking bluster.\n\n01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:09.120\nGot to get his dice out.\n\n01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:13.480\nWell, while you're doing the dice, go ahead.\n\n01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:14.400\nYou're doing it already.\n\n01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:17.160\nAll right, it's a mutant of fire being a demon,\n\n01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:18.200\nbut you do hit it.\n\n01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:19.800\nOK, well, that's something.\n\n01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:21.280\nYeah, it's knowledge.\n\n01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:25.360\nWell, one box check.\n\n01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:27.680\nDo I get live and learn XP on that one?\n\n01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:30.120\nOh, yeah, you get three experience.\n\n01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:33.240\nIt's good.\n\n01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:35.240\nGod damn it.\n\n01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:36.440\nYou guys take it.\n\n01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:41.160\nDan, you're seeing Steven Schrobb, right?\n\n01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:42.080\nThey were in the ritual.\n\n01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:42.720\nYou guys?\n\n01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:43.360\nYeah.\n\n01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:44.520\nYou see Steven Schrobb.\n\n01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:47.360\nThey're holding magical ritual ingredients,\n\n01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:49.040\nand they're summoning a demon.\n\n01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:50.240\nAnd you're like, what?\n\n01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:52.920\nI look away for two seconds, that kind of thing, you know?\n\n01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:54.360\nThat's where you're at right now.\n\n01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:55.320\nYeah.\n\n01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:57.200\nWhat's the environment that we're in right now?\n\n01:46:57.200 --> 01:46:58.240\nIt's rolling hills.\n\n01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:00.600\nThis part's a flat expanse.\n\n01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:02.080\nAlso, there's no trees or anything.\n\n01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:04.720\nNot near by, just grass.\n\n01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:07.440\nIf Schrobb and I stop our little ritual,\n\n01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:08.600\ndoes the gateway close?\n\n01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:10.760\nYou don't know.\n\n01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:14.160\nThere's been this ongoing thing where I'm out of everything.\n\n01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:15.600\nThat was a mistake.\n\n01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:16.320\nI told you that.\n\n01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:17.000\nI was wrong.\n\n01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.400\nYou have your spells back because it's been multiple days.\n\n01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:19.960\nOh, shit.\n\n01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:20.600\nYeah, sorry.\n\n01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:21.080\nMy bad.\n\n01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:21.720\nAll right.\n\n01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:23.640\nOh, I'm back, baby.\n\n01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:25.040\nWait, before you expend anything,\n\n01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:27.480\nSchrobb, shouldn't we just try to close this portal?\n\n01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:29.640\nYeah, let's say everything backwards.\n\n01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:30.640\nYeah.\n\n01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:32.640\nUh, OK.\n\n01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:46.640\nAnd we're bowing up while we're doing this.\n\n01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:48.200\nAnd we're really committing to it.\n\n01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:48.960\nRight.\n\n01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:49.480\nDid you?\n\n01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:50.480\nYou're taking note of that?\n\n01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:52.200\nWe're really committing to it.\n\n01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:53.040\nAnd like?\n\n01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:54.160\nThe biggest arms.\n\n01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:55.760\nThe biggest arms.\n\n01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:01.040\nAnd we're really nailing the backwards talking, right?\n\n01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:02.640\nI think the cultists are impressed.\n\n01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:03.240\nYeah.\n\n01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:04.080\nWell, oh, yeah.\n\n01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:05.400\nWell, that's important.\n\n01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:06.280\nRight.\n\n01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:09.440\nFucking idiot.\n\n01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:10.520\nOh, name calling.\n\n01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:11.120\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:15.680\nNo, let's get through this life and make sure we meet one goal.\n\n01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:18.840\nImpress the cultists.\n\n01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:21.960\nYeah, that's a chaotic world.\n\n01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:23.480\nOh, the mountain can talk.\n\n01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:25.680\nThere's a double deer.\n\n01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:28.320\nThat chest has a fucking ghost in it.\n\n01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:30.720\nBut let's keep things focused.\n\n01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:32.640\nImpress the cultists.\n\n01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:35.720\nYou fucking idiots.\n\n01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:37.880\nYou have one religion, but not you.\n\n01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:38.360\nYou know what?\n\n01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:40.080\nYou're a shambling mound.\n\n01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:42.320\nI expect more from you.\n\n01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:44.840\nThank you for acknowledging my race.\n\n01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:47.880\nThat's fine.\n\n01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:49.800\nIt's just fucking disappointing.\n\n01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:52.400\nAnd I'm not saying this stuff because it would take a turn.\n\n01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:53.920\nOK.\n\n01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:55.800\nI indicate that with a look.\n\n01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:56.760\nRight, yeah, of course.\n\n01:48:56.760 --> 01:49:00.960\nAnd also, I also want to add that it's mostly directed\n\n01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:04.040\ntoward me, because I don't, I don't, I'm so floating.\n\n01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:07.480\nLike, I don't fucking like, I'm not a commander.\n\n01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:11.120\nI don't know how to handle this shit.\n\n01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:12.840\nThis is shit that you're doing to me,\n\n01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:15.760\nbecause I don't know how to fucking clean it up, OK?\n\n01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:17.240\nBecause I'm not a fucking leader.\n\n01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:20.880\nSo when you do this shit, you do it to me.\n\n01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:24.000\nBecause I'm not your fucking dad.\n\n01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.440\nI'm just a dude trying to not die.\n\n01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:27.680\nSo you fuck me.\n\n01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:28.240\nYou know what?\n\n01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:29.040\nWhen you do this shit.\n\n01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:29.520\nYou know what?\n\n01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:30.080\nYou know what?\n\n01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:30.800\nYou know what?\n\n01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:31.360\nFuck it.\n\n01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:32.160\nI'm done.\n\n01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:34.800\nI stop bowing backwards and saying stop.\n\n01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:35.640\nI, I,\n\n01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:36.240\nShut up.\n\n01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:36.880\nThrow down my shit.\n\n01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:37.600\nKnock it off.\n\n01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:38.640\nAnd I start walking home.\n\n01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:39.520\nNo, you don't.\n\n01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:41.040\nNo, no, shut up.\n\n01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:41.520\nFine.\n\n01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:42.520\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:43.360\nYou don't like how I do it?\n\n01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:44.360\nI'm going back and forth.\n\n01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:45.360\nKnock it off.\n\n01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:47.840\nTrying to kill somebody in my living room.\n\n01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:48.520\nYou wish.\n\n01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:49.960\nHide up, build up.\n\n01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:51.480\nI'm trying to deliver tea.\n\n01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:52.920\nI never asked for this.\n\n01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:54.600\nMy dog's got to be let out.\n\n01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:55.400\nI'm going.\n\n01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:55.720\nAll right.\n\n01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:57.120\nFirst of all, you guy.\n\n01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:57.880\nI'll deal with you.\n\n01:49:57.880 --> 01:49:59.240\nI don't need to be talked to like this.\n\n01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:00.840\nSteve, keep him away from me.\n\n01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:02.920\nDJ.\n\n01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:07.400\nI want to, I want to, I want to, I want to channel.\n\n01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:08.320\nApology.\n\n01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.560\nI want to get managed that.\n\n01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:15.080\nYou're rested.\n\n01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:17.000\nI want to channel.\n\n01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:18.960\nSmite.\n\n01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:21.480\nMm-hmm.\n\n01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:24.040\nWhich?\n\n01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:25.560\nThe right one.\n\n01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:26.960\nThe right one.\n\n01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:28.920\nThat's an attack that you use on a target.\n\n01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:32.040\nI want to smite the, the arm.\n\n01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:33.240\nOh yeah, they think it's, yeah.\n\n01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:34.560\nAll right.\n\n01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:36.160\nThere's a 30 foot demon arm coming out of here.\n\n01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:37.760\nYeah, and I'm smiting it.\n\n01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:39.360\nAnd it's super easy to hit.\n\n01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:43.840\nAh, arm.\n\n01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:46.080\nAnti-arm.\n\n01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:49.040\nAll right, you smite it for 11 good damage.\n\n01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:50.440\nIt slices open.\n\n01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:52.680\nAnyways.\n\n01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:54.160\nSchrab is walking away, right?\n\n01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:55.000\nI'm walking away.\n\n01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:56.560\nI'm, I'm just a silhouette.\n\n01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:57.600\nAll right, there he goes.\n\n01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:58.800\nThere he goes, everybody.\n\n01:50:58.800 --> 01:50:59.520\nThe hero.\n\n01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:01.440\nYou know.\n\n01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:05.840\nI'm calling you a hero.\n\n01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:08.840\nYeah, I'm saying you're a hero.\n\n01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:12.280\nYeah, I'm saying you're a hero.\n\n01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:15.280\nI'm being sarcastic.\n\n01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:19.000\nAs Schrab walks away, instantly the portal that was being\n\n01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.720\nopen starts destabilizing.\n\n01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:22.880\nYou see its edges start to waver,\n\n01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:25.680\nand they get bigger and smaller and stuff.\n\n01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:28.440\nAnd now, now like a shoulder and a head of the demons\n\n01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:30.600\nlike, like coming through.\n\n01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:33.800\nBut now it like kind of cinches tight around him.\n\n01:51:33.800 --> 01:51:35.880\nSo he's like kind of more stuck than he was,\n\n01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:37.640\nbut now he's more out than he was.\n\n01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:40.360\nAnd he starts lashing out about.\n\n01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:42.160\nLet's see what happens.\n\n01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:45.080\nNothing.\n\n01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:48.880\nWell, let me, let me, let me try again.\n\n01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:50.920\nI don't know what you're talking about because you're gone.\n\n01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:52.880\nBy the way, everything that happens is your fault\n\n01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:54.360\nbecause you left.\n\n01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:56.240\nYeah, everything that happens.\n\n01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:58.640\nCan't hear you.\n\n01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:01.800\nI can only hear the people that work hard to make this happen.\n\n01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:04.880\nThe cultist gesture at Steve as if to try and make you\n\n01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:07.960\nreposition yourself in the circle.\n\n01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:09.920\nWell, look, we hear you.\n\n01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:10.640\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:11.200\nMe?\n\n01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:13.680\nAnd I promise this is for change.\n\n01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:16.440\nI take my elvish blade, and I go right for the,\n\n01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:19.960\nthe, the, the wounds that Dan created.\n\n01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:27.280\nOK, you miss as you step out of the circle.\n\n01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:30.400\nThe, the thing D, D, what do you call it?\n\n01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:31.560\nIt deregulates.\n\n01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:32.280\nI don't know.\n\n01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:35.360\nIt fucks up more and it, it, it's cinches tight.\n\n01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:38.720\nAnd now it looks like it's kind of strangling the demon,\n\n01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:42.040\nbut not like lethally, just like he's like, ah, this is an asshole.\n\n01:52:42.040 --> 01:52:45.640\nSo Carlos, now this is the time to get him.\n\n01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:48.800\nI'm going to, can I cast bull strength on Carlos\n\n01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:52.240\nand give him, yeah, definitely.\n\n01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:55.000\nYou'll get plus four strength for one minute.\n\n01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.200\nIf I, if I cast bull strength on you,\n\n01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:59.000\nI'm going to let you fucking take this.\n\n01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:02.560\nBut what am I, I don't, you're going to kill the demon.\n\n01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:04.760\nI'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to give you plus four\n\n01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:05.200\nstrengths.\n\n01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:05.560\nOK.\n\n01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:08.440\nYou want to do that?\n\n01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:09.400\nCan't hear you.\n\n01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:10.560\nDon't hear anybody.\n\n01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:19.080\nIs there a mosquito around?\n\n01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:20.080\nOoh.\n\n01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:21.600\nI just, OK.\n\n01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:23.520\nOK, I cast bull strength on Carlos.\n\n01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:24.200\nThat happens.\n\n01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:25.840\nYou get all strong and such.\n\n01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:28.760\nAll right, well then, physically I'm strong.\n\n01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:30.720\nOh yeah, four more.\n\n01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:32.000\nWell then I, I'm going to use my.\n\n01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:33.920\nYou got a plus four, go kick some butt.\n\n01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:35.280\nWe got a strangled demon.\n\n01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:37.560\nYeah, and there's four more cultists.\n\n01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:43.080\nOK, well then I'm physically using my, my morning star.\n\n01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:45.160\nAll right.\n\n01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:47.400\nIt's not impressive.\n\n01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:51.600\nIt is when you clock, what do you attack?\n\n01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:53.400\nWhat do you mean, time, times two critical?\n\n01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:55.240\nWhat are you attacking?\n\n01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:57.680\nThe thing, the arm, shoulder.\n\n01:53:57.680 --> 01:53:59.800\nYou clock him right in the shoulder.\n\n01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:03.720\nIt deals another 12 damage.\n\n01:54:03.720 --> 01:54:05.200\nYeah.\n\n01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:07.160\nIt's, it's not, it's hurting him,\n\n01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:08.920\nbut it's like, he's a giant, giant.\n\n01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:13.320\nOK, thank you for the, making me better than I am.\n\n01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:14.320\nThat's not really what I do.\n\n01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:15.680\nIs the portal still closing?\n\n01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:18.560\nIt's like cinched tight around him, the demon's stuck.\n\n01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:20.120\nIt's like he can't get all the way out\n\n01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:22.160\nbecause the ritual has been disrupted.\n\n01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:23.160\nOh.\n\n01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:26.160\nMm, mm, mm, ah.\n\n01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:31.440\nWho's the
