We have so\n\n00:51.980 --> 00:52.820\nWhat's to do?\n\n00:52.820 --> 00:55.000\nWe're gonna just fucking, we're just gonna go.\n\n00:55.000 --> 00:57.260\nWe don't often have a lot to do.\n\n00:57.260 --> 01:00.600\nI saw your eyes dart to my new affectation.\n\n01:00.600 --> 01:04.760\nThis'll be 20 minutes of the show.\n\n01:04.760 --> 01:09.040\nI, Dan, for the home listener,\n\n01:09.040 --> 01:12.200\nhas taken to over the last couple days\n\n01:13.200 --> 01:16.040\nwearing an invention of, I believe Spencer's design.\n\n01:16.040 --> 01:17.040\nCorrect?\n\n01:17.040 --> 01:19.920\nI went to Spencer, I said, Spencer,\n\n01:19.920 --> 01:21.640\nI need to keep track of things.\n\n01:21.640 --> 01:22.720\nVery quickly.\n\n01:22.720 --> 01:26.640\nLike, how quickly, beyond Steve Job's definition,\n\n01:28.880 --> 01:30.000\nI call him Job's.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:30.840\nOkay.\n\n01:30.840 --> 01:32.840\nI think of him as a biblical character.\n\n01:33.760 --> 01:35.520\nBeyond Steve Job's definition of like,\n\n01:35.520 --> 01:37.840\nlike visionary though he was,\n\n01:37.840 --> 01:40.440\nlike how quickly can Dan Harmon's brain\n\n01:40.440 --> 01:42.680\nbe stored permanently?\n\n01:42.680 --> 01:45.040\nSo I'm wearing a notepad around my neck\n\n01:45.040 --> 01:46.200\nwith a pen on the string.\n\n01:46.200 --> 01:49.600\nIt looks, I mean, is it a shoelace or a lanyard string?\n\n01:49.600 --> 01:52.680\nOr what have you, it's a sort of black, black cordage.\n\n01:52.680 --> 01:55.280\nThe brilliant thing about this is that it has three components,\n\n01:55.280 --> 01:57.520\nall of which can be replaced.\n\n01:57.520 --> 01:59.280\nIt doesn't, like I've already forgotten\n\n01:59.280 --> 02:01.360\nmany of them on my bed stand.\n\n02:01.360 --> 02:03.360\nSpencer is then able to create a new one.\n\n02:03.360 --> 02:05.400\nBut for the home listener, for the home listener,\n\n02:05.400 --> 02:07.120\nyou have a black string around your neck.\n\n02:07.120 --> 02:09.360\nIt's a black string around my neck.\n\n02:09.360 --> 02:12.200\nA kind of a three by five or four by six\n\n02:12.200 --> 02:16.360\nlooking a spiral notepad and a pen dangling.\n\n02:16.360 --> 02:20.560\nA pen with the pocket clip of the pen anchored\n\n02:20.560 --> 02:21.400\non the string.\n\n02:21.400 --> 02:22.240\nSo let me show you.\n\n02:22.240 --> 02:25.760\nSo you sir, what's your name?\n\n02:25.760 --> 02:26.600\nGreg.\n\n02:31.600 --> 02:33.720\nNow, here's the thing, it'll take forever\n\n02:33.720 --> 02:36.960\nto put the pen back, but Greg, boom,\n\n02:36.960 --> 02:40.040\nfucking your mouth to my notepad.\n\n02:40.040 --> 02:42.360\nLike that's not, like now, okay,\n\n02:42.360 --> 02:44.480\nnow let's pretend I don't have the notepad around my neck.\n\n02:44.480 --> 02:46.600\nWhat's your name?\n\n02:46.600 --> 02:48.240\nGreg.\n\n02:48.240 --> 02:51.680\nNow Dan's taking out his enormous phone.\n\n02:51.680 --> 02:52.680\nYou got to open up an app.\n\n02:52.680 --> 02:56.880\nGet away from 4chan and onto the notepad document.\n\n02:56.880 --> 03:00.320\nFuck it, at a certain point, it's like, fuck, who's Greg?\n\n03:00.320 --> 03:03.240\nWho cares?\n\n03:03.240 --> 03:07.560\nHumanity, the eye harmin' around my neck.\n\n03:07.560 --> 03:09.800\nSpencer Crittenden created this.\n\n03:09.800 --> 03:11.160\nEye harmin' with my idea.\n\n03:11.160 --> 03:12.960\nI coined the phrase eye harmin'.\n\n03:12.960 --> 03:13.760\nEye harmin'.\n\n03:13.760 --> 03:15.200\nI also named it the eye harmin'.\n\n03:15.200 --> 03:18.000\nI called it the eye harmin', or also chest notes.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:20.440\nChest notes.\n\n03:20.440 --> 03:21.320\nThis is a big deal.\n\n03:21.320 --> 03:22.160\nHere's the other thing.\n\n03:22.160 --> 03:23.760\nWhat about memo roundum?\n\n03:28.160 --> 03:30.800\nMemo roundum, memo roundum, so it could be unisex.\n\n03:30.800 --> 03:32.800\nYou memo roundum now?\n\n03:32.800 --> 03:34.800\nI want to explain something super cool about this,\n\n03:34.800 --> 03:36.840\nis that like Spencer and I talked about this,\n\n03:36.840 --> 03:41.120\nand he said, yeah, but it won't be,\n\n03:41.120 --> 03:42.840\nlike if the string goes through the top,\n\n03:42.840 --> 03:43.920\nthen you won't be able to.\n\n03:43.920 --> 03:47.000\nAnd I said, look, here's the thing.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:50.120\nI am prepared to change my way of thinking\n\n03:50.120 --> 03:53.000\nabout what constitutes the bottom and top of a notepad.\n\n03:57.720 --> 03:58.560\nThat's the genius.\n\n03:58.560 --> 04:01.960\nThat's me being Steve Jobs.\n\n04:01.960 --> 04:07.640\nThis is, that's the whole point is, shkah, bam.\n\n04:07.640 --> 04:12.200\nAll you have to do is think different.\n\n04:12.200 --> 04:15.000\nThis is the top now.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:16.120\nIt's fucking amazing.\n\n04:16.120 --> 04:21.280\nAnd also, if you choose to, if my name happened\n\n04:21.280 --> 04:25.600\nto be on the cover, you'd know my name.\n\n04:25.600 --> 04:28.320\nSo if we all did, this is like my Malcolm X bow tie,\n\n04:28.320 --> 04:31.880\nlike just in case we're going on a movement here.\n\n04:31.880 --> 04:32.920\nDon't adopt it right away.\n\n04:32.920 --> 04:34.000\nLet me refine this.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:35.480\nLet me workshop this.\n\n04:35.480 --> 04:37.800\nBecause I think the size can be adjusted.\n\n04:37.800 --> 04:39.360\nI put forward to Dan earlier.\n\n04:39.360 --> 04:39.960\nDon't do anything yet.\n\n04:39.960 --> 04:41.200\nI put forward to Dan earlier that he\n\n04:41.200 --> 04:42.240\nshould get a bigger notepad.\n\n04:42.240 --> 04:43.920\nAnd on the front of it, just draw a big clock\n\n04:43.920 --> 04:45.680\nand be like, flavor Flav.\n\n04:45.680 --> 04:47.880\nLet me workshop it, and then we'll be OK.\n\n04:47.880 --> 04:48.760\nWhat about this size?\n\n04:48.760 --> 04:50.280\nThis is what I was talking to you earlier.\n\n04:50.280 --> 04:51.120\nIs that more suitable?\n\n04:51.120 --> 04:52.000\nThat's what I had in mind.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:56.880\nSpencer doesn't, you know, he's a strange child.\n\n04:56.880 --> 04:58.880\nI think he went and cut a real notebook\n\n04:58.880 --> 05:00.120\ninto different shapes.\n\n05:00.120 --> 05:01.120\nI don't know.\n\n05:01.120 --> 05:03.960\nWait, is that not, is that hewn out of a larger thing?\n\n05:03.960 --> 05:05.240\nYeah, he does weird shit.\n\n05:05.240 --> 05:06.320\nHe doesn't.\n\n05:06.320 --> 05:10.360\nIf you go into Spencer's, like, if you get a ride from Spencer,\n\n05:10.360 --> 05:13.800\nhe'll have a, like, Spencer has, like,\n\n05:13.800 --> 05:14.840\nhe's like a myth buster.\n\n05:14.840 --> 05:19.360\nLike, he has, like, he'll have, like, a thing in his car\n\n05:19.360 --> 05:22.160\nthat's, like, made out of binder clips that\n\n05:22.160 --> 05:23.720\nwill hold his iPhone.\n\n05:23.720 --> 05:27.920\nBut it's like, you know, he's like a life hacker.\n\n05:27.920 --> 05:29.000\nHe's a life hacker.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:29.520\nOK.\n\n05:29.520 --> 05:30.000\nYeah.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:32.000\nDon't worry about it.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:34.680\nHave you got any chestnuts on your chestnuts there for us?\n\n05:34.680 --> 05:36.640\nYes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I do.\n\n05:36.640 --> 05:38.560\nMy breathing issue, I want to talk about that.\n\n05:38.560 --> 05:40.640\nI've been listening to Harbitan episodes,\n\n05:40.640 --> 05:43.560\nand I've noticed that my thing is that I do this.\n\n05:43.560 --> 05:46.040\nHey, Jeff, giraffes are weird, right?\n\n05:46.040 --> 05:47.960\nWhy do they have such long necks?\n\n05:47.960 --> 05:55.280\nI have this nerd inhale that I get.\n\n05:55.280 --> 05:57.440\nYou guys know what I mean, right?\n\n05:57.440 --> 05:59.800\nLike, I've never noticed anything like this.\n\n05:59.800 --> 06:00.920\nI'd like to change it.\n\n06:00.920 --> 06:02.280\nI don't want to do it anymore.\n\n06:02.280 --> 06:04.120\nYou make a face like you're breathing through your nose,\n\n06:04.120 --> 06:05.960\nbut you're going through your mouth, aren't you?\n\n06:05.960 --> 06:07.480\nWell, I'm imitating the sound.\n\n06:07.480 --> 06:12.200\nI don't know what I'm doing it, but like it's a weird thing to have to listen to and I don't want to do it anymore\n\n06:12.200 --> 06:17.800\nOkay, all right. That's a self-adjustment. I'd like to talk tonight about how to take a compliment\n\n06:19.280 --> 06:24.900\nOkay, a lot of us don't know how to do that say say what Adam. That's a good topic. Yes. Thank you, Adam\n\n06:25.120 --> 06:27.040\nSee you just did it. Oh\n\n06:27.040 --> 06:29.040\nYes, great\n\n06:30.800 --> 06:32.880\nNext next item on the agenda\n\n06:32.880 --> 06:36.440\nThat was so much easier than we all expected\n\n06:37.560 --> 06:40.760\nJeff tell me I did it tell me I did a good job at something Dan\n\n06:40.760 --> 06:45.520\nThat is a lovely notepad hanging around your midsection. Well, it's a work in progress. I don't know what I'm doing\n\n06:45.920 --> 06:48.880\nSee what I did there. I told him he was a piece of shit. I\n\n06:49.800 --> 06:52.920\nTold me there's nobody's talking about we all have that on us\n\n06:52.920 --> 06:56.320\nWe won't we want to be humble and it's for it's it's for a good reason\n\n06:56.320 --> 06:58.040\nIs there any concern of when you're wearing it?\n\n06:58.040 --> 07:04.120\nI had to go back to the chest notes or I Harmon, but is there any concern is you wearing a big notepad around your chest?\n\n07:04.120 --> 07:06.600\nThat people will mistake you for like a death\n\n07:09.600 --> 07:16.240\nYeah, I'm 40 years old. I'm I'm I'm charging into the fucking preach. You look it makes you look a little special\n\n07:17.080 --> 07:22.440\nAnd I an argument could be made that I am see you just took another compliment. I snuck one in there and you took it\n\n07:22.440 --> 07:25.840\nThank you. You're welcome. Thank you. That was a great compliment. All right\n\n07:25.840 --> 07:27.840\nYou ain't you ain't shitting\n\n07:28.360 --> 07:30.960\nSee what we're doing there. That's that's how work gets done\n\n07:33.160 --> 07:37.640\nAre you are you have you always been bad at taking compliments? Yeah, you seem like you can take a compliment\n\n07:37.640 --> 07:41.920\nI've learned I had therapists that told me they said when you do that\n\n07:42.760 --> 07:48.920\nYou tell people that they're full of shit and somebody says I liked I liked like I like what you did\n\n07:48.920 --> 07:52.920\nI like what you do. I like your jacket. I like your hair. You look you look like you lost weight\n\n07:52.920 --> 07:59.240\nUh, something as you tell them you automatically go. No, I haven't I don't know what you're just saying to them\n\n07:59.240 --> 08:01.960\nYou don't know what you're talking about your eyeballs are idiots. You're an idiot\n\n08:02.360 --> 08:08.520\nYou're in your brain is dumb. You don't know what you're talking about, right? It's it's but it's a it's a it's a it's a big\n\n08:08.520 --> 08:13.000\nIt's a fucking thing. It's it's the crux. It's the it's the it's the knot\n\n08:13.400 --> 08:20.200\nIt's the knot of civilization Jeff. We've all like like we need to figure this out. I'd like to try to figure it out\n\n08:20.200 --> 08:22.200\nWhat are you writing down? I\n\n08:22.200 --> 08:29.080\nMake notes all the time. Okay. All right. Good job. What's that guy's name? What's that guy's name in the front row Greg? All right, okay?\n\n08:30.720 --> 08:32.720\nYeah\n\n08:32.800 --> 08:35.080\nJust even the writing it down. We wrote it down in my brain\n\n08:35.080 --> 08:35.920\nYeah, it is a thing though\n\n08:35.920 --> 08:39.760\nWhen someone pays you a column even if you disagree with them even if you think like it someone goes\n\n08:39.760 --> 08:43.320\nOh, you look nice today, and you feel like you look like shit or you've had a bad day when somebody says something nice\n\n08:43.480 --> 08:48.760\nEven if you think that they're wrong you still say thank you. You don't have to you don't have to go you know what you're really, right?\n\n08:48.760 --> 08:53.600\nYou're really I really yeah, they're never they're never gonna be like no one's ever gonna come up to you go\n\n08:53.600 --> 09:00.040\nI love your hair, and then you go. Thank you. They're never gonna walk away and go. He said thank you. What a dick\n\n09:01.560 --> 09:03.400\nUnless they're a huge dick\n\n09:03.400 --> 09:07.080\nAnd they're sitting out so much once you start getting good at taking compliments because like you know\n\n09:07.080 --> 09:11.600\nWe all do like what my friend kind of kind of like this old thing something so you look great today\n\n09:11.600 --> 09:14.480\nOh, this is a I got this off the rack. It's a thrift store at five dollars\n\n09:14.480 --> 09:20.200\nAnd you say like oh this whole thing like you're stupid you're wrong if you just say thank you that's great\n\n09:20.200 --> 09:25.880\nBut then once you get good at that then people pay you sarcastic compliments. He goes nice suit, bro. You go. Thank you\n\n09:27.200 --> 09:30.280\nAnd here's what I'd like to talk about this is the weird thing\n\n09:31.040 --> 09:33.040\nFishing for compliments\n\n09:33.200 --> 09:35.200\nThis is where people like me\n\n09:35.280 --> 09:37.280\nGet thrown for a loop\n\n09:37.360 --> 09:41.000\nMany times people come up to you and and self-deprecate\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:47.000\nAs an entree to a conversation people come up to you and they say\n\n09:48.800 --> 09:52.800\nMy shirt so stupid I shut down at that point\n\n09:52.800 --> 09:57.720\nI know and I watch everyone around me go your shirts amazing\n\n09:58.440 --> 10:01.320\nAnd I watch society rise around me\n\n10:01.920 --> 10:07.400\nBecause I shut down I go I go I don't I never had an opinion about your shirt\n\n10:07.400 --> 10:11.360\nBut I do know that you're trying to get me to say something about your shirt\n\n10:11.520 --> 10:13.520\nAnd I can't do it and I won't do it\n\n10:14.280 --> 10:19.400\nBecause in my world if I tell you your shirt is noteworthy. It's fucking noteworthy\n\n10:19.760 --> 10:26.040\nLike that's that's my Bitcoin like I create my like my my currency\n\n10:26.800 --> 10:31.720\nDan Harmon said have a nice day to me. I should have a nice day\n\n10:32.960 --> 10:34.960\nDan Harmon told me to\n\n10:34.960 --> 10:38.600\nHe didn't just barf it out now. You're paying yourself compliments\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:44.320\nNo, I'm not I'm being a thank-you-self. Thank-you-self. Like I don't know\n\n10:45.040 --> 10:48.880\nI'm bad at making a show. I don't know. I shouldn't I shouldn't be talking to a microphone at all\n\n10:48.880 --> 10:54.560\nI should just stop. I should just stop. I should just stop talking on this microphone. I don't I don't even know what I'm doing\n\n10:55.080 --> 10:57.080\nEverybody thanks for coming\n\n10:57.080 --> 11:06.400\nEvery day we feel that right that's that that's the thing like like people people puncture like their little mosquito proboscis\n\n11:06.560 --> 11:11.000\nInto you and it's got a little hook on the other end of it. They want something from you\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:17.960\nI can't I like I like I live people people do it all the time and I think I think good people just just\n\n11:18.560 --> 11:21.360\nLike they respond to it appropriately like people go\n\n11:21.360 --> 11:25.760\nI didn't know what I did with my hair and then someone goes like that looks great\n\n11:25.760 --> 11:30.400\nIt's great, and then they make friends, and I don't know how to do that. That's where I shut down\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:34.000\nGive me a script\n\n11:34.720 --> 11:40.240\nTalking to you.

You can't just you can't just create an effect by saying the opposite thing fuck you\n\n11:48.120 --> 11:52.840\nHow should people approach you then on all fours\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:59.440\nWith with a tray of whatever they are offering me on the back of their neck I\n\n12:00.400 --> 12:04.360\nDon't know I don't know I swear to God. I don't know I don't know I\n\n12:05.160 --> 12:10.120\nReally don't know I just I just know what I'm being baited, and I don't respond to it\n\n12:10.960 --> 12:12.960\nWhat what sweetie what?\n\n12:12.960 --> 12:18.600\nOh Aaron's ejaculating Aaron's crying out Aaron's crying out.

I heard that this recently. Oh my god. I can't believe how far this is like\n\n16:11.480 --> 16:19.800\nProliferated as it is it coming back to come back to me, but I can't believe that it's like still like I've forgotten about it\n\n16:19.800 --> 16:25.160\nI've honestly forgotten about it like I wish I could do with other things, but I have and now it's like\n\n16:25.160 --> 16:27.680\nOh, you reminded me of this thing. Well, I think it's very resonant\n\n16:28.680 --> 16:32.080\nInteresting wasn't very far from here actually physically was not very far from here\n\n16:32.080 --> 16:33.600\nYou were in Duncan Tressel's podcast\n\n16:33.600 --> 16:38.080\nYou go listen to the episode and you were describing this brief experience that you had where you went in as a young actor\n\n16:38.080 --> 16:41.720\nGoing in or an old actor. Who knows? Maybe you have some progeria. I don't know\n\n16:42.160 --> 16:48.100\nYou you you went into this thing and you experienced the normal amount of like weird\n\n16:48.600 --> 16:51.000\nhierarchy like odd fascistic\n\n16:51.760 --> 16:58.200\nCash casting like culture and you just bothered to do what any normal human being would do under normal circumstances\n\n16:58.200 --> 17:02.320\nJust go go fuck yourself to somebody who was acting weird to you and it was like\n\n17:03.040 --> 17:07.080\nThey can go listen to the story about it. I don't know either. I was stricken with that\n\n17:07.080 --> 17:11.600\nI never perceived you as a revolutionary. Oh, I I have done some bad stuff\n\n17:12.160 --> 17:17.360\nYeah, what's your what are your politics? I don't know. I mean, I don't know if I have true politics\n\n17:17.360 --> 17:22.520\nBut I kind of waver around like I'll sympathize with al-Qaeda sometimes\n\n17:22.960 --> 17:24.400\nEveryone's in a while\n\n17:24.400 --> 17:26.400\nEveryone's in a while much room for the underdog\n\n17:29.640 --> 17:32.880\nI'm I feel like I'm the underdog and always have been sort of an underdog\n\n17:32.880 --> 17:40.080\nSo if there's someone beating up a guy, if someone gives somebody a hard time, I'll be there Johnny Pemberton will be there\n\n17:40.080 --> 17:42.600\nYeah, okay, I'll kind of been getting a free ride for two\n\n17:44.440 --> 17:48.520\nThe poor bastards everyone mispronounces their name like they can't get like a\n\n17:49.320 --> 17:53.720\nGeneralized the spelling. It's like Gaddafi like you can spell Gaddafi wherever you want\n\n17:53.720 --> 17:58.840\nI think I have a whole different alphabet. We don't know about that. It's too bad. I feel bad for them kind of they're crazy\n\n17:58.840 --> 18:09.600\nSo what kind of what kind of stuff could people I don't know it's awkward for people to sell themselves, but\n\n18:10.240 --> 18:14.600\nYou know people tuning into your podcast. What are they? What are they? What are they looking for?\n\n18:14.600 --> 18:17.800\nOh, you're looking for the early covax of audio. Oh, yeah\n\n18:17.800 --> 18:24.880\nThere's a lot of sounds a lot of communication a lot of prank phone calls a significant amount of prank phone calls\n\n18:24.880 --> 18:28.480\nBut they're not really prank phone calls. They're more just like phone calls\n\n18:29.920 --> 18:34.520\nCan we do it? Can you pretend that I'm like a guy working at just just working?\n\n18:34.520 --> 18:38.480\nOkay, let's say you work at like Halliburton.

Like like when you yeah, you can say that. Yeah\n\n22:00.320 --> 22:05.200\nYou don't believe in hierarchy like me like I want to go to the moon and I want to create a society\n\n22:05.840 --> 22:09.280\nWhether no one's in charge. So sort of like\n\n22:09.280 --> 22:12.920\nLike a like a it's like a randish\n\n22:13.560 --> 22:16.680\nRandish, it's an randish. I'm randish. I\n\n22:17.680 --> 22:22.800\nYeah, it's not like a it's itch. I haven't read her. Yeah, but you can still say\n\n22:25.800 --> 22:30.920\nIt's not like she's kind of the heroine of the libertarian party, isn't she? Yeah, she's like the scapegoat\n\n22:30.920 --> 22:33.840\nI feel like as well, but libertarian that's sort of like oh\n\n22:34.480 --> 22:38.080\nGod made rich people rich and let's let's all have it out\n\n22:38.080 --> 22:44.040\nI don't really it's like those Koch brothers. They consider themselves libertarians, but they've become so rich\n\n22:44.040 --> 22:47.880\nThey've become the very thing they wanted to stop having happened\n\n22:47.880 --> 22:53.880\nI feel like no, that's the thing like like rich white guys like grew up whose dads grew up in trailer parks like me like you\n\n22:53.880 --> 22:56.760\nBootstrappers like that's that's sort of part of the problem\n\n22:56.760 --> 23:02.720\nYou become a libertarian because that's the way you cope with with wealth like like and it's the it is the easiest route to do\n\n23:02.720 --> 23:06.400\nIt you you go like well the system works for me\n\n23:06.400 --> 23:09.280\nTeddy Roosevelt the system worked for me\n\n23:10.080 --> 23:15.560\nThe system worked for me the creators of South Park like like we we rose up through the thing\n\n23:15.560 --> 23:17.120\nSo it must work for everybody\n\n23:17.120 --> 23:21.040\nSo anybody complaining is as guilty as anybody oppressing the people complaining\n\n23:21.040 --> 23:24.400\nThey say they don't like government, but the corporations and the free market man\n\n23:24.400 --> 23:28.480\nThey become the government. Yeah, it's like the world should be run by Ford Motors and GE and stuff like that\n\n23:28.480 --> 23:30.720\nWhich is kind of already is like it's like they love\n\n23:31.680 --> 23:33.360\nLiberty, but they hate\n\n23:33.360 --> 23:39.280\nSociety, I don't I don't I don't get it. I went to somehow because a friend of mine is involved with Reason magazine\n\n23:39.280 --> 23:42.720\nAnd he was doing some things so I was at this like convention in Vegas\n\n23:42.720 --> 23:49.160\nThere was a big libertarian convention and my big problem just from looking at it is like and I actually said to somebody said\n\n23:49.160 --> 23:53.640\nCan I give you guys one note on your movement like if you're gonna try to like make this an actual movement?\n\n23:55.320 --> 23:57.320\nLess white guys and chinos\n\n23:58.360 --> 24:01.320\nLike you have to get a couple ladies in here and maybe a black dude\n\n24:01.320 --> 24:07.520\nBecause it's a bunch of white D bags walking around the same pants in the same shirt with the same cuff links and talking about how\n\n24:07.800 --> 24:15.080\nMoney is the world's greatest thing. It's the capitalism is fucking amazing. It's as amazing as sexual reproduction in biology\n\n24:15.120 --> 24:19.160\nIt's it's taking an organism and cutting it in half and saying ladies on the left\n\n24:19.320 --> 24:23.880\nFellows of the right and before you know it. You're not relying on like mutation to\n\n24:24.440 --> 24:30.760\nChange the species. It's fantastic, but it's not something you should base like society everything on yeah\n\n24:30.760 --> 24:35.160\nAnd everything because because you when you step over a homeless dude on the sidewalk\n\n24:35.440 --> 24:41.960\nYou're you're the reason you're doing it is because there's absolutely nothing to profit you and stepping over him\n\n24:42.040 --> 24:46.600\nThat is so obviously we have a system that right or wrong\n\n24:47.120 --> 24:55.240\nGood or bad. Well, whatever your definition is what we know for sure is that there's some dudes on the sidewalk that it's not working for\n\n24:55.400 --> 24:59.480\nBecause unless that guy loves the sidewalk loves it so much\n\n24:59.480 --> 25:05.600\nWell, he's kissing it. I'm like but but even still it doesn't work because there's a sidewalk the guy that\n\n25:05.840 --> 25:11.000\nIt's a sidewalk outside a donut shop and the guy's going get out of my sidewalk. You stop kissing it\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:14.160\nYou love it so much. Get out of here bringing the value of the donuts down\n\n25:14.160 --> 25:19.440\nYeah, exactly like no one wants to step over you to buy a donut. You're lowering the value of my donut shop\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:27.400\nThere's capitalism as an engine, but it's not the chassis. It's not the axle. It's not the tires, you know\n\n25:27.400 --> 25:31.800\nThat's like make sure it makes it go fast. It's it's it's incredibly\n\n25:32.360 --> 25:36.240\nIngenious because it capitalism simply is an agreement. We all make every day\n\n25:36.240 --> 25:41.800\nWe wake up and decide that we should let's all go sell our practical activity and what we get back\n\n25:42.240 --> 25:45.480\nIs like less than what our actual activity is worth\n\n25:45.760 --> 25:48.360\nSo if we go out and make cars for eight hours a day\n\n25:48.640 --> 25:53.960\nWe don't get paid in the amount the cars that we made were worth because that wouldn't make any money for the for the\n\n25:53.960 --> 25:59.720\nCapitalists so we they we're gonna pay you a lot less than what the car is worth and that free part of our labor\n\n25:59.720 --> 26:04.440\nWhich is almost all of it. That's what makes cap that that's capitalism. We've all just agreed\n\n26:04.440 --> 26:07.400\nWe agree every morning when we get up. Let's all just go sell\n\n26:07.880 --> 26:11.600\nActivity are our most of our day and we only if you actually have a real job\n\n26:11.600 --> 26:13.600\nYou only get a couple hours of your day to do anything\n\n26:14.240 --> 26:17.520\nThat you want to do that's it's insane. Maybe not at all\n\n26:17.520 --> 26:24.200\nAnd they are and yeah, if you have you know, like you have a couple hours to to dispense with your family or make a model airplane\n\n26:24.200 --> 26:26.200\nYeah, it's like a dick. It's dangerous\n\n26:27.080 --> 26:34.120\nThere's a solution capitalism doesn't have to be scrapped Johnny Pemberton told a story on Doug and Dressel podcast Johnny Pemberton goes in\n\n26:34.560 --> 26:36.160\nfor an audition\n\n26:36.160 --> 26:38.680\nThere's this whole existing system that\n\n26:40.080 --> 26:44.400\nResults in people treating everyone like crap down to the bottom\n\n26:44.400 --> 26:50.960\nSo you walk in this fluorescent lit fucking tiny office with some lady that knows nothing about acting knows nothing about anything\n\n26:51.160 --> 26:57.120\nBut but but is sitting there like a troll under a bridge treating actors like shit. This is a thing in LA\n\n26:57.120 --> 27:01.120\nYou're sitting you're listening in Iowa and you're going fuck you your actors got it so bad\n\n27:01.360 --> 27:08.240\nWe're telling you this is the equivalent of welding a fucking thing in LA every every town as its industry\n\n27:08.240 --> 27:10.240\nThere's a lot of people like\n\n27:11.200 --> 27:12.160\nSuffering out here\n\n27:12.160 --> 27:16.000\nSo Johnny walks into he tells the story on Duncan's podcast\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:22.240\nHe walks in and he starts talking. There's a lady talking to another guy. They're talking talking. He sees another guy\n\n27:22.240 --> 27:27.840\nThey're talking and he hears something and she's going there's no talking in here and he goes. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that\n\n27:28.480 --> 27:29.840\nyou\n\n27:29.840 --> 27:33.240\nYou guys were talking so it was okay to talk in here and then the other guy goes\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:36.280\nthat's a good way to talk to casting and\n\n27:36.280 --> 27:43.400\nAnd long story short the story ends with you dropping your script on the ground and saying fuck you and walking away\n\n27:43.920 --> 27:45.920\nThat's how capitalism works\n\n27:47.680 --> 27:49.680\nCapitalism can work\n\n27:49.880 --> 27:52.500\nEvery time you get a call from a from a telemarketer\n\n27:53.240 --> 28:00.560\nCapitalism could work if the people calling you like cold calling you to go if if they bothered to go fuck you\n\n28:00.560 --> 28:06.520\nThere's a limit. There's a limit to my humanity. Anyways, I've done. I sound like a libertarian when I say that\n\n28:07.320 --> 28:11.840\nIt's okay to be a little bit libertarian, isn't it? I think I think that's spirit\n\n28:11.840 --> 28:15.000\nYeah, yeah, but I think when you have a billion dollars and you're a libertarian\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:18.400\nYou should probably like start to become a Democrat. She started church. I\n\n28:19.880 --> 28:23.400\nKnow I think when you're like in the stratosphere as a libertarian\n\n28:23.400 --> 28:27.160\nYou should probably realize a lot of what libertarians I've talked to say it sounds like kind of stuff\n\n28:27.160 --> 28:32.000\nI believe in like like like I I don't like government. I hate the idea of like arbitrary like, you know\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:36.560\nLike rule and stuff like that that but they stop short of the idea like like they worship money\n\n28:36.560 --> 28:44.160\nThey worship the they worship capitalism and so they they talk this kind of high and mighty idealism about like we should all just be\n\n28:45.040 --> 28:47.480\nLiberty man like like no one should tell you ever what to do\n\n28:47.480 --> 28:52.360\nBut it's like capitalism was the whole point of this it tells everybody what to do and this necessitates unemployment\n\n28:52.360 --> 28:58.880\nThere has to be unemployed people. There has to be famine. There has to be a conflict at all times to keep profits\n\n28:58.880 --> 29:04.400\nThere has to be we have to let more food rot every day that is needed to feed everybody every day to keep fucking grain prices at the\n\n29:04.400 --> 29:10.760\nSame place. That's insanity. That's that's a chaotic. That's a chaotic idea. And so fuck libertarian. This is what I'm trying to say\n\n29:12.040 --> 29:15.080\nYeah, and fuck ain't rant fuck ain't rant\n\n29:15.800 --> 29:17.800\nyour book sucks\n\n29:17.800 --> 29:22.760\nShe's she is nobody likes the fountain head unless they're a cock and like it's 13 and they're fucking this like no\n\n29:22.760 --> 29:24.240\nIt's not a good book\n\n29:24.240 --> 29:29.360\nShe is dead though. So, huh? She's she died. Yeah, well, she yeah, she has she had a good time. She had a good run\n\n29:29.360 --> 29:31.360\nLet's go dig her up and fuck it. You know what?\n\n29:32.440 --> 29:37.520\nJust show me what you act. Let's do it. Yeah, she had she had terrible teeth. Did she really? Yeah, so\n\n29:38.160 --> 29:40.760\nLet's see. I thought you I thought you were ready for the underdog\n\n29:41.320 --> 29:44.480\nWell, I don't consider those teeth to be underdog teeth\n\n29:44.480 --> 29:48.720\nWould you rather fuck iran's corpse or be a member of al-qaeda?\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:52.000\nal-qaeda\n\n29:52.040 --> 29:54.040\nAll right\n\n29:54.040 --> 30:22.560\nI feel like I feel like every time I've seen Johnny Pemberton. He has decreased in age by three years. I\n\n30:22.560 --> 30:27.360\nDon't know. He's keeps he looks cutting his hair shorter. He looked to be about 15\n\n30:27.360 --> 30:30.560\nHe was a channel 101 kid like a million years ago\n\n30:30.560 --> 30:36.920\nAnd I was like I just kind of got the Michael Sarah adorable thing going and then Michael Sarah now it looks like Michael Cain\n\n30:38.960 --> 30:44.600\nAnd Johnny Pemberton weeded it out. It was like I remember the first time I saw it Pemberton\n\n30:44.600 --> 30:47.520\nI was like fuck. He must be so pissed about Michael Sarah\n\n30:47.520 --> 30:53.420\nBut now it's it's a million years later fucking Michael Sarah. It looks like a Loch Ness monster\n\n30:55.280 --> 31:00.920\nPemberton's got the fucking lockdown on the adorable little baby face. You said that Michael Sarah has aged poorly\n\n31:03.920 --> 31:07.880\nHe no longer looks like Johnny Pemberton. What can we say? Let's leave it at that\n\n31:11.440 --> 31:13.360\nThere was a point when they looked the same to me\n\n31:13.360 --> 31:18.480\nIs that okay? I guess I don't see enough of Michael Sarah walking around. Well, well our next guest\n\n31:19.960 --> 31:24.160\nThere's Michael Sarah. That'd be so awesome. Yeah, that was a walker\n\n31:26.840 --> 31:30.520\nHe looks like the Loch Ness monster nobody knows what the Loch Ness monster looks like\n\n31:33.760 --> 31:35.760\nTerrible analogy\n\n31:35.760 --> 31:45.600\nI don't know people people grow old and they die. We're gonna go to we're gonna go to Loch Ness around the holidays\n\n31:45.600 --> 31:51.080\nYeah, we're taking a trip to Scotland and we're gonna go we're gonna go to Infernescent. Do we have any moon?\n\n31:53.480 --> 31:59.120\nProblems that need to be discussed that the subreddit Jeff was a buzz about Lisette\n\n32:00.160 --> 32:02.760\nYeah, it's Lisette here. Yes. Hello\n\n32:02.760 --> 32:04.760\nLisette\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:07.000\nWelcome back. Yeah\n\n32:07.160 --> 32:09.840\nLet's show last week kind of seems like a month ago\n\n32:09.840 --> 32:16.360\nI never I didn't quite understand why like the room turned on on Lisette like that. I got funky. I think they didn't like her\n\n32:20.400 --> 32:24.520\nCool reason to like chant someone down and I will I will immediately say like I\n\n32:25.360 --> 32:31.280\nBecause a lot of the if you go through the subreddit online like a lot of the sentiment is like why didn't Dan do something?\n\n32:31.280 --> 32:36.280\nHe's the mayor and I'll tell you why I was bored with the topic of like what was going on\n\n32:36.280 --> 32:38.960\nI wanted to play just dragons, but moreover\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:43.360\nLike I was sort of like how do you how do you resolve something like this?\n\n32:43.400 --> 32:51.120\nLike there's this mob rule emerging and I think what happened is it's la and like she said something that was like technically not\n\n32:51.640 --> 32:54.280\nappropriate to you know, it's like I\n\n32:55.280 --> 32:57.760\nabsolutely everybody that sort of voiced a\n\n32:57.760 --> 33:03.840\nOh, that's not true. What you're saying isn't true. It's an outdated thing and it's gone on too long\n\n33:03.840 --> 33:08.800\nIt's got too much momentum and there was was it you ma'am. Sorry. I have asked burgers, but yeah, okay\n\n33:08.800 --> 33:16.960\nYou you you stood up and identified yourself and you said you spoke very eloquently as an individual as an individual would you said like okay, so\n\n33:18.720 --> 33:21.240\nThis is a stereotype that proceeds, you know\n\n33:21.240 --> 33:26.960\na straight people like like constantly look at gay people and say\n\n33:27.840 --> 33:32.160\nThere's there's a dude and a girl within every gay relationship\n\n33:32.160 --> 33:37.520\nAnd it's probably enough time is passed to put put it, you know, hold that that\n\n33:37.960 --> 33:41.800\nThe puppy of that misconceptions face into its own urine, but\n\n33:42.520 --> 33:44.880\nBut that's what you're doing. It's like\n\n33:44.880 --> 33:51.640\nIt's over it doesn't I mean like there was a kind of a thing happened the last\n\n33:52.280 --> 33:56.640\nWeek that was that I don't think has ever happened at Harmon's. Yeah, somebody got booed\n\n33:57.360 --> 34:03.920\nChanted down happens so suddenly to it's like a switch was thrown and all of a sudden was that what they were really chanting was let it go\n\n34:04.240 --> 34:06.560\nBecause they wanted her to stop talking\n\n34:07.360 --> 34:09.360\nThey weren't they weren't saying\n\n34:09.360 --> 34:15.680\nUh, think differently. They were going let it go. Was that what's your take on the whole thing? How do you feel it all went down?\n\n34:17.720 --> 34:19.720\nLet it go\n\n34:21.360 --> 34:25.600\nDo you want to come up should we get it get her up and let her say a couple words there? Hey, yeah, let's have that come up\n\n34:30.280 --> 34:35.840\nAs a talk about her this is a little keg of dynamite. Hello, is that\n\n34:35.840 --> 34:46.920\nSo what the thing that you were going to say was anecdotal things about how you you well whatever say was say what you were gonna say\n\n34:49.440 --> 34:56.560\nWait, which part well when they remember when the audience started going boo, let it go. Let it go. Stop talking\n\n34:56.600 --> 35:02.600\nWe hate you stop talking. I guess I guess the only point I wanted to get across was\n\n35:02.600 --> 35:04.360\nUm\n\n35:04.360 --> 35:06.360\nRegardless of where you come from\n\n35:06.360 --> 35:08.360\nnothing like that\n\n35:08.880 --> 35:16.200\nYou know, it's funny about weddings because I actually did work at a wedding shop and I I saw some people are a little bit more\n\n35:16.400 --> 35:18.400\nabout weddings as far as a\n\n35:18.800 --> 35:23.320\nSome people are just let they let one person do more work than the other\n\n35:23.800 --> 35:28.520\nRegardless of who it is, you know, that kind of thing. That's not that's not a gender thing\n\n35:28.520 --> 35:34.120\nPersonality type that was a more of the ideal topic. That's ideally. That's what I wanted to say\n\n35:35.440 --> 35:38.040\nWe I think we went over that but how do you feel emotionally after that?\n\n35:38.040 --> 35:39.760\nI was that was that a was that a weird experience for you?\n\n35:39.760 --> 35:41.320\nNo, this was like the best week of my life\n\n35:41.320 --> 35:47.240\nBut not because of like what happened here just other things that in my life was like this has been a really great week for me\n\n35:47.240 --> 35:51.760\nBut I I tend not to let things bother me at all. I'm not that kind of person. Okay. Yeah\n\n35:52.240 --> 35:55.520\nWell, I think people resented that a little bit. That's what I truly think\n\n35:55.520 --> 36:01.880\nI want to say this like I think that like clearly because I listen to the thing and I listen to the podcast when I drive into work\n\n36:01.880 --> 36:05.400\nAnd I'm listening to it and I'm like, oh, that's I do feel I have remorse\n\n36:05.400 --> 36:09.880\nI feel I feel bad if I did offend anyone obviously. Yeah, everybody that talks into a microphone\n\n36:09.880 --> 36:12.560\nLike can look listen to it afterwards and go oh shit\n\n36:12.560 --> 36:19.920\nI wish I could have taken like that Peter Parker like 45 minutes of like bullet time to think exactly about what to say\n\n36:19.920 --> 36:23.720\nAnd we all embarrass ourselves a leg leg leg leg, but but I think that you\n\n36:23.720 --> 36:25.720\nOkay\n\n36:26.480 --> 36:28.480\nThank you. Thank you, Lizette\n\n36:29.200 --> 36:33.360\nHere's the thing that the whole thing that kind of avalanche it on me that night\n\n36:33.360 --> 36:35.200\nIt was like it was no time to talk about it at all\n\n36:35.200 --> 36:40.360\nBut I what I wanted to say to the planet at that moment was\n\n36:42.040 --> 36:47.240\nWe have gone so far with like it's okay to be black it's okay to be gay\n\n36:47.240 --> 36:51.520\nIt's okay to be in a wheelchair. It's okay to have one arm. It's okay to have three arms\n\n36:51.520 --> 36:54.080\nIt's okay to have purple hair. It's okay to have six eyes\n\n36:54.080 --> 36:55.680\nIt's okay to have one eye\n\n36:55.680 --> 37:00.480\nLike we are trying as hard as we can to keep each other from keeping each other down\n\n37:00.480 --> 37:02.600\nIt's okay to wear a notebook around here. Yes\n\n37:04.040 --> 37:10.320\nThe only thing that was up like is there going to come a point where it's okay to be ignorant\n\n37:10.840 --> 37:12.600\nWhere it's okay\n\n37:12.600 --> 37:14.600\nto be shitty\n\n37:14.600 --> 37:20.640\nBecause if we don't if we don't make that bridge we ain't got no hope man\n\n37:21.640 --> 37:25.600\nThere's a word for groups of people who know it's okay to have six eyes\n\n37:26.800 --> 37:28.800\nThey're called six-eyed people\n\n37:29.880 --> 37:36.520\nThey exist in a fucking ghetto of six-eyed people if they don't like like like our way like this movement that we have\n\n37:36.640 --> 37:42.760\nThat's like like like let's all realize that our sexual preference our race our height our hair color\n\n37:42.760 --> 37:48.080\nEverything doesn't matter. We're we're we've gotten to the point where we are storming the Bastille\n\n37:48.600 --> 37:51.080\nLike every time Bill Maher opens his mouth\n\n37:52.560 --> 37:59.920\nAll I all I hear is the fucking hammers cocking on the red states like like like shotguns like\n\n38:00.200 --> 38:06.400\nThey're like is there a way to reach out to these people and hug them and like like isn't there a way to make ourselves attractive?\n\n38:07.080 --> 38:10.360\nto people that are bummed out that are\n\n38:10.360 --> 38:14.160\nApprehensive about becoming part of the Borg cube\n\n38:16.600 --> 38:23.120\nAre we are we just gonna shout at everybody that isn't as open-minded as us is that was is that what we're gonna do?\n\n38:23.680 --> 38:27.920\nIs that how we're going to achieve revolution? Are we just going to shout at people?\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:31.000\nNo, we shouldn't\n\n38:31.720 --> 38:33.720\nRight so so so when you\n\n38:34.160 --> 38:39.160\nWhen you run into someone on the street, and they go like I think black people aren't as tall as white people\n\n38:39.160 --> 38:41.160\nAre you are you going to?\n\n38:41.880 --> 38:45.520\nWhat are you gonna do to that guy? Are you gonna hit him in the head with a brick?\n\n38:48.800 --> 38:53.560\nI would give I would give him a hug or something and be like no was that would give him a hug. No\n\n38:54.240 --> 39:01.120\nNo, you would know it would be more like no no no no black people are just as tall as white people I\n\n39:01.120 --> 39:08.280\nJust want to know you just compare black people to six-eyed people and ignorant people\n\n39:09.040 --> 39:11.040\nYou put them in the same category of\n\n39:11.560 --> 39:17.880\nDisability no, I didn't you said it's okay to be black. It's okay to be gay. It's okay to be a mutant\n\n39:21.360 --> 39:24.480\nYou gave black people the right to be okay about being crazy\n\n39:24.480 --> 39:25.640\nI\n\n39:25.640 --> 39:27.000\nDon't know what you're talking about\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:34.280\nBut I know one thing that every every thing that we talk about we're trying to move forward into a Roddenberry universe\n\n39:34.280 --> 39:40.440\nWhere there is no such thing as hierarchy and the way we're trying to accomplish it is\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:47.480\nWe're trying to use the tools that the old world used. We are trying to march on\n\n39:47.480 --> 39:56.880\nWashington we are trying to show people that mob rule like works that those were the tools that they showed us\n\n39:57.480 --> 39:59.840\nAre effective though that was the justification\n\n40:00.400 --> 40:05.520\nDo you really think that we're gonna enter a world where there's so many?\n\n40:06.280 --> 40:13.160\nTransgendered 16 year olds that they finally gonna vote in Congress or do you think the more objective pragmatic\n\n40:13.160 --> 40:19.180\nPerpa Jigol should be for us to arrive at a point of consciousness where we stop judging people for who they\n\n40:19.680 --> 40:24.940\nThese these things that have nothing to do with with the streets getting cleaned and the and the economy being\n\n40:25.840 --> 40:33.680\nBalance it's it that we weird they have they have trapped us in this rats maze like they tell us that oh, oh, yeah\n\n40:33.680 --> 40:40.120\nYou I'm sure you'd love a handicap ramp at the YMCA you go get six more cripples and talk to me later\n\n40:40.120 --> 40:43.200\nIt's bullshit. It's fucking horseshit\n\n40:43.840 --> 40:50.640\nCapitalism is wrong because a dollar ends up being worth more than some human being that you're stepping over\n\n40:50.640 --> 40:55.880\nThat's it a crowd if a crowd of a group full of people intelligent people like this audience here decided\n\n40:55.880 --> 41:00.280\nThey don't like what's going on on stage. They have every right to go boo. Fuck that like no, they don't no\n\n41:00.280 --> 41:04.840\nThey don't they have every right to do it, but I think they're assholes\n\n41:05.400 --> 41:07.400\nThat's bullying\n\n41:07.400 --> 41:15.680\nOh, I'm used to that. I've been bullied my whole life. It's I think that a crowd that booze is like\n\n41:15.680 --> 41:19.280\nIt's taking part in something. I don't think people weren't linking arms and I said cool\n\n41:19.280 --> 41:23.040\nCan we can we pillory her can we can we can we can we can we burn her at the stake like it wasn't that\n\n41:23.040 --> 41:26.640\nIt was like fucking I'm using that you actually you should be pillory. Yeah. No, okay\n\n41:27.800 --> 41:29.640\nkinky\n\n41:29.640 --> 41:32.560\nNobody nobody here was being a villain out in the audience\n\n41:32.560 --> 41:35.680\nThey all agreed as one and they didn't like it was what was for sale on stage\n\n41:35.680 --> 41:41.280\nI think that's that's healthy and fine, right? It's healthy and fine to take part in a large group of people\n\n41:42.040 --> 41:44.360\nSaying the same thing in unison chanting it at people\n\n41:44.960 --> 41:50.520\nIf everybody is an agreement people were going along with that swept up in the commotion and the emotion of a mob\n\n41:50.520 --> 41:55.200\nAnd that's not okay, but it wasn't I think there were you know 15 20 people in the audience going like now\n\n41:55.200 --> 42:00.640\nI don't like it like fucking move it along. I think we're not gonna get anything ever done here\n\n42:00.640 --> 42:05.800\nBut you can't you can't you can't mandate that this audience doesn't have the right to ever go fuck. No, you're right. You're right\n\n42:05.800 --> 42:10.200\nI can't mandate that you're right. I can't say you don't have the right to boo\n\n42:10.200 --> 42:11.920\nThere are things that you could do on the stage\n\n42:11.920 --> 42:14.880\nIt could absolutely alienate and bum everybody out in this room\n\n42:14.880 --> 42:18.840\nThere's things that you could go too far and you could piss people off and they have the freedom on the right to say\n\n42:18.840 --> 42:23.280\nThat's fucking bullshit and let's throw shit at that guy like that's that's that's that's totally\n\n42:23.800 --> 42:29.880\nFair and I think I think what happened was weird last week because all of a sudden as one that everyone just like turned on you\n\n42:29.880 --> 42:34.680\nWas that it was it was it was like it was a strange like like dynamic that just went boom and all of a sudden you were\n\n42:35.240 --> 42:41.240\nLike like I said I admit I had said something that was a little you know that it was not appropriate\n\n42:41.240 --> 42:46.520\nI should have revised my speech and say it reflect my opinion in a way that was more diplomatic\n\n42:47.160 --> 42:49.840\nObviously and I like I said I never meant to offend anyone\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:52.760\nBut had I just been given five more seconds\n\n42:52.760 --> 42:57.320\nI would have explained myself and I would have been like actually what I meant to say was and it would have been fine\n\n42:57.320 --> 43:01.720\nNo, I don't I thought I think I don't think you would have I think you would have upset them work\n\n43:02.720 --> 43:07.760\nThat's the thing like it's about the it's about the booing and the chanting and all that shit\n\n43:07.760 --> 43:08.680\nThat's all I mean\n\n43:08.680 --> 43:14.480\nI don't like like this hero worship this idea that we have to find the person that says the right things\n\n43:14.480 --> 43:18.800\nWe have to lift them up like it just yeah, I mean if it makes anyone feel better\n\n43:18.800 --> 43:23.360\nI have never said the right thing ever in my life and they're I'm probably never will so that only makes me human\n\n43:23.360 --> 43:29.920\nBut I hope I hope I hope you feel my pain. Let's feel as it's pain. Thank you for coming up\n\n43:34.120 --> 43:36.120\nLet's chant her off stage everybody\n\n43:36.120 --> 43:38.120\nOh\n\n43:48.680 --> 43:52.240\nWhat's that guy's name Greg all right cuz I wrote it down\n\n43:53.800 --> 43:55.800\nAll right, let's bring Spencer up\n\n43:55.800 --> 44:07.320\nHello Spencer the inventor of I Harmon or a chest note so whatever you want to call it\n\n44:07.680 --> 44:09.680\nDo you have a name for your invention Spencer? I\n\n44:10.360 --> 44:15.600\nIf I were to like write in permanent marker on the cover, I would write Harmon's brain\n\n44:17.160 --> 44:19.200\nHarmon's right. Yeah, just cuz that's what it does\n\n44:19.200 --> 44:22.800\nBut if you wanted to market this invention to other people that I wouldn't you wouldn't\n\n44:22.800 --> 44:26.000\nmarketing's just lies\n\n44:29.040 --> 44:34.480\nSpeaking of marketing I would want to point out that the I Harmon mock mock three is\n\n44:35.440 --> 44:39.240\nEquipped with paracord which can support up to three hundred thirty pounds\n\n44:39.360 --> 44:44.240\nSo that can save someone's life or maybe you know strangle a foe. Yeah\n\n44:45.520 --> 44:50.720\nLike the idea that if I die someone can take it off my neck and they can know what I was working on when I yeah\n\n44:50.720 --> 44:55.040\nBut also if somebody wanted to murder Dan, he's already got it. I didn't want yeah, he's already got it\n\n44:55.040 --> 44:57.040\nHe's already got a strangled\n\n44:58.520 --> 45:02.920\nSeems counterintuitive to get my my employer killed. There's a built-in\n\n45:03.240 --> 45:09.120\nThere's a built-in drunken meter which the subreddit has requested because you can see from my head handwriting\n\n45:09.280 --> 45:14.720\nThe like at the bottom of this page. It just says in this weird serial killer scrawl. I do what I want\n\n45:14.720 --> 45:16.720\nI\n\n45:19.560 --> 45:22.400\nIt starts at the top with like cat litter\n\n45:23.240 --> 45:27.360\nDog food and then at the bottom. It says I do what I want you can barely read it\n\n45:28.160 --> 45:30.160\nGreg\n\n45:31.040 --> 45:36.120\nThat's something that that's something that a phone can't store is the the manic energy\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:40.680\nSo you feel that the the the convenience of having this always around your neck out\n\n45:40.680 --> 45:45.280\nOutweighs the awkwardness of having that around your neck at all times. No, I'll get through it\n\n45:45.280 --> 45:48.840\nI mean, I there's an awkward. I don't think I am I don't think this lasts very long\n\n45:48.840 --> 45:52.360\nMy prediction is you don't stick to this for very long. I'm not gonna let that affect how long I wear\n\n45:52.880 --> 45:57.520\nNor should I'm just saying I put it out there. I don't think you would be affected by this\n\n45:57.520 --> 46:02.520\nI think that this this is a thing. It's a passing fancy broken through a threshold, you know, like what's his name?\n\n46:02.520 --> 46:09.520\nA star star counter. What's his name? Stephen Hawking? Oh?\n\n46:13.080 --> 46:17.360\nHe was a heavy drinker party guy like I saw a documentary about him like he\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:21.320\nFucked around like he was he was smart and he had a good time\n\n46:21.320 --> 46:25.840\nAnd then one day he was like hanging out like I'll see you later. I'm gonna smash that bus\n\n46:25.840 --> 46:28.240\nI'll see you and then and then he like\n\n46:28.240 --> 46:33.560\nTumbled down some stairs and went to a doctor and they said you got you got a disease\n\n46:33.560 --> 46:39.400\nYou're you're a balloon and you're gonna deflate and you're in the clocks ticking and he went\n\n46:39.400 --> 46:41.440\nI got a I got some shit to do now\n\n46:41.440 --> 46:47.800\nHe was very young when he got that wake-up call and he obviously all of humanity has benefited from him doing that\n\n46:47.800 --> 46:54.960\nI'm just a 40 year old hack like I just I just want to like I clearly I could feel my brain has gotten to a point where\n\n46:54.960 --> 47:01.760\nI'm not thinking anything. It's gonna help anybody anymore. I just it's gonna like like like you know like the guy in\n\n47:02.280 --> 47:05.760\nWearing a notebook around your neck certainly sends off a message of you give up\n\n47:07.440 --> 47:11.520\nThere's a surrender a kind of white flag being waved. Yeah, exactly\n\n47:11.520 --> 47:15.840\nSo wait flagged every 25 year old writer like come up to me and go like like what should I do?\n\n47:19.640 --> 47:21.640\nMy brain don't work no more\n\n47:21.640 --> 47:27.200\nYeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna yeah, I'm gonna go out like practical\n\n47:27.720 --> 47:33.600\nLike if I could turn my shoe into a phone, I'd do it. I don't know if that was practical. Yeah, is that practical?\n\n47:34.600 --> 47:36.600\nSpencer, I don't know yet\n\n47:37.440 --> 47:43.440\nI'm gonna find out I came to you with this idea. This was here. I didn't you helped me with this. Oh, yeah, I\n\n47:46.120 --> 47:48.400\nMean, I don't know what else to say about it\n\n47:48.400 --> 47:54.200\nIt's why don't you have one of these because I have well, I have a green moleskin thing that I have\n\n47:55.040 --> 47:57.760\nSo I have one. I just don't have it around my neck\n\n47:58.840 --> 48:04.040\nThe important thing about this is it's fast. Yeah, no, that's I designed it that way\n\n48:08.320 --> 48:14.680\nThat was that was literally I guess I'm just more of a of a superficial fashion conscious guy\n\n48:14.680 --> 48:19.440\nYou're behind me right on this, right? Yeah, I think it's probably one of the best methods\n\n48:19.440 --> 48:22.280\nYou could do it because it was like you're illustrating with your phone\n\n48:22.280 --> 48:27.720\nI'd say, you know, it's kind of like a camera and that you know your note taking device is the one you have with you\n\n48:27.720 --> 48:32.640\nSo that's always with you. Yeah, but you know, it's it's hard to have your phone out all the time\n\n48:32.640 --> 48:36.680\nBut I'd say the phone's the best, but if you're not gonna use your phone, that's better\n\n48:36.680 --> 48:41.800\nIt seems a bit like a social barrier though. Maybe that's maybe maybe that's part of your subconscious\n\n48:41.800 --> 48:45.100\nLike a charm of this. It's an icebreaker. I'm hanging out with you\n\n48:46.600 --> 48:52.840\nI'm hanging out with me now. It's Benicio del Toro gonna be like, oh, it's done harm it. Oh, like, like, oh\n\n48:54.120 --> 48:59.080\nOh god, the friendship that never ended. Like, like, come on. I got you and I got a rock\n\n49:00.600 --> 49:02.360\nI got a dog\n\n49:02.360 --> 49:04.360\nI hang out with you and now you got a big\n\n49:05.320 --> 49:11.080\nHey, yeah, can you handle it and what we were we were having drinks earlier on you spent half the time looking at your little notepad\n\n49:11.080 --> 49:13.640\nIt's just it's just a toy that you can not let make eye contact\n\n49:14.280 --> 49:18.680\nDown. Yeah. Yeah, just like no sometimes you weren't you just looking through your thing\n\n49:19.000 --> 49:25.000\nIt's just a way to make less eye contact. So you're enforcing your your lack of ability to connect with people\n\n49:25.240 --> 49:29.560\nHe's doing it right now. He's doing it right now. I'm looking up stuff that I was writing down when you're talking\n\n49:29.640 --> 49:33.880\nYou're just getting you're just you're just shy. You're just you're you're terrible about being with other people\n\n49:34.920 --> 49:37.640\nYou're you're terrible about being with me. Thank you\n\n49:37.640 --> 49:39.640\nYou\n\n49:39.800 --> 49:41.080\nHey\n\n49:41.080 --> 49:47.080\nWhere do you get those notepads Jeff these ones? Yeah, um, look at that. That's I went to two staples\n\n49:47.080 --> 49:50.440\nThey didn't have anything so I got that one and I cut it with a paper cutter\n\n49:53.560 --> 49:56.440\nThese are from duane. I don't know do any paper\n\n49:57.560 --> 50:02.040\nAnd I there's a gift shop and sort of like I'll buy you a pack that they're okay. That's awesome. They're good\n\n50:02.040 --> 50:08.600\nI just want to do a quick quick quick lightning at Harmontown like quick guest spot. Okay. We just do this real quick\n\n50:08.600 --> 50:10.600\nOh, yeah, can I bring up my neighbors?\n\n50:11.160 --> 50:12.520\nabsolutely\n\n50:12.520 --> 50:14.520\nDan and Beth Bootson\n\n50:14.520 --> 50:16.520\nBootsons\n\n50:20.440 --> 50:22.040\nCan I put\n\n50:22.040 --> 50:27.080\nUnless unless you guys don't want to come up just want to do a quick. Hello. Hello, Beth\n\n50:27.080 --> 50:29.080\nYeah\n\n50:31.160 --> 50:34.200\nDan and Beth Bootson their last name is\n\n50:37.160 --> 50:42.600\nAre these are these the same Bootsons that you uh, that you said disparaging things about in the previous podcast\n\n50:42.760 --> 50:45.400\nIt's a disparaging. Thanks. We went we went to their uh\n\n50:46.200 --> 50:52.760\nBackyard party and then we came here and then uh, yeah, I talked for for Harmontown aficionados\n\n50:52.760 --> 50:56.920\nUh, Beth Bootson is the person I referred to as the tumor lady\n\n51:00.440 --> 51:05.240\nWho had a like you took out your iphone and you had an x-ray of your head\n\n51:05.880 --> 51:10.280\nLike a profile of it and truly am I exaggerating it was the size of a\n\n51:10.920 --> 51:12.840\nbeyond the golf ball\n\n51:12.840 --> 51:16.920\nwell, my I had a brain tumor last year and um\n\n51:16.920 --> 51:25.640\nInitially how it I found out I had a brain tumor was that um, I swim laps at uh in pasadena at the rose ball aquatic center\n\n51:26.040 --> 51:28.040\nAnd I had a seizure in the pool\n\n51:28.120 --> 51:33.560\nAnd what does the seizure feel like like or what happens? It was the very first time I'd ever had one\n\n51:33.560 --> 51:37.400\nIt's the only one I've ever had but um, I can remember\n\n51:38.360 --> 51:43.720\nUm, and it happened so quickly it almost feels like you're passing out except I can remember that\n\n51:43.720 --> 51:47.480\nI felt like um, like I didn't have control of my limbs\n\n51:48.280 --> 51:50.280\nand um, and luckily I was\n\n51:51.640 --> 51:56.920\nSwimming on my back in the water and um, there was the lifeguard exchange\n\n51:57.000 --> 52:01.720\nWhich is apparently the most dangerous time for a lifeguard to even see somebody drowning\n\n52:02.200 --> 52:07.880\nUm, but apparently what do you mean like that was shift change or yes? Yes, because they're talking to each other\n\n52:07.880 --> 52:13.880\nThey're just hanging out. Yeah, they're hanging out. It's hard to be a left good. Yes, and\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:16.040\nBored Sam\n\n52:16.040 --> 52:21.880\nAnd there was a lifeguard that all the other lifeguards made fun of because he was the overly diligent one\n\n52:22.200 --> 52:24.200\nAnd he's the one who happened to see me\n\n52:24.600 --> 52:26.600\nDrowning flailing in the pool\n\n52:26.600 --> 52:34.200\nYes, um, and it's in the it's in the competitive pool where all the swimmers that swim there are very very good swimmers\n\n52:34.200 --> 52:38.760\nSo at first they thought we have a winner pay attention to the swimmers because everybody knows how to swim\n\n52:38.840 --> 52:41.880\nIt's not like guarding the little kiddie pool or something like that\n\n52:42.520 --> 52:45.080\nSo I had my seizure and luckily they\n\n52:45.800 --> 52:47.800\num, saw me and\n\n52:48.200 --> 52:53.800\nThey jumped in and or one of the guys jumped in well, they were all there, but one of them\n\n52:54.440 --> 52:56.440\nuh, alarmed everybody else\n\n52:56.760 --> 53:00.120\num, the other one another one jumped in and um,\n\n53:00.120 --> 53:04.600\num, basically pushed my head up out of the water and let me finish having my seizure Jesus\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:08.040\nYes, and then after they got underneath you and they're like she's having a seizure\n\n53:08.120 --> 53:10.280\nThey just lifted you like don't just my head\n\n53:10.840 --> 53:12.840\nSo they just lifted my head up out of the water\n\n53:12.920 --> 53:18.760\nSo I wouldn't take in any water and they let me finish having my seizure and uh, then they pulled me to the end\n\n53:19.240 --> 53:25.160\nThey had already called the ambulance and um, I was rushed to Huntington hospital, which is about four minutes away\n\n53:25.880 --> 53:27.880\nand, um\n\n53:27.880 --> 53:29.880\nWhen I was there, I was\n\n53:30.520 --> 53:36.040\nI had already come to in the ambulance and um, I felt very lucky because you know how you have to\n\n53:36.520 --> 53:43.960\nAlways wait for somebody to take care of you when you're in the ER. I didn't have any weight at all and um, the\n\n53:45.000 --> 53:47.000\nuh, doctor walked in\n\n53:47.080 --> 53:50.040\nAnd he told me that it was my lucky day\n\n53:50.680 --> 53:55.720\nBecause I had the chief neurologist on call that day and that was him\n\n53:55.720 --> 53:58.440\nLike the Native Native American guy, right? Yes. Yeah\n\n53:59.320 --> 54:06.120\nHe says I'm I'm Dr. Kate in and I'm your and I'm the chief neurologist here and I'm gonna take care of me big chief neurologist\n\n54:09.560 --> 54:11.560\nI didn't even know that's what you do\n\n54:11.960 --> 54:16.040\nI thought you were just making it more dramatic. I thought I didn't know he was doing a pun. I thought like\n\n54:16.680 --> 54:20.440\nI thought he was making it more dramatic like it was like, uh, I think I did\n\n54:20.920 --> 54:21.960\nso\n\n54:21.960 --> 54:26.680\nSo, uh, god damn it. I don't the brain tumor was very big and right now\n\n54:26.680 --> 54:29.720\nI have a hole in my brain the size of a meatball\n\n54:30.280 --> 54:32.760\nAnd that's the hole a size of a delicious meatball\n\n54:33.480 --> 54:37.960\nLike that's some bullshit meatball that like from from chef Boyardy like a fucking mama\n\n54:38.760 --> 54:43.240\nYeah, are we talking are we talking italians? Are we talking meatballs? We talking like Ikea, swedish?\n\n54:43.800 --> 54:48.200\nLike bigger than a golf ball little Dom's. Oh, that's big. That's like that's like a wiffle ball size\n\n54:48.200 --> 54:53.640\nAnd that was I mean he took out basically about half of the tumor so half of the tumor is still in there\n\n54:53.800 --> 54:55.800\nWait, just hanging out there?\n\n54:55.880 --> 54:59.400\nYeah, it's in there and he didn't want to go any further\n\n55:00.120 --> 55:04.760\nHe didn't want to take any more out because he was a he didn't want me to end up in a wheelchair or\n\n55:05.800 --> 55:09.320\nTalking with a drool. So is it just sitting in there? You have to go back every year?\n\n55:09.320 --> 55:13.000\nWell, I went he said he goes we're going to take care of the rest of it with cyber knife\n\n55:14.120 --> 55:16.120\nCyber knife radiation treatment\n\n55:16.120 --> 55:21.720\nWait, uh, can they make that sound a little more ominous? Yeah, I know a little more like gi joe\n\n55:22.520 --> 55:24.520\nBring out cyber knife\n\n55:28.040 --> 55:30.040\nA weeks later\n\n55:30.360 --> 55:34.040\nProbably about a month later after I'd already had the surgery and stuff they took me and\n\n55:34.920 --> 55:38.360\nIt's a whole procedure where there's like this big star wars gun\n\n55:39.480 --> 55:43.720\nThat's in this room and they have already made a mask of your face\n\n55:43.720 --> 55:50.840\nAnd they basically screwed, you know, I'm in the mask and they screwed me to the table and the table's kind of moving like this and this big\n\n55:51.640 --> 55:55.720\nStar wars gun. They have to custom make the mask of your face. Yeah. Yeah, we still have it\n\n55:55.720 --> 56:02.040\nIt's like a gauze except they have some liquid on it and um, because it's that precise like like so it has to be a\n\n56:02.680 --> 56:09.400\nYes, it matches my face exactly to hold you to hold you in place or they yeah, they don't want my head moving\n\n56:09.400 --> 56:13.800\nRight while cyber knife has given you the business. Yeah, so I'm there for a whole hour\n\n56:14.200 --> 56:17.160\nI pictured you strapped to a table like james bond and goldfinger\n\n56:19.800 --> 56:21.800\nYou expect me to talk chief neurologist\n\n56:24.920 --> 56:26.920\nI showed him the uh\n\n56:26.920 --> 56:34.840\nI mean it's a cartoon. It's not a video. No, it's a photos of it is a car. It's like a cartoon. It's like the MRI photos\n\n56:34.840 --> 56:41.960\nIt's it's it's a human skull like for it for viewed from the side and there is a larger than golf ball\n\n56:42.600 --> 56:44.600\nperfectly round\n\n56:44.600 --> 56:47.640\nThat's what's amazing is that like this cancer\n\n56:48.520 --> 56:53.080\nStill adheres to this like mine was I had a very very rare kind mine was non-cancerous\n\n56:53.560 --> 56:58.840\nBut what does that mean as well? I mean that thing of it is is you could have a brain tumor that's cancerous\n\n56:59.480 --> 57:02.920\nAnd you might be fine. It depending on what stage they catch it in\n\n57:02.920 --> 57:09.400\nHow can a tumor not be cancerous? I but you could have one that's non-cancerous and depending on where that brain tumor is\n\n57:09.720 --> 57:11.720\nIf it's right here by your brain stem\n\n57:12.200 --> 57:17.640\nHere you could be dead, right? So it whether it's cancerous or non-cancerous it it\n\n57:17.880 --> 57:22.040\nUm, doesn't decide whether or not you're going to live. So you're just this lucky person that just had this jiggy\n\n57:22.280 --> 57:26.680\nI had a very very rare type of link from outer space. It was so big\n\n57:26.760 --> 57:30.520\nYeah, they just scooped it out with a melon baller left some of it behind\n\n57:30.520 --> 57:36.120\nYeah, and it's still in there. What did they replace that space with or they just leave a cavity in there?\n\n57:36.280 --> 57:38.280\nNo, it just feels it was lived in and then\n\n57:43.640 --> 57:49.080\nBut they said eventually that um all the little veins and cap cap, you know things that um\n\n57:50.440 --> 57:52.440\nCapillaries will\n\n57:52.520 --> 57:53.320\num\n\n57:53.320 --> 57:58.840\nMake connections again, and like half my body was very weak. I was in a walker\n\n57:58.840 --> 58:01.960\nI couldn't walk for about a full month without\n\n58:02.680 --> 58:04.600\num\n\n58:04.600 --> 58:10.280\nFalling or perhaps having a seizure. So I had uh, I was in a walker for about a month and then I eventually grew\n\n58:11.080 --> 58:16.600\nGraduated to a king. Did they ever tell you steroids? Did they retell you you might now walk again and blah blah blah?\n\n58:16.680 --> 58:23.880\nYou know they're always worried about that, but um, luckily I have a very very good surgeon and um, the other thing\n\n58:24.600 --> 58:26.600\nUm, what was I going to say?\n\n58:26.600 --> 58:32.520\nIt's okay. You have a hole in here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you have the ultimate out. Yeah\n\n58:37.480 --> 58:39.480\nYou should have a notepad around your neck\n\n58:40.680 --> 58:43.560\nHave you ever used it to win arguments really be honest?\n\n58:43.800 --> 58:47.320\nYou know what I was going to say it was because you know when they um\n\n58:48.520 --> 58:53.080\nWhen they said when they were going to do the surgery what they do is they usually shave your whole head\n\n58:53.080 --> 58:58.040\nBut my mom and my sister were very worried about my hair. They said, you know, can't you just leave some of it?\n\n58:58.040 --> 59:00.040\nMaybe put a you know flap or something like that\n\n59:00.440 --> 59:02.440\nSee if the strange thing to be worried about\n\n59:03.080 --> 59:05.080\nShe has such nice hair\n\n59:07.560 --> 59:12.920\nAnd what my doctor was very considered he just shaved me up here on top and then they um\n\n59:13.640 --> 59:16.680\nYou know cut open the scalp and roll that back\n\n59:17.640 --> 59:21.800\nYeah, and then and then they drill he they drill into the skull\n\n59:21.800 --> 59:25.080\nOh, and you know he wanted to put a metal plate in my head\n\n59:25.400 --> 59:28.600\nAnd I remember him telling me what that he was going to do that and I said\n\n59:28.840 --> 59:33.160\nI said, do you have to put the metal plate in? He says yes, because I might have to go in over and over again\n\n59:33.560 --> 59:37.160\nI said, well, just can't you just put my skull back and then if you have to go in a second time\n\n59:37.240 --> 59:40.840\nThen you'll put the metal plate in and he said, okay. I can do that\n\n59:41.160 --> 59:43.160\nWell, you can just\n\n59:44.840 --> 59:50.680\nSo I do have my skull. I just pictured myself going through the airport and that beeper going up\n\n59:50.680 --> 59:52.680\nOh, how embarrassing\n\n59:53.960 --> 59:56.760\nAnd also I wondered if it would affect my hair\n\n59:56.840 --> 01:00:02.600\nBut that would be I would I would love that I would go like it would start beeping. I go. I had a fucking tumor\n\n01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:07.560\nI know it's saunter through throw shoes at them\n\n01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:11.160\nHow many tumors have you had mother fucker?\n\n01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:16.360\nWell, you know what and the thing of it is is I actually consider this\n\n01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.920\nOne of the best things that has ever happened to me\n\n01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:21.480\nbecause I feel like I've had\n\n01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:28.680\nSo many gifts that have come from having the brain tumor and one of them is that\n\n01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:33.320\nI have clarity as to what's important in life and what's not\n\n01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.120\nand I also\n\n01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.400\nWhat is I mean\n\n01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:44.680\nClarity like like that's that's the thing I wanted to talk to you about because we had as I told you that\n\n01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:51.240\nWe have seek up here is an aneurysm survivor. He's got a time bomb in his head as he like like he talks about it like\n\n01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:55.000\nWhat is that like what what is\n\n01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:00.840\nWhat is it important about life? He said no spoilers. He said\n\n01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:04.840\nGive more than you take. That's that's his takeaway from the whole thing\n\n01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.880\nGive more than you take from life. Is there anything you can add to that? Sorry. I don't mean to well, you know\n\n01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.280\nI I one of the things that I really\n\n01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:16.440\nUm felt lucky to be able to experience was that um\n\n01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.640\nI got to see all the love and light\n\n01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:26.680\nCome in my way and most people when they have their funeral are not there to actually see that from other people or from god or\n\n01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:31.240\nFrom from so many from everybody, you know, um\n\n01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:37.080\nPeople thinking that you might die neighbors. Um, everybody at work. Um, my family\n\n01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:40.280\nBut all our other neighbors he yeah these guys\n\n01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.560\nUm, I felt like I I remember\n\n01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.320\nUm\n\n01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:51.160\nThinking that um, you know, I didn't really feel bad for me. I felt bad. I was really really quite worried about\n\n01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:55.000\num, my husband and my 13 year old son and\n\n01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:59.640\nMy parents and so you felt like you were going to possibly die\n\n01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:07.000\nRight. I said yes at some point and you handled that in a way that so in that moment when you started my concern was not for me\n\n01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.320\nYou started to feel bad for all the people. Yeah, because I thought, you know, I'll be dead and I won't know the difference\n\n01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:14.920\nMy concern was for all of my um family\n\n01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:20.200\nand um, especially my immediate family and even all my friends because I knew\n\n01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:26.680\nThere were some friends that very care very much for me and I it gives a person the um\n\n01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:30.920\nAnd I got to see how everybody deals with their own mortality\n\n01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.560\nand some people were\n\n01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.960\nvery open to um\n\n01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:39.080\nKind of rushed there to help or wanted to be there for me\n\n01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.040\nSome just kind of holed up in a room\n\n01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:47.000\nAnd those were very good friends and I never heard a word from them and I knew why I wasn't hearing from them\n\n01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:50.760\nYeah, they were scared. I'd probably be one of those. Yeah, I knew they were scared to death\n\n01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:56.920\nBefore I met you I might be one of those before I met seek. I I'm very uncomfortable with sickness and things\n\n01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:02.280\nLike I I I haven't had loved ones, you know, it's like I needed to talk to people that were cool with it\n\n01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:06.680\nYes, and then that's you know, I knew that I had to reach out to them\n\n01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:09.880\nBecause I knew a lot of them thought oh, she's going to end up\n\n01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.440\nYou know with a completely different personality\n\n01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:20.840\nAnd maybe have half of my wits gone so to speak and that would freak them out because it wouldn't be the person they knew\n\n01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.640\num, and\n\n01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.720\nSo I I knew I had to call\n\n01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:29.240\nEverybody and let them know that I was still me\n\n01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.960\num that\n\n01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.160\nBeth\n\n01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:37.000\nYou know the bet they knew was still was still here\n\n01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:41.960\nShe did a lot of kind of work for other people. I was reaching out to other people\n\n01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.360\num, and then I think and I also saw people that\n\n01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:47.960\nwere\n\n01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.960\nI walked into this one restaurant\n\n01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:55.560\nAnd I'm just going to tell the story because it's how it's funny how everybody quiet for one minute\n\n01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:59.000\nLet her talk. It's funny how everybody deals enough out of you, sir\n\n01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.760\nIt's quite enough out of you. It's funny how everybody deals with their own mortality\n\n01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:07.480\nAnd I had walked into this one restaurant, and I'm not going to name the name because I actually love\n\n01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:12.440\nI actually love their pulled pork sandwiches a lot, so I'm not going to mention their name\n\n01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:17.080\nNo, we go to little doms all the time. We mentioned it, but there was a woman in there and I still go there\n\n01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:19.160\nI still go there despite what happened\n\n01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.960\num, I I was in my I walked in there\n\n01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.680\nUm, and I had been in there before and the lady\n\n01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:27.880\nI know she recognizes me\n\n01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:32.360\nAnd um, I had walked in there and with my walker and of course I had a scarf around my head\n\n01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:36.680\nAnd I was probably bloated because of all the medications that I was on. No, you look great\n\n01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.600\nI remember those I remember that\n\n01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.000\nand um\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:49.400\nI walked in and I know she recognized me and because and she's seen my husband before too and um\n\n01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:51.880\nI could tell she was clearly uncomfortable\n\n01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:53.720\nand um\n\n01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.720\nI asked her if I could use the restroom\n\n01:04:55.720 --> 01:05:01.400\nAnd and I had done that before even one before even had this happen to me and they were fine\n\n01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.400\nshe was fine with me and using the restroom before\n\n01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.920\nand uh, the restroom's in the back behind the counter\n\n01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.960\num, and um, I said could I use your restroom?\n\n01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.520\nAnd I could tell she was freaked out by me\n\n01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:15.080\nAnd she says well, it's not um\n\n01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.320\nShe says it's not open to the public\n\n01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:22.040\nAnd I said well, you know before I'd I'd she never had a problem with me using it\n\n01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:27.000\nAnd I said well, I'm not open to yeah, yeah, and I said well, I'm not the public. I'm a customer\n\n01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.080\nSo I want your customer restroom\n\n01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:33.160\nAnd and she said and she kind of just freaked out and then she says\n\n01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.040\nWell, okay, but don't touch anything. What?\n\n01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:41.480\nWait, you you asked to use just the regular ladies room at the at the restaurants or or or\n\n01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:46.600\nRestroom that they had there it was a restroom that they have there that I've you know\n\n01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:49.560\nEvery time I had visited before they didn't she didn't have a problem with it. Okay\n\n01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:53.560\nOkay, so I thought not because you you seem like some sort of damaged\n\n01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:57.560\nYeah, well, I'm obviously damaged now. I think she thought that she might catch what I had\n\n01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.000\nOh, yeah, yeah\n\n01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:05.320\nSo I thought to myself, you know, you get to see all different ways that people deal with something\n\n01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:11.480\nAs you know traumatic as this. Yeah, I mean that's a huge thing like we we have\n\n01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:17.880\nAs a tv writer and producer like, uh, you know, like like 70s Norman Lear. He's an activist\n\n01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:21.240\nHe's going to make sure finally black people and white people are going to like\n\n01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:27.800\nWe're going to use the sitcom to overcome this thing and like now we're living in this maelstrom of like\n\n01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:34.040\nWhat what did you say about gay people and bisexual people and transgender people and we're we're getting through all this stuff\n\n01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:40.760\nAnd but still lingering. I think the biggest thing of all like the giant the giant elephant in the room is like\n\n01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:46.120\nSomebody rolls into a room in a wheelchair and it's like I you have an instinctive reaction\n\n01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:49.720\nYeah, I wish that they weren't in a wheelchair. What are they? Yeah, well, how did they get that way?\n\n01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:52.920\nThat's that's completely different from from everything. It's it's interesting\n\n01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:57.000\nEspecially because she knew me as kind of a vital person beforehand\n\n01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:01.320\nAnd then all of a sudden I walk in and I'm in a walker. She went home at night\n\n01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:04.920\nShe would there was a photo of you and she would god this woman is so vital\n\n01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:11.000\nWell, you know, it's funny when you walked in with a walker. She's like my my world is well, you know\n\n01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.960\nI was so outraged and my husband said well, what is your problem?\n\n01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:17.640\nI and then I told him what she had said and he says oh, well, geez because we won't go there again\n\n01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.640\nI said no, we're going there. I love those\n\n01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000\nI mean there\n\n01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:25.160\nI bet I bet if we had her up here\n\n01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:30.840\nYou know what and and some weird story when we went back afterwards when I had, you know\n\n01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:36.600\nWhen he had healed and I was looking normal again. She just she practically bent over backwards to\n\n01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:40.760\nTo yeah, that's the moral of story be normal\n\n01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:42.760\nYeah\n\n01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.800\nMembership has its privileges\n\n01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:49.000\nThank you.

I've never been happier\n\n01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:54.440\nWhat if you just say a black called you ostentatious a blog? No, I said a blog\n\n01:18:56.360 --> 01:19:01.640\nBut let's talk about why you heard a black. What were you? What was I I mean, I'm if I'm guilty of anything\n\n01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:03.720\nIt's a boring episode\n\n01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:06.760\nOh, it's about to get less boring. Was I dishonest?\n\n01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:13.640\nI do think you were dishonest, but I but maybe you were keeping your honesty private. I don't know. What what are you talking about?\n\n01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:15.720\nWhat do you mean? I mean exactly\n\n01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:21.320\nHad damn it. I can't keep any secrets. I'm a terrible person. I'm sorry. I'm sorry\n\n01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:24.040\nI\n\n01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:31.160\nI mean our friend who begs for compliments the most by being self-deprecating is Spencer. Yeah, who's okay. Yeah\n\n01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:33.160\nAll right\n\n01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:39.480\nAnd I drive and spencer as my friend. It's we create. I don't it's it's fine. Whatever. I'm sorry. I definitely do it\n\n01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:41.880\nWhat I definitely do it\n\n01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:44.600\nRight. Okay. I'm like the worst\n\n01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:49.640\nAll right\n\n01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:51.720\nWhich is why you're friends\n\n01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:57.320\nYeah, I know spencer's the worst about it. He's 23 years old\n\n01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:03.080\nI also did I miss you guys talking about how he's the worst about it because you and I were literally talking about it on the way here\n\n01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:05.320\nI did. Oh, okay\n\n01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:10.920\nAll right. Okay. All right. Okay. Okay in a very loving way because we both love spencer so much\n\n01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:15.000\nBut we were literally saying how much we love spencer and how it annoys us\n\n01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:20.920\nI didn't know dishonesty was defined by not saying everything that you talk about in the car in the way to the show\n\n01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:23.720\nYou're right. Which is why I shouldn't have said anything\n\n01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:30.680\nBut okay, I was just honest spencer. I mentioned that yes, you deflect a lot of compliments. Yeah\n\n01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:34.360\nYeah, I feel like I've gotten better. But you know\n\n01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:36.680\nFuck you\n\n01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:41.080\nSpending the best dungeon master in the world. Okay, you see\n\n01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:45.160\nI don't know. That's not even an objective thing\n\n01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:52.200\nWait, wait that the spencer spencer deflects so many compliments. That's a that's that's an issue. No, I fish\n\n01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:58.200\nIt's not even compliments. It's just for compliments all the time. No, I'm just honestly self deprecating\n\n01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:01.080\nOkay, we'll see that's what I was speaking to earlier. So there you go\n\n01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:06.920\nIs being so why not talk about is being self deprecating necessarily fishing for a compliment is saying no, no, it's not\n\n01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.720\nBut it appears the same way in most contexts\n\n01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.800\nYeah\n\n01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:16.440\nBeing self deprecating is a way to kind of\n\n01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:20.920\nMake at least for me it's been kind of a defense mechanism to if someone is being intact\n\n01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:24.680\nIt's like and aggressive. I do self deprecation tools like yeah, totally agree. You're right\n\n01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.160\nThat's sort of a sort of a defense mechanism. Sure, which is totally which is totally true\n\n01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:37.080\nBut then there are also but there there's also like there are people who are in love who maybe have a lot of things about themselves that they don't like\n\n01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:40.280\nAnd we'll say\n\n01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:45.320\nThat they don't like certain things about themselves, which is like a natural thing. Do I look fat in these genes?\n\n01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:48.680\nBeing the classic\n\n01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:54.360\nBeing the classic being the classic like specifically people in love. You said no not specifically\n\n01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:56.840\nI was I was doing a very bad joke\n\n01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:00.840\nUm\n\n01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:07.000\nNo, there's so everything's great. Did you see that this guy looks just like johnny pemberton and the front row\n\n01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:12.280\nJohnny pemberton. Isn't that crazy? Kind of does. Yeah, there's no need to lash out at people\n\n01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:17.880\nOh, no, I think Johnny pemberton's great looking. He does look like yeah, he does look like johnny\n\n01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:24.200\nYeah, no, no, no, it's fine. I think spent like I now think it's adorable. You spent the whole car right here just bashing spencer\n\n01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:26.760\nNo, no, no, I deserve it\n\n01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:36.520\nI just thought it was ironic. No not bashing him at all. We both are obsessed with him\n\n01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:42.280\nHe works for dad. We both talk to him constantly. I love spencer text him. I don't know about constantly\n\n01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:50.440\nI will text you more talking to people constantly would be weird anyway, but that would be weird that would be weird\n\n01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:52.120\nNo, I\n\n01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:53.720\nIt's it's it's totally fine\n\n01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:57.960\nIt's frustrating because we like you so much and it feels like you were you are constantly putting yourself down\n\n01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:03.560\nBecause it's not even a compliment thing. It's not when there's a compliment. It's no. I know it's even like i'm shitty at putting down a\n\n01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:06.360\nBook and I am no one's shitty at putting that\n\n01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:10.040\nHe is shitty putting books down\n\n01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:12.040\nPodcast listeners wouldn't know\n\n01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:15.320\nYeah, you're gonna hate his house there's books in the ceiling and shit\n\n01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:20.440\nI I regret this entire thing\n\n01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:25.480\nBut i'm just saying it's it's comes from a very loving place. I love\n\n01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:31.720\nYou spencer. I agree with everything you've been saying. Well, and I just accept the loving me part\n\n01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:38.840\nI spencer I love you. Yeah\n\n01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:44.600\nYou got a funny way of showing it car ride lady\n\n01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:52.200\nNo, we were literally whatever it's fine. I'm so sorry. Well, let's play a really uncomfortable dungeon of dragons\n\n01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:54.760\nThat's it\n\n01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:56.760\nSpencer if you would\n\n01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.200\nLast time oh good job\n\n01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:01.640\nHarmon\n\n01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:03.640\ntown\n\n01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:06.200\nOur hero look what you did to him had\n\n01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:09.240\nI'll leave. Oh, no\n\n01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:12.040\nOh\n\n01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:15.080\nYeah, that's what I always wanted\n\n01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:24.280\nNo, it's it's all fine everybody. Can you guys see my nightmare right now? Or is it just me? I don't know why you're so uncomfortable\n\n01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:26.920\nI'm fine. I'm sorry. Go go go anyway\n\n01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:32.600\nLast time on Harmontown our heroes had just felt an ogre and an icy canyon\n\n01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:38.520\nThey led a skeleton army through the gate towards the black keep the fortress of Admiral Darkstar\n\n01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:42.200\nAnd as they marched up the icy slope and climbed out of the canyon\n\n01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:49.480\nThey saw that their skeletons had vanished before them was a mighty army of darkness and as our heroes charge forward at their foes\n\n01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:53.800\nThey plunged through a trap floor or a trap door in the floor\n\n01:24:53.800 --> 01:25:01.080\nSliding down into an icy dungeon separated by walls of ice and facing down doors quark melted through the icy barriers with\n\n01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:07.560\nHis flaming swords reuniting the party. They checked the doors treasure traps gags and giant snowflakes ensued\n\n01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:13.880\nUsing their neutra found treasure they attacked but none so much as Mulraines whisper bow and as she whispered to said bow\n\n01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:19.080\nIt began to glow firing off two arrows destroying the snowflake with massive damage\n\n01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:22.120\nThat sounds like that should whatever\n\n01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:24.120\nThanks a lot erin\n\n01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:29.480\nYou fucked him up. You fucked him up for life. You were away. You broke spencer. You broke him\n\n01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:37.800\nThe way out was a staircase ahead, but Chris de Burghen Mulraine were bleeding heavily from their jagged wounds from the snowflake\n\n01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:39.880\nThey encountered earlier\n\n01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:43.240\nWhat would you do?\n\n01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:45.640\nYay spencer\n\n01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:58.120\nUntil such time as he does something wrong, I would like to invite tyler up to play Chris de Burgh tyler welcome back\n\n01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:02.680\nThe crowd goes mild\n\n01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:05.880\nIt's the inappropriate reaction\n\n01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:12.440\nThat was a tentative welcome to the stage from the audience. I'm terrible. I'm awful dng nobody. Yeah, that's what I've been\n\n01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:18.280\nNo, it there's one thing you can say about you. You're good at dnd. You know what you're doing in the dungeon fishing for compliments\n\n01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:20.600\nYou're great at it. Oh, thanks\n\n01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:26.200\nWe all fish for compliments.

It's very fun\n\n01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:54.760\nI wasn't intentional. Maybe I'm not paying attention. I don't really feel like this is a big issue in my life this whole this whole thing\n\n01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:59.240\nNo, no, no. I don't see why you guys are so bent out of shape about this stuff like it's\n\n01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:03.880\nIt doesn't it doesn't torture me that people like like diminish themselves\n\n01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:08.440\nYou don't constantly have people coming up to you and saying, uh, I guess you don't think I dressed that good\n\n01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:11.400\nIt happens once in a while. So we oh\n\n01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:17.880\nYou think I'm underdressed like yeah, fucking dress up fucking make an effort cocksucker. All right.

Well, the rest of us have a problem with that\n\n01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:26.840\nNo, I I I people want to lower themselves beneath me. It's like I'll do everything\n\n01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:30.120\nI'll do everything I can to lift them back up. I'll say that's like no\n\n01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:35.560\nNo, you need to stand your ground and be there adonis. Okay. Well, no, no, I'm just saying like I feel like\n\n01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:40.440\nI'm not tortured by the people are constantly like every time somebody does something\n\n01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:43.480\nSelf-deprecating. I don't feel like they're trying to pick my pockets\n\n01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:46.120\nLike you like I think you think that they're trying to do that\n\n01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:49.560\nThey're trying to hoodwink you're out smart you into saying something like I don't what do you do?\n\n01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:53.080\nBut in that moment you for real facetiousness aside\n\n01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:56.200\nYou do what do you give them what they want to hear?\n\n01:27:56.200 --> 01:28:02.200\nJeff you probably think that I'm an asshole because I'm because I'm dressed this way right because I'm not wearing a suit\n\n01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:04.680\nUm, if somebody said like I mean\n\n01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:07.400\nWhat are you talking about man?\n\n01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:11.560\nPeople like people will come up and go like, uh, I guess I'm underdressed and I go like, yeah\n\n01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:15.480\nYou know, but that's a joke like I'll make a joke at it. It's like that's what I want to do\n\n01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:19.640\nIt's it's a deflection thing. It's like but some people will just be self-deprecating as a nature\n\n01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:24.920\nThat's what I do kind of sometimes. It's you know, you go into a perceived crowd of people who are cooler\n\n01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:26.040\nX\n\n01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:31.080\nSlash more popular whatever than you and you just kind of have to go in and assume like yeah, they know that I am bad\n\n01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:35.880\nSo I kind of you know make self-deprecating things to kind of put myself on their level\n\n01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:39.960\nIt's not even a thing that I sort of consciously do it just sometimes in conversation. It happens\n\n01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:43.320\nYeah, I think I think people that natural instinct is to come in low\n\n01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:45.400\nEspecially to strangers or people that they maybe like, you know\n\n01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:50.280\nIf you're if you're a fan of a comedy podcast and you meet somebody it's it's or you know people that you know\n\n01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:57.080\nNo Spencer for you know from now you're you're you know mild notoriety from this like people are gonna come in like act weird\n\n01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:01.240\nI think that's just a natural human thing and also it's I don't know. I find it sort of a tactic to be\n\n01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:07.000\nDisarming it's sort of like I'm not coming at you like look how amazing I am. I'm awesome. I'm cool. I'm like whatever. I'm human\n\n01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000\nLook at this. I'm kind of\n\n01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000\nWe're cool, right? Yeah, I mean I just\n\n01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:15.480\nIt certainly happens, but I just it's like you saying it happens to you so much that it's a real\n\n01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:20.680\nProblem for you. Like I don't sense that in my life. I'm not even saying it happens so much as a problem\n\n01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:24.120\nI'm saying it is my alone. Is anyone else can relate to me on that like\n\n01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:29.240\nI'm saying I was crazy up here for like not you know how when you're in an office chair\n\n01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:32.520\nAnd you're like it's got rollers on the bottom and you're at linoleum\n\n01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:36.440\nAnd then you're going into a carpeted area and there's like a little just like a little thing\n\n01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:40.200\nIn a conversation where that happens that I just can't my rolling chair can't\n\n01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:46.280\nIt won't roll past that and someone goes like I guess you think I'm an idiot because I'm a stupid idiot\n\n01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.640\nI guess you think I'm a stupid idiot. I I can't I go\n\n01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:59.960\nThat's certainly a bad conversation that's not that's not a fun conversation to be it's a different thing for dan because people\n\n01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:04.760\nLook up to you. Oh god. This is the worst episode of the worst podcast in the world\n\n01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:11.160\nNo, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry America. I'm so sorry. No, we love it. Dan. It's amazing. We make this lost episode number two\n\n01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:14.200\nI I the first one was when I found out I was going back to community\n\n01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:20.840\nI I I I didn't I just I just I was just a social phenomenon. I thought it happened to everybody like somebody goes like\n\n01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:26.280\nI know I'm so fat. I'm so fat. I'm so fat like it doesn't matter if you think they're fat or thin or whatever\n\n01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:29.320\nIt's just like this sandbag drops on you and you don't\n\n01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:33.400\nI think it is a social phenomenon that people just kind of react to differently like\n\n01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:37.080\nIt may be kind of more of an impediment for you, but I guess for a lot of people\n\n01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:38.600\nI know it's just something that\n\n01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:42.680\nI don't know whether it's being in LA and just sort of these people act like that\n\n01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:46.840\nIt's they try to find it the most disarming way to get into a conversation\n\n01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:49.400\nSo that oftentimes is a conversation starter for them\n\n01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:53.960\nDan are you able to sort out when somebody is trying to get something from you?\n\n01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:57.960\nAnd when somebody is just expressing how they feel about themselves? Yes. Okay\n\n01:30:57.960 --> 01:30:59.960\nAll right\n\n01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:04.520\nThanks for coming to Harmon Tom\n\n01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:09.400\nChristopher and Mulraine take four bleeding damage from gashes in their stomachs\n\n01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:12.680\nFuck\n\n01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:15.960\nAll right, so we're walking up the staircase right now and bleeding\n\n01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:18.360\nUh, uh\n\n01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:23.720\nHelp help me.

Oh, I was describing\n\n01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:28.280\nUm, the room is freezing cold and on the far side of the room you can see a massive purple beast\n\n01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:34.280\nLooking like a massive porcupine with great orange and purple spines on its back and glowing green eyes\n\n01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:40.280\nIt's standing in front of a long copper pendulum sort of thing that hangs down from a hole in the ceiling\n\n01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:45.640\nI run up and before he says anything I say, I just want you to know that is a great copper pendulum\n\n01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:48.680\nI don't know if it's yours\n\n01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000\nYou say this is a porcupine beast\n\n01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:55.400\nPorcupine more in every single demon we've tried to talk to\n\n01:35:55.400 --> 01:36:00.200\nDo just like they light on fire or their eyes get real big and they don't like to kind of send him to me\n\n01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:04.680\nHe's not kind of sending.

I'm not using the lilting tone of voice\n\n01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:17.400\nI'm saying these demons every time we've run up and talked to them. They're in bad moods. They have had the worst days\n\n01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:23.640\nYou're right. You're right. And yet I I keep on trying to find a demon who's going to relate to me emotionally\n\n01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:30.680\nI I want that too. But that seems like self-destructive behavior. You're right. You're right. I walk I walk out of the door\n\n01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:32.200\nI walk I walk out\n\n01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:34.200\nNo, wait.

No, no, listen\n\n01:36:57.560 --> 01:36:58.760\nI don't\n\n01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:03.640\nCan anyone speak in a direct active sentence and just fucking say what they want the pork you demon attacks\n\n01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:12.120\nI'm just saying love can't bloom\n\n01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:19.080\nAll right, Christeberg and Mulraine get hit by flying spines. Great. I open my eye. I'm hoping to catch one in my eye\n\n01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:21.080\nYou don't\n\n01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:22.120\nDamn\n\n01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:24.920\nChristeberg takes five damage and Mulraine takes one\n\n01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:28.200\nSorry\n\n01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:30.120\nI was trying to help\n\n01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:33.400\nFucking nobody likes anybody friends like these\n\n01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:39.400\nOn the wall behind the porky demon you see a large orange colored door and on either side of the door\n\n01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:45.400\nThree large stone slabs each standing out of the wall like they're uh, you know hanging out\n\n01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:51.560\nThey jut past the wall. I slam my head against the orange door. Okay\n\n01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.360\nWait, no, you're on the other side of the room. Okay. I don't do it. Okay\n\n01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:04.920\nI'm so confused what's going on right now. Yeah, usually I describe a whole room and then you have some idea of what it looks like\n\n01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:11.720\nHow how big is this room? How big is this room? I mean it's it's about 30 by 40. Okay long style\n\n01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:17.400\nLong okay, so the porcupine and the pendulum are on the other end of the room. Yeah, there's like a series of stone\n\n01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:22.360\nYeah stone they look like large circular stone buttons now that I mentioned it\n\n01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:28.680\nAnd then where there's also a door behind them or to one of us. Yeah, they're between they're behind they're directly behind the\n\n01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:31.160\npendulum, okay\n\n01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:33.480\nWe got to get past this porcupine\n\n01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:38.520\nProbably all right.

Yeah\n\n01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:14.760\nThat's what we call it a turn of phrase. I believe this is what they used to call it back in the day\n\n01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:24.680\nThank you for calling\n\n01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:30.040\nSteve could I have your last name and your zip codes or pull up your order? Yep. Last name is tip corn\n\n01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:33.560\nZip codes nine double zero\n\n01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:39.720\nI just made a call by they say had to call back because he was about to head he had to go\n\n01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:46.120\nHe had to head out. Um, but I had some questions about the product before I continued\n\n01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:49.960\nOkay, before you before you ordered it. Yeah\n\n01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:54.440\nOkay, what's your question? Well, I just only caught a glimpse of it on tv\n\n01:48:54.440 --> 01:49:00.120\nI just saw like the last maybe 10 seconds of it and I just trying to go better understand what it was\n\n01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:05.800\nSo these are like special glasses that you can adjust the prescription on them to be whatever you want\n\n01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:10.600\nSo you don't have to ever get new glasses. Is that the idea? Nope. Nope. This is\n\n01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:15.400\nFor you to go outside if you want to try to see birds in a tree\n\n01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:22.600\nOkay, you want to go to a a game where you can zoom in see people at the game so you're not so far away\n\n01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:29.640\nIt it's not for quote. We reading glasses. Okay. Well, I don't do when you're reading. I just do more like looking for\n\n01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:36.200\nBirds and lizards and stuff and driving, you know, like what I was looking for something\n\n01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:38.600\nI don't wear while I'm driving and I can look for birds\n\n01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:44.280\nNope, you can't use these while you're driving you remember when you when you look into these things, right?\n\n01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:50.280\nEverything's going to be magnified to you. Okay, as it comes closer to you. It's going to totally blur up\n\n01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:55.080\nOkay, so wouldn't that be a good thing because you can see stuff from far away. You could break in ahead of time\n\n01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:59.080\nNo, no, no, it's it's going to be totally blurry. Think of it this way\n\n01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:03.480\nIf you if you're have regular binoculars on okay, and\n\n01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:08.840\nAnd if you're going like 30 miles an hour, you're catching up to that thing right away\n\n01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:11.160\nThe stuff is close to you. You can't see\n\n01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:15.880\nWell, but you will you will have seen it before you got to where it was where it is then when you\n\n01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:20.120\ngets worried, but I know but when you blur when you break\n\n01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:26.520\nYou you're going to break too early or way too late. Well, it's better to break too early, isn't it? That's what they say\n\n01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:29.240\nDon't be sorry. Yeah\n\n01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:32.280\nI know but think of the people behind you\n\n01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:38.040\nYou're you're going along you you break. They don't see anything in front of you. They're going to smack you nowhere\n\n01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:43.720\nOh, well, oh, I don't know who drives like that because you can't see around the car\n\n01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:47.800\nOh, so I know I always look behind the car ahead of me\n\n01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:53.560\nOh, so if you so if a person's breaking and they and so if you're driving behind somebody and that person in front\n\n01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:56.600\nOf you breaks, but you don't see what they're breaking for you. Just hit them\n\n01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:01.320\nCorrect. Yeah. Oh, that's why that's why you never drive close\n\n01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:04.440\nBut I always look behind the car in front of me and so well\n\n01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:09.160\nWhat happens when you rear end them when the one they'd never I never have I never have\n\n01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:12.120\nOh, but you given the circumstance you would\n\n01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:17.080\nChoose to rear end them because you'd be like why they stop and I'm gonna show them what for why not to stop\n\n01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:19.320\nIs it like that?\n\n01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:24.200\nWhat but but you don't wear these driving. You do that. What about video games?\n\n01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:29.880\nVideo games good, right? I'll make it look like I have a giant tv or something, right? You could play\n\n01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:37.960\nWell far away people people have here used these glasses while working here on the computer screen\n\n01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:43.560\nThat's cool. So I thought so I suppose you can use them. We'd be a video game. That's a great idea\n\n01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:46.600\nYeah, do you wear it? Where y'all working at?\n\n01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:53.400\nWe're in Connecticut. Oh Connecticut. I've been there once it's really pretty there. It's probably pretty hot there right now, isn't it?\n\n01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:59.000\nUh, it's in the 80s 90s. Yeah 80s 90s. Well, I would say it's pretty hot. You know, I don't know\n\n01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:01.080\nDo you consider that hot or do you say that's not hot?\n\n01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:05.080\nNo, that's not hot. What do you consider hot? Are you from like the desert?\n\n01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:14.120\nUh, nope. Uh, hot is in the high 90s hundreds. Oh, wow. Okay. So what do you consider this to be just like like fun or like\n\n01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:18.920\nWarm, it's not hot. Isn't it? It's not hot. It's double warm. How about double warm?\n\n01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:24.920\nNo, double warm is just over 100. That's it. Oh, so what would you consider this temperature to be then?\n\n01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:29.080\nBecause I'm in the same temperature shred that you just mentioned. I'm in that and I could say it's hot\n\n01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:33.000\nBut I don't know. Maybe I should not use that word. I should say something else\n\n01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:36.760\nWhere you at in Arizona? Well, we're near there. Yep\n\n01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:43.320\nYep. No, that's not hot. That's dry heat. That's totally different. Okay. What what do you mean? I don't understand\n\n01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:47.240\nDry heat is totally different than regular hot and humid\n\n01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:50.760\nHow so hot hot and humid you will die\n\n01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:55.880\nIf you were to go to a hot and humid you would think it's about 130\n\n01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:58.120\n130\n\n01:52:58.120 --> 01:53:02.600\nOh, yeah easy. That's like a like a miniature oven or something. Oh, yeah, I know\n\n01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:05.080\nOh, I didn't know that. Oh, yeah\n\n01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:07.240\nYeah, if you if you ever go down to\n\n01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:13.720\nIf you go down to where water is totally around you, okay like an island\n\n01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:20.040\nCorrect and it gets to be hot. Uh-huh. You will you will die because it's it's so hot and humid\n\n01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:25.560\nWhere you guys are you don't have that much humidity. I have a question. Couldn't you just get in that water and cool down?\n\n01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:30.200\nWell, you can but but you do but a lot of people who are not used to it die\n\n01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:34.120\nThey because they don't know how to swim or because they just don't know they can get in the water\n\n01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:37.080\nThey just don't know how to cool off. A lot of people don't like the water\n\n01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:39.880\nLike they're like dogs or something because dogs do that\n\n01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:43.240\nDogs can't get in the water because they don't know it's water\n\n01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:47.320\nThey just think it's for drinking and then they try to drink it all and then they just die\n\n01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:53.960\nYeah, yeah, but I'll all dogs know how to swim because they dog paddle. Oh, are you serious? Wait, we just say that again\n\n01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:57.240\nAll dogs know how to swim because they dog paddle\n\n01:53:57.240 --> 01:54:01.240\nWell, what does that mean? They have like a special like motor or something in them? I don't know\n\n01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:07.960\nNo, no, no, if you watch a dog go into water, okay, they start moving their feet all the time. It's called dog paddle\n\n01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:11.560\nThat's why they tell tell you when you learn how to swim dog paddle\n\n01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:15.160\nOkay, that's where that comes from. So you just dog paddle\n\n01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:21.480\nSo so the best thing you do on a hot day is to get down by that water where it's super hot and get in and dog paddle\n\n01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:25.160\nMm-hmm. So you're telling me it's 130 degrees there\n\n01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:32.360\nNo, no, it can't it can be it can be it well, you know, or it feels like it feels like 130\n\n01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:38.280\nWell, when it gets to be 100 near water, you know, you know near 100\n\n01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:44.200\nIt's going to be hot and humid. You're because you're from Arizona. You're going to think it's much hotter\n\n01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:50.920\nOh, yeah, it's not because it's now humid and humid adds, you know, because I got to be humid up here\n\n01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:56.280\nWater temperature was like 91 humidity with the humidity was up to the 99 percent\n\n01:54:56.760 --> 01:54:59.720\nOh, that's that's that's like a rain in the air\n\n01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:05.960\nCorrect. Yep. So basically surrounded by air. So this is what I don't understand. Okay humidity is 99 percent\n\n01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:10.760\nIt's 90 degrees makes it feel like it's 130 because the water's around you\n\n01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:17.000\nBut how come then when you get into water like a pool, which is a thousand percent water, right?\n\n01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:23.400\nCan we agree on that? Mm-hmm. A thousand percent water. How come that cools you down? Is it because it's so much water?\n\n01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:27.880\nBecause no, it's just it just because the water is on your skin. It doesn't really cool you down\n\n01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:32.920\nIt's it's cooling the outside of your skin. What about a convection oven? They know about that\n\n01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:37.720\nNo, don't know anything about that. Okay. I heard a convection oven on the news\n\n01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:45.240\nThey said when it does a uh instead of raining if it does wind which wind is like rain, but it's\n\n01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:47.480\nIt's not water. It's just like air\n\n01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:51.720\nWhen it does that from above because there's just hot clouds up there\n\n01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:58.840\nThat they have we have these hot clouds they come over and you think it's going to be a lot cooler because the sun's going\n\n01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:01.960\nhiding but actually it's a hot cloud and it does a\n\n01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:04.120\nit does a\n\n01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:09.800\nWind from the top and it does a they call it a convection oven because what it does is it blows\n\n01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:12.440\nheat like um\n\n01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:17.640\nLike a hairdryer like it's been plugged in like a plugged in hairdryer and that will\n\n01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:22.120\ncause um, if you're doing laundry, you don't have to drive\n\n01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:24.920\nRight. Yeah\n\n01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:29.160\nSo what you're saying is you guys out there you can't hang your clothes up\n\n01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:35.160\nOh, no, you can you can that will dry that that's totally different. Well, you said it's 99\n\n01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:38.600\nYeah, what about if it's a thousand you could you?\n\n01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:43.960\nOkay, you you you can put it outside the heat from the sun is going to dry it dry your clothes\n\n01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:47.640\nWhat about if it's like a nine like nine hundred percent humidity?\n\n01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:52.200\nIt doesn't matter. It's just going to be more damp on your clothes. It's not going to be super dry\n\n01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:57.960\nIt's going to take longer to dry it. So it's going to be what's the highest percent you can get before it's it's wet\n\n01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:01.960\n100 percent 100 percent is total rain. Oh, no a thousand percent\n\n01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:05.320\nNo, 100 percent. Well, you can't go a thousand percent\n\n01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:08.920\nWell, you can yes, you can't because there's that that's the number percentage it is\n\n01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:11.800\nThat's the highest number per thousand. No, no, no\n\n01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:16.280\nYou you can't go over a hundred percent go go ahead and watch all the all the news\n\n01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:19.880\nUh, it goes up to a hundred percent. It's pure rain\n\n01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:24.280\nYou know when they go ahead and say it's 80 chance of rain. They'll never go above a hundred percent\n\n01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:26.600\nI swear I saw once they said\n\n01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:33.080\n500 chance of rain and it was yeah, and it was and it definitely rained the next day very hard\n\n01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:35.880\nI think that's probably you know, I think that's probably the thing\n\n01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:40.120\nIt's different where I live and where you live because the here the rain is different more\n\n01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:45.240\nDoesn't happen as much. So when it does happen, they say hey look you really got to look out for the rain\n\n01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:51.720\nIt's going to be a 500 percent rain not just an 80 percent because people around here like they don't believe it because people here are stupid\n\n01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:53.720\nSo they don't get it. Yeah\n\n01:57:53.720 --> 01:57:59.080\nYeah, that's interesting. Well, well then how come those glasses the how come the zoomers they um, they say like\n\n01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:01.080\nmagnifies\n\n01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:03.080\n300 percent\n\n01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:05.800\n300 percent what you see with the naked eye\n\n01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:11.400\nSo 300 so that's a that's a percent that I thought it can't go over a hundred though\n\n01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:16.520\nNo, that's different. Okay. I don't understand that that is uh,\n\n01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:19.240\nif you can see good at\n\n01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:26.200\n40 feet, uh, you know 40 yards right 300 300 percent in is you you that much closer to you\n\n01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:33.560\nSo it's like a horse. It's like if you rode on a horse toward the item that you're looking at but didn't ride on it\n\n01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:36.760\nCorrect. Okay. So is it it's a have like a stabilizer?\n\n01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:40.600\nSo if you're on a horse you can still look at it does not no stabilizer\n\n01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:46.360\nOkay, because I would want to I would we want to use them with a horse because that's the best way to get toward birds\n\n01:58:46.520 --> 01:58:49.720\nBecause the horses don't scare birds like a car does\n\n01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:54.120\nCorrect same with lizards lizards don't mind horses. Did you know that?\n\n01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:59.720\nCorrect. Yeah, that's weird. I don't know for some reason lizards are not bothered by horses\n\n01:59:00.440 --> 01:59:04.840\nBut they are bothered by dogs. I tried to do I have a very large dog\n\n01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:07.320\nIt's a double st. Bernard\n\n01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:12.040\nIt's like a st. Bernard, but it's brood brood in russia and it's very large and you can ride it\n\n01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:14.360\nYou know, it doesn't like to be ridden but you can ride it\n\n01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:18.520\nAnd it will allow you to get super close to the lizards to take their pictures\n\n01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:25.000\nBut you you think so but it scares them away. So I got a horse instead and the horses just don't\n\n01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:27.720\nI think the horses and lizards are friends because they're both\n\n01:59:28.360 --> 01:59:31.880\nUm, the same the same family or something so they don't scare them\n\n01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:37.400\nAnd so I will be riding the horse toward the lizards and the birds\n\n01:59:38.360 --> 01:59:40.360\nAnd that's why I need a shock absorber\n\n01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:44.280\nBut those don't have them, huh?\n\n01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:48.920\nNo, so they do not happen. Okay, but you could mount anything on there, right? Like once I get them\n\n01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000\nI can do whatever I want to them\n\n01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:56.120\nCorrect. So you can't drive with them, but you can ride a horse. No problem\n\n01:59:57.160 --> 02:00:03.480\nCorrect. Okay, right. Is that because the horses they are more friendly and stuff like toward a lizard? No\n\n02:00:04.200 --> 02:00:11.320\nNo, no, it's uh, it's it's just it on spook. That's all it is. Oh, it's a spook, right? Okay. Yeah, because like you were saying if you\n\n02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:15.480\nYou because a horse if you're gonna stop early because you've got your\n\n02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:19.400\nThere's zoomies you can see far you see that lizard far ahead\n\n02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:23.720\nOr maybe a spider and you stop the person behind you on a horse will\n\n02:00:24.120 --> 02:00:27.560\nTheir horse knows that you stopped and you don't they don't have to hit the brakes, right?\n\n02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:33.320\nCorrect. Yeah, see that's what I think I might try this out now when I do the car drive is when I\n\n02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:38.360\nSomeone ahead of me breaks for no reason and I don't see anything. I don't see like a wall\n\n02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:42.120\nOr a stop sign or like a person or like a child\n\n02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:49.560\nI'm just gonna keep just hit give them a little tap because that way you can collect insurance because they they are at fault for stopping\n\n02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:54.840\nHmm. Yeah, I I have a friend who did that actually who um made\n\n02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:58.840\nHe's made all of his money doing that just by what he does\n\n02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:03.320\nHe drives around real fast and he just if somebody does the wrong\n\n02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:07.880\nUm move in traffic. He just lets him know he teaches them, you know\n\n02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:11.080\nYou know, you have sometimes you have to teach people the hard way and that's just you have to hit them\n\n02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:17.960\nYeah, and but that's okay cars are made for that. So we all know which way we're gonna go, you know, I'm saying\n\n02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:21.400\nYeah\n\n02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:26.360\nOkay, and the so is that it's that a thousand percent thing that will work out\n\n02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:30.360\nCorrect. Okay, because that's so that's a thousand percent always\n\n02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:33.240\nOkay, okay great\n\n02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:39.160\nI'm good with okay you too. Make sure you uh when you find when you follow up on that\n\n02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:44.440\nBe sure to look out and let me know if there's a lizard you see any sizes of the one I was mentioning\n\n02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:47.160\nYeah, great. Okay\n\n02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:51.080\nOkay, that sounds good. And just let me know there if ever\n\n02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:53.720\nreoccurs there\n\n02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:57.800\nOkay, okay, great. Um, I'm gonna try to figure out this this trip\n\n02:01:57.800 --> 02:02:03.560\nUh, because I think if I get them to go on the trip and I can see how far we're going to be there for\n\n02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:10.360\nOkay, it sounds good. Okay. Is that something that I would want to get an extra one for or what do you think?\n\n02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:15.240\nNo, it's a buy one get one free offer. Okay, so if I I could\n\n02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:18.680\nIs it possible to double them up to wear them to stack them?\n\n02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:22.680\nNo, there is no what is that because why is that?\n\n02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:28.680\nBecause it just fits on the side of your head. You can't double it, but I could I could put it on there on the front\n\n02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:35.880\nNo, it won't fit because you got to push them out further. They won't go. Oh, so it's like a it's like a telescope\n\n02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:41.000\nIt's uh similar but but it just like a pair of glasses\n\n02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:46.840\nYou can't put two on because the glasses get in the way of each other. Oh, I I put two glasses on before\n\n02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:52.920\nYou just put them on on top of the one that's underneath the other one\n\n02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:58.680\nYou know, you ever had double done double sunglasses or sometimes say my uncle has\n\n02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:00.680\nprescription\n\n02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:04.600\nGlasses, but he also wears sunglasses and he'll put his sunglasses on over\n\n02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:11.000\nThe prescriptors and then he just does it and you know, he goes hunting and he drives that way he'll fish\n\n02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:13.160\nSo\n\n02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:15.480\nI'm gonna do that too, but when I'm on vacation\n\n02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:17.480\nOkay, okay\n\n02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:20.360\nThat sounds good.

You said it's not hot even though it's almost it's in the 90s\n\n02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:57.960\nBut you didn't say it's not double warm.

Wow. That's pretty interesting. Then what do you call it below minus 10?\n\n02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:50.760\nThen it gets cold. Okay, then how how much further does it get before it gets something else besides cold?\n\n02:05:50.760 --> 02:05:55.320\nNo, you can't get below cold. It's just cold.

So zero degrees is the coldest it gets, right?\n\n02:06:23.960 --> 02:06:25.960\nNope.
