WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:24.920
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, once again to Hollywood, California, Meltdown Theater,

00:24.920 --> 00:35.920
Nerd Melt Theater. Meltdown Comics. Once again, Harmontown is in session. Do me and do yourselves

00:35.920 --> 00:51.980
the kindness and welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown. Dan Harmon. We have so

00:51.980 --> 00:52.820
What's to do?

00:52.820 --> 00:55.000
We're gonna just fucking, we're just gonna go.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.260
We don't often have a lot to do.

00:57.260 --> 01:00.600
I saw your eyes dart to my new affectation.

01:00.600 --> 01:04.760
This'll be 20 minutes of the show.

01:04.760 --> 01:09.040
I, Dan, for the home listener,

01:09.040 --> 01:12.200
has taken to over the last couple days

01:13.200 --> 01:16.040
wearing an invention of, I believe Spencer's design.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.040
Correct?

01:17.040 --> 01:19.920
I went to Spencer, I said, Spencer,

01:19.920 --> 01:21.640
I need to keep track of things.

01:21.640 --> 01:22.720
Very quickly.

01:22.720 --> 01:26.640
Like, how quickly, beyond Steve Job's definition,

01:28.880 --> 01:30.000
I call him Job's.

01:30.000 --> 01:30.840
Okay.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.840
I think of him as a biblical character.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.520
Beyond Steve Job's definition of like,

01:35.520 --> 01:37.840
like visionary though he was,

01:37.840 --> 01:40.440
like how quickly can Dan Harmon's brain

01:40.440 --> 01:42.680
be stored permanently?

01:42.680 --> 01:45.040
So I'm wearing a notepad around my neck

01:45.040 --> 01:46.200
with a pen on the string.

01:46.200 --> 01:49.600
It looks, I mean, is it a shoelace or a lanyard string?

01:49.600 --> 01:52.680
Or what have you, it's a sort of black, black cordage.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.280
The brilliant thing about this is that it has three components,

01:55.280 --> 01:57.520
all of which can be replaced.

01:57.520 --> 01:59.280
It doesn't, like I've already forgotten

01:59.280 --> 02:01.360
many of them on my bed stand.

02:01.360 --> 02:03.360
Spencer is then able to create a new one.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.400
But for the home listener, for the home listener,

02:05.400 --> 02:07.120
you have a black string around your neck.

02:07.120 --> 02:09.360
It's a black string around my neck.

02:09.360 --> 02:12.200
A kind of a three by five or four by six

02:12.200 --> 02:16.360
looking a spiral notepad and a pen dangling.

02:16.360 --> 02:20.560
A pen with the pocket clip of the pen anchored

02:20.560 --> 02:21.400
on the string.

02:21.400 --> 02:22.240
So let me show you.

02:22.240 --> 02:25.760
So you sir, what's your name?

02:25.760 --> 02:26.600
Greg.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.720
Now, here's the thing, it'll take forever

02:33.720 --> 02:36.960
to put the pen back, but Greg, boom,

02:36.960 --> 02:40.040
fucking your mouth to my notepad.

02:40.040 --> 02:42.360
Like that's not, like now, okay,

02:42.360 --> 02:44.480
now let's pretend I don't have the notepad around my neck.

02:44.480 --> 02:46.600
What's your name?

02:46.600 --> 02:48.240
Greg.

02:48.240 --> 02:51.680
Now Dan's taking out his enormous phone.

02:51.680 --> 02:52.680
You got to open up an app.

02:52.680 --> 02:56.880
Get away from 4chan and onto the notepad document.

02:56.880 --> 03:00.320
Fuck it, at a certain point, it's like, fuck, who's Greg?

03:00.320 --> 03:03.240
Who cares?

03:03.240 --> 03:07.560
Humanity, the eye harmin' around my neck.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.800
Spencer Crittenden created this.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.160
Eye harmin' with my idea.

03:11.160 --> 03:12.960
I coined the phrase eye harmin'.

03:12.960 --> 03:13.760
Eye harmin'.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.200
I also named it the eye harmin'.

03:15.200 --> 03:18.000
I called it the eye harmin', or also chest notes.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.440
Chest notes.

03:20.440 --> 03:21.320
This is a big deal.

03:21.320 --> 03:22.160
Here's the other thing.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.760
What about memo roundum?

03:28.160 --> 03:30.800
Memo roundum, memo roundum, so it could be unisex.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.800
You memo roundum now?

03:32.800 --> 03:34.800
I want to explain something super cool about this,

03:34.800 --> 03:36.840
is that like Spencer and I talked about this,

03:36.840 --> 03:41.120
and he said, yeah, but it won't be,

03:41.120 --> 03:42.840
like if the string goes through the top,

03:42.840 --> 03:43.920
then you won't be able to.

03:43.920 --> 03:47.000
And I said, look, here's the thing.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.120
I am prepared to change my way of thinking

03:50.120 --> 03:53.000
about what constitutes the bottom and top of a notepad.

03:57.720 --> 03:58.560
That's the genius.

03:58.560 --> 04:01.960
That's me being Steve Jobs.

04:01.960 --> 04:07.640
This is, that's the whole point is, shkah, bam.

04:07.640 --> 04:12.200
All you have to do is think different.

04:12.200 --> 04:15.000
This is the top now.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.120
It's fucking amazing.

04:16.120 --> 04:21.280
And also, if you choose to, if my name happened

04:21.280 --> 04:25.600
to be on the cover, you'd know my name.

04:25.600 --> 04:28.320
So if we all did, this is like my Malcolm X bow tie,

04:28.320 --> 04:31.880
like just in case we're going on a movement here.

04:31.880 --> 04:32.920
Don't adopt it right away.

04:32.920 --> 04:34.000
Let me refine this.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.480
Let me workshop this.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.800
Because I think the size can be adjusted.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.360
I put forward to Dan earlier.

04:39.360 --> 04:39.960
Don't do anything yet.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.200
I put forward to Dan earlier that he

04:41.200 --> 04:42.240
should get a bigger notepad.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.920
And on the front of it, just draw a big clock

04:43.920 --> 04:45.680
and be like, flavor Flav.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.880
Let me workshop it, and then we'll be OK.

04:47.880 --> 04:48.760
What about this size?

04:48.760 --> 04:50.280
This is what I was talking to you earlier.

04:50.280 --> 04:51.120
Is that more suitable?

04:51.120 --> 04:52.000
That's what I had in mind.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.880
Spencer doesn't, you know, he's a strange child.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.880
I think he went and cut a real notebook

04:58.880 --> 05:00.120
into different shapes.

05:00.120 --> 05:01.120
I don't know.

05:01.120 --> 05:03.960
Wait, is that not, is that hewn out of a larger thing?

05:03.960 --> 05:05.240
Yeah, he does weird shit.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.320
He doesn't.

05:06.320 --> 05:10.360
If you go into Spencer's, like, if you get a ride from Spencer,

05:10.360 --> 05:13.800
he'll have a, like, Spencer has, like,

05:13.800 --> 05:14.840
he's like a myth buster.

05:14.840 --> 05:19.360
Like, he has, like, he'll have, like, a thing in his car

05:19.360 --> 05:22.160
that's, like, made out of binder clips that

05:22.160 --> 05:23.720
will hold his iPhone.

05:23.720 --> 05:27.920
But it's like, you know, he's like a life hacker.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.000
He's a life hacker.

05:29.000 --> 05:29.520
OK.

05:29.520 --> 05:30.000
Yeah.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Don't worry about it.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.680
Have you got any chestnuts on your chestnuts there for us?

05:34.680 --> 05:36.640
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I do.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.560
My breathing issue, I want to talk about that.

05:38.560 --> 05:40.640
I've been listening to Harbitan episodes,

05:40.640 --> 05:43.560
and I've noticed that my thing is that I do this.

05:43.560 --> 05:46.040
Hey, Jeff, giraffes are weird, right?

05:46.040 --> 05:47.960
Why do they have such long necks?

05:47.960 --> 05:55.280
I have this nerd inhale that I get.

05:55.280 --> 05:57.440
You guys know what I mean, right?

05:57.440 --> 05:59.800
Like, I've never noticed anything like this.

05:59.800 --> 06:00.920
I'd like to change it.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.280
I don't want to do it anymore.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.120
You make a face like you're breathing through your nose,

06:04.120 --> 06:05.960
but you're going through your mouth, aren't you?

06:05.960 --> 06:07.480
Well, I'm imitating the sound.

06:07.480 --> 06:12.200
I don't know what I'm doing it, but like it's a weird thing to have to listen to and I don't want to do it anymore

06:12.200 --> 06:17.800
Okay, all right. That's a self-adjustment. I'd like to talk tonight about how to take a compliment

06:19.280 --> 06:24.900
Okay, a lot of us don't know how to do that say say what Adam. That's a good topic. Yes. Thank you, Adam

06:25.120 --> 06:27.040
See you just did it. Oh

06:27.040 --> 06:29.040
Yes, great

06:30.800 --> 06:32.880
Next next item on the agenda

06:32.880 --> 06:36.440
That was so much easier than we all expected

06:37.560 --> 06:40.760
Jeff tell me I did it tell me I did a good job at something Dan

06:40.760 --> 06:45.520
That is a lovely notepad hanging around your midsection. Well, it's a work in progress. I don't know what I'm doing

06:45.920 --> 06:48.880
See what I did there. I told him he was a piece of shit. I

06:49.800 --> 06:52.920
Told me there's nobody's talking about we all have that on us

06:52.920 --> 06:56.320
We won't we want to be humble and it's for it's it's for a good reason

06:56.320 --> 06:58.040
Is there any concern of when you're wearing it?

06:58.040 --> 07:04.120
I had to go back to the chest notes or I Harmon, but is there any concern is you wearing a big notepad around your chest?

07:04.120 --> 07:06.600
That people will mistake you for like a death

07:09.600 --> 07:16.240
Yeah, I'm 40 years old. I'm I'm I'm charging into the fucking preach. You look it makes you look a little special

07:17.080 --> 07:22.440
And I an argument could be made that I am see you just took another compliment. I snuck one in there and you took it

07:22.440 --> 07:25.840
Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. That was a great compliment. All right

07:25.840 --> 07:27.840
You ain't you ain't shitting

07:28.360 --> 07:30.960
See what we're doing there. That's that's how work gets done

07:33.160 --> 07:37.640
Are you are you have you always been bad at taking compliments? Yeah, you seem like you can take a compliment

07:37.640 --> 07:41.920
I've learned I had therapists that told me they said when you do that

07:42.760 --> 07:48.920
You tell people that they're full of shit and somebody says I liked I liked like I like what you did

07:48.920 --> 07:52.920
I like what you do. I like your jacket. I like your hair. You look you look like you lost weight

07:52.920 --> 07:59.240
Uh, something as you tell them you automatically go. No, I haven't I don't know what you're just saying to them

07:59.240 --> 08:01.960
You don't know what you're talking about your eyeballs are idiots. You're an idiot

08:02.360 --> 08:08.520
You're in your brain is dumb. You don't know what you're talking about, right? It's it's but it's a it's a it's a it's a big

08:08.520 --> 08:13.000
It's a fucking thing. It's it's the crux. It's the it's the it's the knot

08:13.400 --> 08:20.200
It's the knot of civilization Jeff. We've all like like we need to figure this out. I'd like to try to figure it out

08:20.200 --> 08:22.200
What are you writing down? I

08:22.200 --> 08:29.080
Make notes all the time. Okay. All right. Good job. What's that guy's name? What's that guy's name in the front row Greg? All right, okay?

08:30.720 --> 08:32.720
Yeah

08:32.800 --> 08:35.080
Just even the writing it down. We wrote it down in my brain

08:35.080 --> 08:35.920
Yeah, it is a thing though

08:35.920 --> 08:39.760
When someone pays you a column even if you disagree with them even if you think like it someone goes

08:39.760 --> 08:43.320
Oh, you look nice today, and you feel like you look like shit or you've had a bad day when somebody says something nice

08:43.480 --> 08:48.760
Even if you think that they're wrong you still say thank you. You don't have to you don't have to go you know what you're really, right?

08:48.760 --> 08:53.600
You're really I really yeah, they're never they're never gonna be like no one's ever gonna come up to you go

08:53.600 --> 09:00.040
I love your hair, and then you go. Thank you. They're never gonna walk away and go. He said thank you. What a dick

09:01.560 --> 09:03.400
Unless they're a huge dick

09:03.400 --> 09:07.080
And they're sitting out so much once you start getting good at taking compliments because like you know

09:07.080 --> 09:11.600
We all do like what my friend kind of kind of like this old thing something so you look great today

09:11.600 --> 09:14.480
Oh, this is a I got this off the rack. It's a thrift store at five dollars

09:14.480 --> 09:20.200
And you say like oh this whole thing like you're stupid you're wrong if you just say thank you that's great

09:20.200 --> 09:25.880
But then once you get good at that then people pay you sarcastic compliments. He goes nice suit, bro. You go. Thank you

09:27.200 --> 09:30.280
And here's what I'd like to talk about this is the weird thing

09:31.040 --> 09:33.040
Fishing for compliments

09:33.200 --> 09:35.200
This is where people like me

09:35.280 --> 09:37.280
Get thrown for a loop

09:37.360 --> 09:41.000
Many times people come up to you and and self-deprecate

09:41.000 --> 09:47.000
As an entree to a conversation people come up to you and they say

09:48.800 --> 09:52.800
My shirt so stupid I shut down at that point

09:52.800 --> 09:57.720
I know and I watch everyone around me go your shirts amazing

09:58.440 --> 10:01.320
And I watch society rise around me

10:01.920 --> 10:07.400
Because I shut down I go I go I don't I never had an opinion about your shirt

10:07.400 --> 10:11.360
But I do know that you're trying to get me to say something about your shirt

10:11.520 --> 10:13.520
And I can't do it and I won't do it

10:14.280 --> 10:19.400
Because in my world if I tell you your shirt is noteworthy. It's fucking noteworthy

10:19.760 --> 10:26.040
Like that's that's my Bitcoin like I create my like my my currency

10:26.800 --> 10:31.720
Dan Harmon said have a nice day to me. I should have a nice day

10:32.960 --> 10:34.960
Dan Harmon told me to

10:34.960 --> 10:38.600
He didn't just barf it out now. You're paying yourself compliments

10:40.000 --> 10:44.320
No, I'm not I'm being a thank-you-self. Thank-you-self. Like I don't know

10:45.040 --> 10:48.880
I'm bad at making a show. I don't know. I shouldn't I shouldn't be talking to a microphone at all

10:48.880 --> 10:54.560
I should just stop. I should just stop. I should just stop talking on this microphone. I don't I don't even know what I'm doing

10:55.080 --> 10:57.080
Everybody thanks for coming

10:57.080 --> 11:06.400
Every day we feel that right that's that that's the thing like like people people puncture like their little mosquito proboscis

11:06.560 --> 11:11.000
Into you and it's got a little hook on the other end of it. They want something from you

11:11.000 --> 11:17.960
I can't I like I like I live people people do it all the time and I think I think good people just just

11:18.560 --> 11:21.360
Like they respond to it appropriately like people go

11:21.360 --> 11:25.760
I didn't know what I did with my hair and then someone goes like that looks great

11:25.760 --> 11:30.400
It's great, and then they make friends, and I don't know how to do that. That's where I shut down

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Give me a script

11:34.720 --> 11:40.240
Talking to you. I'm not worthy of talking to you and I'm supposed to say you're worthy of talking to me

11:40.240 --> 11:42.120
I don't know you I

11:42.120 --> 11:48.120
Don't know that you're worthy of talking to me. You can't just you can't just create an effect by saying the opposite thing fuck you

11:48.120 --> 11:52.840
How should people approach you then on all fours

11:55.000 --> 11:59.440
With with a tray of whatever they are offering me on the back of their neck I

12:00.400 --> 12:04.360
Don't know I don't know I swear to God. I don't know I don't know I

12:05.160 --> 12:10.120
Really don't know I just I just know what I'm being baited, and I don't respond to it

12:10.960 --> 12:12.960
What what sweetie what?

12:12.960 --> 12:18.600
Oh Aaron's ejaculating Aaron's crying out Aaron's crying out. Don't don't

12:26.880 --> 12:32.160
I didn't mean to a moat so out of play when you said you don't know when you're being baited

12:32.600 --> 12:39.240
You you or you know when you're being baited you don't like that's the thing is that because of those

12:39.240 --> 12:43.080
Because of those times when people have been trying to get something from you

12:43.520 --> 12:47.480
You you are not able to distinguish between people actually

12:48.480 --> 12:50.480
saying Dan Harmon I I

12:51.400 --> 12:54.720
I'm so embarrassed to talk to you because I don't feel like I'm good enough to talk to you

12:54.720 --> 12:58.800
But I admire you you automatically think that they're the same person who's like, hey

12:58.800 --> 13:03.680
I probably shouldn't be talking to you because I'm I don't know why I'm switching my voice, but

13:03.680 --> 13:07.840
I'm speaking to myself you and I in our relationship

13:11.480 --> 13:17.640
Sometimes when I'm when I am actually saying I feel unattractive. I feel whatever your immediate reaction is

13:18.560 --> 13:20.560
What do you want me to say?

13:21.320 --> 13:24.520
No, I just I'm just telling you like I just feel

13:25.280 --> 13:29.600
Bad, but you are unable which which is why there's the notepad

13:29.600 --> 13:35.240
Yeah, so and so wants me to think their pants look good

13:35.400 --> 13:39.320
But I just say like I want you to think about my pants and I'll write it down

13:40.240 --> 13:43.080
Gloria pants are important to her and I'll write it down

13:43.480 --> 13:47.400
I'm just saying this and I say this out of love that not everyone is

13:47.960 --> 13:54.920
Fishing and I think that like it's it's important to you to see saying every day everybody puts out pants that they think are shitty

13:54.920 --> 13:56.920
It just walks around on these pants, whatever

13:56.920 --> 14:03.080
Well, most of them are fishing. There's a difference and there's a difference between do I look fat in the shirt?

14:03.080 --> 14:06.040
I feel like I look fat and everyone's like no you don't like fat

14:06.280 --> 14:12.840
There's a difference between that and I feel like I did a bad job on that or I feel like there's a difference

14:13.360 --> 14:17.880
You know that you you you romanticize your ass burgers

14:17.880 --> 14:24.160
You know take it to the place of not being able to distinguish between the two things. All right. All right

14:24.160 --> 14:26.160
Thank you

14:28.800 --> 14:30.800

14:54.440 --> 14:59.800
I want to bring up a special friend from the Feral audio network again Jeff listen. Nobody's making any money

15:00.080 --> 15:06.520
We're in network. It ain't me. I just want to bring up my good friend Johnny Pemberton Johnny Pemberton everybody

15:11.280 --> 15:17.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, anywhere anything you want to do grabbing either Mike grab both of them

15:18.040 --> 15:20.040
Make yourself at home

15:20.040 --> 15:22.320
Hey, you're gonna get out of here

15:23.760 --> 15:30.240
Do you do twisting the wind is the name of your podcast right twisting the wind and you and you experiment with audio and

15:30.480 --> 15:34.240
Yeah, you're a little kid. You're a little baby kid. Yeah, I'm a baby child

15:35.240 --> 15:41.160
I chew on like weird little toys and then I see what sounds they make they make a cool sound

15:41.160 --> 15:47.880
I amplify and run it through the duty seven and then I buy something on Amazon and that's how it works

15:47.880 --> 15:52.160
That's basically it. I you're often a guest at my good friend Duncan Tressel's podcast

15:52.160 --> 15:56.240
I say good friend in that I am fond of him and you hung out with him three times. Yeah

15:57.640 --> 16:00.040
I'm a better friend of himself. Yeah, I

16:00.920 --> 16:02.440
accept that

16:02.440 --> 16:05.120
Right, so you you I'm gonna choose this chair

16:05.120 --> 16:11.480
You described a an audition that you went on. I heard that this recently. Oh my god. I can't believe how far this is like

16:11.480 --> 16:19.800
Proliferated as it is it coming back to come back to me, but I can't believe that it's like still like I've forgotten about it

16:19.800 --> 16:25.160
I've honestly forgotten about it like I wish I could do with other things, but I have and now it's like

16:25.160 --> 16:27.680
Oh, you reminded me of this thing. Well, I think it's very resonant

16:28.680 --> 16:32.080
Interesting wasn't very far from here actually physically was not very far from here

16:32.080 --> 16:33.600
You were in Duncan Tressel's podcast

16:33.600 --> 16:38.080
You go listen to the episode and you were describing this brief experience that you had where you went in as a young actor

16:38.080 --> 16:41.720
Going in or an old actor. Who knows? Maybe you have some progeria. I don't know

16:42.160 --> 16:48.100
You you you went into this thing and you experienced the normal amount of like weird

16:48.600 --> 16:51.000
hierarchy like odd fascistic

16:51.760 --> 16:58.200
Cash casting like culture and you just bothered to do what any normal human being would do under normal circumstances

16:58.200 --> 17:02.320
Just go go fuck yourself to somebody who was acting weird to you and it was like

17:03.040 --> 17:07.080
They can go listen to the story about it. I don't know either. I was stricken with that

17:07.080 --> 17:11.600
I never perceived you as a revolutionary. Oh, I I have done some bad stuff

17:12.160 --> 17:17.360
Yeah, what's your what are your politics? I don't know. I mean, I don't know if I have true politics

17:17.360 --> 17:22.520
But I kind of waver around like I'll sympathize with al-Qaeda sometimes

17:22.960 --> 17:24.400
Everyone's in a while

17:24.400 --> 17:26.400
Everyone's in a while much room for the underdog

17:29.640 --> 17:32.880
I'm I feel like I'm the underdog and always have been sort of an underdog

17:32.880 --> 17:40.080
So if there's someone beating up a guy, if someone gives somebody a hard time, I'll be there Johnny Pemberton will be there

17:40.080 --> 17:42.600
Yeah, okay, I'll kind of been getting a free ride for two

17:44.440 --> 17:48.520
The poor bastards everyone mispronounces their name like they can't get like a

17:49.320 --> 17:53.720
Generalized the spelling. It's like Gaddafi like you can spell Gaddafi wherever you want

17:53.720 --> 17:58.840
I think I have a whole different alphabet. We don't know about that. It's too bad. I feel bad for them kind of they're crazy

17:58.840 --> 18:09.600
So what kind of what kind of stuff could people I don't know it's awkward for people to sell themselves, but

18:10.240 --> 18:14.600
You know people tuning into your podcast. What are they? What are they? What are they looking for?

18:14.600 --> 18:17.800
Oh, you're looking for the early covax of audio. Oh, yeah

18:17.800 --> 18:24.880
There's a lot of sounds a lot of communication a lot of prank phone calls a significant amount of prank phone calls

18:24.880 --> 18:28.480
But they're not really prank phone calls. They're more just like phone calls

18:29.920 --> 18:34.520
Can we do it? Can you pretend that I'm like a guy working at just just working?

18:34.520 --> 18:38.480
Okay, let's say you work at like Halliburton. I work at I work at Halliburton

18:38.480 --> 18:44.880
Okay, maybe work at um this place that sells those things called zoomies so these goggles you can put on they're like binoculars

18:44.880 --> 18:50.320
They're glasses. They're called zoomies. This is a recent call. It's pretty great. All right. Let's see. Can we can we do one?

18:50.320 --> 18:55.560
I'll do one. Here we go. Do you want live? All right. Do you want me to work at Halliburton or zoomie? How about zoomies?

18:55.560 --> 19:00.840
Okay, that's less political. Okay. Here's my phone. Here's my zoomies. The zoomies are goggles. What are they?

19:00.840 --> 19:03.120
They're like goggles that you can wear. They're like

19:06.080 --> 19:12.920
They're like binoculars that you can wear they're binoculars that you can wear hands-free so you can like oh look at that

19:12.920 --> 19:14.920
I can touch myself while look at it

19:15.920 --> 19:17.920
What am I looking at where I'm wearing?

19:17.920 --> 19:20.620
I think they're meant for like people who are creeps

19:22.120 --> 19:25.520
So just just just high vision void voyeur

19:26.320 --> 19:31.600
Goggles just binoculars you wear it as a strap right because you know you can't binoculars are heavy you have to hold on to them

19:31.600 --> 19:37.240
I think these ones are these are hands-free binoculars so you can so you can Joe you can pull out your J.O. Tool

19:38.240 --> 19:42.560
Okay, all right, so I got my phone. I got my zoomie catalog and I got my

19:42.560 --> 19:47.680
Hello zoomie. Oh, hi, how's it going there?

19:48.760 --> 19:51.600
Yes, can I help you customer service department? Yeah

19:52.800 --> 19:57.400
Yeah, I'm I'm I'm really into these whole things here that you got going on

19:57.400 --> 20:01.440
I'm just wondering can I wear them when I drive is that okay?

20:01.960 --> 20:08.440
Well, we don't recommend any usage for them other than just looking at things while you're sitting in a chair, okay?

20:08.440 --> 20:15.600
Okay, well, I don't have any chairs. I don't what is that exactly? I think it's a she don't have any chairs

20:15.840 --> 20:18.760
Yeah, I don't have any. What kind of phone call is this?

Quality insurance. What kind of phone call is this?

21:07.280 --> 21:09.280

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Southern guy on the phone now. I

21:12.720 --> 21:18.160
Have my son call you for a minute cuz he was trying to figure out get something me for birthday

21:18.160 --> 21:31.560
But now he does know where to do it. Dan Dan what do cover commander? Okay?

21:31.560 --> 21:38.160
Well, I just want to like do it to look at birds and things we're trying to like go on a vacation this year going down to

21:38.760 --> 21:40.760
Pick a snorler

21:41.400 --> 21:43.400
Do you know okay?

21:43.400 --> 21:46.920
Yeah, thank you, Johnny Pemberton everybody

21:49.520 --> 21:53.720
So there's prank phone calls and there's guests and yeah, but you're

21:54.560 --> 22:00.080
You're like like you're an anarchist, right? Like like when you yeah, you can say that. Yeah

22:00.320 --> 22:05.200
You don't believe in hierarchy like me like I want to go to the moon and I want to create a society

22:05.840 --> 22:09.280
Whether no one's in charge. So sort of like

22:09.280 --> 22:12.920
Like a like a it's like a randish

22:13.560 --> 22:16.680
Randish, it's an randish. I'm randish. I

22:17.680 --> 22:22.800
Yeah, it's not like a it's itch. I haven't read her. Yeah, but you can still say

22:25.800 --> 22:30.920
It's not like she's kind of the heroine of the libertarian party, isn't she? Yeah, she's like the scapegoat

22:30.920 --> 22:33.840
I feel like as well, but libertarian that's sort of like oh

22:34.480 --> 22:38.080
God made rich people rich and let's let's all have it out

22:38.080 --> 22:44.040
I don't really it's like those Koch brothers. They consider themselves libertarians, but they've become so rich

22:44.040 --> 22:47.880
They've become the very thing they wanted to stop having happened

22:47.880 --> 22:53.880
I feel like no, that's the thing like like rich white guys like grew up whose dads grew up in trailer parks like me like you

22:53.880 --> 22:56.760
Bootstrappers like that's that's sort of part of the problem

22:56.760 --> 23:02.720
You become a libertarian because that's the way you cope with with wealth like like and it's the it is the easiest route to do

23:02.720 --> 23:06.400
It you you go like well the system works for me

23:06.400 --> 23:09.280
Teddy Roosevelt the system worked for me

23:10.080 --> 23:15.560
The system worked for me the creators of South Park like like we we rose up through the thing

23:15.560 --> 23:17.120
So it must work for everybody

23:17.120 --> 23:21.040
So anybody complaining is as guilty as anybody oppressing the people complaining

23:21.040 --> 23:24.400
They say they don't like government, but the corporations and the free market man

23:24.400 --> 23:28.480
They become the government. Yeah, it's like the world should be run by Ford Motors and GE and stuff like that

23:28.480 --> 23:30.720
Which is kind of already is like it's like they love

23:31.680 --> 23:33.360
Liberty, but they hate

23:33.360 --> 23:39.280
Society, I don't I don't I don't get it. I went to somehow because a friend of mine is involved with Reason magazine

23:39.280 --> 23:42.720
And he was doing some things so I was at this like convention in Vegas

23:42.720 --> 23:49.160
There was a big libertarian convention and my big problem just from looking at it is like and I actually said to somebody said

23:49.160 --> 23:53.640
Can I give you guys one note on your movement like if you're gonna try to like make this an actual movement?

23:55.320 --> 23:57.320
Less white guys and chinos

23:58.360 --> 24:01.320
Like you have to get a couple ladies in here and maybe a black dude

24:01.320 --> 24:07.520
Because it's a bunch of white D bags walking around the same pants in the same shirt with the same cuff links and talking about how

24:07.800 --> 24:15.080
Money is the world's greatest thing. It's the capitalism is fucking amazing. It's as amazing as sexual reproduction in biology

24:15.120 --> 24:19.160
It's it's taking an organism and cutting it in half and saying ladies on the left

24:19.320 --> 24:23.880
Fellows of the right and before you know it. You're not relying on like mutation to

24:24.440 --> 24:30.760
Change the species. It's fantastic, but it's not something you should base like society everything on yeah

24:30.760 --> 24:35.160
And everything because because you when you step over a homeless dude on the sidewalk

24:35.440 --> 24:41.960
You're you're the reason you're doing it is because there's absolutely nothing to profit you and stepping over him

24:42.040 --> 24:46.600
That is so obviously we have a system that right or wrong

24:47.120 --> 24:55.240
Good or bad. Well, whatever your definition is what we know for sure is that there's some dudes on the sidewalk that it's not working for

24:55.400 --> 24:59.480
Because unless that guy loves the sidewalk loves it so much

24:59.480 --> 25:05.600
Well, he's kissing it. I'm like but but even still it doesn't work because there's a sidewalk the guy that

25:05.840 --> 25:11.000
It's a sidewalk outside a donut shop and the guy's going get out of my sidewalk. You stop kissing it

25:11.000 --> 25:14.160
You love it so much. Get out of here bringing the value of the donuts down

25:14.160 --> 25:19.440
Yeah, exactly like no one wants to step over you to buy a donut. You're lowering the value of my donut shop

25:20.000 --> 25:27.400
There's capitalism as an engine, but it's not the chassis. It's not the axle. It's not the tires, you know

25:27.400 --> 25:31.800
That's like make sure it makes it go fast. It's it's it's incredibly

25:32.360 --> 25:36.240
Ingenious because it capitalism simply is an agreement. We all make every day

25:36.240 --> 25:41.800
We wake up and decide that we should let's all go sell our practical activity and what we get back

25:42.240 --> 25:45.480
Is like less than what our actual activity is worth

25:45.760 --> 25:48.360
So if we go out and make cars for eight hours a day

25:48.640 --> 25:53.960
We don't get paid in the amount the cars that we made were worth because that wouldn't make any money for the for the

25:53.960 --> 25:59.720
Capitalists so we they we're gonna pay you a lot less than what the car is worth and that free part of our labor

25:59.720 --> 26:04.440
Which is almost all of it. That's what makes cap that that's capitalism. We've all just agreed

26:04.440 --> 26:07.400
We agree every morning when we get up. Let's all just go sell

26:07.880 --> 26:11.600
Activity are our most of our day and we only if you actually have a real job

26:11.600 --> 26:13.600
You only get a couple hours of your day to do anything

26:14.240 --> 26:17.520
That you want to do that's it's insane. Maybe not at all

26:17.520 --> 26:24.200
And they are and yeah, if you have you know, like you have a couple hours to to dispense with your family or make a model airplane

26:24.200 --> 26:26.200
Yeah, it's like a dick. It's dangerous

26:27.080 --> 26:34.120
There's a solution capitalism doesn't have to be scrapped Johnny Pemberton told a story on Doug and Dressel podcast Johnny Pemberton goes in

26:34.560 --> 26:36.160
for an audition

26:36.160 --> 26:38.680
There's this whole existing system that

26:40.080 --> 26:44.400
Results in people treating everyone like crap down to the bottom

26:44.400 --> 26:50.960
So you walk in this fluorescent lit fucking tiny office with some lady that knows nothing about acting knows nothing about anything

26:51.160 --> 26:57.120
But but but is sitting there like a troll under a bridge treating actors like shit. This is a thing in LA

26:57.120 --> 27:01.120
You're sitting you're listening in Iowa and you're going fuck you your actors got it so bad

27:01.360 --> 27:08.240
We're telling you this is the equivalent of welding a fucking thing in LA every every town as its industry

27:08.240 --> 27:10.240
There's a lot of people like

27:11.200 --> 27:12.160
Suffering out here

27:12.160 --> 27:16.000
So Johnny walks into he tells the story on Duncan's podcast

27:16.000 --> 27:22.240
He walks in and he starts talking. There's a lady talking to another guy. They're talking talking. He sees another guy

27:22.240 --> 27:27.840
They're talking and he hears something and she's going there's no talking in here and he goes. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that

27:28.480 --> 27:29.840
you

27:29.840 --> 27:33.240
You guys were talking so it was okay to talk in here and then the other guy goes

27:34.000 --> 27:36.280
that's a good way to talk to casting and

27:36.280 --> 27:43.400
And long story short the story ends with you dropping your script on the ground and saying fuck you and walking away

27:43.920 --> 27:45.920
That's how capitalism works

27:47.680 --> 27:49.680
Capitalism can work

27:49.880 --> 27:52.500
Every time you get a call from a from a telemarketer

27:53.240 --> 28:00.560
Capitalism could work if the people calling you like cold calling you to go if if they bothered to go fuck you

28:00.560 --> 28:06.520
There's a limit. There's a limit to my humanity. Anyways, I've done. I sound like a libertarian when I say that

28:07.320 --> 28:11.840
It's okay to be a little bit libertarian, isn't it? I think I think that's spirit

28:11.840 --> 28:15.000
Yeah, yeah, but I think when you have a billion dollars and you're a libertarian

28:15.000 --> 28:18.400
You should probably like start to become a Democrat. She started church. I

28:19.880 --> 28:23.400
Know I think when you're like in the stratosphere as a libertarian

28:23.400 --> 28:27.160
You should probably realize a lot of what libertarians I've talked to say it sounds like kind of stuff

28:27.160 --> 28:32.000
I believe in like like like I I don't like government. I hate the idea of like arbitrary like, you know

28:32.000 --> 28:36.560
Like rule and stuff like that that but they stop short of the idea like like they worship money

28:36.560 --> 28:44.160
They worship the they worship capitalism and so they they talk this kind of high and mighty idealism about like we should all just be

28:45.040 --> 28:47.480
Liberty man like like no one should tell you ever what to do

28:47.480 --> 28:52.360
But it's like capitalism was the whole point of this it tells everybody what to do and this necessitates unemployment

28:52.360 --> 28:58.880
There has to be unemployed people. There has to be famine. There has to be a conflict at all times to keep profits

28:58.880 --> 29:04.400
There has to be we have to let more food rot every day that is needed to feed everybody every day to keep fucking grain prices at the

29:04.400 --> 29:10.760
Same place. That's insanity. That's that's a chaotic. That's a chaotic idea. And so fuck libertarian. This is what I'm trying to say

29:12.040 --> 29:15.080
Yeah, and fuck ain't rant fuck ain't rant

29:15.800 --> 29:17.800
your book sucks

29:17.800 --> 29:22.760
She's she is nobody likes the fountain head unless they're a cock and like it's 13 and they're fucking this like no

29:22.760 --> 29:24.240
It's not a good book

29:24.240 --> 29:29.360
She is dead though. So, huh? She's she died. Yeah, well, she yeah, she has she had a good time. She had a good run

29:29.360 --> 29:31.360
Let's go dig her up and fuck it. You know what?

29:32.440 --> 29:37.520
Just show me what you act. Let's do it. Yeah, she had she had terrible teeth. Did she really? Yeah, so

29:38.160 --> 29:40.760
Let's see. I thought you I thought you were ready for the underdog

29:41.320 --> 29:44.480
Well, I don't consider those teeth to be underdog teeth

29:44.480 --> 29:48.720
Would you rather fuck iran's corpse or be a member of al-qaeda?

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
al-qaeda

29:52.040 --> 29:54.040
All right

29:54.040 --> 30:22.560
I feel like I feel like every time I've seen Johnny Pemberton. He has decreased in age by three years. I

30:22.560 --> 30:27.360
Don't know. He's keeps he looks cutting his hair shorter. He looked to be about 15

30:27.360 --> 30:30.560
He was a channel 101 kid like a million years ago

30:30.560 --> 30:36.920
And I was like I just kind of got the Michael Sarah adorable thing going and then Michael Sarah now it looks like Michael Cain

30:38.960 --> 30:44.600
And Johnny Pemberton weeded it out. It was like I remember the first time I saw it Pemberton

30:44.600 --> 30:47.520
I was like fuck. He must be so pissed about Michael Sarah

30:47.520 --> 30:53.420
But now it's it's a million years later fucking Michael Sarah. It looks like a Loch Ness monster

30:55.280 --> 31:00.920
Pemberton's got the fucking lockdown on the adorable little baby face. You said that Michael Sarah has aged poorly

31:03.920 --> 31:07.880
He no longer looks like Johnny Pemberton. What can we say? Let's leave it at that

31:11.440 --> 31:13.360
There was a point when they looked the same to me

31:13.360 --> 31:18.480
Is that okay? I guess I don't see enough of Michael Sarah walking around. Well, well our next guest

31:19.960 --> 31:24.160
There's Michael Sarah. That'd be so awesome. Yeah, that was a walker

31:26.840 --> 31:30.520
He looks like the Loch Ness monster nobody knows what the Loch Ness monster looks like

31:33.760 --> 31:35.760
Terrible analogy

31:35.760 --> 31:45.600
I don't know people people grow old and they die. We're gonna go to we're gonna go to Loch Ness around the holidays

31:45.600 --> 31:51.080
Yeah, we're taking a trip to Scotland and we're gonna go we're gonna go to Infernescent. Do we have any moon?

31:53.480 --> 31:59.120
Problems that need to be discussed that the subreddit Jeff was a buzz about Lisette

32:00.160 --> 32:02.760
Yeah, it's Lisette here. Yes. Hello

32:02.760 --> 32:04.760
Lisette

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Welcome back. Yeah

32:07.160 --> 32:09.840
Let's show last week kind of seems like a month ago

32:09.840 --> 32:16.360
I never I didn't quite understand why like the room turned on on Lisette like that. I got funky. I think they didn't like her

32:20.400 --> 32:24.520
Cool reason to like chant someone down and I will I will immediately say like I

32:25.360 --> 32:31.280
Because a lot of the if you go through the subreddit online like a lot of the sentiment is like why didn't Dan do something?

32:31.280 --> 32:36.280
He's the mayor and I'll tell you why I was bored with the topic of like what was going on

32:36.280 --> 32:38.960
I wanted to play just dragons, but moreover

32:40.000 --> 32:43.360
Like I was sort of like how do you how do you resolve something like this?

32:43.400 --> 32:51.120
Like there's this mob rule emerging and I think what happened is it's la and like she said something that was like technically not

32:51.640 --> 32:54.280
appropriate to you know, it's like I

32:55.280 --> 32:57.760
absolutely everybody that sort of voiced a

32:57.760 --> 33:03.840
Oh, that's not true. What you're saying isn't true. It's an outdated thing and it's gone on too long

33:03.840 --> 33:08.800
It's got too much momentum and there was was it you ma'am. Sorry. I have asked burgers, but yeah, okay

33:08.800 --> 33:16.960
You you you stood up and identified yourself and you said you spoke very eloquently as an individual as an individual would you said like okay, so

33:18.720 --> 33:21.240
This is a stereotype that proceeds, you know

33:21.240 --> 33:26.960
a straight people like like constantly look at gay people and say

33:27.840 --> 33:32.160
There's there's a dude and a girl within every gay relationship

33:32.160 --> 33:37.520
And it's probably enough time is passed to put put it, you know, hold that that

33:37.960 --> 33:41.800
The puppy of that misconceptions face into its own urine, but

33:42.520 --> 33:44.880
But that's what you're doing. It's like

33:44.880 --> 33:51.640
It's over it doesn't I mean like there was a kind of a thing happened the last

33:52.280 --> 33:56.640
Week that was that I don't think has ever happened at Harmon's. Yeah, somebody got booed

33:57.360 --> 34:03.920
Chanted down happens so suddenly to it's like a switch was thrown and all of a sudden was that what they were really chanting was let it go

34:04.240 --> 34:06.560
Because they wanted her to stop talking

34:07.360 --> 34:09.360
They weren't they weren't saying

34:09.360 --> 34:15.680
Uh, think differently. They were going let it go. Was that what's your take on the whole thing? How do you feel it all went down?

34:17.720 --> 34:19.720
Let it go

34:21.360 --> 34:25.600
Do you want to come up should we get it get her up and let her say a couple words there? Hey, yeah, let's have that come up

34:30.280 --> 34:35.840
As a talk about her this is a little keg of dynamite. Hello, is that

34:35.840 --> 34:46.920
So what the thing that you were going to say was anecdotal things about how you you well whatever say was say what you were gonna say

34:49.440 --> 34:56.560
Wait, which part well when they remember when the audience started going boo, let it go. Let it go. Stop talking

34:56.600 --> 35:02.600
We hate you stop talking. I guess I guess the only point I wanted to get across was

35:02.600 --> 35:04.360
Um

35:04.360 --> 35:06.360
Regardless of where you come from

35:06.360 --> 35:08.360
nothing like that

35:08.880 --> 35:16.200
You know, it's funny about weddings because I actually did work at a wedding shop and I I saw some people are a little bit more

35:16.400 --> 35:18.400
about weddings as far as a

35:18.800 --> 35:23.320
Some people are just let they let one person do more work than the other

35:23.800 --> 35:28.520
Regardless of who it is, you know, that kind of thing. That's not that's not a gender thing

35:28.520 --> 35:34.120
Personality type that was a more of the ideal topic. That's ideally. That's what I wanted to say

35:35.440 --> 35:38.040
We I think we went over that but how do you feel emotionally after that?

35:38.040 --> 35:39.760
I was that was that a was that a weird experience for you?

35:39.760 --> 35:41.320
No, this was like the best week of my life

35:41.320 --> 35:47.240
But not because of like what happened here just other things that in my life was like this has been a really great week for me

35:47.240 --> 35:51.760
But I I tend not to let things bother me at all. I'm not that kind of person. Okay. Yeah

35:52.240 --> 35:55.520
Well, I think people resented that a little bit. That's what I truly think

35:55.520 --> 36:01.880
I want to say this like I think that like clearly because I listen to the thing and I listen to the podcast when I drive into work

36:01.880 --> 36:05.400
And I'm listening to it and I'm like, oh, that's I do feel I have remorse

36:05.400 --> 36:09.880
I feel I feel bad if I did offend anyone obviously. Yeah, everybody that talks into a microphone

36:09.880 --> 36:12.560
Like can look listen to it afterwards and go oh shit

36:12.560 --> 36:19.920
I wish I could have taken like that Peter Parker like 45 minutes of like bullet time to think exactly about what to say

36:19.920 --> 36:23.720
And we all embarrass ourselves a leg leg leg leg, but but I think that you

36:23.720 --> 36:25.720
Okay

36:26.480 --> 36:28.480
Thank you. Thank you, Lizette

36:29.200 --> 36:33.360
Here's the thing that the whole thing that kind of avalanche it on me that night

36:33.360 --> 36:35.200
It was like it was no time to talk about it at all

36:35.200 --> 36:40.360
But I what I wanted to say to the planet at that moment was

36:42.040 --> 36:47.240
We have gone so far with like it's okay to be black it's okay to be gay

36:47.240 --> 36:51.520
It's okay to be in a wheelchair. It's okay to have one arm. It's okay to have three arms

36:51.520 --> 36:54.080
It's okay to have purple hair. It's okay to have six eyes

36:54.080 --> 36:55.680
It's okay to have one eye

36:55.680 --> 37:00.480
Like we are trying as hard as we can to keep each other from keeping each other down

37:00.480 --> 37:02.600
It's okay to wear a notebook around here. Yes

37:04.040 --> 37:10.320
The only thing that was up like is there going to come a point where it's okay to be ignorant

37:10.840 --> 37:12.600
Where it's okay

37:12.600 --> 37:14.600
to be shitty

37:14.600 --> 37:20.640
Because if we don't if we don't make that bridge we ain't got no hope man

37:21.640 --> 37:25.600
There's a word for groups of people who know it's okay to have six eyes

37:26.800 --> 37:28.800
They're called six-eyed people

37:29.880 --> 37:36.520
They exist in a fucking ghetto of six-eyed people if they don't like like like our way like this movement that we have

37:36.640 --> 37:42.760
That's like like like let's all realize that our sexual preference our race our height our hair color

37:42.760 --> 37:48.080
Everything doesn't matter. We're we're we've gotten to the point where we are storming the Bastille

37:48.600 --> 37:51.080
Like every time Bill Maher opens his mouth

37:52.560 --> 37:59.920
All I all I hear is the fucking hammers cocking on the red states like like like shotguns like

38:00.200 --> 38:06.400
They're like is there a way to reach out to these people and hug them and like like isn't there a way to make ourselves attractive?

38:07.080 --> 38:10.360
to people that are bummed out that are

38:10.360 --> 38:14.160
Apprehensive about becoming part of the Borg cube

38:16.600 --> 38:23.120
Are we are we just gonna shout at everybody that isn't as open-minded as us is that was is that what we're gonna do?

38:23.680 --> 38:27.920
Is that how we're going to achieve revolution? Are we just going to shout at people?

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
No, we shouldn't

38:31.720 --> 38:33.720
Right so so so when you

38:34.160 --> 38:39.160
When you run into someone on the street, and they go like I think black people aren't as tall as white people

38:39.160 --> 38:41.160
Are you are you going to?

38:41.880 --> 38:45.520
What are you gonna do to that guy? Are you gonna hit him in the head with a brick?

38:48.800 --> 38:53.560
I would give I would give him a hug or something and be like no was that would give him a hug. No

38:54.240 --> 39:01.120
No, you would know it would be more like no no no no black people are just as tall as white people I

39:01.120 --> 39:08.280
Just want to know you just compare black people to six-eyed people and ignorant people

39:09.040 --> 39:11.040
You put them in the same category of

39:11.560 --> 39:17.880
Disability no, I didn't you said it's okay to be black. It's okay to be gay. It's okay to be a mutant

39:21.360 --> 39:24.480
You gave black people the right to be okay about being crazy

39:24.480 --> 39:25.640
I

39:25.640 --> 39:27.000
Don't know what you're talking about

39:27.000 --> 39:34.280
But I know one thing that every every thing that we talk about we're trying to move forward into a Roddenberry universe

39:34.280 --> 39:40.440
Where there is no such thing as hierarchy and the way we're trying to accomplish it is

39:41.000 --> 39:47.480
We're trying to use the tools that the old world used. We are trying to march on

39:47.480 --> 39:56.880
Washington we are trying to show people that mob rule like works that those were the tools that they showed us

39:57.480 --> 39:59.840
Are effective though that was the justification

40:00.400 --> 40:05.520
Do you really think that we're gonna enter a world where there's so many?

40:06.280 --> 40:13.160
Transgendered 16 year olds that they finally gonna vote in Congress or do you think the more objective pragmatic

40:13.160 --> 40:19.180
Perpa Jigol should be for us to arrive at a point of consciousness where we stop judging people for who they

40:19.680 --> 40:24.940
These these things that have nothing to do with with the streets getting cleaned and the and the economy being

40:25.840 --> 40:33.680
Balance it's it that we weird they have they have trapped us in this rats maze like they tell us that oh, oh, yeah

40:33.680 --> 40:40.120
You I'm sure you'd love a handicap ramp at the YMCA you go get six more cripples and talk to me later

40:40.120 --> 40:43.200
It's bullshit. It's fucking horseshit

40:43.840 --> 40:50.640
Capitalism is wrong because a dollar ends up being worth more than some human being that you're stepping over

40:50.640 --> 40:55.880
That's it a crowd if a crowd of a group full of people intelligent people like this audience here decided

40:55.880 --> 41:00.280
They don't like what's going on on stage. They have every right to go boo. Fuck that like no, they don't no

41:00.280 --> 41:04.840
They don't they have every right to do it, but I think they're assholes

41:05.400 --> 41:07.400
That's bullying

41:07.400 --> 41:15.680
Oh, I'm used to that. I've been bullied my whole life. It's I think that a crowd that booze is like

41:15.680 --> 41:19.280
It's taking part in something. I don't think people weren't linking arms and I said cool

41:19.280 --> 41:23.040
Can we can we pillory her can we can we can we can we can we burn her at the stake like it wasn't that

41:23.040 --> 41:26.640
It was like fucking I'm using that you actually you should be pillory. Yeah. No, okay

41:27.800 --> 41:29.640
kinky

41:29.640 --> 41:32.560
Nobody nobody here was being a villain out in the audience

41:32.560 --> 41:35.680
They all agreed as one and they didn't like it was what was for sale on stage

41:35.680 --> 41:41.280
I think that's that's healthy and fine, right? It's healthy and fine to take part in a large group of people

41:42.040 --> 41:44.360
Saying the same thing in unison chanting it at people

41:44.960 --> 41:50.520
If everybody is an agreement people were going along with that swept up in the commotion and the emotion of a mob

41:50.520 --> 41:55.200
And that's not okay, but it wasn't I think there were you know 15 20 people in the audience going like now

41:55.200 --> 42:00.640
I don't like it like fucking move it along. I think we're not gonna get anything ever done here

42:00.640 --> 42:05.800
But you can't you can't you can't mandate that this audience doesn't have the right to ever go fuck. No, you're right. You're right

42:05.800 --> 42:10.200
I can't mandate that you're right. I can't say you don't have the right to boo

42:10.200 --> 42:11.920
There are things that you could do on the stage

42:11.920 --> 42:14.880
It could absolutely alienate and bum everybody out in this room

42:14.880 --> 42:18.840
There's things that you could go too far and you could piss people off and they have the freedom on the right to say

42:18.840 --> 42:23.280
That's fucking bullshit and let's throw shit at that guy like that's that's that's that's totally

42:23.800 --> 42:29.880
Fair and I think I think what happened was weird last week because all of a sudden as one that everyone just like turned on you

42:29.880 --> 42:34.680
Was that it was it was it was like it was a strange like like dynamic that just went boom and all of a sudden you were

42:35.240 --> 42:41.240
Like like I said I admit I had said something that was a little you know that it was not appropriate

42:41.240 --> 42:46.520
I should have revised my speech and say it reflect my opinion in a way that was more diplomatic

42:47.160 --> 42:49.840
Obviously and I like I said I never meant to offend anyone

42:50.000 --> 42:52.760
But had I just been given five more seconds

42:52.760 --> 42:57.320
I would have explained myself and I would have been like actually what I meant to say was and it would have been fine

42:57.320 --> 43:01.720
No, I don't I thought I think I don't think you would have I think you would have upset them work

43:02.720 --> 43:07.760
That's the thing like it's about the it's about the booing and the chanting and all that shit

43:07.760 --> 43:08.680
That's all I mean

43:08.680 --> 43:14.480
I don't like like this hero worship this idea that we have to find the person that says the right things

43:14.480 --> 43:18.800
We have to lift them up like it just yeah, I mean if it makes anyone feel better

43:18.800 --> 43:23.360
I have never said the right thing ever in my life and they're I'm probably never will so that only makes me human

43:23.360 --> 43:29.920
But I hope I hope I hope you feel my pain. Let's feel as it's pain. Thank you for coming up

43:34.120 --> 43:36.120
Let's chant her off stage everybody

43:36.120 --> 43:38.120
Oh

43:48.680 --> 43:52.240
What's that guy's name Greg all right cuz I wrote it down

43:53.800 --> 43:55.800
All right, let's bring Spencer up

43:55.800 --> 44:07.320
Hello Spencer the inventor of I Harmon or a chest note so whatever you want to call it

44:07.680 --> 44:09.680
Do you have a name for your invention Spencer? I

44:10.360 --> 44:15.600
If I were to like write in permanent marker on the cover, I would write Harmon's brain

44:17.160 --> 44:19.200
Harmon's right. Yeah, just cuz that's what it does

44:19.200 --> 44:22.800
But if you wanted to market this invention to other people that I wouldn't you wouldn't

44:22.800 --> 44:26.000
marketing's just lies

44:29.040 --> 44:34.480
Speaking of marketing I would want to point out that the I Harmon mock mock three is

44:35.440 --> 44:39.240
Equipped with paracord which can support up to three hundred thirty pounds

44:39.360 --> 44:44.240
So that can save someone's life or maybe you know strangle a foe. Yeah

44:45.520 --> 44:50.720
Like the idea that if I die someone can take it off my neck and they can know what I was working on when I yeah

44:50.720 --> 44:55.040
But also if somebody wanted to murder Dan, he's already got it. I didn't want yeah, he's already got it

44:55.040 --> 44:57.040
He's already got a strangled

44:58.520 --> 45:02.920
Seems counterintuitive to get my my employer killed. There's a built-in

45:03.240 --> 45:09.120
There's a built-in drunken meter which the subreddit has requested because you can see from my head handwriting

45:09.280 --> 45:14.720
The like at the bottom of this page. It just says in this weird serial killer scrawl. I do what I want

45:14.720 --> 45:16.720
I

45:19.560 --> 45:22.400
It starts at the top with like cat litter

45:23.240 --> 45:27.360
Dog food and then at the bottom. It says I do what I want you can barely read it

45:28.160 --> 45:30.160
Greg

45:31.040 --> 45:36.120
That's something that that's something that a phone can't store is the the manic energy

45:37.000 --> 45:40.680
So you feel that the the the convenience of having this always around your neck out

45:40.680 --> 45:45.280
Outweighs the awkwardness of having that around your neck at all times. No, I'll get through it

45:45.280 --> 45:48.840
I mean, I there's an awkward. I don't think I am I don't think this lasts very long

45:48.840 --> 45:52.360
My prediction is you don't stick to this for very long. I'm not gonna let that affect how long I wear

45:52.880 --> 45:57.520
Nor should I'm just saying I put it out there. I don't think you would be affected by this

45:57.520 --> 46:02.520
I think that this this is a thing. It's a passing fancy broken through a threshold, you know, like what's his name?

46:02.520 --> 46:09.520
A star star counter. What's his name? Stephen Hawking? Oh?

46:13.080 --> 46:17.360
He was a heavy drinker party guy like I saw a documentary about him like he

46:18.000 --> 46:21.320
Fucked around like he was he was smart and he had a good time

46:21.320 --> 46:25.840
And then one day he was like hanging out like I'll see you later. I'm gonna smash that bus

46:25.840 --> 46:28.240
I'll see you and then and then he like

46:28.240 --> 46:33.560
Tumbled down some stairs and went to a doctor and they said you got you got a disease

46:33.560 --> 46:39.400
You're you're a balloon and you're gonna deflate and you're in the clocks ticking and he went

46:39.400 --> 46:41.440
I got a I got some shit to do now

46:41.440 --> 46:47.800
He was very young when he got that wake-up call and he obviously all of humanity has benefited from him doing that

46:47.800 --> 46:54.960
I'm just a 40 year old hack like I just I just want to like I clearly I could feel my brain has gotten to a point where

46:54.960 --> 47:01.760
I'm not thinking anything. It's gonna help anybody anymore. I just it's gonna like like like you know like the guy in

47:02.280 --> 47:05.760
Wearing a notebook around your neck certainly sends off a message of you give up

47:07.440 --> 47:11.520
There's a surrender a kind of white flag being waved. Yeah, exactly

47:11.520 --> 47:15.840
So wait flagged every 25 year old writer like come up to me and go like like what should I do?

47:19.640 --> 47:21.640
My brain don't work no more

47:21.640 --> 47:27.200
Yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna yeah, I'm gonna go out like practical

47:27.720 --> 47:33.600
Like if I could turn my shoe into a phone, I'd do it. I don't know if that was practical. Yeah, is that practical?

47:34.600 --> 47:36.600
Spencer, I don't know yet

47:37.440 --> 47:43.440
I'm gonna find out I came to you with this idea. This was here. I didn't you helped me with this. Oh, yeah, I

47:46.120 --> 47:48.400
Mean, I don't know what else to say about it

47:48.400 --> 47:54.200
It's why don't you have one of these because I have well, I have a green moleskin thing that I have

47:55.040 --> 47:57.760
So I have one. I just don't have it around my neck

47:58.840 --> 48:04.040
The important thing about this is it's fast. Yeah, no, that's I designed it that way

48:08.320 --> 48:14.680
That was that was literally I guess I'm just more of a of a superficial fashion conscious guy

48:14.680 --> 48:19.440
You're behind me right on this, right? Yeah, I think it's probably one of the best methods

48:19.440 --> 48:22.280
You could do it because it was like you're illustrating with your phone

48:22.280 --> 48:27.720
I'd say, you know, it's kind of like a camera and that you know your note taking device is the one you have with you

48:27.720 --> 48:32.640
So that's always with you. Yeah, but you know, it's it's hard to have your phone out all the time

48:32.640 --> 48:36.680
But I'd say the phone's the best, but if you're not gonna use your phone, that's better

48:36.680 --> 48:41.800
It seems a bit like a social barrier though. Maybe that's maybe maybe that's part of your subconscious

48:41.800 --> 48:45.100
Like a charm of this. It's an icebreaker. I'm hanging out with you

48:46.600 --> 48:52.840
I'm hanging out with me now. It's Benicio del Toro gonna be like, oh, it's done harm it. Oh, like, like, oh

48:54.120 --> 48:59.080
Oh god, the friendship that never ended. Like, like, come on. I got you and I got a rock

49:00.600 --> 49:02.360
I got a dog

49:02.360 --> 49:04.360
I hang out with you and now you got a big

49:05.320 --> 49:11.080
Hey, yeah, can you handle it and what we were we were having drinks earlier on you spent half the time looking at your little notepad

49:11.080 --> 49:13.640
It's just it's just a toy that you can not let make eye contact

49:14.280 --> 49:18.680
Down. Yeah. Yeah, just like no sometimes you weren't you just looking through your thing

49:19.000 --> 49:25.000
It's just a way to make less eye contact. So you're enforcing your your lack of ability to connect with people

49:25.240 --> 49:29.560
He's doing it right now. He's doing it right now. I'm looking up stuff that I was writing down when you're talking

49:29.640 --> 49:33.880
You're just getting you're just you're just shy. You're just you're you're terrible about being with other people

49:34.920 --> 49:37.640
You're you're terrible about being with me. Thank you

49:37.640 --> 49:39.640
You

49:39.800 --> 49:41.080
Hey

49:41.080 --> 49:47.080
Where do you get those notepads Jeff these ones? Yeah, um, look at that. That's I went to two staples

49:47.080 --> 49:50.440
They didn't have anything so I got that one and I cut it with a paper cutter

49:53.560 --> 49:56.440
These are from duane. I don't know do any paper

49:57.560 --> 50:02.040
And I there's a gift shop and sort of like I'll buy you a pack that they're okay. That's awesome. They're good

50:02.040 --> 50:08.600
I just want to do a quick quick quick lightning at Harmontown like quick guest spot. Okay. We just do this real quick

50:08.600 --> 50:10.600
Oh, yeah, can I bring up my neighbors?

50:11.160 --> 50:12.520
absolutely

50:12.520 --> 50:14.520
Dan and Beth Bootson

50:14.520 --> 50:16.520
Bootsons

50:20.440 --> 50:22.040
Can I put

50:22.040 --> 50:27.080
Unless unless you guys don't want to come up just want to do a quick. Hello. Hello, Beth

50:27.080 --> 50:29.080
Yeah

50:31.160 --> 50:34.200
Dan and Beth Bootson their last name is

50:37.160 --> 50:42.600
Are these are these the same Bootsons that you uh, that you said disparaging things about in the previous podcast

50:42.760 --> 50:45.400
It's a disparaging. Thanks. We went we went to their uh

50:46.200 --> 50:52.760
Backyard party and then we came here and then uh, yeah, I talked for for Harmontown aficionados

50:52.760 --> 50:56.920
Uh, Beth Bootson is the person I referred to as the tumor lady

51:00.440 --> 51:05.240
Who had a like you took out your iphone and you had an x-ray of your head

51:05.880 --> 51:10.280
Like a profile of it and truly am I exaggerating it was the size of a

51:10.920 --> 51:12.840
beyond the golf ball

51:12.840 --> 51:16.920
well, my I had a brain tumor last year and um

51:16.920 --> 51:25.640
Initially how it I found out I had a brain tumor was that um, I swim laps at uh in pasadena at the rose ball aquatic center

51:26.040 --> 51:28.040
And I had a seizure in the pool

51:28.120 --> 51:33.560
And what does the seizure feel like like or what happens? It was the very first time I'd ever had one

51:33.560 --> 51:37.400
It's the only one I've ever had but um, I can remember

51:38.360 --> 51:43.720
Um, and it happened so quickly it almost feels like you're passing out except I can remember that

51:43.720 --> 51:47.480
I felt like um, like I didn't have control of my limbs

51:48.280 --> 51:50.280
and um, and luckily I was

51:51.640 --> 51:56.920
Swimming on my back in the water and um, there was the lifeguard exchange

51:57.000 --> 52:01.720
Which is apparently the most dangerous time for a lifeguard to even see somebody drowning

52:02.200 --> 52:07.880
Um, but apparently what do you mean like that was shift change or yes? Yes, because they're talking to each other

52:07.880 --> 52:13.880
They're just hanging out. Yeah, they're hanging out. It's hard to be a left good. Yes, and

52:15.000 --> 52:16.040
Bored Sam

52:16.040 --> 52:21.880
And there was a lifeguard that all the other lifeguards made fun of because he was the overly diligent one

52:22.200 --> 52:24.200
And he's the one who happened to see me

52:24.600 --> 52:26.600
Drowning flailing in the pool

52:26.600 --> 52:34.200
Yes, um, and it's in the it's in the competitive pool where all the swimmers that swim there are very very good swimmers

52:34.200 --> 52:38.760
So at first they thought we have a winner pay attention to the swimmers because everybody knows how to swim

52:38.840 --> 52:41.880
It's not like guarding the little kiddie pool or something like that

52:42.520 --> 52:45.080
So I had my seizure and luckily they

52:45.800 --> 52:47.800
um, saw me and

52:48.200 --> 52:53.800
They jumped in and or one of the guys jumped in well, they were all there, but one of them

52:54.440 --> 52:56.440
uh, alarmed everybody else

52:56.760 --> 53:00.120
um, the other one another one jumped in and um,

53:00.120 --> 53:04.600
um, basically pushed my head up out of the water and let me finish having my seizure Jesus

53:05.000 --> 53:08.040
Yes, and then after they got underneath you and they're like she's having a seizure

53:08.120 --> 53:10.280
They just lifted you like don't just my head

53:10.840 --> 53:12.840
So they just lifted my head up out of the water

53:12.920 --> 53:18.760
So I wouldn't take in any water and they let me finish having my seizure and uh, then they pulled me to the end

53:19.240 --> 53:25.160
They had already called the ambulance and um, I was rushed to Huntington hospital, which is about four minutes away

53:25.880 --> 53:27.880
and, um

53:27.880 --> 53:29.880
When I was there, I was

53:30.520 --> 53:36.040
I had already come to in the ambulance and um, I felt very lucky because you know how you have to

53:36.520 --> 53:43.960
Always wait for somebody to take care of you when you're in the ER. I didn't have any weight at all and um, the

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
uh, doctor walked in

53:47.080 --> 53:50.040
And he told me that it was my lucky day

53:50.680 --> 53:55.720
Because I had the chief neurologist on call that day and that was him

53:55.720 --> 53:58.440
Like the Native Native American guy, right? Yes. Yeah

53:59.320 --> 54:06.120
He says I'm I'm Dr. Kate in and I'm your and I'm the chief neurologist here and I'm gonna take care of me big chief neurologist

54:09.560 --> 54:11.560
I didn't even know that's what you do

54:11.960 --> 54:16.040
I thought you were just making it more dramatic. I thought I didn't know he was doing a pun. I thought like

54:16.680 --> 54:20.440
I thought he was making it more dramatic like it was like, uh, I think I did

54:20.920 --> 54:21.960
so

54:21.960 --> 54:26.680
So, uh, god damn it. I don't the brain tumor was very big and right now

54:26.680 --> 54:29.720
I have a hole in my brain the size of a meatball

54:30.280 --> 54:32.760
And that's the hole a size of a delicious meatball

54:33.480 --> 54:37.960
Like that's some bullshit meatball that like from from chef Boyardy like a fucking mama

54:38.760 --> 54:43.240
Yeah, are we talking are we talking italians? Are we talking meatballs? We talking like Ikea, swedish?

54:43.800 --> 54:48.200
Like bigger than a golf ball little Dom's. Oh, that's big. That's like that's like a wiffle ball size

54:48.200 --> 54:53.640
And that was I mean he took out basically about half of the tumor so half of the tumor is still in there

54:53.800 --> 54:55.800
Wait, just hanging out there?

54:55.880 --> 54:59.400
Yeah, it's in there and he didn't want to go any further

55:00.120 --> 55:04.760
He didn't want to take any more out because he was a he didn't want me to end up in a wheelchair or

55:05.800 --> 55:09.320
Talking with a drool. So is it just sitting in there? You have to go back every year?

55:09.320 --> 55:13.000
Well, I went he said he goes we're going to take care of the rest of it with cyber knife

55:14.120 --> 55:16.120
Cyber knife radiation treatment

55:16.120 --> 55:21.720
Wait, uh, can they make that sound a little more ominous? Yeah, I know a little more like gi joe

55:22.520 --> 55:24.520
Bring out cyber knife

55:28.040 --> 55:30.040
A weeks later

55:30.360 --> 55:34.040
Probably about a month later after I'd already had the surgery and stuff they took me and

55:34.920 --> 55:38.360
It's a whole procedure where there's like this big star wars gun

55:39.480 --> 55:43.720
That's in this room and they have already made a mask of your face

55:43.720 --> 55:50.840
And they basically screwed, you know, I'm in the mask and they screwed me to the table and the table's kind of moving like this and this big

55:51.640 --> 55:55.720
Star wars gun. They have to custom make the mask of your face. Yeah. Yeah, we still have it

55:55.720 --> 56:02.040
It's like a gauze except they have some liquid on it and um, because it's that precise like like so it has to be a

56:02.680 --> 56:09.400
Yes, it matches my face exactly to hold you to hold you in place or they yeah, they don't want my head moving

56:09.400 --> 56:13.800
Right while cyber knife has given you the business. Yeah, so I'm there for a whole hour

56:14.200 --> 56:17.160
I pictured you strapped to a table like james bond and goldfinger

56:19.800 --> 56:21.800
You expect me to talk chief neurologist

56:24.920 --> 56:26.920
I showed him the uh

56:26.920 --> 56:34.840
I mean it's a cartoon. It's not a video. No, it's a photos of it is a car. It's like a cartoon. It's like the MRI photos

56:34.840 --> 56:41.960
It's it's it's a human skull like for it for viewed from the side and there is a larger than golf ball

56:42.600 --> 56:44.600
perfectly round

56:44.600 --> 56:47.640
That's what's amazing is that like this cancer

56:48.520 --> 56:53.080
Still adheres to this like mine was I had a very very rare kind mine was non-cancerous

56:53.560 --> 56:58.840
But what does that mean as well? I mean that thing of it is is you could have a brain tumor that's cancerous

56:59.480 --> 57:02.920
And you might be fine. It depending on what stage they catch it in

57:02.920 --> 57:09.400
How can a tumor not be cancerous? I but you could have one that's non-cancerous and depending on where that brain tumor is

57:09.720 --> 57:11.720
If it's right here by your brain stem

57:12.200 --> 57:17.640
Here you could be dead, right? So it whether it's cancerous or non-cancerous it it

57:17.880 --> 57:22.040
Um, doesn't decide whether or not you're going to live. So you're just this lucky person that just had this jiggy

57:22.280 --> 57:26.680
I had a very very rare type of link from outer space. It was so big

57:26.760 --> 57:30.520
Yeah, they just scooped it out with a melon baller left some of it behind

57:30.520 --> 57:36.120
Yeah, and it's still in there. What did they replace that space with or they just leave a cavity in there?

57:36.280 --> 57:38.280
No, it just feels it was lived in and then

57:43.640 --> 57:49.080
But they said eventually that um all the little veins and cap cap, you know things that um

57:50.440 --> 57:52.440
Capillaries will

57:52.520 --> 57:53.320
um

57:53.320 --> 57:58.840
Make connections again, and like half my body was very weak. I was in a walker

57:58.840 --> 58:01.960
I couldn't walk for about a full month without

58:02.680 --> 58:04.600
um

58:04.600 --> 58:10.280
Falling or perhaps having a seizure. So I had uh, I was in a walker for about a month and then I eventually grew

58:11.080 --> 58:16.600
Graduated to a king. Did they ever tell you steroids? Did they retell you you might now walk again and blah blah blah?

58:16.680 --> 58:23.880
You know they're always worried about that, but um, luckily I have a very very good surgeon and um, the other thing

58:24.600 --> 58:26.600
Um, what was I going to say?

58:26.600 --> 58:32.520
It's okay. You have a hole in here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you have the ultimate out. Yeah

58:37.480 --> 58:39.480
You should have a notepad around your neck

58:40.680 --> 58:43.560
Have you ever used it to win arguments really be honest?

58:43.800 --> 58:47.320
You know what I was going to say it was because you know when they um

58:48.520 --> 58:53.080
When they said when they were going to do the surgery what they do is they usually shave your whole head

58:53.080 --> 58:58.040
But my mom and my sister were very worried about my hair. They said, you know, can't you just leave some of it?

58:58.040 --> 59:00.040
Maybe put a you know flap or something like that

59:00.440 --> 59:02.440
See if the strange thing to be worried about

59:03.080 --> 59:05.080
She has such nice hair

59:07.560 --> 59:12.920
And what my doctor was very considered he just shaved me up here on top and then they um

59:13.640 --> 59:16.680
You know cut open the scalp and roll that back

59:17.640 --> 59:21.800
Yeah, and then and then they drill he they drill into the skull

59:21.800 --> 59:25.080
Oh, and you know he wanted to put a metal plate in my head

59:25.400 --> 59:28.600
And I remember him telling me what that he was going to do that and I said

59:28.840 --> 59:33.160
I said, do you have to put the metal plate in? He says yes, because I might have to go in over and over again

59:33.560 --> 59:37.160
I said, well, just can't you just put my skull back and then if you have to go in a second time

59:37.240 --> 59:40.840
Then you'll put the metal plate in and he said, okay. I can do that

59:41.160 --> 59:43.160
Well, you can just

59:44.840 --> 59:50.680
So I do have my skull. I just pictured myself going through the airport and that beeper going up

59:50.680 --> 59:52.680
Oh, how embarrassing

59:53.960 --> 59:56.760
And also I wondered if it would affect my hair

59:56.840 --> 01:00:02.600
But that would be I would I would love that I would go like it would start beeping. I go. I had a fucking tumor

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:07.560
I know it's saunter through throw shoes at them

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:11.160
How many tumors have you had mother fucker?

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:16.360
Well, you know what and the thing of it is is I actually consider this

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.920
One of the best things that has ever happened to me

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:21.480
because I feel like I've had

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:28.680
So many gifts that have come from having the brain tumor and one of them is that

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:33.320
I have clarity as to what's important in life and what's not

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.120
and I also

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.400
What is I mean

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:44.680
Clarity like like that's that's the thing I wanted to talk to you about because we had as I told you that

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:51.240
We have seek up here is an aneurysm survivor. He's got a time bomb in his head as he like like he talks about it like

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:55.000
What is that like what what is

01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:00.840
What is it important about life? He said no spoilers. He said

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:04.840
Give more than you take. That's that's his takeaway from the whole thing

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.880
Give more than you take from life. Is there anything you can add to that? Sorry. I don't mean to well, you know

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.280
I I one of the things that I really

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:16.440
Um felt lucky to be able to experience was that um

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.640
I got to see all the love and light

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:26.680
Come in my way and most people when they have their funeral are not there to actually see that from other people or from god or

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:31.240
From from so many from everybody, you know, um

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:37.080
People thinking that you might die neighbors. Um, everybody at work. Um, my family

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:40.280
But all our other neighbors he yeah these guys

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.560
Um, I felt like I I remember

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.320
Um

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:51.160
Thinking that um, you know, I didn't really feel bad for me. I felt bad. I was really really quite worried about

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:55.000
um, my husband and my 13 year old son and

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:59.640
My parents and so you felt like you were going to possibly die

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:07.000
Right. I said yes at some point and you handled that in a way that so in that moment when you started my concern was not for me

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.320
You started to feel bad for all the people. Yeah, because I thought, you know, I'll be dead and I won't know the difference

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:14.920
My concern was for all of my um family

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:20.200
and um, especially my immediate family and even all my friends because I knew

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:26.680
There were some friends that very care very much for me and I it gives a person the um

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:30.920
And I got to see how everybody deals with their own mortality

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.560
and some people were

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.960
very open to um

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:39.080
Kind of rushed there to help or wanted to be there for me

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.040
Some just kind of holed up in a room

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:47.000
And those were very good friends and I never heard a word from them and I knew why I wasn't hearing from them

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:50.760
Yeah, they were scared. I'd probably be one of those. Yeah, I knew they were scared to death

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:56.920
Before I met you I might be one of those before I met seek. I I'm very uncomfortable with sickness and things

01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:02.280
Like I I I haven't had loved ones, you know, it's like I needed to talk to people that were cool with it

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:06.680
Yes, and then that's you know, I knew that I had to reach out to them

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:09.880
Because I knew a lot of them thought oh, she's going to end up

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.440
You know with a completely different personality

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:20.840
And maybe have half of my wits gone so to speak and that would freak them out because it wouldn't be the person they knew

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.640
um, and

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.720
So I I knew I had to call

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:29.240
Everybody and let them know that I was still me

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.960
um that

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.160
Beth

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:37.000
You know the bet they knew was still was still here

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:41.960
She did a lot of kind of work for other people. I was reaching out to other people

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.360
um, and then I think and I also saw people that

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:47.960
were

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.960
I walked into this one restaurant

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:55.560
And I'm just going to tell the story because it's how it's funny how everybody quiet for one minute

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:59.000
Let her talk. It's funny how everybody deals enough out of you, sir

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.760
It's quite enough out of you. It's funny how everybody deals with their own mortality

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:07.480
And I had walked into this one restaurant, and I'm not going to name the name because I actually love

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:12.440
I actually love their pulled pork sandwiches a lot, so I'm not going to mention their name

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:17.080
No, we go to little doms all the time. We mentioned it, but there was a woman in there and I still go there

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:19.160
I still go there despite what happened

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.960
um, I I was in my I walked in there

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.680
Um, and I had been in there before and the lady

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:27.880
I know she recognizes me

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:32.360
And um, I had walked in there and with my walker and of course I had a scarf around my head

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:36.680
And I was probably bloated because of all the medications that I was on. No, you look great

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.600
I remember those I remember that

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.000
and um

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:49.400
I walked in and I know she recognized me and because and she's seen my husband before too and um

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:51.880
I could tell she was clearly uncomfortable

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:53.720
and um

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.720
I asked her if I could use the restroom

01:04:55.720 --> 01:05:01.400
And and I had done that before even one before even had this happen to me and they were fine

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.400
she was fine with me and using the restroom before

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.920
and uh, the restroom's in the back behind the counter

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.960
um, and um, I said could I use your restroom?

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.520
And I could tell she was freaked out by me

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:15.080
And she says well, it's not um

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.320
She says it's not open to the public

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:22.040
And I said well, you know before I'd I'd she never had a problem with me using it

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:27.000
And I said well, I'm not open to yeah, yeah, and I said well, I'm not the public. I'm a customer

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.080
So I want your customer restroom

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:33.160
And and she said and she kind of just freaked out and then she says

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.040
Well, okay, but don't touch anything. What?

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:41.480
Wait, you you asked to use just the regular ladies room at the at the restaurants or or or

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:46.600
Restroom that they had there it was a restroom that they have there that I've you know

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:49.560
Every time I had visited before they didn't she didn't have a problem with it. Okay

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:53.560
Okay, so I thought not because you you seem like some sort of damaged

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:57.560
Yeah, well, I'm obviously damaged now. I think she thought that she might catch what I had

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.000
Oh, yeah, yeah

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:05.320
So I thought to myself, you know, you get to see all different ways that people deal with something

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:11.480
As you know traumatic as this. Yeah, I mean that's a huge thing like we we have

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:17.880
As a tv writer and producer like, uh, you know, like like 70s Norman Lear. He's an activist

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:21.240
He's going to make sure finally black people and white people are going to like

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:27.800
We're going to use the sitcom to overcome this thing and like now we're living in this maelstrom of like

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:34.040
What what did you say about gay people and bisexual people and transgender people and we're we're getting through all this stuff

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:40.760
And but still lingering. I think the biggest thing of all like the giant the giant elephant in the room is like

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:46.120
Somebody rolls into a room in a wheelchair and it's like I you have an instinctive reaction

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:49.720
Yeah, I wish that they weren't in a wheelchair. What are they? Yeah, well, how did they get that way?

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:52.920
That's that's completely different from from everything. It's it's interesting

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:57.000
Especially because she knew me as kind of a vital person beforehand

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:01.320
And then all of a sudden I walk in and I'm in a walker. She went home at night

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:04.920
She would there was a photo of you and she would god this woman is so vital

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:11.000
Well, you know, it's funny when you walked in with a walker. She's like my my world is well, you know

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.960
I was so outraged and my husband said well, what is your problem?

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:17.640
I and then I told him what she had said and he says oh, well, geez because we won't go there again

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.640
I said no, we're going there. I love those

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
I mean there

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:25.160
I bet I bet if we had her up here

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:30.840
You know what and and some weird story when we went back afterwards when I had, you know

01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:36.600
When he had healed and I was looking normal again. She just she practically bent over backwards to

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:40.760
To yeah, that's the moral of story be normal

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:42.760
Yeah

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.800
Membership has its privileges

A hippie before being a hippie was cool. Uh, it was I don't even know. We'll interview him about it

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:21.080
It was very interesting. It's nice like after Beth you go through all that and Dan, you know

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:25.400
You watch your wife go through all this, you know trauma and stuff and then you listen to your neighbor's podcast

And he's talking because your wife the tumor lady, you know

01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:33.480

What do you mean? What do I want? Yeah, what do you want?

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:57.640
I'd like to regale you guys with a story that's almost as interesting as a tumor

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.160
No

01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:03.480
Spencer, do you think you know how to take a compliment?

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:11.320
I mean, I've learned since doing Harmontown how to take a compliment. I think I think you're a wonderful person. Thanks, ma'am

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:22.120
When your delivery is so so monotone, it's hard to say it always sounds like I mean, I know that that wasn't sarcastic

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:24.120
Maybe I haven't learned how to take a compliment

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:28.760
He's still you got some you got some defense mechanisms about you. Oh all sorts

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:35.240
Like the people would say things to you out of deference and and then you're you're you're

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:38.680
Instinctive reaction is to go. Yeah, fuck you

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:43.800
Yeah, you were saying earlier about how like when people are fishing for stuff you shut down

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:46.360
I do that too like I when people are

01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:51.240
Trying to like get a response out of me. I just can't and I just like no fuck off

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:55.880
And like when I do something funny or say something funny and then someone's like hey do the thing

01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:57.880
I'm like fuck off. Go fuck yourself

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:03.800
Yeah, what is that? It's spontaneity and it's the spice of my brand of comedy

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:10.920
All right, yeah, I agree

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:17.960
I thought like people go like do Sean Connery do Sean Connery. I'm like, no, fuck you. Yeah, it's like no

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:22.120
The time I nailed Sean Connery. Yeah, exactly. We were in a submarine

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:29.000
Yeah, I do agree but and when people just doesn't infuriate you

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:33.960
When when you can sense that someone is actually trying to get you to tell them that they're smart or pretty

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:37.800
Yeah, because so much of the time it's like it's not like I don't like you

Yeah, they think they're they think they're manipulating you. Well, they yeah, they're definitely I'm enamored with other people

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:16.840
I'm enamored with them. That's so and when you give someone a compliment. Do they burst into tears? I don't think so. Well, they I

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.840
Happens when I do it

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.840

Parasites

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:39.080
See you fucking

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:43.480
How many times a day or a week or a month do do people come at you and fish your compliments?

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:46.120
Like how frequent is it like eight times a day? Really?

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:51.880
Like give me like an actual dude as often as it happens to you and happens all the time you call it conversation

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:55.080
Everyone does it to each other. Everyone does it to each other

01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:57.720
But like I mean give me like a give me a for instance not not my shirt

01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:03.080
But my pants somebody's coming up to you and going like uh, okay, so let's just improv a conversation

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:07.080
Okay, I give me a suggestion anatoly. Give me a say a noun

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.400
Table, okay

01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:15.320
Hey, uh, good job on this table. Thank you. Thank you for making the table

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:19.000
You're welcome. I'm a I'm a really good carpenter. Yeah

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:25.240
It's got four legs. It's crazy. You did good. Good job on the varnish. Uh, thank you very much. It's nice. I mean

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:27.720
I tried I tried as hard as I could to put it in the right place

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:30.280
I don't really know what i'm doing when it comes to tables

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:32.280
I don't

01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:34.200
wait

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:36.200
Yeah, exactly

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:38.600
That does not happen to me eight times a day

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.560
I know uh, well

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:48.040
Like give me a real world saying I just did that's not a real nobody goes up and touch is awkward about the table

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.240
I've made

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:52.520
People who are always like i'm such an idiot like like that

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:57.800
The people some I know it's not everyone some people are honestly like oh, i'm so stupid

01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:03.000
But some people are just like i'm such an idiot. You know, I went to the store. Here's what happens

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:07.080
Yeah, here's what happens to me all the time. Here's what happens to me constantly. Okay

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:12.520
You just finished doing a show uh, and good night. Okay

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:20.760
I go into a little hey, hey, uh, thank you. Thank you. I enjoyed you in the show. Oh, thank you very much. Thanks. You're kind of like

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:26.200
I uh, I I'm an idiot and I don't I don't I don't

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:30.040
I don't I shouldn't I shouldn't be talking to you right now. Yeah, you probably should

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:34.920
No, I see every day. Yeah, that's that's the thing I get that

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:39.240
Here's what I'll add. I think that your experience is not the same experience for everybody because

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:45.800
Uh, I think that like I I noticed from you and my friends that everybody attracts a certain kind of crazy and

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:51.000
I got like uh, when people are weird to you and people like come at you at a party or after a show

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:55.000
Maybe or I've seen it a million times. We've talked about this people come to you

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.920
To for an affirmation that they don't come to me for like people want you to think they're smart

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:05.080
It's it's very important that people when people like are weird around you what they're asking is like

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:10.760
I really need Dan Harmon to tell me that I'm an intelligent smart person and like Rob Schraber friend

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:13.720
He's really creative people come to him and they can freak him out and bum them out

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:17.240
But they want they need Rob to say you're creative and for me

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:19.640
It's always like the people like that they want me to tell them that they're cool

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:25.640
That what they like is cool like they want style like or what like like coolness points and stuff like that

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:29.640
But you said we have very different kind of stuff people come at you and say I'm an idiot

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:31.640
They don't I don't get that kind of thing. Yeah

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:36.600
Like people be little themselves because they need you to say no you're smart. You're this and I've never in my life

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:41.240
I've never honestly. I've never said in response to somebody saying like

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:44.760
Oh, I'm an idiot. I've never gone like no, you're great

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:49.480
Like I just have never been able to do it. Yeah, because it would be so strange

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:53.000
I just kind of it's silence and then the and then I feel like they go away and they go

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:56.360
I said it was an idiot. He didn't argue with me

01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:59.800
Like I don't know. I don't know if you're an idiot. I don't know

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:04.360
But you have the power to make people feel like an idiot like if like if thank you see you they see

01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.760
That wasn't the compliment that wasn't the compliment

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:11.560
idiot

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.560
I

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:15.560
Just pointed at a guy and called him an idiot

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:21.080
Yeah, but the thing is like that that's a joke that might actually actually sting coming from you because like I mean

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:23.480
I've known you for a long time and if I'll say idiot

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:31.080
What are you doing? You're like I'm fucking testing your theory. You're like Godzilla. Don't do it idiot

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:36.600
You're a fucking idiot. How dare you get out of bed today. What's your name?

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:40.760

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:49.400
How dare you try?

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:52.200

Fuck you

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:14.920
Tyler

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:25.000
You you do enjoy the power that you wield to be to make somebody feel stupid. No, I don't

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.360
No, yes, you do. No, I don't because you never it's never got me anymore

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:33.720
I'm not saying you that you profit if any from it, but when you when you when you're bummed out and you want to

01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:38.600
Even the the the score that you perceive is out of balance

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:44.280
You are very very deft and capable of making somebody feel like an absolute piece of shit like it like intellectually

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:49.800
And you can do it with like with a with a very small stroke from it though. No profits. None. It's not it's not a profitable

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:52.040
No, it's a curse. Yeah

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:58.600
So people look at my face and they think that those are my cheekbones. They think that I think that they're stupid. I don't give a shit

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:01.800
That's the thing. That's the crazy thing

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:05.080
What do you mean?

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:07.640
Oh

01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:09.720
How dare you?

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:14.840
All right, let's uh, let's let's let's play judges the dragon. All right, so let's work work these issues out

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:20.200
Aaron will you join us again?

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:32.440
You okay, baby? I'm fine. Oh, okay

01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:38.200
You that was a weird entrance. You came up like like you have a lot in your mind that you look like there was there's an issue of

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:39.880
Bruin

01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:41.880
No, it's all final

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:47.720
Uh, okay sounds not fine. All right. No, it's all it's all fine. It's not say it. No

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:52.440
No, it's not it's not worth it

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:59.800
All right, no, we can't we can't because then if she says it then she'll be able to go you dragged it out of me

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:05.000
I'm trying to be a more responsible person on stage and we spent the entire time

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:07.480
We spent see the way I said it. Yeah

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:10.520
Yeah

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:14.920
Okay, let's just let's just not talk about it. Let's just let let's just let it linger in the room like a weird weird

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:20.280
I don't think that dance being totally honest by the way he feels and we'll talk about it later and it's fine

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:22.680
But it's totally fine. No

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.960
Lock the doors

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:31.320
Nobody leaves. No, what do you mean? What do you mean? What does that mean? We should talk about that

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:34.840
What do you mean? Aaron don't make us bring out. I mean our

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:36.840
All right

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:41.240
Are you being ostentatiously needy

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:49.240
My favorite thing ever a blog called me ostentatiously needy. I've never been happier

01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:54.440
What if you just say a black called you ostentatious a blog? No, I said a blog

01:18:56.360 --> 01:19:01.640
But let's talk about why you heard a black. What were you? What was I I mean, I'm if I'm guilty of anything

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:03.720
It's a boring episode

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:06.760
Oh, it's about to get less boring. Was I dishonest?

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:13.640
I do think you were dishonest, but I but maybe you were keeping your honesty private. I don't know. What what are you talking about?

01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:15.720
What do you mean? I mean exactly

01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:21.320
Had damn it. I can't keep any secrets. I'm a terrible person. I'm sorry. I'm sorry

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:24.040
I

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:31.160
I mean our friend who begs for compliments the most by being self-deprecating is Spencer. Yeah, who's okay. Yeah

01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:33.160
All right

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:39.480
And I drive and spencer as my friend. It's we create. I don't it's it's fine. Whatever. I'm sorry. I definitely do it

01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:41.880
What I definitely do it

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:44.600
Right. Okay. I'm like the worst

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:49.640
All right

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:51.720
Which is why you're friends

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:57.320
Yeah, I know spencer's the worst about it. He's 23 years old

01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:03.080
I also did I miss you guys talking about how he's the worst about it because you and I were literally talking about it on the way here

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:05.320
I did. Oh, okay

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:10.920
All right. Okay. All right. Okay. Okay in a very loving way because we both love spencer so much

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:15.000
But we were literally saying how much we love spencer and how it annoys us

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:20.920
I didn't know dishonesty was defined by not saying everything that you talk about in the car in the way to the show

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:23.720
You're right. Which is why I shouldn't have said anything

01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:30.680
But okay, I was just honest spencer. I mentioned that yes, you deflect a lot of compliments. Yeah

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:34.360
Yeah, I feel like I've gotten better. But you know

01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:36.680
Fuck you

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:41.080
Spending the best dungeon master in the world. Okay, you see

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:45.160
I don't know. That's not even an objective thing

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:52.200
Wait, wait that the spencer spencer deflects so many compliments. That's a that's that's an issue. No, I fish

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:58.200
It's not even compliments. It's just for compliments all the time. No, I'm just honestly self deprecating

01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:01.080
Okay, we'll see that's what I was speaking to earlier. So there you go

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:06.920
Is being so why not talk about is being self deprecating necessarily fishing for a compliment is saying no, no, it's not

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.720
But it appears the same way in most contexts

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.800
Yeah

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:16.440
Being self deprecating is a way to kind of

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:20.920
Make at least for me it's been kind of a defense mechanism to if someone is being intact

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:24.680
It's like and aggressive. I do self deprecation tools like yeah, totally agree. You're right

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.160
That's sort of a sort of a defense mechanism. Sure, which is totally which is totally true

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:37.080
But then there are also but there there's also like there are people who are in love who maybe have a lot of things about themselves that they don't like

01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:40.280
And we'll say

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:45.320
That they don't like certain things about themselves, which is like a natural thing. Do I look fat in these genes?

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:48.680
Being the classic

01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:54.360
Being the classic being the classic like specifically people in love. You said no not specifically

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:56.840
I was I was doing a very bad joke

01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:00.840
Um

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:07.000
No, there's so everything's great. Did you see that this guy looks just like johnny pemberton and the front row

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:12.280
Johnny pemberton. Isn't that crazy? Kind of does. Yeah, there's no need to lash out at people

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:17.880
Oh, no, I think Johnny pemberton's great looking. He does look like yeah, he does look like johnny

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:24.200
Yeah, no, no, no, it's fine. I think spent like I now think it's adorable. You spent the whole car right here just bashing spencer

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:26.760
No, no, no, I deserve it

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:36.520
I just thought it was ironic. No not bashing him at all. We both are obsessed with him

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:42.280
He works for dad. We both talk to him constantly. I love spencer text him. I don't know about constantly

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:50.440
I will text you more talking to people constantly would be weird anyway, but that would be weird that would be weird

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:52.120
No, I

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:53.720
It's it's it's totally fine

01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:57.960
It's frustrating because we like you so much and it feels like you were you are constantly putting yourself down

01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:03.560
Because it's not even a compliment thing. It's not when there's a compliment. It's no. I know it's even like i'm shitty at putting down a

01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:06.360
Book and I am no one's shitty at putting that

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:10.040
He is shitty putting books down

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:12.040
Podcast listeners wouldn't know

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:15.320
Yeah, you're gonna hate his house there's books in the ceiling and shit

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:20.440
I I regret this entire thing

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:25.480
But i'm just saying it's it's comes from a very loving place. I love

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:31.720
You spencer. I agree with everything you've been saying. Well, and I just accept the loving me part

01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:38.840
I spencer I love you. Yeah

01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:44.600
You got a funny way of showing it car ride lady

01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:52.200
No, we were literally whatever it's fine. I'm so sorry. Well, let's play a really uncomfortable dungeon of dragons

01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:54.760
That's it

01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:56.760
Spencer if you would

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.200
Last time oh good job

01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:01.640
Harmon

01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:03.640
town

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:06.200
Our hero look what you did to him had

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:09.240
I'll leave. Oh, no

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:12.040
Oh

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:15.080
Yeah, that's what I always wanted

01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:24.280
No, it's it's all fine everybody. Can you guys see my nightmare right now? Or is it just me? I don't know why you're so uncomfortable

01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:26.920
I'm fine. I'm sorry. Go go go anyway

01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:32.600
Last time on Harmontown our heroes had just felt an ogre and an icy canyon

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:38.520
They led a skeleton army through the gate towards the black keep the fortress of Admiral Darkstar

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:42.200
And as they marched up the icy slope and climbed out of the canyon

01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:49.480
They saw that their skeletons had vanished before them was a mighty army of darkness and as our heroes charge forward at their foes

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:53.800
They plunged through a trap floor or a trap door in the floor

01:24:53.800 --> 01:25:01.080
Sliding down into an icy dungeon separated by walls of ice and facing down doors quark melted through the icy barriers with

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:07.560
His flaming swords reuniting the party. They checked the doors treasure traps gags and giant snowflakes ensued

01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:13.880
Using their neutra found treasure they attacked but none so much as Mulraines whisper bow and as she whispered to said bow

01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:19.080
It began to glow firing off two arrows destroying the snowflake with massive damage

01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:22.120
That sounds like that should whatever

01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:24.120
Thanks a lot erin

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:29.480
You fucked him up. You fucked him up for life. You were away. You broke spencer. You broke him

01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:37.800
The way out was a staircase ahead, but Chris de Burghen Mulraine were bleeding heavily from their jagged wounds from the snowflake

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:39.880
They encountered earlier

01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:43.240
What would you do?

01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:45.640
Yay spencer

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:58.120
Until such time as he does something wrong, I would like to invite tyler up to play Chris de Burgh tyler welcome back

01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:02.680
The crowd goes mild

01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:05.880
It's the inappropriate reaction

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:12.440
That was a tentative welcome to the stage from the audience. I'm terrible. I'm awful dng nobody. Yeah, that's what I've been

01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:18.280
No, it there's one thing you can say about you. You're good at dnd. You know what you're doing in the dungeon fishing for compliments

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:20.600
You're great at it. Oh, thanks

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:26.200
We all fish for compliments. You guys are doing great. I'm sorry. I want to just I want to say I'm sorry

01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:30.280
I know you were you were saying that the the subreddit was like, oh tyler's doing great up here

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:35.880
And I was sort of deflected it and that was me doing that. So I apologize whom me. Yeah, yes a couple weeks ago

01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:39.480
I think you were like, hey the subreddit seems like you and I was like, I don't know and blah blah blah

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:43.560
So I once again was terrible tanky compliment. I apologize. We all do it

01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:48.520
We all have blood on our hands. In the most fun way you complimented yourself in front of this audience. It's very fun

01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:54.760
I wasn't intentional. Maybe I'm not paying attention. I don't really feel like this is a big issue in my life this whole this whole thing

01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:59.240
No, no, no. I don't see why you guys are so bent out of shape about this stuff like it's

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:03.880
It doesn't it doesn't torture me that people like like diminish themselves

01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:08.440
You don't constantly have people coming up to you and saying, uh, I guess you don't think I dressed that good

01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:11.400
It happens once in a while. So we oh

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:17.880
You think I'm underdressed like yeah, fucking dress up fucking make an effort cocksucker. All right. It's Friday night

01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:22.600
You have you have sandals on fucking pull it together. Okay. Well, the rest of us have a problem with that

01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:26.840
No, I I I people want to lower themselves beneath me. It's like I'll do everything

01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:30.120
I'll do everything I can to lift them back up. I'll say that's like no

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:35.560
No, you need to stand your ground and be there adonis. Okay. Well, no, no, I'm just saying like I feel like

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:40.440
I'm not tortured by the people are constantly like every time somebody does something

01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:43.480
Self-deprecating. I don't feel like they're trying to pick my pockets

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:46.120
Like you like I think you think that they're trying to do that

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:49.560
They're trying to hoodwink you're out smart you into saying something like I don't what do you do?

01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:53.080
But in that moment you for real facetiousness aside

01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:56.200
You do what do you give them what they want to hear?

01:27:56.200 --> 01:28:02.200
Jeff you probably think that I'm an asshole because I'm because I'm dressed this way right because I'm not wearing a suit

01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:04.680
Um, if somebody said like I mean

01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:07.400
What are you talking about man?

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:11.560
People like people will come up and go like, uh, I guess I'm underdressed and I go like, yeah

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:15.480
You know, but that's a joke like I'll make a joke at it. It's like that's what I want to do

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:19.640
It's it's a deflection thing. It's like but some people will just be self-deprecating as a nature

01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:24.920
That's what I do kind of sometimes. It's you know, you go into a perceived crowd of people who are cooler

01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:26.040
X

01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:31.080
Slash more popular whatever than you and you just kind of have to go in and assume like yeah, they know that I am bad

01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:35.880
So I kind of you know make self-deprecating things to kind of put myself on their level

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:39.960
It's not even a thing that I sort of consciously do it just sometimes in conversation. It happens

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:43.320
Yeah, I think I think people that natural instinct is to come in low

01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:45.400
Especially to strangers or people that they maybe like, you know

01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:50.280
If you're if you're a fan of a comedy podcast and you meet somebody it's it's or you know people that you know

01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:57.080
No Spencer for you know from now you're you're you know mild notoriety from this like people are gonna come in like act weird

01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:01.240
I think that's just a natural human thing and also it's I don't know. I find it sort of a tactic to be

01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:07.000
Disarming it's sort of like I'm not coming at you like look how amazing I am. I'm awesome. I'm cool. I'm like whatever. I'm human

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Look at this. I'm kind of

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
We're cool, right? Yeah, I mean I just

01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:15.480
It certainly happens, but I just it's like you saying it happens to you so much that it's a real

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:20.680
Problem for you. Like I don't sense that in my life. I'm not even saying it happens so much as a problem

01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:24.120
I'm saying it is my alone. Is anyone else can relate to me on that like

01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:29.240
I'm saying I was crazy up here for like not you know how when you're in an office chair

01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:32.520
And you're like it's got rollers on the bottom and you're at linoleum

01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:36.440
And then you're going into a carpeted area and there's like a little just like a little thing

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:40.200
In a conversation where that happens that I just can't my rolling chair can't

01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:46.280
It won't roll past that and someone goes like I guess you think I'm an idiot because I'm a stupid idiot

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.640
I guess you think I'm a stupid idiot. I I can't I go

01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:59.960
That's certainly a bad conversation that's not that's not a fun conversation to be it's a different thing for dan because people

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:04.760
Look up to you. Oh god. This is the worst episode of the worst podcast in the world

01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:11.160
No, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry America. I'm so sorry. No, we love it. Dan. It's amazing. We make this lost episode number two

01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:14.200
I I the first one was when I found out I was going back to community

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:20.840
I I I I didn't I just I just I was just a social phenomenon. I thought it happened to everybody like somebody goes like

01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:26.280
I know I'm so fat. I'm so fat. I'm so fat like it doesn't matter if you think they're fat or thin or whatever

01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:29.320
It's just like this sandbag drops on you and you don't

01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:33.400
I think it is a social phenomenon that people just kind of react to differently like

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:37.080
It may be kind of more of an impediment for you, but I guess for a lot of people

01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:38.600
I know it's just something that

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:42.680
I don't know whether it's being in LA and just sort of these people act like that

01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:46.840
It's they try to find it the most disarming way to get into a conversation

01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:49.400
So that oftentimes is a conversation starter for them

01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:53.960
Dan are you able to sort out when somebody is trying to get something from you?

01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:57.960
And when somebody is just expressing how they feel about themselves? Yes. Okay

01:30:57.960 --> 01:30:59.960
All right

01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:04.520
Thanks for coming to Harmon Tom

01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:09.400
Christopher and Mulraine take four bleeding damage from gashes in their stomachs

01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:12.680
Fuck

01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:15.960
All right, so we're walking up the staircase right now and bleeding

01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:18.360
Uh, uh

01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:23.720
Help help me. Yeah, I heal everybody. How do you do that with my healing ring?

01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:26.440
I don't think that exists

01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:28.440
You tried

01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:31.080
I have no healing powers. Uh

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:37.160
Does anyone know healing first aid? I I know healing. I have healing powers. Am I able to heal myself?

01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:42.440
You can try and bandage your wounds. Okay bandage my wounds. Oh shit. I forgot dice

01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:45.480
I mean, I didn't forget them. They're right here, but I forgot to get them out

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:49.480
I hope there's no mistaking how much I love spencer. I really don't

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:55.960
Loving spencer. It sounds like you spent some time loving him sometime despising everything he does. No, no not Jeff

01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:59.320
Come on. You know, that's not true. Oh, yeah, look at that smile. I wish on the podcast

01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:03.000
You could see that little that little that little cracker jack Jeff smile

01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:07.480
Jeff's one of my best friends. You're a cracker jack. Aaron. You're not being totally honest right now

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.440
You you came over to my place yesterday and spent four hours just shit talking spencer

01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:17.640
We got a dispenser slumber party and we put on beards and we're like

01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:22.040
No, you can't see my face

01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:28.760
And then you tried to make out with me, which is what is what is that about? Oh, I can't blame a guy for trying

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:32.840
What's the point of having a spencer slumber party if I can't make my moves

01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:36.360
Spencer slumber party. Yeah, okay

01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:38.600
Yeah

01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:43.480
All right. So, uh, do we heal these people or what will you bandage your wounds and manage to stanch the bleeding?

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:49.160
I can help me. I'm I'm in a bad sitch here. I I try to heal them

01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:52.200
With with bandages. Okay

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:58.120
Are you are you good at it do that? Okay? See we're good. Okay. You're good. All right. Let's make some stairs

01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:00.680
Let's make something happen out of this adventure. Let's do it

01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:07.800
All right, so we walk up the stairs at the stop of the stairs is a brilliantly ornate double door as hard as I can

01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:11.000
I didn't even I didn't even get a chance to hear what it was. What are you blind?

01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:18.120
It's a thing being kicked. All right as you kick the icy door you feel your foot stick to the door

01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:19.480
It's shit

01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:21.980
Frost creeps up your leg as it freezes

01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:26.200
Fucking I use I use my flaming armor to

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:34.280
Unfreeze him. All right. He takes three ice damage before flying out. Fuck door dance top blindly kicking stuff

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:37.240
What are you doing? I just an aggressive mood

01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:39.560
I know

01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:43.080
Is there a is there a latch or a handle on this? There's there's handles

01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:45.240
um

01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:48.440
But you don't want to touch him probably because you'll get ice damage. I mean, who knows man

01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:53.480
Um, I can I use my armlet of winter to to calm the to calm the like the ice

01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:56.760
I don't do I have power over ice and snow not over a door made of ice

01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:01.320
You have a power over like weather snow, but not like if there was an ice cube you couldn't be all like

01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:03.400
Hey, fucker do something

01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:08.840
I just realized I think I always say who knows man when someone asked me a question that they're right about

01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:15.160
Oh, I haven't noticed that oh Spencer Aaron. Let it go

01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:30.760
Guys I was bullied for my perfect skin and hair

01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:36.600
So lay off I I strike the door with my flaming sword

01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:38.600
It melts

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:40.600
My sword of the door the door

01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:44.920
My sword of the door a valid question. Yeah

01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:47.080
That's what yeah fair

01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:54.280
Yeah inside the door you can see a room composed of finely worked stone slabs, which are incredibly even smooth

01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:56.520
They kick all of them

01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:02.120
Your foot kind of skids off them. It's a really slippery floor

01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:07.320
Hmm, you're gonna you're gonna trip and hurt yourself buddy. Talk to us. What's happening? Don't fish for compliments

01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:13.160
I'm not fishing. I'm I didn't say I'm terrible talk to me. I said gay people are fine. Okay

01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:16.040
I I agree

01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:17.880
Wait, what?

01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:22.440
What are the what are the what are the stone slabs describe these? Oh, I was describing

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:28.280
Um, the room is freezing cold and on the far side of the room you can see a massive purple beast

01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:34.280
Looking like a massive porcupine with great orange and purple spines on its back and glowing green eyes

01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:40.280
It's standing in front of a long copper pendulum sort of thing that hangs down from a hole in the ceiling

01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:45.640
I run up and before he says anything I say, I just want you to know that is a great copper pendulum

01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:48.680
I don't know if it's yours

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
You say this is a porcupine beast

01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:55.400
Porcupine more in every single demon we've tried to talk to

01:35:55.400 --> 01:36:00.200
Do just like they light on fire or their eyes get real big and they don't like to kind of send him to me

01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:04.680
He's not kind of sending. He's just giving you a note. I'm not I'm saying I'm I'm trying to be real here

01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:10.120
I'm not saying I'm not gonna mooray. Maybe you shouldn't do this. I'm not using the lilting tone of voice

01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:17.400
I'm saying these demons every time we've run up and talked to them. They're in bad moods. They have had the worst days

01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:23.640
You're right. You're right. And yet I I keep on trying to find a demon who's going to relate to me emotionally

01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:30.680
I I want that too. But that seems like self-destructive behavior. You're right. You're right. I walk I walk out of the door

01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:32.200
I walk I walk out

01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:34.200
No, wait. No, no, you don't

01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:38.040
I thought you're being like Kate Hudson in the first act of a

01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:41.080
No, don't go

01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:42.600
Don't drop your papers

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:45.320
I I go I go in the corner and I feel ashamed

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:48.680
Because I guess I made the wrong action and I sit down

01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:53.480
No, and I and I start I take start pulling the hair out of my no-go hair

01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:57.560
No, when did this show become the most passive aggressive hunk of shit in the world? No, no, listen

01:36:57.560 --> 01:36:58.760
I don't

01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:03.640
Can anyone speak in a direct active sentence and just fucking say what they want the pork you demon attacks

01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:12.120
I'm just saying love can't bloom

01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:19.080
All right, Christeberg and Mulraine get hit by flying spines. Great. I open my eye. I'm hoping to catch one in my eye

01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:21.080
You don't

01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:22.120
Damn

01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:24.920
Christeberg takes five damage and Mulraine takes one

01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:28.200
Sorry

01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:30.120
I was trying to help

01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:33.400
Fucking nobody likes anybody friends like these

01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:39.400
On the wall behind the porky demon you see a large orange colored door and on either side of the door

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:45.400
Three large stone slabs each standing out of the wall like they're uh, you know hanging out

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:51.560
They jut past the wall. I slam my head against the orange door. Okay

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.360
Wait, no, you're on the other side of the room. Okay. I don't do it. Okay

01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:04.920
I'm so confused what's going on right now. Yeah, usually I describe a whole room and then you have some idea of what it looks like

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:11.720
How how big is this room? How big is this room? I mean it's it's about 30 by 40. Okay long style

01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:17.400
Long okay, so the porcupine and the pendulum are on the other end of the room. Yeah, there's like a series of stone

01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:22.360
Yeah stone they look like large circular stone buttons now that I mentioned it

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:28.680
And then where there's also a door behind them or to one of us. Yeah, they're between they're behind they're directly behind the

01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:31.160
pendulum, okay

01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:33.480
We got to get past this porcupine

01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:38.520
Probably all right. I um, I uh, I go fucking wild. I go to a

01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:44.760
I do a power attack on this uh with my uh with my mighty sword my new mighty sword that I just found

01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:51.160
All right, your power attack misses you go wide power attacks are a lot more wild and less accurate

01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:54.840
And that's what happens right. Let's see sound a little defensive

01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:57.240
What?

01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:59.240
Oh my gosh

01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:05.800
I'm like putting in a christopher's attack message, you know, it's like okay, uh, I would like to

01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:11.400
Use my amulet of autumn to go invisible and see if I can maybe find a weak point on this giant pointy guy

01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:16.360
Does this say how many times you couldn't go twice a day? Okay, it's been the same. We're still on the same day, right?

01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:21.320
Yeah, no, we're good. We're good. Yeah. All right, so I'd like to go invisible to see if I can scout around it

01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:25.880
And maybe find a weak spot. I mean, I'm assuming it's just little head forever spikes. Yep

01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:29.880
Um, fuck

01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:33.880
Okay, we got to hit his head. You got to get his head. Um, is that your whole action or can you can you attack?

01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:35.880
I can use fishing for a weakness

01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:37.160
Fishing for a weakness?

01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:39.960
I don't know. He's so big. He's got so many spikes

01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:42.520
But wait, no, I'm kidding

01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:46.680
Uh, okay, let me see if I can uh, uh, uh, okay

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:49.960
So this we didn't have time to identify this dagger with this stupid ribbon on it

01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:54.760
So I'm just going to take my poison dagger and stab him in the face out of stealth

01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:56.760
Nice. Take that poison dagger

01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:02.040
All right, that happens and you stab him in the face

01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:07.560
Awesome dealing 16 damage

01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:15.480
Did you add the one detail? I mean 23 damage 23 23 damage

01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:24.360
Oh, nice. Good job putting it up. Thank you rainster. Can I can I really quickly do an impression of

01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:27.560
Spencer after he finishes making love to a woman?

01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:31.800
That happens

01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:37.720
That's sorry picture

01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:41.560
Uh, can I do an impression of that? I'm gonna go cry

01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:43.560
I

01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:47.480
Will I see you again and you go who knows man

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Can I finish explaining

01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:55.960
So you got a new bow last week

01:40:56.360 --> 01:41:03.080
Um, I know and if you thank you, is that I know and if you talk and if you talk elvish to it, it gets crazy

01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:09.400
All right, I just figured I'd mention it. Okay. Well, I feel obligated. I guess I use the whisper bow

01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:10.680
Jesus

01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:12.680
I'm not trying to tell you how to play

01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:18.440
I know, you know, tyler. I'm I'm doing I'm doing a uh a bad bit and I don't mean it

01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:22.280
I think you're doing a really good job. I appreciate how much you care about the show. Thank you

01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:26.440
I thought I was doing terrible. No, you're doing a very good job

01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:31.720
And I think that everyone really appreciates how much you how thoughtful you are. I'm gonna start chanting in a second

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:37.000
And I think there's be a number of people that will join in that too too many layers here

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.600
So I don't mean that. I'm sorry. I use my whisper bow. Okay

01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:44.040
To shoot

01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:48.520
I mean, how do you use it? Do you have to whisper when you're using it? Let's talk elvish to it. I guess. Yeah

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Scoop it. I

01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:55.720
Is elvish scat

01:41:57.480 --> 01:42:01.000
You notice that the bow doesn't glow like it did that one time

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:04.040
What?

01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:07.480
Zildren scoobin bot in

01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:11.160
David Lee Roth 11

01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:14.360
Still nothing

01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:20.680
I try did I use did I speak elvish? You definitely spoke it. Thanks, spencer

01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:25.080
Okay, speak authentic 1920s Harlem elvish

01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:39.000
Do you want to do anything else? Um, I'd like to fire I'd like to fire 14 arrows

01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:45.720
How about one arrow? All right, I'll take one. Okay. Good. I fire one arrow. It hits

01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:54.360
Dealing I rolled the dice earlier. It got an 18 plus seven is 25 which hits people that think I'm cheating

01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:56.360
No one thinks I'm cheating

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:03.640
People are looking at my dice or making sure I'm rolling otherwise they're like, this is just a farce

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.920
Spenser are there actually people who reach out to you and are like, I don't think he's actually rolling dice

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:14.920
I think he's just saying that yeah

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:21.560
If I go of course reverse engineering the theory that you're cheating from the end result, which is

01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:25.720
That nothing this entertaining could be done organically

01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:29.160
There's no way

01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:31.880
Can I just go on the record and say I think all of you suck right now?

01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:34.840
But like there's no you will get no compliments out of me right now

01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:40.120
I think you guys are all being a bunch of turkeys. No, no, you're right. I've done a terrible I know

01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:45.400
I absolutely agree with you. You're fucking doing it wrong. Fine. I I kill myself

01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:49.400
That's all I had to do an arrow

01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:53.560
Tear up the sheet

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:58.920
That's how you kill yourself. Well, thanks Adam for being so enthusiastic. I keep kicking everything and punching everything

01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:01.960
Like the enemies are just the surrounding

01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:06.840
Everything kick the porcupine if you're gonna kick something kick him in his dumb eyeballs

01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:09.400
or the teeth

01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:12.840
Do you have teeth do four points of teeth this one does okay

01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:17.800
It's more of a porcupine demon really so do you want me to go?

01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:23.640
On your turn. Yeah. Yeah, but you didn't specify where you were punching and kicking

01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:30.680
You tell me when I get to go. It's your turn. All right. I cast a spell. What is happening? Okay

01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:35.000
Uh

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Scorching ray. Oh, okay

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:42.440
Oh, we have a bunch of weenies. Hey, don't let me do anything. What are you doing?

01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:46.440
Do something. I I attacked and I missed. I'm waiting my turn patiently. Well, you guys

01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:52.600
Will you try to talk to a porcupine? You fire a scorching ray and it deals 17 damn it. Yeah. Yeah

01:44:55.320 --> 01:45:01.400
Way to go sharpie you did good, but my neighbors are real glad they came to the show tonight

01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:07.560
Yeah, you can what's going on. I don't know Beth. I don't know

01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:10.920
Isn't this the guy that called our poor our party boring?

01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:26.040
She survived a tumor and she had to deal with it

01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:31.480
Two seconds she survived a tumor and then I came on stage like a tumor lady

01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:35.240
Then she comes up. That's a tumor lady

01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:39.880
And then sit down and sit down tumor lady. Let me show you what what's what

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Uh, I 30 feet of rope

01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:47.640
And she's like I have fucking

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:52.600
Tumor-sized hole in my brain, but I know this is boring. I know

01:45:52.600 --> 01:46:01.720
They didn't they didn't take out the part that makes me know what's exciting. I don't think it's boring Dan. Thank you, Tyler

01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:07.080
You're welcome

01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:09.240
I'm sorry I fished for that

01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:14.600
You're fucking you you were trawling with a big net on that one man

01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:22.120
You caught 18 million tuna and a boot and I got your tires

01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:25.400
I'm so sorry

01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:30.440
I just realized my big pet bee was people fishing for cobblers. That's my whole life

01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:37.880
I'm the last person to realize I'm sorry. I'm sorry

01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:43.880
I just caught up. I just caught up. Thank you for coming to Harmontown tonight everybody

01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:42.360
Please hold while your call is being transferred

01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:50.360
I have no clue. I was born in 89. A simulacrum means happy Kim trail day. Yes, that was nice to survive it

01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:54.360
Johnny, hold that thought. I can't tell you that over the phone. Do you want to get struck by lightning?

01:47:54.840 --> 01:48:03.960
Twisting the wind with Johnny Pemberton on Feral Audio. Yeah, what are you doing? Are you going to check it out?

01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:10.760
That was pretty good. That was pretty good. That was a pretty good little quick one. Yeah

01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:14.760
That's what we call it a turn of phrase. I believe this is what they used to call it back in the day

01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:24.680
Thank you for calling

01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:30.040
Steve could I have your last name and your zip codes or pull up your order? Yep. Last name is tip corn

01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:33.560
Zip codes nine double zero

01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:39.720
I just made a call by they say had to call back because he was about to head he had to go

01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:46.120
He had to head out. Um, but I had some questions about the product before I continued

01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:49.960
Okay, before you before you ordered it. Yeah

01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:54.440
Okay, what's your question? Well, I just only caught a glimpse of it on tv

01:48:54.440 --> 01:49:00.120
I just saw like the last maybe 10 seconds of it and I just trying to go better understand what it was

01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:05.800
So these are like special glasses that you can adjust the prescription on them to be whatever you want

01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:10.600
So you don't have to ever get new glasses. Is that the idea? Nope. Nope. This is

01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:15.400
For you to go outside if you want to try to see birds in a tree

01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:22.600
Okay, you want to go to a a game where you can zoom in see people at the game so you're not so far away

01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:29.640
It it's not for quote. We reading glasses. Okay. Well, I don't do when you're reading. I just do more like looking for

01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:36.200
Birds and lizards and stuff and driving, you know, like what I was looking for something

01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:38.600
I don't wear while I'm driving and I can look for birds

01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:44.280
Nope, you can't use these while you're driving you remember when you when you look into these things, right?

01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:50.280
Everything's going to be magnified to you. Okay, as it comes closer to you. It's going to totally blur up

01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:55.080
Okay, so wouldn't that be a good thing because you can see stuff from far away. You could break in ahead of time

01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:59.080
No, no, no, it's it's going to be totally blurry. Think of it this way

01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:03.480
If you if you're have regular binoculars on okay, and

01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:08.840
And if you're going like 30 miles an hour, you're catching up to that thing right away

01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:11.160
The stuff is close to you. You can't see

01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:15.880
Well, but you will you will have seen it before you got to where it was where it is then when you

01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:20.120
gets worried, but I know but when you blur when you break

01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:26.520
You you're going to break too early or way too late. Well, it's better to break too early, isn't it? That's what they say

01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:29.240
Don't be sorry. Yeah

01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:32.280
I know but think of the people behind you

01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:38.040
You're you're going along you you break. They don't see anything in front of you. They're going to smack you nowhere

01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:43.720
Oh, well, oh, I don't know who drives like that because you can't see around the car

01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:47.800
Oh, so I know I always look behind the car ahead of me

01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:53.560
Oh, so if you so if a person's breaking and they and so if you're driving behind somebody and that person in front

01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:56.600
Of you breaks, but you don't see what they're breaking for you. Just hit them

01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:01.320
Correct. Yeah. Oh, that's why that's why you never drive close

01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:04.440
But I always look behind the car in front of me and so well

01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:09.160
What happens when you rear end them when the one they'd never I never have I never have

01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:12.120
Oh, but you given the circumstance you would

01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:17.080
Choose to rear end them because you'd be like why they stop and I'm gonna show them what for why not to stop

01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:19.320
Is it like that?

01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:24.200
What but but you don't wear these driving. You do that. What about video games?

01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:29.880
Video games good, right? I'll make it look like I have a giant tv or something, right? You could play

01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:37.960
Well far away people people have here used these glasses while working here on the computer screen

01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:43.560
That's cool. So I thought so I suppose you can use them. We'd be a video game. That's a great idea

01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:46.600
Yeah, do you wear it? Where y'all working at?

01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:53.400
We're in Connecticut. Oh Connecticut. I've been there once it's really pretty there. It's probably pretty hot there right now, isn't it?

01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:59.000
Uh, it's in the 80s 90s. Yeah 80s 90s. Well, I would say it's pretty hot. You know, I don't know

01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:01.080
Do you consider that hot or do you say that's not hot?

01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:05.080
No, that's not hot. What do you consider hot? Are you from like the desert?

01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:14.120
Uh, nope. Uh, hot is in the high 90s hundreds. Oh, wow. Okay. So what do you consider this to be just like like fun or like

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:18.920
Warm, it's not hot. Isn't it? It's not hot. It's double warm. How about double warm?

01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:24.920
No, double warm is just over 100. That's it. Oh, so what would you consider this temperature to be then?

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:29.080
Because I'm in the same temperature shred that you just mentioned. I'm in that and I could say it's hot

01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:33.000
But I don't know. Maybe I should not use that word. I should say something else

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:36.760
Where you at in Arizona? Well, we're near there. Yep

01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:43.320
Yep. No, that's not hot. That's dry heat. That's totally different. Okay. What what do you mean? I don't understand

01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:47.240
Dry heat is totally different than regular hot and humid

01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:50.760
How so hot hot and humid you will die

01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:55.880
If you were to go to a hot and humid you would think it's about 130

01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:58.120
130

01:52:58.120 --> 01:53:02.600
Oh, yeah easy. That's like a like a miniature oven or something. Oh, yeah, I know

01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:05.080
Oh, I didn't know that. Oh, yeah

01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:07.240
Yeah, if you if you ever go down to

01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:13.720
If you go down to where water is totally around you, okay like an island

01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:20.040
Correct and it gets to be hot. Uh-huh. You will you will die because it's it's so hot and humid

01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:25.560
Where you guys are you don't have that much humidity. I have a question. Couldn't you just get in that water and cool down?

01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:30.200
Well, you can but but you do but a lot of people who are not used to it die

01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:34.120
They because they don't know how to swim or because they just don't know they can get in the water

01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:37.080
They just don't know how to cool off. A lot of people don't like the water

01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:39.880
Like they're like dogs or something because dogs do that

01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:43.240
Dogs can't get in the water because they don't know it's water

01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:47.320
They just think it's for drinking and then they try to drink it all and then they just die

01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:53.960
Yeah, yeah, but I'll all dogs know how to swim because they dog paddle. Oh, are you serious? Wait, we just say that again

01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:57.240
All dogs know how to swim because they dog paddle

01:53:57.240 --> 01:54:01.240
Well, what does that mean? They have like a special like motor or something in them? I don't know

01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:07.960
No, no, no, if you watch a dog go into water, okay, they start moving their feet all the time. It's called dog paddle

01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:11.560
That's why they tell tell you when you learn how to swim dog paddle

01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:15.160
Okay, that's where that comes from. So you just dog paddle

01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:21.480
So so the best thing you do on a hot day is to get down by that water where it's super hot and get in and dog paddle

01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:25.160
Mm-hmm. So you're telling me it's 130 degrees there

01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:32.360
No, no, it can't it can be it can be it well, you know, or it feels like it feels like 130

01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:38.280
Well, when it gets to be 100 near water, you know, you know near 100

01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:44.200
It's going to be hot and humid. You're because you're from Arizona. You're going to think it's much hotter

01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:50.920
Oh, yeah, it's not because it's now humid and humid adds, you know, because I got to be humid up here

01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:56.280
Water temperature was like 91 humidity with the humidity was up to the 99 percent

01:54:56.760 --> 01:54:59.720
Oh, that's that's that's like a rain in the air

01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:05.960
Correct. Yep. So basically surrounded by air. So this is what I don't understand. Okay humidity is 99 percent

01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:10.760
It's 90 degrees makes it feel like it's 130 because the water's around you

01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:17.000
But how come then when you get into water like a pool, which is a thousand percent water, right?

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:23.400
Can we agree on that? Mm-hmm. A thousand percent water. How come that cools you down? Is it because it's so much water?

01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:27.880
Because no, it's just it just because the water is on your skin. It doesn't really cool you down

01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:32.920
It's it's cooling the outside of your skin. What about a convection oven? They know about that

01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:37.720
No, don't know anything about that. Okay. I heard a convection oven on the news

01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:45.240
They said when it does a uh instead of raining if it does wind which wind is like rain, but it's

01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:47.480
It's not water. It's just like air

01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:51.720
When it does that from above because there's just hot clouds up there

01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:58.840
That they have we have these hot clouds they come over and you think it's going to be a lot cooler because the sun's going

01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:01.960
hiding but actually it's a hot cloud and it does a

01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:04.120
it does a

01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:09.800
Wind from the top and it does a they call it a convection oven because what it does is it blows

01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:12.440
heat like um

01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:17.640
Like a hairdryer like it's been plugged in like a plugged in hairdryer and that will

01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:22.120
cause um, if you're doing laundry, you don't have to drive

01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:24.920
Right. Yeah

01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:29.160
So what you're saying is you guys out there you can't hang your clothes up

01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:35.160
Oh, no, you can you can that will dry that that's totally different. Well, you said it's 99

01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:38.600
Yeah, what about if it's a thousand you could you?

01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:43.960
Okay, you you you can put it outside the heat from the sun is going to dry it dry your clothes

01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:47.640
What about if it's like a nine like nine hundred percent humidity?

01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:52.200
It doesn't matter. It's just going to be more damp on your clothes. It's not going to be super dry

01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:57.960
It's going to take longer to dry it. So it's going to be what's the highest percent you can get before it's it's wet

01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:01.960
100 percent 100 percent is total rain. Oh, no a thousand percent

01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:05.320
No, 100 percent. Well, you can't go a thousand percent

01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:08.920
Well, you can yes, you can't because there's that that's the number percentage it is

01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:11.800
That's the highest number per thousand. No, no, no

01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:16.280
You you can't go over a hundred percent go go ahead and watch all the all the news

01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:19.880
Uh, it goes up to a hundred percent. It's pure rain

01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:24.280
You know when they go ahead and say it's 80 chance of rain. They'll never go above a hundred percent

01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:26.600
I swear I saw once they said

01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:33.080
500 chance of rain and it was yeah, and it was and it definitely rained the next day very hard

01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:35.880
I think that's probably you know, I think that's probably the thing

01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:40.120
It's different where I live and where you live because the here the rain is different more

01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:45.240
Doesn't happen as much. So when it does happen, they say hey look you really got to look out for the rain

01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:51.720
It's going to be a 500 percent rain not just an 80 percent because people around here like they don't believe it because people here are stupid

01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:53.720
So they don't get it. Yeah

01:57:53.720 --> 01:57:59.080
Yeah, that's interesting. Well, well then how come those glasses the how come the zoomers they um, they say like

01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:01.080
magnifies

01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:03.080
300 percent

01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:05.800
300 percent what you see with the naked eye

01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:11.400
So 300 so that's a that's a percent that I thought it can't go over a hundred though

01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:16.520
No, that's different. Okay. I don't understand that that is uh,

01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:19.240
if you can see good at

01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:26.200
40 feet, uh, you know 40 yards right 300 300 percent in is you you that much closer to you

01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:33.560
So it's like a horse. It's like if you rode on a horse toward the item that you're looking at but didn't ride on it

01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:36.760
Correct. Okay. So is it it's a have like a stabilizer?

01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:40.600
So if you're on a horse you can still look at it does not no stabilizer

01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:46.360
Okay, because I would want to I would we want to use them with a horse because that's the best way to get toward birds

01:58:46.520 --> 01:58:49.720
Because the horses don't scare birds like a car does

01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:54.120
Correct same with lizards lizards don't mind horses. Did you know that?

01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:59.720
Correct. Yeah, that's weird. I don't know for some reason lizards are not bothered by horses

01:59:00.440 --> 01:59:04.840
But they are bothered by dogs. I tried to do I have a very large dog

01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:07.320
It's a double st. Bernard

01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:12.040
It's like a st. Bernard, but it's brood brood in russia and it's very large and you can ride it

01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:14.360
You know, it doesn't like to be ridden but you can ride it

01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:18.520
And it will allow you to get super close to the lizards to take their pictures

01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:25.000
But you you think so but it scares them away. So I got a horse instead and the horses just don't

01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:27.720
I think the horses and lizards are friends because they're both

01:59:28.360 --> 01:59:31.880
Um, the same the same family or something so they don't scare them

01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:37.400
And so I will be riding the horse toward the lizards and the birds

01:59:38.360 --> 01:59:40.360
And that's why I need a shock absorber

01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:44.280
But those don't have them, huh?

01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:48.920
No, so they do not happen. Okay, but you could mount anything on there, right? Like once I get them

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
I can do whatever I want to them

01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:56.120
Correct. So you can't drive with them, but you can ride a horse. No problem

01:59:57.160 --> 02:00:03.480
Correct. Okay, right. Is that because the horses they are more friendly and stuff like toward a lizard? No

02:00:04.200 --> 02:00:11.320
No, no, it's uh, it's it's just it on spook. That's all it is. Oh, it's a spook, right? Okay. Yeah, because like you were saying if you

02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:15.480
You because a horse if you're gonna stop early because you've got your

02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:19.400
There's zoomies you can see far you see that lizard far ahead

02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:23.720
Or maybe a spider and you stop the person behind you on a horse will

02:00:24.120 --> 02:00:27.560
Their horse knows that you stopped and you don't they don't have to hit the brakes, right?

02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:33.320
Correct. Yeah, see that's what I think I might try this out now when I do the car drive is when I

02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:38.360
Someone ahead of me breaks for no reason and I don't see anything. I don't see like a wall

02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:42.120
Or a stop sign or like a person or like a child

02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:49.560
I'm just gonna keep just hit give them a little tap because that way you can collect insurance because they they are at fault for stopping

02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:54.840
Hmm. Yeah, I I have a friend who did that actually who um made

02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:58.840
He's made all of his money doing that just by what he does

02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:03.320
He drives around real fast and he just if somebody does the wrong

02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:07.880
Um move in traffic. He just lets him know he teaches them, you know

02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:11.080
You know, you have sometimes you have to teach people the hard way and that's just you have to hit them

02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:17.960
Yeah, and but that's okay cars are made for that. So we all know which way we're gonna go, you know, I'm saying

02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:21.400
Yeah

02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:26.360
Okay, and the so is that it's that a thousand percent thing that will work out

02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:30.360
Correct. Okay, because that's so that's a thousand percent always

02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:33.240
Okay, okay great

02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:39.160
I'm good with okay you too. Make sure you uh when you find when you follow up on that

02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:44.440
Be sure to look out and let me know if there's a lizard you see any sizes of the one I was mentioning

02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:47.160
Yeah, great. Okay

02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:51.080
Okay, that sounds good. And just let me know there if ever

02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:53.720
reoccurs there

02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:57.800
Okay, okay, great. Um, I'm gonna try to figure out this this trip

02:01:57.800 --> 02:02:03.560
Uh, because I think if I get them to go on the trip and I can see how far we're going to be there for

02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:10.360
Okay, it sounds good. Okay. Is that something that I would want to get an extra one for or what do you think?

02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:15.240
No, it's a buy one get one free offer. Okay, so if I I could

02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:18.680
Is it possible to double them up to wear them to stack them?

02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:22.680
No, there is no what is that because why is that?

02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:28.680
Because it just fits on the side of your head. You can't double it, but I could I could put it on there on the front

02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:35.880
No, it won't fit because you got to push them out further. They won't go. Oh, so it's like a it's like a telescope

02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:41.000
It's uh similar but but it just like a pair of glasses

02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:46.840
You can't put two on because the glasses get in the way of each other. Oh, I I put two glasses on before

02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:52.920
You just put them on on top of the one that's underneath the other one

02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:58.680
You know, you ever had double done double sunglasses or sometimes say my uncle has

02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:00.680
prescription

02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:04.600
Glasses, but he also wears sunglasses and he'll put his sunglasses on over

02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:11.000
The prescriptors and then he just does it and you know, he goes hunting and he drives that way he'll fish

02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:13.160
So

02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:15.480
I'm gonna do that too, but when I'm on vacation

02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:17.480
Okay, okay

02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:20.360
That sounds good. Um

02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:22.760
Thanks for telling me all that about weather

02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:25.400
Okay, great

02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:30.200
Are you gonna figure out what you what to call the weather because you said you just not hot

02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:35.480
God, yeah, just go online and search it on google. What should I search?

02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:40.680
Just go to google and search weather. Okay. No, I'm gonna search. What do you call it?

02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:44.840
When it's what temperature do you say it is? Yeah

02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:49.160
When it when it gets up above, uh, when

02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:53.960
It uh, you made these up above 70 percent 70

02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:56.040
Percent

02:03:56.040 --> 02:03:58.040
Then what I type in then after that

02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:02.280
Just see what it pulls up with that just type in see what it pulls up after that

02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:08.760
Correct. Okay. When it gets up above 70 percent see what it

02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:13.000
Pull hold on pulls up after that

02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:19.800

spokesman.com

02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:27.000
Um, us and news world

02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:31.960
Uh, philadelphia has a descent of 500 feet above the ground

02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:37.960
Kevin slavin how algorithms shape our world

02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:40.920
Here's one. Um

02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:44.760
Journalist has fallen 10 percent. I don't see anything about weather here

02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:47.720
Yeah, what else I put your state

02:04:48.040 --> 02:04:54.040
The first thing you told me was that it's not hot out. You said it's not hot even though it's almost it's in the 90s

02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:57.960
But you didn't say it's not double warm. What would you call it then?

02:04:57.960 --> 02:05:04.200
To me it's not hot though. What was that?

02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:09.320
To me, it's not hot. Okay. But what would you call it then? You just say not hot

02:05:10.120 --> 02:05:14.840
No, just warm. Just warm. Okay. How much cooler does it have to get to be not warm?

02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:20.040
Down to 20 degrees 20 degrees

02:05:20.680 --> 02:05:21.720
Wow

02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:26.120
So you mean 20 degrees all the way up to 80 degrees is warm

02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:30.360
Just warm. Yeah, what do you call it when it's below 20?

02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:34.440
It's cool cool

02:05:34.760 --> 02:05:36.760
20 to what is cool

02:05:37.560 --> 02:05:44.200
20 to a minus 10 minus 10 is cool. Wow. That's pretty interesting. Then what do you call it below minus 10?

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:50.760
Then it gets cold. Okay, then how how much further does it get before it gets something else besides cold?

02:05:50.760 --> 02:05:55.320
No, you can't get below cold. It's just cold. You can't get below cold?

02:05:56.200 --> 02:05:59.960
Nope. Oh man, I didn't know that. I thought you can't. What about coldests?

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:06.600
No, because it's no no coldest is just an adjective. Okay

02:06:07.800 --> 02:06:15.160
So it's just an adjective. So basically coldest is cold can be negative 10 all the way down to to the point in which

02:06:15.160 --> 02:06:23.160
Uh matter stops moving because it is zero degrees, huh? Correct. So zero degrees is the coldest it gets, right?

02:06:23.960 --> 02:06:25.960
Nope. Oh, what's the coldest it gets?

02:06:30.040 --> 02:06:32.040
Mmm

02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:35.960
Minus 50 minus 60 so it's never gets colder than that ever

02:06:37.160 --> 02:06:39.880
No, well, it's nothing has been registered now

02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:45.400
So and the wow so the history of the world and it's never gotten colder than 60 degrees below

02:06:46.040 --> 02:06:52.040
The zero nothing nothing that has been registered. Okay, not been registered. So you think maybe like when dinosaurs were here

02:06:52.040 --> 02:06:58.200
It got really cold like negative. Well, that's what everybody does what everybody froze with. Yeah, they did they all froze

02:06:59.080 --> 02:07:02.520
Yeah, well that think of a think of a glacier. Yeah, what's that?

02:07:02.520 --> 02:07:10.120
Oh, it's moving eyes. How does that work because ice is hard? It's like I got I got to get going. Oh, we're gonna go

02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:17.080
I got other calls. I got to take all you do. Okay. Well, I can talk with them or I can wait if you want to

02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:31.560
Okay, what do you think we should do gotta hang up. Okay. I'll see you later. Goodbye. Bye
