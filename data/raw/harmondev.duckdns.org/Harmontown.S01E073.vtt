00:00.000 --> 00:29.520
Good evening! Welcome to the historic episode number 73 of Harmontown episode 73. Please welcome to the stage your mayor Mr. Dan

00:29.520 --> 00:53.520
Harmont! Hello, thank you. Guest Comptroller Erin McGathy. How are you doing? How did it go? Starting the show. I think it went okay. I got some encouragement from the

00:53.520 --> 01:07.520
front row. Oh yeah? Shouldn't you? Yeah, I mean before the show they're like, oh hey, how's it going? The second row was like, fuck you. They're all holding it, giving me a thumbs down, shaking their heads back and forth.

01:07.520 --> 01:35.520
Thanks for coming on Emmy night and Breaking Bad night. We appreciate it. I'm back. I got an iPhone. I'm back. So I'm not wearing my eye Harmon tonight, which is my notepad that I've been using, only because I'm going to give it a field test. I'm going to give Evernote another week. I'm going to see if Evernote works for keeping track of stuff, which so far it does not. It doesn't work. But I did just use my fingerprint to open my phone and that's disturbing.

01:35.520 --> 01:59.520
They say that the fingerprint is stored on the chip inside the phone and that will therefore be accessible to the national security agency. It's already been hacked. Yeah, it's in a chip on a phone. I was never a part of the vote where they said, hey, we're going to give everything but the things in the chips on the

01:59.520 --> 02:11.520
phone to the national security agency. I was never a part of that. I'm sure they would have said that was okay too, right? Sure. We're putting it in the iCloud. The cloud has a border around it.

02:11.520 --> 02:30.520
Dan, how long do you think it'll be before a jealous boyfriend or girlfriend cuts off their partner's thumb? Oh, and uses it to unlock their phone. Yeah. Well, there's definitely going to be a lot of like sleepy past out sleeping use your phone. Just lifting a limp hand up.

02:30.520 --> 02:49.520
Yeah, well people cut off penises and stuff. Of course, you go through people's purses. If you're in an unhealthy relationship, you're yelling at each other and then you get drunk and then you pass out, then someone's going to use the thumb to, yeah, for sure.

02:49.520 --> 03:02.520
And I feel like people justify a lot of bad behaviors where it's like breaking into their partner's phone like, oh, I was checking the thing and then I came across these things. It's pretty hard to get around the thumb print thing. It's an obvious thing. This has been thumb print talk.

03:02.520 --> 03:19.520
Yeah. I just had the air taken out of the thing I really wanted to talk about tonight, which is something that Duncan Trussell told me earlier tonight, which is that the first cybernetic cyborg hate crime happened at a French McDonald's. But it happened like two years ago. It happened like July of 2012.

03:19.520 --> 03:35.520
And there was a guy in a French McDonald's that had a cybernetic eye. And yeah, people were like, take off that camera. And he was like, it's my eye. It's bolted to my skull. I'm a cyborg. And it was, he was a cyborg.

03:35.520 --> 03:50.520
And they tried to rip it off like a kid, like, you know, like in a comedic, like, take off that beard. You're in disguise. And it's like, ow, I'm Santa Claus. Except they tried to rip his eye out of his head.

03:50.520 --> 04:05.520
Uh, ostensibly, because they're French, I guess, and they're like, both more passionate and have less technology. I don't like, because I'm sure this guy had to be either Canadian or American, right? He's gonna have a robot eye. And yeah, they tried to rip his eye out of his head.

04:05.520 --> 04:17.520
And people were calling it the first cyborg hate crime. But it happened a year ago. So who cares? And I looked it up and it wasn't like, you have a picture in your head of like, like a cyborg eye, like a terminator.

04:17.520 --> 04:30.520
He's got like a, it's like a Google, half of a Google Glass is bolted to his head. He's the one who chose to bolt it, like, could easily just wear it, make it rip offable. I'm just saying, just when you look at it, you're kind of like, yeah, take it off.

04:30.520 --> 04:55.520
It's kind of like a fedora. It was like, no, I have a really tingly scalp. So I staple my hat to my head. They said no hats in here. They tried to rip it off. And it rips my, my, my skin off. Like, it's like yikes. That's terrible. But like, nothing, but nothing. I mean, I wasn't, I wasn't going to say he deserves it. I've got a camera bolted to his head.

04:55.520 --> 05:03.520
Don't rip it off. But anyways, I just want to talk about how disappointing it is to find out in the green room that that happened a year ago.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.520
Are you going to talk to Duncan about it?

05:05.520 --> 05:14.520
Yeah, I'm going to text him and say, yeah, thanks for the scoop jackass. First cyborg hate crime. I'm going to go put a camera in his head.

05:14.520 --> 05:18.520
All right, so let's just review some things.

05:18.520 --> 05:21.520
So we had a good, good Saturday yesterday.

05:21.520 --> 05:22.520
Yeah.

05:22.520 --> 05:23.520
Harmon and McGathey style.

05:23.520 --> 05:24.520
Bed Springer.

05:24.520 --> 05:30.520
Yeah, yeah. I definitely got out of bed today. Absolutely because I wanted to.

05:30.520 --> 05:31.520
Yeah.

05:31.520 --> 05:33.520
Like I was, there was nothing left to do in bed.

05:33.520 --> 05:42.520
I absolutely reached my limit as I was waking up to the credits of how to succeed in business without really trying at 5am. I was like, it is time to get out of bed.

05:42.520 --> 05:57.520
Yeah. Yesterday we watched Super 8 in time with Justin Timberlake. A little bit of the host. Just a little bit of the Twilight Ladies Alien movie.

05:57.520 --> 06:05.520
Branded. Tried to watch a little bit of Branded. Batman and Robin and Batman Forever.

06:05.520 --> 06:12.520
And yeah, how to succeed in business without really trying. But what we didn't get around to watching is something I'm kind of excited about because of the iTunes description.

06:12.520 --> 06:23.520
It's called the Dinosaur Project. It's on iTunes and the iTunes description is, Dinosaur Project is a team of explorers searching for a mythical creature.

06:23.520 --> 06:28.520
What mythical creature?

06:28.520 --> 06:39.520
When their helicopter is brought down by a flock of enormous birds, they discover strange creatures which civilization has thought extinct for millions of years.

06:39.520 --> 06:42.520
The dinosaurs are the title.

06:42.520 --> 06:45.520
And describe the art on the cover of the movie.

06:45.520 --> 06:46.520
I don't know if I can.

06:46.520 --> 06:50.520
Well, it's people running from dinosaurs.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.520
Identifiable dinosaurs.

06:52.520 --> 06:58.520
The Dinosaur Project. But the summary of it, they're really trying to skirt the, like, let's make this a bigger deal.

06:58.520 --> 06:59.520
Yeah.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.520
Yeah, that there are creatures that no one's aware of.

07:01.520 --> 07:09.520
But I'm getting tapped because I don't, you know, this is one of those nights. I'm telling you, I got nothing. I got nothing to talk about.

07:09.520 --> 07:13.520
And you're here and...

07:13.520 --> 07:14.520
What?

07:14.520 --> 07:18.520
Oh, you weren't crazy about Super 8.

07:18.520 --> 07:27.520
I like the first half hour of it and then, you know, as it slowly became a movie about a spider monster.

07:27.520 --> 07:32.520
Okay, I wasn't trying to throw you under the bus. I didn't think it was really funny watching Dan. I've seen the movie before.

07:32.520 --> 07:35.520
Watching Dan watch that movie just be like, oh, it's just a spider monster.

07:35.520 --> 07:41.520
And you learn that Dan's experience of watching Super 8 was just like, oh, I can't wait to see what bizarre new monster this is.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.520
The payoff that I'm being promised, the payoff.

07:43.520 --> 07:44.520
The payoff is friendship.

07:44.520 --> 07:45.520
Super payoff.

07:45.520 --> 07:46.520
Super payoff.

07:46.520 --> 07:58.520
If your movie's about a spider monster and it's CG, you can just show it crawling out of a thing and reveal it and then tell a story about dealing with it.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.520
You don't have to hide it from me.

08:00.520 --> 08:08.520
That doesn't make it magical. You can't tell me it's magical. That's not fair. That's not fair.

08:08.520 --> 08:18.520
It's not magical just because you don't show it. That's not a magical creature. It's a spider monster. It's from Mars and it wants to go back home.

08:18.520 --> 08:26.520
And I would like to see the spider monster as early as possible and I'd like to learn what makes it tick and then get on with the story of the spider monster.

08:26.520 --> 08:34.520
I do not want to hear the three hour story of what's that and have the third act be, it's a spider monster.

08:34.520 --> 08:39.520
Just a very well shot, very, very beautiful film.

08:39.520 --> 08:44.520
It's about a spider monster and there's just no covering that up these days.

08:44.520 --> 08:48.520
I got a cyborg eye called Apple TV. I can rewind. I know it's a spider monster.

08:48.520 --> 08:51.520
All right.

08:51.520 --> 09:03.520
Our next guest waited in line for 12 hours to buy my new iPhone for me and didn't get his own.

09:03.520 --> 09:09.520
Which I wanted to buy him in exchange for him doing that. His name is Spencer Crittenden.

09:09.520 --> 09:17.520
Spencer!

09:17.520 --> 09:22.520
Do you want to be a guest for a change? Do you want to sit and...

09:22.520 --> 09:29.520
Oh boy. That question just overloaded him.

09:29.520 --> 09:35.520
There's three chairs up there. Two microphones.

09:35.520 --> 09:40.520
Thanks for waiting in line for me the night before the iPhone came out.

09:40.520 --> 09:42.520
I'm still kind of out of it.

09:42.520 --> 09:44.520
Did it throw up your schedule a little bit?

09:44.520 --> 09:48.520
Yeah, a little.

09:48.520 --> 09:55.520
I didn't sleep and then I slept and now I'm okay kind of.

09:55.520 --> 10:00.520
That's how it works. How did...

10:00.520 --> 10:04.520
How does waiting in line to buy an iPhone work? That's something I don't know.

10:04.520 --> 10:09.520
It's kind of boring. I'm not sociable.

10:09.520 --> 10:13.520
So I got there and I didn't really talk to anybody.

10:13.520 --> 10:17.520
But other people were talking to people around me and that was great.

10:17.520 --> 10:19.520
What were those people like?

10:19.520 --> 10:20.520
What were the people?

10:20.520 --> 10:24.520
Yeah, the people around you. What were the conversations? What was the scene?

10:24.520 --> 10:30.520
About being cold and whether or not the bathrooms are working.

10:30.520 --> 10:32.520
Where were the bathrooms?

10:32.520 --> 10:36.520
They were, you know, around. It was an outdoor mall.

10:36.520 --> 10:42.520
There's two kinds of bathrooms. They were both locked at some point.

10:42.520 --> 10:46.520
These are the details of people that I want. I don't know about people.

10:46.520 --> 10:51.520
I want to know, you're out on the sidewalk. You're outside an Apple store.

10:51.520 --> 10:54.520
I'm in a camp chair.

10:54.520 --> 10:55.520
You brought a chair?

10:55.520 --> 10:59.520
Yeah, you gotta bring a chair.

10:59.520 --> 11:01.520
So where do you make the pee-pees?

11:01.520 --> 11:03.520
In the bathroom.

11:03.520 --> 11:05.520
Which one? Who's bathroom?

11:05.520 --> 11:07.520
It's the mall bathroom. It's public.

11:07.520 --> 11:08.520
Oh, okay.

11:08.520 --> 11:11.520
Yeah, you go up these stairs and there's a bathroom.

11:11.520 --> 11:14.520
And I went and there was a guy out there and he was like,

11:14.520 --> 11:16.520
don't go in the bathroom, man. And I was like, what?

11:16.520 --> 11:19.520
And he was like, it's all dark. I couldn't find the light.

11:19.520 --> 11:24.520
And I was like, oh, well, I mean, I've peed in the dark before.

11:24.520 --> 11:29.520
Also, how dare he slap his limitations on you like that?

11:29.520 --> 11:34.520
I couldn't find the light switch. Everyone, everyone stop eliminating.

11:34.520 --> 11:37.520
Yeah, I was like, just don't, just don't follow me in there.

11:37.520 --> 11:42.520
And I just went in there and, you know, my iPhone has a flashlight function.

11:42.520 --> 11:46.520
Yeah, very funny that a guy in line for new technology was like, dark.

11:46.520 --> 11:47.520
Yeah.

11:47.520 --> 11:51.520
Well, yeah, that would be it. That's the point of being an Apple guy is,

11:51.520 --> 11:53.520
yeah, Apple takes care of that.

11:53.520 --> 11:56.520
Like Apple turned the lights off. I don't know what to do.

11:56.520 --> 12:00.520
So wait, he didn't want you to follow him into the bathroom?

12:00.520 --> 12:03.520
No, I told him not to follow me because he's a weird guy

12:03.520 --> 12:06.520
telling people about stuff going on in the bathroom.

12:06.520 --> 12:08.520
You said don't follow me to someone?

12:08.520 --> 12:10.520
Yeah.

12:10.520 --> 12:12.520
You were saying I'm going to go check this out.

12:12.520 --> 12:16.520
Yeah, well, he was presumably out of the bathroom having gone in there

12:16.520 --> 12:19.520
and I was going in there in spite of his warning.

12:19.520 --> 12:21.520
So he might be like, oh, what's all the fuss about?

12:21.520 --> 12:23.520
Or he might be like, I'm going to murder that guy.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.520
I mean, who am I to judge?

12:25.520 --> 12:28.520
But don't follow me in there seemed to be fair.

12:28.520 --> 12:32.520
Can you describe this bath town bathroom crier?

12:32.520 --> 12:37.520
He was, he was a Mexican guy with a short, spiky hair.

12:37.520 --> 12:39.520
Maybe five foot four.

12:39.520 --> 12:40.520
Fine, you know.

12:40.520 --> 12:43.520
Are you not using any kind of race because you're not racist?

12:43.520 --> 12:44.520
He said Mexican.

12:44.520 --> 12:45.520
Oh, okay.

12:45.520 --> 12:46.520
Definitely.

12:46.520 --> 12:47.520
I didn't hear it because I'm not racist.

12:47.520 --> 12:48.520
Nice.

12:52.520 --> 12:55.520
Okay, so a tiny, tiny man?

12:55.520 --> 12:56.520
Yeah.

12:56.520 --> 12:57.520
He said five foot four?

12:57.520 --> 12:58.520
He's small, yeah.

12:58.520 --> 12:59.520
Sorry if you're in the audience and you're five foot four

12:59.520 --> 13:03.520
and you don't like being called tiny.

13:03.520 --> 13:06.520
So definitely compared to you, a tiny, tiny little man.

13:06.520 --> 13:07.520
Yeah, a lot of people are.

13:07.520 --> 13:08.520
Don't go in the bathroom.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.520
I can't find the light.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.520
And you said, okay, don't follow me.

13:12.520 --> 13:13.520
Yeah.

13:13.520 --> 13:15.520
And went in the bathroom and found the lighter.

13:15.520 --> 13:16.520
Just use your iPhone as a.

13:16.520 --> 13:18.520
Well, I was like, I'll take my chances.

13:18.520 --> 13:21.520
And then he was like, well, I mean, I looked all around.

13:21.520 --> 13:23.520
It's really, really dark in there.

13:23.520 --> 13:24.520
And I was like, I'll be fine.

13:24.520 --> 13:26.520
Just don't, don't come in there.

13:31.520 --> 13:32.520
Oh man.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.520
Something happened with that guy and his mom at a certain point.

13:35.520 --> 13:38.520
Something, something where he went into the room and he's like, mom,

13:38.520 --> 13:40.520
like the lights out and she came in and turned the light on and,

13:40.520 --> 13:42.520
and beat him with a hammer.

13:42.520 --> 13:45.520
Just with a lamp.

13:45.520 --> 13:49.520
So he loves and hates light.

13:49.520 --> 13:54.520
So the, was he a fellow Apple liner?

13:54.520 --> 13:55.520
I think he was.

13:55.520 --> 13:56.520
Yeah.

13:56.520 --> 13:58.520
And that was at about 2 30 in the morning.

13:58.520 --> 14:01.520
I think most people out were that there was a, you know,

14:01.520 --> 14:03.520
some security guards and cops rolling around.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.520
But other than that, it was just Apple people.

14:05.520 --> 14:08.520
And was he, was he waiting for you when you came out?

14:08.520 --> 14:09.520
Did you say that already?

14:09.520 --> 14:10.520
He was still there.

14:10.520 --> 14:11.520
He hadn't moved.

14:11.520 --> 14:12.520
I went pretty fast.

14:12.520 --> 14:15.520
I was, you know, ready to defend myself.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.520
So, yeah.

14:17.520 --> 14:18.520
He was still there?

14:18.520 --> 14:19.520
Yeah.

14:19.520 --> 14:20.520
Waiting outside the bathroom?

14:20.520 --> 14:21.520
Not waiting outside.

14:21.520 --> 14:25.520
He was, there's like a kind of area that's like a balcony over these stairs

14:25.520 --> 14:27.520
because you got to go upstairs.

14:27.520 --> 14:31.520
So it's like, he was at a balcony overlooking this place

14:31.520 --> 14:35.520
when he, you know, told me of the bathroom's lights.

14:35.520 --> 14:36.520
Yeah.

14:36.520 --> 14:37.520
And so yeah.

14:37.520 --> 14:39.520
And he just stayed there and watched you go to the bathroom

14:39.520 --> 14:41.520
and come back out.

14:41.520 --> 14:43.520
Yeah, I'm sure.

14:43.520 --> 14:46.520
I don't, I don't think of it like that, but.

14:46.520 --> 14:48.520
Who saved your place in line when you were using the bathroom?

14:48.520 --> 14:49.520
No one.

14:49.520 --> 14:50.520
I had my chair there.

14:50.520 --> 14:53.520
So a lot of people, once they had chairs going on,

14:53.520 --> 14:55.520
they were getting up and leaving and coming back.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.520
Sort of an honor system.

14:56.520 --> 15:02.520
But how much, how much are you allowed to stretch that?

15:02.520 --> 15:03.520
How much did you see it stretch?

15:03.520 --> 15:06.520
Like the idea of just putting a chair there and just taking off.

15:06.520 --> 15:08.520
The person who was like the fifth in line was bullshit.

15:08.520 --> 15:10.520
It was just some old lady and.

15:10.520 --> 15:14.520
She just put a chair out and fucking went home and watched.

15:14.520 --> 15:16.520
She went down for four, she left for four hours,

15:16.520 --> 15:19.520
came back for a half hour, left for about seven hours,

15:19.520 --> 15:23.520
came back two minutes or two hours before opening.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.520
But other than that, wasn't there at all.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.520
So like most of the time she wasn't even there.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.520
So that was kind of bullshit.

15:29.520 --> 15:30.520
Yeah.

15:30.520 --> 15:31.520
That's interesting.

15:31.520 --> 15:32.520
This concept.

15:32.520 --> 15:34.520
This is the other thing that haunts me.

15:34.520 --> 15:37.520
If you had not waited in line for me so I could have my precious iPhone

15:37.520 --> 15:38.520
the next day.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.520
How long would it have taken?

15:40.520 --> 15:42.520
Was there a line the next day?

15:42.520 --> 15:46.520
They would have been sold out the next day of most stuff.

15:46.520 --> 15:49.520
Especially that, that model.

15:49.520 --> 15:53.520
So the night that you spent in a lawn chair and a sidewalk

15:53.520 --> 15:58.520
earned me how many days with an iPhone that I wouldn't have had.

15:58.520 --> 15:59.520
I mean six to seven.

15:59.520 --> 16:00.520
Six to seven.

16:00.520 --> 16:01.520
All right.

16:01.520 --> 16:02.520
Spencer.

16:02.520 --> 16:03.520
All right.

16:03.520 --> 16:04.520
All right.

16:04.520 --> 16:07.520
Dan Harmon too.

16:07.520 --> 16:11.520
For not abusing his employees.

16:11.520 --> 16:16.520
I got seven days out of his 12 hours.

16:16.520 --> 16:17.520
Pretty good.

16:17.520 --> 16:18.520
I felt bad.

16:18.520 --> 16:21.520
I told him to get himself one and then he couldn't.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.520
Because he was an Apple employee.

16:23.520 --> 16:24.520
Yeah.

16:24.520 --> 16:28.520
I had an employee account that gave me like a cheap bill.

16:28.520 --> 16:31.520
But as a result I was like locked onto bullshit.

16:31.520 --> 16:34.520
And I, you know, stopped being an employee.

16:34.520 --> 16:37.520
But I guess I didn't stop having a plan so I couldn't get a phone.

16:37.520 --> 16:40.520
So it was more about your phone plan than your, than the Apple.

16:40.520 --> 16:41.520
Yeah.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.520
Well I got the phone plan because of Apple.

16:43.520 --> 16:47.520
But it was the phone plans, lockedness.

16:47.520 --> 16:49.520
It was just bureaucracies.

16:49.520 --> 16:50.520
All right.

16:50.520 --> 16:51.520
All right.

16:51.520 --> 16:52.520
Oh my gosh.

16:52.520 --> 16:54.520
You know what time it is?

16:54.520 --> 16:57.520
It's McAfee Game Corner time.

16:57.520 --> 16:58.520
Yeah.

16:58.520 --> 17:05.520
All right.

17:05.520 --> 17:06.520
All right.

17:06.520 --> 17:09.520
Welcome to McAfee's Game Corner.

17:09.520 --> 17:12.520
We'll do, Spencer, you want to play?

17:12.520 --> 17:14.520
Oh yeah.

17:14.520 --> 17:16.520
Can anyone else play?

17:16.520 --> 17:19.520
Like how many people can play?

17:19.520 --> 17:22.520
Are we, we could have one more person.

17:22.520 --> 17:26.520
But only if maybe he's created something with you in the past.

17:26.520 --> 17:29.520
And only if you've been, is that what you're doing?

17:29.520 --> 17:30.520
Well that's what I was thinking about.

17:30.520 --> 17:32.520
But I don't want to, I don't know what your game is.

17:32.520 --> 17:34.520
So I don't want, am I ruining it?

17:34.520 --> 17:46.520
Let's welcome Rob Schrab to the stage.

17:46.520 --> 17:49.520
Can I confess something that I just realized as I sat down?

17:49.520 --> 17:53.520
I didn't realize consciously I was doing this or I would have been honest about it.

17:53.520 --> 18:00.520
What I thought through my head was, if there was someone else up here, according to the format of the show, I get to sit down.

18:00.520 --> 18:03.520
The format of the show being me doing whatever I want.

18:03.520 --> 18:04.520
So I could have sat down.

18:04.520 --> 18:06.520
You could have started the show sitting.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.520
Yeah, I could roll out here on a surfboard.

18:08.520 --> 18:09.520
You could lay down.

18:09.520 --> 18:11.520
Kitten's pulling it, yeah.

18:11.520 --> 18:12.520
Anyways, thank you.

18:12.520 --> 18:13.520
How are you doing, Rob?

18:13.520 --> 18:14.520
I'm doing good.

18:14.520 --> 18:15.520
Wow, double making it.

18:15.520 --> 18:19.520
You're doing good, good, good, good.

18:19.520 --> 18:24.520
I just saw this Insidious Chapter 2, you ever see that?

18:24.520 --> 18:27.520
Anybody see this Insidious Chapter 2?

18:27.520 --> 18:29.520
What's Insidious 1?

18:29.520 --> 18:33.520
That's like, that's one of those kids' paranormal movies, right?

18:33.520 --> 18:35.520
Yeah, the first one is not too bad.

18:35.520 --> 18:37.520
Is it another with the camera?

18:37.520 --> 18:39.520
No, no, no, no, no.

18:39.520 --> 18:42.520
There were cameras involved.

18:42.520 --> 18:44.520
That's why I got to see it.

18:44.520 --> 18:49.520
Well, in our day, there were always cameras involved, but there was craftsmanship too.

18:49.520 --> 18:53.520
You didn't just put one of these things on a dresser and say,

18:53.520 --> 18:56.520
oh boy, I'm Citizen Kane now.

18:56.520 --> 18:58.520
I didn't like it.

18:58.520 --> 19:05.520
I know that felt like a setup that I was going to start doing like 15 minutes on why Insidious 2 was bad,

19:05.520 --> 19:07.520
but I just wanted to say I didn't like it.

19:07.520 --> 19:09.520
We can get on with the game.

19:09.520 --> 19:11.520
Did you see it in the theater?

19:11.520 --> 19:13.520
I saw it with Steve Agee.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.520
In the theater, yes.

19:15.520 --> 19:17.520
What's it like seeing a movie with Steve Agee?

19:17.520 --> 19:18.520
What's it like?

19:18.520 --> 19:19.520
Yeah.

19:19.520 --> 19:22.520
He leans forward a lot, which is kind of...

19:22.520 --> 19:28.520
You know what, I'll sit and crouch, but he'll like lean forward a lot, and that's weird.

19:28.520 --> 19:30.520
I think it's because he's really tall.

19:30.520 --> 19:32.520
I think it's because he's...

19:32.520 --> 19:34.520
He has anxiety about being a tall guy at a movie theater.

19:34.520 --> 19:35.520
I have that.

19:35.520 --> 19:39.520
We saw the conjuring together, which was really good.

19:39.520 --> 19:40.520
I really liked that.

19:40.520 --> 19:42.520
I thought it had some heightened moments.

19:42.520 --> 19:43.520
What did you see? What?

19:43.520 --> 19:44.520
The conjuring.

19:44.520 --> 19:45.520
The conjuring.

19:45.520 --> 19:46.520
It's another movie.

19:46.520 --> 19:47.520
Yeah.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.520
Is that about some kind of wizard or something?

19:49.520 --> 19:50.520
No.

19:50.520 --> 19:51.520
No is that...

19:51.520 --> 19:52.520
Like a Harry Potter thing?

19:52.520 --> 19:54.520
No, no, no, no, no.

19:54.520 --> 19:56.520
Is that one of those Hogwarts?

19:56.520 --> 19:58.520
No, no, no, no, no, no.

19:58.520 --> 20:00.520
Keep going, keep going.

20:01.520 --> 20:03.520
No, it was this thing.

20:03.520 --> 20:10.520
It started Ron Livingston and the guy that played Owlman from Watchmen that looks like Rob Hubel.

20:10.520 --> 20:12.520
Yeah, Rob Hubel from the Watchmen.

20:12.520 --> 20:14.520
Yeah, yeah, Rob Hubel from the Watchmen.

20:14.520 --> 20:16.520
Who's also an insidious too.

20:18.520 --> 20:22.520
And I heard that Rob Hubel auditioned for Abraham Lincoln Vampire.

20:22.520 --> 20:24.520
Wait, as Abraham Lincoln?

20:24.520 --> 20:26.520
As Abraham Lincoln, yeah.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.520
That'd be a different movie, wasn't it?

20:29.520 --> 20:31.520
I think it would go something like this.

20:31.520 --> 20:34.520
A four score and seven.

20:34.520 --> 20:35.520
Yeah.

20:35.520 --> 20:36.520
Do you hear that, Rob Hubel?

20:36.520 --> 20:37.520
That's what you sound like.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.520
That's what you sound like, Cubes.

20:39.520 --> 20:40.520
Where was I?

20:40.520 --> 20:45.520
No, we saw The Conjuring together and Watches Scary Movies with A.G. is awesome because he's like,

20:45.520 --> 20:49.520
Oh, oh, oh, oh, shit during all the tense moments.

20:49.520 --> 20:50.520
It was really fun.

20:50.520 --> 20:51.520
It was fun.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.520
This movie was so fun because it sucked.

20:54.520 --> 20:55.520
Insidious too, huh?

20:55.520 --> 20:56.520
Insidious too.

20:56.520 --> 20:59.520
So what, had you seen Insidious One?

20:59.520 --> 21:00.520
Yes, I did.

21:00.520 --> 21:01.520
Well, what's Insidious One?

21:01.520 --> 21:02.520
Give me the breakdown.

21:02.520 --> 21:03.520
Okay, give me the goods.

21:03.520 --> 21:04.520
Give me the decent.

21:04.520 --> 21:05.520
Insidious, Insidious One is...

21:05.520 --> 21:06.520
Give me the elevator pitch.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.520
Okay, okay, Insidious One is basic.

21:08.520 --> 21:09.520
Give me beginning, middle, end.

21:09.520 --> 21:10.520
Okay.

21:10.520 --> 21:11.520
Insidious One.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.520
5,000 words.

21:12.520 --> 21:13.520
It's basically Poltergeist.

21:13.520 --> 21:17.520
It's pain in and all of the slug lines.

21:17.520 --> 21:18.520
There's each location.

21:18.520 --> 21:19.520
Give me the one sheet.

21:19.520 --> 21:20.520
Okay, well...

21:20.520 --> 21:22.520
Give me the transportation budget.

21:22.520 --> 21:24.520
No, no, seriously.

21:24.520 --> 21:26.520
It's shot list.

21:26.520 --> 21:28.520
Try some story books.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.520
Give me the shipwreck comic strip of it.

21:30.520 --> 21:31.520
Give me the novelization.

21:31.520 --> 21:32.520
Yeah.

21:32.520 --> 21:33.520
The novelization.

21:33.520 --> 21:34.520
Okay.

21:34.520 --> 21:37.520
Give me just the McDonald's cups.

21:37.520 --> 21:38.520
Okay.

21:38.520 --> 21:41.520
I can't keep up with it.

21:41.520 --> 21:45.520
No, no, Insidious One is like this couple.

21:45.520 --> 21:47.520
They have a kid.

21:47.520 --> 21:48.520
He goes unconscious.

21:48.520 --> 21:50.520
He doesn't come out of consciousness.

21:50.520 --> 21:57.520
They find out that he has the ability to astral project, but got lost in this place called

21:57.520 --> 21:58.520
the further.

21:58.520 --> 22:03.520
And the thing about when you astrally project, your spirit goes out of your body, but then

22:03.520 --> 22:09.520
all, it's like your empty vessel of a body like draws ghosts who want to.

22:09.520 --> 22:12.520
It's like a lawn chair outside an Apple store.

22:12.520 --> 22:13.520
Yes.

22:13.520 --> 22:14.520
Yes.

22:14.520 --> 22:18.520
And all that stuff is like really good.

22:18.520 --> 22:23.520
And then it kind of at the end, it had some good stuff.

22:23.520 --> 22:25.520
It's just a spider monster.

22:25.520 --> 22:29.520
It was a four-legged spider monster.

22:29.520 --> 22:30.520
Interesting.

22:30.520 --> 22:31.520
Rob, how do you think that is?

22:31.520 --> 22:32.520
It's called Man.

22:32.520 --> 22:36.520
It asks the question.

22:36.520 --> 22:42.520
It's a movie that asks the question, who is the real spider monster?

22:42.520 --> 22:45.520
Isn't man just a four-legged spider monster?

22:45.520 --> 22:46.520
That's what I meant.

22:46.520 --> 22:47.520
That doesn't spin webs.

22:47.520 --> 22:48.520
That's what I meant by a four-legged.

22:48.520 --> 22:49.520
I know.

22:49.520 --> 22:50.520
I'm standing.

22:50.520 --> 22:52.520
I'm having fun with you.

22:52.520 --> 22:53.520
Okay.

22:53.520 --> 22:54.520
Good.

22:54.520 --> 23:01.520
Rob, how well do you think that prepared you for McGathey's Game Corner?

23:01.520 --> 23:02.520
Very well.

23:02.520 --> 23:03.520
Yes.

23:03.520 --> 23:04.520
All right.

23:04.520 --> 23:11.520
Oh my God, guys, that was my first good sound cue ever that I've ever done.

23:11.520 --> 23:12.520
Thanks.

23:12.520 --> 23:19.520
So Harmontown attracts a variety of dynamic and interesting characters.

23:19.520 --> 23:21.520
Man, stand up.

23:21.520 --> 23:25.520
One, two, three, four, sixteen.

23:25.520 --> 23:27.520
So many people.

23:27.520 --> 23:31.520
So many dynamic, interesting people who become a part of the show a few months ago.

23:31.520 --> 23:32.520
Stand up.

23:32.520 --> 23:33.520
I'm sorry.

23:33.520 --> 23:42.520
A few months ago, we were gifted with some beef jerky.

23:42.520 --> 23:45.520
Ooh, I heard about this.

23:45.520 --> 23:48.520
Ooh, the beef jerky.

23:48.520 --> 23:54.520
We were gifted by a man named Bill, who's sitting in the front row.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.520
That's Bill, Rob, in the black shirt.

23:56.520 --> 23:57.520
I heard about it.

23:57.520 --> 23:59.520
Bill, why don't you jump on the mic for this intro?

23:59.520 --> 24:00.520
Yeah, why don't you, Bill?

24:00.520 --> 24:01.520
Just for the intro.

24:01.520 --> 24:06.520
Okay, so I'm up here for five seconds and then I sit down, right?

24:06.520 --> 24:08.520
We'll see what happens.

24:08.520 --> 24:14.520
So Bill brought some very special beef jerky from Texas from this beef jerky distributor

24:14.520 --> 24:15.520
that he very much believes in.

24:15.520 --> 24:19.520
Did you close the Ziploc bag before you left Texas?

24:19.520 --> 24:21.520
Bill did everything right.

24:21.520 --> 24:24.520
This was a totally random bad luck experience.

24:24.520 --> 24:25.520
This is beef's fault.

24:25.520 --> 24:27.520
This is beef's fault.

24:27.520 --> 24:29.520
It's not necessarily the manufacturer's fault.

24:29.520 --> 24:31.520
It's just a random occurrence.

24:31.520 --> 24:32.520
Things happen.

24:32.520 --> 24:33.520
I just want to forget about it.

24:33.520 --> 24:35.520
Well, no, of course you can't.

24:35.520 --> 24:41.520
Has the game started?

24:41.520 --> 24:45.520
So Bill passed out the jerky.

24:45.520 --> 24:47.520
There was some mold on the jerky, whatever.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.520
There was a lot of mold.

24:49.520 --> 24:51.520
Okay, someone just said there's a lot of mold on the jerky.

24:51.520 --> 24:54.520
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

24:54.520 --> 24:59.520
Anyway, Bill, since then has sat in the front row and has become part of the landscape that

24:59.520 --> 25:01.520
is the Harmonton audience.

25:01.520 --> 25:10.520
So we are going to play a game called the Beef Fungus Bill Game.

25:10.520 --> 25:18.520
When you brought him up, I was reminded that he made a iPad stand.

25:18.520 --> 25:24.520
Bill obviously also makes us wood stuff.

25:24.520 --> 25:26.520
He made quotes on little slats for us, Harmonton quotes.

25:26.520 --> 25:31.520
By the way, Bill, remember the quote that we thought was erroneous or whatever that said?

25:31.520 --> 25:32.520
It wasn't.

25:32.520 --> 25:34.520
I said whatever was on there.

25:34.520 --> 25:36.520
Oh, that sounds like a point.

25:36.520 --> 25:38.520
It was written on an anus or something.

25:38.520 --> 25:39.520
Yeah.

25:39.520 --> 25:42.520
For some reason I said that, probably because I was on something else.

25:42.520 --> 25:43.520
Pittsburgh.

25:43.520 --> 25:49.520
And then also he made a Dungeon Master iPad stand for Spencer to Dungeon Master with.

25:49.520 --> 25:51.520
And Adam Goldberg.

25:51.520 --> 25:52.520
What?

25:52.520 --> 25:54.520
All right.

25:54.520 --> 25:57.520
So Bill, Bill is, we are aware.

25:57.520 --> 26:00.520
There's more than one prototype.

26:00.520 --> 26:04.520
We are aware of Bill, and Bill is part of Harmonton.

26:04.520 --> 26:06.520
But what do we really know about Bill, you guys?

26:06.520 --> 26:08.520
I just said it all.

26:08.520 --> 26:09.520
Right, exactly.

26:09.520 --> 26:10.520
That's all we know.

26:10.520 --> 26:11.520
Yeah, yeah.

26:11.520 --> 26:15.520
So earlier today, Bill sent me some true facts about himself.

26:15.520 --> 26:16.520
Oh, nice.

26:16.520 --> 26:17.520
All right.

26:17.520 --> 26:18.520
So thank you, Bill.

26:18.520 --> 26:19.520
You can go ahead and sit down.

26:19.520 --> 26:21.520
I know why your face delay affects the judging.

26:21.520 --> 26:22.520
But thank you.

26:22.520 --> 26:24.520
Let's give him a really big hand.

26:24.520 --> 26:31.520
Now, sweetie, can I ask you, when Bill sent you this email with all these true facts about himself,

26:31.520 --> 26:33.520
was that solicited?

26:33.520 --> 26:37.520
Or is this another situation?

26:37.520 --> 26:39.520
Oh, that's so flattering.

26:39.520 --> 26:40.520
I would be flattering.

26:40.520 --> 26:43.520
No, it was not a situation.

26:43.520 --> 26:45.520
What's the situation?

26:45.520 --> 26:48.520
Some guy sending her an email with a bunch of facts about himself.

26:48.520 --> 26:49.520
I'm solicited.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.520
Has this happened before?

26:51.520 --> 26:52.520
To you.

26:52.520 --> 26:54.520
Well, look at her, bro.

26:54.520 --> 26:56.520
Oh, that's very nice.

26:56.520 --> 26:57.520
That's very nice.

26:57.520 --> 26:58.520
Happens all the time.

26:58.520 --> 27:00.520
Avoiding the question.

27:00.520 --> 27:01.520
All right.

27:01.520 --> 27:04.520
She does a podcast where she says, hey, I care about you.

27:04.520 --> 27:05.520
I'm Erin McGathy.

27:05.520 --> 27:06.520
I'm your best friend.

27:06.520 --> 27:07.520
I care about your relationships.

27:07.520 --> 27:08.520
Here's all about mine.

27:08.520 --> 27:15.520
And it invites its fair share of intimacy from strangers.

27:15.520 --> 27:22.520
I wish that it came in the form of just facts about listeners.

27:22.520 --> 27:24.520
That would be fun.

27:24.520 --> 27:25.520
All right.

27:25.520 --> 27:28.520
So we're going to go ahead and play this game.

27:28.520 --> 27:30.520
There are, we have 10 questions.

27:30.520 --> 27:31.520
I'm sorry, sweetie.

27:31.520 --> 27:32.520
Can we get Rob a cup?

27:32.520 --> 27:33.520
I don't want a cup.

27:33.520 --> 27:34.520
No, we can get you a cup.

27:34.520 --> 27:35.520
Hold on.

27:35.520 --> 27:36.520
No, no, no.

27:36.520 --> 27:37.520
No.

27:37.520 --> 27:38.520
Keep going with your game thing.

27:38.520 --> 27:39.520
Go get with your game thing.

27:39.520 --> 27:40.520
Go get with your game thing.

27:40.520 --> 27:41.520
No, no.

27:41.520 --> 27:42.520
I'm sorry.

27:42.520 --> 27:44.520
I'm not going to interrupt anymore.

27:44.520 --> 27:45.520
I'm terribly sorry.

27:45.520 --> 27:46.520
Have a drink, Rob.

27:46.520 --> 27:49.520
We're going to get you a cup so you can have a drink.

27:49.520 --> 27:50.520
Okay.

27:50.520 --> 27:51.520
The explanation of this game is very, very brief.

27:51.520 --> 27:53.520
So I'm going to explain it very briefly.

27:53.520 --> 27:56.520
I have 10 questions.

27:56.520 --> 28:01.520
One, every question includes a true fact about Bill.

28:01.520 --> 28:03.520
The other things are not true.

28:03.520 --> 28:06.520
The three of you are going to, individually, you're on your own team.

28:06.520 --> 28:11.520
You're going to decide what is the true Bill fact.

28:11.520 --> 28:18.520
You are allowed to discuss it with each other, discuss it with yourself, explain why you

28:18.520 --> 28:23.520
discuss it with yourself, explain why you feel that way.

28:23.520 --> 28:25.520
So let's go ahead and get started.

28:25.520 --> 28:26.520
All right.

28:26.520 --> 28:29.520
One of these is true.

28:29.520 --> 28:31.520
We're picking the one that's true.

28:31.520 --> 28:32.520
You're picking the one that's true.

28:32.520 --> 28:33.520
Who goes first?

28:33.520 --> 28:34.520
Who goes first?

28:34.520 --> 28:39.520
We'll go, we'll do it counterclockwise, and we'll start with Spencer.

28:39.520 --> 28:40.520
We're in a line.

28:40.520 --> 28:41.520
I know.

28:41.520 --> 28:42.520
I just...

28:42.520 --> 28:44.520
Who's reading the clock?

28:44.520 --> 28:46.520
I just threw it out there.

28:46.520 --> 28:51.520
We'll start with Spencer, and we'll go Spencer, Dan, Rob, as far as who gets to give their

28:51.520 --> 28:53.520
final answer first.

28:53.520 --> 28:54.520
All right.

28:54.520 --> 28:56.520
Question number one.

28:56.520 --> 28:57.520
One of these is real.

28:57.520 --> 29:00.520
The other two are fake.

29:00.520 --> 29:04.520
Bill spells his name with one L because...

29:04.520 --> 29:07.520
And these are quotes.

29:07.520 --> 29:10.520
A, it's my own little pretentious contrivance.

29:10.520 --> 29:14.520
In honor of Sesame Street, two L's seems like a waste.

29:14.520 --> 29:17.520
B, it's my own little pretentious contrivance.

29:17.520 --> 29:20.520
My father was a two L'd Bill who earned both.

29:20.520 --> 29:23.520
I leave it to you to decide what that means.

29:23.520 --> 29:26.520
C, it's my own little pretentious contrivance.

29:26.520 --> 29:30.520
I enjoy correcting people.

29:30.520 --> 29:32.520
So it's me, right?

29:32.520 --> 29:35.520
Yeah, but you guys can discuss what you...

29:35.520 --> 29:38.520
Can we have some thought music?

29:38.520 --> 29:40.520
You can.

29:40.520 --> 29:44.520
I'm not the best DJ, but no, you can.

29:44.520 --> 29:47.520
I mean, it might be a cow farting, but I'll find something.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.520
Okay, I thought it'd be like, I don't know.

29:49.520 --> 29:50.520
Okay.

29:50.520 --> 29:54.520
I mean, when you hear the first one, you're like, this sounds like the real one.

29:54.520 --> 29:58.520
It sounds like it's trying to be clever, but all of them sounded like that.

29:58.520 --> 30:00.520
I know which one it is.

30:00.520 --> 30:01.520
Oh, do you?

30:01.520 --> 30:03.520
No, I mean, I think I know.

30:03.520 --> 30:05.520
Tell me which one you think it is.

30:05.520 --> 30:07.520
Well, it's the point for him to...

30:07.520 --> 30:09.520
Well, I want to win.

30:09.520 --> 30:14.520
You guys have a minute of discussing it out loud and making your points,

30:14.520 --> 30:16.520
and then you'll give your final answers.

30:16.520 --> 30:18.520
Okay, what's your thing?

30:18.520 --> 30:21.520
But if I share my reasoning, then they get to piggyback on my intuition.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.520
You're right.

30:23.520 --> 30:25.520
Okay, so we'll go down the line, Spencer.

30:25.520 --> 30:29.520
I want to finally answer from this guy before I swoop in and snatch it up.

30:29.520 --> 30:30.520
You're totally right.

30:30.520 --> 30:33.520
I want to hear what Dan has to say.

30:33.520 --> 30:35.520
Okay, but Spencer, in this round, you go first, so you decide.

30:35.520 --> 30:37.520
Okay, that makes sense.

30:37.520 --> 30:41.520
I'd like to pick A because, I mean, that sounds right.

30:41.520 --> 30:43.520
The Sesame Street...

30:43.520 --> 30:47.520
Yeah, because they value letter economy, right?

30:47.520 --> 30:50.520
I don't understand the Sesame Street reference.

30:50.520 --> 30:52.520
They value letter economy.

30:52.520 --> 30:53.520
They do?

30:53.520 --> 30:54.520
Well, letters are very important.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.520
Well, letters are their sponsor.

30:56.520 --> 31:00.520
You can't just have two.

31:00.520 --> 31:04.520
I still don't get the connection to Sesame Street, though.

31:04.520 --> 31:13.520
I understand letters are on the show.

31:13.520 --> 31:14.520
I don't understand why...

31:14.520 --> 31:15.520
I don't remember...

31:15.520 --> 31:18.520
I mean, I've seen them all, and I don't remember somebody coming out

31:18.520 --> 31:21.520
to never put two rows next to each other.

31:21.520 --> 31:27.520
I think they just imparted the value of an L to you to the extent that...

31:27.520 --> 31:28.520
Don't buy it.

31:28.520 --> 31:29.520
Yeah.

31:29.520 --> 31:32.520
Anyways, I'm going to go with B, and I'll tell you why.

31:32.520 --> 31:35.520
To the dad one, two L bill.

31:35.520 --> 31:36.520
That's the dad one.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.520
My dad, two Ls, whatever.

31:38.520 --> 31:42.520
I've met a lot of fellas who use their middle name as their first name,

31:42.520 --> 31:45.520
because people who spell their first name differently, etc.

31:45.520 --> 31:48.520
It always has to do with a fucked up relationship with their dad.

31:48.520 --> 31:50.520
We'll go with that.

31:50.520 --> 31:51.520
Alright, Rob?

31:51.520 --> 31:56.520
I'm going to take C, because that's the only one I remembered.

31:56.520 --> 31:58.520
I enjoy correcting people?

31:58.520 --> 31:59.520
Yes.

31:59.520 --> 32:00.520
Yes.

32:00.520 --> 32:03.520
That's exactly the one.

32:03.520 --> 32:09.520
The correct answer is A, the Sesame Street answer.

32:09.520 --> 32:10.520
That's not fair.

32:10.520 --> 32:12.520
He went first.

32:12.520 --> 32:16.520
Well, everyone would argue he was in the worst position.

32:16.520 --> 32:20.520
In this round, Dan will guess first, and then Rob and then Spencer.

32:20.520 --> 32:22.520
Question number two.

32:22.520 --> 32:24.520
Question number two.

32:24.520 --> 32:29.520
A, I want a Philo T Farnsworth Award for video art.

32:29.520 --> 32:35.520
B, I want a Philo Teen Farnsworth Award for my work with children's hospitals.

32:35.520 --> 32:40.520
C, I want a Philo Teen Farnsworth Award for urban planning.

32:40.520 --> 32:42.520
Why do you keep saying teen?

32:42.520 --> 32:43.520
Huh?

32:43.520 --> 32:44.520
T.

32:44.520 --> 32:45.520
Sorry.

32:45.520 --> 32:46.520
Teen Farnsworth.

32:46.520 --> 32:49.520
It's like a new Nickelodeon cartoon.

32:49.520 --> 32:53.520
I will go with A, because Philo T Farnsworth's invented television.

32:53.520 --> 32:58.520
Okay, I think we're learning about how much I know about Philo T Farnsworth.

32:58.520 --> 32:59.520
Sorry.

32:59.520 --> 33:02.520
Okay, go ahead, Rob.

33:02.520 --> 33:10.520
I don't know who this Philo guy is, but Bill seems like a kind of a video person.

33:10.520 --> 33:13.520
I'm also going to go with A.

33:13.520 --> 33:17.520
But I thought of that before Harmon said anything.

33:17.520 --> 33:22.520
And I would have got that first one if I had some music to think.

33:22.520 --> 33:27.520
What kind of shit are you running here on?

33:27.520 --> 33:36.520
I'm going to go with A, because I had a good reason for it.

33:36.520 --> 33:38.520
Alright, that is correct.

33:38.520 --> 33:39.520
It is A video art.

33:39.520 --> 33:40.520
We all win.

33:40.520 --> 33:42.520
We all tied up.

33:42.520 --> 33:46.520
T. Farnsworth was reportedly, I don't know if it's Urban Legends, supposedly was thought

33:46.520 --> 33:52.520
of the idea for television while mowing his lawn, noticed that the rows and columns of

33:52.520 --> 33:57.120
the different squares looked at them and kind of came up with the idea of what we would

33:57.120 --> 33:59.520
one day call pixels.

33:59.520 --> 34:00.520
Right.

34:00.520 --> 34:04.520
And the T is where we get TV from.

34:04.520 --> 34:05.520
That's correct.

34:05.520 --> 34:06.520
That is correct.

34:06.520 --> 34:09.520
The T was taken from his name.

34:09.520 --> 34:14.520
PhiloTV Farnsworth.

34:14.520 --> 34:17.520
The weird thing is the T stands for toilet.

34:17.520 --> 34:20.520
His dad always wanted him to invent the toilet.

34:20.520 --> 34:22.520
Fuck that.

34:22.520 --> 34:26.520
Philo, I didn't know you could name your kid after something you used to make necklaces

34:26.520 --> 34:27.520
with.

34:27.520 --> 34:28.520
Alright, number three.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.520
You can name your kid after everything.

34:30.520 --> 34:33.520
Oh, dirt.

34:33.520 --> 34:34.520
Or anything.

34:34.520 --> 34:36.520
But you can't name them a number.

34:36.520 --> 34:39.520
Somebody tried to name their kid a number in like Europe somewhere.

34:39.520 --> 34:40.520
And then another kid.

34:40.520 --> 34:41.520
A cyborg guy.

34:41.520 --> 34:44.520
Someone else tried to name their kid Adolf Hitler or something.

34:44.520 --> 34:48.520
Somebody tried to name their kid God.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.520
And they didn't let that happen?

34:50.520 --> 34:51.520
No, no.

34:51.520 --> 34:55.520
The judge said, no, that's just for, that name is for the creator.

34:55.520 --> 34:56.520
It was totally.

34:56.520 --> 34:57.520
That's fucked up.

34:57.520 --> 34:59.520
The Kanye West.

34:59.520 --> 35:00.520
The Hitler thing.

35:00.520 --> 35:02.520
I mean, come on, you can't fight City Hall.

35:02.520 --> 35:04.520
But, I mean, the God thing.

35:04.520 --> 35:06.520
What's that story?

35:06.520 --> 35:07.520
Whatever.

35:07.520 --> 35:08.520
Question number three.

35:08.520 --> 35:10.520
And this, Rob, you will answer this first.

35:10.520 --> 35:12.520
I promise there will be thinking music.

35:12.520 --> 35:13.520
Good.

35:13.520 --> 35:14.520
Question number three.

35:14.520 --> 35:18.520
When I was in grade school, I won two gold and several silver medals.

35:18.520 --> 35:19.520
Sorry.

35:19.520 --> 35:23.520
When I was in grade school, I won two gold and several silver medals for A.

35:23.520 --> 35:24.520
Science.

35:24.520 --> 35:25.520
B.

35:25.520 --> 35:26.520
Singing.

35:26.520 --> 35:27.520
C.

35:27.520 --> 35:28.520
Shot put.

35:28.520 --> 35:30.520
What was the second one?

35:30.520 --> 35:31.520
Singing.

35:31.520 --> 35:32.520
Singing.

35:32.520 --> 35:33.520
Oh.

35:33.520 --> 35:34.520
Science.

35:34.520 --> 35:35.520
B.

35:35.520 --> 35:36.520
Singing.

35:36.520 --> 35:37.520
C.

35:37.520 --> 35:38.520
Shot put.

35:38.520 --> 35:39.520
Waiting.

35:39.520 --> 35:45.520
Who's giving medals to grade squillers?

35:45.520 --> 35:51.520
I just love that he specified several silver medals.

35:51.520 --> 35:52.520
Several.

35:52.520 --> 35:54.520
They kind, that kind of means a gold.

35:54.520 --> 35:55.520
Yep.

35:55.520 --> 36:00.520
That kind of specificity only comes from somebody who is interested in science.

36:00.520 --> 36:01.520
Only.

36:01.520 --> 36:03.520
All right.

36:03.520 --> 36:04.520
Science.

36:04.520 --> 36:05.520
However.

36:05.520 --> 36:06.520
The music helped.

36:06.520 --> 36:11.520
I'd like to point out that the score was erroneously reported as tied earlier.

36:11.520 --> 36:12.520
No, no.

36:12.520 --> 36:13.520
I took it back right away.

36:13.520 --> 36:14.520
I said, no, no, it's not.

36:14.520 --> 36:19.520
You have two and the other and Spence and Rob and Dan have one.

36:19.520 --> 36:21.520
The game's not over yet, man.

36:21.520 --> 36:22.520
You're totally right.

36:22.520 --> 36:23.520
I said it.

36:23.520 --> 36:24.520
I took it back.

36:24.520 --> 36:25.520
Just settle down.

36:25.520 --> 36:27.520
Just clarifying for the podcast.

36:27.520 --> 36:28.520
Don't worry.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.520
It is not tied.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.520
Spencer has two.

36:31.520 --> 36:32.520
Dan has one.

36:32.520 --> 36:33.520
Rob has one.

36:33.520 --> 36:37.520
Now, now Bill seems like the type who can put a shot.

36:37.520 --> 36:38.520
All right.

36:38.520 --> 36:41.520
That's the whole shot putting.

36:41.520 --> 36:42.520
Okay.

36:42.520 --> 36:43.520
All right.

36:43.520 --> 36:45.520
Spencer's answer is shot put.

36:45.520 --> 36:46.520
Dan?

36:46.520 --> 36:52.520
My instinct is to go away from science because it feels obvious because he's a Harmontown

36:52.520 --> 36:55.520
attendee and he makes things.

36:55.520 --> 37:00.520
And so it would be weirder for him to be a good singer or a shot putter.

37:00.520 --> 37:04.520
If you're in grade school, I mean, that doesn't have any bearing on what you become just because

37:04.520 --> 37:06.520
he doesn't look like Jesse Ventura now.

37:06.520 --> 37:11.520
It doesn't mean he wasn't the ace shot putter of his grade school.

37:11.520 --> 37:13.520
I mean, what did it take back then?

37:13.520 --> 37:17.520
You have to shoot a heavy ball further than a bunch of fourth graders.

37:17.520 --> 37:22.520
You could have been good at anything.

37:22.520 --> 37:32.520
The question is, would you think of the word shot put as a comedic third?

37:32.520 --> 37:34.520
And I feel like the answer is yes.

37:34.520 --> 37:37.520
There wasn't a comedy one in there.

37:37.520 --> 37:39.520
There wasn't one with a zing.

37:39.520 --> 37:41.520
That's the zingy one.

37:41.520 --> 37:42.520
No business zingy.

37:42.520 --> 37:44.520
I think that was written by a zinger.

37:44.520 --> 37:46.520
So I'm going to go with singing.

37:46.520 --> 37:47.520
That is correct.

37:47.520 --> 37:48.520
Yeah!

37:48.520 --> 37:52.520
Well done.

37:52.520 --> 37:53.520
The score is now...

37:53.520 --> 37:56.520
This game sucks!

37:56.520 --> 37:59.520
The score is Spencer 2, Dan 2, Rob 1.

37:59.520 --> 38:01.520
Fuck off!

38:01.520 --> 38:03.520
All right.

38:03.520 --> 38:06.520
Spencer will start the answering in this round.

38:06.520 --> 38:07.520
I hate games.

38:07.520 --> 38:10.520
I can't believe you brought me up for the game, man.

38:10.520 --> 38:13.520
After this, we're going to play G&D, so get ready.

38:13.520 --> 38:14.520
That's a different kind.

38:14.520 --> 38:15.520
You can't lose at that.

38:15.520 --> 38:17.520
Oh, you can.

38:17.520 --> 38:22.520
We've been doing it for months.

38:22.520 --> 38:24.520
Question number four.

38:24.520 --> 38:26.520
I always lose.

38:26.520 --> 38:28.520
All right, go ahead.

38:28.520 --> 38:30.520
Bill was in marching band.

38:30.520 --> 38:31.520
Really?

38:31.520 --> 38:34.520
True.

38:34.520 --> 38:35.520
So was I, Bill.

38:35.520 --> 38:38.520
He played one of these three instruments.

38:38.520 --> 38:42.520
Heard strings.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.520
A, drum.

38:44.520 --> 38:46.520
B, oboe.

38:46.520 --> 38:50.520
C, alto sax.

38:50.520 --> 38:52.520
A, drum.

38:52.520 --> 38:54.520
B, oboe.

38:54.520 --> 39:00.520
C, alto sax.

39:00.520 --> 39:02.520
Who's first?

39:02.520 --> 39:03.520
Spencer is first.

39:03.520 --> 39:07.520
I just, yeah, oboe.

39:07.520 --> 39:08.520
What's your reasoning?

39:08.520 --> 39:09.520
Because this is a bad question.

39:09.520 --> 39:10.520
I'm really arbitrary.

39:10.520 --> 39:14.520
I just really wanted to say oboe.

39:14.520 --> 39:15.520
All right, oboe.

39:15.520 --> 39:16.520
It's fun.

39:16.520 --> 39:17.520
I don't think it's arbitrary at all.

39:17.520 --> 39:22.520
I think that Bill is clearly a sax man because he looked at the

39:22.520 --> 39:26.520
marching band as an opportunity to, yeah, it's a sexy instrument.

39:26.520 --> 39:29.520
It's a Bill Clinton instrument.

39:29.520 --> 39:32.520
He wanted to, he saw himself sitting in the window.

39:32.520 --> 39:36.520
He's like, man, I have all this aptitude for science and music,

39:36.520 --> 39:41.520
but I'm never going to be like a motley crew.

39:41.520 --> 39:46.520
I just, I also value the rule of law.

39:46.520 --> 39:48.520
All right.

39:48.520 --> 39:53.520
So what instrument gets pussy without breaking the law?

39:53.520 --> 39:54.520
The answer is sax.

39:54.520 --> 39:55.520
I know, I know, I know.

39:55.520 --> 39:56.520
I know what you're going to say.

39:56.520 --> 39:59.520
Let them all answer, and I'll throw out a fact,

39:59.520 --> 40:02.520
and then they can revise their answer.

40:02.520 --> 40:03.520
Oh, shit.

40:03.520 --> 40:04.520
Please.

40:04.520 --> 40:05.520
I love you.

40:05.520 --> 40:09.520
This is why I didn't want you on the stage.

40:09.520 --> 40:11.520
We'll bring you up for a follow-up.

40:11.520 --> 40:13.520
So if you would like a notepad or something,

40:13.520 --> 40:14.520
so you can remember these.

40:14.520 --> 40:15.520
Okay.

40:15.520 --> 40:16.520
That sounded me.

40:16.520 --> 40:17.520
No, it didn't.

40:17.520 --> 40:18.520
I'm in my head.

40:18.520 --> 40:19.520
Sorry.

40:19.520 --> 40:20.520
Okay.

40:20.520 --> 40:26.520
So you were going with a sax, sexy sax,

40:26.520 --> 40:28.520
which is like making out with somebody.

40:28.520 --> 40:29.520
Yeah.

40:29.520 --> 40:30.520
Yeah.

40:30.520 --> 40:35.520
Especially when you're silhouetted in a window in an 80s set.

40:35.520 --> 40:36.520
Yes.

40:36.520 --> 40:54.520
Dan, would you do that as Rob's thinking music?

40:54.520 --> 40:55.520
He just did.

40:55.520 --> 40:56.520
He just did.

40:56.520 --> 40:57.520
Okay.

40:57.520 --> 40:58.520
He just did.

40:58.520 --> 41:05.520
Bill with 1L, you seem to me as somebody who when you were younger had longer hair.

41:05.520 --> 41:06.520
I need a drummer.

41:06.520 --> 41:07.520
Oh.

41:07.520 --> 41:11.520
That is correct.

41:11.520 --> 41:13.520
Breed it.

41:13.520 --> 41:15.520
Breed it.

41:15.520 --> 41:16.520
Breed it.

41:16.520 --> 41:17.520
You know what?

41:17.520 --> 41:18.520
It didn't occur to me.

41:18.520 --> 41:19.520
Drums are pretty sexy too.

41:19.520 --> 41:22.520
I was just picturing the marching band drum,

41:22.520 --> 41:24.520
the one that's just tethered to your torso

41:24.520 --> 41:26.520
and you're like an energizer bunny.

41:26.520 --> 41:27.520
All right.

41:27.520 --> 41:28.520
Sexy.

41:28.520 --> 41:29.520
But it's marching band.

41:29.520 --> 41:30.520
You played a drum.

41:30.520 --> 41:31.520
Never mind.

41:31.520 --> 41:32.360
for a minute.

41:32.360 --> 41:34.640
No, you were, you were pretty good, right?

41:35.600 --> 41:37.960
Yeah, come on, all right.

41:37.960 --> 41:41.280
He was specifically fifth bass drum.

41:41.280 --> 41:43.400
So I don't know, does that mean fifth chair?

41:43.400 --> 41:44.640
Or is that a specific?

41:44.640 --> 41:45.720
Oh, the biggest bass drum.

41:45.720 --> 41:47.320
The biggest one, Aaron.

41:47.320 --> 41:52.640
All right, question number five.

41:52.640 --> 41:54.600
I was last chair trumpet.

41:54.600 --> 42:00.320
In a three-way with Vince Vaughn.

42:00.320 --> 42:04.080
It's not even a musical term.

42:04.080 --> 42:07.360
It's just before I came here.

42:07.360 --> 42:12.640
All right, this question includes four quotes.

42:12.640 --> 42:15.680
This is a four-option answer.

42:15.680 --> 42:18.960
And we're going to start with Dan in the answering.

42:18.960 --> 42:22.320
A, I've had migraines since I was 16.

42:22.320 --> 42:26.320
B, I've had parakeets since I was 16.

42:26.320 --> 42:29.360
C, I've had arthritis since I was 16.

42:29.360 --> 42:31.760
D, I've had lizards since I was 16.

42:39.760 --> 42:42.560
You're so proud of yourself for creating perfectly equidistant

42:42.560 --> 42:43.440
possibilities.

42:43.440 --> 42:47.160
Yeah, exactly.

42:47.160 --> 42:48.720
Only one of those is true.

42:48.720 --> 42:49.200
Yeah.

42:49.200 --> 42:51.480
Lizards, parakeets, arthritis, or migraines.

42:51.480 --> 42:53.600
Yep, migraines, paracretes.

42:53.600 --> 42:55.760
Did you say this was a lightning round?

42:55.760 --> 42:57.320
No, no, no, no.

42:57.320 --> 42:59.440
We have four choices as opposed to three.

42:59.440 --> 43:02.280
Oh, oh, oh, it's the molasses round.

43:05.080 --> 43:05.720
God damn it.

43:05.720 --> 43:08.840
OK, parakeets, two contained.

43:08.840 --> 43:11.440
He would look at them.

43:11.440 --> 43:15.920
The throbbing heart of a freeman beats Bill's chest.

43:15.920 --> 43:22.280
That's why he works with wood and beef, lizards.

43:22.280 --> 43:23.440
There's the science angle.

43:23.440 --> 43:26.520
Oh, lizards are supposed to be gross, but I'm a scientist.

43:26.520 --> 43:29.960
I value them because I'm scientific.

43:29.960 --> 43:31.520
Migraines and arthritis.

43:31.520 --> 43:37.680
Arthritis, he wouldn't do all that handiwork, migraines.

43:37.680 --> 43:39.040
All right, Rob.

43:39.040 --> 43:42.000
Lizards.

43:42.000 --> 43:46.480
For the same reasons that Dan said.

43:46.480 --> 43:48.240
Spencer?

43:48.240 --> 43:51.360
I don't want to live in a world where Bill had parakeets.

43:59.040 --> 44:02.160
He goes home at night and tells him about how did

44:02.160 --> 44:06.640
Harmontown go tonight, Professor Feathers?

44:06.640 --> 44:08.480
Professor Feathers.

44:08.480 --> 44:10.120
Because he's an expert.

44:10.120 --> 44:10.880
Yeah.

44:10.880 --> 44:15.440
What happened to you in that line, man?

44:15.440 --> 44:19.360
Oh, man, after that line, I went to Roscoe's chicken

44:19.360 --> 44:23.760
and waffles, and I was texting on my cell phone.

44:23.760 --> 44:26.040
And the way I was texting, I don't know,

44:26.040 --> 44:28.960
but it was like it lined up some pathways in my brain,

44:28.960 --> 44:32.840
and I felt like I was a living god for that moment.

44:32.840 --> 44:36.440
Like high on all of the drugs that your brain makes itself.

44:36.440 --> 44:38.680
Like I was just like, ugh.

44:38.680 --> 44:41.880
Like I could just like pass through the walls.

44:41.880 --> 44:42.960
So are you saying lizards?

44:42.960 --> 44:46.640
Shoot laser beams at those ads.

44:46.640 --> 44:48.680
Just because of sleep deprivation?

44:48.680 --> 44:51.160
The combination of that and success,

44:51.160 --> 44:55.440
and I'm sure you know, who knows.

44:55.440 --> 44:57.480
What I'm trying to say is that if Bill actually

44:57.480 --> 44:59.800
did have parakeets, then our relationship

44:59.800 --> 45:01.600
will fundamentally change from here on.

45:05.280 --> 45:07.160
I'm going to pick migraines, because I

45:07.160 --> 45:09.560
feel like I got migraines around that age,

45:09.560 --> 45:12.200
and that seems like something that crops up at 16.

45:12.200 --> 45:13.320
Around Bill's age?

45:13.320 --> 45:15.440
Oh, since 16, he said.

45:15.440 --> 45:16.920
Well, Spencer is correct.

45:16.920 --> 45:17.760
And Dan.

45:17.760 --> 45:18.840
It is, and Dan.

45:18.840 --> 45:20.040
Sorry, Spencer and Dan are correct.

45:20.040 --> 45:22.320
It was migraines, migraines.

45:22.320 --> 45:24.880
The score is Spencer 3, Dan 3, Rob.

45:24.880 --> 45:28.720
We know, we know, we know, we know what the score is.

45:32.160 --> 45:33.640
What's Rob's score?

45:33.640 --> 45:36.240
Shut up, shut up.

45:36.240 --> 45:38.480
Rob is in last place with two.

45:38.480 --> 45:39.400
Oh, shut up.

45:39.400 --> 45:40.840
I was just trying to play it, yeah.

45:40.840 --> 45:43.960
Number six, three quotes.

45:43.960 --> 45:45.280
I have been bungee jumping.

45:45.280 --> 45:47.160
I have been skydiving.

45:47.160 --> 45:49.240
I have not been on an airplane.

45:49.240 --> 45:51.840
A, I have been bungee jumping.

45:51.840 --> 45:53.600
B, I have been skydiving.

45:53.600 --> 45:57.640
C, I have not been on an airplane.

45:57.640 --> 45:59.200
We were going to start with this Rob.

45:59.200 --> 46:02.960
We were going to start with Rob.

46:02.960 --> 46:04.960
Music.

46:04.960 --> 46:08.960
OK.

46:08.960 --> 46:13.280
Oh god, I don't know how to do this.

46:13.280 --> 46:14.560
OK, the music's fucking with me.

46:14.560 --> 46:15.360
OK, get rid of it.

46:19.360 --> 46:21.240
Bungee jumping, skydiving.

46:21.240 --> 46:22.280
Never been on a plane.

46:22.280 --> 46:23.680
Skydiving.

46:23.680 --> 46:25.280
All right, Spencer?

46:25.280 --> 46:27.520
I'm going to pick skydiving.

46:27.520 --> 46:28.400
OK, Dan.

46:28.400 --> 46:30.320
Am I the only one?

46:30.320 --> 46:32.440
If C is correct, then B can't be.

46:32.440 --> 46:37.920
If he was never on a plane, he could, unless you pulled

46:37.920 --> 46:41.800
a bungee cord really tight and flew him into the air,

46:41.800 --> 46:43.280
I don't think he could ever skydive

46:43.280 --> 46:45.760
without having been on a plane, which means that.

46:45.760 --> 46:47.960
B was right, then C couldn't be.

46:47.960 --> 46:50.200
And since B and C have a relationship with each other,

46:50.200 --> 46:53.400
then I'm going to go with A. He's been bungee jumping.

46:53.400 --> 46:56.400
OK, the correct answer is B, skydiving.

46:56.400 --> 46:56.900
Ha!

46:56.900 --> 46:57.900
Yeah!

47:01.380 --> 47:04.340
Spencer's and Lee, Dan, and Rob are tied.

47:04.340 --> 47:06.020
Again!

47:06.020 --> 47:08.020
Question number seven.

47:08.020 --> 47:10.420
This is the ice cream question.

47:10.420 --> 47:12.980
We get ice cream?

47:12.980 --> 47:14.900
All the ice cream you want.

47:14.900 --> 47:17.420
I once won a year's supply of ice cream,

47:17.420 --> 47:24.020
and I always chose bubblegum, because A, it's a dessert

47:24.020 --> 47:29.460
and an activity, B, I actually thought

47:29.460 --> 47:36.460
it was cotton candy flavored, C, I knew my dad wouldn't eat it,

47:36.460 --> 47:38.820
A, it's a dessert and an activity,

47:38.820 --> 47:40.900
B, I actually thought it was cotton candy flavored,

47:40.900 --> 47:44.300
C, I knew my dad wouldn't eat it.

47:44.300 --> 47:54.300
D, I make poor life decisions.

47:54.300 --> 47:56.300
Who's going first?

47:56.300 --> 47:57.300
Who's going this round?

47:57.300 --> 47:58.300
Who starts this round?

47:58.300 --> 48:00.020
Spencer, Spencer, it's you.

48:00.020 --> 48:03.060
I'm going to go with B for whatever reason.

48:03.060 --> 48:05.100
You thought it, he actually thought it was cotton candy

48:05.100 --> 48:05.340
flavored.

48:05.340 --> 48:05.780
Sure.

48:05.780 --> 48:06.780
OK, Dan?

48:06.780 --> 48:09.540
I'll go with C, because of my continuing fixation

48:09.540 --> 48:11.380
on fathers.

48:11.380 --> 48:11.900
All right.

48:11.900 --> 48:14.380
I'm going to go with A, because it is true.

48:14.380 --> 48:19.380
It's a dessert and an activity.

48:19.380 --> 48:24.660
The correct answer is C, I knew my dad wouldn't eat it.

48:24.660 --> 48:28.140
That brings Rob back to last place.

48:28.140 --> 48:32.180
Spencer and Dan tied for first.

48:32.180 --> 48:34.300
All right, here we go.

48:34.300 --> 48:36.780
A, I have a, sorry?

48:36.780 --> 48:40.300
No, I was cursing this game.

48:40.300 --> 48:43.460
A, I have a bunch of magnets on my fridge.

48:43.460 --> 48:46.340
B, I have two sewing kits.

48:46.340 --> 48:51.420
C, I have 455 PEZ dispensers.

48:51.420 --> 48:54.140
A, I have a bunch of magnets on my fridge.

48:54.140 --> 48:56.180
B, I have two sewing kits.

48:56.180 --> 49:00.420
C, I have 455 PEZ dispensers.

49:00.420 --> 49:02.060
We're going to start with Dan.

49:02.060 --> 49:07.220
OK, I keep going to, you asked him to email a bunch of facts

49:07.220 --> 49:08.180
about himself.

49:08.180 --> 49:11.340
So he might have, during a falter, might have gone,

49:11.340 --> 49:13.100
I don't know, I have a bunch of magnets on my fridge.

49:13.100 --> 49:15.020
What else?

49:15.020 --> 49:17.300
Like, maybe.

49:17.300 --> 49:20.740
Because that 455 PEZ dispensers thing,

49:20.740 --> 49:23.260
that seems like a make-up up.

49:23.260 --> 49:26.020
And the, what's the other one?

49:26.020 --> 49:26.820
Two sewing kits.

49:26.820 --> 49:28.580
Two sewing kits.

49:28.580 --> 49:31.780
That's pretty specific.

49:31.780 --> 49:34.060
I'm going to go with sewing kits.

49:34.060 --> 49:35.300
OK, Rob?

49:35.300 --> 49:36.740
I'm also going to go with sewing kits,

49:36.740 --> 49:39.700
but I thought of it before Dan said anything.

49:39.700 --> 49:42.860
Because he works with his hands and stuff.

49:42.860 --> 49:43.860
Yeah.

49:43.860 --> 49:44.820
You did a really good job.

49:48.020 --> 49:48.520
Thank you.

49:48.520 --> 49:51.260
That's all I wanted tonight.

49:51.260 --> 49:53.260
What, I'm going to go with sewing kits,

49:53.260 --> 49:56.540
because that's the lowest stakes for me.

49:56.540 --> 49:58.340
So it doesn't matter what the answer is,

49:58.340 --> 49:59.340
this round is to watch.

49:59.340 --> 50:00.700
How come this is not important to you?

50:00.700 --> 50:01.180
It is.

50:01.180 --> 50:02.940
It's just so important to me.

50:02.940 --> 50:03.860
You don't care.

50:03.860 --> 50:05.180
I'm playing it like a game.

50:05.180 --> 50:06.100
And you're winning.

50:06.100 --> 50:06.660
Yeah, that's why.

50:06.660 --> 50:09.380
The correct answer is, I have a bunch of magnets

50:09.380 --> 50:10.980
on my fridge, is the correct answer.

50:10.980 --> 50:11.740
All right, moving on.

50:11.740 --> 50:12.380
We're almost done.

50:12.380 --> 50:12.880
Stupid.

50:15.660 --> 50:16.660
Second to last question.

50:16.660 --> 50:19.900
I love this game, Erin.

50:19.900 --> 50:20.740
Thanks, Spencer.

50:20.740 --> 50:22.220
Yeah, balanced viewpoints.

50:22.220 --> 50:23.940
Are you starting to rethink your position

50:23.940 --> 50:25.060
on Dungeons and Dragons?

50:25.060 --> 50:28.380
Do you think this is a better game?

50:28.380 --> 50:31.140
I'm definitely considering how the work audience member

50:31.140 --> 50:32.900
trivia into my encounters.

50:32.900 --> 50:33.500
Yeah.

50:33.500 --> 50:39.660
I'm wondering if there could be a whole convention for this.

50:39.660 --> 50:41.100
I'm sure.

50:41.100 --> 50:42.780
All right, question number nine.

50:42.780 --> 50:45.060
I was in the talent show in the fifth grade.

50:45.060 --> 50:51.500
And I sang, A, don't rain on my parade, B,

50:51.500 --> 50:54.900
Dad, don't hit me.

50:54.900 --> 51:01.180
An original piece by B, Fiddler on the Roof,

51:01.180 --> 51:03.580
C, luck be a lady.

51:03.580 --> 51:04.980
That's a good one.

51:04.980 --> 51:07.900
A, don't rain on my parade, B, Fiddler on the Roof,

51:07.900 --> 51:09.980
C, luck be a lady.

51:09.980 --> 51:11.900
What's don't rain on my parade?

51:11.900 --> 51:13.660
I don't know what that is.

51:13.660 --> 51:16.020
Don't tell me not to fight.

51:16.020 --> 51:17.260
It's from Funny Girl.

51:17.260 --> 51:17.980
It's from what?

51:17.980 --> 51:19.500
It's from Funny Girl.

51:19.500 --> 51:20.860
It's a barber's tray sand.

51:20.860 --> 51:22.300
OK, so you put that one in there.

51:22.300 --> 51:22.800
OK.

51:22.800 --> 51:28.800
Yeah.

51:28.800 --> 51:32.120
But all of these songs are very popular songs.

51:36.600 --> 51:39.800
I'm going to live it.

51:39.800 --> 51:41.000
I'm not going to do much of it.

51:41.000 --> 51:44.360
I would like to hear two bars of Fiddler on the Roof, please.

51:44.360 --> 51:45.200
Or thinking music.

51:45.200 --> 51:47.120
Like a Fiddler on the Roof.

51:47.120 --> 51:48.520
I mean, it's not actually a song.

51:48.520 --> 51:49.520
All right.

51:49.520 --> 51:52.280
Well, I will.

51:52.280 --> 51:56.600
May God bless and protect us.

51:56.600 --> 51:57.760
So that's another made-up one.

52:01.760 --> 52:02.760
Who's going?

52:02.760 --> 52:03.520
Oh, sorry.

52:03.520 --> 52:04.040
Rob is starting.

52:04.040 --> 52:05.840
Rob is starting, correct?

52:05.840 --> 52:06.520
Yes, thank you.

52:06.520 --> 52:07.160
Sorry.

52:07.160 --> 52:10.480
It's your game.

52:10.480 --> 52:12.600
Let me say Fiddler on the Roof's a classic.

52:12.600 --> 52:15.640
But luck be a lady is a crowd pleaser.

52:15.640 --> 52:17.400
So I'm going to say luck be a lady.

52:17.400 --> 52:17.760
OK.

52:17.760 --> 52:23.040
That's a drummer's song.

52:23.040 --> 52:25.520
They just did that at the Emmys tonight.

52:25.520 --> 52:26.360
Luck be a lady.

52:26.360 --> 52:27.400
They sure did.

52:27.400 --> 52:28.360
Whoa.

52:28.360 --> 52:29.960
Wow.

52:29.960 --> 52:31.000
How did you know that?

52:31.000 --> 52:35.240
I was on while I was sleeping.

52:35.240 --> 52:38.400
I woke up to Don Cheadle, like doing this weird monologue.

52:38.400 --> 52:39.920
I had a half a fever dream.

52:39.920 --> 52:41.520
Don Cheadle's voice was in my ear

52:41.520 --> 52:44.240
talking about how television is an amazing thing

52:44.240 --> 52:46.680
because Kennedy got his brains blown out.

52:46.680 --> 52:48.840
TV was there for that.

52:48.840 --> 52:50.800
And then a couple weeks later, the Beatles

52:50.800 --> 52:54.000
made it OK to laugh again.

52:54.000 --> 52:54.960
Here's Carrie Underwood.

52:54.960 --> 52:57.440
And I was like, what the fuck is happening?

52:57.440 --> 52:58.720
What are you talking about?

52:58.720 --> 53:01.880
It's just a piece of technology that has enslaved all of us.

53:01.880 --> 53:04.080
There's not a cultural icon.

53:04.080 --> 53:05.600
Ah, television.

53:05.600 --> 53:06.600
Ah, phylo TV.

53:06.600 --> 53:08.880
When Kennedy died, when Beatles like, yeah,

53:08.880 --> 53:11.440
and everything else, what are you talking about?

53:11.440 --> 53:12.680
I was like, ah, oxygen.

53:12.680 --> 53:16.200
Kennedy breathed it for his last breath.

53:16.200 --> 53:20.800
Then the Beatles exhaled it during, yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:20.800 --> 53:22.560
Here's Carrie Underwood.

53:22.560 --> 53:24.120
You went out some more.

53:24.120 --> 53:25.480
Enjoy your TV.

53:25.480 --> 53:26.280
It's not dying.

53:31.280 --> 53:32.760
Grand Theft Who?

53:32.760 --> 53:33.600
Enjoy the Emmys.

53:37.600 --> 53:40.160
It was just weird to wake up to that, that's all.

53:40.160 --> 53:41.640
Don Cheadle's voice in my ear.

53:41.640 --> 53:43.720
Do you know how you make it part of your dream

53:43.720 --> 53:44.760
when you hear stuff?

53:44.760 --> 53:45.320
Absolutely.

53:45.320 --> 53:47.920
So no.

53:47.920 --> 53:48.560
You don't know?

53:48.560 --> 53:49.800
Oh.

53:49.800 --> 53:51.840
Rob's guess is Luck Be a Lady, Spencer?

53:51.840 --> 53:54.000
Yeah, I'm going to go with Luck Be a Lady.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.680
Luck Be a Lady, because there's the thing, Fiddler on the Roof.

53:56.680 --> 53:58.800
I don't even know that that's a song.

53:58.800 --> 53:59.760
That's the correct answer.

53:59.760 --> 54:02.120
It is Fiddler on the Roof.

54:02.120 --> 54:05.680
Maybe it means the entire musical.

54:05.680 --> 54:09.200
All right, final question, final question.

54:09.200 --> 54:10.120
The score.

54:10.120 --> 54:12.520
So we all lose a point?

54:12.520 --> 54:13.720
No, that doesn't help me.

54:13.720 --> 54:15.960
That is it, no, that's that.

54:15.960 --> 54:18.280
It'd be exactly where we are.

54:18.280 --> 54:20.760
This round will determine whether you're worse than us

54:20.760 --> 54:22.080
or just equal.

54:25.560 --> 54:26.400
That's it.

54:26.400 --> 54:28.200
You have no chance of being superior.

54:28.200 --> 54:31.440
Every game I've ever played, go ahead, do it.

54:31.440 --> 54:33.520
That's why you invited me up here, Erin.

54:36.800 --> 54:41.760
All right, this next round is unique to the other rounds.

54:41.760 --> 54:45.520
As we stand, Spencer has four, Dan has four, Rob has three.

54:45.520 --> 54:47.040
Yes, we.

54:47.040 --> 54:52.800
Four, you're unclear at home, four is more than three.

54:52.800 --> 54:57.160
In this last round, there are many different options

54:57.160 --> 54:58.040
for the correct answer.

54:58.040 --> 55:00.800
We'll go around first.

55:00.800 --> 55:04.320
If you choose the correct answer in the first round,

55:04.320 --> 55:08.840
you'll get two points, meaning that anyone who guesses us

55:08.840 --> 55:13.160
correctly wins a round, and then we'll just do that.

55:13.160 --> 55:15.480
OK.

55:15.480 --> 55:18.360
Final round, you'll see.

55:18.360 --> 55:20.120
Final round.

55:20.120 --> 55:23.520
Basically, it's so close whoever guesses this first wins,

55:23.520 --> 55:24.960
and this is going to start with Spencer.

55:24.960 --> 55:26.760
Wait, do we have to chime in?

55:26.760 --> 55:30.120
No, no, no, we'll still do the round robin thing,

55:30.120 --> 55:33.000
and then I'll say the correct answer after the three.

55:33.000 --> 55:33.600
Here we go.

55:33.600 --> 55:35.840
The straight line.

55:35.840 --> 55:36.800
Yeah, sorry.

55:36.800 --> 55:39.600
It's not a round robin at all, that refers to a very specific

55:39.600 --> 55:42.080
thing.

55:42.080 --> 55:44.320
OK.

55:44.320 --> 55:50.240
Until I took up woodwork, I made music in my spare time.

55:50.240 --> 55:54.280
I have an album I released on Amazon.

55:54.280 --> 55:55.160
Wait, are these?

55:55.160 --> 55:56.680
This is a quote, and now I'm going

55:56.680 --> 56:01.080
to list several different names of what Bill's original album

56:01.080 --> 56:02.160
is called.

56:02.160 --> 56:04.480
Amazing, OK, all right.

56:04.480 --> 56:06.760
Here we go.

56:06.760 --> 56:09.760
OK.

56:09.760 --> 56:11.960
I'm really good at making games, you guys.

56:11.960 --> 56:14.000
All right, A. Oh, thanks.

56:14.000 --> 56:14.480
I'm sorry.

56:14.480 --> 56:16.160
I'm sorry, I was supposed to applause.

56:16.160 --> 56:17.000
OK.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.720
A, time on inside.

56:24.560 --> 56:28.320
B, personal records.

56:28.320 --> 56:33.000
C, empty swing set.

56:33.000 --> 56:36.560
D, bloody belt.

56:36.560 --> 56:40.760
In a puddle of Jack Daniels, next to a station wagon,

56:40.760 --> 56:42.680
with my father's monogrammed car keys.

56:45.680 --> 56:47.000
You're describing the album art.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.080
I've already forgot the first one.

56:49.080 --> 56:50.000
OK.

56:50.000 --> 56:51.640
A, time on inside.

56:51.640 --> 56:53.360
B, personal records.

56:53.360 --> 56:55.520
C, empty swing set.

56:55.520 --> 56:59.600
D, mighty will, heart will come.

56:59.600 --> 57:01.400
E, Indiana.

57:01.400 --> 57:05.440
C, dad's car.

57:05.440 --> 57:11.080
Wait, not C. Next one.

57:11.080 --> 57:14.600
Rain, take a bow.

57:14.600 --> 57:16.240
Next one.

57:16.240 --> 57:18.040
Run, walk, run.

57:18.040 --> 57:20.520
Periods after each of those words.

57:20.520 --> 57:22.240
Next one.

57:22.240 --> 57:23.120
Catch a day.

57:26.240 --> 57:29.840
No punctuation.

57:29.840 --> 57:30.800
Next one.

57:30.800 --> 57:34.560
Notes, exclamation point.

57:34.560 --> 57:36.160
Next one.

57:36.160 --> 57:37.000
Live it down.

57:43.000 --> 57:46.640
OK, so those are all the options.

57:49.760 --> 57:51.960
I apologize for the lettering.

57:51.960 --> 57:55.080
One of those is an original album by Bill.

57:55.080 --> 57:56.880
I'll read them again really, really fast.

57:56.880 --> 57:57.800
Time on inside.

57:57.800 --> 57:59.000
Personal records.

57:59.000 --> 57:59.840
Empty swing set.

57:59.840 --> 58:01.040
Mighty will, heart will come.

58:01.040 --> 58:05.560
Indiana, dad's car, rain, comma, take a bow.

58:05.560 --> 58:08.200
Run, walk, run.

58:08.200 --> 58:09.760
Catch the day.

58:09.760 --> 58:14.640
Notes, exclamation point, and live it down.

58:14.640 --> 58:15.640
All right.

58:15.640 --> 58:16.920
Stake's going to be higher.

58:16.920 --> 58:17.720
Is it me?

58:17.720 --> 58:18.280
Is it me?

58:18.280 --> 58:19.520
Yeah.

58:19.520 --> 58:23.280
I got to go with, I mean, the dad issues thing.

58:23.280 --> 58:24.760
Makes me want to think dad's car.

58:24.760 --> 58:27.920
But I got to go with run, walk, run.

58:27.920 --> 58:28.920
Run, walk, run.

58:28.920 --> 58:29.920
I'll go with dad's car.

58:29.920 --> 58:30.760
Run, walk, run.

58:30.760 --> 58:33.200
Dad's car, I got to double down on all my dad stuff.

58:33.200 --> 58:35.680
Dad's car, OK.

58:35.680 --> 58:38.440
I'm going to need you to say I'm all again.

58:38.440 --> 58:40.960
Time on inside, personal records, empty swing set.

58:40.960 --> 58:44.400
You're just mushing them all in the one elbow.

58:48.400 --> 58:50.360
OK, I'll say all, I'll emerald it.

58:50.360 --> 58:52.440
I'll say bam after each of them.

58:52.440 --> 58:54.360
Time on inside, bam.

58:54.360 --> 58:56.120
Personal records, bam.

58:56.120 --> 58:57.840
Empty swing set, bam.

58:57.840 --> 58:59.440
Mighty will, heart will come.

58:59.440 --> 59:01.520
Bam, Indiana, bam.

59:01.520 --> 59:05.000
Dad's car, bam, bam.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.080
Rain, take a bow, bam.

59:07.080 --> 59:08.440
Run, walk, what, what?

59:08.440 --> 59:09.080
Wait, I don't know.

59:09.080 --> 59:11.760
I'm like, Madeleine Conn every time I read it.

59:11.760 --> 59:14.600
Run, walk, run, bam.

59:14.600 --> 59:16.240
Catch the day, bam.

59:16.240 --> 59:18.600
Notes, exclamation point, bam.

59:18.600 --> 59:22.600
Live it down, bam.

59:22.600 --> 59:24.880
Lightning walk, run will come.

59:24.880 --> 59:26.840
What is it?

59:26.840 --> 59:29.120
Run, walk, run.

59:29.120 --> 59:33.040
No, that's not it, it's the other one.

59:33.040 --> 59:34.360
Mighty will, heart will come.

59:34.360 --> 59:35.680
Mighty will, heart will come.

59:35.680 --> 59:36.680
OK.

59:36.680 --> 59:40.200
You all chose made up titles, so we'll do this again.

59:40.200 --> 59:41.240
All right, we'll start with Dan.

59:41.240 --> 59:43.520
And cross off the ones that we chose.

59:43.520 --> 59:44.000
Oh, thank you.

59:44.000 --> 59:45.360
So we don't do it again.

59:48.360 --> 59:49.440
Yeah, because I don't know.

59:49.440 --> 59:50.520
Yeah, I was too busy.

59:50.520 --> 59:52.400
I was Instagramming a picture of you

59:52.400 --> 59:56.800
controlling and it was 9-11 over your shoulder.

59:56.800 --> 59:57.760
Oh, man.

59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.920
Yeah, that's real funny.

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.560
Let's laugh.

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:04.560
You laugh at that.

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.200
Have a good laugh.

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:07.880
OK.

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:08.360
Here we go.

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:10.480
So this will start with Dan.

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:11.480
Here are the albums left.

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.560
Time on inside, bam.

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:15.240
Personal records, bam.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.200
I don't need to say bam.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:16.760
Don't say bam.

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:20.160
Personal records, empty swing set, Indiana.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.960
Rain take a bow, catch the day.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.840
Notes, live it down.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.160
OK, notes catch the day.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.800
Rain take about two pretentious for Belle,

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.080
like two grandiose.

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.880
Personal records.

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.400
All right, Rob.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.840
Empty swing set.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:40.600
Why are you giving me that look?

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.520
My smile?

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:43.360
Yeah.

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.040
Because I like you.

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:48.720
Thank you.

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.440
Spencer?

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.320
I thought it was personal records too,

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.520
but I feel like I'm just copying.

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.120
Do what you're thinking.

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:56.920
I'm going to do it.

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:59.120
So we tie, whatever.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.360
The correct answer is personal records.

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:12.320
Well, if you want to win, that's how you do it.

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.240
Let's give a really, really heartfelt round

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.320
of applause to Belle.

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:19.040
Thank you, Belle.

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:25.400
And I promise that Belle could come up and say,

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.760
come up and if you could.

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:27.840
Let's hear your thoughts, Belle.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:28.840
Let's hear your thoughts.

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:33.800
I'm sorry, I don't really have that many thoughts.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.280
Oh, you don't?

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:34.880
OK.

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.760
I was giving you the floor.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.840
Well, no, I just want to say, Rob, you totally nailed

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:39.840
the long hair thing, man.

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:40.360
See?

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:41.320
Totally nailed it.

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.320
See?

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:43.320
And the thing they wanted.

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:45.560
I have my uses.

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.480
Being in the drum line, I liked Rush.

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:51.160
And didn't get laid.

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:51.660
All right.

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:52.160
All right, great.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:52.960
Beef steak bill.

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:53.800
Beef steak bill.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:56.120
Now he's beef steak bill, everybody.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.440
He's earned a higher title.

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.920
Now he's just beef bill.

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.920
Yeah, he said in his email that he

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:06.440
resented the beef fungus bill nickname.

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:08.440
Well, I think Belle knew that.

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:11.400
Yeah, he's never been coy about not liking being

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:15.880
called beef fungus bill, nor do we care.

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:18.640
I got to say, getting a nickname.

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:23.520
I'm sure the Hamburglar wants to be called Senator.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.320
But you know what?

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:25.760
Motherfucker stole a burger.

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:33.000
Ain't no frat guy.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.960
These are dance five minutes for a night at the Apollo.

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:41.200
It's Senator Rob Straub, all right.

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.600
I was going to say Strom Thurmond.

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:43.920
That was the senator in my head.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.840
Who's probably still alive, Strom Thurmond.

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.800
No, he's finally got it.

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:57.400
But if you would like to have 45 minutes of Harmontown

01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:00.720
dedicated to you, simply send a self-addressed stamped

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:05.040
envelope to Nowhere, and then come to the show every day,

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:08.440
every week for like a year.

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.400
I'm just saying, it was a good segment.

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:14.920
And some people might be wondering, who's Bill?

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:16.120
He comes all the time.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:19.840
I've been wondering something for a very long time.

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.880
And now that I'm in the Comptroller seat,

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:23.520
I feel like I can explore it.

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.720
You see the first and second row all the time.

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.120
I'm so curious, who's in the back?

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.840
Can we talk to somebody in the back for a moment?

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:34.960
Those are the people that are just standard customers.

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:37.720
Often the answer is nobody, because they come to the first

01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:41.160
half of the show, and they go, fuck this.

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:44.600
All right, sorry, guys.

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:48.920
Well, is there anybody that's usually in the back?

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:49.920
Oh, does it?

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.600
Oh, yeah.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.000
Come on down.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Are you?

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.520
Someone sadly said there's.

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:56.320
Oh, there's BJ.

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:56.800
OK.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.240
I thought I saw some cat ears.

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:00.920
All right, here comes Back Lady.

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.360
Back Lady.

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.760
Here, come on up.

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:07.520
Back be a lady tonight.

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.960
I'm also one of the interns, but I

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:12.520
was a regular for Harmontown before I became an intern,

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:13.840
so I lurk in the back.

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:15.840
Yes, and we've met before, but what was your name again?

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:16.400
Kelly.

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.640
Kelly, Kelly everybody.

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.520
OK.

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.880
So what's it like back there?

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:26.960
It's dark, and it's hard, because when people stand,

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.960
because we have to sit at the concession stand.

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:31.840
So sometimes when people stand in that general area,

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:34.240
all of a sudden it's like, OK, can't see the stage.

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:37.640
So you get the actual podcast feeling,

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.120
because all you can do is listen to it.

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:41.600
But then when something crazy visually happens,

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:45.000
and it's like, OK, now I know how the listeners feel.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.920
I can't see anything.

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:49.120
You have to go to the hashtag on Instagram.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:51.200
Yeah, that's what I do.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.560
When did you just move to LA?

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:57.640
Actually, October 9th will be my one-year anniversary.

01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:59.520
So sort of.

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.800
Are your dreams coming true?

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:04.920
You're an intern, a nerdist at Meltdown.

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:07.320
That's pretty much it.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.080
But I mean, I don't know.

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:13.200
I didn't think that a year living here, I'd be unemployed.

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.680
But hooray, I'm in LA.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.160
You thought you'd be.

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.800
I thought I'd just be employed somewhere.

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:19.720
It's like an assistant.

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:21.440
What is your dream?

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:22.880
I want to write for TV.

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:23.880
Mm-hmm.

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:24.880
That's a good one.

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:25.880
That's awesome.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:26.880
Yeah.

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:30.640
So preferably TV comedies, so.

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:31.140
Cool.

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:32.400
The Emmys were tonight.

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:32.880
I know.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.920
We were actually just talking about them,

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:38.000
because we were looking on the CNN,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.200
because it popped up that Breaking Bad One for Best Drama,

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:46.520
if nobody was paying attention, hooray.

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:47.640
And then, but like, there we go.

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.960
I hear it's good.

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:50.760
I'm going to check that out.

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.600
No, I watch it.

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:54.400
It's phenomenal.

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.640
And then Modern Family won for Best Comedy, but.

01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:57.760
Oh, there you go.

01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.320
There you go.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.800
Like usual.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:02.760
But apparently, there's a lot of upsets this year,

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.440
like who won best actors and stuff.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:07.080
That's what I heard, like nobody's swept.

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.000
Nobody swept.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.040
Like Breaking Bad One for Best Drama,

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:13.320
but Anna Gunn was the only one who won any actor awards

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:14.640
for Breaking Bad.

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:16.720
And then Modern Family, they won for Best Comedy,

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:19.680
but none of their actors won for Best Comedy.

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:21.520
So it's a really strange.

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:23.160
I just thought we were at the drawing room,

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:24.480
and we were talking about the Emmys,

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:26.320
and I was like, you know, they bothered

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.520
to do this arbitrary separation.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:31.200
This is that sound of the show's air getting let out

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.920
in the background.

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:35.800
They bothered to do this arbitrary separation

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.880
between comedy and drama, and so everything's bisected,

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.360
especially nowadays, where it's like, okay.

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:44.280
And Erin pointed out that she was watching Nurse Jackie,

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:46.760
and I was sleeping in bed, and I woke up.

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:48.400
Apparently, I'm an asshole in my sleep.

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:51.760
I just woke up half asleep and went, hilarious.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.320
It's a hilarious show.

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:55.200
They should nominate it for Best Comedy,

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:58.480
and like in my sleep, it's just still better.

01:06:58.480 --> 01:06:59.760
Still an asshole.

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:04.320
Anyways, but these divisions between drama and comedy exist,

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:07.280
but what doesn't exist is a division between, say,

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:09.440
the schedule, like the idea that, oh,

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:12.240
is this a show that owed 25 episodes a year,

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:15.000
or is this a show that had to do 10 episodes

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.360
every two years?

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:17.680
But then I stopped myself, and I was like,

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:18.680
wait, what am I talking about?

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:19.520
This is perfect.

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.360
The Emmys are actually the place

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:21.640
where it all comes out in the wash,

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:25.080
because if you make 13 episodes a year,

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:29.000
and you therefore get to make good television

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.720
instead of focusing on revenue,

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:34.760
then you have a better shot at an Emmy,

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.920
and that's actually justice, I think.

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:40.240
So I'm telling a story about how I had a thought,

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.040
and then it canceled itself out.

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:44.840
Whoa, whoa, my friends and I have actually

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:47.040
been talking about it and saying that, really,

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:50.360
there should be a division between network and cable,

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:52.240
because cable often, they have a bigger budget,

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.520
and they have the ability to do way more

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:56.040
just being on cable. They used to have that division,

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:59.280
but that threatened both the existence of cable and networks.

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:02.400
Like they used to just, there was the Emmys,

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.960
and then there was the Cable Ace Awards.

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:07.120
They were like, you little darlin' cable shows,

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:09.600
here's a little Ace Award for you.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.680
And at a certain point, the Emmys are like,

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.680
what are we gonna do?

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.280
Just stand here while Rome is burning?

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:15.600
Are we gonna keep having the Emmys?

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:17.240
Are we gonna invite HBO into this

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:18.960
so we can give all the awards to them?

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:23.960
Well, I mean, the interesting thing is that television

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:27.680
is still an art form, it's still a medium.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.800
I think that's what Don Sheetal was trying to say

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:31.760
when I was waking up.

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:34.400
I think his point was that, isn't it funny

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:35.840
that throughout all of this,

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:38.720
all of the weird permutations that cinema is going through,

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:41.280
and music and stuff, that television,

01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:43.640
it is still a thing called television,

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:46.000
and it does carry a certain cultural weight,

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.040
and movies are getting shittier and shittier.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.360
Ooh, insidious.

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:54.720
Uh, and TV continues to get like,

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.960
as we start to mash it into,

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.440
I guess that's sort of like print

01:08:58.440 --> 01:08:59.920
is probably the biggest analogy,

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:04.560
because after you mashed time and life magazine

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.880
into a thousand cat fancies,

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:09.120
that's when magazines started to get good.

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.760
Like, oh shit, there's a ninja magazine?

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:13.320
Like, that's Breaking Bad.

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:14.960
It's like the more surface area.

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:17.120
Breaking Bad's a ninja magazine?

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.880
I will never make myself clear to these people.

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:22.480
Anyways, whatever, I can talk.

01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:24.600
You know what, this podcast should be called

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:30.600
I Go To Bed And Mumble Things Until I Fall Asleep.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:34.600
What are you plugging, Kelly?

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.240
Chips?

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:36.720
No.

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:37.600
Soda?

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.520
I mean, if you want to buy everything,

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:42.120
either it's a dollar for sodas.

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:44.200
All right, all right, everything, everything's a dollar.

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:45.040
Kelly, you don't have to do that.

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.000
You don't have to do that.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.160
And if anybody has any jobs, call me.

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:52.520
All right, Kelly everybody, call her.

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.520
So being here, thank you very much.

01:09:54.520 --> 01:10:01.320
Yeah, yeah, very happy about that.

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.000
She wants to work at TV comedy.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.400
We'll see if maybe she'll meet somebody.

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:08.280
Kelly just whispered to me that Merritt Weaver

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:09.640
won for supporting actress.

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:11.360
She's amazing on Nurse Jackie.

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.440
She's really great, yeah.

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:18.400
This year was weird because the categories were so loaded

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:19.840
with amazing actors.

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:22.120
And some people are saying some really mean,

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:23.760
bullying things about the people who won.

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:26.160
For example, yeah, what was that mean?

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:28.200
In the best actor category, everyone

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:31.920
thought that Brian Cranston was going to be a shoo-in.

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:36.440
But then Bob Kevally, am I saying that right?

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:37.760
No, Bobby Connolly.

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:43.240
Bobby Connolly from Boardwalk Empire won against John Ham

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:46.880
and all the guys from Breaking Bad and also

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:51.960
with the best supporting actress or best supporting

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:55.600
actor, Tony Hale, who's great?

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:57.040
I don't know, I'm sorry.

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:59.160
So people are just saying shitty things about.

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:01.120
Well, they're saying that like the.

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:03.520
During the show, like the next person comes up.

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.520
What the fuck was that?

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:11.560
Bob Newhart comes up and just goes, pfft.

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:12.560
No, no, on Twitter.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:16.560
Oh, Brian Cranston, you should have got that award, man.

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.520
You should have got that.

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.840
Oh, shit, it's like this.

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:19.680
No respect.

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:21.080
Oh, man, it's this guy.

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:26.000
It's everybody's buddy from the neighborhood.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.720
Who were the Emmys when Amerigo Fasbucci, what's

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:30.800
her name, Ugly Buddy, won?

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:32.400
America Ferrera.

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:36.960
Amerigo Fasbucci.

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.360
Rob, you do a really good Amerigo Fasbucci impression.

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:42.640
Oh, man, what's going on here?

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:44.880
But you should have got that award.

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:48.320
It should have been Brian Cranston, man.

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:52.520
American Espuchy.

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:55.680
Hey, Amerigo Fasbucci, what's up?

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:58.960
Yeah, man, that's being a question.

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:01.440
I know it says market price for the fish of the day.

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:02.720
I don't know.

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:05.800
Oh, yeah, that's how it usually is every Friday.

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:09.240
But you know, you come in here, I'll give you 2% off

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.200
and some lemon wedges.

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:13.320
All right.

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:16.680
Amerigo, what do you think about gas prices?

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:19.400
Oh, they're through the roof.

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:20.240
Do you drive out?

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:21.240
What kind of car do you drive?

01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:22.240
Do you drive a car?

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:25.000
Oh, I got a Volt.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.080
I just plug it in.

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.560
I don't even use gas.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:32.000
I haven't used gas since October.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.720
Is that when you got your electric car?

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:36.200
No.

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:38.080
I mean, you walked in a lot, too.

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:39.960
So you walked around and then you got an electric car?

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:42.360
Yeah, I walked to the car dealership.

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:43.640
Amerigo.

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:49.000
Yes, Aaron McGath, I'm losing the accent.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.560
Oh, no.

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:54.160
Well, what's left of the character?

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.400
Keep going, keep going.

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.840
I heard that you and your girlfriend recently had a baby.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.440
What's the baby's name?

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.720
Volt.

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:02.200
All right.

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:04.520
Obviously, there's some money-changing hands here.

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:06.440
Right.

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:09.520
No, America Ferrari, what's her name?

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.840
America Ferrera.

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:11.440
OK.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:14.880
She won for Ugly Betty, remember, this year?

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:18.160
The year I'm talking about, remember, a couple years ago?

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:19.600
Is that Ugly Betty?

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.520
Sure, I don't remember what year, but yeah.

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:25.640
Or maybe it was the Golden Globes, but I remember watching TV

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:28.880
and they were doing that thing where there's a person in the wings

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:33.600
like jumping on you like a harpy as you walk up the stage

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:39.360
and this poor girl who was on the show called Ugly Betty.

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:42.800
She walked off stage after winning her award

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:48.120
and this woman, this wave from some entertainment show,

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:52.120
pounces on her and goes, so, America Ferrera,

01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:54.200
how does it feel to win your first blah, blah, blah?

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:55.440
And she's like, oh, it feels great.

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:56.760
I'm just so glad.

01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:58.400
It hasn't sunk in or anything.

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.600
So what do you have to say to all those people out there

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:03.240
that said America Ferrera is not attractive enough

01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:05.120
to be a leading lady?

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:09.400
I just stuck a mic in her face and she was like, uh, what?

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:10.400
Commercial.

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.920
You know, the show's just called Ugly Betty.

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:20.040
That doesn't mean you get to kick me in the face.

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.040
I'm a human being.

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:25.800
Yeah, all right, anyways, television.

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:27.040
It's still out there.

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.280
Still doing its thing.

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:32.160
From Kennedy's assassination to the Beatles

01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:35.480
and everything in between those seven months,

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:37.840
Don Cheadle will be there.

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:40.280
What was, this was so weird.

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:43.760
Like at the Grammys, there's always this weird moment

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:45.320
where a guy comes out and yells at you

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:48.040
for downloading music and then recedes back

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:51.160
into the rafters, starts playing his pipe organ again.

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:56.280
Fun fact, Dan and I went to the last week

01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:58.600
we were at the Creative Arts Emmys

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:01.240
and Dan was presenting so he was backstage.

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:02.080
How was that?

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:04.000
Is there, what was that?

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:04.840
What'd you do?

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:05.680
What was your bit?

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.760
See, our bit was, me and Joel McHale went out

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:09.880
and our bit was that,

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:13.200
How'd they introduce you first?

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:14.120
It was just the top of the show.

01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:17.040
Creative Arts Emmys has to run like a bobsled

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:21.480
because it's 72 awards and they,

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:24.720
it's so weird because it's like,

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.040
okay, it's the Creative Arts Emmys.

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:28.320
So we understand, don't, you know,

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:29.760
we're not, you're not gonna show us

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:31.560
during the prime time broadcast.

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.040
So you would think that that would mean then,

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:35.760
okay, I won an award for hairdressing.

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:39.280
I should be able to chew the scenery a little bit

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.120
and go like, hold my very real Emmy and go like, okay.

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:45.320
Like, you know what, I've been putting my fingers

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:47.840
through gross people's hair for 30 years

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:49.760
and I finally got a fucking Emmy for it.

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:52.160
I thank you Jesus Christ for giving me the power

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:53.760
to do hair at six in the morning.

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:56.600
Thank you for, thank you to my mother who told me

01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:00.360
that doing hair wasn't, whatever, blah, blah, blah.

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:03.560
They give them like 14 seconds to get through this stuff

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:06.920
because there's so many awards and they tell them

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:10.840
the time you take getting to the stage comes off your time.

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:15.840
So people who like are winning for like best belt making

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:20.920
are like running sprint to the extent

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:24.840
that they love their children and wanna thank them more.

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:27.520
They have to run like the longer they've been

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:30.840
in the business, the more people they have to thank,

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:34.120
the more they have to fucking truck it up there.

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:38.120
And the faster this weird techno music starts playing,

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.160
that when they play them off,

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:41.040
I noticed the Emmys tonight, the real Emmys,

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:45.000
they're actually, they've created a very delicate playoff.

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:48.960
Claire Daines was accepting and it was like sort of like,

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:51.400
I guess live orchestra probably they know what they're doing.

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.080
They start vamping a little bit.

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.640
That's the creative arts Emmys.

01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:57.480
It's like some woman going up there and going,

01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:01.720
my husband died while I was doing John Teetle's wardrobe

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:04.160
and I told him I'd be home by five.

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:06.200
I was home by five the next morning.

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:08.840
And I also just,

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:16.760
including people accepting an award

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:21.000
for a television program about kids with AIDS.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.360
And I was in the audience and these people won this award

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:27.360
and they're like, you know, this award is,

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:28.440
it's not about us.

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.560
It's about like bringing attention to this issue.

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:33.880
There are kids across the country who are suffering

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:38.880
from this disease and I, they're dying and I just appreciate.

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:40.840
At a certain point, like they were screaming.

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.640
Thank you kids, thank you AIDS, goodnight.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:45.960
Yeah.

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:47.800
But I was gonna say the coolest thing,

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:50.320
like I mean that was a weird experience.

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.880
I was sitting out in the audience alone, like in the,

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:54.200
like towards the front,

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:57.720
I got to watch one of my childhood heroes,

01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:59.920
Scott Bacula from Quantum Leap.

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:02.360
Yeah. Yeah.

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:04.600
And God Morgan Freeman,

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:08.120
watch Dan present this award.

01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:09.400
Like I don't even know what Dan looked like

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:10.400
while he was presenting the award.

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:11.240
Cause I was just like,

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:13.440
Scott Bacula.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:14.280
Were they saying anything?

01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:16.680
Or is it like, they're like, oh, he's, he's really.

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:20.440
Oh, what is that young man doing up there?

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:26.120
Okay, Scott, Scott Bacula and, and Morgan Freeman.

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:27.640
They were hanging out together?

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:29.280
With, they were sitting right next to each other.

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.160
But, but you two, Scott Bacula,

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:33.440
you want to go to the shmimmies with me?

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.160
Oh, you're driving out.

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.920
They, they sound exactly the same.

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:39.240
And that's how it happened.

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:40.480
Yeah.

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:42.320
And also, sorry.

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:43.320
I've cleared my throat.

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:45.160
So please continue.

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:46.000
Go ahead, go ahead.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.600
I'm sorry.

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:48.480
Lost my train of thought.

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.520
But before, well, before the MAs

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:51.880
when Dan was backstage,

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:53.320
so a producer comes out and says,

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:56.400
okay, we need to get some shots of the audience.

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:59.080
We need to see you guys smiling and clapping.

01:18:59.080 --> 01:18:59.920
You know, when they,

01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:00.760
when they go to the audience,

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:02.760
when like you're really happy because

01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:05.880
and a gun won or sad because you won or whatever.

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:09.080
We, we had to do these like laughing and whatever things.

01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:10.440
And I was really not into it.

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:13.320
And then I look over at Scott Bacula and Morgan Freeman

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:15.320
super into it.

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:17.640
Guys, look like something really funny happened.

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:18.520
Morgan Freeman,

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:22.880
ah, like just like growing his head back.

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.160
Camera right in his face.

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.960
Him and Scott Bacula, like they, they do it.

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:27.960
They really know how to do it.

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:29.680
I have to imagine that they're either doing a bit.

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:31.480
They're doing it ironically and having fun

01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:33.320
because they know they're going to be front and center

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:37.920
or be and or because in the past they haven't done it

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:40.960
and it's like blown back on them in some weird way.

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:42.120
What's up with Morgan Freeman?

01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:43.680
What's his problem with AIDS?

01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:45.400
You get a Tommy Lee Jones.

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.240
Tommy Lee Jones famously at the Oscars.

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.480
Grumpy face, Tommy Lee Jones.

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.800
Like no one wants to be Tommy Lee Jones.

01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:51.640
That's one of those.

01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:52.480
I do.

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:53.480
Speaking of Tommy Lee Jones.

01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:55.440
Holy shit, Batman forever.

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:58.080
It's like watching your dad come down during a sleepover

01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:00.280
and like try to play cards with your friends.

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:03.120
Dad.

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:05.600
No, we don't want to play cards.

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:06.640
We're talking about boys.

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:09.200
Ah, it's horrible.

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:12.440
I don't want to pimp anybody to do impressions, but I,

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:13.600
but especially not me.

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:16.560
But the hardest I ever laughed in my entire life

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:19.120
was when we were in Milwaukee and just driving,

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:22.560
the snow was on the road and I was just driving with Schrab

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:25.240
and he was just, he was just being two-faced

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:27.320
and I was just asking him questions.

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.640
Be going like this, man.

01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:33.240
He's just mad about the, hey, two-faced.

01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:34.440
Yes.

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:35.400
Hey.

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:38.040
This is going to sound a lot like my other impression.

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:41.040
It's not really, it's more of a character.

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:42.360
What do you want to know?

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:43.800
Two-faced.

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:45.840
Thanks for the ride, by the way.

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:46.560
For the homeless,

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:48.440
and there are rabbits holding a side of his face

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:50.160
and trying to.

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:51.000
What, what?

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:53.760
Half.

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:55.800
Half of my face holding.

01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:57.440
What do you, what do you like in your coffee?

01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:58.280
Do you like?

01:20:58.280 --> 01:20:59.120
Half and half.

01:20:59.120 --> 01:20:59.960
Yeah, yeah.

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:02.800
Two-faced.

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:03.640
Wow, you're so villainous.

01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:06.600
I only, I only like to say like two things.

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:09.200
Two-faced, everyone has to bring something to this,

01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:13.760
this potluck picnic, a dance bringing, casserole,

01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:14.720
I'm bringing, soda.

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:15.560
What are you going to bring?

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:16.960
Two cupcakes.

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:20.360
Of the same flavor?

01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:22.560
Yes.

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:23.400
A part.

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:26.920
He was doing it for, for an hour.

01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:29.040
We were driving around and then at the end of it,

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:31.680
I said, what's your favorite movie?

01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:32.520
Predator 2.

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:33.360
Predator 2.

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:34.200
Predator 2.

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:36.160
Predator 2.

01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:39.960
I could have said Critters.

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:40.800
Predator 2.

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:44.440
He loves Predator 2.

01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:48.600
I saw that they show the thing,

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.240
they show the quad video.

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:51.880
I don't like Face Off though.

01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:54.040
No, no, no, God no.

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:54.880
Oh, terrible.

01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:56.480
Oh, I got really angry.

01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:57.800
Yeah, it, it, it.

01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:00.280
Now they only took off half the face.

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:01.600
It's like Catcher in the Rye.

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:03.600
All right, we should, we're gonna play Dungeons and Dragons.

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:05.120
We only have so much time here, folks.

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:05.960
Yes.

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:07.320
Come on, for God's sake.

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:08.720
Oh, oh, now you're, what,

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:10.960
what are you sitting over there hoping we won't play?

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:13.400
I'm sorry, did you notice how hilarious

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:14.800
that whole thing was?

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:17.840
It was hilarious.

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:20.000
What, are you saying it was not hilarious?

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:20.840
What?

01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:22.840
He just, he gets so high before the show.

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:24.320
That's it, that's all.

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:25.640
All the questions you have on the Spencer,

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:26.480
that's all, that's the only answer.

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:27.560
That's libel.

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:31.200
That's libel to be true.

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:34.880
I think libel can be true.

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:37.880
Yeah.

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:39.320
All right, so, so Rob,

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:41.880
you are gonna play Jeff's character.

01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:42.920
Sure.

01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:44.760
Okay, and why don't, why don't we have

01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:47.360
a beefsteak bill play Kumail?

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:51.520
Right, as a reward for hanging out.

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:53.160
All right, here we go.

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:54.960
And here comes the music.

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:59.960
Last time on Harmon Town,

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:03.120
our heroes were exploring the Great Hall

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:05.920
of Admiral Darkstar's Black Keep.

01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:09.120
There they encountered a paladin

01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:13.160
by the name of Callis the Magnificent.

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:15.720
I feel like I'm really fighting this music.

01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:17.120
Oh, sorry.

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:18.520
It's cool.

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:20.400
Callis the Magnificent,

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:22.440
they bullied him into killing himself

01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:25.280
in a room full of evil darkness.

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:26.120
Bullied?

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:28.840
Yeah, yeah, I'd say that's a pretty fair description.

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:30.840
No, no, we'll discuss that in a moment.

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:35.040
Then they started going up a staircase.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:36.840
That's all.

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:39.680
Okay, so let's, can we do a little meta talk

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:41.680
about that character and his attitude?

01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:42.800
Yeah.

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:44.720
So we bullied him?

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:46.880
Yeah, I mean, I think that's fair.

01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:51.000
He was obstinate, he was assholish.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.840
He came into your dungeon after fighting

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:56.360
like two rooms full of tricky demons

01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:57.920
that tried to mess with his mind

01:23:57.920 --> 01:23:59.640
and he thought you were tricky demons.

01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:02.520
So he came in, you know, full cocked.

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:05.440
And we told him that we weren't tricky.

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:06.720
And he was like, prove it.

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:08.160
And then you were like, blah, blah, blah.

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:10.040
And he was like, you guys got fucking skeletons.

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:10.880
That's evil.

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:12.360
And you were like, ah, I'm mad at you.

01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:14.600
And he's like, oh, maybe you're right.

01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:16.200
And then he felt kind of foolish.

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:19.160
And then he was like, oh, so Shane killed him, really?

01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:22.280
No, well, then that would have killed him.

01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:25.320
But then you guys started really, really firing back at him.

01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:26.920
You know, like, oh, yeah, now you guys

01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:28.240
feel bad about yourself.

01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:31.200
And he's like, oh, I'm going to go in this room.

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:33.720
And then he got killed.

01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:38.440
All right, so I guess that's technically bullying him.

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:39.600
Yeah, I mean, whatever.

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:44.480
I don't feel bad.

01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:46.760
You don't have to.

01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:48.760
I feel great.

01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:51.720
Some guy came in the room and whatever.

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:53.080
I don't feel bad either, because he just

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:54.280
sort of charged off into there.

01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:56.400
He just, we were like, what about this room?

01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:57.360
He just like charged off.

01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:57.920
He was a dick.

01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:59.840
And at one point, I kneeled in front of him

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:03.160
and offered to let him cut my head off.

01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:05.840
If he, I was forthcoming.

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.040
You're being a dick about that.

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:08.960
That's passive aggressive.

01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:09.920
Passive aggressive.

01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:12.760
Come on, come on, hit off.

01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:15.160
Do it, do it.

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:17.960
No.

01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:19.000
I mean, all right.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.400
You've done that to me before.

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:25.000
So we went up a staircase.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:25.520
Here we are.

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:26.360
You still are.

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:27.360
A staircase?

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:35.600
The October.

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:40.120
All this October at the Holiday mattress store.

01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:42.800
I examined my staircase surroundings.

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:44.800
It's a long staircase.

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:47.520
It kind of winds around in a circle.

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.400
I guess more of a stairwell.

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:51.400
What order are we on the staircase?

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:52.680
You know, whatever.

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:53.880
No.

01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:55.760
So right now, Rob, it's like when we play at home.

01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:56.880
Like, we're just interacting.

01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:58.360
What?

01:25:58.360 --> 01:25:59.520
I think we're in a line.

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:02.280
Yeah, I know we're in a line, but we're not in a fight.

01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:04.120
And who's like in the middle?

01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:04.920
Who's in the back?

01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:07.440
That's up to you guys.

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:07.960
That's half the line.

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:08.640
I got an idea.

01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:10.600
Let's have him be in the front.

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:11.440
I got to look at it.

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:12.560
I'll be in the front.

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:13.120
I'm in the front.

01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:14.200
Then we can be second.

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:15.000
All right.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:15.800
That happens.

01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:18.120
I start running up the staircase.

01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:21.280
As you run up the stairs, you feel the temperature increasing.

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:22.200
It's getting hotter.

01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:24.800
This is the Arctic area, but it's hot.

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:25.720
It's crazy.

01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:27.040
Guys, this is weird.

01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:28.040
It is weird.

01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:29.040
It's weird for here.

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:30.600
Stop running up the stairs.

01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:31.880
You're breaking a sweat.

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:38.920
I feel the walls and see if the walls are warm.

01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:41.640
The walls themselves aren't particularly warm.

01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:43.840
It's just the air somehow.

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:45.880
As you are going up these stairs,

01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:48.320
you see a large orange metal door.

01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:52.640
It's like a safe door with a big kind of spinny handle thing.

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:53.960
I touched the door.

01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:55.800
It's warm.

01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:59.160
There's hot stuff on the other side.

01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:01.360
Look under the crack.

01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:02.960
I look under Rob's crack.

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:04.480
No.

01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:06.000
No, the crack of the door.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.280
The twix, the door.

01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:08.320
It's like a safe door.

01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:09.160
There's no crack.

01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:10.000
Yeah, that's what happens.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000
You didn't check, did you?

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:11.880
I look under the crack.

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:12.720
There is a one like you.

01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:16.320
OK, all right, now we know.

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.680
It could be an above crack.

01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:19.920
You didn't check that either.

01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:21.880
OK, people, stand down.

01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:23.240
We got a hot door here.

01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:25.720
This is a hot door.

01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:26.880
It's a safe type door.

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:29.000
There seems to be hot elements on the other side.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.960
At this point in time, I am a mage.

01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:34.400
I will cast resist elements on most of you.

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:36.560
If you want resist elements cast upon you,

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:37.840
please come to the front.

01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:41.200
If you are a skeleton or an assistant to a skeleton,

01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:44.880
please remain behind the living.

01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:47.400
I repeat, you will not have resist elements cast upon you.

01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:49.440
If you are a skeleton, if you are a skeleton,

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:51.360
you already resist elements.

01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:52.160
You are dead.

01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:59.760
I cast resist elements on people.

01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:02.360
I think that only works on the one person.

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:05.600
Do it on me.

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:07.160
Cast elements.

01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:10.000
I say that I'll save it for a rainy day,

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.240
and then I do it under the breath resist elements

01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:13.200
casting on myself.

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:19.480
That happens.

01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:21.440
It's not noticeable.

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:22.920
All right.

01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:23.560
What are you?

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:25.400
Are you a thief or a rogue?

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:28.120
I'm a quark, barbarian.

01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:29.080
I'm a barbarian.

01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:31.000
I'm a half elf.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.120
I put on my flaming armor.

01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:33.600
OK.

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:34.080
Hello.

01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:40.600
And I go up to the door, and I try to open the door.

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:42.000
Wait, wait, wait.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:42.600
I stop.

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:45.040
I stop you.

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:45.960
How are you stopping me?

01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:51.080
Well, it's like by putting two hands on my flaming armor.

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:52.280
On your shoulders, yeah.

01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:53.240
OK, OK.

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:56.400
It's romantic for a second, unless it burns me.

01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:57.000
OK.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.760
I turned down my flames.

01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:01.080
I resist your elements.

01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:05.400
Oh, OK.

01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:06.960
OK, so here we go.

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:10.560
Am I standing in the between them?

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:11.560
Only if you want to be.

01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:13.600
Step around and do trap sense on the door.

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:14.480
That's up to you guys.

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:15.640
So you put your hands on my shoulder.

01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:17.240
I want Christopher to check out the door.

01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:18.120
He's a rogue.

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:19.480
That's what I'm saying.

01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:22.080
When you come to a door, he's just let me sit on the door.

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:22.840
Yeah, sure.

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:23.840
Certain protocol here.

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:25.400
Are you trying to protect me?

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:28.400
Yes.

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:29.800
Yes, yes.

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:31.560
The way I try to protect you when I say,

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:34.600
did you turn the gas off when we go to bed?

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:36.200
I'm trying to protect the whole house.

01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:41.920
Love.

01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:43.800
What's happening?

01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:44.720
Crap sense.

01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:46.360
Christopher wants to check out the door.

01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:48.240
Trap sense, is that what I heard?

01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:48.560
Yeah.

01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:49.400
OK.

01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:51.280
So you examine this door.

01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:57.800
It looks on closer inspection to be made of adamantium.

01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:58.440
Oh.

01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:00.480
Oh, wait, no, that's OK.

01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:01.640
All right.

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:04.440
It's a very strong and a hard metal,

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:07.440
for those of you not in the know.

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:10.120
It's what Wolverine's made out of.

01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:11.000
Not that you can tell.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.480
Yeah, the skeleton.

01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:18.920
It's one electron different from unobtainium.

01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:25.360
That's the door.

01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:25.880
All right.

01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:28.680
So it's made out of adamantium, but there's no traps

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:29.720
that you can sense?

01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:31.200
I don't see anything.

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:33.600
So it's like a vault door, like it's got a crank on it?

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:34.120
Yeah.

01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:35.280
Yeah, let's open this thing.

01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:35.960
Come on.

01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:37.680
All right, kitten, you want to do a?

01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:38.160
Sure.

01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:38.920
Yes, I will.

01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:39.420
What?

01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:42.360
I don't know.

01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:42.840
All right.

01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:43.800
What do you want?

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:46.320
Whoever wants to open it, open it.

01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:48.240
Hey, you want to open this door with me?

01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:48.760
Sure.

01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:50.400
OK, you grab one side.

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:51.880
I got this side.

01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:52.760
OK, and now?

01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:54.200
I'm going to push up, you push down.

01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:56.240
Let's do it counterclockwise.

01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:59.680
I mean it in a straight line.

01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:01.040
No, no, let's open it.

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:01.440
OK.

01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:03.480
One, two, three, open.

01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:07.120
You pull the handle, and it slides open with a sharp snick.

01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:07.600
Ouch.

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:08.360
Snicked?

01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:09.080
A snick?

01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:10.160
From the adamantium.

01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:11.000
That's the sound of it.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.480
Wouldn't it be three?

01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:13.360
Fucking nerd.

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:14.440
Nice.

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:18.080
It's a deep cut.

01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:22.960
A nerd alert sounds throughout the dungeon.

01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:23.640
Yeah.

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:24.440
So yeah.

01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:26.880
I don't understand what's going on.

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:30.920
Oh my god, my high school girlfriend came to the show.

01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:32.680
What's happening?

01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:35.560
Snicked is a sound effect that Wolverine's just

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:36.520
adamantium plasma.

01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:37.520
Who the fuck a wolf man is?

01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:41.280
Why did you come here, Trisha?

01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:42.000
I'm going home.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.440
You won't go to the snowball dance with me?

01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:47.480
You show up when I'm 40 to the Harmontown?

01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:48.640
It's weird.

01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:51.680
Your theme for your dance was just snowball?

01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:53.440
We had a winter dance, snowball dance.

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:56.400
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:59.840
The room is hot like a summer's day.

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:02.800
And you begin to sweat.

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:04.360
Those things are hot, right?

01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:06.560
Yeah, depending on where you are.

01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:09.200
I guess that's a good point.

01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:12.800
Inside this room are three massive stone lions,

01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:16.200
mouths frozen open, and a ferocious roar.

01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:18.000
You don't see any doors in this room,

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.240
but there are masses of chains hanging from the high ceiling,

01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:23.840
some dangling down like silver vines

01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:25.480
from the clanking canopy.

01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:29.800
I grab one of the chains and I start pulling on it.

01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:33.680
It's too high up.

01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:38.640
Probably the lowest one is about 20 feet off the floor.

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:40.000
I can't jump in?

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:40.600
Nope.

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:41.080
OK.

01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:44.400
You jump on one of these stone lions and jump up there.

01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:46.240
In the center of the room, you also

01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:49.200
see a metal treasure chest.

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:52.440
I approach the treasure chest, try to open it.

01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:55.240
You approach the treasure chest.

01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:58.800
Do you mind if I look at that first?

01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:00.680
Yeah.

01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:02.120
If you look at it first?

01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:03.600
Yeah, I'd like to trap sense on it.

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:04.880
Let them trap sense.

01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:05.480
OK.

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:07.120
What don't you understand about this procedure?

01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:08.320
I don't want you to get hurt.

01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:09.360
Try to be nice.

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.280
No trap sense first.

01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:11.960
A little bit of caution.

01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:12.760
I misunderstood.

01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:14.360
I thought it was just like a foot.

01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:16.040
No, I just wanted to open it and take everything

01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:17.880
and keep it to myself.

01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:19.620
Go ahead, Chris.

01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:20.760
There's a trap.

01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:22.720
Ahhhhh!

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:26.680
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:27.660
Trap sense.

01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:33.080
The Proletariat.

01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:34.840
Ba da da da.

01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:36.480
The Proletariat.

01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:38.200
The Proletariat.

01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:39.720
Are in a trap of economy.

01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:40.880
Oh, trap sense.

01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:54.600
And television was there for the first season of Gilligan's Island to the explosion of our

01:33:54.600 --> 01:34:04.520
president's brains. What did they have in common television? It doesn't make sense to praise that

01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:16.080
as if it's like what a medium. Good job TV. Thanks for the Beatles and killing Kennedy. Thank

01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:21.840
you. I'll keep watching you. Commence with the awards. Who got one and a gun? All right. I knew

01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:27.960
I was watching something important. So what's the nature of the trap? Dan Harmon. I didn't write

01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:37.280
what I said at the Emmy. Oh, shit. I got an email from Don Cheadle. Wrote that for me. Dear Don

01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:44.240
Cheadle, first of all, let's follow each other and send each other. We shouldn't have to direct

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:57.720
tweet each other. So we open the door. There's some lions and some chains. There's a trap. It's a

01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:06.120
good question. You think it might be some sort of mechanical based trap. Mechanical based trap.

01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:12.440
That's situated on the locking mechanism. No other exits from this room. Not that you can see. Hey,

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:19.040
do I think it's related to the lions or the chains? It's not related to anything but the chest. I

01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:28.520
say we all get behind the chest and give her an open from behind it. Like to the hinge. Reach around.

01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:36.920
Yeah. Reach around. Yeah. We all stand behind it. It's designed to trap whoever opens it. Is it a hinge

01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:49.560
chest or is it a lid chest? It's a, I mean, it has a hinged lid. Thank you. It's a hybrid. Hey,

01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:57.440
why don't we take the hinges off the back? That's not a bad idea. Thanks. How do you plan to do that?

01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:06.920
I'm going to just start hitting it with my foot. What do I got here? I have conjure Phillips. How are the

01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:14.040
hinges affixed? Guys, I have a cloak of resistance. We really want to open it, but I have a feeling

01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:21.040
that if we open it, things will happen. Maybe the lions will come to life or something. If I put on

01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:28.520
the cloak of resistance, I can open it and you guys can hide. How do you feel? As far as I understand,

01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:37.800
as the resident wizard, can I cast Detect Magic on this thing? Yeah. And will that allow me to also

01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:43.560
further get a little more information about if there is magic, what kind of magic? Yeah, but I said

01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:50.040
it was a mechanical trap. Yeah, but I, okay, so that's you telling me not to waste my spell. Yeah. Okay,

01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:57.080
so what I'm saying is it's a mechanical trap. There's no mechanics on God's earth that will make these

01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:03.560
lions come to life. I'm not saying they won't at some point, but the trap that we sensed, it's going

01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:08.760
to be, it's like, there's some shit that's going to, you know, it's like, oh, I got shot with a dart or

01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:17.040
there's gas that comes out. It's a mechanical trap. I don't think so. No? I was kind of thinking we

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:24.120
could use some vials of acid on the hinges. Yeah. I love it. All right. I'm just saying don't stand

01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:31.760
in front of the chest when you do it. I still I still I put on my cloak of resistance. Good call. As

01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:40.600
you put it on, you feel more resistant. She hasn't been wearing that the entire time. No, she has. You

01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:56.840
guys are all wearing I put on my cloak of oppositional defiant disorder. No, you don't. Yeah. So do you

01:37:56.840 --> 01:38:04.600
want to do the acid thing? All right. So you pour your vials of acid over over the hinges on the back

01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:11.880
of this chest and it bubbles and you smell a terrible smell. But eventually it eats through. And you

01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:17.080
see these hinges are now gone. You could probably pull up the top of the lid. To me, the smell is good

01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:27.400
because I it's the smell of a trap being foiled. Yeah, then it does smell good to you. All right,

01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:34.680
gentlemen. The snack is lit over. All right, let's do it. All right. All right, you open up the lid and

01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:40.280
as you open it, you see the the trap mechanism inside. It looks like it's a little tiny crossbow. So

01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:46.280
you pull off the lid and it just fires the crossbow in the other direction. See dumb. Child's

01:38:46.280 --> 01:39:00.360
play. Yes. All right. Inside the chest are 60 arrows and two bags of arts and crafts supplies. I'll

01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:11.760
take those. I'll take I take all the glitter. All the glitters. I want all the craftwood. Is this a

01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:20.280
mull rain chest? Thank you. Gentlemen, I'm going to go ahead and scoop up this arts and crafts

01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:26.040
supplies. And I'm going to I'm going to take 20 of these arrows. What? You can't take can't take the

01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:32.440
arrows any arts and crafts. Just taking all of them. She's taking some of them. What? Let's give you

01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:40.040
up the arrows. You got a crossbow? Crossbows take bolts, not arrows. Yeah. All right. Well,

01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:47.640
in celebration, I walk up to one of the stone lions and I kick it and I go yeah. It's it's

01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:53.880
pretty invigorating. It doesn't hurt too bad. You're just feeling I don't have a bow. Stop

01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:59.320
looking everybody. Sorry. Can I can I use wild empathy on the frozen lions to figure out what

01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:05.400
happened? You could try but you don't feel empathy coming towards them as if they're just statues

01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:10.400
or something. I get on top of one of them. And I'm like, I wish one day they'll invent something

01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:20.680
that stores images. I burned that into my mind to your memory. I remember that time. What's in

01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:25.840
the arts and crafts supplies? You know, just general stuff. All right, Spencer, if we want to go

01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:29.720
down this road, we'll go down this road. Figure at least give you the tools to do it with right.

01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:36.840
Okay. I examine the eyes and mouths of the lions. Just looking for gems, baubles, other sundry

01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:45.160
notions. You see their eyes do kind of look a little glinty like glint glint glint things.

01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:51.240
And in celebration of getting all the supplies, I grabbed two of the chains and I started swinging

01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:57.000
around and she can't do that. She can't do that. I tried doing that and you said I couldn't. Yeah,

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:01.680
you're not high enough. You'd have to jump. Right. Not high enough. Guys, I got a glint over here.

01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:12.560
I got glint. Is there anything in its mouth? Who's asking? I'm asking him because he's up

01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:19.920
there. I got glint in the eyes. I don't know. The mouth seems empty. Mouth clear. Eye glinty. Can

01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:25.160
I climb on the, can I climb on top of the lion and then jump on a chain? Yeah, hold up. What

01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:32.000
made you laugh? You didn't say I could do that. Well, you didn't ask. You do that. You climb up

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:38.240
atop the stone lion. You also can, you can get onto one of these chains if you'd like. I'm on,

01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:44.440
I want to get on one of the chains. Then you do. I want to swing around. You swing around. It's

01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:51.360
like a joyous occasion. I have a knife I want to use to pry some of the glintiness out of these

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:58.200
lion eyes. Okay. So you're trying to, you're trying to pry. Yeah. Pry the eye. Yeah. When you,

01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:05.240
when you're jamming it with your prior, you feel the eye go in a little bit like it's being pushed

01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:13.200
inward and you, you hear a rumbling coming from the ceiling above and you on the chain. What did

01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:21.800
you do? You're self shaken on this chain as the ceiling begins to roll. I rushed to the opposite

01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:27.200
and I'm going to climb up on that line. On what now? The lion that's opposite him. So it'd be

01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:32.560
diagonal again. So you're all on lions? Might not be a bad idea. Well, I mean, I'm not. I didn't,

01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:44.400
I'm standing here. Would you like to be on the lion? Yes. All I wanted was to be invited. Everyone

01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:56.320
gets on a lion. The rumbling continues and gets louder and builds to a cliffhanger. Thank you,

01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:02.680
everyone for coming to Harmontown. Let's hear it for Bill, Rob Schroff, Spencer, Dan Harmon.

Drive safe. Thank you, Bill. Thank you, Erin, McGathey, guest com, Traller. Thank all of you.

01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:24.280

01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:34.880
