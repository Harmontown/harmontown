{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:29.520\nGood evening! Welcome to the historic episode number 73 of Harmontown episode 73. Please welcome to the stage your mayor Mr. Dan\n\n00:29.520 --> 00:53.520\nHarmont! Hello, thank you. Guest Comptroller Erin McGathy. How are you doing? How did it go? Starting the show. I think it went okay. I got some encouragement from the\n\n00:53.520 --> 01:07.520\nfront row. Oh yeah? Shouldn't you? Yeah, I mean before the show they're like, oh hey, how's it going? The second row was like, fuck you. They're all holding it, giving me a thumbs down, shaking their heads back and forth.\n\n01:07.520 --> 01:35.520\nThanks for coming on Emmy night and Breaking Bad night. We appreciate it. I'm back. I got an iPhone. I'm back. So I'm not wearing my eye Harmon tonight, which is my notepad that I've been using, only because I'm going to give it a field test. I'm going to give Evernote another week. I'm going to see if Evernote works for keeping track of stuff, which so far it does not. It doesn't work. But I did just use my fingerprint to open my phone and that's disturbing.\n\n01:35.520 --> 01:59.520\nThey say that the fingerprint is stored on the chip inside the phone and that will therefore be accessible to the national security agency. It's already been hacked. Yeah, it's in a chip on a phone. I was never a part of the vote where they said, hey, we're going to give everything but the things in the chips on the\n\n01:59.520 --> 02:11.520\nphone to the national security agency. I was never a part of that. I'm sure they would have said that was okay too, right? Sure. We're putting it in the iCloud. The cloud has a border around it.\n\n02:11.520 --> 02:30.520\nDan, how long do you think it'll be before a jealous boyfriend or girlfriend cuts off their partner's thumb? Oh, and uses it to unlock their phone. Yeah. Well, there's definitely going to be a lot of like sleepy past out sleeping use your phone. Just lifting a limp hand up.\n\n02:30.520 --> 02:49.520\nYeah, well people cut off penises and stuff. Of course, you go through people's purses. If you're in an unhealthy relationship, you're yelling at each other and then you get drunk and then you pass out, then someone's going to use the thumb to, yeah, for sure.\n\n02:49.520 --> 03:02.520\nAnd I feel like people justify a lot of bad behaviors where it's like breaking into their partner's phone like, oh, I was checking the thing and then I came across these things. It's pretty hard to get around the thumb print thing. It's an obvious thing. This has been thumb print talk.\n\n03:02.520 --> 03:19.520\nYeah. I just had the air taken out of the thing I really wanted to talk about tonight, which is something that Duncan Trussell told me earlier tonight, which is that the first cybernetic cyborg hate crime happened at a French McDonald's. But it happened like two years ago. It happened like July of 2012.\n\n03:19.520 --> 03:35.520\nAnd there was a guy in a French McDonald's that had a cybernetic eye. And yeah, people were like, take off that camera. And he was like, it's my eye. It's bolted to my skull. I'm a cyborg. And it was, he was a cyborg.\n\n03:35.520 --> 03:50.520\nAnd they tried to rip it off like a kid, like, you know, like in a comedic, like, take off that beard. You're in disguise. And it's like, ow, I'm Santa Claus. Except they tried to rip his eye out of his head.\n\n03:50.520 --> 04:05.520\nUh, ostensibly, because they're French, I guess, and they're like, both more passionate and have less technology. I don't like, because I'm sure this guy had to be either Canadian or American, right? He's gonna have a robot eye. And yeah, they tried to rip his eye out of his head.\n\n04:05.520 --> 04:17.520\nAnd people were calling it the first cyborg hate crime. But it happened a year ago. So who cares? And I looked it up and it wasn't like, you have a picture in your head of like, like a cyborg eye, like a terminator.\n\n04:17.520 --> 04:30.520\nHe's got like a, it's like a Google, half of a Google Glass is bolted to his head. He's the one who chose to bolt it, like, could easily just wear it, make it rip offable. I'm just saying, just when you look at it, you're kind of like, yeah, take it off.\n\n04:30.520 --> 04:55.520\nIt's kind of like a fedora. It was like, no, I have a really tingly scalp. So I staple my hat to my head. They said no hats in here. They tried to rip it off. And it rips my, my, my skin off. Like, it's like yikes. That's terrible. But like, nothing, but nothing. I mean, I wasn't, I wasn't going to say he deserves it. I've got a camera bolted to his head.\n\n04:55.520 --> 05:03.520\nDon't rip it off. But anyways, I just want to talk about how disappointing it is to find out in the green room that that happened a year ago.\n\n05:03.520 --> 05:05.520\nAre you going to talk to Duncan about it?\n\n05:05.520 --> 05:14.520\nYeah, I'm going to text him and say, yeah, thanks for the scoop jackass. First cyborg hate crime. I'm going to go put a camera in his head.\n\n05:14.520 --> 05:18.520\nAll right, so let's just review some things.\n\n05:18.520 --> 05:21.520\nSo we had a good, good Saturday yesterday.\n\n05:21.520 --> 05:22.520\nYeah.\n\n05:22.520 --> 05:23.520\nHarmon and McGathey style.\n\n05:23.520 --> 05:24.520\nBed Springer.\n\n05:24.520 --> 05:30.520\nYeah, yeah. I definitely got out of bed today. Absolutely because I wanted to.\n\n05:30.520 --> 05:31.520\nYeah.\n\n05:31.520 --> 05:33.520\nLike I was, there was nothing left to do in bed.\n\n05:33.520 --> 05:42.520\nI absolutely reached my limit as I was waking up to the credits of how to succeed in business without really trying at 5am. I was like, it is time to get out of bed.\n\n05:42.520 --> 05:57.520\nYeah. Yesterday we watched Super 8 in time with Justin Timberlake. A little bit of the host. Just a little bit of the Twilight Ladies Alien movie.\n\n05:57.520 --> 06:05.520\nBranded. Tried to watch a little bit of Branded. Batman and Robin and Batman Forever.\n\n06:05.520 --> 06:12.520\nAnd yeah, how to succeed in business without really trying. But what we didn't get around to watching is something I'm kind of excited about because of the iTunes description.\n\n06:12.520 --> 06:23.520\nIt's called the Dinosaur Project. It's on iTunes and the iTunes description is, Dinosaur Project is a team of explorers searching for a mythical creature.\n\n06:23.520 --> 06:28.520\nWhat mythical creature?\n\n06:28.520 --> 06:39.520\nWhen their helicopter is brought down by a flock of enormous birds, they discover strange creatures which civilization has thought extinct for millions of years.\n\n06:39.520 --> 06:42.520\nThe dinosaurs are the title.\n\n06:42.520 --> 06:45.520\nAnd describe the art on the cover of the movie.\n\n06:45.520 --> 06:46.520\nI don't know if I can.\n\n06:46.520 --> 06:50.520\nWell, it's people running from dinosaurs.\n\n06:50.520 --> 06:52.520\nIdentifiable dinosaurs.\n\n06:52.520 --> 06:58.520\nThe Dinosaur Project. But the summary of it, they're really trying to skirt the, like, let's make this a bigger deal.\n\n06:58.520 --> 06:59.520\nYeah.\n\n06:59.520 --> 07:01.520\nYeah, that there are creatures that no one's aware of.\n\n07:01.520 --> 07:09.520\nBut I'm getting tapped because I don't, you know, this is one of those nights. I'm telling you, I got nothing. I got nothing to talk about.\n\n07:09.520 --> 07:13.520\nAnd you're here and...\n\n07:13.520 --> 07:14.520\nWhat?\n\n07:14.520 --> 07:18.520\nOh, you weren't crazy about Super 8.\n\n07:18.520 --> 07:27.520\nI like the first half hour of it and then, you know, as it slowly became a movie about a spider monster.\n\n07:27.520 --> 07:32.520\nOkay, I wasn't trying to throw you under the bus. I didn't think it was really funny watching Dan. I've seen the movie before.\n\n07:32.520 --> 07:35.520\nWatching Dan watch that movie just be like, oh, it's just a spider monster.\n\n07:35.520 --> 07:41.520\nAnd you learn that Dan's experience of watching Super 8 was just like, oh, I can't wait to see what bizarre new monster this is.\n\n07:41.520 --> 07:43.520\nThe payoff that I'm being promised, the payoff.\n\n07:43.520 --> 07:44.520\nThe payoff is friendship.\n\n07:44.520 --> 07:45.520\nSuper payoff.\n\n07:45.520 --> 07:46.520\nSuper payoff.\n\n07:46.520 --> 07:58.520\nIf your movie's about a spider monster and it's CG, you can just show it crawling out of a thing and reveal it and then tell a story about dealing with it.\n\n07:58.520 --> 08:00.520\nYou don't have to hide it from me.\n\n08:00.520 --> 08:08.520\nThat doesn't make it magical. You can't tell me it's magical. That's not fair. That's not fair.\n\n08:08.520 --> 08:18.520\nIt's not magical just because you don't show it. That's not a magical creature. It's a spider monster. It's from Mars and it wants to go back home.\n\n08:18.520 --> 08:26.520\nAnd I would like to see the spider monster as early as possible and I'd like to learn what makes it tick and then get on with the story of the spider monster.\n\n08:26.520 --> 08:34.520\nI do not want to hear the three hour story of what's that and have the third act be, it's a spider monster.\n\n08:34.520 --> 08:39.520\nJust a very well shot, very, very beautiful film.\n\n08:39.520 --> 08:44.520\nIt's about a spider monster and there's just no covering that up these days.\n\n08:44.520 --> 08:48.520\nI got a cyborg eye called Apple TV. I can rewind. I know it's a spider monster.\n\n08:48.520 --> 08:51.520\nAll right.\n\n08:51.520 --> 09:03.520\nOur next guest waited in line for 12 hours to buy my new iPhone for me and didn't get his own.\n\n09:03.520 --> 09:09.520\nWhich I wanted to buy him in exchange for him doing that. His name is Spencer Crittenden.\n\n09:09.520 --> 09:17.520\nSpencer!\n\n09:17.520 --> 09:22.520\nDo you want to be a guest for a change? Do you want to sit and...\n\n09:22.520 --> 09:29.520\nOh boy. That question just overloaded him.\n\n09:29.520 --> 09:35.520\nThere's three chairs up there. Two microphones.\n\n09:35.520 --> 09:40.520\nThanks for waiting in line for me the night before the iPhone came out.\n\n09:40.520 --> 09:42.520\nI'm still kind of out of it.\n\n09:42.520 --> 09:44.520\nDid it throw up your schedule a little bit?\n\n09:44.520 --> 09:48.520\nYeah, a little.\n\n09:48.520 --> 09:55.520\nI didn't sleep and then I slept and now I'm okay kind of.\n\n09:55.520 --> 10:00.520\nThat's how it works. How did...\n\n10:00.520 --> 10:04.520\nHow does waiting in line to buy an iPhone work? That's something I don't know.\n\n10:04.520 --> 10:09.520\nIt's kind of boring. I'm not sociable.\n\n10:09.520 --> 10:13.520\nSo I got there and I didn't really talk to anybody.\n\n10:13.520 --> 10:17.520\nBut other people were talking to people around me and that was great.\n\n10:17.520 --> 10:19.520\nWhat were those people like?\n\n10:19.520 --> 10:20.520\nWhat were the people?\n\n10:20.520 --> 10:24.520\nYeah, the people around you. What were the conversations? What was the scene?\n\n10:24.520 --> 10:30.520\nAbout being cold and whether or not the bathrooms are working.\n\n10:30.520 --> 10:32.520\nWhere were the bathrooms?\n\n10:32.520 --> 10:36.520\nThey were, you know, around. It was an outdoor mall.\n\n10:36.520 --> 10:42.520\nThere's two kinds of bathrooms. They were both locked at some point.\n\n10:42.520 --> 10:46.520\nThese are the details of people that I want. I don't know about people.\n\n10:46.520 --> 10:51.520\nI want to know, you're out on the sidewalk. You're outside an Apple store.\n\n10:51.520 --> 10:54.520\nI'm in a camp chair.\n\n10:54.520 --> 10:55.520\nYou brought a chair?\n\n10:55.520 --> 10:59.520\nYeah, you gotta bring a chair.\n\n10:59.520 --> 11:01.520\nSo where do you make the pee-pees?\n\n11:01.520 --> 11:03.520\nIn the bathroom.\n\n11:03.520 --> 11:05.520\nWhich one? Who's bathroom?\n\n11:05.520 --> 11:07.520\nIt's the mall bathroom. It's public.\n\n11:07.520 --> 11:08.520\nOh, okay.\n\n11:08.520 --> 11:11.520\nYeah, you go up these stairs and there's a bathroom.\n\n11:11.520 --> 11:14.520\nAnd I went and there was a guy out there and he was like,\n\n11:14.520 --> 11:16.520\ndon't go in the bathroom, man. And I was like, what?\n\n11:16.520 --> 11:19.520\nAnd he was like, it's all dark. I couldn't find the light.\n\n11:19.520 --> 11:24.520\nAnd I was like, oh, well, I mean, I've peed in the dark before.\n\n11:24.520 --> 11:29.520\nAlso, how dare he slap his limitations on you like that?\n\n11:29.520 --> 11:34.520\nI couldn't find the light switch. Everyone, everyone stop eliminating.\n\n11:34.520 --> 11:37.520\nYeah, I was like, just don't, just don't follow me in there.\n\n11:37.520 --> 11:42.520\nAnd I just went in there and, you know, my iPhone has a flashlight function.\n\n11:42.520 --> 11:46.520\nYeah, very funny that a guy in line for new technology was like, dark.\n\n11:46.520 --> 11:47.520\nYeah.\n\n11:47.520 --> 11:51.520\nWell, yeah, that would be it. That's the point of being an Apple guy is,\n\n11:51.520 --> 11:53.520\nyeah, Apple takes care of that.\n\n11:53.520 --> 11:56.520\nLike Apple turned the lights off. I don't know what to do.\n\n11:56.520 --> 12:00.520\nSo wait, he didn't want you to follow him into the bathroom?\n\n12:00.520 --> 12:03.520\nNo, I told him not to follow me because he's a weird guy\n\n12:03.520 --> 12:06.520\ntelling people about stuff going on in the bathroom.\n\n12:06.520 --> 12:08.520\nYou said don't follow me to someone?\n\n12:08.520 --> 12:10.520\nYeah.\n\n12:10.520 --> 12:12.520\nYou were saying I'm going to go check this out.\n\n12:12.520 --> 12:16.520\nYeah, well, he was presumably out of the bathroom having gone in there\n\n12:16.520 --> 12:19.520\nand I was going in there in spite of his warning.\n\n12:19.520 --> 12:21.520\nSo he might be like, oh, what's all the fuss about?\n\n12:21.520 --> 12:23.520\nOr he might be like, I'm going to murder that guy.\n\n12:23.520 --> 12:25.520\nI mean, who am I to judge?\n\n12:25.520 --> 12:28.520\nBut don't follow me in there seemed to be fair.\n\n12:28.520 --> 12:32.520\nCan you describe this bath town bathroom crier?\n\n12:32.520 --> 12:37.520\nHe was, he was a Mexican guy with a short, spiky hair.\n\n12:37.520 --> 12:39.520\nMaybe five foot four.\n\n12:39.520 --> 12:40.520\nFine, you know.\n\n12:40.520 --> 12:43.520\nAre you not using any kind of race because you're not racist?\n\n12:43.520 --> 12:44.520\nHe said Mexican.\n\n12:44.520 --> 12:45.520\nOh, okay.\n\n12:45.520 --> 12:46.520\nDefinitely.\n\n12:46.520 --> 12:47.520\nI didn't hear it because I'm not racist.\n\n12:47.520 --> 12:48.520\nNice.\n\n12:52.520 --> 12:55.520\nOkay, so a tiny, tiny man?\n\n12:55.520 --> 12:56.520\nYeah.\n\n12:56.520 --> 12:57.520\nHe said five foot four?\n\n12:57.520 --> 12:58.520\nHe's small, yeah.\n\n12:58.520 --> 12:59.520\nSorry if you're in the audience and you're five foot four\n\n12:59.520 --> 13:03.520\nand you don't like being called tiny.\n\n13:03.520 --> 13:06.520\nSo definitely compared to you, a tiny, tiny little man.\n\n13:06.520 --> 13:07.520\nYeah, a lot of people are.\n\n13:07.520 --> 13:08.520\nDon't go in the bathroom.\n\n13:08.520 --> 13:10.520\nI can't find the light.\n\n13:10.520 --> 13:12.520\nAnd you said, okay, don't follow me.\n\n13:12.520 --> 13:13.520\nYeah.\n\n13:13.520 --> 13:15.520\nAnd went in the bathroom and found the lighter.\n\n13:15.520 --> 13:16.520\nJust use your iPhone as a.\n\n13:16.520 --> 13:18.520\nWell, I was like, I'll take my chances.\n\n13:18.520 --> 13:21.520\nAnd then he was like, well, I mean, I looked all around.\n\n13:21.520 --> 13:23.520\nIt's really, really dark in there.\n\n13:23.520 --> 13:24.520\nAnd I was like, I'll be fine.\n\n13:24.520 --> 13:26.520\nJust don't, don't come in there.\n\n13:31.520 --> 13:32.520\nOh man.\n\n13:32.520 --> 13:35.520\nSomething happened with that guy and his mom at a certain point.\n\n13:35.520 --> 13:38.520\nSomething, something where he went into the room and he's like, mom,\n\n13:38.520 --> 13:40.520\nlike the lights out and she came in and turned the light on and,\n\n13:40.520 --> 13:42.520\nand beat him with a hammer.\n\n13:42.520 --> 13:45.520\nJust with a lamp.\n\n13:45.520 --> 13:49.520\nSo he loves and hates light.\n\n13:49.520 --> 13:54.520\nSo the, was he a fellow Apple liner?\n\n13:54.520 --> 13:55.520\nI think he was.\n\n13:55.520 --> 13:56.520\nYeah.\n\n13:56.520 --> 13:58.520\nAnd that was at about 2 30 in the morning.\n\n13:58.520 --> 14:01.520\nI think most people out were that there was a, you know,\n\n14:01.520 --> 14:03.520\nsome security guards and cops rolling around.\n\n14:03.520 --> 14:05.520\nBut other than that, it was just Apple people.\n\n14:05.520 --> 14:08.520\nAnd was he, was he waiting for you when you came out?\n\n14:08.520 --> 14:09.520\nDid you say that already?\n\n14:09.520 --> 14:10.520\nHe was still there.\n\n14:10.520 --> 14:11.520\nHe hadn't moved.\n\n14:11.520 --> 14:12.520\nI went pretty fast.\n\n14:12.520 --> 14:15.520\nI was, you know, ready to defend myself.\n\n14:15.520 --> 14:17.520\nSo, yeah.\n\n14:17.520 --> 14:18.520\nHe was still there?\n\n14:18.520 --> 14:19.520\nYeah.\n\n14:19.520 --> 14:20.520\nWaiting outside the bathroom?\n\n14:20.520 --> 14:21.520\nNot waiting outside.\n\n14:21.520 --> 14:25.520\nHe was, there's like a kind of area that's like a balcony over these stairs\n\n14:25.520 --> 14:27.520\nbecause you got to go upstairs.\n\n14:27.520 --> 14:31.520\nSo it's like, he was at a balcony overlooking this place\n\n14:31.520 --> 14:35.520\nwhen he, you know, told me of the bathroom's lights.\n\n14:35.520 --> 14:36.520\nYeah.\n\n14:36.520 --> 14:37.520\nAnd so yeah.\n\n14:37.520 --> 14:39.520\nAnd he just stayed there and watched you go to the bathroom\n\n14:39.520 --> 14:41.520\nand come back out.\n\n14:41.520 --> 14:43.520\nYeah, I'm sure.\n\n14:43.520 --> 14:46.520\nI don't, I don't think of it like that, but.\n\n14:46.520 --> 14:48.520\nWho saved your place in line when you were using the bathroom?\n\n14:48.520 --> 14:49.520\nNo one.\n\n14:49.520 --> 14:50.520\nI had my chair there.\n\n14:50.520 --> 14:53.520\nSo a lot of people, once they had chairs going on,\n\n14:53.520 --> 14:55.520\nthey were getting up and leaving and coming back.\n\n14:55.520 --> 14:56.520\nSort of an honor system.\n\n14:56.520 --> 15:02.520\nBut how much, how much are you allowed to stretch that?\n\n15:02.520 --> 15:03.520\nHow much did you see it stretch?\n\n15:03.520 --> 15:06.520\nLike the idea of just putting a chair there and just taking off.\n\n15:06.520 --> 15:08.520\nThe person who was like the fifth in line was bullshit.\n\n15:08.520 --> 15:10.520\nIt was just some old lady and.\n\n15:10.520 --> 15:14.520\nShe just put a chair out and fucking went home and watched.\n\n15:14.520 --> 15:16.520\nShe went down for four, she left for four hours,\n\n15:16.520 --> 15:19.520\ncame back for a half hour, left for about seven hours,\n\n15:19.520 --> 15:23.520\ncame back two minutes or two hours before opening.\n\n15:23.520 --> 15:25.520\nBut other than that, wasn't there at all.\n\n15:25.520 --> 15:27.520\nSo like most of the time she wasn't even there.\n\n15:27.520 --> 15:29.520\nSo that was kind of bullshit.\n\n15:29.520 --> 15:30.520\nYeah.\n\n15:30.520 --> 15:31.520\nThat's interesting.\n\n15:31.520 --> 15:32.520\nThis concept.\n\n15:32.520 --> 15:34.520\nThis is the other thing that haunts me.\n\n15:34.520 --> 15:37.520\nIf you had not waited in line for me so I could have my precious iPhone\n\n15:37.520 --> 15:38.520\nthe next day.\n\n15:38.520 --> 15:40.520\nHow long would it have taken?\n\n15:40.520 --> 15:42.520\nWas there a line the next day?\n\n15:42.520 --> 15:46.520\nThey would have been sold out the next day of most stuff.\n\n15:46.520 --> 15:49.520\nEspecially that, that model.\n\n15:49.520 --> 15:53.520\nSo the night that you spent in a lawn chair and a sidewalk\n\n15:53.520 --> 15:58.520\nearned me how many days with an iPhone that I wouldn't have had.\n\n15:58.520 --> 15:59.520\nI mean six to seven.\n\n15:59.520 --> 16:00.520\nSix to seven.\n\n16:00.520 --> 16:01.520\nAll right.\n\n16:01.520 --> 16:02.520\nSpencer.\n\n16:02.520 --> 16:03.520\nAll right.\n\n16:03.520 --> 16:04.520\nAll right.\n\n16:04.520 --> 16:07.520\nDan Harmon too.\n\n16:07.520 --> 16:11.520\nFor not abusing his employees.\n\n16:11.520 --> 16:16.520\nI got seven days out of his 12 hours.\n\n16:16.520 --> 16:17.520\nPretty good.\n\n16:17.520 --> 16:18.520\nI felt bad.\n\n16:18.520 --> 16:21.520\nI told him to get himself one and then he couldn't.\n\n16:21.520 --> 16:23.520\nBecause he was an Apple employee.\n\n16:23.520 --> 16:24.520\nYeah.\n\n16:24.520 --> 16:28.520\nI had an employee account that gave me like a cheap bill.\n\n16:28.520 --> 16:31.520\nBut as a result I was like locked onto bullshit.\n\n16:31.520 --> 16:34.520\nAnd I, you know, stopped being an employee.\n\n16:34.520 --> 16:37.520\nBut I guess I didn't stop having a plan so I couldn't get a phone.\n\n16:37.520 --> 16:40.520\nSo it was more about your phone plan than your, than the Apple.\n\n16:40.520 --> 16:41.520\nYeah.\n\n16:41.520 --> 16:43.520\nWell I got the phone plan because of Apple.\n\n16:43.520 --> 16:47.520\nBut it was the phone plans, lockedness.\n\n16:47.520 --> 16:49.520\nIt was just bureaucracies.\n\n16:49.520 --> 16:50.520\nAll right.\n\n16:50.520 --> 16:51.520\nAll right.\n\n16:51.520 --> 16:52.520\nOh my gosh.\n\n16:52.520 --> 16:54.520\nYou know what time it is?\n\n16:54.520 --> 16:57.520\nIt's McAfee Game Corner time.\n\n16:57.520 --> 16:58.520\nYeah.\n\n16:58.520 --> 17:05.520\nAll right.\n\n17:05.520 --> 17:06.520\nAll right.\n\n17:06.520 --> 17:09.520\nWelcome to McAfee's Game Corner.\n\n17:09.520 --> 17:12.520\nWe'll do, Spencer, you want to play?\n\n17:12.520 --> 17:14.520\nOh yeah.\n\n17:14.520 --> 17:16.520\nCan anyone else play?\n\n17:16.520 --> 17:19.520\nLike how many people can play?\n\n17:19.520 --> 17:22.520\nAre we, we could have one more person.\n\n17:22.520 --> 17:26.520\nBut only if maybe he's created something with you in the past.\n\n17:26.520 --> 17:29.520\nAnd only if you've been, is that what you're doing?\n\n17:29.520 --> 17:30.520\nWell that's what I was thinking about.\n\n17:30.520 --> 17:32.520\nBut I don't want to, I don't know what your game is.\n\n17:32.520 --> 17:34.520\nSo I don't want, am I ruining it?\n\n17:34.520 --> 17:46.520\nLet's welcome Rob Schrab to the stage.\n\n17:46.520 --> 17:49.520\nCan I confess something that I just realized as I sat down?\n\n17:49.520 --> 17:53.520\nI didn't realize consciously I was doing this or I would have been honest about it.\n\n17:53.520 --> 18:00.520\nWhat I thought through my head was, if there was someone else up here, according to the format of the show, I get to sit down.\n\n18:00.520 --> 18:03.520\nThe format of the show being me doing whatever I want.\n\n18:03.520 --> 18:04.520\nSo I could have sat down.\n\n18:04.520 --> 18:06.520\nYou could have started the show sitting.\n\n18:06.520 --> 18:08.520\nYeah, I could roll out here on a surfboard.\n\n18:08.520 --> 18:09.520\nYou could lay down.\n\n18:09.520 --> 18:11.520\nKitten's pulling it, yeah.\n\n18:11.520 --> 18:12.520\nAnyways, thank you.\n\n18:12.520 --> 18:13.520\nHow are you doing, Rob?\n\n18:13.520 --> 18:14.520\nI'm doing good.\n\n18:14.520 --> 18:15.520\nWow, double making it.\n\n18:15.520 --> 18:19.520\nYou're doing good, good, good, good.\n\n18:19.520 --> 18:24.520\nI just saw this Insidious Chapter 2, you ever see that?\n\n18:24.520 --> 18:27.520\nAnybody see this Insidious Chapter 2?\n\n18:27.520 --> 18:29.520\nWhat's Insidious 1?\n\n18:29.520 --> 18:33.520\nThat's like, that's one of those kids' paranormal movies, right?\n\n18:33.520 --> 18:35.520\nYeah, the first one is not too bad.\n\n18:35.520 --> 18:37.520\nIs it another with the camera?\n\n18:37.520 --> 18:39.520\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n18:39.520 --> 18:42.520\nThere were cameras involved.\n\n18:42.520 --> 18:44.520\nThat's why I got to see it.\n\n18:44.520 --> 18:49.520\nWell, in our day, there were always cameras involved, but there was craftsmanship too.\n\n18:49.520 --> 18:53.520\nYou didn't just put one of these things on a dresser and say,\n\n18:53.520 --> 18:56.520\noh boy, I'm Citizen Kane now.\n\n18:56.520 --> 18:58.520\nI didn't like it.\n\n18:58.520 --> 19:05.520\nI know that felt like a setup that I was going to start doing like 15 minutes on why Insidious 2 was bad,\n\n19:05.520 --> 19:07.520\nbut I just wanted to say I didn't like it.\n\n19:07.520 --> 19:09.520\nWe can get on with the game.\n\n19:09.520 --> 19:11.520\nDid you see it in the theater?\n\n19:11.520 --> 19:13.520\nI saw it with Steve Agee.\n\n19:13.520 --> 19:15.520\nIn the theater, yes.\n\n19:15.520 --> 19:17.520\nWhat's it like seeing a movie with Steve Agee?\n\n19:17.520 --> 19:18.520\nWhat's it like?\n\n19:18.520 --> 19:19.520\nYeah.\n\n19:19.520 --> 19:22.520\nHe leans forward a lot, which is kind of...\n\n19:22.520 --> 19:28.520\nYou know what, I'll sit and crouch, but he'll like lean forward a lot, and that's weird.\n\n19:28.520 --> 19:30.520\nI think it's because he's really tall.\n\n19:30.520 --> 19:32.520\nI think it's because he's...\n\n19:32.520 --> 19:34.520\nHe has anxiety about being a tall guy at a movie theater.\n\n19:34.520 --> 19:35.520\nI have that.\n\n19:35.520 --> 19:39.520\nWe saw the conjuring together, which was really good.\n\n19:39.520 --> 19:40.520\nI really liked that.\n\n19:40.520 --> 19:42.520\nI thought it had some heightened moments.\n\n19:42.520 --> 19:43.520\nWhat did you see? What?\n\n19:43.520 --> 19:44.520\nThe conjuring.\n\n19:44.520 --> 19:45.520\nThe conjuring.\n\n19:45.520 --> 19:46.520\nIt's another movie.\n\n19:46.520 --> 19:47.520\nYeah.\n\n19:47.520 --> 19:49.520\nIs that about some kind of wizard or something?\n\n19:49.520 --> 19:50.520\nNo.\n\n19:50.520 --> 19:51.520\nNo is that...\n\n19:51.520 --> 19:52.520\nLike a Harry Potter thing?\n\n19:52.520 --> 19:54.520\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n19:54.520 --> 19:56.520\nIs that one of those Hogwarts?\n\n19:56.520 --> 19:58.520\nNo, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n19:58.520 --> 20:00.520\nKeep going, keep going.\n\n20:01.520 --> 20:03.520\nNo, it was this thing.\n\n20:03.520 --> 20:10.520\nIt started Ron Livingston and the guy that played Owlman from Watchmen that looks like Rob Hubel.\n\n20:10.520 --> 20:12.520\nYeah, Rob Hubel from the Watchmen.\n\n20:12.520 --> 20:14.520\nYeah, yeah, Rob Hubel from the Watchmen.\n\n20:14.520 --> 20:16.520\nWho's also an insidious too.\n\n20:18.520 --> 20:22.520\nAnd I heard that Rob Hubel auditioned for Abraham Lincoln Vampire.\n\n20:22.520 --> 20:24.520\nWait, as Abraham Lincoln?\n\n20:24.520 --> 20:26.520\nAs Abraham Lincoln, yeah.\n\n20:26.520 --> 20:28.520\nThat'd be a different movie, wasn't it?\n\n20:29.520 --> 20:31.520\nI think it would go something like this.\n\n20:31.520 --> 20:34.520\nA four score and seven.\n\n20:34.520 --> 20:35.520\nYeah.\n\n20:35.520 --> 20:36.520\nDo you hear that, Rob Hubel?\n\n20:36.520 --> 20:37.520\nThat's what you sound like.\n\n20:37.520 --> 20:39.520\nThat's what you sound like, Cubes.\n\n20:39.520 --> 20:40.520\nWhere was I?\n\n20:40.520 --> 20:45.520\nNo, we saw The Conjuring together and Watches Scary Movies with A.G. is awesome because he's like,\n\n20:45.520 --> 20:49.520\nOh, oh, oh, oh, shit during all the tense moments.\n\n20:49.520 --> 20:50.520\nIt was really fun.\n\n20:50.520 --> 20:51.520\nIt was fun.\n\n20:51.520 --> 20:53.520\nThis movie was so fun because it sucked.\n\n20:54.520 --> 20:55.520\nInsidious too, huh?\n\n20:55.520 --> 20:56.520\nInsidious too.\n\n20:56.520 --> 20:59.520\nSo what, had you seen Insidious One?\n\n20:59.520 --> 21:00.520\nYes, I did.\n\n21:00.520 --> 21:01.520\nWell, what's Insidious One?\n\n21:01.520 --> 21:02.520\nGive me the breakdown.\n\n21:02.520 --> 21:03.520\nOkay, give me the goods.\n\n21:03.520 --> 21:04.520\nGive me the decent.\n\n21:04.520 --> 21:05.520\nInsidious, Insidious One is...\n\n21:05.520 --> 21:06.520\nGive me the elevator pitch.\n\n21:06.520 --> 21:08.520\nOkay, okay, Insidious One is basic.\n\n21:08.520 --> 21:09.520\nGive me beginning, middle, end.\n\n21:09.520 --> 21:10.520\nOkay.\n\n21:10.520 --> 21:11.520\nInsidious One.\n\n21:11.520 --> 21:12.520\n5,000 words.\n\n21:12.520 --> 21:13.520\nIt's basically Poltergeist.\n\n21:13.520 --> 21:17.520\nIt's pain in and all of the slug lines.\n\n21:17.520 --> 21:18.520\nThere's each location.\n\n21:18.520 --> 21:19.520\nGive me the one sheet.\n\n21:19.520 --> 21:20.520\nOkay, well...\n\n21:20.520 --> 21:22.520\nGive me the transportation budget.\n\n21:22.520 --> 21:24.520\nNo, no, seriously.\n\n21:24.520 --> 21:26.520\nIt's shot list.\n\n21:26.520 --> 21:28.520\nTry some story books.\n\n21:28.520 --> 21:30.520\nGive me the shipwreck comic strip of it.\n\n21:30.520 --> 21:31.520\nGive me the novelization.\n\n21:31.520 --> 21:32.520\nYeah.\n\n21:32.520 --> 21:33.520\nThe novelization.\n\n21:33.520 --> 21:34.520\nOkay.\n\n21:34.520 --> 21:37.520\nGive me just the McDonald's cups.\n\n21:37.520 --> 21:38.520\nOkay.\n\n21:38.520 --> 21:41.520\nI can't keep up with it.\n\n21:41.520 --> 21:45.520\nNo, no, Insidious One is like this couple.\n\n21:45.520 --> 21:47.520\nThey have a kid.\n\n21:47.520 --> 21:48.520\nHe goes unconscious.\n\n21:48.520 --> 21:50.520\nHe doesn't come out of consciousness.\n\n21:50.520 --> 21:57.520\nThey find out that he has the ability to astral project, but got lost in this place called\n\n21:57.520 --> 21:58.520\nthe further.\n\n21:58.520 --> 22:03.520\nAnd the thing about when you astrally project, your spirit goes out of your body, but then\n\n22:03.520 --> 22:09.520\nall, it's like your empty vessel of a body like draws ghosts who want to.\n\n22:09.520 --> 22:12.520\nIt's like a lawn chair outside an Apple store.\n\n22:12.520 --> 22:13.520\nYes.\n\n22:13.520 --> 22:14.520\nYes.\n\n22:14.520 --> 22:18.520\nAnd all that stuff is like really good.\n\n22:18.520 --> 22:23.520\nAnd then it kind of at the end, it had some good stuff.\n\n22:23.520 --> 22:25.520\nIt's just a spider monster.\n\n22:25.520 --> 22:29.520\nIt was a four-legged spider monster.\n\n22:29.520 --> 22:30.520\nInteresting.\n\n22:30.520 --> 22:31.520\nRob, how do you think that is?\n\n22:31.520 --> 22:32.520\nIt's called Man.\n\n22:32.520 --> 22:36.520\nIt asks the question.\n\n22:36.520 --> 22:42.520\nIt's a movie that asks the question, who is the real spider monster?\n\n22:42.520 --> 22:45.520\nIsn't man just a four-legged spider monster?\n\n22:45.520 --> 22:46.520\nThat's what I meant.\n\n22:46.520 --> 22:47.520\nThat doesn't spin webs.\n\n22:47.520 --> 22:48.520\nThat's what I meant by a four-legged.\n\n22:48.520 --> 22:49.520\nI know.\n\n22:49.520 --> 22:50.520\nI'm standing.\n\n22:50.520 --> 22:52.520\nI'm having fun with you.\n\n22:52.520 --> 22:53.520\nOkay.\n\n22:53.520 --> 22:54.520\nGood.\n\n22:54.520 --> 23:01.520\nRob, how well do you think that prepared you for McGathey's Game Corner?\n\n23:01.520 --> 23:02.520\nVery well.\n\n23:02.520 --> 23:03.520\nYes.\n\n23:03.520 --> 23:04.520\nAll right.\n\n23:04.520 --> 23:11.520\nOh my God, guys, that was my first good sound cue ever that I've ever done.\n\n23:11.520 --> 23:12.520\nThanks.\n\n23:12.520 --> 23:19.520\nSo Harmontown attracts a variety of dynamic and interesting characters.\n\n23:19.520 --> 23:21.520\nMan, stand up.\n\n23:21.520 --> 23:25.520\nOne, two, three, four, sixteen.\n\n23:25.520 --> 23:27.520\nSo many people.\n\n23:27.520 --> 23:31.520\nSo many dynamic, interesting people who become a part of the show a few months ago.\n\n23:31.520 --> 23:32.520\nStand up.\n\n23:32.520 --> 23:33.520\nI'm sorry.\n\n23:33.520 --> 23:42.520\nA few months ago, we were gifted with some beef jerky.\n\n23:42.520 --> 23:45.520\nOoh, I heard about this.\n\n23:45.520 --> 23:48.520\nOoh, the beef jerky.\n\n23:48.520 --> 23:54.520\nWe were gifted by a man named Bill, who's sitting in the front row.\n\n23:54.520 --> 23:56.520\nThat's Bill, Rob, in the black shirt.\n\n23:56.520 --> 23:57.520\nI heard about it.\n\n23:57.520 --> 23:59.520\nBill, why don't you jump on the mic for this intro?\n\n23:59.520 --> 24:00.520\nYeah, why don't you, Bill?\n\n24:00.520 --> 24:01.520\nJust for the intro.\n\n24:01.520 --> 24:06.520\nOkay, so I'm up here for five seconds and then I sit down, right?\n\n24:06.520 --> 24:08.520\nWe'll see what happens.\n\n24:08.520 --> 24:14.520\nSo Bill brought some very special beef jerky from Texas from this beef jerky distributor\n\n24:14.520 --> 24:15.520\nthat he very much believes in.\n\n24:15.520 --> 24:19.520\nDid you close the Ziploc bag before you left Texas?\n\n24:19.520 --> 24:21.520\nBill did everything right.\n\n24:21.520 --> 24:24.520\nThis was a totally random bad luck experience.\n\n24:24.520 --> 24:25.520\nThis is beef's fault.\n\n24:25.520 --> 24:27.520\nThis is beef's fault.\n\n24:27.520 --> 24:29.520\nIt's not necessarily the manufacturer's fault.\n\n24:29.520 --> 24:31.520\nIt's just a random occurrence.\n\n24:31.520 --> 24:32.520\nThings happen.\n\n24:32.520 --> 24:33.520\nI just want to forget about it.\n\n24:33.520 --> 24:35.520\nWell, no, of course you can't.\n\n24:35.520 --> 24:41.520\nHas the game started?\n\n24:41.520 --> 24:45.520\nSo Bill passed out the jerky.\n\n24:45.520 --> 24:47.520\nThere was some mold on the jerky, whatever.\n\n24:47.520 --> 24:49.520\nThere was a lot of mold.\n\n24:49.520 --> 24:51.520\nOkay, someone just said there's a lot of mold on the jerky.\n\n24:51.520 --> 24:54.520\nAnyway, it doesn't matter.\n\n24:54.520 --> 24:59.520\nAnyway, Bill, since then has sat in the front row and has become part of the landscape that\n\n24:59.520 --> 25:01.520\nis the Harmonton audience.\n\n25:01.520 --> 25:10.520\nSo we are going to play a game called the Beef Fungus Bill Game.\n\n25:10.520 --> 25:18.520\nWhen you brought him up, I was reminded that he made a iPad stand.\n\n25:18.520 --> 25:24.520\nBill obviously also makes us wood stuff.\n\n25:24.520 --> 25:26.520\nHe made quotes on little slats for us, Harmonton quotes.\n\n25:26.520 --> 25:31.520\nBy the way, Bill, remember the quote that we thought was erroneous or whatever that said?\n\n25:31.520 --> 25:32.520\nIt wasn't.\n\n25:32.520 --> 25:34.520\nI said whatever was on there.\n\n25:34.520 --> 25:36.520\nOh, that sounds like a point.\n\n25:36.520 --> 25:38.520\nIt was written on an anus or something.\n\n25:38.520 --> 25:39.520\nYeah.\n\n25:39.520 --> 25:42.520\nFor some reason I said that, probably because I was on something else.\n\n25:42.520 --> 25:43.520\nPittsburgh.\n\n25:43.520 --> 25:49.520\nAnd then also he made a Dungeon Master iPad stand for Spencer to Dungeon Master with.\n\n25:49.520 --> 25:51.520\nAnd Adam Goldberg.\n\n25:51.520 --> 25:52.520\nWhat?\n\n25:52.520 --> 25:54.520\nAll right.\n\n25:54.520 --> 25:57.520\nSo Bill, Bill is, we are aware.\n\n25:57.520 --> 26:00.520\nThere's more than one prototype.\n\n26:00.520 --> 26:04.520\nWe are aware of Bill, and Bill is part of Harmonton.\n\n26:04.520 --> 26:06.520\nBut what do we really know about Bill, you guys?\n\n26:06.520 --> 26:08.520\nI just said it all.\n\n26:08.520 --> 26:09.520\nRight, exactly.\n\n26:09.520 --> 26:10.520\nThat's all we know.\n\n26:10.520 --> 26:11.520\nYeah, yeah.\n\n26:11.520 --> 26:15.520\nSo earlier today, Bill sent me some true facts about himself.\n\n26:15.520 --> 26:16.520\nOh, nice.\n\n26:16.520 --> 26:17.520\nAll right.\n\n26:17.520 --> 26:18.520\nSo thank you, Bill.\n\n26:18.520 --> 26:19.520\nYou can go ahead and sit down.\n\n26:19.520 --> 26:21.520\nI know why your face delay affects the judging.\n\n26:21.520 --> 26:22.520\nBut thank you.\n\n26:22.520 --> 26:24.520\nLet's give him a really big hand.\n\n26:24.520 --> 26:31.520\nNow, sweetie, can I ask you, when Bill sent you this email with all these true facts about himself,\n\n26:31.520 --> 26:33.520\nwas that solicited?\n\n26:33.520 --> 26:37.520\nOr is this another situation?\n\n26:37.520 --> 26:39.520\nOh, that's so flattering.\n\n26:39.520 --> 26:40.520\nI would be flattering.\n\n26:40.520 --> 26:43.520\nNo, it was not a situation.\n\n26:43.520 --> 26:45.520\nWhat's the situation?\n\n26:45.520 --> 26:48.520\nSome guy sending her an email with a bunch of facts about himself.\n\n26:48.520 --> 26:49.520\nI'm solicited.\n\n26:49.520 --> 26:51.520\nHas this happened before?\n\n26:51.520 --> 26:52.520\nTo you.\n\n26:52.520 --> 26:54.520\nWell, look at her, bro.\n\n26:54.520 --> 26:56.520\nOh, that's very nice.\n\n26:56.520 --> 26:57.520\nThat's very nice.\n\n26:57.520 --> 26:58.520\nHappens all the time.\n\n26:58.520 --> 27:00.520\nAvoiding the question.\n\n27:00.520 --> 27:01.520\nAll right.\n\n27:01.520 --> 27:04.520\nShe does a podcast where she says, hey, I care about you.\n\n27:04.520 --> 27:05.520\nI'm Erin McGathy.\n\n27:05.520 --> 27:06.520\nI'm your best friend.\n\n27:06.520 --> 27:07.520\nI care about your relationships.\n\n27:07.520 --> 27:08.520\nHere's all about mine.\n\n27:08.520 --> 27:15.520\nAnd it invites its fair share of intimacy from strangers.\n\n27:15.520 --> 27:22.520\nI wish that it came in the form of just facts about listeners.\n\n27:22.520 --> 27:24.520\nThat would be fun.\n\n27:24.520 --> 27:25.520\nAll right.\n\n27:25.520 --> 27:28.520\nSo we're going to go ahead and play this game.\n\n27:28.520 --> 27:30.520\nThere are, we have 10 questions.\n\n27:30.520 --> 27:31.520\nI'm sorry, sweetie.\n\n27:31.520 --> 27:32.520\nCan we get Rob a cup?\n\n27:32.520 --> 27:33.520\nI don't want a cup.\n\n27:33.520 --> 27:34.520\nNo, we can get you a cup.\n\n27:34.520 --> 27:35.520\nHold on.\n\n27:35.520 --> 27:36.520\nNo, no, no.\n\n27:36.520 --> 27:37.520\nNo.\n\n27:37.520 --> 27:38.520\nKeep going with your game thing.\n\n27:38.520 --> 27:39.520\nGo get with your game thing.\n\n27:39.520 --> 27:40.520\nGo get with your game thing.\n\n27:40.520 --> 27:41.520\nNo, no.\n\n27:41.520 --> 27:42.520\nI'm sorry.\n\n27:42.520 --> 27:44.520\nI'm not going to interrupt anymore.\n\n27:44.520 --> 27:45.520\nI'm terribly sorry.\n\n27:45.520 --> 27:46.520\nHave a drink, Rob.\n\n27:46.520 --> 27:49.520\nWe're going to get you a cup so you can have a drink.\n\n27:49.520 --> 27:50.520\nOkay.\n\n27:50.520 --> 27:51.520\nThe explanation of this game is very, very brief.\n\n27:51.520 --> 27:53.520\nSo I'm going to explain it very briefly.\n\n27:53.520 --> 27:56.520\nI have 10 questions.\n\n27:56.520 --> 28:01.520\nOne, every question includes a true fact about Bill.\n\n28:01.520 --> 28:03.520\nThe other things are not true.\n\n28:03.520 --> 28:06.520\nThe three of you are going to, individually, you're on your own team.\n\n28:06.520 --> 28:11.520\nYou're going to decide what is the true Bill fact.\n\n28:11.520 --> 28:18.520\nYou are allowed to discuss it with each other, discuss it with yourself, explain why you\n\n28:18.520 --> 28:23.520\ndiscuss it with yourself, explain why you feel that way.\n\n28:23.520 --> 28:25.520\nSo let's go ahead and get started.\n\n28:25.520 --> 28:26.520\nAll right.\n\n28:26.520 --> 28:29.520\nOne of these is true.\n\n28:29.520 --> 28:31.520\nWe're picking the one that's true.\n\n28:31.520 --> 28:32.520\nYou're picking the one that's true.\n\n28:32.520 --> 28:33.520\nWho goes first?\n\n28:33.520 --> 28:34.520\nWho goes first?\n\n28:34.520 --> 28:39.520\nWe'll go, we'll do it counterclockwise, and we'll start with Spencer.\n\n28:39.520 --> 28:40.520\nWe're in a line.\n\n28:40.520 --> 28:41.520\nI know.\n\n28:41.520 --> 28:42.520\nI just...\n\n28:42.520 --> 28:44.520\nWho's reading the clock?\n\n28:44.520 --> 28:46.520\nI just threw it out there.\n\n28:46.520 --> 28:51.520\nWe'll start with Spencer, and we'll go Spencer, Dan, Rob, as far as who gets to give their\n\n28:51.520 --> 28:53.520\nfinal answer first.\n\n28:53.520 --> 28:54.520\nAll right.\n\n28:54.520 --> 28:56.520\nQuestion number one.\n\n28:56.520 --> 28:57.520\nOne of these is real.\n\n28:57.520 --> 29:00.520\nThe other two are fake.\n\n29:00.520 --> 29:04.520\nBill spells his name with one L because...\n\n29:04.520 --> 29:07.520\nAnd these are quotes.\n\n29:07.520 --> 29:10.520\nA, it's my own little pretentious contrivance.\n\n29:10.520 --> 29:14.520\nIn honor of Sesame Street, two L's seems like a waste.\n\n29:14.520 --> 29:17.520\nB, it's my own little pretentious contrivance.\n\n29:17.520 --> 29:20.520\nMy father was a two L'd Bill who earned both.\n\n29:20.520 --> 29:23.520\nI leave it to you to decide what that means.\n\n29:23.520 --> 29:26.520\nC, it's my own little pretentious contrivance.\n\n29:26.520 --> 29:30.520\nI enjoy correcting people.\n\n29:30.520 --> 29:32.520\nSo it's me, right?\n\n29:32.520 --> 29:35.520\nYeah, but you guys can discuss what you...\n\n29:35.520 --> 29:38.520\nCan we have some thought music?\n\n29:38.520 --> 29:40.520\nYou can.\n\n29:40.520 --> 29:44.520\nI'm not the best DJ, but no, you can.\n\n29:44.520 --> 29:47.520\nI mean, it might be a cow farting, but I'll find something.\n\n29:47.520 --> 29:49.520\nOkay, I thought it'd be like, I don't know.\n\n29:49.520 --> 29:50.520\nOkay.\n\n29:50.520 --> 29:54.520\nI mean, when you hear the first one, you're like, this sounds like the real one.\n\n29:54.520 --> 29:58.520\nIt sounds like it's trying to be clever, but all of them sounded like that.\n\n29:58.520 --> 30:00.520\nI know which one it is.\n\n30:00.520 --> 30:01.520\nOh, do you?\n\n30:01.520 --> 30:03.520\nNo, I mean, I think I know.\n\n30:03.520 --> 30:05.520\nTell me which one you think it is.\n\n30:05.520 --> 30:07.520\nWell, it's the point for him to...\n\n30:07.520 --> 30:09.520\nWell, I want to win.\n\n30:09.520 --> 30:14.520\nYou guys have a minute of discussing it out loud and making your points,\n\n30:14.520 --> 30:16.520\nand then you'll give your final answers.\n\n30:16.520 --> 30:18.520\nOkay, what's your thing?\n\n30:18.520 --> 30:21.520\nBut if I share my reasoning, then they get to piggyback on my intuition.\n\n30:21.520 --> 30:23.520\nYou're right.\n\n30:23.520 --> 30:25.520\nOkay, so we'll go down the line, Spencer.\n\n30:25.520 --> 30:29.520\nI want to finally answer from this guy before I swoop in and snatch it up.\n\n30:29.520 --> 30:30.520\nYou're totally right.\n\n30:30.520 --> 30:33.520\nI want to hear what Dan has to say.\n\n30:33.520 --> 30:35.520\nOkay, but Spencer, in this round, you go first, so you decide.\n\n30:35.520 --> 30:37.520\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\n30:37.520 --> 30:41.520\nI'd like to pick A because, I mean, that sounds right.\n\n30:41.520 --> 30:43.520\nThe Sesame Street...\n\n30:43.520 --> 30:47.520\nYeah, because they value letter economy, right?\n\n30:47.520 --> 30:50.520\nI don't understand the Sesame Street reference.\n\n30:50.520 --> 30:52.520\nThey value letter economy.\n\n30:52.520 --> 30:53.520\nThey do?\n\n30:53.520 --> 30:54.520\nWell, letters are very important.\n\n30:54.520 --> 30:56.520\nWell, letters are their sponsor.\n\n30:56.520 --> 31:00.520\nYou can't just have two.\n\n31:00.520 --> 31:04.520\nI still don't get the connection to Sesame Street, though.\n\n31:04.520 --> 31:13.520\nI understand letters are on the show.\n\n31:13.520 --> 31:14.520\nI don't understand why...\n\n31:14.520 --> 31:15.520\nI don't remember...\n\n31:15.520 --> 31:18.520\nI mean, I've seen them all, and I don't remember somebody coming out\n\n31:18.520 --> 31:21.520\nto never put two rows next to each other.\n\n31:21.520 --> 31:27.520\nI think they just imparted the value of an L to you to the extent that...\n\n31:27.520 --> 31:28.520\nDon't buy it.\n\n31:28.520 --> 31:29.520\nYeah.\n\n31:29.520 --> 31:32.520\nAnyways, I'm going to go with B, and I'll tell you why.\n\n31:32.520 --> 31:35.520\nTo the dad one, two L bill.\n\n31:35.520 --> 31:36.520\nThat's the dad one.\n\n31:36.520 --> 31:38.520\nMy dad, two Ls, whatever.\n\n31:38.520 --> 31:42.520\nI've met a lot of fellas who use their middle name as their first name,\n\n31:42.520 --> 31:45.520\nbecause people who spell their first name differently, etc.\n\n31:45.520 --> 31:48.520\nIt always has to do with a fucked up relationship with their dad.\n\n31:48.520 --> 31:50.520\nWe'll go with that.\n\n31:50.520 --> 31:51.520\nAlright, Rob?\n\n31:51.520 --> 31:56.520\nI'm going to take C, because that's the only one I remembered.\n\n31:56.520 --> 31:58.520\nI enjoy correcting people?\n\n31:58.520 --> 31:59.520\nYes.\n\n31:59.520 --> 32:00.520\nYes.\n\n32:00.520 --> 32:03.520\nThat's exactly the one.\n\n32:03.520 --> 32:09.520\nThe correct answer is A, the Sesame Street answer.\n\n32:09.520 --> 32:10.520\nThat's not fair.\n\n32:10.520 --> 32:12.520\nHe went first.\n\n32:12.520 --> 32:16.520\nWell, everyone would argue he was in the worst position.\n\n32:16.520 --> 32:20.520\nIn this round, Dan will guess first, and then Rob and then Spencer.\n\n32:20.520 --> 32:22.520\nQuestion number two.\n\n32:22.520 --> 32:24.520\nQuestion number two.\n\n32:24.520 --> 32:29.520\nA, I want a Philo T Farnsworth Award for video art.\n\n32:29.520 --> 32:35.520\nB, I want a Philo Teen Farnsworth Award for my work with children's hospitals.\n\n32:35.520 --> 32:40.520\nC, I want a Philo Teen Farnsworth Award for urban planning.\n\n32:40.520 --> 32:42.520\nWhy do you keep saying teen?\n\n32:42.520 --> 32:43.520\nHuh?\n\n32:43.520 --> 32:44.520\nT.\n\n32:44.520 --> 32:45.520\nSorry.\n\n32:45.520 --> 32:46.520\nTeen Farnsworth.\n\n32:46.520 --> 32:49.520\nIt's like a new Nickelodeon cartoon.\n\n32:49.520 --> 32:53.520\nI will go with A, because Philo T Farnsworth's invented television.\n\n32:53.520 --> 32:58.520\nOkay, I think we're learning about how much I know about Philo T Farnsworth.\n\n32:58.520 --> 32:59.520\nSorry.\n\n32:59.520 --> 33:02.520\nOkay, go ahead, Rob.\n\n33:02.520 --> 33:10.520\nI don't know who this Philo guy is, but Bill seems like a kind of a video person.\n\n33:10.520 --> 33:13.520\nI'm also going to go with A.\n\n33:13.520 --> 33:17.520\nBut I thought of that before Harmon said anything.\n\n33:17.520 --> 33:22.520\nAnd I would have got that first one if I had some music to think.\n\n33:22.520 --> 33:27.520\nWhat kind of shit are you running here on?\n\n33:27.520 --> 33:36.520\nI'm going to go with A, because I had a good reason for it.\n\n33:36.520 --> 33:38.520\nAlright, that is correct.\n\n33:38.520 --> 33:39.520\nIt is A video art.\n\n33:39.520 --> 33:40.520\nWe all win.\n\n33:40.520 --> 33:42.520\nWe all tied up.\n\n33:42.520 --> 33:46.520\nT. Farnsworth was reportedly, I don't know if it's Urban Legends, supposedly was thought\n\n33:46.520 --> 33:52.520\nof the idea for television while mowing his lawn, noticed that the rows and columns of\n\n33:52.520 --> 33:57.120\nthe different squares looked at them and kind of came up with the idea of what we would\n\n33:57.120 --> 33:59.520\none day call pixels.\n\n33:59.520 --> 34:00.520\nRight.\n\n34:00.520 --> 34:04.520\nAnd the T is where we get TV from.\n\n34:04.520 --> 34:05.520\nThat's correct.\n\n34:05.520 --> 34:06.520\nThat is correct.\n\n34:06.520 --> 34:09.520\nThe T was taken from his name.\n\n34:09.520 --> 34:14.520\nPhiloTV Farnsworth.\n\n34:14.520 --> 34:17.520\nThe weird thing is the T stands for toilet.\n\n34:17.520 --> 34:20.520\nHis dad always wanted him to invent the toilet.\n\n34:20.520 --> 34:22.520\nFuck that.\n\n34:22.520 --> 34:26.520\nPhilo, I didn't know you could name your kid after something you used to make necklaces\n\n34:26.520 --> 34:27.520\nwith.\n\n34:27.520 --> 34:28.520\nAlright, number three.\n\n34:28.520 --> 34:30.520\nYou can name your kid after everything.\n\n34:30.520 --> 34:33.520\nOh, dirt.\n\n34:33.520 --> 34:34.520\nOr anything.\n\n34:34.520 --> 34:36.520\nBut you can't name them a number.\n\n34:36.520 --> 34:39.520\nSomebody tried to name their kid a number in like Europe somewhere.\n\n34:39.520 --> 34:40.520\nAnd then another kid.\n\n34:40.520 --> 34:41.520\nA cyborg guy.\n\n34:41.520 --> 34:44.520\nSomeone else tried to name their kid Adolf Hitler or something.\n\n34:44.520 --> 34:48.520\nSomebody tried to name their kid God.\n\n34:48.520 --> 34:50.520\nAnd they didn't let that happen?\n\n34:50.520 --> 34:51.520\nNo, no.\n\n34:51.520 --> 34:55.520\nThe judge said, no, that's just for, that name is for the creator.\n\n34:55.520 --> 34:56.520\nIt was totally.\n\n34:56.520 --> 34:57.520\nThat's fucked up.\n\n34:57.520 --> 34:59.520\nThe Kanye West.\n\n34:59.520 --> 35:00.520\nThe Hitler thing.\n\n35:00.520 --> 35:02.520\nI mean, come on, you can't fight City Hall.\n\n35:02.520 --> 35:04.520\nBut, I mean, the God thing.\n\n35:04.520 --> 35:06.520\nWhat's that story?\n\n35:06.520 --> 35:07.520\nWhatever.\n\n35:07.520 --> 35:08.520\nQuestion number three.\n\n35:08.520 --> 35:10.520\nAnd this, Rob, you will answer this first.\n\n35:10.520 --> 35:12.520\nI promise there will be thinking music.\n\n35:12.520 --> 35:13.520\nGood.\n\n35:13.520 --> 35:14.520\nQuestion number three.\n\n35:14.520 --> 35:18.520\nWhen I was in grade school, I won two gold and several silver medals.\n\n35:18.520 --> 35:19.520\nSorry.\n\n35:19.520 --> 35:23.520\nWhen I was in grade school, I won two gold and several silver medals for A.\n\n35:23.520 --> 35:24.520\nScience.\n\n35:24.520 --> 35:25.520\nB.\n\n35:25.520 --> 35:26.520\nSinging.\n\n35:26.520 --> 35:27.520\nC.\n\n35:27.520 --> 35:28.520\nShot put.\n\n35:28.520 --> 35:30.520\nWhat was the second one?\n\n35:30.520 --> 35:31.520\nSinging.\n\n35:31.520 --> 35:32.520\nSinging.\n\n35:32.520 --> 35:33.520\nOh.\n\n35:33.520 --> 35:34.520\nScience.\n\n35:34.520 --> 35:35.520\nB.\n\n35:35.520 --> 35:36.520\nSinging.\n\n35:36.520 --> 35:37.520\nC.\n\n35:37.520 --> 35:38.520\nShot put.\n\n35:38.520 --> 35:39.520\nWaiting.\n\n35:39.520 --> 35:45.520\nWho's giving medals to grade squillers?\n\n35:45.520 --> 35:51.520\nI just love that he specified several silver medals.\n\n35:51.520 --> 35:52.520\nSeveral.\n\n35:52.520 --> 35:54.520\nThey kind, that kind of means a gold.\n\n35:54.520 --> 35:55.520\nYep.\n\n35:55.520 --> 36:00.520\nThat kind of specificity only comes from somebody who is interested in science.\n\n36:00.520 --> 36:01.520\nOnly.\n\n36:01.520 --> 36:03.520\nAll right.\n\n36:03.520 --> 36:04.520\nScience.\n\n36:04.520 --> 36:05.520\nHowever.\n\n36:05.520 --> 36:06.520\nThe music helped.\n\n36:06.520 --> 36:11.520\nI'd like to point out that the score was erroneously reported as tied earlier.\n\n36:11.520 --> 36:12.520\nNo, no.\n\n36:12.520 --> 36:13.520\nI took it back right away.\n\n36:13.520 --> 36:14.520\nI said, no, no, it's not.\n\n36:14.520 --> 36:19.520\nYou have two and the other and Spence and Rob and Dan have one.\n\n36:19.520 --> 36:21.520\nThe game's not over yet, man.\n\n36:21.520 --> 36:22.520\nYou're totally right.\n\n36:22.520 --> 36:23.520\nI said it.\n\n36:23.520 --> 36:24.520\nI took it back.\n\n36:24.520 --> 36:25.520\nJust settle down.\n\n36:25.520 --> 36:27.520\nJust clarifying for the podcast.\n\n36:27.520 --> 36:28.520\nDon't worry.\n\n36:28.520 --> 36:29.520\nIt is not tied.\n\n36:29.520 --> 36:31.520\nSpencer has two.\n\n36:31.520 --> 36:32.520\nDan has one.\n\n36:32.520 --> 36:33.520\nRob has one.\n\n36:33.520 --> 36:37.520\nNow, now Bill seems like the type who can put a shot.\n\n36:37.520 --> 36:38.520\nAll right.\n\n36:38.520 --> 36:41.520\nThat's the whole shot putting.\n\n36:41.520 --> 36:42.520\nOkay.\n\n36:42.520 --> 36:43.520\nAll right.\n\n36:43.520 --> 36:45.520\nSpencer's answer is shot put.\n\n36:45.520 --> 36:46.520\nDan?\n\n36:46.520 --> 36:52.520\nMy instinct is to go away from science because it feels obvious because he's a Harmontown\n\n36:52.520 --> 36:55.520\nattendee and he makes things.\n\n36:55.520 --> 37:00.520\nAnd so it would be weirder for him to be a good singer or a shot putter.\n\n37:00.520 --> 37:04.520\nIf you're in grade school, I mean, that doesn't have any bearing on what you become just because\n\n37:04.520 --> 37:06.520\nhe doesn't look like Jesse Ventura now.\n\n37:06.520 --> 37:11.520\nIt doesn't mean he wasn't the ace shot putter of his grade school.\n\n37:11.520 --> 37:13.520\nI mean, what did it take back then?\n\n37:13.520 --> 37:17.520\nYou have to shoot a heavy ball further than a bunch of fourth graders.\n\n37:17.520 --> 37:22.520\nYou could have been good at anything.\n\n37:22.520 --> 37:32.520\nThe question is, would you think of the word shot put as a comedic third?\n\n37:32.520 --> 37:34.520\nAnd I feel like the answer is yes.\n\n37:34.520 --> 37:37.520\nThere wasn't a comedy one in there.\n\n37:37.520 --> 37:39.520\nThere wasn't one with a zing.\n\n37:39.520 --> 37:41.520\nThat's the zingy one.\n\n37:41.520 --> 37:42.520\nNo business zingy.\n\n37:42.520 --> 37:44.520\nI think that was written by a zinger.\n\n37:44.520 --> 37:46.520\nSo I'm going to go with singing.\n\n37:46.520 --> 37:47.520\nThat is correct.\n\n37:47.520 --> 37:48.520\nYeah!\n\n37:48.520 --> 37:52.520\nWell done.\n\n37:52.520 --> 37:53.520\nThe score is now...\n\n37:53.520 --> 37:56.520\nThis game sucks!\n\n37:56.520 --> 37:59.520\nThe score is Spencer 2, Dan 2, Rob 1.\n\n37:59.520 --> 38:01.520\nFuck off!\n\n38:01.520 --> 38:03.520\nAll right.\n\n38:03.520 --> 38:06.520\nSpencer will start the answering in this round.\n\n38:06.520 --> 38:07.520\nI hate games.\n\n38:07.520 --> 38:10.520\nI can't believe you brought me up for the game, man.\n\n38:10.520 --> 38:13.520\nAfter this, we're going to play G&D, so get ready.\n\n38:13.520 --> 38:14.520\nThat's a different kind.\n\n38:14.520 --> 38:15.520\nYou can't lose at that.\n\n38:15.520 --> 38:17.520\nOh, you can.\n\n38:17.520 --> 38:22.520\nWe've been doing it for months.\n\n38:22.520 --> 38:24.520\nQuestion number four.\n\n38:24.520 --> 38:26.520\nI always lose.\n\n38:26.520 --> 38:28.520\nAll right, go ahead.\n\n38:28.520 --> 38:30.520\nBill was in marching band.\n\n38:30.520 --> 38:31.520\nReally?\n\n38:31.520 --> 38:34.520\nTrue.\n\n38:34.520 --> 38:35.520\nSo was I, Bill.\n\n38:35.520 --> 38:38.520\nHe played one of these three instruments.\n\n38:38.520 --> 38:42.520\nHeard strings.\n\n38:42.520 --> 38:44.520\nA, drum.\n\n38:44.520 --> 38:46.520\nB, oboe.\n\n38:46.520 --> 38:50.520\nC, alto sax.\n\n38:50.520 --> 38:52.520\nA, drum.\n\n38:52.520 --> 38:54.520\nB, oboe.\n\n38:54.520 --> 39:00.520\nC, alto sax.\n\n39:00.520 --> 39:02.520\nWho's first?\n\n39:02.520 --> 39:03.520\nSpencer is first.\n\n39:03.520 --> 39:07.520\nI just, yeah, oboe.\n\n39:07.520 --> 39:08.520\nWhat's your reasoning?\n\n39:08.520 --> 39:09.520\nBecause this is a bad question.\n\n39:09.520 --> 39:10.520\nI'm really arbitrary.\n\n39:10.520 --> 39:14.520\nI just really wanted to say oboe.\n\n39:14.520 --> 39:15.520\nAll right, oboe.\n\n39:15.520 --> 39:16.520\nIt's fun.\n\n39:16.520 --> 39:17.520\nI don't think it's arbitrary at all.\n\n39:17.520 --> 39:22.520\nI think that Bill is clearly a sax man because he looked at the\n\n39:22.520 --> 39:26.520\nmarching band as an opportunity to, yeah, it's a sexy instrument.\n\n39:26.520 --> 39:29.520\nIt's a Bill Clinton instrument.\n\n39:29.520 --> 39:32.520\nHe wanted to, he saw himself sitting in the window.\n\n39:32.520 --> 39:36.520\nHe's like, man, I have all this aptitude for science and music,\n\n39:36.520 --> 39:41.520\nbut I'm never going to be like a motley crew.\n\n39:41.520 --> 39:46.520\nI just, I also value the rule of law.\n\n39:46.520 --> 39:48.520\nAll right.\n\n39:48.520 --> 39:53.520\nSo what instrument gets pussy without breaking the law?\n\n39:53.520 --> 39:54.520\nThe answer is sax.\n\n39:54.520 --> 39:55.520\nI know, I know, I know.\n\n39:55.520 --> 39:56.520\nI know what you're going to say.\n\n39:56.520 --> 39:59.520\nLet them all answer, and I'll throw out a fact,\n\n39:59.520 --> 40:02.520\nand then they can revise their answer.\n\n40:02.520 --> 40:03.520\nOh, shit.\n\n40:03.520 --> 40:04.520\nPlease.\n\n40:04.520 --> 40:05.520\nI love you.\n\n40:05.520 --> 40:09.520\nThis is why I didn't want you on the stage.\n\n40:09.520 --> 40:11.520\nWe'll bring you up for a follow-up.\n\n40:11.520 --> 40:13.520\nSo if you would like a notepad or something,\n\n40:13.520 --> 40:14.520\nso you can remember these.\n\n40:14.520 --> 40:15.520\nOkay.\n\n40:15.520 --> 40:16.520\nThat sounded me.\n\n40:16.520 --> 40:17.520\nNo, it didn't.\n\n40:17.520 --> 40:18.520\nI'm in my head.\n\n40:18.520 --> 40:19.520\nSorry.\n\n40:19.520 --> 40:20.520\nOkay.\n\n40:20.520 --> 40:26.520\nSo you were going with a sax, sexy sax,\n\n40:26.520 --> 40:28.520\nwhich is like making out with somebody.\n\n40:28.520 --> 40:29.520\nYeah.\n\n40:29.520 --> 40:30.520\nYeah.\n\n40:30.520 --> 40:35.520\nEspecially when you're silhouetted in a window in an 80s set.\n\n40:35.520 --> 40:36.520\nYes.\n\n40:36.520 --> 40:54.520\nDan, would you do that as Rob's thinking music?\n\n40:54.520 --> 40:55.520\nHe just did.\n\n40:55.520 --> 40:56.520\nHe just did.\n\n40:56.520 --> 40:57.520\nOkay.\n\n40:57.520 --> 40:58.520\nHe just did.\n\n40:58.520 --> 41:05.520\nBill with 1L, you seem to me as somebody who when you were younger had longer hair.\n\n41:05.520 --> 41:06.520\nI need a drummer.\n\n41:06.520 --> 41:07.520\nOh.\n\n41:07.520 --> 41:11.520\nThat is correct.\n\n41:11.520 --> 41:13.520\nBreed it.\n\n41:13.520 --> 41:15.520\nBreed it.\n\n41:15.520 --> 41:16.520\nBreed it.\n\n41:16.520 --> 41:17.520\nYou know what?\n\n41:17.520 --> 41:18.520\nIt didn't occur to me.\n\n41:18.520 --> 41:19.520\nDrums are pretty sexy too.\n\n41:19.520 --> 41:22.520\nI was just picturing the marching band drum,\n\n41:22.520 --> 41:24.520\nthe one that's just tethered to your torso\n\n41:24.520 --> 41:26.520\nand you're like an energizer bunny.\n\n41:26.520 --> 41:27.520\nAll right.\n\n41:27.520 --> 41:28.520\nSexy.\n\n41:28.520 --> 41:29.520\nBut it's marching band.\n\n41:29.520 --> 41:30.520\nYou played a drum.\n\n41:30.520 --> 41:31.520\nNever mind.\n\n41:31.520 --> 41:32.360\nfor a minute.\n\n41:32.360 --> 41:34.640\nNo, you were, you were pretty good, right?\n\n41:35.600 --> 41:37.960\nYeah, come on, all right.\n\n41:37.960 --> 41:41.280\nHe was specifically fifth bass drum.\n\n41:41.280 --> 41:43.400\nSo I don't know, does that mean fifth chair?\n\n41:43.400 --> 41:44.640\nOr is that a specific?\n\n41:44.640 --> 41:45.720\nOh, the biggest bass drum.\n\n41:45.720 --> 41:47.320\nThe biggest one, Aaron.\n\n41:47.320 --> 41:52.640\nAll right, question number five.\n\n41:52.640 --> 41:54.600\nI was last chair trumpet.\n\n41:54.600 --> 42:00.320\nIn a three-way with Vince Vaughn.\n\n42:00.320 --> 42:04.080\nIt's not even a musical term.\n\n42:04.080 --> 42:07.360\nIt's just before I came here.\n\n42:07.360 --> 42:12.640\nAll right, this question includes four quotes.\n\n42:12.640 --> 42:15.680\nThis is a four-option answer.\n\n42:15.680 --> 42:18.960\nAnd we're going to start with Dan in the answering.\n\n42:18.960 --> 42:22.320\nA, I've had migraines since I was 16.\n\n42:22.320 --> 42:26.320\nB, I've had parakeets since I was 16.\n\n42:26.320 --> 42:29.360\nC, I've had arthritis since I was 16.\n\n42:29.360 --> 42:31.760\nD, I've had lizards since I was 16.\n\n42:39.760 --> 42:42.560\nYou're so proud of yourself for creating perfectly equidistant\n\n42:42.560 --> 42:43.440\npossibilities.\n\n42:43.440 --> 42:47.160\nYeah, exactly.\n\n42:47.160 --> 42:48.720\nOnly one of those is true.\n\n42:48.720 --> 42:49.200\nYeah.\n\n42:49.200 --> 42:51.480\nLizards, parakeets, arthritis, or migraines.\n\n42:51.480 --> 42:53.600\nYep, migraines, paracretes.\n\n42:53.600 --> 42:55.760\nDid you say this was a lightning round?\n\n42:55.760 --> 42:57.320\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n42:57.320 --> 42:59.440\nWe have four choices as opposed to three.\n\n42:59.440 --> 43:02.280\nOh, oh, oh, it's the molasses round.\n\n43:05.080 --> 43:05.720\nGod damn it.\n\n43:05.720 --> 43:08.840\nOK, parakeets, two contained.\n\n43:08.840 --> 43:11.440\nHe would look at them.\n\n43:11.440 --> 43:15.920\nThe throbbing heart of a freeman beats Bill's chest.\n\n43:15.920 --> 43:22.280\nThat's why he works with wood and beef, lizards.\n\n43:22.280 --> 43:23.440\nThere's the science angle.\n\n43:23.440 --> 43:26.520\nOh, lizards are supposed to be gross, but I'm a scientist.\n\n43:26.520 --> 43:29.960\nI value them because I'm scientific.\n\n43:29.960 --> 43:31.520\nMigraines and arthritis.\n\n43:31.520 --> 43:37.680\nArthritis, he wouldn't do all that handiwork, migraines.\n\n43:37.680 --> 43:39.040\nAll right, Rob.\n\n43:39.040 --> 43:42.000\nLizards.\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:46.480\nFor the same reasons that Dan said.\n\n43:46.480 --> 43:48.240\nSpencer?\n\n43:48.240 --> 43:51.360\nI don't want to live in a world where Bill had parakeets.\n\n43:59.040 --> 44:02.160\nHe goes home at night and tells him about how did\n\n44:02.160 --> 44:06.640\nHarmontown go tonight, Professor Feathers?\n\n44:06.640 --> 44:08.480\nProfessor Feathers.\n\n44:08.480 --> 44:10.120\nBecause he's an expert.\n\n44:10.120 --> 44:10.880\nYeah.\n\n44:10.880 --> 44:15.440\nWhat happened to you in that line, man?\n\n44:15.440 --> 44:19.360\nOh, man, after that line, I went to Roscoe's chicken\n\n44:19.360 --> 44:23.760\nand waffles, and I was texting on my cell phone.\n\n44:23.760 --> 44:26.040\nAnd the way I was texting, I don't know,\n\n44:26.040 --> 44:28.960\nbut it was like it lined up some pathways in my brain,\n\n44:28.960 --> 44:32.840\nand I felt like I was a living god for that moment.\n\n44:32.840 --> 44:36.440\nLike high on all of the drugs that your brain makes itself.\n\n44:36.440 --> 44:38.680\nLike I was just like, ugh.\n\n44:38.680 --> 44:41.880\nLike I could just like pass through the walls.\n\n44:41.880 --> 44:42.960\nSo are you saying lizards?\n\n44:42.960 --> 44:46.640\nShoot laser beams at those ads.\n\n44:46.640 --> 44:48.680\nJust because of sleep deprivation?\n\n44:48.680 --> 44:51.160\nThe combination of that and success,\n\n44:51.160 --> 44:55.440\nand I'm sure you know, who knows.\n\n44:55.440 --> 44:57.480\nWhat I'm trying to say is that if Bill actually\n\n44:57.480 --> 44:59.800\ndid have parakeets, then our relationship\n\n44:59.800 --> 45:01.600\nwill fundamentally change from here on.\n\n45:05.280 --> 45:07.160\nI'm going to pick migraines, because I\n\n45:07.160 --> 45:09.560\nfeel like I got migraines around that age,\n\n45:09.560 --> 45:12.200\nand that seems like something that crops up at 16.\n\n45:12.200 --> 45:13.320\nAround Bill's age?\n\n45:13.320 --> 45:15.440\nOh, since 16, he said.\n\n45:15.440 --> 45:16.920\nWell, Spencer is correct.\n\n45:16.920 --> 45:17.760\nAnd Dan.\n\n45:17.760 --> 45:18.840\nIt is, and Dan.\n\n45:18.840 --> 45:20.040\nSorry, Spencer and Dan are correct.\n\n45:20.040 --> 45:22.320\nIt was migraines, migraines.\n\n45:22.320 --> 45:24.880\nThe score is Spencer 3, Dan 3, Rob.\n\n45:24.880 --> 45:28.720\nWe know, we know, we know, we know what the score is.\n\n45:32.160 --> 45:33.640\nWhat's Rob's score?\n\n45:33.640 --> 45:36.240\nShut up, shut up.\n\n45:36.240 --> 45:38.480\nRob is in last place with two.\n\n45:38.480 --> 45:39.400\nOh, shut up.\n\n45:39.400 --> 45:40.840\nI was just trying to play it, yeah.\n\n45:40.840 --> 45:43.960\nNumber six, three quotes.\n\n45:43.960 --> 45:45.280\nI have been bungee jumping.\n\n45:45.280 --> 45:47.160\nI have been skydiving.\n\n45:47.160 --> 45:49.240\nI have not been on an airplane.\n\n45:49.240 --> 45:51.840\nA, I have been bungee jumping.\n\n45:51.840 --> 45:53.600\nB, I have been skydiving.\n\n45:53.600 --> 45:57.640\nC, I have not been on an airplane.\n\n45:57.640 --> 45:59.200\nWe were going to start with this Rob.\n\n45:59.200 --> 46:02.960\nWe were going to start with Rob.\n\n46:02.960 --> 46:04.960\nMusic.\n\n46:04.960 --> 46:08.960\nOK.\n\n46:08.960 --> 46:13.280\nOh god, I don't know how to do this.\n\n46:13.280 --> 46:14.560\nOK, the music's fucking with me.\n\n46:14.560 --> 46:15.360\nOK, get rid of it.\n\n46:19.360 --> 46:21.240\nBungee jumping, skydiving.\n\n46:21.240 --> 46:22.280\nNever been on a plane.\n\n46:22.280 --> 46:23.680\nSkydiving.\n\n46:23.680 --> 46:25.280\nAll right, Spencer?\n\n46:25.280 --> 46:27.520\nI'm going to pick skydiving.\n\n46:27.520 --> 46:28.400\nOK, Dan.\n\n46:28.400 --> 46:30.320\nAm I the only one?\n\n46:30.320 --> 46:32.440\nIf C is correct, then B can't be.\n\n46:32.440 --> 46:37.920\nIf he was never on a plane, he could, unless you pulled\n\n46:37.920 --> 46:41.800\na bungee cord really tight and flew him into the air,\n\n46:41.800 --> 46:43.280\nI don't think he could ever skydive\n\n46:43.280 --> 46:45.760\nwithout having been on a plane, which means that.\n\n46:45.760 --> 46:47.960\nB was right, then C couldn't be.\n\n46:47.960 --> 46:50.200\nAnd since B and C have a relationship with each other,\n\n46:50.200 --> 46:53.400\nthen I'm going to go with A. He's been bungee jumping.\n\n46:53.400 --> 46:56.400\nOK, the correct answer is B, skydiving.\n\n46:56.400 --> 46:56.900\nHa!\n\n46:56.900 --> 46:57.900\nYeah!\n\n47:01.380 --> 47:04.340\nSpencer's and Lee, Dan, and Rob are tied.\n\n47:04.340 --> 47:06.020\nAgain!\n\n47:06.020 --> 47:08.020\nQuestion number seven.\n\n47:08.020 --> 47:10.420\nThis is the ice cream question.\n\n47:10.420 --> 47:12.980\nWe get ice cream?\n\n47:12.980 --> 47:14.900\nAll the ice cream you want.\n\n47:14.900 --> 47:17.420\nI once won a year's supply of ice cream,\n\n47:17.420 --> 47:24.020\nand I always chose bubblegum, because A, it's a dessert\n\n47:24.020 --> 47:29.460\nand an activity, B, I actually thought\n\n47:29.460 --> 47:36.460\nit was cotton candy flavored, C, I knew my dad wouldn't eat it,\n\n47:36.460 --> 47:38.820\nA, it's a dessert and an activity,\n\n47:38.820 --> 47:40.900\nB, I actually thought it was cotton candy flavored,\n\n47:40.900 --> 47:44.300\nC, I knew my dad wouldn't eat it.\n\n47:44.300 --> 47:54.300\nD, I make poor life decisions.\n\n47:54.300 --> 47:56.300\nWho's going first?\n\n47:56.300 --> 47:57.300\nWho's going this round?\n\n47:57.300 --> 47:58.300\nWho starts this round?\n\n47:58.300 --> 48:00.020\nSpencer, Spencer, it's you.\n\n48:00.020 --> 48:03.060\nI'm going to go with B for whatever reason.\n\n48:03.060 --> 48:05.100\nYou thought it, he actually thought it was cotton candy\n\n48:05.100 --> 48:05.340\nflavored.\n\n48:05.340 --> 48:05.780\nSure.\n\n48:05.780 --> 48:06.780\nOK, Dan?\n\n48:06.780 --> 48:09.540\nI'll go with C, because of my continuing fixation\n\n48:09.540 --> 48:11.380\non fathers.\n\n48:11.380 --> 48:11.900\nAll right.\n\n48:11.900 --> 48:14.380\nI'm going to go with A, because it is true.\n\n48:14.380 --> 48:19.380\nIt's a dessert and an activity.\n\n48:19.380 --> 48:24.660\nThe correct answer is C, I knew my dad wouldn't eat it.\n\n48:24.660 --> 48:28.140\nThat brings Rob back to last place.\n\n48:28.140 --> 48:32.180\nSpencer and Dan tied for first.\n\n48:32.180 --> 48:34.300\nAll right, here we go.\n\n48:34.300 --> 48:36.780\nA, I have a, sorry?\n\n48:36.780 --> 48:40.300\nNo, I was cursing this game.\n\n48:40.300 --> 48:43.460\nA, I have a bunch of magnets on my fridge.\n\n48:43.460 --> 48:46.340\nB, I have two sewing kits.\n\n48:46.340 --> 48:51.420\nC, I have 455 PEZ dispensers.\n\n48:51.420 --> 48:54.140\nA, I have a bunch of magnets on my fridge.\n\n48:54.140 --> 48:56.180\nB, I have two sewing kits.\n\n48:56.180 --> 49:00.420\nC, I have 455 PEZ dispensers.\n\n49:00.420 --> 49:02.060\nWe're going to start with Dan.\n\n49:02.060 --> 49:07.220\nOK, I keep going to, you asked him to email a bunch of facts\n\n49:07.220 --> 49:08.180\nabout himself.\n\n49:08.180 --> 49:11.340\nSo he might have, during a falter, might have gone,\n\n49:11.340 --> 49:13.100\nI don't know, I have a bunch of magnets on my fridge.\n\n49:13.100 --> 49:15.020\nWhat else?\n\n49:15.020 --> 49:17.300\nLike, maybe.\n\n49:17.300 --> 49:20.740\nBecause that 455 PEZ dispensers thing,\n\n49:20.740 --> 49:23.260\nthat seems like a make-up up.\n\n49:23.260 --> 49:26.020\nAnd the, what's the other one?\n\n49:26.020 --> 49:26.820\nTwo sewing kits.\n\n49:26.820 --> 49:28.580\nTwo sewing kits.\n\n49:28.580 --> 49:31.780\nThat's pretty specific.\n\n49:31.780 --> 49:34.060\nI'm going to go with sewing kits.\n\n49:34.060 --> 49:35.300\nOK, Rob?\n\n49:35.300 --> 49:36.740\nI'm also going to go with sewing kits,\n\n49:36.740 --> 49:39.700\nbut I thought of it before Dan said anything.\n\n49:39.700 --> 49:42.860\nBecause he works with his hands and stuff.\n\n49:42.860 --> 49:43.860\nYeah.\n\n49:43.860 --> 49:44.820\nYou did a really good job.\n\n49:48.020 --> 49:48.520\nThank you.\n\n49:48.520 --> 49:51.260\nThat's all I wanted tonight.\n\n49:51.260 --> 49:53.260\nWhat, I'm going to go with sewing kits,\n\n49:53.260 --> 49:56.540\nbecause that's the lowest stakes for me.\n\n49:56.540 --> 49:58.340\nSo it doesn't matter what the answer is,\n\n49:58.340 --> 49:59.340\nthis round is to watch.\n\n49:59.340 --> 50:00.700\nHow come this is not important to you?\n\n50:00.700 --> 50:01.180\nIt is.\n\n50:01.180 --> 50:02.940\nIt's just so important to me.\n\n50:02.940 --> 50:03.860\nYou don't care.\n\n50:03.860 --> 50:05.180\nI'm playing it like a game.\n\n50:05.180 --> 50:06.100\nAnd you're winning.\n\n50:06.100 --> 50:06.660\nYeah, that's why.\n\n50:06.660 --> 50:09.380\nThe correct answer is, I have a bunch of magnets\n\n50:09.380 --> 50:10.980\non my fridge, is the correct answer.\n\n50:10.980 --> 50:11.740\nAll right, moving on.\n\n50:11.740 --> 50:12.380\nWe're almost done.\n\n50:12.380 --> 50:12.880\nStupid.\n\n50:15.660 --> 50:16.660\nSecond to last question.\n\n50:16.660 --> 50:19.900\nI love this game, Erin.\n\n50:19.900 --> 50:20.740\nThanks, Spencer.\n\n50:20.740 --> 50:22.220\nYeah, balanced viewpoints.\n\n50:22.220 --> 50:23.940\nAre you starting to rethink your position\n\n50:23.940 --> 50:25.060\non Dungeons and Dragons?\n\n50:25.060 --> 50:28.380\nDo you think this is a better game?\n\n50:28.380 --> 50:31.140\nI'm definitely considering how the work audience member\n\n50:31.140 --> 50:32.900\ntrivia into my encounters.\n\n50:32.900 --> 50:33.500\nYeah.\n\n50:33.500 --> 50:39.660\nI'm wondering if there could be a whole convention for this.\n\n50:39.660 --> 50:41.100\nI'm sure.\n\n50:41.100 --> 50:42.780\nAll right, question number nine.\n\n50:42.780 --> 50:45.060\nI was in the talent show in the fifth grade.\n\n50:45.060 --> 50:51.500\nAnd I sang, A, don't rain on my parade, B,\n\n50:51.500 --> 50:54.900\nDad, don't hit me.\n\n50:54.900 --> 51:01.180\nAn original piece by B, Fiddler on the Roof,\n\n51:01.180 --> 51:03.580\nC, luck be a lady.\n\n51:03.580 --> 51:04.980\nThat's a good one.\n\n51:04.980 --> 51:07.900\nA, don't rain on my parade, B, Fiddler on the Roof,\n\n51:07.900 --> 51:09.980\nC, luck be a lady.\n\n51:09.980 --> 51:11.900\nWhat's don't rain on my parade?\n\n51:11.900 --> 51:13.660\nI don't know what that is.\n\n51:13.660 --> 51:16.020\nDon't tell me not to fight.\n\n51:16.020 --> 51:17.260\nIt's from Funny Girl.\n\n51:17.260 --> 51:17.980\nIt's from what?\n\n51:17.980 --> 51:19.500\nIt's from Funny Girl.\n\n51:19.500 --> 51:20.860\nIt's a barber's tray sand.\n\n51:20.860 --> 51:22.300\nOK, so you put that one in there.\n\n51:22.300 --> 51:22.800\nOK.\n\n51:22.800 --> 51:28.800\nYeah.\n\n51:28.800 --> 51:32.120\nBut all of these songs are very popular songs.\n\n51:36.600 --> 51:39.800\nI'm going to live it.\n\n51:39.800 --> 51:41.000\nI'm not going to do much of it.\n\n51:41.000 --> 51:44.360\nI would like to hear two bars of Fiddler on the Roof, please.\n\n51:44.360 --> 51:45.200\nOr thinking music.\n\n51:45.200 --> 51:47.120\nLike a Fiddler on the Roof.\n\n51:47.120 --> 51:48.520\nI mean, it's not actually a song.\n\n51:48.520 --> 51:49.520\nAll right.\n\n51:49.520 --> 51:52.280\nWell, I will.\n\n51:52.280 --> 51:56.600\nMay God bless and protect us.\n\n51:56.600 --> 51:57.760\nSo that's another made-up one.\n\n52:01.760 --> 52:02.760\nWho's going?\n\n52:02.760 --> 52:03.520\nOh, sorry.\n\n52:03.520 --> 52:04.040\nRob is starting.\n\n52:04.040 --> 52:05.840\nRob is starting, correct?\n\n52:05.840 --> 52:06.520\nYes, thank you.\n\n52:06.520 --> 52:07.160\nSorry.\n\n52:07.160 --> 52:10.480\nIt's your game.\n\n52:10.480 --> 52:12.600\nLet me say Fiddler on the Roof's a classic.\n\n52:12.600 --> 52:15.640\nBut luck be a lady is a crowd pleaser.\n\n52:15.640 --> 52:17.400\nSo I'm going to say luck be a lady.\n\n52:17.400 --> 52:17.760\nOK.\n\n52:17.760 --> 52:23.040\nThat's a drummer's song.\n\n52:23.040 --> 52:25.520\nThey just did that at the Emmys tonight.\n\n52:25.520 --> 52:26.360\nLuck be a lady.\n\n52:26.360 --> 52:27.400\nThey sure did.\n\n52:27.400 --> 52:28.360\nWhoa.\n\n52:28.360 --> 52:29.960\nWow.\n\n52:29.960 --> 52:31.000\nHow did you know that?\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:35.240\nI was on while I was sleeping.\n\n52:35.240 --> 52:38.400\nI woke up to Don Cheadle, like doing this weird monologue.\n\n52:38.400 --> 52:39.920\nI had a half a fever dream.\n\n52:39.920 --> 52:41.520\nDon Cheadle's voice was in my ear\n\n52:41.520 --> 52:44.240\ntalking about how television is an amazing thing\n\n52:44.240 --> 52:46.680\nbecause Kennedy got his brains blown out.\n\n52:46.680 --> 52:48.840\nTV was there for that.\n\n52:48.840 --> 52:50.800\nAnd then a couple weeks later, the Beatles\n\n52:50.800 --> 52:54.000\nmade it OK to laugh again.\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:54.960\nHere's Carrie Underwood.\n\n52:54.960 --> 52:57.440\nAnd I was like, what the fuck is happening?\n\n52:57.440 --> 52:58.720\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n52:58.720 --> 53:01.880\nIt's just a piece of technology that has enslaved all of us.\n\n53:01.880 --> 53:04.080\nThere's not a cultural icon.\n\n53:04.080 --> 53:05.600\nAh, television.\n\n53:05.600 --> 53:06.600\nAh, phylo TV.\n\n53:06.600 --> 53:08.880\nWhen Kennedy died, when Beatles like, yeah,\n\n53:08.880 --> 53:11.440\nand everything else, what are you talking about?\n\n53:11.440 --> 53:12.680\nI was like, ah, oxygen.\n\n53:12.680 --> 53:16.200\nKennedy breathed it for his last breath.\n\n53:16.200 --> 53:20.800\nThen the Beatles exhaled it during, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n53:20.800 --> 53:22.560\nHere's Carrie Underwood.\n\n53:22.560 --> 53:24.120\nYou went out some more.\n\n53:24.120 --> 53:25.480\nEnjoy your TV.\n\n53:25.480 --> 53:26.280\nIt's not dying.\n\n53:31.280 --> 53:32.760\nGrand Theft Who?\n\n53:32.760 --> 53:33.600\nEnjoy the Emmys.\n\n53:37.600 --> 53:40.160\nIt was just weird to wake up to that, that's all.\n\n53:40.160 --> 53:41.640\nDon Cheadle's voice in my ear.\n\n53:41.640 --> 53:43.720\nDo you know how you make it part of your dream\n\n53:43.720 --> 53:44.760\nwhen you hear stuff?\n\n53:44.760 --> 53:45.320\nAbsolutely.\n\n53:45.320 --> 53:47.920\nSo no.\n\n53:47.920 --> 53:48.560\nYou don't know?\n\n53:48.560 --> 53:49.800\nOh.\n\n53:49.800 --> 53:51.840\nRob's guess is Luck Be a Lady, Spencer?\n\n53:51.840 --> 53:54.000\nYeah, I'm going to go with Luck Be a Lady.\n\n53:54.000 --> 53:56.680\nLuck Be a Lady, because there's the thing, Fiddler on the Roof.\n\n53:56.680 --> 53:58.800\nI don't even know that that's a song.\n\n53:58.800 --> 53:59.760\nThat's the correct answer.\n\n53:59.760 --> 54:02.120\nIt is Fiddler on the Roof.\n\n54:02.120 --> 54:05.680\nMaybe it means the entire musical.\n\n54:05.680 --> 54:09.200\nAll right, final question, final question.\n\n54:09.200 --> 54:10.120\nThe score.\n\n54:10.120 --> 54:12.520\nSo we all lose a point?\n\n54:12.520 --> 54:13.720\nNo, that doesn't help me.\n\n54:13.720 --> 54:15.960\nThat is it, no, that's that.\n\n54:15.960 --> 54:18.280\nIt'd be exactly where we are.\n\n54:18.280 --> 54:20.760\nThis round will determine whether you're worse than us\n\n54:20.760 --> 54:22.080\nor just equal.\n\n54:25.560 --> 54:26.400\nThat's it.\n\n54:26.400 --> 54:28.200\nYou have no chance of being superior.\n\n54:28.200 --> 54:31.440\nEvery game I've ever played, go ahead, do it.\n\n54:31.440 --> 54:33.520\nThat's why you invited me up here, Erin.\n\n54:36.800 --> 54:41.760\nAll right, this next round is unique to the other rounds.\n\n54:41.760 --> 54:45.520\nAs we stand, Spencer has four, Dan has four, Rob has three.\n\n54:45.520 --> 54:47.040\nYes, we.\n\n54:47.040 --> 54:52.800\nFour, you're unclear at home, four is more than three.\n\n54:52.800 --> 54:57.160\nIn this last round, there are many different options\n\n54:57.160 --> 54:58.040\nfor the correct answer.\n\n54:58.040 --> 55:00.800\nWe'll go around first.\n\n55:00.800 --> 55:04.320\nIf you choose the correct answer in the first round,\n\n55:04.320 --> 55:08.840\nyou'll get two points, meaning that anyone who guesses us\n\n55:08.840 --> 55:13.160\ncorrectly wins a round, and then we'll just do that.\n\n55:13.160 --> 55:15.480\nOK.\n\n55:15.480 --> 55:18.360\nFinal round, you'll see.\n\n55:18.360 --> 55:20.120\nFinal round.\n\n55:20.120 --> 55:23.520\nBasically, it's so close whoever guesses this first wins,\n\n55:23.520 --> 55:24.960\nand this is going to start with Spencer.\n\n55:24.960 --> 55:26.760\nWait, do we have to chime in?\n\n55:26.760 --> 55:30.120\nNo, no, no, we'll still do the round robin thing,\n\n55:30.120 --> 55:33.000\nand then I'll say the correct answer after the three.\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:33.600\nHere we go.\n\n55:33.600 --> 55:35.840\nThe straight line.\n\n55:35.840 --> 55:36.800\nYeah, sorry.\n\n55:36.800 --> 55:39.600\nIt's not a round robin at all, that refers to a very specific\n\n55:39.600 --> 55:42.080\nthing.\n\n55:42.080 --> 55:44.320\nOK.\n\n55:44.320 --> 55:50.240\nUntil I took up woodwork, I made music in my spare time.\n\n55:50.240 --> 55:54.280\nI have an album I released on Amazon.\n\n55:54.280 --> 55:55.160\nWait, are these?\n\n55:55.160 --> 55:56.680\nThis is a quote, and now I'm going\n\n55:56.680 --> 56:01.080\nto list several different names of

title.\n\n01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.920\nNow he's just beef bill.\n\n01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.920\nYeah, he said in his email that he\n\n01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:06.440\nresented the beef fungus bill nickname.\n\n01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:08.440\nWell, I think Belle knew that.\n\n01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:11.400\nYeah, he's never been coy about not liking being\n\n01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:15.880\ncalled beef fungus bill, nor do we care.\n\n01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:18.640\nI got to say, getting a nickname.\n\n01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:23.520\nI'm sure the Hamburglar wants to be called Senator.\n\n01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.320\nBut you know what?\n\n01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:25.760\nMotherfucker stole a burger.\n\n01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:33.000\nAin't no frat guy.\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.960\nThese are dance five minutes for a night at the Apollo.\n\n01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:41.200\nIt's Senator Rob Straub, all right.\n\n01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.600\nI was going to say Strom Thurmond.\n\n01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:43.920\nThat was the senator in my head.\n\n01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.840\nWho's probably still alive, Strom Thurmond.\n\n01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.800\nNo, he's finally got it.\n\n01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:57.400\nBut if you would like to have 45 minutes of Harmontown\n\n01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:00.720\ndedicated to you, simply send a self-addressed stamped\n\n01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:05.040\nenvelope to Nowhere, and then come to the show every day,\n\n01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:08.440\nevery week for like a year.\n\n01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.400\nI'm just saying, it was a good segment.\n\n01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:14.920\nAnd some people might be wondering, who's Bill?\n\n01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:16.120\nHe comes all the time.\n\n01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:19.840\nI've been wondering something for a very long time.\n\n01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.880\nAnd now that I'm in the Comptroller seat,\n\n01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:23.520\nI feel like I can explore it.\n\n01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.720\nYou see the first and second row all the time.\n\n01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.120\nI'm so curious, who's in the back?\n\n01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.840\nCan we talk to somebody in the back for a moment?\n\n01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:34.960\nThose are the people that are just standard customers.\n\n01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:37.720\nOften the answer is nobody, because they come to the first\n\n01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:41.160\nhalf of the show, and they go, fuck this.\n\n01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:44.600\nAll right, sorry, guys.\n\n01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:48.920\nWell, is there anybody that's usually in the back?\n\n01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:49.920\nOh, does it?\n\n01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.600\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.000\nCome on down.\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000\nAre you?\n\n01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.520\nSomeone sadly said there's.\n\n01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:56.320\nOh, there's BJ.\n\n01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:56.800\nOK.\n\n01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.240\nI thought I saw some cat ears.\n\n01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:00.920\nAll right, here comes Back Lady.\n\n01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.360\nBack Lady.\n\n01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.760\nHere, come on up.\n\n01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:07.520\nBack be a lady tonight.\n\n01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.960\nI'm also one of the interns, but I\n\n01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:12.520\nwas a regular for Harmontown before I became an intern,\n\n01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:13.840\nso I lurk in the back.\n\n01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:15.840\nYes, and we've met before, but what was your name again?\n\n01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:16.400\nKelly.\n\n01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.640\nKelly, Kelly everybody.\n\n01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.520\nOK.\n\n01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.880\nSo what's it like back there?\n\n01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:26.960\nIt's dark, and it's hard, because when people stand,\n\n01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.960\nbecause we have to sit at the concession stand.\n\n01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:31.840\nSo sometimes when people stand in that general area,\n\n01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:34.240\nall of a sudden it's like, OK, can't see the stage.\n\n01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:37.640\nSo you get the actual podcast feeling,\n\n01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.120\nbecause all you can do is listen to it.\n\n01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:41.600\nBut then when something crazy visually happens,\n\n01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:45.000\nand it's like, OK, now I know how the listeners feel.\n\n01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.920\nI can't see anything.\n\n01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:49.120\nYou have to go to the hashtag on Instagram.\n\n01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:51.200\nYeah, that's what I do.\n\n01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.560\nWhen did you just move to LA?\n\n01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:57.640\nActually, October 9th will be my one-year anniversary.\n\n01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:59.520\nSo sort of.\n\n01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.800\nAre your dreams coming true?\n\n01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:04.920\nYou're an intern, a nerdist at Meltdown.\n\n01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:07.320\nThat's pretty much it.\n\n01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.080\nBut I mean, I don't know.\n\n01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:13.200\nI didn't think that a year living here, I'd be unemployed.\n\n01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.680\nBut hooray, I'm in LA.\n\n01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.160\nYou thought you'd be.\n\n01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.800\nI thought I'd just be employed somewhere.\n\n01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:19.720\nIt's like an assistant.\n\n01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:21.440\nWhat is your dream?\n\n01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:22.880\nI want to write for TV.\n\n01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:23.880\nMm-hmm.\n\n01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:24.880\nThat's a good one.\n\n01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:25.880\nThat's awesome.\n\n01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:26.880\nYeah.\n\n01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:30.640\nSo preferably TV comedies, so.\n\n01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:31.140\nCool.\n\n01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:32.400\nThe Emmys were tonight.\n\n01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:32.880\nI know.\n\n01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.920\nWe were actually just talking about them,\n\n01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:38.000\nbecause we were looking on the CNN,\n\n01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.200\nbecause it popped up that Breaking Bad One for Best Drama,\n\n01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:46.520\nif nobody was paying attention, hooray.\n\n01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:47.640\nAnd then, but like, there we go.\n\n01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.960\nI hear it's good.\n\n01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:50.760\nI'm going to check that out.\n\n01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.600\nNo, I watch it.\n\n01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:54.400\nIt's phenomenal.\n\n01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.640\nAnd then Modern Family won for Best Comedy, but.\n\n01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:57.760\nOh, there you go.\n\n01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.320\nThere you go.\n\n01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.800\nLike usual.\n\n01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:02.760\nBut apparently, there's a lot of upsets this year,\n\n01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.440\nlike who won best actors and stuff.\n\n01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:07.080\nThat's what I heard, like nobody's swept.\n\n01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.000\nNobody swept.\n\n01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.040\nLike Breaking Bad One for Best Drama,\n\n01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:13.320\nbut Anna Gunn was the only one who won any actor awards\n\n01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:14.640\nfor Breaking Bad.\n\n01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:16.720\nAnd then Modern Family, they won for Best Comedy,\n\n01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:19.680\nbut none of their actors won for Best Comedy.\n\n01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:21.520\nSo it's a really strange.\n\n01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:23.160\nI just thought we were at the drawing room,\n\n01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:24.480\nand we were talking about the Emmys,\n\n01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:26.320\nand I was like, you know, they bothered\n\n01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.520\nto do this arbitrary separation.\n\n01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:31.200\nThis is that sound of the show's air getting let out\n\n01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.920\nin the background.\n\n01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:35.800\nThey bothered to do this arbitrary separation\n\n01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.880\nbetween comedy and drama, and so everything's bisected,\n\n01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.360\nespecially nowadays, where it's like, okay.\n\n01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:44.280\nAnd Erin pointed out that she was watching Nurse Jackie,\n\n01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:46.760\nand I was sleeping in bed, and I woke up.\n\n01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:48.400\nApparently, I'm an asshole in my sleep.\n\n01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:51.760\nI just woke up half asleep and went, hilarious.\n\n01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.320\nIt's a hilarious show.\n\n01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:55.200\nThey should nominate it for Best Comedy,\n\n01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:58.480\nand like in my sleep, it's just still better.\n\n01:06:58.480 --> 01:06:59.760\nStill an asshole.\n\n01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:04.320\nAnyways, but these divisions between drama and comedy exist,\n\n01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:07.280\nbut what doesn't exist is a division between, say,\n\n01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:09.440\nthe schedule, like the idea that, oh,\n\n01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:12.240\nis this a show that owed 25 episodes a year,\n\n01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:15.000\nor is this a show that had to do 10 episodes\n\n01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.360\nevery two years?\n\n01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:17.680\nBut then I stopped myself, and I was like,\n\n01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:18.680\nwait, what am I talking about?\n\n01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:19.520\nThis is perfect.\n\n01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.360\nThe Emmys are actually the place\n\n01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:21.640\nwhere it all comes out in the wash,\n\n01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:25.080\nbecause if you make 13 episodes a year,\n\n01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:29.000\nand you therefore get to make good television\n\n01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.720\ninstead of focusing on revenue,\n\n01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:34.760\nthen you have a better shot at an Emmy,\n\n01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.920\nand that's actually justice, I think.\n\n01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:40.240\nSo I'm telling a story about how I had a thought,\n\n01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.040\nand then it canceled itself out.\n\n01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:44.840\nWhoa, whoa, my friends and I have actually\n\n01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:47.040\nbeen talking about it and saying that, really,\n\n01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:50.360\nthere should be a division between network and cable,\n\n01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:52.240\nbecause cable often, they have a bigger budget,\n\n01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.520\nand they have the ability to do way more\n\n01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:56.040\njust being on cable. They used to have that division,\n\n01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:59.280\nbut that threatened both the existence of cable and networks.\n\n01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:02.400\nLike they used to just, there was the Emmys,\n\n01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.960\nand then there was the Cable Ace Awards.\n\n01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:07.120\nThey were like, you little darlin' cable shows,\n\n01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:09.600\nhere's a little Ace Award for you.\n\n01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.680\nAnd at a certain point, the Emmys are like,\n\n01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.680\nwhat are we gonna do?\n\n01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.280\nJust stand here while Rome is burning?\n\n01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:15.600\nAre we gonna keep having the Emmys?\n\n01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:17.240\nAre we gonna invite HBO into this\n\n01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:18.960\nso we can give all the awards to them?\n\n01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:23.960\nWell, I mean, the interesting thing is that television\n\n01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:27.680\nis still an art form, it's still a medium.\n\n01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.800\nI think that's what Don Sheetal was trying to say\n\n01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:31.760\nwhen I was waking up.\n\n01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:34.400\nI think his point was that, isn't it funny\n\n01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:35.840\nthat throughout all of this,\n\n01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:38.720\nall of the weird permutations that cinema is going through,\n\n01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:41.280\nand music and stuff, that television,\n\n01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:43.640\nit is still a thing called television,\n\n01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:46.000\nand it does carry a certain cultural weight,\n\n01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.040\nand movies are getting shittier and shittier.\n\n01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.360\nOoh, insidious.\n\n01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:54.720\nUh, and TV continues to get like,\n\n01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.960\nas we start to mash it into,\n\n01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.440\nI guess that's sort of like print\n\n01:08:58.440 --> 01:08:59.920\nis probably the biggest analogy,\n\n01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:04.560\nbecause after you mashed time and life magazine\n\n01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.880\ninto a thousand cat fancies,\n\n01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:09.120\nthat's when magazines started to get good.\n\n01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.760\nLike, oh shit, there's a ninja magazine?\n\n01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:13.320\nLike, that's Breaking Bad.\n\n01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:14.960\nIt's like the more surface area.\n\n01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:17.120\nBreaking Bad's a ninja magazine?\n\n01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.880\nI will never make myself clear to these people.\n\n01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:22.480\nAnyways, whatever, I can talk.\n\n01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:24.600\nYou know what, this podcast should be called\n\n01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:30.600\nI Go To Bed And Mumble Things Until I Fall Asleep.\n\n01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:34.600\nWhat are you plugging, Kelly?\n\n01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.240\nChips?\n\n01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:36.720\nNo.\n\n01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:37.600\nSoda?\n\n01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.520\nI mean, if you want to buy everything,\n\n01:09:39.520 -->

Globes, but I remember watching TV\n\n01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:28.880\nand they were doing that thing where there's a person in the wings\n\n01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:33.600\nlike jumping on you like a harpy as you walk up the stage\n\n01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:39.360\nand this poor girl who was on the show called Ugly Betty.\n\n01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:42.800\nShe walked off stage after winning her award\n\n01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:48.120\nand this woman, this wave from some entertainment show,\n\n01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:52.120\npounces on her and goes, so, America Ferrera,\n\n01:13:52.120 -->

said America Ferrera is not attractive enough\n\n01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:05.120\nto be a leading lady?\n\n01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:09.400\nI just stuck a mic in her face and she was like, uh, what?\n\n01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:10.400\nCommercial.\n\n01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.920\nYou know, the show's just called Ugly Betty.\n\n01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:20.040\nThat doesn't mean you get to kick me in the face.\n\n01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.040\nI'm a human being.\n\n01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:25.800\nYeah, all right, anyways, television.\n\n01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:27.040\nIt's still out

between those seven months,\n\n01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:37.840\nDon Cheadle will be there.\n\n01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:40.280\nWhat was, this was so weird.\n\n01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:43.760\nLike at the Grammys, there's always this weird moment\n\n01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:45.320\nwhere a guy comes out and yells at you\n\n01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:48.040\nfor downloading music and then recedes back\n\n01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:51.160\ninto the rafters, starts playing his pipe organ again.\n\n01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:56.280\nFun fact, Dan and I went to the last week\n\n01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:58.600\nwe were at the Creative Arts Emmys\n\n01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:01.240\nand Dan was presenting so he was backstage.\n\n01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:02.080\nHow was that?\n\n01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:04.000\nIs there, what was that?\n\n01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:04.840\nWhat'd you do?\n\n01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:05.680\nWhat was your bit?\n\n01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.760\nSee, our bit was, me and Joel McHale went out\n\n01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:09.880\nand our bit was that,\n\n01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:13.200\nHow'd they introduce you first?\n\n01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:14.120\nIt was just the top of the show.\n\n01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:17.040\nCreative Arts Emmys has to run like a bobsled\n\n01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:21.480\nbecause it's 72 awards and they,\n\n01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:24.720\nit's so weird because it's like,\n\n01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.040\nokay, it's the Creative Arts Emmys.\n\n01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:28.320\nSo we understand, don't, you know,\n\n01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:29.760\nwe're not, you're not gonna show us\n\n01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:31.560\nduring the prime time broadcast.\n\n01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.040\nSo you would think that that would mean then,\n\n01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:35.760\nokay, I won an award for hairdressing.\n\n01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:39.280\nI should be able to chew the scenery a little bit\n\n01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.120\nand go like, hold my very real Emmy and go like, okay.\n\n01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:45.320\nLike, you know what, I've been putting my fingers\n\n01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:47.840\nthrough gross people's hair for 30 years\n\n01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:49.760\nand I finally got a fucking Emmy for it.\n\n01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:52.160\nI thank you Jesus Christ for giving me the power\n\n01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:53.760\nto do hair at six in the morning.\n\n01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:56.600\nThank you for, thank you to my mother who told me\n\n01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:00.360\nthat doing hair wasn't, whatever, blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:03.560\nThey give them like 14 seconds to get through this stuff\n\n01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:06.920\nbecause there's so many awards and they tell them\n\n01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:10.840\nthe time you take getting to the stage comes off your time.\n\n01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:15.840\nSo people who like are winning for like best belt making\n\n01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:20.920\nare like running sprint to the extent\n\n01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:24.840\nthat they love their children and wanna thank them more.\n\n01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:27.520\nThey have to run like the longer they've been\n\n01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:30.840\nin the business, the more people they have to thank,\n\n01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:34.120\nthe more they have to fucking truck it up there.\n\n01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:38.120\nAnd the faster this weird techno music starts playing,\n\n01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.160\nthat when they play them off,\n\n01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:41.040\nI noticed the Emmys tonight, the real Emmys,\n\n01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:45.000\nthey're actually, they've created a very delicate playoff.\n\n01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:48.960\nClaire Daines was accepting and it was like sort of like,\n\n01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:51.400\nI guess live orchestra probably they know what they're doing.\n\n01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.080\nThey start vamping a little bit.\n\n01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.640\nThat's the creative arts Emmys.\n\n01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:57.480\nIt's like some woman going up there and going,\n\n01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:01.720\nmy husband died while I was doing John Teetle's wardrobe\n\n01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:04.160\nand I told him I'd be home by five.\n\n01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:06.200\nI was home by five the next morning.\n\n01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:08.840\nAnd I also just,\n\n01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:16.760\nincluding people accepting an award\n\n01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:21.000\nfor a television program about kids with AIDS.\n\n01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.360\nAnd I was in the audience and these people won this award\n\n01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:27.360\nand they're like, you know, this award is,\n\n01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:28.440\nit's not about us.\n\n01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.560\nIt's about like bringing attention to this issue.\n\n01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:33.880\nThere are kids across the country who are suffering\n\n01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:38.880\nfrom this disease and I, they're dying and I just appreciate.\n\n01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:40.840\nAt a certain point, like they were screaming.\n\n01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.640\nThank you kids, thank you AIDS, goodnight.\n\n01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:45.960\nYeah.\n\n01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:47.800\nBut I was gonna say the coolest thing,\n\n01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:50.320\nlike I mean that was a weird experience.\n\n01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.880\nI was sitting out in the audience alone, like in the,\n\n01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:54.200\nlike towards the front,\n\n01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:57.720\nI got to watch one of my childhood heroes,\n\n01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:59.920\nScott Bacula from Quantum Leap.\n\n01:18:01.120 -->

01:23:26.120\nBullied?\n\n01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:28.840\nYeah, yeah, I'd say that's a pretty fair description.\n\n01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:30.840\nNo, no, we'll discuss that in a moment.\n\n01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:35.040\nThen they started going up a staircase.\n\n01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:36.840\nThat's all.\n\n01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:39.680\nOkay, so let's, can we do a little meta talk\n\n01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:41.680\nabout that character and his attitude?\n\n01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:42.800\nYeah.\n\n01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:44.720\nSo we bullied him?\n\n01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:46.880\nYeah, I mean, I think that's fair.\n\n01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:51.000\nHe was obstinate, he was assholish.\n\n01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.840\nHe came into your dungeon after fighting\n\n01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:56.360\nlike two rooms full of tricky demons\n\n01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:57.920\nthat tried to mess with his mind\n\n01:23:57.920 --> 01:23:59.640\nand he thought you were tricky demons.\n\n01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:02.520\nSo he came in, you know, full cocked.\n\n01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:05.440\nAnd we told him that we weren't tricky.\n\n01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:06.720\nAnd he was like, prove it.\n\n01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:08.160\nAnd then you were like, blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:10.040\nAnd he was like, you guys got fucking skeletons.\n\n01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:10.880\nThat's evil.\n\n01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:12.360\nAnd you were like, ah, I'm mad at you.\n\n01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:14.600\nAnd he's like, oh, maybe you're right.\n\n01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:16.200\nAnd then he felt kind of foolish.\n\n01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:19.160\nAnd then he was like, oh, so Shane killed him, really?\n\n01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:22.280\nNo, well, then that would have killed him.\n\n01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:25.320\nBut then you guys started really, really firing back at him.\n\n01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:26.920\nYou know, like, oh, yeah, now you guys\n\n01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:28.240\nfeel bad about yourself.\n\n01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:31.200\nAnd he's like, oh, I'm going to go in this room.\n\n01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:33.720\nAnd then he got killed.\n\n01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:38.440\nAll right, so I guess that's technically bullying him.\n\n01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:39.600\nYeah, I mean, whatever.\n\n01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:44.480\nI don't feel bad.\n\n01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:46.760\nYou don't have to.\n\n01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:48.760\nI feel great.\n\n01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:51.720\nSome guy came in the room and whatever.\n\n01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:53.080\nI don't feel bad either, because he just\n\n01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:54.280\nsort of charged off into there.\n\n01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:56.400\nHe just, we were like, what about this room?\n\n01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:57.360\nHe just like charged off.\n\n01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:57.920\nHe was a dick.\n\n01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:59.840\nAnd at one point, I kneeled in front of him\n\n01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:03.160\nand offered to let him cut my head off.\n\n01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:05.840\nIf he, I was forthcoming.\n\n01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.040\nYou're being a dick about that.\n\n01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:08.960\nThat's passive aggressive.\n\n01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:09.920\nPassive aggressive.\n\n01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:12.760\nCome on, come on, hit off.\n\n01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:15.160\nDo it, do it.\n\n01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:17.960\nNo.\n\n01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:19.000\nI mean, all right.\n\n01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.400\nYou've done that to me before.\n\n01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:25.000\nSo we went up a staircase.\n\n01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:25.520\nHere we are.\n\n01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:26.360\nYou still are.\n\n01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:27.360\nA staircase?\n\n01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:35.600\nThe October.\n\n01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:40.120\nAll this October at the Holiday mattress store.\n\n01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:42.800\nI examined my staircase surroundings.\n\n01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:44.800\nIt's a long staircase.\n\n01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:47.520\nIt kind of winds around in a circle.\n\n01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.400\nI guess more of a stairwell.\n\n01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:51.400\nWhat order are we on the staircase?\n\n01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:52.680\nYou know, whatever.\n\n01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:53.880\nNo.\n\n01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:55.760\nSo right now, Rob, it's like when we play at home.\n\n01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:56.880\nLike, we're just interacting.\n\n01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:58.360\nWhat?\n\n01:25:58.360 --> 01:25:59.520\nI think we're in a line.\n\n01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:02.280\nYeah, I know we're in a line, but we're not in a fight.\n\n01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:04.120\nAnd who's like in the middle?\n\n01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:04.920\nWho's in the back?\n\n01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:07.440\nThat's up to you guys.\n\n01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:07.960\nThat's half the line.\n\n01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:08.640\nI got an idea.\n\n01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:10.600\nLet's have him be in the front.\n\n01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:11.440\nI got to look at it.\n\n01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:12.560\nI'll be in the front.\n\n01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:13.120\nI'm in the front.\n\n01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:14.200\nThen we can be second.\n\n01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:15.000\nAll right.\n\n01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:15.800\nThat happens.\n\n01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:18.120\nI start running up the staircase.\n\n01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:21.280\nAs you run up the stairs, you feel the temperature increasing.\n\n01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:22.200\nIt's getting hotter.\n\n01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:24.800\nThis is the Arctic area, but it's hot.\n\n01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:25.720\nIt's crazy.\n\n01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:27.040\nGuys, this is weird.\n\n01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:28.040\nIt is weird.\n\n01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:29.040\nIt's weird for here.\n\n01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:30.600\nStop running up the stairs.\n\n01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:31.880\nYou're breaking a sweat.\n\n01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:38.920\nI feel the walls and see if the walls are warm.\n\n01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:41.640\nThe walls themselves aren't particularly warm.\n\n01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:43.840\nIt's just the air somehow.\n\n01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:45.880\nAs you are going up these stairs,\n\n01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:48.320\nyou see a large orange metal door.\n\n01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:52.640\nIt's like a safe door with a big kind of spinny handle thing.\n\n01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:53.960\nI touched the door.\n\n01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:55.800\nIt's warm.\n\n01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:59.160\nThere's hot stuff on the other side.\n\n01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:01.360\nLook under the crack.\n\n01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:02.960\nI look under Rob's crack.\n\n01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:04.480\nNo.\n\n01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:06.000\nNo, the crack of the door.\n\n01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.280\nThe twix, the door.\n\n01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:08.320\nIt's like a safe door.\n\n01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:09.160\nThere's no crack.\n\n01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:10.000\nYeah, that's what happens.\n\n01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000\nYou didn't check, did you?\n\n01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:11.880\nI look under the crack.\n\n01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:12.720\nThere is a one like you.\n\n01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:16.320\nOK, all right, now we know.\n\n01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.680\nIt could be an above crack.\n\n01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:19.920\nYou didn't check that either.\n\n01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:21.880\nOK, people, stand down.\n\n01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:23.240\nWe got a hot door here.\n\n01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:25.720\nThis is a hot door.\n\n01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:26.880\nIt's a safe type door.\n\n01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:29.000\nThere seems to be hot elements on the other side.\n\n01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.960\nAt this point in time, I am a mage.\n\n01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:34.400\nI will cast resist elements on most of you.\n\n01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:36.560\nIf you want resist elements cast upon you,\n\n01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:37.840\nplease come to the front.\n\n01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:41.200\nIf you are a skeleton or an assistant to a skeleton,\n\n01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:44.880\nplease remain behind the living.\n\n01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:47.400\nI repeat, you will not have resist elements cast upon you.\n\n01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:49.440\nIf you are a skeleton, if you are a skeleton,\n\n01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:51.360\nyou already resist elements.\n\n01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:52.160\nYou are dead.\n\n01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:59.760\nI cast resist elements on people.\n\n01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:02.360\nI think that only works on the one person.\n\n01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:05.600\nDo it on me.\n\n01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:07.160\nCast elements.\n\n01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:10.000\nI say that I'll save it for a rainy day,\n\n01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.240\nand then I do it under the breath resist elements\n\n01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:13.200\ncasting on myself.\n\n01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:19.480\nThat happens.\n\n01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:21.440\nIt's not noticeable.\n\n01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:22.920\nAll right.\n\n01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:23.560\nWhat are you?\n\n01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:25.400\nAre you a thief or a rogue?\n\n01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:28.120\nI'm a quark, barbarian.\n\n01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:29.080\nI'm a barbarian.\n\n01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:31.000\nI'm a half elf.\n\n01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.120\nI put on my flaming armor.\n\n01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:33.600\nOK.\n\n01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:34.080\nHello.\n\n01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:40.600\nAnd I go up to the door, and I try to open the door.\n\n01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:42.000\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:42.600\nI stop.\n\n01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:45.040\nI stop you.\n\n01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:45.960\nHow are you stopping me?\n\n01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:51.080\nWell, it's like by putting two hands on my flaming armor.\n\n01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:52.280\nOn your shoulders, yeah.\n\n01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:53.240\nOK, OK.\n\n01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:56.400\nIt's romantic for a second, unless it burns me.\n\n01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:57.000\nOK.\n\n01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.760\nI turned down my flames.\n\n01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:01.080\nI resist your elements.\n\n01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:05.400\nOh, OK.\n\n01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:06.960\nOK, so here we go.\n\n01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:10.560\nAm I standing in the between them?\n\n01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:11.560\nOnly if you want to be.\n\n01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:13.600\nStep around and do trap sense on the door.\n\n01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:14.480\nThat's up to you guys.\n\n01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:15.640\nSo you put your hands on my shoulder.\n\n01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:17.240\nI want Christopher to check out the door.\n\n01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:18.120\nHe's a rogue.\n\n01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:19.480\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:22.080\nWhen you come to a door, he's just let me sit on the door.\n\n01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:22.840\nYeah, sure.\n\n01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:23.840\nCertain protocol here.\n\n01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:25.400\nAre you trying to protect me?\n\n01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:28.400\nYes.\n\n01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:29.800\nYes, yes.\n\n01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:31.560\nThe way I try to protect you when I say,\n\n01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:34.600\ndid you turn the gas off when we go to bed?\n\n01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:36.200\nI'm trying to protect the whole house.\n\n01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:41.920\nLove.\n\n01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:43.800\nWhat's happening?\n\n01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:44.720\nCrap sense.\n\n01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:46.360\nChristopher wants to check out the door.\n\n01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:48.240\nTrap sense, is that what I heard?\n\n01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:48.560\nYeah.\n\n01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:49.400\nOK.\n\n01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:51.280\nSo you examine this door.\n\n01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:57.800\nIt looks on closer inspection to be made of adamantium.\n\n01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:58.440\nOh.\n\n01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:00.480\nOh, wait, no, that's OK.\n\n01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:01.640\nAll right.\n\n01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:04.440\nIt's a very strong and a hard metal,\n\n01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:07.440\nfor those of you not in the know.\n\n01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:10.120\nIt's what Wolverine's made out of.\n\n01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:11.000\nNot that you can tell.\n\n01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.480\nYeah, the skeleton.\n\n01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:18.920\nIt's one electron different from unobtainium.\n\n01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:25.360\nThat's the door.\n\n01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:25.880\nAll right.\n\n01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:28.680\nSo it's made out of adamantium, but there's no traps\n\n01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:29.720\nthat you can sense?\n\n01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:31.200\nI don't see anything.\n\n01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:33.600\nSo it's like a vault door, like it's got a crank on it?\n\n01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:34.120\nYeah.\n\n01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:35.280\nYeah, let's open this thing.\n\n01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:35.960\nCome on.\n\n01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:37.680\nAll right, kitten, you want to do a?\n\n01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:38.160\nSure.\n\n01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:38.920\nYes, I will.\n\n01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:39.420\nWhat?\n\n01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:42.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:42.840\nAll right.\n\n01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:43.800\nWhat do you want?\n\n01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:46.320\nWhoever wants to open it, open it.\n\n01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:48.240\nHey, you want to open this door with me?\n\n01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:48.760\nSure.\n\n01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:50.400\nOK, you grab one side.\n\n01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:51.880\nI got this side.\n\n01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:52.760\nOK, and now?\n\n01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:54.200\nI'm going to push up, you push down.\n\n01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:56.240\nLet's do it counterclockwise.\n\n01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:59.680\nI mean it in a straight line.\n\n01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:01.040\nNo, no, let's open it.\n\n01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:01.440\nOK.\n\n01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:03.480\nOne, two, three, open.\n\n01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:07.120\nYou pull the handle, and it slides open with a sharp snick.\n\n01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:07.600\nOuch.\n\n01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:08.360\nSnicked?\n\n01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:09.080\nA snick?\n\n01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:10.160\nFrom the adamantium.\n\n01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:11.000\nThat's the sound of it.\n\n01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.480\nWouldn't it be three?\n\n01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:13.360\nFucking nerd.\n\n01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:14.440\nNice.\n\n01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:18.080\nIt's a deep cut.\n\n01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:22.960\nA nerd alert sounds throughout the dungeon.\n\n01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:23.640\nYeah.\n\n01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:24.440\nSo yeah.\n\n01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:26.880\nI don't understand what's going on.\n\n01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:30.920\nOh my god, my high school girlfriend came to the show.\n\n01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:32.680\nWhat's happening?\n\n01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:35.560\nSnicked is a sound effect that Wolverine's just\n\n01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:36.520\nadamantium plasma.\n\n01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:37.520\nWho the fuck a wolf man is?\n\n01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:41.280\nWhy did you come here, Trisha?\n\n01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:42.000\nI'm going home.\n\n01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.440\nYou won't go to the snowball dance with me?\n\n01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:47.480\nYou show up when I'm 40 to the Harmontown?\n\n01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:48.640\nIt's weird.\n\n01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:51.680\nYour theme for your dance was just snowball?\n\n01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:53.440\nWe had a winter dance, snowball dance.\n\n01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:56.400\nSorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.\n\n01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:59.840\nThe room is hot like a summer's day.\n\n01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:02.800\nAnd you begin to sweat.\n\n01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:04.360\nThose things are hot, right?\n\n01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:06.560\nYeah, depending on where you are.\n\n01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:09.200\nI guess that's a good point.\n\n01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:12.800\nInside this room are three massive stone lions,\n\n01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:16.200\nmouths frozen open, and a ferocious roar.\n\n01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:18.000\nYou don't see any doors in this room,\n\n01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.240\nbut there are masses of chains hanging from the high ceiling,\n\n01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:23.840\nsome dangling down like silver vines\n\n01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:25.480\nfrom the clanking canopy.\n\n01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:29.800\nI grab one of the chains and I start pulling on it.\n\n01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:33.680\nIt's too high up.\n\n01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:38.640\nProbably the lowest one is about 20 feet off the floor.\n\n01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:40.000\nI can't jump in?\n\n01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:40.600\nNope.\n\n01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:41.080\nOK.\n\n01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:44.400\nYou jump on one of these stone lions and jump up there.\n\n01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:46.240\nIn the center of the room, you also\n\n01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:49.200\nsee a metal treasure chest.\n\n01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:52.440\nI approach the treasure chest, try to open it.\n\n01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:55.240\nYou approach the treasure chest.\n\n01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:58.800\nDo you mind if I look at that first?\n\n01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:00.680\nYeah.\n\n01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:02.120\nIf you look at it first?\n\n01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:03.600\nYeah, I'd like to trap sense on it.\n\n01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:04.880\nLet them trap sense.\n\n01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:05.480\nOK.\n\n01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:07.120\nWhat don't you understand about this procedure?\n\n01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:08.320\nI don't want you to get hurt.\n\n01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:09.360\nTry to be nice.\n\n01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.280\nNo trap sense first.\n\n01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:11.960\nA little bit of caution.\n\n01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:12.760\nI misunderstood.\n\n01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:14.360\nI thought it was just like a foot.\n\n01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:16.040\nNo, I just wanted to open it and take everything\n\n01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:17.880\nand keep it to myself.\n\n01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:19.620\nGo ahead, Chris.\n\n01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:20.760\nThere's a trap.\n\n01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:22.720\nAhhhhh!\n\n01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:26.680\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.\n\n01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:27.660\nTrap sense.\n\n01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:33.080\nThe Proletariat.\n\n01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:34.840\nBa da da da.\n\n01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:36.480\nThe Proletariat.\n\n01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:38.200\nThe Proletariat.\n\n01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:39.720\nAre in a trap of economy.\n\n01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:40.880\nOh, trap sense.\n\n01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:54.600\nAnd television was there for the first season of Gilligan's Island to the explosion of our\n\n01:33:54.600 --> 01:34:04.520\npresident's brains. What did they have in common television? It doesn't make sense to praise that\n\n01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:16.080\nas if it's like what a medium. Good job TV. Thanks for the Beatles and killing Kennedy. Thank\n\n01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:21.840\nyou. I'll keep watching you. Commence with the awards. Who got one and a gun? All right. I knew\n\n01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:27.960\nI was watching something important. So what's the nature of the trap? Dan Harmon. I didn't write\n\n01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:37.280\nwhat I said at the Emmy. Oh, shit. I got an email from Don Cheadle. Wrote that for me. Dear Don\n\n01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:44.240\nCheadle, first of all, let's follow each other and send each other. We shouldn't have to direct\n\n01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:57.720\ntweet each other. So we open the door. There's some lions and some chains. There's a trap. It's a\n\n01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:06.120\ngood question. You think it might be some sort of mechanical based trap. Mechanical based trap.\n\n01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:12.440\nThat's situated on the locking mechanism. No other exits from this room. Not that you can see. Hey,\n\n01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:19.040\ndo I think it's related to the lions or the chains? It's not related to anything but the chest. I\n\n01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:28.520\nsay we all get behind the chest and give her an open from behind it. Like to the hinge. Reach around.\n\n01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:36.920\nYeah. Reach around. Yeah. We all stand behind it. It's designed to trap whoever opens it. Is it a hinge\n\n01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:49.560\nchest or is it a lid chest? It's a, I mean, it has a hinged lid. Thank you. It's a hybrid. Hey,\n\n01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:57.440\nwhy don't we take the hinges off the back? That's not a bad idea. Thanks. How do you plan to do that?\n\n01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:06.920\nI'm going to just start hitting it with my foot. What do I got here? I have conjure Phillips. How are the\n\n01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:14.040\nhinges affixed? Guys, I have a cloak of resistance. We really want to open it, but I have a feeling\n\n01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:21.040\nthat if we open it, things will happen. Maybe the lions will come to life or something. If I put on\n\n01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:28.520\nthe cloak of resistance, I can open it and you guys can hide. How do you feel? As far as I understand,\n\n01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:37.800\nas the resident wizard, can I cast Detect Magic on this thing? Yeah. And will that allow me to also\n\n01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:43.560\nfurther get a little more information about if there is magic, what kind of magic? Yeah, but I said\n\n01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:50.040\nit was a mechanical trap. Yeah, but I, okay, so that's you telling me not to waste my spell. Yeah. Okay,\n\n01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:57.080\nso what I'm saying is it's a mechanical trap. There's no mechanics on God's earth that will make these\n\n01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:03.560\nlions come to life. I'm not saying they won't at some point, but the trap that we sensed, it's going\n\n01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:08.760\nto be, it's like, there's some shit that's going to, you know, it's like, oh, I got shot with a dart or\n\n01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:17.040\nthere's gas that comes out. It's a mechanical trap. I don't think so. No? I was kind of thinking we\n\n01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:24.120\ncould use some vials of acid on the hinges. Yeah. I love it. All right. I'm just saying don't stand\n\n01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:31.760\nin front of the chest when you do it. I still I still I put on my cloak of resistance. Good call. As\n\n01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:40.600\nyou put it on, you feel more resistant. She hasn't been wearing that the entire time. No, she has. You\n\n01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:56.840\nguys are all wearing I put on my cloak of oppositional defiant disorder. No, you don't. Yeah. So do you\n\n01:37:56.840 --> 01:38:04.600\nwant to do the acid thing? All right. So you pour your vials of acid over over the hinges on the back\n\n01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:11.880\nof this chest and it bubbles and you smell a terrible smell. But eventually it eats through. And you\n\n01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:17.080\nsee these hinges are now gone. You could probably pull up the top of the lid. To me, the smell is good\n\n01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:27.400\nbecause I it's the smell of a trap being foiled. Yeah, then it does smell good to you. All right,\n\n01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:34.680\ngentlemen. The snack is lit over. All right, let's do it. All right. All right, you open up the lid and\n\n01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:40.280\nas you open it, you see the the trap mechanism inside. It looks like it's a little tiny crossbow. So\n\n01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:46.280\nyou pull off the lid and it just fires the crossbow in the other direction. See dumb. Child's\n\n01:38:46.280 --> 01:39:00.360\nplay. Yes. All right. Inside the chest are 60 arrows and two bags of arts and crafts supplies. I'll\n\n01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:11.760\ntake those. I'll take I take all the glitter. All the glitters. I want all the craftwood. Is this a\n\n01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:20.280\nmull rain chest? Thank you. Gentlemen, I'm going to go ahead and scoop up this arts and crafts\n\n01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:26.040\nsupplies. And I'm going to I'm going to take 20 of these arrows. What? You can't take can't take the\n\n01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:32.440\narrows any arts and crafts. Just taking all of them. She's taking some of them. What? Let's give you\n\n01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:40.040\nup the arrows. You got a crossbow? Crossbows take bolts, not arrows. Yeah. All right. Well,\n\n01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:47.640\nin celebration, I walk up to one of the stone lions and I kick it and I go yeah. It's it's\n\n01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:53.880\npretty invigorating. It doesn't hurt too bad. You're just feeling I don't have a bow. Stop\n\n01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:59.320\nlooking everybody. Sorry. Can I can I use wild empathy on the frozen lions to figure out what\n\n01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:05.400\nhappened? You could try but you don't feel empathy coming towards them as if they're just statues\n\n01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:10.400\nor something. I get on top of one of them. And I'm like, I wish one day they'll invent something\n\n01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:20.680\nthat stores images. I burned that into my mind to your memory. I remember that time. What's in\n\n01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:25.840\nthe arts and crafts supplies? You know, just general stuff. All right, Spencer, if we want to go\n\n01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:29.720\ndown this road, we'll go down this road. Figure at least give you the tools to do it with right.\n\n01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:36.840\nOkay. I examine the eyes and mouths of the lions. Just looking for gems, baubles, other sundry\n\n01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:45.160\nnotions. You see their eyes do kind of look a little glinty like glint glint glint things.\n\n01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:51.240\nAnd in celebration of getting all the supplies, I grabbed two of the chains and I started swinging\n\n01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:57.000\naround and she can't do that. She can't do that. I tried doing that and you said I couldn't. Yeah,\n\n01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:01.680\nyou're not high enough. You'd have to jump. Right. Not high enough. Guys, I got a glint over here.\n\n01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:12.560\nI got glint. Is there anything in its mouth? Who's asking? I'm asking him because he's up\n\n01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:19.920\nthere. I got glint in the eyes. I don't know. The mouth seems empty. Mouth clear. Eye glinty. Can\n\n01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:25.160\nI climb on the, can I climb on top of the lion and then jump on a chain? Yeah, hold up. What\n\n01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:32.000\nmade you laugh? You didn't say I could do that. Well, you didn't ask. You do that. You climb up\n\n01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:38.240\natop the stone lion. You also can, you can get onto one of these chains if you'd like. I'm on,\n\n01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:44.440\nI want to get on one of the chains. Then you do. I want to swing around. You swing around. It's\n\n01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:51.360\nlike a joyous occasion. I have a knife I want to use to pry some of the glintiness out of these\n\n01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:58.200\nlion eyes. Okay. So you're trying to, you're trying to pry. Yeah. Pry the eye. Yeah. When you,\n\n01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:05.240\nwhen you're jamming it with your prior, you feel the eye go in a little bit like it's being pushed\n\n01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:13.200\ninward and you, you hear a rumbling coming from the ceiling above and you on the chain. What did\n\n01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:21.800\nyou do? You're self shaken on this chain as the ceiling begins to roll. I rushed to the opposite\n\n01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:27.200\nand I'm going to climb up on that line. On what now? The lion that's opposite him. So it'd be\n\n01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:32.560\ndiagonal again. So you're all on lions? Might not be a bad idea. Well, I mean, I'm not. I didn't,\n\n01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:44.400\nI'm standing here. Would you like to be on the lion? Yes. All I wanted was to be invited. Everyone\n\n01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:56.320\ngets on a lion. The rumbling continues and gets louder and builds to a cliffhanger. Thank you,\n\n01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:02.680\neveryone for coming to Harmontown. Let's hear it for Bill, Rob Schroff, Spencer, Dan Harmon.\n\n01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:16.160\nDrive safe. Thank you, Bill. Thank you, Erin, McGathey, guest com, Traller. Thank all of you.\n\n01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:24.280\nI don't know. Exit through the gift shop. I don't know what Jeff usually says. He thanks everybody.\n\n01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:34.880\nKatie Levine, Dustin, Emily. Zach, Dustin Marshall, Feral Audio. Probably Moe. Everyone did great.\n\n01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:55.280\nThank you, everyone. I'm out now. Thank you. See you next week.\n\n","cpu_time":["0.003s"],"str_size":[151950]}
