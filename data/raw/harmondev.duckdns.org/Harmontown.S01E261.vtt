just give it up for your mayor Dan Harmon\n\n01:06.440 --> 01:13.800\nthank you thank you very much so yeah we got shut down we were apparently\n\n01:13.800 --> 01:20.640\nperforming quite illegally since the from the very moment that we left\n\n01:20.640 --> 01:26.280\nMeltdown I wouldn't have left Meltdown if I had known that I wouldn't have had\n\n01:26.280 --> 01:31.360\npeople you know audiences coming into an illegal place if you're listening and\n\n01:31.360 --> 01:35.160\nyou've come to the show live shows no you can't sue us don't be stupid and the\n\n01:35.160 --> 01:39.160\nrumors that there was a sex for pay scandal happening that doesn't these are\n\n01:39.160 --> 01:44.880\nall unfounded as I I should say you know no we were doing every we were\n\n01:44.880 --> 01:50.040\nillegal in terms of like you know the fire department you know this is serious\n\n01:50.040 --> 01:53.480\nstuff like I don't want to be in violation of fire code we need we didn't\n\n01:53.480 --> 01:59.400\nhave permits that we we have applied for a long time ago I think the\n\n01:59.400 --> 02:03.720\nmisunderstanding was that we thought it would work like driving where you're\n\n02:03.720 --> 02:07.280\nwhen you're 16 you can just have a thing in your glove box that says you're\n\n02:07.280 --> 02:12.760\nworking on getting your license and then a provisional and then if a fire\n\n02:12.760 --> 02:19.440\nmarshal ever wondered in that that we could just flash a piece of paper signed\n\n02:19.440 --> 02:26.120\nby our driver's ed teacher and we would be therefore allowed to keep performing\n\n02:26.120 --> 02:31.520\nright we really had big dreams for that venue remember the guy who said oh here\n\n02:31.520 --> 02:37.760\nyou go with your podcast the playbook you got your own venue now your podcast\n\n02:37.760 --> 02:43.200\nis gonna die oh yeah I mean he's probably because he's a dumb ass that\n\n02:43.200 --> 02:46.680\nguy's definitely high-fiving himself right now I mean I wouldn't say this\n\n02:46.680 --> 02:50.280\nvindicates him but he would he proud his threshold for vindication is probably\n\n02:50.280 --> 02:53.960\nvery low he probably congratulates himself for masturbating that guy's\n\n02:53.960 --> 02:58.120\nprobably dead you know what I'm not gonna say I hope so but because we've got a\n\n02:58.120 --> 03:02.080\nlot of death in the news going on right now and I want every human out there\n\n03:02.080 --> 03:09.840\nalive that that is is still alive now the the night we were drinking nearby you\n\n03:09.840 --> 03:13.400\nand I and our friends like the church and Cody and our friends Daniel and\n\n03:13.400 --> 03:17.200\nRachel were having a drink and we got the message that the show is canceled\n\n03:17.200 --> 03:21.240\nlike 40 minutes before the show yeah what happened was there was another there\n\n03:21.240 --> 03:24.440\nwas like a party going on in the same neighborhood now originally I what I\n\n03:24.440 --> 03:28.720\nheard was that there they were operating illegally so the fire department\n\n03:28.720 --> 03:32.760\nshowed up to shut them down and then noticed the big crowd outside our castle\n\n03:32.760 --> 03:36.960\nthat's not true I would then what I then heard is that it's a little it's a\n\n03:36.960 --> 03:41.160\nlittle less ironic than that it's it's actually because they were operating\n\n03:41.160 --> 03:46.080\nlegally the fire department was there to help them or something that they did\n\n03:46.080 --> 03:49.840\nbecause you actually need fire people on hand if you're gonna perform or\n\n03:49.840 --> 03:52.640\nsomething like that if you're gonna have a crowd in a space of a certain type I\n\n03:52.640 --> 03:57.280\nthink you need like us an off-duty fireman or something like that and that\n\n03:57.280 --> 04:01.960\nperson was there in that capacity saw our space looked for his colleague that\n\n04:01.960 --> 04:07.800\nshould have been also there didn't see him where's punch oh that place must be\n\n04:07.800 --> 04:13.480\nnon it must be flammable and and so then that's how we ended up getting shut\n\n04:13.480 --> 04:16.560\ndown and I'm really sorry to anybody that showed up that night including our\n\n04:16.560 --> 04:21.960\nguest Dave Anthony and people that had flown in from or driven in from long\n\n04:21.960 --> 04:26.760\ndistances we feel terrible about that we didn't get to meet a few people that\n\n04:26.760 --> 04:31.920\nhad flown in from New York or yeah Pennsylvania or it's interesting like\n\n04:31.920 --> 04:34.920\nthose people are always so nice I mean I would of course if they started to\n\n04:34.920 --> 04:38.040\nactually express discontent when something like this happened I would\n\n04:38.040 --> 04:41.520\nimmediately skip to hating them but as it is when they're there because they're\n\n04:41.520 --> 04:45.200\nso nice about it I'm just kind of in all of them because I mean imagine the\n\n04:45.200 --> 04:48.280\ndisappointment there there so there was like literally some people that that\n\n04:48.280 --> 04:53.040\nthat you know they think they're always a little embarrassed to to actually say\n\n04:53.040 --> 04:56.760\nthe words I came here for this reason you know because who wants to say that\n\n04:56.760 --> 04:59.640\nespecially if you are a nice person you don't want to kill somebody out or\n\n04:59.640 --> 05:05.640\nimply that you're this is the you know the big thing that you wanted to come\n\n05:05.640 --> 05:09.480\nout for I think there's a natural kind of shame there and that's why I'm always\n\n05:09.480 --> 05:12.920\nreally impressed by those people they're always so nice maybe the ones that\n\n05:12.920 --> 05:16.000\naren't nice and are really outraged they skulk into the shadows and curse my\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:20.840\nname but yeah there's a couple of those people came by the the Guild Hall the\n\n05:20.840 --> 05:25.320\nbar that we've discovered that's like an e-sports nerd themed bar that's a\n\n05:25.320 --> 05:29.280\ncouple miles from the stage if you're in Burbank go there but these people came\n\n05:29.280 --> 05:34.560\nand they got to take pictures and and rap with us and buy us shots and it they\n\n05:34.560 --> 05:39.000\nacted like that made it worth it and I really appreciate yeah I hope so I hope\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:44.680\nso but now can I can I tell you like I was gonna go to a show but I couldn't\n\n05:44.680 --> 05:48.000\nbecause Harmon 10 I wouldn't have gotten there in time our friend the singer\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:52.680\npeaches the teachers of peaches she's fantastic I've never seen her actually\n\n05:52.680 --> 05:58.560\ndo a full live show she's playing at the Roxy so church and I went and we got\n\n05:58.560 --> 06:04.520\nthere right on time and the show was absolutely fantastic after the show we're\n\n06:04.520 --> 06:08.760\nup in the green room at the Roxy and we're having champagne and you know our\n\n06:08.760 --> 06:13.200\nfriends are there peaches is you know in her makeup and sweaty and she just did\n\n06:13.200 --> 06:20.000\na ridiculously high-energy badass show Ron Jeremy was also in the room now he\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:23.600\nis usually at the Rainbow bar and grill every time I've been there he's been\n\n06:23.600 --> 06:28.800\nthere like he kind of lives there and he was inordinately like unreasonably\n\n06:28.800 --> 06:34.080\nmoist like he was very wet like he was just has he just had a sheen and like\n\n06:34.080 --> 06:39.040\nkind of a like the high-prog glow he was very oily do you know that this is\n\n06:39.040 --> 06:44.400\nuncharacteristic of Ron Jeremy I don't I mean I he it's an air-conditioned\n\n06:44.400 --> 06:48.520\nbuilding and he wasn't dancing but you've seen him naked so you know that\n\n06:48.520 --> 06:53.160\nair-conditioning or not he has a built in yeah yeah but he looked like he had\n\n06:53.160 --> 07:00.040\njust been fucking he looked porn sweaty but he was just in a t-shirt hanging out\n\n07:00.040 --> 07:02.320\nin a green room for the people that weren't sweaty unless they had just\n\n07:02.320 --> 07:09.520\ngotten off the stage okay and I'd seen him there briefly he walked right past\n\n07:09.520 --> 07:13.280\nme as he was leaving this very small green room the green room is really like\n\n07:13.280 --> 07:19.320\nit's half the size of this booth and he had a banana peel but spent banana peel\n\n07:19.320 --> 07:27.080\nover his shoulder like an epaulette and his hair as long Ron Jeremy wet hair is\n\n07:27.080 --> 07:33.200\nin like kind of intertwined on this banana peel and I'm sitting on the edge\n\n07:33.200 --> 07:37.120\nof the couch with a bottle of shit pain and cups because I was kind of being like\n\n07:37.120 --> 07:43.600\nthe de facto like bartender and I he walked by me like he so he's back as\n\n07:43.600 --> 07:48.000\nJimmy's like arms length for me walking towards the door and I said sir you have\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:54.720\na banana peel on your shoulder and he wheeled around turning yeah thanks and\n\n07:54.720 --> 07:58.800\nthen fucking boned out like he was bummed out about it like wait okay all\n\n07:58.800 --> 08:05.960\nright and now the theories begin so did I mean he did he for did he previously\n\n08:05.960 --> 08:10.920\n20 minutes before then did you have 30 banana peels on him did someone dump a\n\n08:10.920 --> 08:14.600\nbarrel of banana peels on him and he thought he cleaned them all off and was\n\n08:14.600 --> 08:19.000\nleaving my first my first theory and also like people say pics or it didn't\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:23.160\nhappen this happened so quickly pick pics are didn't happen no I'd be our\n\n08:23.160 --> 08:27.720\nproof of this several Oscars including one stolen from my studio big to\n\n08:27.720 --> 08:32.600\ndifferent alright go ahead the pics or it didn't happen why didn't why did not\n\n08:32.600 --> 08:35.640\nI take a picture of this because it happened in the blink of an eye right\n\n08:35.640 --> 08:40.440\nof course you're not my first theory was that he was doing a bit that you're\n\n08:40.440 --> 08:44.080\nyou're supposed to be a woman to ask him about that and then he makes a dick\n\n08:44.080 --> 08:50.000\nreference or something that's my first theory oh because that's so grotily\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:55.480\npositive plausible but only only reason I go to that grotily a pop plausible\n\n08:55.480 --> 09:03.800\nthing grotily grotily plausible grotily plausible where have you been you're my\n\n09:03.800 --> 09:11.480\nfavorite woman says 1910 you got hips of liberation and a suffragette I don't know\n\n09:11.480 --> 09:18.200\nbrutally plausible what is that song what is it what am I thinking of mr.\n\n09:18.200 --> 09:21.200\nBelvedere it's like a school there's a schoolhouse rock thing or something like\n\n09:21.200 --> 09:29.720\nI don't know so the fact that he was so quickly irritated by my mentioning it\n\n09:29.720 --> 09:35.040\nmeans it's not it wasn't a bit if the bit is a I'm Ron Jeremy I have a banana\n\n09:35.040 --> 09:39.880\npeel on my right shoulder and some points I guess yeah oh it's scary there's a\n\n09:39.880 --> 09:46.200\nway to make that a bit now church is a photo of peaches opening a bit she had\n\n09:46.200 --> 09:50.880\na banana after the show me here's benefit of the doubt which still doesn't\n\n09:50.880 --> 09:56.840\nexplain his weird rancor and irritability was that he saw peaches\n\n09:56.840 --> 10:02.880\neating the banana took the banana peel maybe had her sign it I don't know and\n\n10:02.880 --> 10:06.960\nthen put it on his shoulder though because he's a clean freak and doesn't\n\n10:06.960 --> 10:09.640\nwant to shake people's hands with a banana peel in there or she put it on\n\n10:09.640 --> 10:13.520\nhis shoulder I don't know who this peaches is but it's like church is\n\n10:13.520 --> 10:20.800\nshaking her head oh oh so the peaches banana was after the Ron Jeremy banana\n\n10:20.800 --> 10:25.240\nokay the good so I don't have to extend any more benefits of any doubts Ron\n\n10:25.240 --> 10:33.840\nJeremy was doing some sort of surreal like artistic display because it's not\n\n10:33.840 --> 10:37.400\nweird enough that he's Ron Jeremy and looks like he's I think there's also\n\n10:37.400 --> 10:42.440\nlike you we're making the assumption that the rancor has to do with the banana\n\n10:42.440 --> 10:47.360\npeel but if we if you think about what it must be like to be Ron Jeremy there's\n\n10:47.360 --> 10:51.440\nprobably a super high percentage that at any given moment at a gathering that\n\n10:51.440 --> 10:56.680\nhas any kind of like hip quotient to it or well let's just say any gathering\n\n10:56.680 --> 11:01.720\ncuz like that because he's a porn star because we're awful rude to our our\n\n11:01.720 --> 11:05.800\nporn stars we are we're like we treat them like garbage we treat pornography\n\n11:05.800 --> 11:10.240\nlike garbage we use it all and blah blah I won't get on that soapbox but you\n\n11:10.240 --> 11:13.400\nknow the people in Los Angeles that have performed in porn that are\n\n11:13.400 --> 11:19.000\nrecognizable as such I'm sure that just as like I don't know women of color or\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:23.880\nlike got really tall dudes or anything anything any person that has anything\n\n11:23.880 --> 11:26.560\nreally specific about them is probably they're probably on a higher risk of\n\n11:26.560 --> 11:31.320\njust having had some kind of encounter they really just pissed pissed them off\n\n11:31.320 --> 11:36.160\nyou know and that like somebody somebody for the 800th time this week like\n\n11:36.160 --> 11:41.360\nasked him some question that or said phrased something in a way or like he's\n\n11:41.360 --> 11:44.360\nbecome convinced that like there's certain kinds of people that refused to\n\n11:44.360 --> 11:48.080\nshake his hand because they're afraid they'll get HPV or something and he he\n\n11:48.080 --> 11:51.840\nhe's connecting dots in his head maybe he was like on his way out and it's like\n\n11:51.840 --> 11:57.240\nI got my banana peel and then Michael J Fox said that fucking shitty thing that\n\n11:57.240 --> 12:00.280\nthere is somebody always says and I fuck I'm leaving yeah but like if you're\n\n12:00.280 --> 12:05.400\ngonna be walking that that razor's edge of crankiness because somebody recently\n\n12:05.400 --> 12:09.600\nhad said something that was kind of diminishing or rude then don't be a\n\n12:09.600 --> 12:14.720\nfamous porn star too late no no be a famous porn star be in a bad mood don't\n\n12:14.720 --> 12:19.960\nhave a banana peel and don't let that be the thing that switches you off no but\n\n12:19.960 --> 12:23.680\nI'm saying my print my pitch is that it's not what switched them off right you\n\n12:23.680 --> 12:28.040\ncaught up you caught a famous person in a bad mood and hey the banana you may as\n\n12:28.040 --> 12:34.520\nwell have said you're wearing two shoes yes okay I okay I see that but he was\n\n12:34.520 --> 12:38.640\nhaving a good time I don't look it's not the first time I've been in the same\n\n12:38.640 --> 12:41.360\nroom with Ron Jeremy I've walked by him because he's always in that same he's\n\n12:41.360 --> 12:45.440\nalways at the rainbow grill bar and grill I've never hung out with him I've\n\n12:45.440 --> 12:49.080\nnever been in close confines with him so it is my first real Ron Jeremy\n\n12:49.080 --> 12:54.320\nencounter and I wasn't gonna go up to him and say hey Ron Jeremy can I get a\n\n12:54.320 --> 12:57.560\nphoto with you because it's not always my style unless it's Keith David from the\n\n12:57.560 --> 13:02.440\nother night which I was very happy about yeah no but Occam's razor I if I had to\n\n13:02.440 --> 13:07.120\nbet my life I would I would go with your the grotally plausible thing which is\n\n13:07.120 --> 13:11.920\nthat he he does this thing where he puts a banana peel on his shoulder and if a\n\n13:11.920 --> 13:18.200\nhot woman asks him where's the banana he has a banana peel on your shoulder he's\n\n13:18.200 --> 13:22.360\nlike that's right because if you want to see the banana you got to come to the\n\n13:22.360 --> 13:27.680\nbathroom yeah yeah yeah that was my first instinct yeah but but then I go like\n\n13:27.680 --> 13:32.120\nwhy is he coming up with well I was he coming up with that shit isn't he a\n\n13:32.120 --> 13:39.680\nhuman banana on society's shoulder but like like like a banana peel and and like\n\n13:39.680 --> 13:44.520\nbut that's so wouldn't that type is it isn't aren't you Ron Jeremy enough yeah\n\n13:44.520 --> 13:49.920\nand then I think well maybe not because he whatever the lead up to that is\n\n13:49.920 --> 13:54.560\nwhatever it is maybe maybe someone our listeners are gonna go and Google this\n\n13:54.560 --> 13:58.400\nand find out that this is a long running thing that there is a hilarious bit\n\n13:58.400 --> 14:02.480\nthat's like he's doing a deep track Ron Jeremy joke that only certain people in\n\n14:02.480 --> 14:08.680\nthat room would have got but he had garbage on his shoulder and didn't have\n\n14:08.680 --> 14:15.200\na sense of humor about it which confused I mean I that's gonna confuse me for a\n\n14:15.200 --> 14:19.400\nlong time yeah and I feel like I have to do the little asterisk here my little\n\n14:19.400 --> 14:26.120\nStanley box in the corner where I come up the bottom and say by the way web\n\n14:26.120 --> 14:31.720\nheads I don't I don't if you're if you're a friend with a with a with a\n\n14:31.720 --> 14:36.560\nporn star or you are a porn star you listen to please don't feel like I don't\n\n14:36.560 --> 14:41.660\nthink we're just talking about Roger like when I hear people talk about porn\n\n14:41.660 --> 14:46.280\nstars and podcasts like I feel like you know it's like I don't I'm not I'm not\n\n14:46.280 --> 14:52.480\njudging Roger me this isn't about judging him this is judging a weird it's him\n\n14:52.480 --> 14:56.640\nbeing a porn star doesn't doesn't weigh into this at all it could have been any\n\n14:56.640 --> 15:01.480\nanybody that is worth mentioning because people know his name right or her name\n\n15:01.480 --> 15:09.240\nif I saw Pam Anderson or you know Bruno Mars walking around with a fucking\n\n15:09.240 --> 15:12.680\nbanana on the shoulder and that same thing happened that's interesting to me\n\n15:12.680 --> 15:18.720\nSpencer how are you great hey guys you guys hear about these Chinese murder\n\n15:18.720 --> 15:24.840\nvans I've only heard the mention but what do you got for us well they're like\n\n15:24.840 --> 15:28.640\nthese vans in China and they come and they get people and then they just kill\n\n15:28.640 --> 15:31.880\nthem in the vans are these people that they have contracts I don't know they\n\n15:31.880 --> 15:37.680\njust randomly killing strangers I think they're randomly killing people who the\n\n15:37.680 --> 15:41.680\nstate says they can kill you can hear the scratch of Jeff's ballpoint pen he's\n\n15:41.680 --> 15:47.280\ntaking notes he does that during the live show too I always wonder what he takes\n\n15:47.280 --> 15:51.040\nnotes during the show which is really impressive to me I was at that now that\n\n15:51.040 --> 15:54.160\nwe're doing this quote-unquote single-camera style I think I think one\n\n15:54.160 --> 15:58.600\nof the neat things I was thinking is like you could you could pretend like\n\n15:58.600 --> 16:03.440\nlike you're really smart like you could just be like hey you know here we should\n\n16:03.440 --> 16:12.760\ntalk about Charles you can hear Dan typing in wait I'm not done with Chinese\n\n16:12.760 --> 16:15.680\nmurder vans you know he's an American convicted mass murderer and former\n\n16:15.680 --> 16:19.120\ncult leader led what became known as the man you can just be like you could sound\n\n16:19.120 --> 16:22.640\na lot smarter than you are you wouldn't do not doing a live performance you do\n\n16:22.640 --> 16:27.760\nresearch yeah so often have laptops set up for just such occasions yeah so these\n\n16:27.760 --> 16:31.080\nChinese murder vans are state-run murder vans or these are freelancers know\n\n16:31.080 --> 16:38.120\nthat I think they're freelancers that are employed by like a house painter yeah\n\n16:38.120 --> 16:41.440\nright so I think their government run there they're like police like you might\n\n16:41.440 --> 16:45.440\nhave a like a paddy wagon but instead of they put you in the van then they kill\n\n16:45.440 --> 16:49.400\nyou and they kill you like bright bright handmade stale and I don't have\n\n16:49.400 --> 16:55.880\nbrights maids tail that's brights maids tail hand handmade revisited always a\n\n16:55.880 --> 17:01.560\nbrights maids tail so they just that this is a real thing I just driving\n\n17:01.560 --> 17:06.040\naround picking up people yeah wait right here's my here's my thing 27 dresses as\n\n17:06.040 --> 17:11.080\na brights maids tail you you see you see a murder van coming don't get in that van\n\n17:11.080 --> 17:15.880\noh yeah no they pull you in there I like the theory that a murder a Chinese\n\n17:15.880 --> 17:21.400\nmurder van is just a racist phrase for an ambulance the bad murder what was that\n\n17:21.400 --> 17:26.120\njoke what you had do we ever talk about yeah the racist joke yeah that all of\n\n17:26.120 --> 17:29.360\nthe Chinese things are backwards and all of the Mexican things are like just\n\n17:29.360 --> 17:33.520\ndiminished yeah yeah we've talked about that a lot you know you know look we\n\n17:33.520 --> 17:36.200\nalso have Steve Levy sitting in the booth with us doesn't that pretend that\n\n17:36.200 --> 17:39.600\nSteve Levy is not here I don't know but what aren't we trying to recreate the\n\n17:39.600 --> 17:44.800\nstage feel but like I think what you know I don't want to acknowledging Steve\n\n17:44.800 --> 17:49.040\nLevy but okay how about this I want the audience to know Steve Levy sitting here\n\n17:49.040 --> 17:52.400\nbut we're gonna still bring him out 40 yeah yeah cuz we're gonna try to play\n\n17:52.400 --> 17:55.480\nD&D later and which I think I could which I can only assume is gonna go a\n\n17:55.480 --> 18:02.400\nlot better dot dot dot question mark because I guess better meaning that\n\n18:02.400 --> 18:05.600\nwe're gonna find out that Jeff and I are bad at playing because it will be more\n\n18:05.600 --> 18:09.760\nlike the authentic stuff like nerd poker yeah on ear wolf where we're really just\n\n18:09.760 --> 18:14.880\nplaying D&D and there's no there's no way for us to fall back on but also you\n\n18:14.880 --> 18:19.920\nonly brought the one vodka and we don't have the bottle of vodka on this in in\n\n18:19.920 --> 18:23.520\nthe room however another advantage of this format is I can I can press pause\n\n18:23.520 --> 18:27.200\nwalk out get a drink and I could teleport to a state of drunkenness so\n\n18:27.200 --> 18:33.880\nextreme that you can shut the tape this podcast was designed to make you want to\n\n18:33.880 --> 18:38.000\nreach in and grab it yeah I mean I you know what's funny is I was just get I\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:44.960\nwas getting so I don't want to say the phrase sick of doing the live podcast\n\n18:44.960 --> 18:48.640\nbecause I don't want anybody that's been a fan to feel like like there's a\n\n18:48.640 --> 18:51.680\nbetrayal there or anything like that like we've been doing the podcast for a\n\n18:51.680 --> 18:56.560\nreally long time it's been a live show I just I'm just saying like I'm saying\n\n18:56.560 --> 18:59.360\nthis as a positive thing like I was getting to a place where I was really\n\n18:59.360 --> 19:03.720\nstarting to ask myself and this has been a slow build since November all of you\n\n19:03.720 --> 19:07.040\nlistening or probably you've had your own little transitional stories like\n\n19:07.040 --> 19:13.480\nwhere you're dealing with fucking shit which is and it's a like like part of\n\n19:13.480 --> 19:20.720\nmy thing was what is dinging to your iPad and associated smart devices let's\n\n19:20.720 --> 19:29.400\nget him on FaceTime Dan's FaceTiming Charles Manson my thing I kept I was\n\n19:29.400 --> 19:33.080\nstarting to ask myself like why am I doing this show because I'm not like I\n\n19:33.080 --> 19:39.200\nI grown sour on like oh this thing where I stand in front of a microphone and I\n\n19:39.200 --> 19:42.520\nkind of Kovach about how I don't want people to tell me to tie my shoes and I\n\n19:42.520 --> 19:45.600\nwish I was on the moon where no one could bother me and the streets shouldn't be\n\n19:45.600 --> 19:48.720\ncurvy they should be straight and all this stuff that was like it was it was\n\n19:48.720 --> 19:53.600\nworking really well and it was like it was working really well under a liberal\n\n19:53.600 --> 19:58.800\nbureaucratic technocratic like regime where everything was kind of great and\n\n19:58.800 --> 20:02.080\nI didn't have to acknowledge that it was great because I could be a rebel\n\n20:02.080 --> 20:07.240\nbecause everything was running in an orwellianly smooth way and but and yet\n\n20:07.240 --> 20:11.560\na very backward bureaucratically like absurd way so I could just decry life's\n\n20:11.560 --> 20:17.480\nabsurdities and society's a little intricate wrongdoings and things and\n\n20:17.480 --> 20:21.200\nand be a hero to myself and pat myself in the back and then the election\n\n20:21.200 --> 20:25.240\nhappens and all the women are crying and I'm like buying a gun and I'm like I'm\n\n20:25.240 --> 20:28.720\nlike and we're all worried that there's like Nazis in the streets and it's like\n\n20:28.720 --> 20:34.000\npolitics are now like real life they're as real to us as as our black friends are\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:37.480\ntelling us they've always been like or and our female friends are telling us\n\n20:37.480 --> 20:41.560\nand and and that intersects with all this talk that we were having blah blah blah\n\n20:41.560 --> 20:48.280\nblah all of that leads to me at 44 almost a year past November I I'm like\n\n20:48.280 --> 20:52.440\nwhy am I what why am I doing this show where I get up every week and I'm like\n\n20:52.440 --> 20:57.280\nbabbling into a microphone like I'm angry now and I'm fragile and I'm scared\n\n20:57.280 --> 21:01.440\nand all this stuff and but I was also going I've been doing this show for\n\n21:01.440 --> 21:08.120\nyears I would be a really stupid unhealthy person if I if I changed\n\n21:08.120 --> 21:12.200\nradically anything about something that had been building for five years and\n\n21:12.200 --> 21:19.000\ngrowing with you know in the span of anything less than six months you know\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:22.680\nlike being asking these questions over a period of weeks and weeks and weeks is\n\n21:22.680 --> 21:26.320\njust not enough so I just that's why I was kind of like I've been building in\n\n21:26.320 --> 21:31.040\nmy anxiety and and and like and showing up to these shows and you've heard me\n\n21:31.040 --> 21:35.600\nbeing like maybe you haven't picked up on it maybe you have but but like that I'm\n\n21:35.600 --> 21:39.720\nlike you know I just like sometimes I'm yelling at the audience sometimes I'm\n\n21:39.720 --> 21:43.280\nnot it was all manifestation of that thing and isn't it interesting how this\n\n21:43.280 --> 21:48.640\nshit then just happens like like now I feel now there's no audience here so I\n\n21:48.640 --> 21:53.360\ncan just talk about God and throw your shoe at your laptop all you want you\n\n21:53.360 --> 21:59.160\nyou beautiful atheists who we need to further our society but I I there's a\n\n21:59.160 --> 22:03.120\nit's like it just feels like the universe just kind of makes this shit\n\n22:03.120 --> 22:08.240\nhappen like I was kind of a sense of relief when I got texted that the\n\n22:08.240 --> 22:11.360\nfire marshal shut the show down because I was like oh that's gonna take a long\n\n22:11.360 --> 22:16.080\ntime to rectify we might have to do our show the way my favorite murder does it\n\n22:16.080 --> 22:20.280\nthe way Duncan Trussell does it this could be a really fun thing like this\n\n22:20.280 --> 22:25.080\ncould be a shot of vitamin B in the in the show's arm we can do different\n\n22:25.080 --> 22:29.120\nstuff with this now I don't know I mean you guys seem kind of stoked about it\n\n22:29.120 --> 22:34.200\nSpencer's look at that look at that big smiling face oh yeah well the truth is\n\n22:34.200 --> 22:39.000\nthat when you're in front of an audience if I look this blank everyone would be\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:43.000\nlike angry and confused and like what's up his ass but that's kind of my\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:47.800\nneutral face so now you know I'm free to just let it go and not like smile and\n\n22:47.800 --> 22:53.120\nnot occasionally to pretend that I'm like you know still with it and keeping\n\n22:53.120 --> 23:01.120\nup and doing the live show being a live podcast has its ups and downs like when\n\n23:01.120 --> 23:07.400\nthe show is good it awesome it often is because of the fact that there was a the\n\n23:07.400 --> 23:12.040\ncrowd interaction made it good but sometimes it suffers because of that\n\n23:12.040 --> 23:16.320\nlike it's not a guarantee that it makes it better or worse yeah I also kind of\n\n23:16.320 --> 23:20.880\nwonder because I had this dream of like moving from meltdown into the the the\n\n23:20.880 --> 23:25.480\ncastle and that we would then be able to do this like feedback loop that I was\n\n23:25.480 --> 23:28.480\nobsessed about where we could have people tweeting and then I can answer the\n\n23:28.480 --> 23:34.840\ntweets and you could show shit blah blah blah I like I thought it would I\n\n23:34.840 --> 23:38.080\nthought it would happen more automagically than than it did it turns out\n\n23:38.080 --> 23:41.160\nif I really want that to happen I have to start producing like a visual show and\n\n23:41.160 --> 23:43.560\nthe more visual it gets the more alienating it's good it would have\n\n23:43.560 --> 23:47.600\ngotten to our listeners etc so it there was a lot of incentive or non incentive\n\n23:47.600 --> 23:52.240\nto not move in that direction once we got to the new venue so it starts to\n\n23:52.240 --> 23:55.840\noccur to me as we're sitting here I'm like well yeah pump out your audio\n\n23:55.840 --> 24:02.240\npodcast and we'll and we can Howard Stern it Joe Rogan it by bringing the\n\n24:02.240 --> 24:06.960\nlivestream cameras in here isn't that more valuable to people and can't you do\n\n24:06.960 --> 24:10.640\nall the shit that I'm talking about where you go hey if you're watching you\n\n24:10.640 --> 24:15.160\nknow I remember when Howard Stern it is a show it's like you just have cameras we\n\n24:15.160 --> 24:18.920\ncould even make them permanently like mounted up in here and use them when we\n\n24:18.920 --> 24:23.480\nwant to great proof son on smartest man in the world podcast he does a lot of\n\n24:23.480 --> 24:29.240\nlive shows and then he does just like audio from his like house or wherever he\n\n24:29.240 --> 24:33.720\nis like if he's in a hotel room from the other the fortress of\n\n24:33.720 --> 24:40.480\npropitude or he calls it the purpose of furtitude and I like the change I like\n\n24:40.480 --> 24:44.320\nsometimes hearing the crowd but sometimes the lives shows have bad\n\n24:44.320 --> 24:47.760\naudio and they're kind of crap because like the technical difficulties and\n\n24:47.760 --> 24:53.240\nsometimes I just like hearing Greg just monologue into a microphone yeah and a\n\n24:53.240 --> 24:56.040\ncontrolled environment I think is we got more comfortable in here anyways\n\n24:56.040 --> 24:59.240\nwhatever don't start freaking out oh I hope they don't do this I hope that\n\n24:59.240 --> 25:03.160\nwe're obviously we're gonna do what feels right but I'm just I'm just I'm\n\n25:03.160 --> 25:08.480\njust sharing my current I'm I think this is I think it's cool this is the\n\n25:08.480 --> 25:12.840\nright time for a change to come along for me whether it's temporary permanent\n\n25:12.840 --> 25:18.600\nor or it causes some kind of weird vision where we have the podcast but then\n\n25:18.600 --> 25:24.680\nyou know when we do have live shows Los Angeles or not then we dive into the\n\n25:24.680 --> 25:30.240\nprivilege of okay it's gonna be a live show we're gonna have slides and yeah\n\n25:30.240 --> 25:35.280\ncartoons and fucking tap dances and so make make a dog tricks make the live\n\n25:35.280 --> 25:40.280\nshows more event-based and say there's a reason we're doing it charge 20 bucks a\n\n25:40.280 --> 25:44.480\nticket and give it to Planned Parenthood and you do you have one show all you\n\n25:44.480 --> 25:53.400\nyou invite only fire marshals that is that is that Steve isn't that called a\n\n25:53.400 --> 25:57.440\nminion if there's if there's at least nine fire marshals we can we can create\n\n25:57.440 --> 26:06.640\nwe could rewrite fire fire code yeah oh shit Steve Levyme thanks for having\n\n26:06.640 --> 26:12.000\nme applause break can you guys talk to Steve Levyme while I go get a drink\n\n26:12.000 -->

marshal shut the thing down and then you had to you and\n\n27:12.920 --> 27:19.600\nwho Brian from Nolan who really champ was a champion and Kris Boruff off yeah\n\n27:19.600 --> 27:25.840\nand so you guys had at midnight had to find a new venue oh go scouting for that\n\n27:25.840 --> 27:32.920\nyeah but it was yeah after we got shut down we figured try to figure out what\n\n27:32.920 --> 27:37.000\nwe can do we had a lot of conversations Nolan and Chris had a deal with the\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:43.480\ncastle stuff I contacted our whole team for ricking Morty to see because

expensive and time-consuming\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:07.520\nmove yeah I mean what do you do when you lose your venue less than 24 hours from\n\n28:07.520 --> 28:16.600\nshow time and you have an entire set you have to move so yeah we thank him\n\n28:16.600 --> 28:22.080\nbearing gifts like you know first person I call was Jen Roskin who is an amazing\n\n28:22.080 --> 28:29.360\nproducer here at

nap on a someone sofa he's not a\n\n29:20.200 --> 29:26.840\nloafer he's just a little sleepy from his job I mean he's the kind of guy that\n\n29:26.840 --> 29:32.720\nworks hard he makes him like a glass shot he's the kind of leavey who's a\n\n29:32.720 --> 29:39.320\nsleepy old leavey he's no don't try to tell him to work less just he's worth\n\n29:39.320 --> 29:44.920\nless without his job he's got no family no for any listeners that thought that\n\n29:44.920 --> 29:48.440\nDan's freestyle abilities would suffer from not having the energy of a live\n\n29:48.440 --> 29:53.080\naudience I think we found out that right and Phil Collins your check is on the\n\n29:53.080 --> 30:02.440\nway so yeah how's that have you recovered emotionally from the girl\n\n30:02.440 --> 30:08.840\nsituation yeah I mean still going I'm just no I yeah no I don't know I'm I had\n\n30:08.840 --> 30:16.360\na lot of work fires that really took a lot out and the last couple days were\n\n30:16.360 --> 30:22.920\nhorrible because of the Vegas thing and Tom Petty yeah real hard things getting\n\n30:22.920 --> 30:26.360\ndark and to the point where the new story is how dark things have gotten like\n\n30:26.360 --> 30:33.400\nlike and not in a cool way like I feel like now like it because we can't\n\n30:33.400 --> 30:38.400\ncommunicate effectively or honestly with ourselves as a nation about about how\n\n30:38.400 --> 30:44.920\nworthless human life has become we are now like the mainstream media not to\n\n30:44.920 --> 30:50.160\nsound like a fucking jag off living in the woods but the mainstream media\n\n30:50.160 --> 30:59.040\nthe lamestream pity poop I noticed maybe this is a refraction or a factor is a\n\n30:59.040 --> 31:03.080\ndistortion in some way but I now this is what I'm feeling as I'm looking at the\n\n31:03.080 --> 31:08.240\nnews when I if I just type Las Vegas after I hear about this shooting I see\n\n31:08.240 --> 31:14.480\nwhat I see is a nation that immediately is just talking about talking about it\n\n31:14.480 --> 31:21.080\nwhich is really disturbing to me that that it it's like we immediately leapt\n\n31:21.080 --> 31:27.840\nto how many famous women are responding inappropriately which is like it has\n\n31:27.840 --> 31:31.640\nbecome the new theme like like we're like we're almost verging on some kind of\n\n31:31.640 --> 31:38.680\nthis Australian gender gap where we don't we like we wait for that if you're a\n\n31:38.680 --> 31:43.120\nwoman and you have a voice like now we've just gotten so like when the rubber\n\n31:43.120 --> 31:47.360\nhits the road we just want you to shut the fuck up like like 58 people died and\n\n31:47.360 --> 31:51.280\nthis maybe it's a coincidence maybe these are all just coincidentally female\n\n31:51.280 --> 31:54.160\npeople but if you're female politician you're a female comedian female comedy\n\n31:54.160 --> 31:58.160\nwriter it seems like you couldn't say anything right about any of this which\n\n31:58.160 --> 32:01.120\nis really disturbing to me because it seems like the alternative to responding\n\n32:01.120 --> 32:06.320\ninappropriately to it to a breaking a world record for massacres after we have\n\n32:06.320 --> 32:11.440\nalready decided that 20 kindergartners who have hearts the size of a bullet it\n\n32:11.440 --> 32:17.000\nwasn't enough you know do you really how long do you expect people to maintain\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:22.240\ntheir the the the the gears and valves that it takes to bow your head and take\n\n32:22.240 --> 32:28.600\na moment of silence when human life is wasted like like and then and then the\n\n32:28.600 --> 32:31.800\nunconscious answer to that which really terrifies me is oh they don't expect\n\n32:31.800 --> 32:35.840\nanything they want this to be like carousel and Logan's run like they want\n\n32:35.840 --> 32:40.600\nit to be a ritual where we keep sacrificing human life and then we keep\n\n32:40.600 --> 32:45.200\non and then it's like who's gonna fart first who's gonna break the silence\n\n32:45.200 --> 32:50.040\nlet's all bow our heads and hum the national anthem quietly while we talk\n\n32:50.040 --> 32:54.360\nabout how our thoughts and prayers are happening and then the moment a Saturday\n\n32:54.360 --> 33:00.600\nnight live writer off duty on Twitter or a female senator or it you know a\n\n33:00.600 --> 33:05.320\nprofessional tweeter or blogger says something that is effective because\n\n33:05.320 --> 33:10.240\nmaybe it's satirical maybe it's biting maybe it's a little inconvenient to hear\n\n33:10.240 --> 33:17.600\nhowever long after the final bullet expends another American life that that\n\n33:17.600 --> 33:23.400\nhappens then we then then we get to tie that person to a stake and shame them\n\n33:23.400 --> 33:29.040\nlike and poor gasoline all over their feet and play with matches and like it\n\n33:29.040 --> 33:33.480\njust like it's not I'm not trying to wait night like like I just I do happen to\n\n33:33.480 --> 33:37.840\nnotice that it's it always seems to be women I just that's a call that a side\n\n33:37.840 --> 33:44.320\norder of intersectionality or whatever but like I'm overall so fucking deeply\n\n33:44.320 --> 33:48.240\ntroubled by the numbness that I felt when I heard about this and then the and\n\n33:48.240 --> 33:53.880\nthen the data that hit my eyeballs when I googled it and how the theme seemed to\n\n33:53.880 --> 34:00.000\nbe that we were being chastised by our own technocracy for responding\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:04.840\ninappropriately whether it was not responding at all or responding with\n\n34:04.840 --> 34:10.280\nbiting went to responding with political pleas to please stop this I can't\n\n34:10.280 --> 34:14.200\nbelieve we're still having this conversation I can't believe people have\n\n34:14.200 --> 34:19.680\nthe balls to say I know three minutes after the last shell casing hits the\n\n34:19.680 --> 34:25.440\nfloor is not too soon to talk about fucking gun control you fucking heartless\n\n34:25.440 --> 34:29.640\npiece of shit like I don't care if the families of the victims want to wait a\n\n34:29.640 --> 34:33.080\nhundred years to talk about anything they're the families of the victims\n\n34:33.080 --> 34:37.760\nthat's not that's not who we are we're a nation who has its heart broken\n\n34:37.760 --> 34:42.960\nhow about this is way too many years after Sandy Hook to talk about fucking\n\n34:42.960 --> 34:47.600\ngun control I'm a gun owner I still want to talk about it do you want my gun\n\n34:47.600 --> 34:53.800\nback like like like let's talk about it like like the gun sales go up when these\n\n34:53.800 --> 34:58.080\nmassacres happen that is such a mind fuck even if you're not politically\n\n34:58.080 --> 35:01.160\nmotivated forget about red sides and blue sides that's us that's such a\n\n35:01.160 --> 35:07.720\nphilosophical mind fuck gun stocks like this boomed gun sales like imagine like\n\n35:07.720 --> 35:15.760\nso 9 9 11 didn't cause skyscraper sales to go up it's this is like a unique\n\n35:15.760 --> 35:20.120\ndisease we have and it's really frightening how logical it is that\n\n35:20.120 --> 35:24.560\neveryone keeps erupting into these mass shootings and then every time a mass\n\n35:24.560 --> 35:29.000\nshooting happens everyone runs out and buys guns because they're afraid that\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:33.440\nguns will become illegal because someone used them bad again the day before\n\n35:33.440 --> 35:39.400\nthe what was the Vegas thing on Saturday Sunday Sunday so on Saturday\n\n35:39.400 --> 35:43.280\nwhatever the day before the event was I've been to that festival because Chip\n\n35:43.280 --> 35:47.640\nEstin my friend has played that festival before and I was backstage and hung out\n\n35:47.640 --> 35:52.080\nand it was really fun met a bunch of people met Jason Aldean and this guy\n\n35:52.080 --> 35:55.840\nnamed Jay Jackson his a guitar player in that band he had texted me the day\n\n35:55.840 --> 35:59.800\nbefore saying hey we're doing that festival root 91 harvest festival do\n\n35:59.800 --> 36:03.240\nyou want to come out and I'll get your tickets as though I can't I have a thing\n\n36:03.240 --> 36:09.600\nto go to and the next day that happened and it was his band that was on stage\n\n36:09.600 --> 36:14.080\nwhen the bullets were flying and I text him and said how you doing and he goes\n\n36:14.080 --> 36:18.800\nwhere he said we were on stage when the bullets were peppering the stage and we\n\n36:18.800 --> 36:23.520\nall had to dive off the back or to the side to hide and then run during the\n\n36:23.520 --> 36:26.880\npauses that this guy was taking while either reloading or whatever he's doing\n\n36:26.880 --> 36:32.320\nand they all made it out alright but like and then church your sister what\n\n36:32.320 --> 36:41.240\nlike that has a best friend you know who got my my sister's friend was at the\n\n36:41.240 --> 36:46.800\nshow with her friends and they all ran and I guess they flagged down a car and\n\n36:46.800 --> 36:51.600\nthis person was nice enough to just drive them all all the way home and when\n\n36:51.600 --> 36:55.360\nshe got home it was only then that she realized that she was covered in someone\n\n36:55.360 --> 37:01.840\nelse's blood so you have to think of how close she must have been to actually\n\n37:01.840 --> 37:06.280\ngetting hit because she was near enough to someone who was to have that blood\n\n37:06.280 --> 37:11.800\nsplatter on her and everyone's just so disturbed by that it's a nauseating\n\n37:11.800 --> 37:16.480\nthought I thought well because I wonder how many of those fatalities are\n\n37:16.480 --> 37:22.120\ntrampling yeah I think a lot I mean if you've ever seen that well whatever I\n\n37:22.120 --> 37:26.960\nsaw a photo I saw like a slide photo thing on Reuters of the images of it\n\n37:26.960 --> 37:31.920\nand there are people hiding and it's the exact same tent area that I would have\n\n37:31.920 --> 37:36.760\nbeen in like that where the where I know I would have been if I were at that\n\n37:36.760 --> 37:40.200\nshow and that does not mean making it about me but like I did just because I\n\n37:40.200 --> 37:45.360\ncan physically picture the layout there there's no way out because you're\n\n37:45.360 --> 37:49.280\nfenced in there and there's only a couple exits because they want to control\n\n37:49.280 --> 37:53.560\nthe comings and goings there so there really was nowhere for people to go as\n\n37:53.560 --> 37:58.280\nfar as I can imagine because I remember trying to go out and get somebody in\n\n37:58.280 --> 38:02.880\nthere's only a couple little like small egresses there yeah well that's a\n\n38:02.880 --> 38:07.640\nthat's a theme with terrorism it's like you know they're taking advantage of of\n\n38:07.640 --> 38:12.000\nof slaughterhouse like environments created by capital but then it wasn't\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:15.320\nterrorist because he was a white guy he's a lone wolf he's not he can't be a\n\n38:15.320 --> 38:19.440\nterrorist and by the way it makes me crazy just want to pause in our in our\n\n38:19.440 --> 38:23.800\ndialogue to address the the folks out there that are going oh I thought this\n\n38:23.800 --> 38:29.000\nwould be the podcast that didn't talk about this hey how about this topic suck\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:35.600\nmy dick fucking jag off like fuck you and I can't say kill yourself because\n\n38:35.600 --> 38:40.160\nit's too much fucking death but like fuck off into the night and suck suck your\n\n38:40.160 --> 38:44.800\nown balls and fucking until they fall off and roll down a hill and fucking end\n\n38:44.800 --> 38:48.120\nup in a steamer trunk and just leave me alone out of my life with your fucking\n\n38:48.120 --> 38:51.600\njudgment get out of my head you're not entitled to anything you do nothing\n\n38:51.600 --> 38:56.560\nyou're you're a fucking jerk you're a piece of shit you're a fucking garbage\n\n38:56.560 --> 39:01.040\nperson you you you how why are you listening to my podcast and then and\n\n39:01.040 --> 39:04.760\nthen picking and choosing what you like and don't like about it fuck you I\n\n39:04.760 --> 39:08.080\nalready have my older brother's voice in my head I have the voice of every\n\n39:08.080 --> 39:12.200\nfucking bully on the playground I fucking I I I come out here to Los\n\n39:12.200 --> 39:17.600\nAngeles I I do the hard work of becoming a fat blowhard that owns a\n\n39:17.600 --> 39:23.080\nmicrophone and and you know how hard it is for me to spout nonsense into a\n\n39:23.080 --> 39:28.560\nmicrophone without having to think about your judgment I I'm a I'm a I'm a\n\n39:28.560 --> 39:44.440\ntroubled man that was the weirdest sports corner I've ever done I don't know I\n\n39:44.440 --> 39:47.840\nthought don't you feel compelled to have like a little like like they add like\n\n39:47.840 --> 39:52.080\nlike I said because it's like are you worried that like as with the D&D\n\n39:52.080 --> 39:55.760\nsegment that though that will play that it's like the absence of the audience\n\n39:55.760 --> 39:59.840\nit feels simultaneously refreshing and also like oh shit are we a creature\n\n39:59.840 --> 40:04.480\nthat was breathing audience water and like then when you put us in this\n\n40:04.480 --> 40:09.560\nterrarium out of our aquarium like now we look like a floppy weird it's like\n\n40:09.560 --> 40:13.360\neveryone's gonna notice that we are boring the only thing that's disturbing\n\n40:13.360 --> 40:16.760\nme is that Spencer is exactly the same he hasn't changed it he's been through\n\n40:16.760 --> 40:19.920\njust sits there that would be amazing if I just like leaned back and I was made\n\n40:19.920 --> 40:27.040\nout of cardboard but you like it more now you said which is kind of\n\n40:27.040 --> 40:29.640\nsurprising I could have thought it would be the other way around where Spencer\n\n40:29.640 --> 40:33.840\nsitting there thinking realizing he's going oh man my deadpan thing like it\n\n40:33.840 --> 40:37.800\nit really works in front of an audience and now I now I'm just a guy that's not\n\n40:37.800 --> 40:42.440\nsaying anything but you like not saying anything and what you don't like is the\n\n40:42.440 --> 40:46.240\nfeeling feeling pressured to say things and you feel more pressured in front of\n\n40:46.240 --> 40:51.840\nan audience right that's one of the competing theories at the moment Steve\n\n40:51.840 --> 40:56.720\njust walked out yeah what does that mean our entire audience just left you\n\n40:56.720 --> 41:03.160\ntake a giant shit when he gets back let's let's let's play a lot of D&D but\n\n41:03.160 --> 41:07.360\nlike let's really get a good hunk of D&D sure sure like let me know whatever man\n\n41:07.360 --> 41:10.800\nI'm still mad at that guy that didn't want us to talk about the shooting what\n\n41:10.800 --> 41:15.160\nguy the guy that's still contacting you no I'm he's in my head the guy in your\n\n41:15.160 --> 41:19.240\nhead now well if the guy in your head is telling you that that's you telling\n\n41:19.240 --> 41:23.440\nyourself that no it's the part of me it's the part of me that's an unemployed\n\n41:23.440 --> 41:28.920\nflannel-wearing golden retriever owner in the middle of America that is calls\n\n41:28.920 --> 41:35.440\nhimself a graphic designer but really is just a freelance douchebag and who\n\n41:35.440 --> 41:42.440\nsits and listens to the podcast while he masturbates which is a weird move but\n\n41:42.440 --> 41:48.920\nand kind of poodles around on like mind-maps after you know what it's me it's\n\n41:48.920 --> 41:52.840\nme I just described me it's just too hot to refuel masturbate while listening to\n\n41:52.840 --> 41:56.600\nHarmontown and I have a golden doodle I like I changed only what he doesn't have\n\n41:56.600 --> 42:02.000\nto Harmontown is masturbation that's sort of what's so weird about it is me I\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:04.920\ndon't know I'm picturing a really specific dude that's like he's got one\n\n42:04.920 --> 42:08.800\ntattoo okay and it's like because he's like because he's like just a little\n\n42:08.800 --> 42:13.040\nmore back around the back of the shoulder now forearm top of the forearm and\n\n42:13.040 --> 42:18.280\nit's like a tribally thing and and he and he's any any really rough houses with\n\n42:18.280 --> 42:22.320\nhis dog like like he doesn't like punches his dog well he just like wrestles\n\n42:22.320 --> 42:26.840\nwith it like the dog thinks he's a dog and and and he like throws it like raw\n\n42:26.840 --> 42:30.760\nmeat and shit and like like tries to take it from them they both eat the raw\n\n42:30.760 --> 42:36.320\nmeat in their backyard and he he owns a snowmobile and he like I don't know he\n\n42:36.320 --> 42:39.880\njust and then and then if you're talking is he in a snowy region or is it\n\n42:39.880 --> 42:44.560\nyeah he's just eccentric he lives in a place he likes to take it up to Big Bear\n\n42:44.560 --> 42:47.480\nif he lives somewhere warm because he maybe came somewhere warm because he\n\n42:47.480 --> 42:50.960\ndecided in the tundra that he lives in that he's a graphic designer so he came\n\n42:50.960 --> 42:54.440\nto LA maybe brought his snowmobile because he likes to go up to Big Bear but\n\n42:54.440 --> 42:59.920\nhe he like he's it's just like he loves beer he loves like 900 different kinds\n\n42:59.920 --> 43:03.440\nof beer thinks that beer is like a thing that you should experience every\n\n43:03.440 --> 43:08.760\ndifferent kind of flavor of and then and that's fine that's all good but when\n\n43:08.760 --> 43:11.720\nyou if you go to his public house that he likes to drink at and then once he\n\n43:11.720 --> 43:15.040\ngets three beers in him he starts he starts saying some fucked up libertarian\n\n43:15.040 --> 43:21.080\nshit that you're like you kind of like bite your lip and go like yeah because\n\n43:21.080 --> 43:24.000\nyou don't want to argue with him right but he's like just he's just like\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:29.960\nthrowing out like like like at the top of his brain he's like he's like making\n\n43:29.960 --> 43:34.600\nthese observations about like how all lives should matter instead of just the\n\n43:34.600 --> 43:40.560\nblack lives and you just kind of like how did I end up drinking with you am I\n\n43:40.560 --> 43:45.640\ngetting hard I'm getting heartburn from this beer and you suck you fucking suck\n\n43:45.640 --> 43:48.560\nI just know we're never gonna get along you know like and I'm gonna end up\n\n43:48.560 --> 43:51.880\nauditioning for you and I'm gonna slowly slide into your ideology because I\n\n43:51.880 --> 43:55.800\ncan recognize the logic behind it but I don't feel it myself I don't want to I\n\n43:55.800 --> 44:02.080\ndon't want to talk to you you're too bro-y so stop listening to my podcast man\n\n44:02.080 --> 44:06.680\nlike like we're listening to it if you're that guy but like everything when\n\n44:06.680 --> 44:11.120\nyou listen to me just like just how could that guy listen to this podcast I\n\n44:11.120 --> 44:16.560\nmean like how likely is that because he's not totally stupid and he likes\n\n44:16.560 --> 44:20.480\nsmart stuff or something I don't know and like we're not like bleeding heart\n\n44:20.480 --> 44:24.640\nwhatever is like but that's what he that's why he's hated the podcast since\n\n44:24.640 --> 44:28.200\nNovember because then now I'm starting to sound like all the shit that he hates\n\n44:28.200 --> 44:32.360\nbecause I now I'm like freaked out because I used to be a full-blown\n\n44:32.360 --> 44:37.600\nanarchist and now I'm now I'm like a Democrat basically because I gave for\n\n44:37.600 --> 44:40.400\nthe time being because I can't because that's the lever I keep pulling because\n\n44:40.400 --> 44:44.520\nI'm so scared of fascism I just keep pulling the lever that says don't let\n\n44:44.520 --> 44:49.120\nfascists win so and that's like that's the fucking system man that's the game\n\n44:49.120 --> 44:54.120\nand that which is what I used to say so if if I have four years of my podcast\n\n44:54.120 --> 44:58.320\nI have dudes like that that like started to like build up like I don't I'm not I\n\n44:58.320 --> 45:01.480\nshouldn't be surprised but I'm just saying like let's have a reckoning here\n\n45:01.480 --> 45:06.360\nguys like if you're that dog wrestling dude and you feel that way like you don't\n\n45:06.360 --> 45:11.960\nhave to leave or stay but like can you do me the favor of of like looking at at\n\n45:11.960 --> 45:18.920\nat your time with me as the inverse of when you go to the gym with in other\n\n45:18.920 --> 45:23.400\nwords like this is your you should be more of a pussy time like like like like\n\n45:23.400 --> 45:28.520\nlike where you just like exercise your pussy like like like like where you\n\n45:28.520 --> 45:32.760\nacquiesce a little bit more because I'm going through a fucking crisis about\n\n45:32.760 --> 45:36.720\nthis shit and I you've probably noticed I try to be honest about the fact I don't\n\n45:36.720 --> 45:41.600\nknow what I'm talking about and then I'm I'm a lazy and and hypocritical and\n\n45:41.600 --> 45:47.240\nand and and whatever like I'm not I'm not I'm not ever gonna like decide what\n\n45:47.240 --> 45:51.680\nthe truth is and start barking it at you I'm just like always saying like this is\n\n45:51.680 --> 45:56.320\nwhere I'm at at this moment I could you take that ride with me without without\n\n45:56.320 --> 46:00.840\nthis fucking thing that drives me nuts that's all in my head I guess of like\n\n46:00.840 --> 46:05.360\nnow I don't like this podcast like like this idea that the podcast exists in\n\n46:05.360 --> 46:09.520\nsome dichotomy of like well that was good now it's bad like I can't fucking\n\n46:09.520 --> 46:13.320\nhandle thinking like that then you're just Sony and then I want to fucking beat\n\n46:13.320 --> 46:17.760\nyou with a bat and I just want to let you know how much I hate you because for\n\n46:17.760 --> 46:21.400\nmy own integrity sake for the same reason ironically that you wrestle your\n\n46:21.400 --> 46:25.720\ndog and don't like me because you don't want to be told what to do okay great so\n\n46:25.720 --> 46:29.920\nlike minus your dumb tattoo that you got like like we're basically the same\n\n46:29.920 --> 46:33.440\nflabby fucking blowhard assholes you could probably beat me up in a fight you\n\n46:33.440 --> 46:39.480\nknow how to use a knife but you know what if you cut me scorpions come out is\n\n46:39.480 --> 46:42.560\nthat true yeah that's a little that's not a metaphor if you ever seen the\n\n46:42.560 --> 46:47.080\noriginal clash of the Titans like if you fucking cut me bro scorpions are gonna\n\n46:47.080 --> 46:55.080\ncome out of me giant ones but my blood will make giant how giant giant enough\n\n46:55.080 --> 46:59.040\nto fit inside you know they start small watch class of the Titans the original\n\n46:59.040 --> 47:04.320\nright and they get bigger with Harry Hamlin as Perseus if you my blood if my\n\n47:04.320 --> 47:08.120\nblood hits the ground little tiny scorpions form that then quickly grow\n\n47:08.120 --> 47:14.640\nthrough the miracle of green screen to the size of mammoth if you cut me little\n\n47:14.640 --> 47:19.040\nBurgess Meredith come out that's you know I'd like to talk about that is that\n\n47:19.040 --> 47:24.120\nfrom Rocky no Burgess Meredith isn't Clash of the Titans oh yeah but he okay\n\n47:24.120 --> 47:27.880\nthat's weird that his character whatever his character is from Clash of the\n\n47:27.880 --> 47:32.400\nTitans right but they're like a bunch of little Burgess Meredith and Toga's come\n\n47:32.400 --> 47:35.880\nout of me but they don't get bigger so the character that you represent like I\n\n47:35.880 --> 47:40.280\nguess I'm characterizing myself as that guy a cerebus sir sir sir sir and not\n\n47:40.280 --> 47:44.640\nCerebus yes Cerberus or something like that like as a close because he's the\n\n47:44.640 --> 47:49.280\nguy with the tail yeah he got he gets turned like so I found an icon of that\n\n47:49.280 --> 47:53.160\nmovie and you're saying well whatever guy you are we don't know who it is but\n\n47:53.160 --> 47:56.840\nwe know he didn't get cut in the movie now he's kind of like the Obi-Wan Kenobi\n\n47:56.840 --> 48:00.440\nMentori guy oh wait a minute I'm sorry now there's a couple 45 year old people\n\n48:00.440 --> 48:03.800\nthrowing their shoes at the laptop because I just realized that guy is the\n\n48:03.800 --> 48:08.160\none who stabs it's them I'm the Medusa the Medusa's blood is what makes the\n\n48:08.160 --> 48:12.400\nscorpions I believe oh yeah so it's been a long time so whoever you are you might\n\n48:12.400 --> 48:15.440\nbe the Kraken for all we know maybe when you cut the Kraken Burgess Meredith\n\n48:15.440 --> 48:20.400\ncome out we don't know because we're a little metal owls that's only the three\n\n48:20.400 --> 48:23.400\nthings I remember that movie there was a Medusa there was a three-headed thing\n\n48:23.400 --> 48:27.720\nand then there was the metal owl and then Burgess Meredith and then from what I\n\n48:27.720 --> 48:32.720\nheard of the reboot in the reboot of Clash of the Titans they're going through\n\n48:32.720 --> 48:38.520\na trunk and one of the things that they pull out while they're throwing garbage\n\n48:38.520 --> 48:41.520\naround is a little clockwork owl and the guy looks at it and goes like what's\n\n48:41.520 --> 48:46.880\nthis garbage what's this shit for real fuck this garbage and he like shits on\n\n48:46.880 --> 48:50.480\nit and like rubs the shit into the eyes and then pisses on it and to wash the\n\n48:50.480 --> 48:54.360\nshit out but then like throws it in a river that's harsh and you're supposed\n\n48:54.360 --> 49:00.600\nto be like that's amazing because you're a fan of Clash of the Titans and you\n\n49:00.600 --> 49:05.640\nhate the clockwork owl I don't I knew we'll never understand that I know we've\n\n49:05.640 --> 49:08.520\ntalked about that before but like at the end of the Lone Ranger movie where it's\n\n49:08.520 --> 49:13.800\nlike he's like hi ho and time to goes don't dumb um here's some other don'ts\n\n49:13.800 --> 49:18.440\ndon't fucking rewrite don't take the job rewriting this movie if you hate like\n\n49:18.440 --> 49:22.400\nwhat the fuck is your problem I was eating a pastrami sandwich in New York\n\n49:22.400 --> 49:26.800\nwhen I was a kid at stage deli and I'm having my pastrami sandwich and I'm you\n\n49:26.800 --> 49:30.440\nknow 10 or 11 years old fucking Burgess Meredith walks by me down the\n\n49:30.440 --> 49:36.360\nstreet and I like I yelled out loud into a restaurant Clash of the Titans he\n\n49:36.360 --> 49:40.320\ncouldn't hear it all people do is it's a love real just yelling out a name of a\n\n49:40.320 --> 49:46.360\nmovie and no one saw that Burgess Meredith was going by then like the day\n\n49:46.360 --> 49:50.960\nbefore or the day after we saw Richard Geer walking down the road and I could\n\n49:50.960 --> 49:58.320\nhear my mom ovulate like I should just like oh Cody got her period during an\n\n49:58.320 --> 50:06.480\nAndy DeFranco set Lilith Fair Lilith Fair you mean her first period yeah her\n\n50:06.480 --> 50:09.840\nfriend yeah she became a woman she dropped her first egg I don't know if\n\n50:09.840 --> 50:16.360\nthat's accurate but that's how she shed her first she got her period like yeah\n\n50:16.360 --> 50:21.200\nshe she transitioned from girlhood to womanhood during an Andy DeFranco song\n\n50:21.200 --> 50:25.160\nthere's a girl I knew I went to high school with that she's her first orgasm\n\n50:25.160 --> 50:31.680\nwas like at 12 or 13 years old at a Prince concert she was with her mother\n\n50:31.680 --> 50:35.840\nor father or both and she was standing and she goes I didn't know it was\n\n50:35.840 --> 50:40.320\nhappening to me I was watching this man perform and she realized later on just\n\n50:40.320 --> 50:46.160\noh no like I came all right like she had a full-on Prince induced mind orgasm\n\n50:46.160 --> 50:50.480\nbecause it's like yeah I got I almost have an orgasm when I watch Prince like\n\n50:50.480 --> 50:55.200\nhe's fucking amazing there is an article about Prince when he died that where it\n\n50:55.200 --> 51:03.680\nwas like what I think it was like from the point of view of trans what do you\n\n51:03.680 --> 51:06.680\nwhat do you call it you can still call them drag queens right that's not yeah\n\n51:06.680 --> 51:10.160\nlike I think it was like but I can't remember that part I can't remember but\n\n51:10.160 --> 51:16.840\nI was like sort of performers who who worked within the the the the flux the\n\n51:16.840 --> 51:22.840\nthe outer edges of the binary world the heteronormative sphere and but they were\n\n51:22.840 --> 51:29.120\ntalking about like how Prince was this song that you know Prince was music that\n\n51:29.120 --> 51:32.680\nlike no matter what the song was it was always this song like Prince was\n\n51:32.680 --> 51:36.840\nspecialized the sonic waves that came from a Prince song were perfect at\n\n51:36.840 --> 51:42.480\nturning straight straight people by okay like it was like like if you were on the\n\n51:42.480 --> 51:46.400\nedge if you were curious like the thing that would that would get you every time\n\n51:46.400 --> 51:51.160\nwas like the Prince was making this music by intention or not unconsciously that\n\n51:51.160 --> 51:55.160\nthat was the energy there's one that wasn't a sole purpose in the world but\n\n51:55.160 --> 51:59.000\nthat that was like something that was kind of known to DJs and strippers and\n\n51:59.000 --> 52:04.040\nthings that sounds like Catholic propaganda well I mean yeah but but but\n\n52:04.040 --> 52:08.440\nthis was from a place of like these are people who are like thankful for those\n\n52:08.440 --> 52:14.360\nproperties they're like we could really put this to some use yeah Prince could\n\n52:14.360 --> 52:21.200\nsing the straightaway I mean he definitely yeah I remember what my\n\n52:21.200 --> 52:24.720\nbrother was five years old doing me and like so in the 80s like the androgynous\n\n52:24.720 --> 52:29.080\nrevolution started to happen in pop boy George and Prince and and even heavy\n\n52:29.080 --> 52:33.080\nmetal like if you could tell whether you were a boy or a girl it was like a\n\n52:33.080 --> 52:37.160\nlittle bit to your discredit you know like you you really needed to be like\n\n52:37.160 --> 52:41.680\nthat if the mad the more you were more masculine if you were like more like\n\n52:41.680 --> 52:44.880\nyeah there was more makeup and hairspray and high heels and yeah Motley\n\n52:44.880 --> 52:49.320\ncrew kind of took or like poison rather they kind of took it to the extreme is\n\n52:49.320 --> 52:52.800\nlike okay like you're going out of your way to be fake drag queens but I gotta\n\n52:52.800 --> 52:55.440\nconfess because my brother was five years older than me so I was a kid and I\n\n52:55.440 --> 52:58.200\nwas so I was like ten years old when that was happening it was a little\n\n52:58.200 --> 53:01.800\nintimidating to me that was too much sexuality for me it was sexuality I\n\n53:01.800 --> 53:05.600\ndidn't even know what sex I mean I knew what sex was sex was Pam Dabber from\n\n53:05.600 --> 53:12.960\nmore work in Mindy sex was Penny from Inspector Gadget I was her age it sex\n\n53:12.960 --> 53:18.960\nwas like it was you know Linda Sheenbuffner you actually there was a\n\n53:18.960 --> 53:24.640\nrousal because of Penny from Inspector Gadget no alright come on can we put a\n\n53:24.640 --> 53:30.160\npin on that it's a yes or no question I was yeah dude I was like well I was\n\n53:30.160 --> 53:34.880\nthinking I was when I when I was like 11 years old I I hit this transition where\n\n53:34.880 --> 53:38.360\nI started thinking of everything sexually like I one of my most common\n\n53:38.360 --> 53:42.520\nfancies I would like a hump a pillow and think of myself as being Skeletor\n\n53:42.520 --> 53:51.000\nand thinking about fucking either Tila or She-Ra from the He-Man averse I guess\n\n53:51.000 --> 53:54.640\nbecause he was a monster and like maybe because I would have I had like these\n\n53:54.640 --> 53:58.520\nblue pajamas that were really tight because I had like I was sprouting so\n\n53:58.520 --> 54:01.880\nbecause I was going through puberty so I think the blue pajama bottoms that were\n\n54:01.880 --> 54:06.240\nbasically becoming tights because they were so small like they were made for a\n\n54:06.240 --> 54:09.480\nlittle boy and I was becoming a man so I was like hulking out through my blue\n\n54:09.480 --> 54:13.280\npajamas so I and I something about like I had talked about this where it's like I\n\n54:13.280 --> 54:18.480\nI didn't want to touch myself but I was like getting so into like so I was just\n\n54:18.480 --> 54:22.160\nhumping everything and so there was like I but then I'm also part of that was like\n\n54:22.160 --> 54:25.760\nI didn't want to do it with my dick out so then I was like where these pajamas\n\n54:25.760 --> 54:29.600\nand I'm like in blue tight pajama bottoms and I think I just like got the\n\n54:29.600 --> 54:33.120\nvisual cue that I was like Skeletor okay because that was something that was on\n\n54:33.120 --> 54:37.120\nTV when I would come home from school and then so then I was like you know what\n\n54:37.120 --> 54:41.520\nI'm saying is like everything was sexual everything the charge of the light\n\n54:41.520 --> 54:47.600\nbrigade peanuts when I first started masturbating like maybe like maybe it\n\n54:47.600 --> 54:52.280\nwas 12-ish you know like when I first started perfecting the arts or beginning\n\n54:52.280 --> 54:57.600\nthe lifelong love affair of masturbating there was I would go into the the\n\n54:57.600 --> 55:00.880\nbedroom the bat the bathroom in our house I had a lock on the door because\n\n55:00.880 --> 55:07.720\none didn't and one did and there was a magazine that had a ad with Nadia\n\n55:07.720 --> 55:13.560\nKomenich the gymnast and it's like for like Haynes underwear or something like\n\n55:13.560 --> 55:17.920\nshe was like like we're kind of wearing like boy short underwear and that was the\n\n55:17.920 --> 55:23.360\nsexiest sexiest thing in the world for me like I had like I hid that magazine\n\n55:23.360 --> 55:28.640\nlike a treasure that one picture of Nadia Komenich yeah I mean that was a big\n\n55:28.640 --> 55:32.520\nthing in the 80s big people who grew up in our generation everybody knows about\n\n55:32.520 --> 55:36.920\nlike the Sears catalogs and stuff yeah pornography it's just hard to fathom\n\n55:36.920 --> 55:40.360\nfor anybody that was born in the internet when the Victoria's Secret\n\n55:40.360 --> 55:45.760\ncatalogs came along this is free sex I was like I can't believe that I'm on\n\n55:45.760 --> 55:50.200\nthis mailing list how do they all you have to do is just ask like why aren't\n\n55:50.200 --> 55:54.120\nthey asking any questions you know the answer is they don't care they like the\n\n55:54.120 --> 55:58.200\nmore the merrier but it was that yeah I thought it's like so funny that like\n\n55:58.200 --> 56:00.960\nthere must be a huge generation gap for that where people are like what are you\n\n56:00.960 --> 56:03.760\ntalking about pornography is something like it's like black mold it like grows\n\n56:03.760 --> 56:08.560\nin your walls why are you hoarding it in a folder we say like when we like Matt\n\n56:08.560 --> 56:12.920\nGordley and I were young like we were like maybe early early high school like\n\n56:12.920 --> 56:18.440\nfreshman year there was a someone found a penthouse like not the big full like\n\n56:18.440 --> 56:24.080\nplayboy size magazine size penthouse like a smaller one that had like stories\n\n56:24.080 --> 56:29.960\nand it like penthouse letters or whatever I love the the forum yeah and we\n\n56:29.960 --> 56:37.200\nhit it under like a like a no like a knot of a tree and it was all covered\n\n56:37.200 --> 56:44.440\nin bugs and just moisture we would like five guys we would run run home from\n\n56:44.440 --> 56:49.520\nschool to go to the tree and and unearthed this horrible relic and sit there\n\n56:49.520 --> 56:54.320\nand just go explained to modern moms like moms are 30 now and they're like\n\n56:54.320 --> 56:58.480\nkids to me they're 14 years younger than me and they're their moms of kids who\n\n56:58.480 --> 57:04.600\nare starting to they're catching their web history on laptop YouTube like where\n\n57:04.600 --> 57:10.400\nyou can type in anything you want and and there I try to assure them I'm like\n\n57:10.400 --> 57:14.120\nit's a weird conversation because they'll express all this anxiety about my kid\n\n57:14.120 --> 57:18.080\nthe searching for this like how are you supposed to raise a kid healthy in this\n\n57:18.080 --> 57:21.840\nenvironment where they can just type stuff I'm like and I and I and I I always\n\n57:21.840 --> 57:26.200\nrespond by which I sure isn't reassuring them like by going like hey look\n\n57:26.200 --> 57:31.400\nwhen I was a kid my YouTube was a pile of mud outside of a railroad track you\n\n57:31.400 --> 57:35.640\nknow like we there was a printing company that made hustler that then so\n\n57:35.640 --> 57:40.520\nlike torn sheets of it would end up next to the crawdad pond where we'd hunt for\n\n57:40.520 --> 57:47.600\ncrawdad and like my generation learned about sex in in mud and dirt and lady\n\n57:47.600 --> 57:52.800\nbugs and crawfish and I you ended up building a raft and going down a river\n\n57:52.800 --> 57:57.920\nwith a noble black and I think that that's bound to make you more\n\n57:57.920 --> 58:05.400\nmisogynistic more bent and closeted and therefore put have a propensity for you\n\n58:05.400 --> 58:10.360\nknow just foot and mouth or in the worst case like actual you know aggressive\n\n58:10.360 --> 58:17.480\nbehavior I think there's that's I that's got to be worse than growing up in a\n\n58:17.480 --> 58:22.160\ncomputerized technocracy where you can type in vagina because you don't know\n\n58:22.160 --> 58:27.640\nhow to spell it yet and like it says do you mean vagina here's a hundred of them\n\n58:27.640 --> 58:31.920\nI mean it's obviously what everyone's worried about it's like yeah but you can\n\n58:31.920 --> 58:37.920\ntype in horse fucking into YouTube and like it's it's like a kid can like like\n\n58:37.920 --> 58:41.520\nand it's like so if they're exposed to all that stuff how can they grow up\n\n58:41.520 --> 58:45.120\nhealthy and you know I don't I don't have the answers but do you think there's\n\n58:45.120 --> 58:47.800\npeople that type in horse fucking because they want to watch two horses\n\n58:47.800 --> 58:51.920\nfucking that's that's that's their jam I think the answer is yes I think that I\n\n58:51.920 --> 58:57.160\nthink the fear is that the more sex is D demystified the more it becomes the\n\n58:57.160 --> 59:01.000\nit's there's an invitation to sociopathology there and it makes it\n\n59:01.000 --> 59:05.240\nmakes a gut level sense to us that if your kid has access to an infinite\n\n59:05.240 --> 59:12.120\ndatabase of sexuality that if you grew up where with sex being precious and\n\n59:12.120 --> 59:18.160\nmysterious and marked by thresholds and rites of passage and your kid is raised\n\n59:18.160 --> 59:25.160\nin a mainframe of sexual imagery isn't your kid going to be have more of a\n\n59:25.160 --> 59:30.080\ntendency to become Jeffrey Dahmer because they'll look at all these boobs and\n\n59:30.080 --> 59:36.240\nvaginas and beastiality and and gender bending and blah blah blah and because\n\n59:36.240 --> 59:42.040\nthey won't have any thresholds or rites of passage about it then they'll they'll\n\n59:42.040 --> 59:49.520\nbe they'll crave something more flavorful which can only be any like\n\n59:49.520 --> 59:54.160\nthe darkest things possible I understand the logic of that the gut level\n\n59:54.160 --> 59:57.680\nemotional logic of that but if you really think about it and I'm not saying I\n\n59:57.680 --> 01:00:00.760\nhave the answers and let's all society let's do this experiment where we don't\n\n01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:04.480\ngive a shit what kids do on the internet but doesn't it also make sense that\n\n01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:08.120\nthat's an inverted logical principle Spencer don't you think that that's like\n\n01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:15.720\na classic logical fallacy that that that that that if the kids are have\n\n01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:22.320\naccess to more sex information that they will become kinkier because what we're\n\n01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:28.160\nreally saying is I had less access to sex information and I'm only so kinky\n\n01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:32.720\ntherefore my kid who has all sex information will be kinkier than me\n\n01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:37.520\nthat's a lot isn't there a label for that fallacy I don't know I mean I think\n\n01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:42.360\nit's probably true I think the internet is only reverse stigma in terms of\n\n01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:46.720\nsexual acts I don't think it's really added any stigma to any sexual acts that\n\n01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:51.400\nhasn't been there before you know so in a way the only thing that can happen is\n\n01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:54.640\nbarriers being broken down and thus people getting kinkier and kinkier\n\n01:00:54.640 --> 01:01:01.320\nright good but that's you know defined but like all the kinks must have been\n\n01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:05.760\ninvented by now and there's people that have been doing weird shit for you know\n\n01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:10.800\npre-internet but one should one should acknowledge the deMorge perspective\n\n01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:16.320\nwhich was that because I was talking about how don't you think porn like it\n\n01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:21.960\nis like as much as we disrespect it it's like it's the it's the tip of the spear\n\n01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:27.640\nin a in a cultural sense because when you reduce all humanity to animalistic\n\n01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:33.040\nenergy which does include this big black studs gonna fuck these two white girls\n\n01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:39.640\nlike they've never been fucked yet yes you're you're animalizing the black dude\n\n01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:47.680\nbut there's these women are not being respected either elevated yeah and and\n\n01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:53.520\nand that everybody in a porno movie is an animal and which is a state that you\n\n01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:59.160\ngo into when you're jerking off and like that I don't know that's what I was\n\n01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:03.200\ntrying to explain in those episodes which I keep thinking that's what she's\n\n01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:08.200\ndeMorge I but I do want to I just want to say the largest point was actually\n\n01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:14.080\nwhenever there's delineation that it doesn't matter how progressive it looks\n\n01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:17.240\nto you I don't mean to put words in deMorge's mouth but that he I think what\n\n01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:22.440\nhis point was is like whenever there's acknowledgement of a black man being black\n\n01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:28.160\nbasically you know like you're you you may feel like it's better than than\n\n01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:32.680\nhitting him with a belt in a bar because he's black but and that may be\n\n01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:36.760\ntechnically true but that it's a it's also a fallacy to say looks like we're\n\n01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:41.440\nmaking progress in the porn world because because they're because they're not\n\n01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:46.000\nsaying you can't fuck because you're that was my fact that was my fallacious\n\n01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.800\nabsurd I so I do I just wanted to like make sure like I think I understand his\n\n01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:55.680\npoint of view too which is like yeah okay like like like until the until the day\n\n01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:01.800\ncomes when porn is Martin Luther King style i.e. everyone's just a person and\n\n01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:07.440\nnobody is being called like check out this spicy Latina you know we're not we\n\n01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:11.960\nhaven't made it anywhere and porn is just make porn maybe not the tip of the\n\n01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:16.280\nspear maybe porn is just the jet stream behind our fucking sluggish racist like\n\n01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:20.520\nways well speaking of making porn progress in the porn world let's make\n\n01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:24.440\nprogress in the fantasy realm world shall we Jesus is it already that time\n\n01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:29.520\nwe're 60 minutes and this is so easy I wouldn't play a lot no no I'm just\n\n01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:33.280\nsaying like fucking time burns dude when you there's no audience you don't have\n\n01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:37.800\nto wait for their dumbasses to approve or disapprove you do hate the audience\n\n01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:41.520\nyou know how many fucking minds I just stepped on talking about like spicy\n\n01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:45.520\nLatina's in porn but I didn't say anything offensive like now I see Latina\n\n01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:49.480\nlistening who's like thank you for saying that and do you think Latina's\n\n01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:55.680\nlike like like Latina women are spicier than other races stop it I mean like\n\n01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:00.640\nwhat was what's your spice level unlike let's say like in my point my exact\n\n01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:04.160\npoint is that by the time I was done with my thought allowed to complete it I\n\n01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:09.960\nhad I I definitely like made it clear that I was like on the right side of\n\n01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:14.320\nhistory if I was in front of an audience they like they have that they're\n\n01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:25.600\nlike oh that's my least favorite person is the fucking dude\n\n01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:32.200\nwho just like goes that's you know I know I know I know I make that sound\n\n01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:35.600\nsometimes I hear it too that's the thing and I would I hear it and I go oh fuck\n\n01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:39.440\nI fucked up dude if that that guy's that because that sounds so fucking\n\n01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:44.880\ndismissive yeah you fucking idiot that's what that sounds like so and I so if\n\n01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:48.120\nyou may I know that I know that you're if you're in the audience you made that\n\n01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:53.040\nsound I'm not saying I hate you I'm just saying like I'm fucking I'm just saying\n\n01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:58.560\nthis is good for me I I I the the escaping from a couple of fucking like\n\n01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:02.800\nsounds that I have to listen to in my desperate addiction to pleasing people\n\n01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:06.480\nthis could be really fair what the fuck did that mean\n\n01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:11.560\ndo you guys remember the Mick gang bang I was talking about the same as Spencer\n\n01:05:11.560

01:12:41.120\nthree weeks maybe more since we've played this so let's let's get this out\n\n01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:48.920\nall right last time on Harmon well not last time like four times ago what\n\n01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:52.840\nhappened you guys had just solved the problems that were going on in the town\n\n01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:56.800\nand you had the prior and you took them hostage well not hostage you took them\n\n01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:59.760\nunder arrest and you're gonna bring them back to the home church office for\n\n01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:05.000\npunishment I think you did that and you were going there with pachens and then\n\n01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.280\nyou got be set by banditos oh boy they really stabbed the shit out of pachens\n\n01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:15.960\nand also diarrhea junior who was conked out and they took all of his clothes they\n\n01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:21.520\ntook pachens clothes and boned the fuck out pachens started sobbing and he was\n\n01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:25.520\nlike Jesus Christ oh my my life is over and you're like what's going on he's\n\n01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:29.560\nlike this jewel it was my whole job was to protect this jewel and it's gone oh\n\n01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:33.800\nboy you search the banditos and it turns out they might not have just been\n\n01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:38.440\nnormal bandits or banditos they might have been some sort of hired task force\n\n01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:43.800\nassassins who knows what they had special arms and armor that seemed normal\n\n01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:48.040\nor better than bandito armor they had a message with a secret message in another\n\n01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:55.640\nlanguage they had poison pills and a sack of silver pieces what else so yeah\n\n01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:59.640\nit was all crazy you guys are trying to figure out what to do you were thinking\n\n01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:03.200\nabout maybe chasing them down you interrogated the banditos but you killed\n\n01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:06.600\nthem in the process you don't know what to do you were thinking about maybe\n\n01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:10.760\ngoing back to the home office to research though the secret message and\n\n01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:15.280\nturn in the mission the priors still got no you nailed it\n\n01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:20.680\nperfectly timed it almost not to meta game but it almost sounds like we made\n\n01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:24.760\na mistake not having the prior with us why don't why don't we have the prior\n\n01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:31.360\nwith he ran off in the melee I think yeah yeah he kind of is he was tied up\n\n01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:35.600\nand then I think that we started attacked and he was like untimely right\n\n01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:43.280\nand then patches started complaining about his jewel and I like this is why\n\n01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:52.080\nmy character will will fail because he's too much like me I I got distracted by\n\n01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:56.240\npatches his need I wanted to make sure he was happy can I can I take some all\n\n01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:00.000\neveryone's doing good can I take some of that stealthy leather armor is it too big\n\n01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.520\nfor me as a gnome right now it's too big you have you could put it on but it\n\n01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:06.720\nwouldn't work as well and you could you could also get it fitted so if you take\n\n01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:10.160\nit with you you can maybe get it later all right it doesn't so go ahead does\n\n01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:19.960\nanybody have any kind of ability to to locate track of the the prior we made a\n\n01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:25.680\nbig mistake he got away we should be going back to the headquarters of the\n\n01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:34.520\nChurch of the Silver Flame with him and as a guest okay well as you say that you\n\n01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:40.360\nhear the the beating of hoof beats as as as hoofs pound the ground you see a\n\n01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:44.680\nblack horse in the night it approaches and on the black horse there's there's a\n\n01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:50.160\ndark and shadowy figure yeah he's wearing brown plate mail you don't know\n\n01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:54.160\nwhat it's made out of but it seems kind of fancy and pretty heavily worn\n\n01:15:54.160 --> 01:16:00.800\nlook at that horse and on the back on the behind the writer you can see tied up\n\n01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:04.760\nis the prior on the back of the horse kind of over on his stomach he he doesn't\n\n01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:08.960\nlook conscious you recognize this guy it's Geffen he's a veteran church\n\n01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:14.320\nmilitant inquisitor from the LD campaign the LD campaign was a campaign that the\n\n01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:20.080\nchurch went on it was like a crusade to purge dryads from the forest so you you\n\n01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:24.120\nDan actually know Geffen a little bit from that it's not like your great\n\n01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:27.080\nbuddies but he's someone you've seen around you might have fought side to side\n\n01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:30.520\nwith him or you know something like that you he's kind of like an old person and\n\n01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:34.800\nI am an inquisitor or a template you're you're an inquisitor yeah you're you're\n\n01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:39.680\na colleague he's a is he like higher ranking than me you don't actually know\n\n01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:44.320\nhis ranking the church certain parts of the church hierarchy are kind of dubious\n\n01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:47.880\nand it's hard to tell the levels inquisitors yeah especially with\n\n01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:51.720\ninquisitors and you you're not close enough to know his exact duty he just\n\n01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:54.880\nkind of shows up and leaves and stuff so you don't know what he you don't know\n\n01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:57.800\nwhat he does and you're not close enough to him to ask okay you're not close\n\n01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:04.080\nenough to him to have asked but I know his name yeah Geffen Geffen oh what ho\n\n01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:14.160\nstrangers oh no strangers are these I found some vermin scuttling about in\n\n01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:18.200\nthe night does this look familiar out to you he tosses the prior down from the\n\n01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.920\nhorse and he just lands flat on his stomach and he was unconscious and he\n\n01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:28.240\nkind of awakes from the sudden impact he's all tied up it does indeed I you've\n\n01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:34.520\nyou found a source of our humiliation Geffen I we let this one escape and we\n\n01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:38.200\nweren't supposed to thank you haha don't you don't want to tell me that because\n\n01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:41.800\nI'll let you have him for the right price oh come on the yard you kicked him\n\n01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:45.680\noff your horse I know it was an enticing offer wasn't it he's right there in\n\n01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:51.320\nfront of you well I first of all he's not exactly the we don't know that he's\n\n01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:58.360\na bad guy one silver piece come on man Geffen we work for the same company\n\n01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:02.960\nwe're not supposed to charge each other for doing the company's job yeah it's\n\n01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:07.320\ntrue they're not supposed to serve two masters but yet you know coin in the\n\n01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:12.840\nflame they're pretty pretty tempting you know I'm saying yeah I think the\n\n01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:17.680\nquestion is what's more tempting to you the coin or the flame right now the coin\n\n01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:25.400\nso you're not you're not really doing the flames bidding and like two silver\n\n01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:30.240\npieces which is fine here you've presented yourself as a stranger to the\n\n01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:34.120\nchurch you know so this isn't holy work so we'll approach it like you're a\n\n01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:39.120\ntraveling merchant I mean whatever you guys want man I'm just I'm just fucking\n\n01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:43.640\nwith you you could have them what I just thought I could get a couple gold you\n\n01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:50.560\nfucking Geffen you oh you stranger oh yeah I'm Geffen well it's good to find\n\n01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:54.360\nout this way that you got you and I're a little closer than I thought you that\n\n01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:58.840\nwe're on the fucking around level yeah yeah I show Geffen the secret message to\n\n01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:06.440\nsee if he can decipher it hmm I've seen this guild language it's the language\n\n01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:10.520\nthe guilds use yeah it's like shorthand it's it's kind of specialized for\n\n01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:15.080\nbusiness purposes like accounting and stuff like that transactional but it\n\n01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:18.840\ncould be used for other things too but you can't decipher it no it's just it's\n\n01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:22.840\nso common because all the scribes use it it's a very common language what we\n\n01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:26.280\nneed this prior we're gonna take them back to our church and you know kind of\n\n01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:30.040\nget back to basics you want to come with so you want to you could just kind of\n\n01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:41.320\nDeus Ex Machina yeah I just come and go thanks for resetting our A story here's\n\n01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:44.960\nhere's five silver pieces because you're you seem like a good guy you're kind of\n\n01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:49.080\nlike that guy in Game of Thrones that the Uncle Bill or whatever that comes out\n\n01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:53.920\nwith his Uncle Benjen he's got those fire maces I didn't watch Game of Thrones\n\n01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:59.160\nwhat I watched it at your house before I thought I love game I don't watch Game\n\n01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:03.000\nof Thrones I like it the most got magic who's Uncle Bill he's talking about\n\n01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.000\nBenjen it's like a half-white walker that like okay like only popped out every\n\n01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:14.400\nnow and then to save everybody's ass okay thanks Uncle Bill anyways I but what\n\n01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:18.560\nI have one question about this yeah the guild we keep talking the guild like\n\n01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:24.200\nwe're acting like there's one guild guilds but but I'm sorry I'm okay I'm a\n\n01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:27.880\nlittle I recognize the language but can't decipher it too but we're just to be\n\n01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:32.480\nclear all guilds have languages all guilds have their own secret language\n\n01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:37.520\nlike no no it's just a it's a language that all the guilds use like a short\n\n01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:41.560\nhand like a shorthand secretarial kind of the thieves guild uses the same\n\n01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:45.800\nsecret language as the anti thieves guild well all the guilds tend to use the\n\n01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:49.120\nlanguage they use other languages too but when they're writing you know\n\n01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:53.600\naccounting or business related stuff they'll use this guild language so it's\n\n01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:58.160\nsort of a language that specializes in accounting and diplomacy or whatever\n\n01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:02.880\nlike a hierarchy yeah union shit you don't want to be having dwarven script\n\n01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:06.800\nand then you have dwarven metals and trading them for elven wares that are\n\n01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:11.360\nan elven script it's easier for everyone to just learn the guild language I think\n\n01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:16.160\nI kind of get it and I'm excited about this world it's like basic it's sort of\n\n01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:25.360\nlike a really lateral way of organizing the normally mishmash nature of language\n\n01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:28.640\noh it's great there's a language called common it's like it's like it's like a\n\n01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:33.640\nmark it's like markdown language it's like saying like be you elf assassin\n\n01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:40.400\nthief plumber if you're in the business of business let's let's do a CSS kind of\n\n01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:45.960\ncoding language that that maximizes the ability to transact right exactly got it\n\n01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:49.920\nbut I don't speak it no me neither I step in and say hey a little less\n\n01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:54.800\njibber jabber and a little more adventuring hey man I'm just marveling\n\n01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:59.600\nat this world man I know but sometimes there's shit you know that guy in the\n\n01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:07.600\nin the the the the the the the the poopiness you know like shit shot 58\n\n01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:10.840\npeople with an automatic arrow and like we're all bummed out and I just like\n\n01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:17.120\nthat sometimes society does some it does function well okay all right well\n\n01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:23.760\nthanks Geffen we're gonna we're gonna scamper off over to the we will is the\n\n01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:31.720\nprior week yeah we should ask him which way to go to the to the main town yeah\n\n01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:34.760\nI'm kind of like a half well there's no word well the play yeah okay the player\n\n01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:37.360\nis saying I don't know where it is but the character knows where it is right\n\n01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:43.000\nyeah okay yeah yeah I mean we are we are I take some rope out and read but\n\n01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:49.680\nrebind and the hands and of prior but just an aside like well we're I mean I'm\n\n01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:54.400\njust saying like we like as far as I understand it like we don't we haven't\n\n01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:58.760\ncategorized the prior in our heads is like a bad guy no he's not like just a\n\n01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:04.480\ncoward maybe an unwilling companion on this on our journey but he's not like\n\n01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:09.640\nhe's not it's like we have arrested him but he's not guilty of anything until a\n\n01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:13.960\njudge says so right yeah that's how I'm looking I mean I think he looked up the\n\n01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:17.880\nchurch sort only had to arrest him because he was threatening the safety of\n\n01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:21.560\na kid you know yeah he was like and it may be because he's one of the good\n\n01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:27.280\nguys yeah but but there was weird blood monster boogan magic going on in his\n\n01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:31.920\nbasement at his church that's under his purview but as the guy that's it's like\n\n01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:39.360\nif you run into a guy a guy you know after a attack he's the guy that's\n\n01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:43.920\nprobably not involved well we're gonna find out the church will have something\n\n01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:50.200\nto say about this sure but let's not no no I mean let's let's let's let let's let\n\n01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:54.480\nthe church sort of right we're not gonna poison that well but the last time we\n\n01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:58.880\ndo have the poison pill he ran off and now you're good boy he's a hostile witness\n\n01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:04.360\nyeah yeah he has given us reason to mistrust his he's a flight risk to the\n\n01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:11.000\nchurch of the silver flame to the church of the silver flame this is the song we\n\n01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.680\nsang every time we traveled the rope unraveled

the nighttime you're you you feel the quiet broken just as if\n\n01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:29.160\nsomething strange has happened and you look out and you can see over the night\n\n01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:34.000\nsky over the trees and canopies of the outlying area you can see a large\n\n01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.920\nmuscular brown demon like a classic demon like a muscular humanoid with bat wings\n\n01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:44.400\nyou know like just a classic demon but he's got classic demon yeah he's got\n\n01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:49.960\ngiant giant orb like globe like glowing eyes and he's he's carrying a lantern\n\n01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:55.320\nhe's like carrying a hanging lantern and he's just hanging out on the road as we're\n\n01:25:55.320 --> 01:26:02.120\ndemon what's up no no no oh it's uh you you see you see him like it's very far\n\n01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:07.120\naway and he's flying over like you might see a dragon flying in the distance or\n\n01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:12.320\nsomething or like in modern times like a like a like a black helicopter right\n\n01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:20.520\nit's like a little weird but yeah and you and Diarrhea you notice it like you\n\n01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:24.840\nfeel like your heart stop like in your chest and like it actually feels like\n\n01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:28.920\nfor a sec you're having a heart attack as you see the demon makes eye contact\n\n01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:35.160\nwith you and then it just keeps flying on oh nothing else really happens it\n\n01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:39.680\ndoesn't seem to really I think my I think my heart just stopped how far away is he\n\n01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:43.840\nfrom us more than a mile but it's just he's a big guy so you can kind of see\n\n01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:48.600\nit also he's carrying a lantern you see what what what is he flying over\n\n01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:52.800\ntrees trees he's just doing his thing over the tree tops yeah carrying a\n\n01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:59.640\nlantern do we notice that he looked detected Diarrhea you saw him like look\n\n01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:03.080\nbut you didn't see that he looked he I guess all of you kind of think he looked\n\n01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:06.560\nat you but only Steve well then he said I feel like I'm having a heart attack so\n\n01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:10.200\nwe turn our attention to him and say what was going on there\n\n01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:16.920\nhe that his eyes were piercing looking straight at me and then my heart just\n\n01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:24.120\nstops I think it was a weird bodily reaction to that creature looking at me\n\n01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:32.360\nfrom my understanding of Arcana believe that demon is a searcher I may be\n\n01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:36.280\nmaking this up he's got a lantern and he's he's looking for stuff it's\n\n01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:41.920\ninteresting that he sensed Diarrhea but that wasn't his objective you're right\n\n01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:46.280\nthat's a demon that's got a job and his job involves looking I said we go\n\n01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:53.200\ninvestigate this shit oh oh that's a big demon and he's looking for something\n\n01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:58.040\nthere's there's three of us and a weird prior like I think we can handle this\n\n01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:03.280\nshit we're on our way do we know he's an unfriendly demon\n\n01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:10.640\ndemons are unfriendly the friendliest demon is not someone you trust is this\n\n01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:14.400\ndemon on the way to where we're going ago is it we'll be going out of our way\n\n01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:19.400\non our journey to the church to go yeah it is but also it's like it's flying and\n\n01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:23.480\nyou guys aren't flying and it's miles away and it's flying fast so like it\n\n01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:27.080\nwould be you kind of have to triangulate and then you know it would be is it\n\n01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:30.680\nflying away from our destination well yeah it's kind of going the other like\n\n01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:35.040\nit's going so we'd have to intercept his path somewhere fight far off our path\n\n01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:40.560\nyeah let's just clock it like ho oh and the pilot of Pokemon like it happened\n\n01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:47.440\nand we should continue on our journey it's foreshadowing I just want to take\n\n01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:50.880\nthe opportunity because we're focused on travel because I just for my own\n\n01:28:50.880 -->

01:38:34.440\ndarkened room lit by narrow slit windows in the thick stone walls of the keep\n\n01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:39.080\nSchrader takes a seat apart from you and seated nearby Schrader is a bishop\n\n01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:44.720\nrecognizable movable recognizable by his uniform but unrecognizable in his face\n\n01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:51.040\nor body or based on any of your memories okay bishops are\n\n01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:57.200\nbishops are pretty big deals within the church ministry\n\n01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:01.880\nPatchens also comes in with you and also leading up against the wall is Geffen\n\n01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:12.400\nhe's there so shady shady room hey Geffen you got snacks oh no no what no all\n\n01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:19.840\nright just wondering okay I I approached the bishop and is it customary to like\n\n01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:26.440\nbow or anything like a higher ranking hmm do we have like a thing I whatever no\n\n01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:32.440\nno that's like not in this kind of thing what's our saying the flame will keep\n\n01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:38.920\nthe flame burns tall always keep that flame burning always keep that flame\n\n01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:45.360\nburning chaos is a ladder that's I go I've said this before but it's great\n\n01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:50.480\nchaos was a ladder is a great response to condolences like I'm so sorry chaos is\n\n01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:57.120\nlack it's fine I go up to the bishop and I nod and I say I as a deference and I\n\n01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:07.640\nsay the may the flame purify then may we be found worthy I walk up and say it\n\n01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:19.560\nwasn't be the fruit for it will ferment is that how you say are there seats in\n\n01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:22.800\nhere yeah there's seats all right so I assume we're supposed to take a seat so\n\n01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:28.600\nyeah I turn the seat around and sit like the backwards seat like a cocky way and\n\n01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:38.640\nwe have the prior with us and I I I now I I take a I untether him I say this is\n\n01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:51.560\nprior to my name Abernathy this is prior Abernathy from Roan from Roan sir he we\n\n01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:59.040\nbelieve he'll have more information than than we can give you we arrived at the\n\n01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:05.600\nsite of a quite a kerfuffle there was there was bad things happen into\n\n01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:10.680\nlivestock they were doing blood magic rituals and making crazy blood\n\n01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:16.320\nboogins and the whole thing blew up yeah we heard you blew up the church we\n\n01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:19.760\ndidn't blow up the church the bad guys blew up the church and we were lucky to\n\n01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:28.000\nescape with our lives I think we blew it up no didn't we no it was the creature\n\n01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.120\nlady I assume that was an aside right yeah yeah just to be clear can you\n\n01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:38.560\nremind me at table talk like what did we do all of it up no but in theory you\n\n01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:41.720\ncould have prevented it from being blown up right when we climbed up the ladder\n\n01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:45.120\nbecause it was about to blow up like something got set off and we were like\n\n01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:54.760\nokay yeah the P barrels it's true the the prior he was lost it was blood\n\n01:41:54.760 --> 01:42:00.560\nmagic as my colleague is telling you taking place that Abernathy here claims\n\n01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:04.840\nto be ignorant of all of it I don't disbelieve him but I didn't want to\n\n01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:09.840\ninterrogate him without turning him into the the church that's that's our full\n\n01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:17.600\nreport Abernathy should hopefully have less trouble telling you the full story\n\n01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:21.400\nwe should probably also talk to petty cash about replacing a couple doors for\n\n01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:28.600\nthe fell family we we we kind of let a few things on fire all right I want to\n\n01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:32.440\nput in a good word for Abernathy before anything begins and that I think that he\n\n01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:35.720\nwas the prior for my observation of an ambient that had gone awry had been\n\n01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:39.560\ninfiltrated by an evil force I believe he was dealing with it I believe it pushed\n\n01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:44.240\nhim over an edge so he was in danger of harming others that we personally had\n\n01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:49.120\nexercised already we brought him here against his will because his will was to\n\n01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:55.280\nrun but I believe that's because he's aligned with the church I just wanted to\n\n01:42:55.280 --> 01:43:01.240\nput in a good word for him sounds good I appreciate your candor and your honesty\n\n01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:07.360\nand your uh what's what's just being a good detective like what's gum gum\n\n01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:12.960\nsherry yeah and your gum sherry so just rate this one up for the logs you can\n\n01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:17.760\ncollect your pay from Zellie in the commissary sweet we'll take Patchens and\n\n01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:24.120\nabs and Abernathy and talk to him for a bit yeah so Patchens you should tell\n\n01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:27.960\nthe Patchens is looking at you like he doesn't want you to say anything what\n\n01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:33.280\nwe're not on salary we get paid per job you are on salary and you get paid per\n\n01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:37.160\njob oh sweet patching doesn't want me to talk about sidebar patching doesn't want\n\n01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:40.600\nme to talk about the fact that he lost an important yeah he's looking at you like\n\n01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:45.480\nhe'll die if that comes out as a patch not like he'll die like he'll be fired\n\n01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:50.720\nlife I finished myself a patch and I see the luck on your passions this guy\n\n01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:56.360\nhe's the shit and then we walk up yes sir I sorry Bishop I should have also\n\n01:43:56.360 --> 01:44:01.600\ncommended this young man Patchens he was a huge aid to us he didn't know who to\n\n01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:06.200\ntrust but he trusted us he helped us a great deal and he's been under a lot of\n\n01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:12.160\nduress and we were we were assailed by bandits along the way back and he was\n\n01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:15.840\nhurt very badly I hope that the church will take care of him make him\n\n01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:20.520\ncomfortable and I'd also like to know when he'll be released from debriefing so\n\n01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:26.120\nthat I can buy him a beer and give him my personal thanks it shouldn't take more\n\n01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:32.920\nthan an hour all right well Patchens thank you very much and we'll see you\n\n01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:39.080\nsoon we should arrange to meet somewhere yeah like where the local tavern\n\n01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:44.160\nawesome what is that there's a name of a place that we what's our drawing room\n\n01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:52.880\nin in this in placeholder oh wait the skull and bone there yeah it's the play\n\n01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:59.120\nit looks like a pirate flag but there's only one only one like an underlying\n\n01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:07.240\nskull all right well yeah that sounds good yeah all right let's go get paid at\n\n01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:13.680\nthe commissary let's let's collect that sweet placeholder money all right um\n\n01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:20.080\nso this this is the point where three weeks ago when I came up with this\n\n01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:28.680\ncontent I had an audio video portion whoa we can I don't really we could cut the\n\n01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:35.000\naudio I can give the audio to actually be cut in I could put the file online so\n\n01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.240\nthat the audience can see it but it's not gonna be perfectly viewable for us\n\n01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:43.920\nyou know does that make sense should we do as a cliffhanger and do it when we're\n\n01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:48.240\nback on stage live or should we go out and fight that demon I don't I think we\n\n01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:52.280\nshould at least I don't know I guess we should

be\n\n01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:31.000\nyour shining moment here we go all right first of all you became president of\n\n01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:59.640\nthe United States today we got a final grade of a D plus yeah see those\n\n01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:03.640\nlistening it's I got this it's basically made like the video game for\n\n01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:07.560\nequivalent of like when a dungeon master like tells you your campaign you're\n\n01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:11.680\nor not your campaign your mission is his over and like he's here's your\n\n01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:18.120\nexperience but we got graded we saved four people we got a D plus overall the\n\n01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:22.080\nA we got was for time right because it happens really I guess that assumes we\n\n01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:28.920\nrushed I mean that was a good thing but so we probably should have been a\n\n01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:33.160\nlittle more diligent that's good to know well that's the thing is that like you\n\n01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:36.120\nknow you play these video games and then you're like I did okay and then you get\n\n01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:39.760\nthe score and it's like wait wait wait here's what we're measuring right how\n\n01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:44.720\nmany gold pieces do we get no that was collateral you caused 500 gold\n\n01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:51.520\npart away there's gonna have our yeah that's amazing all right so that makes\n\n01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:55.840\nyou want to keep playing more so yeah more well that's I mean I think that was\n\n01:49:55.840 --> 01:50:00.120\nSpencer's right successful goal was that he's like why don't we make this feel\n\n01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:04.360\nyou give you the dopamine spike of us of a mission that's finished well or not\n\n01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:07.880\nokay and then you're like God okay so now you get a kind of a fresh start of\n\n01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:11.600\nthe next one that would have been a smash it with an audience I know it was a\n\n01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:18.800\ngreat idea I have good ideas it's almost like we should have had permits for our\n\n01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:22.840\nnew venue yeah no it's cool I should if I didn't bitch out that one time when we\n\n01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:26.040\nwere gonna play D&D what happened probably now do are we gonna get a new\n\n01:50:26.040 --> 01:50:29.760\na new adventure now we're gonna talk about a new mission you're embarking on\n\n01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:32.440\na new that's so exciting now we know the characters and now we're like in\n\n01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:35.840\nplaceholder and then we like I'm going to the tavern and I'm gonna have a drink\n\n01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:40.040\nand then yeah so many storylines to look so we can all turn to each other and\n\n01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:47.080\nsay okay D plus not our best right lots of mistakes were made but we kind of\n\n01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:52.560\nknow who we are now we kind of know how to use our spells a little bit we we\n\n01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:57.200\nworked as a team we failed kind of as a team but a D plus is better than an F\n\n01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:00.840\nbut I want to get better and I can now because I can take notes I want to I\n\n01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:04.640\nwant to learn to use note-taking software the best way possible so that like when\n\n01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:08.880\nwe meet a character I can like hashtag it yeah so that it's like I'll have a\n\n01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:13.040\nlist of all the characters and you know like I'm gonna fucking nail this okay\n\n01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:18.600\nso now that was dismissed who's our who's our main man who's Charlie to our\n\n01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:23.100\nangels that's gonna give us our new thing how about brother Absalom brother\n\n01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:30.680\nAbsalom yeah brother Absalom are we still going anyways no I do want I do\n\n01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:33.680\nwant to particularly irony here though that we you know like I've been this\n\n01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:37.800\nHoward Hughes obsession person about the new venue and how we're gonna show\n\n01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:42.960\nvideo and audio and stuff and Spencer's what Spencer finally it's like a fucking\n\n01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:48.000\nreally funny irony there that Spencer secretly was like you know what I'm\n\n01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:52.880\ngonna I'm gonna blow their socks yeah do what Dan's keeps babbling about and\n\n01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:56.600\nlike do the audio visual thing at the end of a Dungeons and Dragons I'm gonna\n\n01:51:56.600 --> 01:51:59.640\nback them up and do this and then it's like the fireworks all comes in and I\n\n01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:04.000\nspent 90 minutes talking about how thrilled I was that we're not\n\n01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:13.480\nit's fine well this would have been better if we I think that's really beautiful I\n\n01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:20.520\nknow it's a sitcom it's hard to parts and wreck level I love but yeah thank you\n\n01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:25.600\nwell it sounds like we're teed up for next time for a new mission right I\n\n01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:29.080\nfeel it's pretty safe to say the next time next Harmontown episode is going\n\n01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:34.880\nto be in this format we're not gonna just like leap into some willy-nilly live\n\n01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:40.200\nvenue I'd rather refine this experience while we wait for the castle to become\n\n01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:45.040\nlegal yeah then run around town trying to figure out where in LA we can I say\n\n01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:49.320\nwe we learn briefly to get good at this and then use live venues when it's\n\n01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:53.440\nwhen it's time to do that
