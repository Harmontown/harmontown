00:00.000 --> 00:05.400

00:05.400 --> 00:11.120

way up for the game master Spencer Crittin thank you thank you I'm gonna give

00:39.360 --> 00:42.840
you time to keep clapping yeah I mean you don't have to but we just don't want

00:42.840 --> 00:46.560
to tell them not to in case they're so inclined I'm gonna keep pausing until the

00:46.560 --> 00:49.720
people that are really clapping have clapped themselves out all right and I

00:49.720 --> 00:53.160
wanted to do it so long that people that think they should have stopped by now

00:53.160 --> 00:56.840
aren't gonna feel bad when I keep pausing

00:58.280 --> 01:05.440
all right just give it up for your mayor Dan Harmon

01:06.440 --> 01:13.800
thank you thank you very much so yeah we got shut down we were apparently

01:13.800 --> 01:20.640
performing quite illegally since the from the very moment that we left

01:20.640 --> 01:26.280
Meltdown I wouldn't have left Meltdown if I had known that I wouldn't have had

01:26.280 --> 01:31.360
people you know audiences coming into an illegal place if you're listening and

01:31.360 --> 01:35.160
you've come to the show live shows no you can't sue us don't be stupid and the

01:35.160 --> 01:39.160
rumors that there was a sex for pay scandal happening that doesn't these are

01:39.160 --> 01:44.880
all unfounded as I I should say you know no we were doing every we were

01:44.880 --> 01:50.040
illegal in terms of like you know the fire department you know this is serious

01:50.040 --> 01:53.480
stuff like I don't want to be in violation of fire code we need we didn't

01:53.480 --> 01:59.400
have permits that we we have applied for a long time ago I think the

01:59.400 --> 02:03.720
misunderstanding was that we thought it would work like driving where you're

02:03.720 --> 02:07.280
when you're 16 you can just have a thing in your glove box that says you're

02:07.280 --> 02:12.760
working on getting your license and then a provisional and then if a fire

02:12.760 --> 02:19.440
marshal ever wondered in that that we could just flash a piece of paper signed

02:19.440 --> 02:26.120
by our driver's ed teacher and we would be therefore allowed to keep performing

02:26.120 --> 02:31.520
right we really had big dreams for that venue remember the guy who said oh here

02:31.520 --> 02:37.760
you go with your podcast the playbook you got your own venue now your podcast

02:37.760 --> 02:43.200
is gonna die oh yeah I mean he's probably because he's a dumb ass that

02:43.200 --> 02:46.680
guy's definitely high-fiving himself right now I mean I wouldn't say this

02:46.680 --> 02:50.280
vindicates him but he would he proud his threshold for vindication is probably

02:50.280 --> 02:53.960
very low he probably congratulates himself for masturbating that guy's

02:53.960 --> 02:58.120
probably dead you know what I'm not gonna say I hope so but because we've got a

02:58.120 --> 03:02.080
lot of death in the news going on right now and I want every human out there

03:02.080 --> 03:09.840
alive that that is is still alive now the the night we were drinking nearby you

03:09.840 --> 03:13.400
and I and our friends like the church and Cody and our friends Daniel and

03:13.400 --> 03:17.200
Rachel were having a drink and we got the message that the show is canceled

03:17.200 --> 03:21.240
like 40 minutes before the show yeah what happened was there was another there

03:21.240 --> 03:24.440
was like a party going on in the same neighborhood now originally I what I

03:24.440 --> 03:28.720
heard was that there they were operating illegally so the fire department

03:28.720 --> 03:32.760
showed up to shut them down and then noticed the big crowd outside our castle

03:32.760 --> 03:36.960
that's not true I would then what I then heard is that it's a little it's a

03:36.960 --> 03:41.160
little less ironic than that it's it's actually because they were operating

03:41.160 --> 03:46.080
legally the fire department was there to help them or something that they did

03:46.080 --> 03:49.840
because you actually need fire people on hand if you're gonna perform or

03:49.840 --> 03:52.640
something like that if you're gonna have a crowd in a space of a certain type I

03:52.640 --> 03:57.280
think you need like us an off-duty fireman or something like that and that

03:57.280 --> 04:01.960
person was there in that capacity saw our space looked for his colleague that

04:01.960 --> 04:07.800
should have been also there didn't see him where's punch oh that place must be

04:07.800 --> 04:13.480
non it must be flammable and and so then that's how we ended up getting shut

04:13.480 --> 04:16.560
down and I'm really sorry to anybody that showed up that night including our

04:16.560 --> 04:21.960
guest Dave Anthony and people that had flown in from or driven in from long

04:21.960 --> 04:26.760
distances we feel terrible about that we didn't get to meet a few people that

04:26.760 --> 04:31.920
had flown in from New York or yeah Pennsylvania or it's interesting like

04:31.920 --> 04:34.920
those people are always so nice I mean I would of course if they started to

04:34.920 --> 04:38.040
actually express discontent when something like this happened I would

04:38.040 --> 04:41.520
immediately skip to hating them but as it is when they're there because they're

04:41.520 --> 04:45.200
so nice about it I'm just kind of in all of them because I mean imagine the

04:45.200 --> 04:48.280
disappointment there there so there was like literally some people that that

04:48.280 --> 04:53.040
that you know they think they're always a little embarrassed to to actually say

04:53.040 --> 04:56.760
the words I came here for this reason you know because who wants to say that

04:56.760 --> 04:59.640
especially if you are a nice person you don't want to kill somebody out or

04:59.640 --> 05:05.640
imply that you're this is the you know the big thing that you wanted to come

05:05.640 --> 05:09.480
out for I think there's a natural kind of shame there and that's why I'm always

05:09.480 --> 05:12.920
really impressed by those people they're always so nice maybe the ones that

05:12.920 --> 05:16.000
aren't nice and are really outraged they skulk into the shadows and curse my

05:16.000 --> 05:20.840
name but yeah there's a couple of those people came by the the Guild Hall the

05:20.840 --> 05:25.320
bar that we've discovered that's like an e-sports nerd themed bar that's a

05:25.320 --> 05:29.280
couple miles from the stage if you're in Burbank go there but these people came

05:29.280 --> 05:34.560
and they got to take pictures and and rap with us and buy us shots and it they

05:34.560 --> 05:39.000
acted like that made it worth it and I really appreciate yeah I hope so I hope

05:39.000 --> 05:44.680
so but now can I can I tell you like I was gonna go to a show but I couldn't

05:44.680 --> 05:48.000
because Harmon 10 I wouldn't have gotten there in time our friend the singer

05:48.000 --> 05:52.680
peaches the teachers of peaches she's fantastic I've never seen her actually

05:52.680 --> 05:58.560
do a full live show she's playing at the Roxy so church and I went and we got

05:58.560 --> 06:04.520
there right on time and the show was absolutely fantastic after the show we're

06:04.520 --> 06:08.760
up in the green room at the Roxy and we're having champagne and you know our

06:08.760 --> 06:13.200
friends are there peaches is you know in her makeup and sweaty and she just did

06:13.200 --> 06:20.000
a ridiculously high-energy badass show Ron Jeremy was also in the room now he

06:20.000 --> 06:23.600
is usually at the Rainbow bar and grill every time I've been there he's been

06:23.600 --> 06:28.800
there like he kind of lives there and he was inordinately like unreasonably

06:28.800 --> 06:34.080
moist like he was very wet like he was just has he just had a sheen and like

06:34.080 --> 06:39.040
kind of a like the high-prog glow he was very oily do you know that this is

06:39.040 --> 06:44.400
uncharacteristic of Ron Jeremy I don't I mean I he it's an air-conditioned

06:44.400 --> 06:48.520
building and he wasn't dancing but you've seen him naked so you know that

06:48.520 --> 06:53.160
air-conditioning or not he has a built in yeah yeah but he looked like he had

06:53.160 --> 07:00.040
just been fucking he looked porn sweaty but he was just in a t-shirt hanging out

07:00.040 --> 07:02.320
in a green room for the people that weren't sweaty unless they had just

07:02.320 --> 07:09.520
gotten off the stage okay and I'd seen him there briefly he walked right past

07:09.520 --> 07:13.280
me as he was leaving this very small green room the green room is really like

07:13.280 --> 07:19.320
it's half the size of this booth and he had a banana peel but spent banana peel

07:19.320 --> 07:27.080
over his shoulder like an epaulette and his hair as long Ron Jeremy wet hair is

07:27.080 --> 07:33.200
in like kind of intertwined on this banana peel and I'm sitting on the edge

07:33.200 --> 07:37.120
of the couch with a bottle of shit pain and cups because I was kind of being like

07:37.120 --> 07:43.600
the de facto like bartender and I he walked by me like he so he's back as

07:43.600 --> 07:48.000
Jimmy's like arms length for me walking towards the door and I said sir you have

07:48.000 --> 07:54.720
a banana peel on your shoulder and he wheeled around turning yeah thanks and

07:54.720 --> 07:58.800
then fucking boned out like he was bummed out about it like wait okay all

07:58.800 --> 08:05.960
right and now the theories begin so did I mean he did he for did he previously

08:05.960 --> 08:10.920
20 minutes before then did you have 30 banana peels on him did someone dump a

08:10.920 --> 08:14.600
barrel of banana peels on him and he thought he cleaned them all off and was

08:14.600 --> 08:19.000
leaving my first my first theory and also like people say pics or it didn't

08:19.000 --> 08:23.160
happen this happened so quickly pick pics are didn't happen no I'd be our

08:23.160 --> 08:27.720
proof of this several Oscars including one stolen from my studio big to

08:27.720 --> 08:32.600
different alright go ahead the pics or it didn't happen why didn't why did not

08:32.600 --> 08:35.640
I take a picture of this because it happened in the blink of an eye right

08:35.640 --> 08:40.440
of course you're not my first theory was that he was doing a bit that you're

08:40.440 --> 08:44.080
you're supposed to be a woman to ask him about that and then he makes a dick

08:44.080 --> 08:50.000
reference or something that's my first theory oh because that's so grotily

08:50.000 --> 08:55.480
positive plausible but only only reason I go to that grotily a pop plausible

08:55.480 --> 09:03.800
thing grotily grotily plausible grotily plausible where have you been you're my

09:03.800 --> 09:11.480
favorite woman says 1910 you got hips of liberation and a suffragette I don't know

09:11.480 --> 09:18.200
brutally plausible what is that song what is it what am I thinking of mr.

09:18.200 --> 09:21.200
Belvedere it's like a school there's a schoolhouse rock thing or something like

09:21.200 --> 09:29.720
I don't know so the fact that he was so quickly irritated by my mentioning it

09:29.720 --> 09:35.040
means it's not it wasn't a bit if the bit is a I'm Ron Jeremy I have a banana

09:35.040 --> 09:39.880
peel on my right shoulder and some points I guess yeah oh it's scary there's a

09:39.880 --> 09:46.200
way to make that a bit now church is a photo of peaches opening a bit she had

09:46.200 --> 09:50.880
a banana after the show me here's benefit of the doubt which still doesn't

09:50.880 --> 09:56.840
explain his weird rancor and irritability was that he saw peaches

09:56.840 --> 10:02.880
eating the banana took the banana peel maybe had her sign it I don't know and

10:02.880 --> 10:06.960
then put it on his shoulder though because he's a clean freak and doesn't

10:06.960 --> 10:09.640
want to shake people's hands with a banana peel in there or she put it on

10:09.640 --> 10:13.520
his shoulder I don't know who this peaches is but it's like church is

10:13.520 --> 10:20.800
shaking her head oh oh so the peaches banana was after the Ron Jeremy banana

10:20.800 --> 10:25.240
okay the good so I don't have to extend any more benefits of any doubts Ron

10:25.240 --> 10:33.840
Jeremy was doing some sort of surreal like artistic display because it's not

10:33.840 --> 10:37.400
weird enough that he's Ron Jeremy and looks like he's I think there's also

10:37.400 --> 10:42.440
like you we're making the assumption that the rancor has to do with the banana

10:42.440 --> 10:47.360
peel but if we if you think about what it must be like to be Ron Jeremy there's

10:47.360 --> 10:51.440
probably a super high percentage that at any given moment at a gathering that

10:51.440 --> 10:56.680
has any kind of like hip quotient to it or well let's just say any gathering

10:56.680 --> 11:01.720
cuz like that because he's a porn star because we're awful rude to our our

11:01.720 --> 11:05.800
porn stars we are we're like we treat them like garbage we treat pornography

11:05.800 --> 11:10.240
like garbage we use it all and blah blah I won't get on that soapbox but you

11:10.240 --> 11:13.400
know the people in Los Angeles that have performed in porn that are

11:13.400 --> 11:19.000
recognizable as such I'm sure that just as like I don't know women of color or

11:19.000 --> 11:23.880
like got really tall dudes or anything anything any person that has anything

11:23.880 --> 11:26.560
really specific about them is probably they're probably on a higher risk of

11:26.560 --> 11:31.320
just having had some kind of encounter they really just pissed pissed them off

11:31.320 --> 11:36.160
you know and that like somebody somebody for the 800th time this week like

11:36.160 --> 11:41.360
asked him some question that or said phrased something in a way or like he's

11:41.360 --> 11:44.360
become convinced that like there's certain kinds of people that refused to

11:44.360 --> 11:48.080
shake his hand because they're afraid they'll get HPV or something and he he

11:48.080 --> 11:51.840
he's connecting dots in his head maybe he was like on his way out and it's like

11:51.840 --> 11:57.240
I got my banana peel and then Michael J Fox said that fucking shitty thing that

11:57.240 --> 12:00.280
there is somebody always says and I fuck I'm leaving yeah but like if you're

12:00.280 --> 12:05.400
gonna be walking that that razor's edge of crankiness because somebody recently

12:05.400 --> 12:09.600
had said something that was kind of diminishing or rude then don't be a

12:09.600 --> 12:14.720
famous porn star too late no no be a famous porn star be in a bad mood don't

12:14.720 --> 12:19.960
have a banana peel and don't let that be the thing that switches you off no but

12:19.960 --> 12:23.680
I'm saying my print my pitch is that it's not what switched them off right you

12:23.680 --> 12:28.040
caught up you caught a famous person in a bad mood and hey the banana you may as

12:28.040 --> 12:34.520
well have said you're wearing two shoes yes okay I okay I see that but he was

12:34.520 --> 12:38.640
having a good time I don't look it's not the first time I've been in the same

12:38.640 --> 12:41.360
room with Ron Jeremy I've walked by him because he's always in that same he's

12:41.360 --> 12:45.440
always at the rainbow grill bar and grill I've never hung out with him I've

12:45.440 --> 12:49.080
never been in close confines with him so it is my first real Ron Jeremy

12:49.080 --> 12:54.320
encounter and I wasn't gonna go up to him and say hey Ron Jeremy can I get a

12:54.320 --> 12:57.560
photo with you because it's not always my style unless it's Keith David from the

12:57.560 --> 13:02.440
other night which I was very happy about yeah no but Occam's razor I if I had to

13:02.440 --> 13:07.120
bet my life I would I would go with your the grotally plausible thing which is

13:07.120 --> 13:11.920
that he he does this thing where he puts a banana peel on his shoulder and if a

13:11.920 --> 13:18.200
hot woman asks him where's the banana he has a banana peel on your shoulder he's

13:18.200 --> 13:22.360
like that's right because if you want to see the banana you got to come to the

13:22.360 --> 13:27.680
bathroom yeah yeah yeah that was my first instinct yeah but but then I go like

13:27.680 --> 13:32.120
why is he coming up with well I was he coming up with that shit isn't he a

13:32.120 --> 13:39.680
human banana on society's shoulder but like like like a banana peel and and like

13:39.680 --> 13:44.520
but that's so wouldn't that type is it isn't aren't you Ron Jeremy enough yeah

13:44.520 --> 13:49.920
and then I think well maybe not because he whatever the lead up to that is

13:49.920 --> 13:54.560
whatever it is maybe maybe someone our listeners are gonna go and Google this

13:54.560 --> 13:58.400
and find out that this is a long running thing that there is a hilarious bit

13:58.400 --> 14:02.480
that's like he's doing a deep track Ron Jeremy joke that only certain people in

14:02.480 --> 14:08.680
that room would have got but he had garbage on his shoulder and didn't have

14:08.680 --> 14:15.200
a sense of humor about it which confused I mean I that's gonna confuse me for a

14:15.200 --> 14:19.400
long time yeah and I feel like I have to do the little asterisk here my little

14:19.400 --> 14:26.120
Stanley box in the corner where I come up the bottom and say by the way web

14:26.120 --> 14:31.720
heads I don't I don't if you're if you're a friend with a with a with a

14:31.720 --> 14:36.560
porn star or you are a porn star you listen to please don't feel like I don't

14:36.560 --> 14:41.660
think we're just talking about Roger like when I hear people talk about porn

14:41.660 --> 14:46.280
stars and podcasts like I feel like you know it's like I don't I'm not I'm not

14:46.280 --> 14:52.480
judging Roger me this isn't about judging him this is judging a weird it's him

14:52.480 --> 14:56.640
being a porn star doesn't doesn't weigh into this at all it could have been any

14:56.640 --> 15:01.480
anybody that is worth mentioning because people know his name right or her name

15:01.480 --> 15:09.240
if I saw Pam Anderson or you know Bruno Mars walking around with a fucking

15:09.240 --> 15:12.680
banana on the shoulder and that same thing happened that's interesting to me

15:12.680 --> 15:18.720
Spencer how are you great hey guys you guys hear about these Chinese murder

15:18.720 --> 15:24.840
vans I've only heard the mention but what do you got for us well they're like

15:24.840 --> 15:28.640
these vans in China and they come and they get people and then they just kill

15:28.640 --> 15:31.880
them in the vans are these people that they have contracts I don't know they

15:31.880 --> 15:37.680
just randomly killing strangers I think they're randomly killing people who the

15:37.680 --> 15:41.680
state says they can kill you can hear the scratch of Jeff's ballpoint pen he's

15:41.680 --> 15:47.280
taking notes he does that during the live show too I always wonder what he takes

15:47.280 --> 15:51.040
notes during the show which is really impressive to me I was at that now that

15:51.040 --> 15:54.160
we're doing this quote-unquote single-camera style I think I think one

15:54.160 --> 15:58.600
of the neat things I was thinking is like you could you could pretend like

15:58.600 --> 16:03.440
like you're really smart like you could just be like hey you know here we should

16:03.440 --> 16:12.760
talk about Charles you can hear Dan typing in wait I'm not done with Chinese

16:12.760 --> 16:15.680
murder vans you know he's an American convicted mass murderer and former

16:15.680 --> 16:19.120
cult leader led what became known as the man you can just be like you could sound

16:19.120 --> 16:22.640
a lot smarter than you are you wouldn't do not doing a live performance you do

16:22.640 --> 16:27.760
research yeah so often have laptops set up for just such occasions yeah so these

16:27.760 --> 16:31.080
Chinese murder vans are state-run murder vans or these are freelancers know

16:31.080 --> 16:38.120
that I think they're freelancers that are employed by like a house painter yeah

16:38.120 --> 16:41.440
right so I think their government run there they're like police like you might

16:41.440 --> 16:45.440
have a like a paddy wagon but instead of they put you in the van then they kill

16:45.440 --> 16:49.400
you and they kill you like bright bright handmade stale and I don't have

16:49.400 --> 16:55.880
brights maids tail that's brights maids tail hand handmade revisited always a

16:55.880 --> 17:01.560
brights maids tail so they just that this is a real thing I just driving

17:01.560 --> 17:06.040
around picking up people yeah wait right here's my here's my thing 27 dresses as

17:06.040 --> 17:11.080
a brights maids tail you you see you see a murder van coming don't get in that van

17:11.080 --> 17:15.880
oh yeah no they pull you in there I like the theory that a murder a Chinese

17:15.880 --> 17:21.400
murder van is just a racist phrase for an ambulance the bad murder what was that

17:21.400 --> 17:26.120
joke what you had do we ever talk about yeah the racist joke yeah that all of

17:26.120 --> 17:29.360
the Chinese things are backwards and all of the Mexican things are like just

17:29.360 --> 17:33.520
diminished yeah yeah we've talked about that a lot you know you know look we

17:33.520 --> 17:36.200
also have Steve Levy sitting in the booth with us doesn't that pretend that

17:36.200 --> 17:39.600
Steve Levy is not here I don't know but what aren't we trying to recreate the

17:39.600 --> 17:44.800
stage feel but like I think what you know I don't want to acknowledging Steve

17:44.800 --> 17:49.040
Levy but okay how about this I want the audience to know Steve Levy sitting here

17:49.040 --> 17:52.400
but we're gonna still bring him out 40 yeah yeah cuz we're gonna try to play

17:52.400 --> 17:55.480
D&D later and which I think I could which I can only assume is gonna go a

17:55.480 --> 18:02.400
lot better dot dot dot question mark because I guess better meaning that

18:02.400 --> 18:05.600
we're gonna find out that Jeff and I are bad at playing because it will be more

18:05.600 --> 18:09.760
like the authentic stuff like nerd poker yeah on ear wolf where we're really just

18:09.760 --> 18:14.880
playing D&D and there's no there's no way for us to fall back on but also you

18:14.880 --> 18:19.920
only brought the one vodka and we don't have the bottle of vodka on this in in

18:19.920 --> 18:23.520
the room however another advantage of this format is I can I can press pause

18:23.520 --> 18:27.200
walk out get a drink and I could teleport to a state of drunkenness so

18:27.200 --> 18:33.880
extreme that you can shut the tape this podcast was designed to make you want to

18:33.880 --> 18:38.000
reach in and grab it yeah I mean I you know what's funny is I was just get I

18:38.000 --> 18:44.960
was getting so I don't want to say the phrase sick of doing the live podcast

18:44.960 --> 18:48.640
because I don't want anybody that's been a fan to feel like like there's a

18:48.640 --> 18:51.680
betrayal there or anything like that like we've been doing the podcast for a

18:51.680 --> 18:56.560
really long time it's been a live show I just I'm just saying like I'm saying

18:56.560 --> 18:59.360
this as a positive thing like I was getting to a place where I was really

18:59.360 --> 19:03.720
starting to ask myself and this has been a slow build since November all of you

19:03.720 --> 19:07.040
listening or probably you've had your own little transitional stories like

19:07.040 --> 19:13.480
where you're dealing with fucking shit which is and it's a like like part of

19:13.480 --> 19:20.720
my thing was what is dinging to your iPad and associated smart devices let's

19:20.720 --> 19:29.400
get him on FaceTime Dan's FaceTiming Charles Manson my thing I kept I was

19:29.400 --> 19:33.080
starting to ask myself like why am I doing this show because I'm not like I

19:33.080 --> 19:39.200
I grown sour on like oh this thing where I stand in front of a microphone and I

19:39.200 --> 19:42.520
kind of Kovach about how I don't want people to tell me to tie my shoes and I

19:42.520 --> 19:45.600
wish I was on the moon where no one could bother me and the streets shouldn't be

19:45.600 --> 19:48.720
curvy they should be straight and all this stuff that was like it was it was

19:48.720 --> 19:53.600
working really well and it was like it was working really well under a liberal

19:53.600 --> 19:58.800
bureaucratic technocratic like regime where everything was kind of great and

19:58.800 --> 20:02.080
I didn't have to acknowledge that it was great because I could be a rebel

20:02.080 --> 20:07.240
because everything was running in an orwellianly smooth way and but and yet

20:07.240 --> 20:11.560
a very backward bureaucratically like absurd way so I could just decry life's

20:11.560 --> 20:17.480
absurdities and society's a little intricate wrongdoings and things and

20:17.480 --> 20:21.200
and be a hero to myself and pat myself in the back and then the election

20:21.200 --> 20:25.240
happens and all the women are crying and I'm like buying a gun and I'm like I'm

20:25.240 --> 20:28.720
like and we're all worried that there's like Nazis in the streets and it's like

20:28.720 --> 20:34.000
politics are now like real life they're as real to us as as our black friends are

20:34.000 --> 20:37.480
telling us they've always been like or and our female friends are telling us

20:37.480 --> 20:41.560
and and and that intersects with all this talk that we were having blah blah blah

20:41.560 --> 20:48.280
blah all of that leads to me at 44 almost a year past November I I'm like

20:48.280 --> 20:52.440
why am I what why am I doing this show where I get up every week and I'm like

20:52.440 --> 20:57.280
babbling into a microphone like I'm angry now and I'm fragile and I'm scared

20:57.280 --> 21:01.440
and all this stuff and but I was also going I've been doing this show for

21:01.440 --> 21:08.120
years I would be a really stupid unhealthy person if I if I changed

21:08.120 --> 21:12.200
radically anything about something that had been building for five years and

21:12.200 --> 21:19.000
growing with you know in the span of anything less than six months you know

21:19.000 --> 21:22.680
like being asking these questions over a period of weeks and weeks and weeks is

21:22.680 --> 21:26.320
just not enough so I just that's why I was kind of like I've been building in

21:26.320 --> 21:31.040
my anxiety and and and like and showing up to these shows and you've heard me

21:31.040 --> 21:35.600
being like maybe you haven't picked up on it maybe you have but but like that I'm

21:35.600 --> 21:39.720
like you know I just like sometimes I'm yelling at the audience sometimes I'm

21:39.720 --> 21:43.280
not it was all manifestation of that thing and isn't it interesting how this

21:43.280 --> 21:48.640
shit then just happens like like now I feel now there's no audience here so I

21:48.640 --> 21:53.360
can just talk about God and throw your shoe at your laptop all you want you

21:53.360 --> 21:59.160
you beautiful atheists who we need to further our society but I I there's a

21:59.160 --> 22:03.120
it's like it just feels like the universe just kind of makes this shit

22:03.120 --> 22:08.240
happen like I was kind of a sense of relief when I got texted that the

22:08.240 --> 22:11.360
fire marshal shut the show down because I was like oh that's gonna take a long

22:11.360 --> 22:16.080
time to rectify we might have to do our show the way my favorite murder does it

22:16.080 --> 22:20.280
the way Duncan Trussell does it this could be a really fun thing like this

22:20.280 --> 22:25.080
could be a shot of vitamin B in the in the show's arm we can do different

22:25.080 --> 22:29.120
stuff with this now I don't know I mean you guys seem kind of stoked about it

22:29.120 --> 22:34.200
Spencer's look at that look at that big smiling face oh yeah well the truth is

22:34.200 --> 22:39.000
that when you're in front of an audience if I look this blank everyone would be

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
like angry and confused and like what's up his ass but that's kind of my

22:43.000 --> 22:47.800
neutral face so now you know I'm free to just let it go and not like smile and

22:47.800 --> 22:53.120
not occasionally to pretend that I'm like you know still with it and keeping

22:53.120 --> 23:01.120
up and doing the live show being a live podcast has its ups and downs like when

23:01.120 --> 23:07.400
the show is good it awesome it often is because of the fact that there was a the

23:07.400 --> 23:12.040
crowd interaction made it good but sometimes it suffers because of that

23:12.040 --> 23:16.320
like it's not a guarantee that it makes it better or worse yeah I also kind of

23:16.320 --> 23:20.880
wonder because I had this dream of like moving from meltdown into the the the

23:20.880 --> 23:25.480
castle and that we would then be able to do this like feedback loop that I was

23:25.480 --> 23:28.480
obsessed about where we could have people tweeting and then I can answer the

23:28.480 --> 23:34.840
tweets and you could show shit blah blah blah I like I thought it would I

23:34.840 --> 23:38.080
thought it would happen more automagically than than it did it turns out

23:38.080 --> 23:41.160
if I really want that to happen I have to start producing like a visual show and

23:41.160 --> 23:43.560
the more visual it gets the more alienating it's good it would have

23:43.560 --> 23:47.600
gotten to our listeners etc so it there was a lot of incentive or non incentive

23:47.600 --> 23:52.240
to not move in that direction once we got to the new venue so it starts to

23:52.240 --> 23:55.840
occur to me as we're sitting here I'm like well yeah pump out your audio

23:55.840 --> 24:02.240
podcast and we'll and we can Howard Stern it Joe Rogan it by bringing the

24:02.240 --> 24:06.960
livestream cameras in here isn't that more valuable to people and can't you do

24:06.960 --> 24:10.640
all the shit that I'm talking about where you go hey if you're watching you

24:10.640 --> 24:15.160
know I remember when Howard Stern it is a show it's like you just have cameras we

24:15.160 --> 24:18.920
could even make them permanently like mounted up in here and use them when we

24:18.920 --> 24:23.480
want to great proof son on smartest man in the world podcast he does a lot of

24:23.480 --> 24:29.240
live shows and then he does just like audio from his like house or wherever he

24:29.240 --> 24:33.720
is like if he's in a hotel room from the other the fortress of

24:33.720 --> 24:40.480
propitude or he calls it the purpose of furtitude and I like the change I like

24:40.480 --> 24:44.320
sometimes hearing the crowd but sometimes the lives shows have bad

24:44.320 --> 24:47.760
audio and they're kind of crap because like the technical difficulties and

24:47.760 --> 24:53.240
sometimes I just like hearing Greg just monologue into a microphone yeah and a

24:53.240 --> 24:56.040
controlled environment I think is we got more comfortable in here anyways

24:56.040 --> 24:59.240
whatever don't start freaking out oh I hope they don't do this I hope that

24:59.240 --> 25:03.160
we're obviously we're gonna do what feels right but I'm just I'm just I'm

25:03.160 --> 25:08.480
just sharing my current I'm I think this is I think it's cool this is the

25:08.480 --> 25:12.840
right time for a change to come along for me whether it's temporary permanent

25:12.840 --> 25:18.600
or or it causes some kind of weird vision where we have the podcast but then

25:18.600 --> 25:24.680
you know when we do have live shows Los Angeles or not then we dive into the

25:24.680 --> 25:30.240
privilege of okay it's gonna be a live show we're gonna have slides and yeah

25:30.240 --> 25:35.280
cartoons and fucking tap dances and so make make a dog tricks make the live

25:35.280 --> 25:40.280
shows more event-based and say there's a reason we're doing it charge 20 bucks a

25:40.280 --> 25:44.480
ticket and give it to Planned Parenthood and you do you have one show all you

25:44.480 --> 25:53.400
you invite only fire marshals that is that is that Steve isn't that called a

25:53.400 --> 25:57.440
minion if there's if there's at least nine fire marshals we can we can create

25:57.440 --> 26:06.640
we could rewrite fire fire code yeah oh shit Steve Levyme thanks for having

26:06.640 --> 26:12.000
me applause break can you guys talk to Steve Levyme while I go get a drink

26:12.000 --> 26:17.440
that's some good applause or do I pull the ultimate dick move and make Steve go

26:17.440 --> 26:21.480
give me a drink no you go get your own drink it's your studio Dan has to walk

26:21.480 --> 26:25.800
30 feet to go to the from from his recording studio to his lounge because

26:25.800 --> 26:28.960
if you don't know the star brands industries has its own bar where all

26:28.960 --> 26:33.720
the meetings take place and that's it's quite nice it is Dan make me a little

26:33.720 --> 26:37.680
something would you what do you want yeah surprise me I'll have what you're

26:37.680 --> 26:47.320
having leave me with me oh you know you've had a long 48 hours 72 hours yeah

26:47.320 --> 26:51.880
I don't even know anymore I'm so tired crisis averted though for now because

26:51.880 --> 26:57.560
when we got shut down on Saturday night yeah at right before 8 o'clock yeah

26:57.560 --> 27:03.040
there was audience already seated right oh yeah and were you there I was you were

27:03.040 --> 27:07.760
there yeah and people were already getting drinks from the bar they were

27:07.760 --> 27:12.920
yeah and then the fire marshal shut the thing down and then you had to you and

27:12.920 --> 27:19.600
who Brian from Nolan who really champ was a champion and Kris Boruff off yeah

27:19.600 --> 27:25.840
and so you guys had at midnight had to find a new venue oh go scouting for that

27:25.840 --> 27:32.920
yeah but it was yeah after we got shut down we figured try to figure out what

27:32.920 --> 27:37.000
we can do we had a lot of conversations Nolan and Chris had a deal with the

27:37.000 --> 27:43.480
castle stuff I contacted our whole team for ricking Morty to see because the

27:43.480 --> 27:46.200
next night on Sunday night is Rick ricking Morty if you don't know what

27:46.200 --> 27:52.760
that is that's a big like live adult swim streamed event with paid people like

27:52.760 --> 27:57.560
guests and stuff yeah you talk about the yeah we watched episode live so that

27:57.560 --> 28:02.000
and that's a big deal and that was must have been an expensive and time-consuming

28:02.000 --> 28:07.520
move yeah I mean what do you do when you lose your venue less than 24 hours from

28:07.520 --> 28:16.600
show time and you have an entire set you have to move so yeah we thank him

28:16.600 --> 28:22.080
bearing gifts like you know first person I call was Jen Roskin who is an amazing

28:22.080 --> 28:29.360
producer here at Starburns and she she started helping me out try to find a

28:29.360 --> 28:33.640
place I finally got in touch with Brian Baldinger who books is a talent

28:33.640 --> 28:39.360
producer on the show and he uh Brian's got the beard right yeah yeah yeah he he

28:39.360 --> 28:46.120
found someone with a space and he and I scouted it at like two in the morning and

28:46.120 --> 28:49.320
we just had to pull the trigger because we couldn't find anything else it was

28:49.320 --> 28:53.960
gonna be really expensive but we need to the last time I saw you that worn out

28:53.960 --> 28:57.640
and tired was like during Harmon quest I think when you were being sleepy leaving

28:57.640 --> 29:01.840
on a couch yeah there there are times where it just gets really exhausting I

29:01.840 --> 29:10.080
start like barely he's a sleepy leavey he'll take a couch on some take a couch

29:10.080 --> 29:20.200
he'll take a nap on your yeah they'll take a nap on a someone sofa he's not a

29:20.200 --> 29:26.840
loafer he's just a little sleepy from his job I mean he's the kind of guy that

29:26.840 --> 29:32.720
works hard he makes him like a glass shot he's the kind of leavey who's a

29:32.720 --> 29:39.320
sleepy old leavey he's no don't try to tell him to work less just he's worth

29:39.320 --> 29:44.920
less without his job he's got no family no for any listeners that thought that

29:44.920 --> 29:48.440
Dan's freestyle abilities would suffer from not having the energy of a live

29:48.440 --> 29:53.080
audience I think we found out that right and Phil Collins your check is on the

29:53.080 --> 30:02.440
way so yeah how's that have you recovered emotionally from the girl

30:02.440 --> 30:08.840
situation yeah I mean still going I'm just no I yeah no I don't know I'm I had

30:08.840 --> 30:16.360
a lot of work fires that really took a lot out and the last couple days were

30:16.360 --> 30:22.920
horrible because of the Vegas thing and Tom Petty yeah real hard things getting

30:22.920 --> 30:26.360
dark and to the point where the new story is how dark things have gotten like

30:26.360 --> 30:33.400
like and not in a cool way like I feel like now like it because we can't

30:33.400 --> 30:38.400
communicate effectively or honestly with ourselves as a nation about about how

30:38.400 --> 30:44.920
worthless human life has become we are now like the mainstream media not to

30:44.920 --> 30:50.160
sound like a fucking jag off living in the woods but the mainstream media

30:50.160 --> 30:59.040
the lamestream pity poop I noticed maybe this is a refraction or a factor is a

30:59.040 --> 31:03.080
distortion in some way but I now this is what I'm feeling as I'm looking at the

31:03.080 --> 31:08.240
news when I if I just type Las Vegas after I hear about this shooting I see

31:08.240 --> 31:14.480
what I see is a nation that immediately is just talking about talking about it

31:14.480 --> 31:21.080
which is really disturbing to me that that it it's like we immediately leapt

31:21.080 --> 31:27.840
to how many famous women are responding inappropriately which is like it has

31:27.840 --> 31:31.640
become the new theme like like we're like we're almost verging on some kind of

31:31.640 --> 31:38.680
this Australian gender gap where we don't we like we wait for that if you're a

31:38.680 --> 31:43.120
woman and you have a voice like now we've just gotten so like when the rubber

31:43.120 --> 31:47.360
hits the road we just want you to shut the fuck up like like 58 people died and

31:47.360 --> 31:51.280
this maybe it's a coincidence maybe these are all just coincidentally female

31:51.280 --> 31:54.160
people but if you're female politician you're a female comedian female comedy

31:54.160 --> 31:58.160
writer it seems like you couldn't say anything right about any of this which

31:58.160 --> 32:01.120
is really disturbing to me because it seems like the alternative to responding

32:01.120 --> 32:06.320
inappropriately to it to a breaking a world record for massacres after we have

32:06.320 --> 32:11.440
already decided that 20 kindergartners who have hearts the size of a bullet it

32:11.440 --> 32:17.000
wasn't enough you know do you really how long do you expect people to maintain

32:17.000 --> 32:22.240
their the the the the gears and valves that it takes to bow your head and take

32:22.240 --> 32:28.600
a moment of silence when human life is wasted like like and then and then the

32:28.600 --> 32:31.800
unconscious answer to that which really terrifies me is oh they don't expect

32:31.800 --> 32:35.840
anything they want this to be like carousel and Logan's run like they want

32:35.840 --> 32:40.600
it to be a ritual where we keep sacrificing human life and then we keep

32:40.600 --> 32:45.200
on and then it's like who's gonna fart first who's gonna break the silence

32:45.200 --> 32:50.040
let's all bow our heads and hum the national anthem quietly while we talk

32:50.040 --> 32:54.360
about how our thoughts and prayers are happening and then the moment a Saturday

32:54.360 --> 33:00.600
night live writer off duty on Twitter or a female senator or it you know a

33:00.600 --> 33:05.320
professional tweeter or blogger says something that is effective because

33:05.320 --> 33:10.240
maybe it's satirical maybe it's biting maybe it's a little inconvenient to hear

33:10.240 --> 33:17.600
however long after the final bullet expends another American life that that

33:17.600 --> 33:23.400
happens then we then then we get to tie that person to a stake and shame them

33:23.400 --> 33:29.040
like and poor gasoline all over their feet and play with matches and like it

33:29.040 --> 33:33.480
just like it's not I'm not trying to wait night like like I just I do happen to

33:33.480 --> 33:37.840
notice that it's it always seems to be women I just that's a call that a side

33:37.840 --> 33:44.320
order of intersectionality or whatever but like I'm overall so fucking deeply

33:44.320 --> 33:48.240
troubled by the numbness that I felt when I heard about this and then the and

33:48.240 --> 33:53.880
then the data that hit my eyeballs when I googled it and how the theme seemed to

33:53.880 --> 34:00.000
be that we were being chastised by our own technocracy for responding

34:00.000 --> 34:04.840
inappropriately whether it was not responding at all or responding with

34:04.840 --> 34:10.280
biting went to responding with political pleas to please stop this I can't

34:10.280 --> 34:14.200
believe we're still having this conversation I can't believe people have

34:14.200 --> 34:19.680
the balls to say I know three minutes after the last shell casing hits the

34:19.680 --> 34:25.440
floor is not too soon to talk about fucking gun control you fucking heartless

34:25.440 --> 34:29.640
piece of shit like I don't care if the families of the victims want to wait a

34:29.640 --> 34:33.080
hundred years to talk about anything they're the families of the victims

34:33.080 --> 34:37.760
that's not that's not who we are we're a nation who has its heart broken

34:37.760 --> 34:42.960
how about this is way too many years after Sandy Hook to talk about fucking

34:42.960 --> 34:47.600
gun control I'm a gun owner I still want to talk about it do you want my gun

34:47.600 --> 34:53.800
back like like like let's talk about it like like the gun sales go up when these

34:53.800 --> 34:58.080
massacres happen that is such a mind fuck even if you're not politically

34:58.080 --> 35:01.160
motivated forget about red sides and blue sides that's us that's such a

35:01.160 --> 35:07.720
philosophical mind fuck gun stocks like this boomed gun sales like imagine like

35:07.720 --> 35:15.760
so 9 9 11 didn't cause skyscraper sales to go up it's this is like a unique

35:15.760 --> 35:20.120
disease we have and it's really frightening how logical it is that

35:20.120 --> 35:24.560
everyone keeps erupting into these mass shootings and then every time a mass

35:24.560 --> 35:29.000
shooting happens everyone runs out and buys guns because they're afraid that

35:29.000 --> 35:33.440
guns will become illegal because someone used them bad again the day before

35:33.440 --> 35:39.400
the what was the Vegas thing on Saturday Sunday Sunday so on Saturday

35:39.400 --> 35:43.280
whatever the day before the event was I've been to that festival because Chip

35:43.280 --> 35:47.640
Estin my friend has played that festival before and I was backstage and hung out

35:47.640 --> 35:52.080
and it was really fun met a bunch of people met Jason Aldean and this guy

35:52.080 --> 35:55.840
named Jay Jackson his a guitar player in that band he had texted me the day

35:55.840 --> 35:59.800
before saying hey we're doing that festival root 91 harvest festival do

35:59.800 --> 36:03.240
you want to come out and I'll get your tickets as though I can't I have a thing

36:03.240 --> 36:09.600
to go to and the next day that happened and it was his band that was on stage

36:09.600 --> 36:14.080
when the bullets were flying and I text him and said how you doing and he goes

36:14.080 --> 36:18.800
where he said we were on stage when the bullets were peppering the stage and we

36:18.800 --> 36:23.520
all had to dive off the back or to the side to hide and then run during the

36:23.520 --> 36:26.880
pauses that this guy was taking while either reloading or whatever he's doing

36:26.880 --> 36:32.320
and they all made it out alright but like and then church your sister what

36:32.320 --> 36:41.240
like that has a best friend you know who got my my sister's friend was at the

36:41.240 --> 36:46.800
show with her friends and they all ran and I guess they flagged down a car and

36:46.800 --> 36:51.600
this person was nice enough to just drive them all all the way home and when

36:51.600 --> 36:55.360
she got home it was only then that she realized that she was covered in someone

36:55.360 --> 37:01.840
else's blood so you have to think of how close she must have been to actually

37:01.840 --> 37:06.280
getting hit because she was near enough to someone who was to have that blood

37:06.280 --> 37:11.800
splatter on her and everyone's just so disturbed by that it's a nauseating

37:11.800 --> 37:16.480
thought I thought well because I wonder how many of those fatalities are

37:16.480 --> 37:22.120
trampling yeah I think a lot I mean if you've ever seen that well whatever I

37:22.120 --> 37:26.960
saw a photo I saw like a slide photo thing on Reuters of the images of it

37:26.960 --> 37:31.920
and there are people hiding and it's the exact same tent area that I would have

37:31.920 --> 37:36.760
been in like that where the where I know I would have been if I were at that

37:36.760 --> 37:40.200
show and that does not mean making it about me but like I did just because I

37:40.200 --> 37:45.360
can physically picture the layout there there's no way out because you're

37:45.360 --> 37:49.280
fenced in there and there's only a couple exits because they want to control

37:49.280 --> 37:53.560
the comings and goings there so there really was nowhere for people to go as

37:53.560 --> 37:58.280
far as I can imagine because I remember trying to go out and get somebody in

37:58.280 --> 38:02.880
there's only a couple little like small egresses there yeah well that's a

38:02.880 --> 38:07.640
that's a theme with terrorism it's like you know they're taking advantage of of

38:07.640 --> 38:12.000
of slaughterhouse like environments created by capital but then it wasn't

38:12.000 --> 38:15.320
terrorist because he was a white guy he's a lone wolf he's not he can't be a

38:15.320 --> 38:19.440
terrorist and by the way it makes me crazy just want to pause in our in our

38:19.440 --> 38:23.800
dialogue to address the the folks out there that are going oh I thought this

38:23.800 --> 38:29.000
would be the podcast that didn't talk about this hey how about this topic suck

38:29.000 --> 38:35.600
my dick fucking jag off like fuck you and I can't say kill yourself because

38:35.600 --> 38:40.160
it's too much fucking death but like fuck off into the night and suck suck your

38:40.160 --> 38:44.800
own balls and fucking until they fall off and roll down a hill and fucking end

38:44.800 --> 38:48.120
up in a steamer trunk and just leave me alone out of my life with your fucking

38:48.120 --> 38:51.600
judgment get out of my head you're not entitled to anything you do nothing

38:51.600 --> 38:56.560
you're you're a fucking jerk you're a piece of shit you're a fucking garbage

38:56.560 --> 39:01.040
person you you you how why are you listening to my podcast and then and

39:01.040 --> 39:04.760
then picking and choosing what you like and don't like about it fuck you I

39:04.760 --> 39:08.080
already have my older brother's voice in my head I have the voice of every

39:08.080 --> 39:12.200
fucking bully on the playground I fucking I I I come out here to Los

39:12.200 --> 39:17.600
Angeles I I do the hard work of becoming a fat blowhard that owns a

39:17.600 --> 39:23.080
microphone and and you know how hard it is for me to spout nonsense into a

39:23.080 --> 39:28.560
microphone without having to think about your judgment I I'm a I'm a I'm a

39:28.560 --> 39:44.440
troubled man that was the weirdest sports corner I've ever done I don't know I

39:44.440 --> 39:47.840
thought don't you feel compelled to have like a little like like they add like

39:47.840 --> 39:52.080
like I said because it's like are you worried that like as with the D&D

39:52.080 --> 39:55.760
segment that though that will play that it's like the absence of the audience

39:55.760 --> 39:59.840
it feels simultaneously refreshing and also like oh shit are we a creature

39:59.840 --> 40:04.480
that was breathing audience water and like then when you put us in this

40:04.480 --> 40:09.560
terrarium out of our aquarium like now we look like a floppy weird it's like

40:09.560 --> 40:13.360
everyone's gonna notice that we are boring the only thing that's disturbing

40:13.360 --> 40:16.760
me is that Spencer is exactly the same he hasn't changed it he's been through

40:16.760 --> 40:19.920
just sits there that would be amazing if I just like leaned back and I was made

40:19.920 --> 40:27.040
out of cardboard but you like it more now you said which is kind of

40:27.040 --> 40:29.640
surprising I could have thought it would be the other way around where Spencer

40:29.640 --> 40:33.840
sitting there thinking realizing he's going oh man my deadpan thing like it

40:33.840 --> 40:37.800
it really works in front of an audience and now I now I'm just a guy that's not

40:37.800 --> 40:42.440
saying anything but you like not saying anything and what you don't like is the

40:42.440 --> 40:46.240
feeling feeling pressured to say things and you feel more pressured in front of

40:46.240 --> 40:51.840
an audience right that's one of the competing theories at the moment Steve

40:51.840 --> 40:56.720
just walked out yeah what does that mean our entire audience just left you

40:56.720 --> 41:03.160
take a giant shit when he gets back let's let's let's play a lot of D&D but

41:03.160 --> 41:07.360
like let's really get a good hunk of D&D sure sure like let me know whatever man

41:07.360 --> 41:10.800
I'm still mad at that guy that didn't want us to talk about the shooting what

41:10.800 --> 41:15.160
guy the guy that's still contacting you no I'm he's in my head the guy in your

41:15.160 --> 41:19.240
head now well if the guy in your head is telling you that that's you telling

41:19.240 --> 41:23.440
yourself that no it's the part of me it's the part of me that's an unemployed

41:23.440 --> 41:28.920
flannel-wearing golden retriever owner in the middle of America that is calls

41:28.920 --> 41:35.440
himself a graphic designer but really is just a freelance douchebag and who

41:35.440 --> 41:42.440
sits and listens to the podcast while he masturbates which is a weird move but

41:42.440 --> 41:48.920
and kind of poodles around on like mind-maps after you know what it's me it's

41:48.920 --> 41:52.840
me I just described me it's just too hot to refuel masturbate while listening to

41:52.840 --> 41:56.600
Harmontown and I have a golden doodle I like I changed only what he doesn't have

41:56.600 --> 42:02.000
to Harmontown is masturbation that's sort of what's so weird about it is me I

42:02.000 --> 42:04.920
don't know I'm picturing a really specific dude that's like he's got one

42:04.920 --> 42:08.800
tattoo okay and it's like because he's like because he's like just a little

42:08.800 --> 42:13.040
more back around the back of the shoulder now forearm top of the forearm and

42:13.040 --> 42:18.280
it's like a tribally thing and and he and he's any any really rough houses with

42:18.280 --> 42:22.320
his dog like like he doesn't like punches his dog well he just like wrestles

42:22.320 --> 42:26.840
with it like the dog thinks he's a dog and and and he like throws it like raw

42:26.840 --> 42:30.760
meat and shit and like like tries to take it from them they both eat the raw

42:30.760 --> 42:36.320
meat in their backyard and he he owns a snowmobile and he like I don't know he

42:36.320 --> 42:39.880
just and then and then if you're talking is he in a snowy region or is it

42:39.880 --> 42:44.560
yeah he's just eccentric he lives in a place he likes to take it up to Big Bear

42:44.560 --> 42:47.480
if he lives somewhere warm because he maybe came somewhere warm because he

42:47.480 --> 42:50.960
decided in the tundra that he lives in that he's a graphic designer so he came

42:50.960 --> 42:54.440
to LA maybe brought his snowmobile because he likes to go up to Big Bear but

42:54.440 --> 42:59.920
he he like he's it's just like he loves beer he loves like 900 different kinds

42:59.920 --> 43:03.440
of beer thinks that beer is like a thing that you should experience every

43:03.440 --> 43:08.760
different kind of flavor of and then and that's fine that's all good but when

43:08.760 --> 43:11.720
you if you go to his public house that he likes to drink at and then once he

43:11.720 --> 43:15.040
gets three beers in him he starts he starts saying some fucked up libertarian

43:15.040 --> 43:21.080
shit that you're like you kind of like bite your lip and go like yeah because

43:21.080 --> 43:24.000
you don't want to argue with him right but he's like just he's just like

43:24.000 --> 43:29.960
throwing out like like like at the top of his brain he's like he's like making

43:29.960 --> 43:34.600
these observations about like how all lives should matter instead of just the

43:34.600 --> 43:40.560
black lives and you just kind of like how did I end up drinking with you am I

43:40.560 --> 43:45.640
getting hard I'm getting heartburn from this beer and you suck you fucking suck

43:45.640 --> 43:48.560
I just know we're never gonna get along you know like and I'm gonna end up

43:48.560 --> 43:51.880
auditioning for you and I'm gonna slowly slide into your ideology because I

43:51.880 --> 43:55.800
can recognize the logic behind it but I don't feel it myself I don't want to I

43:55.800 --> 44:02.080
don't want to talk to you you're too bro-y so stop listening to my podcast man

44:02.080 --> 44:06.680
like like we're listening to it if you're that guy but like everything when

44:06.680 --> 44:11.120
you listen to me just like just how could that guy listen to this podcast I

44:11.120 --> 44:16.560
mean like how likely is that because he's not totally stupid and he likes

44:16.560 --> 44:20.480
smart stuff or something I don't know and like we're not like bleeding heart

44:20.480 --> 44:24.640
whatever is like but that's what he that's why he's hated the podcast since

44:24.640 --> 44:28.200
November because then now I'm starting to sound like all the shit that he hates

44:28.200 --> 44:32.360
because I now I'm like freaked out because I used to be a full-blown

44:32.360 --> 44:37.600
anarchist and now I'm now I'm like a Democrat basically because I gave for

44:37.600 --> 44:40.400
the time being because I can't because that's the lever I keep pulling because

44:40.400 --> 44:44.520
I'm so scared of fascism I just keep pulling the lever that says don't let

44:44.520 --> 44:49.120
fascists win so and that's like that's the fucking system man that's the game

44:49.120 --> 44:54.120
and that which is what I used to say so if if I have four years of my podcast

44:54.120 --> 44:58.320
I have dudes like that that like started to like build up like I don't I'm not I

44:58.320 --> 45:01.480
shouldn't be surprised but I'm just saying like let's have a reckoning here

45:01.480 --> 45:06.360
guys like if you're that dog wrestling dude and you feel that way like you don't

45:06.360 --> 45:11.960
have to leave or stay but like can you do me the favor of of like looking at at

45:11.960 --> 45:18.920
at your time with me as the inverse of when you go to the gym with in other

45:18.920 --> 45:23.400
words like this is your you should be more of a pussy time like like like like

45:23.400 --> 45:28.520
like where you just like exercise your pussy like like like like where you

45:28.520 --> 45:32.760
acquiesce a little bit more because I'm going through a fucking crisis about

45:32.760 --> 45:36.720
this shit and I you've probably noticed I try to be honest about the fact I don't

45:36.720 --> 45:41.600
know what I'm talking about and then I'm I'm a lazy and and hypocritical and

45:41.600 --> 45:47.240
and and and whatever like I'm not I'm not I'm not ever gonna like decide what

45:47.240 --> 45:51.680
the truth is and start barking it at you I'm just like always saying like this is

45:51.680 --> 45:56.320
where I'm at at this moment I could you take that ride with me without without

45:56.320 --> 46:00.840
this fucking thing that drives me nuts that's all in my head I guess of like

46:00.840 --> 46:05.360
now I don't like this podcast like like this idea that the podcast exists in

46:05.360 --> 46:09.520
some dichotomy of like well that was good now it's bad like I can't fucking

46:09.520 --> 46:13.320
handle thinking like that then you're just Sony and then I want to fucking beat

46:13.320 --> 46:17.760
you with a bat and I just want to let you know how much I hate you because for

46:17.760 --> 46:21.400
my own integrity sake for the same reason ironically that you wrestle your

46:21.400 --> 46:25.720
dog and don't like me because you don't want to be told what to do okay great so

46:25.720 --> 46:29.920
like minus your dumb tattoo that you got like like we're basically the same

46:29.920 --> 46:33.440
flabby fucking blowhard assholes you could probably beat me up in a fight you

46:33.440 --> 46:39.480
know how to use a knife but you know what if you cut me scorpions come out is

46:39.480 --> 46:42.560
that true yeah that's a little that's not a metaphor if you ever seen the

46:42.560 --> 46:47.080
original clash of the Titans like if you fucking cut me bro scorpions are gonna

46:47.080 --> 46:55.080
come out of me giant ones but my blood will make giant how giant giant enough

46:55.080 --> 46:59.040
to fit inside you know they start small watch class of the Titans the original

46:59.040 --> 47:04.320
right and they get bigger with Harry Hamlin as Perseus if you my blood if my

47:04.320 --> 47:08.120
blood hits the ground little tiny scorpions form that then quickly grow

47:08.120 --> 47:14.640
through the miracle of green screen to the size of mammoth if you cut me little

47:14.640 --> 47:19.040
Burgess Meredith come out that's you know I'd like to talk about that is that

47:19.040 --> 47:24.120
from Rocky no Burgess Meredith isn't Clash of the Titans oh yeah but he okay

47:24.120 --> 47:27.880
that's weird that his character whatever his character is from Clash of the

47:27.880 --> 47:32.400
Titans right but they're like a bunch of little Burgess Meredith and Toga's come

47:32.400 --> 47:35.880
out of me but they don't get bigger so the character that you represent like I

47:35.880 --> 47:40.280
guess I'm characterizing myself as that guy a cerebus sir sir sir sir and not

47:40.280 --> 47:44.640
Cerebus yes Cerberus or something like that like as a close because he's the

47:44.640 --> 47:49.280
guy with the tail yeah he got he gets turned like so I found an icon of that

47:49.280 --> 47:53.160
movie and you're saying well whatever guy you are we don't know who it is but

47:53.160 --> 47:56.840
we know he didn't get cut in the movie now he's kind of like the Obi-Wan Kenobi

47:56.840 --> 48:00.440
Mentori guy oh wait a minute I'm sorry now there's a couple 45 year old people

48:00.440 --> 48:03.800
throwing their shoes at the laptop because I just realized that guy is the

48:03.800 --> 48:08.160
one who stabs it's them I'm the Medusa the Medusa's blood is what makes the

48:08.160 --> 48:12.400
scorpions I believe oh yeah so it's been a long time so whoever you are you might

48:12.400 --> 48:15.440
be the Kraken for all we know maybe when you cut the Kraken Burgess Meredith

48:15.440 --> 48:20.400
come out we don't know because we're a little metal owls that's only the three

48:20.400 --> 48:23.400
things I remember that movie there was a Medusa there was a three-headed thing

48:23.400 --> 48:27.720
and then there was the metal owl and then Burgess Meredith and then from what I

48:27.720 --> 48:32.720
heard of the reboot in the reboot of Clash of the Titans they're going through

48:32.720 --> 48:38.520
a trunk and one of the things that they pull out while they're throwing garbage

48:38.520 --> 48:41.520
around is a little clockwork owl and the guy looks at it and goes like what's

48:41.520 --> 48:46.880
this garbage what's this shit for real fuck this garbage and he like shits on

48:46.880 --> 48:50.480
it and like rubs the shit into the eyes and then pisses on it and to wash the

48:50.480 --> 48:54.360
shit out but then like throws it in a river that's harsh and you're supposed

48:54.360 --> 49:00.600
to be like that's amazing because you're a fan of Clash of the Titans and you

49:00.600 --> 49:05.640
hate the clockwork owl I don't I knew we'll never understand that I know we've

49:05.640 --> 49:08.520
talked about that before but like at the end of the Lone Ranger movie where it's

49:08.520 --> 49:13.800
like he's like hi ho and time to goes don't dumb um here's some other don'ts

49:13.800 --> 49:18.440
don't fucking rewrite don't take the job rewriting this movie if you hate like

49:18.440 --> 49:22.400
what the fuck is your problem I was eating a pastrami sandwich in New York

49:22.400 --> 49:26.800
when I was a kid at stage deli and I'm having my pastrami sandwich and I'm you

49:26.800 --> 49:30.440
know 10 or 11 years old fucking Burgess Meredith walks by me down the

49:30.440 --> 49:36.360
street and I like I yelled out loud into a restaurant Clash of the Titans he

49:36.360 --> 49:40.320
couldn't hear it all people do is it's a love real just yelling out a name of a

49:40.320 --> 49:46.360
movie and no one saw that Burgess Meredith was going by then like the day

49:46.360 --> 49:50.960
before or the day after we saw Richard Geer walking down the road and I could

49:50.960 --> 49:58.320
hear my mom ovulate like I should just like oh Cody got her period during an

49:58.320 --> 50:06.480
Andy DeFranco set Lilith Fair Lilith Fair you mean her first period yeah her

50:06.480 --> 50:09.840
friend yeah she became a woman she dropped her first egg I don't know if

50:09.840 --> 50:16.360
that's accurate but that's how she shed her first she got her period like yeah

50:16.360 --> 50:21.200
she she transitioned from girlhood to womanhood during an Andy DeFranco song

50:21.200 --> 50:25.160
there's a girl I knew I went to high school with that she's her first orgasm

50:25.160 --> 50:31.680
was like at 12 or 13 years old at a Prince concert she was with her mother

50:31.680 --> 50:35.840
or father or both and she was standing and she goes I didn't know it was

50:35.840 --> 50:40.320
happening to me I was watching this man perform and she realized later on just

50:40.320 --> 50:46.160
oh no like I came all right like she had a full-on Prince induced mind orgasm

50:46.160 --> 50:50.480
because it's like yeah I got I almost have an orgasm when I watch Prince like

50:50.480 --> 50:55.200
he's fucking amazing there is an article about Prince when he died that where it

50:55.200 --> 51:03.680
was like what I think it was like from the point of view of trans what do you

51:03.680 --> 51:06.680
what do you call it you can still call them drag queens right that's not yeah

51:06.680 --> 51:10.160
like I think it was like but I can't remember that part I can't remember but

51:10.160 --> 51:16.840
I was like sort of performers who who worked within the the the the flux the

51:16.840 --> 51:22.840
the outer edges of the binary world the heteronormative sphere and but they were

51:22.840 --> 51:29.120
talking about like how Prince was this song that you know Prince was music that

51:29.120 --> 51:32.680
like no matter what the song was it was always this song like Prince was

51:32.680 --> 51:36.840
specialized the sonic waves that came from a Prince song were perfect at

51:36.840 --> 51:42.480
turning straight straight people by okay like it was like like if you were on the

51:42.480 --> 51:46.400
edge if you were curious like the thing that would that would get you every time

51:46.400 --> 51:51.160
was like the Prince was making this music by intention or not unconsciously that

51:51.160 --> 51:55.160
that was the energy there's one that wasn't a sole purpose in the world but

51:55.160 --> 51:59.000
that that was like something that was kind of known to DJs and strippers and

51:59.000 --> 52:04.040
things that sounds like Catholic propaganda well I mean yeah but but but

52:04.040 --> 52:08.440
this was from a place of like these are people who are like thankful for those

52:08.440 --> 52:14.360
properties they're like we could really put this to some use yeah Prince could

52:14.360 --> 52:21.200
sing the straightaway I mean he definitely yeah I remember what my

52:21.200 --> 52:24.720
brother was five years old doing me and like so in the 80s like the androgynous

52:24.720 --> 52:29.080
revolution started to happen in pop boy George and Prince and and even heavy

52:29.080 --> 52:33.080
metal like if you could tell whether you were a boy or a girl it was like a

52:33.080 --> 52:37.160
little bit to your discredit you know like you you really needed to be like

52:37.160 --> 52:41.680
that if the mad the more you were more masculine if you were like more like

52:41.680 --> 52:44.880
yeah there was more makeup and hairspray and high heels and yeah Motley

52:44.880 --> 52:49.320
crew kind of took or like poison rather they kind of took it to the extreme is

52:49.320 --> 52:52.800
like okay like you're going out of your way to be fake drag queens but I gotta

52:52.800 --> 52:55.440
confess because my brother was five years older than me so I was a kid and I

52:55.440 --> 52:58.200
was so I was like ten years old when that was happening it was a little

52:58.200 --> 53:01.800
intimidating to me that was too much sexuality for me it was sexuality I

53:01.800 --> 53:05.600
didn't even know what sex I mean I knew what sex was sex was Pam Dabber from

53:05.600 --> 53:12.960
more work in Mindy sex was Penny from Inspector Gadget I was her age it sex

53:12.960 --> 53:18.960
was like it was you know Linda Sheenbuffner you actually there was a

53:18.960 --> 53:24.640
rousal because of Penny from Inspector Gadget no alright come on can we put a

53:24.640 --> 53:30.160
pin on that it's a yes or no question I was yeah dude I was like well I was

53:30.160 --> 53:34.880
thinking I was when I when I was like 11 years old I I hit this transition where

53:34.880 --> 53:38.360
I started thinking of everything sexually like I one of my most common

53:38.360 --> 53:42.520
fancies I would like a hump a pillow and think of myself as being Skeletor

53:42.520 --> 53:51.000
and thinking about fucking either Tila or She-Ra from the He-Man averse I guess

53:51.000 --> 53:54.640
because he was a monster and like maybe because I would have I had like these

53:54.640 --> 53:58.520
blue pajamas that were really tight because I had like I was sprouting so

53:58.520 --> 54:01.880
because I was going through puberty so I think the blue pajama bottoms that were

54:01.880 --> 54:06.240
basically becoming tights because they were so small like they were made for a

54:06.240 --> 54:09.480
little boy and I was becoming a man so I was like hulking out through my blue

54:09.480 --> 54:13.280
pajamas so I and I something about like I had talked about this where it's like I

54:13.280 --> 54:18.480
I didn't want to touch myself but I was like getting so into like so I was just

54:18.480 --> 54:22.160
humping everything and so there was like I but then I'm also part of that was like

54:22.160 --> 54:25.760
I didn't want to do it with my dick out so then I was like where these pajamas

54:25.760 --> 54:29.600
and I'm like in blue tight pajama bottoms and I think I just like got the

54:29.600 --> 54:33.120
visual cue that I was like Skeletor okay because that was something that was on

54:33.120 --> 54:37.120
TV when I would come home from school and then so then I was like you know what

54:37.120 --> 54:41.520
I'm saying is like everything was sexual everything the charge of the light

54:41.520 --> 54:47.600
brigade peanuts when I first started masturbating like maybe like maybe it

54:47.600 --> 54:52.280
was 12-ish you know like when I first started perfecting the arts or beginning

54:52.280 --> 54:57.600
the lifelong love affair of masturbating there was I would go into the the

54:57.600 --> 55:00.880
bedroom the bat the bathroom in our house I had a lock on the door because

55:00.880 --> 55:07.720
one didn't and one did and there was a magazine that had a ad with Nadia

55:07.720 --> 55:13.560
Komenich the gymnast and it's like for like Haynes underwear or something like

55:13.560 --> 55:17.920
she was like like we're kind of wearing like boy short underwear and that was the

55:17.920 --> 55:23.360
sexiest sexiest thing in the world for me like I had like I hid that magazine

55:23.360 --> 55:28.640
like a treasure that one picture of Nadia Komenich yeah I mean that was a big

55:28.640 --> 55:32.520
thing in the 80s big people who grew up in our generation everybody knows about

55:32.520 --> 55:36.920
like the Sears catalogs and stuff yeah pornography it's just hard to fathom

55:36.920 --> 55:40.360
for anybody that was born in the internet when the Victoria's Secret

55:40.360 --> 55:45.760
catalogs came along this is free sex I was like I can't believe that I'm on

55:45.760 --> 55:50.200
this mailing list how do they all you have to do is just ask like why aren't

55:50.200 --> 55:54.120
they asking any questions you know the answer is they don't care they like the

55:54.120 --> 55:58.200
more the merrier but it was that yeah I thought it's like so funny that like

55:58.200 --> 56:00.960
there must be a huge generation gap for that where people are like what are you

56:00.960 --> 56:03.760
talking about pornography is something like it's like black mold it like grows

56:03.760 --> 56:08.560
in your walls why are you hoarding it in a folder we say like when we like Matt

56:08.560 --> 56:12.920
Gordley and I were young like we were like maybe early early high school like

56:12.920 --> 56:18.440
freshman year there was a someone found a penthouse like not the big full like

56:18.440 --> 56:24.080
playboy size magazine size penthouse like a smaller one that had like stories

56:24.080 --> 56:29.960
and it like penthouse letters or whatever I love the the forum yeah and we

56:29.960 --> 56:37.200
hit it under like a like a no like a knot of a tree and it was all covered

56:37.200 --> 56:44.440
in bugs and just moisture we would like five guys we would run run home from

56:44.440 --> 56:49.520
school to go to the tree and and unearthed this horrible relic and sit there

56:49.520 --> 56:54.320
and just go explained to modern moms like moms are 30 now and they're like

56:54.320 --> 56:58.480
kids to me they're 14 years younger than me and they're their moms of kids who

56:58.480 --> 57:04.600
are starting to they're catching their web history on laptop YouTube like where

57:04.600 --> 57:10.400
you can type in anything you want and and there I try to assure them I'm like

57:10.400 --> 57:14.120
it's a weird conversation because they'll express all this anxiety about my kid

57:14.120 --> 57:18.080
the searching for this like how are you supposed to raise a kid healthy in this

57:18.080 --> 57:21.840
environment where they can just type stuff I'm like and I and I and I I always

57:21.840 --> 57:26.200
respond by which I sure isn't reassuring them like by going like hey look

57:26.200 --> 57:31.400
when I was a kid my YouTube was a pile of mud outside of a railroad track you

57:31.400 --> 57:35.640
know like we there was a printing company that made hustler that then so

57:35.640 --> 57:40.520
like torn sheets of it would end up next to the crawdad pond where we'd hunt for

57:40.520 --> 57:47.600
crawdad and like my generation learned about sex in in mud and dirt and lady

57:47.600 --> 57:52.800
bugs and crawfish and I you ended up building a raft and going down a river

57:52.800 --> 57:57.920
with a noble black and I think that that's bound to make you more

57:57.920 --> 58:05.400
misogynistic more bent and closeted and therefore put have a propensity for you

58:05.400 --> 58:10.360
know just foot and mouth or in the worst case like actual you know aggressive

58:10.360 --> 58:17.480
behavior I think there's that's I that's got to be worse than growing up in a

58:17.480 --> 58:22.160
computerized technocracy where you can type in vagina because you don't know

58:22.160 --> 58:27.640
how to spell it yet and like it says do you mean vagina here's a hundred of them

58:27.640 --> 58:31.920
I mean it's obviously what everyone's worried about it's like yeah but you can

58:31.920 --> 58:37.920
type in horse fucking into YouTube and like it's it's like a kid can like like

58:37.920 --> 58:41.520
and it's like so if they're exposed to all that stuff how can they grow up

58:41.520 --> 58:45.120
healthy and you know I don't I don't have the answers but do you think there's

58:45.120 --> 58:47.800
people that type in horse fucking because they want to watch two horses

58:47.800 --> 58:51.920
fucking that's that's that's their jam I think the answer is yes I think that I

58:51.920 --> 58:57.160
think the fear is that the more sex is D demystified the more it becomes the

58:57.160 --> 59:01.000
it's there's an invitation to sociopathology there and it makes it

59:01.000 --> 59:05.240
makes a gut level sense to us that if your kid has access to an infinite

59:05.240 --> 59:12.120
database of sexuality that if you grew up where with sex being precious and

59:12.120 --> 59:18.160
mysterious and marked by thresholds and rites of passage and your kid is raised

59:18.160 --> 59:25.160
in a mainframe of sexual imagery isn't your kid going to be have more of a

59:25.160 --> 59:30.080
tendency to become Jeffrey Dahmer because they'll look at all these boobs and

59:30.080 --> 59:36.240
vaginas and beastiality and and gender bending and blah blah blah and because

59:36.240 --> 59:42.040
they won't have any thresholds or rites of passage about it then they'll they'll

59:42.040 --> 59:49.520
be they'll crave something more flavorful which can only be any like

59:49.520 --> 59:54.160
the darkest things possible I understand the logic of that the gut level

59:54.160 --> 59:57.680
emotional logic of that but if you really think about it and I'm not saying I

59:57.680 --> 01:00:00.760
have the answers and let's all society let's do this experiment where we don't

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:04.480
give a shit what kids do on the internet but doesn't it also make sense that

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:08.120
that's an inverted logical principle Spencer don't you think that that's like

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:15.720
a classic logical fallacy that that that that that if the kids are have

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:22.320
access to more sex information that they will become kinkier because what we're

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:28.160
really saying is I had less access to sex information and I'm only so kinky

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:32.720
therefore my kid who has all sex information will be kinkier than me

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:37.520
that's a lot isn't there a label for that fallacy I don't know I mean I think

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:42.360
it's probably true I think the internet is only reverse stigma in terms of

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:46.720
sexual acts I don't think it's really added any stigma to any sexual acts that

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:51.400
hasn't been there before you know so in a way the only thing that can happen is

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:54.640
barriers being broken down and thus people getting kinkier and kinkier

01:00:54.640 --> 01:01:01.320
right good but that's you know defined but like all the kinks must have been

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:05.760
invented by now and there's people that have been doing weird shit for you know

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:10.800
pre-internet but one should one should acknowledge the deMorge perspective

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:16.320
which was that because I was talking about how don't you think porn like it

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:21.960
is like as much as we disrespect it it's like it's the it's the tip of the spear

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:27.640
in a in a cultural sense because when you reduce all humanity to animalistic

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:33.040
energy which does include this big black studs gonna fuck these two white girls

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:39.640
like they've never been fucked yet yes you're you're animalizing the black dude

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:47.680
but there's these women are not being respected either elevated yeah and and

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:53.520
and that everybody in a porno movie is an animal and which is a state that you

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:59.160
go into when you're jerking off and like that I don't know that's what I was

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:03.200
trying to explain in those episodes which I keep thinking that's what she's

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:08.200
deMorge I but I do want to I just want to say the largest point was actually

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:14.080
whenever there's delineation that it doesn't matter how progressive it looks

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:17.240
to you I don't mean to put words in deMorge's mouth but that he I think what

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:22.440
his point was is like whenever there's acknowledgement of a black man being black

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:28.160
basically you know like you're you you may feel like it's better than than

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:32.680
hitting him with a belt in a bar because he's black but and that may be

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:36.760
technically true but that it's a it's also a fallacy to say looks like we're

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:41.440
making progress in the porn world because because they're because they're not

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:46.000
saying you can't fuck because you're that was my fact that was my fallacious

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.800
absurd I so I do I just wanted to like make sure like I think I understand his

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:55.680
point of view too which is like yeah okay like like like until the until the day

01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:01.800
comes when porn is Martin Luther King style i.e. everyone's just a person and

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:07.440
nobody is being called like check out this spicy Latina you know we're not we

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:11.960
haven't made it anywhere and porn is just make porn maybe not the tip of the

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:16.280
spear maybe porn is just the jet stream behind our fucking sluggish racist like

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:20.520
ways well speaking of making porn progress in the porn world let's make

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:24.440
progress in the fantasy realm world shall we Jesus is it already that time

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:29.520
we're 60 minutes and this is so easy I wouldn't play a lot no no I'm just

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:33.280
saying like fucking time burns dude when you there's no audience you don't have

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:37.800
to wait for their dumbasses to approve or disapprove you do hate the audience

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:41.520
you know how many fucking minds I just stepped on talking about like spicy

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:45.520
Latina's in porn but I didn't say anything offensive like now I see Latina

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:49.480
listening who's like thank you for saying that and do you think Latina's

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:55.680
like like like Latina women are spicier than other races stop it I mean like

01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:00.640
what was what's your spice level unlike let's say like in my point my exact

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:04.160
point is that by the time I was done with my thought allowed to complete it I

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:09.960
had I I definitely like made it clear that I was like on the right side of

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:14.320
history if I was in front of an audience they like they have that they're

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:25.600
like oh that's my least favorite person is the fucking dude

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:32.200
who just like goes that's you know I know I know I know I make that sound

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:35.600
sometimes I hear it too that's the thing and I would I hear it and I go oh fuck

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:39.440
I fucked up dude if that that guy's that because that sounds so fucking

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:44.880
dismissive yeah you fucking idiot that's what that sounds like so and I so if

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:48.120
you may I know that I know that you're if you're in the audience you made that

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:53.040
sound I'm not saying I hate you I'm just saying like I'm fucking I'm just saying

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:58.560
this is good for me I I I the the escaping from a couple of fucking like

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:02.800
sounds that I have to listen to in my desperate addiction to pleasing people

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:06.480
this could be really fair what the fuck did that mean

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:11.560
do you guys remember the Mick gang bang I was talking about the same as Spencer

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:17.520
about this last weekend what the Mick gang bang this website called like secret

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:22.120
menu calm and it basically just oh a bunch of bullshit and it gave it all

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:26.560
these crazy names and then certain people like Steve act like it's like a

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:31.000
legitimate thing and it's just like a fucking idiot in Florida New York you

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.800
were talking about it's not like an established menu item but no what are you

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:40.520
talking about it's a McDouble there's a Mick double it was a Mick chicken inside

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:44.560
of a Mick double yeah you just put them into the same sandwich right and so it

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:48.120
certainly it's drive-throughs and things to the internet you can say can I get a

01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:52.200
Mick gang it's like bartending like you can say I got a blowjob shot but that

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:55.880
doesn't mean that the establishment that you're drinking at approves of the

01:05:55.880 --> 01:06:01.880
concept of a blowjob or you know like you go I go like I'd like a like a gang

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:06.480
bang at a McDonald's drive-through and the person might say what or they might

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:11.760
say okay got it yeah because it's a secret my favorite menu item at McDonald's

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:19.560
is the cancer because you you can get that at any McDonald's

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:25.960
all right well no what's let's resolve this well yeah I just want to just

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:30.960
explain some of this to you right because it's tough that you guys ought to be

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:37.160
knowing yeah so so wait wait help us help us I am trying to okay it just

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:42.200
spit it out it involves reading the treasure because right like okay so this

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:45.240
is a bunch of stuff you've got most of this isn't listed on your character

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:48.760
sheets there's a bunch of stuff it's two masterwork short swords two plus one

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:52.440
daggers of sharpness one poison pill one black dragon shark to stealthy let

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:56.120
their armor two thousand silver pieces one religious relic one secret message

01:06:56.120 --> 01:07:00.440
one book what to do when your church is under attack right so these are all

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:05.600
things you don't start oh I see it's it's the it's the compiled list of stuff

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:09.360
with a vast majority of this stuff is stuff you looted off the bodies of the

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:13.880
assassins okay well what is it but not all what is a black dragon shark do right

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:17.400
exactly you don't necessarily know what that does I'll tell you right now it's

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:22.040
it's it's like a magical if a geode could be magic it's like that so it's like

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:25.840
they could be they could be found and then they're like these magical stones

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:30.760
that are just native to the planet so you don't know exactly what it does because

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:34.320
it's almost as if you just found like a weird stone you know but it's it's

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:38.360
something that exists okay it's not like a weapon like a yeah it's not okay the

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:42.600
secret meant the religious relic is what Tom fell gave you a gift I have that

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:46.560
that's in your yeah so maybe we should cross that off this and then the secret

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:50.840
message was found on the assassins it was written in a in a language that Dan

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:55.280
Divined was a language used by merchants right that's the secret because they

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:58.880
work for a guild or something passes to see you so you can look at it too all

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:03.320
right so Spencer do you want to work we're back where we're we're ready to play

01:11:52.480 --> 01:12:01.120
video game D&D video game named after you Dan Harmon's pro D&D where do we

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:06.680
get the poison pills from I think you got them from the assassins yeah you took

01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:10.720
it out of their bodies from the banditos yeah all right took them out of their

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:15.360
bodies I don't know okay cuz I off their clothing and then Schrab said I have a

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:22.120
weird hand well he said a lot of things yeah discount them I don't think Schrab

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:29.000
is canonical Schrab is not cannon all right Dan are you ready to be the best

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:35.720
D&D player you've ever been yep okay Spencer help us out it's been at least

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:41.120
three weeks maybe more since we've played this so let's let's get this out

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:48.920
all right last time on Harmon well not last time like four times ago what

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:52.840
happened you guys had just solved the problems that were going on in the town

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:56.800
and you had the prior and you took them hostage well not hostage you took them

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:59.760
under arrest and you're gonna bring them back to the home church office for

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:05.000
punishment I think you did that and you were going there with pachens and then

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.280
you got be set by banditos oh boy they really stabbed the shit out of pachens

01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:15.960
and also diarrhea junior who was conked out and they took all of his clothes they

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:21.520
took pachens clothes and boned the fuck out pachens started sobbing and he was

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:25.520
like Jesus Christ oh my my life is over and you're like what's going on he's

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:29.560
like this jewel it was my whole job was to protect this jewel and it's gone oh

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:33.800
boy you search the banditos and it turns out they might not have just been

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:38.440
normal bandits or banditos they might have been some sort of hired task force

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:43.800
assassins who knows what they had special arms and armor that seemed normal

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:48.040
or better than bandito armor they had a message with a secret message in another

01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:55.640
language they had poison pills and a sack of silver pieces what else so yeah

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:59.640
it was all crazy you guys are trying to figure out what to do you were thinking

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:03.200
about maybe chasing them down you interrogated the banditos but you killed

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:06.600
them in the process you don't know what to do you were thinking about maybe

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:10.760
going back to the home office to research though the secret message and

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:15.280
turn in the mission the priors still got no you nailed it

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:20.680
perfectly timed it almost not to meta game but it almost sounds like we made

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:24.760
a mistake not having the prior with us why don't why don't we have the prior

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:31.360
with he ran off in the melee I think yeah yeah he kind of is he was tied up

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:35.600
and then I think that we started attacked and he was like untimely right

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:43.280
and then patches started complaining about his jewel and I like this is why

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:52.080
my character will will fail because he's too much like me I I got distracted by

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:56.240
patches his need I wanted to make sure he was happy can I can I take some all

01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:00.000
everyone's doing good can I take some of that stealthy leather armor is it too big

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.520
for me as a gnome right now it's too big you have you could put it on but it

01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:06.720
wouldn't work as well and you could you could also get it fitted so if you take

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:10.160
it with you you can maybe get it later all right it doesn't so go ahead does

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:19.960
anybody have any kind of ability to to locate track of the the prior we made a

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:25.680
big mistake he got away we should be going back to the headquarters of the

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:34.520
Church of the Silver Flame with him and as a guest okay well as you say that you

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:40.360
hear the the beating of hoof beats as as as hoofs pound the ground you see a

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:44.680
black horse in the night it approaches and on the black horse there's there's a

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:50.160
dark and shadowy figure yeah he's wearing brown plate mail you don't know

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:54.160
what it's made out of but it seems kind of fancy and pretty heavily worn

01:15:54.160 --> 01:16:00.800
look at that horse and on the back on the behind the writer you can see tied up

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:04.760
is the prior on the back of the horse kind of over on his stomach he he doesn't

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:08.960
look conscious you recognize this guy it's Geffen he's a veteran church

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:14.320
militant inquisitor from the LD campaign the LD campaign was a campaign that the

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:20.080
church went on it was like a crusade to purge dryads from the forest so you you

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:24.120
Dan actually know Geffen a little bit from that it's not like your great

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:27.080
buddies but he's someone you've seen around you might have fought side to side

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:30.520
with him or you know something like that you he's kind of like an old person and

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:34.800
I am an inquisitor or a template you're you're an inquisitor yeah you're you're

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:39.680
a colleague he's a is he like higher ranking than me you don't actually know

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:44.320
his ranking the church certain parts of the church hierarchy are kind of dubious

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:47.880
and it's hard to tell the levels inquisitors yeah especially with

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:51.720
inquisitors and you you're not close enough to know his exact duty he just

01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:54.880
kind of shows up and leaves and stuff so you don't know what he you don't know

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:57.800
what he does and you're not close enough to him to ask okay you're not close

01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:04.080
enough to him to have asked but I know his name yeah Geffen Geffen oh what ho

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:14.160
strangers oh no strangers are these I found some vermin scuttling about in

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:18.200
the night does this look familiar out to you he tosses the prior down from the

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.920
horse and he just lands flat on his stomach and he was unconscious and he

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:28.240
kind of awakes from the sudden impact he's all tied up it does indeed I you've

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:34.520
you found a source of our humiliation Geffen I we let this one escape and we

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:38.200
weren't supposed to thank you haha don't you don't want to tell me that because

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:41.800
I'll let you have him for the right price oh come on the yard you kicked him

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:45.680
off your horse I know it was an enticing offer wasn't it he's right there in

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:51.320
front of you well I first of all he's not exactly the we don't know that he's

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:58.360
a bad guy one silver piece come on man Geffen we work for the same company

01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:02.960
we're not supposed to charge each other for doing the company's job yeah it's

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:07.320
true they're not supposed to serve two masters but yet you know coin in the

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:12.840
flame they're pretty pretty tempting you know I'm saying yeah I think the

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:17.680
question is what's more tempting to you the coin or the flame right now the coin

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:25.400
so you're not you're not really doing the flames bidding and like two silver

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:30.240
pieces which is fine here you've presented yourself as a stranger to the

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:34.120
church you know so this isn't holy work so we'll approach it like you're a

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:39.120
traveling merchant I mean whatever you guys want man I'm just I'm just fucking

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:43.640
with you you could have them what I just thought I could get a couple gold you

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:50.560
fucking Geffen you oh you stranger oh yeah I'm Geffen well it's good to find

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:54.360
out this way that you got you and I're a little closer than I thought you that

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:58.840
we're on the fucking around level yeah yeah I show Geffen the secret message to

01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:06.440
see if he can decipher it hmm I've seen this guild language it's the language

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:10.520
the guilds use yeah it's like shorthand it's it's kind of specialized for

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:15.080
business purposes like accounting and stuff like that transactional but it

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:18.840
could be used for other things too but you can't decipher it no it's just it's

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:22.840
so common because all the scribes use it it's a very common language what we

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:26.280
need this prior we're gonna take them back to our church and you know kind of

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:30.040
get back to basics you want to come with so you want to you could just kind of

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:41.320
Deus Ex Machina yeah I just come and go thanks for resetting our A story here's

01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:44.960
here's five silver pieces because you're you seem like a good guy you're kind of

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:49.080
like that guy in Game of Thrones that the Uncle Bill or whatever that comes out

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:53.920
with his Uncle Benjen he's got those fire maces I didn't watch Game of Thrones

01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:59.160
what I watched it at your house before I thought I love game I don't watch Game

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:03.000
of Thrones I like it the most got magic who's Uncle Bill he's talking about

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Benjen it's like a half-white walker that like okay like only popped out every

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:14.400
now and then to save everybody's ass okay thanks Uncle Bill anyways I but what

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:18.560
I have one question about this yeah the guild we keep talking the guild like

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:24.200
we're acting like there's one guild guilds but but I'm sorry I'm okay I'm a

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:27.880
little I recognize the language but can't decipher it too but we're just to be

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:32.480
clear all guilds have languages all guilds have their own secret language

01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:37.520
like no no it's just a it's a language that all the guilds use like a short

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:41.560
hand like a shorthand secretarial kind of the thieves guild uses the same

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:45.800
secret language as the anti thieves guild well all the guilds tend to use the

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:49.120
language they use other languages too but when they're writing you know

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:53.600
accounting or business related stuff they'll use this guild language so it's

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:58.160
sort of a language that specializes in accounting and diplomacy or whatever

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:02.880
like a hierarchy yeah union shit you don't want to be having dwarven script

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:06.800
and then you have dwarven metals and trading them for elven wares that are

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:11.360
an elven script it's easier for everyone to just learn the guild language I think

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:16.160
I kind of get it and I'm excited about this world it's like basic it's sort of

01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:25.360
like a really lateral way of organizing the normally mishmash nature of language

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:28.640
oh it's great there's a language called common it's like it's like it's like a

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:33.640
mark it's like markdown language it's like saying like be you elf assassin

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:40.400
thief plumber if you're in the business of business let's let's do a CSS kind of

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:45.960
coding language that that maximizes the ability to transact right exactly got it

01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:49.920
but I don't speak it no me neither I step in and say hey a little less

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:54.800
jibber jabber and a little more adventuring hey man I'm just marveling

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:59.600
at this world man I know but sometimes there's shit you know that guy in the

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:07.600
in the the the the the the the the poopiness you know like shit shot 58

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:10.840
people with an automatic arrow and like we're all bummed out and I just like

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:17.120
that sometimes society does some it does function well okay all right well

01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:23.760
thanks Geffen we're gonna we're gonna scamper off over to the we will is the

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:31.720
prior week yeah we should ask him which way to go to the to the main town yeah

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:34.760
I'm kind of like a half well there's no word well the play yeah okay the player

01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:37.360
is saying I don't know where it is but the character knows where it is right

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:43.000
yeah okay yeah yeah I mean we are we are I take some rope out and read but

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:49.680
rebind and the hands and of prior but just an aside like well we're I mean I'm

01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:54.400
just saying like we like as far as I understand it like we don't we haven't

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:58.760
categorized the prior in our heads is like a bad guy no he's not like just a

01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:04.480
coward maybe an unwilling companion on this on our journey but he's not like

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:09.640
he's not it's like we have arrested him but he's not guilty of anything until a

01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:13.960
judge says so right yeah that's how I'm looking I mean I think he looked up the

01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:17.880
church sort only had to arrest him because he was threatening the safety of

01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:21.560
a kid you know yeah he was like and it may be because he's one of the good

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:27.280
guys yeah but but there was weird blood monster boogan magic going on in his

01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:31.920
basement at his church that's under his purview but as the guy that's it's like

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:39.360
if you run into a guy a guy you know after a attack he's the guy that's

01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:43.920
probably not involved well we're gonna find out the church will have something

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:50.200
to say about this sure but let's not no no I mean let's let's let's let let's let

01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:54.480
the church sort of right we're not gonna poison that well but the last time we

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:58.880
do have the poison pill he ran off and now you're good boy he's a hostile witness

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:04.360
yeah yeah he has given us reason to mistrust his he's a flight risk to the

01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:11.000
church of the silver flame to the church of the silver flame this is the song we

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.680
sang every time we traveled the rope unraveled in the kknave. of the serpent

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:29.360
flagging a veil on the right foot I was trying to do an under yeah when a flag

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:37.120
and a veil and a saddlebag gets rusty as a buckle item Tom ho and a flip-flap flow

01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:45.720
and I fuck your mama's fuck all swords she's I'm right the anvil's hammer as the anvil's

01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:53.480
might a medieval life for me by night thank god I'm a country boy

01:24:54.280 --> 01:25:01.680
well I got me a hammer and I got me a sizzle I got me a waffle and I got me a

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:07.640
whiffle ain't got a life in Lesham John Denver thank god I'm a silver flame

01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:14.760
all right later in the in the evening passes or it takes two days to travel in

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:19.600
the second evening the only notable thing that happens is on your on your

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:25.080
path in the nighttime you're you you feel the quiet broken just as if

01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:29.160
something strange has happened and you look out and you can see over the night

01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:34.000
sky over the trees and canopies of the outlying area you can see a large

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.920
muscular brown demon like a classic demon like a muscular humanoid with bat wings

01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:44.400
you know like just a classic demon but he's got classic demon yeah he's got

01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:49.960
giant giant orb like globe like glowing eyes and he's he's carrying a lantern

01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:55.320
he's like carrying a hanging lantern and he's just hanging out on the road as we're

01:25:55.320 --> 01:26:02.120
demon what's up no no no oh it's uh you you see you see him like it's very far

01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:07.120
away and he's flying over like you might see a dragon flying in the distance or

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:12.320
something or like in modern times like a like a like a black helicopter right

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:20.520
it's like a little weird but yeah and you and Diarrhea you notice it like you

01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:24.840
feel like your heart stop like in your chest and like it actually feels like

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:28.920
for a sec you're having a heart attack as you see the demon makes eye contact

01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:35.160
with you and then it just keeps flying on oh nothing else really happens it

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:39.680
doesn't seem to really I think my I think my heart just stopped how far away is he

01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:43.840
from us more than a mile but it's just he's a big guy so you can kind of see

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:48.600
it also he's carrying a lantern you see what what what is he flying over

01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:52.800
trees trees he's just doing his thing over the tree tops yeah carrying a

01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:59.640
lantern do we notice that he looked detected Diarrhea you saw him like look

01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:03.080
but you didn't see that he looked he I guess all of you kind of think he looked

01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:06.560
at you but only Steve well then he said I feel like I'm having a heart attack so

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:10.200
we turn our attention to him and say what was going on there

01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:16.920
he that his eyes were piercing looking straight at me and then my heart just

01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:24.120
stops I think it was a weird bodily reaction to that creature looking at me

01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:32.360
from my understanding of Arcana believe that demon is a searcher I may be

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:36.280
making this up he's got a lantern and he's he's looking for stuff it's

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:41.920
interesting that he sensed Diarrhea but that wasn't his objective you're right

01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:46.280
that's a demon that's got a job and his job involves looking I said we go

01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:53.200
investigate this shit oh oh that's a big demon and he's looking for something

01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:58.040
there's there's three of us and a weird prior like I think we can handle this

01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:03.280
shit we're on our way do we know he's an unfriendly demon

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:10.640
demons are unfriendly the friendliest demon is not someone you trust is this

01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:14.400
demon on the way to where we're going ago is it we'll be going out of our way

01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:19.400
on our journey to the church to go yeah it is but also it's like it's flying and

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:23.480
you guys aren't flying and it's miles away and it's flying fast so like it

01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:27.080
would be you kind of have to triangulate and then you know it would be is it

01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:30.680
flying away from our destination well yeah it's kind of going the other like

01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:35.040
it's going so we'd have to intercept his path somewhere fight far off our path

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:40.560
yeah let's just clock it like ho oh and the pilot of Pokemon like it happened

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:47.440
and we should continue on our journey it's foreshadowing I just want to take

01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:50.880
the opportunity because we're focused on travel because I just for my own

01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:56.080
edification I know the character knows this stuff but is the player I just like

01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:05.040
we were in this realm like we're in a continent called what we're in a realm

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:09.360
called just a corvair you're in the country of Thrain and we were in

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:14.600
Thrain and now so corvair is the continent Thrain is like the one of the

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:19.560
kingdoms yeah and and we were and now we're and where is this is where we're

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:23.240
headed back it's still in Thrain Thrain most most you're gonna stay in Thrain

01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:28.520
most of the campaign okay but whereas it's a city that our headquarters are

01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:34.320
in yeah it's in the it's in the county of placeholder place okay and it's at

01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:41.280
pure burn abbey pure burn like pure burning propane or something that's

01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:45.640
like the headquarters at least not maybe globally but right but in within

01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:49.320
Thrain right that well yeah the global headquarters is called flame keep but

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:53.360
you guys are kind of you know irregular so your headquarters in the flame keep

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:59.560
you're kind in a satellite office got it I like using my like either local

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:04.080
knowledge or nature knowledge or whatever can we learn anything else about

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:28.880

01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:14.360
demons okay I have no doubt that that demon is you know is related to to a

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:23.120
larger okay I'm I'm metagaming I yell to the demon hey demon you're safe

01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:29.400

01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:34.320

01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:41.480
be in no danger well you guys there's a million demons we can go we can go hunt

01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:45.520
them down one by one and end up getting killed because they're demons or we can

01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:48.800
do the job that we're supposed to be doing don't you don't you want to go back

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:53.360
home for just one night where we could shower and just like bathe and we could

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:58.360
just like I'm in a bed and it'd be so comfy and then maybe we can get like

01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:03.760
pancakes or something I'm a child of nature I mean no my the woods and the

01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:09.400
wilderness is my it's my shit I know and I I you I as a youth lived that life

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:13.240
wandering from adventure to adventure getting into any trouble that presented

01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:17.040
itself and there was no completion there the church rescued me gave me structure

01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:21.560
the church isn't perfect but it gives you a role in the universe which is to

01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:26.400
fight evil and if we depart from the church's path and just go jumping into

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:31.840
trouble then I may as well shed my silver flame pendant and and and just

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:38.000
become a regular-ass cleric wandering the fucking world hunting treasure I just

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.840
not that guy not yet you're not well I don't know what the fuck that means but

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:48.320
well how far away are we Spencer from the church my day you're pretty no you

01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:02.440
I mean silver flame first it's like I got a lot of complaints about the church's

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:06.320
run to this prior represents that maybe yeah let's turn the prior and let's

01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:11.120
let's see what I say look we press on to the church all right you get there you

01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:15.320
can see pureburn abbey as well as pureburn keep you see pureburn keep is

01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:18.680
the barracks and it's the base of the church militant that's stationed in

01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:23.200
placeholder pureburn keep works with pureburn abbey to keep the peace but

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:27.080
like the more churchy people go to the abbey and the more military people go

01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:31.680
to keep it keeps they work together to keep the piece in placeholder and keep

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:37.760
all of Corvair safe from evil you arrive at pureburn keep it's your home

01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:42.800
office it's like a classic you know coming back to the coming back to the

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:46.840
office sort of situation you go through the front door and into kind of the

01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:51.320
medieval office pool where all the inquisitors and militants hang out and

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:56.360
they have desks you know there's there's people like that it's it's not your home

01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:59.960
really because you're used to just getting shit done this is more of like a

01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:04.280
paper pusher place than for soldiers and warriors and clerics you know we have

01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:08.560
lockers and something yeah you're kind of going through the office pool where

01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:12.360
all the tables are and people are like calling you as like oh it's spooky

01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:25.160

01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:50.560
mission you're a part to the day briefing room immediately well do you

01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:53.720
want me to answer the first part or just follow the second part I don't know

01:37:53.720 --> 01:38:01.520
maybe it was meant to be given out in two parts this line we'll see you the

01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:08.280
briefing room awesome that's brother Schrader brother Schrader these names

01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:12.920
aren't super important but you know it'll be that I'm keeping every note I

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:19.640
like it yeah all right well he disappears after doing that okay like

01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:25.800
magically no no like his head was popped out of a door all right so we got it

01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:29.960
we got the briefing briefing room all right you enter the dark in you enter a

01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:34.440
darkened room lit by narrow slit windows in the thick stone walls of the keep

01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:39.080
Schrader takes a seat apart from you and seated nearby Schrader is a bishop

01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:44.720
recognizable movable recognizable by his uniform but unrecognizable in his face

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:51.040
or body or based on any of your memories okay bishops are

01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:57.200
bishops are pretty big deals within the church ministry

01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:01.880
Patchens also comes in with you and also leading up against the wall is Geffen

01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:12.400
he's there so shady shady room hey Geffen you got snacks oh no no what no all

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:19.840
right just wondering okay I I approached the bishop and is it customary to like

01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:26.440
bow or anything like a higher ranking hmm do we have like a thing I whatever no

01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:32.440
no that's like not in this kind of thing what's our saying the flame will keep

01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:38.920
the flame burns tall always keep that flame burning always keep that flame

01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:45.360
burning chaos is a ladder that's I go I've said this before but it's great

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:50.480
chaos was a ladder is a great response to condolences like I'm so sorry chaos is

01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:57.120
lack it's fine I go up to the bishop and I nod and I say I as a deference and I

01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:07.640
say the may the flame purify then may we be found worthy I walk up and say it

01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:19.560
wasn't be the fruit for it will ferment is that how you say are there seats in

01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:22.800
here yeah there's seats all right so I assume we're supposed to take a seat so

01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:28.600
yeah I turn the seat around and sit like the backwards seat like a cocky way and

01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:38.640
we have the prior with us and I I I now I I take a I untether him I say this is

01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:51.560
prior to my name Abernathy this is prior Abernathy from Roan from Roan sir he we

01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:59.040
believe he'll have more information than than we can give you we arrived at the

01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:05.600
site of a quite a kerfuffle there was there was bad things happen into

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:10.680
livestock they were doing blood magic rituals and making crazy blood

01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:16.320
boogins and the whole thing blew up yeah we heard you blew up the church we

01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:19.760
didn't blow up the church the bad guys blew up the church and we were lucky to

01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:28.000
escape with our lives I think we blew it up no didn't we no it was the creature

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.120
lady I assume that was an aside right yeah yeah just to be clear can you

01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:38.560
remind me at table talk like what did we do all of it up no but in theory you

01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:41.720
could have prevented it from being blown up right when we climbed up the ladder

01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:45.120
because it was about to blow up like something got set off and we were like

01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:54.760
okay yeah the P barrels it's true the the prior he was lost it was blood

01:41:54.760 --> 01:42:00.560
magic as my colleague is telling you taking place that Abernathy here claims

01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:04.840
to be ignorant of all of it I don't disbelieve him but I didn't want to

01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:09.840
interrogate him without turning him into the the church that's that's our full

01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:17.600
report Abernathy should hopefully have less trouble telling you the full story

01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:21.400
we should probably also talk to petty cash about replacing a couple doors for

01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:28.600
the fell family we we we kind of let a few things on fire all right I want to

01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:32.440
put in a good word for Abernathy before anything begins and that I think that he

01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:35.720
was the prior for my observation of an ambient that had gone awry had been

01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:39.560
infiltrated by an evil force I believe he was dealing with it I believe it pushed

01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:44.240
him over an edge so he was in danger of harming others that we personally had

01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:49.120
exercised already we brought him here against his will because his will was to

01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:55.280
run but I believe that's because he's aligned with the church I just wanted to

01:42:55.280 --> 01:43:01.240
put in a good word for him sounds good I appreciate your candor and your honesty

01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:07.360
and your uh what's what's just being a good detective like what's gum gum

01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:12.960
sherry yeah and your gum sherry so just rate this one up for the logs you can

01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:17.760
collect your pay from Zellie in the commissary sweet we'll take Patchens and

01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:24.120
abs and Abernathy and talk to him for a bit yeah so Patchens you should tell

01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:27.960
the Patchens is looking at you like he doesn't want you to say anything what

01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:33.280
we're not on salary we get paid per job you are on salary and you get paid per

01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:37.160
job oh sweet patching doesn't want me to talk about sidebar patching doesn't want

01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:40.600
me to talk about the fact that he lost an important yeah he's looking at you like

01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:45.480
he'll die if that comes out as a patch not like he'll die like he'll be fired

01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:50.720
life I finished myself a patch and I see the luck on your passions this guy

01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:56.360
he's the shit and then we walk up yes sir I sorry Bishop I should have also

01:43:56.360 --> 01:44:01.600
commended this young man Patchens he was a huge aid to us he didn't know who to

01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:06.200
trust but he trusted us he helped us a great deal and he's been under a lot of

01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:12.160
duress and we were we were assailed by bandits along the way back and he was

01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:15.840
hurt very badly I hope that the church will take care of him make him

01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:20.520
comfortable and I'd also like to know when he'll be released from debriefing so

01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:26.120
that I can buy him a beer and give him my personal thanks it shouldn't take more

content I had an audio video portion whoa we can I don't really we could cut the

01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:35.000
audio I can give the audio to actually be cut in I could put the file online so

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.240
that the audience can see it but it's not gonna be perfectly viewable for us

01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:43.920
you know does that make sense should we do as a cliffhanger and do it when we're

01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:48.240
back on stage live or should we go out and fight that demon I don't I think we

01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:52.280
should at least I don't know I guess we should probably stop soon huh but yeah

01:45:52.280 --> 01:46:02.160
we should at least I want to play it's been three weeks I don't know we can

01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:12.040
pretend for Spencer trying to follow my dream of having an AV I can church can

01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:27.480
podcast like I want you to be rewarded well this is my reward this is gonna be

01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:31.000
your shining moment here we go all right first of all you became president of

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:59.640
the United States today we got a final grade of a D plus yeah see those

01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:03.640
listening it's I got this it's basically made like the video game for

01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:07.560
equivalent of like when a dungeon master like tells you your campaign you're

01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:11.680
or not your campaign your mission is his over and like he's here's your

01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:18.120
experience but we got graded we saved four people we got a D plus overall the

01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:22.080
A we got was for time right because it happens really I guess that assumes we

01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:28.920
rushed I mean that was a good thing but so we probably should have been a

01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:33.160
little more diligent that's good to know well that's the thing is that like you

01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:36.120
know you play these video games and then you're like I did okay and then you get

01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:39.760
the score and it's like wait wait wait here's what we're measuring right how

01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:44.720
many gold pieces do we get no that was collateral you caused 500 gold

01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:51.520
part away there's gonna have our yeah that's amazing all right so that makes

01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:55.840
you want to keep playing more so yeah more well that's I mean I think that was

01:49:55.840 --> 01:50:00.120
Spencer's right successful goal was that he's like why don't we make this feel

01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:04.360
you give you the dopamine spike of us of a mission that's finished well or not

01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:07.880
okay and then you're like God okay so now you get a kind of a fresh start of

01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:11.600
the next one that would have been a smash it with an audience I know it was a

01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:18.800
great idea I have good ideas it's almost like we should have had permits for our

01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:22.840
new venue yeah no it's cool I should if I didn't bitch out that one time when we

01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:26.040
were gonna play D&D what happened probably now do are we gonna get a new

01:50:26.040 --> 01:50:29.760
a new adventure now we're gonna talk about a new mission you're embarking on

01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:32.440
a new that's so exciting now we know the characters and now we're like in

01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:35.840
placeholder and then we like I'm going to the tavern and I'm gonna have a drink

01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:40.040
and then yeah so many storylines to look so we can all turn to each other and

01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:47.080
say okay D plus not our best right lots of mistakes were made but we kind of

01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:52.560
know who we are now we kind of know how to use our spells a little bit we we

01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:57.200
worked as a team we failed kind of as a team but a D plus is better than an F

01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:00.840
but I want to get better and I can now because I can take notes I want to I

01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:04.640
want to learn to use note-taking software the best way possible so that like when

01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:08.880
we meet a character I can like hashtag it yeah so that it's like I'll have a

01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:13.040
list of all the characters and you know like I'm gonna fucking nail this okay

01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:18.600
so now that was dismissed who's our who's our main man who's Charlie to our

01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:23.100
angels that's gonna give us our new thing how about brother Absalom brother

01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:30.680
Absalom yeah brother Absalom are we still going anyways no I do want I do

01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:33.680
want to particularly irony here though that we you know like I've been this

01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:37.800
Howard Hughes obsession person about the new venue and how we're gonna show

01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:42.960
video and audio and stuff and Spencer's what Spencer finally it's like a fucking

01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:48.000
really funny irony there that Spencer secretly was like you know what I'm

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:52.880
gonna I'm gonna blow their socks yeah do what Dan's keeps babbling about and

01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:56.600
like do the audio visual thing at the end of a Dungeons and Dragons I'm gonna

01:51:56.600 --> 01:51:59.640
back them up and do this and then it's like the fireworks all comes in and I

01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:04.000
spent 90 minutes talking about how thrilled I was that we're not

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:13.480
it's fine well this would have been better if we I think that's really beautiful I

01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:20.520
know it's a sitcom it's hard to parts and wreck level I love but yeah thank you

01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:25.600
well it sounds like we're teed up for next time for a new mission right I

01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:29.080
feel it's pretty safe to say the next time next Harmontown episode is going

01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:34.880
to be in this format we're not gonna just like leap into some willy-nilly live

01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:40.200
venue I'd rather refine this experience while we wait for the castle to become

01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:45.040
legal yeah then run around town trying to figure out where in LA we can I say

01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:49.320
we we learn briefly to get good at this and then use live venues when it's

01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:53.440
when it's time to do that and we know and now we've we've added another knife

01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:59.240
to our Swiss Army knife yeah like our utility belt yeah like we can we we've

01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:03.240
expanded we grew a little bit mm-hmm you die a little bit and you grow a little

01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:09.200
yeah welcome to the strangest era of Harmontown yet Harmontown nights you'll

01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:16.280
float to so we have we have a we have a not not just a cliffhanger we have like

01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:20.520
like we we know that we have a new adventure in a new episode coming up

01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:24.760
of our D&D but we have so many things to investigate now you already know about

01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:32.240
it's it's daunting it is well you guys we did it it was a fun experience I hope

01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:38.120
