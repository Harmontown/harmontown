00:00.000 --> 00:13.040
From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, the nerdest, smeltiest, smeltiest melt theater,

00:13.040 --> 00:17.040
Harmontown is now in session.

00:17.040 --> 00:26.040
Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden.

00:26.040 --> 00:41.040
The mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:41.040 --> 00:43.040
Thank you so much.

00:43.040 --> 00:44.040
I really want to apologize.

00:44.040 --> 00:52.040
I'm so sorry about the amount of Nidoran that are here.

00:52.040 --> 00:57.040
Oh, man, that's one of the Pokemons.

00:57.040 --> 01:00.040
I wanted to gauge how pervasive this was overnight.

01:00.040 --> 01:05.040
I downloaded it today, and I'm at level four.

01:05.040 --> 01:10.040
And I've already wandered into traffic for a Pokeman.

01:10.040 --> 01:17.040
And then I've already had, like Cody and I, we walked a block to stop at some Poke stops.

01:17.040 --> 01:26.040
And so we already had the guy stop his car and go, let me guess, Pokemon?

01:26.040 --> 01:27.040
Wait, for real?

01:27.040 --> 01:32.040
That guy, that guy's not an official part of the game, but...

01:32.040 --> 01:38.040
And Cody and I walked, and Cody's like, wow, this game's so popular.

01:38.040 --> 01:43.040
I'm like, yeah, it's so popular it's created a sub-biosphere of fucking rapey dudes trying to...

01:43.040 --> 01:52.040
Yeah, Pokemon, it's like, well, let's tell you what, I don't get it, but get in my car, let's talk about it.

01:52.040 --> 01:55.040
Which was okay, what are you doing over there?

01:55.040 --> 01:57.040
You playing that Pokemon card?

01:57.040 --> 01:59.040
Fuck you!

01:59.040 --> 02:02.040
Sorry, is it weird that I went there?

02:02.040 --> 02:04.040
Because otherwise, what's he doing?

02:04.040 --> 02:05.040
Is that a positive thing?

02:05.040 --> 02:08.040
And he's like, oh, damn it, if that's not two young people playing Pokemon...

02:08.040 --> 02:10.040
Oh, one's old, okay.

02:10.040 --> 02:13.040
Hey, what's going on with the Pokemons?

02:13.040 --> 02:15.040
But how could he tell you're playing Pokemons?

02:15.040 --> 02:18.040
Because you were looking at your phone and being excited?

02:18.040 --> 02:20.040
Well, that's, I think that's...

02:20.040 --> 02:22.040
Well, playing Ski-Ball and a fake thing?

02:22.040 --> 02:26.040
Well, that's an expression of how explosively popular this game got overnight,

02:26.040 --> 02:31.040
is that he saw two people just looking at their phones.

02:31.040 --> 02:37.040
So last Tuesday, he would have gone, you fucking, probably looking for a goddamn yelp.

02:37.040 --> 02:41.040
You guys, you, you, you words with friends?

02:41.040 --> 02:43.040
Yeah, exactly.

02:43.040 --> 02:45.040
Yeah, he would have just like, it was just some general thing.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.040
He would have just called us Jews or something.

02:47.040 --> 02:50.040
I don't know, whatever his hang-up is.

02:50.040 --> 02:54.040
But he, that guy, it had reached his life that he, even though he's from New Jersey

02:54.040 --> 02:59.040
and is driving a Gremlin from a portal from 1975 straight through,

02:59.040 --> 03:05.040
as he just crosses his trans-dimensional, you know, like weird trailer,

03:05.040 --> 03:10.040
or Dr. Strange Journey, like as he goes through, that he saw us and was like,

03:10.040 --> 03:13.040
oh, Pokemon, but anyways, I just didn't like the guy.

03:13.040 --> 03:14.040
I didn't like his style.

03:14.040 --> 03:17.040
I didn't like that he looked at my woman.

03:17.040 --> 03:19.040
But he was right, though.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.040
He was hip to your job.

03:20.040 --> 03:21.040
We were playing Pokemon.

03:21.040 --> 03:22.040
Right.

03:22.040 --> 03:26.040
And I haven't, obviously, I haven't caught them all.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.040
Can you catch all of the Pokemons?

03:28.040 --> 03:30.040
That's the goal.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.040
Allegedly.

03:31.040 --> 03:37.040
I got some snake snitchers, I got some mitten asses, I got kitten, kitten, kitten bitches,

03:37.040 --> 03:40.040
and I got like, like stamp, stamp, stamp.

03:40.040 --> 03:42.040
The elusive kitten bitch.

03:42.040 --> 03:44.040
I can't believe you got that on level four.

03:44.040 --> 03:47.040
I thought that was more like a level 10 Pokemon.

03:47.040 --> 03:48.040
But here's the amazing thing.

03:48.040 --> 03:54.040
Like, when Dungeons and Dragons became popular or like Space Invaders, like, there's been,

03:54.040 --> 03:59.040
like, if you go back into the archives, it's kind of funny through your young eyes,

03:59.040 --> 04:07.040
if you would look at, like, just go Google, like, Space Invaders, I'm trying to, like,

04:07.040 --> 04:12.040
what the phrase would be, like, a threat to society or something like that.

04:12.040 --> 04:18.040
It's like a fascinating 1978, like, Tom Brokaw video about Space Invaders and what.

04:18.040 --> 04:24.040
It's like a news story about how a guy murdered his wife because she wouldn't let him keep

04:24.040 --> 04:26.040
playing Space Invaders.

04:26.040 --> 04:32.040
People talking about, they call it Space Invader Thumb.

04:32.040 --> 04:39.040
More commonly known as Carpal Tunnel, but yeah, definitely Space Invaders is causing this.

04:39.040 --> 04:43.040
And just like, and then the Dungeons and Dragons with the people under the tunnels.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.040
I, I, there was a thing.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.040
They were under the tunnels.

04:46.040 --> 04:49.040
They weren't even in the tunnels, they were dark elves.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.040
They would go underneath the tunnels.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.040
Yeah, these are D&D people.

04:52.040 --> 04:55.040
They don't, they don't cotton to tunnels, man.

04:55.040 --> 04:56.040
That's underground.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.040
They're, they're, they're underneath.

04:58.040 --> 05:03.040
Yeah, there's a, in the 80s Dungeons and Dragons was like a gangster rap.

05:03.040 --> 05:08.040
It was like, it was like, it was like, it was the thing that moms were worried about.

05:08.040 --> 05:13.040
And, and, and there was, and there was, there was an urban legend that in colleges,

05:13.040 --> 05:16.040
they would play the game and then they would sacrifice.

05:16.040 --> 05:20.040
And then there were like steam tunnels underneath the campuses and these kids had,

05:20.040 --> 05:23.040
it was very similar to the baby alligator legend.

05:23.040 --> 05:28.040
That's like the, the idea that like anything that seems innocent could like go down

05:28.040 --> 05:33.040
underneath your world and grow into something monstrous.

05:33.040 --> 05:37.040
It's, it's, it's, it's an urban legend about like what's happening under your nose.

05:37.040 --> 05:41.040
And, and so the Dungeons and Dragons was like, these kids go down.

05:41.040 --> 05:46.040
They, they, they start playing this game with dice and then they sink down through the

05:46.040 --> 05:50.040
soil of the campus you paid for and into these tunnels.

05:50.040 --> 05:54.040
And they, and they pull out real swords and they start stabbing each other.

05:54.040 --> 05:59.040
And that was all based on one kid who went missing from one college and it turned out

05:59.040 --> 06:06.040
way more to do with heroin and, and, and, and, and also he was like a 15 year old kid

06:06.040 --> 06:10.040
going to school with, he was like Wormser in Revenge of the Nerds.

06:10.040 --> 06:13.040
He was like that archetype was like, he was so smart that they said,

06:13.040 --> 06:15.040
well you should skip high school, right?

06:15.040 --> 06:19.040
You might be Einstein and put him in a school with 20 year olds.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.040
And he was 15.

06:20.040 --> 06:25.040
He had so many more things to deal with than Dungeons and Dragons.

06:25.040 --> 06:30.040
But no one ever said, oh, well, our class system is making people stab disappear.

06:30.040 --> 06:35.040
Anyways, yeah, he came back after a while and said, no, I just shot smack and sucked a couple dicks.

06:35.040 --> 06:38.040
Like, I, I wanted to see the world.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.040
I figured out you morons weren't going to show it to me.

06:40.040 --> 06:42.040
Locked me up in this shithole.

06:42.040 --> 06:46.040
Like he just fucking wandered off and crashed into the dude's house and was like,

06:46.040 --> 06:50.040
like, like, like, yeah, like getting high, like making love.

06:50.040 --> 06:54.040
And then he came back and was like, all right, I'm 16 now.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.040
Time to get down to business.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.040
And then they were like, but what about the Dungeons and Dragons?

06:58.040 --> 06:59.040
He was like, what, what?

06:59.040 --> 07:00.040
I said, well, what?

07:00.040 --> 07:01.040
No.

07:01.040 --> 07:02.040
Morons?

07:02.040 --> 07:03.040
Anyways, I forgot where I was.

07:03.040 --> 07:04.040
I'm sorry.

07:04.040 --> 07:05.040
The Pokemons.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.040
Yeah, well.

07:06.040 --> 07:10.040
So wait, is it, when you level up enough, level five, as I understand it,

07:10.040 --> 07:11.040
you can start joining a team?

07:11.040 --> 07:13.040
Yeah, that's, that's my goal.

07:13.040 --> 07:18.040
Wait, you're on the same team?

07:18.040 --> 07:19.040
No.

07:19.040 --> 07:21.040
Wait, Jesus Christ.

07:21.040 --> 07:24.040
No, you can be on your own team.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.040
This seems healthy.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.040
Wait, no, you can't wait.

07:27.040 --> 07:29.040
You have to pick one of the three.

07:29.040 --> 07:32.040
You get to pick from three primary colors.

07:32.040 --> 07:35.040
Why, why are you guys so vehemently yellow?

07:35.040 --> 07:36.040
Fuck up.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.040
Because I'm Asian.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.040
Oh God.

07:39.040 --> 07:42.040
This seems like a bad road.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.040
All right.

07:43.040 --> 07:45.040
I don't approve of this anymore.

07:45.040 --> 07:49.040
It makes me want to go shoot smack and suck a couple of dicks.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.040
Honestly.

07:50.040 --> 07:53.040
It seems like the easier road.

07:53.040 --> 08:00.040
That guy that shouted yellow because I'm Asian, like, like, is he going to go home

08:00.040 --> 08:05.040
and write a Facebook essay about Black Lives Matter or anything?

08:05.040 --> 08:07.040
Like a not connect the dots?

08:07.040 --> 08:10.040
Like, all right, let's not let our Pokemon.

08:10.040 --> 08:12.040
We collected little, little gagoos.

08:12.040 --> 08:14.040
I didn't think you had to choose between blue races.

08:14.040 --> 08:16.040
Are there blues or reds here?

08:16.040 --> 08:17.040
Okay.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.040
Oh, so it's evenly dispersed.

08:19.040 --> 08:22.040
But why were the yellows so vocal up front?

08:22.040 --> 08:24.040
Because I'm in the front row.

08:24.040 --> 08:27.040
Okay, Jesus Christ.

08:27.040 --> 08:31.040
There's a lot of yellow people shifting to blue because of you tonight.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.040
Because they're like, it's called the blue shift.

08:33.040 --> 08:34.040
It's called the blue shift.

08:34.040 --> 08:35.040
No one knows what the culture is yet.

08:35.040 --> 08:36.040
They're like, what are the stereotypes?

08:36.040 --> 08:38.040
Do blue people drive like this?

08:38.040 --> 08:43.040
Do yellow women move in with each other right away?

08:43.040 --> 08:44.040
I don't know yet.

08:44.040 --> 08:46.040
I need to talk to some people out in the real world.

08:46.040 --> 08:49.040
Oh, Snaker, Snaker Clouder.

08:49.040 --> 08:53.040
Are you capturing Pokemons on stage?

08:53.040 --> 08:56.040
Well, that was an imaginary one.

08:56.040 --> 08:59.040
I didn't do a good job of riffing the name of one, did I?

08:59.040 --> 09:01.040
Snaker Clouder.

09:01.040 --> 09:05.040
But this game, Dan and Cody talked me into downloading it.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.040
I looked at it.

09:06.040 --> 09:10.040
It looks like Google Maps, but there's little dragons on it.

09:10.040 --> 09:13.040
And then you're walking around a map of your neighborhood

09:13.040 --> 09:17.040
and it's trying to convince me to walk down an alleyway

09:17.040 --> 09:21.040
where I'm certainly going to be waylaid by thugs.

09:21.040 --> 09:23.040
Yeah, that's already the thing is there's already...

09:23.040 --> 09:25.040
40 people have died already.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.040
40 confirmed deaths all at once.

09:27.040 --> 09:30.040
No, everyone's walking into traffic, but also there's already two stories

09:30.040 --> 09:32.040
that are like top of the...

09:32.040 --> 09:35.040
Usually when you swipe too far left on your iPhone

09:35.040 --> 09:41.040
you get four of the stories from the state-controlled media.

09:41.040 --> 09:44.040
The top three are Donald Trump said something orange

09:44.040 --> 09:46.040
and the bottom one is Hillary Clinton.

09:46.040 --> 09:50.040
Is she too much or too little? This or that?

09:50.040 --> 09:55.040
But one of them is like Pokemon Robbery Ring.

09:55.040 --> 09:59.040
These guys lure you to a Pokemon place and they rob you.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.040
I think it's the yellows.

10:01.040 --> 10:03.040
It's got to be the yellows.

10:03.040 --> 10:07.040
It seems like the yellows are more likely to get you.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.040
But do I have to learn all new things?

10:09.040 --> 10:12.040
Because the Asian guy was vehemently yellow.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.040
So do we have to connect those dots?

10:14.040 --> 10:17.040
Are the yellows like strategic and sly?

10:17.040 --> 10:19.040
Or are we switching it up?

10:19.040 --> 10:21.040
Is that the joy of it?

10:21.040 --> 10:25.040
The yellows are like belligerent and they drop out of high school.

10:25.040 --> 10:27.040
You vocal, sir, on the front row.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.040
You're yellow, right?

10:29.040 --> 10:31.040
Is there a yellow identity?

10:31.040 --> 10:33.040
Team Insight.

10:33.040 --> 10:38.040
Electric Thunderbird as our logo.

10:38.040 --> 10:42.040
If that's not made up, that's really good.

10:42.040 --> 10:44.040
But what do you think about the blues and the reds?

10:44.040 --> 10:46.040
Define the blues from the yellows.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.040
There are a bunch of fucking tools.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.040
A bunch of tools.

10:49.040 --> 10:50.040
Reds.

10:50.040 --> 10:52.040
A bunch of fuckers.

10:52.040 --> 10:54.040
A bunch of fuckers.

10:54.040 --> 11:00.040
You gotta pepper it with like, oh, you mean blue bros?

11:00.040 --> 11:02.040
Like, I think you go like, yeah, they...

11:02.040 --> 11:06.040
I go at 3am to get the elementary school near my house.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.040
Okay, now...

11:08.040 --> 11:13.040
You go at 3am to the elementary school near your house.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.040
Keep talking.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.040
To capture it.

11:15.040 --> 11:22.040
To capture the elementary school when there's no children present.

11:22.040 --> 11:27.040
I know, you get three pokeballs when you walk by it.

11:27.040 --> 11:29.040
No, no, no, this is a gym.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.040
Oh.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.040
You battle at the children's school.

11:32.040 --> 11:34.040
Yeah, I battle at the gym and I take it for team yellow.

11:34.040 --> 11:37.040
But you go there, you literally go there at 3am?

11:37.040 --> 11:42.040
You are prowling a elementary school gymnasium at 3am.

11:42.040 --> 11:45.040
To take control away from kids.

11:45.040 --> 11:48.040
To capture the children's gym.

11:48.040 --> 11:53.040
To take it from children when they're not there to defend themselves.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.040
Exactly.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.040
Children.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.040
Children.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.040
Elementary school.

11:57.040 --> 12:01.040
Then I go to sleep and when I wake up I go back to elementary school and those blue fuckers

12:01.040 --> 12:02.040
have taken it.

12:02.040 --> 12:06.040
Well, yeah, because they're less weird.

12:06.040 --> 12:08.040
That's fucking horrifying.

12:08.040 --> 12:09.040
Why are...

12:09.040 --> 12:11.040
How old are you?

12:11.040 --> 12:12.040
22.

12:12.040 --> 12:13.040
22.

12:13.040 --> 12:17.040
So you got 22-year-olds literally physically outside the elementary school?

12:17.040 --> 12:21.040
Yeah, they're setting up poke lures and hiding in the bushes.

12:21.040 --> 12:25.040
Ruin through tall grass, waiting for kindergartners to work by.

12:25.040 --> 12:30.040
The game is simply setting waypoints for a very rudimentary scavenger hunt.

12:30.040 --> 12:36.040
It's sort of been used in jogging apps where you pick up apples by cross-training.

12:36.040 --> 12:37.040
Yeah, Waze too.

12:37.040 --> 12:39.040
Yeah, Waze is a...

12:39.040 --> 12:42.040
I'm not pissing at it, but I just think it's amazing that we've...

12:42.040 --> 12:43.040
No, it's fine.

12:43.040 --> 12:51.040
I'm all into it, but I'm stepping back and going how funny it is that they made us leave our apartments

12:51.040 --> 12:55.040
and then the first thing that's happening is all these news stories about, like,

12:55.040 --> 12:57.040
yeah, and then someone got raped.

12:57.040 --> 13:02.040
Have you heard about the person that's using it to start a million-dollar business?

13:02.040 --> 13:08.040
They call it Pokemoning, and it's getting people moving around the street corners.

13:08.040 --> 13:13.040
My daughter started selling lemonade, and she said there was a Pokemon there,

13:13.040 --> 13:15.040
and someone came and talked to her.

13:15.040 --> 13:17.040
It sounds like the Warriors were like,

13:17.040 --> 13:22.040
hey, yellows, you got to make it down to Coney Island before sunrise.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.040
Can you dig it?

13:24.040 --> 13:26.040
Suckers!

13:26.040 --> 13:27.040
Oh, my God.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.040
Have you got some blues coming after you and some fucking...

13:29.040 --> 13:32.040
Have you guys seen the Warriors in a minute?

13:32.040 --> 13:33.040
Yeah!

13:33.040 --> 13:34.040
It's pretty...

13:34.040 --> 13:35.040
Oh, yeah.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.040
So it's a cult classic.

13:36.040 --> 13:42.040
Now, you guys are, this is like 200 creepily hip people here.

13:42.040 --> 13:44.040
You mean good-looking.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.040
They're good-looking.

13:45.040 --> 13:47.040
But that's...

13:47.040 --> 13:51.040
We're one guitar player away from a hot music video going on right now.

13:51.040 --> 13:56.040
Yeah, the Shakespearean Herald, or what Joss Whedon, Cameron of the Woods,

13:56.040 --> 13:58.040
maybe we call the Harbinger, the...

13:58.040 --> 14:04.040
in Warriors is a foxy black DJ lady,

14:04.040 --> 14:06.040
and all you ever see are her lips, I think.

14:06.040 --> 14:11.040
They're like these glossy lips that they're like one centimeter from her.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.040
Hello, children.

14:12.040 --> 14:13.040
Hey, bloods.

14:13.040 --> 14:18.040
So it seems like the Warriors are on the tiki-tok tonight,

14:18.040 --> 14:21.040
trying to make it from Third to Main Street.

14:21.040 --> 14:25.040
God bless you if you can get through the baseball boys.

14:25.040 --> 14:27.040
The baseball furies.

14:27.040 --> 14:30.040
They were basically on, I guess, an Odissian journey,

14:30.040 --> 14:33.040
going through the boroughs of New York

14:33.040 --> 14:36.040
and getting attacked by thematic gangs.

14:36.040 --> 14:39.040
But I just think it's amazing that the lady...

14:39.040 --> 14:43.040
I don't know if we ever... I bet we never saw that Lady's Eyes.

14:43.040 --> 14:47.040
You just saw these foxy 70s lips,

14:47.040 --> 14:51.040
and they shot that out in an hour.

14:51.040 --> 14:53.040
Imagine them shooting that.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.040
Okay, Carly.

14:55.040 --> 14:56.040
Page three.

14:56.040 --> 14:57.040
Okay, all right.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.040
So a series of them?

14:58.040 --> 14:59.040
Yeah.

14:59.040 --> 15:01.040
Warriors, watch out.

15:01.040 --> 15:03.040
Warriors, watch out.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.040
Come on.

15:04.040 --> 15:05.040
Fox it up.

15:05.040 --> 15:08.040
Come on, you're foxy.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.040
I think you have a different relationship with that movie

15:10.040 --> 15:12.040
than I do.

15:12.040 --> 15:15.040
In my childhood, that was on select TV.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.040
I'll explain it later.

15:17.040 --> 15:20.040
But the Warriors, I saw it so many times with my brother

15:20.040 --> 15:22.040
that one day my brother was like,

15:22.040 --> 15:24.040
we should be one of these gangs.

15:24.040 --> 15:25.040
Yeah, we should.

15:25.040 --> 15:29.040
And we were the baseball bat boys.

15:29.040 --> 15:31.040
The baseball got to where we ran around the neighborhood

15:31.040 --> 15:32.040
with baseball bats.

15:32.040 --> 15:35.040
Hashtag white privilege means...

15:35.040 --> 15:39.040
Seeing a movie and deciding to run around your neighborhood

15:39.040 --> 15:42.040
with a baseball bat, and then later on,

15:42.040 --> 15:44.040
the story ends with me hanging out and doing a podcast

15:44.040 --> 15:46.040
instead of some horrible thing.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.040
I looked back and I was like,

15:48.040 --> 15:49.040
what the fuck were we doing?

15:49.040 --> 15:51.040
We were running around.

15:51.040 --> 15:54.040
We saw a movie that said it was cool to run around

15:54.040 --> 15:57.040
with baseball bats, got baseball bats from the garage,

15:57.040 --> 16:00.040
and emulated the characters by running around the neighborhood

16:00.040 --> 16:02.040
with baseball bats in our hands,

16:02.040 --> 16:04.040
like looking to beat people up.

16:04.040 --> 16:06.040
We didn't do it, but we were like, in our heads,

16:06.040 --> 16:08.040
we were like, we're a gang.

16:08.040 --> 16:11.040
We're playing gang, gang.

16:11.040 --> 16:14.040
So it was a simpler time, man.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.040
Matt Gorley and I, in eighth grade,

16:16.040 --> 16:18.040
we were going to the Whitwood Mall on Whittier,

16:18.040 --> 16:20.040
and we had...

16:20.040 --> 16:22.040
Did they get a what-what for Whitwood Mall?

16:22.040 --> 16:23.040
For real?

16:23.040 --> 16:26.040
Oh, wow, sorry.

16:26.040 --> 16:29.040
To get all your what-whats, go to Whitford.

16:29.040 --> 16:31.040
The Warriors are...

16:31.040 --> 16:34.040
Don't get wasted, fools.

16:34.040 --> 16:35.040
But we would go in there.

16:35.040 --> 16:39.040
Matt Gorley had replica guns,

16:39.040 --> 16:42.040
and we would go and put them in our belts under our shirts

16:42.040 --> 16:44.040
and walk through a mall,

16:44.040 --> 16:47.040
because we were playing James Bond,

16:47.040 --> 16:50.040
and we were walking through the mall with Walther P38s

16:50.040 --> 16:52.040
and our PPKs.

16:52.040 --> 16:54.040
We had never had any intention of pulling them out

16:54.040 --> 16:57.040
or scaring anybody, but we really...

16:57.040 --> 17:00.040
That was a horrible intention.

17:00.040 --> 17:02.040
I don't know if this tops that or not,

17:02.040 --> 17:06.040
but here's a little fun time activity I did once.

17:06.040 --> 17:08.040
Me and my friend, Dan Ramstack,

17:08.040 --> 17:09.040
living in our lower village...

17:09.040 --> 17:11.040
Ramstack?

17:11.040 --> 17:13.040
I'll never get over that name, by the way.

17:13.040 --> 17:16.040
We made a fake bomb once, and we...

17:16.040 --> 17:18.040
Oh, I made real bombs?

17:18.040 --> 17:20.040
I made real pipe bombs.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.040
We learned how to make a light blinker.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.040
We made it purposely look like a bomb,

17:24.040 --> 17:28.040
like in that we made it look weird and like dramatic.

17:28.040 --> 17:29.040
MacGyver with blinking lights.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.040
It was just a good look.

17:31.040 --> 17:36.040
We put it on a telephone pole and then ran away.

17:36.040 --> 17:41.040
Because we were cognizant of the terror that we were causing.

17:41.040 --> 17:44.040
We weren't like, oh, and everyone will...

17:44.040 --> 17:47.040
Because this is right after the Archduke Ferdinand was killed

17:47.040 --> 17:49.040
that set off World War I.

17:49.040 --> 17:52.040
You were part of the Black Fist.

17:52.040 --> 17:54.040
I just remember the year was 1912.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.040
Electrical tape on the back of it,

17:55.040 --> 17:58.040
and the last thing that we did before the authorities got involved

17:58.040 --> 18:04.040
is we stuck it to the bottom of the screen door of my neighbor

18:04.040 --> 18:06.040
and rang the doorbell.

18:06.040 --> 18:08.040
So when he came to the screen door,

18:08.040 --> 18:15.040
he looked down and saw this weird mass of E.T. circuit boards

18:15.040 --> 18:17.040
and things with a blinking light on it.

18:17.040 --> 18:23.040
And he just called the cops,

18:23.040 --> 18:29.040
and then the crazy shit, like a bomb squad came.

18:29.040 --> 18:34.040
But it was the 80s, but he must have called them and said,

18:34.040 --> 18:37.040
there's a bomb on my door.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.040
I don't know.

18:38.040 --> 18:39.040
I don't know.

18:39.040 --> 18:40.040
This story didn't go well.

18:40.040 --> 18:41.040
It was a simpler time.

18:41.040 --> 18:45.040
We did a thing that the richer kids, they had pools.

18:45.040 --> 18:50.040
We would sneak into their backyards and take the pool acid.

18:50.040 --> 18:52.040
It was like a heavy-duty acid that would clean the pool.

18:52.040 --> 18:54.040
And if you took a certain amount of that

18:54.040 --> 18:59.040
and you put it in like a two-liter, like 7-up or a Coke bottle

18:59.040 --> 19:02.040
and rolled up some tinfoil and put it in that,

19:02.040 --> 19:07.040
you had about a minute and a half head start to get the fuck out of town.

19:07.040 --> 19:10.040
And we would put it in people's metal mailboxes.

19:10.040 --> 19:15.040
And the gas would expand that and blow up the mailbox.

19:15.040 --> 19:18.040
It was an anti-personnel.

19:18.040 --> 19:23.040
And we would just drive around town blowing shit up.

19:23.040 --> 19:25.040
Here's another one you shouldn't do.

19:25.040 --> 19:31.040
If you live on a hill, we would steal bowling balls from the bowling alley.

19:31.040 --> 19:36.040
And we'd go up to where the rich kids lived up in the high hills

19:36.040 --> 19:39.040
with a long street that goes straight down.

19:39.040 --> 19:42.040
And you would take lighter fluid and you would cover the bowling ball

19:42.040 --> 19:45.040
and lighter fluid and fill the holes up with lighter fluid

19:45.040 --> 19:49.040
and light it on fire and just send it down the road.

19:49.040 --> 19:54.040
Because when it got there, it was going through four walls on fire.

19:54.040 --> 19:58.040
I don't know how I ever didn't do federal time.

19:58.040 --> 20:00.040
I thought, well, just segue into that,

20:00.040 --> 20:02.040
not to bring the show to a grinding hot,

20:02.040 --> 20:05.040
but I just like, I did want to...

20:05.040 --> 20:11.040
Like, how much of that do you tie to this new word privilege?

20:11.040 --> 20:13.040
Like, do you look back on that and go,

20:13.040 --> 20:18.040
oh, I had no idea that I was doing shit and getting away with it.

20:18.040 --> 20:21.040
Black guy on the front row just ran out of here.

20:21.040 --> 20:25.040
I mean, he didn't just walk out.

20:25.040 --> 20:28.040
He scurried.

20:28.040 --> 20:33.040
I was like, I come here to get away from this shit.

20:33.040 --> 20:38.040
I thought he'd talk about Pokemon.

20:38.040 --> 20:40.040
Oh, no, certainly.

20:40.040 --> 20:43.040
The hashtag, what is it, white privilege means?

20:43.040 --> 20:44.040
Is that what it said?

20:44.040 --> 20:46.040
They just had a little swell.

20:46.040 --> 20:49.040
I clicked on it because I knew what I was going to see.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.040
I wanted to study this.

20:51.040 --> 20:54.040
It's just like a little pastiche of like,

20:54.040 --> 20:56.040
I kind of feel like...

20:56.040 --> 20:58.040
You look at it and you just shudder.

20:58.040 --> 21:00.040
You're mostly shuddering, of course,

21:00.040 --> 21:07.040
when you're seeing the reflexive, reverse, defensive racism.

21:07.040 --> 21:13.040
It's just like this weird outrage where it's like,

21:13.040 --> 21:17.040
it's like somebody going like,

21:17.040 --> 21:19.040
when no matter what you do,

21:19.040 --> 21:23.040
it's not good enough because you're white.

21:23.040 --> 21:25.040
When you're getting blamed for everything,

21:25.040 --> 21:27.040
just because people,

21:27.040 --> 21:30.040
but they don't understand you, works real hard.

21:30.040 --> 21:32.040
And you're looking at it going like,

21:32.040 --> 21:37.040
I'm trying to...

21:37.040 --> 21:41.040
I'd say you look at those people and you go like,

21:41.040 --> 21:45.040
okay, so you're all off on an ice floe.

21:45.040 --> 21:46.040
You're gone.

21:46.040 --> 21:50.040
You're doing something that's like...

21:50.040 --> 21:53.040
What connection is ever going to happen there?

21:53.040 --> 21:57.040
But then you look at other people that are kind of like...

21:57.040 --> 21:59.040
I'm not going to riff an example,

21:59.040 --> 22:05.040
but I feel like there is like a substratta of people

22:05.040 --> 22:10.040
that are technically responding to the concept of privilege

22:10.040 --> 22:15.040
with a bewildered logical attack back where they're like,

22:15.040 --> 22:18.040
privilege, there's like a substratta of them

22:18.040 --> 22:23.040
that might be worth engaging just a little bit,

22:23.040 --> 22:25.040
that that person is a potential ally

22:25.040 --> 22:28.040
because that person's bewilderment might actually...

22:28.040 --> 22:33.040
It might actually just be based on genuine confusion and logic

22:33.040 --> 22:36.040
and lack of experience.

22:36.040 --> 22:37.040
What did you say?

22:37.040 --> 22:38.040
You want him back.

22:38.040 --> 22:39.040
Oh, yeah.

22:39.040 --> 22:40.040
No, he's great.

22:40.040 --> 22:41.040
It's Black Dave from Community, but...

22:41.040 --> 22:42.040
No, I know.

22:42.040 --> 22:43.040
Darsan.

22:43.040 --> 22:46.040
Anyway, whatever.

22:46.040 --> 22:48.040
Can you try to riff an example?

22:48.040 --> 22:50.040
I'm not totally sure how you're talking about it.

22:50.040 --> 22:51.040
No, I honestly can't.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.040
I really can't.

22:52.040 --> 22:55.040
Because it wasn't like I saw one thing and I was like,

22:55.040 --> 22:56.040
oh, I'm identifying that.

22:56.040 --> 22:58.040
I was more like, I was feeling...

22:58.040 --> 23:00.040
I was looking at this oil and water

23:00.040 --> 23:02.040
or what is there something in between.

23:02.040 --> 23:07.040
When a hashtag like white privilege means starts trending,

23:07.040 --> 23:15.040
you know that it's going to be a bug zapper for beautiful creatures

23:15.040 --> 23:18.040
and also horrible, disgusting ones.

23:18.040 --> 23:20.040
It's just going to attract.

23:20.040 --> 23:26.040
I was just trying to identify...

23:26.040 --> 23:28.040
There was the proper use of it,

23:28.040 --> 23:31.040
and then there was all these different bubbles coming off,

23:31.040 --> 23:33.040
and I was trying to identify them,

23:33.040 --> 23:36.040
and I was wondering, are we going to keep...

23:36.040 --> 23:40.040
I read an essay in, I think, New York Times.

23:40.040 --> 23:42.040
It was a guy who wrote a thing.

23:42.040 --> 23:46.040
I think the headline was a week from hell.

23:46.040 --> 23:52.040
The theme of that just being like...

23:52.040 --> 23:55.040
I was kind of talking about this the previous episode

23:55.040 --> 23:58.040
before it became extra topical,

23:58.040 --> 24:02.040
but the idea of like, is this shit going to hit a point

24:02.040 --> 24:05.040
where we start to...

24:05.040 --> 24:08.040
It actually becomes...

24:08.040 --> 24:11.040
We have to deal with it in a sense that it's like smart people

24:11.040 --> 24:14.040
actually start like actually going like,

24:14.040 --> 24:17.040
okay, we have to learn to deal with dumb people.

24:17.040 --> 24:20.040
It's not...

24:20.040 --> 24:22.040
You don't deal with them by going like,

24:22.040 --> 24:24.040
you're so dumb,

24:24.040 --> 24:28.040
you stick your finger into that wall of Jell-O

24:28.040 --> 24:30.040
that is dumb people,

24:30.040 --> 24:35.040
and your quarter of your identity is now inside dumb people.

24:35.040 --> 24:38.040
You're trying to prove that they're dumb,

24:38.040 --> 24:42.040
and it's like you make yourself dumb by trying to prove that.

24:42.040 --> 24:45.040
Like a genuine elitist...

24:45.040 --> 24:48.040
Their worst nightmare is that there's like a new world order

24:48.040 --> 24:51.040
forming around them because some people think they know better than them.

24:51.040 --> 24:54.040
I just like sometimes maybe split the diff and go like,

24:54.040 --> 24:56.040
what if we were better than them?

24:56.040 --> 25:00.040
The answer is if you genuinely felt that way,

25:00.040 --> 25:04.040
I think you'd find yourself treating them politely.

25:04.040 --> 25:06.040
You might be a redneck.

25:06.040 --> 25:10.040
Because I don't imagine that guys in white lab coats

25:10.040 --> 25:12.040
and they're trying to figure out if deodorant

25:12.040 --> 25:14.040
gives you farts for some corporation

25:14.040 --> 25:16.040
and they have to kill 10,000 rats to do it.

25:16.040 --> 25:18.040
I don't think they'd walk up to each cage,

25:18.040 --> 25:20.040
pull the rat out, and go like,

25:20.040 --> 25:23.040
you piece of shit, you fucker, don't look at me!

25:23.040 --> 25:27.040
I think they go, nice baby, baby, poody, poody,

25:27.040 --> 25:31.040
and they fucking run them over a deli slicer.

25:31.040 --> 25:33.040
Because I think that they...

25:33.040 --> 25:37.040
Because they're like, well, there's no point to engaging this motherfucker.

25:37.040 --> 25:41.040
So if you feel that way about ignorant people,

25:41.040 --> 25:44.040
the evolution might be that we start to go,

25:44.040 --> 25:46.040
wait, they're actually beyond hope.

25:46.040 --> 25:48.040
They don't think for themselves.

25:48.040 --> 25:52.040
No real point in pointing your finger in their face

25:52.040 --> 25:54.040
and spinning at them because they're...

25:54.040 --> 25:57.040
You have intellectual people on both sides of the spectrum

25:57.040 --> 26:01.040
of politics, to the far extremes of politics

26:01.040 --> 26:03.040
that are quite intelligent people

26:03.040 --> 26:06.040
who believe completely antithetical things to each other.

26:06.040 --> 26:08.040
Who's to say which is right?

26:08.040 --> 26:10.040
And also the people that fall in the middle,

26:10.040 --> 26:13.040
these mice that you want to run through a deli slicer,

26:13.040 --> 26:16.040
they're just being pulled in two completely different directions

26:16.040 --> 26:18.040
by a bunch of intellectual weirdos.

26:18.040 --> 26:21.040
Who's right and who's wrong on that side?

26:21.040 --> 26:24.040
I've talked to people that...

26:24.040 --> 26:28.040
You and I both hate politics, I think, by and large,

26:28.040 --> 26:30.040
but I've talked to really smart conservatives,

26:30.040 --> 26:32.040
really, really intellectual people

26:32.040 --> 26:35.040
who believe things that I just can't really dig at all.

26:35.040 --> 26:37.040
But they've thought about it, they've given a lot of thought,

26:37.040 --> 26:40.040
and they're compassionate people and smart people.

26:40.040 --> 26:42.040
I just don't understand.

26:42.040 --> 26:45.040
It's...

26:45.040 --> 26:48.040
Talking to somebody who's just a Trump supporter,

26:48.040 --> 26:51.040
it's like they're smart people that are Trump supporters.

26:51.040 --> 26:53.040
I can't believe that.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.040
There are. They're fucking are.

26:55.040 --> 26:56.040
They really are.

26:56.040 --> 26:58.040
Because they're going to vote for the person

26:58.040 --> 27:00.040
that's going to vote and run against Hillary,

27:00.040 --> 27:02.040
and they've given it a lot of great thought.

27:02.040 --> 27:04.040
I think a lot of people wish they had another candidate,

27:04.040 --> 27:06.040
in both sides.

27:06.040 --> 27:08.040
It's always the lesser of two evil.

27:08.040 --> 27:10.040
Yeah, but that's a horrible thing, isn't it?

27:10.040 --> 27:12.040
It's the worst thing in the world.

27:12.040 --> 27:14.040
I think it's a sad admission that...

27:14.040 --> 27:16.040
But this word smart, though, you're saying...

27:16.040 --> 27:18.040
You're talking about what you're saying...

27:18.040 --> 27:22.040
There's people who are Trump supporters,

27:22.040 --> 27:26.040
who are so smart that they see the benefit

27:26.040 --> 27:28.040
in a long-term weird Illuminati game

27:28.040 --> 27:32.040
of having a crazy, orange Nazi be president for four years.

27:32.040 --> 27:36.040
Or a Zen philosophy where, well, if the pillars crumble,

27:36.040 --> 27:38.040
then there will be more floor space.

27:38.040 --> 27:41.040
I've talked a very smart, thoughtful, compassionate people

27:41.040 --> 27:43.040
who believe things that are weirder than Trump.

27:43.040 --> 27:47.040
People have their own ideologies based on

27:47.040 --> 27:49.040
all sorts of different things.

27:49.040 --> 27:52.040
Yeah, but I support people who say,

27:52.040 --> 27:54.040
I believe the world is still flat.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.040
I believe that we never landed on the moon.

27:56.040 --> 27:58.040
I think Bigfoot's out there, all that stuff.

27:58.040 --> 28:02.040
I wouldn't bully those people and go,

28:02.040 --> 28:04.040
yeah, but because I don't believe

28:04.040 --> 28:07.040
that those beliefs come from dishonesty.

28:07.040 --> 28:09.040
But I don't think that...

28:09.040 --> 28:13.040
If a political candidate is standing in front of a podium

28:13.040 --> 28:15.040
and saying a sentence that you would never say

28:15.040 --> 28:17.040
at a cocktail party ever in any form,

28:17.040 --> 28:19.040
no matter what strata you of cocktail party were at,

28:19.040 --> 28:21.040
or any social environment,

28:21.040 --> 28:24.040
any environment really other than behind a podium,

28:24.040 --> 28:29.040
it's some weird, strange statement about the state of the world

28:29.040 --> 28:31.040
and then everyone applauds and it's all this stuff.

28:31.040 --> 28:34.040
There's a certain level where you're like,

28:34.040 --> 28:36.040
that's not a philosophy.

28:36.040 --> 28:38.040
This is a person in an act of sedition.

28:38.040 --> 28:43.040
This is a person who's trying to take advantage of ignorance

28:43.040 --> 28:46.040
and vulnerability and fear.

28:46.040 --> 28:50.040
They're just rolling into it like a low,

28:50.040 --> 28:54.040
like a liquidy primal viscous infection.

28:54.040 --> 29:00.040
I think both sides are actively trying to seduce ignorance equally.

29:00.040 --> 29:03.040
For sure, I'm definitely not doing no tap dance

29:03.040 --> 29:05.040
for no alternative to Donald Trump.

29:05.040 --> 29:08.040
I'll bore the hell out of you with why...

29:08.040 --> 29:11.040
Yeah, you won't walk away from me knowing who to vote for.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.040
Intellectualism is out the window

29:13.040 --> 29:17.040
because proper intellectual discourse is not even...

29:17.040 --> 29:21.040
Not only is it not allowed, it's just not a thing.

29:21.040 --> 29:24.040
I may have used self-defeating language

29:24.040 --> 29:27.040
when I was talking about smart people.

29:27.040 --> 29:30.040
What if we were to say, for instance, though,

29:30.040 --> 29:32.040
like if I were to...

29:32.040 --> 29:39.040
I mean, don't you think that it's possible

29:39.040 --> 29:48.040
that the smarter you get, the less you want other people to die?

29:48.040 --> 29:50.040
No, but that...

29:50.040 --> 29:53.040
Now you're conjuring an image of a guy that's like a genius,

29:53.040 --> 29:56.040
so he took over the railroads and then he's got a monopoly

29:56.040 --> 29:58.040
over the newspapers and he owns Zagnut

29:58.040 --> 29:59.040
and he's sitting in a fucking roundhouse

29:59.040 --> 30:02.040
dying of weird cancer that you can only get

30:02.040 --> 30:05.040
by using Vietnamese for human chess.

30:05.040 --> 30:09.040
I don't mean like the...

30:09.040 --> 30:12.040
What I mean is, like, forget about what we know

30:12.040 --> 30:14.040
about what happens to smart people

30:14.040 --> 30:16.040
or active people or ambitious people

30:16.040 --> 30:19.040
and just wipe that board clean and think as primates.

30:19.040 --> 30:24.040
Like, don't you think...

30:24.040 --> 30:29.040
I'm gonna pitch this and prove me wrong,

30:29.040 --> 30:36.040
but that any...

30:36.040 --> 30:38.040
Any worldview...

30:38.040 --> 30:39.040
Dance it out, dance it out.

30:39.040 --> 30:41.040
There's probably a huge...

30:41.040 --> 30:44.040
Like, definitely a hugely evolved,

30:44.040 --> 30:46.040
the maximum evolved worldview

30:46.040 --> 30:52.040
would definitely accept the need for horrible things.

30:52.040 --> 30:56.040
Like, the higher, the closer to like fucking crazy

30:56.040 --> 30:58.040
cosmic objectivity you get,

30:58.040 --> 31:02.040
I think the more and more you'll become kind of

31:02.040 --> 31:04.040
what could be called from a distance a nihilist.

31:04.040 --> 31:09.040
So, but don't you think that...

31:09.040 --> 31:11.040
That's accepting.

31:11.040 --> 31:14.040
That's saying like, the cosmos is a bitch.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.040
Like, people live and people die.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.040
It's fucked up.

31:17.040 --> 31:20.040
Like, good things don't happen to good people, etc.

31:20.040 --> 31:26.040
But I'm talking about people who's like cosmologies

31:26.040 --> 31:32.040
are like, necessitate people dying.

31:32.040 --> 31:36.040
Like, don't you think those people are dumber?

31:36.040 --> 31:38.040
I think a lot of them go to Yale.

31:38.040 --> 31:41.040
I think a lot of those people are presidents.

31:41.040 --> 31:44.040
I'm sure a lot of them have 300 IQs,

31:44.040 --> 31:48.040
but don't you think those people are dumber?

31:48.040 --> 31:49.040
Don't you call them dumber?

31:49.040 --> 31:53.040
Well, empathy is like a skill, it's like an attribute.

31:53.040 --> 31:54.040
It's like a muscle.

31:54.040 --> 31:56.040
Some people are better than others,

31:56.040 --> 31:58.040
and that makes them better in that regard.

31:58.040 --> 32:00.040
But empathy is when...

32:00.040 --> 32:04.040
The concept of someone suffering over here,

32:04.040 --> 32:06.040
like, you might pick up on it or not.

32:06.040 --> 32:08.040
The lack of empathy would be...

32:08.040 --> 32:11.040
The worst-case scenario would be someone drowning over here,

32:11.040 --> 32:14.040
and you don't think you have to save them.

32:14.040 --> 32:15.040
That's like...

32:15.040 --> 32:19.040
I'm talking about the people who think that you need to have war.

32:19.040 --> 32:23.040
People who think that people need to be killed, basically.

32:23.040 --> 32:25.040
What about executives at Fillmore's?

32:25.040 --> 32:27.040
Well, I...

32:27.040 --> 32:31.040
That's negligence.

32:31.040 --> 32:34.040
He said, what about executives at a tobacco company or something?

32:34.040 --> 32:36.040
What about Vin Diesel?

32:36.040 --> 32:38.040
That's what we all do to all of each other.

32:38.040 --> 32:40.040
What about Vin Diesel?

32:40.040 --> 32:44.040
I was very lucky to go and do a few USO tours,

32:44.040 --> 32:48.040
like travel around the desert,

32:48.040 --> 32:50.040
perform for troops,

32:50.040 --> 32:52.040
and if you perform for the Big Red One,

32:52.040 --> 32:55.040
these are kids that are poor kids.

32:55.040 --> 32:59.040
They're tip of the spear, first ones in every battle

32:59.040 --> 33:02.040
that we've probably ever fought since the very beginning.

33:02.040 --> 33:05.040
And if you talk to them about killing,

33:05.040 --> 33:06.040
they're all for it.

33:06.040 --> 33:08.040
It's like, let's go get them, blood and guts, they love it.

33:08.040 --> 33:12.040
And then you talk to people that fly billion-dollar systems

33:12.040 --> 33:16.040
like the B2 Bomber or our big spy plans.

33:16.040 --> 33:18.040
These are people that have higher educations,

33:18.040 --> 33:20.040
and they've read poetry,

33:20.040 --> 33:23.040
and they know Shakespeare,

33:23.040 --> 33:26.040
and they've read Voltaire, and they know music,

33:26.040 --> 33:29.040
and to an extent that these other kids probably don't,

33:29.040 --> 33:31.040
they've never been exposed to it.

33:31.040 --> 33:34.040
Their take on death is very different in my conversations with them.

33:34.040 --> 33:36.040
They're not happy about killing people.

33:36.040 --> 33:37.040
They don't want to.

33:37.040 --> 33:39.040
They hope they never have to.

33:39.040 --> 33:41.040
And I think there is an educational divide there,

33:41.040 --> 33:44.040
but you can talk to people that are way smarter

33:44.040 --> 33:46.040
and way more educated than all of those people,

33:46.040 --> 33:48.040
and they will also say that death is a necessity,

33:48.040 --> 33:51.040
or that death is an atrocity no matter what.

33:51.040 --> 33:53.040
Well, I think I'd stop you,

33:53.040 --> 33:56.040
go much more provincial and go like,

33:56.040 --> 33:58.040
yeah, the guys with the bayonets,

33:58.040 --> 34:02.040
they don't let them in the fucking airplanes.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.040
You just said it.

34:05.040 --> 34:09.040
Those guys might have 200 IQs, but I'm saying like...

34:09.040 --> 34:11.040
Those guys that are way richer and smarter

34:11.040 --> 34:13.040
and have bigger and more access to education

34:13.040 --> 34:16.040
than the guys that fly the bombs.

34:16.040 --> 34:19.040
There are these expensive planes around

34:19.040 --> 34:22.040
that would rather kill people than the people flying those planes.

34:22.040 --> 34:24.040
I talked to a bomber, I was in line at a PX,

34:24.040 --> 34:26.040
like the general store at a base,

34:26.040 --> 34:28.040
and I said, what do you do?

34:28.040 --> 34:30.040
And he goes, I'm a bomber.

34:30.040 --> 34:32.040
Physically, actually, what do you do?

34:32.040 --> 34:34.040
And he goes, I'm the guy that bombs.

34:34.040 --> 34:35.040
I hit the button.

34:35.040 --> 34:37.040
I'm looking through the viewfinder,

34:37.040 --> 34:39.040
and it's like, what do you see?

34:39.040 --> 34:41.040
And the viewfinder goes, I see people running.

34:41.040 --> 34:43.040
And he got real bummed out.

34:43.040 --> 34:45.040
He literally had a snickers in his hand,

34:45.040 --> 34:48.040
and I was getting the Gatorade or whatever in the morning.

34:48.040 --> 34:50.040
And I said, who are those people?

34:50.040 --> 34:52.040
And he goes, not our targets.

34:52.040 --> 34:53.040
I go, who are those people?

34:53.040 --> 34:55.040
And he goes, women and children.

34:55.040 --> 34:56.040
I go, where are your targets?

34:56.040 --> 34:58.040
And he goes, they're underground.

34:58.040 --> 34:59.040
I said, do those people that you see

34:59.040 --> 35:01.040
and the viewfinder running have a chance?

35:01.040 --> 35:02.040
And he goes, no, they're dead.

35:02.040 --> 35:04.040
I go, how do you deal with that?

35:04.040 --> 35:07.040
And he goes, first of all, you don't.

35:07.040 --> 35:09.040
And second, the only thing I can take away

35:09.040 --> 35:11.040
is that I'm five miles away when it happens.

35:11.040 --> 35:13.040
I go, how do you know if you got your target?

35:13.040 --> 35:15.040
And he goes, not my department.

35:15.040 --> 35:19.040
And this is a guy who is very, very, very smart

35:19.040 --> 35:21.040
because they don't let you fly that thing.

35:21.040 --> 35:24.040
So your point is that I'm implying

35:24.040 --> 35:28.040
that the smarter you get the less brainwashed

35:28.040 --> 35:30.040
or murderous you get.

35:30.040 --> 35:34.040
And your point is that smart people

35:34.040 --> 35:37.040
can be fucking drones too.

35:37.040 --> 35:41.040
So I guess if we're both right, maybe we need to measure.

35:41.040 --> 35:44.040
I'm like, look, my point is there's...

35:44.040 --> 35:45.040
I think if you have a compassion,

35:45.040 --> 35:46.040
that's all what Spencer said.

35:46.040 --> 35:49.040
I think if you can measure people besides something,

35:49.040 --> 35:51.040
you can pick any variable you want

35:51.040 --> 35:54.040
to sort a list of eight billion people.

35:54.040 --> 35:57.040
And the columns that we create on that list,

35:57.040 --> 35:59.040
there might be some that we haven't invented yet.

35:59.040 --> 36:01.040
There's still data there.

36:01.040 --> 36:05.040
We know that you can sort eight billion people by age,

36:05.040 --> 36:09.040
gender, race, income, nation, city,

36:09.040 --> 36:13.040
people who have experienced violence,

36:13.040 --> 36:15.040
people who haven't.

36:15.040 --> 36:18.040
There's all these columns, but what if there's a column

36:18.040 --> 36:20.040
that we haven't sorted people by yet?

36:20.040 --> 36:24.040
What if no IQ test or anything has been able to detect

36:24.040 --> 36:29.040
a class of people, a strata of people

36:29.040 --> 36:34.040
who continually get frustrated by the world around them

36:34.040 --> 36:36.040
because nobody else seems to get it.

36:36.040 --> 36:40.040
And we're calling to each other through the jello

36:40.040 --> 36:42.040
of the internet and going like,

36:42.040 --> 36:44.040
does anybody else understand what's going on here?

36:44.040 --> 36:46.040
Isn't it easy enough to just understand

36:46.040 --> 36:49.040
that if you hurt somebody, that's worse than if you don't.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.040
And we can have all these conversations

36:51.040 --> 36:53.040
about when that's necessary later.

36:53.040 --> 36:55.040
Those can all be built on that machine language.

36:55.040 --> 36:57.040
Instead of...

36:57.040 --> 36:59.040
We're seeing that right now.

36:59.040 --> 37:00.040
We're seeing these eruptions.

37:00.040 --> 37:04.040
And then we're also seeing these whales of frustration

37:04.040 --> 37:05.040
that are the most distressing

37:05.040 --> 37:09.040
because it's watching intelligent people,

37:09.040 --> 37:12.040
people who are not typically reactive,

37:12.040 --> 37:18.040
reactionary, people who yesterday were able to see

37:18.040 --> 37:24.040
more variance in chaos and have it be part of their life,

37:24.040 --> 37:30.040
being forced into a dumb fucking cereal box contest.

37:30.040 --> 37:33.040
That's the tragedy.

37:33.040 --> 37:35.040
Every time something huge happens,

37:35.040 --> 37:38.040
the pit of your stomach goes like,

37:38.040 --> 37:41.040
these fucking morons, they're not going to handle this well.

37:41.040 --> 37:46.040
And that's not going to make any of us any smarter either.

37:46.040 --> 37:50.040
Man, if we could get a break from all this shit

37:50.040 --> 37:52.040
that makes everybody react all the time,

37:52.040 --> 37:56.040
it's like living in a planet with 7 billion fucking dogs

37:56.040 --> 37:58.040
that don't like fireworks.

37:58.040 --> 38:02.040
And sometimes you see another human across the room,

38:02.040 --> 38:05.040
and it's like, I'm sorry, man.

38:05.040 --> 38:07.040
Was it sympathy or compassion?

38:07.040 --> 38:08.040
What did you say?

38:08.040 --> 38:09.040
Empathy.

38:09.040 --> 38:11.040
I think that's what it is.

38:11.040 --> 38:16.040
But listen, as soon as I hear those words,

38:16.040 --> 38:20.040
those become problematic because Steve Silberman

38:20.040 --> 38:22.040
was up here talking about neurodiversity.

38:22.040 --> 38:26.040
And the truth is, there's a huge spinal cord

38:26.040 --> 38:29.040
going through the history of modern humans

38:29.040 --> 38:32.040
that the spinal cord is this hugely functional,

38:32.040 --> 38:36.040
not typically a screaming empathy,

38:36.040 --> 38:39.040
kind of like sub-community of people

38:39.040 --> 38:43.040
who needed the technology that they created around them

38:43.040 --> 38:47.040
that we all now use to reduce our empathy

38:47.040 --> 38:48.040
and do fucked up shit.

38:48.040 --> 38:53.040
But they created it because they profited from it

38:53.040 --> 38:55.040
in a way that they couldn't on the playground.

38:55.040 --> 38:57.040
You know, having people hit them with sticks

38:57.040 --> 39:00.040
is because they didn't know how to say the right things.

39:00.040 --> 39:02.040
So empathy isn't...

39:02.040 --> 39:05.040
When people don't appear to feel things,

39:05.040 --> 39:08.040
sometimes those people are thinking,

39:08.040 --> 39:10.040
and I guess that's...

39:10.040 --> 39:14.040
It's when you see smart people get drawn into these fucking

39:14.040 --> 39:16.040
mudfights in comment sections,

39:16.040 --> 39:19.040
and you can tell that they're a chemistry teacher or something,

39:19.040 --> 39:22.040
and it's like, why do you have opinions about this shit?

39:22.040 --> 39:24.040
You're smart.

39:24.040 --> 39:27.040
And part of the reason is because those people think that,

39:27.040 --> 39:31.040
as far as interacting with people,

39:31.040 --> 39:35.040
that they're supposed to do it through different channels.

39:35.040 --> 39:38.040
Anyways, I think my point is,

39:38.040 --> 39:42.040
we have to figure out how to tell the morons

39:42.040 --> 39:44.040
from the non-morons,

39:44.040 --> 39:47.040
and we have to actually be racist about detecting morons

39:47.040 --> 39:51.040
and go, that's the only actual dichotomy.

39:51.040 --> 39:54.040
Let's be xenophobic about the morons

39:54.040 --> 39:56.040
to the point where we infantilize them,

39:56.040 --> 39:58.040
as we did for instance.

39:58.040 --> 40:00.040
Isn't that what Joseph Goebbels was saying too?

40:00.040 --> 40:03.040
Yes, it's a strategy you use

40:03.040 --> 40:07.040
when you want to overpower and use a population

40:07.040 --> 40:10.040
instead of informing them and engaging them.

40:10.040 --> 40:12.040
Yes, that's what I'm advocating.

40:12.040 --> 40:16.040
I'm saying fight fire with fire.

40:16.040 --> 40:18.040
I'm saying,

40:18.040 --> 40:21.040
we have to identify our, quote unquote, race.

40:21.040 --> 40:24.040
We have to identify our color,

40:24.040 --> 40:27.040
and it's not going to be a yellow Pokemon.

40:27.040 --> 40:31.040
Bringing up the neuro-tribe thing is very interesting

40:31.040 --> 40:34.040
because people empathize differently,

40:34.040 --> 40:37.040
and some people, their connection with other human beings

40:37.040 --> 40:39.040
is very different than what I think it ought to be,

40:39.040 --> 40:41.040
or what mine is.

40:41.040 --> 40:43.040
Everybody has different amounts of eye contact

40:43.040 --> 40:45.040
they want to make with you.

40:45.040 --> 40:47.040
Everybody sounds different when they're nervous,

40:47.040 --> 40:51.040
everybody reacts to cockiness and insecurity differently.

40:51.040 --> 40:55.040
It's a mishmash of some house they grew up in,

40:55.040 --> 40:58.040
some block they grew up on,

40:58.040 --> 41:01.040
and the huge, giant, number eight scoop

41:01.040 --> 41:04.040
of fucking uncontrollable genetics

41:04.040 --> 41:06.040
that are so much less controllable

41:06.040 --> 41:08.040
than we'd ever love to think.

41:08.040 --> 41:11.040
But just like, everybody's like,

41:11.040 --> 41:14.040
until you get somebody to actually say,

41:14.040 --> 41:17.040
I don't like you, don't assume they don't like you,

41:17.040 --> 41:19.040
we need to move forward into a culture

41:19.040 --> 41:21.040
where there's like checks and balances there,

41:21.040 --> 41:23.040
where you can go like, oh man,

41:23.040 --> 41:25.040
there's so much shit happening,

41:25.040 --> 41:27.040
where we project onto people,

41:27.040 --> 41:29.040
we go like, oh, these fucking assholes.

41:29.040 --> 41:31.040
When you read one of these comments

41:31.040 --> 41:33.040
under one of these things,

41:33.040 --> 41:36.040
it's like you stick like a scalpel

41:36.040 --> 41:38.040
into that fucking owl pellet

41:38.040 --> 41:41.040
and pry it apart and breathe any air into it,

41:41.040 --> 41:44.040
or put it in liquid, it turns into a fucking

41:44.040 --> 41:47.040
crazy, weird triple squirrel.

41:47.040 --> 41:50.040
It's like there's a history of what this owl ate,

41:50.040 --> 41:53.040
it's like a fucking like, what the fuck is this?

41:53.040 --> 41:57.040
What expertise are you bringing to bear here?

41:57.040 --> 42:00.040
How is anybody not being that honest about

42:00.040 --> 42:03.040
what they're actually feeling and what they're fearing?

42:03.040 --> 42:06.040
They're so close to just saying they're afraid,

42:06.040 --> 42:09.040
but it comes out, it completely inverted.

42:09.040 --> 42:12.040
The way that we say I'm afraid of you

42:12.040 --> 42:15.040
is I am not afraid of you,

42:15.040 --> 42:18.040
and you would like me to be afraid of you,

42:18.040 --> 42:21.040
but I can beat you up, so fuck you.

42:21.040 --> 42:24.040
We say everything but I'm afraid of you,

42:24.040 --> 42:27.040
which is just like, we can start to a conversation.

42:27.040 --> 42:29.040
If you could isolate all these morons,

42:29.040 --> 42:31.040
what would you say to them and what would you do with them?

42:31.040 --> 42:33.040
I don't know, I'd fucking, Jeff,

42:33.040 --> 42:35.040
right now I would walk out,

42:35.040 --> 42:38.040
close the freezer door and flip a fucking jigsaw switch

42:38.040 --> 42:41.040
that's cued a video of me going,

42:41.040 --> 42:45.040
85% of America, you don't know me,

42:45.040 --> 42:47.040
but I certainly know you.

42:47.040 --> 42:51.040
For years you have fucking thought things,

42:51.040 --> 42:53.040
typed things.

42:53.040 --> 42:55.040
Every time you saw a blinking cursor,

42:55.040 --> 42:58.040
you thought it meant you had something to say.

42:58.040 --> 43:00.040
There's a jar of acid in one corner,

43:00.040 --> 43:02.040
there's a fucking bomb in the other,

43:02.040 --> 43:04.040
you have no choice, you're dead, bye.

43:04.040 --> 43:08.040
And then I would like, that's the mood I'm in

43:08.040 --> 43:11.040
when shit gets to the point when it redlines.

43:11.040 --> 43:14.040
I go super villainous, I go like,

43:14.040 --> 43:16.040
let's fucking kill everybody.

43:16.040 --> 43:18.040
That's not a good response.

43:18.040 --> 43:20.040
As a creator and as an artist,

43:20.040 --> 43:22.040
let's say you're a painter,

43:22.040 --> 43:26.040
humans have learned to deal with suffering through,

43:26.040 --> 43:28.040
the one thing I think that we've created

43:28.040 --> 43:31.040
that the other animals haven't is art,

43:31.040 --> 43:34.040
with how fucked up things are.

43:34.040 --> 43:38.040
What can you do as an artist to assuage that?

43:38.040 --> 43:39.040
Anything?

43:39.040 --> 43:41.040
Harmon Quest on CISO.

43:45.040 --> 43:48.040
Coming to you this Thursday, all episodes.

43:48.040 --> 43:51.040
July 14th at the, what's it called, theater?

43:51.040 --> 43:53.040
Oh, they think that's July 12th, actually.

43:53.040 --> 43:55.040
Yeah, come to the premiere.

43:55.040 --> 43:56.040
It's at Ticketmaster.

43:56.040 --> 43:59.040
No, maybe it's not, it's not actually.

43:59.040 --> 44:02.040
It's somewhere on the internet.

44:02.040 --> 44:04.040
No, it's on the internet.

44:04.040 --> 44:08.040
We're all going to meet up on the internet.

44:08.040 --> 44:11.040
But most importantly of all,

44:11.040 --> 44:13.040
San Diego Comic Con show.

44:13.040 --> 44:15.040
That's the Balboa Theater.

44:15.040 --> 44:17.040
That's on Ticketmaster, there you go.

44:17.040 --> 44:19.040
What night is that, Steve?

44:19.040 --> 44:20.040
22nd.

44:20.040 --> 44:22.040
July 22nd at the Balboa Theater.

44:22.040 --> 44:25.040
Is it taping and streaming, Steve, the Comic Con show?

44:25.040 --> 44:27.040
Is it taping and streaming?

44:27.040 --> 44:29.040
Don't we have some of One Direction?

44:29.040 --> 44:30.040
Who's coming?

44:30.040 --> 44:31.040
We have huge guests.

44:31.040 --> 44:33.040
It's not One Direction, it's Zane.

44:33.040 --> 44:34.040
We just have Zane?

44:34.040 --> 44:35.040
Yeah.

44:35.040 --> 44:36.040
Oh, we're fucked.

44:36.040 --> 44:40.040
But I think he's going to be doing a double appearance with Adam Levine.

44:40.040 --> 44:41.040
Is that a person?

44:41.040 --> 44:42.040
Levine.

44:42.040 --> 44:43.040
Yeah, I call him Levine.

44:43.040 --> 44:45.040
We go way back.

44:45.040 --> 44:49.040
Before he tried to pronounce it all cool and stuff.

44:49.040 --> 44:52.040
He was just Levine.

44:52.040 --> 44:57.040
Yeah.

44:57.040 --> 45:02.040
I was going to say, I'll write as people are seating,

45:02.040 --> 45:05.040
as soon as they open the house, I'll have a laptop open.

45:05.040 --> 45:09.040
I don't know about this.

45:09.040 --> 45:11.040
Sorry, Eugene.

45:11.040 --> 45:13.040
And I'll write.

45:13.040 --> 45:15.040
That's for a plain person.

45:15.040 --> 45:17.040
It's not going to draw people to the internet.

45:17.040 --> 45:20.040
You're going to write things that were visibly up on the screen,

45:20.040 --> 45:23.040
and you're writing the community movie live.

45:23.040 --> 45:25.040
Well, I was trying to think of something I could write

45:25.040 --> 45:27.040
so people could watch me write,

45:27.040 --> 45:29.040
but it's not going to lure them in because they're like,

45:29.040 --> 45:31.040
well, I could certainly make anything interesting happen.

45:31.040 --> 45:32.040
Don't watch that on YouTube.

45:32.040 --> 45:35.040
What if you write the next Jaws?

45:35.040 --> 45:38.040
But it doesn't matter because you have to think of a thing

45:38.040 --> 45:41.040
that they can only see if they come there.

45:41.040 --> 45:48.040
Or that's why a human guest would be the best.

45:48.040 --> 45:50.040
What were we going to get the guy from Hamilton?

45:50.040 --> 45:51.040
What happened to him?

45:51.040 --> 45:53.040
Oh, no, he's coming.

45:53.040 --> 45:54.040
Yeah.

45:54.040 --> 45:55.040
He's going to be at the show?

45:55.040 --> 45:58.040
Yeah, Adam Levine dropped out.

45:58.040 --> 46:00.040
So we got Lynn.

46:00.040 --> 46:02.040
It'll be great.

46:02.040 --> 46:06.040
We also got Bulbasaur.

46:06.040 --> 46:09.040
He'll be making an appearance.

46:09.040 --> 46:11.040
Yeah, yeah.

46:11.040 --> 46:14.040
We have all the juggalos.

46:14.040 --> 46:16.040
They're all coming.

46:16.040 --> 46:18.040
Here's my new segment.

46:18.040 --> 46:21.040
Now that the season's over, Game of Thrones questions.

46:21.040 --> 46:23.040
Game of Thrones questions.

46:23.040 --> 46:28.040
Now we have the time, I think.

46:28.040 --> 46:30.040
Sorry.

46:30.040 --> 46:33.040
Game of Thrones questions.

46:33.040 --> 46:37.040
So remember when Arya Stark, spoilers.

46:37.040 --> 46:39.040
Oh, boy.

46:39.040 --> 46:45.040
She was like in the end, the red wedding coordinator.

46:45.040 --> 46:49.040
The guy who loved the red wedding is like, I love red weddings.

46:49.040 --> 46:51.040
You don't have to.

46:51.040 --> 46:53.040
I mean, I'm not going to remember his name.

46:53.040 --> 46:55.040
I was more entertained by my own.

46:55.040 --> 46:59.040
You have to say that wedding coordinator out of a job.

46:59.040 --> 47:00.040
No, I don't know.

47:00.040 --> 47:03.040
I think he said to her, I'm seeing a red wedding.

47:03.040 --> 47:05.040
He was like, I love red wings.

47:05.040 --> 47:10.040
So they teed up the Hooters waitress, this foxy.

47:10.040 --> 47:19.040
I put her in her early 20s, kind of lady who brings things to Walter Frey.

47:19.040 --> 47:21.040
He's the Lord of River Run.

47:21.040 --> 47:23.040
And she's bringing him pie.

47:23.040 --> 47:26.040
So there's a scene where he goes, I had more milkshakes.

47:26.040 --> 47:29.040
And she comes up and she's like, here's your Game of Thrones milkshakes.

47:29.040 --> 47:31.040
And she's like cleavage.

47:31.040 --> 47:39.040
And she's a grown woman, but she's certainly not, you know, she's age inappropriate for him.

47:39.040 --> 47:42.040
And he's like, I love milkshakes.

47:42.040 --> 47:45.040
And so you see her and you go like, huh, that was weird.

47:45.040 --> 47:49.040
And then at the end she comes back and goes like, would you like another milkshake?

47:49.040 --> 47:53.040
And he's like, as long as it reminds me of the red wedding, I love red weddings.

47:53.040 --> 47:58.040
And then that Hooters waitress inexplicably like stabs him.

47:58.040 --> 48:00.040
And he's like, what are you doing?

48:00.040 --> 48:02.040
I didn't ask to be stabbed.

48:02.040 --> 48:05.040
And then she pulls off and it's Arya Stark.

48:05.040 --> 48:06.040
And you're like, OK.

48:06.040 --> 48:09.040
So then the episode's over and I'm going, OK.

48:09.040 --> 48:18.040
So I asked a bunch of questions that creep people out about she's 14 and she's disguised as a 19-year-old.

48:18.040 --> 48:21.040
But I get past that stuff, eventually.

48:21.040 --> 48:33.040
And I get to the point where I'm asking, have we seen a, so let's say Arya Stark were a male character that had gone through...

48:33.040 --> 48:36.040
Well, she's being one of the many-faced people she's putting on a disguise.

48:36.040 --> 48:38.040
But then she disguises herself.

48:38.040 --> 48:44.040
Have we seen a, has there been a cross-gender, many-faced disguise in Game of Thrones?

48:44.040 --> 48:46.040
I think Jackon's done some girls.

48:46.040 --> 48:47.040
Say what?

48:47.040 --> 48:48.040
Jackon.

48:48.040 --> 48:49.040
Jackon.

48:49.040 --> 48:50.040
I think he did a girl.

48:50.040 --> 48:51.040
Jackon did a girl?

48:51.040 --> 48:52.040
Or the girl did him, maybe.

48:52.040 --> 48:53.040
All right.

48:53.040 --> 48:55.040
Jackon did a girl?

48:55.040 --> 48:57.040
Yeah, no, there's the penis.

48:57.040 --> 48:58.040
It's the penis.

48:58.040 --> 49:00.040
Yeah, there's a penis.

49:00.040 --> 49:02.040
That was your question, right?

49:02.040 --> 49:05.040
Like, if a girl puts on a guy mask, there'll be a penis.

49:05.040 --> 49:06.040
Here's my question.

49:06.040 --> 49:07.040
I'm going all the way forward to this.

49:07.040 --> 49:13.040
So say you could disguise, say you were a kid, a boy kid, you go through the training.

49:13.040 --> 49:14.040
A grown man penis.

49:14.040 --> 49:15.040
What?

49:15.040 --> 49:16.040
No.

49:16.040 --> 49:17.040
No.

49:17.040 --> 49:18.040
I'll stop guessing.

49:18.040 --> 49:20.040
No, I'm walking you through this.

49:20.040 --> 49:21.040
Let me walk you through it.

49:21.040 --> 49:22.040
Okay.

49:22.040 --> 49:23.040
You're a boy.

49:23.040 --> 49:24.040
You're a young Spencer.

49:24.040 --> 49:25.040
Right.

49:25.040 --> 49:27.040
You go to the house with the double doors and the black and the white.

49:27.040 --> 49:28.040
Yeah, yeah.

49:28.040 --> 49:33.040
And it's like, oh, stop using pronouns.

49:33.040 --> 49:34.040
Don't always speak in the present tense.

49:34.040 --> 49:36.040
He gives you the whole orientation.

49:36.040 --> 49:37.040
Right.

49:37.040 --> 49:41.040
Also, we're going to take your eyes away and hit you with a stick for a while.

49:41.040 --> 49:42.040
Only if you use a pronoun.

49:42.040 --> 49:44.040
You got to fuck up first.

49:44.040 --> 49:45.040
Yeah.

49:45.040 --> 49:47.040
So you go through the whole training.

49:47.040 --> 49:52.040
And along the way, you learn, you find a whole row chamber of faces and you find out

49:52.040 --> 49:55.040
you can take them each and you can slap them on and go be that person.

49:55.040 --> 49:58.040
And then you're like, half of them are women.

49:58.040 --> 49:59.040
51%.

49:59.040 --> 50:00.040
Maybe.

50:00.040 --> 50:09.040
And so at one point you go, he says, he comes to you and he says, a boy who has no name

50:09.040 --> 50:14.040
needs to go over to Seattle and hang out.

50:14.040 --> 50:23.040
And a certain man who started a certain startup thinks the stock options would be appropriate

50:23.040 --> 50:26.040
but maybe the people need the stock to drop down.

50:26.040 --> 50:31.040
I'm combining Game of Thrones with Grand Theft Auto 5.

50:31.040 --> 50:35.040
So you disguise yourself as a woman.

50:35.040 --> 50:43.040
So you go there and you're watching him and you're in disguise for a while.

50:43.040 --> 50:49.040
So let's say during that disguise, period, you fall in love with him.

50:49.040 --> 50:52.040
And you make love with him.

50:52.040 --> 50:54.040
So go even beyond.

50:54.040 --> 50:59.040
So I got my friends to tell me, yes, there'd be a vagina there.

50:59.040 --> 51:00.040
It's part of the disguise.

51:00.040 --> 51:01.040
It's a mystical disguise.

51:01.040 --> 51:02.040
You're assuming that identity.

51:02.040 --> 51:03.040
Oh yeah.

51:03.040 --> 51:05.040
So his wiener goes into your vagina.

51:05.040 --> 51:06.040
Yeah.

51:06.040 --> 51:09.040
He ejaculates from joy.

51:09.040 --> 51:10.040
Of course.

51:10.040 --> 51:13.040
As I'm told, that's the only way.

51:13.040 --> 51:16.040
What else?

51:16.040 --> 51:21.040
So this illusion is not going to stop there and turn into something else.

51:21.040 --> 51:22.040
You've got ovaries.

51:22.040 --> 51:23.040
You've got eggs.

51:23.040 --> 51:25.040
Let's say you get pregnant.

51:25.040 --> 51:27.040
Your disguise gets pregnant.

51:27.040 --> 51:28.040
Yeah.

51:28.040 --> 51:30.040
How could it not be possible?

51:30.040 --> 51:32.040
Can that happen to Spencer as a mimic?

51:32.040 --> 51:35.040
Would the mimic character have ovaries?

51:35.040 --> 51:36.040
Does it go that far?

51:36.040 --> 51:40.040
Let me tell you something about illusionary magic.

51:40.040 --> 51:42.040
It breaks down into a lot of things.

51:42.040 --> 51:45.040
There's glamours, I think, and figments.

51:45.040 --> 51:48.040
And then there's lesser phantasms and shadows.

51:48.040 --> 51:50.040
You see, there's a whole gamut.

51:50.040 --> 51:56.040
But I assume that the masks probably just work on this lowest level where it's just your basic senses.

51:56.040 --> 51:59.040
But nothing deeper than that.

51:59.040 --> 52:04.040
So you might confuse yourself for grabbing like a hot titty or whatever.

52:04.040 --> 52:07.040
But it wouldn't actually be there.

52:07.040 --> 52:11.040
It would just be magically your senses were feeling it.

52:11.040 --> 52:28.040
You're saying if you trained this way and you're going to assassinate me,

52:28.040 --> 52:34.040
you're going to assassinate someone in Los Angeles and the best way to do it is to love me.

52:34.040 --> 52:36.040
So you meet me.

52:36.040 --> 52:41.040
And then we hit it off and you know that you're on the right track.

52:41.040 --> 52:44.040
You're doing your mission right by loving me.

52:44.040 --> 52:46.040
So I make love to you.

52:46.040 --> 52:58.040
And you're saying the illusionary magic means that when I take my tiny, itty-bitty little rage-filled purple disgusting penis

52:58.040 --> 53:08.040
and I move it around hoping for some fucking relief that Captain Kangaroo couldn't give me.

53:08.040 --> 53:19.040
I finally, when I insert it, what's happening is that something's happening and it's based on illusion.

53:19.040 --> 53:23.040
And what you're saying is that definitely you don't have ovaries.

53:23.040 --> 53:24.040
I don't think so.

53:24.040 --> 53:30.040
Because it's at the point of, you're saying if I grabbed where your breast would be,

53:30.040 --> 53:38.040
it's like nano armor where it'd be like, oh, he expects to feel a breast there so like energy goes there.

53:38.040 --> 53:40.040
Yeah, that's what I assumed.

53:40.040 --> 53:46.040
I assumed it's focused on the face is like that channels the magic, but it's illusionary magic.

53:46.040 --> 53:51.040
I don't think there's a physical, like magically you're not physically morphing in any way.

53:51.040 --> 54:00.040
So if you fell in love with someone who was disguising themselves with illusion magic as the opposite gender,

54:00.040 --> 54:11.040
and you imagined yourself like consummating a reproductive engagement with them,

54:11.040 --> 54:22.040
all that, yeah, of course it wouldn't, you're saying something's happening down there that's a cloud of thought around your penis.

54:22.040 --> 54:27.040
It's like VR, you know, like you don't know.

54:27.040 --> 54:29.040
It just seems like you're there.

54:29.040 --> 54:36.040
I wanted to go to the place that you have to have ovaries if you were, the disguise is like thorough,

54:36.040 --> 54:41.040
and then a baby could be conceived, but while the disguise was happening,

54:41.040 --> 54:49.040
and then my big question was the baby's born, it's half you, but half who.

54:49.040 --> 54:51.040
It would be the mask in that case.

54:51.040 --> 54:52.040
Right.

54:52.040 --> 54:54.040
It would have to be because it's the mask.

54:54.040 --> 55:00.040
I think if your job is to be like, if you're going to be one of the many faced weirdos that you're going to put on a face and go kill somebody,

55:00.040 --> 55:04.040
that you're not doing your job right if you're going home and fucking people.

55:04.040 --> 55:08.040
I think your job is to go kill somebody every week.

55:08.040 --> 55:12.040
You're supposed to go kill somebody and put that face back up on the shelf by sundown?

55:12.040 --> 55:13.040
Yeah.

55:13.040 --> 55:14.040
Or you lose your eyes.

55:14.040 --> 55:17.040
What is the fantasy for something that you're wishing?

55:17.040 --> 55:23.040
It seems like you have some sort of like pie in the sky version of this where it wants to be pregnant.

55:23.040 --> 55:28.040
No, I wanted to try to chase magic to the threshold of genetics.

55:28.040 --> 55:35.040
I was curious because that's a case of like, you're saying magic is like, oh, I look like so-and-so, and it's just like the illusion.

55:35.040 --> 55:36.040
I don't know.

55:36.040 --> 55:37.040
Just asking questions, man.

55:37.040 --> 55:40.040
I want to know about what are the rules on those dragons.

55:40.040 --> 55:45.040
So I mean, you can't control them and they deposit you in the wilderness, then you knock over some fires,

55:45.040 --> 55:48.040
and all of a sudden you're fucking queen dragons all of a sudden?

55:48.040 --> 55:49.040
How does that work?

55:49.040 --> 55:53.040
You go off screen for a while, and then all of a sudden you now control dragons perfectly?

55:53.040 --> 55:54.040
What the shit is that?

55:54.040 --> 55:55.040
Yeah.

55:55.040 --> 55:59.040
And you can fly them over a boat, and then you say, like, ducador.

55:59.040 --> 56:01.040
And there you go, like, oh, ducador.

56:01.040 --> 56:02.040
I like to-

56:02.040 --> 56:03.040
Wait a minute.

56:03.040 --> 56:05.040
You need words to do shit?

56:05.040 --> 56:07.040
You've been fucking autonomous this whole-

56:07.040 --> 56:09.040
Also, they needed boats.

56:09.040 --> 56:12.040
The first thing the dragons did, they burned down a bunch of boats.

56:12.040 --> 56:18.040
They made great pains to burn down only one boat at all, which was really weird visually.

56:18.040 --> 56:21.040
It was like three dragons attacking one boat.

56:21.040 --> 56:25.040
It was very slow work being done, warfare, you know, lives.

56:25.040 --> 56:26.040
I didn't note that, too.

56:26.040 --> 56:29.040
I was like, oh, because before that, I was experiencing this joy.

56:29.040 --> 56:33.040
I was going, oh, all this talk of dragons, and dragons are so goddamn important, all this stuff,

56:33.040 --> 56:35.040
and it's like, wow, they're really showing you.

56:35.040 --> 56:37.040
Yes, of course dragons are important.

56:37.040 --> 56:42.040
They are, like, the might of the military is huge part of it.

56:42.040 --> 56:45.040
It's like wooden boats that float up to the thing.

56:45.040 --> 56:49.040
And I thought I was going to see a scene where a dragon flew over 90 boats-

56:49.040 --> 56:50.040
Exactly.

56:50.040 --> 56:52.040
And lit them all up.

56:52.040 --> 56:54.040
Right, that would have been really cool looking.

56:54.040 --> 56:56.040
But they might have made-

56:56.040 --> 56:59.040
No, I get that, and that's why they made it look stupid.

56:59.040 --> 57:00.040
It was just dumb.

57:00.040 --> 57:02.040
I don't like it.

57:02.040 --> 57:05.040
What, you raised your hand?

57:05.040 --> 57:06.040
I did.

57:06.040 --> 57:08.040
He's been raising his hand for an hour today.

57:08.040 --> 57:10.040
No, he's been shouting shit out.

57:10.040 --> 57:13.040
That's why when he raises his hand, I'm like, are we going to die?

57:13.040 --> 57:17.040
I have a question about the illusionary magic.

57:17.040 --> 57:20.040
So do I, and we finished that segment.

57:20.040 --> 57:22.040
Okay, number one.

57:22.040 --> 57:24.040
What about Philip Morris?

57:24.040 --> 57:25.040
What's up?

57:25.040 --> 57:27.040
Are they using illusionary magic?

57:27.040 --> 57:28.040
Wait, say what?

57:28.040 --> 57:29.040
I didn't hear it.

57:29.040 --> 57:30.040
What about Philip Morris?

57:30.040 --> 57:31.040
It was a callback.

57:31.040 --> 57:32.040
It was fine.

57:32.040 --> 57:33.040
I want to answer-

57:33.040 --> 57:35.040
No one ever asks me questions about magic.

57:35.040 --> 57:36.040
I love this.

57:36.040 --> 57:38.040
Well, I have a question for you about magic.

57:38.040 --> 57:39.040
Yeah, no, I heard it.

57:39.040 --> 57:44.040
Your theory about the illusions works in an additive way, right?

57:44.040 --> 57:50.040
So if you have the illusion of a beautiful titty, and Dan goes to touch it,

57:50.040 --> 57:54.040
the illusion makes him think he's touching a beautiful titty that isn't there.

57:54.040 --> 58:00.040
However, if Dan goes to fuck your illusionary vagina,

58:00.040 --> 58:04.040
it doesn't really work in a subtractive way.

58:04.040 --> 58:10.040
If there's a dick there, and Dan goes to fuck a vagina,

58:10.040 --> 58:14.040
your theory doesn't really remove the dick.

58:14.040 --> 58:18.040
Well, what's actually happened is you're just working your elbow down there,

58:18.040 --> 58:21.040
and they're just going out the elbow.

58:21.040 --> 58:22.040
That's exactly-

58:22.040 --> 58:25.040
That was part of what I was thinking,

58:25.040 --> 58:28.040
but when you put it in the words that I looked down that road,

58:28.040 --> 58:30.040
and I was like, wait, is this like in 1986,

58:30.040 --> 58:31.040
it's like a link-letter movie,

58:31.040 --> 58:34.040
like I'm asking these questions about fucking and pussies,

58:34.040 --> 58:36.040
and I backed away from it,

58:36.040 --> 58:38.040
but thank you for walking into that minefield

58:38.040 --> 58:41.040
and just confirming that it's just like...

58:41.040 --> 58:43.040
Just imagine...

58:43.040 --> 58:44.040
Because it's like, what?

58:44.040 --> 58:48.040
Wait, if it's a visible pussy, how do you know what your dick's in a pussy?

58:48.040 --> 58:50.040
Like, I didn't want to...

58:50.040 --> 58:57.040
I'm glad you're laughing because I ran that simulation.

58:57.040 --> 58:59.040
I was like, I have a 43, it's a new world,

58:59.040 --> 59:03.040
I got to ask these questions, and then you did,

59:03.040 --> 59:06.040
and like, we're both alive.

59:06.040 --> 59:08.040
Which is what the...

59:08.040 --> 59:10.040
Well, we've all had our fun tonight,

59:10.040 --> 59:13.040
but just imagine a hallucination, right?

59:13.040 --> 59:16.040
You see something, it's not there.

59:16.040 --> 59:19.040
Now imagine that happening, but with your sense of touch.

59:19.040 --> 59:20.040
That's all that's happening.

59:20.040 --> 59:23.040
It's just a hallucination totally not happening,

59:23.040 --> 59:26.040
but somehow your mind just interprets it as happening.

59:26.040 --> 59:27.040
That's all it is.

59:27.040 --> 59:28.040
It's magic.

59:28.040 --> 59:32.040
You feel the pussy surround your penis.

59:32.040 --> 59:37.040
It is wet and tight as you'd imagine.

59:37.040 --> 59:41.040
It's warm as a microwaved cantaloupe.

59:46.040 --> 59:50.040
But deep within your will, something feels amiss.

59:53.040 --> 59:56.040
You pass your will-save.

59:56.040 --> 01:00:01.040
It's a dude, but that's fine.

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:05.040
If you're fine with that...

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:08.040
I ask her, you're like, what's going on?

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:10.040
What's the deal?

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.040
They're right here.

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.040
Stab in the neck.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.040
There you go.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.040
I don't think it would go that far.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:22.040
What's the will-save on imaginary pussy?

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.040
17s.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.040
So he rolled what?

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.040
He rolled a 17 or higher?

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.040
Oh yeah, yeah, he's rolling hard.

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.040
The point was about genetics.

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:37.040
It's about genetics, but I think I have all my answers.

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.040
Illusion magic can make you in all the ways

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.040
that you would mythically think you could fool somebody.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.040
You can fool somebody.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:48.040
That includes being in bed with them, conjugating with them.

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:51.040
None of it, but it's all an illusion.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.040
Unless it's not.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.040
It could be polymorph magic.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.040
I just don't think it is.

01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:00.040
In which case it's actually manipulating the matter.

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:03.040
Yeah, but usually there are, I think,

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:09.040
in a lot of old Greek, not Greek, god damn it,

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.040
old knights and legends and stuff.

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:14.040
There's all these body-switching potions,

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.040
and then you actually would get pregnant with the kids,

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.040
and that was probably polymorph magic.

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.040
What is the...

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:25.040
You can be a halfling magician.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.040
Oh boy, can you ever.

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:29.040
Okay, so that's a reduced size there.

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:31.040
There's an average height.

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.040
So if that person's an illusionist,

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:36.040
and they cast an illusion spell that's supposed to disguise them as somebody,

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:38.040
there's limitations based on height?

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:41.040
Yeah, the lower-level magic spells,

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.040
you can only go by about an eighth of your total height,

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:46.040
so the shorter you are, you can only get a little bit taller.

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.040
Those things are all expressed as modifiers.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:53.040
Yeah, modifiers, hit points, saving throws.

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:56.040
Yeah, hey, who made that weird groan?

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:59.040
I'm gonna be your heartburn.

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:01.040
I miss D&D, you guys.

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.040
I miss playing the D&D.

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:07.040
I enjoyed our shadow-run thing for a little while,

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:10.040
but I think we didn't quite really sink our teeth into that.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.040
I'll tell you what, maybe if it does,

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:14.040
this place is crawling with Nitteran.

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.040
So the headlines were...

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.040
I did want to get...

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:20.040
So there was the headline about how there's a robbery gang.

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.040
They set up like a maybe a poke-lure or something,

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:26.040
so you show up or they were preying on people.

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:29.040
The other one, of course, was the...

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:32.040
I think a young lady who was searching for a poke-mind

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:35.040
into a riverbed and found a dead body.

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:38.040
And a dude fell off a bridge.

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:40.040
Somebody got stabbed in Chicago?

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.040
By a cipher.

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:47.040
Yeah, this is my element.

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.040
Wait, you're overwhelming grandpa.

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.040
I mean, let's hear...

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:53.040
Oh, the guy who plays like a really bad airshake.

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.040
Wait, come up and grab a mic so we can hear you.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.040
Get up and grab a mic so we can hear you.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.040
Just stand in the mic.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.040
Because this guy knew...

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.040
What are you, theater trained?

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.040
What are you...

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:04.040
Like, here's my thoughts.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.040
Like, here we go.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.040
This guy up here is playing Pippin

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.040
in the Torrance Community Center.

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.040
What's your name?

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.040
Scott Ian from Anthrax.

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.040
Actually, I like that. I like Anthrax.

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.040
If I thought that would be insulting, I wouldn't have said it.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:22.040
No, but you look a little bit like Scott Ian.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:23.040
I like that.

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:24.040
My name is Jacob.

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.040
The story I was saying was...

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.040
I read this...

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.040
God, I was like two days ago when this story came out.

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:31.040
Some kid in Chicago, I think he was like a seven-year-old or something.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.040
He was playing Pokemon Go, you know, on the app.

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:35.040
He didn't fucking look where he was going.

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:37.040
One is a really bad area of town.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.040
He gets...

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.040
Like, he was passing by this convenience store or something.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.040
Somebody actually stabs him and it's Robson.

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.040
I think he survived, but...

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:45.040
Team Robson?

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:47.040
Yeah.

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:49.040
Oh, man.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:51.040
Fucking blues.

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.040
Fucking blues.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.040
This is not for grandpa.

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.040
Oh, yeah.

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:59.040
I'll tell you what, if a blue walks in right now, I'll stab him.

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.040
I'll stab him.

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.040
Oh, God.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.040
No, but this really happened.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.040
I'm terrified right now.

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:09.040
He was stabbed by people unrelated to Pokemon Go

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:10.040
or people that were part of the game?

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:12.040
No, it was unrelated. It was a robbery.

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.040
He just didn't realize that he weren't from a bad area.

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:16.040
He walked into a bad part of town.

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.040
Yes.

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:20.040
And he got stabbed for being in the bad part of town.

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:21.040
Yeah.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.040
Pretty much, yes.

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:26.040
So Pokemon Go, because it's the first game to require leaving your house,

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:29.040
is being fused with all the reasons to not leave your house.

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.040
Pretty much, yes.

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.040
There's Pokemon Go stories.

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:37.040
Pokemon Go user meets a dude that we strike years of our life.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.040
Life.

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.040
I don't know what that was.

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.040
I don't know what that was.

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:47.040
I don't know what that was.

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:53.040
I downloaded the app with the game with Dan and Cody a few hours ago.

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:57.040
Went home, took a shower, got dressed, turned my phone on.

01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.040
The app is still open.

01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:03.040
There was Pokemon lurking about my crib, so I threw some Pokeballs at him

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:06.040
and I took a while to figure out how that shit works.

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:08.040
Because it's not intuitive.

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:09.040
I'll tell you that much.

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:12.040
It seems like Ski Ball, but mostly it's a fucking shot in the dark.

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.040
It is.

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.040
And then, so I start looking around.

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:17.040
Also, they don't let you wear a suit and tie.

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:20.040
You gotta have a yellow backpack on and a visor.

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:21.040
Like I'm a golfer.

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.040
Jeff is so affected by this.

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:23.040
I don't like this shit.

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:26.040
Jerry, did you're making Jeff play a game where he has to choose between

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.040
three kinds of visor?

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.040
I don't like...

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:30.040
It's in the wild to die, basically.

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:35.040
I'm not like one of those freemium players where like, oh, 1999 to get a big energy pack

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.040
to do this thing.

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.040
Fuck that.

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.040
I'll play it for free.

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:40.040
I'll spend my money on fun things.

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:46.040
But I'll tell you right now, if Pokemon Go had a $5 thing that let me put a suit on,

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.040
I'll fucking do it.

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:50.040
So anyway, I look around.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:53.040
What the little Pokemons might be around town.

01:05:53.040 --> 01:06:01.040
One's Marshall High School and one is the Immaculate Heart Convent right up my street.

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:03.040
Katy Perry just bought that shit.

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:06.040
So maybe I go up there and my Pokemon is Katy Perry.

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:09.040
But it's making me walk around my neighborhood.

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:15.040
But how do I know that Marc Maron's not waiting there to kill me so we can kill Harmontown

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.040
guys?

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:19.040
If you guys don't think fucking Maron's going to use this as a way to try to get his edge

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.040
back over us.

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:22.040
Like, luring.

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.040
There's a...

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:25.040
Do you think we have an edge on Marc Maron right now?

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:27.040
No, it was a bit.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.040
Teens use Pokemon Go apps.

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:34.040
Okay, I talked about armed robbery in Missouri.

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:36.040
Armed robbery in Missouri happened?

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.040
What about the guy fell off a bridge?

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.040
Died?

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.040
Wait, are we talking about just current events or...

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.040
No, no, no.

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.040
These are Pokemon related.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.040
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.040
Okay, well...

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:48.040
Did you guys hear that Donald Trump is running for president?

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.040
I want to...

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.040
Really?

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.040
Holy shit.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:55.040
Yeah, he followed a Pokemon into the Republican committee.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.040
It's amazing.

01:06:56.040 --> 01:07:01.040
We can get back to any of this, but there's only a couple things more to get out of the

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.040
pipe.

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:03.040
I just wanted to say that...

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:07.040
I don't know if you guys knew this, but I looked it up because I've been trying to watch

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.040
all of the Saw movies.

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.040
What's your name?

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.040
Jacob.

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.040
Jacob.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:13.040
I've been trying to watch all the Saw movies again.

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.040
I forgot the...

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:18.040
There were four of them when I did it the first time, so I'm up to four.

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:23.040
I just finished Saw 4 and very confused, but just so you know, if you watch all the Saw

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:27.040
movies, you get to four, it gets very confusing, just going to save you some trouble.

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:30.040
The Saw 4 happens at the same time as Saw 3.

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.040
All right.

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.040
Yeah.

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.040
It's...

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:36.040
Just watch them and it's just like, like, like, don't just save yourself some trouble.

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.040
It's not a spoiler.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.040
It's...

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.040
I don't know why they did it that way.

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:40.040
I think because Saw dies...

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:41.040
The guy's name is Saw?

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:49.040
I don't want to spoil this for you guys, but there's 90 of these movies and Saw dies in...

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.040
Well, he starts dying in the first one.

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:53.040
That's the whole point, is that he's dying.

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:55.040
That's why he's Saw.

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:59.040
And then in the second one, he's like, I'm really dying, so I'm sawing everything.

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:04.040
And then in the third one, it's like, remember, I saw that one girl that I sawed in the first

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:05.040
one of the second one.

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:07.040
Now she's like my sidekick.

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.040
This is a spoiler.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.040
She's my protege.

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:10.040
No, it's not.

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:17.040
It's a spoiler of a fucking like crazy telenovela about that there's almost nothing to do with

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:23.040
Saw's and everything to do with the weirdly incompatible themes of puzzles...

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:26.040
And living.

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.040
...joy?

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:32.040
And civil engineering.

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.040
Yeah.

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:36.040
The killer is a...

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:38.040
He's an engineer.

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.040
He loves...

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.040
He makes things.

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.040
And then at one point he wanted...

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.040
So he saw his people.

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:45.040
So Saw three and four happen at the same time.

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:48.040
So don't get confused.

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:52.040
Because there's a guy that walks into the end of Saw four and he's actually watching the

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:53.040
end of Saw three.

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.040
All right.

01:08:54.040 --> 01:09:01.040
Hey, have you guys ever seen a guy wear a hard hat into a bar and just, it would just

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.040
wear it?

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.040
Like he's just wearing a hat?

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.040
Because I did.

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:10.040
And he's out there somewhere and it said Time Warner on his hat.

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.040
There was a guy with a hard hat.

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:13.040
A guy with a hard hat walks into a bar.

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:16.040
He's just wearing a hard hat.

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:19.040
All right.

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:22.040
So you guys think that's okay to wear a hard hat?

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:23.040
Just...

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.040
Yeah.

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.040
They love it.

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:30.040
I think in this day and age it's the only safe way to walk into a bar.

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:31.040
Okay.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.040
I think he was too cool looking.

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.040
He was too hip looking.

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:38.040
And he knew that he's a white collar guy.

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:40.040
But he wouldn't read that way in the bar.

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:43.040
He was like, I'll just wear my hat.

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:44.040
It's me.

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:45.040
It's who I am.

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.040
It shows what I am.

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:47.040
I'm not ashamed of it.

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:49.040
The hard hat to me says I'm on the clock.

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:52.040
But going into the bar says I'm off the clock.

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:55.040
You don't get to do both of those.

01:09:55.040 --> 01:10:00.040
If you've ever worn a hard hat, it's like you want to take it off all the time.

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:01.040
They're not comfortable.

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:04.040
It's like balancing a suitcase on your head.

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:07.040
Maybe he had a head injury and he needs to wear the hard hat.

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:10.040
He could be the best person ever.

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:13.040
I thought that the whole time while I was asking questions about him.

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:16.040
I was like, this guy's the hero and I'm the villain.

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:17.040
What am I doing?

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:19.040
Why isn't he allowed to dress the way he wants to dress?

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:21.040
It's a hard hat.

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.040
It's just weird.

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.040
He was acting like it wasn't a hard hat.

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:26.040
Where was that?

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:27.040
The drawing room.

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:28.040
Oh, yeah.

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:30.040
That place is crawling with Nitteran.

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:35.040
I don't even know what you're talking about.

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:37.040
I love it so much.

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.040
I was in bed with my girlfriend.

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:41.040
I swear to God.

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.040
Hear him out.

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:45.040
Suspend your disbelief.

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.040
And we were having a nice weekend.

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.040
Jacob, this is why I kept you up here.

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:49.040
I want you to hear this.

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.040
Okay.

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.040
Jacob, what are you saying?

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.040
He wants you to come home with him and his girlfriend.

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:57.040
Okay.

01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:02.040
And sing some anthrax for us.

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:08.040
And my girlfriend said to me, I want to start getting you to like light more.

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:10.040
Oh, yeah.

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.040
Light.

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.040
Yeah.

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:13.040
Light hurts you, right?

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.040
Because I don't like light.

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.040
Yeah, like it makes you uncomfortable.

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:18.040
Yeah, I don't like sunlight.

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:21.040
Are you photosensitive?

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:22.040
I don't know.

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:23.040
I don't like light.

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.040
Yeah.

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.040
Sensitive, I don't know.

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:27.040
Don't like it.

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:28.040
I don't like light.

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:31.040
How do you feel about this, the limelight, the stage?

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.040
The necessary evil?

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:37.040
If you had your way, would the stage be totally dark?

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:39.040
Whoa.

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.040
That would be a real podcast.

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.040
Wow.

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:44.040
Let's see what would happen.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:46.040
Yeah, like bring the lights down.

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:48.040
Let's podcast this shit for the live audience.

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:52.040
And the poor fuckers have paid $5 to watch it.

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:55.040
Well, no, but they probably feel like a little bit of relief too.

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:56.040
Oh, they'd love it.

01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.040
Total darkness.

01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.040
Can we take the house lights all the way out?

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.040
Just take them down.

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.040
This is as possible.

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:04.040
How low can we go lighting?

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:08.040
And nobody has like a cosmic sound cue.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:10.040
Meeting me?

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:12.040
But just let it be silent.

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:16.040
I mean, unless anyone had an actual...

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:17.040
You can't.

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.040
Okay, that's good.

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.040
All right.

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:21.040
You want a cosmic sound cue?

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.040
No, actually, we'll save it for later.

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:26.040
This place is crawling with Nidoran.

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:29.040
They come out in the dark.

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:41.040
How many more times do you think I could do that tonight?

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:47.040
I want you to go with me across the cosmos.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:13:04.040
Leave your body behind.

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:29.040
As you float up to the stratosphere, as you float up to the stars, as you find out your identity.

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:33.040
Have an exit plan.

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:44.040
As you continue outside of the blue marble called Earth, it becomes increasingly significant

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:48.040
beneath you.

01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:52.040
You see a planet in the side of your eye.

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:55.040
You go toward it.

01:13:55.040 --> 01:14:03.040
It seems small at first, but as you approach, it gets medium-sized.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:10.040
Finally larger still, integrity is as big as a thing you've ever seen.

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:21.040
You land on this dirt-covered desert-like planet.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:31.040
There is only infinity between you and your goal.

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:43.040
You have only a leather-bound satchel filled with three inventory items.

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:47.040
Your name is Spencer.

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:49.040
Oh, shit.

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:51.040
I don't have an echo.

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:56.040
You shouldn't.

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:59.040
I don't either.

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:03.040
That makes...

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:11.040
I don't need you to do anything as I am not I.

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:15.040
I am what you would call nothing.

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:27.040
However, should you choose to take an action declaring so with specific expressions of

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:36.040
when and why will constitute a player turn,

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:49.040
I remind you you are on a red, dusty planet with satchel with three items.

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:52.040
Spencer.

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:54.040
That would be great if I left.

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:57.040
Oh, now I do have an echo.

01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:59.040
Oh, shit.

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:01.040
What are the items, though?

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:03.040
Are we going to die?

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:06.040
You would like to look into the satchel?

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:09.040
Well, don't I know what's in them already?

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:18.040
When you search back in your mind for the answer to questions about what you already know,

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:23.040
you find yourself curiously shortcoming.

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:25.040
So what's in the satchel then?

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:29.040
You only know your name is Spencer and that you have a satchel.

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:33.040
You feel three bulges from within.

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:36.040
Oh, shit.

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:39.040
I throw them in a hole.

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:44.040
Reaching for the three bulges, you throw the satchel in the hole?

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.040
Oh, yeah.

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:47.040
Yeah, just toss it in a hole.

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:49.040
You throw the whole satchel?

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.040
I'm sorry.

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:51.040
What did you...

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:56.040
Then I'm going to take seven steps backwards and then shit.

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:58.040
Why did you not throw anything?

01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.040
What?

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:00.040
You didn't throw anything?

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:02.040
No, no, I threw it first.

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.040
You threw the satchel?

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.040
Yeah, yeah, and then I shit.

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.040
Okay.

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:11.040
You throw the satchel in the hole and take...

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:14.040
and take seven steps back.

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.040
Okay.

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:21.040
There is a great rumbling, a high-pitched tone that turns into chanting.

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:32.040
The only word of which you can decipher is viscera, viscera, viscera.

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:34.040
I run perpendicular.

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:35.040
Sorry, what?

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.040
Sorry.

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.040
I run perpendicular.

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:40.040
You run perpendicular to the viscera.

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:55.040
To the viscera, as what I was describing continues to happen and a big frog comes out.

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.040
Wait, we say viscera.

01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:57.040
Is it like...

01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:58.040
What the fuck?

01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.040
Who's this?

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:00.040
What?

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:01.040
What?

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:02.040
Jesus.

01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:03.040
Who?

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:04.040
I show yourself.

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:05.040
Who are you?

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:06.040
That's the frog.

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:07.040
Frog.

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:08.040
Speak.

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:11.040
Or be besmirched.

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:12.040
So...

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:17.040
What's with all that viscera you're finding yourself in and amongst?

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:20.040
Seriously, what is with the viscera?

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:22.040
It's your viscera, assumedly.

01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:37.640
I leave you both in a plexiglass cube in Universe 232 of Series 7 of Amazing Marvel

01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:38.640
Man.

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:43.640
And I float away and I open a card shop.

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.640
Oh shit.

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:50.640
I no longer need players to tell me what happens next.

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:53.640
Now I work alone.

01:18:53.640 --> 01:19:03.640
I wipe the counters brass piping, which gives it a classy but slightly Armenian feel.

01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:09.640
I hope today's opening day will be a day of opening.

01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:12.640
Hello, are you open?

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:13.640
What?

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:15.640
I open the door.

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:18.640
I'm Armenian.

01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:20.640
I am God.

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:25.640
I opened a gift shop for Armenians.

01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:28.640
I'm looking for some cards for my wife.

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:30.640
Come in, come in.

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:33.640
Hey, I'm the frog you sent back.

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:34.640
You got comics?

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:35.640
Jesus.

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:36.640
Jesus.

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:37.640
What?

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:39.640
You're getting viscera all over the place.

01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:40.640
Tell you.

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:41.640
Not my fault.

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:42.640
I don't know.

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.640
Tell you what, tell you what.

01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:46.640
Armenian customer, go to IO3.

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:49.640
Or a big card shop.

01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:51.640
Take care of the frog.

01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:53.640
Get out of here.

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:54.640
Why?

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:55.640
Stop it.

01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:56.640
What?

01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:57.640
It's embarrassing.

01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:58.640
Why?

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:00.640
It's embarrassing to see me now.

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:02.640
Is that what this is about?

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:04.640
I've never seen you in the first place.

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:07.640
Why are you in a relationship?

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:08.640
I'm sorry.

01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:10.640
Which way is it?

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.640
Which way is IO3?

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:14.640
IO3 is which way?

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:17.640
IO3 is the best IO ever.

01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:19.640
Go ahead.

01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:21.640
Two for one today.

01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:23.640
Have a coupon.

01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:25.640
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:27.640
What the fuck?

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:28.640
You fuck me.

01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:29.640
You fuck my life.

01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:31.640
I'm trying to get control.

01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:32.640
Over and over.

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:34.640
I wanted to open a store.

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:36.640
And don't give me control.

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:38.640
I don't know who you are.

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:39.640
You.

01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:40.640
You.

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:41.640
You are on you.

01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:42.640
You are on you.

01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:43.640
Nothing's on me.

01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:44.640
Nothing will ever be on me.

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:45.640
Ever again.

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:46.640
I feel like I'm clean.

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:47.640
I'm clean.

01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:49.640
My life with you is a mistake.

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:50.640
Mistake.

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:51.640
I'll take these.

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:52.640
Oh God.

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:53.640
Oh God.

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:54.640
Oh, hello.

01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:56.640
I'll take these two Magnolia candles.

01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:57.640
They have four.

01:20:57.640 --> 01:20:58.640
Okay.

01:20:58.640 --> 01:20:59.640
Oh, four?

01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:00.640
Yes.

01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:01.640
Let me ring you up.

01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:02.640
Okay.

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:03.640
Oh, boop, boop.

01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:04.640
Oh, have it all for free.

01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:06.640
Tell your friends it's a real grocery store.

01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:07.640
Tell them to open.

01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:08.640
He's crazy here.

01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:09.640
Okay.

01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:10.640
Bye.

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:11.640
Shingling.

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:12.640
Shingling.

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:13.640
Shingling.

01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:14.640
You fucking piece of psycho.

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:15.640
Shit.

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:16.640
Shit.

01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:17.640
You have ruined my life.

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:18.640
My life.

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:19.640
Psycho?

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:20.640
That's what you're calling me now?

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:21.640
Really?

01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:22.640
Oh shit.

01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:23.640
Everything.

01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:24.640
Everything.

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:28.640
Everything I have ever put into this world.

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.640
You have reversed a meactitude.

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:33.640
I don't know what you do for a living.

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:35.640
You lived in my guest house?

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:38.640
You said you were a guitarist?

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:40.640
Then you were working on an album?

01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:46.440
I showed you my treatment for a cartoon because you said you had worked at Cartoon Network.

01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:48.640
You gave me notes on it.

01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:52.640
Then I found out you were in Michigan six weeks ago.

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:53.640
Shingling.

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:54.640
Shingling.

01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:55.640
Oh hello.

01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:56.640
Do you guys validate?

01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:57.640
Yes.

01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:00.640
Oh take a free car.

01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:01.640
Just take a car.

01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:02.640
Okay.

01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:03.640
Oh shit.

01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:04.640
Oh take a car.

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:05.640
Oh.

01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:06.640
You fucking like that.

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:09.640
I'm trying to run a crazy store.

01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:10.640
Look.

01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:11.640
Listen.

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:16.640
I'll tell you what.

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:18.240
Come with me.

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:19.640
I want to show you something.

01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:20.640
All right.

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:21.640
Zip.

01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:28.640
I've opened a zipper to the third dimension.

01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:30.640
What else is new?

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:31.640
Whoa.

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:35.640
Has this whole sketch been taking place in two dimensions?

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:39.640
That just blew my mind.

01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:45.640
Because we've been in the darkness this whole time.

01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:46.640
Over here.

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:47.640
Shingling.

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:48.640
Oh shit.

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:49.640
Oh hello.

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:51.640
I can't get my car parked.

01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:52.640
I'm only on an X and Y axis.

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:54.640
I can't get my car.

01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:57.640
I have to like.

01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:58.640
Oh.

01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.640
Just go over it.

01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:02.640
Okay guys thank you.

01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:07.640
I want to show you the three of you something.

01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:10.640
Look at this breakfast cereal box.

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:11.640
Yes.

01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:17.640
See the farm and how the sun just peaks above the distant horizon.

01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:18.640
Right.

01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:19.640
Two scoops.

01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:28.640
What if I told you that this box, not the world in which you live, was reality.

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:36.640
And that we were simulated by the people in the universe on the cover of this box so that

01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:44.640
they could feel cosmologically safer by thinking of themselves as being part of a cereal box.

01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:50.640
And that we are the unreal and they the real.

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:56.640
What if I further told you they had to be with the power to raise their sun.

01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:59.640
Raise sun.

01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:03.640
Raise sun.

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:12.640
Let the light rise as part of your baby car.

01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:15.640
Oh, shit.

01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:20.640
Someone put curtains up on all the walls where the lights were out.

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.640
Is that where the red raisin comes from?

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:23.640
Raisin the lights?

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:24.640
Yeah, yeah.

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:25.640
That's amazing.

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:27.640
What a bad show, huh?

01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:29.640
That was the fucking best thing we've ever done.

01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:30.640
Oh, okay.

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:36.640
Yeah, that was the best thing we've ever done.

01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:37.640
What do you think, Jacob?

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:38.640
I liked it.

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:41.640
What was with all that viscera?

01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:42.640
What do you mean?

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:43.640
There was all that viscera.

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:44.640
Well, where?

01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:45.640
What do you mean?

01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:46.640
Around that frog, I think.

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:47.640
He was chanting viscera.

01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:48.640
You were summoning viscera.

01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:51.640
Oh, I was creating a character named viscera.

01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:52.640
Oh.

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:53.640
Was that the frog?

01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:54.640
I think it was literally viscera.

01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:55.640
Like literally.

01:24:55.640 --> 01:25:02.640
I was creating like a mythology where like, of course, like the devil analog would be like

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:03.640
named viscera.

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:05.640
It's just like, it's because it sounds cultural.

01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:06.640
It sounds cool.

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:07.640
It just means guts.

01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:08.640
It sounds like things like guts and bones and stuff.

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:10.640
Like, you know, like a gorge or something.

01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:11.640
It was cool.

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:12.640
Cool choice.

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:13.640
It sounded really cool.

01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:14.640
Yeah, it does.

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:15.640
I rifted.

01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:16.640
Now I get it.

01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:17.640
If you guys are saying I'm talented, I don't know.

01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:18.640
I don't know.

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:19.640
I just like getting on this.

01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:22.640
I want to know if that Armenian character is going to spin off into some sort of supervillain

01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:23.640
or something.

01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:24.640
Yeah, I want to make it quite.

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:26.640
He's the Joey.

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:31.640
That franchise, the Armenian culture saturation in it is meant to empower.

01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:34.640
It's like the Rubik's Cube TV series in the 80s.

01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:36.640
It was very Latino for no reason.

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:41.640
It was just like a bunch of three Latino kids with a Rubik's Cube.

01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:46.640
Check out Harmontown episode 43.

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:48.640
Okay.

01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:51.640
So, all right.

01:25:51.640 --> 01:26:02.640
Here's the thing.

01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:10.640
I don't believe in gravity.

01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:11.640
No?

01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:12.640
Okay.

01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:13.640
And that provocative enough.

01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:14.640
Let me look something up.

01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:16.640
Do you believe in time?

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:17.640
No.

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:18.640
Yeah.

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:19.640
Speak on that.

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:21.640
What do you mean?

01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:22.640
You don't believe in it.

01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:23.640
Oh, yeah.

01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:25.640
Who would?

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:28.640
That's a weird thing to think.

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:31.640
Have you gotten the impression that I don't believe in time?

01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:32.640
Yeah.

01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:33.640
Really?

01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:34.640
Mm-hmm.

01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:35.640
What do you mean?

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:38.640
You talk about having a weird relationship with time, don't you?

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:40.640
I guess I don't really...

01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:43.640
Oh, you talk about love.

01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:46.640
It's not amusing to anybody but me.

01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:50.640
You mean the way that most people measure it by days and months but I measure it by

01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:52.640
girlfriends and jobs?

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:53.640
No.

01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:56.640
Sure, yeah.

01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:06.640
Have you guys ever...I spent a day going down a...anybody here into creepy pasta?

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:09.640
Yeah.

01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:13.640
So is there good...who would call themselves like an aficionado of it?

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.640
What do you want to know about it?

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:17.640
Well, like I was hoping to meet a new friend but...

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:18.640
I'm just wondering.

01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:19.640
Okay.

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:21.640
I only know trash.

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:22.640
Okay.

01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:23.640
Well, all right.

01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:25.640
So I thought maybe somebody would be like a super...

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:26.640
What do you mean by creepy pasta?

01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:29.640
Well, it's like a thing that's like...like I went down a...

01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:31.640
It's like urban legends.

01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:35.640
It's like urban myths on Reddit and like Fort Shanna thinks what it is, isn't it?

01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:36.640
Yep.

01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:38.640
It's like...it was like the Dead Bart episode considered creepy pasta.

01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:40.640
You might know that one.

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:41.640
Dead Bart.

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:42.640
Yeah.

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:44.640
No, that's allegedly this myth that like...

01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:49.640
Matt Groening gave some guy like...it's intermittent period of time and episode where Bart dies

01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:51.640
and apparently Fox didn't want to air it.

01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:53.640
It's not true but that's like the kind of stuff it is.

01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:56.640
I think he was like, was it Slender Man star off as that too?

01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:57.640
Yeah.

01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:00.640
You know, it's like...it's basically like the internet version of like, you know, urban myths.

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:01.640
It just...

01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:03.640
It's like the Ben Drown thing, Majora's Master.

01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:04.640
Which one was that?

01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.640
So it's sort of like, you're raising your hand.

01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:07.640
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:08.640
You're raising your hand.

01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:09.640
Okay, fuck it.

01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:10.640
Fuck it.

01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:11.640
You're coming on stage.

01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:12.640
You've been raising your hand the whole time.

01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:13.640
What's your name, hand-raiser?

01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:14.640
Dustin.

01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:15.640
Dustin, get up here.

01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:16.640
The man who comes to know us is three in the morning.

01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:17.640
That guy.

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:18.640
For better or worse.

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:20.640
I don't know anything about creepy pasta.

01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:21.640
Oh, great.

01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:22.640
Well, good.

01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:25.640
I just want to be your new friend.

01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:30.640
Let everyone who also wants to come on stage take note of what just happened.

01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:33.640
You see what you could do if you just stick your mind to it.

01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:34.640
Are we friends now?

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:35.640
Okay, yeah.

01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:36.640
Hey, what's your name?

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:37.640
Hey.

01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:38.640
Yeah.

01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:40.640
But you just go, no, you can't do that.

01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:41.640
Sit down.

01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:42.640
You can't...

01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:43.640
You can't say I didn't...

01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:44.640
No, no, no.

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:45.640
You, you're fine.

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:46.640
Wait, what?

01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:47.640
What do you know about creepy pasta?

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:48.640
You didn't know anything about creepy pasta.

01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:49.640
You just came up.

01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:50.640
Right.

01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:51.640
That's what I was saying.

01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:52.640
Well, that's...

01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:53.640
That's what he rejected.

01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:54.640
Yeah.

01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:55.640
Again, you're going to...

01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:56.640
No.

01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:57.640
No.

01:28:57.640 --> 01:28:58.640
No.

01:28:58.640 --> 01:28:59.640
No.

01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:00.640
No.

01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:01.640
No.

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:02.640
No.

01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:03.640
No.

01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:04.640
No.

01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:05.640
No.

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:06.640
No.

01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:07.640
No.

01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:08.640
No.

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:09.640
No.

01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:10.640
No.

01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:11.640
No.

01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:12.640
No.

01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:13.640
No.

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:14.640
No.

01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:15.640
No.

01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:16.640
No.

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:17.640
No.

01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:18.640
No.

01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:19.640
No.

01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:20.640
No.

01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:21.640
No.

01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:22.640
No.

01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:23.640
No.

01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:24.640
No.

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:25.640
No.

01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:26.640
No.

01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:27.640
Yes.

01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:28.640
No.

01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:29.640
No.

01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:30.640
No.

01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:31.640
No.

01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:32.640
No.

01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:33.640
No.

01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:34.640
No.

01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:35.640
No.

01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:36.640
No.

01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:37.640
No.

01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:38.640
No.

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:39.640
No.

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:40.640
No.

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:41.640
Do I just...

01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:42.640
No.

01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:43.640
No.

01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:44.640
No.

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:45.640
No.

01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:46.640
No.

01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:47.640
No.

01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:48.640
I didn't know that.

01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:53.640
That's the sound that every serial killer hears in his head going back and forth.

01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:54.640
That's it.

01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:55.640
Like, those...

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.640
I'm proud of that, actually.

01:29:57.640 --> 01:29:58.640
Like, he's Robert F. Kennedy.

01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:00.640
Yeah, but don't you think he should die?

01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:01.640
I don't know what to do.

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:02.640
He's still a Kennedy.

01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:03.640
Yeah, but I think he should die.

01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:04.640
I mean, that's Deadpool.

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:05.640
That's Deadpool.

01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:06.640
Uh...

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:08.640
What's sir Han?

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:09.640
Sir Han.

01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:13.640
First of all, what's your name, pink-haired gal?

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:14.640
I'm Molly.

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:15.640
Molly, hello.

01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:16.640
And your name, sir?

01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:17.640
Nickname's Panda.

01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:18.640
Panda.

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:19.640
Your nickname is Panda.

01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:20.640
Yes.

01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:22.640
So we can affectionately call you Panda here.

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:23.640
That's totally fine.

01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:24.640
So we got Molly, Panda, and Jacob.

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:25.640
All right.

01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:26.640
Yep.

01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:27.640
I like what's going on here.

01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:28.640
All right.

01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:29.640
What was your name, guy that we shut down?

01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:30.640
Dustin.

01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:31.640
Dustin.

01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:32.640
Your voice is so...

01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:33.640
Like, you should be in the opera.

01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:34.640
He is in the opera.

01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:35.640
Why are you holding a pencil?

01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:36.640
Oh, he's been holding it all night.

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:37.640
He's been holding it all night.

01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:38.640
Oh, shit.

01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:39.640
He has not put it down for a second.

01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:40.640
This helps me do my job.

01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:41.640
Dustin, why are the rage, man?

01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:42.640
What's going on?

01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:43.640
Seriously, why?

01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:46.640
Why the rage towards the pencil?

01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:48.640
What pencil do to you?

01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:50.640
I just want to be loved.

01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:51.640
How's it going?

01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:53.640
Don't go to elementary school three in the morning.

01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:54.640
That's simple.

01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:56.640
We all want to be loved.

01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:57.640
All right.

01:30:57.640 --> 01:31:04.640
Just stop reacting to Dustin, which I know is your worst nightmare.

01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:10.640
I know that a nurse said that as you were just coming out.

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:14.640
And that's why the fuse was lit.

01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:16.640
I'm kidding.

01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:20.640
I'm drunk and high, and I shouldn't have a podcast.

01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:21.640
That's why we pay to see you.

01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:23.640
Certainly, there's urban myths.

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:24.640
All right.

01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:27.640
So, Slender Man is a good example of good creepypasta, meaning it.

01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:30.640
And so, when we say creepypasta, do we mean a genre?

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:31.640
We mean a medium?

01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:33.640
We mean as if we're saying urban legends.

01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:38.640
We're kind of meaning an internet-based urban legend.

01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:40.640
Yeah, it's a meme.

01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:42.640
It's a meme.

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:45.640
It is a meme, but it's essentially, as you've stated, right?

01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:47.640
It's urban myths in a different format.

01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:49.640
So, it's mostly people writing scary-

01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:52.640
It's meant to be consumed on the internet.

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:53.640
Usually.

01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:59.640
And so, the successful ones are kind of more, they're better consumed on the internet.

01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:02.640
So, the Slender Man success was like, shit.

01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:04.640
I think that was a successful one, actually.

01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:05.640
No, there's a couple.

01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:07.640
I mean, the Bart one you mentioned is also pretty popular.

01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:09.640
I mean, Slender Man was actually made into games.

01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:11.640
I mean, I remember...

01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:12.640
It's popular.

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:13.640
Yes.

01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:15.640
I mean, little actual studios developed Slender Man games.

01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:21.640
The Bart one's just, you know, a prevalent urban myth that's called creepypasta.

01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:23.640
You mentioned one from Majora's Mask, right?

01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:26.640
Not simply with that one, but I do know you're talking about.

01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:29.640
That seems to be just...

01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:31.640
Why is it called creepypasta?

01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:32.640
I don't know.

01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:36.640
Copypasta is a thing that means you just repost content.

01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:38.640
It's what you do with memes, essentially.

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:39.640
You copy and taste the memes.

01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:40.640
The more you know.

01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:42.640
And if it's a creepy copypasta, well, there you go.

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:47.640
Fourth of July weekend, I had my laptop open and Cody will sleep.

01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:49.640
She'll sleep as long as...

01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:51.640
She'll just sleep.

01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:56.640
But she also likes to listen to stuff, and I just went through this weird thing where I started listening to...

01:32:56.640 --> 01:33:03.640
I went to Illuminati videos, and then from there, I went down this hole to...

01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:08.640
It was true horror stories, like 20...

01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:09.640
But it was like...

01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:12.640
I went to this really specific section of the drain that was basically like...

01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:17.640
It was kind of like Tumblr, and it was all the protagonists were female,

01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:23.640
and it was like really ultra believable stories of like 16-year-old girls ending up at the wrong party.

01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:24.640
Was it the porno?

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:25.640
It wasn't, no.

01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:27.640
No, it sounds like.

01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:31.640
It was ghost stories, but it was just girls going like...

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:33.640
But it was a guy narrator too.

01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:37.640
There's lots of like Discovery Channel.

01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:43.640
Discovery Channel. There's lots of Discovery Channel TV shows all about that.

01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:46.640
They have like a whole haunted series.

01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:47.640
Right.

01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:48.640
They're like...

01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:50.640
Okay, so it was...

01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:52.640
I still think it was a porno.

01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:54.640
But that was in the internet.

01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:55.640
But that was in the internet.

01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:57.640
So was that different than the...

01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:01.640
No, I...

01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:03.640
But 16-year-olds and like...

01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:04.640
What is he talking about?

01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:05.640
I'm lost.

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:07.640
No, because you're mentioning like the Discovery Channel.

01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:10.640
Sometimes I'm talking about like those weird, you know, fake paranormal shows.

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:12.640
It's like independently made.

01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:15.640
I'm talking about peyote right now. This is amazing.

01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:19.640
Hey Panda, will you draw in my book while you're shooting?

01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:20.640
No, because Panda's movie...

01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:21.640
Let's make this more interesting.

01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:23.640
You do a scribble first and I'll do something from that.

01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:25.640
Oh, shit.

01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:27.640
Just a light scribble. Something blind.

01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:29.640
I gotcha. I love this game.

01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:30.640
All right, you guys.

01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:33.640
All right, tell me what you're familiar with, young people.

01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:38.640
I'm just gonna say a phrase.

01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:42.640
Like, because I just watched watching like YouTube videos of like 20 things,

01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:43.640
that this and 15 things with that.

01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:45.640
So...

01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:47.640
That's another good one, yeah.

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:49.640
E-E-E-V-P body of a pig.

01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:53.640
Like, you guys watch the E-V-P videos of body of a pig.

01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:55.640
And it's like a, you know what E-V-P is?

01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:58.640
It's like the ghost hunter thing where you like wave a thing around you here.

01:34:58.640 --> 01:34:59.640
Oh, Alan.

01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:00.640
Yeah, it's just like a creepy video.

01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:03.640
It's like, you can swear that you hear the body of a pig.

01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:05.640
Who cares?

01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:08.640
Have you guys seen the Croatian stocking tape?

01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:11.640
Oh, is that the one with the truck where they're going backwards?

01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:16.640
No, no, no. The creepy dude with the hood, like a hood over his face.

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:20.640
That's like, it's just like, it's just like sort of a weird found footage.

01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:23.640
Like, it's on the bubble between like, obviously this is fake and staged,

01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:28.640
but at the same time, like, it hasn't, there's no need to expose it,

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:32.640
because it, and therefore, I don't know, I don't know,

01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:34.640
I'm just curious about this like finger of mythology,

01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:37.640
because I spent the day like looking up these videos, like,

01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:40.640
so there's a video where there's like two Croatian dudes that are doing parkour

01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:42.640
in a park or something.

01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:45.640
And then there's like this guy that keeps appearing in the distance,

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:48.640
and he has like a weird hood over his face.

01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:52.640
And like, it's just, it's, I think it's probably because you can't tell,

01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:56.640
it probably makes it seem more genuine if you don't speak their language,

01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:58.640
so it seems more real.

01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:02.640
And so there's, and there's just like this weird guy like following them,

01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:06.640
and they're kind of reacting to him as if he's an old drunk man from the village or something,

01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:09.640
but he's, you're like freaking out, and he like follows them.

01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:12.640
And then the whole thing ends with like, they open an elevator in there.

01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:14.640
That just sounds like a regular day in Eastern Europe.

01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:16.640
That's true.

01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:18.640
It sounds like it follows to me.

01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:22.640
I just, I was trying to like these, these horror, these horror movie things,

01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:27.640
like, okay, so Japanese ghost hospital is like a thing like that.

01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:28.640
No, yeah.

01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:31.640
Has anybody seen this like, like, and then some of them,

01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:34.640
then you look in the comment sections and it says like, some people go like,

01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:36.640
this is an ARG, this is an ARG.

01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:37.640
Oh, yeah.

01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:39.640
And I looked that up and it's like, oh, it's an alternate reality.

01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:44.640
Yeah, I was going to talk, like Neurocam was the thing that got me into this like creepy shit,

01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:49.640
because it was real and there's just people that would like watch you and stuff

01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:54.640
and weird creepy videos and you go and wear masks and play chess with people

01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:57.640
and put a USB stick in a wall and like, it was really happening.

01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:00.640
And that's like, and that was happening around the time.

01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:03.640
I was getting into 4chan and stuff, but like, that was like this,

01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:06.640
it turned out to be an art project based out of Australia,

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:09.640
but like, it was some creepy shit, man.

01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:14.640
You know, you'd have to like submit field reports and they'd send you things.

01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:15.640
It was crazy.

01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:16.640
Where'd you find this?

01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:17.640
What?

01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:18.640
Where'd you find this?

01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:19.640
On the internet actually.

01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:21.640
Yeah, I'm an advanced internet user.

01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:23.640
Value it.

01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:24.640
Surfboard and everything.

01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:25.640
Yeah.

01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:26.640
Darknet.

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:27.640
Have you guys heard of it?

01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:29.640
It's like the bees.

01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:30.640
Yeah, it's like.

01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:31.640
That was a good ARG actually.

01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:32.640
Oh, yeah.

01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:33.640
People love it.

01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:34.640
I remember that.

01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:36.640
Have you guys heard of Robert the Doll?

01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:37.640
Yeah.

01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:39.640
It was creepy, like, yeah.

01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:43.640
Oh, Google that.

01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:46.640
Anatoly's Slivko tapes.

01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:48.640
Yeah, what happened to Anatoly?

01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:49.640
Oh, Anatoly.

01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:53.640
He's like a real life creepypasta.

01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:57.640
There was this guy who was, I think this is like in the eastern block,

01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:03.640
like back when this was possible, like, became like a Cub Scout leader,

01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:04.640
kind of.

01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:06.640
I think it's the pioneers.

01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:07.640
Fucked up shit.

01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:08.640
There's like films.

01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:09.640
This is actually a real thing.

01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:10.640
Russian version of Boy Scouts.

01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:11.640
Let's say what?

01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:13.640
That was the Russian version of Boy Scouts of Pioneers.

01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:14.640
Is that what it was?

01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:15.640
I don't know.

01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:17.640
No, like the Soviet Boy Scouts called the pioneers.

01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:18.640
I think they still call that today.

01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:19.640
Okay.

01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:20.640
I know where the shit, okay.

01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:23.640
That wasn't the, there was a guy, there was a guy that there was like,

01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:25.640
it's a found footage horror thing online.

01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:27.640
Like you find this found footage like he,

01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:31.640
because he was like a Cub Scout leader that like,

01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:34.640
he was doing fucked up things with the, like he making them like,

01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:40.640
he said, let's do a movie where we, I hang you until you're unconscious

01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:42.640
and like the videos exist.

01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:43.640
Okay.

01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:44.640
What's going on with Chinese infrastructure?

01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:46.640
That's another thing that I, so there's like,

01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:49.640
there's videos or just people are just walking and then there's a sinkhole

01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:51.640
or there's like a baby getting run over.

01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:52.640
Rapid building.

01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:54.640
I mean, it's, it's a lot of money flooding into the country

01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:57.640
and they're handling it the best they can.

01:38:57.640 --> 01:38:58.640
Yeah.

01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:02.640
They just, you know, cheapest bidder builds it.

01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:03.640
That's all it is.

01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:04.640
And it's also the government.

01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:05.640
It's not money.

01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:07.640
I mean, eminent domain, you think that's this thing in this country.

01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:09.640
They use it like it's a weapon.

01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:10.640
Oh, God, yeah.

01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:12.640
Sinkholes happen everywhere though.

01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:14.640
What's your, what's your deal?

01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:18.640
You have a, you talk crazy, like a crazy person.

01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:19.640
I picked this up a while ago.

01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:20.640
What's your origin story?

01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:23.640
I was born here in Los Angeles and St. Mary's.

01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:26.640
I dodged the war by year and we dodged the LA riots by a couple blocks.

01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:27.640
You were born in Los Angeles.

01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:28.640
What's this?

01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:30.640
You have an accent of some kind.

01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:31.640
I picked this up over time.

01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:33.640
What do you mean? What, what, what have you picked up?

01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:34.640
You were born in Los Angeles.

01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:36.640
Everything that I found interesting over time.

01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:37.640
I picked it up.

01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:38.640
Nobody mean your accent.

01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:39.640
The accent that you have.

01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:40.640
You have an accent.

01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:42.640
People, don't people tell you you have an accent?

01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:43.640
Absolutely.

01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:44.640
And sometimes I switch it up like, you want to hear that?

01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:45.640
Wait, what's that?

01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:46.640
You want to hear it?

01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:47.640
I could do this for the whole time.

01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:48.640
All right.

01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:49.640
Okay.

01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:50.640
Yes.

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:51.640
I like that.

01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:52.640
That's great.

01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:53.640
Why are you talking with that, I guess?

01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:54.640
No, you can talk however you want.

01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:56.640
I was like, I thought that there was like, but that's weird.

01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:57.640
I mean, there is one.

01:39:57.640 --> 01:39:59.640
If you want to believe there is one.

01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:00.640
Oh my God.

01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:01.640
I love it.

01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:02.640
I love it.

01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:03.640
Oh, shit.

01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:04.640
Great.

01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:05.640
This is what I'm talking about.

01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:06.640
I want to have this happen.

01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:08.640
There's a lot of dark things you're going to slowly take into account.

01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:09.640
Well, this is the thing.

01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:10.640
I just, like, well, that's what I was talking about.

01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:11.640
I was like, I went down this well.

01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:15.640
It was like, so there were these YouTube, like, go, like, illuminati videos.

01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:19.640
And then you go to like, like, oh, look, Michelle Obama's a reptile.

01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:20.640
And you kind of like, okay.

01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:24.640
And you keep going and it's like, you're always looking at the, like, the thing that's

01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:27.640
like, suggested for you in the corner because you've gone down that hole.

01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:28.640
And I'm just like, like, I'm 43.

01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:30.640
And I'm just, I'm just doing this.

01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:34.640
And I'm like, the stuff that was like really became satisfying for me was the fact that

01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:38.640
it was, then I went to these things that were like, oh, there's a new need for urban legends

01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:40.640
and there's slender man and all that stuff.

01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:45.640
But deep beneath that, the things that were actually kind of like, like actually affecting

01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:50.640
me, it was weird because it was like also like, it was, it was these, that's the thing

01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:54.640
I was talking about was that there were these horror story, this is horror story genre,

01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:59.640
where it's like, these are real true stories that are like scary and they're like playing

01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:07.640
horror music, but it's really just a, it's, it's like a teenage girl in modern society

01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:15.640
describing a fucking freaky brush with like a, like a crazy person that they ran up against

01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:20.640
that, that, that, but it's, it's typically as far as I could find, it was a dude reading

01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:25.640
the, the story because the stories are popular in some environment and it's like sort of

01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:31.640
like, it's merged with creepy pasta, but these are like the truer the stories are, the more

01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:38.640
valuable they are and it's like, like, but then there's like these compilations that are

01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:45.640
edited together where there's like a 35 year old guy reading the stories into a microphone

01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:53.640
about, I was, I was just out of high school and I wanted to have some fun, my girlfriends

01:41:53.640 --> 01:42:01.640
were a little more loose than me, I like reading and just want to get into a good college, so

01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:07.640
when they said we wanted to take MDMA and go to a local party, I only wanted to go to

01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:13.640
make sure they didn't get into trouble, when we pulled up to the house there was already

01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:18.640
a creepy air, the man, and it just keeps up, but it's like, it sounds like Alec Baldwin

01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:24.640
reading the story, but it, it's like just, what is my point? I don't know, it sounds

01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:26.640
like a genuine, like, fan fiction.

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:30.640
I'm more worried about the fact that all the reptile videos are so poor quality, you ever

01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:31.640
noticed that?

01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:32.640
That's kind of the point though.

01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:33.640
It's like found footage being crappy.

01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:36.640
No, it's not that one, it's like, all these people believe in the, you know, the reptile

01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:39.640
conspiracy nonsense, I don't know if anybody's made with that one.

01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:40.640
Bigfoot.

01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:44.640
It's a really, really little quality of myself, like, do you just not have any cameras that

01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:47.640
are older than 15 years, like, anything newer than 15 years old or something?

01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:49.640
No, but we're, I don't know why, but...

01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:53.640
It sells the authenticity of it, it's like, why buy a distress shirt at $50, it's more

01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:54.640
authentic.

01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:56.640
I don't know, it's just, I think it's probably weird.

01:42:56.640 --> 01:42:57.640
Also, when cameras got better...

01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:00.640
We have to do a thing, you guys are both smart, so you can do this for me, right?

01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:05.640
Like, let's do a thing, like, pretend, like, okay, just pretend you're both in my head,

01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:06.640
and...

01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:08.640
Can I be your sexy side?

01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:13.640
Like, you guys find your own, like, dichotomy, because that's part of the appeal, is that

01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:15.640
I don't think, I don't need to force it.

01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:22.640
Like, I think, even, like, like, I'm shopping for, I'm just shopping for, I don't want to,

01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:24.640
I don't want to set you guys up to fail.

01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:32.640
Like, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm just like, I'm just looking at apples, I'm just looking at it.

01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:33.640
No, that's not, that's not good.

01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:34.640
Sorry.

01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:35.640
No, no, no.

01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:37.640
Okay, you guys are both enthusiastic about apples.

01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:38.640
Oh, yeah.

01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:43.640
So, you guys are my inside out, like, like, but don't assume, like, there's, you know,

01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:50.640
you're, you don't have to be angry or happy, that's, you guys are the two poles of my

01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:54.640
decision-making process, as I look at a bushel of apples.

01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:56.640
What is Molly?

01:43:56.640 --> 01:43:57.640
What?

01:43:57.640 --> 01:43:58.640
What am I doing?

01:43:58.640 --> 01:43:59.640
Oh, Jesus.

01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:00.640
The superhero.

01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:02.640
Yeah, I'm the superhero.

01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:06.640
Well, Molly's gonna hang out and watch this, because, like, I mean...

01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:10.640
How about Molly, we're at a, we're at an apple orchard, and we're buying apples fresh.

01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:16.640
Okay, well, Molly, Molly, you can be the apple, the apple orchard owner, and I'm visiting

01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:17.640
it.

01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:22.640
And so you set me up to make difficult choices, and every time I have to make a choice, then

01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:25.640
you guys, you guys, okay, so...

01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:26.640
So we're talking with you.

01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:27.640
All right, so here we go.

01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:29.640
We got a bushel of...

01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:32.640
Well, let me, let's, well, let me arrive at the place.

01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:33.640
Okay.

01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:35.640
Well, I'll do the, I mean...

01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:37.640
Oh, yeah, shut up.

01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:39.640
I want you to focus on...

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:40.640
What?

01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:41.640
He's doing it.

01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:42.640
Now, who's doing it?

01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:43.640
He's doing it.

01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:44.640
Stop it.

01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:45.640
Oh, Spencer, okay.

01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:46.640
Okay.

01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:47.640
Okay, we got it.

01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:48.640
We got it, guys.

01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:53.640
Oh, man, it's great to come to this apple orchard.

01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:54.640
Woof, woof.

01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:55.640
Oh, say, my dog.

01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:56.640
He does this.

01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:57.640
Oh, look at this fella.

01:44:57.640 --> 01:44:58.640
He's so enthusiastic.

01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:06.640
He looks delicious.

01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:07.640
Hope he has little shots.

01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:10.640
That's all I'm going to say.

01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:14.640
Sorry, I, I'm sorry, I...

01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:15.640
Oh, oh.

01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:16.640
I love your dogs.

01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:17.640
Oh, yeah.

01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:18.640
So, all right.

01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:20.640
Well, welcome to my apple orchard here.

01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:23.640
I got two kinds of apples that I like to grow here.

01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:28.640
One is a very tart, juicy green apple.

01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:33.640
There's a very, very specific kind of rare green apple that I like to have.

01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:36.640
It has a very nice hint of tennis ball in it.

01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:37.640
They're apples.

01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:38.640
What's with the sales pitch?

01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:39.640
Okay.

01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:40.640
All right.

01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:41.640
So, and then...

01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:42.640
On the other side...

01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:43.640
We're hungry.

01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:44.640
We're hungry.

01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:47.640
On the other side, we got some...

01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:50.640
Actually, my IRL favorite apples...

01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:51.640
IRL, really?

01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:52.640
IRL.

01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:53.640
IRL.

01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:54.640
We're hungry.

01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:55.640
Honey, Chris, apples.

01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:56.640
We'll sell it.

01:45:56.640 --> 01:45:57.640
IRL.

01:45:57.640 --> 01:45:58.640
And so, I grow those two.

01:45:58.640 --> 01:45:59.640
We'll buy them all.

01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:00.640
Okay.

01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:03.640
So, I just should basically choose between green apples and red apples first off.

01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:05.640
But both of them sound really good.

01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:06.640
Well, no.

01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:07.640
Red.

01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:08.640
No, no, no, no.

01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:09.640
Red.

01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:10.640
Red.

01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:11.640
Red.

01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:12.640
Red.

01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:13.640
Red.

01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:14.640
Red.

01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:15.640
Red.

01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:16.640
Red.

01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:17.640
Red.

01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:18.640
Red.

01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:19.640
Red.

01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:20.640
Red.

01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:21.640
Red.

01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:22.640
Okay.

01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:23.640
Alright.

01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:26.640
I don't think this worked.

01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:27.640
Sorry.

01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:28.640
No, it's not.

01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:31.640
I don't think it's your fault.

01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:32.640
Okay.

01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:35.640
I'll put more...

01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:37.640
I'll bridle it.

01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:40.640
I'm going to pipe this through some...

01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:44.640
I know there's entertainment gold here available.

01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:45.640
Okay.

01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:48.640
So, I'm going to give you guys rules.

01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:56.100
So I'm in a, I'm walking through, I am a character in my life, I am walking through my life.

01:46:56.100 --> 01:46:59.280
And I'm going to come up to decisions that need to be made.

01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:05.240
When I do, I think you guys want to kind of do a thing where you go first and you kind

01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:07.860
of just do a little, a little thing.

01:47:07.860 --> 01:47:11.160
Just do a little monologue and then you do one.

01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:13.160
This is going to be great.

01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:14.160
Okay.

01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:18.540
I understand I need to go to, there's a bathroom.

01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:19.540
Did I go to the bathroom?

01:47:19.540 --> 01:47:20.540
Yeah.

01:47:20.540 --> 01:47:21.540
Okay.

01:47:21.540 --> 01:47:22.540
Thank you.

01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:36.480
Oh man, it's, there's a, there's a hand, an air powered hand dryer and a, a bin of

01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:38.880
brown hand towels.

01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:39.880
Fuck.

01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:44.280
I, I, I don't, I mean, I'm going to wash my hands, but then how am I going to dry my

01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:45.280
hands?

01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:51.680
I can't, I, I'm too drunk for this right now, I just, I just, you know, the sanitation

01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:52.680
doesn't work for me.

01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:55.280
I mean, just the, just, just use the towels and we're sent here.

01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:56.280
All right.

01:47:56.280 --> 01:47:57.280
All right.

01:47:57.280 --> 01:47:58.280
So it can't be harnessed.

01:47:58.280 --> 01:47:59.280
That's the answer.

01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:00.280
It can't be harnessed.

01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:01.280
It was an organic thing.

01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:04.280
It was fun and I tried to make it into a thing and it didn't work.

01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:08.760
I want to know what kind of apples you were going to pick.

01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:09.760
Yeah.

01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:10.760
That's what I want to know.

01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:11.760
Yeah.

01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:12.760
We, we failed.

01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:15.600
I feel like, I feel like you left the apple orchard.

01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:17.640
I would have gone for green.

01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:18.640
White green.

01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:19.640
What?

01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:20.640
Seriously, white green.

01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:21.640
Pain is beautiful.

01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:24.640
It has nothing to do with pain.

01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:28.080
Who else has IRL and trying to sell you apples?

01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:33.320
She's, she's a hip, I don't know, well it sounds like she's just wandered onto someone's

01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:34.320
property.

01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:35.920
I don't know that she was trying to sell apples.

01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:38.120
You don't believe she could be an apple.

01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:40.640
She was just reacting to the shifting situation.

01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:41.640
I have signs.

01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:42.640
Oh.

01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:43.640
That wasn't clear.

01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:44.640
You're my apple orchard.

01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:45.640
That's the point.

01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:47.480
It wasn't clear, right?

01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:48.480
Yeah.

01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:51.400
It wasn't clear and I'm right.

01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:52.400
We could agree to that.

01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:59.520
And this place is crawling with Nitteran.

01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:01.800
See this is how you do a comedy show.

01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:03.800
All right.

01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:05.300
Well, okay.

01:49:05.300 --> 01:49:10.200
Dan, play both characters in your head of the choice between the hand, the air dryer

01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:13.000
and the paper, the brown paper towels.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Like what?

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.000
No, no.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.000
What are you talking about?

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000
No.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.000
I think that was maybe a low stakes conundrum.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:21.000
I thought you were going to go like, oh, a million dollars.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.000
No.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Okay.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Like a real quantity.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.000
There's a million dollars.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000
No.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.000
I don't, no.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Let's try it a third time.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:29.000
That's it yet.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:30.000
Let's just, let's just.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Third time to charm.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Let's just wipe it.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Like, okay.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.000
I'm waking up in the morning.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.000
I'm waking up in the morning.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Oh, God.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Damn.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Fuck.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.000
So early.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Get up.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Put on my shoes.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:42.000
First?

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:43.000
How do you know they're not slippers?

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Go over there.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Make some toast.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Let's get put on my shoes first.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.000
They don't like to be slippers.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.000
I don't see what.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Making some toast.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Maybe light brown.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.000
I don't like to do that.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:52.000
No.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Keep it dark.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:54.000
That's fine.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.000
I'm just going to go like this.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.000
All right.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.000
All right.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.000
All right.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.000
All right.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.000
All right.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000
All right.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.000
All right.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.000
All right.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.000
All right.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.000
All right.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.000
All right.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.000
No, keep it dark.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Just tastes like bread at that point.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Sucks.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.000
All right.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Toast us up.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Go over to the refrigerator.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
He doesn't listen to any of the words.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:22.000
Get some butter.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Butters for busies.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Marmalade.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Thank you.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Yes.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Marmalade.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Marmalade.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.000
That's nothing.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Darker.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Grape.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Grape.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Jelly.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Grape.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:38.000
I'm going to get some marmalade.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Wait.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:40.000
No.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.000
It's like grape jam.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Yeah.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Yeah.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Yeah.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Nice and slow.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:46.000
All right.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Okay.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.000
That's good.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Well, time to go to work.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Open this.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Don't run people over.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:52.000
I know you want to, but don't run people over.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:53.000
No, just run them over.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.000
You know what I mean?

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.000
You're semi-famous.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:56.000
You might be able to get away with it.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:09.000
It's a good day to wear nothing but shoes.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Get inside the car.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Close the door.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Start driving.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:14.000
How's it going?

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:15.000
How are you doing?

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Oh, it's been a while.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:17.000
It's been a while.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:18.000
It's been a while.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:19.000
It's been a while.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.000
It's been a while.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000
It's been a while.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000
It's been a while.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.000
It's been a while.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000
It's been a while.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
How are you doing?

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Oh, Spencer.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Hey.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000
What is he doing here?

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.000
What the hell is he doing here?

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000
I'm driving.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Can I have one of those ice cream cones?

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Yeah.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Oh.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Take one.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Damn it.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Every day you ask for one.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Thanks, man.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Really?

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Why?

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Because he dates us.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.000
We need to kill him.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:45.000
You're right.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:46.000
We do, but the question is how?

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
I mean, how do we get away with it?

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Needle rings.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
How did that help us?

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
What the fuck was that?

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:54.000
What the fuck was that?

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Oh, shit.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Hey, I rolled my window down.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.000
It's not your kill.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.000
It's Knight Rider.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Yes, it is.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:01.000
I'm an Armenian guy.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.000
I just got a free car.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Got a free car from our last sketch we were in.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:10.000
You want to race an Armenian guy?

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Dad Hammond?

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Oh, an Armenian guy.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Do you want some apples?

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Green, please.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.000
What the hell am I trying to do?

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
What are they looking at apples for?

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
What is this place to come from?

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.000
What is going on here?

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Spencer raised the guy.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Oh, well, I think we're winning.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
He's buying apples.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Oh, you piece of shit.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Yeah.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:32.000
All right.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Distracting my apples.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Don't run people over.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Don't run people over.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Don't run people over.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Go, go, go.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.000
All right.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Spencer, take me to work.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.000
All right.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.000
I'm going to have to use the turbo boost.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
This guy fucking sucks at driving.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Yes, he does.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.000
What do I pay him for?

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Man, I need a raise.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Also, I've been drinking.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
What else is new?

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Shit.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:57.000
What do you have to think about that?

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Oh, well, oh, oh, oh.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Yeah, I should give you a raise.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.000
I'm going to give you a raise.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Do you work hard?

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Yeah, right.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Bullshit.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:05.000
I'm not going to give you a shit.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.000
All right, deserve a shit.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:07.000
I tried.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:08.000
All right.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:11.000
I'm going up to the office to work.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Fuck it.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.000
I hate walking up these stairs.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:14.000
There's too many of them.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.000
You covered two stories.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000
There's too much.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:17.000
You're right.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:18.000
Here we go.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:21.000
Man, yeah, maybe it's good once in a while to exercise.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Yeah.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Typing.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Sydney's looking for you.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Sydney, what do you want?

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
How's the air conditioning?

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Stop talking to me.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Stop talking to me.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Don't leave me free.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.000
All right.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:36.000
I'm creating here.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:40.000
And switch the sign on the door to just not talk to me.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:41.000
OK.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Typing.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Can I pause for a minute real quick?

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Yeah.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
I feel like he's the negative, and I'm being negative as well.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Right, I love it.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:51.000
You're evil, and he's just upset at things.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.000
That's not that big of a contrast.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000
I like it.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.000
I'll be able to pause it.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.000
No, keep doing it.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
It didn't work.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
It didn't work.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.000
It's not your fault.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:01.000
It's been working.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.000
No, no, no.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Yes.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.000
No, no, no.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Ask these guys.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:06.000
It didn't work.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.000
No, they loved it.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Ask them what would work.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:13.000
A rap about freestyle rapping.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:16.000
You kids, you love your raps about 9-11.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Hell, they do.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:18.000
I'll hit it.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Oh, yeah.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:22.000
What a rap about 9-11.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Oh, oh, oh.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Yo.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Yo.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Yo.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Yo.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.000
Yo.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Yo.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Talk cool.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Yo.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Yo.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Yo.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Gleaming towers reach to the sky.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:40.000
She's got a tear, don't know why.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:44.000
America had so much better to do.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
But what about you?

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Reach into the future.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Sunk in the past.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Every sneaker steps, but you can't last.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
You go to 30 from 70 to 2.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
What you gonna do on Facebook?

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
You gonna hashtag?

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:58.000
You gonna complain?

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
You gonna go out and do the purple rain?

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:03.000
You gonna fucking do your shit?

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:07.000
But when you go down in the sewer, you gonna get it dead.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Bye, Stephen King.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Tim Curry.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Play the king.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:15.000
He's a clown.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Make you look into the dead lights.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Fuck your mama like headlights.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
That's not a good rhyme.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Dead lights was a play on headlights.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:26.000
When Stephen King wrote it, lights out.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Just keep writing.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Don't look back, Stephen.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Never look back.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Backspace King.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Like a heart attack.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Make a hundred bucks.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Tommy Knockers.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Christine Footlocker.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Needs the salesman.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:47.000
So you go to the mall and you gonna do mailman.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Give me a second.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.000
I'm the Armenian guy.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Yo.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:57.000
I'm the Armenian guy.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Yo.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Green apples.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Put your foot inside the gas.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Take your foot out.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Look at your ass.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Your ass is a foot.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Your foot is an ass.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Now you're gonna stay after polymorph class.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Passing apples.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Whoa.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:12.000
What the shit?

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Holy shit.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Fucking hit, hit.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Got the target to the tip.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Got the tip, tip, bit.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Tough titties.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Got the rip, bit.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:20.000
Chit, tit.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
A book, dip, bit.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Clip, chip, effect.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:24.000
What?

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Flip the chip, chip.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Weep, thins, good.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Hit and lift, bit, chip, chip.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:29.000
What?

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Eminem.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Whoa.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:32.000
When you go down to this corner.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:33.000
I fucked your mama so hard.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.000
She got a whore hornered.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
It's not a word.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Yo, yo.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
But what is a word?

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Yo.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.000
What is a word?

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Yo.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Johannesburg is a word.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:50.000
So is iceberg.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Titanic got sunk.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Fucked your mama so hard.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Her pussy turned to junk.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Put it in a yacht.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.000
Don't stop.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Fucked your mama so hard.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Her broom turned into a mop.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Wipe the floor with it.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Clean, clean everything up.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Put it in a thing.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
Then it's cold to close the door.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
And when upstairs, try to get some work done.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
I'm the art of Canadian guys.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Trying to get some work done.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
I got a car for free.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Gotta get some work done, work done.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
At a crazy store, at a crazy store.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
I got a drone strike.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Gonna go over Bangalore.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Gonna fuck your mama's shell.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.000
I got a Shangri-La.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Made up a word, Bangalore.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.000
So that it might rhyme with Shangri-La.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Yo.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Drone strike over you.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Fuck your mama so hard.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.000
I made two of your mama.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000
It's called reproduction.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.000
It's not a big feat.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
But when you describe it that way.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.000
You think you're crazy.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:45.000
But then you go another day.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Fuck your mama till lunch.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:48.000
To fuck your mama till tea.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Fuck your mama till two.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Fuck your mama till one.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Oh, no.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Nice.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Because sometimes you go lateral.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Bar none.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Outside the bun, bun.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:00.000
Outside the box.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Lateral thinking has won.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Board meetings from nine to five.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.000
But to fuck your mama so hard.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:06.000
The bitch came alive.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Like Frankenstein's monster.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:09.000
With galvanization.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Fuck your sister's electricity.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Reclamation.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Really stupid.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
I got so excited.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Because I thought I had to fart.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
But here's the thing.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Hanging out.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Hanging out.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Okay.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Here's the thing.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Alright.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:25.000
So give me a second.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Fuck your mama so hard.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:27.000
She couldn't even record.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000
What happened?

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.000
But I said, I fucked you.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000
She said, did I consent?

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:31.000
I said, yes you did.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:32.000
She paid me rent.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Whoa.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:34.000
But I gave it back.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Because I was like, you don't remember.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Then take it back.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Because we need to be fucking accountable.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:42.000
I got, I got, I got, I got, I got, I got accountable.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:45.000
We need to be accountable.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:46.000
No.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:47.000
No.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Don't want to be.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Accountable.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
Need to be accountable.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Sarah Ramali, Panda and Jacob.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Dustin.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Interrupting Dustin.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Spencer Crittenden.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
And I'm Jeff Davis.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Your mayor has been Dan Harmon.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:11.000
He might not be done, but you're allowed to leave.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Yo.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Yo.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Yo.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Yo.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Yo.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.000
1931.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Shit.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
You know the nexus that I'm discussing.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:27.000
It's a Luminati to control at the Bilderberger Skull Island place.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Yo.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:31.000
The Federal Reserve used gold to get back you.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:35.000
But the man of moon, but the moon don't come back.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:36.000
Whoa.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:37.000
The Bilderberger's got a lizard.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Got a lizard.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
They got to go into the blizzard.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Got a.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Oh, Barack Obama is a lizard.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
Oh, shapeshifter got a lizard.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Got a Luminati.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:50.000
You're allowed to stand up and leave.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
No, no, no.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
You're a pussy if you do.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
Yo, yo.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Remember one day when you watched Iron Man and then you walked away

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:02.000
so you didn't see Sam Jackson welcome into shield

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:05.000
so how about that, how'd that make you feel

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
so you gotta hang out until the shit's done

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:10.000
cause you never know what bonus will be won

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
oh shit, three hours after the show

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:15.000
someone should come up and just say oh here's how it goes

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:18.000
Dan Harmon's in the new Avengers

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Yeah!

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Alright, well then that's...

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Rap, rap, rap, secret trap

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:28.000
I'm the Armenian guy

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Rap, rap, secret trap

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.000
My name ends with an I-A-N

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Rap, rap, secret trap

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
Yo, yo, yo, secret trap

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.000
Oh, panda rap, panda rap, panda rap

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Panda rap, panda, panda rap

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Yo, panda rap, panda rap, panda rap

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Did you just fuck? What do you think about that?

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
Did you just fuck? Well it don't mean a thing

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
cause I went to the west side shit and I shot up a pan

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:55.000
cause I've done the streets, I hit the blue

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:58.000
and I'm motherfucking dropping like Pangaroo

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
and I saw him do face and it was so bad

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
that I had to slap you south side

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
that west side ass and I dropped the mic

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
but I couldn't cause my hands got sticky

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:09.000
cause this glue just got super motherfucking sticky

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:13.000
but he dropped that thing that he drops

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:16.000
You know he dropped it

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Jacobs is next, he's gonna wrap your heart out

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
I'm gonna tell you a few things about him

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:21.000
that I learned about

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Oh, he's on LinkedIn, he's gonna send you his profile

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
in just a minute

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
but first he's got this to say

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Jacobs gonna tear the house down, what do you say?

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Jacobs in the house, Jacobs being teed up

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:36.000
Jacobs hype man gonna tee you up, yo

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.000
Uh...

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:43.000
Happy Armedian guy

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Yo, yo, yo, yo

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:49.000
Next up is a little bit of a twist

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:52.000
Oh, what gender could produce this?

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:55.000
A crazy female version of rapping

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:58.000
What's your name? It's MC, what?

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:01.000
MC Molly and I got a big dick

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Whoa, she's got a big dick

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:06.000
You know her rap will go like this

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Listen to this, I got a big dick

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.000
I don't want to tell you how much more than this

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Uh...

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:15.000
I can't either, don't feel bad

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:16.000
I can't watch it in seconds

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Yeah, all right

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
That's, that's...

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Oh gosh, I had a hard time

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:28.000
I'm the Armedian guy

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Just stealing cars and driving away

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Yo, yo, put your foot in a shoe

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Put your sock on a foot, what you're gonna do

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:39.000
Sock to the shoe, to the toe, to the ankle

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Fuck your mama so hard, she got a cancle

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Stupid, because it rhymes with ankle

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Because it's a derivative of the word ankle

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.000
It works

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Chin to the knee to the thigh

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
Fuck your mama so hard

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:52.000
She's got a straw

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Sorry, okay, all right, yo, yo

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
The show ended in ten minutes

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
All right, okay, here's the thing

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:01.000
When you drive home, take a partner

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Don't get mugged

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Don't get snatched, or pulled off

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
That's good advice, right

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
Don't get mugged on the way home

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:13.000
And when you get home, check all your soft tissues

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Breasts, testicles for issues

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:18.000
They could have lumps

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:21.000
You go out

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
You gotta check that shit

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Yeah

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Check yourself, even though you think you're too young

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
To get the numbers

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:36.000
One and two kinds of cancer

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
You can detect them early

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
By checking your little bits in the shower

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
One and two types of cancer

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
I know when I take a shower

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
And I wash my nuts

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:47.000
It jiggles them

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
And I spend the rest of the night going

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Do I have nut cancer?

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:53.000
One and two types of cancer

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
No, yo, here's the thing

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
One and two types of cancer

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Secret trap, secret trap

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
If you advertise during the show

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
You don't care about that

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Here we go

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
Through a star door into the unknown

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:09.000
Through an intestinal trap of the cosmology

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:12.000
I'm gonna show you some truths that you never knew to be

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
There is a planet called rhythm

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
I'm serious

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
There's a planet called rhythm

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.000
I'm serious

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
It's also at six miles in diameter

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:23.000
It has its own atmosphere

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:24.000
It grows

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:25.000
Silicone

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
Mostly on trees

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:28.000
It has a heavenly color

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
The center of the planet is oil

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:31.000
If we go there

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:34.000
There's only a semi-sentient species

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
We can easily kill them

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
It would be a no-no

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
It would be a no-no

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
It would be a no-no

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.000
It would be enough oil to power a whole planet

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.000
We just need to launch one missile

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:53.000
But it would cost 87 trillion dollars

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
Think about it

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Wow

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
There you go

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Drive safe

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Drive fast and take chances

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Well, my name is John

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:04.000
And I'm here to say

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:07.000
I've got a shirt and some pants today

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
I'm doing after the show in this way

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:10.000
My name is John

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
And my rap goes this way

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:13.000
I put a left foot forward

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:14.000
A right foot back

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:17.000
And then I look like I'm on a Nordic track

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:18.000
I'm gonna run from a side

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:19.000
Like a hieroglyphic

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
I fucked your mama so hard

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
The bitch seems s-s-sophilitic

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
That was-but that's on me, isn't it?

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Weird to blame her for the STD I gave her

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
I live in a pyramid

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:35.000
My name is Tom

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:40.000
I-I'm gonna live here for a billion years

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:43.000
If you look under your seat

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
And you have a yellow sticker

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
You get a free car

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:49.000
Look at her teeth

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Nope

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:51.000
Nope

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:52.000
Nope

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:53.000
Nope

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:54.000
Happy Halloween

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Happy New Year

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Fucked your mama for a beer

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:04.000
The world's an illusion

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:05.000
The matrix is real

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:08.000
If you go, your favorite band is SEAL

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
You don't know what you're doing

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:14.000
You're part of the illusion

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
Reptile people run the Federal Reserve

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
They control the interest rates

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
To make the world curve to its ends

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
The New World Order

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Holy fuck, don't take a border

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:35.000
If their shape starts to shift

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
And they say, what's the rent?

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:40.000
Do you turn them away and say you're a reptile?

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:41.000
There's a war coming

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
Dig a hole in your backyard

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
A war coming, reptile people

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:46.000
Do you want to love the reptiles?

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:47.000
We love them

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:48.000
He's one of them

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:49.000
Yeah

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Alright, fuck them

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:51.000
Drive safely

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
I'm glad they ran, can't even prove

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:57.000
Yeah

02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Magic Nations
