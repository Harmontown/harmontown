{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:13.040\nFrom Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, the nerdest, smeltiest, smeltiest melt theater,\n\n00:13.040 --> 00:17.040\nHarmontown is now in session.\n\n00:17.040 --> 00:26.040\nLet's bring out Spencer Crittenden.\n\n00:26.040 --> 00:41.040\nThe mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:41.040 --> 00:43.040\nThank you so much.\n\n00:43.040 --> 00:44.040\nI really want to apologize.\n\n00:44.040 --> 00:52.040\nI'm so sorry about the amount of Nidoran that are here.\n\n00:52.040 --> 00:57.040\nOh, man, that's one of the Pokemons.\n\n00:57.040 --> 01:00.040\nI wanted to gauge how pervasive this was overnight.\n\n01:00.040 --> 01:05.040\nI downloaded it today, and I'm at level four.\n\n01:05.040 --> 01:10.040\nAnd I've already wandered into traffic for a Pokeman.\n\n01:10.040 --> 01:17.040\nAnd then I've already had, like Cody and I, we walked a block to stop at some Poke stops.\n\n01:17.040 --> 01:26.040\nAnd so we already had the guy stop his car and go, let me guess, Pokemon?\n\n01:26.040 --> 01:27.040\nWait, for real?\n\n01:27.040 --> 01:32.040\nThat guy, that guy's not an official part of the game, but...\n\n01:32.040 --> 01:38.040\nAnd Cody and I walked, and Cody's like, wow, this game's so popular.\n\n01:38.040 --> 01:43.040\nI'm like, yeah, it's so popular it's created a sub-biosphere of fucking rapey dudes trying to...\n\n01:43.040 --> 01:52.040\nYeah, Pokemon, it's like, well, let's tell you what, I don't get it, but get in my car, let's talk about it.\n\n01:52.040 --> 01:55.040\nWhich was okay, what are you doing over there?\n\n01:55.040 --> 01:57.040\nYou playing that Pokemon card?\n\n01:57.040 --> 01:59.040\nFuck you!\n\n01:59.040 --> 02:02.040\nSorry, is it weird that I went there?\n\n02:02.040 --> 02:04.040\nBecause otherwise, what's he doing?\n\n02:04.040 --> 02:05.040\nIs that a positive thing?\n\n02:05.040 --> 02:08.040\nAnd he's like, oh, damn it, if that's not two young people playing Pokemon...\n\n02:08.040 --> 02:10.040\nOh, one's old, okay.\n\n02:10.040 --> 02:13.040\nHey, what's going on with the Pokemons?\n\n02:13.040 --> 02:15.040\nBut how could he tell you're playing Pokemons?\n\n02:15.040 --> 02:18.040\nBecause you were looking at your phone and being excited?\n\n02:18.040 --> 02:20.040\nWell, that's, I think that's...\n\n02:20.040 --> 02:22.040\nWell, playing Ski-Ball and a fake thing?\n\n02:22.040 --> 02:26.040\nWell, that's an expression of how explosively popular this game got overnight,\n\n02:26.040 --> 02:31.040\nis that he saw two people just looking at their phones.\n\n02:31.040 --> 02:37.040\nSo last Tuesday, he would have gone, you fucking, probably looking for a goddamn yelp.\n\n02:37.040 --> 02:41.040\nYou guys, you, you, you words with friends?\n\n02:41.040 --> 02:43.040\nYeah, exactly.\n\n02:43.040 --> 02:45.040\nYeah, he would have just like, it was just some general thing.\n\n02:45.040 --> 02:47.040\nHe would have just called us Jews or something.\n\n02:47.040 --> 02:50.040\nI don't know, whatever his hang-up is.\n\n02:50.040 --> 02:54.040\nBut he, that guy, it had reached his life that he, even though he's from New Jersey\n\n02:54.040 --> 02:59.040\nand is driving a Gremlin from a portal from 1975 straight through,\n\n02:59.040 --> 03:05.040\nas he just crosses his trans-dimensional, you know, like weird trailer,\n\n03:05.040 --> 03:10.040\nor Dr. Strange Journey, like as he goes through, that he saw us and was like,\n\n03:10.040 --> 03:13.040\noh, Pokemon, but anyways, I just didn't like the guy.\n\n03:13.040 --> 03:14.040\nI didn't like his style.\n\n03:14.040 --> 03:17.040\nI didn't like that he looked at my woman.\n\n03:17.040 --> 03:19.040\nBut he was right, though.\n\n03:19.040 --> 03:20.040\nHe was hip to your job.\n\n03:20.040 --> 03:21.040\nWe were playing Pokemon.\n\n03:21.040 --> 03:22.040\nRight.\n\n03:22.040 --> 03:26.040\nAnd I haven't, obviously, I haven't caught them all.\n\n03:26.040 --> 03:28.040\nCan you catch all of the Pokemons?\n\n03:28.040 --> 03:30.040\nThat's the goal.\n\n03:30.040 --> 03:31.040\nAllegedly.\n\n03:31.040 --> 03:37.040\nI got some snake snitchers, I got some mitten asses, I got kitten, kitten, kitten bitches,\n\n03:37.040 --> 03:40.040\nand I got like, like stamp, stamp, stamp.\n\n03:40.040 --> 03:42.040\nThe elusive kitten bitch.\n\n03:42.040 --> 03:44.040\nI can't believe you got that on level four.\n\n03:44.040 --> 03:47.040\nI thought that was more like a level 10 Pokemon.\n\n03:47.040 --> 03:48.040\nBut here's the amazing thing.\n\n03:48.040 --> 03:54.040\nLike, when Dungeons and Dragons became popular or like Space Invaders, like, there's been,\n\n03:54.040 --> 03:59.040\nlike, if you go back into the archives, it's kind of funny through your young eyes,\n\n03:59.040 --> 04:07.040\nif you would look at, like, just go Google, like, Space Invaders, I'm trying to, like,\n\n04:07.040 --> 04:12.040\nwhat the phrase would be, like, a threat to society or something like that.\n\n04:12.040 --> 04:18.040\nIt's like a fascinating 1978, like, Tom Brokaw video about Space Invaders and what.\n\n04:18.040 --> 04:24.040\nIt's like a news story about how a guy murdered his wife because she wouldn't let him keep\n\n04:24.040 --> 04:26.040\nplaying Space Invaders.\n\n04:26.040 --> 04:32.040\nPeople talking about, they call it Space Invader Thumb.\n\n04:32.040 --> 04:39.040\nMore commonly known as Carpal Tunnel, but yeah, definitely Space Invaders is causing this.\n\n04:39.040 --> 04:43.040\nAnd just like, and then the Dungeons and Dragons with the people under the tunnels.\n\n04:43.040 --> 04:45.040\nI, I, there was a thing.\n\n04:45.040 --> 04:46.040\nThey were under the tunnels.\n\n04:46.040 --> 04:49.040\nThey weren't even in the tunnels, they were dark elves.\n\n04:49.040 --> 04:51.040\nThey would go underneath the tunnels.\n\n04:51.040 --> 04:52.040\nYeah, these are D&D people.\n\n04:52.040 --> 04:55.040\nThey don't, they don't cotton to tunnels, man.\n\n04:55.040 --> 04:56.040\nThat's underground.\n\n04:56.040 --> 04:58.040\nThey're, they're, they're underneath.\n\n04:58.040 --> 05:03.040\nYeah, there's a, in the 80s Dungeons and Dragons was like a gangster rap.\n\n05:03.040 --> 05:08.040\nIt was like, it was like, it was like, it was the thing that moms were worried about.\n\n05:08.040 --> 05:13.040\nAnd, and, and there was, and there was, there was an urban legend that in colleges,\n\n05:13.040 --> 05:16.040\nthey would play the game and then they would sacrifice.\n\n05:16.040 --> 05:20.040\nAnd then there were like steam tunnels underneath the campuses and these kids had,\n\n05:20.040 --> 05:23.040\nit was very similar to the baby alligator legend.\n\n05:23.040 --> 05:28.040\nThat's like the, the idea that like anything that seems innocent could like go down\n\n05:28.040 --> 05:33.040\nunderneath your world and grow into something monstrous.\n\n05:33.040 --> 05:37.040\nIt's, it's, it's, it's an urban legend about like what's happening under your nose.\n\n05:37.040 --> 05:41.040\nAnd, and so the Dungeons and Dragons was like, these kids go down.\n\n05:41.040 --> 05:46.040\nThey, they, they start playing this game with dice and then they sink down through the\n\n05:46.040 --> 05:50.040\nsoil of the campus you paid for and into these tunnels.\n\n05:50.040 --> 05:54.040\nAnd they, and they pull out real swords and they start stabbing each other.\n\n05:54.040 --> 05:59.040\nAnd that was all based on one kid who went missing from one college and it turned out\n\n05:59.040 --> 06:06.040\nway more to do with heroin and, and, and, and, and also he was like a 15 year old kid\n\n06:06.040 --> 06:10.040\ngoing to school with, he was like Wormser in Revenge of the Nerds.\n\n06:10.040 --> 06:13.040\nHe was like that archetype was like, he was so smart that they said,\n\n06:13.040 --> 06:15.040\nwell you should skip high school, right?\n\n06:15.040 --> 06:19.040\nYou might be Einstein and put him in a school with 20 year olds.\n\n06:19.040 --> 06:20.040\nAnd he was 15.\n\n06:20.040 --> 06:25.040\nHe had so many more things to deal with than Dungeons and Dragons.\n\n06:25.040 --> 06:30.040\nBut no one ever said, oh, well, our class system is making people stab disappear.\n\n06:30.040 --> 06:35.040\nAnyways, yeah, he came back after a while and said, no, I just shot smack and sucked a couple dicks.\n\n06:35.040 --> 06:38.040\nLike, I, I wanted to see the world.\n\n06:38.040 --> 06:40.040\nI figured out you morons weren't going to show it to me.\n\n06:40.040 --> 06:42.040\nLocked me up in this shithole.\n\n06:42.040 --> 06:46.040\nLike he just fucking wandered off and crashed into the dude's house and was like,\n\n06:46.040 --> 06:50.040\nlike, like, like, yeah, like getting high, like making love.\n\n06:50.040 --> 06:54.040\nAnd then he came back and was like, all right, I'm 16 now.\n\n06:54.040 --> 06:56.040\nTime to get down to business.\n\n06:56.040 --> 06:58.040\nAnd then they were like, but what about the Dungeons and Dragons?\n\n06:58.040 --> 06:59.040\nHe was like, what, what?\n\n06:59.040 --> 07:00.040\nI said, well, what?\n\n07:00.040 --> 07:01.040\nNo.\n\n07:01.040 --> 07:02.040\nMorons?\n\n07:02.040 --> 07:03.040\nAnyways, I forgot where I was.\n\n07:03.040 --> 07:04.040\nI'm sorry.\n\n07:04.040 --> 07:05.040\nThe Pokemons.\n\n07:05.040 --> 07:06.040\nYeah, well.\n\n07:06.040 --> 07:10.040\nSo wait, is it, when you level up enough, level five, as I understand it,\n\n07:10.040 --> 07:11.040\nyou can start joining a team?\n\n07:11.040 --> 07:13.040\nYeah, that's, that's my goal.\n\n07:13.040 --> 07:18.040\nWait, you're on the same team?\n\n07:18.040 --> 07:19.040\nNo.\n\n07:19.040 --> 07:21.040\nWait, Jesus Christ.\n\n07:21.040 --> 07:24.040\nNo, you can be on your own team.\n\n07:24.040 --> 07:25.040\nThis seems healthy.\n\n07:25.040 --> 07:27.040\nWait, no, you can't wait.\n\n07:27.040 --> 07:29.040\nYou have to pick one of the three.\n\n07:29.040 --> 07:32.040\nYou get to pick from three primary colors.\n\n07:32.040 --> 07:35.040\nWhy, why are you guys so vehemently yellow?\n\n07:35.040 --> 07:36.040\nFuck up.\n\n07:36.040 --> 07:37.040\nBecause I'm Asian.\n\n07:37.040 --> 07:39.040\nOh God.\n\n07:39.040 --> 07:42.040\nThis seems like a bad road.\n\n07:42.040 --> 07:43.040\nAll right.\n\n07:43.040 --> 07:45.040\nI don't approve of this anymore.\n\n07:45.040 --> 07:49.040\nIt makes me want to go shoot smack and suck a couple of dicks.\n\n07:49.040 --> 07:50.040\nHonestly.\n\n07:50.040 --> 07:53.040\nIt seems like the easier road.\n\n07:53.040 --> 08:00.040\nThat guy that shouted yellow because I'm Asian, like, like, is he going to go home\n\n08:00.040 --> 08:05.040\nand write a Facebook essay about Black Lives Matter or anything?\n\n08:05.040 --> 08:07.040\nLike a not connect the dots?\n\n08:07.040 --> 08:10.040\nLike, all right, let's not let our Pokemon.\n\n08:10.040 --> 08:12.040\nWe collected little, little gagoos.\n\n08:12.040 --> 08:14.040\nI didn't think you had to choose between blue races.\n\n08:14.040 --> 08:16.040\nAre there blues or reds here?\n\n08:16.040 --> 08:17.040\nOkay.\n\n08:17.040 --> 08:19.040\nOh, so it's evenly dispersed.\n\n08:19.040 --> 08:22.040\nBut why were the yellows so vocal up front?\n\n08:22.040 --> 08:24.040\nBecause I'm in the front row.\n\n08:24.040 --> 08:27.040\nOkay, Jesus Christ.\n\n08:27.040 --> 08:31.040\nThere's a lot of yellow people shifting to blue because of you tonight.\n\n08:31.040 --> 08:33.040\nBecause they're like, it's called the blue shift.\n\n08:33.040 --> 08:34.040\nIt's called the blue shift.\n\n08:34.040 --> 08:35.040\nNo one knows what the culture is yet.\n\n08:35.040 --> 08:36.040\nThey're like, what are the stereotypes?\n\n08:36.040 --> 08:38.040\nDo blue people drive like this?\n\n08:38.040 --> 08:43.040\nDo yellow women move in with each other right away?\n\n08:43.040 --> 08:44.040\nI don't know yet.\n\n08:44.040 --> 08:46.040\nI need to talk to some people out in the real world.\n\n08:46.040 --> 08:49.040\nOh, Snaker, Snaker Clouder.\n\n08:49.040 --> 08:53.040\nAre you capturing Pokemons on stage?\n\n08:53.040 --> 08:56.040\nWell, that was an imaginary one.\n\n08:56.040 --> 08:59.040\nI didn't do a good job of riffing the name of one, did I?\n\n08:59.040 --> 09:01.040\nSnaker Clouder.\n\n09:01.040 --> 09:05.040\nBut this game, Dan and Cody talked me into downloading it.\n\n09:05.040 --> 09:06.040\nI looked at it.\n\n09:06.040 --> 09:10.040\nIt looks like Google Maps, but there's little dragons on it.\n\n09:10.040 --> 09:13.040\nAnd then you're walking around a map of your neighborhood\n\n09:13.040 --> 09:17.040\nand it's trying to convince me to walk down an alleyway\n\n09:17.040 --> 09:21.040\nwhere I'm certainly going to be waylaid by thugs.\n\n09:21.040 --> 09:23.040\nYeah, that's already the thing is there's already...\n\n09:23.040 --> 09:25.040\n40 people have died already.\n\n09:25.040 --> 09:27.040\n40 confirmed deaths all at once.\n\n09:27.040 --> 09:30.040\nNo, everyone's walking into traffic, but also there's already two stories\n\n09:30.040 --> 09:32.040\nthat are like top of the...\n\n09:32.040 --> 09:35.040\nUsually when you swipe too far left on your iPhone\n\n09:35.040 --> 09:41.040\nyou get four of the stories from the state-controlled media.\n\n09:41.040 --> 09:44.040\nThe top three are Donald Trump said something orange\n\n09:44.040 --> 09:46.040\nand the bottom one is Hillary Clinton.\n\n09:46.040 --> 09:50.040\nIs she too much or too little? This or that?\n\n09:50.040 --> 09:55.040\nBut one of them is like Pokemon Robbery Ring.\n\n09:55.040 --> 09:59.040\nThese guys lure you to a Pokemon place and they rob you.\n\n09:59.040 --> 10:01.040\nI think it's the yellows.\n\n10:01.040 --> 10:03.040\nIt's got to be the yellows.\n\n10:03.040 --> 10:07.040\nIt seems like the yellows are more likely to get you.\n\n10:07.040 --> 10:09.040\nBut do I have to learn all new things?\n\n10:09.040 --> 10:12.040\nBecause the Asian guy was vehemently yellow.\n\n10:12.040 --> 10:14.040\nSo do we have to connect those dots?\n\n10:14.040 --> 10:17.040\nAre the yellows like strategic and sly?\n\n10:17.040 --> 10:19.040\nOr are we switching it up?\n\n10:19.040 --> 10:21.040\nIs that the joy of it?\n\n10:21.040 --> 10:25.040\nThe yellows are like belligerent and they drop out of high school.\n\n10:25.040 --> 10:27.040\nYou vocal, sir, on the front row.\n\n10:27.040 --> 10:29.040\nYou're yellow, right?\n\n10:29.040 --> 10:31.040\nIs there a yellow identity?\n\n10:31.040 --> 10:33.040\nTeam Insight.\n\n10:33.040 --> 10:38.040\nElectric Thunderbird as our logo.\n\n10:38.040 --> 10:42.040\nIf that's not made up, that's really good.\n\n10:42.040 --> 10:44.040\nBut what do you think about the blues and the reds?\n\n10:44.040 --> 10:46.040\nDefine the blues from the yellows.\n\n10:46.040 --> 10:48.040\nThere are a bunch of fucking tools.\n\n10:48.040 --> 10:49.040\nA bunch of tools.\n\n10:49.040 --> 10:50.040\nReds.\n\n10:50.040 --> 10:52.040\nA bunch of fuckers.\n\n10:52.040 --> 10:54.040\nA bunch of fuckers.\n\n10:54.040 --> 11:00.040\nYou gotta pepper it with like, oh, you mean blue bros?\n\n11:00.040 --> 11:02.040\nLike, I think you go like, yeah, they...\n\n11:02.040 --> 11:06.040\nI go at 3am to get the elementary school near my house.\n\n11:06.040 --> 11:08.040\nOkay, now...\n\n11:08.040 --> 11:13.040\nYou go at 3am to the elementary school near your house.\n\n11:13.040 --> 11:14.040\nKeep talking.\n\n11:14.040 --> 11:15.040\nTo capture it.\n\n11:15.040 --> 11:22.040\nTo capture the elementary school when there's no children present.\n\n11:22.040 --> 11:27.040\nI know, you get three pokeballs when you walk by it.\n\n11:27.040 --> 11:29.040\nNo, no, no, this is a gym.\n\n11:29.040 --> 11:30.040\nOh.\n\n11:30.040 --> 11:32.040\nYou battle at the children's school.\n\n11:32.040 --> 11:34.040\nYeah, I battle at the gym and I take it for team yellow.\n\n11:34.040 --> 11:37.040\nBut you go there, you literally go there at 3am?\n\n11:37.040 --> 11:42.040\nYou are prowling a elementary school gymnasium at 3am.\n\n11:42.040 --> 11:45.040\nTo take control away from kids.\n\n11:45.040 --> 11:48.040\nTo capture the children's gym.\n\n11:48.040 --> 11:53.040\nTo take it from children when they're not there to defend themselves.\n\n11:53.040 --> 11:54.040\nExactly.\n\n11:54.040 --> 11:55.040\nChildren.\n\n11:55.040 --> 11:56.040\nChildren.\n\n11:56.040 --> 11:57.040\nElementary school.\n\n11:57.040 --> 12:01.040\nThen I go to sleep and when I wake up I go back to elementary school and those blue fuckers\n\n12:01.040 --> 12:02.040\nhave taken it.\n\n12:02.040 --> 12:06.040\nWell, yeah, because they're less weird.\n\n12:06.040 --> 12:08.040\nThat's fucking horrifying.\n\n12:08.040 --> 12:09.040\nWhy are...\n\n12:09.040 --> 12:11.040\nHow old are you?\n\n12:11.040 --> 12:12.040\n22.\n\n12:12.040 --> 12:13.040\n22.\n\n12:13.040 --> 12:17.040\nSo you got 22-year-olds literally physically outside the elementary school?\n\n12:17.040 --> 12:21.040\nYeah, they're setting up poke lures and hiding in the bushes.\n\n12:21.040 --> 12:25.040\nRuin through tall grass, waiting for kindergartners to work by.\n\n12:25.040 --> 12:30.040\nThe game is simply setting waypoints for a very rudimentary scavenger hunt.\n\n12:30.040 --> 12:36.040\nIt's sort of been used in jogging apps where you pick up apples by cross-training.\n\n12:36.040 --> 12:37.040\nYeah, Waze too.\n\n12:37.040 --> 12:39.040\nYeah, Waze is a...\n\n12:39.040 --> 12:42.040\nI'm not pissing at it, but I just think it's amazing that we've...\n\n12:42.040 --> 12:43.040\nNo, it's fine.\n\n12:43.040 --> 12:51.040\nI'm all into it, but I'm stepping back and going how funny it is that they made us leave our apartments\n\n12:51.040 --> 12:55.040\nand then the first thing that's happening is all these news stories about, like,\n\n12:55.040 --> 12:57.040\nyeah, and then someone got raped.\n\n12:57.040 --> 13:02.040\nHave you heard about the person that's using it to start a million-dollar business?\n\n13:02.040 --> 13:08.040\nThey call it Pokemoning, and it's getting people moving around the street corners.\n\n13:08.040 --> 13:13.040\nMy daughter started selling lemonade, and she said there was a Pokemon there,\n\n13:13.040 --> 13:15.040\nand someone came and talked to her.\n\n13:15.040 --> 13:17.040\nIt sounds like the Warriors were like,\n\n13:17.040 --> 13:22.040\nhey, yellows, you got to make it down to Coney Island before sunrise.\n\n13:22.040 --> 13:24.040\nCan you dig it?\n\n13:24.040 --> 13:26.040\nSuckers!\n\n13:26.040 --> 13:27.040\nOh, my God.\n\n13:27.040 --> 13:29.040\nHave you got some blues coming after you and some fucking...\n\n13:29.040 --> 13:32.040\nHave you guys seen the Warriors in a minute?\n\n13:32.040 --> 13:33.040\nYeah!\n\n13:33.040 --> 13:34.040\nIt's pretty...\n\n13:34.040 --> 13:35.040\nOh, yeah.\n\n13:35.040 --> 13:36.040\nSo it's a cult classic.\n\n13:36.040 --> 13:42.040\nNow, you guys are, this is like 200 creepily hip people here.\n\n13:42.040 --> 13:44.040\nYou mean good-looking.\n\n13:44.040 --> 13:45.040\nThey're good-looking.\n\n13:45.040 --> 13:47.040\nBut that's...\n\n13:47.040 --> 13:51.040\nWe're one guitar player away from a hot music video going on right now.\n\n13:51.040 --> 13:56.040\nYeah, the Shakespearean Herald, or what Joss Whedon, Cameron of the Woods,\n\n13:56.040 --> 13:58.040\nmaybe we call the Harbinger, the...\n\n13:58.040 --> 14:04.040\nin Warriors is a foxy black DJ lady,\n\n14:04.040 --> 14:06.040\nand all you ever see are her lips, I think.\n\n14:06.040 --> 14:11.040\nThey're like these glossy lips that they're like one centimeter from her.\n\n14:11.040 --> 14:12.040\nHello, children.\n\n14:12.040 --> 14:13.040\nHey, bloods.\n\n14:13.040 --> 14:18.040\nSo it seems like the Warriors are on the tiki-tok tonight,\n\n14:18.040 --> 14:21.040\ntrying to make it from Third to Main Street.\n\n14:21.040 --> 14:25.040\nGod bless you if you can get through the baseball boys.\n\n14:25.040 --> 14:27.040\nThe baseball furies.\n\n14:27.040 --> 14:30.040\nThey were basically on, I guess, an Odissian journey,\n\n14:30.040 --> 14:33.040\ngoing through the boroughs of New York\n\n14:33.040 --> 14:36.040\nand getting attacked by thematic gangs.\n\n14:36.040 --> 14:39.040\nBut I just think it's amazing that the lady...\n\n14:39.040 --> 14:43.040\nI don't know if we ever... I bet we never saw that Lady's Eyes.\n\n14:43.040 --> 14:47.040\nYou just saw these foxy 70s lips,\n\n14:47.040 --> 14:51.040\nand they shot that out in an hour.\n\n14:51.040 --> 14:53.040\nImagine them shooting that.\n\n14:53.040 --> 14:55.040\nOkay, Carly.\n\n14:55.040 --> 14:56.040\nPage three.\n\n14:56.040 --> 14:57.040\nOkay, all right.\n\n14:57.040 --> 14:58.040\nSo a series of them?\n\n14:58.040 --> 14:59.040\nYeah.\n\n14:59.040 --> 15:01.040\nWarriors, watch out.\n\n15:01.040 --> 15:03.040\nWarriors, watch out.\n\n15:03.040 --> 15:04.040\nCome on.\n\n15:04.040 --> 15:05.040\nFox it up.\n\n15:05.040 --> 15:08.040\nCome on, you're foxy.\n\n15:08.040 --> 15:10.040\nI think you have a different relationship with that movie\n\n15:10.040 --> 15:12.040\nthan I do.\n\n15:12.040 --> 15:15.040\nIn my childhood, that was on select TV.\n\n15:15.040 --> 15:17.040\nI'll explain it later.\n\n15:17.040 --> 15:20.040\nBut the Warriors, I saw it so many times with my brother\n\n15:20.040 --> 15:22.040\nthat one day my brother was like,\n\n15:22.040 --> 15:24.040\nwe should be one of these gangs.\n\n15:24.040 --> 15:25.040\nYeah, we should.\n\n15:25.040 --> 15:29.040\nAnd we were the baseball bat boys.\n\n15:29.040 --> 15:31.040\nThe baseball got to where we ran around the neighborhood\n\n15:31.040 --> 15:32.040\nwith baseball bats.\n\n15:32.040 --> 15:35.040\nHashtag white privilege means...\n\n15:35.040 --> 15:39.040\nSeeing a movie and deciding to run around your neighborhood\n\n15:39.040 --> 15:42.040\nwith a baseball bat, and then later on,\n\n15:42.040 --> 15:44.040\nthe story ends with me hanging out and doing a podcast\n\n15:44.040 --> 15:46.040\ninstead of some horrible thing.\n\n15:46.040 --> 15:48.040\nI looked back and I was like,\n\n15:48.040 --> 15:49.040\nwhat the fuck were we doing?\n\n15:49.040 --> 15:51.040\nWe were running around.\n\n15:51.040 --> 15:54.040\nWe saw a movie that said it was cool to run around\n\n15:54.040 --> 15:57.040\nwith baseball bats, got baseball bats from the garage,\n\n15:57.040 --> 16:00.040\nand emulated the characters by running around the neighborhood\n\n16:00.040 --> 16:02.040\nwith baseball bats in our hands,\n\n16:02.040 --> 16:04.040\nlike looking to beat people up.\n\n16:04.040 --> 16:06.040\nWe didn't do it, but we were like, in our heads,\n\n16:06.040 --> 16:08.040\nwe were like, we're a gang.\n\n16:08.040 --> 16:11.040\nWe're playing gang, gang.\n\n16:11.040 --> 16:14.040\nSo it was a simpler time, man.\n\n16:14.040 --> 16:16.040\nMatt Gorley and I, in eighth grade,\n\n16:16.040 --> 16:18.040\nwe were going to the Whitwood Mall on Whittier,\n\n16:18.040 --> 16:20.040\nand we had...\n\n16:20.040 --> 16:22.040\nDid they get a what-what for Whitwood Mall?\n\n16:22.040 --> 16:23.040\nFor real?\n\n16:23.040 --> 16:26.040\nOh, wow, sorry.\n\n16:26.040 --> 16:29.040\nTo get all your what-whats, go to Whitford.\n\n16:29.040 --> 16:31.040\nThe Warriors are...\n\n16:31.040 --> 16:34.040\nDon't get wasted, fools.\n\n16:34.040 --> 16:35.040\nBut we would go in there.\n\n16:35.040 --> 16:39.040\nMatt Gorley had replica guns,\n\n16:39.040 --> 16:42.040\nand we would go and put them in our belts under our shirts\n\n16:42.040 --> 16:44.040\nand walk through a mall,\n\n16:44.040 --> 16:47.040\nbecause we were playing James Bond,\n\n16:47.040 --> 16:50.040\nand we were walking through the mall with Walther P38s\n\n16:50.040 --> 16:52.040\nand our PPKs.\n\n16:52.040 --> 16:54.040\nWe had never had any intention of pulling them out\n\n16:54.040 --> 16:57.040\nor scaring anybody, but we really...\n\n16:57.040 --> 17:00.040\nThat was a horrible intention.\n\n17:00.040 --> 17:02.040\nI don't know if this tops that or not,\n\n17:02.040 --> 17:06.040\nbut here's a little fun time activity I did once.\n\n17:06.040 --> 17:08.040\nMe and my friend, Dan Ramstack,\n\n17:08.040 --> 17:09.040\nliving in our lower village...\n\n17:09.040 --> 17:11.040\nRamstack?\n\n17:11.040 --> 17:13.040\nI'll never get over that name, by the way.\n\n17:13.040 --> 17:16.040\nWe made a fake bomb once, and we...\n\n17:16.040 --> 17:18.040\nOh, I made real bombs?\n\n17:18.040 --> 17:20.040\nI made real pipe bombs.\n\n17:20.040 --> 17:22.040\nWe learned how to make a light blinker.\n\n17:22.040 --> 17:24.040\nWe made it purposely look like a bomb,\n\n17:24.040 --> 17:28.040\nlike in that we made it look weird and like dramatic.\n\n17:28.040 --> 17:29.040\nMacGyver with blinking lights.\n\n17:29.040 --> 17:31.040\nIt was just a good look.\n\n17:31.040 --> 17:36.040\nWe put it on a telephone pole and then ran away.\n\n17:36.040 --> 17:41.040\nBecause we were cognizant of the terror that we were causing.\n\n17:41.040 --> 17:44.040\nWe weren't like, oh, and everyone will...\n\n17:44.040 --> 17:47.040\nBecause this is right after the Archduke Ferdinand was killed\n\n17:47.040 --> 17:49.040\nthat set off World War I.\n\n17:49.040 --> 17:52.040\nYou were part of the Black Fist.\n\n17:52.040 --> 17:54.040\nI just remember the year was 1912.\n\n17:54.040 --> 17:55.040\nElectrical tape on the back of it,\n\n17:55.040 --> 17:58.040\nand the last thing that we did before the authorities got involved\n\n17:58.040 --> 18:04.040\nis we stuck it to the bottom of the screen door of my neighbor\n\n18:04.040 --> 18:06.040\nand rang the doorbell.\n\n18:06.040 --> 18:08.040\nSo when he came to the screen door,\n\n18:08.040 --> 18:15.040\nhe looked down and saw this weird mass of E.T. circuit boards\n\n18:15.040 --> 18:17.040\nand things with a blinking light on it.\n\n18:17.040 --> 18:23.040\nAnd he just called the cops,\n\n18:23.040 --> 18:29.040\nand then the crazy shit, like a bomb squad came.\n\n18:29.040 --> 18:34.040\nBut it was the 80s, but he must have called them and said,\n\n18:34.040 --> 18:37.040\nthere's a bomb on my door.\n\n18:37.040 --> 18:38.040\nI don't know.\n\n18:38.040 --> 18:39.040\nI don't know.\n\n18:39.040 --> 18:40.040\nThis story didn't go well.\n\n18:40.040 --> 18:41.040\nIt was a simpler time.\n\n18:41.040 --> 18:45.040\nWe did a thing that the richer kids, they had pools.\n\n18:45.040 --> 18:50.040\nWe would sneak into their backyards and take the pool acid.\n\n18:50.040 --> 18:52.040\nIt was like a heavy-duty acid that would clean the pool.\n\n18:52.040 --> 18:54.040\nAnd if you took a certain amount of that\n\n18:54.040 --> 18:59.040\nand you put it in like a two-liter, like 7-up or a Coke bottle\n\n18:59.040 --> 19:02.040\nand rolled up some tinfoil and put it in that,\n\n19:02.040 --> 19:07.040\nyou had about a minute and a half head start to get the fuck out of town.\n\n19:07.040 --> 19:10.040\nAnd we would put it in people's metal mailboxes.\n\n19:10.040 --> 19:15.040\nAnd the gas would expand that and blow up the mailbox.\n\n19:15.040 --> 19:18.040\nIt was an anti-personnel.\n\n19:18.040 --> 19:23.040\nAnd we would just drive around town blowing shit up.\n\n19:23.040 --> 19:25.040\nHere's another one you shouldn't do.\n\n19:25.040 --> 19:31.040\nIf you live on a hill, we would steal bowling balls from the bowling alley.\n\n19:31.040 --> 19:36.040\nAnd we'd go up to where the rich kids lived up in the high hills\n\n19:36.040 --> 19:39.040\nwith a long street that goes straight down.\n\n19:39.040 --> 19:42.040\nAnd you would take lighter fluid and you would cover the bowling ball\n\n19:42.040 --> 19:45.040\nand lighter fluid and fill the holes up with lighter fluid\n\n19:45.040 --> 19:49.040\nand light it on fire and just send it down the road.\n\n19:49.040 --> 19:54.040\nBecause when it got there, it was going through four walls on fire.\n\n19:54.040 --> 19:58.040\nI don't know how I ever didn't do federal time.\n\n19:58.040 --> 20:00.040\nI thought, well, just segue into that,\n\n20:00.040 --> 20:02.040\nnot to bring the show to a grinding hot,\n\n20:02.040 --> 20:05.040\nbut I just like, I did want to...\n\n20:05.040 --> 20:11.040\nLike, how much of that do you tie to this new word privilege?\n\n20:11.040 --> 20:13.040\nLike, do you look back on that and go,\n\n20:13.040 --> 20:18.040\noh, I had no idea that I was doing shit and getting away with it.\n\n20:18.040 --> 20:21.040\nBlack guy on the front row just ran out of here.\n\n20:21.040 --> 20:25.040\nI mean, he didn't just walk out.\n\n20:25.040 --> 20:28.040\nHe scurried.\n\n20:28.040 --> 20:33.040\nI was like, I come here to get away from this shit.\n\n20:33.040 --> 20:38.040\nI thought he'd talk about Pokemon.\n\n20:38.040 --> 20:40.040\nOh, no, certainly.\n\n20:40.040 --> 20:43.040\nThe hashtag, what is it, white privilege means?\n\n20:43.040 --> 20:44.040\nIs that what it said?\n\n20:44.040 --> 20:46.040\nThey just had a little swell.\n\n20:46.040 --> 20:49.040\nI clicked on it because I knew what I was going to see.\n\n20:49.040 --> 20:51.040\nI wanted to study this.\n\n20:51.040 --> 20:54.040\nIt's just like a little pastiche of like,\n\n20:54.040 --> 20:56.040\nI kind of feel like...\n\n20:56.040 --> 20:58.040\nYou look at it and you just shudder.\n\n20:58.040 --> 21:00.040\nYou're mostly shuddering, of course,\n\n21:00.040 --> 21:07.040\nwhen you're seeing the reflexive, reverse, defensive racism.\n\n21:07.040 --> 21:13.040\nIt's just like this weird outrage where it's like,\n\n21:13.040 --> 21:17.040\nit's like somebody going like,\n\n21:17.040 --> 21:19.040\nwhen no matter what you do,\n\n21:19.040 --> 21:23.040\nit's not good enough because you're white.\n\n21:23.040 --> 21:25.040\nWhen you're getting blamed for everything,\n\n21:25.040 --> 21:27.040\njust because people,\n\n21:27.040 --> 21:30.040\nbut they don't understand you, works real hard.\n\n21:30.040 --> 21:32.040\nAnd you're looking at it going like,\n\n21:32.040 --> 21:37.040\nI'm trying to...\n\n21:37.040 --> 21:41.040\nI'd say you look at those people and you go like,\n\n21:41.040 --> 21:45.040\nokay, so you're all off on an ice floe.\n\n21:45.040 --> 21:46.040\nYou're gone.\n\n21:46.040 --> 21:50.040\nYou're doing something that's like...\n\n21:50.040 --> 21:53.040\nWhat connection is ever going to happen there?\n\n21:53.040 --> 21:57.040\nBut then you look at other people that are kind of like...\n\n21:57.040 --> 21:59.040\nI'm not going to riff an example,\n\n21:59.040 --> 22:05.040\nbut I feel like there is like a substratta of people\n\n22:05.040 --> 22:10.040\nthat are technically responding to the concept of privilege\n\n22:10.040 --> 22:15.040\nwith a bewildered logical attack back where they're like,\n\n22:15.040 --> 22:18.040\nprivilege, there's like a substratta of them\n\n22:18.040 --> 22:23.040\nthat might be worth engaging just a little bit,\n\n22:23.040 --> 22:25.040\nthat that person is a potential ally\n\n22:25.040 --> 22:28.040\nbecause that person's bewilderment might actually...\n\n22:28.040 --> 22:33.040\nIt might actually just be based on genuine confusion and logic\n\n22:33.040 --> 22:36.040\nand lack of experience.\n\n22:36.040 --> 22:37.040\nWhat did you say?\n\n22:37.040 --> 22:38.040\nYou want him back.\n\n22:38.040 --> 22:39.040\nOh, yeah.\n\n22:39.040 --> 22:40.040\nNo, he's great.\n\n22:40.040 --> 22:41.040\nIt's Black Dave from Community, but...\n\n22:41.040 --> 22:42.040\nNo, I know.\n\n22:42.040 --> 22:43.040\nDarsan.\n\n22:43.040 --> 22:46.040\nAnyway, whatever.\n\n22:46.040 --> 22:48.040\nCan you try to riff an example?\n\n22:48.040 --> 22:50.040\nI'm not totally sure how you're talking about it.\n\n22:50.040 --> 22:51.040\nNo, I honestly can't.\n\n22:51.040 --> 22:52.040\nI really can't.\n\n22:52.040 --> 22:55.040\nBecause it wasn't like I saw one thing and I was like,\n\n22:55.040 --> 22:56.040\noh, I'm identifying that.\n\n22:56.040 --> 22:58.040\nI was more like, I was feeling...\n\n22:58.040 --> 23:00.040\nI was looking at this oil and water\n\n23:00.040 --> 23:02.040\nor what is there something in between.\n\n23:02.040 --> 23:07.040\nWhen a hashtag like white privilege means starts trending,\n\n23:07.040 --> 23:15.040\nyou know that it's going to be a bug zapper for beautiful creatures\n\n23:15.040 --> 23:18.040\nand also horrible, disgusting ones.\n\n23:18.040 --> 23:20.040\nIt's just going to attract.\n\n23:20.040 --> 23:26.040\nI was just trying to identify...\n\n23:26.040 --> 23:28.040\nThere was the proper use of it,\n\n23:28.040 --> 23:31.040\nand then there was all these different bubbles coming off,\n\n23:31.040 --> 23:33.040\nand I was trying to identify them,\n\n23:33.040 --> 23:36.040\nand I was wondering, are we going to keep...\n\n23:36.040 --> 23:40.040\nI read an essay in, I think, New York Times.\n\n23:40.040 --> 23:42.040\nIt was a guy who wrote a thing.\n\n23:42.040 --> 23:46.040\nI think the headline was a week from hell.\n\n23:46.040 --> 23:52.040\nThe theme of that just being like...\n\n23:52.040 --> 23:55.040\nI was kind of talking about this the previous episode\n\n23:55.040 --> 23:58.040\nbefore it became extra topical,\n\n23:58.040 --> 24:02.040\nbut the idea of like, is this shit going to hit a point\n\n24:02.040 --> 24:05.040\nwhere we start to...\n\n24:05.040 --> 24:08.040\nIt actually becomes...\n\n24:08.040 --> 24:11.040\nWe have to deal with it in a sense that it's like smart people\n\n24:11.040 --> 24:14.040\nactually start like actually going like,\n\n24:14.040 --> 24:17.040\nokay, we have to learn to deal with dumb people.\n\n24:17.040 --> 24:20.040\nIt's not...\n\n24:20.040 --> 24:22.040\nYou don't deal with them by going like,\n\n24:22.040 --> 24:24.040\nyou're so dumb,\n\n24:24.040 --> 24:28.040\nyou stick your finger into that wall of Jell-O\n\n24:28.040 --> 24:30.040\nthat is dumb people,\n\n24:30.040 --> 24:35.040\nand your quarter of your identity is now inside dumb people.\n\n24:35.040 --> 24:38.040\nYou're trying to prove that they're dumb,\n\n24:38.040 --> 24:42.040\nand it's like you make yourself dumb by trying to prove that.\n\n24:42.040 --> 24:45.040\nLike a genuine elitist...\n\n24:45.040 --> 24:48.040\nTheir worst nightmare is that there's like a new world order\n\n24:48.040 --> 24:51.040\nforming around them because some people think they know better than them.\n\n24:51.040 --> 24:54.040\nI just like sometimes maybe split the diff and go like,\n\n24:54.040 --> 24:56.040\nwhat if we were better than them?\n\n24:56.040 --> 25:00.040\nThe answer is if you genuinely felt that way,\n\n25:00.040 --> 25:04.040\nI think you'd find yourself treating them politely.\n\n25:04.040 --> 25:06.040\nYou might be a redneck.\n\n25:06.040 --> 25:10.040\nBecause I don't imagine that guys in white lab coats\n\n25:10.040 --> 25:12.040\nand they're trying to figure out if deodorant\n\n25:12.040 --> 25:14.040\ngives you farts for some corporation\n\n25:14.040 --> 25:16.040\nand they have to kill 10,000 rats to do it.\n\n25:16.040 --> 25:18.040\nI don't think they'd walk up to each cage,\n\n25:18.040 --> 25:20.040\npull the rat out, and go like,\n\n25:20.040 --> 25:23.040\nyou piece of shit, you fucker, don't look at me!\n\n25:23.040 --> 25:27.040\nI think they go, nice baby, baby, poody, poody,\n\n25:27.040 --> 25:31.040\nand they fucking run them over a deli slicer.\n\n25:31.040 --> 25:33.040\nBecause I think that they...\n\n25:33.040 --> 25:37.040\nBecause they're like, well, there's no point to engaging this motherfucker.\n\n25:37.040 --> 25:41.040\nSo if you feel that way about ignorant people,\n\n25:41.040 --> 25:44.040\nthe evolution might be that we start to go,\n\n25:44.040 --> 25:46.040\nwait, they're actually beyond hope.\n\n25:46.040 --> 25:48.040\nThey don't think for themselves.\n\n25:48.040 --> 25:52.040\nNo real point in pointing your finger in their face\n\n25:52.040 --> 25:54.040\nand spinning at them because they're...\n\n25:54.040 --> 25:57.040\nYou have intellectual people on both sides of the spectrum\n\n25:57.040 --> 26:01.040\nof politics, to the far extremes of politics\n\n26:01.040 --> 26:03.040\nthat are quite intelligent people\n\n26:03.040 --> 26:06.040\nwho believe completely antithetical things to each other.\n\n26:06.040 --> 26:08.040\nWho's to say which is right?\n\n26:08.040 --> 26:10.040\nAnd also the people that fall in the middle,\n\n26:10.040 --> 26:13.040\nthese mice that you want to run through a deli slicer,\n\n26:13.040 --> 26:16.040\nthey're just being pulled in two completely different directions\n\n26:16.040 --> 26:18.040\nby a bunch of intellectual weirdos.\n\n26:18.040 --> 26:21.040\nWho's right and who's wrong on that side?\n\n26:21.040 --> 26:24.040\nI've talked to people that...\n\n26:24.040 --> 26:28.040\nYou and I both hate politics, I think, by and large,\n\n26:28.040 --> 26:30.040\nbut I've talked to really smart conservatives,\n\n26:30.040 --> 26:32.040\nreally, really intellectual people\n\n26:32.040 --> 26:35.040\nwho believe things that I just can't really dig at all.\n\n26:35.040 --> 26:37.040\nBut they've thought about it, they've given a lot of thought,\n\n26:37.040 --> 26:40.040\nand they're compassionate people and smart people.\n\n26:40.040 --> 26:42.040\nI just don't understand.\n\n26:42.040 --> 26:45.040\nIt's...\n\n26:45.040 --> 26:48.040\nTalking to somebody who's just a Trump supporter,\n\n26:48.040 --> 26:51.040\nit's like they're smart people that are Trump supporters.\n\n26:51.040 --> 26:53.040\nI can't believe that.\n\n26:53.040 --> 26:55.040\nThere are. They're fucking are.\n\n26:55.040 --> 26:56.040\nThey really are.\n\n26:56.040 --> 26:58.040\nBecause they're going to vote for the person\n\n26:58.040 --> 27:00.040\nthat's going to vote and run against Hillary,\n\n27:00.040 --> 27:02.040\nand they've given it a lot of great thought.\n\n27:02.040 --> 27:04.040\nI think a lot of people wish they had another candidate,\n\n27:04.040 --> 27:06.040\nin both sides.\n\n27:06.040 --> 27:08.040\nIt's always the lesser of two evil.\n\n27:08.040 --> 27:10.040\nYeah, but that's a horrible thing, isn't it?\n\n27:10.040 --> 27:12.040\nIt's the worst thing in the world.\n\n27:12.040 --> 27:14.040\nI think it's a sad admission that...\n\n27:14.040 --> 27:16.040\nBut this word smart, though, you're saying...\n\n27:16.040 --> 27:18.040\nYou're talking about what you're saying...\n\n27:18.040 --> 27:22.040\nThere's people who are Trump supporters,\n\n27:22.040 --> 27:26.040\nwho are so smart that they see the benefit\n\n27:26.040 --> 27:28.040\nin a long-term weird Illuminati game\n\n27:28.040 --> 27:32.040\nof having a crazy, orange Nazi be president for four years.\n\n27:32.040 --> 27:36.040\nOr a Zen philosophy where, well, if the pillars crumble,\n\n27:36.040 --> 27:38.040\nthen there will be more floor space.\n\n27:38.040 --> 27:41.040\nI've talked a very smart, thoughtful, compassionate people\n\n27:41.040 --> 27:43.040\nwho believe things that are weirder than Trump.\n\n27:43.040 --> 27:47.040\nPeople have their own ideologies based on\n\n27:47.040 --> 27:49.040\nall sorts of different things.\n\n27:49.040 --> 27:52.040\nYeah, but I support people who say,\n\n27:52.040 --> 27:54.040\nI believe the world is still flat.\n\n27:54.040 --> 27:56.040\nI believe that we never landed on the moon.\n\n27:56.040 --> 27:58.040\nI think Bigfoot's out there, all that stuff.\n\n27:58.040 --> 28:02.040\nI wouldn't bully those people and go,\n\n28:02.040 --> 28:04.040\nyeah, but because I don't believe\n\n28:04.040 --> 28:07.040\nthat those beliefs come from dishonesty.\n\n28:07.040 --> 28:09.040\nBut I don't think that...\n\n28:09.040 --> 28:13.040\nIf a political candidate is standing in front of a podium\n\n28:13.040 --> 28:15.040\nand saying a sentence that you would never say\n\n28:15.040 --> 28:17.040\nat a cocktail party ever in any form,\n\n28:17.040 --> 28:19.040\nno matter what strata you of cocktail party were at,\n\n28:19.040 --> 28:21.040\nor any social environment,\n\n28:21.040 --> 28:24.040\nany environment really other than behind a podium,\n\n28:24.040 --> 28:29.040\nit's some weird, strange statement about the state of the world\n\n28:29.040 --> 28:31.040\nand then everyone applauds and it's all this stuff.\n\n28:31.040 --> 28:34.040\nThere's a certain level where you're like,\n\n28:34.040 --> 28:36.040\nthat's not a philosophy.\n\n28:36.040 --> 28:38.040\nThis is a person in an act of sedition.\n\n28:38.040 --> 28:43.040\nThis is a person who's trying to take advantage of ignorance\n\n28:43.040 --> 28:46.040\nand vulnerability and fear.\n\n28:46.040 --> 28:50.040\nThey're just rolling into it like a low,\n\n28:50.040 --> 28:54.040\nlike a liquidy primal viscous infection.\n\n28:54.040 --> 29:00.040\nI think both sides are actively trying to seduce ignorance equally.\n\n29:00.040 --> 29:03.040\nFor sure, I'm definitely not doing no tap dance\n\n29:03.040 --> 29:05.040\nfor no alternative to Donald Trump.\n\n29:05.040 --> 29:08.040\nI'll bore the hell out of you with why...\n\n29:08.040 --> 29:11.040\nYeah, you won't walk away from me knowing who to vote for.\n\n29:11.040 --> 29:13.040\nIntellectualism is out the window\n\n29:13.040 --> 29:17.040\nbecause proper intellectual discourse is not even...\n\n29:17.040 --> 29:21.040\nNot only is it not allowed, it's just not a thing.\n\n29:21.040 --> 29:24.040\nI may have used self-defeating language\n\n29:24.040 --> 29:27.040\nwhen I was talking about smart people.\n\n29:27.040 --> 29:30.040\nWhat if we were to say, for instance, though,\n\n29:30.040 --> 29:32.040\nlike if I were to...\n\n29:32.040 --> 29:39.040\nI mean, don't you think that it's possible\n\n29:39.040 --> 29:48.040\nthat the smarter you get, the less you want other people to die?\n\n29:48.040 --> 29:50.040\nNo, but that...\n\n29:50.040 --> 29:53.040\nNow you're conjuring an image of a guy that's like a genius,\n\n29:53.040 --> 29:56.040\nso he took over the railroads and then he's got a monopoly\n\n29:56.040 --> 29:58.040\nover the newspapers and he owns Zagnut\n\n29:58.040 --> 29:59.040\nand he's sitting in a fucking roundhouse\n\n29:59.040 --> 30:02.040\ndying of weird cancer that you can only get\n\n30:02.040 --> 30:05.040\nby using Vietnamese for human chess.\n\n30:05.040 --> 30:09.040\nI don't mean like the...\n\n30:09.040 --> 30:12.040\nWhat I mean is, like, forget about what we know\n\n30:12.040 --> 30:14.040\nabout what happens to smart people\n\n30:14.040 --> 30:16.040\nor active people or ambitious people\n\n30:16.040 --> 30:19.040\nand just wipe that board clean and think as primates.\n\n30:19.040 --> 30:24.040\nLike, don't you think...\n\n30:24.040 --> 30:29.040\nI'm gonna pitch this and prove me wrong,\n\n30:29.040 --> 30:36.040\nbut that any...\n\n30:36.040 --> 30:38.040\nAny worldview...\n\n30:38.040 --> 30:39.040\nDance it out, dance it out.\n\n30:39.040 --> 30:41.040\nThere's probably a huge...\n\n30:41.040 --> 30:44.040\nLike, definitely a hugely evolved,\n\n30:44.040 --> 30:46.040\nthe maximum evolved worldview\n\n30:46.040 --> 30:52.040\nwould definitely accept the need for horrible things.\n\n30:52.040 --> 30:56.040\nLike, the higher, the closer to like fucking crazy\n\n30:56.040 --> 30:58.040\ncosmic objectivity you get,\n\n30:58.040 --> 31:02.040\nI think the more and more you'll become kind of\n\n31:02.040 --> 31:04.040\nwhat could be called from a distance a nihilist.\n\n31:04.040 --> 31:09.040\nSo, but don't you think that...\n\n31:09.040 --> 31:11.040\nThat's accepting.\n\n31:11.040 --> 31:14.040\nThat's saying like, the cosmos is a bitch.\n\n31:14.040 --> 31:16.040\nLike, people live and people die.\n\n31:16.040 --> 31:17.040\nIt's fucked up.\n\n31:17.040 --> 31:20.040\nLike, good things don't happen to good people, etc.\n\n31:20.040 --> 31:26.040\nBut I'm talking about people who's like cosmologies\n\n31:26.040 --> 31:32.040\nare like, necessitate people dying.\n\n31:32.040 --> 31:36.040\nLike, don't you think those people are dumber?\n\n31:36.040 --> 31:38.040\nI think a lot of them go to Yale.\n\n31:38.040 --> 31:41.040\nI think a lot of those people are presidents.\n\n31:41.040 --> 31:44.040\nI'm sure a lot of them have 300 IQs,\n\n31:44.040 --> 31:48.040\nbut don't you think those people are dumber?\n\n31:48.040 --> 31:49.040\nDon't you call them dumber?\n\n31:49.040 --> 31:53.040\nWell, empathy is like a skill, it's like an attribute.\n\n31:53.040 --> 31:54.040\nIt's like a muscle.\n\n31:54.040 --> 31:56.040\nSome people are better than others,\n\n31:56.040 --> 31:58.040\nand that makes them better in that regard.\n\n31:58.040 --> 32:00.040\nBut empathy is when...\n\n32:00.040 --> 32:04.040\nThe concept of someone suffering over here,\n\n32:04.040 --> 32:06.040\nlike, you might pick up on it or not.\n\n32:06.040 --> 32:08.040\nThe lack of empathy would be...\n\n32:08.040 --> 32:11.040\nThe worst-case scenario would be someone drowning over here,\n\n32:11.040 --> 32:14.040\nand you don't think you have to save them.\n\n32:14.040 --> 32:15.040\nThat's like...\n\n32:15.040 --> 32:19.040\nI'm talking about the people who think that you need to have war.\n\n32:19.040 --> 32:23.040\nPeople who think that people need to be killed, basically.\n\n32:23.040 --> 32:25.040\nWhat about executives at Fillmore's?\n\n32:25.040 --> 32:27.040\nWell, I...\n\n32:27.040 --> 32:31.040\nThat's negligence.\n\n32:31.040 --> 32:34.040\nHe said, what about executives at a tobacco company or something?\n\n32:34.040 --> 32:36.040\nWhat about Vin Diesel?\n\n32:36.040 --> 32:38.040\nThat's what we all do to all of each other.\n\n32:38.040 --> 32:40.040\nWhat about Vin Diesel?\n\n32:40.040 --> 32:44.040\nI was very lucky to go and do a few USO tours,\n\n32:44.040 --> 32:48.040\nlike travel around the desert,\n\n32:48.040 --> 32:50.040\nperform for troops,\n\n32:50.040 --> 32:52.040\nand if you perform for the Big Red One,\n\n32:52.040 --> 32:55.040\nthese are kids that are poor kids.\n\n32:55.040 --> 32:59.040\nThey're tip of the spear, first ones in every battle\n\n32:59.040 --> 33:02.040\nthat we've probably ever fought since the very beginning.\n\n33:02.040 --> 33:05.040\nAnd if you talk to them about killing,\n\n33:05.040 --> 33:06.040\nthey're all for it.\n\n33:06.040 --> 33:08.040\nIt's like, let's go get them, blood and guts, they love it.\n\n33:08.040 --> 33:12.040\nAnd then you talk to people that fly billion-dollar systems\n\n33:12.040 --> 33:16.040\nlike the B2 Bomber or our big spy plans.\n\n33:16.040 --> 33:18.040\nThese are people that have higher educations,\n\n33:18.040 --> 33:20.040\nand they've read poetry,\n\n33:20.040 --> 33:23.040\nand they know Shakespeare,\n\n33:23.040 --> 33:26.040\nand they've read Voltaire, and they know music,\n\n33:26.040 --> 33:29.040\nand to an extent that these other kids probably don't,\n\n33:29.040 --> 33:31.040\nthey've never been exposed to it.\n\n33:31.040 --> 33:34.040\nTheir take on death is very different in my conversations with them.\n\n33:34.040 --> 33:36.040\nThey're not happy about killing people.\n\n33:36.040 --> 33:37.040\nThey don't want to.\n\n33:37.040 --> 33:39.040\nThey hope they never have to.\n\n33:39.040 --> 33:41.040\nAnd I think there is an educational divide there,\n\n33:41.040 --> 33:44.040\nbut you can talk to people that are way smarter\n\n33:44.040 --> 33:46.040\nand way more educated than all of those people,\n\n33:46.040 --> 33:48.040\nand they will also say that death is a necessity,\n\n33:48.040 --> 33:51.040\nor that death is an atrocity no matter what.\n\n33:51.040 --> 33:53.040\nWell, I think I'd stop you,\n\n33:53.040 --> 33:56.040\ngo much more provincial and go like,\n\n33:56.040 --> 33:58.040\nyeah, the guys with the bayonets,\n\n33:58.040 --> 34:02.040\nthey don't let them in the fucking airplanes.\n\n34:02.040 --> 34:05.040\nYou just said it.\n\n34:05.040 --> 34:09.040\nThose guys might have 200 IQs, but I'm saying like...\n\n34:09.040 --> 34:11.040\nThose guys that are way richer and smarter\n\n34:11.040 --> 34:13.040\nand have bigger and more access to education\n\n34:13.040 --> 34:16.040\nthan the guys that fly the bombs.\n\n34:16.040 --> 34:19.040\nThere are these expensive planes around\n\n34:19.040 --> 34:22.040\nthat would rather kill people than the people flying those planes.\n\n34:22.040 --> 34:24.040\nI talked to a bomber, I was in line at a PX,\n\n34:24.040 --> 34:26.040\nlike the general store at a base,\n\n34:26.040 --> 34:28.040\nand I said, what do you do?\n\n34:28.040 --> 34:30.040\nAnd he goes, I'm a bomber.\n\n34:30.040 --> 34:32.040\nPhysically, actually, what do you do?\n\n34:32.040 --> 34:34.040\nAnd he goes, I'm the guy that bombs.\n\n34:34.040 --> 34:35.040\nI hit the button.\n\n34:35.040 --> 34:37.040\nI'm looking through the viewfinder,\n\n34:37.040 --> 34:39.040\nand it's like, what do you see?\n\n34:39.040 --> 34:41.040\nAnd the viewfinder goes, I see people running.\n\n34:41.040 --> 34:43.040\nAnd he got real bummed out.\n\n34:43.040 --> 34:45.040\nHe literally had a snickers in his hand,\n\n34:45.040 --> 34:48.040\nand I was getting the Gatorade or whatever in the morning.\n\n34:48.040 --> 34:50.040\nAnd I said, who are those people?\n\n34:50.040 --> 34:52.040\nAnd he goes, not our targets.\n\n34:52.040 --> 34:53.040\nI go, who are those people?\n\n34:53.040 --> 34:55.040\nAnd he goes, women and children.\n\n34:55.040 --> 34:56.040\nI go, where are your targets?\n\n34:56.040 --> 34:58.040\nAnd he goes, they're underground.\n\n34:58.040 --> 34:59.040\nI said, do those people that you see\n\n34:59.040 --> 35:01.040\nand the viewfinder running have a chance?\n\n35:01.040 --> 35:02.040\nAnd he goes, no, they're dead.\n\n35:02.040 --> 35:04.040\nI go, how do you deal with that?\n\n35:04.040 --> 35:07.040\nAnd he goes, first of all, you don't.\n\n35:07.040 --> 35:09.040\nAnd second, the only thing I can take away\n\n35:09.040 --> 35:11.040\nis that I'm five miles away when it happens.\n\n35:11.040 --> 35:13.040\nI go, how do you know if you got your target?\n\n35:13.040 --> 35:15.040\nAnd he goes, not my department.\n\n35:15.040 --> 35:19.040\nAnd this is a guy who is very, very, very smart\n\n35:19.040 --> 35:21.040\nbecause they don't let you fly that thing.\n\n35:21.040 --> 35:24.040\nSo your point is that I'm implying\n\n35:24.040 --> 35:28.040\nthat the smarter you get the less brainwashed\n\n35:28.040 --> 35:30.040\nor murderous you get.\n\n35:30.040 --> 35:34.040\nAnd your point is that smart people\n\n35:34.040 --> 35:37.040\ncan be fucking drones too.\n\n35:37.040 --> 35:41.040\nSo I guess if we're both right, maybe we need to measure.\n\n35:41.040 --> 35:44.040\nI'm like, look, my point is there's...\n\n35:44.040 --> 35:45.040\nI think if you have a compassion,\n\n35:45.040 --> 35:46.040\nthat's all what Spencer said.\n\n35:46.040 --> 35:49.040\nI think if you can measure people besides something,\n\n35:49.040 --> 35:51.040\nyou can pick any variable you want\n\n35:51.040 --> 35:54.040\nto sort a list of eight billion people.\n\n35:54.040 --> 35:57.040\nAnd the columns that we create on that list,\n\n35:57.040 --> 35:59.040\nthere might be some that we haven't invented yet.\n\n35:59.040 --> 36:01.040\nThere's still data there.\n\n36:01.040 --> 36:05.040\nWe know that you can sort eight billion people by age,\n\n36:05.040 --> 36:09.040\ngender, race, income, nation, city,\n\n36:09.040 --> 36:13.040\npeople who have experienced violence,\n\n36:13.040 --> 36:15.040\npeople who haven't.\n\n36:15.040 --> 36:18.040\nThere's all these columns, but what if there's a column\n\n36:18.040 --> 36:20.040\nthat we haven't sorted people by yet?\n\n36:20.040 --> 36:24.040\nWhat if no IQ test or anything has been able to detect\n\n36:24.040 --> 36:29.040\na class of people, a strata of people\n\n36:29.040 --> 36:34.040\nwho continually get frustrated by the world around them\n\n36:34.040 --> 36:36.040\nbecause nobody else seems to get it.\n\n36:36.040 --> 36:40.040\nAnd we're calling to each other through the jello\n\n36:40.040 --> 36:42.040\nof the internet and going like,\n\n36:42.040 --> 36:44.040\ndoes anybody else understand what's going on here?\n\n36:44.040 --> 36:46.040\nIsn't it easy enough to just understand\n\n36:46.040 --> 36:49.040\nthat if you hurt somebody, that's worse than if you don't.\n\n36:49.040 --> 36:51.040\nAnd we can have all these conversations\n\n36:51.040 --> 36:53.040\nabout when that's necessary later.\n\n36:53.040 --> 36:55.040\nThose can all be built on that machine language.\n\n36:55.040 --> 36:57.040\nInstead of...\n\n36:57.040 --> 36:59.040\nWe're seeing that right now.\n\n36:59.040 --> 37:00.040\nWe're seeing these eruptions.\n\n37:00.040 --> 37:04.040\nAnd then we're also seeing these whales of frustration\n\n37:04.040 --> 37:05.040\nthat are the most distressing\n\n37:05.040 --> 37:09.040\nbecause it's watching intelligent people,\n\n37:09.040 --> 37:12.040\npeople who are not typically reactive,\n\n37:12.040 --> 37:18.040\nreactionary, people who yesterday were able to see\n\n37:18.040 --> 37:24.040\nmore variance in chaos and have it be part of their life,\n\n37:24.040 --> 37:30.040\nbeing forced into a dumb fucking cereal box contest.\n\n37:30.040 --> 37:33.040\nThat's the tragedy.\n\n37:33.040 --> 37:35.040\nEvery time something huge happens,\n\n37:35.040 --> 37:38.040\nthe pit of your stomach goes like,\n\n37:38.040 --> 37:41.040\nthese fucking morons, they're not going to handle this well.\n\n37:41.040 --> 37:46.040\nAnd that's not going to make any of us any smarter either.\n\n37:46.040 --> 37:50.040\nMan, if we could get a break from all this shit\n\n37:50.040 --> 37:52.040\nthat makes everybody react all the time,\n\n37:52.040 --> 37:56.040\nit's like living in a planet with 7 billion fucking dogs\n\n37:56.040 --> 37:58.040\nthat don't like fireworks.\n\n37:58.040 --> 38:02.040\nAnd sometimes you see another human across the room,\n\n38:02.040 --> 38:05.040\nand it's like, I'm sorry, man.\n\n38:05.040 --> 38:07.040\nWas it sympathy or compassion?\n\n38:07.040 --> 38:08.040\nWhat did you say?\n\n38:08.040 --> 38:09.040\nEmpathy.\n\n38:09.040 --> 38:11.040\nI think that's what it is.\n\n38:11.040 --> 38:16.040\nBut listen, as soon as I hear those words,\n\n38:16.040 --> 38:20.040\nthose become problematic because Steve Silberman\n\n38:20.040 --> 38:22.040\nwas up here talking about neurodiversity.\n\n38:22.040 --> 38:26.040\nAnd the truth is, there's a huge spinal cord\n\n38:26.040 --> 38:29.040\ngoing through the history of modern humans\n\n38:29.040 --> 38:32.040\nthat the spinal cord is this hugely functional,\n\n38:32.040 --> 38:36.040\nnot typically a screaming empathy,\n\n38:36.040 --> 38:39.040\nkind of like sub-community of people\n\n38:39.040 --> 38:43.040\nwho needed the technology that they created around them\n\n38:43.040 --> 38:47.040\nthat we all now use to reduce our empathy\n\n38:47.040 --> 38:48.040\nand do fucked up shit.\n\n38:48.040 --> 38:53.040\nBut they created it because they profited from it\n\n38:53.040 --> 38:55.040\nin a way that they couldn't on the playground.\n\n38:55.040 --> 38:57.040\nYou know, having people hit them with sticks\n\n38:57.040 --> 39:00.040\nis because they didn't know how to say the right things.\n\n39:00.040 --> 39:02.040\nSo empathy isn't...\n\n39:02.040 --> 39:05.040\nWhen people don't appear to feel things,\n\n39:05.040 --> 39:08.040\nsometimes those people are thinking,\n\n39:08.040 --> 39:10.040\nand I guess that's...\n\n39:10.040 --> 39:14.040\nIt's when you see smart people get drawn into these fucking\n\n39:14.040 --> 39:16.040\nmudfights in comment sections,\n\n39:16.040 --> 39:19.040\nand you can tell that they're a chemistry teacher or something,\n\n39:19.040 --> 39:22.040\nand it's like, why do you have opinions about this shit?\n\n39:22.040 --> 39:24.040\nYou're smart.\n\n39:24.040 --> 39:27.040\nAnd part of the reason is because those people think that,\n\n39:27.040 --> 39:31.040\nas far as interacting with people,\n\n39:31.040 --> 39:35.040\nthat they're supposed to do it through different channels.\n\n39:35.040 --> 39:38.040\nAnyways, I think my point is,\n\n39:38.040 --> 39:42.040\nwe have to figure out how to tell the morons\n\n39:42.040 --> 39:44.040\nfrom the non-morons,\n\n39:44.040 --> 39:47.040\nand we have to actually be racist about detecting morons\n\n39:47.040 --> 39:51.040\nand go, that's the only actual dichotomy.\n\n39:51.040 --> 39:54.040\nLet's be xenophobic about the morons\n\n39:54.040 --> 39:56.040\nto the point where we infantilize them,\n\n39:56.040 --> 39:58.040\nas we did for instance.\n\n39:58.040 --> 40:00.040\nIsn't that what Joseph Goebbels was saying too?\n\n40:00.040 --> 40:03.040\nYes, it's a strategy you use\n\n40:03.040 --> 40:07.040\nwhen you want to overpower and use a population\n\n40:07.040 --> 40:10.040\ninstead of informing them and engaging them.\n\n40:10.040 --> 40:12.040\nYes, that's what I'm advocating.\n\n40:12.040 --> 40:16.040\nI'm saying fight fire with fire.\n\n40:16.040 --> 40:18.040\nI'm saying,\n\n40:18.040 --> 40:21.040\nwe have to identify our, quote unquote, race.\n\n40:21.040 --> 40:24.040\nWe have to identify our color,\n\n40:24.040 --> 40:27.040\nand it's not going to be a yellow Pokemon.\n\n40:27.040 --> 40:31.040\nBringing up the neuro-tribe thing is very interesting\n\n40:31.040 --> 40:34.040\nbecause people empathize differently,\n\n40:34.040 --> 40:37.040\nand some people, their connection with other human beings\n\n40:37.040 --> 40:39.040\nis very different than what I think it ought to be,\n\n40:39.040 --> 40:41.040\nor what mine is.\n\n40:41.040 --> 40:43.040\nEverybody has different amounts of eye contact\n\n40:43.040 --> 40:45.040\nthey want to make with you.\n\n40:45.040 --> 40:47.040\nEverybody sounds different when they're nervous,\n\n40:47.040 --> 40:51.040\neverybody reacts to cockiness and insecurity differently.\n\n40:51.040 --> 40:55.040\nIt's a mishmash of some house they grew up in,\n\n40:55.040 --> 40:58.040\nsome block they grew up on,\n\n40:58.040 --> 41:01.040\nand the huge, giant, number eight scoop\n\n41:01.040 --> 41:04.040\nof fucking uncontrollable genetics\n\n41:04.040 --> 41:06.040\nthat are so much less controllable\n\n41:06.040 --> 41:08.040\nthan we'd ever love to think.\n\n41:08.040 --> 41:11.040\nBut just like, everybody's like,\n\n41:11.040 --> 41:14.040\nuntil you get somebody to actually say,\n\n41:14.040 --> 41:17.040\nI don't like you, don't assume they don't like you,\n\n41:17.040 --> 41:19.040\nwe need to move forward into a culture\n\n41:19.040 --> 41:21.040\nwhere there's like checks and balances there,\n\n41:21.040 --> 41:23.040\nwhere you can go like, oh man,\n\n41:23.040 --> 41:25.040\nthere's so much shit happening,\n\n41:25.040 --> 41:27.040\nwhere we project onto people,\n\n41:27.040 --> 41:29.040\nwe go like, oh, these fucking assholes.\n\n41:29.040 --> 41:31.040\nWhen you read one of these comments\n\n41:31.040 --> 41:33.040\nunder one of these things,\n\n41:33.040 --> 41:36.040\nit's like you stick like a scalpel\n\n41:36.040 --> 41:38.040\ninto that fucking owl pellet\n\n41:38.040 --> 41:41.040\nand pry it apart and breathe any air into it,\n\n41:41.040 --> 41:44.040\nor put it in liquid, it turns into a fucking\n\n41:44.040 --> 41:47.040\ncrazy, weird triple squirrel.\n\n41:47.040 --> 41:50.040\nIt's like there's a history of what this owl ate,\n\n41:50.040 --> 41:53.040\nit's like a fucking like, what the fuck is this?\n\n41:53.040 --> 41:57.040\nWhat expertise are you bringing to bear here?\n\n41:57.040 --> 42:00.040\nHow is anybody not being that honest about\n\n42:00.040 --> 42:03.040\nwhat they're actually feeling and what they're fearing?\n\n42:03.040 --> 42:06.040\nThey're so close to just saying they're afraid,\n\n42:06.040 --> 42:09.040\nbut it comes out, it completely inverted.\n\n42:09.040 --> 42:12.040\nThe way that we say I'm afraid of you\n\n42:12.040 --> 42:15.040\nis I am not afraid of you,\n\n42:15.040 --> 42:18.040\nand you would like me to be afraid of you,\n\n42:18.040 --> 42:21.040\nbut I can beat you up, so fuck you.\n\n42:21.040 --> 42:24.040\nWe say everything but I'm afraid of you,\n\n42:24.040 --> 42:27.040\nwhich is just like, we can start to a conversation.\n\n42:27.040 --> 42:29.040\nIf you could isolate all these morons,\n\n42:29.040 --> 42:31.040\nwhat would you say to them and what would you do with them?\n\n42:31.040 --> 42:33.040\nI don't know, I'd fucking, Jeff,\n\n42:33.040 --> 42:35.040\nright now I would walk out,\n\n42:35.040 --> 42:38.040\nclose the freezer door and flip a fucking jigsaw switch\n\n42:38.040 --> 42:41.040\nthat's cued a video of me going,\n\n42:41.040 --> 42:45.040\n85% of America, you don't know me,\n\n42:45.040 --> 42:47.040\nbut I certainly know you.\n\n42:47.040 --> 42:51.040\nFor years you have fucking thought things,\n\n42:51.040 --> 42:53.040\ntyped things.\n\n42:53.040 --> 42:55.040\nEvery time you saw a blinking cursor,\n\n42:55.040 --> 42:58.040\nyou thought it meant you had something to say.\n\n42:58.040 --> 43:00.040\nThere's a jar of acid in one corner,\n\n43:00.040 --> 43:02.040\nthere's a fucking bomb in the other,\n\n43:02.040 --> 43:04.040\nyou have no choice, you're dead, bye.\n\n43:04.040 --> 43:08.040\nAnd then I would like, that's the mood I'm in\n\n43:08.040 --> 43:11.040\nwhen shit gets to the point when it redlines.\n\n43:11.040 --> 43:14.040\nI go super villainous, I go like,\n\n43:14.040 --> 43:16.040\nlet's fucking kill everybody.\n\n43:16.040 --> 43:18.040\nThat's not a good response.\n\n43:18.040 --> 43:20.040\nAs a creator and as an artist,\n\n43:20.040 --> 43:22.040\nlet's say you're a painter,\n\n43:22.040 --> 43:26.040\nhumans have learned to deal with suffering through,\n\n43:26.040 --> 43:28.040\nthe one thing I think that we've created\n\n43:28.040 --> 43:31.040\nthat the other animals haven't is art,\n\n43:31.040 --> 43:34.040\nwith how fucked up things are.\n\n43:34.040 --> 43:38.040\nWhat can you do as an artist to assuage that?\n\n43:38.040 --> 43:39.040\nAnything?\n\n43:39.040 --> 43:41.040\nHarmon Quest on CISO.\n\n43:45.040 --> 43:48.040\nComing to you this Thursday, all episodes.\n\n43:48.040 --> 43:51.040\nJuly 14th at the, what's it called, theater?\n\n43:51.040 --> 43:53.040\nOh, they think that's July 12th, actually.\n\n43:53.040 --> 43:55.040\nYeah, come to the premiere.\n\n43:55.040 --> 43:56.040\nIt's at Ticketmaster.\n\n43:56.040 --> 43:59.040\nNo, maybe it's not, it's not actually.\n\n43:59.040 --> 44:02.040\nIt's somewhere on the internet.\n\n44:02.040 --> 44:04.040\nNo, it's on the internet.\n\n44:04.040 --> 44:08.040\nWe're all going to meet up on the internet.\n\n44:08.040 --> 44:11.040\nBut most importantly of all,\n\n44:11.040 --> 44:13.040\nSan Diego Comic Con show.\n\n44:13.040 --> 44:15.040\nThat's the Balboa Theater.\n\n44:15.040 --> 44:17.040\nThat's on Ticketmaster, there you go.\n\n44:17.040 --> 44:19.040\nWhat night is that, Steve?\n\n44:19.040 --> 44:20.040\n22nd.\n\n44:20.040 --> 44:22.040\nJuly 22nd at the Balboa Theater.\n\n44:22.040 --> 44:25.040\nIs it taping and streaming, Steve, the Comic Con show?\n\n44:25.040 --> 44:27.040\nIs it taping and streaming?\n\n44:27.040 --> 44:29.040\nDon't we have some of One Direction?\n\n44:29.040 --> 44:30.040\nWho's coming?\n\n44:30.040 --> 44:31.040\nWe have huge guests.\n\n44:31.040 --> 44:33.040\nIt's not One Direction, it's Zane.\n\n44:33.040 --> 44:34.040\nWe just have Zane?\n\n44:34.040 --> 44:35.040\nYeah.\n\n44:35.040 --> 44:36.040\nOh, we're fucked.\n\n44:36.040 --> 44:40.040\nBut I think he's going to be doing a double appearance with Adam Levine.\n\n44:40.040 --> 44:41.040\nIs that a person?\n\n44:41.040 --> 44:42.040\nLevine.\n\n44:42.040 --> 44:43.040\nYeah, I call him Levine.\n\n44:43.040 --> 44:45.040\nWe go way back.\n\n44:45.040 --> 44:49.040\nBefore he tried to pronounce it all cool and stuff.\n\n44:49.040 --> 44:52.040\nHe was just Levine.\n\n44:52.040 --> 44:57.040\nYeah.\n\n44:57.040 --> 45:02.040\nI was going to say, I'll write as people are seating,\n\n45:02.040 --> 45:05.040\nas soon as they open the house, I'll have a laptop open.\n\n45:05.040 --> 45:09.040\nI don't know about this.\n\n45:09.040 --> 45:11.040\nSorry, Eugene.\n\n45:11.040 --> 45:13.040\nAnd I'll write.\n\n45:13.040 --> 45:15.040\nThat's for a plain person.\n\n45:15.040 --> 45:17.040\nIt's not going to draw people to the internet.\n\n45:17.040 --> 45:20.040\nYou're going to write things that were visibly up on the screen,\n\n45:20.040 --> 45:23.040\nand you're writing the community movie live.\n\n45:23.040 --> 45:25.040\nWell, I was trying to think of something I could write\n\n45:25.040 --> 45:27.040\nso people could watch me write,\n\n45:27.040 --> 45:29.040\nbut it's not going to lure them in because they're like,\n\n45:29.040 --> 45:31.040\nwell, I could certainly make anything interesting happen.\n\n45:31.040 --> 45:32.040\nDon't watch that on YouTube.\n\n45:32.040 --> 45:35.040\nWhat if you write the next Jaws?\n\n45:35.040 --> 45:38.040\nBut it doesn't matter because you have to think of a thing\n\n45:38.040 --> 45:41.040\nthat they can only see if they come there.\n\n45:41.040 --> 45:48.040\nOr that's why a human guest would be the best.\n\n45:48.040 --> 45:50.040\nWhat were we going to get the guy from Hamilton?\n\n45:50.040 --> 45:51.040\nWhat happened to him?\n\n45:51.040 --> 45:53.040\nOh, no, he's coming.\n\n45:53.040 --> 45:54.040\nYeah.\n\n45:54.040 --> 45:55.040\nHe's going to be at the show?\n\n45:55.040 --> 45:58.040\nYeah, Adam Levine dropped out.\n\n45:58.040 --> 46:00.040\nSo we got Lynn.\n\n46:00.040 --> 46:02.040\nIt'll be great.\n\n46:02.040 --> 46:06.040\nWe also got Bulbasaur.\n\n46:06.040 --> 46:09.040\nHe'll be making an appearance.\n\n46:09.040 --> 46:11.040\nYeah, yeah.\n\n46:11.040 --> 46:14.040\nWe have all the juggalos.\n\n46:14.040 --> 46:16.040\nThey're all coming.\n\n46:16.040 --> 46:18.040\nHere's my new segment.\n\n46:18.040 --> 46:21.040\nNow that the season's over, Game of Thrones questions.\n\n46:21.040 --> 46:23.040\nGame of Thrones questions.\n\n46:23.040 --> 46:28.040\nNow we have the time, I think.\n\n46:28.040 --> 46:30.040\nSorry.\n\n46:30.040 --> 46:33.040\nGame of Thrones questions.\n\n46:33.040 --> 46:37.040\nSo remember when Arya Stark, spoilers.\n\n46:37.040 --> 46:39.040\nOh, boy.\n\n46:39.040 --> 46:45.040\nShe was like in the end, the red wedding coordinator.\n\n46:45.040 --> 46:49.040\nThe guy who loved the red wedding is like, I love red weddings.\n\n46:49.040 --> 46:51.040\nYou don't have to.\n\n46:51.040 --> 46:53.040\nI mean, I'm not going to remember his name.\n\n46:53.040 --> 46:55.040\nI was more entertained by my own.\n\n46:55.040 --> 46:59.040\nYou have to say that wedding coordinator out of a job.\n\n46:59.040 --> 47:00.040\nNo, I don't know.\n\n47:00.040 --> 47:03.040\nI think he said to her, I'm seeing a red wedding.\n\n47:03.040 --> 47:05.040\nHe was like, I love red wings.\n\n47:05.040 --> 47:10.040\nSo they teed up the Hooters waitress, this foxy.\n\n47:10.040 --> 47:19.040\nI put her in her early 20s, kind of lady who brings things to Walter Frey.\n\n47:19.040 --> 47:21.040\nHe's the Lord of River Run.\n\n47:21.040 --> 47:23.040\nAnd she's bringing him pie.\n\n47:23.040 --> 47:26.040\nSo there's a scene where he goes, I had more milkshakes.\n\n47:26.040 --> 47:29.040\nAnd she comes up and she's like, here's your Game of Thrones milkshakes.\n\n47:29.040 --> 47:31.040\nAnd she's like cleavage.\n\n47:31.040 --> 47:39.040\nAnd she's a grown woman, but she's certainly not, you know, she's age inappropriate for him.\n\n47:39.040 --> 47:42.040\nAnd he's like, I love milkshakes.\n\n47:42.040 --> 47:45.040\nAnd so you see her and you go like, huh, that was weird.\n\n47:45.040 --> 47:49.040\nAnd then at the end she comes back and goes like, would you like another milkshake?\n\n47:49.040 --> 47:53.040\nAnd he's like, as long as it reminds me of the red wedding, I love red weddings.\n\n47:53.040 --> 47:58.040\nAnd then that Hooters waitress inexplicably like stabs him.\n\n47:58.040 --> 48:00.040\nAnd he's like, what are you doing?\n\n48:00.040 --> 48:02.040\nI didn't ask to be stabbed.\n\n48:02.040 --> 48:05.040\nAnd then she pulls off and it's Arya Stark.\n\n48:05.040 --> 48:06.040\nAnd you're like, OK.\n\n48:06.040 --> 48:09.040\nSo then the episode's over and I'm going, OK.\n\n48:09.040 --> 48:18.040\nSo I asked a bunch of questions that creep people out about she's 14 and she's disguised as a 19-year-old.\n\n48:18.040 --> 48:21.040\nBut I get past that stuff, eventually.\n\n48:21.040 --> 48:33.040\nAnd I get to the point where I'm asking, have we seen a, so let's say Arya Stark were a male character that had gone through...\n\n48:33.040 --> 48:36.040\nWell, she's being one of the many-faced people she's putting on a disguise.\n\n48:36.040 --> 48:38.040\nBut then she disguises herself.\n\n48:38.040 --> 48:44.040\nHave we seen a, has there been a cross-gender, many-faced disguise in Game of Thrones?\n\n48:44.040 --> 48:46.040\nI think Jackon's done some girls.\n\n48:46.040 --> 48:47.040\nSay what?\n\n48:47.040 --> 48:48.040\nJackon.\n\n48:48.040 --> 48:49.040\nJackon.\n\n48:49.040 --> 48:50.040\nI think he did a girl.\n\n48:50.040 --> 48:51.040\nJackon did a girl?\n\n48:51.040 --> 48:52.040\nOr the girl did him, maybe.\n\n48:52.040 --> 48:53.040\nAll right.\n\n48:53.040 --> 48:55.040\nJackon did a girl?\n\n48:55.040 --> 48:57.040\nYeah, no, there's the penis.\n\n48:57.040 --> 48:58.040\nIt's the penis.\n\n48:58.040 --> 49:00.040\nYeah, there's a penis.\n\n49:00.040 --> 49:02.040\nThat was your question, right?\n\n49:02.040 --> 49:05.040\nLike, if a girl puts on a guy mask, there'll be a penis.\n\n49:05.040 --> 49:06.040\nHere's my question.\n\n49:06.040 --> 49:07.040\nI'm going all the way forward to this.\n\n49:07.040 --> 49:13.040\nSo say you could disguise, say you were a kid, a boy kid, you go through the training.\n\n49:13.040 --> 49:14.040\nA grown man penis.\n\n49:14.040 --> 49:15.040\nWhat?\n\n49:15.040 --> 49:16.040\nNo.\n\n49:16.040 --> 49:17.040\nNo.\n\n49:17.040 --> 49:18.040\nI'll stop guessing.\n\n49:18.040 --> 49:20.040\nNo, I'm walking you through this.\n\n49:20.040 --> 49:21.040\nLet me walk you through it.\n\n49:21.040 --> 49:22.040\nOkay.\n\n49:22.040 --> 49:23.040\nYou're a boy.\n\n49:23.040 --> 49:24.040\nYou're a young Spencer.\n\n49:24.040 --> 49:25.040\nRight.\n\n49:25.040 --> 49:27.040\nYou go to the house with the double doors and the black and the white.\n\n49:27.040 --> 49:28.040\nYeah, yeah.\n\n49:28.040 --> 49:33.040\nAnd it's like, oh, stop using pronouns.\n\n49:33.040 --> 49:34.040\nDon't always speak in the present tense.\n\n49:34.040 --> 49:36.040\nHe gives you the whole orientation.\n\n49:36.040 --> 49:37.040\nRight.\n\n49:37.040 --> 49:41.040\nAlso, we're going to take your eyes away and hit you with a stick for a while.\n\n49:41.040 --> 49:42.040\nOnly if you use a pronoun.\n\n49:42.040 --> 49:44.040\nYou got to fuck up first.\n\n49:44.040 --> 49:45.040\nYeah.\n\n49:45.040 --> 49:47.040\nSo you go through the whole training.\n\n49:47.040 --> 49:52.040\nAnd along the way, you learn, you find a whole row chamber of faces and you find out\n\n49:52.040 --> 49:55.040\nyou can take them each and you can slap them on and go be that person.\n\n49:55.040 --> 49:58.040\nAnd then you're like, half of them are women.\n\n49:58.040 --> 49:59.040\n51%.\n\n49:59.040 --> 50:00.040\nMaybe.\n\n50:00.040 --> 50:09.040\nAnd so at one point you go, he says, he comes to you and he says, a boy who has no name\n\n50:09.040 --> 50:14.040\nneeds to go over to Seattle and hang out.\n\n50:14.040 --> 50:23.040\nAnd a certain man who started a certain startup thinks the stock options would be appropriate\n\n50:23.040 --> 50:26.040\nbut maybe the people need the stock to drop down.\n\n50:26.040 --> 50:31.040\nI'm combining Game of Thrones with Grand Theft Auto 5.\n\n50:31.040 --> 50:35.040\nSo you disguise yourself as a woman.\n\n50:35.040 --> 50:43.040\nSo you go there and you're watching him and you're in disguise for a while.\n\n50:43.040 --> 50:49.040\nSo let's say during that disguise, period, you fall in love with him.\n\n50:49.040 --> 50:52.040\nAnd you make love with him.\n\n50:52.040 --> 50:54.040\nSo go even beyond.\n\n50:54.040 --> 50:59.040\nSo I got my friends to tell me, yes, there'd be a vagina there.\n\n50:59.040 --> 51:00.040\nIt's part of the disguise.\n\n51:00.040 --> 51:01.040\nIt's a mystical disguise.\n\n51:01.040 --> 51:02.040\nYou're assuming that identity.\n\n51:02.040 --> 51:03.040\nOh yeah.\n\n51:03.040 --> 51:05.040\nSo his wiener goes into your vagina.\n\n51:05.040 --> 51:06.040\nYeah.\n\n51:06.040 --> 51:09.040\nHe ejaculates from joy.\n\n51:09.040 --> 51:10.040\nOf course.\n\n51:10.040 --> 51:13.040\nAs I'm told, that's the only way.\n\n51:13.040 --> 51:16.040\nWhat else?\n\n51:16.040 --> 51:21.040\nSo this illusion is not going to stop there and turn into something else.\n\n51:21.040 --> 51:22.040\nYou've got ovaries.\n\n51:22.040 --> 51:23.040\nYou've got eggs.\n\n51:23.040 --> 51:25.040\nLet's say you get pregnant.\n\n51:25.040 --> 51:27.040\nYour disguise gets pregnant.\n\n51:27.040 --> 51:28.040\nYeah.\n\n51:28.040 --> 51:30.040\nHow could it not be possible?\n\n51:30.040 --> 51:32.040\nCan that happen to Spencer as a mimic?\n\n51:32.040 --> 51:35.040\nWould the mimic character have ovaries?\n\n51:35.040 --> 51:36.040\nDoes it go that far?\n\n51:36.040 --> 51:40.040\nLet me tell you something about illusionary magic.\n\n51:40.040 --> 51:42.040\nIt breaks down into a lot of things.\n\n51:42.040 --> 51:45.040\nThere's glamours, I think, and figments.\n\n51:45.040 --> 51:48.040\nAnd then there's lesser phantasms and shadows.\n\n51:48.040 --> 51:50.040\nYou see, there's a whole gamut.\n\n51:50.040 --> 51:56.040\nBut I assume that the masks probably just work on this lowest level where it's just your basic senses.\n\n51:56.040 --> 51:59.040\nBut nothing deeper than that.\n\n51:59.040 --> 52:04.040\nSo you might confuse yourself for grabbing like a hot titty or whatever.\n\n52:04.040 --> 52:07.040\nBut it wouldn't actually be there.\n\n52:07.040 --> 52:11.040\nIt would just be magically your senses were feeling it.\n\n52:11.040 --> 52:28.040\nYou're saying if you trained this way and you're going to assassinate me,\n\n52:28.040 --> 52:34.040\nyou're going to assassinate someone in Los Angeles and the best way to do it is to love me.\n\n52:34.040 --> 52:36.040\nSo you meet me.\n\n52:36.040 --> 52:41.040\nAnd then we hit it off and you know that you're on the right track.\n\n52:41.040 --> 52:44.040\nYou're doing your mission right by loving me.\n\n52:44.040 --> 52:46.040\nSo I make love to you.\n\n52:46.040 --> 52:58.040\nAnd you're saying the illusionary magic means that when I take my tiny, itty-bitty little rage-filled purple disgusting penis\n\n52:58.040 --> 53:08.040\nand I move it around hoping for some fucking relief that Captain Kangaroo couldn't give me.\n\n53:08.040 --> 53:19.040\nI finally, when I insert it, what's happening is that something's happening and it's based on illusion.\n\n53:19.040 --> 53:23.040\nAnd what you're saying is that definitely you don't have ovaries.\n\n53:23.040 --> 53:24.040\nI don't think so.\n\n53:24.040 --> 53:30.040\nBecause it's at the point of, you're saying if I grabbed where your breast would be,\n\n53:30.040 --> 53:38.040\nit's like nano armor where it'd be like, oh, he expects to feel a breast there so like energy goes there.\n\n53:38.040 --> 53:40.040\nYeah, that's what I assumed.\n\n53:40.040 --> 53:46.040\nI assumed it's focused on the face is like that channels the magic, but it's illusionary magic.\n\n53:46.040 --> 53:51.040\nI don't think there's a physical, like magically you're not physically morphing in any way.\n\n53:51.040 --> 54:00.040\nSo if you fell in love with someone who was disguising themselves with illusion magic as the opposite gender,\n\n54:00.040 --> 54:11.040\nand you imagined yourself like consummating a reproductive engagement with them,\n\n54:11.040 --> 54:22.040\nall that, yeah, of course it wouldn't, you're saying something's happening down there that's a cloud of thought around your penis.\n\n54:22.040 --> 54:27.040\nIt's like VR, you know, like you don't know.\n\n54:27.040 --> 54:29.040\nIt just seems like you're there.\n\n54:29.040 --> 54:36.040\nI wanted to go to the place that you have to have ovaries if you were, the disguise is like thorough,\n\n54:36.040 --> 54:41.040\nand then a baby could be conceived, but while the disguise was happening,\n\n54:41.040 --> 54:49.040\nand then my big question was the baby's born, it's half you, but half who.\n\n54:49.040 --> 54:51.040\nIt would be the mask in that case.\n\n54:51.040 --> 54:52.040\nRight.\n\n54:52.040 --> 54:54.040\nIt would have to be because it's the mask.\n\n54:54.040 --> 55:00.040\nI think if your job is to be like, if you're going to be one of the many faced weirdos that you're going to put on a face and go kill somebody,\n\n55:00.040 --> 55:04.040\nthat you're not doing your job right if you're going home and fucking people.\n\n55:04.040 --> 55:08.040\nI think your job is to go kill somebody every week.\n\n55:08.040 --> 55:12.040\nYou're supposed to go kill somebody and put that face back up on the shelf by sundown?\n\n55:12.040 --> 55:13.040\nYeah.\n\n55:13.040 --> 55:14.040\nOr you lose your eyes.\n\n55:14.040 --> 55:17.040\nWhat is the fantasy for something that you're wishing?\n\n55:17.040 --> 55:23.040\nIt seems like you have some sort of like pie in the sky version of this where it wants to be pregnant.\n\n55:23.040 --> 55:28.040\nNo, I wanted to try to chase magic to the threshold of genetics.\n\n55:28.040 --> 55:35.040\nI was curious because that's a case of like, you're saying magic is like, oh, I look like so-and-so, and it's just like the illusion.\n\n55:35.040 --> 55:36.040\nI don't know.\n\n55:36.040 --> 55:37.040\nJust asking questions, man.\n\n55:37.040 --> 55:40.040\nI want to know about what are the rules on those dragons.\n\n55:40.040 --> 55:45.040\nSo I mean, you can't control them and they deposit you in the wilderness, then you knock over some fires,\n\n55:45.040 --> 55:48.040\nand all of a sudden you're fucking queen dragons all of a sudden?\n\n55:48.040 --> 55:49.040\nHow does that work?\n\n55:49.040 --> 55:53.040\nYou go off screen for a while, and then all of a sudden you now control dragons perfectly?\n\n55:53.040 --> 55:54.040\nWhat the shit is that?\n\n55:54.040 --> 55:55.040\nYeah.\n\n55:55.040 --> 55:59.040\nAnd you can fly them over a boat, and then you say, like, ducador.\n\n55:59.040 --> 56:01.040\nAnd there you go, like, oh, ducador.\n\n56:01.040 --> 56:02.040\nI like to-\n\n56:02.040 --> 56:03.040\nWait a minute.\n\n56:03.040 --> 56:05.040\nYou need words to do shit?\n\n56:05.040 --> 56:07.040\nYou've been fucking autonomous this whole-\n\n56:07.040 --> 56:09.040\nAlso, they needed boats.\n\n56:09.040 --> 56:12.040\nThe first thing the dragons did, they burned down a bunch of boats.\n\n56:12.040 --> 56:18.040\nThey made great pains to burn down only one boat at all, which was really weird visually.\n\n56:18.040 --> 56:21.040\nIt was like three dragons attacking one boat.\n\n56:21.040 --> 56:25.040\nIt was very slow work being done, warfare, you know, lives.\n\n56:25.040 --> 56:26.040\nI didn't note that, too.\n\n56:26.040 --> 56:29.040\nI was like, oh, because before that, I was experiencing this joy.\n\n56:29.040 --> 56:33.040\nI was going, oh, all this talk of dragons, and dragons are so goddamn important, all this stuff,\n\n56:33.040 --> 56:35.040\nand it's like, wow, they're really showing you.\n\n56:35.040 --> 56:37.040\nYes, of course dragons are important.\n\n56:37.040 --> 56:42.040\nThey are, like, the might of the military is huge part of it.\n\n56:42.040 --> 56:45.040\nIt's like wooden boats that float up to the thing.\n\n56:45.040 --> 56:49.040\nAnd I thought I was going to see a scene where a dragon flew over 90 boats-\n\n56:49.040 --> 56:50.040\nExactly.\n\n56:50.040 --> 56:52.040\nAnd lit them all up.\n\n56:52.040 --> 56:54.040\nRight, that would have been really cool looking.\n\n56:54.040 --> 56:56.040\nBut they might have made-\n\n56:56.040 --> 56:59.040\nNo, I get that, and that's why they made it look stupid.\n\n56:59.040 --> 57:00.040\nIt was just dumb.\n\n57:00.040 --> 57:02.040\nI don't like it.\n\n57:02.040 --> 57:05.040\nWhat, you raised your hand?\n\n57:05.040 --> 57:06.040\nI did.\n\n57:06.040 --> 57:08.040\nHe's been raising his hand for an hour today.\n\n57:08.040 --> 57:10.040\nNo, he's been shouting shit out.\n\n57:10.040 --> 57:13.040\nThat's why when he raises his hand, I'm like, are we going to die?\n\n57:13.040 --> 57:17.040\nI have a question about the illusionary magic.\n\n57:17.040 --> 57:20.040\nSo do I, and we finished that segment.\n\n57:20.040 --> 57:22.040\nOkay, number one.\n\n57:22.040 --> 57:24.040\nWhat about Philip Morris?\n\n57:24.040 --> 57:25.040\nWhat's up?\n\n57:25.040 --> 57:27.040\nAre they using illusionary magic?\n\n57:27.040 --> 57:28.040\nWait, say what?\n\n57:28.040 --> 57:29.040\nI didn't hear it.\n\n57:29.040 --> 57:30.040\nWhat about Philip Morris?\n\n57:30.040 --> 57:31.040\nIt was a callback.\n\n57:31.040 --> 57:32.040\nIt was fine.\n\n57:32.040 --> 57:33.040\nI want to answer-\n\n57:33.040 --> 57:35.040\nNo one ever asks me questions about magic.\n\n57:35.040 --> 57:36.040\nI love this.\n\n57:36.040 --> 57:38.040\nWell, I have a question for you about magic.\n\n57:38.040 --> 57:39.040\nYeah, no, I heard it.\n\n57:39.040 --> 57:44.040\nYour theory about the illusions works in an additive way, right?\n\n57:44.040 --> 57:50.040\nSo if you have the illusion of a beautiful titty, and Dan goes to touch it,\n\n57:50.040 --> 57:54.040\nthe illusion makes him think he's touching a beautiful titty that isn't there.\n\n57:54.040 --> 58:00.040\nHowever, if Dan goes to fuck your illusionary vagina,\n\n58:00.040 --> 58:04.040\nit doesn't really work in a subtractive way.\n\n58:04.040 --> 58:10.040\nIf there's a dick there, and Dan goes to fuck a vagina,\n\n58:10.040 --> 58:14.040\nyour theory doesn't really remove the dick.\n\n58:14.040 --> 58:18.040\nWell, what's actually happened is you're just working your elbow down there,\n\n58:18.040 --> 58:21.040\nand they're just going out the elbow.\n\n58:21.040 --> 58:22.040\nThat's exactly-\n\n58:22.040 --> 58:25.040\nThat was part of what I was thinking,\n\n58:25.040 --> 58:28.040\nbut when you put it in the words that I looked down that road,\n\n58:28.040 --> 58:30.040\nand I was like, wait, is this like in 1986,\n\n58:30.040 --> 58:31.040\nit's like a link-letter movie,\n\n58:31.040 --> 58:34.040\nlike I'm asking these questions about fucking and pussies,\n\n58:34.040 --> 58:36.040\nand I backed away from it,\n\n58:36.040 --> 58:38.040\nbut thank you for walking into that minefield\n\n58:38.040 --> 58:41.040\nand just confirming that it's just like...\n\n58:41.040 --> 58:43.040\nJust imagine...\n\n58:43.040 --> 58:44.040\nBecause it's like, what?\n\n58:44.040 --> 58:48.040\nWait, if it's a visible pussy, how do you know what your dick's in a pussy?\n\n58:48.040 --> 58:50.040\nLike, I didn't want to...\n\n58:50.040 --> 58:57.040\nI'm glad you're laughing because I ran that simulation.\n\n58:57.040 --> 58:59.040\nI was like, I have a 43, it's a new world,\n\n58:59.040 --> 59:03.040\nI got to ask these questions, and then you did,\n\n59:03.040 --> 59:06.040\nand like, we're both alive.\n\n59:06.040 --> 59:08.040\nWhich is what the...\n\n59:08.040 --> 59:10.040\nWell, we've all had our fun tonight,\n\n59:10.040 --> 59:13.040\nbut just imagine a hallucination, right?\n\n59:13.040 --> 59:16.040\nYou see something, it's not there.\n\n59:16.040 --> 59:19.040\nNow imagine that happening, but with your sense of touch.\n\n59:19.040 --> 59:20.040\nThat's all that's happening.\n\n59:20.040 --> 59:23.040\nIt's just a hallucination totally not happening,\n\n59:23.040 --> 59:26.040\nbut somehow your mind just interprets it as happening.\n\n59:26.040 --> 59:27.040\nThat's all it is.\n\n59:27.040 --> 59:28.040\nIt's magic.\n\n59:28.040 --> 59:32.040\nYou feel the pussy surround your penis.\n\n59:32.040 --> 59:37.040\nIt is wet and tight as you'd imagine.\n\n59:37.040 --> 59:41.040\nIt's warm as a microwaved cantaloupe.\n\n59:46.040 --> 59:50.040\nBut deep within your will, something feels amiss.\n\n59:53.040 --> 59:56.040\nYou pass your will-save.\n\n59:56.040 --> 01:00:01.040\nIt's a dude, but that's fine.\n\n01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:05.040\nIf you're fine with that...\n\n01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:08.040\nI ask her, you're like, what's going on?\n\n01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:10.040\nWhat's the deal?\n\n01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.040\nThey're right here.\n\n01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.040\nStab in the neck.\n\n01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.040\nThere you go.\n\n01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.040\nI don't think it would go that far.\n\n01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:22.040\nWhat's the will-save on imaginary pussy?\n\n01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.040\n17s.\n\n01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.040\nSo he rolled what?\n\n01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.040\nHe rolled a 17 or higher?\n\n01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.040\nOh yeah, yeah, he's rolling hard.\n\n01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.040\nThe point was about genetics.\n\n01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:37.040\nIt's about genetics, but I think I have all my answers.\n\n01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.040\nIllusion magic can make you in all the ways\n\n01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.040\nthat you would mythically think you could fool somebody.\n\n01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.040\nYou can fool somebody.\n\n01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:48.040\nThat includes being in bed with them, conjugating with them.\n\n01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:51.040\nNone of it, but it's all an illusion.\n\n01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.040\nUnless it's not.\n\n01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.040\nIt could be polymorph magic.\n\n01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.040\nI just don't think it is.\n\n01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:00.040\nIn which case it's actually manipulating the matter.\n\n01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:03.040\nYeah, but usually there are, I think,\n\n01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:09.040\nin a lot of old Greek, not Greek, god damn it,\n\n01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.040\nold knights and legends and stuff.\n\n01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:14.040\nThere's all these body-switching potions,\n\n01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.040\nand then you actually would get pregnant with the kids,\n\n01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.040\nand that was probably polymorph magic.\n\n01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.040\nWhat is the...\n\n01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:25.040\nYou can be a halfling magician.\n\n01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.040\nOh boy, can you ever.\n\n01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:29.040\nOkay, so that's a reduced size there.\n\n01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:31.040\nThere's an average height.\n\n01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.040\nSo if that person's an illusionist,\n\n01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:36.040\nand they cast an illusion spell that's supposed to disguise them as somebody,\n\n01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:38.040\nthere's limitations based on height?\n\n01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:41.040\nYeah, the lower-level magic spells,\n\n01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.040\nyou can only go by about an eighth of your total height,\n\n01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:46.040\nso the shorter you are, you can only get a little bit taller.\n\n01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.040\nThose things are all expressed as modifiers.\n\n01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:53.040\nYeah, modifiers, hit points, saving throws.\n\n01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:56.040\nYeah, hey, who made that weird groan?\n\n01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:59.040\nI'm gonna be your heartburn.\n\n01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:01.040\nI miss D&D, you guys.\n\n01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.040\nI miss playing the D&D.\n\n01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:07.040\nI enjoyed our shadow-run thing for a little while,\n\n01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:10.040\nbut I think we didn't quite really sink our teeth into that.\n\n01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.040\nI'll tell you what, maybe if it does,\n\n01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:14.040\nthis place is crawling with Nitteran.\n\n01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.040\nSo the headlines were...\n\n01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.040\nI did want to get...\n\n01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:20.040\nSo there was the headline about how there's a robbery gang.\n\n01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.040\nThey set up like a maybe a poke-lure or something,\n\n01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:26.040\nso you show up or they were preying on people.\n\n01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:29.040\nThe other one, of course, was the...\n\n01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:32.040\nI think a young lady who was searching for a poke-mind\n\n01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:35.040\ninto a riverbed and found a dead body.\n\n01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:38.040\nAnd a dude fell off a bridge.\n\n01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:40.040\nSomebody got stabbed in Chicago?\n\n01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.040\nBy a cipher.\n\n01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:47.040\nYeah, this is my element.\n\n01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.040\nWait, you're overwhelming grandpa.\n\n01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.040\nI mean, let's hear...\n\n01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:53.040\nOh, the guy who plays like a really bad airshake.\n\n01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.040\nWait, come up and grab a mic so we can hear you.\n\n01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.040\nGet up and grab a mic so we can hear you.\n\n01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.040\nJust stand in the mic.\n\n01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.040\nBecause this guy knew...\n\n01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.040\nWhat are you, theater trained?\n\n01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.040\nWhat are you...\n\n01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:04.040\nLike, here's my thoughts.\n\n01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.040\nLike, here we go.\n\n01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.040\nThis guy up here is playing Pippin\n\n01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.040\nin the Torrance Community Center.\n\n01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.040\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.040\nScott Ian from Anthrax.\n\n01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.040\nActually, I like that. I like Anthrax.\n\n01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.040\nIf I thought that would be insulting, I wouldn't have said it.\n\n01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:22.040\nNo, but you look a little bit like Scott Ian.\n\n01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:23.040\nI like that.\n\n01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:24.040\nMy name is Jacob.\n\n01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.040\nThe story I was saying was...\n\n01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.040\nI read this...\n\n01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.040\nGod, I was like two days ago when this story came out.\n\n01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:31.040\nSome kid in Chicago, I think he was like a seven-year-old or something.\n\n01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.040\nHe was playing Pokemon Go, you know, on the app.\n\n01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:35.040\nHe didn't fucking look where he was going.\n\n01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:37.040\nOne is a really bad area of town.\n\n01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.040\nHe gets...\n\n01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.040\nLike, he was passing by this convenience store or something.\n\n01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.040\nSomebody actually stabs him and it's Robson.\n\n01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.040\nI think he survived, but...\n\n01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:45.040\nTeam Robson?\n\n01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:47.040\nYeah.\n\n01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:49.040\nOh, man.\n\n01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:51.040\nFucking blues.\n\n01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.040\nFucking blues.\n\n01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.040\nThis is not for grandpa.\n\n01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.040\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:59.040\nI'll tell you what, if a blue walks in right now, I'll stab him.\n\n01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.040\nI'll stab him.\n\n01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.040\nOh, God.\n\n01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.040\nNo, but this really happened.\n\n01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.040\nI'm terrified right now.\n\n01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:09.040\nHe was stabbed by people unrelated to Pokemon Go\n\n01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:10.040\nor people that were part of the game?\n\n01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:12.040\nNo, it was unrelated. It was a robbery.\n\n01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.040\nHe just didn't realize that he weren't from a bad area.\n\n01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:16.040\nHe walked into a bad part of town.\n\n01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.040\nYes.\n\n01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:20.040\nAnd he got stabbed for being in the bad part of town.\n\n01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:21.040\nYeah.\n\n01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.040\nPretty much, yes.\n\n01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:26.040\nSo Pokemon Go, because it's the first game to require leaving your house,\n\n01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:29.040\nis being fused with all the reasons to not leave your house.\n\n01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.040\nPretty much, yes.\n\n01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.040\nThere's Pokemon Go stories.\n\n01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:37.040\nPokemon Go user meets a dude that we strike years of our life.\n\n01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.040\nLife.\n\n01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.040\nI don't know what that was.\n\n01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.040\nI don't know what that was.\n\n01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:47.040\nI don't know what that was.\n\n01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:53.040\nI downloaded the app with the game with Dan and Cody a few hours ago.\n\n01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:57.040\nWent home, took a shower, got dressed, turned my phone on.\n\n01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.040\nThe app is still open.\n\n01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:03.040\nThere was Pokemon lurking about my crib, so I threw some Pokeballs at him\n\n01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:06.040\nand I took a while to figure out how that shit works.\n\n01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:08.040\nBecause it's not intuitive.\n\n01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:09.040\nI'll tell you that much.\n\n01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:12.040\nIt seems like Ski Ball, but mostly it's a fucking shot in the dark.\n\n01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.040\nIt is.\n\n01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.040\nAnd then, so I start looking around.\n\n01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:17.040\nAlso, they don't let you wear a suit and tie.\n\n01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:20.040\nYou gotta have a yellow backpack on and a visor.\n\n01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:21.040\nLike I'm a golfer.\n\n01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.040\nJeff is so affected by this.\n\n01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:23.040\nI don't like this shit.\n\n01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:26.040\nJerry, did you're making Jeff play a game where he has to choose between\n\n01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.040\nthree kinds of visor?\n\n01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.040\nI don't like...\n\n01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:30.040\nIt's in the wild to die, basically.\n\n01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:35.040\nI'm not like one of those freemium players where like, oh, 1999 to get a big energy pack\n\n01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.040\nto do this thing.\n\n01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.040\nFuck that.\n\n01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.040\nI'll play it for free.\n\n01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:40.040\nI'll spend my money on fun things.\n\n01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:46.040\nBut I'll tell you right now, if Pokemon Go had a $5 thing that let me put a suit on,\n\n01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.040\nI'll fucking do it.\n\n01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:50.040\nSo anyway, I look around.\n\n01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:53.040\nWhat the little Pokemons might be around town.\n\n01:05:53.040 --> 01:06:01.040\nOne's Marshall High School and one is the Immaculate Heart Convent right up my street.\n\n01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:03.040\nKaty Perry just bought that shit.\n\n01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:06.040\nSo maybe I go up there and my Pokemon is Katy Perry.\n\n01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:09.040\nBut it's making me walk around my neighborhood.\n\n01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:15.040\nBut how do I know that Marc Maron's not waiting there to kill me so we can kill Harmontown\n\n01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.040\nguys?\n\n01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:19.040\nIf you guys don't think fucking Maron's going to use this as a way to try to get his edge\n\n01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.040\nback over us.\n\n01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:22.040\nLike, luring.\n\n01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.040\nThere's a...\n\n01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:25.040\nDo you think we have an edge on Marc Maron right now?\n\n01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:27.040\nNo, it was a bit.\n\n01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.040\nTeens use Pokemon Go apps.\n\n01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:34.040\nOkay, I talked about armed robbery in Missouri.\n\n01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:36.040\nArmed robbery in Missouri happened?\n\n01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.040\nWhat about the guy fell off a bridge?\n\n01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.040\nDied?\n\n01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.040\nWait, are we talking about just current events or...\n\n01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.040\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.040\nThese are Pokemon related.\n\n01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.040\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.040\nOkay, well...\n\n01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:48.040\nDid you guys hear that Donald Trump is running for president?\n\n01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.040\nI want to...\n\n01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.040\nReally?\n\n01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.040\nHoly shit.\n\n01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:55.040\nYeah, he followed a Pokemon into the Republican committee.\n\n01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.040\nIt's amazing.\n\n01:06:56.040 --> 01:07:01.040\nWe can get back to any of this, but there's only a couple things more to get out of the\n\n01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.040\npipe.\n\n01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:03.040\nI just wanted to say that...\n\n01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:07.040\nI don't know if you guys knew this, but I looked it up because I've been trying to watch\n\n01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.040\nall of the Saw movies.\n\n01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.040\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.040\nJacob.\n\n01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.040\nJacob.\n\n01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:13.040\nI've been trying to watch all the Saw movies again.\n\n01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.040\nI forgot the...\n\n01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:18.040\nThere were four of them when I did it the first time, so I'm up to four.\n\n01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:23.040\nI just finished Saw 4 and very confused, but just so you know, if you watch all the Saw\n\n01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:27.040\nmovies, you get to four, it gets very confusing, just going to save you some trouble.\n\n01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:30.040\nThe Saw 4 happens at the same time as Saw 3.\n\n01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.040\nAll right.\n\n01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.040\nYeah.\n\n01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.040\nIt's...\n\n01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:36.040\nJust watch them and it's just like, like, like, don't just save yourself some trouble.\n\n01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.040\nIt's not a spoiler.\n\n01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.040\nIt's...\n\n01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.040\nI don't know why they did it that way.\n\n01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:40.040\nI think because Saw dies...\n\n01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:41.040\nThe guy's name is Saw?\n\n01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:49.040\nI don't want to spoil this for you guys, but there's 90 of these movies and Saw dies in...\n\n01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.040\nWell, he starts dying in the first one.\n\n01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:53.040\nThat's the whole point, is that he's dying.\n\n01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:55.040\nThat's why he's Saw.\n\n01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:59.040\nAnd then in the second one, he's like, I'm really dying, so I'm sawing everything.\n\n01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:04.040\nAnd then in the third one, it's like, remember, I saw that one girl that I sawed in the first\n\n01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:05.040\none of the second one.\n\n01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:07.040\nNow she's like my sidekick.\n\n01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.040\nThis is a spoiler.\n\n01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.040\nShe's my protege.\n\n01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:10.040\nNo, it's not.\n\n01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:17.040\nIt's a spoiler of a fucking like crazy telenovela about that there's almost nothing to do with\n\n01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:23.040\nSaw's and everything to do with the weirdly incompatible themes of puzzles...\n\n01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:26.040\nAnd living.\n\n01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.040\n...joy?\n\n01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:32.040\nAnd civil engineering.\n\n01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.040\nYeah.\n\n01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:36.040\nThe killer is a...\n\n01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:38.040\nHe's an engineer.\n\n01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.040\nHe loves...\n\n01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.040\nHe makes things.\n\n01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.040\nAnd then at one point he wanted...\n\n01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.040\nSo he saw his people.\n\n01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:45.040\nSo Saw three and four happen at the same time.\n\n01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:48.040\nSo don't get confused.\n\n01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:52.040\nBecause there's a guy that walks into the end of Saw four and he's actually watching the\n\n01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:53.040\nend of Saw three.\n\n01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.040\nAll right.\n\n01:08:54.040 --> 01:09:01.040\nHey, have you guys ever seen a guy wear a hard hat into a bar and just, it would just\n\n01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.040\nwear it?\n\n01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.040\nLike he's just wearing a hat?\n\n01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.040\nBecause I did.\n\n01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:10.040\nAnd he's out there somewhere and it said Time Warner on his hat.\n\n01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.040\nThere was a guy with a hard hat.\n\n01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:13.040\nA guy with a hard hat walks into a bar.\n\n01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:16.040\nHe's just wearing a hard hat.\n\n01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:19.040\nAll right.\n\n01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:22.040\nSo you guys think that's okay to wear a hard hat?\n\n01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:23.040\nJust...\n\n01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.040\nYeah.\n\n01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.040\nThey love it.\n\n01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:30.040\nI think in this day and age it's the only safe way to walk into a bar.\n\n01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:31.040\nOkay.\n\n01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.040\nI think he was too cool looking.\n\n01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.040\nHe was too hip looking.\n\n01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:38.040\nAnd he knew that he's a white collar guy.\n\n01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:40.040\nBut he wouldn't read that way in the bar.\n\n01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:43.040\nHe was like, I'll just wear my hat.\n\n01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:44.040\nIt's me.\n\n01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:45.040\nIt's who I am.\n\n01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.040\nIt shows what I am.\n\n01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:47.040\nI'm not ashamed of it.\n\n01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:49.040\nThe hard hat to me says I'm on the clock.\n\n01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:52.040\nBut going into the bar says I'm off the clock.\n\n01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:55.040\nYou don't get to do both of those.\n\n01:09:55.040 --> 01:10:00.040\nIf you've ever worn a hard hat, it's like you want to take it off all the time.\n\n01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:01.040\nThey're not comfortable.\n\n01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:04.040\nIt's like balancing a suitcase on your head.\n\n01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:07.040\nMaybe he had a head injury and he needs to wear the hard hat.\n\n01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:10.040\nHe could be the best person ever.\n\n01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:13.040\nI thought that the whole time while I was asking questions about him.\n\n01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:16.040\nI was like, this guy's the hero and I'm the villain.\n\n01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:17.040\nWhat am I doing?\n\n01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:19.040\nWhy isn't he allowed to dress the way he wants to dress?\n\n01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:21.040\nIt's a hard hat.\n\n01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.040\nIt's just weird.\n\n01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.040\nHe was acting like it wasn't a hard hat.\n\n01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:26.040\nWhere was that?\n\n01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:27.040\nThe drawing room.\n\n01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:28.040\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:30.040\nThat place is crawling with Nitteran.\n\n01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:35.040\nI don't even know what you're talking about.\n\n01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:37.040\nI love it so much.\n\n01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.040\nI was in bed with my girlfriend.\n\n01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:41.040\nI swear to God.\n\n01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.040\nHear him out.\n\n01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:45.040\nSuspend your disbelief.\n\n01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.040\nAnd we were having a nice weekend.\n\n01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.040\nJacob, this is why I kept you up here.\n\n01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:49.040\nI want you to hear this.\n\n01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.040\nOkay.\n\n01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.040\nJacob, what are you saying?\n\n01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.040\nHe wants you to come home with him and his girlfriend.\n\n01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:57.040\nOkay.\n\n01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:02.040\nAnd sing some anthrax for us.\n\n01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:08.040\nAnd my girlfriend said to me, I want to start getting you to like light more.\n\n01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:10.040\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.040\nLight.\n\n01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.040\nYeah.\n\n01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:13.040\nLight hurts you, right?\n\n01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.040\nBecause I don't like light.\n\n01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.040\nYeah, like it makes you uncomfortable.\n\n01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:18.040\nYeah, I don't like sunlight.\n\n01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:21.040\nAre you photosensitive?\n\n01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:22.040\nI don't know.\n\n01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:23.040\nI don't like light.\n\n01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.040\nYeah.\n\n01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.040\nSensitive, I don't know.\n\n01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:27.040\nDon't like it.\n\n01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:28.040\nI don't like light.\n\n01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:31.040\nHow do you feel about this, the limelight, the stage?\n\n01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.040\nThe necessary evil?\n\n01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:37.040\nIf you had your way, would the stage be totally dark?\n\n01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:39.040\nWhoa.\n\n01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.040\nThat would be a real podcast.\n\n01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.040\nWow.\n\n01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:44.040\nLet's see what would happen.\n\n01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:46.040\nYeah, like bring the lights down.\n\n01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:48.040\nLet's podcast this shit for the live audience.\n\n01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:52.040\nAnd the poor fuckers have paid $5 to watch it.\n\n01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:55.040\nWell, no, but they probably feel like a little bit of relief too.\n\n01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:56.040\nOh, they'd love it.\n\n01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.040\nTotal darkness.\n\n01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.040\nCan we take the house lights all the way out?\n\n01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.040\nJust take them down.\n\n01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.040\nThis is as possible.\n\n01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:04.040\nHow low can we go lighting?\n\n01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:08.040\nAnd nobody has like a cosmic sound cue.\n\n01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:10.040\nMeeting me?\n\n01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:12.040\nBut just let it be silent.\n\n01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:16.040\nI mean, unless anyone had an actual...\n\n01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:17.040\nYou can't.\n\n01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.040\nOkay, that's good.\n\n01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.040\nAll right.\n\n01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:21.040\nYou want a cosmic sound cue?\n\n01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.040\nNo, actually, we'll save it for later.\n\n01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:26.040\nThis place is crawling with Nidoran.\n\n01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:29.040\nThey come out in the dark.\n\n01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:41.040\nHow many more times do you think I could do that tonight?\n\n01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:47.040\nI want you to go with me across the cosmos.\n\n01:12:47.040 --> 01:13:04.040\nLeave your body behind.\n\n01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:29.040\nAs you float up to the stratosphere, as you float up to the stars, as you find out your identity.\n\n01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:33.040\nHave an exit plan.\n\n01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:44.040\nAs you continue outside of the blue marble called Earth, it becomes increasingly significant\n\n01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:48.040\nbeneath you.\n\n01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:52.040\nYou see a planet in the side of your eye.\n\n01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:55.040\nYou go toward it.\n\n01:13:55.040 --> 01:14:03.040\nIt seems small at first, but as you approach, it gets medium-sized.\n\n01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:10.040\nFinally larger still, integrity is as big as a thing you've ever seen.\n\n01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:21.040\nYou land on this dirt-covered desert-like planet.\n\n01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:31.040\nThere is only infinity between you and your goal.\n\n01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:43.040\nYou have only a leather-bound satchel filled with three inventory items.\n\n01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:47.040\nYour name is Spencer.\n\n01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:49.040\nOh, shit.\n\n01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:51.040\nI don't have an echo.\n\n01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:56.040\nYou shouldn't.\n\n01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:59.040\nI don't either.\n\n01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:03.040\nThat makes...\n\n01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:11.040\nI don't need you to do anything as I am not I.\n\n01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:15.040\nI am what you would call nothing.\n\n01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:27.040\nHowever, should you choose to take an action declaring so with specific expressions of\n\n01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:36.040\nwhen and why will constitute a player turn,\n\n01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:49.040\nI remind you you are on a red, dusty planet with satchel with three items.\n\n01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:52.040\nSpencer.\n\n01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:54.040\nThat would be great if I left.\n\n01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:57.040\nOh, now I do have an echo.\n\n01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:59.040\nOh, shit.\n\n01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:01.040\nWhat are the items, though?\n\n01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:03.040\nAre we going to die?\n\n01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:06.040\nYou would like to look into the satchel?\n\n01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:09.040\nWell, don't I know what's in them already?\n\n01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:18.040\nWhen you search back in your mind for the answer to questions about what you already know,\n\n01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:23.040\nyou find yourself curiously shortcoming.\n\n01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:25.040\nSo what's in the satchel then?\n\n01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:29.040\nYou only know your name is Spencer and that you have a satchel.\n\n01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:33.040\nYou feel three bulges from within.\n\n01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:36.040\nOh, shit.\n\n01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:39.040\nI throw them in a hole.\n\n01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:44.040\nReaching for the three bulges, you throw the satchel in the hole?\n\n01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.040\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:47.040\nYeah, just toss it in a hole.\n\n01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:49.040\nYou throw the whole satchel?\n\n01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.040\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:51.040\nWhat did you...\n\n01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:56.040\nThen I'm going to take seven steps backwards and then shit.\n\n01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:58.040\nWhy did you not throw anything?\n\n01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.040\nWhat?\n\n01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:00.040\nYou didn't throw anything?\n\n01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:02.040\nNo, no, I threw it first.\n\n01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.040\nYou threw the satchel?\n\n01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.040\nYeah, yeah, and then I shit.\n\n01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.040\nOkay.\n\n01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:11.040\nYou throw the satchel in the hole and take...\n\n01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:14.040\nand take seven steps back.\n\n01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.040\nOkay.\n\n01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:21.040\nThere is a great rumbling, a high-pitched tone that turns into chanting.\n\n01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:32.040\nThe only word of which you can decipher is viscera, viscera, viscera.\n\n01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:34.040\nI run perpendicular.\n\n01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:35.040\nSorry, what?\n\n01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.040\nSorry.\n\n01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.040\nI run perpendicular.\n\n01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:40.040\nYou run perpendicular to the viscera.\n\n01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:55.040\nTo the viscera, as what I was describing continues to happen and a big frog comes out.\n\n01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.040\nWait, we say viscera.\n\n01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:57.040\nIs it like...\n\n01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:58.040\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.040\nWho's this?\n\n01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:00.040\nWhat?\n\n01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:01.040\nWhat?\n\n01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:02.040\nJesus.\n\n01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:03.040\nWho?\n\n01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:04.040\nI show yourself.\n\n01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:05.040\nWho are you?\n\n01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:06.040\nThat's the frog.\n\n01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:07.040\nFrog.\n\n01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:08.040\nSpeak.\n\n01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:11.040\nOr be besmirched.\n\n01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:12.040\nSo...\n\n01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:17.040\nWhat's with all that viscera you're finding yourself in and amongst?\n\n01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:20.040\nSeriously, what is with the viscera?\n\n01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:22.040\nIt's your viscera, assumedly.\n\n01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:37.640\nI leave you both in a plexiglass cube in Universe 232 of Series 7 of Amazing Marvel\n\n01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:38.640\nMan.\n\n01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:43.640\nAnd I float away and I open a card shop.\n\n01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.640\nOh shit.\n\n01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:50.640\nI no longer need players to tell me what happens next.\n\n01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:53.640\nNow I work alone.\n\n01:18:53.640 --> 01:19:03.640\nI wipe the counters brass piping, which gives it a classy but slightly Armenian feel.\n\n01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:09.640\nI hope today's opening day will be a day of opening.\n\n01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:12.640\nHello, are you open?\n\n01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:13.640\nWhat?\n\n01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:15.640\nI open the door.\n\n01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:18.640\nI'm Armenian.\n\n01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:20.640\nI am God.\n\n01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:25.640\nI opened a gift shop for Armenians.\n\n01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:28.640\nI'm looking for some cards for my wife.\n\n01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:30.640\nCome in, come in.\n\n01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:33.640\nHey, I'm the frog you sent back.\n\n01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:34.640\nYou got comics?\n\n01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:35.640\nJesus.\n\n01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:36.640\nJesus.\n\n01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:37.640\nWhat?\n\n01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:39.640\nYou're getting viscera all over the place.\n\n01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:40.640\nTell you.\n\n01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:41.640\nNot my fault.\n\n01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:42.640\nI don't know.\n\n01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.640\nTell you what, tell you what.\n\n01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:46.640\nArmenian customer, go to IO3.\n\n01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:49.640\nOr a big card shop.\n\n01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:51.640\nTake care of the frog.\n\n01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:53.640\nGet out of here.\n\n01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:54.640\nWhy?\n\n01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:55.640\nStop it.\n\n01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:56.640\nWhat?\n\n01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:57.640\nIt's embarrassing.\n\n01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:58.640\nWhy?\n\n01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:00.640\nIt's embarrassing to see me now.\n\n01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:02.640\nIs that what this is about?\n\n01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:04.640\nI've never seen you in the first place.\n\n01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:07.640\nWhy are you in a relationship?\n\n01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:08.640\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:10.640\nWhich way is it?\n\n01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.640\nWhich way is IO3?\n\n01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:14.640\nIO3 is which way?\n\n01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:17.640\nIO3 is the best IO ever.\n\n01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:19.640\nGo ahead.\n\n01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:21.640\nTwo for one today.\n\n01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:23.640\nHave a coupon.\n\n01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:25.640\nWhat the fuck is wrong with you?\n\n01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:27.640\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:28.640\nYou fuck me.\n\n01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:29.640\nYou fuck my life.\n\n01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:31.640\nI'm trying to get control.\n\n01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:32.640\nOver and over.\n\n01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:34.640\nI wanted to open a store.\n\n01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:36.640\nAnd don't give me control.\n\n01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:38.640\nI don't know who you are.\n\n01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:39.640\nYou.\n\n01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:40.640\nYou.\n\n01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:41.640\nYou are on you.\n\n01:20:41.640 -->

01:21:20.640\nThat's what you're calling me now?\n\n01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:21.640\nReally?\n\n01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:22.640\nOh shit.\n\n01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:23.640\nEverything.\n\n01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:24.640\nEverything.\n\n01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:28.640\nEverything I have ever put into this world.\n\n01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.640\nYou have reversed a meactitude.\n\n01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:33.640\nI don't know what you do for a living.\n\n01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:35.640\nYou lived in my guest house?\n\n01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:38.640\nYou said you were a guitarist?\n\n01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:40.640\nThen you were working on an album?\n\n01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:46.440\nI showed you my treatment for a cartoon because you said you had worked at Cartoon Network.\n\n01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:48.640\nYou gave me notes on it.\n\n01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:52.640\nThen I found out you were in Michigan six weeks ago.\n\n01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:53.640\nShingling.\n\n01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:54.640\nShingling.\n\n01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:55.640\nOh hello.\n\n01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:56.640\nDo you guys validate?\n\n01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:57.640\nYes.\n\n01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:00.640\nOh

want to show you something.\n\n01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:20.640\nAll right.\n\n01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:21.640\nZip.\n\n01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:28.640\nI've opened a zipper to the third dimension.\n\n01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:30.640\nWhat else is new?\n\n01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:31.640\nWhoa.\n\n01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:35.640\nHas this whole sketch been taking place in two dimensions?\n\n01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:39.640\nThat just blew my mind.\n\n01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:45.640\nBecause we've been in the darkness this whole time.\n\n01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:46.640\nOver here.\n\n01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:47.640\nShingling.\n\n01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:48.640\nOh shit.\n\n01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:49.640\nOh hello.\n\n01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:51.640\nI can't get my car parked.\n\n01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:52.640\nI'm only on an X and Y axis.\n\n01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:54.640\nI can't get my car.\n\n01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:57.640\nI have to like.\n\n01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:58.640\nOh.\n\n01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.640\nJust go over it.\n\n01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:02.640\nOkay guys thank you.\n\n01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:07.640\nI want to show you the three of you something.\n\n01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:10.640\nLook at this breakfast cereal box.\n\n01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:11.640\nYes.\n\n01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:17.640\nSee the farm and how the sun just peaks above the distant horizon.\n\n01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:18.640\nRight.\n\n01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:19.640\nTwo scoops.\n\n01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:28.640\nWhat if I told you that this box, not the world in which you live, was reality.\n\n01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:36.640\nAnd that we were simulated by the people in the universe on the cover of this box so that\n\n01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:44.640\nthey could feel cosmologically safer by thinking of themselves as being part of a cereal box.\n\n01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:50.640\nAnd that we are the unreal and they the real.\n\n01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:56.640\nWhat if I further told you they had to be with the power to raise their sun.\n\n01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:59.640\nRaise sun.\n\n01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:03.640\nRaise sun.\n\n01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:12.640\nLet the light rise as part of your baby car.\n\n01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:15.640\nOh, shit.\n\n01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:20.640\nSomeone put curtains up on all the walls where the lights were out.\n\n01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.640\nIs that where the red raisin comes from?\n\n01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:23.640\nRaisin the lights?\n\n01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:24.640\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:25.640\nThat's amazing.\n\n01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:27.640\nWhat a bad show, huh?\n\n01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:29.640\nThat was the fucking best thing we've ever done.\n\n01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:30.640\nOh, okay.\n\n01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:36.640\nYeah, that was the best thing we've ever done.\n\n01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:37.640\nWhat do you think, Jacob?\n\n01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:38.640\nI liked it.\n\n01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:41.640\nWhat was with all that viscera?\n\n01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:42.640\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:43.640\nThere was all that viscera.\n\n01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:44.640\nWell, where?\n\n01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:45.640\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:46.640\nAround that frog, I think.\n\n01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:47.640\nHe was chanting viscera.\n\n01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:48.640\nYou were summoning viscera.\n\n01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:51.640\nOh, I was creating a character named viscera.\n\n01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:52.640\nOh.\n\n01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:53.640\nWas that the frog?\n\n01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:54.640\nI think it was literally viscera.\n\n01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:55.640\nLike literally.\n\n01:24:55.640 --> 01:25:02.640\nI was creating like a mythology where like, of course, like the devil analog would be like\n\n01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:03.640\nnamed viscera.\n\n01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:05.640\nIt's just like, it's because it sounds cultural.\n\n01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:06.640\nIt sounds cool.\n\n01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:07.640\nIt just means guts.\n\n01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:08.640\nIt sounds like things like guts and bones and stuff.\n\n01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:10.640\nLike, you know, like a gorge or something.\n\n01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:11.640\nIt was cool.\n\n01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:12.640\nCool choice.\n\n01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:13.640\nIt sounded really cool.\n\n01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:14.640\nYeah, it does.\n\n01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:15.640\nI rifted.\n\n01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:16.640\nNow I get it.\n\n01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:17.640\nIf you guys are saying I'm talented, I don't know.\n\n01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:18.640\nI don't know.\n\n01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:19.640\nI just like getting on this.\n\n01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:22.640\nI want to know if that Armenian character is going to spin off into some sort of supervillain\n\n01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:23.640\nor something.\n\n01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:24.640\nYeah, I want to make it quite.\n\n01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:26.640\nHe's the Joey.\n\n01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:31.640\nThat franchise, the Armenian culture saturation in it is meant to empower.\n\n01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:34.640\nIt's like the Rubik's Cube TV series in the 80s.\n\n01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:36.640\nIt was very Latino for no reason.\n\n01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:41.640\nIt was just like a bunch of three Latino kids with a Rubik's Cube.\n\n01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:46.640\nCheck out Harmontown episode 43.\n\n01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:48.640\nOkay.\n\n01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:51.640\nSo, all right.\n\n01:25:51.640 --> 01:26:02.640\nHere's the thing.\n\n01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:10.640\nI don't believe in gravity.\n\n01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:11.640\nNo?\n\n01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:12.640\nOkay.\n\n01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:13.640\nAnd that provocative enough.\n\n01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:14.640\nLet me look something up.\n\n01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:16.640\nDo you believe in time?\n\n01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:17.640\nNo.\n\n01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:18.640\nYeah.\n\n01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:19.640\nSpeak on that.\n\n01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:21.640\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:22.640\nYou don't believe in it.\n\n01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:23.640\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:25.640\nWho would?\n\n01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:28.640\nThat's a weird thing to think.\n\n01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:31.640\nHave you gotten the impression that I don't believe in time?\n\n01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:32.640\nYeah.\n\n01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:33.640\nReally?\n\n01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:34.640\nMm-hmm.\n\n01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:35.640\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:38.640\nYou talk about having a weird relationship with time, don't you?\n\n01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:40.640\nI guess I don't really...\n\n01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:43.640\nOh, you talk about love.\n\n01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:46.640\nIt's not amusing to anybody but me.\n\n01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:50.640\nYou mean the way that most people measure it by days and months but I measure it by\n\n01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:52.640\ngirlfriends and jobs?\n\n01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:53.640\nNo.\n\n01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:56.640\nSure, yeah.\n\n01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:06.640\nHave you guys ever...I spent a day going down a...anybody here into creepy pasta?\n\n01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:09.640\nYeah.\n\n01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:13.640\nSo is there good...who would call themselves like an aficionado of it?\n\n01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.640\nWhat do you want to know about it?\n\n01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:17.640\nWell, like I was hoping to meet a new friend but...\n\n01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:18.640\nI'm just wondering.\n\n01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:19.640\nOkay.\n\n01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:21.640\nI only know trash.\n\n01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:22.640\nOkay.\n\n01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:23.640\nWell, all right.\n\n01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:25.640\nSo I thought maybe somebody would be like a super...\n\n01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:26.640\nWhat do you mean by creepy pasta?\n\n01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:29.640\nWell, it's like a thing that's like...like I went down a...\n\n01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:31.640\nIt's like urban legends.\n\n01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:35.640\nIt's like urban myths on Reddit and like Fort Shanna thinks what it is, isn't it?\n\n01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:36.640\nYep.\n\n01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:38.640\nIt's like...it was like the Dead Bart episode considered creepy pasta.\n\n01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:40.640\nYou might know that one.\n\n01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:41.640\nDead Bart.\n\n01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:42.640\nYeah.\n\n01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:44.640\nNo, that's allegedly this myth that like...\n\n01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:49.640\nMatt Groening gave some guy like...it's intermittent period of time and episode where Bart dies\n\n01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:51.640\nand apparently Fox didn't want to air it.\n\n01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:53.640\nIt's not true but that's like the kind of stuff it is.\n\n01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:56.640\nI think he was like, was it Slender Man star off as that too?\n\n01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:57.640\nYeah.\n\n01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:00.640\nYou know, it's like...it's basically like the internet version of like, you know, urban myths.\n\n01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:01.640\nIt just...\n\n01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:03.640\nIt's like the Ben Drown thing, Majora's Master.\n\n01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:04.640\nWhich one was that?\n\n01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.640\nSo it's sort of like, you're raising your hand.\n\n01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:07.640\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:08.640\nYou're raising your hand.\n\n01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:09.640\nOkay, fuck it.\n\n01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:10.640\nFuck it.\n\n01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:11.640\nYou're coming on stage.\n\n01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:12.640\nYou've been raising your hand the whole time.\n\n01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:13.640\nWhat's your name, hand-raiser?\n\n01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:14.640\nDustin.\n\n01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:15.640\nDustin, get up here.\n\n01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:16.640\nThe man who comes to know us is three in the morning.\n\n01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:17.640\nThat guy.\n\n01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:18.640\nFor better or worse.\n\n01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:20.640\nI don't know anything about creepy pasta.\n\n01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:21.640\nOh, great.\n\n01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:22.640\nWell, good.\n\n01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:25.640\nI just want to be your new friend.\n\n01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:30.640\nLet everyone who also wants to come on stage take note of what just happened.\n\n01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:33.640\nYou see what you could do if you just stick your mind to it.\n\n01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:34.640\nAre we friends now?\n\n01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:35.640\nOkay, yeah.\n\n01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:36.640\nHey, what's your name?\n\n01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:37.640\nHey.\n\n01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:38.640\nYeah.\n\n01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:40.640\nBut you just go, no, you can't do that.\n\n01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:41.640\nSit down.\n\n01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:42.640\nYou can't...\n\n01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:43.640\nYou can't say I didn't...\n\n01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:44.640\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:45.640\nYou, you're fine.\n\n01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:46.640\nWait, what?\n\n01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:47.640\nWhat do you know about creepy pasta?\n\n01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:48.640\nYou didn't know anything about creepy pasta.\n\n01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:49.640\nYou just came up.\n\n01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:50.640\nRight.\n\n01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:51.640\nThat's what I was saying.\n\n01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:52.640\nWell, that's...\n\n01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:53.640\nThat's what he rejected.\n\n01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:54.640\nYeah.\n\n01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:55.640\nAgain, you're going

01:29:20.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:21.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:22.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:23.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:24.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:25.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:26.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:27.640\nYes.\n\n01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:28.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:29.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:30.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:31.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:32.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:33.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:34.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:35.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:36.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:37.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:38.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:39.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:40.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:41.640\nDo I just...\n\n01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:42.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:43.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:44.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:45.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:46.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:47.640\nNo.\n\n01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:48.640\nI didn't know that.\n\n01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:53.640\nThat's the sound that every serial killer hears in his head going back and forth.\n\n01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:54.640\nThat's it.\n\n01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:55.640\nLike, those...\n\n01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.640\nI'm proud of that, actually.\n\n01:29:57.640 --> 01:29:58.640\nLike, he's Robert F. Kennedy.\n\n01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:00.640\nYeah, but don't you think he should die?\n\n01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:01.640\nI don't know what to do.\n\n01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:02.640\nHe's still a Kennedy.\n\n01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:03.640\nYeah, but I think he should die.\n\n01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:04.640\nI mean, that's Deadpool.\n\n01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:05.640\nThat's Deadpool.\n\n01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:06.640\nUh...\n\n01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:08.640\nWhat's sir Han?\n\n01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:09.640\nSir Han.\n\n01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:13.640\nFirst of all, what's your name, pink-haired gal?\n\n01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:14.640\nI'm Molly.\n\n01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:15.640\nMolly, hello.\n\n01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:16.640\nAnd your name, sir?\n\n01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:17.640\nNickname's Panda.\n\n01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:18.640\nPanda.\n\n01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:19.640\nYour nickname is Panda.\n\n01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:20.640\nYes.\n\n01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:22.640\nSo we can affectionately call you Panda here.\n\n01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:23.640\nThat's totally fine.\n\n01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:24.640\nSo we got Molly, Panda, and Jacob.\n\n01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:25.640\nAll right.\n\n01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:26.640\nYep.\n\n01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:27.640\nI like what's going on here.\n\n01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:28.640\nAll right.\n\n01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:29.640\nWhat was your name, guy that we shut down?\n\n01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:30.640\nDustin.\n\n01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:31.640\nDustin.\n\n01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:32.640\nYour voice is so...\n\n01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:33.640\nLike, you should be in the opera.\n\n01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:34.640\nHe is in the opera.\n\n01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:35.640\nWhy are you holding a pencil?\n\n01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:36.640\nOh, he's been holding it all night.\n\n01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:37.640\nHe's been holding it all night.\n\n01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:38.640\nOh, shit.\n\n01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:39.640\nHe has not put it down for a second.\n\n01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:40.640\nThis helps me do my job.\n\n01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:41.640\nDustin, why are the rage, man?\n\n01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:42.640\nWhat's going on?\n\n01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:43.640\nSeriously, why?\n\n01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:46.640\nWhy the rage towards the pencil?\n\n01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:48.640\nWhat pencil do to you?\n\n01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:50.640\nI just want to be loved.\n\n01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:51.640\nHow's it going?\n\n01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:53.640\nDon't go to elementary school three in the morning.\n\n01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:54.640\nThat's simple.\n\n01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:56.640\nWe all want to be loved.\n\n01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:57.640\nAll right.\n\n01:30:57.640 --> 01:31:04.640\nJust stop reacting to Dustin, which I know is your worst nightmare.\n\n01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:10.640\nI know that a nurse said that as you were just coming out.\n\n01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:14.640\nAnd that's why the fuse was lit.\n\n01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:16.640\nI'm kidding.\n\n01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:20.640\nI'm drunk and high, and I shouldn't have a podcast.\n\n01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:21.640\nThat's why we pay to see you.\n\n01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:23.640\nCertainly, there's urban myths.\n\n01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:24.640\nAll right.\n\n01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:27.640\nSo, Slender Man is a good example of good creepypasta, meaning it.\n\n01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:30.640\nAnd so, when we say creepypasta, do we mean a genre?\n\n01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:31.640\nWe mean a medium?\n\n01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:33.640\nWe mean as if we're saying urban legends.\n\n01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:38.640\nWe're kind of meaning an internet-based urban legend.\n\n01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:40.640\nYeah, it's a meme.\n\n01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:42.640\nIt's a meme.\n\n01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:45.640\nIt is a meme, but it's essentially, as you've stated, right?\n\n01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:47.640\nIt's urban myths in a different format.\n\n01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:49.640\nSo, it's mostly people writing scary-\n\n01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:52.640\nIt's meant to be consumed on the internet.\n\n01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:53.640\nUsually.\n\n01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:59.640\nAnd so, the successful ones are kind of more, they're better consumed on the internet.\n\n01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:02.640\nSo, the Slender Man success was like, shit.\n\n01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:04.640\nI think that was a successful one, actually.\n\n01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:05.640\nNo, there's a couple.\n\n01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:07.640\nI mean, the Bart one you mentioned is also pretty popular.\n\n01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:09.640\nI mean, Slender Man was actually made into games.\n\n01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:11.640\nI mean, I remember...\n\n01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:12.640\nIt's popular.\n\n01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:13.640\nYes.\n\n01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:15.640\nI mean, little actual studios developed Slender Man games.\n\n01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:21.640\nThe Bart one's just, you know, a prevalent urban myth that's called creepypasta.\n\n01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:23.640\nYou mentioned one from Majora's Mask, right?\n\n01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:26.640\nNot simply with that one, but I do know you're talking about.\n\n01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:29.640\nThat seems to be just...\n\n01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:31.640\nWhy is it called creepypasta?\n\n01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:32.640\nI don't know.\n\n01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:36.640\nCopypasta is a thing that means you just repost content.\n\n01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:38.640\nIt's what you do with memes, essentially.\n\n01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:39.640\nYou copy and taste the memes.\n\n01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:40.640\nThe more you know.\n\n01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:42.640\nAnd if it's a creepy copypasta, well, there you go.\n\n01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:47.640\nFourth of July weekend, I had my laptop open and Cody will sleep.\n\n01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:49.640\nShe'll sleep as long as...\n\n01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:51.640\nShe'll just sleep.\n\n01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:56.640\nBut she also likes to listen to stuff, and I just went through this weird thing where I started listening to...\n\n01:32:56.640 --> 01:33:03.640\nI went to Illuminati videos, and then from there, I went down this hole to...\n\n01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:08.640\nIt was true horror stories, like 20...\n\n01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:09.640\nBut it was like...\n\n01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:12.640\nI went to this really specific section of the drain that was basically like...\n\n01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:17.640\nIt was kind of like Tumblr, and it was all the protagonists were female,\n\n01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:23.640\nand it was like really ultra believable stories of like 16-year-old girls ending up at the wrong party.\n\n01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:24.640\nWas it the porno?\n\n01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:25.640\nIt wasn't, no.\n\n01:33:25.640 -->

Something blind.\n\n01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:29.640\nI gotcha. I love this game.\n\n01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:30.640\nAll right, you guys.\n\n01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:33.640\nAll right, tell me what you're familiar with, young people.\n\n01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:38.640\nI'm just gonna say a phrase.\n\n01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:42.640\nLike, because I just watched watching like YouTube videos of like 20 things,\n\n01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:43.640\nthat this and 15 things with that.\n\n01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:45.640\nSo...\n\n01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:47.640\nThat's another good one, yeah.\n\n01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:49.640\nE-E-E-V-P body of a pig.\n\n01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:53.640\nLike, you guys watch the E-V-P videos of body of a pig.\n\n01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:55.640\nAnd it's like a, you know what E-V-P is?\n\n01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:58.640\nIt's like the ghost hunter thing where you like wave a thing around you here.\n\n01:34:58.640 --> 01:34:59.640\nOh, Alan.\n\n01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:00.640\nYeah, it's just like a creepy video.\n\n01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:03.640\nIt's like, you can swear that you hear the body of a pig.\n\n01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:05.640\nWho cares?\n\n01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:08.640\nHave you guys seen the Croatian stocking tape?\n\n01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:11.640\nOh, is that the one with the truck where they're going backwards?\n\n01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:16.640\nNo, no, no. The creepy dude with the hood, like a hood over his face.\n\n01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:20.640\nThat's like, it's just like, it's just like sort of a weird found footage.\n\n01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:23.640\nLike, it's on the bubble between like, obviously this is fake and staged,\n\n01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:28.640\nbut at the same time, like, it hasn't, there's no need to expose it,\n\n01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:32.640\nbecause it, and therefore, I don't know, I don't know,\n\n01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:34.640\nI'm just curious about this like finger of mythology,\n\n01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:37.640\nbecause I spent the day like looking up these videos, like,\n\n01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:40.640\nso there's a video where there's like two Croatian dudes that are doing parkour\n\n01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:42.640\nin a park or something.\n\n01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:45.640\nAnd then there's like this guy that keeps appearing in the distance,\n\n01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:48.640\nand he has like a weird hood over his face.\n\n01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:52.640\nAnd like, it's just, it's, I think it's probably because you can't tell,\n\n01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:56.640\nit probably makes it seem more genuine if you don't speak their language,\n\n01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:58.640\nso it seems more real.\n\n01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:02.640\nAnd so there's, and there's just like this weird guy like following them,\n\n01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:06.640\nand they're kind of reacting to him as if he's an old drunk man from the village or something,\n\n01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:09.640\nbut he's, you're like freaking out, and he like follows them.\n\n01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:12.640\nAnd then the whole thing ends with like, they open an elevator in there.\n\n01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:14.640\nThat just sounds like a regular day in Eastern Europe.\n\n01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:16.640\nThat's true.\n\n01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:18.640\nIt sounds like it follows to me.\n\n01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:22.640\nI just, I was trying to like these, these horror, these horror movie things,\n\n01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:27.640\nlike, okay, so Japanese ghost hospital is like a thing like that.\n\n01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:28.640\nNo, yeah.\n\n01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:31.640\nHas anybody seen this like, like, and then some of them,\n\n01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:34.640\nthen you look in the comment sections and it says like, some people go like,\n\n01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:36.640\nthis is an ARG, this is an ARG.\n\n01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:37.640\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:39.640\nAnd I looked that up and it's like, oh, it's an alternate reality.\n\n01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:44.640\nYeah, I was going to talk, like Neurocam was the thing that got me into this like creepy shit,\n\n01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:49.640\nbecause it was real and there's just people that would like watch you and stuff\n\n01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:54.640\nand weird creepy videos and you go and wear masks and play chess with people\n\n01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:57.640\nand put a USB stick in a wall and like, it was really happening.\n\n01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:00.640\nAnd that's like, and that was happening around the time.\n\n01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:03.640\nI was getting into 4chan and stuff, but like, that was like this,\n\n01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:06.640\nit turned out to be an art project

videos.\n\n01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:19.640\nAnd then you go to like, like, oh, look, Michelle Obama's a reptile.\n\n01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:20.640\nAnd you kind of like, okay.\n\n01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:24.640\nAnd you keep going and it's like, you're always looking at the, like, the thing that's\n\n01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:27.640\nlike, suggested for you in the corner because you've gone down that hole.\n\n01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:28.640\nAnd I'm just like, like, I'm 43.\n\n01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:30.640\nAnd I'm just, I'm just doing this.\n\n01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:34.640\nAnd I'm like, the stuff that was like really became satisfying for me was the fact that\n\n01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:38.640\nit was, then I went to these things that were like, oh, there's a new need for urban legends\n\n01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:40.640\nand there's slender man and all that stuff.\n\n01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:45.640\nBut deep beneath that, the things that were actually kind of like, like actually affecting\n\n01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:50.640\nme, it was weird because it was like also like, it was, it was these, that's the thing\n\n01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:54.640\nI was talking about was that there were these horror story, this is horror story genre,\n\n01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:59.640\nwhere it's like, these are real true stories that are like scary and they're like playing\n\n01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:07.640\nhorror music, but it's really just a, it's, it's like a teenage girl in modern society\n\n01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:15.640\ndescribing a fucking freaky brush with like a, like a crazy person that they ran up against\n\n01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:20.640\nthat, that, that, but it's, it's typically as far as I could find, it was a dude reading\n\n01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:25.640\nthe, the story because the stories are popular in some environment and it's like sort of\n\n01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:31.640\nlike, it's merged with creepy pasta, but these are like the truer the stories are, the more\n\n01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:38.640\nvaluable they are and it's like, like, but then there's like these compilations that are\n\n01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:45.640\nedited together where there's like a 35 year old guy reading the stories into a microphone\n\n01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:53.640\nabout, I was, I was just out of high school and I wanted to have some fun, my girlfriends\n\n01:41:53.640 --> 01:42:01.640\nwere a little more loose than me, I like reading and just want to get into a good college, so\n\n01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:07.640\nwhen they said we wanted to take MDMA and go to a local party, I only wanted to go to\n\n01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:13.640\nmake sure they didn't get into trouble, when we pulled up to the house there was already\n\n01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:18.640\na creepy air, the man, and it just keeps up, but it's like, it sounds like Alec Baldwin\n\n01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:24.640\nreading the story, but it, it's like just, what is my point? I don't know, it sounds\n\n01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:26.640\nlike a genuine, like, fan fiction.\n\n01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:30.640\nI'm more worried about the fact that all the reptile videos are so poor quality, you ever\n\n01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:31.640\nnoticed that?\n\n01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:32.640\nThat's kind of the point though.\n\n01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:33.640\nIt's like found footage being crappy.\n\n01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:36.640\nNo, it's not that one, it's like, all these people believe in the, you know, the reptile\n\n01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:39.640\nconspiracy nonsense, I don't know if anybody's made with that one.\n\n01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:40.640\nBigfoot.\n\n01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:44.640\nIt's a really, really little quality of myself, like, do you just not have any cameras that\n\n01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:47.640\nare older than 15 years, like, anything newer than 15 years old or something?\n\n01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:49.640\nNo, but we're, I don't know why, but...\n\n01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:53.640\nIt sells the authenticity of it, it's like, why buy a distress shirt at $50, it's more\n\n01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:54.640\nauthentic.\n\n01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:56.640\nI don't know, it's just, I think it's probably weird.\n\n01:42:56.640 --> 01:42:57.640\nAlso, when cameras got better...\n\n01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:00.640\nWe have to do a thing, you guys are both smart, so you can do this for me, right?\n\n01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:05.640\nLike, let's do a thing, like, pretend, like, okay, just pretend you're both in my head,\n\n01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:06.640\nand...\n\n01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:08.640\nCan I be your sexy side?\n\n01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:13.640\nLike, you guys find your own, like, dichotomy, because that's part of the appeal, is that\n\n01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:15.640\nI don't think, I don't need to force it.\n\n01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:22.640\nLike, I think, even, like, like, I'm shopping for, I'm just shopping for, I don't want to,\n\n01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:24.640\nI don't want to set you guys up to fail.\n\n01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:32.640\nLike, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm just like, I'm just looking at apples, I'm just looking at it.\n\n01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:33.640\nNo, that's not, that's not good.\n\n01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:34.640\nSorry.\n\n01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:35.640\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:37.640\nOkay, you guys are both enthusiastic about apples.\n\n01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:38.640\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:43.640\nSo, you guys are my inside out, like, like, but don't assume, like, there's,

at a bushel of apples.\n\n01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:56.640\nWhat is Molly?\n\n01:43:56.640 --> 01:43:57.640\nWhat?\n\n01:43:57.640 --> 01:43:58.640\nWhat am I doing?\n\n01:43:58.640 --> 01:43:59.640\nOh,

apples that I like to grow here.\n\n01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:28.640\nOne is a very tart, juicy green apple.\n\n01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:33.640\nThere's a very, very specific kind of rare green apple that I like to have.\n\n01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:36.640\nIt has a very nice hint of tennis ball in it.\n\n01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:37.640\nThey're apples.\n\n01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:38.640\nWhat's with the sales pitch?\n\n01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:39.640\nOkay.\n\n01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:40.640\nAll right.\n\n01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:41.640\nSo, and then...\n\n01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:42.640\nOn the other side...\n\n01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:43.640\nWe're hungry.\n\n01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:44.640\nWe're hungry.\n\n01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:47.640\nOn the other side, we got some...\n\n01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:50.640\nActually, my IRL favorite apples...\n\n01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:51.640\nIRL, really?\n\n01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:52.640\nIRL.\n\n01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:53.640\nIRL.\n\n01:45:53.640 -->

choose between green apples and red apples first off.\n\n01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:05.640\nBut both of them sound really good.\n\n01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:06.640\nWell, no.\n\n01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:07.640\nRed.\n\n01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:08.640\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:09.640\nRed.\n\n01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:10.640\nRed.\n\n01:46:10.640 -->

harnessed.\n\n01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:01.280\nIt was an organic thing.\n\n01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:04.280\nIt was fun and I tried to make it into a thing and it didn't work.\n\n01:48:04.280 -->

have gone for green.\n\n01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:18.640\nWhite green.\n\n01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:19.640\nWhat?\n\n01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:20.640\nSeriously, white green.\n\n01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:21.640\nPain is beautiful.\n\n01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:24.640\nIt has nothing to do with pain.\n\n01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:28.080\nWho else has IRL and trying to sell you apples?\n\n01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:33.320\nShe's, she's a hip, I don't know, well it sounds like she's just wandered onto someone's\n\n01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:34.320\nproperty.\n\n01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:35.920\nI don't know that she was trying to sell apples.\n\n01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:38.120\nYou don't believe she could be an apple.\n\n01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:40.640\nShe was just reacting to the shifting situation.\n\n01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:41.640\nI have signs.\n\n01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:42.640\nOh.\n\n01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:43.640\nThat wasn't clear.\n\n01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:44.640\nYou're my apple orchard.\n\n01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:45.640\nThat's the point.\n\n01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:47.480\nIt wasn't clear, right?\n\n01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:48.480\nYeah.\n\n01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:51.400\nIt wasn't clear and I'm right.\n\n01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:52.400\nWe could agree to that.\n\n01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:59.520\nAnd this place is crawling with Nitteran.\n\n01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:01.800\nSee this is how you do a comedy show.\n\n01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:03.800\nAll right.\n\n01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:05.300\nWell, okay.\n\n01:49:05.300 --> 01:49:10.200\nDan, play both characters in your head of the choice between the hand, the air dryer\n\n01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:13.000\nand the paper, the brown paper towels.\n\n01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:14.000\nLike what?\n\n01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.000\nNo, no.\n\n01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.000\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000\nNo.\n\n01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.000\nI think that was maybe a low stakes conundrum.\n\n01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:21.000\nI thought you were going to go like, oh, a million dollars.\n\n01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.000\nNo.\n\n01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000\nOkay.\n\n01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.000\nLike a real quantity.\n\n01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.000\nThere's a million dollars.\n\n01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000\nNo.\n\n01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.000\nI don't, no.\n\n01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:28.000\nLet's try it a third time.\n\n01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:29.000\nThat's it yet.\n\n01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:30.000\nLet's just, let's just.\n\n01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.000\nThird time to charm.\n\n01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000\nLet's just wipe it.\n\n01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.000\nLike, okay.\n\n01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.000\nI'm waking up in the morning.\n\n01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.000\nI'm waking up in the morning.\n\n01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.000\nOh, God.\n\n01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:37.000\nDamn.\n\n01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000\nFuck.\n\n01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.000\nSo early.\n\n01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000\nGet up.\n\n01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:41.000\nPut on my shoes.\n\n01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:42.000\nFirst?\n\n01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:43.000\nHow do you know they're not slippers?\n\n01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:44.000\nGo over there.\n\n01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.000\nMake some toast.\n\n01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:46.000\nLet's get put on my shoes first.\n\n01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.000\nThey don't like to be slippers.\n\n01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.000\nI don't see what.\n\n01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.000\nMaking some toast.\n\n01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:50.000\nMaybe light brown.\n\n01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.000\nI don't like to do that.\n\n01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:52.000\nNo.\n\n01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.000\nKeep it dark.\n\n01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:54.000\nThat's fine.\n\n01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.000\nI'm just going to go like this.\n\n01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.000\nAll right.\n\n01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.000\nAll right.\n\n01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.000\nAll right.\n\n01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.000\nAll right.\n\n01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.000\nAll right.\n\n01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000\nAll right.\n\n01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.000\nAll right.\n\n01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.000\nAll right.\n\n01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.000\nAll right.\n\n01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.000\nAll right.\n\n01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.000\nAll right.\n\n01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.000\nNo, keep it dark.\n\n01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:12.000\nJust tastes like bread at that point.\n\n01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.000\nSucks.\n\n01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.000\nAll right.\n\n01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.000\nToast us up.\n\n01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000\nGo over to the refrigerator.\n\n01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000\nHe doesn't listen to any of the words.\n\n01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:22.000\nGet some butter.\n\n01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000\nButters for busies.\n\n01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:25.000\nMarmalade.\n\n01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.000\nThank you.\n\n01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.000\nYes.\n\n01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.000\nMarmalade.\n\n01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.000\nMarmalade.\n\n01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.000\nThat's nothing.\n\n01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.000\nDarker.\n\n01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.000\nGrape.\n\n01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:33.000\nGrape.\n\n01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:34.000\nJelly.\n\n01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.000\nGrape.\n\n01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:38.000\nI'm going to get some marmalade.\n\n01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.000\nWait.\n\n01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:40.000\nNo.\n\n01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.000\nIt's like grape jam.\n\n01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.000\nYeah.\n\n01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.000\nYeah.\n\n01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:44.000\nYeah.\n\n01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.000\nNice and slow.\n\n01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:46.000\nAll right.\n\n01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.000\nOkay.\n\n01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.000\nThat's good.\n\n01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.000\nWell, time to go to work.\n\n01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.000\nOpen this.\n\n01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.000\nDon't run people over.\n\n01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:52.000\nI know you want to, but don't run people over.\n\n01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:53.000\nNo, just run them over.\n\n01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.000\nYou're semi-famous.\n\n01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:56.000\nYou might be able to get away with it.\n\n01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:09.000\nIt's a good day to wear nothing but shoes.\n\n01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000\nGet inside the car.\n\n01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.000\nClose the door.\n\n01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:13.000\nStart driving.\n\n01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:14.000\nHow's it going?\n\n01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:15.000\nHow are you doing?\n\n01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.000\nOh, it's been a while.\n\n01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:17.000\nIt's been a while.\n\n01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:18.000\nIt's been a while.\n\n01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:19.000\nIt's been a while.\n\n01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.000\nIt's been a while.\n\n01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000\nIt's been a while.\n\n01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000\nIt's been a while.\n\n01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.000\nIt's been a while.\n\n01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000\nIt's been a while.\n\n01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000\nHow are you doing?\n\n01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.000\nOh, Spencer.\n\n01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:28.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:29.000\nHey.\n\n01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000\nWhat is he doing here?\n\n01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.000\nWhat the hell is he doing here?\n\n01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000\nI'm driving.\n\n01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000\nCan I have one of those ice cream cones?\n\n01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:35.000\nYeah.\n\n01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.000\nOh.\n\n01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.000\nTake one.\n\n01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.000\nDamn it.\n\n01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:39.000\nEvery day you ask for one.\n\n01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.000\nThanks, man.\n\n01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.000\nReally?\n\n01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000\nWhy?\n\n01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.000\nBecause he dates us.\n\n01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.000\nWe need to kill him.\n\n01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:45.000\nYou're right.\n\n01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:46.000\nWe do, but the question is how?\n\n01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000\nI mean, how do we get away with it?\n\n01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000\nNeedle rings.\n\n01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000\nHow did that help us?\n\n01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000\nWhat the fuck was that?\n\n01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:54.000\nWhat the fuck was that?\n\n01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:55.000\nOh, shit.\n\n01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000\nHey, I rolled my window down.\n\n01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.000\nIt's not your kill.\n\n01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.000\nIt's Knight Rider.\n\n01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.000\nYes, it is.\n\n01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:01.000\nI'm an Armenian guy.\n\n01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.000\nI just got a free car.\n\n01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:07.000\nGot a free car from our last sketch we were in.\n\n01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:10.000\nYou want to race an Armenian guy?\n\n01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:11.000\nDad Hammond?\n\n01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:12.000\nOh, an Armenian guy.\n\n01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.000\nDo you want some apples?\n\n01:52:15.000 -->

01:52:21.000\nWhat is this place to come from?\n\n01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.000\nWhat is going on here?\n\n01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000\nSpencer raised the guy.\n\n01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000\nOh, well, I think we're winning.\n\n01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000\nHe's buying apples.\n\n01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000\nOh, you piece of shit.\n\n01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:31.000\nYeah.\n\n01:52:31.000 -->

over.\n\n01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:36.000\nDon't run people over.\n\n01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:37.000\nGo, go, go.\n\n01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.000\nAll right.\n\n01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.000\nSpencer, take me to work.\n\n01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.000\nAll right.\n\n01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.000\nI'm going to have to use the turbo boost.\n\n01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000\nThis guy fucking sucks at driving.\n\n01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000\nYes, he does.\n\n01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.000\nWhat do I pay him for?\n\n01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000\nMan, I need a raise.\n\n01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000\nAlso, I've been drinking.\n\n01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000\nWhat else is new?\n\n01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:54.000\nShit.\n\n01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:57.000\nWhat do you have to think about that?\n\n01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000\nOh, well, oh, oh, oh.\n\n01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.000\nYeah, I should give you a raise.\n\n01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.000\nI'm going to give you a raise.\n\n01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:02.000\nDo you work hard?\n\n01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:03.000\nYeah, right.\n\n01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:04.000\nBullshit.\n\n01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:05.000\nI'm not going to
