Does like Big Bang Theory get the cars?\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:19.000\nWell, I'm sure Big Bang Theory gets all, yeah.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:23.000\nI mean, that's an actual profitable, like, actual thing.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:25.000\nLike, I don't know.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:27.000\nYou'd have to, I mean, you know, we should have Bill Pradeon.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:33.000\nHe's the showrunner for Big Bang Theory and ostensibly my nemesis,\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:36.000\nbut we like each other and I should have him come up here\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:39.000\nand talk about what it's like to run Big Bang Theory,\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:42.000\nbecause I'm constantly cursing it like the Red Baron.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:47.000\nBut it would be interesting to know what it's like to work over there.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:50.000\nAnd I know, yeah, I have no idea.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:52.000\nI'd be speaking way outside my jurisdiction.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:58.000\nI just know that in general, you know, God, there was, you know,\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:02.000\nwhen I was a kid watching TV, there was three networks.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:04.000\nJust three.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:08.000\nAnd then there was your local UHF station with some yahoo like Jim Henson\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:10.000\ndoing some weird shit on it,\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:14.000\nbecause he hit the bricks with a suitcase full of tapes of Kermit the Frog\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:16.000\nand said, can we do this syndicated?\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:18.000\nBut there was three networks.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:21.000\nAnd those three networks basically cooperated.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:23.000\nSo it was like, battle of the network stars.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:26.000\nIt was Scott Mayo fighting the Hulk on a high wire.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:29.000\nEverything was just a big fuck you to the consumer.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:32.000\nIt was like, what are you going to take your business elsewhere? It's a talking car.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:35.000\nPlus the chick's hot. Fuck off.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:38.000\nWhich also created the classic television.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:40.000\nI miss Sherwood Schwartz in Gilligan's Island,\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:43.000\nbecause that motherfucker didn't care what he needed to do.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:45.000\nHe wanted you to watch that show.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:47.000\nThe Harlem Globetrotters are on the island tonight.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:49.000\nWell, that's the interesting thing.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:50.000\nThat's good.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:53.000\nIn the age of the three networks, you had Mary Tyler Moore,\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:57.000\nwho created this collective of creatives.\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:59.000\nThat little kitty cat, meow.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:01.000\nThat's an MTM.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:04.000\nThat's Mary Tyler Moore, who, like Charlie Chaplin before her,\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:07.000\ncreated a collective of artists.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:10.000\nHer whole goal was to say, we're the creatives.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:13.000\nWe need to be able to swing a heavier dick than these rich people\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:15.000\nwho just pay to do nothing.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:18.000\nAnd at the same time as her, Norman Lear,\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:23.000\nthe time of total monopolization,\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:25.000\nthere was more conscientiousness,\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:28.000\nmore creative passion on the part of some of these people.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:29.000\nThat's the odd thing.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:33.000\nBut the fragmentation of all this media,\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:35.000\nyou would not be able to have a Breaking Bad\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:38.000\non network TV in 1980, obviously,\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:39.000\nfor obvious reasons,\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.000\nbecause there's 25 million people watching,\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:44.000\npossibly if you're the lowest-rating show,\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:45.000\nthe rate-rated show.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:48.000\nSo there's no way anyone's going to green-light Breaking Bad\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:50.000\nin 1980.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:52.000\nSo you get, who cares?\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:53.000\nLet's move on to something else.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:56.000\nI took a poop the other day.\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:58.000\nGo on.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:01.000\nYou want to know about TV? Google TV. Jesus Christ.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:03.000\nI'm sure there's stuff on the internet about TV.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:05.000\nWhat am I talking about?\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:09.000\nThis is a big jackass talking about TV.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:11.000\nI took the biggest poop.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:15.000\nYou cannot find that on Google.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:17.000\nI don't care. You can Google it all you want.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:18.000\nBig poop.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:19.000\nI didn't really take a big poop.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:22.000\nI was kidding.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:25.000\nDon't tease us like that, man.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:27.000\nYou know what I was kind of interested in doing,\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:28.000\nbecause it was the first time that, you know,\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:30.000\nthe community fans are here.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:33.000\nI don't doubt that a lot of Harmontown attendees\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:35.000\nare probably, I don't kid myself.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:36.000\nI'm sure the only reason they're here\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:37.000\nis because they watch community.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:40.000\nBut at the same time, there is a division.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:43.000\nThere's like a, you know, there's Harmontown fans,\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:44.000\nand there's community fans,\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:48.000\nand there's a big old Venn diagram cleavage in the middle.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:50.000\nBut there's also separation,\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:52.000\nlike a huge community fan.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:54.000\nArguably, the biggest community fan in the world\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:56.000\nwould have a huge reason to be like,\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.000\nfuck Dan Harmon.\n\n07:58.000 --> 07:59.000\nFuck that guy.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:02.000\nAnd I would see, you know, every once in a while,\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:04.000\nI open my mouth, and I say something in a subcomment\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nof this comment section on Reddit.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nLike, for instance, I care about my show,\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:11.000\nand I think it's stupid when people tell me it sucks\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nand they can eat poop and fuck off and die.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nLike, and here's how that makes me feel,\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:17.000\nbecause I'm a human being that has a heartbeat\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:18.000\nand is going to die one day\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:22.000\nand doesn't want to go to my God liar.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:26.000\nAnd then everything's fine in that subreddit,\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:27.000\nand it seems perfectly fine,\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:29.000\nand then someone goes like,\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:36.000\nif I reprinted this in my dumbass blog,\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:43.000\nI could get like a million pennies.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:45.000\nAnd then it all gets out of control.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:48.000\nThe end result is always that\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:50.000\nthere's a lot of community fans, I think,\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:53.000\nand I know, because I see on Twitter,\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.000\nthey literally will go,\n\n08:55.000 --> 09:00.000\nhe needs to stop talking.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:03.000\nWhat percentage of the feedback is that?\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:04.000\nI don't know.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:05.000\nWhat does Twitter represent?\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:06.000\nWhat do the community fans represent?\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:09.000\nOne million pennies.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:11.000\nIs our top community fan,\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:16.000\nis the, like, that was a quote from,\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:21.000\nI can't pronounce her Twitter name.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:24.000\nIs she here?\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nWait, the stop talking lady is here?\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:27.000\nThe stop talking lady is here.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:30.000\nHe needs to stop talking.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:36.000\nWhy would you come to this show?\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:39.000\nThat's all it is.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:41.000\nThat's what I wanted to do.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:43.000\nWould you be willing to come up\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:49.000\nand talk about how I shouldn't?\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:51.000\nWell, if we're going to have this conversation,\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:52.000\nyou have to come up on stage.\n\n09:52.000 --> 10:06.000\nStop talking, lady.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nYeah, you're going to take and grab one of those.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:09.000\nShe just walked in and said,\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:10.000\nwhat should we talk about?\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:12.000\nThat's so interesting.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:14.000\nSo, what's your name, by the way?\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:15.000\nLisa.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:16.000\nHello, Lisa.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:18.000\nYou look very, very contentious right now.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:19.000\nShe's got arms of Kimbo,\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:22.000\nlike a fight's about to break out.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:24.000\nCan I just say something really quick?\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:25.000\nOkay, yes?\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:26.000\nHello, little cat.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:27.000\nOh, I know.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nLisa is responsible for getting season five.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nShe's a Twitter fan.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nCan you come up and explain that?\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:36.000\nGet up here.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:43.000\nWhat is going on?\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:44.000\nAnd, by the way,\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:45.000\ncan we start doing the show in the round,\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:46.000\nbecause it would be so much easier\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:48.000\njust to have to surround it by people.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:50.000\nThe access to the stage would be so much simpler,\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:52.000\nbecause now the whole show is people\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:56.000\njust storming the stage like the Bastille.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:58.000\nWell, I invited up.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:01.000\nHey, lady.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:02.000\nI did not create a show,\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:05.000\nand you do not get to tell me to stop talking.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:10.000\nWhat's your name, Robin, to her Batman?\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:11.000\nI'm Catherine.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:12.000\nCatherine, hello, Catherine.\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:14.000\nI'm Violin Catherine on Twitter.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:15.000\nI guess you can pronounce that.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:17.000\nI didn't ask, but thank you.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:19.000\nAnd you guys were principally,\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:22.000\nlike you coordinated Communicon, right?\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:24.000\nShe did.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:26.000\nRight.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:36.000\nAll right, so the concept,\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:41.000\nokay, why do I need to stop talking?\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:46.000\nIn three words or less.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:48.000\nI thought that you were hurting yourself\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:49.000\nand you were hurting the fans.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:51.000\nI didn't say you should stop talking,\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:55.000\nbecause I think, well, I did say you should stop.\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:56.000\nI really did.\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:59.000\nBut in the context,\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:00.000\nI'm sorry, I should I eat my mic.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:01.000\nEat your mic.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:03.000\nIn the context.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:04.000\nYeah, talk to the mic.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:06.000\nOkay, sorry.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nThere is a danger that when you say things into this,\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:13.000\nit will end up reflecting poorly on you.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:15.000\nThat's true, but I really didn't think\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nthat you would go so far as to have me up here,\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:18.000\nbut so I'm glad.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:19.000\nI'm glad to have the chance.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nIs this punishment to bring you up here?\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:22.000\nDo you not want to be up here?\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:25.000\nWell, you don't like feeling like you're under attack,\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:28.000\nso I don't particularly like it myself either.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:30.000\nOkay, so you don't want to be up here?\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:32.000\nOh, I see where you're going.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:34.000\nI see where you're going.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:38.000\nWhat kind of fucking jiu-jitsu is going on over there?\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\nDan, if she doesn't stay up here,\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:42.000\nI will stay up here and defend her.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:44.000\nWell, I don't doubt that.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:47.000\nThere's a lot of energy coming from this concept.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.000\nDo you understand why I would want you to come up here?\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:52.000\nSo that we can have it out so that we can be on honest ground,\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:54.000\nso that tonight everyone, whether they love community,\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:56.000\nhate community, don't give a shit about community,\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:58.000\nlove me, hate me, don't give a shit about me,\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:01.000\nwe can all go home tonight and go to fucking sleep\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:04.000\nand wake up in an honest world.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nWhy should I stop talking?\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:09.000\nOkay, yes, it is great that you cared,\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:11.000\nand I love that you care, and I think you're brilliant,\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:13.000\nand I think that the show is obviously wonderful,\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:16.000\nor I wouldn't be here if I spent all the money to get here.\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:19.000\nWhen I read the comments, and I'm not the only person\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:22.000\nwho said this, Dan, is that not that you should stop talking,\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:25.000\nbut you let them bait you to the point\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:28.000\nwhere it distracts people from wanting to enjoy the show.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:31.000\nNew fans, people who don't know you,\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:34.000\npeople who don't know that this is your persona,\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:36.000\nor who you are, and they say,\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:38.000\nwho the hell is Dan Harmon?\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:40.000\nI don't like to see that happen.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:42.000\nI'm so happy that you're back.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:44.000\nI am over the moon happy that you're back.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:47.000\nI'm all the time in passion into doing what I do online\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:50.000\nto get people to watch the show and to love the show\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:52.000\nif I didn't care.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:54.000\nSo when I hear you say those things,\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:56.000\nI don't think you shouldn't say them,\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:59.000\nand people said to me, you should come and see him at Communicon,\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:01.000\nyou should come see him at Harmontown\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:03.000\nand see what he's really like as a person.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\nHe's not done a shit quote that was in Vulture,\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nand I said, yeah, I'm gonna do that\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.000\nbecause I saw your response to me the other day,\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:12.000\nand it hurt, and I said, well, right, I see his point.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:17.000\nYou for me to be defensive and express my pain.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:19.000\nWhat was your response to?\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:21.000\nShe said that she was gonna come to the show,\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:23.000\nand I said, maybe the topic of the show\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nshould be how I should stop talking.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nThat hurt you?\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:28.000\nWell, no.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:29.000\nOkay.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:32.000\nIt didn't hurt me in the sense that my feelings were her.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:34.000\nI realized, like many people do,\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:36.000\nthat on Twitter, the things that you say\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:38.000\ncan come back and bite you,\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:40.000\njust like the things that you say on a subreddit\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:42.000\ncame back and bit you,\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:44.000\nand you felt like you needed to respond to it,\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nand that's why I didn't respond to that\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:47.000\nbecause you know what?\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:48.000\nThe dude is right.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:50.000\nIt's his show, and I am sitting here\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:52.000\nsaying that he should stop talking.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nI meant in terms of, and I'm sorry,\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:57.000\nI'm a little bit going to be around and going around\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nand sounding like I don't quite know what I mean\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:00.000\nbecause it's complicated.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:02.000\nYou're a complicated person.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:04.000\nI find the whole concept of trying to understand\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.000\nwhere you're coming from as a person\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:08.000\nto be something that I wrestle with,\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:10.000\nbut I also tell everyone that I think\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:12.000\nyou're a total genius\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:14.000\nand that the show wouldn't be the same without you.\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:16.000\nWe all know what season four was like,\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:18.000\nand that's also why it hurt me.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:20.000\nWhat do you mean?\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:21.000\nOkay.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.000\nWhat on earth do you mean?\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:24.000\nOkay.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:26.000\nGet those camera phones out, everybody.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:27.000\nPlease.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:28.000\nHit record right now.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:30.000\nPlease tell Vulture and DeFamer and TMZ\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:32.000\nwhat you mean by that.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:34.000\nPlease tell the AV Club what you mean.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:36.000\nSay anything after the word season four.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:38.000\nSay anything.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:41.000\nSay season four, I like Arby's.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:43.000\nAnd see how they twist it.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:46.000\nAnd you didn't even create the show.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:49.000\nI mean, there's a lot of energy on that topic,\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:52.000\nand it's tough sometimes.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:53.000\nLisa, can I?\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:56.000\nI mean, I'm coming at this from a very,\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nlike from the back row here,\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:01.000\nbut it sounds to me like you love the show, obviously.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:03.000\nYou really love community.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:05.000\nAnd there's two different things here.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nThere's Dan Harmon, the guy.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:09.000\nAnd then there's the show that Dan created.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:11.000\nAnd do you feel that you like Dan\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:13.000\na little bit less than you like the show?\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:15.000\nYou worry that Dan has the capacity\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\nto hurt the thing that you care about.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:18.000\nWhich is good.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:20.000\nNo, I'm not trying to be flippant.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:22.000\nYou feel like Dan has the capacity\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:24.000\nto actually be destructive to the thing\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:26.000\nthat you care about more, right?\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:28.000\nCommunity, am I getting that wrong?\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:29.000\nYes and no.\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nIt's possible if Paul Newman makes salad dressing\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nand then Paul Newman is in the paper\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:35.000\ngoing like, I hate women.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:38.000\nIt could hurt salad dressing sales.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:41.000\nIt could hurt his salad dressing sales.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:45.000\nIt could hurt, yes, not all salad dressing sales.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:49.000\nIt might actually cause a spike in Hidden Valley Ranch, yes.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:52.000\nI'm saying his salad dressing sales, yes,\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:55.000\nwould be harmed by him saying something like that.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:57.000\nSo you're looking at me as like a Colonel Sanders\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nor like a Ronald McDonald,\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:03.000\nwhich I am like in relation to community.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nWhen it says, cause those articles say\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:09.000\ncommunity creator lashes out at rape victims.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:12.000\nLoves what happens to them.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:14.000\nThinks it's hilarious.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:16.000\nCreated community.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:19.000\nDo you think you should watch it on Thursday?\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:22.000\nThat's what those headlines do.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:25.000\nAnd so as a fan you're like, oh god damn it.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\nI'm trying so hard just to get people to\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:29.000\nmobilize and watch the show\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\nand get that 1.2 up to a 1.3\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nand he's undermining me.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:37.000\nPaul Newman is undermining my pro salad dressing campaign.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:38.000\nWow.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:40.000\nYou're frowning like you disagree with anything I'm saying.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:43.000\nI'm saying, that's my best guess at what you're going through.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:45.000\nNo, I don't think you're undermining me.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:47.000\nI worry about people hearing that\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nand thinking that you're a dick\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.000\nand that they don't want to watch the show.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:53.000\nRight, that's what I just said.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:55.000\nI can't tell.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:57.000\nMe?\n\n17:57.000 --> 17:59.000\nIt seems like there's two people that hate each other on stage\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:01.000\nbut you don't.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:04.000\nHow do you feel about Dan Harmon, the individual?\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nI don't hate you.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:08.000\nWhy would I hate you?\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nWow.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:13.000\nI'm really confused.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:15.000\nThere's two people on stage.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nOne of them\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:20.000\ndoes not like being told\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:22.000\nnot to talk.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:25.000\nThat's me for sure.
