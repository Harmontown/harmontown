00:00.000 --> 00:19.200
Welcome all to Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics and the NerdMelt Theater.

00:19.200 --> 00:20.200
Thank you so much for coming.

00:20.200 --> 00:27.000
Give yourselves a warm, warm and grace.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
We've been off for a week and we have a very large crowd tonight.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
It's very exciting.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
Will you please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
Thank you.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
Thank you.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Thank you.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Probably a special night for some of you.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
Some people are probably here out of town for Communicon.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Oh, that's what this is all about.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
It makes you wonder, would there just be 12 people here if it weren't for that?

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
We usually have a healthy-sized crowd, but certainly a lot of people are here.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
Communicon was our second year of having a community convention over at the Embassy Suites in Glendale.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Not our second year there.

01:19.000 --> 01:30.000
Do you think that you guys are on pace for six seasons?

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
Well, as much as we were first season, everybody always asks that,

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
like, do you think you guys don't, you think this and don't you think that?

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
It's like, this show has been on the chopping block since its first episode.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
At what point do you just throw up your hands and go, obviously, it's going to be on the air for 20 years

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
or can die at any time.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
You just kind of embrace it.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
It's the show represents the human condition.

01:58.000 --> 02:05.000
It's kind of a weird mudskipper of a show because it's, you know, you wonder like,

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
just put yourself in the mind of Donald Glover, incredibly talented,

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
who rang his soul dry into that show.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
But I definitely know that he did not leave because he thought,

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
oh, I'm going to go make a bunch of money.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
But a kid like Donald, like as talented as Donald was,

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
and for the amount of work that he did on that show, 15 years earlier,

02:31.000 --> 02:40.000
like, can you imagine, like he would have left the set of community at the end of an episode taping in season two

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
and he would have gone out to the parking lot and a Sony exec would have been like,

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
Donald, hey, and there would have been a Porsche.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
Just want to let you know your contract's up for renewal.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Like, here you go.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Like, I mean, it's the shit changed, the climate changed.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
And what was my point?

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
I don't know.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
Well, I mean, community, like, to make it into your fifth season is fucking hard.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
And to make it into your fifth season, now you just do it crawling on your belly over glass.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
Now you just do it, like, you make it to the end of the fifth season and at the end of it,

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
people are just going like, yeah, you're welcome.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Like, no, nobody, there is no ticker tape.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
There's no, except for these kids, there's ticker tape from them.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
But like you say, like back in the old days, like, you know, like, and I don't mean to sound corny,

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
but really before 9-11, like, when your show made it.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
That's true.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
That's the first time, that's the first time.

03:37.000 --> 03:45.000
The use of 9-11 has been characterized as corny.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
I don't mean to sound old-fashioned.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Corny?

03:50.000 --> 03:56.000
Oh, that old, that old chestnut.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
There was a time when, like, there was a thing called holding deals.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
Like you say, like, actors got like a half a million dollars to not work.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Just so they were stuck to a network or a studio.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
And also, like, when, like, ER got picked up in the second season,

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
all the cast walked out and they all had brand new Porsches, like you say.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Do any shows get that? Does like Big Bang Theory get the cars?

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Well, I'm sure Big Bang Theory gets all, yeah.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
I mean, that's an actual profitable, like, actual thing.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Like, I don't know.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
You'd have to, I mean, you know, we should have Bill Pradeon.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.000
He's the showrunner for Big Bang Theory and ostensibly my nemesis,

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
but we like each other and I should have him come up here

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
and talk about what it's like to run Big Bang Theory,

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
because I'm constantly cursing it like the Red Baron.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
But it would be interesting to know what it's like to work over there.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
And I know, yeah, I have no idea.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I'd be speaking way outside my jurisdiction.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.000
I just know that in general, you know, God, there was, you know,

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
when I was a kid watching TV, there was three networks.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Just three.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
And then there was your local UHF station with some yahoo like Jim Henson

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
doing some weird shit on it,

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
because he hit the bricks with a suitcase full of tapes of Kermit the Frog

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
and said, can we do this syndicated?

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
But there was three networks.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
And those three networks basically cooperated.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
So it was like, battle of the network stars.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
It was Scott Mayo fighting the Hulk on a high wire.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Everything was just a big fuck you to the consumer.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
It was like, what are you going to take your business elsewhere? It's a talking car.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Plus the chick's hot. Fuck off.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Which also created the classic television.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I miss Sherwood Schwartz in Gilligan's Island,

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
because that motherfucker didn't care what he needed to do.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
He wanted you to watch that show.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
The Harlem Globetrotters are on the island tonight.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Well, that's the interesting thing.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
That's good.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
In the age of the three networks, you had Mary Tyler Moore,

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
who created this collective of creatives.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
That little kitty cat, meow.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
That's an MTM.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
That's Mary Tyler Moore, who, like Charlie Chaplin before her,

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
created a collective of artists.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
Her whole goal was to say, we're the creatives.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
We need to be able to swing a heavier dick than these rich people

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
who just pay to do nothing.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
And at the same time as her, Norman Lear,

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
the time of total monopolization,

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
there was more conscientiousness,

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
more creative passion on the part of some of these people.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
That's the odd thing.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
But the fragmentation of all this media,

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
you would not be able to have a Breaking Bad

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
on network TV in 1980, obviously,

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
for obvious reasons,

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
because there's 25 million people watching,

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
possibly if you're the lowest-rating show,

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
the rate-rated show.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
So there's no way anyone's going to green-light Breaking Bad

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
in 1980.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
So you get, who cares?

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Let's move on to something else.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
I took a poop the other day.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Go on.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
You want to know about TV? Google TV. Jesus Christ.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
I'm sure there's stuff on the internet about TV.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
What am I talking about?

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
This is a big jackass talking about TV.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
I took the biggest poop.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
You cannot find that on Google.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
I don't care. You can Google it all you want.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Big poop.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
I didn't really take a big poop.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
I was kidding.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Don't tease us like that, man.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
You know what I was kind of interested in doing,

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
because it was the first time that, you know,

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
the community fans are here.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
I don't doubt that a lot of Harmontown attendees

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
are probably, I don't kid myself.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
I'm sure the only reason they're here

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
is because they watch community.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
But at the same time, there is a division.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
There's like a, you know, there's Harmontown fans,

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
and there's community fans,

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
and there's a big old Venn diagram cleavage in the middle.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
But there's also separation,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
like a huge community fan.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Arguably, the biggest community fan in the world

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
would have a huge reason to be like,

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
fuck Dan Harmon.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Fuck that guy.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
And I would see, you know, every once in a while,

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I open my mouth, and I say something in a subcomment

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
of this comment section on Reddit.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Like, for instance, I care about my show,

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
and I think it's stupid when people tell me it sucks

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
and they can eat poop and fuck off and die.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Like, and here's how that makes me feel,

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
because I'm a human being that has a heartbeat

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
and is going to die one day

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
and doesn't want to go to my God liar.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
And then everything's fine in that subreddit,

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
and it seems perfectly fine,

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
and then someone goes like,

08:29.000 --> 08:36.000
if I reprinted this in my dumbass blog,

08:36.000 --> 08:43.000
I could get like a million pennies.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
And then it all gets out of control.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
The end result is always that

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
there's a lot of community fans, I think,

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
and I know, because I see on Twitter,

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
they literally will go,

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
he needs to stop talking.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
What percentage of the feedback is that?

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
I don't know.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
What does Twitter represent?

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
What do the community fans represent?

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
One million pennies.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Is our top community fan,

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
is the, like, that was a quote from,

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
I can't pronounce her Twitter name.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
Is she here?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Wait, the stop talking lady is here?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
The stop talking lady is here.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
He needs to stop talking.

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
Why would you come to this show?

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
That's all it is.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
That's what I wanted to do.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Would you be willing to come up

09:43.000 --> 09:49.000
and talk about how I shouldn't?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Well, if we're going to have this conversation,

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
you have to come up on stage.

09:52.000 --> 10:06.000
Stop talking, lady.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Yeah, you're going to take and grab one of those.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
She just walked in and said,

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
what should we talk about?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
That's so interesting.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
So, what's your name, by the way?

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Lisa.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Hello, Lisa.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
You look very, very contentious right now.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
She's got arms of Kimbo,

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
like a fight's about to break out.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Can I just say something really quick?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Okay, yes?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Hello, little cat.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Oh, I know.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Lisa is responsible for getting season five.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
She's a Twitter fan.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Can you come up and explain that?

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Get up here.

10:36.000 --> 10:43.000
What is going on?

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
And, by the way,

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
can we start doing the show in the round,

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
because it would be so much easier

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
just to have to surround it by people.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
The access to the stage would be so much simpler,

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
because now the whole show is people

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
just storming the stage like the Bastille.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Well, I invited up.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Hey, lady.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
I did not create a show,

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
and you do not get to tell me to stop talking.

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
What's your name, Robin, to her Batman?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
I'm Catherine.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Catherine, hello, Catherine.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
I'm Violin Catherine on Twitter.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
I guess you can pronounce that.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
I didn't ask, but thank you.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
And you guys were principally,

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
like you coordinated Communicon, right?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
She did.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Right.

11:26.000 --> 11:36.000
All right, so the concept,

11:36.000 --> 11:41.000
okay, why do I need to stop talking?

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
In three words or less.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I thought that you were hurting yourself

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
and you were hurting the fans.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
I didn't say you should stop talking,

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
because I think, well, I did say you should stop.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
I really did.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
But in the context,

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
I'm sorry, I should I eat my mic.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Eat your mic.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
In the context.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Yeah, talk to the mic.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Okay, sorry.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
There is a danger that when you say things into this,

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
it will end up reflecting poorly on you.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
That's true, but I really didn't think

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
that you would go so far as to have me up here,

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
but so I'm glad.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
I'm glad to have the chance.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Is this punishment to bring you up here?

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Do you not want to be up here?

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
Well, you don't like feeling like you're under attack,

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
so I don't particularly like it myself either.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Okay, so you don't want to be up here?

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Oh, I see where you're going.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
I see where you're going.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
What kind of fucking jiu-jitsu is going on over there?

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Dan, if she doesn't stay up here,

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
I will stay up here and defend her.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Well, I don't doubt that.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
There's a lot of energy coming from this concept.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Do you understand why I would want you to come up here?

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
So that we can have it out so that we can be on honest ground,

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
so that tonight everyone, whether they love community,

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
hate community, don't give a shit about community,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
love me, hate me, don't give a shit about me,

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
we can all go home tonight and go to fucking sleep

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
and wake up in an honest world.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Why should I stop talking?

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
Okay, yes, it is great that you cared,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
and I love that you care, and I think you're brilliant,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
and I think that the show is obviously wonderful,

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
or I wouldn't be here if I spent all the money to get here.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
When I read the comments, and I'm not the only person

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
who said this, Dan, is that not that you should stop talking,

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
but you let them bait you to the point

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
where it distracts people from wanting to enjoy the show.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
New fans, people who don't know you,

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
people who don't know that this is your persona,

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
or who you are, and they say,

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
who the hell is Dan Harmon?

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I don't like to see that happen.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
I'm so happy that you're back.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
I am over the moon happy that you're back.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
I'm all the time in passion into doing what I do online

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
to get people to watch the show and to love the show

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
if I didn't care.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
So when I hear you say those things,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
I don't think you shouldn't say them,

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
and people said to me, you should come and see him at Communicon,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
you should come see him at Harmontown

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
and see what he's really like as a person.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
He's not done a shit quote that was in Vulture,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
and I said, yeah, I'm gonna do that

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
because I saw your response to me the other day,

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
and it hurt, and I said, well, right, I see his point.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
You for me to be defensive and express my pain.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
What was your response to?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
She said that she was gonna come to the show,

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
and I said, maybe the topic of the show

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
should be how I should stop talking.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
That hurt you?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Well, no.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Okay.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
It didn't hurt me in the sense that my feelings were her.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
I realized, like many people do,

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
that on Twitter, the things that you say

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
can come back and bite you,

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
just like the things that you say on a subreddit

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
came back and bit you,

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
and you felt like you needed to respond to it,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
and that's why I didn't respond to that

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
because you know what?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
The dude is right.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
It's his show, and I am sitting here

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
saying that he should stop talking.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
I meant in terms of, and I'm sorry,

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
I'm a little bit going to be around and going around

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
and sounding like I don't quite know what I mean

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
because it's complicated.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
You're a complicated person.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I find the whole concept of trying to understand

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
where you're coming from as a person

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
to be something that I wrestle with,

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
but I also tell everyone that I think

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
you're a total genius

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
and that the show wouldn't be the same without you.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
We all know what season four was like,

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
and that's also why it hurt me.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
What do you mean?

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Okay.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
What on earth do you mean?

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Okay.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Get those camera phones out, everybody.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Please.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Hit record right now.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Please tell Vulture and DeFamer and TMZ

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
what you mean by that.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Please tell the AV Club what you mean.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Say anything after the word season four.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Say anything.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
Say season four, I like Arby's.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
And see how they twist it.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
And you didn't even create the show.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
I mean, there's a lot of energy on that topic,

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
and it's tough sometimes.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Lisa, can I?

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
I mean, I'm coming at this from a very,

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
like from the back row here,

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
but it sounds to me like you love the show, obviously.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
You really love community.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
And there's two different things here.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
There's Dan Harmon, the guy.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
And then there's the show that Dan created.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
And do you feel that you like Dan

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
a little bit less than you like the show?

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
You worry that Dan has the capacity

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
to hurt the thing that you care about.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Which is good.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
No, I'm not trying to be flippant.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
You feel like Dan has the capacity

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
to actually be destructive to the thing

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
that you care about more, right?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Community, am I getting that wrong?

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Yes and no.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
It's possible if Paul Newman makes salad dressing

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
and then Paul Newman is in the paper

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
going like, I hate women.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
It could hurt salad dressing sales.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
It could hurt his salad dressing sales.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
It could hurt, yes, not all salad dressing sales.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
It might actually cause a spike in Hidden Valley Ranch, yes.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
I'm saying his salad dressing sales, yes,

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
would be harmed by him saying something like that.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
So you're looking at me as like a Colonel Sanders

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
or like a Ronald McDonald,

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
which I am like in relation to community.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
When it says, cause those articles say

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
community creator lashes out at rape victims.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
Loves what happens to them.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Thinks it's hilarious.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Created community.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
Do you think you should watch it on Thursday?

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
That's what those headlines do.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
And so as a fan you're like, oh god damn it.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I'm trying so hard just to get people to

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
mobilize and watch the show

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
and get that 1.2 up to a 1.3

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
and he's undermining me.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
Paul Newman is undermining my pro salad dressing campaign.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Wow.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
You're frowning like you disagree with anything I'm saying.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
I'm saying, that's my best guess at what you're going through.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
No, I don't think you're undermining me.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
I worry about people hearing that

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
and thinking that you're a dick

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
and that they don't want to watch the show.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Right, that's what I just said.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
I can't tell.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Me?

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
It seems like there's two people that hate each other on stage

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
but you don't.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
How do you feel about Dan Harmon, the individual?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
I don't hate you.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Why would I hate you?

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Wow.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
I'm really confused.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
There's two people on stage.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
One of them

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
does not like being told

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
not to talk.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
That's me for sure. I'll own up to that.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Sounds like that's also how you feel

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
because a mere reply to your tweet hurt your feelings.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
You said something and I responded to it

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
and it hurt your feelings.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
I won't, let me rephrase.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Being brought up here feels like an attack.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Oh, sorry, you're making me say it a lot of ways.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Responses to the things that you say

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
make you feel like a bad person.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
You feel under scrutiny.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
You feel like you're under a microscope.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
I want you to be different.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Catherine, you have a microphone in your hand.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Just start tossing into the mic.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Lisa, can I just...

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
No, no, no.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
I really don't want you to...

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Let her talk.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
No.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
This is the last thing I want.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Catherine, what I'm assuming is a friend of yours

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
is on stage and she's champion.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I want you to...

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
No, I won't.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
In 60 seconds we won't come out.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Hey, hey, hey, Lisa.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
I'm Comptroller, shut up.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Catherine, go ahead.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
You have to conch.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
All right, Dan.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Let me...

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
60 seconds, let me talk and you take the mic back.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Let me talk.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
She really doesn't like people to talk.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Okay.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I mean, two dots draws a segment

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
and it's almost a line, man.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
She tried to get me.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
All right, Dan, we've worked our butts off

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
for season four, which, okay,

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
whatever, season five,

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
looking at season six.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
This girl

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
spent day and night

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
with Mike in Canada to get season five.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I don't want her to get pissed off

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
and quit

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
right now. There's a reality.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Okay, I love you. I'm just saying it.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
I need to stand up for you right now.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
The other thing is, okay,

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
as an AV club member

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
on that 160,000 comment board,

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
we love you and we want you

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
to come hang out with us and it's sad.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Okay, you can go to Reddit

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
and be nice to them, but you're going to attack

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
a community fan leader

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
and then you're going to go and like

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
shun the AV club. I'm just personally like

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
go to the people who love you

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
and come back and be like, okay, what on earth

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
instead of just coming back hard, because we do love you.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
There's so much

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
backstory and underlying stuff to this

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
that's so confusing to people, though.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
That's what I'm saying. When I wake up in the morning,

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
here's what I do. I wake up

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
and I go, my name is Dan Harmon.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
I am going to think things. They're going to

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
drop down out of my brain by gravity

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
and come out of my mouth. Some of this stuff

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
is going to go through my fingers because I won't have time

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
to say everything and end up being a TV show

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
if I'm lucky. I've been doing that

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
for 40 years and counting. So that's how

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
I operate every given day.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
And then this wonderful thing called the Internet

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
which doesn't demand eye contact from me

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
like I get to go in and I love

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
going in. I was born on the Internet.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
I go in and somebody says to me,

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
hey Dan, what does it feel like to write that

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
show? And I go, you know what,

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
sometimes it feels like a penguin fucking a moose.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
And only recently

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
the weird flash in the pan

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
like it's worth money

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
to print

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
a headline that says like

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
community creator says penguins

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
fucking mooses.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
And that has something to do with the thing.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
So that's an issue that we all are experiencing,

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
all of us. And when we experience

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
it, like we all have

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
it's a bummer for me

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
but here's how I handle it. I go

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
oh fuck, that sucks.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
And you go, oh fuck, that sucks.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
And you go, that sucks.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
We all go to bed but

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
I don't say to anybody

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
even to famer, vulture,

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
anybody. I never say

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
someone's got to stop doing

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
something that they've been doing.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
I go to bed, I wake up and I keep doing it.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
And I experience pain because

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
of it. Just like I did on the playground.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Just like all the characters in community

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
are constantly being punished

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
for who they are. The outside world

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
closes in on you as you

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
express your humanity.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
It's an important theme of the show.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
And it's run by a psychopath.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
It's run by somebody who just goes

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
baaah, baaah,

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
baaah. And I'm

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
bummed out. I'm a little baby

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
a little poopy pants baby

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
about the idea of

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
being told to shut up and what

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
I shouldn't shouldn't do. It's like a big

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
issue with me. And

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
I didn't like go off on you

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
or anything. I tweeted back

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
at you like a defensive

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
like low, like I rolled over

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
exposed my belly to you. Do I get to jump in now?

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Yeah, sorry, I didn't mean

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
to cut you off.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Look, you tweeted back

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
at me and it gave me pause

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
and I talked to my friends, most

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
of whom are here tonight, who all said

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
you know what? Dan

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
does run off at the mouth. He doesn't

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
mean anything bad to people about

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
he's not trying to hurt anyone. Maybe

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
he's hurting himself. Maybe you should

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
think twice about what you said. Maybe you

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
should go to Harmontown, see what he's really like

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
came to see you at Communicon

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
came away from that thinking

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I can see why he's such a powerful

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
figure and why people like him so much.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
It's interesting to hear you talk.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
I was hearing those sound

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
bites out of vulture like that you're

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
complaining about and I responded

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
thinking here's a man who makes

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
a show I admire. Here's a show

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
I really want to see

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
succeed in season five. I'd like to see more.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
I wish he would stop talking

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
because it just makes him look

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
bad and I don't want you to

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
look bad. So if that's bad

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
and if that puts me stupid or I'm

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
attacking you or I don't even know

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
exactly what we're getting at right now

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
because I would never ever ever

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
call you stupid. My head is

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
crawling a little bit because I'm being

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
No, it's tough up here, yes. I choose

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
to be up here because it's self-destructive.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Just

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
to respond to that.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
I mean, did you

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
watch the Sarah Silverman program? I got fired

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
from that. I got fired from

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
every job I had in Milwaukee. I always thought

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
you caught me at a normal

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
time in my life.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
I have been getting

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
fired my entire life.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Everybody that I work for

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
eventually goes, did I like

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
the Sarah Silverman program?

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Did I like?

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
It's a bummer

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
to me. I wish that I could be who I

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
was and constantly get promoted.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
That would be great if people

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
gave me cakes all the time

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
instead of firing me, I guess.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
But the truth is the way

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
that they respond to who I am is they fire

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
me.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
But at the same time,

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
I like my life.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
I like the way things are going.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
I got a hybrid.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
I got

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
a golden doodle. I got a red-head

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
girlfriend.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
In that order.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
But the thing that we're

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
talking about, this is why I wanted to bring

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
you up, and you're like me

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
as soon as somebody is talking

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
about what you're saying,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
you know,

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
I'm feeling what you're feeling

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
when we come up here and talk about this.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
That's

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
why...

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Here's the thing that I have found.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
But here's the thing that I have found.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
When the autonomic response

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
slowly fades down,

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
when we talk about it for

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
10 minutes longer than people usually talk about it,

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
and this show does everything 10 minutes

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
longer than anything,

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
this miracle

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
starts to happen.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
I'll tell you why this show exists,

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
and why my

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
space blog exists, and why everything that I've

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
ever done that has gotten me in trouble exists.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Why there's a letter

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
online that I wrote to an 8-year-old kid

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
about Steven Spielberg being a hack, because I didn't

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
like Monster House enough.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Why I'm famous

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
before that for saying that my

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Kung Fu Panda sucked.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Every fucking job I've ever worked at

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
there's always this thing

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
that comes up that I go like,

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
I'm an asshole.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
I say this shit that gets me in trouble.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
But

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
here's another thing that has always happened.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
When I first came out

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
to LA,

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
I once...

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
I was working for Ben Stiller,

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
and it just

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
happened, Stan. All of a sudden I'm working for this famous guy, Ben Stiller.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
And

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
we were going to have a party in our place in Koreatown,

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
and

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
I was going to

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
invite him over, and Rob Schrab said,

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
you know, you should probably leave a funny message

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
on his

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
message machine. We had machines

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
back then. And so

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
I practiced

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
a funny message.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
And I kind of

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
I ran it through

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
my head a couple times, and I dialed his number, and I

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
left... I tried to leave a funny

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
message on his machine. I kind of fucked it up, and

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
I had to call back, because I forgot to leave

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
my contact info.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
It was

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
a horrible experience that I walked away from, because

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
of course he never showed up for the party.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
I

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
had so much shame about it, locked down

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
in my body, that

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
three years later, I would open my refrigerator

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
to make a sandwich in the privacy

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
of my own home, and the color of the mustard

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
bottle would somehow remind

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
me of the time I left

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
a fucking shitty funny message on

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Ben Stiller's voice mail.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
And

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
there was this tipping point where I said,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
I got to stop making this

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
my problem. And I went over

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
to my computer, and I typed up the

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
story of how I left a funny message on

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Ben Stiller's answering machine,

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
and I clicked submit on it, and it was

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
a blog entry, and there was no guarantee

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
that anyone was going to read it. It was just a

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
message in a bottle that I whipped out into the ocean,

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
and it was gone. It was out of my heart,

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
and everybody in this room, everybody

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
on this planet is walking around with all this

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
shit that we do, that is shameful,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
and all this rage

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
that we have, and all these sexual perversions,

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
and we collect

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
them, and we bottle them up.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
And I don't think it's a good idea for everybody

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
to barf them onto each other,

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
but I know that I would go insane,

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
that I would be a toxic, horrible

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Portuguese

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
man-of-war, half-dead

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
on the beach. TMZ

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
had like, Dan Harmon lashes out at the Portuguese.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
And jellyfish.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
I would be filled with toxicity

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
if I didn't, like,

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
put it out, and the weird thing about putting it out

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
is it doesn't poison other people. It turns

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
into comedy. It turns into

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
things that they can, it feels cathartic

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
to them. A lot of people basically

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
just say, oh, if that dumb fat

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
piece of shit, petty asshole

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
can get up there and be honest about being

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
a big fucking dumb shithead,

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
maybe I wasn't doing something

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
so wrong my whole life.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
And so I do

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
that stuff, and I'm going to keep doing

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
it, and the whole

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
time I'm very defensive

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
about the idea of being, like,

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
I feel that pressure. Community was

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
a new chapter in my life. It was this

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
plot point that happened to me. I

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
stumbled into this job

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
of being able to actually affect people

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
and being the Colonel Sanders

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
of this thing, and it was

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
like 15-year-old girls following

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
me on Twitter and me having to go, I can't

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
tweet about jerking off anymore.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
I could, but

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
it doesn't feel right.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
They're only following me because

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Joel McHale follows me.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
It's a 15-year-old girl.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
You start to

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
ask yourself who you are,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
what you have a right to say, and it

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
only constricts in from there.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
I

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
forgot my point a long time ago,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
but that's where I come

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
from, and

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
my point of bringing you up

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
here was absolutely not.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
I knew that if I did, I knew

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
that there would be, and

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
both of our parts, my cheeks got hot,

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
my ears got hot. I knew

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
that that would happen, but

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
I didn't want it to happen. I knew it

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
would have disastrous results. Probably tomorrow, it's

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
probably too late to prevent that

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
because it's a juicier story

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
and whatever happened right away.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
But I also knew

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
that something would be resolved, that

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
something would go just

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
finish it, just be done with it.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Some of you guys love

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
a television show so much

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
that the guy that created it

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
is an obstacle in its

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
path, and I think that's a beautiful

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
thing, but it's an obstacle that's not going to go

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
away.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
I'm not queuing that applause.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
It's going to sound like Dan Harmon brings up

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
a community fan in a

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
fucking dogfight pit

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
and makes them applaud him saying

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
he's a hero.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
I anticipated everybody

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
in the audience being a communicon

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
attendee. That's why I wanted to talk

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
about this. I wanted this to be more

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
apology and atonement than anything.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
I wanted to explain to you guys without

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
promising that I'm going to change because I'm not going

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
to. I wanted to somehow explain to you guys

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
that this is

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
who I am.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
So he doesn't need to stop talking.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Lisa, use your mic.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Oh, sorry.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Eat the mic. There's no way for me out of this

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
conversation.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
You could be human.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Do you want me to apologize?

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Tell me your feelings.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Feelings. Your feelings.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Don't talk about me.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Lisa, I'm not

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
trying to poke or prod here. What's

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
unresolved for you in this? You still seem pretty wound up

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
about it. What's the unresolved

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
issue for you?

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Why?

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Use your microphone.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
I'm not sure what you want from me.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Yes, I'm sorry. I just had a throwaway

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
comment to you that made you upset

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
and made you feel like you had to go through all this.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
But it's symbolic of a larger thing.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
There's a big sea of magma under there.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
The fandom.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
So am I here as an example for all the fandom

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
who goes in? Probably, right?

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
No? Do you not want to speak

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
for fandoms, like frustration

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
with my PR?

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
I can't speak for anyone but myself.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Well, okay. Then talk about

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
like, have you

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
said that? Then like, how do you feel?

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
I think I've already explained twice now that

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
I said that and I've talked to people

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
about it and they said, find out who he

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
really is. And now I feel like

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
I really have found out who you are and I'm not

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
going to worry about it anymore. You can say

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
whatever you want. I'm not the boss of you.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
We did it. Lisa

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
and Katherine, everybody. Thank you so much.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Fantastic.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Wow.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Good job.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
There was a thing about season 5

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
too. Thank you for season 5.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
I felt that was healthy.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
I felt like it for a little bit.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
All right.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Let's bring Spencer Crittenden up.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Hey, hey.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
What's up, everybody?

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
You got any

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
opinions about how that shook down?

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
I almost passed out.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
From boredom? Because all the

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
blood was in my penis.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Do you get turned on

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
by fandom issues?

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
I said the passed out thing

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
and then I thought that would be a natural

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
link. It just came out of me.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Like all the semen during that conversation.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Spencer, when's your HBO

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
special coming up?

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Yeah.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
We learn more about you

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
every week.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
That was fascinating

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
as a bystander to watch that

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
because it was like, clearly

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
there's emotions that people have about

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
the show and it's very interesting.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
I think it's like being in a hall

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
of mirrors for me.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
I think there's projection upon

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
projection upon projection upon projection.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
There's

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
I feel so fucking

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
much when I go

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
into any

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
comment section or article

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
about the things that I do.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
And it's the only right way

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
to do it would be to be so

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
detached that I

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
can't see myself being that kind of person

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
and yet at the same time, everybody

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
who says the same thing they've been saying

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
over and over and over again, which is like

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
stop it. Stop

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
responding. Stop getting

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
warmed up by it. Stop being a petty person.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
They're all right. They're all

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
absolutely correct. That is not

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
how Vince Gilligan goes about his business.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
That is not how good people

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
make a good show.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
But it's like, I don't know when

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
to, when do you die

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
your beard?

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
It's 40% gray.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
It's 60% gray.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
My temples are gray.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
I got a little thinning on top.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
When do you

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
start manipulating

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
who you are and how

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
people perceive you?

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
When is that dishonesty

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
and when is that maintenance?

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Do you think there will ever come a point for you?

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Do you aspire

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
to a healthier place when things don't

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
bother you like that? Do you foresee that even being

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
possible?

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Here's what a healthy guy looks

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
like on the internet.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
He's not there.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
He's healthy. Why would he be

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
on the internet?

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
If he is on the internet,

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
he usually looks like he has a little

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
eyes wide shut mask on his face

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
because he's not calling himself

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
the guy that his boss can fire.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
He's calling himself

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
a scuba tube 69.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
And he's just yelling

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
at people about

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
jet propulsion or racism.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
And the internet

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
is like the sewer slash glory hole

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
that people use.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
I'm 40 years old.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
I've really never

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
rarely,

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
rarely done

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
the anonymous thing. I've always been

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
myself,

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
on the internet. Maybe that's a weird

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
self-destructive thing that I've always done.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
I should have a long time ago just

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
burst into a weird aerosol

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
of weird characters

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
that can just blog their hearts out about

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
how much everyone's a piece of shit.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Do you think there will be some sort of crossover

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
where you become Buddha

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
and you just let things wash over you

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
and you don't care? Is that part of what drives you?

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
On the internet? No.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
In general, you don't like being told

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
what to do. You don't like people saying

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Tyree Shoe Bro.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
You have a very strong reaction to

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
anybody telling you to stop being

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
you, to alter you.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
That's a good thing

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
but do you ever see yourself

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
becoming

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
the dude about it

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
letting it all happen?

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
I'm not looking forward to it.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
I get a lot of

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
most of the good things that I do

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
I do out of a nervousness that

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
people aren't going to like me if I do something else.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
I'm not looking forward to the guy I

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
become when I am forced to disconnect.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
You probably stop writing.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
I might start writing really nasty shit.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
I don't know.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
I have no idea what I do.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
I don't know if it would be more or less marketable

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
what I wrote.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
I've

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
definitely reached a tipping point.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
I've definitely reached a point of

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
clearly

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
if I was in therapy right now

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
I know that the therapist a long time ago

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
listening to my description of what I've been going through

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
he would have said

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
you have to figure out who the fuck you are

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
because what's happening to you

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
is you are

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
going to strangers

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
to figure out who you are

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
and when you do that you get what you deserve

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
you are going to get static

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
as a result

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
and you're going to take that in

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
as a personality

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
that is what a crazy person does

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
a sociopath but in reverse

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
a sociopath

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
has efficacy

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
a sociopath can like taxi a plane down a runway

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
because he doesn't care what other people think

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
it's like so weird what am I

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
I don't know who I am

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
unless people are reacting to me

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
I now know I'm a bad person

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
because Lisa was like

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
bummed out up here

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
if your identity is defined by

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
not a lot of who you are

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
because you're a very singular person

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
but a lot of your identity

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
when you're working on community

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
that's who you are

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
it's a relationship that you have

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
the characters are kind of you

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
the show is you

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
that's thin ice

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
psychologically

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
you don't go into a job like

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
writing TV

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
with unresolved psychological issues

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
that's a bad gymnasium

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
to work out

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
you're not going to tone your muscles there

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
you're going to exacerbate

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
and Charlie Horst's

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
pre-existing conditions

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
let's say you wrote a show that was a giant

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
huge popular success

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
you have the Big Bang Theory

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
breaking bad

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
universe loves, you're on all the talk shows

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
and everybody is adoring you

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
do you think that would be more comfortable

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
I think I would figure out a way to self-destruct

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
I do

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
because I would feel like a fraud

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
I think that's oppositional defiant disorder

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
I would go like

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
I must be doing something wrong

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
nobody's pissed off

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
this is not working

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
I would figure out a way to fuck it up

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
is it you not liking being told what to do

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
you want to get punched at the bar

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
you're going to keep grabbing ass until somebody throws a punch at you

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
I don't know

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
I'd love you Andy if you're listening

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
although you stole my fucking beer yesterday

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
I feel like animals

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
you put them in a big pen

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
maybe there's one of the animals

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
that has some kind of

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
because it was a puppy mill puppy

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
I got to keep digging

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
in some dark corner

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
I would imagine you're never going to really change that

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
I think it's always going to be a thing

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
I have like

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
it's a tick

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
I look at my brother

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
it's frustratingly the same way

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
there's a thing about you

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
you can be

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
part of what drives you

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
clearly when you write anything

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Dan and I took an acting class years ago

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
and it was monologues

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
we would be at a bar an hour before the class

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
with no monologues

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
I'm going to go home, I'm going to write you a monologue about you being in the CIA

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
I'm going to write me a monologue about being king minus

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
we had a class

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
we had five minutes to look it over and kind of memorize it

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
and do it and they were great

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
really really good

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
there's something going on in your brain

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
that makes you very very good at typing thoughts down

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
and making good writing out of ideas

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
that you have

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
there has to be a deficit

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
there has to be something on the other side of that scale

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
that makes you a crazy person in certain ways

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
you can't be good at that

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
and good at everything else

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
and the same way like being a friend with you

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
with so much wisdom

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
you can come to you with a problem

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
I can just tell you a dream ahead

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
and you go, look this is what you're going through

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
in your Yoda, you live in goop

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
and you dispense Yoda wisdom

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
and there's other times when you're just not there

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
it's not like

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
a faucet that's always on

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
you can be completely

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
distant and unapproachable

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
as a friend but you get both of those things

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
you get incredible

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
outpouring of attention

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
and then you get zero

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
that's part of

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
he's looking at his phone

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
you see what it's like?

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Mitch Hurwitz is texting me

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
sure he is

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
I'll get back to you later

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
did you hear what I was saying?

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
something about a bad person

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
I don't know

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
perfect

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
our next guest

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
I do feel like what we should do

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
is there a couple rounds

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
there was an intensity to that exchange

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
and those ladies

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
they represent

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
say they represent the fandom

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
and then they don't want to be accused of that

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
or whatever

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
I feel like she represented herself

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
I think she's in a weird position

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
I don't think she wants to represent everybody

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
I think in some weird way

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
she kind of now has to

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
because you came up as the voice of a certain thought

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
but really she's just being Lisa

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
having her own visible reactions

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
yeah absolutely

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
I got punished for it for sure

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
and I will always do that

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
I will always punish people for telling me not to talk

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
but speaking of which

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
who wants to tell me not to talk

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
we don't do this a lot

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
do like a little Q&A

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
let's grab a couple

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
because there's a lot of communicon people here

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
are there any questions

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
of communicon that didn't get fielded

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
yes

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
in the back of the room

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
yeah

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
this is what I really should have asked

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
is there going to be more inspector space time?

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
is there going to be more inspector space time?

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
please can we beg you for more inspector space time

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
well no I'm sorry

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
there's no inspector space time in season 5

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
as of right now

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
there's not enough space or time

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
that's true there's not enough space or time

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
yeah

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
I've talked about this before

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
like inspector space time was like

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
it had this like really lofty goal

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
I wanted it to actually be

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
what it did start to become

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
which is like a

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
the show dialoguing with the fans

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
but what happened was

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
like it was so successful at doing that

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
that Sony Legal kind of panicked

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
not to vilify them

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
like they didn't really realize what they were getting into

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
and there was some poor guy whose job it was

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
at Sony Legal that had to watch all the Dr. Hoos

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
and started to

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
he had

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
a guy whose job it is to

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
there's somebody in this audience that goes

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
I'll take that job

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
I know and there's some poor guy at Sony

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
who didn't want that job

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
I could paint to watch all the Dr. Hoos again

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
that's just so funny about it to me

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
is that this poor guy in a tie

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
I picture him in a tie with a

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
like a little adding machine in his desk

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
he's like writing these emails going like

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
well this is obviously a reference to K9

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
you can't kid a kidder

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
it's a robot cat

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
it's a robot dog we get it

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
he had to take in all of the

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
minutia

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
anyways another question

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
let's go with that hand there

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
I don't know if it's a question or not

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
who the fuck do you think you are

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
okay that's good

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
I'm glad you asked

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
dad

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
I just think that

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
talking about how fans feel

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
about the whole thing

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
I just think that most of us

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
the show wouldn't be what it is

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
if you don't do what you do

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
all the time

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
you put yourself into that show

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
and that's why it's so great

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
is there a question in there?

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
don't bully him he's praising me

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
I just hate when people

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
don't give questions

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
is there a question in there?

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
the reason

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
is the reason that you are now

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
doing it again

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
is there a reason why Dan's

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
gone back

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
do you feel any sort of gratitude

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
for what they did

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
in keeping it on the air?

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
nice

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
and in case

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
I didn't get picked up over the microphone

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
do I feel any

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
gratitude to the people that worked

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
on season 4?

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
the answer to that is no

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
I might as well just

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
walk into a barrel of tar

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
of course

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
anybody that worked on a show

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
that had that title

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
especially like I did say

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
the guys that

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
did take over running it

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
looked at what they were up against

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
and actually made the weirder decision

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
which was to try to

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
do the weirder show

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
which they did not have to do

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
and may have been

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
so I have

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
I did looking at that

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
I was like wow they didn't have to do that

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
and of course anybody that was working

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
on that show was not doing it to say

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
fuck you to me

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
it's hard to separate that from

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
the kind of brain that just gets up here

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
and says well my garage needs to be cleaned

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
out so everyone can go fuck themself and die

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
you know it's like

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
I'm not a diplomat and a politician

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
and I am so sorry

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
like well I watched season 4

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
well what was that like

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
well it was like this for me

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
boom boom

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
that's what it was like for me

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
and I was talking

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
about myself and talking about this stuff

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
and then the next day it's like oh shit

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
I forgot to add

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
or it wasn't as delightful

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
for me to add

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
of course hats off to anybody

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
and then you think about the fact that I watched season 4

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
once and probably

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
here's the other thing

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
if I watched season 2

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
it would be like boom boom

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
you probably

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
heard my commentary on the DVDs

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
I'm not a big

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
fan of my own work

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
when I watch it again

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
so I was definitely not going to be a big fan

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
I think the most noble thing I did was not

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
not watch

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
that season until I had to

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
because I had to go back

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
because I knew I think that was probably

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
the only healthy part of my brain was like

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
you're going to fuck it up for everybody

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
if you watch that thing

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
and I watched it and then I came up here

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
whatever

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
I said how I feel

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
and it's

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
it's

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
it sucks when I say how I feel

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
and it hurts other people

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
it sucks

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
yes everyone that worked on that

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
season is a hero

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
everyone that works on any half hour of television

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
I don't even care if it's like

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Tim Allen go ask grandpa

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
or

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
or like

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
is he grandpa or is he play

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
she's not how dare you

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
it's a show about a young

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
vivacious hipster Tim Allen

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
whose grandpa moves in with him

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
after years of

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
being a part and he goes

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
and asks him for advice because he knows it'll make him feel better

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
have you seen it

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
no I haven't

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
it's wonderful it's got a lot of stop motion in it

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
it's crazy

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
all the sequences in the grandfather's dinner

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
done in stop motion

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
his father is like this Cthulhu like creature

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
who sits in the window and says

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
go ask grandpa

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
and Tim Allen goes in

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
grandpa always

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
sure enough his advice always works out

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
like half right half wrong

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
is the A story always something that Tim Allen

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
has to like you know like he's on a date or something

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
yeah he's like oh my wallet chain got caught on the door

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
no

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
but then there's the other story

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
is like well grandpa said I need to get

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
into the restaurant now my wallet chain is caught

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
and that's the end of the second act is like oh shit

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
third act

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
took off his pants it's really fine

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
forgot what I was talking about

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
people that work on network television shows

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
or anybody that would

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
ever imply that their time was

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
less valuable to them would be a villain

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
it's hard work

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
they go home very tired

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
a lot of times they don't make it all the way

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
home they pull over to the side of the road

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
and go to sleep sometimes they

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
I was one of these people pull into their garage

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
and could only make it that far and then fall asleep

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
in their garage with their cars running

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
and every once in a while statistically

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
you know something happens because we push

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
the limits of human labor on those

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
television is that why you got a hybrid

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
so I could sleep twice as long

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
it's true I probably be dead right now if I didn't

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
have a hybrid like I remember one night

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
waking up in my garage with the car running

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
I was like oh shit it's a hybrid you should have just

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
install some ventilation in there

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
the crazy thing would be

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
people they would have to figure out wasn't a

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
suicide

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
well did he have any

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
they would just like toy car

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
they would

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
trying to figure that out

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
if you want to murder me like do that

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
like there's a combo

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
episode going on right

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
yes of course

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
god damn it and also in a larger sense

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
I can't apologize enough for anything I said

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
that hurt the people that worked on that shit

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
I'm sorry I'm sorry I

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
crapped off at Megan Gans on Twitter

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
I'm sorry I

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
I'm sorry I

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
sorry I feel like it's some kind of personal

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
issue for me that they made a season of my TV

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
show without me I'm sorry I think it's my TV

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
show that's already a petty perspective

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
you know it's a

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
I'm not

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
that's how that's how the fans feel

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
it's how I feel it's a fans

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
perspective a larger person

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
like a Paul Newman would be like

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
it's not my

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
salad dressing I don't care if you found

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
a rat tail in it I

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
I was in

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
which is Sundance I don't give a fuck really

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
he's too busy he's too busy hating on

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
women

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
and let's do one more and then let's

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
move on let's go up in front here

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
oh it's Julieta super fan Julieta

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
I have a question

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
alright you're having an animated episode

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
you're having an animated episode

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
do you mean psychologically

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
that too I mean for season 5

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
in community and I'm an animator

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
and

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
here we go

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
why would you not

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
help me out man

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
yeah Dan stop being a dick

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
this is a whole other episode where you

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
come up here and we talk about this James

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
at Starburn's got you a work visa

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
right

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
way too late so they had to get

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
well boo-hoo

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
wait so he did try to

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
help you out

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
James from

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
under orders from

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Colonel Sanders

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
you think he would just come up with

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
that idea on his own he's a great guy

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
but my god

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
so where is it

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
standing right now you didn't get a visa so you can't work on a

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
show I got it but it took too long

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
to arrive so they had to give my job to someone else

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
because you know I understand that TV show

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
has to get named without me

53:34.000 --> 53:38.000
it seems like you're dealing with it pretty well

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
I skipped work to come here

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
because I don't like my job

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
where do you work?

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
give her a mic if she didn't keep talking this mic

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
alright come up Julieta

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
yeah I'm an animation teacher

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
at a university

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
which reminds me of Greendale

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
yeah

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
you hate teaching these people

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
I don't

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
keep teaching them

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
enjoy this time in your career when you can say this and there's no repercussions

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
exactly

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
yeah I mean no one's gonna listen to this

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
I mean

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
from my hometown

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
my students are not gonna listen to this

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
well I can make sure they do

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
watch this season 4 of community was like

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Monterey, Mexico

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
population

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
16,000

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
4 million

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
4 million

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Jesus

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
but I am actually really grateful that you remember

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
my little rant

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
you know the real reason I do is because I play this game

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
pocket planes on my iPhone

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
and Monterey is like my big strategic

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
layover city

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
oh I'm so glad that we are useful for something

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
other than drug dealing

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna sing karaoke

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
after this and I'm gonna sing it happen in Monterey

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
in your honor tonight

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
I am really flattered about that

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
and you think we don't do shit for you

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
look what we do for you

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
all we do is think about you Julieta

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
awww

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
well it's likewise

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
you know I honestly

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
and this is serious

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
I cannot listen to Harmontown

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
because I get depressed because I'm not here

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
I cannot it's

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
but you'll always be here in the form of these keychains

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
awwww

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
that's me hanging from my

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
hands

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
alright

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
well um yeah

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
I love you Dan and I respect you

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
thank you Julieta

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
see thank you for that

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
wow

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Dan

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
you finally get what you want

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
someone to come up here and praise you

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
I did it as a joke

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
I don't think you did

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
news flash

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
I'm not likeable

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
that's why I write

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
uh

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
if you were likeable

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
what would you do

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
dude I would just

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
you know what I would be a major at

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
I would

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
I would lead parades

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
you have a little baton

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
yeah yeah I would twirl

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
I swear to god I would just be out in front of every parade

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
no matter what it was

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Thanksgiving

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Thanksgiving look at me

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
time for Thanksgiving

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
the reason I do what I do

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
is because if I did that

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
everyone would go what's to be thankful for

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
really

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
maybe we should just watch Wizard of Oz

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
and the you know Macy's Day

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
parade would shut down

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
uh but if I

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
if I could just be popular I would just

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
I would teach girls how to play billiards

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
by wrapping my arms around them

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
no you're doing it wrong

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
in a likeable way

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
I would manage a bank for six months

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
and just be like who needs some money

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
you can't have any

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
I'm sorry

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
I feel like people like if I said you can't have a loan

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
people would be like you fucking gross fat turd

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
and I'd go like

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
shit she's right

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
and kill myself so I stay away from that

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
I just

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
there's so much you can do if you're popular

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
if you can walk away from anything going like

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
ah she's wrong I'm an unconditionally lovable

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
I would do anything

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
I would probably be a serial killer

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
because that's like the top job

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
that people like come down on

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
if you are really popular

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
you could

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
you could really

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
yeah you're right it doesn't pull down anything here

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
I don't know

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
I mean it's like if you are popular

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
that's why

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
you are popular by the definition now

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
you're a popular figure now

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
but you mean like

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
I don't know if you're paying attention to what happened

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
tonight for instance

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
part of being popular is also

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
I can affect people

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
you know like bad guys in the movies

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
you know what they do

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
they like stay in a castle and they use crystal balls

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
and long fingernails to make shit happen

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
that's writing

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
that's what that is

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
the good guys are out there

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
slaying demons with their actual sword

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
and like making out with chicks

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
like they go places and the

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
bad guy is like I'm angry at myself

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
and no one likes me so I'm gonna have

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
efficacy I'm gonna write

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
cheers

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
I want to touch people

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
but if I touch them in real life

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
they'll slap me

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
that's what writing is

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
it's a

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
gross person getting a hug

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
I can't believe

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
that's surprising to anybody

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
who do you think does this

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
that's so sad and so sweet at the same time

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
who do you think puts this kind of time

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
into that you know like a document

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
that says hug me, hug me, hug me, hug me, hug me

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
not a person that gets hugs all the time

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
I mean

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
now everyone's gonna rush the stage and hug me

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
alright you didn't

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
alright I'm kidding

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
why don't we get into

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
judges and dragons sweet

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
cheers

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
applause

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
do you want more players

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
or what

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
fuck no man

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
alright the gruesome twosome

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
hey man we still got character sheets

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
and shit

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
should I hold the music?

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
well let's check in with Spencer while he's sorting

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
our stuff out what's going on

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
what's it like being my assistant

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
this is the same question every week

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
it's been two weeks

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
it's cool I'm glad that

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
sometimes you know we feel more comfortable

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
talking about my weaknesses as an

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
assistant now

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
because you know

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
that sort of feedback is important to me

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
hopefully improve my job

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
where do you feel like you're dropping the ball Spencer?

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
I just uh I come from

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
a lot of jobs where you had like

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
everything to do 100% of the time

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
like at Apple like there's always things to organize

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
before that I worked at a book company

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
and like there was literally just

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
carts of books and they wouldn't stop

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
so it was like you know that sushi I love Lucy

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
thing but with books so

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
I mean so I'm not constantly

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
you mean the chocolate one?

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
yeah yeah sorry

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
that sushi thing it's like that sushi thing

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
in Drake and Josh

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
so um

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
I saw

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I saw the Isle of Lucy thing too to be fair

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
but um

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
yeah they executed a lot better

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
while

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
while I'm being the villain here

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
did anyone remember

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Eiffel 65?

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
no no not blue

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
they had other songs

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
specifically

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
that song playstation

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
does anyone remember the

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
playstation?

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
I don't even know what a Jake and Josh is

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
I don't know what you're talking about

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
it's cool it's cool

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
I'm just a playstation song

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
that's been stuck in my head

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
I'm blue

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
I'm blue blue blue

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
this is my nightmare

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
nah nah

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
blue was a good song also I mean

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
this is a song on a video game

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
no it was a song about

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
playstation and like Eiffel 65

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
they just like

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
they made their music in like Froot Loops or something

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
it was just like synth pop stuff

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
oh my god all these buzz words

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
I'm just seeing my words just

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
fly over your heads it's amazing

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
but yeah

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
is it one of them rock and rolly bands?

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
but all their song lyrics were just like

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
really really repetitive because they went

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
along with like the the dance

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
electronic kind of music

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
back then that was kind of repetitive sometimes

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
so it was just they were

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
most of the song was just

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
listing off video games

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
so are you saying you have that as an earworm right now?

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
are you struggling with that?

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I get the worst

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
I have an earworm song almost every day

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
and they're really bad

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
the worst when you have a song stuck in your head that you don't even know

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
you don't even know the words

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
so it's stuck in your head but you can't even sing it

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I heard somewhere

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
that the most important part of an earworm is like

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
the tempo like if you have a song

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
stuck in your head you have its tempo exactly

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
right so how do you

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
break that? I don't think you can

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
but I think it's like songs that have complicated

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
tempos that just doesn't happen to them

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
didn't Dino say that Colbert is cured?

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
I think Dino said that Stephen Colbert is cured

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
if we're getting a song that's stuck in your head out

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
it's just sing the song and then go

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
bymenin

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
then you're done

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
wait should we have a guest

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
play Krista Burke?

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
I asked that and you said no

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
I thought about it now

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
alright well let's have Julia

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
to play Mulraine Sedona

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
and I'm just going to go

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
by Guttons

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
and have Tyler reprise Krista Burke

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
alright Tyler to the stage

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
character sheets have been

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
dispensed so someone will pass mine down to me please

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
and Spencer

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
take it away sir

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
alright

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
when we last met

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
our heroes had been climbing

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
the spires of Admiral Darkstar's

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
black keep in order

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
to put a stop to the madman's

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
evil schemes

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
after filling their room with lava

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
the heroes took refuge on massive

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
stone statues but as they

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
plotted their next move they were interrupted

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
by a familiar face

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Brefi

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
that spider creature from the shadow

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
plane was back re-engineered

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
with metallic parts and a singular

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
focus

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
destroying quark

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
quickly quark climbed the chains

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
headbutting the cyborg spider with a dagger

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
strapped to his face

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
brefi shot back

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
I had nothing to do with that

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
that's true

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
that's narwhal

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
I mean I said it fine no one's going to get that

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
but you know

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
narwhal

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Jesus

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
you're not wrong

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
he shot spikes it hit him in the stomach

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
done

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
alright

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
alright so we're still in the midst of this fight with

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
our former ally turned

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
enemy

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
what's our 20 right now

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
so everyone but quark is standing

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
on these three statues think of him as

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
islands and a sea of lava

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
so above you lies a lattice

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
of linked chains forming a sort

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
of dizzying tangle or web of clanking

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
steel above

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
in this web of steel you can see

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
brefi's kind of situated in the middle

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
like a big spider

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
and quark you're up there with him you're headbutting

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
him in the face didn't he get a chain

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
impaled through him that

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
was you

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
get

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
you have a chain in your stomach

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
yeah reeled in

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
reeled in by the stomach chain

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
scorpion style

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
last I

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
remember I wanted this this was something that I

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
was into I wanted to pull him pull myself

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
to him I mean that's all you man

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
can I start off

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
by taking the dagger off of my head

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
yeah good call alright

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
I'm an incredible pain but that's a good idea

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
you hear the skittering

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
scratching metal grate and you see

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
steel pulp plates open up

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
in brefi's armor

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
you see spider like metal

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
things scramble out of his body

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
and go into the the

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
tangle of chains around you

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
spiders are all over the place

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
robot spider yeah

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
the worst kind and is the

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
is the lava still rising oh yeah

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
and how much how much you're fine

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
you're way ahead of everybody else there

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
these guys are in in dire straits

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
I'm on brefi's back right

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
you weren't uh yeah

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
no no different I don't think so

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
okay he was he was

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
thank you Adam Goldberg yeah

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
yeah

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
give credit where credits do

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
you were on one of these islands

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
in the long run Monterey

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
you should get a population four million

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
you should get up here in the

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
chains with us and fight this robot

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
asshole

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
um I

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
want you um do I have

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
rope you do

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
okay so I tie a rope

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
why does everybody tie everything to everything

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
sorry go ahead so I tie

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
my rope to my arrow and I

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
shoot it

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
two torches like somewhere

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
where you can get attached so I can

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
you know grappling hook style oh yeah

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
okay gotcha so I shoot two arrows

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
just one

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
you shoot

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
one arrow

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
as you shoot you realize you must

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
have not tied the rope or something

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
correctly oh poopies

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
the arrow is pulled into the lava

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
trailing with it all the

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
rope falls into the lava

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
blah blah

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
don't applaud that Adam that's a crit I

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
rolled a critical fell if anyone's wondering

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
so that's why that happened oh I'm not

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
just vindictive

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
also a rope is critically heavier than

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
an arrow yeah it really throws out

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
the aerodynamics

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
but I mean mostly the one the arrow

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
dynamics yeah

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
no no arrows use

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
aerodynamics

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
so do aeroplanes

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
aeroplanes

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
putting it at

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Sharpie's turn really

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
well shocking grasp on brefi

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000

standing well one quick

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
question yeah he has a metal chain

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
coming out of him that's in me

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
times for me

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
well I mean that would have been a great

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
question to ask 20 seconds ago

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
son of a bitch

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
I think it'll be okay

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
shocking grasp

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
you feel him

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
kind of buckle under the electric

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
stress of the lightning but he doesn't

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
move further you like that

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000

I mean not great right but

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I'm not thinking my stomach

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
and electrocuted correct okay

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
putting it at quark's turn

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
all right it's clearly

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
me that he's mad at because I

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
fucked him and then stabbed him in the back of the neck

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
and killed him a long time ago

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
in that order

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
I think I so yeah

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
as I recall I got up on top of him he was unconscious

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
and I said I wooed him to sleep kind

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
of I was really romantic and then

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
I started fucking him and I took a sword

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
out and drove it through the back of his skull

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
right yeah well as long as you were

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
romantic about it

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
if it's worth doing it's worth

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
doing right I take

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
up my far sword with a flaming sword

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
and I use my far sword attack on brephy

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
using your far sword

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
attack on brephy you cut a wide

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
swath of flame

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
it hits

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
yeah

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
you strike brephy

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
in three of his legs

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
they're burned

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
he takes 10

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
damage and your far sword wave

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
continues on slicing through several

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
of these chains and causing them to

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
fall and kind of hang hang down

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
ooh yeah

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
that could be good we could use us to climb up maybe

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
yeah as it happens he kind of readjusts

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
his balance to compensate for this

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
he's not but he's unsteady now that he's

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
all these wounded legs going on

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
ooh go for the legs you guys he can't

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
stay up there without legs

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
most of us can't

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
just let me know when it's my turn

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
I will putting it at

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Christopher's turn

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
okay uh no seriously

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
I don't know when it's my turn

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
I definitely will

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
don't worry we'll let you know

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
I just said that

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
I'm helping

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
so I have a chain in me that's not great

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I'm attached to him

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
I'm going to use

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
my armor to autumn and go invisible

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
and see if I can get a little bit closer to him

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
without him noticing that

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
you might notice I'm attached to him

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
but I'm going to at least try

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
I'd like to get in closer to him while

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
he's at it

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
yep that happens I was just making sure

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
you didn't run out of invisibilities for the day

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Christopher he's hanging up

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
of these chains by three legs

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
if he falls in and you're attached to him

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
aren't you going into the lava with him

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
whatever it takes

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
wow

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
fucking california man

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
you go

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
invisible on the end of the chain

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
okay

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
putting it at

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
I'm invisible now

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
these things happen

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
putting it at breffie's turn

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
breffie turns his head all the way around

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
like a robot

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
owl person from that movie

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
clash of the titans

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
no no

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
exorcism the exorcist

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
well there is a robot owl in clash of the titans

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
there's all sorts of things in all sorts of places

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
but Jeff

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
you just got to keep your head up

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
you're right Spencer

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
you're

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
sorry I have a question

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
and as his head turns around to look at sharpie

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
his eyes begin to glow red

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
beams of light emit from them

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
I assume that's the red light of remorse

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
and I just want to say you don't have to

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
feel bad we've all made mistakes

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
siding with admiral darkstar

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
was one of yours

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
murdering you for no reason was ours

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
I

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
don't want to throw my friend into the bus

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
but we've always wondered about him

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
you felt the pain

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
you felt the burn now let's

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
all live and learn

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
usually I let like the speech

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
happen but light is faster

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
I mean it's the speed of light

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
so about like three words

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
into that

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
your speech turns into something

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
more resembling like ahhh

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
or something

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
you take eight damage of searing

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
blazing heat

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
alright you're gonna keep track of that right?

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
yeah I think you and Krista

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Berg are pretty much the only people hurt right now

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
anyway

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
she's alright

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
at the same time the

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
spiders start to scuttle down the chains

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
and start to get closer to all of you

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
they start to

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
they don't start they just

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
finish jumping upon you

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
it wasn't a joke I mean

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
no it's not

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
I mean that's what I just said

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
anyway

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
quark manages to dodge however the rest of you

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
get hit by robotic spiders

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
you feel a kind of sharp sting as they try

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
and you feel their legs poking into your back

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
they stick stick onto your

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
bodies

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
get it off

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
I'm immersed

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
this is an acupuncture

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
don't panic everybody I'll go just

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
I'll fuck them and kill them all

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
can your dick stand

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
all these metal spiders

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
we're gonna find out

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
thank you

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
well done

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
putting it at more instant

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
putting it at more instant

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
what are you gonna do more

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
yeah yeah I'm thinking

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
yeah I'm terrified by

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
that metallic spider

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
my back

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
so

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
fuck

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
I

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
I don't know

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
like

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
how much space I have in my island

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
you're on a space about three feet square

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
there's about three feet above your head

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
or some of these chains you might be able to grab on

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
I think in metric

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
three feet three feet's a meter

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
I think that's a pretty fair thing to know

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
two liters of chains

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
okay that's not too bad

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
okay so I have like

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
this okay I'm

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
thinking

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
okay

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
how much pain am I

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
I mean not much

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
it's more the weirdness of a

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
metal spider being on you that's the problem you know

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
okay could I just like

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
shove it off you can try

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
it's on your back it would be hard to shove

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
what if I'm very

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
flexible

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
we'll see

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
you try and grab

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
at it and you get at it with both hands

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
but you can't prize it off your back

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
oh well there's a turn

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
now you got you got you got a move action

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
if you'd like one oh

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
get up on these chains

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
what

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
oh yeah well since I can't do that

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
I'll just try to climb

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
make sense to me 495

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
for the rice erotic

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
you leap up on a chain

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
start to pull yourself into the web

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
putting it at

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
now Dan it's your turn Sharpie's turn

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
as I was saying

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
you

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
are clearly

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
stricken low Breffi

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
you have chosen your foes

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
and alliances unwisely

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
I understand why you chose them

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
but now you need to look at how

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
practical those choices are

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
for we will kill you soon

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
and you will only be left with

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
death and integrity

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
join us now

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
and have shame

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
and life

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
do we really want a

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
robotic spider that

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
quark has fucked following us or

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
fucked and killed? he'll be like our slimer

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
he'll like help us

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
are you implying that the ghostbusters fucked

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
slimer

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
look I don't know what happened that night

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
I wasn't involved with that

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
I just know that we angered this spider

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
it was a lot of misunderstanding

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
like we go through this universe Breffi

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
I'm talking to him

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
and we have random encounters

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
with monsters

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
we didn't craigslist this

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
come on

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
and some of those encounters have non-conflict resolutions

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
some of them don't appear to

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
and you know things

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
go off half cocked and I don't know people get hurt

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
and I'm saying to you

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
brother

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
with my

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
11 Charisma

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
and my

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
12 in decipher

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
script

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
I'm saying

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
I can read the script of

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
your face

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
and I decipher your feelings

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
I forgive you

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
do you forgive me

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
no

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
while he's been while this is

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000
nice that you're doing this long conversation because I've been using this time to climb around to get into

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
prime fucking and killing position behind Breffi

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
in that order

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
oh yeah all right

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
okay

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
all right

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
how close am I is my turn

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
I don't know are you done

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
can I do something else

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
shocking grasp

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
despite being on his back

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
something about something

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
maybe it was just the long speech

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
to avoid your attack

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
you managed to miss touching him

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
or being on his back

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
all right

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
I guess I accept that

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
maybe you ran out of breath

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
how close am I to the chains

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
that he that Breffi is

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
hanging from

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
you're about five feet away pretty close

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
okay can I use a cleave and try to

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
get both of the chains

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
okay I take my mighty sword and do a cleave

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
are you guys still attached to him

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
this is a bad idea

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
everybody get off

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
I pour a vial

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
acid on my chain I have one of those

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
um shit

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
can I

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
release him into the lava with you guys attached to him

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
I mean

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
I have a wire saw I can go

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
I'm trying really hard

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
that would just release you into the lava earlier

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
am I

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
solely being suspended by the chain that he impaled me on

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
yeah you're not

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
yeah

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
you're like an ornament

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
I mean do it man

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
if he falls in the lava

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
as I'm about to do that I realize

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
that would be a terrible thing to do

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
so I

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
I go for cleave and try to get his remaining legs

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
you try to go for the cleave

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
on the remaining legs

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
you strike but one of them

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
dealing

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Jesus Christ

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
17 damage

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
yeah

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
his leg is shorn completely off

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
and falls into the orange lava

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
so how many legs does he have now

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
I'm attached to him

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
yeah

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
can I can I can I try to make a grab for a chain

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
just his leg falls into the lava

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
just like he's right just the leg

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
okay all right and he has three

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
damaged legs that are still attached to his body

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
I mean no all only

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
one leg is gone

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
three are damaged okay the rest

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
are healthy legs

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
he I can assume he has the

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
the the proper ragnate eight legs

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
yeah okay just counting

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
in my head four

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
cool three not so cool ones gone

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
putting it at

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Christopher Stern all right

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
I didn't realize I was suspended

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
solely on a chain like an ornament

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
yeah um

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
this stuff I want to get let me

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
I want to kind of get to it as a move action

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
can I like try to get on the chain

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
so I'm not solely suspended by him

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
you'd have to pull yourself up by this chain

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
okay let's let's try

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
let's do it trying to

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
do that you tug at

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
the chains but is in vain

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
you can't

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
you can't do it what's what's

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
beneath me well I might

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:58.000
a lot of shit try to swing yourself

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
swing yourself to it I mean

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
I can try swing I mean I kind of want to get this

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
chain off of me though I have

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
I think first thing first is

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
get yourself onto a chain that you can actually like

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
you want to be on like pitfall

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
over to one of those things let me see

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
if I can get some momentum on myself to get myself closer

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
one of those chains

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
all right you managed to swing yourself up

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
you're starting to get some momentum

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
but it's going to take another turn to actually

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
eat that high sounds good

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
you're getting you're getting going though it's pretty good

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
I'm really excited about how fast

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
it's like a it's like a metronome

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
or something great yeah

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
is that another metric system thing

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
no a metric no no

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
it's not bad I'm sorry

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
anyway

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
it's worth a try it was worth a try

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
putting it at breffy's turn

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
it was no aerodynamics

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
I mean you mean

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
it was no pun, but what is

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
anyway

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
you feel these metal spiders

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
all up in your back they're digging in deeper

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
and they're they're pulling in tighter and it's hurting

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
it's hurting and now

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
they're starting to heat up they're feeling

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
warm they're feeling hot

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
who are you talking to you got

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
to get all you got

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
the shiatsu like a hot

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
stone now like you're like you're sitting in a

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
in a nope

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
I just

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
it's more like a metal spider that is

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
dug upon your back is now not a sharper image

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
temperature

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
anyway as that happens

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
you see you see breffy

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
his eyes now they're glowing again they're

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
not glowing red though like the lasers they're glowing

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
green and you see crackling energy

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
develop on his skin

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
and it actually goes out and it arcs

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
enlightening arcs directly

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
at you and you feel all these lightings

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
going through your bodies

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
and they hit the spider

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
on your backs and you feel it just

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
light up white hot on your back

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
and it burns and it burns and your skin

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
is melting and the charred

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
metal spiders fall off as electrical

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
energy surges through your bodies

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
dealing

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
quark you take seven

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Chris de Burgh takes eleven yeah I

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
didn't have a spider on me you didn't

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
that's true quark

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
you take zero

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Chris de Burgh takes eleven

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
mole rain also takes eleven

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
dash

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
sharpie takes twelve I didn't have a spider

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
on me you you did

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
it's not going to work

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
it's not just that I'm trying to

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
try to jet I mind too expensive

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
I mean from my perspective

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
that's how it works well he was

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
he was right I mean I totally forgot

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
that I missed him well sorry

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
sorry Jeff I have

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
my arm load of winter maybe I can like

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
the spiders are all gone though now oh yeah so

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
that was kind of a like a good thing

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
and a bad thing at once the spiders are off

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
you but now they're you got well yeah it's

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
kind of like when a guy stabs you he no

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
longer has a knife

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
I'm dying you know I was over lining

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
there so I'm dying more

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
yeah but there's one less bullet

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
in his gun let's

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
let's let's let's knock this guy off his

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
chains putting it up more rain's turn

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
okay um

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
can I suit up

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
wait what

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
did you say suit up

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
okay no I I

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
thought you said can I suit up yeah yeah

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
I have a cloak of resistance

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
I'm just being prevented

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
for the next tiny little spiders well

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
you're already wearing that that's on your body

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
well I didn't know that it's a I'm

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
just telling you I am being

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
grateful for the information

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
so in that

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
case

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
I'm going to shoot two arrows

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
to one of the injured legs

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
three now

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
oh I'm sorry like I said I

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
can't listen to the podcast without feeling depressed

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
so

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
I shot three arrows

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
what's that

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
you fired three arrows

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
two of them strike true

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
woo

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
being a useful woman

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
I mean

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
a useful female character

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
dealing 16

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
damage

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
that was uh

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
that was very dynamic

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
with those arrows which you did there was a

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
very aerodynamic

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
yeah I applaud

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
that pun

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
I

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
thought that was funny and then I got it

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
yeah right

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
that's not how it works that's not how it works

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
you thought it was funny first yeah if you have to think

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
about it then it's still funny

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
that's how the saying goes right

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
yeah

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
like if someone tickles you if you think

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
about it there's no reason to laugh at that

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Christopher

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
my turn um no no I'm sorry

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Sharpie sir sorry Sharpie there's

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
both the AR sounds in both your names it's

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
like

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
character design 101

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Sharpie knock him off those chains

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
all right

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
I'm on top of them oh

uh

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
I'm still swinging I'm gonna assume that uh

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
I'm at a shocking grass yeah

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
that's like three yeah

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
and I'm gonna assume that reduced person doesn't

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
work on a spider person correct

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
even though I knew him as a person that's true

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
it is reduced person

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
a physically reducing

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
size of a person yeah yeah

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
okay so so just do

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
do Uncle Dana favor just indulge me

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
for a second I was raised

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
in an era of video games

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
I can't picture what the hell's

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
going on right now we are in a room

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
that's filling with lava there's chains

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
hanging down in a sort of web

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
webbishness yeah

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
he breath he is now in

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
that webbishness yeah

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
and I'm on his back uh

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
what's his knuckle is like hanging

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
from yeah

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
like a like a shot out

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
from breathy yeah he shot

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
a chain out of his chest cavity and he's

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
hanging from another chain

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
or he's just he's swinging right now like trying

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
with the chain like this hurts so much but

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
I need to get another chain it really does

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
hanging from breathy yeah

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
yeah and I'm like a

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
I'm an ornament all right

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
an accessory I'm an invisible

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
I'm an invisible I'm an invisible

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
always saying as a chain

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
is swinging I'm here

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
you guys it's not just the chain

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
I swear

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
I know there's something really you're like

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
the invisible straps on the invisible

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
straps bra

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
I am kind of like a bra aren't I

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
wow

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
okay I'm sorry I started the pun thing

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
let's leave it

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
yeah well you have to deal with this now

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
I can't shrink

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
item on the chain in his chest and make it

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
small enough to come out of his chest yeah that would work

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
well I just fall right into the lava I'm going to rule

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
you can do all right if I cast

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
if I cast ray of frost

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
on the lava underneath underneath

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Tyler can Tyler land on the

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
no you have this thing called the

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
staff of ice or something

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
that also has ice powers but it's

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
not a zero level spell

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
right right of

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
frost right of frost

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
if I do you think that if I use that on

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
the magma beneath his feet that it would turn it into

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
a kind of regular stone like

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
city and he could make ice cream on it

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
I want to do a camera take right now

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
who knows man

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
right of frost underneath

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Christopher's feet

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
bringing you right of frost to bear you pull

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
the trigger it has a trigger

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
on it

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
why don't you snow

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
a seat

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
I'll use my

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
route of rewrites later

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
I'll throw it to a room

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
a cold blue cone of

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
emanating frosty energy

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
sprays into the lava and it

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
creates a thick hard shell

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
on the surface

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
yeah

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
yeah

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
you know how the dinosaurs died

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
it wasn't as most people

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
maintain a giant meteor that hit the earth

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
and cast enough dust into the sky to cause

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
the food chain to be disrupted

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
it was the ice age

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
you got there

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
I used to see it I used to seat you

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
I used to see

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
you

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
it's not just a play of words it's like

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000

putting it at quark's turn

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
I used I take my mighty sword

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
and do a tack straight into a

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
breathy's face parts

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
you could cut the chain and I could fall into the ice to you

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
just

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
I want to kill this guy yeah because

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
we don't know how long the ice and the lava is going to last

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
there's still lava under there can melt at any moment

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
yeah it's not a support workshop for you

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
I mean I did my part you know

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
listen I was having a bad day

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
got a better mind of it and I went wait

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
maybe this isn't such a great idea that I charge to him

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
and said why don't you throw a chain into me

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000

turn blue

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000

blue lights and you guys all

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
awareness

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
subtle political atmosphere than this

you had a whole round to think of that

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
but I swear to God I just

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
thought of it now

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
I promise that

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
came across

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
what

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
he meets his chilling fate

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
let's not turn on each other

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
all right

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
okay look they cannot be

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
good they cannot be good we already had

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
one terrible frost pun we don't need more

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
always like ice puns that we get

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
we get stuck on well because there's a heavy

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
tradition of that with that movie

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
it's amazing that youtube clip of all of

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Arnold's ice puns in a row

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
fantastic and you can't remember any of them

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
well there's the one about the

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
like you know the dinosaurs died

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
the ice age and it's like wait a

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
minute the only one

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
anyone remembers is ice to meet you like

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
do you remember any of it I don't remember any of the

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
one just chill out and

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
yeah

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
it wasn't an invitation

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
I'm sorry I said anything he said that

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
I'm detective Don Kimball

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
gentlemen

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
a cold meeting

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
is about to happen

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
all right what the fuck happened

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
I'm sorry

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
a lot of terrible

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
puns

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
it dealt 13 damage

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
yeah

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
ice to face head

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
and you see his other

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
eye kind of start to flicker

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
and go out and his head

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
starts to

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
twitches a bit like a person's

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
twitching might look

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
and then he begins to

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
fall into the drink

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
I'm not done starring yet

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
help

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
you're on his back still

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
that's why I jump

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
and I use the spell jump

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
nah you can't cast that but you can jump normal

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
style I jump normal style

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
okay

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
jumping off of him as he

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
falls he crashes to the

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
crusty lava floor

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
and he hits with a thump

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
and you see cracks begin

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
to appear in this lava floor

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
how long is this chain attaching him to

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
well as he falls you know you're

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
sighing viciously at this chain

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
and the impact combined

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
with all the sighing all this hard work

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
you've done causes the chain to snap

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
right at the point of sighing

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
success yeah it's all

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
convenient shit

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
is brefi alive or dead

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
he's not quite dead

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
but he's also not moving you see cracks

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
develop in the lava

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
floor and they get wider his lava

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
I think the, I think Quark is asking

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
is there a time for me how

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
how much time do I have

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
before this lava lava is

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
starting to consume them as we speak

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
you're gonna have to you're gonna have to

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
this rope

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
shit do I mean how bad do I want to fuck

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
brefi again

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
I'll throw you a rope this is risky

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
I have one hand on it

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
the chain's freedom

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
against everything I believe in

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
I tie a rope to myself

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
and I fasten it

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
to the chain and around my chest

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
and I swing down as I'm swinging

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
this is gonna be a hard combat maneuver

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
I unzip

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
I loosen

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
my pants and I try to give him a quick one

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
as I swing by

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
I

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
don't know I just I go down like mission impossible

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
like I got and I come down

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
the arms I stretch my

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
my boner for the go straight down

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
and I try to like

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
I try to like become like a spider

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
which is like it looks consumed

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
by passion your rope tying

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
skills aren't what they usually

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
are and as you

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
lower yourself in perfect

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
raping position

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
the rope slips

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
and you fall directly on to the corpse

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
of brefi okay fuck

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
him real fast

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
as he sigs into

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
the hot lava oh no

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
I jump back off

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
or do you fuck him real fast

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
shit

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
give me a second how fast are you

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
give me a second we need a number

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
somebody throw me a rope

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
I already offered to throw him a rope I

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
I have a free hand now let me throw him a rope I

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
do you have a rope

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
I have 150 feet of rope okay cool

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
I grab the rope and

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
I know this is important

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
can I throw in my button staff

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
that staff that has the button on it

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
that when you press the button it stays in place

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
okay

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
rope and button staff

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
coming at you quark I grab the

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
button staff it's got the button

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
I grab the button staff

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
and I hold on to it

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
and it's kind of like Indiana Jones when he's looking

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
at the idol or do I let the thing close

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
and he's going down

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
and I grab the button staff and I fuck

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
him real quick and I jump out of the staff

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
and

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
and shit I need a line

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
give me a line

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
look at me

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
I'm a lava not a fighter

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
I'm a lava not a fighter

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
I'm a lava

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
not a fighter

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
that's the best reaction you can hope for with a pun

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
I think

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
we only had the hots for that spider

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
yeah

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
that that that was appropriate

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
thank you guys

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
that's such a downer man

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
yeah okay so if I fuck him

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
and I jump back on I hold on to the rod

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
and the rope yeah and so he's now

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
does he go away into the lava I mean

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
touching the button on the

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
button staff you extend

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
the staff as it pierces through

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
the crusty lava layer and into

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
the molten lava

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
you don't know what's happening for a while

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
but then you feel yourself rising up

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
on the staff into the chains

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
you get into the chains

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
but then the staff

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
becomes hot in your hands too hot to touch

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
I grab a chain I grab a chain

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
you grab the chain as the staff

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
melts into molten

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
metal

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
sludge

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
before he even says anything

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
I give him a look that says

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
yeah

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
you did the right thing

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
as it drifts

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
under the lava

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
you just did what we were all thinking man

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
