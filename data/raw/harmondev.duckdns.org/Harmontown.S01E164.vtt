00:00.000 --> 00:17.000
From Hollywood, California, Sunset Boulevard, Sunset Strip, Meltdown Comics, and Nerdmelt Theater Harmontown is now in session.

00:17.000 --> 00:31.000
Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden in our Game Master.

00:31.000 --> 00:43.000
And just for good measure, let's bring out the good mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:43.000 --> 01:02.000
Thank you. Thank you very, very much. You're always very kind, even though we keep doing this over and over again. You guys keep reacting so it's like they're happy every time.

01:02.000 --> 01:10.000
I feel like this crowd is extra special, happy tonight. There's something about this crowd.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
There is electricity and a free song in the air right now.

01:14.000 --> 01:23.000
And yet we say that all the time. It's not always the exact same people, but they always fall for that too.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
I feel like they must be smarter than last week's audience somehow.

01:29.000 --> 01:43.000
I don't know if they're smarter. I think that they're leaning farther downhill. They're ready for more of a free fall. You guys are up for an adventure more than last week, I think, right?

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
I think you guys want to go on a bear hunt.

01:48.000 --> 02:00.000
A lot of people are like, wait, what is that? Is that like a weird college thing? Is that like a fratty whore?

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
We had a bear hunt, but it got cut out of the episode.

02:06.000 --> 02:20.000
Yeah, so I imagine it exists somewhere on the Harmontown Extra if you buy the platinum package or whatever and you get all the unedited cities if you go to the Nashville one.

02:20.000 --> 02:35.000
In my blackout, blind drunk, I take the audience on a bear hunt, which was a thing that we did in my daycare center that I remember at Red Carpet Bowling Lanes.

02:35.000 --> 02:48.000
The parents would drop the kids off and then the kids would just roll around on the linoleum and traumatize each other, but then every once in a while an old lady would say, let's go on a bear hunt.

02:48.000 --> 03:01.000
And then after that she'd go, okay, now you can go play with the toys and the three fastest kids would get to the dirty big wheel first and I'd hide under a table.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
A girl put a crayon in my mouth.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
She came up to you and put a crayon in your mouth?

03:09.000 --> 03:25.000
She put a crayon in my mouth and looking back at it as an adult, what I picture, the weird thing is, I hate her so much, but also I'm able to recognize, because she said something like, you could be pretty or something.

03:25.000 --> 03:32.000
She was really wanting to use the crayon as lipstick. She wanted to put lipstick on me.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
She was giving you a makeover?

03:33.000 --> 03:44.000
Yeah, which is probably flirting as far as what 40-year-olds are concerned. I don't know how old we were, but on one hand I'm able to recognize that she meant no harm.

03:44.000 --> 03:59.000
And on the other hand, I still, at 42, I still have all of the revulsion and hatred that my tiny brain felt because I had no idea what the hell, why would someone lunge at me and stick a crayon in my lips?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Did she ram it into your mouth or did she?

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
She had bad aim. Our muscles were protoplasmic.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Do you think there was a chance that she was trying to be inclusive?

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
Yeah, that's what I just said.

04:15.000 --> 04:23.000
Oh, you mean inclusive, you mean like progressively, like she was thinking about gender roles? No, I think she was like Drew Barrymore and I was ET.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
She was doing a clumsy job of befriending you.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.000
She wanted to play house. She wanted to play, you know, maybe she wanted to play sexy time, I don't know.

04:33.000 --> 04:46.000
But I don't think she was like, you know, she wasn't, it's years from that age before kids developed the part of their brain that knows that I'm a disgusting monster.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
That comes right before a sense of direction.

04:52.000 --> 05:04.000
They've done studies where they put six year old girls into an MRI and they study the centers of their brains that light up and they show a picture of Dan Harmon.

05:04.000 --> 05:13.000
And from five and a half to six, it's like same section as ice cream or like a fire hydrant.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
I shouldn't have said same section as ice cream.

05:17.000 --> 05:27.000
Yeah, because we live in this now, we're all pedophiles era where everything, every time you mentioned a child where our brains are waiting for the pedophile thing.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
So I said ice cream was just something you like.

05:31.000 --> 05:38.000
So let's just abandon this whole thing.

05:38.000 --> 05:44.000
But well, to finish my thought, then at six they show it.

05:44.000 --> 05:55.000
And they show a picture of me and then it's like, oh, they shut, it's the space shuttle Challenger exploding or a Shrek or, I don't know, like a chicken, chicken, chicken pox.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
What is six year olds hate?

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
Oh, when our space program goes all right, that's what they hate.

06:04.000 --> 06:14.000
When you were elementary school, preschool through fifth grade, was there ever any flirtation romance stories in your life?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Was it ever not awkward?

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
Oh, God, well, I almost spent to remember when I was in the car with you.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Oh, yeah.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Every day for the last two years.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
That was great, man.

06:23.000 --> 06:34.000
I feel like you're not supposed to, now that it's not like a black box cabaret show anymore, but I want to say her whole name.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
I mean, because that was all she was, was a name.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
And this little, literally a little redhead girl, which is like a Charlie Brown thing.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
It was kindergarten.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
See, the lipstick girl, the Korean girl, was like, what are you doing?

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
She was probably a brunette or something.

06:49.000 --> 06:57.000
But my first, because it was when Yvonne Craig passed away and I was thinking about, oh, Yvonne Craig.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
And I was thinking of early, what was my first redhead moment?

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Well, I didn't know they were redhead.

07:04.000 --> 07:21.000
Yeah, what was my first kind of like spark of, what is it, acetaminophen that makes you, I don't know.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
I don't have to explain anything.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
I think it's funny.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
I'm laughing at myself.

07:25.000 --> 07:33.000
But if they isolated the chemical that makes you fall in love and it's acetaminophen, and everyone's like, oh, this explains everything.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
We were never looking for that connection.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
I, oh God, I got married because I had a hangover.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
And I, oh my God, acetaminophen.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
That's it.

07:44.000 --> 07:55.000
The, anyways, the, yeah, Nicole, it was, it was, in kindergarten, they take roll call and they go, they say, you know, they, you know, they say your name.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
And then you go here.

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
Dan, back it up and walk me through this.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
And pretend I never went to school and explain.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
My last name was Harmon.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
Back then, my first name was either, it was probably, was it Daniel or Danny?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Probably Daniel.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Yeah, probably Daniel.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Yeah, Daniel, yeah, for sure.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
Is this the same class where the Royal Champagne went to?

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
No, that was middle school.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
No, nobody in kindergarten stood up and said, you may call me Royal Champagne.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
That would be amazing.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Wait, no, we're kindergarten.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
We're still, some of us are still pooping our pants.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
To this very day.

08:40.000 --> 08:50.000
And so, and so I, like, we, you know, sitting in a circle, and the way we sat and the order in which our names were called, there was always this pattern.

08:50.000 --> 08:57.000
So, and the H's come before the M's and her name, you know, let's just cross our fingers.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
Maybe she won't sue us and that this isn't defamation of any kind.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Her name seems like, I'm not going to change her name.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Her name was Nicole McHugh.

09:04.000 --> 09:13.000
It was such a, such a, you know, it's such a perfect, like, it's like fictional, like kind of first, first, you know, little girl crush kind of name.

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
And she, and then Daniel Harmon, and I'd go, and I don't know, I don't know who started it.

09:19.000 --> 09:34.000
And what happened, but, but, like, somehow, just the tradition became that whenever my name was called, I would, I would say here, and I'd look at her, and she'd smile, and we'd both smile, and then we'd giggle.

09:34.000 --> 09:40.000
And then, and then name, name, name, piece of shit, random piece of shit.

09:40.000 --> 09:47.000
And then, and then the same, and then when Nicole McHugh, and she would raise her hand and we would lock eyes again, and then giggle and smile.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
And it was like, that was the entire relationship.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
I never talked to her on the playground.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
And I probably made the whole thing up in my head.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
I probably, I probably just created huge gaps where she was probably giggling at everybody.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
No, I really don't think that.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Well, of course you don't think that, Dan.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
You made it up in your head.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
You invented thoughts.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Of course you think them.

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
But I, well, I don't, I don't, I don't remember them as hallucinations.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
I had the same thing with, with like kindergarten, I think, with the same initials, NM.

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
Her name was Nancy Mendelson, and I had this fantasy relationship with her that never existed.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
I don't, I don't know that we ever spoke to each other, but in my mind that, wow, we were quite in love.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
And I don't think I ever had a moment's conversation with her.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
It's all downhill from there, man.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
You know, isn't it?

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Spencer, do you have, do you have an early, like, proto relationship like that?

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Nah, man, you guys are fucking nerds.

10:40.000 --> 10:50.000
Okay, we have a new segment.

10:50.000 --> 11:02.000
This new, this, this new segment is called, um, uh, possibly awesome ideas I, I, I came up with during a blackout drunk at the TV guide showrunners party.

11:02.000 --> 11:13.000
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, sometimes TV guide has a party, and they invite all the smarties that make the TV like Shonda Rhimes,

11:13.000 --> 11:21.000
and Dan Harmon gets invited some of the time except for season four, and he'll never forget it.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
But now he's back, and he's at the table because Rick and Morty showed them all I was able,

11:26.000 --> 11:41.000
so I get to sit there and get real drunk, and I talk too loud, and I feel bad the next morning.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
There's a little iced tea in there.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
You're about to get sued three times.

11:48.000 --> 11:55.000
Well, you know, that's, that's just business.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
So, okay, so I came up with this idea, like, like, like, Chris McKenna was there.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
I was, I asked him, I don't know, I wrote it down.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
I was like, I'm so proud of this idea.

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
I have no idea how, like, like, I was like, okay, so it's a dystopian premise.

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
It's called Peek Hitler, uh, peak, like, peak oil.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
Is it because in the, it's in the future where, what I wrote down is, but this guy was drunk,

12:18.000 --> 12:31.000
like, a world where temporally oligarchic corporations draw oil from the subcutaneous residue of a supposedly infinite supply of Hitlers.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
Supposedly.

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
So, like, like, in the future they find out that, like, like, there's everyone right under their scalp,

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
or between their skull and their brain, or maybe right between their scalp and their skull, who knows,

12:45.000 --> 12:53.000
or maybe at the base of their spine, but let's just, everyone has, like, a, just a tiny little bit of, of oil that you could use to run a car.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
Like, like sperm whales used to have, like, the giant gallons of, yeah.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Yeah.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Like, lamp oil.

12:59.000 --> 13:08.000
So, so, you know, a corporation, you know, goes like, look, we have time travel now, and there are infinite timelines.

13:08.000 --> 13:14.000
Raise your hand if you're against drilling into Hitler.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
And everyone's like, that's the cold up in the movie, everyone's like, nice.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Okay.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
And then they're like, the lack of nays have it.

13:22.000 --> 13:28.000
Mobile Time Warner will commence with its Hitler oil campaign.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
And then you can, and then it goes, 3,080.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
And then there's like, because I, I, I think,

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
Do they keep going back in time and drilling into the same Hitler, or are there, are there more than one?

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
There's infinite Hitlers.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Infinite Hitlers.

13:41.000 --> 13:47.000
And at the same time, Hitler does or doesn't slip in the shower or take a, take an art class or whatever.

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
Like, he becomes a technically different Hitler from the, from, from all the other Hitlers.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
But they're all Hitler.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Therefore.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
So you got quantum, quantum.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
And infinite oil is infinite oil, baby.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
It doesn't matter if you get one drop per Hitler.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
And so, and so you see the process, but this, that's the, that's the ordinary world.

14:07.000 --> 14:14.000
And then the, and then the threshold you cross is like, there's a technician who's like, he encounters like a, it's like, you know,

14:14.000 --> 14:25.000
The question of like, I think this guy was, I don't, I don't, I don't know if this, I don't know if this guy was going to end up being that bad a Hitler.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
One of the alternate Hitlers.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Yeah, he's like, like, like that's like the big moment.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
He was a good artist.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
It's like, it's like, it's like Project X with Matthew Broderick.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
Matthew Broderick is the guy who's in charge of like, or Minority Report.

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
It's like, you know, it's like any other, like, like, you, you know, you have a guy who's in charge of doing this thing.

14:41.000 --> 14:47.000
And this is the way the world works is you take a Hitler, you put like a transparent plastic dome on his head.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
Like, while he's walking down an alleyway in Austria or something.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
And, and, and he's like, oh, got in the Himmel.

14:55.000 --> 15:02.000
And you're, and you're like, you know, and you're like, look, I know you can't understand me, but, but, but, but, but trust me, you're Hitler.

15:02.000 --> 15:09.000
And, like, this is, this is going to hurt you more than it's going to hurt my car.

15:09.000 --> 15:15.000
And then it's like the title sequence.

15:15.000 --> 15:20.000
And I know I have a lot of cold opens in this movie, but.

15:20.000 --> 15:27.000
So, but then the threshold is like a guy is like, like, you know, there's like a guy, I don't like the drill bit breaks or something.

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
And then it's like something goes wrong. And then the Hitler starts running and the guy's like, God damn it.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
We got to fucking wait.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
It's like, this is temporal.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
Let's see. I mean, numbers seven, five, two, we got, we got a runner. I'll, I'll get him.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
And he's like, chases him, chases him back to Hitler's apartment.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
And he kind of, he's like, let me in there, Hitler.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
You're fucking Hitler.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
I know you don't get that.

15:46.000 --> 15:52.000
And he's like, I'm kicking down that fucking door, Hitler.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
I'm kicking it down.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
I don't care if you have a Walther P 38 under the, under your mattress.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Nice.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
I bet you will try to shoot me because you're Hitler.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
But, but it won't matter because like, and it kicks down the door.

16:06.000 --> 16:12.000
And then the camera pushes on just an adorable Hitler.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Like, who do you cast as adorable Hitler?

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Who's the actor?

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Well.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
Don't get sued a fourth time.

16:20.000 --> 16:32.000
I'm probably not Hugh Jackman, but at the same time, I don't know.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
Like, and it's not, you know, let's put a pin in that.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Okay.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
But it's like, the point is like, like, like, like it's, maybe it's a CG Hitler.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
Maybe it's like, maybe it's like Gollum, you know, you create a Hitler so that you can

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
get really accurate.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
I think you put like a Jake Gyllenhaal or a Tove McGuire in there.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
I think you make it like.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Oh, Jake Gyllenhaal.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Yeah.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Toby McGuire is good.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
I like that.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Yeah.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Toby.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Oh no.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Elijah Wood.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Who?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Oh yeah.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Elijah Wood.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Oh man.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Okay.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
That's our Hitler.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Guys, we got our Hitler.

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
So it pushes on him and he's doing, you know, fill in the blanks.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
This is, you know, I'm a structure guy.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
I'm a dialogue guy.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
I'm not a fucking like, I don't care about the details.

17:15.000 --> 17:21.000
He's like, you know, he's got a kitten or, or he's like, you know, he's like setting

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
fire to sonnets that he wrote to some areas.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
He's like, or he's like, he's doing something that does guidance.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
It's like, it violates.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
Just give me one second.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
Whatever, whatever he sees when he kicks down that door, it's, it's specifically the first

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
15 pages of the script.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
It was, it said that this is not, this is not how Hitler's work.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Right.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Like they don't have feelings.

17:44.000 --> 17:49.000
My question is, what set this, one of these infinite Hitlers, what, what set him off on

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
a different, more adorable?

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
This is that wooden ball that comes down the minority tube that's like, you know, oh,

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
I thought the trans, trans, trans, trans, trans cognitives.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
I thought they didn't, I thought they didn't make mistakes or whatever.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
I thought, I thought Hitlers didn't have pets.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
You know, I thought they loved, I thought they loved racism.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
And he says, I didn't, I don't know what you're talking about.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
I'm just, I'm just me.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
You know, you're one of a million possible Hitlers.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Yeah.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
And he's like, well, why is that a bad thing?

18:18.000 --> 18:24.000
And then, and the guy's like, like, he just hears like, I don't know if they had sirens

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
back then, but the, and then he just goes like, and then like shoots him with a silencer.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
But like, and you think he just killed him, but then it turns out he like put him in a

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
bag and he takes him to a field and he sets him free.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
It's not about that Hitler.

18:37.000 --> 18:42.000
It's about an industry running on, on infinite Hitlers and the idea of, you know, if there

18:42.000 --> 18:47.000
are infinite Hitlers, then, you know, it's the idea that we've run out of bad Hitlers.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
That's the thing.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
It's like the fucking still corporate greed.

18:50.000 --> 18:56.000
In a world of infinite timelines, they've taken oil out of all of the bad Hitlers.

18:56.000 --> 19:02.000
They've created a universe, a multiverse in which the only thing remaining are average Hitlers.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Right.

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
But, but, but the head of the oil company is saying, look, we can still get away with

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
even mining oil out of good Hitlers because they're still Hitlers.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
And there's somebody that works underneath that person.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
It's like, no, you're, we're now just dealing with regular people now, just regular good

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Hitlers.

19:19.000 --> 19:24.000
Is the, is the Hitler, is one of the good Hitlers, is Elijah Wood Hitler the protagonist of

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
this?

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
Or is the, the oil industry guy that sets those Hitlers free?

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
Elijah Wood as Hitler is the polar ice caps.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
You know, he's like, or, or oil, you know.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
It's like, it's like, it doesn't, he's like the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
Certainly part of the draw.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Definitely on the poster.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Is there a, is there a Jeff, not the protagonist.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
Is there a Jeff Goldblum character who steps in and says, I think what you're doing is

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
a unethical, uh, yes.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
All right.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
Moving on to, to, to, to, to, uh, another segment.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Actually, we could keep this up.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Well, okay.

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
Uh, awesome things I came up with, uh, uh, in a, in a different blackout drugs, uh,

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
that weren't at the TV guy party.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
That's the segment.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
You, you want some music for that?

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Yeah.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Yeah.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
Dan drinks a lot.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
So the stories aren't all he's got.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
It doesn't just wait till TV guides party to get slosh.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
He does it all the time.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
And he's always awesome.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
And he always comes up with things that he has to write down.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Okay.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
I was drinking with Dino.

20:27.000 --> 20:36.000
Dino was talking about, so, so Dino, um, assuming he has, he does not mind, uh, details about

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
his, I think if he were here, he would share any old secret.

20:40.000 --> 20:46.000
So he has, he has, he has a, he has a tattoo, like right above his wiener.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
Uh, somebody was asking about his tattoo.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
He has like a tattoo that's like a thing in Greek on his arm.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
Um, uh, but then, and then he said, somebody was asking him, is that the only tattoo you

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
have?

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
And he's like, well, I do have another one.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
It's above, it's above my, uh, my wiener.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
He said, it's in my bikini area.

21:05.000 --> 21:11.000
So that means it's like, unless he's shaving it all the time, it's like hidden by hairs,

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
right?

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Yeah.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
You're, you're, you're, well, yeah.

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
Is the art of the, is the art of the design worked into that?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
No, no, no.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
It's like a lurking tiger.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
I saw Dino in New York with his, I saw Dino, when Dino passed out in New York with his

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
pants down, I saw him, his, his pants were, he had a belt on and his pants were fastened

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
and zipped up, but it was still below his dick and balls.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
And he, he was wearing women's tights and fetish underwear.

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
It was cut out so I could see his dick and balls through, through mesh.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
I don't think he was wearing women's tights.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
I think it was just wearing a special underwear.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
No.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
I mean, there, there was, yeah, it was fetishy stuff.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
It was a lot of layers.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Yeah.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
It was a lot of layers.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
I mean, his pants weren't around his ankles.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
How would you know?

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
No, they were like below, like mid-thigh.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
All right.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
I saw no tattoo is what I'm saying.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
All right.

22:02.000 --> 22:08.000
So this is, this story's about me.

22:08.000 --> 22:16.000
The point of departure is that I have a friend who has a tattoo above his penis dick.

22:16.000 --> 22:22.000
I keep pausing before I say dick, but not because I think there's like an S and P department,

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
but because I just feel like, I don't know the word, if I keep saying the word dick,

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
because it's about a tattoo above a dick.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
I'm like, guys, I don't know.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
I was like somehow categorizing that as like, oh, what kind of podcast is this?

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
I don't know.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
I don't know what my, I don't know what my fucking deal is, but.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
The story, the story's about you, man.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
There's it.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
There's it.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
So I go, okay.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Oh boy.

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
Well, this, he's like, oh, he goes like, why is there a tattoo of your dick?

22:45.000 --> 22:50.000
Dominatrix put it there as a, as a form of domination.

22:50.000 --> 22:55.000
She, she, she was like, she was like, she was like, you know, putting it there to like humiliate me.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
I was like, oh boy.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Oh, what, what is it?

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
And he's like, it's an X.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
And I was like, well, that's what's on treasure.

23:03.000 --> 23:11.000
That's like, like, like what, like in the worst case scenario, it means 10 something.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
Like, it doesn't even, what do you, that's.

23:14.000 --> 23:23.000
Or you got something wrong on family feud or boldest strike, but you're right.

23:23.000 --> 23:28.000
That is the worst case scenario as you lost on family, but still kidding on family feud is a big deal.

23:28.000 --> 23:34.000
Anyways, did you just send me a text Spencer?

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Nah, man.

23:35.000 --> 23:40.000
Oh wait, I guess I probably did because I responded to Steve who is texting us.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Sorry.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
All right.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
So the shit I have to go through and all right.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
So he had this story, the story has a point.

23:49.000 --> 23:55.000
Again, as with the last story, it's about the great ideas that I have that how, and how, how good I am at what I do.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
So he goes like, it's an accident.

23:58.000 --> 24:04.000
So then it was like, we're going like, well, you know, Drew Hancock and Wade Randolph were there at the drawing room.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
And we're all like an X and X.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
And he's like, look, she's not, she's not a writer.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
She's a dominatrix.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
Like, okay, well, let's beat this tattoo.

24:13.000 --> 24:20.000
You know, like, what would you tattoo above someone's dick to like, like, and I, and I, we didn't brainstorm for a long time.

24:20.000 --> 24:26.000
Like I, the thing I'm proud of is that this was the first, this is it for me.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Right.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
I didn't bother your first pitch.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Yeah.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
I didn't like hit a bunch of areas and pick the best ones.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
I think this is it.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
I just picked.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
I was like, okay, well, what do you do?

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
And I went and I was like, okay, I got it.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
I got it.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Okay.

24:39.000 --> 24:45.000
So, so in, in, in, in, in, in 1938, there was this cartoon called Nancy.

24:45.000 --> 24:50.000
Uh, and it was like syndicated in like the 80s and stuff eventually went away.

24:50.000 --> 24:57.000
It was like a little, it's like a little, uh, should have pulled up like a, you know, it's like a, like, like, like the younger people probably won't remember.

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
Like people my age, like probably remember when Nancy and Marma Duke and all this shit were in the paper.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
Like one of these things was like, like she, it was kind of drawn in a Steamboat Willie style.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
It was like such an old cartoon.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
It was like originated in 1938.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Kind of had a black bob haircut.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
Yeah.

25:11.000 --> 25:17.000
Like on Wikipedia, it says, uh, she was a chubby, precocious eight year old.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
That was the gimmick.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
That's how young cartoons were.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Like that was, that was ironic.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
It was like, what if, what if, what if she was chubby and precocious?

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
It was like cut, cut to the guy making shoe.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
And he's like, fuck, I don't know.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
What if birds worked in an office?

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Fuck me.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
I don't know.

25:35.000 --> 25:40.000
I'd love to just draw chubby girls all day, uh, hanging out, uh, making mistakes,

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
learning about life.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
Uh, so Nancy was, Nancy was a chubby, precocious girl.

25:45.000 --> 25:50.000
Like with the kind of like, I think like oval kind of like almost a little orphan Annie,

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
but filled in eyes.

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
And, and the thing is like every time in that cartoon, every time she'd look at something,

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
there would be like a dotted line going for her eyes.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
So, so that's, that's why I need to use her.

26:01.000 --> 26:06.000
Cause I don't care about that cartoon, but it's, it was, but, but I also think it's really funny.

26:06.000 --> 26:12.000
It's really funny, the specifics of it says, so it's Nancy, like, like above his dick and

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
she's looking at the dotted line goes down to his dick.

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
And then there's a thought balloon above her head and it's a dollar sign with a line through it.

26:21.000 --> 26:36.000
And the caption is, uh, hey Dino, 1938 called your dicks worthless.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
I was just very proud of it.

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
So I wrote it down and it took me 40 minutes to explain it.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
I think, I think it holds up.

26:49.000 --> 26:54.000
Yeah. So does peak Hitler with speed.

26:54.000 --> 27:02.000
Well, speaking of peak Hitler, it takes less gasoline than is in one Hitler to go to an alternate timeline.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
Yes. Because well, here's the thing.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
Okay. So it's corporations.

27:12.000 --> 27:18.000
Okay. Well, my, my, my knee jerk answer to that.

27:18.000 --> 27:24.000
Is, uh, you know, have you seen scandalous?

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
I mean, come on. No, no.

27:26.000 --> 27:32.000
My knee jerk reaction is, uh, uh, is, is it's a corporation.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
They don't, they just want there to keep being oil.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
They don't care how much it costs.

27:39.000 --> 27:46.000
Well, they have, if, if Exxon has, has like the ability to, to, to time travel.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
They're just going to use it to sell you more oil.

27:49.000 --> 27:55.000
They're not going to come out with a car called the, the new Ford instantaneous.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
Now you don't have to really drive.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
You can just sit in a car with no wheels and blink to your office.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
They'd be like, then we're out of fucking money.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Yeah. Yeah.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
So they're, I don't know.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
And come on, I know, I know it has holes in it.

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
I, I, yeah, no, I mean, I'm thinking of all sorts of ways to solve that.

28:12.000 --> 28:18.000
I mean, how, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me answer your question with a question.

28:18.000 --> 28:27.000
So are you telling me that, that in the future, uh, uh, the, uh, fossil fuels, uh, uh, uh,

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
uh, driven industries have, have shrunk our polar ice caps to the point where there's

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
now more room to, to drill.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
And that's what they want to do.

28:35.000 --> 28:40.000
Like that's crazy too.

28:40.000 --> 28:47.000
That's crazy. Yeah.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
Hold it. Hold it for 30 more seconds then.

28:51.000 --> 29:09.000
29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17,

29:09.000 --> 29:31.000
23, 22, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, he hasn't even blinked, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

29:40.000 --> 29:48.000
When you hold your head real still, people are gone.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
Type flap, beep, beep.

29:51.000 --> 29:55.000
Um, I don't know.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
I think we, we might have made podcast history there.

29:58.000 --> 30:03.000
Uh, we certainly, we certainly, we certainly proved to all of my detractors right that

30:03.000 --> 30:10.000
this is definitely a, a, a, a show that succeeds more at a cult of personality than, than any

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
actual empirical measurable value.

30:14.000 --> 30:20.000
If, if you're just looking at a guy not doing, not blinking and, uh, that's not on you guys.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
That's on me.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
I should bring more to the table.

30:23.000 --> 30:32.000
Uh, uh, uh, well, I thought, I mean, I thought, wait, wait, I, I, I, what?

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
I'm just stretching.

30:35.000 --> 30:40.000
You just, you just do that cause you know what makes your tits look good.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
I need all the help I can get, man.

30:43.000 --> 30:47.000
Uh, that's why he's always also kneeling on a beach with his knees at a certain distance.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
And I was like, he knows that triangle thing.

30:49.000 --> 30:54.000
Um, wait, take me through that one.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
You're not familiar with that triangle thing?

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
I am not.

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
I don't know, there's, I'm talking about God guys, like, like, like the naked lady pictures,

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
they have like certain rules that are based on certain angles and stuff.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
And I, and I don't know what they are.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
I was, I was referencing that concept without knowing what they are.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
It doesn't matter.

31:11.000 --> 31:18.000
It's, um, which I did, I went, I want, I want, I just wanted to meet, meet, meet, like, uh,

31:18.000 --> 31:26.000
like, like, like, like, we should, like, like, like, give, give, give, give, give, give me

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
one second, James.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
I, I, I'm sorry.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
I, I, I, I, I, oh wait.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
I call.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Oh no.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
I shattered the, I looked through the glass and said, James.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
It's okay.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Okay.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
All right.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Now I really fucked this.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
I don't even know what you're talking about.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
I know that could have been James Cromwell.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
I don't know what, what, what.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
What, what if it were James Cromwell?

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
That'd be amazing.

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
I was getting tweeted at by somebody who is, is there, is there, is there anybody here

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
who, uh, who's, who's come a great distance tonight?

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Who is it?

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
New York.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Boston, Massachusetts.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
Burning Man.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
New York, Boston, Massachusetts.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
Burning Man.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
New Zealand.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
New Zealand?

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
Oh, Miami.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
New Zealand?

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
New Zealand.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
I mean, New Hampshire.

32:08.000 --> 32:13.000
That's like the New Zealand of the United States.

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
I don't think, I think we've had five people from New Zealand up here and never one person

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
from New York.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
Oh yeah.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
We're lousy with Kiwis on the stage.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
I love Kiwis.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
The thing I admire about New Hampshire guys is that the entire time, there was like,

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Hong Kong.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
New Hampshire.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
What?

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
Tunisia.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
New Hampshire.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
What city?

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Miami.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
New Hampshire.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
Who's New Hampshire?

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
What city in New Hampshire?

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
Manchester.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
Manchester.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Actually, is that very quaint and colonial?

32:37.000 --> 32:42.000
Like kind of gorgeous and like, like old, like very, I think I, I think I went through

32:42.000 --> 32:47.000
there and there was lots of like, like revolutionary war, war monuments and stuff like that.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
Am I making that up?

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
Uh, maybe a little.

32:49.000 --> 32:54.000
Just, just matches in, in like Vermont and, okay, so yeah.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
I've been to, I've been to Keen, New Hampshire.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
Is it near there?

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
No.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Two hours.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
Oh.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
All right.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
Fuck you.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
Is, is New Hampshire beautiful right now?

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Is it, was it fall foliage time out there?

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
Almost.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
Almost?

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Did you come here for, for work or for pleasure?

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
Uh, pleasure.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
New Hampshire pleasure guy.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
Come up on stage.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
New Hampshire pleasure guy.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
All right.

33:16.000 --> 33:23.000
What's your name, sir?

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
Pat.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Hello, Pat.

33:26.000 --> 33:31.000
What brings you all the way from New Hampshire to Los Angeles for your own pleasure?

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
What, what, what pleasure are you seeking here, Pat?

33:33.000 --> 33:38.000
Uh, it came to visit some friends, but mostly go to Disney with my girlfriend.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
Oh yeah?

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
Yeah.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Do you know there's a Disney a lot closer to New Hampshire than this one?

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
Like in Florida.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
Yeah, but we've been to that one way too much.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
Yeah.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
Have you ever worked Disney?

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
Disney World in Florida.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Oh, it's like closer because, okay.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Worcester, Massachusetts, Disney.

33:51.000 --> 33:56.000
I just think of the country as a square, so all the corners are the same distance.

33:56.000 --> 34:00.000
I'm like, oh, you might as well go to, but even that would be a little better.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
Even though squares work.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Yeah.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
Yeah.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Yeah.

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
Have you gone to Disneyland here yet?

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
Uh, yeah.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
Yeah.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
We've, we've, I found out a couple of days ago and somebody texted me and I was sad to know this.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
I love Disneyland that it was dapper day where everyone goes to.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
That's what we went for.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
Did you go?

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
I did not go.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Alec, right?

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Yeah.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Alec, our dapper bowtie wearing friend.

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
I had a bunch of friends go and I was so sad that I wasn't invited to go with them.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
I didn't know about it.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
I would have fucking gone.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Actually, no, I couldn't have gone because I was out of town, but I would have loved

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
to have been there.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
So everybody is all fancy pants.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
Everyone's dressed up.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
Oh yeah.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
Did anybody go?

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
You went?

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
Yeah.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
Wait, you guys went?

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
That's, that's my girlfriend.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
What's your name?

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
Hannah.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
Hannah, get up here.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
I'm shooting fast and loose.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Yeah, you are.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
I want to talk about dapper day.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
Okay.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
So you guys knew about dapper day.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Is that why you came from New Hampshire to LA?

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
Part of the reason why we came.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
Okay.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Now what goes on at dapper day?

34:57.000 --> 35:01.000
What are you, first off, what did you guys wear to dapper day at Disneyland?

35:01.000 --> 35:10.000
I just had like a blue, like watercolor-y flower dress with an insanely hot petticoat

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
underneath it.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
All right.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
Was it a thousand degrees?

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Yeah.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
It was way hot.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
It was way too hot to be dapper.

35:16.000 --> 35:21.000
For some reason, I decided to go all the way and curl my hair frontwards, which meant

35:21.000 --> 35:25.000
that it just fell in front of my face every time I tried to do something.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
And then-

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
You know who loves that?

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Cats.

35:29.000 --> 35:35.000
And the cat in every man.

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
Now Hannah and Pat, have you guys ever been to Disney World or Disneyland before?

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Yeah.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Like-

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
I don't know, how many times?

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Once a year since we started dating.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Once a year since you started-

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
How long have you been dating?

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Five and a half years.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
Yeah.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
Almost six.

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
So every year you come from New Hampshire to California-

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
To Florida.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
To Florida too.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
Okay.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
And this time you're coming to California.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Okay.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
So what's different about this year?

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Except you traveling that distance.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
Did you have an extra hard year at work?

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
And so you're like, all right, now I'm going to go to the real Disneyland.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
Yeah.

36:08.000 --> 36:13.000
Well, I work a crazy schedule and we just barely ever get to see each other.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
Can we ask what you do without prying?

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
After asking you to come up on stage?

36:19.000 --> 36:23.000
During the day I clean cars at a rental car company.

36:23.000 --> 36:27.000
And at night I am a PA for a news station.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Oh my God.

36:29.000 --> 36:37.000
Were you clean cars for the rental company of America's thirst for blood?

36:37.000 --> 36:43.000
Did you guys enjoy the original Magic Kingdom more or less than the later one in Florida?

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
I got to say the sequel's better.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
The sequel's better?

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
Oh yeah.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
It's a lot bigger.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
Yeah.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
A lot more stative.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
I've been to them both, but I'm partial to the Anaheim one because my mom worked there,

36:53.000 --> 36:59.000
I think in the 60s and my her daughters from her first marriage worked there in the 70s

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
and I worked there in the 90s.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
So I love Disneyland.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Well, I'm distracted by something though.

37:05.000 --> 37:14.000
I love Disney and I love Close, but you said you do this thing in the morning and then at night

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
you do this.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
How do you, when do you sleep?

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Never.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
Never?

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Never.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
And so these vacations are more important.

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
My life is a vacation and I work the whole time, but my job is a vacation.

37:28.000 --> 37:33.000
When I drop my rental car off, I'm like, oh, Hannah, what are you doing?

37:33.000 --> 37:38.000
I think about someone that turns out to be you and I go, oh man, like now I walk away

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
and I put, I didn't, my back hurts.

37:41.000 --> 37:45.000
I don't want to get that straw wrapper and it's like, and then you're like, well, I'm

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
going to do this for the fall day and then at night I'm going to go to that place.

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
So when you go to a place for vacation, it's incredibly important and probably to her as

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
well.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
You guys have been good five years.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
That's longer than I can.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Hannah, what are your work hours, Hannah?

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Do you work a lot too?

38:01.000 --> 38:08.000
Well, I work Monday through Friday at a life insurance company and then I work at a part-time

38:08.000 --> 38:15.000
job at Market Basket and then we have a four-year-old who, so that's okay.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Oh, you have a kid together?

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Mm-hmm.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
You guys are busy.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
Yeah.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
We're really busy.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
But you're not married, right?

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
No.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Okay, so you have a kid together four years.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
I did want to change that, maybe.

38:28.000 --> 38:34.000
So, in front of Mayor, Comptroller, and Harmonians.

38:34.000 --> 38:39.000
I can authorize this, by the way.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
I'm taking over the show.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
All right.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
I'll allow it.

38:44.000 --> 38:57.000
You're an amazing mother and you are an amazing girlfriend and will you marry me?

38:57.000 --> 39:05.000
Yes, go ahead.

39:05.000 --> 39:17.000
The funny, I guess it's not kind of funny.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
I think you're sitting on your mike.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
We were standing in line at Disney yesterday and she was telling me about how she had a

39:24.000 --> 39:28.380
that I had gotten in touch with you and I proposed to her at Harmontown.

39:28.380 --> 39:34.300
Well, maybe her dream was her phone glowing in the corner of the room because you tweeted

39:34.300 --> 39:35.300
me two weeks ago.

39:35.300 --> 39:39.500
I was like, this is a public, take this on the DL.

39:39.500 --> 39:44.140
Yeah, Hannah, not to make this about me, but did I pull that off?

39:44.140 --> 39:47.660
Were you fooled at all?

39:47.660 --> 39:50.020
Did that feel organic and then surprising?

39:50.020 --> 39:54.180
Well, I don't, I don't ever use Twitter.

39:54.180 --> 40:01.100
Oh, good, good, well, I blocked you anyway.

40:01.100 --> 40:07.780
I never even thought of that, yeah, perfect, just blocker.

40:07.780 --> 40:16.580
So, I was hoping that it was going to be at Disney and so all day today, no, no, no, no,

40:16.580 --> 40:19.860
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, wait.

40:19.860 --> 40:20.860
Wait, wait, wait.

40:20.860 --> 40:22.860
It's okay, you have the floor.

40:22.860 --> 40:23.860
No.

40:23.860 --> 40:24.860
Like no one's got.

40:24.860 --> 40:32.500
So then, a couple days before we left, I had this dream and I woke up and I was like,

40:32.500 --> 40:34.380
that's what Pat's going to do.

40:34.380 --> 40:38.060
I know him and this is, if he's going to do anything, it's going to be this.

40:38.060 --> 40:43.540
And then all day today, I'm pretty sure everybody else knew because I'm getting all these text

40:43.540 --> 40:46.780
messages like, so how's your vacation?

40:46.780 --> 40:50.020
Like what's going on?

40:50.020 --> 40:53.420
So you kind of thought maybe that was a chance when you came here tonight that was going

40:53.420 --> 40:54.420
to happen?

40:54.420 --> 40:56.980
I would be lying if I was saying I wasn't hoping.

40:56.980 --> 41:01.180
Oh, you saw it, I love it.

41:01.180 --> 41:05.100
I would be lying if I told you I wasn't crying right now.

41:05.100 --> 41:10.700
Oh, no, that's so cool, you guys are the cutest things in the universe, thank you.

41:10.700 --> 41:16.060
I think that, I mean, I know that it's enough for you guys that the mayor of Harmontown

41:16.060 --> 41:21.940
was present, but I also, why don't we make their, why don't we make their engagement

41:21.940 --> 41:25.540
even more official by going higher up on the governmental chain and bring out Senator Bernie

41:25.540 --> 41:26.540
Sanders.

41:26.540 --> 41:29.540
Bernie Sanders to make it official.

41:29.540 --> 41:32.540
Senator Permanente.

41:32.540 --> 41:35.540
Hello, sir.

41:35.540 --> 41:51.460
Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders, feel the burn everybody, feel the burn.

41:51.460 --> 42:03.540
Thank you, thank you, Americans, thank you, Dan Harmon, congratulations to the, you

42:03.540 --> 42:07.980
know, the thing, this is really, this is a New Hampshire, well look, this is not, this

42:07.980 --> 42:11.180
is going to be, this is one of the two greatest things that's going to happen in New Hampshire

42:11.180 --> 42:14.140
the next six months.

42:14.140 --> 42:23.780
Oh, Senator, your trademark humility is giving away to, oh, it's coming up Bernie.

42:23.780 --> 42:28.780
You have certainly since the day, first day you were on my show, I have certainly learned

42:28.780 --> 42:29.780
your name.

42:29.780 --> 42:30.780
That's right.

42:30.780 --> 42:37.740
Senator Sanders, we were off to a rocky start, but here we are, you know, you get used to

42:37.740 --> 42:42.380
it, you get comfortable, I'm not so rough to share a hot tub with, you know.

42:42.380 --> 42:45.420
I know that you're not, you're not the senator of New Hampshire, but you, because you're

42:45.420 --> 42:49.140
close to, the same brick state, Vermont, Vermont is a very close, there's a, there's a very

42:49.140 --> 42:52.660
long and contentious border.

42:52.660 --> 42:55.940
We have to make sure there's, you know, that there's a balance between the marijuana being

42:55.940 --> 43:00.460
smuggled one way and the hacky sacks being smuggled the other way.

43:00.460 --> 43:04.580
Do you feel that you can weigh in and have any jurisdiction over this new union or this

43:04.580 --> 43:05.580
new proposal here?

43:05.580 --> 43:07.340
Or is that going outside of your own jurisdiction?

43:07.340 --> 43:11.340
Well, look, I mean, you know, you know, as far as, you know, it would be a nice, you

43:11.340 --> 43:13.860
know, little thing, a button on the evening, but of course not.

43:13.860 --> 43:14.860
No, I don't.

43:14.860 --> 43:19.260
I'm the legislative branch, of course.

43:19.260 --> 43:24.060
I'm a former mayor of Burlington, Vermont, but there's no more justice to the peace

43:24.060 --> 43:25.060
powers related to it.

43:25.060 --> 43:26.900
I'm a United States senator.

43:26.900 --> 43:31.260
The most I could do is on your honeymoon, I could bring you, you know, a large report

43:31.260 --> 43:39.540
from the 9-Eleven commission and they could step out of it and say, I could share with

43:39.540 --> 43:44.180
you, I could share with you parts of the Trans-Pacific partnership if you wanted to read that, you

43:44.180 --> 43:48.620
know, before or after the festivities.

43:48.620 --> 43:53.740
But that won't in any way actually, uh, uh, uh, uh, matrimonize them anymore.

43:53.740 --> 44:00.900
No, but it would inform you as, you know, a newlywed couple about, you know, the, you

44:00.900 --> 44:04.400
know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the political sort of thing.

44:04.400 --> 44:05.400
Oh, okay.

44:05.400 --> 44:07.060
Do you have any thoughts about?

44:07.060 --> 44:08.060
You're married, right?

44:08.060 --> 44:09.060
I am.

44:09.060 --> 44:14.740
I am married, like, uh, my, my wife, I think, is named Jane.

44:14.740 --> 44:20.220
Well, if you're gonna think your wife's name is something that's a great guess.

44:20.220 --> 44:24.780
I think my wife is Jane and we're happily married for a long time.

44:24.780 --> 44:29.220
We just had a great weekend up, you know, for the holiday, we're up at Lake Champlain.

44:29.220 --> 44:32.140
We were just, you know, just up there to make a fish.

44:32.140 --> 44:38.860
Mr. Sanders, forgive my impudence, but you are such a guy that's into statistics, facts,

44:38.860 --> 44:42.340
numbers, the fact that you're uncertain about your own wife's name.

44:42.340 --> 44:44.660
Ninety percent of the time, yes, continue.

44:44.660 --> 44:50.060
Ninety... I would say 95 percent of the time, you know the statistics about things.

44:50.060 --> 44:51.060
I'm surprised to know.

44:51.060 --> 44:54.100
Well, that's, look, you're not looking at the inflation of just the statistics or the

44:54.100 --> 44:55.100
statistics.

44:55.100 --> 44:59.140
If you look at the statistics, when we started the campaign, it was about 95 percent, but

44:59.140 --> 45:03.660
the value of the dollar has gone up since then, so the statistics itself has decreased

45:03.660 --> 45:04.660
commit-sortly.

45:04.660 --> 45:08.340
I'm going to Google, while you're, you go on, I'm going to Google your wife's name and

45:08.340 --> 45:09.340
see what happens.

45:09.340 --> 45:10.340
Fair enough.

45:10.340 --> 45:15.980
Look, I would prefer, I would prefer if you searched with a non-major corporate search

45:15.980 --> 45:22.980
engine, besides Google, maybe try duck-duck-go, duck-duck-go, duck-duck-go, duck-duck-go,

45:22.980 --> 45:33.980
open source, look, get up, hop on a Linux and look it up with duck-duck-go.

45:33.980 --> 45:37.980
I didn't even hit Mr. Sanders.

45:37.980 --> 45:41.980
Her name is Jane, you are correct.

45:41.980 --> 45:46.860
Feel the burn, feel the burn.

45:46.860 --> 45:50.500
I just want to check in with our newly engaged couple and make sure, I don't know, I kind

45:50.500 --> 45:53.980
of, I thought, are you guys comfortable up here?

45:53.980 --> 45:57.300
Yeah, but I don't want to, like, be one of those people that overstays their welcome.

45:57.300 --> 45:58.300
No, no, no.

45:58.300 --> 46:00.260
I want to make something very important.

46:00.260 --> 46:04.140
You're not, you're a citizen of the state of New Hampshire, but you're also a working

46:04.140 --> 46:05.140
class American.

46:05.140 --> 46:08.980
Yeah, please let the guy, it's about time that people like you got a chance.

46:08.980 --> 46:09.980
Yeah.

46:09.980 --> 46:15.980
Thank you, if you don't mind, Dan, do you mind if I ask a couple of questions?

46:15.980 --> 46:18.980
Absolutely, that would make me feel better about keeping them up here.

46:18.980 --> 46:19.980
Sure.

46:19.980 --> 46:20.980
What was your name?

46:20.980 --> 46:21.980
Pat.

46:21.980 --> 46:22.980
Pat.

46:22.980 --> 46:23.980
Well, that sounded like a pattern.

46:23.980 --> 46:25.980
That doesn't happen at the same time.

46:25.980 --> 46:27.980
But it's patterned, Pat.

46:27.980 --> 46:28.980
Yes.

46:28.980 --> 46:29.980
Good.

46:29.980 --> 46:30.980
Okay, so what do you know?

46:30.980 --> 46:31.980
You're in New Hampshire, what do you know?

46:31.980 --> 46:32.980
Are you about to do a magic trick?

46:32.980 --> 46:33.980
Nope.

46:33.980 --> 46:36.980
It seems I have nothing up my sleeves.

46:36.980 --> 46:38.980
They're rolled up.

46:38.980 --> 46:42.980
Nope, except an emergency set of sleeves that can come down and be rolled up if I need

46:42.980 --> 46:43.980
to demonstrate.

46:43.980 --> 46:49.980
So, Hannah and Pat, what do you know?

46:49.980 --> 46:56.980
Sorry, you know, I do gargle milk duds before I go in front of an audience.

46:56.980 --> 46:59.980
That sounds comical to anyone.

46:59.980 --> 47:01.980
What is your profession?

47:01.980 --> 47:02.980
Do you have one?

47:02.980 --> 47:05.980
Crafts and services?

47:05.980 --> 47:08.780
I work at a call center for a life insurance company.

47:08.780 --> 47:09.780
That's fantastic.

47:09.780 --> 47:14.780
You work at a call center, that's one of the few industries that's still around in the

47:14.780 --> 47:15.780
country.

47:15.780 --> 47:16.780
And Pat, what do you do?

47:16.780 --> 47:17.780
I clean cars during the day.

47:17.780 --> 47:18.780
That's fine.

47:18.780 --> 47:19.780
I pee at night.

47:19.780 --> 47:20.780
Right.

47:20.780 --> 47:21.780
And you want it night?

47:21.780 --> 47:22.780
I'm a PA at a news station.

47:22.780 --> 47:23.780
Sure, yes, good.

47:23.780 --> 47:30.780
At a news station, you're involved in small local media, and you're also manual labor,

47:30.780 --> 47:36.780
contributing valuable services in both case, call center, labor, for an average couple.

47:36.780 --> 47:39.780
An average couple like you, newly wed in America.

47:39.780 --> 47:48.780
My tax plan would increase your take home pay by over 400% on top while at the same time

47:48.780 --> 47:52.780
rendering it such that your employers have to pay for your health care and have to pay

47:52.780 --> 47:53.780
something in tax.

47:53.780 --> 47:55.780
That's just, I think, that's normal insane.

47:55.780 --> 47:57.780
That's all I think.

47:57.780 --> 48:02.780
And not, look, nope, that wasn't, that wasn't there.

48:02.780 --> 48:06.780
Trust me, stay with me, the rhythm wasn't there.

48:06.780 --> 48:11.780
I know the cadence of a forced applause, and that wasn't it.

48:11.780 --> 48:18.780
If I want to force on a crowd to applaud, all I have to do is continue talking at the

48:18.780 --> 48:24.780
same volume and pointing, and eventually the people will be there to join me.

48:24.780 --> 48:26.780
Thank you.

48:26.780 --> 48:29.780
All right, well, what?

48:29.780 --> 48:32.780
He's so much more dynamic in person.

48:32.780 --> 48:39.780
I'm going to try to strike a balance between, I think our happy couple probably maybe wants

48:39.780 --> 48:43.780
to be out of the spotlight and just smile and hold hands and watch the rest of the show,

48:43.780 --> 48:44.780
right?

48:44.780 --> 48:48.780
I think Dan, maybe as mayor of Harmontown, since they chose to propose here, maybe they

48:48.780 --> 48:53.780
get up and can you do some sort of formal, like maybe we'll make up a new ritual where

48:53.780 --> 48:57.780
you kind of bind them in some sort of legally Harmontownian fashion?

48:57.780 --> 48:59.780
It'll be our big, fat, Harmontown engagement.

48:59.780 --> 49:00.780
Yeah, yeah.

49:00.780 --> 49:01.780
Look, you know what?

49:01.780 --> 49:02.780
I could do a thing.

49:02.780 --> 49:05.780
I could do a, you know, backup singing or something.

49:05.780 --> 49:06.780
Okay.

49:06.780 --> 49:07.780
Yeah, yeah.

49:07.780 --> 49:13.780
Okay, well, okay, well then, yeah, okay, so is there like a, is there like a slower,

49:13.780 --> 49:17.780
is there like, I could do like a slower, like, nuptial rap.

49:17.780 --> 49:19.780
And then we'll have Bernie Sanders.

49:19.780 --> 49:26.780
And then Bernie, you do the Vincent Price bridge, you know, like, you know, the spoken word.

49:26.780 --> 49:27.780
I'm very familiar.

49:27.780 --> 49:28.780
Sure.

49:28.780 --> 49:29.780
You're talking about thriller.

49:29.780 --> 49:30.780
Yes.

49:30.780 --> 49:31.780
Yeah.

49:31.780 --> 49:32.780
Yeah.

49:32.780 --> 49:33.780
All right.

49:33.780 --> 49:34.780
Yo.

49:34.780 --> 49:36.780
And this made it rhyme because it's going to be from, from the heart.

49:36.780 --> 49:37.780
The heart.

49:37.780 --> 49:38.780
From the brain.

49:38.780 --> 49:39.780
Yeah.

49:39.780 --> 49:40.780
Yo.

49:40.780 --> 49:45.780
Proposal, more important than marriage because it's the stage of marriage where marriage

49:45.780 --> 49:47.780
is still an option.

49:47.780 --> 49:56.780
800% of tax receipts year on year come from middle and working classes.

49:56.780 --> 49:58.780
And I think that has to change.

49:58.780 --> 49:59.780
Yeah.

49:59.780 --> 50:00.780
Yeah.

50:00.780 --> 50:01.780
Yeah.

50:01.780 --> 50:02.780
Yeah.

50:02.780 --> 50:05.780
One life becoming two, but not quite yet.

50:05.780 --> 50:08.780
For now, right now, you're happy.

50:08.780 --> 50:14.780
There's going to be a big ceremony.

50:14.780 --> 50:19.780
One of the two of you is going to, is going to feel like you're doing too much or too

50:19.780 --> 50:20.780
little.

50:20.780 --> 50:22.780
And there will be fights.

50:22.780 --> 50:29.780
In my belief, if the so-called greatest nation in the world cannot clothe and feed children

50:29.780 --> 50:34.780
and elderly, then it cannot call itself the greatest nation in the world until it makes

50:34.780 --> 50:36.780
those things happen in this country.

50:36.780 --> 50:42.780
But we live on a planet devoid of faith and everybody thinks that the eternity is a race

50:42.780 --> 50:44.780
and that you should be atheistic and cynical.

50:44.780 --> 50:51.780
And they don't know that you can win though by joining with someone else in the second

50:51.780 --> 50:52.780
half of life.

50:52.780 --> 50:57.780
I don't believe that monogamy is something that was not meant to be.

50:57.780 --> 51:03.780
I think that's something that was made up by parcheeks in Dubai.

51:03.780 --> 51:04.780
Why?

51:04.780 --> 51:09.780
I'm a racist guy.

51:09.780 --> 51:10.780
Pat and Hannah, everybody.

51:10.780 --> 51:11.780
Pat and Hannah.

51:11.780 --> 51:12.780
Thank you so much.

51:12.780 --> 51:13.780
Thank you very much.

51:13.780 --> 51:14.780
Thank you.

51:14.780 --> 51:15.780
Bless this union.

51:15.780 --> 51:16.780
Thank you.

51:16.780 --> 51:17.780
Thank you.

51:17.780 --> 51:32.780
May your happiness increase over 250% using real inflation-adjusted real dollars.

51:32.780 --> 51:33.780
Pat and Hannah.

51:33.780 --> 51:43.780
That's Harmontown's first wedding proposal on stage.

51:43.780 --> 51:47.780
Sanctified by the mayor and by the senator from Vermont.

51:47.780 --> 51:48.780
In front of the Vermont.

51:48.780 --> 51:53.780
Look, you know, when I was mayor of Burlington, Vermont, there were some wild times back there.

51:53.780 --> 51:57.780
I'm the first person to pronounce actually a marriage of four people who had just had

51:57.780 --> 51:59.780
a key party together.

51:59.780 --> 52:00.780
Oh.

52:00.780 --> 52:02.780
Those are simpler times.

52:02.780 --> 52:03.780
Yeah.

52:03.780 --> 52:06.780
I was direct tweeting with Pat before the show.

52:06.780 --> 52:08.780
And at one point he was like, I'm so fucking nervous.

52:08.780 --> 52:09.780
I don't tweet.

52:09.780 --> 52:10.780
Look, you should know this about me.

52:10.780 --> 52:13.780
Not only do I not tweet, I do not have an email server.

52:13.780 --> 52:17.780
So there's no way that there could be, you know, the Hillary thing.

52:17.780 --> 52:23.780
I have all of my communications printed out on a dot matrix printer and handed it to me

52:23.780 --> 52:27.780
in a nice hemp bound sort of ledger.

52:27.780 --> 52:32.780
I'd say in the beginning of the pilot for the new Battlestar Galactica, when, you know,

52:32.780 --> 52:36.780
the adama is like giving the tour and going like, it's all vacuum tubes and none of it

52:36.780 --> 52:39.780
took them to the internet because, you know, robots tried to murder us.

52:39.780 --> 52:40.780
No, that's true.

52:40.780 --> 52:42.780
I thought I had the program I actually saw.

52:42.780 --> 52:43.780
I had that.

52:43.780 --> 52:45.780
I watched it on VHS.

52:45.780 --> 52:50.780
I do all my binge washing on either VHS or if I could get it beta, but you can't always

52:50.780 --> 52:51.780
get it anymore.

52:51.780 --> 52:56.780
And I watch, I did watch a little Battlestar Galactica and I find it inspirational.

52:56.780 --> 53:00.780
If I'm elected president and there's not an immediate fascist coup d'etat that sort of

53:00.780 --> 53:03.780
takes me out of power.

53:03.780 --> 53:08.780
Senator Sanders, I promise you that I will retrofit the United States military along the

53:08.780 --> 53:17.780
lines of Battlestar Galactica so that it will, it will not be connected to any sort of internet

53:17.780 --> 53:22.780
and they will also be suspenseful who done it every time.

53:22.780 --> 53:23.780
First day in office.

53:23.780 --> 53:24.780
Shoot.

53:24.780 --> 53:27.780
Your first day in office if you're elected president of the United States.

53:27.780 --> 53:28.780
Thank you.

53:28.780 --> 53:29.780
What is the first?

53:29.780 --> 53:30.780
I'm sorry.

53:30.780 --> 53:31.780
I'm sorry.

53:31.780 --> 53:33.780
We should make it clear he doesn't have that authority.

53:33.780 --> 53:34.780
I don't know.

53:34.780 --> 53:35.780
It's a hypothetical.

53:35.780 --> 53:39.780
Oh, I think that everybody, look, I believe that everybody is like Alan Watts says, you

53:39.780 --> 53:43.780
know, a shining light that sort of gets to change the universe a little bit at a time.

53:43.780 --> 53:45.780
So if he says it, I'm halfway there.

53:45.780 --> 53:46.780
Okay.

53:46.780 --> 53:47.780
All right.

53:47.780 --> 53:51.780
Let's say your first day in office, what's the first piece of legislation you put into

53:51.780 --> 53:54.780
the first 24 hours behind?

53:54.780 --> 53:56.780
I think you're jumping the gun.

53:56.780 --> 54:02.780
If I may respectfully, Jeffrey, if I may respectfully disagree, I don't think the first 24 hours

54:02.780 --> 54:05.780
in office are going to be spent passing any legislation.

54:05.780 --> 54:12.780
I think it's going to be dedicated to a drum circle right in the Rose Garden.

54:12.780 --> 54:15.780
We're getting people from Venice Beach, from Miami Beach.

54:15.780 --> 54:18.780
We're getting all the best ready worldwide drum circle.

54:18.780 --> 54:21.780
They're going to be welcome and we're going to throw that far.

54:21.780 --> 54:22.780
I don't know.

54:22.780 --> 54:23.780
We'll see what to our palms get tired.

54:23.780 --> 54:24.780
Was there be hacky sacking?

54:24.780 --> 54:25.780
Well, any hacky sacks?

54:25.780 --> 54:26.780
There will be hacky sacks.

54:26.780 --> 54:31.780
Look, you will be able to toss anything around at a small velocity off of your ankles.

54:31.780 --> 54:37.780
Don't you think it's kind of, isn't it kind of weird from a strange cosmic objective standpoint

54:37.780 --> 54:41.780
that actually that is your demographic?

54:41.780 --> 54:48.620
That's how fucked up and weird our world is, is that the guy that looks the most like

54:48.620 --> 54:49.620
our dad.

54:49.620 --> 54:51.620
The guy that, the guy, hold on a second look.

54:51.620 --> 54:53.620
I hope you're going to say something like that.

54:53.620 --> 54:54.620
I need to respond.

54:54.620 --> 54:55.620
I don't look.

54:55.620 --> 54:57.620
I can't have an attack on my character like that.

54:57.620 --> 54:58.620
No, no.

54:58.620 --> 55:01.620
If you're going to say that, I need to cite as a reference, teach your children well,

55:01.620 --> 55:04.620
the Crosby Stills of National Young Song, that kind of dad, you know.

55:04.620 --> 55:05.620
No, yeah.

55:05.620 --> 55:06.620
I mean, I was like, I just, I do.

55:06.620 --> 55:08.620
The children well.

55:08.620 --> 55:16.620
The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the archetype of the, of the clip on tie rolled

55:16.620 --> 55:17.620
up sleeves.

55:17.620 --> 55:19.620
I look that that would be counterculture now.

55:19.620 --> 55:24.620
I look like I'm made from crystallized college professor essence.

55:24.620 --> 55:33.620
I look like I'm almost fueled by the mockery of children sitting in a college class taking

55:33.620 --> 55:34.620
notes.

55:34.620 --> 55:36.620
So I'm compassionate on the drawings.

55:36.620 --> 55:43.620
I'm well aware that I look like I'm running for president of the Muppet Show.

55:43.620 --> 55:48.620
But I want to make something very clear.

55:48.620 --> 55:51.620
I feel like I'm very York.

55:51.620 --> 55:53.620
Bernie, Bernie.

55:53.620 --> 55:54.620
Yep.

55:54.620 --> 55:55.620
Why not?

55:55.620 --> 55:57.620
Let's say, let's go again.

55:57.620 --> 55:59.620
Crossfire time.

55:59.620 --> 56:00.620
Okay.

56:00.620 --> 56:05.620
Let's say you, let's say you served two successful terms as president of the United States.

56:05.620 --> 56:06.620
That's fantastic.

56:06.620 --> 56:08.620
60, 70 years from now.

56:08.620 --> 56:16.620
Any statue that's made of me is going to be made of vegan macaroni, condensed in a war

56:16.620 --> 56:18.620
format using soil milk, soy milk.

56:18.620 --> 56:22.620
And there's something that is a sustainable kind of statue that might wear down in the

56:22.620 --> 56:25.620
rain after about 50 years, but it'll look nice.

56:25.620 --> 56:30.620
Now there's talk of putting a woman, I believe in the $10 bill.

56:30.620 --> 56:34.620
What, what, uh, denomination of currency would you like to see yourself on?

56:34.620 --> 56:38.620
Or if not you, who else would you like to see on money in your place?

56:38.620 --> 56:40.620
Like, look, that's, that's a fine question.

56:40.620 --> 56:43.620
I don't want my face on any currency.

56:43.620 --> 56:46.620
I actually believe that the Federal Reserve should be audited.

56:46.620 --> 56:49.620
I'm the only candidate saying that besides Rand Paul.

56:49.620 --> 56:52.620
And he has as much of a chance as a bucket of piss.

56:52.620 --> 56:57.620
I believe that the Federal Reserve should be audited.

56:57.620 --> 56:58.620
I think that's fair.

56:58.620 --> 57:03.620
And so I don't want my face on anything except social security checks that people receive.

57:03.620 --> 57:06.620
Social security and Medicare checks.

57:06.620 --> 57:08.620
I want to have a big, just a birdie face.

57:08.620 --> 57:09.620
That's like, there you are.

57:09.620 --> 57:10.620
You got it.

57:10.620 --> 57:12.620
Senator, Senator, I'm sorry.

57:12.620 --> 57:17.620
I know how you interpret this, but they're asking me from the control room if you'll

57:17.620 --> 57:19.620
sit closer to me so that we both fit.

57:19.620 --> 57:20.620
Was it about a stage picture?

57:20.620 --> 57:21.620
Who's complaining?

57:21.620 --> 57:22.620
Who's complaining?

57:22.620 --> 57:24.620
I think it's just corporate America.

57:24.620 --> 57:27.620
You're streaming this online somewhere?

57:27.620 --> 57:28.620
Yeah.

57:28.620 --> 57:29.620
And they're complaining.

57:29.620 --> 57:31.620
They're all there going, why isn't it better for me?

57:31.620 --> 57:35.620
How come I have to either look at Senator Sanders or Dan Harmon?

57:35.620 --> 57:37.620
How come I can't look at both of them?

57:37.620 --> 57:38.620
That's fair.

57:38.620 --> 57:39.620
That's fair.

57:39.620 --> 57:40.620
Look, why not?

57:40.620 --> 57:41.620
Do you want me to come down too?

57:41.620 --> 57:44.620
Or do you want to come down too?

57:44.620 --> 57:45.620
Or maybe we both move.

57:45.620 --> 57:49.620
Or do you want to do like a chess move where we like castle?

57:49.620 --> 57:53.620
Let this be my official endorsement of you as a presidential candidate.

57:53.620 --> 57:55.620
I'm going to come down to where you are.

57:55.620 --> 57:56.620
That's fantastic.

57:56.620 --> 57:58.620
And look, see, he moves too.

57:58.620 --> 58:00.620
And then like a rock, I just go around like this.

58:00.620 --> 58:02.620
Oh, no.

58:02.620 --> 58:04.620
Chess humor.

58:04.620 --> 58:05.620
Okay.

58:05.620 --> 58:06.620
All right.

58:06.620 --> 58:10.620
Well, I think this is what people are afraid will happen metaphorically if we do elect

58:10.620 --> 58:11.620
you.

58:11.620 --> 58:14.620
Everything will change and then everything will just be different for no reason.

58:14.620 --> 58:16.620
I am radically going to change everything.

58:16.620 --> 58:19.620
Starting with the podcast.

58:19.620 --> 58:21.620
But look, see, it's comfortable.

58:21.620 --> 58:22.620
Is this actually better?

58:22.620 --> 58:24.620
Whoever said, is this okay?

58:24.620 --> 58:28.620
Yes, see, this is a socialist solution and you were shocked at first.

58:28.620 --> 58:31.620
But then they got a thumbs up for the people of the both.

58:31.620 --> 58:32.620
It works.

58:32.620 --> 58:35.620
All we need is the cooperation from most of the people in the room.

58:35.620 --> 58:36.620
And that's fine.

58:36.620 --> 58:41.620
Why is everybody so upset about the socialism thing?

58:41.620 --> 58:43.620
Are you are you on Adderall right now?

58:43.620 --> 58:44.620
What's going on?

58:44.620 --> 58:50.620
I mean, I am on prescription Adderall that I got from Canada because it's easier to get

58:50.620 --> 58:55.620
drugs in Canada, which I don't think is fair for seniors.

58:55.620 --> 58:59.620
All right, we're not a lot of seniors in the room.

58:59.620 --> 59:01.620
Blah, blah, blah, Pearl Jam.

59:01.620 --> 59:05.620
Is that better?

59:05.620 --> 59:09.620
They love Pearl Jam.

59:09.620 --> 59:10.620
I'm racking up some endorsements.

59:10.620 --> 59:11.620
I know we're friends.

59:11.620 --> 59:15.620
I'm not going to push you or anything, but I am getting some endorsements.

59:15.620 --> 59:18.620
And they say Jell-O Biafra.

59:18.620 --> 59:19.620
That's not a joke.

59:19.620 --> 59:22.620
Jell-O Biafra at Dorspeak.

59:22.620 --> 59:25.620
The Red Hot Chili Peppers, all of them, I got all of them.

59:25.620 --> 59:28.620
They came into the office with the shirts off and everything.

59:28.620 --> 59:30.620
Do you really have Jell-O?

59:30.620 --> 59:32.620
Yup, Jell-O Biafra at Dorspeak.

59:32.620 --> 59:36.620
Also, Blind Mellon is the first endorsement from beyond the grave.

59:36.620 --> 59:40.620
I was endorsed by Blind Mellon.

59:40.620 --> 59:45.620
Speaking of that, so if you heard of this, is his name Paul Lessig?

59:45.620 --> 59:46.620
Is that the name of the guy?

59:46.620 --> 59:47.620
Somebody tweeted me about that.

59:47.620 --> 59:49.620
Yup, you know about Paul Lessig.

59:49.620 --> 59:53.620
Look, and I'm not going to, I don't want to get personal, but Paul Lessig is, you know, he's a,

59:53.620 --> 59:56.620
he's running a care that they say that's a protest currency.

59:56.620 --> 01:00:00.620
And all he wants to do is he wants to say, well, change the election laws and it'll resign.

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:01.620
What are those like?

01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:03.620
But I think he wants you as his vice-president.

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:05.620
Look, I'm sorry, pal.

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:07.620
That ain't going to happen.

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:10.620
All right, birds on top.

01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:17.620
I, I ain't taking second fiddle for nobody besides David Crosby, okay?

01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:21.620
Look, look, Lawrence Lessig is saying he's going to run for president.

01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:25.620
You know, if he's elected, he resigns after one day or whatever when he does his thing.

01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:30.620
I think if he gets it, he becomes a Robespierre, guillotine, don't do it.

01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:32.620
It has happened.

01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:33.620
I mean, what did we elect Napoleon?

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:35.620
And then he crowned himself.

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:38.620
I think we only, I think we only wanted him to defend the best deal.

01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:40.620
Actually, it's an afternoon.

01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:41.620
It's important to notice.

01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:44.620
We were like, yeah, and then you'll check out at five and he's like, ah, no problem.

01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:45.620
It's not going to blue.

01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:48.620
And we're like, all right, I'm going to go to bed then to defend that best deal.

01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:50.620
And then he's like, where are you?

01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:51.620
I hear cannons.

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:53.620
Somebody invented a whiff of grape shot.

01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:55.620
Look, that's not far off.

01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:56.620
That's not far off.

01:00:56.620 --> 01:01:02.620
I've actually studied the game Stratigo, which is sort of based on Napoleon.

01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:03.620
Yeah.

01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:05.620
And that's, look, I studied it in detail.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:11.620
I base all my stuff on the worst episodes of Sliders.

01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:16.620
All my history knowledge comes from CW Sci-Fi original.

01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:22.620
I vividly remember the CBS miniseries, Napoleon and Josephine starring Amon de Sante as Napoleon.

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:28.620
And I think when I engage, you know, the foreign policy on them, you know, out there, it's going to, you know,

01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:32.620
What do you think Napoleon and his generals had wrong at Waterloo?

01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:34.620
And what do you think the repercussions of that were for France?

01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:40.620
Well, I don't think, you know, I don't think they should have gone on the water, you know.

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:45.620
Cornwallis was out there, right, in boats.

01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:46.620
That's close.

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:47.620
With Churchill.

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:48.620
Yeah.

01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:50.620
That's like, he was triangulated.

01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:52.620
Between Cornwallis and Winston Churchill.

01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:53.620
Yeah.

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:56.620
Speak softly and travel in time.

01:01:56.620 --> 01:02:04.620
Was Winston Churchill's lesser known saying, which turned out to be the real reason he has all the famous quotes?

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:07.620
So to speak softly was from whom?

01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:11.620
Winston Churchill pretends that that FDR said that.

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:13.620
You mean Teddy Roosevelt?

01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:19.620
That's also another, depending on what timeline you're living in.

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:24.620
Winston Churchill, we're all, well, first of all, we're all light.

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:31.620
Fun fact, by the way, fun fact, I will be the first president since Teddy Roosevelt to wear glasses full time.

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:32.620
Oh.

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:33.620
Is that right?

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:38.620
Yep, I've led, look, part of the reason I'm running is for just little trivia things like that.

01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:42.620
Also, the second president sends him to have been at Abe Lincoln's inauguration.

01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:43.620
Come on, it's an old joke.

01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:44.620
That's fair.

01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:48.620
No, I was at his first inauguration, not the second one.

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:53.620
I didn't, I wasn't some supporter for that time.

01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:56.620
So, okay, all right, socialism.

01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:57.620
Yep, shirts.

01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:58.620
Sure.

01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:09.620
Ties, got it, sleeves, 9-11, it's 9-11 right now.

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:11.620
I can't control it sometimes.

01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:12.620
It just does this.

01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:14.620
You didn't orchestrate 9-11, did you?

01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:15.620
Nope.

01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:17.620
I did, nope, I certainly did not.

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:19.620
That was, you know, the other guys.

01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:20.620
I thought you were blessing us.

01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:22.620
I thought you were giving us like absolution.

01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:29.620
And all it does is raise your contribution to Social Security funds a little bit.

01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:31.620
That's how you use your Nassparatu powers.

01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:33.620
I'm lowering taxes in the app.

01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:36.620
Just to lower our taxes or raise them.

01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:40.620
I always went, yeah, I mean, like, how much, how much, you saw that documentary and said,

01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:44.620
we only need $75,000 a year to be happy, and then beyond that, we're already happy,

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:46.620
and it doesn't fucking matter.

01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:48.620
Rich people are happier than poor people.

01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:55.620
Look, I'm a little confused because I have watched every documentary on Netflix.

01:03:55.620 --> 01:04:01.620
Not only have I watched every documentary on Netflix, and I have them print it out.

01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:07.620
I don't believe in using email service, so I have Netflix programs print it out,

01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:11.620
and I have them fanned like a little cartoon book.

01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:16.620
And that's how I watch every program, and then I have staffers read the parts,

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:23.620
and they just, they read them, you know, like sitting around reading Shakespeare or something.

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:25.620
But you haven't seen the one I'm talking about?

01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:26.620
I don't look.

01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:29.620
I just go along with my information on the Netflix service.

01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:32.620
So what I do is I print it out, like you're watching, you know, Stainbow Willie,

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:35.620
like you were talking about earlier, a little cartoon thing.

01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:38.620
There's a kind of, obviously you would agree with this because you know,

01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:40.620
there's some kind of pop science kind of thing.

01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:45.620
It's, you know, there's been studies put into it and how scientifically studies be.

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:50.620
I think that there is a cap, an absolute cap, on the amount of like wealth

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:54.620
that actually does impact your emotional state.

01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:58.620
And that beyond a certain amount, and it's relative to, let's say,

01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:03.620
whatever year this study was done, and in American dollars,

01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:09.620
that it equivalates, is that a word, to a $75,000 a year salary.

01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:11.620
And then over that you're not going to be getting better.

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:12.620
You're not going to get happier.

01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:13.620
You're going to have more money.

01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:14.620
You're going to have a bidet.

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:15.620
You're going to, yeah.

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:17.620
Look, but you're not going to get happier.

01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:18.620
It is my belief.

01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:24.620
It is my firm belief that I'm not here to tell people how much money

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:25.620
they should make.

01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:26.620
I'm not a communist.

01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:27.620
I want to make that clear.

01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:28.620
I'm a socialist.

01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:32.620
I don't, it's not my job to go, you know, open up your checkbook

01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:33.620
and say, that's too much.

01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:36.620
You have not enough at all, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:38.620
That would be an amazing cereal commercial, though.

01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:41.620
Like, if you were like, I can't.

01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:44.620
I got those for the only cereal, and then you come in and go,

01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:46.620
hey, kids, you shouldn't have that much.

01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:47.620
You should have this much.

01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:49.620
Look, that's fine, but I won't take any money for the commercial.

01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:55.620
And also, the only cereal I endorse is cashing.

01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:59.620
But I do want to say, look, I think if there's an appropriate amount

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:03.620
of money that somebody should have, I don't think it begins with a B,

01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:04.620
as in billion.

01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:07.620
You know what I'm talking about?

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:10.620
And I think if you are making billions of dollars,

01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:12.620
I think that you should pay something in taxes.

01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:15.620
Your cheapskate, bastards.

01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:17.620
By the way, I want to point this out.

01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:19.620
I'm looking forward to the general election.

01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:23.620
I think that me versus Donald Trump is the best possible election

01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:26.620
you can have.

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:29.620
We're going to, look, if we do it, I want to have at least four debates,

01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:31.620
four debates in each region of the country,

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:37.620
and I also want to have a debate between just our hair

01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:40.620
as a tiebreaker.

01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:42.620
That would be amazing.

01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:44.620
By the way, he's from Queens.

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:45.620
You know that.

01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:46.620
I'm from Brooklyn.

01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:47.620
Oh, shit.

01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:53.620
It would be, look, it's like the Oklahoma and Texas of New York.

01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:55.620
That look, I do have a plan, by the way,

01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:57.620
mentioning Texas as a side note.

01:06:57.620 --> 01:07:00.620
I think for global warming, I think my solution is I want to

01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:05.620
turn Texas into a rainforest.

01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:09.620
Because all of those sad statistics and things talk,

01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:11.620
they always use Texas as a size scale.

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:13.620
Sure, they refer to what's a bigger size than Texas.

01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:15.620
Why not? Just go for it.

01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:17.620
We know how much we need.

01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:19.620
If you need Austin, we can have it cleared out,

01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:22.620
and the rest of it's just rain for us.

01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:26.620
But look, if we're having an election, a Queens, Brooklyn election,

01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:29.620
I'm calling this the G-Trade election.

01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:31.620
It's going to be, that's right.

01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:32.620
That's a New York bit.

01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:35.620
By coastal enough, look, I'm going there in a couple of weeks,

01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:38.620
I've got to prep for the material.

01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:42.620
It's going to be long, winding, hot, and too expensive,

01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:44.620
and it'll break down, but eventually, you know,

01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:48.620
you've got stuck in the middle of the East River.

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:51.620
Ah, the G-Train. Just like the G-Train.

01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:54.620
Yup, that's the best I could, what do you want, the PQA?

01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:56.620
I don't know.

01:07:56.620 --> 01:08:01.620
I still say Houston Street.

01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:04.620
Oh, you're lucky I'm not a fighter anymore.

01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:05.620
Wow.

01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:08.620
That's right, you were golden gloves when you were younger, right?

01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:12.620
Look, I used to do Muay Thai.

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:18.620
I played rugby, I was really vicious on the front, you know, scrum.

01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:21.620
Bare-knuckle, real, I'm just a brutal,

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:24.620
I even test the rules just how hard I would fight.

01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:27.620
Bite it, I bit a guy, we won.

01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:28.620
You bit a guy and won.

01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:33.620
This was back when I was at the University of Chicago.

01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:36.620
Why did that make you laugh?

01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:42.620
Because it's actually true, and I'm impressed with myself that I remember exactly where I went to college,

01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:45.620
because it was in the middle of the late 1960s,

01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:49.620
and I am lucky I remember any of it.

01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:53.620
There's a vague haze of LSD and Tom Haynes,

01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:55.620
that's all I can kind of remember.

01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:59.620
So, all right, well, look.

01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:01.620
Jeff has checked out, that's fine.

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:02.620
No, no, no.

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:06.620
Like, let's get this to eight-year-old level.

01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:10.620
Okay, so, like, because here's what's going to happen in the election.

01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:12.620
Productions, okay.

01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:14.620
Because I've been through this a thousand times already,

01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:16.620
that those numbers are inflated.

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:22.620
The number of years I voted are not 25% of the 90% of what I just said,

01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:23.620
but I feel like-

01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:24.620
How do you ever vote?

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:30.620
I voted every- there's only a couple elections where I was so fucking like just over it

01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:32.620
that I didn't vote and didn't talk to anybody about it.

01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:33.620
Sure.

01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:35.620
Those were- because as I've said on the show,

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:39.620
the real reason I vote is because I want to continue to have a political opinion,

01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:41.620
and we have an entrenched thing in this.

01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:47.620
You're not allowed to talk about breaking out of this the way that things work.

01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:50.620
People are voting for voting for voting for voting for voting.

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:54.620
They're voting for- they're voting for faith in the way the system has worked,

01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:57.620
which is a system that 87% of everybody doesn't believe in.

01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:00.620
You know, I sat down with Yoko Oro, and she said the same thing.

01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:03.620
Good. Well, that's-

01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:07.620
Dan, right now, if election day was tomorrow, who would you vote for?

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:08.620
Would you vote, and if so, who?

01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:14.620
I'm going to go- I'm going to vote for Bernie Sanders,

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:17.620
and I wish that everybody that voted just voted their conscience,

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:21.620
because I don't think- I think the problem, and I think this actually goes beyond like-

01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:23.620
I thought you had voted for-

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:25.620
Yeah, I did, I did.

01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:29.620
I feel like it goes beyond when you talk about America,

01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:33.620
because you could explain American politics in a really easy way,

01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:36.620
which is just like, you know, we keep talking about how broke we are and how in trouble we are,

01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:40.620
but until that really becomes a definable real thing,

01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:46.620
the fact is that we're still rich and we're still fine the way things are,

01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:51.620
and so we're going to continue to kind of do this thing the way we did it last time.

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:52.620
However-

01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:53.620
That's something we're going to look at.

01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:54.620
I do think it's-

01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:55.620
That's something we're going to look at.

01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:58.620
The idea that the country itself, you could vote for anybody you want to,

01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:01.620
just vote- if you want to vote for the Queen of England, go for it.

01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:06.620
I want the country to be more like a Tumblr post that you see late at night,

01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:10.620
where there's some sort of pyramid floating on a planet,

01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:14.620
and there's just sort of ancient wisdom that's guiding us.

01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:16.620
That's what I want to work towards.

01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:17.620
Bernie-

01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:18.620
Let's say you weren't running.

01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:20.620
Who would you vote for if you weren't a candidate?

01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:23.620
If I wasn't running for president, who would I vote for?

01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:24.620
Yeah.

01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:28.620
Well, look, I would probably vote for Stevie Dicks.

01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:30.620
I think it's time for a woman president.

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.620
That's who I would vote for.

01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:34.620
But do you think she's tough enough on immigration?

01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:41.620
Look, I think I've seen her kick people out of our house when we used to party at the Bangor Canyon.

01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:46.620
And believe me, believe me, she knows how to elegantly get somebody out of the foyer

01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:50.620
where they've had a little bit too much of the mirror.

01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:54.620
Thank you, that's good for people.

01:11:54.620 --> 01:12:00.620
I predict a landslide.

01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:06.620
Anyways, I had to, I fucking had to, it was like a fucking, you had to like,

01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:11.620
it's like an LA story when she has to like do the rest of shaving a haircut on her tuba.

01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:14.620
It's like fucking dumbass fucking pun.

01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:17.620
The landslide, it was a Fleetwood Max song.

01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:18.620
But wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:21.620
I just want to, not because I think it's important or it's going to benefit them,

01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:23.620
but because it's in my fucking head and I have some problem.

01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:25.620
There must be some like, like, like, like,

01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:26.620
It's fair.

01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:27.620
I want people like this to have a forum.

01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:33.620
Go ahead, go on.

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:36.620
There must be like some, like, there's, I bet there's somebody in the audience that's like,

01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:37.620
like, studying this or not.

01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:39.620
I've read a book about this or something like that.

01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:42.620
It must be some, some, there's this, this thing,

01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:46.620
every time we have our elections every year, there's this principle that keeps coming into,

01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:53.620
into, into the fore where people, they, they, the idea of voting.

01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:57.620
Sure, casting a ballot, elections.

01:12:57.620 --> 01:13:03.620
No, I, no, I look, look, we're rolled up our sleeves, we're having a little policy, walk out, let's go for it.

01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:09.620
They don't want to vote just to express as a natural part of the process.

01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:13.620
They don't want to just be a part of, of a total tally.

01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:19.620
And then we think of it like, we, we all want to vote for the winner.

01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:24.620
We don't want to be part of the problem by voting for the wrong person.

01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:27.620
And when we have third party candidates, it becomes a huge problem because not only do you,

01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:29.620
people not wanting to vote for the wrong person.

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:31.620
Third party candidate, go ahead.

01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:35.620
But like, I think you're like an eighth party candidate.

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:36.620
The, the, the.

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:37.620
I have been in the past.

01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:43.620
Yes, I read for the peace and freedom party and I actually split to the peace and freedom party.

01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:48.620
Oh my God, see, I was on the freedom side of the peace people we didn't get a look with.

01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:52.620
And I think I've ranted about, remember when Nader was, was, was, was running and there was like this thing,

01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:54.620
it was like that, that big election.

01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:58.620
It was like, oh, the culture wars are at their peak because we had no fucking real problems yet at all.

01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:03.620
So at all, anybody wanted to talk about how fucking important it was whether this guy or that guy got elected.

01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:06.620
And it was like so fucking important to everybody.

01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:08.620
I'm not saying like, I think what was that Gore versus Vader?

01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:12.620
What was the, it was Gore versus Palpatine.

01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:18.620
But it was like, so, so, so I do understand it was important for so many, so, so many small reasons.

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:26.620
By the way, I want to say just really quickly, the political message of the second of the latest trilogy of the Star Wars movies is a little thick.

01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:28.620
It's laid on a little thick, but I think it is accurate.

01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:31.620
I think the Bush administration is a lot like the Emperor.

01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:41.620
Those people, those journalists who were like reporting from the Ralph Nader campaign headquarters where this is a guy who knew he was going to lose.

01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:43.620
It was important for him to run.

01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:45.620
It was important to the people that were supporting him.

01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:48.620
It was running. I mean, I know Ralph, I know Ralph.

01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:50.620
He was, look, he was, he thought he was going to win.

01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:52.620
Yeah, he bought the balloons.

01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:56.620
End of story.

01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:59.620
There was a lot of balloons and they couldn't release them up.

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:01.620
They had to get rid of them.

01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:05.620
There's nothing sadder than getting rid of a bunch of balloons the quiet way.

01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:08.620
Mr. Sanders, how early does a candidate have to buy those balloons?

01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:11.620
You have to buy them, you can't buy them like two days before.

01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:14.620
Legally, according to the Federal Election Commission,

01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:22.620
the FCFEC, yes, there's a certain, you have to have, you have to report every balloon you receive as a donation.

01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:29.620
And also whether it was helium or regular air or some other sort of gas that might be poisonous in a rare case.

01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:35.620
Or if a water balloon, you have to of course go to the Department of Interior because we're in the midst of an epic drought.

01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:40.620
Which I am trying to help solve by the volume of sweat that's coming out.

01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:45.620
When I'm in California, I deliberately perspire more.

01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:47.620
Thank you.

01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:50.620
In order to help refill Lake Powell.

01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:54.620
That is saltwater though, we have like a whole ocean of that.

01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:57.620
Trust me, trust me, this is just like Salt Lake, baby.

01:15:57.620 --> 01:16:02.620
But the guy on the floor at the, the journalists like, like, like, well, the campaign's going on.

01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:07.620
So they got like, so we're, because everyone was watching, everybody that wanted either Bush or Gore,

01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:11.620
whoever the fuck was running against who, Mothra and Gamera, they were running against each other.

01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:16.620
And everyone was on the edge of their seats because it was a fucking barn burner, that's not the right metaphor.

01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:21.620
It was a hair splitter, it was a fucking turtle fucker.

01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:30.620
Their turtle vaginas are like, they're bifurcated with a very thin membrane.

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:32.620
It was a candle burner.

01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:37.620
And male turtles have a two pronged, like it's like a tuning fork.

01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:40.620
And I'll get, I'll put a pin in that.

01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:45.620
But they got, I think it's time that we hear from the female turtles, frankly, but go ahead.

01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:47.620
Well, that's, that's the news from Florida.

01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:49.620
We got the numbers up here.

01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:53.620
We got Will I Am and it has a hologram and he's coming in and all that stuff.

01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:54.620
And let's go.

01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:56.620
And everyone was like, like, it was like, this is fucking crazy.

01:16:56.620 --> 01:17:05.620
I guess this is before like, like, like it was, it was like weird that journalism was dead, but it was like, they were like, it was fucking crazy to me because they were like,

01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:07.620
that's when my spirit really fucking died.

01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:16.620
I didn't vote for Ralph Nader, but watching the coverage, I was like, they were like, well, we now, so that's, that's the news from that fucking neck and neck race.

01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:23.620
And well, you keep hearing his name and he is, of course, the reason why this is neck and neck.

01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:32.620
We now go to Nancy Johnson, who's over at Ralph Nader headquarters, head shake, head shake, head shake, Nancy.

01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:38.620
And, and there was like, and she cuts it and Nancy's like, um, yeah, uh, yeah, they're thrilled down here.

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:50.620
Um, uh, uh, because all the unspoken thing that everyone was saying was like, if you voted for Nader, you're voting for, for Bush, you're voting because he's splitting the vote.

01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:54.620
I was like, this isn't, this is insane. This isn't, that's not democracy.

01:17:54.620 --> 01:18:02.620
Right. The idea of focusing on the outcome and then backing into your behavior as an end user. That's our fucking disease.

01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:11.620
I firmly believe that we should have a Scandinavian style system in a lot of ways, not only the way we tax corporations, but also elections.

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:15.620
Multiple parties. I want to have a WikiLeaks party.

01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:22.620
Where you bring Assange back. One of those crazy pirate parties they have up in Sweden and all that stuff.

01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:27.620
I want, I want to make sure that we have a fantastic array of different choices.

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:35.620
You have like a nice buffet. If you want to vote for like, like a nice little fishy, eggy breakfast thing, you can go ahead and vote for it.

01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:41.620
Fantastic breakfast in Scandinavia, by the way, too. Go with me. You'll find out. Trust me.

01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:48.620
But also, I think, you know, just have a little democratic system like that. If you want to have, you know, play fun and games, you do a little girl who let it, drag a tattoo thing.

01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:55.620
You know, you can still keep that up for all the guys who want to do the bad stuff. We can have a little tag, drag a tattoo game for you.

01:18:55.620 --> 01:19:00.620
Yeah. I mean, it's democracy. Parliamentary system.

01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:04.620
Hold on a second. There's a parliamentary system. Yeah, that's a good, who is that?

01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:05.620
That's John Parliament.

01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:09.620
That's my policy. That's my policy advisor. He come.

01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:10.620
Thank you. Good.

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:11.620
Yeah.

01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:19.620
Oh, what about the idea that, yeah, whenever we talk about the system being broken and how it's not a true democracy, then there's people who say, well, it's supposed to be a republic.

01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:23.620
What do those people mean? Do they mean they want it to be a republic, or do they mean that it works better as a republic?

01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:29.620
Those are people, those are people, those are the same people that say whom when you say who.

01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:37.620
Those are the same assholes that go, what, well, you can't even understand what's with the preposition. That's how people talk, motherfuckers.

01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:47.620
A republic means for the people. Democracy means the rule of the power of the people. It's close enough. Forget it. What are you?

01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:54.620
What am I? What am I? What am I? What am I? What am I supposed to read the back of an old-timey dollar bill or something?

01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:59.620
What are you, a broadsheet from the days of, what am I? What am I? Martin Van Buren?

01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:03.620
I do look a lot like Martin Van Buren.

01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:11.620
Spencer, if you could pick a governmental system from anywhere throughout history, what do you think would be the most just and the most simple?

01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:16.620
Like currently, or like when we have now, or something at any part of history?

01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:21.620
Oh man, let me tell you something. Let me tell you something about fiefdoms.

01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:24.620
They really, you know, they really...

01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:26.620
You want to bring the fiefdom back?

01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:31.620
They really did it. They made it happen. You know, you had castles, you had knights and shit, there was serfs.

01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:34.620
It's all the things you want out of society.

01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:38.620
Unless you're a serf. Actually, they're probably pretty happy.

01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:45.620
It is attractive when you do open up that Lego knight's set and you got the little guy with a rounded sword.

01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:46.620
Yeah, there's dragons.

01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:48.620
It's not going to hurt anybody. It's a rounded sword.

01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:57.620
But look, something gets out of order. You lose a Lego here or there. It's ugly, then suddenly wham, braveheart, or worse, you know, like...

01:20:57.620 --> 01:21:05.620
I'm trying to remember my 10th grade history, so it's like Holy Roman Empire, and like, does that break into feudal Europe?

01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:08.620
You know what they say about the Holy Roman Empire, right?

01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:13.620
Neither Holy, nor Roman, nor interesting in any way.

01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:17.620
I think after the fall of Rome, it went into the Dark Ages for a while, didn't it?

01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:18.620
That's one of the things that...

01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:19.620
Well, there was...

01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:25.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I have no... I shamelessly say I don't fucking know,

01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:29.620
but I also, like, I guess it would be weird to make people listen to all of us not know.

01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:33.620
Well, no, I don't know. Hold on a second, and I don't yield my time just yet.

01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:44.620
If the senator would yield, I just think that of 30 seconds here, I think there is a danger that the analogy has been made before that we are repeating, you know, the mistakes of the Roman Empire.

01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:46.620
I'm not the first to say something like that.

01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:48.620
Oh, because all roads are leading somewhere.

01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:53.620
Sure, all roads, or whatever, the back of a horse, you know, you got the email with multiple colors, you get it?

01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:57.620
Your mother, your dad sends you an email, that's what I'm talking about.

01:21:57.620 --> 01:21:58.620
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome.

01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:02.620
But we're an empire that's in its decline in the same way that the Roman Empire declined.

01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:14.620
And look, so my solution, if we are truly facing a Dark Ages, is to make sure that we have enough solar-powered stationary bicycles to at least have a little bit of light during those Dark Ages.

01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:16.620
Yeah, yeah, we should stack up and...

01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:18.620
We should plan for it, you know?

01:22:18.620 --> 01:22:19.620
We should plan for the Dark Ages.

01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:23.620
Plan, look, just look, have some candles in the drawer.

01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:29.620
Make sure you got extra batteries or whatever, just, you know, be safe.

01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:31.620
Alright, is Dimarch here?

01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:32.620
Yeah.

01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:35.620
Oh, he made a stand.

01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:38.620
You know, we always expect him to be here and he's like, what if I wasn't?

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.620
He said, because Arsenal lost again.

01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:41.620
Oh.

01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:45.620
That's just...

01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:46.620
They soccer in particular.

01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:47.620
They did?

01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:48.620
That's too bad.

01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:49.620
Yeah.

01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:53.620
Well, I think you're going to have to stay up here and play Shadowrun with us, Senator Sanders.

01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:55.620
Hold on a second.

01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:56.620
Hold on a second.

01:22:56.620 --> 01:22:59.620
I need to, hold on, let me consult with my campaign manager.

01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:00.620
I know we had another event.

01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:05.620
I was scheduled to go be interrupted by protesters who I agree with completely.

01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:07.620
Let me see real quick.

01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:08.620
Hold on a second.

01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:09.620
Can we just ask if there's...

01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:10.620
Strange.

01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:12.620
It's the...

01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:13.620
I'm available.

01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:14.620
I'm available.

01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:15.620
I'm good.

01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:20.620
This is all more airtime than I've gotten in the last three months on CNN.

01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:25.620
All right now, Bernie Sanders, have you ever played a fantasy role-playing game before?

01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:26.620
Sure.

01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:27.620
Yes.

01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:28.620
I mean this...

01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:29.620
Yes, I have.

01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:31.620
I've never had the Dungeon Master.

01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:33.620
I didn't like the, you know...

01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:35.620
I didn't like the idea of a Dungeon...

01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:37.620
A hierarchical Dungeon Master.

01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:41.620
That sounds too much like corporate power to me.

01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:42.620
But let me put it this way.

01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:47.620
I have played Meeples that I became very attached to.

01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:48.620
Meeples.

01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:49.620
Some was a compare to whatever you want.

01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:51.620
I played, look, here or there.

01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:58.620
What character, if you had to choose a mythological character to portray in a fantasy realm, what kind of character would it be?

01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:00.620
Look, I think that I would be...

01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:11.620
Look, I don't want to say a troll, but I don't want to say that I would obstruct certain areas with powerful feudal lords.

01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:20.620
We're trying to cross a bridge or something, and I would say, hey, stop, but it would be more like you've got to look at the statistics and I would make sure they pay the fare.

01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:23.620
I'd stop like a magical, you can't cross...

01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:30.620
The game that we're playing is actually set in the future, so it's more of a kind of a dystopian, kind of, you know, like 1984 Raven of the World kind of thing.

01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:31.620
Got it.

01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:32.620
I'm Chewbacca.

01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:33.620
All right.

01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:34.620
Okay.

01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:39.620
Imagine Star Wars where instead of moaning every 10 seconds, it's...

01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:43.620
Well, give me some Star Wars.

01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:45.620
Chewie, hand me the Hydro Spanner.

01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:53.620
1% or 5% of the top hydro spans are controlled by the Imperial Council, and I don't think that's fair.

01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:55.620
That is what I'm calling...

01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:57.620
Punch it, Chewie.

01:24:57.620 --> 01:24:58.620
Punch it.

01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:00.620
Punch it, Chewie.

01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:02.620
We're ahead of New Hampshire, we're ahead of Iowa.

01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:04.620
Let's see how far we can take it.

01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:17.620
Somebody in this audience will take a scene from Star Wars and subtitle Chewie's growls with Bernie Sanders.

01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:21.620
That will be funny.

01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:23.620
Laugh it up, first of all.

01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:31.620
I believe that every American who works deserves a paycheck and a chance and a fair shot of the American Dream.

01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:34.620
It was a too long look.

01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:41.620
If we do ADR, you come in and I wait for the beep, beep, beep, and I time it out so I can match the actual picture.

01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:47.620
Bernie Sanders, how about at the end of the first Star Wars episode 4, the first one, when they're all getting their awards.

01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:48.620
The real one.

01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:55.620
The awards ceremony at the end of it and the music is playing and they all get up there and Han gets his medal and they cut to Chewie.

01:25:55.620 --> 01:26:02.620
I think it was a different song playing.

01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:04.620
But they cut to Chewie and Chewie.

01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:18.620
Is this Chewie?

01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:20.620
It's just Bernie Sanders.

01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:22.620
He loves the Star Wars theme.

01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:26.620
It's caught not a big dog without all of you Rebel Alliance.

01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:30.620
It took a revolution and here it is.

01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:31.620
Thank you.

01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:33.620
That's all I want.

01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:35.620
Just get me into the Death Star.

01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:45.620
Is it too no pun intended, Pat, of me, to say why not just since we need a mercy on Donald and we don't have Aaron or DeMorge.

01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:48.620
We don't want to just bring up our happy couple and have them play.

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:51.620
Pat and Hannah, do you want to join us for some chatter-run?

01:26:51.620 --> 01:26:55.620
Pat and Hannah, return to the stage.

01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:57.620
You guys have to sit on either.

01:26:57.620 --> 01:27:00.620
You have to bookend me and the senator.

01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:07.620
Because that's part of the challenge of your new life together is that you have to be autonomous as well.

01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:14.620
It's called interdependence as opposed to co-dependence.

01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:20.620
Pat and Hannah, do you live in Los Angeles?

01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:21.620
No, New Hampshire.

01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:24.620
You're going to call that home?

01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:26.620
You're going to stay in New Hampshire?

01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:34.620
Until I get a full-time job at the news station and then work there for a year or two and kind of look around the country.

01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:35.620
See where it takes you?

01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:36.620
Yeah.

01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:37.620
That's cool.

01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:40.620
What is your forte at the news?

01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:44.620
What are your local budgetary issues?

01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:50.620
Local interest, budgetary, financial, fiscal, all of those things.

01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:53.620
Photoshoery, sports related angles.

01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:57.620
I'm training to be a director.

01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:58.620
A news director.

01:27:58.620 --> 01:27:59.620
Fair enough? Fair enough?

01:27:59.620 --> 01:28:02.620
Not glam up behind the camera. Good, working.

01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:03.620
Did you like Nightcrawler?

01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:05.620
I fucking loved Nightcrawler.

01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:06.620
Wait a minute. Hold on a second.

01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:08.620
All those documents, hold on.

01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:10.620
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:13.620
Oh, nice. Oh, good.

01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:19.620
I thought that was such a fun character for Gyllenhaal, I really like that.

01:28:19.620 --> 01:28:25.620
I kept falling asleep during Nightcrawler and I kept watching it over and over again to try to get to the end,

01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:29.620
because I'm like, oh, the movie's kind of a, you know, whatever, but I really like that character.

01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:30.620
He's a great character.

01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:36.620
I just like that when the guy goes like, I'm not going to hire a thief and he goes like,

01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:44.620
fair enough, and you're like, oh my God, he's a fucking murderer or whatever, it's great, I love that.

01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:50.620
You know the little anecdote, I have a little fun anecdote, like a little Peter Rabbit tale now and then,

01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:59.620
I was on an airplane and I was trying to watch the Tom Cruise movie with the robot, with, you know, the robots like it was.

01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:03.620
I realized there's a lot of them, but just tomorrow, that one.

01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:04.620
Mine was a bit.

01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:10.620
And they kept coming, they kept coming on with, you know, the announcements, interrupting the picture,

01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:17.620
that you lose where you were in the movie, and I was trying to rewind and just tomorrow to go, hey, let me watch where I left off from,

01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:23.620
and it's impossible to rewind to the same place where you were watching it from, because the whole movie is rewind to get shit.

01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:24.620
Right, right.

01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:29.620
If I am elected president, I will burn that movie in every copy of it.

01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:35.620
Or at least make them do it again with an honest linear plot.

01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:41.620
Or at least just rewrite it, or just make an edit of it so that every time Tom Cruise wakes up in that pile of luggage,

01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:44.620
he looks at the camera and goes, four times.

01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:52.620
That would help me, some numbers, just like, you know, an x-axis and a y-axis, just put it out there.

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:56.620
Euclidean geometry, what's wrong with that? Where did we go so wrong?

01:29:56.620 --> 01:29:59.620
Do you like Euclidean geometry, Hannah?

01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:02.620
Obviously.

01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:04.620
I mean, it's proven.

01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:06.620
Very good, very good.

01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:10.620
I'm on fire with the fucking dumbass puns tonight.

01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:15.620
I've turned into the grandpa I never had.

01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:19.620
Tell me about it.

01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:21.620
How old are you, Mr. Sanders?

01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:27.620
That's confidential national security, it's actually state security information of the state of Vermont.

01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:31.620
It's one of the few secrets that we have in the Vermont Secret Service.

01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:33.620
Let's just see how old I am.

01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:40.620
Yeah, let's just say, 90% of the time you've been on this earth, 10% of the people that are still alive have seen 5% of the people die.

01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:43.620
Right, let's put it this way.

01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:48.620
When we look at how we're depleting the resources on the planet and we're wondering,

01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:55.620
hey, maybe the resources will last a little longer, trust me, they won't, I go back to the Perbian.

01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:58.620
Well, that's too far, crustaceous, whatever you want.

01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:01.620
Crustaceous, the crustaceous.

01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:06.620
Because you're saying you were around when oil was still dinosaurs and that didn't last.

01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:09.620
Or, you know, the pink Hitler or whatever that was.

01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:13.620
Whatever that was, it was Citizen fucking Kane is what it was.

01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:17.620
I'll joke all about a lot of shit, but that was my fucking idea and it was great.

01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:20.620
It's not far off from the way things are.

01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:23.620
This guy, I'm going to answer that question you had.

01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:25.620
There's good answers, certainly.

01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:26.620
You're a good answer.

01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:28.620
Thanks, man, that's very nice.

01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:30.620
All commercial statements tonight.

01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:34.620
Spencer, are you ready to recap the last Shadowrun we played?

01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:37.620
I'm ready for any number of eventualities.

01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:41.620
Do we have a guest Shadowrun Sumerizer?

01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:43.620
Yeah, Jason Clymer.

01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:45.620
Jason Clymer?

01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:47.620
Probably Clymer.

01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:48.620
All right, let's find out.

01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:49.620
Are you ready to rock?

01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:52.620
I don't think we will find out.

01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:56.620
Are we voting?

01:31:56.620 --> 01:31:58.620
I abstain.

01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:00.620
The senator from the vote who stands.

01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:02.620
His first question was, are we voting?

01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:04.620
His second was, I abstain.

01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:07.620
I would like to filibuster.

01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:10.620
I would like to filibuster the vote.

01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:14.620
I do not think it's responsible to hold the vote on an issue.

01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:18.620
No, I like this.

01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:24.620
Because also contractually, we can't play anything with too much medieval stuff in it,

01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:26.620
and we also can't do it for more than 10 minutes,

01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:28.620
technically, according to our contracts,

01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:31.620
during render services, render of services on our...

01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:32.620
I think we'll find that.

01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:34.620
I think we'll find that if you...

01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:37.620
19 minutes from now, we will have played four minutes of gameplay.

01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:40.620
I'm pretty sure the people that are worried about that will...

01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:44.620
Oh, but also contractually, which I think is a great fucking idea,

01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:46.620
I am supposed to say,

01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:49.620
Harmon Quest, coming soon to CISO.

01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:52.620
It's going to be a new thing, and we'll be plucking it in.

01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:54.620
We've had six tapings so far, right?

01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:55.620
They've all been...

01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:57.620
Has anybody gone to the Harmon Quest tapings?

01:32:57.620 --> 01:32:58.620
You guys have been there?

01:32:58.620 --> 01:33:00.620
You should come to Monday or Tuesday.

01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:02.620
We still have empty seats.

01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:05.620
It would be great if we rang in the...

01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:08.620
I was going to say New Year, but it's not really that.

01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:11.620
Thank you for the invitation, but I'm not sure if I can...

01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:15.620
Right, no, it'll look like a paola?

01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:17.620
I don't care what it looks like,

01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:19.620
because as long as I'm always giving the money back,

01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:21.620
I'm never really having much.

01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:23.620
Yeah, you know, I'm supposed to say...

01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:24.620
I don't know when this contract kicks in.

01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:26.620
Well, I signed it, but I don't know if it's like...

01:33:26.620 --> 01:33:31.620
Yeah, but, okay, watch Harmon Quest on CISO.

01:33:31.620 --> 01:33:33.620
You see it, so...

01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:34.620
You like it.

01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:35.620
You like it.

01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:38.620
Coming soon, it's going to be like a...

01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:40.620
Like in the spring, maybe?

01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:41.620
Probably come in the spring.

01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:44.620
Everything else does.

01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:46.620
Don't clap for that.

01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:50.620
30, 29, 28, 27...

01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:59.620
27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20...

01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:01.620
I should have started at 10.

01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:21.620
70, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:26.620
0, negative 1, negative 2.

01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:27.620
Yeah.

01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:29.620
The square rule is negative 4.

01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:31.620
That's going to...

01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:34.620
Out of all the jokes we should never call back, like...

01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:38.620
The 30-second countdown to no pay off?

01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:43.620
Out of the Wikipedia entry for the podcast about recurring bits,

01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:44.620
and it's like all the shows.

01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:45.620
Like, why is that recurring?

01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:48.620
And then one of them is the 30-second stare.

01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:52.620
Oh, yeah, that show needed that.

01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:54.620
By the way, did you start your own Wikipedia page?

01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:55.620
Did you?

01:34:55.620 --> 01:34:56.620
I don't know.

01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:58.620
I don't know either.

01:34:58.620 --> 01:34:59.620
Wait, wait.

01:34:59.620 --> 01:35:00.620
Do you mean as a human being?

01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:01.620
Sure, yeah.

01:35:01.620 --> 01:35:02.620
I just thought you're old page.

01:35:02.620 --> 01:35:03.620
Like a Dan Harmon Wikipedia page?

01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:04.620
Yeah.

01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:05.620
No, but I did...

01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:06.620
There was one that had like a little bit...

01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:08.620
And this is way back in the day.

01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:10.620
Like, I did add to it.

01:35:10.620 --> 01:35:11.620
I did like put like...

01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:13.620
Well, also he kind of, you know, did this and that.

01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:14.620
Because they get things wrong.

01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:15.620
You got to go where you go now.

01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:16.620
Well, they leave stuff out.

01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:18.620
I don't know how I know who I am.

01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:19.620
I thought you were born in Vermont.

01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:20.620
You're born in Brooklyn, you dumbass.

01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:22.620
But that was like in the early days of Wikipedia,

01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:24.620
and I hadn't done that much.

01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:27.620
And I learned my lesson hard because I didn't even know.

01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:29.620
I was like, oh, anyone can do this?

01:35:29.620 --> 01:35:32.620
He's also brazenly witty and...

01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:36.620
And then I found out there was like this tribunal of people

01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:37.620
that goes like...

01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:39.620
I found the thing where they're just like,

01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:41.620
I think he wrote this.

01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:42.620
I don't think...

01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:43.620
I don't care who wrote it.

01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:44.620
He doesn't...

01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:47.620
He seems to be someone who mostly knows noteworthy people,

01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:49.620
more than is noteworthy.

01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:51.620
I concur with Zaxxon.

01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:56.620
This man should be sent to the Phantom Zone.

01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:58.620
You're not wrong.

01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:01.620
I think Jimmy Wales has too much power and authority,

01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:03.620
and I promise to break up Wikipedia

01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:05.620
and run it like a public utility.

01:36:05.620 --> 01:36:08.620
Oh, no.

01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:10.620
Spencer, are you ready to go?

01:36:10.620 --> 01:36:11.620
Yeah, yeah.

01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:12.620
I mean, you're...

01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:14.620
You're gonna be a criminal for six minutes,

01:36:14.620 --> 01:36:15.620
but go ahead.

01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:16.620
Are you really contract now?

01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:17.620
They're not gonna...

01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:19.620
We're not gonna play over the end.

01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:21.620
There's all kinds of shit we can say in court.

01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:22.620
If it's a shit, it's a fan.

01:36:22.620 --> 01:36:24.620
What, it's just a patrol thing?

01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:27.620
See, you start playing with corporations.

01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:28.620
This is what happens.

01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:29.620
I know.

01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:30.620
But no, we're fine.

01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:31.620
We're fine.

01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:32.620
I'm good.

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:33.620
I'm clean.

01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:34.620
I just meant...

01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:36.620
I don't get briefcases of anything besides ice cream

01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:38.620
from pen and cherries.

01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:39.620
You get it.

01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:42.620
I pay for it.

01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:44.620
Should we drag our feet a little more then?

01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:45.620
No, no.

01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:46.620
But I do say...

01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:47.620
I don't want to say...

01:36:47.620 --> 01:36:50.620
But I am, like, so amused by the idea...

01:36:50.620 --> 01:36:51.620
So someone in our country...

01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:53.620
...of a court case where we end up in court,

01:36:53.620 --> 01:36:54.620
and there's like...

01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:57.620
Our attorney, like, has to prove to the jury that...

01:36:57.620 --> 01:37:00.620
I was like, well, but how many minutes during a game

01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:01.620
are you actually playing?

01:37:01.620 --> 01:37:02.620
And they have to...

01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:05.620
And it's like, oh my god, this is the Scopes Monkey Trial

01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:06.620
of role-playing games.

01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:08.620
It's like, like, America is like turning in and going,

01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:09.620
yeah, wait a minute.

01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:12.620
Like, these guys suck.

01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:15.620
So now by law, we're only allowed ten minutes of Shadowrun

01:37:15.620 --> 01:37:16.620
during the show?

01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:17.620
I mean, we never played that much anyway.

01:37:17.620 --> 01:37:18.620
It's not...

01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:19.620
Can we just stop playing Shadowrun?

01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:21.620
Well, if I shouldn't be here,

01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:23.620
the best thing I need is some dirt for Hillary to pick up.

01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:25.620
She's looking for something.

01:37:25.620 --> 01:37:27.620
And I'm squeaky clean.

01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:29.620
If there's just gonna wreck it, I'm gonna get out of here.

01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:30.620
It's not by law.

01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:31.620
It's by contract.

01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:33.620
Contractual agreement with our collaborators.

01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:34.620
Oh, fuck it.

01:37:34.620 --> 01:37:35.620
But is it actually?

01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:36.620
Because it just...

01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:38.620
You earlier said you were joking.

01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:39.620
What are you...

01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:40.620
Joking about what?

01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:41.620
About the contract.

01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:42.620
With the contractual obligations.

01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:43.620
Wait, when you guys talk at the same time,

01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:45.620
I hear Tim Pom Pom now.

01:37:45.620 --> 01:37:46.620
Ugh.

01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:47.620
What?

01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:48.620
I mean, you're just joking, right?

01:37:48.620 --> 01:37:49.620
No.

01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:51.620
It's not contractual obligations.

01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:52.620
No.

01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:54.620
There is an agreement in the contract that we're not gonna...

01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:58.620
Basically, the headline of it is that we're not gonna do shit on the podcast

01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:03.620
that's gonna compete with what we're trying to get people to tune into

01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:04.620
for Harmon Quest.

01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:05.620
Jesus Christ.

01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:08.620
Which you and I know you're having your first reaction to

01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:11.620
what will be a lifetime of fucking ridiculous contracts.

01:38:11.620 --> 01:38:12.620
Well, I mean, no.

01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:13.620
I'll just kill myself.

01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:15.620
These are almost the good guys.

01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:19.620
They just want everybody to see the show and be happy.

01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:22.620
Is there any way you could claim force majeure?

01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:23.620
Yeah.

01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:26.620
But you were almost forced to by an act of God

01:38:26.620 --> 01:38:28.620
or some sort of non-gender dating?

01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:32.620
Spencer, can you give Bernie Sanders a spell called force majeure?

01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:34.620
Can he cast force majeure on this?

01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:35.620
I think, yeah.

01:38:35.620 --> 01:38:36.620
Yeah.

01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:37.620
Force majeure.

01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:38.620
You had to.

01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:41.620
You had to play the game with the shadow of the thing

01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:44.620
and there was no way because it was just...

01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:46.620
Oops, these landed in our laps.

01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:48.620
We had to play.

01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:50.620
I think I said something and then I said that.

01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:51.620
I was joking.

01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:54.620
The thing that is not a joke is that when it was in the 11th hour,

01:38:54.620 --> 01:38:59.620
I was like, okay, 10 minutes, not D&D,

01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:03.620
meaning not the milieu of...

01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:05.620
So we couldn't play, for instance,

01:39:05.620 --> 01:39:08.620
Stratigo for 20 minutes, either?

01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:10.620
I would love to do that.

01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:12.620
Move the nine forward.

01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:14.620
It's a nine. They're both God.

01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:15.620
Move the nine forward.

01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:16.620
It's a seven.

01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:18.620
Oops, just a nine is forward.

01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:21.620
We could play Stratigo.

01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:22.620
Oh, okay.

01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:24.620
Because there's muskets in it, right?

01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:25.620
Yup.

01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:28.620
There's one spy, there's a marshal and a general,

01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:30.620
and they all have the same feather hats.

01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:31.620
They kind of look like my hair.

01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:34.620
The most important thing is that it's during...

01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:36.620
Our service is rendered for the show that we're doing.

01:39:36.620 --> 01:39:39.620
It's during the time that we wouldn't want to do anything.

01:39:39.620 --> 01:39:43.620
And also, we've never played more than three minutes of show.

01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:46.620
Well, I mean, yeah, but we've never had our hands tied.

01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:48.620
I know, I know, I know. It's weird.

01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:50.620
It's weird to feel that on your wrists.

01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:51.620
Yeah, believe me, I know.

01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:53.620
You know what? I used to think like this,

01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:55.620
that I found socialism.

01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:58.620
Fuck the corporation.

01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:00.620
What's the worst they could do?

01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:01.620
I think this could be a good thing.

01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:03.620
Lean back, take, you know, just lean back,

01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:05.620
take a nice pill or something.

01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:09.620
I said we test the waters and play 11 minutes.

01:40:09.620 --> 01:40:10.620
Yeah, just to see what the...

01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:11.620
Well, I think it could be...

01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:13.620
Also, aren't you going to now fucking taste that 10 minutes?

01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:15.620
Like, all 50 shades of gray?

01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:17.620
Well, I think that argument could have been made

01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:20.620
for all the other times we've tasted 10 minutes of shadow run.

01:40:20.620 --> 01:40:23.620
No, you're talking from a logical place,

01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:24.620
and I'm talking from a sexy place.

01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:25.620
That's all I...

01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:27.620
So, like, all of that energy that you're spending

01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:29.620
logically analyzing the idea of a contract

01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:31.620
forbidding you from doing what you want

01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:33.620
is actually a form of you expressing,

01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:36.620
yeah, I want to play shadow run.

01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:37.620
And if you...

01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:38.620
If we had that for 10 minutes...

01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:39.620
Oh...

01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:41.620
I mean, I have that every...

01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:42.620
No, you have that.

01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:43.620
You have that.

01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:44.620
Yeah.

01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:45.620
Now we have that.

01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:46.620
Do you?

01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:47.620
Watch me, baby.

01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:48.620
Okay.

01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:49.620
949.

01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:50.620
We're going to start...

01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:53.620
Is there a compelling reason that a United States

01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:55.620
senator sitting currently serving

01:40:55.620 --> 01:40:57.620
should be involved in these deliberations?

01:40:57.620 --> 01:41:00.620
I say we use what we're about to do right now

01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:01.620
as a plug for our CSOW thing.

01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:03.620
This is, like, if you like what we're doing here,

01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:05.620
you're going to see an awesome, better version

01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:06.620
animated on CSOW.

01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:09.620
This is the bullshit, like, fuck-around time

01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:12.620
as opposed to the high-quality, high-budget

01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:14.620
thing that we're doing for CSOW.

01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:15.620
Yeah, like I said, force-major.

01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:16.620
Exactly.

01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:17.620
I don't think anyone disagrees with that.

01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:20.620
You guys know that when contracts go back and forth,

01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:25.620
it's literally two people, one from each side,

01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:29.620
who have absolutely no familiarity with anything

01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:30.620
that any of us do.

01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:32.620
Speaking of no familiarity with anything,

01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:34.620
let's play Shadowrun Poorly!

01:41:41.620 --> 01:41:42.620
All right.

01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:44.620
Again, by Jason Clymer.

01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:47.620
Last town on Harmon Run.

01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:51.620
The gang taking an unusual heist of antique MP3s

01:41:51.620 --> 01:41:54.620
decided that the easiest way to open a musical lock

01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:58.620
was to visit a conservatory run by creepy children.

01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:01.620
Achieving perfect pitch, the gang did a lot

01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:04.620
of back-and-forthing due to Nightblade's alcoholism

01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:07.620
and Eve's rampant banana-na-na-na-na-ing

01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:10.620
and then arrived at a public storage facility

01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:13.620
which had a deviant receptionist.

01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:15.620
Despite Mercy's distraction,

01:42:15.620 --> 01:42:17.620
Eve was caught crawling under the counter

01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:20.620
so the crew killed the curious Creighton.

01:42:20.620 --> 01:42:23.620
Hortegaard and Dr. Fren fought about the morality

01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:26.620
while the Norwegian dwarf tried to ascertain

01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:28.620
the locations of the sought songs.

01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:30.620
As an afterthought, they remembered Hackeye,

01:42:30.620 --> 01:42:33.620
who probably could have bypassed both the musicians

01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:34.620
and the murder.

01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:38.620
Will the gang successfully pull off a clean Shadowrun?

01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:41.620
Is there no limit to the number of murderers Hackeye

01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:42.620
can cover up?

01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:45.620
What kind of post-apocalyptic music academy

01:42:45.620 --> 01:42:47.620
doesn't charge tuition?

01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:52.620
Find out on this week's Harmon Run Shadow Town Time Town Time.

01:42:52.620 --> 01:43:00.620
Thank you.

01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:02.620
Just an answer to that person's question,

01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:04.620
there is a limit on the number of murderers I can cover up.

01:43:04.620 --> 01:43:06.620
It has to be within 10 minutes.

01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:09.620
It can't be done by a sword or a spell.

01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:11.620
You're not Hackeye.

01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:14.620
All right, Hackeye, do you have me on your car right now?

01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:16.620
Yeah.

01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:17.620
Can you find out?

01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:19.620
I mean, look, we might have broken more eggs

01:43:19.620 --> 01:43:21.620
than we needed to make this omelette.

01:43:21.620 --> 01:43:24.620
Can you find out where the MP3 storage unit is?

01:43:24.620 --> 01:43:26.620
No, no, I cannot.

01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:28.620
There's no records of that sort of thing.

01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:30.620
People just kind of walk in, store their things

01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:33.620
and leave without any, you know, documents or anything.

01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:36.620
They don't store it at the front desk here?

01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:39.620
That guy wouldn't know what's being stored where?

01:43:39.620 --> 01:43:41.620
No, that would be a huge breach of privacy,

01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:44.620
which is the whole point of these locations.

01:43:44.620 --> 01:43:45.620
Right.

01:43:45.620 --> 01:43:48.620
How many storage units are there in this facility?

01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:49.620
Oh, man.

01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:51.620
Let me look this up.

01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:54.620
250.

01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:57.620
Does that mean that it's designated a very important

01:43:57.620 --> 01:44:02.620
infrastructural area according to federal guidelines?

01:44:02.620 --> 01:44:04.620
Yeah, yeah.

01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:06.620
In accordance with the federal guidelines.

01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:10.620
Hackeye, it's a gymnate plate talking

01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:14.620
without the usual Bruce Willis patois.

01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:19.620
The people that use this service,

01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:22.620
they also sometimes use it electronically, right?

01:44:22.620 --> 01:44:24.620
They're storing things physically,

01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:27.620
but they're also logging in, logging out maybe sometimes.

01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:33.620
Does this company have, you know, like Caldwell Banker does,

01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:37.620
just a fucking website where you have an account?

01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:39.620
No, no.

01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:42.620
They have accounts with people who are giving them money,

01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:45.620
but that's really all they have in terms of records.

01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:47.620
Are they independently audited?

01:44:47.620 --> 01:44:48.620
No.

01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:51.620
By an outside agency besides their old internal,

01:44:51.620 --> 01:44:52.620
okay, that's not...

01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:54.620
Hackeye, you're answering my question.

01:44:54.620 --> 01:44:56.620
They have accounts of people that are giving them money.

01:44:56.620 --> 01:44:58.620
I'm not asking if they have, like, lists of the contents

01:44:58.620 --> 01:44:59.620
of the storage units.

01:44:59.620 --> 01:45:00.620
Well, there you go, yep.

01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:02.620
So they have an accounting system.

01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:05.620
They have a database full of people's names

01:45:05.620 --> 01:45:08.620
that give them money in exchange for their services.

01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:09.620
Yeah, yeah.

01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:12.620
Okay, so maybe there's something to go with there, right?

01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:13.620
Am I right?

01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:15.620
I'm just an assassin.

01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:17.620
You guys figure it out.

01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:21.620
I mean, is there a way to use that musical technology we have

01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:25.620
to maybe walk by all the things and sing to the MP3 locks

01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:26.620
or something like that?

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:27.620
Or is that crazy?

01:45:27.620 --> 01:45:29.620
You're the worst shadow runner.

01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:31.620
I don't know.

01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:33.620
I'm just spitballing here.

01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:34.620
All right.

01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:35.620
Well, I guess that's what I'm doing.

01:45:35.620 --> 01:45:37.620
Can I absolutely project through from room to room

01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:39.620
and kind of tell them?

01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:41.620
Would I be able to see if I was right?

01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:43.620
If I could actually project through the rooms,

01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:45.620
would I know if I saw them?

01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:46.620
No, you wouldn't.

01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:48.620
When you're in astral form, you wouldn't really be able

01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:51.620
to tell just physical, non-living objects.

01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:55.620
They just all kind of look like grave blobs and shadows.

01:45:55.620 --> 01:46:00.620
Can I suggest Professor Plub in the conservatory

01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:02.620
with the lob clock?

01:46:02.620 --> 01:46:04.620
No, Senator, no.

01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:05.620
I'm lost.

01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:07.620
What's your character, Senator?

01:46:07.620 --> 01:46:08.620
Well, what's my character?

01:46:08.620 --> 01:46:09.620
Shadowrun.

01:46:09.620 --> 01:46:10.620
No, no, no.

01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:12.620
It's just the first word you saw when you...

01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:13.620
What's the...

01:46:13.620 --> 01:46:14.620
Okay.

01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:16.620
Number nine, he moves forward and he hits an eight.

01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:17.620
I think he's horticard.

01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:18.620
All right.

01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:20.620
Oh, Senator, you actually are like a character

01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:21.620
that has the power to...

01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:24.620
I mean, does horticard have any powers

01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:25.620
that could facilitate us here?

01:46:25.620 --> 01:46:29.620
Like, I guess along the lines of astral projection,

01:46:29.620 --> 01:46:30.620
he's always doing random shit.

01:46:30.620 --> 01:46:31.620
Yeah.

01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:32.620
Like, gives him amnesians.

01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:35.620
Does he have the power to rally a popular mass movement

01:46:35.620 --> 01:46:39.620
of people that could break down the power structures

01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:41.620
that have been ruling up until now?

01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:43.620
Yeah, definitely has that power.

01:46:43.620 --> 01:46:44.620
There you go.

01:46:44.620 --> 01:46:45.620
Good.

01:46:45.620 --> 01:46:46.620
That sounds right.

01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:48.620
Okay, so...

01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:49.620
What I would...

01:46:49.620 --> 01:46:50.620
Go to jail.

01:46:50.620 --> 01:46:51.620
Go directly to jail.

01:46:51.620 --> 01:46:53.620
What I would be looking at if I were a cop,

01:46:53.620 --> 01:46:55.620
and I used to be backstory,

01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:59.620
is I would be looking at a timeline.

01:46:59.620 --> 01:47:01.620
I would be looking at whatever you do know

01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:02.620
and then...

01:47:02.620 --> 01:47:05.620
And then, like, well...

01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:06.620
Oh, he's back in character now.

01:47:06.620 --> 01:47:07.620
It's going to be good now.

01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:09.620
Are we able to pinpoint a time

01:47:09.620 --> 01:47:12.620
when somebody would have been storing a bunch of MP3s,

01:47:12.620 --> 01:47:14.620
as opposed to when, you know,

01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:18.620
can we isolate, like, a forensically identifiable activity

01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:21.620
that would be able to be seen on the computer?

01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:23.620
I was like, oh, I started my account,

01:47:23.620 --> 01:47:26.620
and then I dumped a bunch of shit in the storage unit,

01:47:26.620 --> 01:47:27.620
and then I...

01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:30.620
And it's like, whose account hasn't been active since Genesis?

01:47:30.620 --> 01:47:32.620
You mean, like, if they wanted that illustration

01:47:32.620 --> 01:47:34.620
or a computer screen?

01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:37.620
So we'll get graphic data for that.

01:47:37.620 --> 01:47:39.620
I was just...

01:47:39.620 --> 01:47:42.620
Excel, maybe? An animation at Excel?

01:47:42.620 --> 01:47:44.620
I have a lower IQ than...

01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:46.620
But usually, when I was a cop,

01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:48.620
we would just, like, we would go, like,

01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:49.620
okay, there's a dead person.

01:47:49.620 --> 01:47:50.620
When did they die?

01:47:50.620 --> 01:47:52.620
And then there were certain people

01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:55.620
who, because they were at work when that person died,

01:47:55.620 --> 01:47:56.620
they didn't do it.

01:47:56.620 --> 01:47:58.620
And then other people, like...

01:47:58.620 --> 01:48:00.620
They wouldn't say where they were,

01:48:00.620 --> 01:48:01.620
so they might have done it.

01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:04.620
And then we just put the black guy in jail.

01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:09.620
I believe that you should have to answer for that,

01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:11.620
and wear body cameras, but yes.

01:48:15.620 --> 01:48:16.620
I...

01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:18.620
Was there a question there?

01:48:20.620 --> 01:48:22.620
That was a textbook fellow buster.

01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:24.620
It wasn't for you.

01:48:24.620 --> 01:48:26.620
It was for my fellow shadow runners.

01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:28.620
I was going, like, I don't know,

01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:30.620
is there a way we can figure out,

01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:31.620
can we use the...

01:48:31.620 --> 01:48:32.620
Yeah, we will take it out.

01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:34.620
Because Hackeye has access to whatever,

01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:36.620
like, their accounting system, say,

01:48:36.620 --> 01:48:38.620
can you turn that into, like, actually deducing any...

01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:39.620
Eliminating anything.

01:48:39.620 --> 01:48:40.620
Okay, remember in...

01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:42.620
Okay, this is Dan Harmon talking.

01:48:42.620 --> 01:48:45.620
Remember in the fugitive movie with Harrison Ford,

01:48:45.620 --> 01:48:48.620
how he took just the fact that a one-armed guy

01:48:48.620 --> 01:48:51.620
killed his wife in a hospital's database,

01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:54.620
and he was like, he narrowed it down to, like, prosthesis,

01:48:54.620 --> 01:48:56.620
and then he figured shit out.

01:48:56.620 --> 01:48:58.620
I'm too stupid to do that stuff,

01:48:58.620 --> 01:49:00.620
but I know how he did it, he knew stuff,

01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:02.620
and then he used it to know more stuff.

01:49:02.620 --> 01:49:04.620
Could you handle the pot where he shaves in the sink,

01:49:04.620 --> 01:49:06.620
and then goes off running?

01:49:06.620 --> 01:49:09.620
He ate some oranges, and he made some ID's.

01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:12.620
Could you do the pot where you're up in the sewer thing,

01:49:12.620 --> 01:49:15.620
and he go, I don't know what, and he says, I don't care.

01:49:15.620 --> 01:49:17.620
I would reform the martial service, by the way,

01:49:17.620 --> 01:49:19.620
so that if you did shout, I didn't do it,

01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:24.620
I would have to go, all right, let's stop everything.

01:49:24.620 --> 01:49:26.620
I think it's a good look at it.

01:49:26.620 --> 01:49:28.620
Especially if your options are one,

01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:31.620
jumping over Niagara Falls, or two, getting shot.

01:49:31.620 --> 01:49:33.620
I don't think any more deaths in custody.

01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:35.620
I feel like at that point, you're supposed

01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:38.620
to just put your gun down and say, I care.

01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:39.620
Right.

01:49:39.620 --> 01:49:41.620
Or make sure that you're chasing people

01:49:41.620 --> 01:49:44.620
in smaller enclosures, like a water park or something,

01:49:44.620 --> 01:49:46.620
so that if you don't go down,

01:49:46.620 --> 01:49:48.620
if you don't choose to jump,

01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:51.620
if you only queue for about 400 feet, then you're done.

01:49:51.620 --> 01:49:54.620
Then you're in a nice puddle of spit and kid piss.

01:49:57.620 --> 01:49:59.620
All right, well, you know, I give up.

01:49:59.620 --> 01:50:01.620
I mean, Eve, you're the...

01:50:01.620 --> 01:50:02.620
That was easy.

01:50:02.620 --> 01:50:05.620
That was, you gave up faster than Rick Perry.

01:50:07.620 --> 01:50:09.620
Thank you. Zing.

01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:12.620
You're like the face lady, like you're the one

01:50:12.620 --> 01:50:15.620
who gets us the jobs and cons us into buildings,

01:50:15.620 --> 01:50:18.620
horticards, you're being played by a character.

01:50:18.620 --> 01:50:21.620
And Pat, Pat, you're...

01:50:21.620 --> 01:50:22.620
I'm just a doctor.

01:50:22.620 --> 01:50:23.620
You're a doctor.

01:50:23.620 --> 01:50:27.620
I mean, when I'm the brains of the operation, we're fucked.

01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:30.620
I'm Dan Harmon's impression of Bruce Willis.

01:50:30.620 --> 01:50:32.620
Spencer, when did the...

01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:34.620
Who was the guy at Hank's Last Stand?

01:50:34.620 --> 01:50:35.620
Was it Hank?

01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:36.620
Yep.

01:50:36.620 --> 01:50:37.620
Who wanted the MP3s?

01:50:37.620 --> 01:50:39.620
Would he know when that stuff was taken

01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:40.620
and put in that story?

01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:43.620
Would he know the date that maybe that was put in the story?

01:50:43.620 --> 01:50:46.620
I mean, he's just heard stories about this vault.

01:50:46.620 --> 01:50:47.620
It's a vault.

01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:49.620
I mean, it's a storage vault.

01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:52.620
Could I cast some sort of, like, like small animal,

01:50:52.620 --> 01:50:55.620
or cricket to go inside that can run from room to room

01:50:55.620 --> 01:50:57.620
and be able to sess out which room had it or anything?

01:50:57.620 --> 01:50:59.620
You got one. You got a couple here.

01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:01.620
Well, that's a coincidence.

01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:02.620
It's cricket season.

01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:03.620
This is a great podcast.

01:51:03.620 --> 01:51:05.620
By the way, yep.

01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:07.620
You know, scientifically,

01:51:07.620 --> 01:51:09.620
crickets really like showbiz.

01:51:09.620 --> 01:51:12.620
Some of our best shows happen during cricket mating season.

01:51:12.620 --> 01:51:14.620
So, let's look it up.

01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:16.620
Yeah.

01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:18.620
That's something you can attempt.

01:51:18.620 --> 01:51:23.620
Okay. I summon magic musical search cricket.

01:51:23.620 --> 01:51:25.620
And the cricket's going to go from room to room

01:51:25.620 --> 01:51:28.620
at light speed, or very fast, at cricket speed.

01:51:28.620 --> 01:51:31.620
And go from room to room.

01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:33.620
And find out where...

01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:35.620
Oh!

01:51:35.620 --> 01:51:38.620
That's based on the deaf punk song from Tron.

01:51:38.620 --> 01:51:41.620
Okay.

01:51:41.620 --> 01:51:44.620
Magical music cricket. Go search.

01:51:44.620 --> 01:51:47.620
The exertion of your magical music cricket

01:51:47.620 --> 01:51:50.620
makes you take three drain damages.

01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:52.620
It conjures itself into existence

01:51:52.620 --> 01:51:55.620
and starts scurrying in and out of reality.

01:51:55.620 --> 01:51:57.620
Guys, all we have to do now is wait.

01:51:57.620 --> 01:51:59.620
My cricket will take care of everything.

01:51:59.620 --> 01:52:01.620
Yeah.

01:52:01.620 --> 01:52:03.620
I mean, that's...

01:52:03.620 --> 01:52:05.620
So, just to clarify, I'm still ahead

01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:07.620
in Iowa and New Hampshire

01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:10.620
and about to pull even in South Carolina.

01:52:10.620 --> 01:52:11.620
Is that right?

01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:12.620
Yeah.

01:52:12.620 --> 01:52:13.620
Okay, good, good.

01:52:13.620 --> 01:52:15.620
Well, we're waiting for the cricket's report.

01:52:15.620 --> 01:52:16.620
I just...

01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:19.620
Even though I have the IQ of Sam Malone from Cheers,

01:52:19.620 --> 01:52:21.620
I go...

01:52:21.620 --> 01:52:23.620
I go over to the console

01:52:23.620 --> 01:52:25.620
where the guy that worked there works

01:52:25.620 --> 01:52:28.620
and I just start hitting buttons.

01:52:28.620 --> 01:52:30.620
Nothing that looks like a red button

01:52:30.620 --> 01:52:32.620
that says police above it,

01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:36.620
but just buttons like W.

01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:40.620
Or like enter or function.

01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:42.620
You do that.

01:52:42.620 --> 01:52:44.620
That's just...

01:52:44.620 --> 01:52:46.620
Those aren't commands, so...

01:52:46.620 --> 01:52:47.620
It's not...

01:52:47.620 --> 01:52:48.620
Okay, you know what?

01:52:48.620 --> 01:52:49.620
Then I come in to help him

01:52:49.620 --> 01:52:53.620
and I bring out my nice old typewriter

01:52:53.620 --> 01:52:56.620
and I roll a piece of paper in

01:52:56.620 --> 01:52:58.620
and then I just make sure with a little test

01:52:58.620 --> 01:53:00.620
like test, test, test, test, test,

01:53:00.620 --> 01:53:02.620
want to throw and then I start typing

01:53:02.620 --> 01:53:04.620
a small short message

01:53:04.620 --> 01:53:08.620
that says, hey, let him open up the door

01:53:08.620 --> 01:53:10.620
all the way up...

01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:12.620
Let him create another universe or whatever.

01:53:14.620 --> 01:53:16.620
Yes, good.

01:53:16.620 --> 01:53:18.620
Socialism.

01:53:18.620 --> 01:53:19.620
Social...

01:53:19.620 --> 01:53:21.620
You do that.

01:53:22.620 --> 01:53:25.620
You don't have any ideas, do you, Eve LeBretine?

01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:27.620
You're not suffering in silence, right?

01:53:27.620 --> 01:53:28.620
You're just kind of like...

01:53:28.620 --> 01:53:29.620
I'm kind of suffering in silence.

01:53:29.620 --> 01:53:30.620
Oh, you are?

01:53:30.620 --> 01:53:32.620
This is a good time to...

01:53:32.620 --> 01:53:35.620
No wrong answers has never been more accurate.

01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:38.620
What do you...

01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:39.620
What's on your mind?

01:53:39.620 --> 01:53:41.620
I'm not really sure.

01:53:41.620 --> 01:53:42.620
Oh, so you...

01:53:42.620 --> 01:53:43.620
I'm kind of lost.

01:53:43.620 --> 01:53:44.620
Just suffering.

01:53:44.620 --> 01:53:45.620
She's silent and suffering.

01:53:45.620 --> 01:53:46.620
I'm silent and suffering.

01:53:46.620 --> 01:53:47.620
Oh, okay, okay.

01:53:47.620 --> 01:53:49.620
Millions of Americans who are also

01:53:49.620 --> 01:53:52.620
silent and suffering

01:53:52.620 --> 01:53:55.620
in this audience and beyond.

01:53:56.620 --> 01:53:57.620
Yeah, yeah.

01:53:57.620 --> 01:53:58.620
I just meant you're not like...

01:53:58.620 --> 01:54:01.620
You're not like being polite by not...

01:54:01.620 --> 01:54:03.620
You know, you don't have...

01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:05.620
You don't know how to search a storage unit.

01:54:05.620 --> 01:54:06.620
Right.

01:54:06.620 --> 01:54:08.620
I'm just not sure what I'm supposed to be doing.

01:54:08.620 --> 01:54:09.620
Oh, yeah, I mean...

01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:11.620
Right now, I'm kind of just standing here looking pretty.

01:54:11.620 --> 01:54:13.620
That's what I'm doing right now.

01:54:13.620 --> 01:54:14.620
Oh, well, don't...

01:54:14.620 --> 01:54:15.620
I mean, come on.

01:54:15.620 --> 01:54:16.620
It's okay.

01:54:17.620 --> 01:54:18.620
Yeah, I mean, well...

01:54:18.620 --> 01:54:21.620
But part of her job is to objectify her gender.

01:54:21.620 --> 01:54:23.620
That's how we get a lot of our jobs.

01:54:23.620 --> 01:54:25.620
Pat, over there, you want me to...

01:54:25.620 --> 01:54:28.620
You want me to, like, maybe make some small talk with you?

01:54:28.620 --> 01:54:29.620
A backdrop?

01:54:29.620 --> 01:54:30.620
A backdrop?

01:54:30.620 --> 01:54:31.620
Sure, go ahead.

01:54:31.620 --> 01:54:33.620
Just because that's your job, I mean...

01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:34.620
Right, I'm just trying to do my job.

01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:35.620
That's good.

01:54:35.620 --> 01:54:36.620
That feels good.

01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:37.620
You know what, you're doing it.

01:54:37.620 --> 01:54:39.620
I mean, I think in a post-feminist world,

01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:42.620
it's one of the options that an active woman has.

01:54:42.620 --> 01:54:44.620
I think I should be able to stand here and look pretty

01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:46.620
and do my job at the same time.

01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:49.620
I sent my cricket back to see if my cricket

01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:51.620
has found any information.

01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:56.620
It says, oh, man, I found so many peanuts.

01:54:56.620 --> 01:55:00.620
You found... I asked you to look for MP3s, not peanuts.

01:55:00.620 --> 01:55:01.620
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:55:01.620 --> 01:55:03.620
There's a plosive figure there.

01:55:03.620 --> 01:55:04.620
You can understand the confusion.

01:55:04.620 --> 01:55:05.620
Right.

01:55:05.620 --> 01:55:08.620
No, I found some MP3s.

01:55:08.620 --> 01:55:09.620
I didn't find a lot.

01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:12.620
I just found Frankie Franks' Greatest Hits.

01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:15.620
You found Frankie Franks' Greatest Hits?

01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:16.620
Yeah, that's it, though.

01:55:16.620 --> 01:55:19.620
I go on the comm and find our Johnson,

01:55:19.620 --> 01:55:20.620
our Hank back at Hank LeStan and say,

01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:22.620
Hank, you got me on your comm?

01:55:22.620 --> 01:55:23.620
Yeah.

01:55:23.620 --> 01:55:25.620
Do you like Frankie Frank's Greatest Hits?

01:55:25.620 --> 01:55:26.620
No.

01:55:26.620 --> 01:55:27.620
Shit.

01:55:27.620 --> 01:55:28.620
New age guard between men.

01:55:28.620 --> 01:55:30.620
We'll call you back in a bit.

01:55:31.620 --> 01:55:33.620
I mean, I don't want to be always this guy,

01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:34.620
but maybe it's a dumb mission.

01:55:34.620 --> 01:55:35.620
Maybe it's...

01:55:35.620 --> 01:55:36.620
Maybe it was...

01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:39.620
Maybe we got made up during a drunken blackout

01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:40.620
when we had...

01:55:40.620 --> 01:55:42.620
Like a lot of overseas missions,

01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:44.620
I think that it's not wrong

01:55:44.620 --> 01:55:47.620
maybe to pull back and concentrate on a hurled country.

01:55:48.620 --> 01:55:49.620
Don't blame the mission.

01:55:49.620 --> 01:55:50.620
Or not.

01:55:51.620 --> 01:55:53.620
Right, but, well, I mean,

01:55:53.620 --> 01:55:55.620
I'm not blaming the mission,

01:55:55.620 --> 01:55:57.620
saying, like, well, we're clearly incapable

01:55:57.620 --> 01:55:58.620
of accomplishing the mission.

01:55:58.620 --> 01:55:59.620
Thank you.

01:55:59.620 --> 01:56:01.620
Don't think that the people put that boy

01:56:01.620 --> 01:56:02.620
to his impossible,

01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:04.620
even an envelope that's inscrutable.

01:56:06.620 --> 01:56:07.620
How many...

01:56:07.620 --> 01:56:09.620
I know that there's a way of knowing

01:56:09.620 --> 01:56:11.620
with Hackeye's information

01:56:11.620 --> 01:56:14.620
how many storage units?

01:56:14.620 --> 01:56:15.620
250.

01:56:15.620 --> 01:56:16.620
250.

01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:17.620
All right.

01:56:17.620 --> 01:56:20.620
So, a cricket crawls a maximum of

01:56:20.620 --> 01:56:23.620
three feet per minute.

01:56:24.620 --> 01:56:26.620
I don't think that's an option.

01:56:27.620 --> 01:56:29.620
Everyone's response to that was amazing.

01:56:29.620 --> 01:56:31.620
Like, that's the most controversial thing

01:56:31.620 --> 01:56:32.620
I've ever said.

01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:33.620
It really is.

01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:34.620
I think a cricket crawls...

01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:35.620
Three feet a minute.

01:56:35.620 --> 01:56:36.620
I think a cricket crawls...

01:56:36.620 --> 01:56:38.620
It's more of snail speed, huh?

01:56:38.620 --> 01:56:39.620
Yeah, it's not fast.

01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:40.620
Okay, man.

01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:41.620
I have the data.

01:56:41.620 --> 01:56:42.620
I've looked at the data.

01:56:42.620 --> 01:56:43.620
Spencer, how many rooms has it had?

01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:44.620
From Brandeis University,

01:56:44.620 --> 01:56:46.620
and crickets are able to go about 15 meters.

01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:48.620
Whether they're not, you know...

01:56:48.620 --> 01:56:49.620
Spencer, how many rooms has the cricket been through?

01:56:49.620 --> 01:56:51.620
What percentage of those 250 has he gone through?

01:56:51.620 --> 01:56:53.620
You don't know.

01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:56.620
I mean, it's a cricket.

01:56:56.620 --> 01:56:57.620
You sent him out.

01:56:57.620 --> 01:56:58.620
You brought him back.

01:56:58.620 --> 01:56:59.620
He said he found crickets.

01:56:59.620 --> 01:57:01.620
Okay, at the risk of draining myself more,

01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:02.620
can I summon three more crickets

01:57:02.620 --> 01:57:04.620
and triple the speed on this?

01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:05.620
You know, it'd be great.

01:57:05.620 --> 01:57:06.620
What?

01:57:06.620 --> 01:57:07.620
How much does 250 cost?

01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:10.620
Send one cricket into fucking every single room.

01:57:10.620 --> 01:57:12.620
That would probably drain me to death.

01:57:12.620 --> 01:57:13.620
Yeah, probably.

01:57:13.620 --> 01:57:16.620
I took three or four drain on one cricket.

01:57:16.620 --> 01:57:17.620
Can you...

01:57:17.620 --> 01:57:19.620
Can I get 12 drain or something?

01:57:19.620 --> 01:57:20.620
Are we going to get sued?

01:57:20.620 --> 01:57:21.620
What?

01:57:21.620 --> 01:57:22.620
No.

01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:23.620
No, we haven't played shit.

01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:25.620
We haven't even done anything.

01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:27.620
I walk up to one of the storage lockers,

01:57:27.620 --> 01:57:28.620
and I take my gun,

01:57:28.620 --> 01:57:31.620
and I shoot at the...

01:57:31.620 --> 01:57:33.620
The lock?

01:57:33.620 --> 01:57:34.620
The lock.

01:57:34.620 --> 01:57:35.620
Yes, thank you.

01:57:35.620 --> 01:57:36.620
That's the word I was looking for.

01:57:36.620 --> 01:57:38.620
You shoot the lock off the storage container,

01:57:38.620 --> 01:57:42.620
and the roller door rolls up.

01:57:42.620 --> 01:57:45.620
We've got 249 more.

01:57:45.620 --> 01:57:50.620
Well, look around and see if you see any MP3s in there.

01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:51.620
I look around.

01:57:51.620 --> 01:57:57.620
You see stacks upon stacks of anorandac chairs.

01:57:57.620 --> 01:58:03.620
We'll come back for these later.

01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:05.620
Let's thank Pat and Hannah, our newly engaged,

01:58:05.620 --> 01:58:08.620
newly athiasts,

01:58:08.620 --> 01:58:11.620
Disney-loving New Hampshireites.

01:58:11.620 --> 01:58:13.620
Thank you, Senator.

01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:16.620
Please have a huge round of applause for Senator Bernie Sanders.

01:58:16.620 --> 01:58:18.620
Feel the burn!

01:58:18.620 --> 01:58:21.620
As played by James Hadamian, everybody.

01:58:21.620 --> 01:58:24.620
The wonderful, fantastic James Hadamian.

01:58:24.620 --> 01:58:28.620
Spencer Crittenden.

01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:29.620
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:58:29.620 --> 01:58:34.620
Your mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:58:34.620 --> 01:58:36.620
Chris Brown.

01:58:36.620 --> 01:58:38.620
Justin in the booth,

01:58:38.620 --> 01:58:40.620
Justin producing all-ferral audio podcasts,

01:58:40.620 --> 01:58:43.620
bringing them to you with his weird pirate shirts

01:58:43.620 --> 01:58:50.620
and jaw-grinding emotional things.

01:58:50.620 --> 01:58:52.620
And also, Kris Boruff, Kevin Day, Sarah Hill,

01:58:52.620 --> 01:58:53.620
Zac McKeever.

01:58:53.620 --> 01:58:54.620
All the people out here, Norton,

01:58:54.620 --> 01:58:55.620
I'll thank you so much.

01:58:55.620 --> 01:58:56.620
It's a tenuousness.

01:58:56.620 --> 01:58:58.620
No, sorry, I was finishing the sentence.

01:58:58.620 --> 01:59:00.620
I started 10 minutes ago.

01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:01.620
All right, drive fast and take chances.

01:59:01.620 --> 01:59:02.620
Thank you for coming, everybody.

01:59:02.620 --> 01:59:04.620
Are we the best of Shadowrunner?

01:59:04.620 --> 01:59:05.620
What?

01:59:05.620 --> 01:59:09.620
Did you get any of that?

01:59:09.620 --> 01:59:11.620
It's a good show!
