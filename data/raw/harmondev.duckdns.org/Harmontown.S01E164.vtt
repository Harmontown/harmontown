{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:17.000\nFrom Hollywood, California, Sunset Boulevard, Sunset Strip, Meltdown Comics, and Nerdmelt Theater Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:17.000 --> 00:31.000\nLet's bring out Spencer Crittenden in our Game Master.\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:43.000\nAnd just for good measure, let's bring out the good mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:43.000 --> 01:02.000\nThank you. Thank you very, very much. You're always very kind, even though we keep doing this over and over again. You guys keep reacting so it's like they're happy every time.\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:10.000\nI feel like this crowd is extra special, happy tonight. There's something about this crowd.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:14.000\nThere is electricity and a free song in the air right now.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:23.000\nAnd yet we say that all the time. It's not always the exact same people, but they always fall for that too.\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:29.000\nI feel like they must be smarter than last week's audience somehow.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:43.000\nI don't know if they're smarter. I think that they're leaning farther downhill. They're ready for more of a free fall. You guys are up for an adventure more than last week, I think, right?\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:48.000\nI think you guys want to go on a bear hunt.\n\n01:48.000 --> 02:00.000\nA lot of people are like, wait, what is that? Is that like a weird college thing? Is that like a fratty whore?\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:06.000\nWe had a bear hunt, but it got cut out of the episode.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:20.000\nYeah, so I imagine it exists somewhere on the Harmontown Extra if you buy the platinum package or whatever and you get all the unedited cities if you go to the Nashville one.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:35.000\nIn my blackout, blind drunk, I take the audience on a bear hunt, which was a thing that we did in my daycare center that I remember at Red Carpet Bowling Lanes.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:48.000\nThe parents would drop the kids off and then the kids would just roll around on the linoleum and traumatize each other, but then every once in a while an old lady would say, let's go on a bear hunt.\n\n02:48.000 --> 03:01.000\nAnd then after that she'd go, okay, now you can go play with the toys and the three fastest kids would get to the dirty big wheel first and I'd hide under a table.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:07.000\nA girl put a crayon in my mouth.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:09.000\nShe came up to you and put a crayon in your mouth?\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:25.000\nShe put a crayon in my mouth and looking back at it as an adult, what I picture, the weird thing is, I hate her so much, but also I'm able to recognize, because she said something like, you could be pretty or something.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:32.000\nShe was really wanting to use the crayon as lipstick. She wanted to put lipstick on me.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:33.000\nShe was giving you a makeover?\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:44.000\nYeah, which is probably flirting as far as what 40-year-olds are concerned. I don't know how old we were, but on one hand I'm able to recognize that she meant no harm.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:59.000\nAnd on the other hand, I still, at 42, I still have all of the revulsion and hatred that my tiny brain felt because I had no idea what the hell, why would someone lunge at me and stick a crayon in my lips?\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:01.000\nDid she ram it into your mouth or did she?\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:06.000\nShe had bad aim. Our muscles were protoplasmic.\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:09.000\nDo you think there was a chance that she was trying to be inclusive?\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:15.000\nYeah, that's what I just said.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:23.000\nOh, you mean inclusive, you mean like progressively, like she was thinking about gender roles? No, I think she was like Drew Barrymore and I was ET.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:26.000\nShe was doing a clumsy job of befriending you.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:27.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:33.000\nShe wanted to play house. She wanted to play, you know, maybe she wanted to play sexy time, I don't know.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:46.000\nBut I don't think she was like, you know, she wasn't, it's years from that age before kids developed the part of their brain that knows that I'm a disgusting monster.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:52.000\nThat comes right before a sense of direction.\n\n04:52.000 --> 05:04.000\nThey've done studies where they put six year old girls into an MRI and they study the centers of their brains that light up and they show a picture of Dan Harmon.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:13.000\nAnd from five and a half to six, it's like same section as ice cream or like a fire hydrant.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:17.000\nI shouldn't have said same section as ice cream.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:27.000\nYeah, because we live in this now, we're all pedophiles era where everything, every time you mentioned a child where our brains are waiting for the pedophile thing.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:31.000\nSo I said ice cream was just something you like.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:38.000\nSo let's just abandon this whole thing.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:44.000\nBut well, to finish my thought, then at six they show it.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:55.000\nAnd they show a picture of me and then it's like, oh, they shut, it's the space shuttle Challenger exploding or a Shrek or, I don't know, like a chicken, chicken, chicken pox.\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:58.000\nWhat is six year olds hate?\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:04.000\nOh, when our space program goes all right, that's what they hate.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:14.000\nWhen you were elementary school, preschool through fifth grade, was there ever any flirtation romance stories in your life?\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:15.000\nWas it ever not awkward?\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:18.000\nOh, God, well, I almost spent to remember when I was in the car with you.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:19.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nEvery day for the last two years.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:23.000\nThat was great, man.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:34.000\nI feel like you're not supposed to, now that it's not like a black box cabaret show anymore, but I want to say her whole name.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:37.000\nI mean, because that was all she was, was a name.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:41.000\nAnd this little, literally a little redhead girl, which is like a Charlie Brown thing.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:42.000\nIt was kindergarten.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:45.000\nSee, the lipstick girl, the Korean girl, was like, what are you doing?\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:49.000\nShe was probably a brunette or something.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:57.000\nBut my first, because it was when Yvonne Craig passed away and I was thinking about, oh, Yvonne Craig.\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:02.000\nAnd I was thinking of early, what was my first redhead moment?\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:04.000\nWell, I didn't know they were redhead.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:21.000\nYeah, what was my first kind of like spark of, what is it, acetaminophen that makes you, I don't know.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:22.000\nI don't have to explain anything.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:23.000\nI think it's funny.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.000\nI'm laughing at myself.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:33.000\nBut if they isolated the chemical that makes you fall in love and it's acetaminophen, and everyone's like, oh, this explains everything.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:35.000\nWe were never looking for that connection.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:39.000\nI, oh God, I got married because I had a hangover.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:42.000\nAnd I, oh my God, acetaminophen.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:44.000\nThat's it.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:55.000\nThe, anyways, the, yeah, Nicole, it was, it was, in kindergarten, they take roll call and they go, they say, you know, they, you know, they say your name.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:59.000\nAnd then you go here.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:04.000\nDan, back it up and walk me through this.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:08.000\nAnd pretend I never went to school and explain.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:10.000\nMy last name was Harmon.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:15.000\nBack then, my first name was either, it was probably, was it Daniel or Danny?\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:16.000\nProbably Daniel.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:17.000\nYeah, probably Daniel.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nYeah, Daniel, yeah, for sure.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:22.000\nIs this the same class where the Royal Champagne went to?\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:24.000\nNo, that was middle school.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:29.000\nNo, nobody in kindergarten stood up and said, you may call me Royal Champagne.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:32.000\nThat would be amazing.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:33.000\nWait, no, we're kindergarten.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:37.000\nWe're still, some of us are still pooping our pants.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:40.000\nTo this very day.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:50.000\nAnd so, and so I, like, we, you know, sitting in a circle, and the way we sat and the order in which our names were called, there was always this pattern.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:57.000\nSo, and the H's come before the M's and her name, you know, let's just cross our fingers.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:00.000\nMaybe she won't sue us and that this isn't defamation of any kind.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nHer name seems like, I'm not going to change her name.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:04.000\nHer name was Nicole McHugh.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:13.000\nIt was such a, such a, you know, it's such a perfect, like, it's like fictional, like kind of first, first, you know, little girl crush kind of name.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:19.000\nAnd she, and then Daniel Harmon, and I'd go, and I don't know, I don't know who started it.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:34.000\nAnd what happened, but, but, like, somehow, just the tradition became that whenever my name was called, I would, I would say here, and I'd look at her, and she'd smile, and we'd both smile, and then we'd giggle.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:40.000\nAnd then, and then name, name, name, piece of shit, random piece of shit.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:47.000\nAnd then, and then the same, and then when Nicole McHugh, and she would raise her hand and we would lock eyes again, and then giggle and smile.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:50.000\nAnd it was like, that was the entire relationship.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nI never talked to her on the playground.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:56.000\nAnd I probably made the whole thing up in my head.\n\n09:56.000 --> 10:01.000\nI probably, I probably just created huge gaps where she was probably giggling at everybody.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:02.000\nNo, I really don't think that.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:03.000\nWell, of course you don't think that, Dan.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:05.000\nYou made it up in your head.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:06.000\nYou invented thoughts.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nOf course you think them.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:13.000\nBut I, well, I don't, I don't, I don't remember them as hallucinations.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:18.000\nI had the same thing with, with like kindergarten, I think, with the same initials, NM.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:23.000\nHer name was Nancy Mendelson, and I had this fantasy relationship with her that never existed.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:27.000\nI don't, I don't know that we ever spoke to each other, but in my mind that, wow, we were quite in love.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:30.000\nAnd I don't think I ever had a moment's conversation with her.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:32.000\nIt's all downhill from there, man.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:35.000\nYou know, isn't it?\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:38.000\nSpencer, do you have, do you have an early, like, proto relationship like that?\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:40.000\nNah, man, you guys are fucking nerds.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:50.000\nOkay, we have a new segment.\n\n10:50.000 --> 11:02.000\nThis new, this, this new segment is called, um, uh, possibly awesome ideas I, I, I came up with during a blackout drunk at the TV guide showrunners party.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:13.000\nYo, yo, yo, yo, yo, sometimes TV guide has a party, and they invite all the smarties that make the TV like Shonda Rhimes,\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:21.000\nand Dan Harmon gets invited some of the time except for season four, and he'll never forget it.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:26.000\nBut now he's back, and he's at the table because Rick and Morty showed them all I was able,\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:41.000\nso I get to sit there and get real drunk, and I talk too loud, and I feel bad the next morning.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:45.000\nThere's a little iced tea in there.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:48.000\nYou're about to get sued three times.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:55.000\nWell, you know, that's, that's just business.\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:59.000\nSo, okay, so I came up with this idea, like, like, like, Chris McKenna was there.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nI was, I asked him, I don't know, I wrote it down.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:03.000\nI was like, I'm so proud of this idea.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:08.000\nI have no idea how, like, like, I was like, okay, so it's a dystopian premise.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:13.000\nIt's called Peek Hitler, uh, peak, like, peak oil.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:18.000\nIs it because in the, it's in the future where, what I wrote down is, but this guy was drunk,\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:31.000\nlike, a world where temporally oligarchic corporations draw oil from the subcutaneous residue of a supposedly infinite supply of Hitlers.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:36.000\nSupposedly.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:41.000\nSo, like, like, in the future they find out that, like, like, there's everyone right under their scalp,\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:45.000\nor between their skull and their brain, or maybe right between their scalp and their skull, who knows,\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:53.000\nor maybe at the base of their spine, but let's just, everyone has, like, a, just a tiny little bit of, of oil that you could use to run a car.\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:57.000\nLike, like sperm whales used to have, like, the giant gallons of, yeah.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:58.000\nYeah.\n\n12:58.000 --> 12:59.000\nLike, lamp oil.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:08.000\nSo, so, you know, a corporation, you know, goes like, look, we have time travel now, and there are infinite timelines.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:14.000\nRaise your hand if you're against drilling into Hitler.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:18.000\nAnd everyone's like, that's the cold up in the movie, everyone's like, nice.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:19.000\nOkay.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:22.000\nAnd then they're like, the lack of nays have it.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:28.000\nMobile Time Warner will commence with its Hitler oil campaign.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:33.000\nAnd then you can, and then it goes, 3,080.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nAnd then there's like, because I, I, I think,\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:39.000\nDo they keep going back in time and drilling into the same Hitler, or are there, are there more than one?\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:40.000\nThere's infinite Hitlers.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:41.000\nInfinite Hitlers.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:47.000\nAnd at the same time, Hitler does or doesn't slip in the shower or take a, take an art class or whatever.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:52.000\nLike, he becomes a technically different Hitler from the, from, from all the other Hitlers.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:56.000\nBut they're all Hitler.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:57.000\nTherefore.\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:58.000\nSo you got quantum, quantum.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:00.000\nAnd infinite oil is infinite oil, baby.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:03.000\nIt doesn't matter if you get one drop per Hitler.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:07.000\nAnd so, and so you see the process, but this, that's the, that's the ordinary world.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:14.000\nAnd then the, and then the threshold you cross is like, there's a technician who's like, he encounters like a, it's like, you know,\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:25.000\nThe question of like, I think this guy was, I don't, I don't, I don't know if this, I don't know if this guy was going to end up being that bad a Hitler.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nOne of the alternate Hitlers.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\nYeah, he's like, like, like that's like the big moment.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:30.000\nHe was a good artist.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:33.000\nIt's like, it's like, it's like Project X with Matthew Broderick.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:36.000\nMatthew Broderick is the guy who's in charge of like, or Minority Report.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:41.000\nIt's like, you know, it's like any other, like, like, you, you know, you have a guy who's in charge of doing this thing.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:47.000\nAnd this is the way the world works is you take a Hitler, you put like a transparent plastic dome on his head.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:52.000\nLike, while he's walking down an alleyway in Austria or something.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:55.000\nAnd, and, and he's like, oh, got in the Himmel.\n\n14:55.000 --> 15:02.000\nAnd you're, and you're like, you know, and you're like, look, I know you can't understand me, but, but, but, but, but trust me, you're Hitler.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:09.000\nAnd, like, this is, this is going to hurt you more than it's going to hurt my car.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:15.000\nAnd then it's like the title sequence.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:20.000\nAnd I know I have a lot of cold opens in this movie, but.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:27.000\nSo, but then the threshold is like a guy is like, like, you know, there's like a guy, I don't like the drill bit breaks or something.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:32.000\nAnd then it's like something goes wrong. And then the Hitler starts running and the guy's like, God damn it.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:33.000\nWe got to fucking wait.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nIt's like, this is temporal.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:39.000\nLet's see. I mean, numbers seven, five, two, we got, we got a runner. I'll, I'll get him.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:42.000\nAnd he's like, chases him, chases him back to Hitler's apartment.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:44.000\nAnd he kind of, he's like, let me in there, Hitler.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:45.000\nYou're fucking Hitler.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:46.000\nI know you don't get that.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:52.000\nAnd he's like, I'm kicking down that fucking door, Hitler.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:54.000\nI'm kicking it down.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:58.000\nI don't care if you have a Walther P 38 under the, under your mattress.\n\n15:58.000 --> 15:59.000\nNice.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:02.000\nI bet you will try to shoot me because you're Hitler.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:06.000\nBut, but it won't matter because like, and it kicks down the door.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:12.000\nAnd then the camera pushes on just an adorable Hitler.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:15.000\nLike, who do you cast as adorable Hitler?\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:16.000\nWho's the actor?\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:17.000\nWell.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:20.000\nDon't get sued a fourth time.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:32.000\nI'm probably not Hugh Jackman, but at the same time, I don't know.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:35.000\nLike, and it's not, you know, let's put a pin in that.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:36.000\nOkay.\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:40.000\nBut it's like, the point is like, like, like, like it's, maybe it's a CG Hitler.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:44.000\nMaybe it's like, maybe it's like Gollum, you know, you create a Hitler so that you can\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:45.000\nget really accurate.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:48.000\nI think you put like a Jake Gyllenhaal or a Tove McGuire in there.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:49.000\nI think you make it like.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:50.000\nOh, Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:51.000\nYeah.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:52.000\nToby McGuire is good.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:53.000\nI like that.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:54.000\nYeah.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:55.000\nToby.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:56.000\nOh no.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:57.000\nElijah Wood.\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:58.000\nWho?\n\n16:58.000 --> 16:59.000\nOh yeah.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:00.000\nElijah Wood.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:01.000\nOh man.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:02.000\nOkay.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:03.000\nThat's our Hitler.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:04.000\nGuys, we got our Hitler.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:09.000\nSo it pushes on him and he's doing, you know, fill in the blanks.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:11.000\nThis is, you know, I'm a structure guy.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:12.000\nI'm a dialogue guy.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:15.000\nI'm not a fucking like, I don't care about the details.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:21.000\nHe's like, you know, he's got a kitten or, or he's like, you know, he's like setting\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:24.000\nfire to sonnets that he wrote to some areas.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:27.000\nHe's like, or he's like, he's doing something that does guidance.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:29.000\nIt's like, it violates.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:32.000\nJust give me one second.\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:36.000\nWhatever, whatever he sees when he kicks down that door, it's, it's specifically the first\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:38.000\n15 pages of the script.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:41.000\nIt was, it said that this is not, this is not how Hitler's work.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:42.000\nRight.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:44.000\nLike they don't have feelings.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:49.000\nMy question is, what set this, one of these infinite Hitlers, what, what set him off on\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:50.000\na different, more adorable?\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:55.000\nThis is that wooden ball that comes down the minority tube that's like, you know, oh,\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:59.000\nI thought the trans, trans, trans, trans, trans cognitives.\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:02.000\nI thought they didn't, I thought they didn't make mistakes or whatever.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:05.000\nI thought, I thought Hitlers didn't have pets.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:08.000\nYou know, I thought they loved, I thought they loved racism.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:11.000\nAnd he says, I didn't, I don't know what you're talking about.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:12.000\nI'm just, I'm just me.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:14.000\nYou know, you're one of a million possible Hitlers.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:15.000\nYeah.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:18.000\nAnd he's like, well, why is that a bad thing?\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:24.000\nAnd then, and the guy's like, like, he just hears like, I don't know if they had sirens\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:28.000\nback then, but the, and then he just goes like, and then like shoots him with a silencer.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:32.000\nBut like, and you think he just killed him, but then it turns out he like put him in a\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:35.000\nbag and he takes him to a field and he sets him free.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:37.000\nIt's not about that Hitler.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:42.000\nIt's about an industry running on, on infinite Hitlers and the idea of, you know, if there\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:47.000\nare infinite Hitlers, then, you know, it's the idea that we've run out of bad Hitlers.\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:48.000\nThat's the thing.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nIt's like the fucking still corporate greed.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:56.000\nIn a world of infinite timelines, they've taken oil out of all of the bad Hitlers.\n\n18:56.000 --> 19:02.000\nThey've created a universe, a multiverse in which the only thing remaining are average Hitlers.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:03.000\nRight.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:08.000\nBut, but, but the head of the oil company is saying, look, we can still get away with\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:11.000\neven mining oil out of good Hitlers because they're still Hitlers.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nAnd there's somebody that works underneath that person.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:18.000\nIt's like, no, you're, we're now just dealing with regular people now, just regular good\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:19.000\nHitlers.\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:24.000\nIs the, is the Hitler, is one of the good Hitlers, is Elijah Wood Hitler the protagonist of\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:25.000\nthis?\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:28.000\nOr is the, the oil industry guy that sets those Hitlers free?\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:31.000\nElijah Wood as Hitler is the polar ice caps.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:34.000\nYou know, he's like, or, or oil, you know.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:37.000\nIt's like, it's like, it doesn't, he's like the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:38.000\nCertainly part of the draw.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:40.000\nDefinitely on the poster.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:42.000\nIs there a, is there a Jeff, not the protagonist.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:45.000\nIs there a Jeff Goldblum character who steps in and says, I think what you're doing is\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:48.000\na unethical, uh, yes.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:50.000\nAll right.\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:54.000\nMoving on to, to, to, to, to, uh, another segment.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:55.000\nActually, we could keep this up.\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:56.000\nWell, okay.\n\n19:56.000 --> 20:01.000\nUh, awesome things I came up with, uh, uh, in a, in a different blackout drugs, uh,\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:02.000\nthat weren't at the TV guy party.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:03.000\nThat's the segment.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:04.000\nYou, you want some music for that?\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:05.000\nYeah.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:06.000\nYeah.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:09.000\nDan drinks a lot.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:11.000\nSo the stories aren't all he's got.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:15.000\nIt doesn't just wait till TV guides party to get slosh.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:17.000\nHe does it all the time.\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:19.000\nAnd he's always awesome.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:22.000\nAnd he always comes up with things that he has to write down.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:23.000\nOkay.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:27.000\nI was drinking with Dino.\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:36.000\nDino was talking about, so, so Dino, um, assuming he has, he does not mind, uh, details about\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:40.000\nhis, I think if he were here, he would share any old secret.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:46.000\nSo he has, he has, he has a, he has a tattoo, like right above his wiener.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:49.000\nUh, somebody was asking about his tattoo.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:53.000\nHe has like a tattoo that's like a thing in Greek on his arm.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:56.000\nUm, uh, but then, and then he said, somebody was asking him, is that the only tattoo you\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:57.000\nhave?\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:59.000\nAnd he's like, well, I do have another one.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:02.000\nIt's above, it's above my, uh, my wiener.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:05.000\nHe said, it's in my bikini area.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:11.000\nSo that means it's like, unless he's shaving it all the time, it's like hidden by hairs,\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:12.000\nright?\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:13.000\nYeah.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\nYou're, you're, you're, well, yeah.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:19.000\nIs the art of the, is the art of the design worked into that?\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:20.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:21.000\nIt's like a lurking tiger.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:25.000\nI saw Dino in New York with his, I saw Dino, when Dino passed out in New York with his\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:30.000\npants down, I saw him, his, his pants were, he had a belt on and his pants were fastened\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:34.000\nand zipped up, but it was still below his dick and balls.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:38.000\nAnd he, he was wearing women's tights and fetish underwear.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:43.000\nIt was cut out so I could see his dick and balls through, through mesh.\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:45.000\nI don't think he was wearing women's tights.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:47.000\nI think it was just wearing a special underwear.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:48.000\nNo.\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:50.000\nI mean, there, there was, yeah, it was fetishy stuff.\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:51.000\nIt was a lot of layers.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:52.000\nYeah.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:53.000\nIt was a lot of layers.\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:54.000\nI mean, his pants weren't around his ankles.\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:55.000\nHow would you know?\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:57.000\nNo, they were like below, like mid-thigh.\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:58.000\nAll right.\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:01.000\nI saw no tattoo is what I'm saying.\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:02.000\nAll right.\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:08.000\nSo this is, this story's about me.\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:16.000\nThe point of departure is that I have a friend who has a tattoo above his penis dick.\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:22.000\nI keep pausing before I say dick, but not because I think there's like an S and P department,\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:25.000\nbut because I just feel like, I don't know the word, if I keep saying the word dick,\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:26.000\nbecause it's about a tattoo above a dick.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:28.000\nI'm like, guys, I don't know.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:31.000\nI was like somehow categorizing that as like, oh, what kind of podcast is this?\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:32.000\nI don't know.\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:35.000\nI don't know what my, I don't know what my fucking deal is, but.\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:37.000\nThe story, the story's about you, man.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:38.000\nThere's it.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:39.000\nThere's it.\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:40.000\nSo I go, okay.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:41.000\nOh boy.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:45.000\nWell, this, he's like, oh, he goes like, why is there a tattoo of your dick?\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:50.000\nDominatrix put it there as a, as a form of domination.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:55.000\nShe, she, she was like, she was like, she was like, you know, putting it there to like humiliate me.\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:56.000\nI was like, oh boy.\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:57.000\nOh, what, what is it?\n\n22:57.000 --> 22:59.000\nAnd he's like, it's an X.\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:03.000\nAnd I was like, well, that's what's on treasure.\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:11.000\nThat's like, like, like what, like in the worst case scenario, it means 10 something.\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:14.000\nLike, it doesn't even, what do you, that's.\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:23.000\nOr you got something wrong on family feud or boldest strike, but you're right.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:28.000\nThat is the worst case scenario as you lost on family, but still kidding on family feud is a big deal.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:34.000\nAnyways, did you just send me a text Spencer?\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:35.000\nNah, man.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:40.000\nOh wait, I guess I probably did because I responded to Steve who is texting us.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:41.000\nSorry.\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:42.000\nAll right.\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:46.000\nSo the shit I have to go through and all right.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:49.000\nSo he had this story, the story has a point.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:55.000\nAgain, as with the last story, it's about the great ideas that I have that how, and how, how good I am at what I do.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:58.000\nSo he goes like, it's an accident.\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:04.000\nSo then it was like, we're going like, well, you know, Drew Hancock and Wade Randolph were there at the drawing room.\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:06.000\nAnd we're all like an X and X.\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:08.000\nAnd he's like, look, she's not, she's not a writer.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:09.000\nShe's a dominatrix.\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:13.000\nLike, okay, well, let's beat this tattoo.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:20.000\nYou know, like, what would you tattoo above someone's dick to like, like, and I, and I, we didn't brainstorm for a long time.\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:26.000\nLike I, the thing I'm proud of is that this was the first, this is it for me.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:27.000\nRight.\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:29.000\nI didn't bother your first pitch.\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:30.000\nYeah.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:32.000\nI didn't like hit a bunch of areas and pick the best ones.\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:33.000\nI think this is it.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:34.000\nI just picked.\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:35.000\nI was like, okay, well, what do you do?\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:37.000\nAnd I went and I was like, okay, I got it.\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:38.000\nI got it.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:39.000\nOkay.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:45.000\nSo, so in, in, in, in, in, in 1938, there was this cartoon called Nancy.\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:50.000\nUh, and it was like syndicated in like the 80s and stuff eventually went away.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:57.000\nIt was like a little, it's like a little, uh, should have pulled up like a, you know, it's like a, like, like, like the younger people probably won't remember.\n\n24:57.000 --> 25:01.000\nLike people my age, like probably remember when Nancy and Marma Duke and all this shit were in the paper.\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:05.000\nLike one of these things was like, like she, it was kind of drawn in a Steamboat Willie style.\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:07.000\nIt was like such an old cartoon.\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:08.000\nIt was like originated in 1938.\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:10.000\nKind of had a black bob haircut.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:11.000\nYeah.\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:17.000\nLike on Wikipedia, it says, uh, she was a chubby, precocious eight year old.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:18.000\nThat was the gimmick.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:20.000\nThat's how young cartoons were.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:22.000\nLike that was, that was ironic.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:25.000\nIt was like, what if, what if, what if she was chubby and precocious?\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:28.000\nIt was like cut, cut to the guy making shoe.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:30.000\nAnd he's like, fuck, I don't know.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:32.000\nWhat if birds worked in an office?\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:33.000\nFuck me.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:35.000\nI don't know.\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:40.000\nI'd love to just draw chubby girls all day, uh, hanging out, uh, making mistakes,\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:41.000\nlearning about life.\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:45.000\nUh, so Nancy was, Nancy was a chubby, precocious girl.\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:50.000\nLike with the kind of like, I think like oval kind of like almost a little orphan Annie,\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:52.000\nbut filled in eyes.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:56.000\nAnd, and the thing is like every time in that cartoon, every time she'd look at something,\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:59.000\nthere would be like a dotted line going for her eyes.\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:01.000\nSo, so that's, that's why I need to use her.\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:06.000\nCause I don't care about that cartoon, but it's, it was, but, but I also think it's really funny.\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:12.000\nIt's really funny, the specifics of it says, so it's Nancy, like, like above his dick and\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:15.000\nshe's looking at the dotted line goes down to his dick.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:21.000\nAnd then there's a thought balloon above her head and it's a dollar sign with a line through it.\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:36.000\nAnd the caption is, uh, hey Dino, 1938 called your dicks worthless.\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:43.000\nI was just very proud of it.\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:47.000\nSo I wrote it down and it took me 40 minutes to explain it.\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:49.000\nI think, I think it holds up.\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:54.000\nYeah. So does peak Hitler with speed.\n\n26:54.000 --> 27:02.000\nWell, speaking of peak Hitler, it takes less gasoline than is in one Hitler to go to an alternate timeline.\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:09.000\nYes. Because well, here's the thing.\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:12.000\nOkay. So it's corporations.\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:18.000\nOkay. Well, my, my, my knee jerk answer to that.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:24.000\nIs, uh, you know, have you seen scandalous?\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:26.000\nI mean, come on. No, no.\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:32.000\nMy knee jerk reaction is, uh, uh, is, is it's a corporation.\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:36.000\nThey don't, they just want there to keep being oil.\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:39.000\nThey don't care how much it costs.\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:46.000\nWell, they have, if, if Exxon has, has like the ability to, to, to time travel.\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:49.000\nThey're just going to use it to sell you more oil.\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:55.000\nThey're not going to come out with a car called the, the new Ford instantaneous.\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:58.000\nNow you don't have to really drive.\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:01.000\nYou can just sit in a car with no wheels and blink to your office.\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:03.000\nThey'd be like, then we're out of fucking money.\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:04.000\nYeah. Yeah.\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:05.000\nSo they're, I don't know.\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:08.000\nAnd come on, I know, I know it has holes in it.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:12.000\nI, I, yeah, no, I mean, I'm thinking of all sorts of ways to solve that.\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:18.000\nI mean, how, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me answer your question with a question.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:27.000\nSo are you telling me that, that in the future, uh, uh, the, uh, fossil fuels, uh, uh, uh,\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:31.000\nuh, driven industries have, have shrunk our polar ice caps to the point where there's\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:33.000\nnow more room to, to drill.\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:35.000\nAnd that's what they want to do.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:40.000\nLike that's crazy too.\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:47.000\nThat's crazy. Yeah.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:51.000\nHold it. Hold it for 30 more seconds then.\n\n28:51.000 --> 29:09.000\n29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17,\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:31.000\n23, 22, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, he hasn't even blinked, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:48.000\nWhen you hold your head real still, people are gone.\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:51.000\nType flap, beep, beep.\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:55.000\nUm, I don't know.\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:58.000\nI think we, we might have made podcast history there.\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:03.000\nUh, we certainly, we certainly, we certainly proved to all of my detractors right that\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:10.000\nthis is definitely a, a, a, a show that succeeds more at a cult of personality than, than any\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:14.000\nactual empirical measurable value.\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:20.000\nIf, if you're just looking at a guy not doing, not blinking and, uh, that's not on you guys.\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:21.000\nThat's on me.\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:23.000\nI should bring more to the table.\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:32.000\nUh, uh, uh, well, I thought, I mean, I thought, wait, wait, I, I, I, what?\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:35.000\nI'm just stretching.\n\n30:35.000 -->

always also kneeling on a beach with his knees at a certain distance.\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:49.000\nAnd I was like, he knows that triangle thing.\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:54.000\nUm, wait, take me through that one.\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:57.000\nYou're not familiar with that triangle thing?\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:58.000\nI am not.\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:02.000\nI don't know, there's, I'm talking about God guys, like, like, like the naked lady pictures,\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:05.000\nthey have like certain rules that are based on certain angles and stuff.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:07.000\nAnd I, and I don't know what they are.\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:10.000\nI was, I was referencing that concept without knowing what they are.\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:11.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:18.000\nIt's, um, which I

better.\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:01.000\nEven though squares work.\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:02.000\nYeah.\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:03.000\nYeah.\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:04.000\nYeah.\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:08.000\nHave you

34:27.000\nI would have fucking gone.\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:29.000\nActually, no, I couldn't have gone because I was out of town, but I would have loved\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:30.000\nto have been there.\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:32.000\nSo everybody is all fancy pants.\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:33.000\nEveryone's dressed up.\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:34.000\nOh yeah.\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:35.000\nDid anybody

34:53.000\nIs that why you came from New Hampshire to LA?\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:54.000\nPart of the reason why we came.\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:55.000\nOkay.\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:57.000\nNow what goes on at

curl my hair frontwards, which meant\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:25.000\nthat it just fell in front of my face every time I tried to do something.\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:26.000\nAnd then-\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:28.000\nYou know who loves that?\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:29.000\nCats.\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:35.000\nAnd the cat in every man.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:39.000\nNow Hannah and Pat, have you guys ever been to

since we started dating.\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:45.000\nOnce a year since you started-\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:46.000\nHow long have you been dating?\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:48.000\nFive and a half years.\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:49.000\nYeah.\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:50.000\nAlmost six.\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:53.000\nSo every year you come from New Hampshire to California-\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:54.000\nTo Florida.\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:55.000\nTo Florida too.\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:56.000\nOkay.\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:57.000\nAnd this time you're coming to California.\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:58.000\nOkay.\n\n35:58.000 --> 35:59.000\nSo what's different about this year?\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:01.000\nExcept you traveling that distance.\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:04.000\nDid you have an extra hard year at work?\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:07.000\nAnd so you're like, all right, now I'm going to go to the real Disneyland.\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:08.000\nYeah.\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:13.000\nWell, I work a crazy schedule and we just barely ever get to see each other.\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:16.000\nCan we ask what you do without prying?\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:19.000\nAfter asking you to come up on stage?\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:23.000\nDuring the day I clean cars at a rental car company.\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:27.000\nAnd at night I am a PA for a news station.\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:29.000\nOh my God.\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:37.000\nWere you clean cars for the rental company of America's thirst for blood?\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:43.000\nDid you guys enjoy the original Magic Kingdom more or less than the later one in Florida?\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nI got to say the sequel's better.\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:46.000\nThe sequel's better?\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:47.000\nOh yeah.\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:48.000\nIt's a lot bigger.\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:49.000\nYeah.\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:50.000\nA lot more stative.\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:53.000\nI've been to them both, but I'm partial to the Anaheim one because my mom worked there,\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:59.000\nI think in the 60s and my her daughters from her first marriage worked there in the 70s\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:01.000\nand I worked there in the 90s.\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:03.000\nSo I love Disneyland.\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:05.000\nWell, I'm distracted by something though.\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:14.000\nI love Disney and I love Close, but you said you do this thing in the morning and then at night\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:15.000\nyou do this.\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:18.000\nHow do you, when do you sleep?\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:19.000\nNever.\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:20.000\nNever?\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:21.000\nNever.\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:24.000\nAnd so these vacations are more important.\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:28.000\nMy life is a vacation and I work the whole time, but my job is a vacation.\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:33.000\nWhen I drop my rental car off, I'm like, oh, Hannah, what are you doing?\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:38.000\nI think about someone that turns out to be you and I go, oh man, like now I walk away\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:41.000\nand I put, I didn't, my back hurts.\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:45.000\nI don't want to get that straw wrapper and it's like, and then you're like, well, I'm\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:49.000\ngoing to do this for the fall day and then at night I'm going to go to that place.\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:54.000\nSo when you go to a place for vacation, it's incredibly important and probably to her as\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:55.000\nwell.\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:56.000\nYou guys have been good five years.\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:57.000\nThat's longer than I can.\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:59.000\nHannah, what are your work hours, Hannah?\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:01.000\nDo you work a lot too?\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:08.000\nWell, I work Monday through Friday at a life insurance company and then I work at a part-time\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:15.000\njob at Market Basket and then we have a four-year-old who, so that's okay.\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:16.000\nOh, you have a kid together?\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:17.000\nMm-hmm.\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:18.000\nYou guys are busy.\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:19.000\nYeah.\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:20.000\nWe're really busy.\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:21.000\nBut you're not married, right?\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:22.000\nNo.\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:24.000\nOkay, so you have a kid together four years.\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:28.000\nI did want to change that, maybe.\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:34.000\nSo, in front of Mayor, Comptroller, and Harmonians.\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:39.000\nI can authorize this, by the way.\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:41.000\nI'm taking over the show.\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:42.000\nAll right.\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:44.000\nI'll allow it.\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:57.000\nYou're an amazing mother and you are an amazing girlfriend and will you marry me?\n\n38:57.000 --> 39:05.000\nYes, go ahead.\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:17.000\nThe funny, I guess it's not kind of funny.\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:20.000\nI think you're sitting on your mike.\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:24.000\nWe were standing in line at Disney yesterday and she was telling me about how she had a\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:28.380\nthat I had gotten in touch with you and I proposed to her at Harmontown.\n\n39:28.380 --> 39:34.300\nWell, maybe her dream was her phone glowing in the corner of the room because you tweeted\n\n39:34.300 --> 39:35.300\nme two weeks ago.\n\n39:35.300 --> 39:39.500\nI was like, this is a public, take this on the DL.\n\n39:39.500 --> 39:44.140\nYeah, Hannah, not to make this about me, but did I pull that off?\n\n39:44.140 --> 39:47.660\nWere you fooled at all?\n\n39:47.660 --> 39:50.020\nDid that feel organic and then surprising?\n\n39:50.020 --> 39:54.180\nWell, I don't, I don't ever use Twitter.\n\n39:54.180 --> 40:01.100\nOh, good, good, well, I blocked you anyway.\n\n40:01.100 --> 40:07.780\nI never even thought of that, yeah, perfect, just blocker.\n\n40:07.780 --> 40:16.580\nSo, I was hoping that it was going to be at Disney and so all day today, no, no, no, no,\n\n40:16.580 --> 40:19.860\nno, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, wait.\n\n40:19.860 --> 40:20.860\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n40:20.860 --> 40:22.860\nIt's okay, you have the floor.\n\n40:22.860 --> 40:23.860\nNo.\n\n40:23.860 --> 40:24.860\nLike no one's got.\n\n40:24.860 --> 40:32.500\nSo then, a couple days before we left, I had this dream and I woke up and I was like,\n\n40:32.500 --> 40:34.380\nthat's what Pat's going to do.\n\n40:34.380 --> 40:38.060\nI know him and this is, if he's going to do anything, it's going to be this.\n\n40:38.060 --> 40:43.540\nAnd then all day today, I'm pretty sure everybody else knew because I'm getting all these text\n\n40:43.540 --> 40:46.780\nmessages like, so how's your vacation?\n\n40:46.780 --> 40:50.020\nLike what's going on?\n\n40:50.020 --> 40:53.420\nSo you kind of thought maybe that was a chance when you came here tonight that was going\n\n40:53.420 --> 40:54.420\nto happen?\n\n40:54.420 --> 40:56.980\nI would be lying if I was saying I wasn't hoping.\n\n40:56.980 --> 41:01.180\nOh, you saw it, I love it.\n\n41:01.180 --> 41:05.100\nI would be lying if I told you I wasn't crying right now.\n\n41:05.100 --> 41:10.700\nOh, no, that's so cool, you guys are the cutest things in the universe, thank you.\n\n41:10.700 --> 41:16.060\nI think that, I mean, I know that it's enough for you guys that the mayor of Harmontown\n\n41:16.060 --> 41:21.940\nwas present, but I also, why don't we make their, why don't we make their engagement\n\n41:21.940 --> 41:25.540\neven more official by going higher up on the governmental chain and bring out Senator Bernie\n\n41:25.540 --> 41:26.540\nSanders.\n\n41:26.540 --> 41:29.540\nBernie Sanders to make it official.\n\n41:29.540 --> 41:32.540\nSenator Permanente.\n\n41:32.540 --> 41:35.540\nHello, sir.\n\n41:35.540 --> 41:51.460\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders, feel the burn everybody, feel the burn.\n\n41:51.460 --> 42:03.540\nThank you, thank you, Americans, thank you, Dan Harmon, congratulations to the, you\n\n42:03.540 --> 42:07.980\nknow, the thing, this is really, this is a New Hampshire, well look, this is not, this\n\n42:07.980 --> 42:11.180\nis going to be, this is one of the two greatest things that's going to happen in New Hampshire\n\n42:11.180 --> 42:14.140\nthe next six months.\n\n42:14.140 --> 42:23.780\nOh, Senator, your trademark humility is giving away to, oh, it's coming up Bernie.\n\n42:23.780 --> 42:28.780\nYou have certainly since the day, first day you were on my show, I have certainly learned\n\n42:28.780 --> 42:29.780\nyour name.\n\n42:29.780 --> 42:30.780\nThat's right.\n\n42:30.780 --> 42:37.740\nSenator Sanders, we were off to a rocky start, but here we are, you know, you get used to\n\n42:37.740 --> 42:42.380\nit, you get comfortable, I'm not so rough to share a hot tub with, you know.\n\n42:42.380 --> 42:45.420\nI know that you're not, you're not the senator of New Hampshire, but you, because you're\n\n42:45.420 --> 42:49.140\nclose to, the same brick state, Vermont, Vermont is a very close, there's a, there's a very\n\n42:49.140 --> 42:52.660\nlong and contentious border.\n\n42:52.660 --> 42:55.940\nWe have to make sure there's, you know, that there's a balance between the marijuana being\n\n42:55.940 --> 43:00.460\nsmuggled one way and the hacky sacks being smuggled the other way.\n\n43:00.460 --> 43:04.580\nDo you feel that you can weigh in and have any jurisdiction over this new union or this\n\n43:04.580 --> 43:05.580\nnew proposal here?\n\n43:05.580 --> 43:07.340\nOr is that going outside of your own jurisdiction?\n\n43:07.340 --> 43:11.340\nWell, look, I mean, you know, you know, as far as, you know, it would be a nice, you\n\n43:11.340 --> 43:13.860\nknow, little thing, a button on the evening, but of course not.\n\n43:13.860 --> 43:14.860\nNo, I don't.\n\n43:14.860 --> 43:19.260\nI'm the legislative branch, of course.\n\n43:19.260 --> 43:24.060\nI'm a former mayor of Burlington, Vermont, but there's no more justice to the peace\n\n43:24.060 --> 43:25.060\npowers related to it.\n\n43:25.060 --> 43:26.900\nI'm a United States senator.\n\n43:26.900 --> 43:31.260\nThe most I could do is on your honeymoon, I could bring you, you know, a large report\n\n43:31.260 --> 43:39.540\nfrom the 9-Eleven commission and they could step out of it and say, I could share with\n\n43:39.540 --> 43:44.180\nyou, I could share with you parts of the Trans-Pacific partnership if you wanted to read that, you\n\n43:44.180 --> 43:48.620\nknow, before or after the festivities.\n\n43:48.620 --> 43:53.740\nBut that won't in any way actually, uh, uh, uh, uh, matrimonize them anymore.\n\n43:53.740 --> 44:00.900\nNo, but it would inform you as, you know, a newlywed couple about, you know, the, you\n\n44:00.900 --> 44:04.400\nknow, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the political sort of thing.\n\n44:04.400 --> 44:05.400\nOh, okay.\n\n44:05.400 --> 44:07.060\nDo you have any thoughts about?\n\n44:07.060 --> 44:08.060\nYou're married, right?\n\n44:08.060 --> 44:09.060\nI am.\n\n44:09.060 --> 44:14.740\nI am married, like, uh, my, my wife, I think, is named Jane.\n\n44:14.740 --> 44:20.220\nWell, if you're gonna think your wife's name is something that's a great guess.\n\n44:20.220 --> 44:24.780\nI think my wife is Jane and we're happily married for a long time.\n\n44:24.780 --> 44:29.220\nWe just had a great weekend up, you know, for the holiday, we're up at Lake Champlain.\n\n44:29.220 --> 44:32.140\nWe were just, you know, just up there to make a fish.\n\n44:32.140 --> 44:38.860\nMr. Sanders, forgive my impudence, but you are such a guy that's into statistics, facts,\n\n44:38.860 --> 44:42.340\nnumbers, the fact that you're uncertain about your own wife's name.\n\n44:42.340 --> 44:44.660\nNinety percent of the time, yes, continue.\n\n44:44.660 --> 44:50.060\nNinety... I would say 95 percent of the time, you know the statistics about things.\n\n44:50.060 --> 44:51.060\nI'm surprised to know.\n\n44:51.060 --> 44:54.100\nWell, that's, look, you're not looking at the inflation of just the statistics or the\n\n44:54.100 --> 44:55.100\nstatistics.\n\n44:55.100 --> 44:59.140\nIf you look at the statistics, when we started the campaign, it was about 95 percent, but\n\n44:59.140 --> 45:03.660\nthe value of the dollar has gone up since then, so the statistics itself has decreased\n\n45:03.660 --> 45:04.660\ncommit-sortly.\n\n45:04.660 --> 45:08.340\nI'm going to Google, while you're, you go on, I'm going to Google your wife's name and\n\n45:08.340 --> 45:09.340\nsee what happens.\n\n45:09.340 --> 45:10.340\nFair enough.\n\n45:10.340 --> 45:15.980\nLook, I would prefer, I would prefer if you searched with a non-major corporate search\n\n45:15.980 --> 45:22.980\nengine, besides Google, maybe try duck-duck-go, duck-duck-go, duck-duck-go, duck-duck-go,\n\n45:22.980 --> 45:33.980\nopen source, look, get up, hop on a Linux and look it up with duck-duck-go.\n\n45:33.980 --> 45:37.980\nI didn't even hit Mr. Sanders.\n\n45:37.980 --> 45:41.980\nHer name is Jane, you are correct.\n\n45:41.980 --> 45:46.860\nFeel the burn, feel the burn.\n\n45:46.860 --> 45:50.500\nI just want to check in with our newly engaged couple and make sure, I don't know, I kind\n\n45:50.500 --> 45:53.980\nof, I thought, are you guys comfortable up here?\n\n45:53.980 --> 45:57.300\nYeah, but I don't want to, like, be one of those people that overstays their welcome.\n\n45:57.300 --> 45:58.300\nNo, no, no.\n\n45:58.300 --> 46:00.260\nI want to make something very important.\n\n46:00.260 --> 46:04.140\nYou're not, you're a citizen of the state of New Hampshire, but you're also a working\n\n46:04.140 --> 46:05.140\nclass American.\n\n46:05.140 --> 46:08.980\nYeah, please let the guy, it's about time that people like you got a chance.\n\n46:08.980 --> 46:09.980\nYeah.\n\n46:09.980 --> 46:15.980\nThank you, if you don't mind, Dan, do you mind if I ask a couple of questions?\n\n46:15.980 --> 46:18.980\nAbsolutely, that would make me feel better about keeping them up here.\n\n46:18.980 --> 46:19.980\nSure.\n\n46:19.980 --> 46:20.980\nWhat was your name?\n\n46:20.980 --> 46:21.980\nPat.\n\n46:21.980 --> 46:22.980\nPat.\n\n46:22.980 --> 46:23.980\nWell, that sounded like a pattern.\n\n46:23.980 --> 46:25.980\nThat doesn't happen at the same time.\n\n46:25.980 --> 46:27.980\nBut it's patterned, Pat.\n\n46:27.980 --> 46:28.980\nYes.\n\n46:28.980 --> 46:29.980\nGood.\n\n46:29.980 --> 46:30.980\nOkay, so what do you know?\n\n46:30.980 --> 46:31.980\nYou're in New Hampshire, what do you know?\n\n46:31.980 --> 46:32.980\nAre you about to do a magic trick?\n\n46:32.980 --> 46:33.980\nNope.\n\n46:33.980 --> 46:36.980\nIt seems I have nothing up my sleeves.\n\n46:36.980 --> 46:38.980\nThey're rolled up.\n\n46:38.980 --> 46:42.980\nNope, except an emergency set of sleeves that can come down and be rolled up if I need\n\n46:42.980 --> 46:43.980\nto demonstrate.\n\n46:43.980 --> 46:49.980\nSo, Hannah and Pat, what do you know?\n\n46:49.980 --> 46:56.980\nSorry, you know, I do gargle milk duds before I go in front of an audience.\n\n46:56.980 --> 46:59.980\nThat sounds comical to anyone.\n\n46:59.980 --> 47:01.980\nWhat is your profession?\n\n47:01.980 --> 47:02.980\nDo you have one?\n\n47:02.980 --> 47:05.980\nCrafts and services?\n\n47:05.980 --> 47:08.780\nI work at a call center for a life insurance company.\n\n47:08.780 --> 47:09.780\nThat's fantastic.\n\n47:09.780 --> 47:14.780\nYou work at a call center, that's one of the few industries that's still around in the\n\n47:14.780 --> 47:15.780\ncountry.\n\n47:15.780 --> 47:16.780\nAnd Pat, what do you do?\n\n47:16.780 --> 47:17.780\nI clean cars during the day.\n\n47:17.780 --> 47:18.780\nThat's fine.\n\n47:18.780 --> 47:19.780\nI pee at night.\n\n47:19.780 --> 47:20.780\nRight.\n\n47:20.780 --> 47:21.780\nAnd you want it night?\n\n47:21.780 --> 47:22.780\nI'm a PA at a news station.\n\n47:22.780 --> 47:23.780\nSure, yes, good.\n\n47:23.780 --> 47:30.780\nAt a news station, you're involved in small local media, and you're also manual labor,\n\n47:30.780 --> 47:36.780\ncontributing valuable services in both case, call center, labor, for an average couple.\n\n47:36.780 --> 47:39.780\nAn average couple like you, newly wed in America.\n\n47:39.780 --> 47:48.780\nMy tax plan would increase your take home pay by over 400% on top while at the same time\n\n47:48.780 --> 47:52.780\nrendering it such that your employers have to pay for your health care and have to pay\n\n47:52.780 --> 47:53.780\nsomething in tax.\n\n47:53.780 --> 47:55.780\nThat's just, I think, that's normal insane.\n\n47:55.780 --> 47:57.780\nThat's all I think.\n\n47:57.780 --> 48:02.780\nAnd not, look, nope, that wasn't, that wasn't there.\n\n48:02.780 --> 48:06.780\nTrust me, stay with me, the rhythm wasn't there.\n\n48:06.780 --> 48:11.780\nI know the cadence of a forced applause, and that wasn't it.\n\n48:11.780 --> 48:18.780\nIf I want to force on a crowd to applaud, all I have to do is continue talking at the\n\n48:18.780 --> 48:24.780\nsame volume and pointing, and eventually the people will be there to join me.\n\n48:24.780 --> 48:26.780\nThank you.\n\n48:26.780 --> 48:29.780\nAll right, well, what?\n\n48:29.780 --> 48:32.780\nHe's so much more dynamic in person.\n\n48:32.780 --> 48:39.780\nI'm going to try to strike a balance between, I think our happy couple probably maybe wants\n\n48:39.780 --> 48:43.780\nto be out of the spotlight and just smile and hold hands and watch the rest of the show,\n\n48:43.780 --> 48:44.780\nright?\n\n48:44.780 --> 48:48.780\nI think Dan, maybe as mayor of Harmontown, since they chose to propose here, maybe they\n\n48:48.780 --> 48:53.780\nget up and can you do some sort of formal, like maybe we'll make up a new ritual where\n\n48:53.780 --> 48:57.780\nyou kind of bind them in some sort of legally Harmontownian fashion?\n\n48:57.780 --> 48:59.780\nIt'll be our big, fat, Harmontown engagement.\n\n48:59.780 --> 49:00.780\nYeah, yeah.\n\n49:00.780 --> 49:01.780\nLook, you know what?\n\n49:01.780 --> 49:02.780\nI could do a thing.\n\n49:02.780 --> 49:05.780\nI could do a, you know, backup singing or something.\n\n49:05.780 --> 49:06.780\nOkay.\n\n49:06.780 --> 49:07.780\nYeah, yeah.\n\n49:07.780 --> 49:13.780\nOkay, well, okay, well then, yeah, okay, so is there like a, is there like a slower,\n\n49:13.780 --> 49:17.780\nis there like, I could do like a slower, like, nuptial rap.\n\n49:17.780 --> 49:19.780\nAnd then we'll have Bernie Sanders.\n\n49:19.780 --> 49:26.780\nAnd then Bernie, you do the Vincent Price bridge, you know, like, you know, the spoken word.\n\n49:26.780 --> 49:27.780\nI'm very familiar.\n\n49:27.780 --> 49:28.780\nSure.\n\n49:28.780 --> 49:29.780\nYou're talking about thriller.\n\n49:29.780 --> 49:30.780\nYes.\n\n49:30.780 --> 49:31.780\nYeah.\n\n49:31.780 --> 49:32.780\nYeah.\n\n49:32.780 --> 49:33.780\nAll right.\n\n49:33.780 --> 49:34.780\nYo.\n\n49:34.780 --> 49:36.780\nAnd this made it rhyme because it's going to be from, from the heart.\n\n49:36.780 --> 49:37.780\nThe heart.\n\n49:37.780 --> 49:38.780\nFrom the brain.\n\n49:38.780 --> 49:39.780\nYeah.\n\n49:39.780 --> 49:40.780\nYo.\n\n49:40.780 --> 49:45.780\nProposal, more important than marriage because it's the stage of marriage where marriage\n\n49:45.780 --> 49:47.780\nis still an option.\n\n49:47.780 --> 49:56.780\n800% of tax receipts year on year come from middle and working classes.\n\n49:56.780 --> 49:58.780\nAnd I think that has to change.\n\n49:58.780 --> 49:59.780\nYeah.\n\n49:59.780 --> 50:00.780\nYeah.\n\n50:00.780 --> 50:01.780\nYeah.\n\n50:01.780 --> 50:02.780\nYeah.\n\n50:02.780 --> 50:05.780\nOne life becoming two, but not quite yet.\n\n50:05.780 --> 50:08.780\nFor now, right now, you're happy.\n\n50:08.780 --> 50:14.780\nThere's going to be a big ceremony.\n\n50:14.780 --> 50:19.780\nOne of the two of you is going to, is going to feel like you're doing too much or too\n\n50:19.780 --> 50:20.780\nlittle.\n\n50:20.780 --> 50:22.780\nAnd there will be fights.\n\n50:22.780 --> 50:29.780\nIn my belief, if the so-called greatest nation in the world cannot clothe and feed children\n\n50:29.780 --> 50:34.780\nand elderly, then it cannot call itself the greatest nation in the world until it makes\n\n50:34.780 --> 50:36.780\nthose things happen in this country.\n\n50:36.780 --> 50:42.780\nBut we live on a planet devoid of faith and everybody thinks that the eternity is a race\n\n50:42.780 --> 50:44.780\nand that you should be atheistic and cynical.\n\n50:44.780 --> 50:51.780\nAnd they don't know that you can win though by joining with someone else in the second\n\n50:51.780 --> 50:52.780\nhalf of life.\n\n50:52.780 --> 50:57.780\nI don't believe that monogamy is something that was not meant to be.\n\n50:57.780 --> 51:03.780\nI think that's something that was made up by parcheeks in Dubai.\n\n51:03.780 --> 51:04.780\nWhy?\n\n51:04.780 --> 51:09.780\nI'm a racist guy.\n\n51:09.780 --> 51:10.780\nPat and Hannah, everybody.\n\n51:10.780 --> 51:11.780\nPat and Hannah.\n\n51:11.780 --> 51:12.780\nThank you so much.\n\n51:12.780 --> 51:13.780\nThank you very much.\n\n51:13.780 --> 51:14.780\nThank you.\n\n51:14.780 --> 51:15.780\nBless this union.\n\n51:15.780 --> 51:16.780\nThank you.\n\n51:16.780 --> 51:17.780\nThank you.\n\n51:17.780 --> 51:32.780\nMay your happiness increase over 250% using real inflation-adjusted real dollars.\n\n51:32.780 --> 51:33.780\nPat and Hannah.\n\n51:33.780 --> 51:43.780\nThat's Harmontown's first wedding proposal on stage.\n\n51:43.780 --> 51:47.780\nSanctified by the mayor and by the senator from Vermont.\n\n51:47.780 --> 51:48.780\nIn front of the Vermont.\n\n51:48.780 --> 51:53.780\nLook, you know, when I was mayor of Burlington, Vermont, there were some wild times back there.\n\n51:53.780 --> 51:57.780\nI'm the first person to pronounce actually a marriage of four people who had just had\n\n51:57.780 --> 51:59.780\na key party together.\n\n51:59.780 --> 52:00.780\nOh.\n\n52:00.780 --> 52:02.780\nThose are simpler times.\n\n52:02.780 --> 52:03.780\nYeah.\n\n52:03.780 --> 52:06.780\nI was direct tweeting with Pat before the show.\n\n52:06.780 --> 52:08.780\nAnd at one point he was like, I'm so fucking nervous.\n\n52:08.780 --> 52:09.780\nI don't tweet.\n\n52:09.780 --> 52:10.780\nLook, you should know this about me.\n\n52:10.780 --> 52:13.780\nNot only do I not tweet, I do not have an email server.\n\n52:13.780 --> 52:17.780\nSo there's no way that there could be, you know, the Hillary thing.\n\n52:17.780 --> 52:23.780\nI have all of my communications printed out on a dot matrix printer and handed it to me\n\n52:23.780 --> 52:27.780\nin a nice hemp bound sort of ledger.\n\n52:27.780 --> 52:32.780\nI'd say in the beginning of the pilot for the new Battlestar Galactica, when, you know,\n\n52:32.780 --> 52:36.780\nthe adama is like giving the tour and going like, it's all vacuum tubes and none of it\n\n52:36.780 --> 52:39.780\ntook them to the internet because, you know, robots tried to murder us.\n\n52:39.780 --> 52:40.780\nNo, that's true.\n\n52:40.780 --> 52:42.780\nI thought I had the program I actually saw.\n\n52:42.780 --> 52:43.780\nI had that.\n\n52:43.780 --> 52:45.780\nI watched it on VHS.\n\n52:45.780 --> 52:50.780\nI do all my binge washing on either VHS or if I could get it beta, but you can't always\n\n52:50.780 --> 52:51.780\nget it anymore.\n\n52:51.780 --> 52:56.780\nAnd I watch, I did watch a little Battlestar Galactica and I find it inspirational.\n\n52:56.780 --> 53:00.780\nIf I'm elected president and there's not an immediate fascist coup d'etat that sort of\n\n53:00.780 --> 53:03.780\ntakes me out of power.\n\n53:03.780 --> 53:08.780\nSenator Sanders, I promise you that I will retrofit the United States military along the\n\n53:08.780 --> 53:17.780\nlines of Battlestar Galactica so that it will, it will not be connected to any sort of internet\n\n53:17.780 --> 53:22.780\nand they will also be suspenseful who done it every time.\n\n53:22.780 --> 53:23.780\nFirst day in office.\n\n53:23.780 --> 53:24.780\nShoot.\n\n53:24.780 --> 53:27.780\nYour first day in office if you're elected president of the United States.\n\n53:27.780 --> 53:28.780\nThank you.\n\n53:28.780 --> 53:29.780\nWhat is the first?\n\n53:29.780 --> 53:30.780\nI'm sorry.\n\n53:30.780 --> 53:31.780\nI'm sorry.\n\n53:31.780 --> 53:33.780\nWe should make it clear he doesn't have that authority.\n\n53:33.780 --> 53:34.780\nI don't know.\n\n53:34.780 --> 53:35.780\nIt's a hypothetical.\n\n53:35.780 --> 53:39.780\nOh, I think that everybody, look, I believe that everybody is like Alan Watts says, you\n\n53:39.780 --> 53:43.780\nknow, a shining light that sort of gets to change the universe a little bit at a time.\n\n53:43.780 --> 53:45.780\nSo if he says it, I'm halfway there.\n\n53:45.780 --> 53:46.780\nOkay.\n\n53:46.780 --> 53:47.780\nAll right.\n\n53:47.780 --> 53:51.780\nLet's say your first day in office, what's the first piece of legislation you put into\n\n53:51.780 --> 53:54.780\nthe first 24 hours behind?\n\n53:54.780 --> 53:56.780\nI think you're jumping the gun.\n\n53:56.780 --> 54:02.780\nIf I may respectfully, Jeffrey, if I may respectfully disagree, I don't think the first 24 hours\n\n54:02.780 --> 54:05.780\nin office are going to be spent passing any legislation.\n\n54:05.780 --> 54:12.780\nI think it's going to be dedicated to a drum circle right in the Rose Garden.\n\n54:12.780 --> 54:15.780\nWe're getting people from Venice Beach, from Miami Beach.\n\n54:15.780 --> 54:18.780\nWe're getting all the best ready worldwide drum circle.\n\n54:18.780 --> 54:21.780\nThey're going to be welcome and we're going to throw that far.\n\n54:21.780 --> 54:22.780\nI don't know.\n\n54:22.780 --> 54:23.780\nWe'll see what to our palms get tired.\n\n54:23.780 --> 54:24.780\nWas there be hacky sacking?\n\n54:24.780 --> 54:25.780\nWell, any hacky sacks?\n\n54:25.780 --> 54:26.780\nThere will be hacky sacks.\n\n54:26.780 --> 54:31.780\nLook, you will be able to toss anything around at a small velocity off of your ankles.\n\n54:31.780 --> 54:37.780\nDon't you think it's kind of, isn't it kind of weird from a strange cosmic objective standpoint\n\n54:37.780 --> 54:41.780\nthat actually that is your demographic?\n\n54:41.780 --> 54:48.620\nThat's how fucked up and weird our world is, is that the guy that looks the most like\n\n54:48.620 --> 54:49.620\nour dad.\n\n54:49.620 --> 54:51.620\nThe guy that, the guy, hold on a second look.\n\n54:51.620 --> 54:53.620\nI hope you're going to say something like that.\n\n54:53.620 --> 54:54.620\nI need to respond.\n\n54:54.620 --> 54:55.620\nI don't look.\n\n54:55.620 --> 54:57.620\nI can't have an attack on my character like that.\n\n54:57.620 --> 54:58.620\nNo, no.\n\n54:58.620 --> 55:01.620\nIf you're going to say that, I need to cite as a reference, teach your children well,\n\n55:01.620 --> 55:04.620\nthe Crosby Stills of National Young Song, that kind of dad, you know.\n\n55:04.620 --> 55:05.620\nNo, yeah.\n\n55:05.620 --> 55:06.620\nI mean, I was like, I just, I do.\n\n55:06.620 --> 55:08.620\nThe children well.\n\n55:08.620 --> 55:16.620\nThe, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the archetype of the, of the clip on tie rolled\n\n55:16.620 --> 55:17.620\nup sleeves.\n\n55:17.620 --> 55:19.620\nI look that that would be counterculture now.\n\n55:19.620 --> 55:24.620\nI look like I'm made from crystallized college professor essence.\n\n55:24.620 --> 55:33.620\nI look like I'm almost fueled by the mockery of children sitting in a college class taking\n\n55:33.620 --> 55:34.620\nnotes.\n\n55:34.620 --> 55:36.620\nSo I'm compassionate on the drawings.\n\n55:36.620 --> 55:43.620\nI'm well aware that I look like I'm running for president of the Muppet Show.\n\n55:43.620 --> 55:48.620\nBut I want to make something very clear.\n\n55:48.620 --> 55:51.620\nI feel like I'm very York.\n\n55:51.620 --> 55:53.620\nBernie, Bernie.\n\n55:53.620 --> 55:54.620\nYep.\n\n55:54.620 --> 55:55.620\nWhy not?\n\n55:55.620 --> 55:57.620\nLet's say, let's go again.\n\n55:57.620 --> 55:59.620\nCrossfire time.\n\n55:59.620 --> 56:00.620\nOkay.\n\n56:00.620 --> 56:05.620\nLet's say you, let's say you served two successful terms as president of the United States.\n\n56:05.620 --> 56:06.620\nThat's fantastic.\n\n56:06.620 --> 56:08.620\n60, 70 years from now.\n\n56:08.620 --> 56:16.620\nAny statue that's made of me is going to be made of vegan macaroni, condensed in a war\n\n56:16.620 --> 56:18.620\nformat using soil milk, soy milk.\n\n56:18.620 --> 56:22.620\nAnd there's something that is a sustainable kind of statue that might wear down in the\n\n56:22.620 --> 56:25.620\nrain after about 50 years, but it'll look nice.\n\n56:25.620 --> 56:30.620\nNow there's talk of putting a woman, I believe in the $10 bill.\n\n56:30.620 --> 56:34.620\nWhat, what, uh, denomination of currency would you like to see yourself on?\n\n56:34.620 --> 56:38.620\nOr if not you, who else would you like to see on money in your place?\n\n56:38.620 --> 56:40.620\nLike, look, that's, that's a fine question.\n\n56:40.620 --> 56:43.620\nI don't want my face on any currency.\n\n56:43.620 --> 56:46.620\nI actually believe that the Federal Reserve should be audited.\n\n56:46.620 --> 56:49.620\nI'm the only candidate saying that besides Rand Paul.\n\n56:49.620 --> 56:52.620\nAnd he has as much of a chance as a bucket of piss.\n\n56:52.620 --> 56:57.620\nI believe that the Federal Reserve should be audited.\n\n56:57.620 --> 56:58.620\nI think that's fair.\n\n56:58.620 --> 57:03.620\nAnd so I don't want my face on anything except social security checks that people receive.\n\n57:03.620 --> 57:06.620\nSocial security and Medicare checks.\n\n57:06.620 --> 57:08.620\nI want to have a big, just a birdie face.\n\n57:08.620 --> 57:09.620\nThat's like, there you are.\n\n57:09.620 --> 57:10.620\nYou got it.\n\n57:10.620 --> 57:12.620\nSenator, Senator, I'm sorry.\n\n57:12.620 --> 57:17.620\nI know how you interpret this, but they're asking me from the control room if you'll\n\n57:17.620 --> 57:19.620\nsit closer to me so that we both fit.\n\n57:19.620 --> 57:20.620\nWas it about a stage picture?\n\n57:20.620 --> 57:21.620\nWho's complaining?\n\n57:21.620 --> 57:22.620\nWho's complaining?\n\n57:22.620 --> 57:24.620\nI think it's just corporate America.\n\n57:24.620 --> 57:27.620\nYou're streaming this online somewhere?\n\n57:27.620 --> 57:28.620\nYeah.\n\n57:28.620 --> 57:29.620\nAnd they're complaining.\n\n57:29.620 --> 57:31.620\nThey're all there going, why isn't it better for me?\n\n57:31.620 --> 57:35.620\nHow come I have to either look at Senator Sanders or Dan Harmon?\n\n57:35.620 --> 57:37.620\nHow come I can't look at both of them?\n\n57:37.620 --> 57:38.620\nThat's fair.\n\n57:38.620 --> 57:39.620\nThat's fair.\n\n57:39.620 --> 57:40.620\nLook, why not?\n\n57:40.620 --> 57:41.620\nDo you want me to come down too?\n\n57:41.620 --> 57:44.620\nOr do you want to come down too?\n\n57:44.620 --> 57:45.620\nOr maybe we both move.\n\n57:45.620 --> 57:49.620\nOr do you want to do like a chess move where we like castle?\n\n57:49.620 --> 57:53.620\nLet this be my official endorsement of you as a presidential candidate.\n\n57:53.620 --> 57:55.620\nI'm going to come down to where you are.\n\n57:55.620 --> 57:56.620\nThat's fantastic.\n\n57:56.620 --> 57:58.620\nAnd look, see, he moves too.\n\n57:58.620 --> 58:00.620\nAnd then like a rock, I just go around like this.\n\n58:00.620 --> 58:02.620\nOh, no.\n\n58:02.620 --> 58:04.620\nChess humor.\n\n58:04.620 --> 58:05.620\nOkay.\n\n58:05.620 --> 58:06.620\nAll right.\n\n58:06.620 --> 58:10.620\nWell, I think this is what people are afraid will happen metaphorically if we do elect\n\n58:10.620 --> 58:11.620\nyou.\n\n58:11.620 --> 58:14.620\nEverything will change and then everything will just be different for no reason.\n\n58:14.620 --> 58:16.620\nI am radically going to change everything.\n\n58:16.620 --> 58:19.620\nStarting with the podcast.\n\n58:19.620 --> 58:21.620\nBut look, see, it's comfortable.\n\n58:21.620 --> 58:22.620\nIs this actually better?\n\n58:22.620 --> 58:24.620\nWhoever said, is this okay?\n\n58:24.620 --> 58:28.620\nYes, see, this is a socialist solution and you were shocked at first.\n\n58:28.620 --> 58:31.620\nBut then they got a thumbs up for the people of the both.\n\n58:31.620 --> 58:32.620\nIt works.\n\n58:32.620 --> 58:35.620\nAll we need is the cooperation from most of the people in the room.\n\n58:35.620 --> 58:36.620\nAnd that's fine.\n\n58:36.620 --> 58:41.620\nWhy is everybody so upset about the socialism thing?\n\n58:41.620 --> 58:43.620\nAre you are you on Adderall right now?\n\n58:43.620 --> 58:44.620\nWhat's going on?\n\n58:44.620 --> 58:50.620\nI mean, I am on prescription Adderall that I got from Canada because it's easier to get\n\n58:50.620 --> 58:55.620\ndrugs in Canada, which I don't think is fair for seniors.\n\n58:55.620 --> 58:59.620\nAll right, we're not a lot of seniors in the room.\n\n58:59.620 --> 59:01.620\nBlah, blah, blah, Pearl Jam.\n\n59:01.620 --> 59:05.620\nIs that better?\n\n59:05.620 --> 59:09.620\nThey love Pearl Jam.\n\n59:09.620 --> 59:10.620\nI'm racking up some endorsements.\n\n59:10.620 --> 59:11.620\nI know we're friends.\n\n59:11.620 --> 59:15.620\nI'm not going to push you or anything, but I am getting some endorsements.\n\n59:15.620 --> 59:18.620\nAnd they say Jell-O Biafra.\n\n59:18.620 --> 59:19.620\nThat's not a joke.\n\n59:19.620 --> 59:22.620\nJell-O Biafra at Dorspeak.\n\n59:22.620 --> 59:25.620\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers, all of them, I got all of them.\n\n59:25.620 --> 59:28.620\nThey came into the office with the shirts off and everything.\n\n59:28.620 --> 59:30.620\nDo you really have Jell-O?\n\n59:30.620 --> 59:32.620\nYup, Jell-O Biafra at Dorspeak.\n\n59:32.620 --> 59:36.620\nAlso, Blind Mellon is the first endorsement from beyond the grave.\n\n59:36.620 --> 59:40.620\nI was endorsed by Blind Mellon.\n\n59:40.620 --> 59:45.620\nSpeaking of that, so if you heard of this, is his name Paul Lessig?\n\n59:45.620 --> 59:46.620\nIs that the name of the guy?\n\n59:46.620 --> 59:47.620\nSomebody tweeted me about that.\n\n59:47.620 --> 59:49.620\nYup, you know about Paul Lessig.\n\n59:49.620 --> 59:53.620\nLook, and I'm not going to, I don't want to get personal, but Paul Lessig is, you know, he's a,\n\n59:53.620 --> 59:56.620\nhe's running a care that they say that's a protest currency.\n\n59:56.620 --> 01:00:00.620\nAnd all he wants to do is he wants to say, well, change the election laws and it'll resign.\n\n01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:01.620\nWhat are those like?\n\n01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:03.620\nBut I think he wants you as his vice-president.\n\n01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:05.620\nLook, I'm sorry, pal.\n\n01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:07.620\nThat ain't going to happen.\n\n01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:10.620\nAll right, birds on top.\n\n01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:17.620\nI, I ain't taking second fiddle for nobody besides David Crosby, okay?\n\n01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:21.620\nLook, look, Lawrence Lessig is saying he's going to run for president.\n\n01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:25.620\nYou know, if he's elected, he resigns after one day or whatever when he does his thing.\n\n01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:30.620\nI think if he gets it, he becomes a Robespierre, guillotine, don't do it.\n\n01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:32.620\nIt has happened.\n\n01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:33.620\nI mean, what did we elect Napoleon?\n\n01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:35.620\nAnd then he crowned himself.\n\n01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:38.620\nI think we only, I think we only wanted him to defend the best deal.\n\n01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:40.620\nActually, it's an afternoon.\n\n01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:41.620\nIt's important to notice.\n\n01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:44.620\nWe were like, yeah, and then you'll check out at five and he's like, ah, no problem.\n\n01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:45.620\nIt's not going to blue.\n\n01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:48.620\nAnd we're like, all right, I'm going to go to bed then to defend that best deal.\n\n01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:50.620\nAnd then he's like, where are you?\n\n01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:51.620\nI hear cannons.\n\n01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:53.620\nSomebody invented a whiff of grape shot.\n\n01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:55.620\nLook, that's not far off.\n\n01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:56.620\nThat's not far off.\n\n01:00:56.620 --> 01:01:02.620\nI've actually studied the game Stratigo, which is sort of based on Napoleon.\n\n01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:03.620\nYeah.\n\n01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:05.620\nAnd that's, look, I studied it in detail.\n\n01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:11.620\nI base all my stuff on the worst episodes of Sliders.\n\n01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:16.620\nAll my history knowledge comes from CW Sci-Fi original.\n\n01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:22.620\nI vividly remember the CBS miniseries, Napoleon and Josephine starring Amon de Sante as Napoleon.\n\n01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:28.620\nAnd I think when I engage, you know, the foreign policy on them, you know, out there, it's going to, you know,\n\n01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:32.620\nWhat do you think Napoleon and his generals had wrong at Waterloo?\n\n01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:34.620\nAnd what do you think the repercussions of that were for France?\n\n01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:40.620\nWell, I don't think, you know, I don't think they should have gone on the water, you know.\n\n01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:45.620\nCornwallis was out there, right, in boats.\n\n01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:46.620\nThat's close.\n\n01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:47.620\nWith Churchill.\n\n01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:48.620\nYeah.\n\n01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:50.620\nThat's like, he was triangulated.\n\n01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:52.620\nBetween Cornwallis and Winston Churchill.\n\n01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:53.620\nYeah.\n\n01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:56.620\nSpeak softly and travel in time.\n\n01:01:56.620 --> 01:02:04.620\nWas Winston Churchill's lesser known saying, which turned out to be the real reason he has all the famous quotes?\n\n01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:07.620\nSo to speak softly was from whom?\n\n01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:11.620\nWinston Churchill pretends that that FDR said that.\n\n01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:13.620\nYou mean Teddy Roosevelt?\n\n01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:19.620\nThat's also another, depending on what timeline you're living in.\n\n01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:24.620\nWinston Churchill, we're all, well, first of all, we're all light.\n\n01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:31.620\nFun fact, by the way, fun fact, I will be the first president since Teddy Roosevelt to wear glasses full time.\n\n01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:32.620\nOh.\n\n01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:33.620\nIs that right?\n\n01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:38.620\nYep, I've led, look, part of the reason I'm running is for just little trivia things like that.\n\n01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:42.620\nAlso, the second president sends him to have been at Abe Lincoln's inauguration.\n\n01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:43.620\nCome on, it's an old joke.\n\n01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:44.620\nThat's fair.\n\n01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:48.620\nNo, I was at his first inauguration, not the second one.\n\n01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:53.620\nI didn't, I wasn't some supporter for that time.\n\n01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:56.620\nSo, okay, all right, socialism.\n\n01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:57.620\nYep, shirts.\n\n01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:58.620\nSure.\n\n01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:09.620\nTies, got it, sleeves, 9-11, it's 9-11 right now.\n\n01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:11.620\nI can't control it sometimes.\n\n01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:12.620\nIt just does this.\n\n01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:14.620\nYou didn't orchestrate 9-11, did you?\n\n01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:15.620\nNope.\n\n01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:17.620\nI did, nope, I certainly did not.\n\n01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:19.620\nThat was, you know, the other guys.\n\n01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:20.620\nI thought you were blessing us.\n\n01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:22.620\nI thought you were giving us like absolution.\n\n01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:29.620\nAnd all it does is raise your contribution to Social Security funds a little bit.\n\n01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:31.620\nThat's how you use your Nassparatu powers.\n\n01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:33.620\nI'm lowering taxes in the app.\n\n01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:36.620\nJust to lower our taxes or raise them.\n\n01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:40.620\nI always went, yeah, I mean, like, how much, how much, you saw that documentary and said,\n\n01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:44.620\nwe only need $75,000 a year to be happy, and then beyond that, we're already happy,\n\n01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:46.620\nand it doesn't fucking matter.\n\n01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:48.620\nRich people are happier than poor people.\n\n01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:55.620\nLook, I'm a little confused because I have watched every documentary on Netflix.\n\n01:03:55.620 --> 01:04:01.620\nNot only have I watched every documentary on Netflix, and I have them print it out.\n\n01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:07.620\nI don't believe in using email service, so I have Netflix programs print it out,\n\n01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:11.620\nand I have them fanned like a little cartoon book.\n\n01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:16.620\nAnd that's how I watch every program, and then I have staffers read the parts,\n\n01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:23.620\nand they just, they read them, you know, like sitting around reading Shakespeare or something.\n\n01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:25.620\nBut you haven't seen the one I'm talking about?\n\n01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:26.620\nI don't look.\n\n01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:29.620\nI just go along with my information on the Netflix service.\n\n01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:32.620\nSo what I do is I print it out, like you're watching, you know, Stainbow Willie,\n\n01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:35.620\nlike you were talking about earlier, a little cartoon thing.\n\n01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:38.620\nThere's a kind of, obviously you would agree with this because you know,\n\n01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:40.620\nthere's some kind of pop science kind of thing.\n\n01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:45.620\nIt's, you know, there's been studies put into it and how scientifically studies be.\n\n01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:50.620\nI think that there is a cap, an absolute cap, on the amount of like wealth\n\n01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:54.620\nthat actually does impact your emotional state.\n\n01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:58.620\nAnd that beyond a certain amount, and it's relative to, let's say,\n\n01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:03.620\nwhatever year this study was done, and in American dollars,\n\n01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:09.620\nthat it equivalates, is that a word, to a $75,000 a year salary.\n\n01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:11.620\nAnd then over that you're not going to be getting better.\n\n01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:12.620\nYou're not going to get happier.\n\n01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:13.620\nYou're going to have more money.\n\n01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:14.620\nYou're going to have a bidet.\n\n01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:15.620\nYou're going to, yeah.\n\n01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:17.620\nLook, but you're not going to get happier.\n\n01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:18.620\nIt is my belief.\n\n01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:24.620\nIt is my firm belief that I'm not here to tell people how much money\n\n01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:25.620\nthey should make.\n\n01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:26.620\nI'm not a communist.\n\n01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:27.620\nI want to make that clear.\n\n01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:28.620\nI'm a socialist.\n\n01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:32.620\nI don't, it's not my job to go, you know, open up your checkbook\n\n01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:33.620\nand say, that's too much.\n\n01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:36.620\nYou have not enough at all, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:38.620\nThat would be an amazing cereal commercial, though.\n\n01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:41.620\nLike, if you were like, I can't.\n\n01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:44.620\nI got those for the only cereal, and then you come in and go,\n\n01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:46.620\nhey, kids, you shouldn't have that much.\n\n01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:47.620\nYou should have this much.\n\n01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:49.620\nLook, that's fine, but I won't take any money for the commercial.\n\n01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:55.620\nAnd also, the only cereal I endorse is cashing.\n\n01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:59.620\nBut I do want to say, look, I think if there's an appropriate amount\n\n01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:03.620\nof money that somebody should have, I don't think it begins with a B,\n\n01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:04.620\nas in billion.\n\n01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:07.620\nYou know what I'm talking about?\n\n01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:10.620\nAnd I think if you are making billions of dollars,\n\n01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:12.620\nI think that you should pay something in taxes.\n\n01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:15.620\nYour cheapskate, bastards.\n\n01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:17.620\nBy the way, I want to point this out.\n\n01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:19.620\nI'm looking forward to the general election.\n\n01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:23.620\nI think that me versus Donald Trump is the best possible election\n\n01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:26.620\nyou can have.\n\n01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:29.620\nWe're going to, look, if we do it, I want to have at least four debates,\n\n01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:31.620\nfour debates in each region of the country,\n\n01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:37.620\nand I also want to have a debate between just our hair\n\n01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:40.620\nas a tiebreaker.\n\n01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:42.620\nThat would be amazing.\n\n01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:44.620\nBy the way, he's from Queens.\n\n01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:45.620\nYou know that.\n\n01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:46.620\nI'm from Brooklyn.\n\n01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:47.620\nOh, shit.\n\n01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:53.620\nIt would be, look, it's like the Oklahoma and Texas of New York.\n\n01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:55.620\nThat look, I do have a plan, by the way,\n\n01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:57.620\nmentioning Texas as a side note.\n\n01:06:57.620 --> 01:07:00.620\nI think for global warming, I think my solution is I want to\n\n01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:05.620\nturn Texas into a rainforest.\n\n01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:09.620\nBecause all of those sad statistics and things talk,\n\n01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:11.620\nthey always use Texas as a size scale.\n\n01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:13.620\nSure, they refer to what's a bigger size than Texas.\n\n01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:15.620\nWhy not? Just go for it.\n\n01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:17.620\nWe know how much we need.\n\n01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:19.620\nIf you need Austin, we can have it cleared out,\n\n01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:22.620\nand the rest of it's just rain for us.\n\n01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:26.620\nBut look, if we're having an election, a Queens, Brooklyn election,\n\n01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:29.620\nI'm calling this the G-Trade election.\n\n01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:31.620\nIt's going to be, that's right.\n\n01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:32.620\nThat's a New York bit.\n\n01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:35.620\nBy coastal enough, look, I'm going there in a couple of weeks,\n\n01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:38.620\nI've got to prep for the material.\n\n01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:42.620\nIt's going to be long, winding, hot, and too expensive,\n\n01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:44.620\nand it'll break down, but eventually, you know,\n\n01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:48.620\nyou've got stuck in the middle of the East River.\n\n01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:51.620\nAh, the G-Train. Just like the G-Train.\n\n01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:54.620\nYup, that's the best I could, what do you want, the PQA?\n\n01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:56.620\nI don't know.\n\n01:07:56.620 --> 01:08:01.620\nI still say Houston Street.\n\n01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:04.620\nOh, you're lucky I'm not a fighter anymore.\n\n01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:05.620\nWow.\n\n01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:08.620\nThat's right, you were golden gloves when you were younger, right?\n\n01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:12.620\nLook, I used to do Muay Thai.\n\n01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:18.620\nI played rugby, I was really vicious on the front, you know, scrum.\n\n01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:21.620\nBare-knuckle, real, I'm just a brutal,\n\n01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:24.620\nI even test the rules just how hard I would fight.\n\n01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:27.620\nBite it, I bit a guy, we won.\n\n01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:28.620\nYou bit a guy and won.\n\n01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:33.620\nThis was back when I was at the University of Chicago.\n\n01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:36.620\nWhy did that make you laugh?\n\n01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:42.620\nBecause it's actually true, and I'm impressed with myself that I remember exactly where I went to college,\n\n01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:45.620\nbecause it was in the middle of the late 1960s,\n\n01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:49.620\nand I am lucky I remember any of it.\n\n01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:53.620\nThere's a vague haze of LSD and Tom Haynes,\n\n01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:55.620\nthat's all I can kind of remember.\n\n01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:59.620\nSo, all right, well, look.\n\n01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:01.620\nJeff has checked out, that's fine.\n\n01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:02.620\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:06.620\nLike, let's get this to eight-year-old level.\n\n01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:10.620\nOkay, so, like, because here's what's going to happen in the election.\n\n01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:12.620\nProductions, okay.\n\n01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:14.620\nBecause I've been through this a thousand times already,\n\n01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:16.620\nthat those numbers are inflated.\n\n01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:22.620\nThe number of years I voted are not 25% of the 90% of what I just said,\n\n01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:23.620\nbut I feel like-\n\n01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:24.620\nHow do you ever vote?\n\n01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:30.620\nI voted every- there's only a couple elections where I was so fucking like just over it\n\n01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:32.620\nthat I didn't vote and didn't talk to anybody about it.\n\n01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:33.620\nSure.\n\n01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:35.620\nThose were- because as I've said on the show,\n\n01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:39.620\nthe real reason I vote is because I want to continue to have a political opinion,\n\n01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:41.620\nand we have an entrenched thing in this.\n\n01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:47.620\nYou're not allowed to talk about breaking out of this the way that things work.\n\n01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:50.620\nPeople are voting for voting for voting for voting for voting.\n\n01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:54.620\nThey're voting for- they're voting for faith in the way the system has worked,\n\n01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:57.620\nwhich is a system that 87% of everybody doesn't believe in.\n\n01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:00.620\nYou know, I sat down with Yoko Oro, and she said the same thing.\n\n01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:03.620\nGood. Well, that's-\n\n01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:07.620\nDan, right now, if election day was tomorrow, who would you vote for?\n\n01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:08.620\nWould you vote, and if so, who?\n\n01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:14.620\nI'm going to go- I'm going to vote for Bernie Sanders,\n\n01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:17.620\nand I wish that everybody that voted just voted their conscience,\n\n01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:21.620\nbecause I don't think- I think the problem, and I think this actually goes beyond like-\n\n01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:23.620\nI thought you had voted for-\n\n01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:25.620\nYeah, I did, I did.\n\n01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:29.620\nI feel like it goes beyond when you talk about America,\n\n01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:33.620\nbecause you could explain American politics in a really easy way,\n\n01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:36.620\nwhich is just like, you know, we keep talking about how broke we are and how in trouble we are,\n\n01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:40.620\nbut until that really becomes a definable real thing,\n\n01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:46.620\nthe fact is that we're still rich and we're still fine the way things are,\n\n01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:51.620\nand so we're going to continue to kind of do this thing the way we did it last time.\n\n01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:52.620\nHowever-\n\n01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:53.620\nThat's something we're going to look at.\n\n01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:54.620\nI do think it's-\n\n01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:55.620\nThat's something we're going to look at.\n\n01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:58.620\nThe idea that the country itself, you could vote for anybody you want to,\n\n01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:01.620\njust vote- if you want to vote for the Queen of England, go for it.\n\n01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:06.620\nI want the country to be more like a Tumblr post that you see late at night,\n\n01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:10.620\nwhere there's some sort of pyramid floating on a planet,\n\n01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:14.620\nand there's just sort of ancient wisdom that's guiding us.\n\n01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:16.620\nThat's what I want to work towards.\n\n01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:17.620\nBernie-\n\n01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:18.620\nLet's say you weren't running.\n\n01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:20.620\nWho would you vote for if you weren't a candidate?\n\n01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:23.620\nIf I wasn't running for president, who would I vote for?\n\n01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:24.620\nYeah.\n\n01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:28.620\nWell, look, I would probably vote for Stevie Dicks.\n\n01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:30.620\nI think it's time for a woman president.\n\n01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.620\nThat's who I would vote for.\n\n01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:34.620\nBut do you think she's tough enough on immigration?\n\n01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:41.620\nLook, I think I've seen her kick people out of our house when we used to party at the Bangor Canyon.\n\n01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:46.620\nAnd believe me, believe me, she knows how to elegantly get somebody out of the foyer\n\n01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:50.620\nwhere they've had a little bit too much of the mirror.\n\n01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:54.620\nThank you, that's good for people.\n\n01:11:54.620 --> 01:12:00.620\nI predict a landslide.\n\n01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:06.620\nAnyways, I had to, I fucking had to, it was like a fucking, you had to like,\n\n01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:11.620\nit's like an LA story when she has to like do the rest of shaving a haircut on her tuba.\n\n01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:14.620\nIt's like fucking dumbass fucking pun.\n\n01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:17.620\nThe landslide, it was a Fleetwood Max song.\n\n01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:18.620\nBut wait, wait, wait, wait.\n\n01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:21.620\nI just want to, not because I think it's important or it's going to benefit them,\n\n01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:23.620\nbut because it's in my fucking head and I have some problem.\n\n01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:25.620\nThere must be some like, like, like, like,\n\n01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:26.620\nIt's fair.\n\n01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:27.620\nI want people like this to have a forum.\n\n01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:33.620\nGo ahead, go on.\n\n01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:36.620\nThere must be like some, like, there's, I bet there's somebody in the audience that's like,\n\n01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:37.620\nlike, studying this or not.\n\n01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:39.620\nI've read a book about this or something like that.\n\n01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:42.620\nIt must be some, some, there's this, this thing,\n\n01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:46.620\nevery time we have our elections every year, there's this principle that keeps coming into,\n\n01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:53.620\ninto, into the fore where people, they, they, the idea of voting.\n\n01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:57.620\nSure, casting a ballot, elections.\n\n01:12:57.620 --> 01:13:03.620\nNo, I, no, I look, look, we're rolled up our sleeves, we're having a little policy, walk out, let's go for it.\n\n01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:09.620\nThey don't want to vote just to express as a natural part of the process.\n\n01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:13.620\nThey don't want to just be a part of, of a total tally.\n\n01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:19.620\nAnd then we think of it like, we, we all want to vote for the winner.\n\n01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:24.620\nWe don't want to be part of the problem by voting for the wrong person.\n\n01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:27.620\nAnd when we have third party candidates, it becomes a huge problem because not only do you,\n\n01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:29.620\npeople not wanting to vote for the wrong person.\n\n01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:31.620\nThird party candidate, go ahead.\n\n01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:35.620\nBut like, I think you're like an eighth party candidate.\n\n01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:36.620\nThe, the, the.\n\n01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:37.620\nI have been in the past.\n\n01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:43.620\nYes, I read for the peace and freedom party and I actually split to the peace and freedom party.\n\n01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:48.620\nOh my God, see, I was on the freedom side of the peace people we didn't get a look with.\n\n01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:52.620\nAnd I think I've ranted about, remember when Nader was, was, was, was running and there was like this thing,\n\n01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:54.620\nit was like that, that big election.\n\n01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:58.620\nIt was like, oh, the culture wars are at their peak because we had no fucking real problems yet at all.\n\n01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:03.620\nSo at all, anybody wanted to talk about how fucking important it was whether this guy or that guy got elected.\n\n01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:06.620\nAnd it was like so fucking important to everybody.\n\n01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:08.620\nI'm not saying like, I think what was that Gore versus Vader?\n\n01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:12.620\nWhat was the, it was Gore versus Palpatine.\n\n01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:18.620\nBut it was like, so, so, so I do understand it was important for so many, so, so many small reasons.\n\n01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:26.620\nBy the way, I want to say just really quickly, the political message of the second of the latest trilogy of the Star Wars movies is a little thick.\n\n01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:28.620\nIt's laid on a little thick, but I think it is accurate.\n\n01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:31.620\nI think the Bush administration is a lot like the Emperor.\n\n01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:41.620\nThose people, those journalists who were like reporting from the Ralph Nader campaign headquarters where this is a guy who knew he was going to lose.\n\n01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:43.620\nIt was important for him to run.\n\n01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:45.620\nIt was important to the people that were supporting him.\n\n01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:48.620\nIt was running. I mean, I know Ralph, I know Ralph.\n\n01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:50.620\nHe was, look, he was, he thought he was going to win.\n\n01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:52.620\nYeah, he bought the balloons.\n\n01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:56.620\nEnd of story.\n\n01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:59.620\nThere was a lot of balloons and they couldn't release them up.\n\n01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:01.620\nThey had to get rid of them.\n\n01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:05.620\nThere's nothing sadder than getting rid of a bunch of balloons the quiet way.\n\n01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:08.620\nMr. Sanders, how early does a candidate have to buy those balloons?\n\n01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:11.620\nYou have to buy them, you can't buy them like two days before.\n\n01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:14.620\nLegally, according to the Federal Election Commission,\n\n01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:22.620\nthe FCFEC, yes, there's a certain, you have to have, you have to report every balloon you receive as a donation.\n\n01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:29.620\nAnd also whether it was helium or regular air or some other sort of gas that might be poisonous in a rare case.\n\n01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:35.620\nOr if a water balloon, you have to of course go to the Department of Interior because we're in the midst of an epic drought.\n\n01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:40.620\nWhich I am trying to help solve by the volume of sweat that's coming out.\n\n01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:45.620\nWhen I'm in California, I deliberately perspire more.\n\n01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:47.620\nThank you.\n\n01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:50.620\nIn order to help refill Lake Powell.\n\n01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:54.620\nThat is saltwater though, we have like a whole ocean of that.\n\n01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:57.620\nTrust me, trust me, this is just like Salt Lake, baby.\n\n01:15:57.620 --> 01:16:02.620\nBut the guy on the floor at the, the journalists like, like, like, well, the campaign's going on.\n\n01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:07.620\nSo they got like, so we're, because everyone was watching, everybody that wanted either Bush or Gore,\n\n01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:11.620\nwhoever the fuck was running against who, Mothra and Gamera, they were running against each other.\n\n01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:16.620\nAnd everyone was on the edge of their seats because it was a fucking barn burner, that's not the right metaphor.\n\n01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:21.620\nIt was a hair splitter, it was a fucking turtle fucker.\n\n01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:30.620\nTheir turtle vaginas are like, they're bifurcated with a very thin membrane.\n\n01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:32.620\nIt was a candle burner.\n\n01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:37.620\nAnd male turtles have a two pronged, like it's like a tuning fork.\n\n01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:40.620\nAnd I'll get, I'll put a pin in that.\n\n01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:45.620\nBut they got, I think it's time that we hear from the female turtles, frankly, but go ahead.\n\n01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:47.620\nWell, that's, that's the news from Florida.\n\n01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:49.620\nWe got the numbers up here.\n\n01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:53.620\nWe got Will I Am and it has a hologram and he's coming in and all that stuff.\n\n01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:54.620\nAnd let's go.\n\n01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:56.620\nAnd everyone was like, like, it was like, this is fucking crazy.\n\n01:16:56.620 --> 01:17:05.620\nI guess this is before like, like, like it was, it was like weird that journalism was dead, but it was like, they were like, it was fucking crazy to me because they were like,\n\n01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:07.620\nthat's when my spirit really fucking died.\n\n01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:16.620\nI didn't vote for Ralph Nader, but watching the coverage, I was like, they were like, well, we now, so that's, that's the news from that fucking neck and neck race.\n\n01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:23.620\nAnd well, you keep hearing his name and he is, of course, the reason why this is neck and neck.\n\n01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:32.620\nWe now go to Nancy Johnson, who's over at Ralph Nader headquarters, head shake, head shake, head shake, Nancy.\n\n01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:38.620\nAnd, and there was like, and she cuts it and Nancy's like, um, yeah, uh, yeah, they're thrilled down here.\n\n01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:50.620\nUm, uh, uh, because all the unspoken thing that everyone was saying was like, if you voted for Nader, you're voting for, for Bush, you're voting because he's splitting the vote.\n\n01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:54.620\nI was like, this isn't, this is insane. This isn't, that's not democracy.\n\n01:17:54.620 --> 01:18:02.620\nRight. The idea of focusing on the outcome and then backing into your behavior as an end user. That's our fucking disease.\n\n01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:11.620\nI firmly believe that we should have a Scandinavian style system in a lot of ways, not only the way we tax corporations, but also elections.\n\n01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:15.620\nMultiple parties. I want to have a WikiLeaks party.\n\n01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:22.620\nWhere you bring Assange back. One of those crazy pirate parties they have up in Sweden and all that stuff.\n\n01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:27.620\nI want, I want to make sure that we have a fantastic array of different choices.\n\n01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:35.620\nYou have like a nice buffet. If you want to vote for like, like a nice little fishy, eggy breakfast thing, you can go ahead and vote for it.\n\n01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:41.620\nFantastic breakfast in Scandinavia, by the way, too. Go with me. You'll find out. Trust me.\n\n01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:48.620\nBut also, I think, you know, just have a little democratic system like that. If you want to have, you know, play fun and games, you do a little girl who let it, drag a tattoo thing.\n\n01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:55.620\nYou know, you can still keep that up for all the guys who want to do the bad stuff. We can have a little tag, drag a tattoo game for you.\n\n01:18:55.620 --> 01:19:00.620\nYeah. I mean, it's democracy. Parliamentary system.\n\n01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:04.620\nHold on a second. There's a parliamentary system. Yeah, that's a good, who is that?\n\n01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:05.620\nThat's John Parliament.\n\n01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:09.620\nThat's my policy. That's my policy advisor. He come.\n\n01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:10.620\nThank you. Good.\n\n01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:11.620\nYeah.\n\n01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:19.620\nOh, what about the idea that, yeah, whenever we talk about the system being broken and how it's not a true democracy, then there's people who say, well, it's supposed to be a republic.\n\n01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:23.620\nWhat do those people mean? Do they mean they want it to be a republic, or do they mean that it works better as a republic?\n\n01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:29.620\nThose are people, those are people, those are the same people that say whom when you say who.\n\n01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:37.620\nThose are the same assholes that go, what, well, you can't even understand what's with the preposition. That's how people talk, motherfuckers.\n\n01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:47.620\nA republic means for the people. Democracy means the rule of the power of the people. It's close enough. Forget it. What are you?\n\n01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:54.620\nWhat am I? What am I? What am I? What am I? What am I supposed to read the back of an old-timey dollar bill or something?\n\n01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:59.620\nWhat are you, a broadsheet from the days of, what am I? What am I? Martin Van Buren?\n\n01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:03.620\nI do look a lot like Martin Van Buren.\n\n01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:11.620\nSpencer, if you could pick a governmental system from anywhere throughout history, what do you think would be the most just and the most simple?\n\n01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:16.620\nLike currently, or like when we have now, or something at any part of history?\n\n01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:21.620\nOh man, let me tell you something. Let me tell you something about fiefdoms.\n\n01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:24.620\nThey really, you know, they really...\n\n01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:26.620\nYou want to bring the fiefdom back?\n\n01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:31.620\nThey really did it. They made it happen. You know, you had castles, you had knights and shit, there was serfs.\n\n01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:34.620\nIt's all the things you want out of society.\n\n01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:38.620\nUnless you're a serf. Actually, they're probably pretty happy.\n\n01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:45.620\nIt is attractive when you do open up that Lego knight's set and you got the little guy with a rounded sword.\n\n01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:46.620\nYeah, there's dragons.\n\n01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:48.620\nIt's not going to hurt anybody. It's a rounded sword.\n\n01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:57.620\nBut look, something gets out of order. You lose a Lego here or there. It's ugly, then suddenly wham, braveheart, or worse, you know, like...\n\n01:20:57.620 --> 01:21:05.620\nI'm trying to remember my 10th grade history, so it's like Holy Roman Empire, and like, does that break into feudal Europe?\n\n01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:08.620\nYou know what they say about the Holy Roman Empire, right?\n\n01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:13.620\nNeither Holy, nor Roman, nor interesting in any way.\n\n01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:17.620\nI think after the fall of Rome, it went into the Dark Ages for a while, didn't it?\n\n01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:18.620\nThat's one of the things that...\n\n01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:19.620\nWell, there was...\n\n01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:25.620\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I have no... I shamelessly say I don't fucking know,\n\n01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:29.620\nbut I also, like, I guess it would be weird to make people listen to all of us not know.\n\n01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:33.620\nWell, no, I don't know. Hold on a second, and I don't yield my time just yet.\n\n01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:44.620\nIf the senator would yield, I just think that of 30 seconds here, I think there is a danger that the analogy has been made before that we are repeating, you know, the mistakes of the Roman Empire.\n\n01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:46.620\nI'm not the first to say something like that.\n\n01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:48.620\nOh, because all roads are leading somewhere.\n\n01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:53.620\nSure, all roads, or whatever, the back of a horse, you know, you got the email with multiple colors, you get it?\n\n01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:57.620\nYour mother, your dad sends you an email, that's what I'm talking about.\n\n01:21:57.620 --> 01:21:58.620\nRome, Rome, Rome, Rome.\n\n01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:02.620\nBut we're an empire that's in its decline in the same way that the Roman Empire declined.\n\n01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:14.620\nAnd look, so my solution, if we are truly facing a Dark Ages, is to make sure that we have enough solar-powered stationary bicycles to at least have a little bit of light during those Dark Ages.\n\n01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:16.620\nYeah, yeah, we should stack up and...\n\n01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:18.620\nWe should plan for it, you know?\n\n01:22:18.620 --> 01:22:19.620\nWe should plan for the Dark Ages.\n\n01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:23.620\nPlan, look, just look, have some candles in the drawer.\n\n01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:29.620\nMake sure you got extra batteries or whatever, just, you know, be safe.\n\n01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:31.620\nAlright, is Dimarch here?\n\n01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:32.620\nYeah.\n\n01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:35.620\nOh, he made a stand.\n\n01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:38.620\nYou know, we always expect him to be here and he's like, what if I wasn't?\n\n01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.620\nHe said, because Arsenal lost again.\n\n01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:41.620\nOh.\n\n01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:45.620\nThat's just...\n\n01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:46.620\nThey soccer in particular.\n\n01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:47.620\nThey did?\n\n01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:48.620\nThat's too bad.\n\n01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:49.620\nYeah.\n\n01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:53.620\nWell, I think you're going to have to stay up here and play Shadowrun with us, Senator Sanders.\n\n01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:55.620\nHold on a second.\n\n01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:56.620\nHold on a second.\n\n01:22:56.620 --> 01:22:59.620\nI need to, hold on, let me consult with my campaign manager.\n\n01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:00.620\nI know we had another event.\n\n01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:05.620\nI was scheduled to go be interrupted by protesters who I agree with completely.\n\n01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:07.620\nLet me see real quick.\n\n01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:08.620\nHold on a second.\n\n01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:09.620\nCan we just ask if there's...\n\n01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:10.620\nStrange.\n\n01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:12.620\nIt's the...\n\n01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:13.620\nI'm available.\n\n01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:14.620\nI'm available.\n\n01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:15.620\nI'm good.\n\n01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:20.620\nThis is all more airtime than I've gotten in the last three months on CNN.\n\n01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:25.620\nAll right now, Bernie Sanders, have you ever played a fantasy role-playing game before?\n\n01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:26.620\nSure.\n\n01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:27.620\nYes.\n\n01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:28.620\nI mean this...\n\n01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:29.620\nYes, I have.\n\n01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:31.620\nI've never had the Dungeon Master.\n\n01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:33.620\nI didn't like the, you know...\n\n01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:35.620\nI didn't like the idea of a Dungeon...\n\n01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:37.620\nA hierarchical Dungeon Master.\n\n01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:41.620\nThat sounds too much like corporate power to me.\n\n01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:42.620\nBut let me put it this way.\n\n01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:47.620\nI have played Meeples that I became very attached to.\n\n01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:48.620\nMeeples.\n\n01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:49.620\nSome was a compare to whatever you want.\n\n01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:51.620\nI played, look, here or there.\n\n01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:58.620\nWhat character, if you had to choose a mythological character to portray in a fantasy realm, what kind of character would it be?\n\n01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:00.620\nLook, I think that I would be...\n\n01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:11.620\nLook, I don't want to say a troll, but I don't want to say that I would obstruct certain areas with powerful feudal lords.\n\n01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:20.620\nWe're trying to cross a bridge or something, and I would say, hey, stop, but it would be more like you've got to look at the statistics and I would make sure they pay the fare.\n\n01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:23.620\nI'd stop like a magical, you can't cross...\n\n01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:30.620\nThe game that we're playing is actually set in the future, so it's more of a kind of a dystopian, kind of, you know, like 1984 Raven of the World kind of thing.\n\n01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:31.620\nGot it.\n\n01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:32.620\nI'm Chewbacca.\n\n01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:33.620\nAll right.\n\n01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:34.620\nOkay.\n\n01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:39.620\nImagine Star Wars where instead of moaning every 10 seconds, it's...\n\n01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:43.620\nWell, give me some Star Wars.\n\n01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:45.620\nChewie, hand me the Hydro Spanner.\n\n01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:53.620\n1% or 5% of the top hydro spans are controlled by the Imperial Council, and I don't think that's fair.\n\n01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:55.620\nThat is what I'm calling...\n\n01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:57.620\nPunch it, Chewie.\n\n01:24:57.620 --> 01:24:58.620\nPunch it.\n\n01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:00.620\nPunch it, Chewie.\n\n01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:02.620\nWe're ahead of New Hampshire, we're ahead of Iowa.\n\n01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:04.620\nLet's see how far we can take it.\n\n01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:17.620\nSomebody in this audience will take a scene from Star Wars and subtitle Chewie's growls with Bernie Sanders.\n\n01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:21.620\nThat will be funny.\n\n01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:23.620\nLaugh it up, first of all.\n\n01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:31.620\nI believe that every American who works deserves a paycheck and a chance and a fair shot of the American Dream.\n\n01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:34.620\nIt was a too long look.\n\n01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:41.620\nIf we do ADR, you come in and I wait for the beep, beep, beep, and I time it out so I can match the actual picture.\n\n01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:47.620\nBernie Sanders, how about at the end of the first Star Wars episode 4, the first one, when they're all getting their awards.\n\n01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:48.620\nThe real one.\n\n01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:55.620\nThe awards ceremony at the end of it and the music is playing and they all get up there and Han gets his medal and they cut to Chewie.\n\n01:25:55.620 --> 01:26:02.620\nI think it was a different song playing.\n\n01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:04.620\nBut they cut to Chewie and Chewie.\n\n01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:18.620\nIs this Chewie?\n\n01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:20.620\nIt's just Bernie Sanders.\n\n01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:22.620\nHe loves the Star Wars theme.\n\n01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:26.620\nIt's caught not a big dog without all of you Rebel Alliance.\n\n01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:30.620\nIt took a revolution and here it is.\n\n01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:31.620\nThank you.\n\n01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:33.620\nThat's all I want.\n\n01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:35.620\nJust get me into the Death Star.\n\n01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:45.620\nIs it too no pun intended, Pat, of me, to say why not just since we need a mercy on Donald and we don't have Aaron or DeMorge.\n\n01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:48.620\nWe don't want to just bring up our happy couple and have them play.\n\n01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:51.620\nPat and Hannah, do you want to join us for some chatter-run?\n\n01:26:51.620 --> 01:26:55.620\nPat and Hannah, return to the stage.\n\n01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:57.620\nYou guys have to sit on either.\n\n01:26:57.620 --> 01:27:00.620\nYou have to bookend me and the senator.\n\n01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:07.620\nBecause that's part of the challenge of your new life together is that you have to be autonomous as well.\n\n01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:14.620\nIt's called interdependence as opposed to co-dependence.\n\n01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:20.620\nPat and Hannah, do you live in Los Angeles?\n\n01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:21.620\nNo, New Hampshire.\n\n01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:24.620\nYou're going to call that home?\n\n01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:26.620\nYou're going to stay in New Hampshire?\n\n01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:34.620\nUntil I get a full-time job at the news station and then work there for a year or two and kind of look around the country.\n\n01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:35.620\nSee where it takes you?\n\n01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:36.620\nYeah.\n\n01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:37.620\nThat's cool.\n\n01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:40.620\nWhat is your forte at the news?\n\n01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:44.620\nWhat are your local budgetary issues?\n\n01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:50.620\nLocal interest, budgetary, financial, fiscal, all of those things.\n\n01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:53.620\nPhotoshoery, sports related angles.\n\n01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:57.620\nI'm training to be a director.\n\n01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:58.620\nA news director.\n\n01:27:58.620 --> 01:27:59.620\nFair enough? Fair enough?\n\n01:27:59.620 --> 01:28:02.620\nNot glam up behind the camera. Good, working.\n\n01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:03.620\nDid you like Nightcrawler?\n\n01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:05.620\nI fucking loved Nightcrawler.\n\n01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:06.620\nWait a minute. Hold on a second.\n\n01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:08.620\nAll those documents, hold on.\n\n01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:10.620\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:13.620\nOh, nice. Oh, good.\n\n01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:19.620\nI thought that was such a fun character for Gyllenhaal, I really like that.\n\n01:28:19.620 --> 01:28:25.620\nI kept falling asleep during Nightcrawler and I kept watching it over and over again to try to get to the end,\n\n01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:29.620\nbecause I'm like, oh, the movie's kind of a, you know, whatever, but I really like that character.\n\n01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:30.620\nHe's a great character.\n\n01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:36.620\nI just like that when the guy goes like, I'm not going to hire a thief and he goes like,\n\n01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:44.620\nfair enough, and you're like, oh my God, he's a fucking murderer or whatever, it's great, I love that.\n\n01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:50.620\nYou know the little anecdote, I have a little fun anecdote, like a little Peter Rabbit tale now and then,\n\n01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:59.620\nI was on an airplane and I was trying to watch the Tom Cruise movie with the robot, with, you know, the robots like it was.\n\n01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:03.620\nI realized there's a lot of them, but just tomorrow, that one.\n\n01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:04.620\nMine was a bit.\n\n01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:10.620\nAnd they kept coming, they kept coming on with, you know, the announcements, interrupting the picture,\n\n01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:17.620\nthat you lose where you were in the movie, and I was trying to rewind and just tomorrow to go, hey, let me watch where I left off from,\n\n01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:23.620\nand it's impossible to rewind to the same place where you were watching it from, because the whole movie is rewind to get shit.\n\n01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:24.620\nRight, right.\n\n01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:29.620\nIf I am elected president, I will burn that movie in every copy of it.\n\n01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:35.620\nOr at least make them do it again with an honest linear plot.\n\n01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:41.620\nOr at least just rewrite it, or just make an edit of it so that every time Tom Cruise wakes up in that pile of luggage,\n\n01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:44.620\nhe looks at the camera and goes, four times.\n\n01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:52.620\nThat would help me, some numbers, just like, you know, an x-axis and a y-axis, just put it out there.\n\n01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:56.620\nEuclidean geometry, what's wrong with that? Where did we go so wrong?\n\n01:29:56.620 --> 01:29:59.620\nDo you like Euclidean geometry, Hannah?\n\n01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:02.620\nObviously.\n\n01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:04.620\nI mean, it's proven.\n\n01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:06.620\nVery good, very good.\n\n01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:10.620\nI'm on fire with the fucking dumbass puns tonight.\n\n01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:15.620\nI've turned into the grandpa I never had.\n\n01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:19.620\nTell me about it.\n\n01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:21.620\nHow old are you, Mr. Sanders?\n\n01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:27.620\nThat's confidential national security, it's actually state security information of the state of Vermont.\n\n01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:31.620\nIt's one of the few secrets that we have in the Vermont Secret Service.\n\n01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:33.620\nLet's just see how old I am.\n\n01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:40.620\nYeah, let's just say, 90% of the time you've been on this earth, 10% of the people that are still alive have seen 5% of the people die.\n\n01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:43.620\nRight, let's put it this way.\n\n01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:48.620\nWhen we look at how we're depleting the resources on the planet and we're wondering,\n\n01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:55.620\nhey, maybe the resources will last a little longer, trust me, they won't, I go back to the Perbian.\n\n01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:58.620\nWell, that's too far, crustaceous, whatever you want.\n\n01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:01.620\nCrustaceous, the crustaceous.\n\n01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:06.620\nBecause you're saying you were around when oil was still dinosaurs and that didn't last.\n\n01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:09.620\nOr, you know, the pink Hitler or whatever that was.\n\n01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:13.620\nWhatever that was, it was Citizen fucking Kane is what it was.\n\n01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:17.620\nI'll joke all about a lot of shit, but that was my fucking idea and it was great.\n\n01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:20.620\nIt's not far off from the way things are.\n\n01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:23.620\nThis guy, I'm going to answer that question you had.\n\n01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:25.620\nThere's good answers, certainly.\n\n01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:26.620\nYou're a good answer.\n\n01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:28.620\nThanks, man, that's very nice.\n\n01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:30.620\nAll commercial statements tonight.\n\n01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:34.620\nSpencer, are you ready to recap the last Shadowrun we played?\n\n01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:37.620\nI'm ready for any number of eventualities.\n\n01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:41.620\nDo we have a guest Shadowrun Sumerizer?\n\n01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:43.620\nYeah, Jason Clymer.\n\n01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:45.620\nJason Clymer?\n\n01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:47.620\nProbably Clymer.\n\n01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:48.620\nAll right, let's find out.\n\n01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:49.620\nAre you ready to rock?\n\n01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:52.620\nI don't think we will find out.\n\n01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:56.620\nAre we voting?\n\n01:31:56.620 --> 01:31:58.620\nI abstain.\n\n01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:00.620\nThe senator from the vote who stands.\n\n01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:02.620\nHis first question was, are we voting?\n\n01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:04.620\nHis second was, I abstain.\n\n01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:07.620\nI would like to filibuster.\n\n01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:10.620\nI would like to filibuster the vote.\n\n01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:14.620\nI do not think it's responsible to hold the vote on an issue.\n\n01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:18.620\nNo, I like this.\n\n01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:24.620\nBecause also contractually, we can't play anything with too much medieval stuff in it,\n\n01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:26.620\nand we also can't do it for more than 10 minutes,\n\n01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:28.620\ntechnically, according to our contracts,\n\n01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:31.620\nduring render services, render of services on our...\n\n01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:32.620\nI think we'll find that.\n\n01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:34.620\nI think we'll find that if you...\n\n01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:37.620\n19 minutes from now, we will have played four minutes of gameplay.\n\n01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:40.620\nI'm pretty sure the people that are worried about that will...\n\n01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:44.620\nOh, but also contractually, which I think is a great fucking idea,\n\n01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:46.620\nI am supposed to say,\n\n01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:49.620\nHarmon Quest, coming soon to CISO.\n\n01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:52.620\nIt's going to be a new thing, and we'll be plucking it in.\n\n01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:54.620\nWe've had six tapings so far, right?\n\n01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:55.620\nThey've all been...\n\n01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:57.620\nHas anybody gone to the Harmon Quest tapings?\n\n01:32:57.620 --> 01:32:58.620\nYou guys have been there?\n\n01:32:58.620 --> 01:33:00.620\nYou should come to Monday or Tuesday.\n\n01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:02.620\nWe still have empty seats.\n\n01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:05.620\nIt would be great if we rang in the...\n\n01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:08.620\nI was going to say New Year, but it's not really that.\n\n01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:11.620\nThank you for the invitation, but I'm not sure if I can...\n\n01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:15.620\nRight, no, it'll look like a paola?\n\n01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:17.620\nI don't care what it looks like,\n\n01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:19.620\nbecause as long as I'm always giving the money back,\n\n01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:21.620\nI'm never really having much.\n\n01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:23.620\nYeah, you know, I'm supposed to say...\n\n01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:24.620\nI don't know when this contract kicks in.\n\n01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:26.620\nWell, I signed it, but I don't know if it's like...\n\n01:33:26.620 --> 01:33:31.620\nYeah, but, okay, watch Harmon Quest on CISO.\n\n01:33:31.620 --> 01:33:33.620\nYou see it, so...\n\n01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:34.620\nYou like it.\n\n01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:35.620\nYou like it.\n\n01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:38.620\nComing soon, it's going to be like a...\n\n01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:40.620\nLike in the spring, maybe?\n\n01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:41.620\nProbably come in the spring.\n\n01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:44.620\nEverything else does.\n\n01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:46.620\nDon't clap for that.\n\n01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:50.620\n30, 29, 28, 27...\n\n01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:59.620\n27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20...\n\n01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:01.620\nI should have started at 10.\n\n01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:21.620\n70, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.\n\n01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:26.620\n0, negative 1, negative 2.\n\n01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:27.620\nYeah.\n\n01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:29.620\nThe square rule is negative 4.\n\n01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:31.620\nThat's going to...\n\n01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:34.620\nOut of all the jokes we should never call back, like...\n\n01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:38.620\nThe 30-second countdown to no pay off?\n\n01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:43.620\nOut of the Wikipedia entry for the podcast about recurring bits,\n\n01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:44.620\nand it's like all the shows.\n\n01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:45.620\nLike, why is that recurring?\n\n01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:48.620\nAnd then one of them is the 30-second stare.\n\n01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:52.620\nOh, yeah, that show needed that.\n\n01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:54.620\nBy the way, did you start your own Wikipedia page?\n\n01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:55.620\nDid you?\n\n01:34:55.620 --> 01:34:56.620\nI don't know.\n\n01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:58.620\nI don't know either.\n\n01:34:58.620 --> 01:34:59.620\nWait, wait.\n\n01:34:59.620 --> 01:35:00.620\nDo you mean as a human being?\n\n01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:01.620\nSure, yeah.\n\n01:35:01.620 --> 01:35:02.620\nI just thought you're old page.\n\n01:35:02.620 --> 01:35:03.620\nLike a Dan Harmon Wikipedia page?\n\n01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:04.620\nYeah.\n\n01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:05.620\nNo, but I did...\n\n01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:06.620\nThere was one that had like a little bit...\n\n01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:08.620\nAnd this is way back in the day.\n\n01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:10.620\nLike, I did add to it.\n\n01:35:10.620 --> 01:35:11.620\nI did like put like...\n\n01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:13.620\nWell, also he kind of, you know, did this and that.\n\n01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:14.620\nBecause they get things wrong.\n\n01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:15.620\nYou got to go where you go now.\n\n01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:16.620\nWell, they leave stuff out.\n\n01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:18.620\nI don't know how I know who I am.\n\n01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:19.620\nI thought you were born in Vermont.\n\n01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:20.620\nYou're born in Brooklyn, you dumbass.\n\n01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:22.620\nBut that was like in the early days of Wikipedia,\n\n01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:24.620\nand I hadn't done that much.\n\n01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:27.620\nAnd I learned my lesson hard because I didn't even know.\n\n01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:29.620\nI was like, oh, anyone can do this?\n\n01:35:29.620 --> 01:35:32.620\nHe's also brazenly witty and...\n\n01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:36.620\nAnd then I found out there was like this tribunal of people\n\n01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:37.620\nthat goes like...\n\n01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:39.620\nI found the thing where they're just like,\n\n01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:41.620\nI think he wrote this.\n\n01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:42.620\nI don't think...\n\n01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:43.620\nI don't care who wrote it.\n\n01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:44.620\nHe doesn't...\n\n01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:47.620\nHe seems to be someone who mostly knows noteworthy people,\n\n01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:49.620\nmore than is noteworthy.\n\n01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:51.620\nI concur with Zaxxon.\n\n01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:56.620\nThis man should be sent to the Phantom Zone.\n\n01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:58.620\nYou're not wrong.\n\n01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:01.620\nI think Jimmy Wales has too much power and authority,\n\n01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:03.620\nand I promise to break up Wikipedia\n\n01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:05.620\nand run it like a public utility.\n\n01:36:05.620 --> 01:36:08.620\nOh, no.\n\n01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:10.620\nSpencer, are you ready to go?\n\n01:36:10.620 --> 01:36:11.620\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:12.620\nI mean, you're...\n\n01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:14.620\nYou're gonna be a criminal for six minutes,\n\n01:36:14.620 --> 01:36:15.620\nbut go ahead.\n\n01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:16.620\nAre you really contract now?\n\n01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:17.620\nThey're not gonna...\n\n01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:19.620\nWe're not gonna play over the end.\n\n01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:21.620\nThere's all kinds of shit we can say in court.\n\n01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:22.620\nIf it's a shit, it's a fan.\n\n01:36:22.620 --> 01:36:24.620\nWhat, it's just a patrol thing?\n\n01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:27.620\nSee, you start playing with corporations.\n\n01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:28.620\nThis is what happens.\n\n01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:29.620\nI know.\n\n01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:30.620\nBut no, we're fine.\n\n01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:31.620\nWe're fine.\n\n01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:32.620\nI'm good.\n\n01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:33.620\nI'm clean.\n\n01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:34.620\nI just meant...\n\n01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:36.620\nI don't get briefcases of anything besides ice cream\n\n01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:38.620\nfrom pen and cherries.\n\n01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:39.620\nYou get it.\n\n01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:42.620\nI pay for it.\n\n01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:44.620\nShould we drag our feet a little more then?\n\n01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:45.620\nNo, no.\n\n01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:46.620\nBut I do say...\n\n01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:47.620\nI don't want to say...\n\n01:36:47.620 --> 01:36:50.620\nBut I am, like, so amused by the idea...\n\n01:36:50.620 --> 01:36:51.620\nSo someone in our country...\n\n01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:53.620\n...of a court case where we end up in court,\n\n01:36:53.620 --> 01:36:54.620\nand there's like...\n\n01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:57.620\nOur attorney, like, has to prove to the jury that...\n\n01:36:57.620 --> 01:37:00.620\nI was like, well, but how many minutes during a game\n\n01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:01.620\nare you actually playing?\n\n01:37:01.620 --> 01:37:02.620\nAnd they have to...\n\n01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:05.620\nAnd it's like, oh my god, this is the Scopes Monkey Trial\n\n01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:06.620\nof role-playing games.\n\n01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:08.620\nIt's like, like, America is like turning in and going,\n\n01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:09.620\nyeah, wait a minute.\n\n01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:12.620\nLike, these guys suck.\n\n01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:15.620\nSo now by law, we're only allowed ten minutes of Shadowrun\n\n01:37:15.620 --> 01:37:16.620\nduring the show?\n\n01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:17.620\nI mean, we never played that much anyway.\n\n01:37:17.620 --> 01:37:18.620\nIt's not...\n\n01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:19.620\nCan we just stop playing Shadowrun?\n\n01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:21.620\nWell, if I shouldn't be here,\n\n01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:23.620\nthe best thing I need is some dirt for Hillary to pick up.\n\n01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:25.620\nShe's looking for something.\n\n01:37:25.620 --> 01:37:27.620\nAnd I'm squeaky clean.\n\n01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:29.620\nIf there's just gonna wreck it, I'm gonna get out of here.\n\n01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:30.620\nIt's not by law.\n\n01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:31.620\nIt's by contract.\n\n01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:33.620\nContractual agreement with our collaborators.\n\n01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:34.620\nOh, fuck it.\n\n01:37:34.620 --> 01:37:35.620\nBut is it actually?\n\n01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:36.620\nBecause it just...\n\n01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:38.620\nYou earlier said you were joking.\n\n01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:39.620\nWhat are you...\n\n01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:40.620\nJoking about what?\n\n01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:41.620\nAbout the contract.\n\n01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:42.620\nWith the contractual obligations.\n\n01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:43.620\nWait, when you guys talk at the same time,\n\n01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:45.620\nI hear Tim Pom Pom now.\n\n01:37:45.620 --> 01:37:46.620\nUgh.\n\n01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:47.620\nWhat?\n\n01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:48.620\nI mean, you're just joking, right?\n\n01:37:48.620 --> 01:37:49.620\nNo.\n\n01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:51.620\nIt's not contractual obligations.\n\n01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:52.620\nNo.\n\n01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:54.620\nThere is an agreement in the contract that we're not gonna...\n\n01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:58.620\nBasically, the headline of it is that we're not gonna do shit on the podcast\n\n01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:03.620\nthat's gonna compete with what we're trying to get people to tune into\n\n01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:04.620\nfor Harmon Quest.\n\n01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:05.620\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:08.620\nWhich you and I know you're having your first reaction to\n\n01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:11.620\nwhat will be a lifetime of fucking ridiculous contracts.\n\n01:38:11.620 --> 01:38:12.620\nWell, I mean, no.\n\n01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:13.620\nI'll just kill myself.\n\n01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:15.620\nThese are almost the good guys.\n\n01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:19.620\nThey just want everybody to see the show and be happy.\n\n01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:22.620\nIs there any way you could claim force majeure?\n\n01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:23.620\nYeah.\n\n01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:26.620\nBut you were almost forced to by an act of God\n\n01:38:26.620 --> 01:38:28.620\nor some sort of non-gender dating?\n\n01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:32.620\nSpencer, can you give Bernie Sanders a spell called force majeure?\n\n01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:34.620\nCan he cast force majeure on this?\n\n01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:35.620\nI think, yeah.\n\n01:38:35.620 --> 01:38:36.620\nYeah.\n\n01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:37.620\nForce majeure.\n\n01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:38.620\nYou had to.\n\n01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:41.620\nYou had to play the game with the shadow of the thing\n\n01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:44.620\nand there was no way because it was just...\n\n01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:46.620\nOops, these landed in our laps.\n\n01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:48.620\nWe had to play.\n\n01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:50.620\nI think I said something and then I said that.\n\n01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:51.620\nI was joking.\n\n01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:54.620\nThe thing that is not a joke is that when it was in the 11th hour,\n\n01:38:54.620 --> 01:38:59.620\nI was like, okay, 10 minutes, not D&D,\n\n01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:03.620\nmeaning not the milieu of...\n\n01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:05.620\nSo we couldn't play, for instance,\n\n01:39:05.620 --> 01:39:08.620\nStratigo for 20 minutes, either?\n\n01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:10.620\nI would love to do that.\n\n01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:12.620\nMove the nine forward.\n\n01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:14.620\nIt's a nine. They're both God.\n\n01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:15.620\nMove the nine forward.\n\n01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:16.620\nIt's a seven.\n\n01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:18.620\nOops, just a nine is forward.\n\n01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:21.620\nWe could play Stratigo.\n\n01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:22.620\nOh, okay.\n\n01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:24.620\nBecause there's muskets in it, right?\n\n01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:25.620\nYup.\n\n01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:28.620\nThere's one spy, there's a marshal and a general,\n\n01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:30.620\nand they all have the same feather hats.\n\n01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:31.620\nThey kind of look like my hair.\n\n01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:34.620\nThe most important thing is that it's during...\n\n01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:36.620\nOur service is rendered for the show that we're doing.\n\n01:39:36.620 --> 01:39:39.620\nIt's during the time that we wouldn't want to do anything.\n\n01:39:39.620 --> 01:39:43.620\nAnd also, we've never played more than three minutes of show.\n\n01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:46.620\nWell, I mean, yeah, but we've never had our hands tied.\n\n01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:48.620\nI know, I know, I know. It's weird.\n\n01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:50.620\nIt's weird to feel that on your wrists.\n\n01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:51.620\nYeah, believe me, I know.\n\n01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:53.620\nYou know what? I used to think like this,\n\n01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:55.620\nthat I found socialism.\n\n01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:58.620\nFuck the corporation.\n\n01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:00.620\nWhat's the worst they could do?\n\n01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:01.620\nI think this could be a good thing.\n\n01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:03.620\nLean back, take, you know, just lean back,\n\n01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:05.620\ntake a nice pill or something.\n\n01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:09.620\nI said we test the waters and play 11 minutes.\n\n01:40:09.620 --> 01:40:10.620\nYeah, just to see what the...\n\n01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:11.620\nWell, I think it could be...\n\n01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:13.620\nAlso, aren't you going to now fucking taste that 10 minutes?\n\n01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:15.620\nLike, all 50 shades of gray?\n\n01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:17.620\nWell, I think that argument could have been made\n\n01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:20.620\nfor all the other times we've tasted 10 minutes of shadow run.\n\n01:40:20.620 --> 01:40:23.620\nNo, you're talking from a logical place,\n\n01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:24.620\nand I'm talking from a sexy place.\n\n01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:25.620\nThat's all I...\n\n01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:27.620\nSo, like, all of that energy that you're spending\n\n01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:29.620\nlogically analyzing the idea of a contract\n\n01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:31.620\nforbidding you from doing what you want\n\n01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:33.620\nis actually a form of you expressing,\n\n01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:36.620\nyeah, I want to play shadow run.\n\n01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:37.620\nAnd if you...\n\n01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:38.620\nIf we had that for 10 minutes...\n\n01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:39.620\nOh...\n\n01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:41.620\nI mean, I have that every...\n\n01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:42.620\nNo, you have that.\n\n01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:43.620\nYou have that.\n\n01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:44.620\nYeah.\n\n01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:45.620\nNow we have that.\n\n01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:46.620\nDo you?\n\n01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:47.620\nWatch me, baby.\n\n01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:48.620\nOkay.\n\n01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:49.620\n949.\n\n01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:50.620\nWe're going to start...\n\n01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:53.620\nIs there a compelling reason that a United States\n\n01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:55.620\nsenator sitting currently serving\n\n01:40:55.620 --> 01:40:57.620\nshould be involved in these deliberations?\n\n01:40:57.620 --> 01:41:00.620\nI say we use what we're about to do right now\n\n01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:01.620\nas a plug for our CSOW thing.\n\n01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:03.620\nThis is, like, if you like what we're doing here,\n\n01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:05.620\nyou're going to see an awesome, better version\n\n01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:06.620\nanimated on CSOW.\n\n01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:09.620\nThis is the bullshit, like, fuck-around time\n\n01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:12.620\nas opposed to the high-quality, high-budget\n\n01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:14.620\nthing that we're doing for CSOW.\n\n01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:15.620\nYeah, like I said, force-major.\n\n01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:16.620\nExactly.\n\n01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:17.620\nI don't think anyone disagrees with that.\n\n01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:20.620\nYou guys know that when contracts go back and forth,\n\n01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:25.620\nit's literally two people, one from each side,\n\n01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:29.620\nwho have absolutely no familiarity with anything\n\n01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:30.620\nthat any of us do.\n\n01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:32.620\nSpeaking of no familiarity with anything,\n\n01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:34.620\nlet's play Shadowrun Poorly!\n\n01:41:41.620 --> 01:41:42.620\nAll right.\n\n01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:44.620\nAgain, by Jason Clymer.\n\n01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:47.620\nLast town on Harmon Run.\n\n01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:51.620\nThe gang taking an unusual heist of antique MP3s\n\n01:41:51.620 --> 01:41:54.620\ndecided that the easiest way to open a musical lock\n\n01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:58.620\nwas to visit a conservatory run by creepy children.\n\n01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:01.620\nAchieving perfect pitch, the gang did a lot\n\n01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:04.620\nof back-and-forthing due to Nightblade's alcoholism\n\n01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:07.620\nand Eve's rampant banana-na-na-na-na-ing\n\n01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:10.620\nand then arrived at a public storage facility\n\n01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:13.620\nwhich had a deviant receptionist.\n\n01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:15.620\nDespite Mercy's distraction,\n\n01:42:15.620 --> 01:42:17.620\nEve was caught crawling under the counter\n\n01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:20.620\nso the crew killed the curious Creighton.\n\n01:42:20.620 --> 01:42:23.620\nHortegaard and Dr. Fren fought about the morality\n\n01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:26.620\nwhile the Norwegian dwarf tried to ascertain\n\n01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:28.620\nthe locations of the sought songs.\n\n01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:30.620\nAs an afterthought, they remembered Hackeye,\n\n01:42:30.620 --> 01:42:33.620\nwho probably could have bypassed both the musicians\n\n01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:34.620\nand the murder.\n\n01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:38.620\nWill the gang successfully pull off a clean Shadowrun?\n\n01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:41.620\nIs there no limit to the number of murderers Hackeye\n\n01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:42.620\ncan cover up?\n\n01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:45.620\nWhat kind of post-apocalyptic music academy\n\n01:42:45.620 --> 01:42:47.620\ndoesn't charge tuition?\n\n01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:52.620\nFind out on this week's Harmon Run Shadow Town Time Town Time.\n\n01:42:52.620 --> 01:43:00.620\nThank you.\n\n01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:02.620\nJust an answer to that person's question,\n\n01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:04.620\nthere is a limit on the number of murderers I can cover up.\n\n01:43:04.620 --> 01:43:06.620\nIt has to be within 10 minutes.\n\n01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:09.620\nIt can't be done by a sword or a spell.\n\n01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:11.620\nYou're not Hackeye.\n\n01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:14.620\nAll right, Hackeye, do you have me on your car right now?\n\n01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:16.620\nYeah.\n\n01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:17.620\nCan you find out?\n\n01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:19.620\nI mean, look, we might have broken more eggs\n\n01:43:19.620 --> 01:43:21.620\nthan we needed to make this omelette.\n\n01:43:21.620 --> 01:43:24.620\nCan you find out where the MP3 storage unit is?\n\n01:43:24.620 --> 01:43:26.620\nNo, no, I cannot.\n\n01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:28.620\nThere's no records of that sort of thing.\n\n01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:30.620\nPeople just kind of walk in, store their things\n\n01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:33.620\nand leave without any, you know, documents or anything.\n\n01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:36.620\nThey don't store it at the front desk here?\n\n01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:39.620\nThat guy wouldn't know what's being stored where?\n\n01:43:39.620 --> 01:43:41.620\nNo, that would be a huge breach of privacy,\n\n01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:44.620\nwhich is the whole point of these locations.\n\n01:43:44.620 --> 01:43:45.620\nRight.\n\n01:43:45.620 --> 01:43:48.620\nHow many storage units are there in this facility?\n\n01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:49.620\nOh, man.\n\n01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:51.620\nLet me look this up.\n\n01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:54.620\n250.\n\n01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:57.620\nDoes that mean that it's designated a very important\n\n01:43:57.620 --> 01:44:02.620\ninfrastructural area according to federal guidelines?\n\n01:44:02.620 --> 01:44:04.620\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:06.620\nIn accordance with the federal guidelines.\n\n01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:10.620\nHackeye, it's a gymnate plate talking\n\n01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:14.620\nwithout the usual Bruce Willis patois.\n\n01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:19.620\nThe people that use this service,\n\n01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:22.620\nthey also sometimes use it electronically, right?\n\n01:44:22.620 --> 01:44:24.620\nThey're storing things physically,\n\n01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:27.620\nbut they're also logging in, logging out maybe sometimes.\n\n01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:33.620\nDoes this company have, you know, like Caldwell Banker does,\n\n01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:37.620\njust a fucking website where you have an account?\n\n01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:39.620\nNo, no.\n\n01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:42.620\nThey have accounts with people who are giving them money,\n\n01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:45.620\nbut that's really all they have in terms of records.\n\n01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:47.620\nAre they independently audited?\n\n01:44:47.620 --> 01:44:48.620\nNo.\n\n01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:51.620\nBy an outside agency besides their old internal,\n\n01:44:51.620 --> 01:44:52.620\nokay, that's not...\n\n01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:54.620\nHackeye, you're answering my question.\n\n01:44:54.620 --> 01:44:56.620\nThey have accounts of people that are giving them money.\n\n01:44:56.620 --> 01:44:58.620\nI'm not asking if they have, like, lists of the contents\n\n01:44:58.620 --> 01:44:59.620\nof the storage units.\n\n01:44:59.620 --> 01:45:00.620\nWell, there you go, yep.\n\n01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:02.620\nSo they have an accounting system.\n\n01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:05.620\nThey have a database full of people's names\n\n01:45:05.620 --> 01:45:08.620\nthat give them money in exchange for their services.\n\n01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:09.620\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:12.620\nOkay, so maybe there's something to go with there, right?\n\n01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:13.620\nAm I right?\n\n01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:15.620\nI'm just an assassin.\n\n01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:17.620\nYou guys figure it out.\n\n01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:21.620\nI mean, is there a way to use that musical technology we have\n\n01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:25.620\nto maybe walk by all the things and sing to the MP3 locks\n\n01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:26.620\nor something like that?\n\n01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:27.620\nOr is that crazy?\n\n01:45:27.620 --> 01:45:29.620\nYou're the worst shadow runner.\n\n01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:31.620\nI don't know.\n\n01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:33.620\nI'm just spitballing here.\n\n01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:34.620\nAll right.\n\n01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:35.620\nWell, I guess that's what I'm doing.\n\n01:45:35.620 --> 01:45:37.620\nCan I absolutely project through from room to room\n\n01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:39.620\nand kind of tell them?\n\n01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:41.620\nWould I be able to see if I was right?\n\n01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:43.620\nIf I could actually project through the rooms,\n\n01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:45.620\nwould I know if I saw them?\n\n01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:46.620\nNo, you wouldn't.\n\n01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:48.620\nWhen you're in astral form, you wouldn't really be able\n\n01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:51.620\nto tell just physical, non-living objects.\n\n01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:55.620\nThey just all kind of look like grave blobs and shadows.\n\n01:45:55.620 --> 01:46:00.620\nCan I suggest Professor Plub in the conservatory\n\n01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:02.620\nwith the lob clock?\n\n01:46:02.620 --> 01:46:04.620\nNo, Senator, no.\n\n01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:05.620\nI'm lost.\n\n01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:07.620\nWhat's your character, Senator?\n\n01:46:07.620 --> 01:46:08.620\nWell, what's my character?\n\n01:46:08.620 --> 01:46:09.620\nShadowrun.\n\n01:46:09.620 --> 01:46:10.620\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:12.620\nIt's just the first word you saw when you...\n\n01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:13.620\nWhat's the...\n\n01:46:13.620 --> 01:46:14.620\nOkay.\n\n01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:16.620\nNumber nine, he moves forward and he hits an eight.\n\n01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:17.620\nI think he's horticard.\n\n01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:18.620\nAll right.\n\n01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:20.620\nOh, Senator, you actually are like a character\n\n01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:21.620\nthat has the power to...\n\n01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:24.620\nI mean, does horticard have any powers\n\n01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:25.620\nthat could facilitate us here?\n\n01:46:25.620 --> 01:46:29.620\nLike, I guess along the lines of astral projection,\n\n01:46:29.620 --> 01:46:30.620\nhe's always doing random shit.\n\n01:46:30.620 --> 01:46:31.620\nYeah.\n\n01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:32.620\nLike, gives him amnesians.\n\n01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:35.620\nDoes he have the power to rally a popular mass movement\n\n01:46:35.620 --> 01:46:39.620\nof people that could break down the power structures\n\n01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:41.620\nthat have been ruling up until now?\n\n01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:43.620\nYeah, definitely has that power.\n\n01:46:43.620 --> 01:46:44.620\nThere you go.\n\n01:46:44.620 --> 01:46:45.620\nGood.\n\n01:46:45.620 --> 01:46:46.620\nThat sounds right.\n\n01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:48.620\nOkay, so...\n\n01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:49.620\nWhat I would...\n\n01:46:49.620 --> 01:46:50.620\nGo to jail.\n\n01:46:50.620 --> 01:46:51.620\nGo directly to jail.\n\n01:46:51.620 --> 01:46:53.620\nWhat I would be looking at if I were a cop,\n\n01:46:53.620 --> 01:46:55.620\nand I used to be backstory,\n\n01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:59.620\nis I would be looking at a timeline.\n\n01:46:59.620 --> 01:47:01.620\nI would be looking at whatever you do know\n\n01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:02.620\nand then...\n\n01:47:02.620 --> 01:47:05.620\nAnd then, like, well...\n\n01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:06.620\nOh, he's back in character now.\n\n01:47:06.620 --> 01:47:07.620\nIt's going to be good now.\n\n01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:09.620\nAre we able to pinpoint a time\n\n01:47:09.620 --> 01:47:12.620\nwhen somebody would have been storing a bunch of MP3s,\n\n01:47:12.620 --> 01:47:14.620\nas opposed to when, you know,\n\n01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:18.620\ncan we isolate, like, a forensically identifiable activity\n\n01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:21.620\nthat would be able to be seen on the computer?\n\n01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:23.620\nI was like, oh, I started my account,\n\n01:47:23.620 --> 01:47:26.620\nand then I dumped a bunch of shit in the storage unit,\n\n01:47:26.620 --> 01:47:27.620\nand then I...\n\n01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:30.620\nAnd it's like, whose account hasn't been active since Genesis?\n\n01:47:30.620 -->

if my cricket\n\n01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:51.620\nhas found any information.\n\n01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:56.620\nIt says, oh, man, I found so many peanuts.\n\n01:54:56.620 --> 01:55:00.620\nYou found... I asked you to look for MP3s, not peanuts.\n\n01:55:00.620 --> 01:55:01.620\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:55:01.620 --> 01:55:03.620\nThere's a plosive figure there.\n\n01:55:03.620 --> 01:55:04.620\nYou can understand the confusion.\n\n01:55:04.620 --> 01:55:05.620\nRight.\n\n01:55:05.620 --> 01:55:08.620\nNo, I found some MP3s.\n\n01:55:08.620 --> 01:55:09.620\nI didn't find a lot.\n\n01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:12.620\nI just found Frankie Franks' Greatest Hits.\n\n01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:15.620\nYou found Frankie Franks' Greatest Hits?\n\n01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:16.620\nYeah, that's it, though.\n\n01:55:16.620 --> 01:55:19.620\nI go on the comm and find our Johnson,\n\n01:55:19.620 --> 01:55:20.620\nour Hank back at Hank LeStan and say,\n\n01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:22.620\nHank, you got me on your comm?\n\n01:55:22.620 --> 01:55:23.620\nYeah.\n\n01:55:23.620 --> 01:55:25.620\nDo you like Frankie Frank's Greatest Hits?\n\n01:55:25.620 --> 01:55:26.620\nNo.\n\n01:55:26.620 --> 01:55:27.620\nShit.\n\n01:55:27.620 --> 01:55:28.620\nNew age guard between men.\n\n01:55:28.620 --> 01:55:30.620\nWe'll call you back in a bit.\n\n01:55:31.620 --> 01:55:33.620\nI mean, I don't want to be always this guy,\n\n01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:34.620\nbut maybe it's a dumb mission.\n\n01:55:34.620 --> 01:55:35.620\nMaybe it's...\n\n01:55:35.620 --> 01:55:36.620\nMaybe it was...\n\n01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:39.620\nMaybe we got made up during a drunken blackout\n\n01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:40.620\nwhen we had...\n\n01:55:40.620 --> 01:55:42.620\nLike a lot of overseas missions,\n\n01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:44.620\nI think that it's not wrong\n\n01:55:44.620 --> 01:55:47.620\nmaybe to pull back and concentrate on a hurled country.\n\n01:55:48.620 --> 01:55:49.620\nDon't blame the mission.\n\n01:55:49.620 --> 01:55:50.620\nOr not.\n\n01:55:51.620 --> 01:55:53.620\nRight, but, well, I mean,\n\n01:55:53.620 --> 01:55:55.620\nI'm not blaming the mission,\n\n01:55:55.620 --> 01:55:57.620\nsaying, like, well, we're clearly incapable\n\n01:55:57.620 --> 01:55:58.620\nof accomplishing the mission.\n\n01:55:58.620 --> 01:55:59.620\nThank you.\n\n01:55:59.620 --> 01:56:01.620\nDon't think that the people put that boy\n\n01:56:01.620 --> 01:56:02.620\nto his impossible,\n\n01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:04.620\neven an envelope that's inscrutable.\n\n01:56:06.620 --> 01:56:07.620\nHow many...\n\n01:56:07.620 --> 01:56:09.620\nI know that there's a way of knowing\n\n01:56:09.620 --> 01:56:11.620\nwith Hackeye's information\n\n01:56:11.620 --> 01:56:14.620\nhow many storage units?\n\n01:56:14.620 --> 01:56:15.620\n250.\n\n01:56:15.620 --> 01:56:16.620\n250.\n\n01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:17.620\nAll right.\n\n01:56:17.620 --> 01:56:20.620\nSo, a cricket crawls a maximum of\n\n01:56:20.620 --> 01:56:23.620\nthree feet per minute.\n\n01:56:24.620 --> 01:56:26.620\nI don't think that's an option.\n\n01:56:27.620 --> 01:56:29.620\nEveryone's response to that was amazing.\n\n01:56:29.620 --> 01:56:31.620\nLike, that's the most controversial thing\n\n01:56:31.620 --> 01:56:32.620\nI've ever said.\n\n01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:33.620\nIt really is.\n\n01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:34.620\nI think a cricket crawls...\n\n01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:35.620\nThree feet a minute.\n\n01:56:35.620 --> 01:56:36.620\nI think a cricket crawls...\n\n01:56:36.620 --> 01:56:38.620\nIt's more of snail speed, huh?\n\n01:56:38.620 --> 01:56:39.620\nYeah, it's not fast.\n\n01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:40.620\nOkay, man.\n\n01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:41.620\nI have the data.\n\n01:56:41.620 --> 01:56:42.620\nI've looked at the data.\n\n01:56:42.620 --> 01:56:43.620\nSpencer, how many rooms has it had?\n\n01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:44.620\nFrom Brandeis University,\n\n01:56:44.620 --> 01:56:46.620\nand crickets are able to go about 15 meters.\n\n01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:48.620\nWhether they're not, you know...\n\n01:56:48.620 --> 01:56:49.620\nSpencer, how many rooms has the cricket been through?\n\n01:56:49.620 --> 01:56:51.620\nWhat percentage of those 250 has he gone through?\n\n01:56:51.620 --> 01:56:53.620\nYou don't know.\n\n01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:56.620\nI mean, it's a cricket.\n\n01:56:56.620 --> 01:56:57.620\nYou sent him out.\n\n01:56:57.620 --> 01:56:58.620\nYou brought him back.\n\n01:56:58.620 --> 01:56:59.620\nHe said he found crickets.\n\n01:56:59.620 --> 01:57:01.620\nOkay, at the risk of draining myself more,\n\n01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:02.620\ncan I summon three more crickets\n\n01:57:02.620 --> 01:57:04.620\nand triple the speed on this?\n\n01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:05.620\nYou know, it'd be great.\n\n01:57:05.620 --> 01:57:06.620\nWhat?\n\n01:57:06.620 --> 01:57:07.620\nHow much does 250 cost?\n\n01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:10.620\nSend one cricket into fucking every single room.\n\n01:57:10.620 --> 01:57:12.620\nThat would probably drain me to death.\n\n01:57:12.620 --> 01:57:13.620\nYeah, probably.\n\n01:57:13.620 --> 01:57:16.620\nI took three or four drain on one cricket.\n\n01:57:16.620 --> 01:57:17.620\nCan you...\n\n01:57:17.620 --> 01:57:19.620\nCan I get 12 drain or something?\n\n01:57:19.620 --> 01:57:20.620\nAre we going to get sued?\n\n01:57:20.620 --> 01:57:21.620\nWhat?\n\n01:57:21.620 --> 01:57:22.620\nNo.\n\n01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:23.620\nNo, we haven't played shit.\n\n01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:25.620\nWe haven't even done anything.\n\n01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:27.620\nI walk up to one of the storage lockers,\n\n01:57:27.620 --> 01:57:28.620\nand I take my gun,\n\n01:57:28.620 --> 01:57:31.620\nand I shoot at the...\n\n01:57:31.620 --> 01:57:33.620\nThe lock?\n\n01:57:33.620 --> 01:57:34.620\nThe lock.\n\n01:57:34.620 --> 01:57:35.620\nYes, thank you.\n\n01:57:35.620 --> 01:57:36.620\nThat's the word I was looking for.\n\n01:57:36.620 --> 01:57:38.620\nYou shoot the lock off the storage container,\n\n01:57:38.620 --> 01:57:42.620\nand the roller door rolls up.\n\n01:57:42.620 --> 01:57:45.620\nWe've got 249 more.\n\n01:57:45.620 --> 01:57:50.620\nWell, look around and see if you see any MP3s in there.\n\n01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:51.620\nI look around.\n\n01:57:51.620 --> 01:57:57.620\nYou see stacks upon stacks of anorandac chairs.\n\n01:57:57.620 --> 01:58:03.620\nWe'll come back for these later.\n\n01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:05.620\nLet's thank Pat and Hannah, our newly engaged,\n\n01:58:05.620 --> 01:58:08.620\nnewly athiasts,\n\n01:58:08.620 --> 01:58:11.620\nDisney-loving New

his weird pirate shirts\n\n01:58:43.620 --> 01:58:50.620\nand jaw-grinding emotional things.\n\n01:58:50.620 --> 01:58:52.620\nAnd also, Kris Boruff, Kevin Day, Sarah Hill,\n\n01:58:52.620 -->

tenuousness.\n\n01:58:56.620 --> 01:58:58.620\nNo, sorry, I was finishing the sentence.\n\n01:58:58.620 --> 01:59:00.620\nI started 10 minutes ago.\n\n01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:01.620\nAll right, drive fast and take chances.\n\n01:59:01.620 --> 01:59:02.620\nThank you for coming, everybody.\n\n01:59:02.620 --> 01:59:04.620\nAre we the best of Shadowrunner?\n\n01:59:04.620 -->
