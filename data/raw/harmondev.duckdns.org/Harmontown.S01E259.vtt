{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:25.000\nLadies and gentlemen, Armageddon is now in session!\n\n00:25.000 --> 00:31.000\nWelcome to a beautiful Uptown Burbank!\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:36.000\nLadies and gentlemen, I am Rob Schrab and I'm going to be filling in for Jeff Davis.\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:38.000\nCome, Troy, thank you!\n\n00:41.000 --> 00:45.000\nLet's bring up Spencer Crittenden!\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:58.000\nAnd the mayor of Harmontown himself, Mr. Dan Harmon!\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:03.000\nThank you.\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:09.000\nOh man, I totally crashed after that.\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:12.000\nOh yeah, you're all out of energy now?\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:17.000\nYou really pumped him up, you warmed him up.\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:23.000\nHey, I was talking to Cody about this, I was talking to her about masturbation.\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:24.000\nOkay.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:34.000\nAnd I was telling her about a trick that you told me you used when you would walk home from school.\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:39.000\nI've done this like 18 times on many different podcasts.\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:40.000\nOh okay.\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:41.000\nDid you talk about it on this one?\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:44.000\nI probably did, but we could do it again.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:46.000\nThe fake arm?\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:51.000\nOh yeah, I was a da Vinci of jerking off.\n\n01:51.000 --> 02:02.000\nI had, well we had the parkas, so it's like winter and you're walking home and you're in eighth grade\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:06.000\nso everything makes you horny and you just want to jerk off and you can't wait until you get home.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:16.000\nSo I would slit my hand out of my sleeve and have like the empty sleeve in my pocket and my hand on my pants\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:25.000\nand was jerking off as I was walking home because I couldn't wait 10 minutes.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:32.000\nAnd Cody said, why not just use the bathroom at the school?\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:34.000\nOh yeah, I did that too.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:36.000\nYeah, I was trying to explain to her.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:40.000\nDude, don't you know that there's not a bathroom on the way home?\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:42.000\nThere's sidewalks.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:45.000\nYeah, I mean I would run home.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:53.000\nOne day, fifth grade, just bing and then I thought I invented it and then I just started hanging out.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:56.000\nAnd I would just run, I would sprint home.\n\n02:56.000 --> 03:04.000\nAnd everybody would be like, hey Dan, I'd run home and I'd just like rip off all my clothes and hump every pillow in the house\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:06.000\nlooking at Penny from Inspector Gadget.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:09.000\nDid you think you were...\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:12.000\nI was her age.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:14.000\nIt was romantic.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:16.000\nIt was like remains of the day.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:18.000\nDid you think like...\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:24.000\nWe grew up together in a society that kept us apart.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:27.000\nI used to think, I'm feeling you're probably the same way.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:32.000\nLike I used to feel like, man, I am so good at jerking off.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:34.000\nLike nobody knows I'm doing it.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:37.000\nLike I could be in the...\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:38.000\nI go to that.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:41.000\nNobody, I'm so smooth, I've got it all figured out.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:43.000\nAnd then you get to be an adult.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:47.000\nNo, everybody knew you were jerking off constantly.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:50.000\nThey just didn't want to go stop.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:52.000\nYeah, no one wants to acknowledge.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:54.000\nNo one wants to say I know what you're doing.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:58.000\nBut I've talked about this on the podcast.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:00.000\nIt's like I had an unusual...\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:04.000\nThe only reason I didn't use the arm trick, which I did as an adult, by the way.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:11.000\nI remembered you telling me about doing it walking home and I was in my car and I was like, I'm out of control.\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:14.000\nI got to do something and it's rush hour and I just like...\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:17.000\nI made a little fake arm and I tried jerking off in the car.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:18.000\nYou tried?\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:20.000\nIn the middle of Los Angeles traffic.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:22.000\nI can't even remember if I succeeded or if...\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:24.000\nI really can't remember.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:27.000\nAnd then Cody's like, why wouldn't you just pull over?\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:33.000\nAnd I'm like, once you pull over and you're just like, here's breath away from sex offender.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:35.000\nAnd then she told me this story.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:37.000\nShe's like, you're right.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:42.000\nShe was walking and there's probably women in the audience right here that this has happened to.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:43.000\nIt's all too common.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:47.000\nShe was walking and some guy said, hey, come here.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:56.000\nAnd he was in his car with the window down and she went over and he had his dick in his hand and he was wrenching at it.\n\n04:56.000 --> 05:00.000\nAnd she was like, ah, what? Fuck you. You piece of shit. God damn it.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:03.000\nAnd then he just drove off.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:06.000\nDoes he do that all night?\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:08.000\nAnd then like, does he eventually come?\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:10.000\nLike the next block down?\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:11.000\nExcuse me.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:12.000\nYou!\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:19.000\nWell, I mean, obviously he's not trolling for someone who's like into it.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:27.000\nHe probably knows that the person's going to go gross, stop it, no police.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:32.000\nAnd that's the only thing that can get them going, which makes me feel a little bad for them.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:35.000\nSmallest violin.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:49.000\nBut, you know, when your kinks involve social taboos, societal taboos, I do feel bad for those people because I'm sure if they could flip a switch, they'd change it.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:50.000\nI don't know.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:51.000\nI'm sure they would.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:55.000\nThere are some issues.\n\n05:55.000 --> 06:03.000\nBut anyways, as I've explained to you and explained to them, for part of my childhood, I can't remember when I was finally just like,\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:06.000\nwhat are you doing? Just use your hand like a fucking person.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:16.000\nI had this hang up about masturbation, so I had myself convinced that what I was doing when I was masturbating was not masturbation because I was humping things.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:32.000\nSo, then I remember like being like, I don't know, 11, and I was sleeping in the same living room as my uncle,\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:33.000\nmy dad.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:35.000\nWe were at my grandma's cottage.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:37.000\nThat makes this sound so fancy.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:42.000\nNot the word I would have picked.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:44.000\nMy grandma had this cottage.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:45.000\nShe was sleeping in her room.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:49.000\nMy dad was sleeping in the only other room, so I was sharing the living room with my uncle.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:50.000\nI had a cot.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:51.000\nI was 11.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:57.000\nI was at the peak of my, you know, I was into two things.\n\n06:57.000 --> 06:59.000\nEnder's game and humping stuff.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:04.000\nAnd I was all done with Ender's game.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:07.000\nThat'd be a good double feature though.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:11.000\nI'm here to read Ender's game and hump stuff.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:15.000\nAnd Ender's game is a short book.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:19.000\nSo, I just started like, I'm just like humping the cot.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:20.000\nIt's like, it's just quiet.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:21.000\nWe're in the country.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:25.000\nThere's crickets, and then there's just this squeaking cot.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:29.000\nAnd I'm just like, I can only remember it.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:31.000\nI can't even relate to it as an adult talking about it.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:35.000\nAnd obviously, we can't talk to an 11-year-old about it.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:39.000\nBut I just, you know, some of you were 11-year-old boys.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:44.000\nAnd you remember kind of vaguely how it was just, it must have just been,\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:47.000\nbecause you're so small, and the hormones are so new,\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:49.000\nand they make up 90% of your bloodstream,\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:51.000\nand you're just like a paneling nail.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:52.000\nYou're just everywhere you go.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:56.000\nYou're just nailing stuff, and like, you just can't, it never stops.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.000\nAnd you're just like, you love it, and you hate it,\n\n07:58.000 --> 07:59.000\nand you're a slave to it.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:02.000\nAnd then I was just like, I was like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:03.000\nYou know, on the cot.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:06.000\nAnd I was just, you know, trying in vain to like not,\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:10.000\nit's like my uncle's kind of like tossing and turning and snoring.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:14.000\nAnd then he just like, after a really long, arduous time,\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:17.000\nhe like, he sat up, and I froze.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:20.000\nAnd then he like, made a big deal out of like going to the bathroom.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:22.000\nAnd he took a really long time.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:26.000\nAnd I truly do think, I think he was like, Jesus Christ,\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:30.000\nif I pretend to take a shit, will you finish?\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nI really think that's what he was doing,\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:35.000\nbut I just froze because I was like, oh God,\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nI was thinking, is that what's happening?\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:38.000\nDid he hear me?\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:39.000\nWas he awake the whole time?\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nAnd now is that what he's doing?\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:44.000\nAnd it took me so long to just deal with that humiliation\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:46.000\nthat he eventually came back.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:51.000\nAnd then I was like, well, he must have been so pissed.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:54.000\nLike, are you kidding me?\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:59.000\nWell, you didn't have bunk beds like Jeff and I did.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:00.000\nJeff, your brother.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:01.000\nMy brother.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:04.000\nMy brother was on the bottom bunk.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:08.000\nSo what are you, what, you guys just listened to each other?\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:11.000\nOh, I didn't, he listened to me.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:14.000\nProblem, I mean, I mean, just because I was a,\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:16.000\nyou know, I was a mantras-humper too.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:18.000\nSo it's just like, I'm just picturing,\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:20.000\nand I felt like, man, nobody knows,\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nI'm so fucking good at this.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nI'm like, smooth, man, smooth operator.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nAnd he's probably, and you know, Jeff,\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:30.000\nhe's not gonna let go, hey, hey, enough.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:33.000\nCome on, you know?\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:35.000\nSo people gotta work for our living, you know?\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:40.000\nLike, but, poor Jeff, he's got like the spring mantras,\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:47.000\nwhich is probably, oh, jeez, oh, dear.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:48.000\nAnd he's your older brother.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:49.000\nOlder brother.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:50.000\nSo he's sitting down there going,\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:51.000\nOh, boy.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\nWhat did I miss?\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:56.000\nYou know, like, why isn't he doing it too?\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:58.000\nMaybe he was, I didn't know.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:04.000\nSound travels downward.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:08.000\nAll right, well, yeah, there's not much of a show tonight,\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:10.000\nbut as you can see, it's a...\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:11.000\nBecause I'm here.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:12.000\nJeff's gone.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:15.000\nWe replaced him with Schrab.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:19.000\nDuncan Tressel was, I told him come to the show,\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:21.000\nbut I think he might be just like...\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:23.000\nHe might be at Meltdown going, look a fool.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:24.000\nYeah.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:25.000\nI mean, that's no joke.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:26.000\nThat could be the case.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:27.000\nSo empty, empty.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nI did his podcast, and you know,\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nand I was like, you should come do mine,\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:32.000\nbut whatever.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:35.000\nI hear you watched Old It recently.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:36.000\nOld It?\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:39.000\nYeah, I watched the old Stephen King's It.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:40.000\nGot caught up on that.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:41.000\nYeah.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:43.000\nIn anticipation of the new Stephen King's It.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:44.000\nYep.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nOld It versus New It.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:48.000\nI've seen Old It a lot.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:51.000\nI probably watched it with you a bunch of times,\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:56.000\nand I've just saw the new It like last weekend.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:57.000\nYou saw the new one?\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:58.000\nI saw the new It, yes.\n\n10:58.000 --> 10:59.000\nDo they all float?\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.000\nThey do.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:02.000\nThey do.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:06.000\nBut what did you say about the Old It?\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:08.000\nNot much.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:10.000\nCody watched it with me, and she's like,\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:11.000\nnobody floated.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:12.000\nNo.\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:13.000\nShe kept saying they all float down here.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:14.000\nThere was never any...\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:17.000\nThey all float down here.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:21.000\nAnd we have talked about the fact that in the book,\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:24.000\nthe boys all have sex with the girl.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:25.000\nRight.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:26.000\nWhen they're kids.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:27.000\nBecause it's her idea.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:31.000\nShe goes, well, one thing left to do.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:35.000\nThe only way to get out of this sewer dimension is to,\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:38.000\nwell, all right.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:40.000\nAnd all the boys are going, Jesus Christ,\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:41.000\nare you serious?\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:43.000\nI was thinking about Stephen King.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:45.000\nIt's like, it's hard to put your finger on what he's good\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:46.000\nand bad at, but like...\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:47.000\nYeah.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:49.000\nHe's like...\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:51.000\nI think if he was sitting here,\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:53.000\nhe would be like, yeah, that's true.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:54.000\nI don't...\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:55.000\nYeah.\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:59.000\nI know his origin story has something to do with,\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nas I've said, like, I think, you know,\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:05.000\nin the Marvel movie where Stephen King is a hero\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:06.000\nin the first 20 minutes,\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nhe's like carrying his typewriter and he drops it\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:11.000\nand the backspace key flies off.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:17.000\nAnd it's just like, God...\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:18.000\nBut I have to turn in a...\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:20.000\nOh, and then he's like...\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:21.000\nIt's gonna be a thousand pages long.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nHoly shit!\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:26.000\nYou can make it up as you go!\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:30.000\nIt's gonna be a thousand pages long.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:32.000\nI think he'd agree with that.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:34.000\nI don't think he'd be offended by that.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:40.000\nIt's one thing about, like, the scene in the book\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:42.000\nwhere all...\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:43.000\nHow many boys are there?\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:44.000\nIt's like, Beverly...\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:45.000\nHow many?\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:46.000\nSix.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:47.000\nSix.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:48.000\nFive?\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:49.000\nSix?\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nLet's say five.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:53.000\nThey, like, Beverly starts taking off her clothes\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:55.000\nand they're like, oh, holy shit,\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:56.000\nI guess we're gonna have to...\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:59.000\nI guess we're gonna have to have sex with her.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nBut aren't they like 10?\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:02.000\nThey're 11.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:06.000\nOkay, alright.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:08.000\nAnd I would be...\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:09.000\nI was like, okay, gross,\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:11.000\nand I understand you're doing exploitation.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:15.000\nYou could have wrote fade out, fade up.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:16.000\nThey're all putting their sneakers on\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:18.000\nand going, wow, that was terrific,\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:19.000\nand now we can get out of the sewer.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:24.000\nBut page after page of description\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:29.000\nand commenting on sizes and shit and going,\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:33.000\nI'm like, okay, I really don't need to know\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nthat the fat kid has the biggest dick.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:36.000\nIt's like, it's like, smash fiction,\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:38.000\nbut his favorite show is Children.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:41.000\nLike, it's like...\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nBut, you know, I mean, that being said,\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:45.000\nI'd be like...\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:48.000\nI love Stephen King.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:50.000\nIt's the only thing, it's like,\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:52.000\nwhen you watch the old it,\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:54.000\nwhich is available on your little consoles.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:56.000\nAnd it's not called the old it.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:58.000\nSo when you're typing it in,\n\n13:58.000 --> 13:59.000\nI keep typing in the old it,\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:01.000\nand it's not showing up.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:02.000\nIt's just it.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:04.000\nIt's two-part miniseries.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:05.000\nIt's done in 1998.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:06.000\nYou should be aware of the studio\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:08.000\nthat makes those sort of, like,\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:10.000\nAfrican-American recreations of, like,\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:12.000\nabout last night and stuff like that.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:17.000\nThere's a black it called...\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:21.000\nBlack-ish.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:22.000\nYou had a bit.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:23.000\nI know, I didn't have a bit,\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nbut Jesus Christ.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:26.000\nI know.\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:28.000\nThat's just the name of a show.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:30.000\nAnd it sounds like black it.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:32.000\nMy...\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:33.000\nYou know.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:34.000\nI just say stuff.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:35.000\nYou just see a dot,\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:36.000\nyou just connect the one you're on.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:37.000\nYeah.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:38.000\nYeah.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:40.000\nIt's Stephen King of talking.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:42.000\nI don't have a backspace.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:44.000\nAnd who here is a time-spenser?\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:45.000\nHow are you?\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:46.000\nHey, guys.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:47.000\nYeah.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:48.000\nI just...\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:49.000\nEverything...\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nThis is the thing that I think Stephen King\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:52.000\nis either good or bad at,\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:53.000\nbut in any case,\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:56.000\nit's an extreme condition he has.\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:57.000\nEverything's a device.\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nEverything's like a crucifix.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:00.000\nEverything's a...\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:03.000\nThere's, like, 90 things in it\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:08.000\nthat if you use the power of positivity\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:09.000\nor whatever,\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:13.000\nif you recite the birds in your Boy Scout manual,\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:17.000\nit makes the Tim Curry clown go away.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:20.000\nIf you just aren't afraid,\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:23.000\nif you just hold hands and ignore everything,\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:26.000\nit can only hurt you if you pay attention.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:29.000\nIf you have an asthma inhaler,\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:32.000\nyou can just say it's acid and squirt it.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:34.000\nIt's a slingshot.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:35.000\nIt's silver.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nAnd every step of the way,\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:39.000\nbecause he doesn't want to go back\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nand refine anything,\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:42.000\npeople are just like,\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:43.000\nhey, I brought a slingshot\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.000\nand I brought my mom's earrings.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:46.000\nThey're silver.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:47.000\nHow do we know that'll work?\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:49.000\nIf we believe it, it'll work.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:50.000\nOh, fuck you.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:52.000\nFuck you.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:53.000\nBut you have...\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:56.000\nDo you have a favorite Stephen King,\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nlike, adaptation book or something?\n\n15:58.000 --> 15:59.000\nI mean...\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:00.000\nI've always said,\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:02.000\nI liked his stuff when he was, like, a kid.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:04.000\nLike, when you read those Bakman books.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:05.000\nLike, the long walk,\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:08.000\nI thought it was just, like, really simple and granular.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.000\nIt's like, you know, 100 kids,\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nand they walk until one of them's left,\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:14.000\nand if you drop below 10 miles an hour walking,\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:16.000\nthey shoot your brains out.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:17.000\nUh-huh.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:18.000\nThat's cool.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:19.000\nI like Carrie.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:20.000\nI think Carrie...\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:21.000\nCarrie, the book is great.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:22.000\nYeah.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:23.000\nOkay.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:24.000\nWell...\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:29.000\nRemember when I told you about the library policeman?\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:32.000\nWhen I was listening to...\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\nI was listening to the book on tape,\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:35.000\nThe Library Policeman,\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:37.000\nwhich is a short story\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.000\nwhere there's this guy who's like,\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:42.000\noh, man, something bad happened to me as a kid.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:44.000\nI can't recall it because I blocked it,\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:46.000\nand it's the thing, I have to get over this fear.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nOtherwise, I'm gonna...\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:51.000\nI won't be able to kill this monster in the library.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:53.000\nHow am I gonna get over this thing\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:55.000\nthat I can't remember that happened to me as a kid?\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:56.000\nYou know?\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:58.000\nAnd I'm listening to it for, like, days,\n\n16:58.000 --> 16:59.000\nbecause on the way to work,\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:00.000\nI would listen to it, like, you know,\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:01.000\nlike 20 minutes at a time.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:04.000\nAnd finally, it was, like, the chapter where we...\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:06.000\nhe meets up with him.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:08.000\nLike, he faces this fear.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:11.000\nAnd Kate and I were, like, going to a party,\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nand we go, hey, hun, you know,\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:16.000\nI just really want to know what happens here.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:18.000\nDo you mind if I just play this on the way?\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:19.000\nYeah, I don't give a fuck.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:20.000\nWhatever, do whatever you want.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:21.000\nI don't give a shit.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:22.000\nAll right?\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:23.000\nAll right.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:26.000\nI'm like, oh, thanks, hunny, I love you.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:29.000\nAnd then it goes into, again,\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\ngreat detail about how, when he was eight years old,\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:35.000\nhe was molested by this guy in the bushes\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:38.000\nand just describing in great detail\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:40.000\nabout, like, how the warm jelly went up his ass.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:41.000\nAnd I'm just...\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:46.000\nAnd it's just, like, a quiet drive.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:49.000\nAnd it's like, I don't want to press stop\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.000\nbecause that's admitting that this is gross\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:52.000\nand whatever.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:56.000\nAnd Kate is just, like...\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:59.000\nI'm fucking married to this guy.\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:00.000\nThis is what I...\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:02.000\nI guess I signed up for this.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:05.000\nWho was reading the book on tape?\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:08.000\nOh, I forget his name, but it was...\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:11.000\nIt was the guy who played the white shadow.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:13.000\nRemember the TV series, the white shadow?\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:14.000\nMm-hmm.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:16.000\nYou guys remember the white shadow from the 70s?\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:17.000\nIt's a sh...\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:18.000\nOkay, all right.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:19.000\nIt was that guy.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nHe was a white basketball coach\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:23.000\nand then his mostly black...\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:24.000\nHas that high school?\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:26.000\nI think a high school basketball team.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:29.000\nI believe it was a high school basketball team.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nAnd it was called the white shadow.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:33.000\nIt was called the white shadow.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:37.000\nLittle, little, little playing with the concepts of...\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:38.000\nShadows are usually...\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:39.000\nBlack and white.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:42.000\nNot white.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:45.000\nThey're the opposite.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:47.000\nHi, Spencer.\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:50.000\nHey, guys, yeah.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:52.000\nSpencer, if you watch...\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:53.000\nIf you're like a 10-year-old black kid\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:54.000\nand you're watching that show in the 70s,\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:56.000\nyou're like, the white shadow.\n\n18:56.000 --> 19:01.000\nOh, I get it because I'm like a shadow person.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:04.000\nSomething like that every day.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:06.000\nEvery cereal box is a minefield.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:10.000\nEvery conversation, like...\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:12.000\nThat's what I'm...\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:15.000\nWhy are you guys reacting to that observation\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:20.000\nas if I did something wrong?\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:23.000\nIs it just because you are scared\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:26.000\nthat now at the end of the world,\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:28.000\nsomeone's gonna mention, by the way,\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:31.000\nwe were kind of mean to black people?\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:33.000\nLike, that would make up the apocalypse.\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:35.000\nA little worse.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:36.000\nA little awkward.\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:38.000\nA little party foul during Armageddon.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:40.000\nParty foul.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:42.000\nOops, party foul.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:44.000\nWe should do that as the...\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:45.000\nJust give me a second.\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:48.000\nOkay.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:50.000\nI want to make this incredibly clear to you.\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:55.000\nI don't fucking care about your opinions anymore.\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:57.000\nYou're terrible people.\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:59.000\nYou're dumb.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:03.000\nYou're impressionable, manipulatable, and stupid.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:06.000\nI know that seems like I've added, like, a synonym for dumb,\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:08.000\nbut it's two different things.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:09.000\nYou have no voice.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:11.000\nYou have no brain.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:13.000\nYou're bad people.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:16.000\nYou're a biomass of closet murderers.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:20.000\nYou're only held in check by your fear.\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:22.000\nFuck off.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:26.000\nOur next guest is performing at...\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:28.000\nClubs and colleges all across the nation.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:31.000\nPlease welcome Eddie Pepitone!\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:36.000\nYes!\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:39.000\nAll right.\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:40.000\nFollow that.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:42.000\nFollow that.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:43.000\nFollow that.\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:44.000\nHi, Spencer.\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:45.000\nOh, I can see Spencer now.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:46.000\nHi, Spencer.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:47.000\nOh.\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:48.000\nHi, Edward.\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:49.000\nHello.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:50.000\nEdward.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:51.000\nHello.\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:52.000\nEdward, how are you?\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:53.000\nYou look great, man.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:54.000\nWhat's going on?\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:55.000\nWhat are you doing?\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:59.000\nI'm doing stand-up right here, actually,\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:01.000\nevery Wednesday night.\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:03.000\nI'm doing stand-up all over town.\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:07.000\nI'm exploring stand-up, you know?\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:13.000\nYeah, because, no, a lot of people think stand-up is just set-up punchline.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:18.000\nI think it's an enormous cry for help.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:23.000\nAnd it's tricky to make that funny, you know?\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:32.000\nBut just put my id on stage and kind of try not to be embarrassed about it.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:34.000\nHow old were you when you started stand-up?\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:35.000\nHow old was I?\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:36.000\nYeah, how old were you?\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:37.000\n57.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:38.000\n57.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:39.000\nYou started?\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:40.000\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:41.000\nBoy, that fell flat.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:44.000\nHi, everybody!\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:46.000\nFuck you!\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:47.000\nThere you go.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nHow is this room for stand-up?\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:51.000\nYou've been doing it here for several sets.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:53.000\nIt's got to be awful, right?\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:54.000\nLike, high ceilings.\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:58.000\nWell, everybody says the high ceilings, but I like it.\n\n21:58.000 --> 21:59.000\nI like it, actually.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:03.000\nI don't know if it's just the vibe of the place.\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:09.000\nAnd as far as stand-up goes, it's not so much what counts as high ceilings,\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:11.000\nbut who is in the audience.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:12.000\nRight.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:13.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:17.000\nI mean, at this show, it's been fine, because if it's a big, giant room with high ceilings,\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:21.000\nand then there's like 200 people, okay, so it's like a town hall or whatever,\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:23.000\nand also not doing stand-up.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:26.000\nBut I wonder, yeah, about people.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:29.000\nBut I want to let you know, and I could do this offstage, too,\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:31.000\nbut I don't really have anything to talk about on stage.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:38.000\nBut we're putting the money that we make off of the ticket stuff here.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:45.000\nWe're going to be working on making kind of convertible, adjustable things.\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:46.000\nOh, really?\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:50.000\nAnd fine-tune the acoustic and optical appearance.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:51.000\nMake it more intimate.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:55.000\nYeah, I want this place to be able to do a show with 30 people in the audience.\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:57.000\nThat's perfect for me.\n\n22:57.000 --> 23:04.000\nThat's a little much, 30, but if you could get it down to 15, 20, that would be perfect.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:08.000\nBut then from what I understand, music is like, oh, yeah, no,\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:12.000\nfucking do it in a big, giant warehouse, that's best for music.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:19.000\nSo I want to be able to hoist a chain and make it conducive to a punk band,\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:24.000\nbecause I'm so enthusiastic about the music scene.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:25.000\nMe, too.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:29.000\nI'm up on all, you know, every punk band there is.\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:31.000\nWhat's your favorite punk band?\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:32.000\nRight now?\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:33.000\nRight now.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:34.000\nDirty rats.\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:35.000\nThe dirty rats.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:39.000\nThey're all Cagney impersonators, and they're fucking brilliant.\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:44.000\nLike, you, you dirty fucking rat, you dirty fucking rat,\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:47.000\nand they just go on and on like that.\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:49.000\nIt's all about vermin, it's good.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:53.000\nIs that Spotify?\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:54.000\nYes.\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:59.000\nBy the way, I was listening to Stalin on Pandora on the way over,\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:04.000\nand that's just a sample of what you get when you come see me.\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:07.000\nI have a little dictator playlist on Pandora.\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:10.000\nYou're kind of holding in your laughter.\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:13.000\nI'm holding in my laughter, yeah.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:16.000\nNo, I'm thinking of what I'm going to say next.\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:19.000\nThat's why I'm a bad interviewer.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:23.000\nBut I've heard, because you're doing these shows here,\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:28.000\nthis is no different from anywhere else you're doing shows, I'm sure.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:32.000\nYou're like, I feel like one of the cool things about you is that you're like,\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:36.000\nyou've got your strong material, but then you're Eddie Pepitone.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:41.000\nIf you go off the rails, it's kind of exciting.\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:42.000\nThat's what I do.\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:44.000\nThat's what I like to do.\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:50.000\nI started, I think I started, I've been getting into these riffs about the hurricanes.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:56.000\nI want to try to provoke a riff, but I know that that won't work,\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:58.000\nlike if I announce that as my goal.\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:09.000\nI mean, I could. I was just getting into the ghoulishness of the coverage of the hurricanes.\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:19.000\nFirst, it was Harvey, and how I get attracted to the hurricane, like following the hurricane.\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:28.000\nThey get to it early, CNN, the weather channel, and they're like, look at this.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:32.000\nThey don't say fuck, but they're like, look at this fucking.\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:38.000\nThat's not a good face, by the way, to be like, yeah, that's better.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:43.000\nHoly shit, I looked over Rob, you look like God.\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:47.000\nNot another hurricane story.\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:49.000\nIt is kind of insane in general.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:54.000\nThe storm stuff, that stems from just this general thing where your local news,\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:59.000\nif something happened at a school, someone stabbed someone with a pencil,\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:04.000\na school behind me, like they take the van out, the satellite dish goes up,\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:08.000\nbut it's like no one's getting stabbed now.\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:12.000\nThere's just rows of white vans, and there's all these people,\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:15.000\nand they're just at the place where the stabbing took place.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:22.000\nThere's absolutely zero chance that it's going to be important to be at that location in a journalistic sense.\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:31.000\nThere's not even an example in history of like, oh, we just kind of do that because you never know.\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:33.000\nThere's nothing to never know.\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:35.000\nI found an eraser.\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:38.000\nI found a clue, ladies and gentlemen, that's the police's job.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:40.000\nYou're not out there for any reason.\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:45.000\nAnd then the storms happen, and it's just people being blown by wind.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:51.000\nIt was hilarious because when the storms happen, and they live for this,\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:56.000\nwhat I hate about it is that they're always like, be safe.\n\n26:56.000 --> 27:00.000\nThey're always like, please, be safe, be safe.\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:06.000\nOh my God, I hope this hurricane doesn't hit land, but it's the opposite.\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:13.000\nThey love it, they love it because it's just a spectacle, and that's what news media is about.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:15.000\nThat's what the whole world has become about.\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:17.000\nIt's all spectacle.\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:19.000\nHold on.\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:21.000\nYou wanted to provoke something.\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:23.000\nLet him talk.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:25.000\nFor Christ's sake.\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:27.000\nLet him talk.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:30.000\nFor once.\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:32.000\nAnd I masturbate too.\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:35.000\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:40.000\nI still run home and do it.\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:45.000\nBut I mean, so they're always like, be safe, be safe.\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:49.000\nAnd they're like, nobody should be out here, but they are out there, and it's hilarious.\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:54.000\nNobody should be out here having fun but me.\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:56.000\nJim Cantori.\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:58.000\nIt was very funny.\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:08.000\nJim Cantori is apparently like, it is very funny too that he's like the dean of TV meteorologists, you know, for whatever reason.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:10.000\nThe dean of TV?\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:11.000\nWell, you know what I mean?\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:15.000\nLike people referred him like, what does Jim think about this storm?\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:18.000\nWhat does the dean think about this meteorology?\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:19.000\nI think he said the king.\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:21.000\nI don't think he ever said the dean.\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:23.000\nDid you ever said the dean?\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:24.000\nI did.\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:25.000\nDid you say the dean?\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:26.000\nYeah.\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:27.000\nOkay.\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:28.000\nOh, shit.\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:30.000\nOh, no.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:31.000\nOh, no.\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:35.000\nWhat did I, what did I, oh, you were going to correct me?\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:36.000\nAnd you were wrong.\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:37.000\nI was trying to help you.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:38.000\nAnd you were wrong.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:39.000\nI was trying to help you.\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:41.000\nYou told these people they're stupid.\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:42.000\nThey are.\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:43.000\nGo for your stupid.\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:44.000\nYou're stupid.\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:50.000\nYou didn't hear what he said, and you're closer to him.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:57.000\nThat's not making them any smarter, and I was trying to help you and made a mistake.\n\n28:57.000 --> 29:00.000\nYou're revealing that you're a bad person too.\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:04.000\nI thought that you needed help and helped you.\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:06.000\nDon't fight mommy and daddy.\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:07.000\nDon't fight.\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:09.000\nI don't believe you.\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:10.000\nI don't believe you.\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:11.000\nYou don't, but wait.\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:12.000\nI don't believe you.\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:17.000\nYou thought I was trying to capitalize on your, your weakness?\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:19.000\nLook what you're doing.\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:21.000\nLook what you're doing.\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:25.000\nI have my nice hat on and you're fighting.\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:26.000\nI know, I know.\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:28.000\nIt's not, it's not your, it's not your fault.\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:29.000\nIt's not your fault.\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:30.000\nThank you.\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:31.000\nNow I feel, go ahead.\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:32.000\nI never got that when I was a kid.\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:33.000\nIt's not your fault.\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:35.000\nSo the Dean of Meteorology.\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:37.000\nHas anybody ever just died?\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:43.000\nLike, like, like, like the, I know, I mean, by gun, we have like horrible example, like\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:47.000\nthat guy just fucking, it's, it's like we're living in some weird dream.\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:54.000\nBecause that guy that shot, he shot a news crew while they were doing the news, you know,\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:56.000\nand like that happened recently.\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:57.000\nYeah.\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:58.000\nA couple years ago.\n\n29:58.000 --> 29:59.000\nYeah.\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:00.000\nOh, couple of years.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:01.000\nNow that to me, that's good news.\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:03.000\nLike that is good news.\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:04.000\nThat's real.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:05.000\nThat's really happening.\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:08.000\nBut they didn't know they were covering it.\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:11.000\nThey were, they didn't know they were covering it.\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:16.000\nThey were outside of school or someone got stabbed with a pencil three hours earlier.\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:18.000\nBut the, the, it's weird.\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:24.000\nLike, but we've never seen anybody like no one's ever as many storms as there's been.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:28.000\nI'm surprised that there hasn't been journalist fatalities, you know, from people like.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:29.000\nThat's true.\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:30.000\nStealing out in the 80 mile an hour winds.\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:32.000\nOh, I was so hoping.\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:34.000\nYeah, I was so hoping.\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:39.000\nI was so hoping that, you know, this guy, they had a couple of guys, but I was so hoping\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:42.000\nthey would just be carried the fucking away.\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:47.000\nAnd, and, and one guy, one guy did not vote Jim Cantori, the Dean.\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:49.000\nBy the way, when you say.\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:50.000\nWhy is he the Dean?\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:51.000\nNow I'm confused.\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:53.000\nWell, you've never heard that term.\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:58.000\nLike he is like, you know, the go to guy as far as meteorologists.\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:01.000\nSo you've never heard that, that little expression Dean.\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:03.000\nHave you ever been called into a Dean's office?\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:04.000\nIt's always a meteorologist.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:05.000\nI'm kidding.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:08.000\nThat would be funny if you would call.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:09.000\nHey, how are you?\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:11.000\nI'm all right.\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:16.000\nI feel like I got to keep him entertained, but um, no, because I looked at him and he\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:18.000\nhad his hand over his eyes.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:19.000\nNo, he's.\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:20.000\nYeah, you had that fucking look.\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:21.000\nThat's just him listening.\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:22.000\nIt's a, yeah.\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:29.000\nBut by the way, when you said you didn't say Dean, right, I want to be like so much by\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:31.000\neverybody that I was going.\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:33.000\nThere was a split second where I was going to go.\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:35.000\nNo, I didn't.\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:38.000\nThen I realized everybody else had heard it.\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:40.000\nYou were weighing whether to pretend you said King.\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:41.000\nAll right.\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:42.000\nI get it.\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:43.000\nYeah.\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:46.000\nI have been a slave to people's.\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:48.000\nLet me ask you this.\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:49.000\nYeah.\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:50.000\nOkay.\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:55.000\nPick your nose in front of a friend or a stranger that you'll never see again on the freeway,\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.000\nfor instance, like, like, like, like, which.\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nOh, you know, I, you know what's amazing?\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:01.000\nI've thought of that a lot.\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:07.000\nAnd I was preparing for the podcast, but I'm when, when I am on the, when I am on, uh,\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:14.000\nyou know, a street and I'm about to pick my nose in the car, I, I can't do it in front\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:15.000\nof a stranger.\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:16.000\nRight.\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:17.000\nI can't do it.\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:18.000\nBecause you'll never see them again.\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:19.000\nWhat is that about?\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:20.000\nHow sick is that?\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:21.000\nBut you'll, like, what is that about?\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:25.000\nI want to pick my nose in front of my girlfriend because I just don't want her to see me.\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nI just don't want to see a thing come out, but.\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:30.000\nWell, it depends on how late in the relationship it is.\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:33.000\nWe, we, we're, we're farting all over each other at this point.\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:38.000\nLike, like, like, and it's great, we're having a great time and that's just, uh, my, my,\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:40.000\nmy ex-wife, we, we did a thing like that.\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:44.000\nI, uh, Sarah Silverman, uh, had told me that she and Jimmy Kimmel never farted in front\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:45.000\nof each other.\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:49.000\nSo I tried it with, uh, Erin McGathy, you know, Aaron, my ex-wife, or maybe you don't\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:51.000\nput, you said you're a podcast maven.\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:54.000\nMaybe you know my ex-wife, but, but Aaron and I really never farted.\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:59.000\nYou know, there was a couple, a couple of accidents happened here and there, all Aaron.\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:02.000\nUm, uh, no, but, but, but, but we.\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:03.000\nBut we just did it.\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:05.000\nYou know, as I spent my marriage not farting.\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:06.000\nReally?\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:08.000\nAnd that's not why we got divorced.\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:10.000\nI was going to say.\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:11.000\nIt worked fine.\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:16.000\nIt was, I was, I'm surprised looking back that I was able to not fart in front of my\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:21.000\npartner for so long, given how much I fart with Cody.\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:23.000\nWe're just farting constantly.\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:28.000\nSo it's like, what was I, I don't know what natural human behavior is anymore.\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:33.000\nI don't even know what my body needed to do or what's healthy or what I just like now.\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:39.000\nWell, I think what you're talking about there, Dan, is, um, a great example of what we can\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:41.000\ndo when we put our mind to something.\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:47.000\nYou know, when we, when we introduce our will and with your ex-wife, you were exercising\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:48.000\ntremendous will.\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:49.000\nYeah.\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:50.000\nYeah.\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:54.000\nCause it's not like I was like in tremendous abdominal pain going like, oh, well, I made\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:55.000\nthis agreement.\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:58.000\nI don't remember really needing to fart.\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:00.000\nDid you like go into other rooms or?\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:01.000\nI would.\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:02.000\nYeah.\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:04.000\nSome, every once in a while it would be build up to a point.\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:06.000\nWould you cough to disguise it?\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:10.000\nI tell her I'm going to go fart, you know, like, but I just wouldn't do it in front of\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:11.000\nher.\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:12.000\nWhat about, what about your.\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:13.000\nOh wait.\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:14.000\nSame story.\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:17.000\nSarah said the same thing about like keeping the intimacy in your relationship.\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:19.000\nAnd Kate and I don't fart in front of each other.\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:20.000\nYou're still doing that.\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:21.000\nI'm still doing that.\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:22.000\nAnd it's been seven years.\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:24.000\nIs Sarah still with that guy?\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:25.000\nNo.\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:29.000\nWas she during the advice?\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:30.000\nWhat's that?\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:31.000\nWas she during the advice?\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:32.000\nYes.\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:33.000\nOh, okay.\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:34.000\nShe wasn't giving advice.\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:35.000\nShe was just.\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:36.000\nShe was just talking about.\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:38.000\nSomething that she was doing with her partner.\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:40.000\nAnd I thought I'd give it a try.\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:41.000\nYeah.\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:42.000\nAnd it worked.\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:43.000\nIt's not why we got divorced.\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:46.000\nAndy, you've done it for seven years and it's, and you're not getting divorced.\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:47.000\nMore than that.\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:48.000\nBut yeah.\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:50.000\nAt the same time, I can't believe it.\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:52.000\nJust like, I guess it's just, it's just a couple thing.\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:55.000\nMe and Cody are like, uh, let's fart.\n\n34:55.000 --> 35:00.000\nI have been forgetting to flush the toilet.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:03.000\nWhich is causing like.\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:04.000\nYou've been forgetting.\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:05.000\nIssues.\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:06.000\nYeah.\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:07.000\nI blame Wi-Fi.\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:12.000\nCause it's fucking up the bees.\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:15.000\nYou know, they can't find their way home now, right?\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:16.000\nThey're happening.\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:17.000\nThey're happening.\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:19.000\nThe Wi-Fi is screwing up the bees.\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:20.000\nRight.\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:22.000\nAnd this is what I'm telling Kate when she comes home.\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:24.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:30.000\nDid you dump a cup of coffee in the toilet?\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:32.000\nAnd a plate of spaghetti.\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:33.000\nOh shit.\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:35.000\nI forgot to flush the toilet.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:37.000\nEvery day you forget to flush the toilet.\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:41.000\nAnd I say, I think it's Wi-Fi.\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:46.000\nBecause bees are dying out because of Wi-Fi.\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:49.000\nThey, they get, it's their radar.\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:51.000\nThey find their way home.\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:55.000\nSo I'm thinking there's like a Wi-Fi pocket that is just\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:59.000\nbetween the office and the living room and the bedroom.\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:02.000\nThere's like a Bermuda triangle right where I'm going to the bathroom.\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:06.000\nAnd for some reason, you know, I get done.\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:08.000\nI also have the Brondle Swash.\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:09.000\nWhat?\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:11.000\nThe special toilet seat.\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:12.000\nRight.\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:14.000\nYou know my special toilet seat.\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:17.000\nWhat's your download speed like on the toilet?\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:20.000\nBecause you're saying the Wi-Fi is the strongest there.\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:22.000\nYou're referring to it as a Bermuda triangle.\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:24.000\nBut Wi-Fi wise, it's, it's Grand Central.\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:25.000\nIt's pretty good.\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:26.000\nIt's pretty good.\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:27.000\nIt's pretty good.\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:28.000\nOkay.\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:29.000\nYeah.\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:31.000\nBut I think it's making me forget to flush the toilet.\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:33.000\nBecause this is a recent thing.\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:36.000\nYou do a lot of computer work on the toilet?\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:37.000\nIs that what you're saying?\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:42.000\nYou're on the, you're on...\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:44.000\nSo you have a, he...\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:46.000\nI don't do computers on the toilet.\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:54.000\nHe has a special seat that's like a bidet extension upgrade on the seat.\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:55.000\nYeah.\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:57.000\nDo you wipe your ass with toilet paper?\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:58.000\nYeah.\n\n36:58.000 --> 36:59.000\nOkay.\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:00.000\nTo dry my ass.\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:02.000\nBecause it's beautifully clean now.\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:06.000\nYou've been getting up, wiping your ass, putting the toilet paper into the toilet.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:07.000\nRight.\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:08.000\nAnd somehow...\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:09.000\nJust walking out the door.\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:10.000\nI'm just walking away.\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:12.000\nLike I got to treat myself.\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:14.000\nIt may, don't you think it may be the bidet?\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:17.000\nIt comes home and opens up and it goes, what the fuck?\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:18.000\nSeriously?\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:19.000\nAgain.\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:21.000\nWhat's your, what's your offer?\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:22.000\nThis is the bidet.\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:23.000\nWell, I don't know.\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:25.000\nMaybe it's the bidet action that is...\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:32.000\nBut I've had this bidet for like, I've been, I had a bidet for like, like over like 10 years.\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:35.000\nI think it's funny you have a bidet by the way.\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:38.000\nAnd I don't consider you a man, like a real man.\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:39.000\nYeah.\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:41.000\nI would not watch a football game with you or...\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:42.000\nYeah.\n\n37:42.000 --> 37:45.000\nWhen you would go to the bathroom during the game, I would be like,\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:46.000\nHorrible.\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:48.000\nI would be like, let's get the fuck out of here.\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:49.000\nYeah.\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:50.000\nNo, no.\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:52.000\nDo you hear that stream of water, Al?\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:53.000\nYeah.\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:54.000\nAnyway, yeah.\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:57.000\nI'll press the button and it'll go beep and it'll go, I don't know why.\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:58.000\nIt goes beep?\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:00.000\nYeah, it goes beeps.\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:11.000\nI would be afraid of getting, I would be afraid of getting injured.\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:13.000\nThat's what, that's what the beeps for.\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:14.000\nWhat?\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:15.000\nThat's what the beeps for.\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:19.000\nAnd you love it.\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:22.000\nAnd then you dry off with the toilet paper and then you won't have...\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:24.000\nAnd then I walk the fuck out the door.\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:28.000\nBut this is, I've been, the bidet I've been using way longer.\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:30.000\nThis is a recent thing, like in the last two years.\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:32.000\nNo, not two.\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:35.000\nLast year, it's just been like kids like, what the fuck is...\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:37.000\nAnd I go, I'm so sorry, honey.\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:39.000\nI just, I don't know what, I thought I did, you know.\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:44.000\nYou're like, and now I'm so nervous about getting yelled at and embarrassed about it,\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:47.000\nthat like she'll come home and I'll just like, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:50.000\nAnd I run in there and I'll flush the toilet.\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:55.000\nAnd we have a rule that just, just, just to save the marriage,\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:58.000\njust without opening up the seat, just flush the toilet.\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:00.000\nJust for, just to be safe.\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:03.000\nI mean, Occam's razor says it's old age.\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:06.000\nI mean, that's the easier explanation.\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:07.000\nOkay.\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:10.000\nLeave a note to

the one that has the, that blows the air.\n\n39:40.000 --> 39:44.000\nThe one that like opens by itself.\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:47.000\nYeah, I want to, I want to, I want to really do it up.\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:48.000\nYou know?\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:49.000\nOne that drives you to the airport.\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:53.000\nYeah, I want to, I want to close my DreamWorks deal.\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:55.000\nYou piece of shit.\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:58.000\nTake me to LAX, you piece of shit.\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:05.000\nDo you think we would ever see in our lifetime, like just an end to, I mean, like, like what,\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:11.000\ndo you think before we die, we'll just see at least on the internet some kind of like,\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:18.000\nlike Japanese press release video or something, like the technology that eliminates somehow.\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:21.000\nJust no more shitting in the toilet.\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:22.000\nI would love that.\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:23.000\nI would love it.\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:24.000\nI don't know.\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:27.000\nIt's either like a vacuum type of, like just like it being.\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:32.000\nLike you stand in a booth and a purple line goes down your body and then there's no more\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:34.000\npoop-oos in your body.\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:35.000\nPurple line, yeah.\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:37.000\nIt beams it out of your Portland.\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:43.000\nOr you just have an implant that, that as you, as your food becomes poop, there's like a,\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:51.000\nthere's a point in your intestinal tract where there's like a portal to, to, to a shared\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:55.000\ntoilet in Portland.\n\n40:55.000 --> 41:01.000\nYeah, what if it was like, you know, you're like, okay, buy, buy this new, you, you swallow\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:05.000\nlike basically a, you know, a Seth Brungo, like telepod.\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:06.000\nYeah.\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:07.000\nAnd then you just, you just shit.\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:08.000\nYou swallow a ring.\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:09.000\nIt looks like an IUD.\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:13.000\nI think it was, or what's that, or there was like a, it's like a flexi thing and you swallow\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:16.000\nit and then it like, it's designed to like.\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:17.000\nPut a stargate in your ass.\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:22.000\nLike when it hits a certain point, it puts a, it puts a stargate not in your ass.\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:26.000\nPut a star, and that, and that would be like a Sam Elliott type voice.\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:27.000\nPut a stargate in your ass.\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:28.000\nActually, you know what?\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:29.000\nYeah.\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:30.000\nI'm thinking about this all wrong.\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:33.000\nPut it right in your, the rim of your ass.\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:34.000\nRight.\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:35.000\nFirst of all, it feels good.\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:43.000\nSecond of all, you get to still have like a baby, the feeling of taking a shit in your\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:44.000\npants.\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:45.000\nWell, I would think that.\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:46.000\nAnd it's just going into a portal.\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:47.000\nInto a portal.\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:55.000\nAnd then on some alien planet, this is the Starship Troopers, like pre-movie or whatever.\n\n41:55.000 --> 42:00.000\nLike there are all these insect people are like going, well, it's raining again.\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:02.000\nWhere is this coming from?\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:04.000\nWe just tracked it.\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:06.000\nIt's just this Earth's place.\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:09.000\nIt just says it's five years into the future.\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:12.000\nYou know, like that's how short-sighted we are as a culture.\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:14.000\nIt just says it's five years into the future.\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:15.000\nWe're like, come on.\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:17.000\nWe'll worry about it later.\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:18.000\nYeah.\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:22.000\nWell, luckily we won't be around too much longer on this planet.\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:23.000\nYeah.\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:24.000\nWe're not going to be.\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:25.000\nI don't think so.\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:27.000\nNot to bum everybody out.\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:28.000\nYeah, but a year.\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:30.000\nI doubt we're going to be on this planet very much longer.\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:32.000\nPlease don't worry about bumming them out.\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:33.000\nThey're idiots.\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:34.000\nMan.\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:37.000\nLike the difference between them being bummed out.\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:38.000\nI don't think you're idiots.\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:39.000\nWe're excited about life.\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:40.000\nI don't think you're idiots.\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:44.000\nThe difference between a fly having a saddle on it or not.\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:45.000\nLike who's going to notice?\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:47.000\nYou can't ride a fly.\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:49.000\nHe's insulting you.\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:50.000\nHe doesn't mean it.\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:51.000\nHe doesn't mean it.\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:52.000\nHe doesn't mean it.\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:53.000\nRight, Dan?\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:54.000\nYou don't mean it.\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:55.000\nI mean it.\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:56.000\nHe doesn't mean it.\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:58.000\nNo, this is part of my therapy.\n\n42:58.000 --> 43:01.000\nI've become too reliant on people's approval.\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:02.000\nRight.\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:04.000\nWhat I've always been good at is abuse.\n\n43:04.000 --> 43:09.000\nSo I'm using that to wean myself off of your expectations.\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:14.000\nIf it hurts you, it seems to be making me happy.\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:15.000\nIt's not going to hurt you.\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:16.000\nYou're sociopaths.\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:18.000\nYou don't have feelings.\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:25.000\nThe idea that I've been doing something or anything for people because you have feelings.\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:32.000\nIt's been my problem that I've been making your problem for 40 years.\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:35.000\nI need to figure out who the fuck I am.\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:36.000\nMe too.\n\n43:36.000

iTack.\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:01.000\nWe asked ourselves what is a thumb tack\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:06.000\nand the answer was it's not a pin.\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:08.000\nNor should it be.\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:12.000\nAnd we set about changing fundamentally\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:16.000\nthe experience between the person who wants to pin something\n\n51:16.000 --> 51:20.000\nto a bulletin board and the pin itself.\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:22.000\nThis is iTack.\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:24.000\nI would fucking buy it.\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:26.000\nI would buy it.\n\n51:26.000 --> 51:28.000\nYou would buy

affordable.\n\n51:42.000 --> 51:45.000\nIt would have to be egregiously priced.\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:48.000\nIt would have to be a $49 thumb tack\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:52.000\nfor me to go like, well, there must be something to this.\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:54.000\nAnd I would do it.\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:58.000\nHere's some other things I would do.\n\n51:58.000 --> 52:02.000\nIf you told me when I went

comfortable place.\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:15.000\nI would opt for that.\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:18.000\nIf you called it like platinum plus red circle program\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:21.000\nI would stand in the red circle.\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:24.000\nWhen I go to the airport I go like,\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:26.000\nlet's see if they have a lounge\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:28.000\nand Cody and Jeff are always

friends?\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:48.000\nAnd then you go and there's nowhere to sit\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:50.000\nand there's like crying babies\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:52.000\nare being dumped in the lounge.\n\n52:52.000 --> 52:54.000\nIn the fucking duct?\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:56.000\nIn the lounge?\n\n52:56.000 --> 52:58.000\nYeah, in the lounge.\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:00.000\nYou can see through a tinted window\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:02.000\nthat the regular ass poor people's seats are all empty\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:04.000\nbecause everyone wants to be in the lounge.\n\n53:04.000 --> 53:06.000\nAnd I'm no exception.\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:09.000\nIs there a package where I can strap the babies\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:12.000\nto my feet and just like walk around on them\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:14.000\nand be more uncomfortable\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:17.000\nbut more importantly, more important.\n\n53:17.000 --> 53:21.000\nI'm a terrible person.\n\n53:21.000 --> 53:25.000\nAnd I can't wait to get that fucking iPhone X\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:28.000\nbecause the iPhone 8 is for poor people.\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:33.000\nIs the 8 out?\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:36.000\nYeah, same time as the X.\n\n53:36.000 -->

School!\n\n58:27.000 --> 58:32.000\nBeing bred for corporate culture!\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:36.000\nNo real learning anymore!\n\n58:36.000 --> 58:38.000\nNo philosophy!\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:43.000\nJust you're being plugged in to a machine!\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:45.000\nSchool!\n\n58:45.000 --> 58:51.000\nBut yeah, I grew up as a lower middle class kid.\n\n58:51.000 --> 58:55.000\nDid your parents beat you?\n\n58:55.000 --> 59:02.000\nYou know, my dad, my mom was extremely gentle.\n\n59:02.000 --> 59:05.000\nMy father, Sicilian, so he had...\n\n59:05.000 --> 59:07.000\nAnd it's true about the Sicilian...\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:13.000\nHe beat you if someone paid him.\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:15.000\nLook, son, you didn't mow the lawn.\n\n59:15.000 --> 59:19.000\nI'm gonna beat the shit out of you as soon as I find someone that...\n\n59:19.000 --> 59:21.000\nWatch me.\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:23.000\nLook at your report card!\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:28.000\nIf I get $50, your ass is mine!\n\n59:28.000 --> 59:31.000\nJimmy Three-toes is coming down.\n\n59:31.000 --> 59:34.000\nJimmy Three-toes, Marvin the...\n\n59:34.000 --> 59:38.000\nThe ex-the-god is coming down.\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:40.000\nOh, here we go on another riff.\n\n59:40.000 --> 59:43.000\nNo, no, no, I think we are. This is the list of mafia guys.\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:46.000\nOh, nope, he shook it off. Okay, he's not gonna do it.\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:48.000\nI shook it off. I shook it off.\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:57.000\nI always felt deprived about that though, because my Sicilian family had no connections at all...\n\n59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000\nTo the cosenoes drill, the black...\n\n01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nI mean, that would have been a nice cart for me to play.\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:09.000\nWhen I was getting my ass kicked in school, like, hey, you touch me, you're gonna deal with the black hand.\n\n01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000\nOr some shit like that.\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000\nWhen's the last time you saw Godfather 2?\n\n01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000\nOh, me. That's me telling the kids.\n\n01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000\nNo, I just watched Godfather 2.\n\n01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000\nRemember, Robert De Niro plays Brando's character in Five Facts.\n\n01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000\nAnd then they walk you through, he's just a regular guy, he's in New York,\n\n01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000\nand then there's this guy who's like the guy in the white coat, you know, he's like Don Camucci.\n\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000\nOh, yeah, yeah, the guy he kills, yeah.\n\n01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000\nAnd then De Niro's like, oh, who's that guy? Who, what's with him?\n\n01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000\nAnd they're like, and Bruno Kirby's like...\n\n01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000\nThat guy, oh, that guy!\n\n01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000\nHe owns everything, he owns everything!\n\n01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000\nAnd everything's like, oh, it's in his neighborhood, oh, it's everything, oh, mama mia!\n\n01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000\nAnd then he's like, oh, I think I'll take care of it, I'll take care of it.\n\n01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000\nAnd they're like, what are you gonna do? No one else can do what you're doing.\n\n01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000\nHe's like, trust me.\n\n01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000\nAnd you're just like on the edge of your seat, like wow, we're really watching the origin,\n\n01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000\nwe're watching the evolution of the American mafia.\n\n01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000\nI think it'd be funny if all Sicilians would like that, because my dad was a history teacher,\n\n01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000\nand it'd be funny if he taught class like that.\n\n01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.000\nLook, the only thing I could tell you is that the Romans had their way.\n\n01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000\nAnd he just walked out of the fucking class.\n\n01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.000\nThey had their way, they had their message.\n\n01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000\nRead up on the catapult.\n\n01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:42.000\nBut Robert De Niro, as you may recall, as Brando in his youth, the character, Don Corleone,\n\n01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:51.000\nhe climbs up on a roof, and he walks across rooftops so that he can get into the apartment building.\n\n01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000\nYes, what was that about?\n\n01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.000\nOf the mafia, Don, who holds little Italy in his iron grip.\n\n01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000\nBecause of that kind of capish white thing he wears.\n\n01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000\nHe has no bodyguards, he doesn't hang out with anyone.\n\n01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.000\nAll he ever does is walk around an alien at everyone and say that he owns the neighborhood.\n\n01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000\nThen he goes home to a one-bedroom apartment in a dark stair landing where you can access,\n\n01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:17.000\nbut if you just go up on the roof, also the front door, what a work!\n\n01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:25.000\nAnd he wraps a towel around his hand with a gun, and he goes like, hey, and he's like, oh no,\n\n01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.000\nthe one contingency for which they did not prepare.\n\n01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000\nHe's shot by a rifle.\n\n01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000\nOh, you found the black hands kryptonite.\n\n01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000\nBang, bang, oh, I can't believe.\n\n01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000\nWho would have thought of this?\n\n01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000\nThere's bullets in my body.\n\n01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000\nHow did I ever, oh!\n\n01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000\nAnd then De Niro's character is like, now I'm the guy.\n\n01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000\nAnd everyone's like, can I have some money?\n\n01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000\nHe's like, I don't have any, but...\n\n01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:59.000\nSo the reason why De Niro kept becoming the guy is because nobody could find a towel.\n\n01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000\nVery funny if you think about it.\n\n01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000\nIt was cool though, the one thing that sticks out in your head is that the towel starts on fire.\n\n01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000\nRemember, he wraps it around.\n\n01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000\nDoes it even work? Does that make a gunshot sound like less of a gun?\n\n01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000\nI use a pillow.\n\n01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000\nJust usually a throw pillow I hate because I hate the stains on throw pillows.\n\n01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000\nIt starts on fire and then he's like whipping his hand around.\n\n01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000\nIt's kind of cool.\n\n01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000\nScorsese's a good director, I'm not being a real controversial there.\n\n01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000\nYeah, Scorsese directed the shit out of that.\n\n01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000\nWhen he did Godfather 2, his fucking nailed it.\n\n01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000\nHe nailed you, he nailed you.\n\n01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000\nYou know, when I think of his best taxi driver, Godfather 2...\n\n01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000\nFuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!\n\n01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000\nEdit it, edit it out!\n\n01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:46.000\nIf you would have had the iPhone X, it would have saved you from that.\n\n01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000\nIt'd be funny if that's what the X does, it interrupts you.\n\n01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000\nLike you're about to say Scorsese and it just buzzes in your pocket.\n\n01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000\nAnd you look at it and it says Coppola.\n\n01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000\nI can't even hear anybody over the sound of my fucking humiliation.\n\n01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000\nCoppola!\n\n01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000\nReally? Who gives a shit?\n\n01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000\nI don't know, it's...\n\n01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000\nYou don't know Coppola directed Godfather 2? Why are you doing a podcast?\n\n01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000\nPeople just have turned off around the country.\n\n01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000\nLike, turn it off, Margaret!\n\n01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000\nHe said Scorsese.\n\n01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.000\nYes, he called a stupid idiot, but he got that trivia wrong.\n\n01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000\nI've had enough!\n\n01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000\nI've had enough to hear with this guy!\n\n01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000\nNot fact checking his riffs.\n\n01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000\nIt's not like I can fall back on my fidget spinner knowledge.\n\n01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000\nWhat is your fidget spinner knowledge?\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000\nNo, I don't know their things.\n\n01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nLet's fall back on your fidget spinner knowledge.\n\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000\nSo I can't...\n\n01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000\nI don't have any fidget spinner knowledge.\n\n01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000\nYou know what they are.\n\n01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000\nThat's why I'm supposed to know Coppola from Scorsese.\n\n01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000\nBecause I don't invest in fidget spinner information.\n\n01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:07.000\nIf I'm going to forget that Coppola is not Scorsese, why am I not into Pokemon?\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000\nThat tracks.\n\n01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000\nThat tracks.\n\n01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:16.000\nIt's either current events or curmudgeon guardian of nostalgia.\n\n01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000\nWhat am I? I'm a drifting fucking wraith.\n\n01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000\nDude, what is going on with you tonight?\n\n01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000\nWhat happened? Did something happen?\n\n01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000\nNothing new.\n\n01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000\nIs that what's happening? Is it nothing new?\n\n01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:36.000\nYou think that all descents into darkness have to have some simple...\n\n01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000\nOh, a potato fell on my head while I was fighting Pete's dragon.\n\n01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000\nWhat's your thing about descents into darkness, Rob?\n\n01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000\nYou think it's that fucking simplistic?\n\n01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000\nI'm taking sides with you.\n\n01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.000\nI wasn't here last weekend, and I was here the weekend before,\n\n01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000\nand you were delightful that weekend, and now...\n\n01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000\nI think he's delightful tonight.\n\n01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000\nHe is delightful.\n\n01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nHe just doesn't seem very happy right now, and I'm concerned.\n\n01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000\nI'm going through changes.\n\n01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000\nWhy do we have to be happy all the time? I don't get that.\n\n01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000\nIt's true.\n\n01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000\nNo, I don't get it.\n\n01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000\nMoving with the memory islands and the different colored marvels that represent feelings?\n\n01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000\nYeah.\n\n01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000\nThe memory island.\n\n01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000\nSadness is a part of happiness.\n\n01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000\nI don't think it's wrong to be concerned.\n\n01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000\nWhat's that?\n\n01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000\nI don't think it's wrong to be concerned if somebody you care about is not happy.\n\n01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000\nI was in Duncan's podcast, and I was like, yeah, I kind of bumped out, and I don't care.\n\n01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.000\nHe's like, well, that's because you got to just let eight people from Burning Man live here, man.\n\n01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000\nAnd I was like, I'm not going to do that.\n\n01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000\nI'm not going to yese in that suggestion.\n\n01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000\nI know that makes me a bad person.\n\n01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000\nI don't want a bunch of hippies living in my house.\n\n01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000\nYeah, but that would make you happy.\n\n01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000\nBut why not, man?\n\n01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.000\nBecause I'm evil, because I'm evil.\n\n01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000\nI don't think that's evil.\n\n01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000\nI don't think that's evil.\n\n01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000\nI think it's evil.\n\n01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:13.000\nI think it's evil not to let eight Burning Man people live in your house.\n\n01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:19.000\nWe all know that the solution is we have to stop.\n\n01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:28.000\nCapitalism is killing us, and we have to decentralize non-hierarchical, human-based societies.\n\n01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000\nI've known this forever.\n\n01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000\nBut I'd say in a podcast, I'd go like, hey, capitalism sucks.\n\n01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000\nAnd then people on Reddit would go, then give all your money away.\n\n01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000\nYeah, right.\n\n01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000\nFuck you, fuck you, fuck you.\n\n01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000\nYou got me.\n\n01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000\nGod damn it.\n\n01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000\nYou got me.\n\n01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:50.000\nI love my money.\n\n01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000\nIt's 9-Eleven.\n\n01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000\n9-Eleven.\n\n01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000\nIt's 9-Eleven.\n\n01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000\nI lived through, fuck it.\n\n01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000\nI was living in New York.\n\n01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:00.000\nSo did I. Yeah, you were shit. You pieces of shit. I'm a bad man with 9-Eleven.\n\n01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.000\nBunch of L.A. people yelling about 9-Eleven when I lived through it.\n\n01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000\n9-Eleven.\n\n01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000\nOh, you mean you were in New York?\n\n01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000\nYeah, I was right.\n\n01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000\nThat is a high road you could take.\n\n01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000\nThat's what he did.\n\n01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000\nI thought you just assumed they were so young.\n\n01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000\nYou were just like, you didn't fucking live through 9-Eleven.\n\n01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000\nOh, no, no.\n\n01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000\nNo, they weren't there like I was there, you know?\n\n01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000\nRight.\n\n01:08:23.000

01:09:09.000\nIt's just sort of like...\n\n01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:16.000\nIt's like you're watching a human being who is identical to you.\n\n01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:22.000\nAnd what you know about them on a fundamental level is that they were in such pain\n\n01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000\nand fear that they preferred...\n\n01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000\nYeah.\n\n01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.000\nAnd you're just like, I don't know why am I explaining this.\n\n01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000\nWe all know...\n\n01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000\nBut it's just like, wow, holy

buildings!\n\n01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000\nYeah, but where would we get as a society\n\n01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000\nif every time something was genuinely tragic or filled with pathos,\n\n01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000\nwe paid it respect by avoiding it?\n\n01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000\nOh, let's all prove that we're polite.\n\n01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000\nLet's keep our elbows off the table, our feet off the table.\n\n01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.000\nLet's not sit at the table.\n\n01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000\nLet's put the table in bronze.\n\n01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:11.000\nAll right, look, I'm not getting the analogy, but...\n\n01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000\nNo one's ever done that before.\n\n01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.000\nYou can do that?\n\n01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000\nYou mean just saying...\n\n01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000\nYou can.\n\n01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000\nThat's a move with Harmon.\n\n01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000\nYou can just say...\n\n01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.000\nYou're saying nonsense, that's not a metaphor.\n\n01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000\nThat's been an option this whole time.\n\n01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000\nBut you know, when you found out, if you hit the bumper button,\n\n01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000\nyou turned 180 degrees.\n\n01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000\nI was like, holy fuck, what?\n\n01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000\nI don't have to...\n\n01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000\nBut what you're saying is true,\n\n01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000\nand this country, and the people of this country,\n\n01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000\nand this audience in particular,\n\n01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.000\nwe have no memory of history in this country.\n\n01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000\nAnd that's why what's going on is going on.\n\n01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000\nThere's no fucking...\n\n01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000\nMatter of fact, Gore Vidal is one of my favorites.\n\n01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000\nYou like Gore

01:11:58.000\nI have this crazy thing\n\n01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000\nwhere I think that it's better to be overreactive\n\n01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000\nto Nazism.\n\n01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000\nJump the gun if you can on that one.\n\n01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000\nSomeone reminds you a little bit of Hitler?\n\n01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000\nSay it earlier.\n\n01:12:15.000 -->
