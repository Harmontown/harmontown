00:00.000 --> 00:25.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Armageddon is now in session!

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
Welcome to a beautiful Uptown Burbank!

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Ladies and gentlemen, I am Rob Schrab and I'm going to be filling in for Jeff Davis.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Come, Troy, thank you!

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Let's bring up Spencer Crittenden!

00:45.000 --> 00:58.000
And the mayor of Harmontown himself, Mr. Dan Harmon!

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Thank you.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Oh man, I totally crashed after that.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Oh yeah, you're all out of energy now?

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
You really pumped him up, you warmed him up.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
Hey, I was talking to Cody about this, I was talking to her about masturbation.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Okay.

01:24.000 --> 01:34.000
And I was telling her about a trick that you told me you used when you would walk home from school.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
I've done this like 18 times on many different podcasts.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Oh okay.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Did you talk about it on this one?

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
I probably did, but we could do it again.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
The fake arm?

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
Oh yeah, I was a da Vinci of jerking off.

01:51.000 --> 02:02.000
I had, well we had the parkas, so it's like winter and you're walking home and you're in eighth grade

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
so everything makes you horny and you just want to jerk off and you can't wait until you get home.

02:06.000 --> 02:16.000
So I would slit my hand out of my sleeve and have like the empty sleeve in my pocket and my hand on my pants

02:16.000 --> 02:25.000
and was jerking off as I was walking home because I couldn't wait 10 minutes.

02:25.000 --> 02:32.000
And Cody said, why not just use the bathroom at the school?

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Oh yeah, I did that too.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Yeah, I was trying to explain to her.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
Dude, don't you know that there's not a bathroom on the way home?

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
There's sidewalks.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
Yeah, I mean I would run home.

02:45.000 --> 02:53.000
One day, fifth grade, just bing and then I thought I invented it and then I just started hanging out.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
And I would just run, I would sprint home.

02:56.000 --> 03:04.000
And everybody would be like, hey Dan, I'd run home and I'd just like rip off all my clothes and hump every pillow in the house

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
looking at Penny from Inspector Gadget.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Did you think you were...

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
I was her age.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
It was romantic.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
It was like remains of the day.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Did you think like...

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
We grew up together in a society that kept us apart.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
I used to think, I'm feeling you're probably the same way.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
Like I used to feel like, man, I am so good at jerking off.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Like nobody knows I'm doing it.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Like I could be in the...

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
I go to that.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Nobody, I'm so smooth, I've got it all figured out.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
And then you get to be an adult.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
No, everybody knew you were jerking off constantly.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
They just didn't want to go stop.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Yeah, no one wants to acknowledge.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
No one wants to say I know what you're doing.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
But I've talked about this on the podcast.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
It's like I had an unusual...

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
The only reason I didn't use the arm trick, which I did as an adult, by the way.

04:04.000 --> 04:11.000
I remembered you telling me about doing it walking home and I was in my car and I was like, I'm out of control.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
I got to do something and it's rush hour and I just like...

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
I made a little fake arm and I tried jerking off in the car.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
You tried?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
In the middle of Los Angeles traffic.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
I can't even remember if I succeeded or if...

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
I really can't remember.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
And then Cody's like, why wouldn't you just pull over?

04:27.000 --> 04:33.000
And I'm like, once you pull over and you're just like, here's breath away from sex offender.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
And then she told me this story.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
She's like, you're right.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
She was walking and there's probably women in the audience right here that this has happened to.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
It's all too common.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
She was walking and some guy said, hey, come here.

04:47.000 --> 04:56.000
And he was in his car with the window down and she went over and he had his dick in his hand and he was wrenching at it.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
And she was like, ah, what? Fuck you. You piece of shit. God damn it.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
And then he just drove off.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Does he do that all night?

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
And then like, does he eventually come?

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Like the next block down?

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Excuse me.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
You!

05:12.000 --> 05:19.000
Well, I mean, obviously he's not trolling for someone who's like into it.

05:19.000 --> 05:27.000
He probably knows that the person's going to go gross, stop it, no police.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
And that's the only thing that can get them going, which makes me feel a little bad for them.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Smallest violin.

05:35.000 --> 05:49.000
But, you know, when your kinks involve social taboos, societal taboos, I do feel bad for those people because I'm sure if they could flip a switch, they'd change it.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
I don't know.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
I'm sure they would.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
There are some issues.

05:55.000 --> 06:03.000
But anyways, as I've explained to you and explained to them, for part of my childhood, I can't remember when I was finally just like,

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
what are you doing? Just use your hand like a fucking person.

06:06.000 --> 06:16.000
I had this hang up about masturbation, so I had myself convinced that what I was doing when I was masturbating was not masturbation because I was humping things.

06:16.000 --> 06:32.000
So, then I remember like being like, I don't know, 11, and I was sleeping in the same living room as my uncle,

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
my dad.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
We were at my grandma's cottage.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
That makes this sound so fancy.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
Not the word I would have picked.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
My grandma had this cottage.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
She was sleeping in her room.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
My dad was sleeping in the only other room, so I was sharing the living room with my uncle.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
I had a cot.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
I was 11.

06:51.000 --> 06:57.000
I was at the peak of my, you know, I was into two things.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Ender's game and humping stuff.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
And I was all done with Ender's game.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
That'd be a good double feature though.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
I'm here to read Ender's game and hump stuff.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
And Ender's game is a short book.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
So, I just started like, I'm just like humping the cot.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
It's like, it's just quiet.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
We're in the country.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
There's crickets, and then there's just this squeaking cot.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
And I'm just like, I can only remember it.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
I can't even relate to it as an adult talking about it.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
And obviously, we can't talk to an 11-year-old about it.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
But I just, you know, some of you were 11-year-old boys.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
And you remember kind of vaguely how it was just, it must have just been,

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
because you're so small, and the hormones are so new,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
and they make up 90% of your bloodstream,

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
and you're just like a paneling nail.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
You're just everywhere you go.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
You're just nailing stuff, and like, you just can't, it never stops.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
And you're just like, you love it, and you hate it,

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
and you're a slave to it.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
And then I was just like, I was like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
You know, on the cot.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
And I was just, you know, trying in vain to like not,

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
it's like my uncle's kind of like tossing and turning and snoring.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
And then he just like, after a really long, arduous time,

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
he like, he sat up, and I froze.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
And then he like, made a big deal out of like going to the bathroom.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
And he took a really long time.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
And I truly do think, I think he was like, Jesus Christ,

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
if I pretend to take a shit, will you finish?

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I really think that's what he was doing,

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
but I just froze because I was like, oh God,

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
I was thinking, is that what's happening?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Did he hear me?

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Was he awake the whole time?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
And now is that what he's doing?

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
And it took me so long to just deal with that humiliation

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
that he eventually came back.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
And then I was like, well, he must have been so pissed.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
Like, are you kidding me?

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
Well, you didn't have bunk beds like Jeff and I did.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Jeff, your brother.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
My brother.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
My brother was on the bottom bunk.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
So what are you, what, you guys just listened to each other?

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
Oh, I didn't, he listened to me.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
Problem, I mean, I mean, just because I was a,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
you know, I was a mantras-humper too.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
So it's just like, I'm just picturing,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
and I felt like, man, nobody knows,

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
I'm so fucking good at this.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
I'm like, smooth, man, smooth operator.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
And he's probably, and you know, Jeff,

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
he's not gonna let go, hey, hey, enough.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
Come on, you know?

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
So people gotta work for our living, you know?

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
Like, but, poor Jeff, he's got like the spring mantras,

09:40.000 --> 09:47.000
which is probably, oh, jeez, oh, dear.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
And he's your older brother.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Older brother.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
So he's sitting down there going,

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Oh, boy.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
What did I miss?

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
You know, like, why isn't he doing it too?

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Maybe he was, I didn't know.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
Sound travels downward.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
All right, well, yeah, there's not much of a show tonight,

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
but as you can see, it's a...

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Because I'm here.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Jeff's gone.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
We replaced him with Schrab.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
Duncan Tressel was, I told him come to the show,

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
but I think he might be just like...

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
He might be at Meltdown going, look a fool.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Yeah.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
I mean, that's no joke.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
That could be the case.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
So empty, empty.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
I did his podcast, and you know,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
and I was like, you should come do mine,

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
but whatever.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
I hear you watched Old It recently.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Old It?

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
Yeah, I watched the old Stephen King's It.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Got caught up on that.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Yeah.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
In anticipation of the new Stephen King's It.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Yep.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Old It versus New It.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
I've seen Old It a lot.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
I probably watched it with you a bunch of times,

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
and I've just saw the new It like last weekend.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
You saw the new one?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
I saw the new It, yes.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Do they all float?

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
They do.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
They do.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
But what did you say about the Old It?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Not much.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Cody watched it with me, and she's like,

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
nobody floated.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
No.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
She kept saying they all float down here.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
There was never any...

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
They all float down here.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
And we have talked about the fact that in the book,

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
the boys all have sex with the girl.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Right.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
When they're kids.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Because it's her idea.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
She goes, well, one thing left to do.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
The only way to get out of this sewer dimension is to,

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
well, all right.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
And all the boys are going, Jesus Christ,

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
are you serious?

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I was thinking about Stephen King.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
It's like, it's hard to put your finger on what he's good

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
and bad at, but like...

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Yeah.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
He's like...

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
I think if he was sitting here,

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
he would be like, yeah, that's true.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
I don't...

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Yeah.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
I know his origin story has something to do with,

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
as I've said, like, I think, you know,

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
in the Marvel movie where Stephen King is a hero

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
in the first 20 minutes,

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
he's like carrying his typewriter and he drops it

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
and the backspace key flies off.

12:11.000 --> 12:17.000
And it's just like, God...

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
But I have to turn in a...

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Oh, and then he's like...

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
It's gonna be a thousand pages long.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Holy shit!

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
You can make it up as you go!

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
It's gonna be a thousand pages long.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
I think he'd agree with that.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
I don't think he'd be offended by that.

12:34.000 --> 12:40.000
It's one thing about, like, the scene in the book

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
where all...

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
How many boys are there?

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
It's like, Beverly...

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
How many?

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Six.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Six.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Five?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Six?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Let's say five.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
They, like, Beverly starts taking off her clothes

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
and they're like, oh, holy shit,

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
I guess we're gonna have to...

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
I guess we're gonna have to have sex with her.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
But aren't they like 10?

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
They're 11.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
Okay, alright.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
And I would be...

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
I was like, okay, gross,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
and I understand you're doing exploitation.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
You could have wrote fade out, fade up.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
They're all putting their sneakers on

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
and going, wow, that was terrific,

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
and now we can get out of the sewer.

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
But page after page of description

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
and commenting on sizes and shit and going,

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
I'm like, okay, I really don't need to know

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
that the fat kid has the biggest dick.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
It's like, it's like, smash fiction,

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
but his favorite show is Children.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
Like, it's like...

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
But, you know, I mean, that being said,

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
I'd be like...

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
I love Stephen King.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
It's the only thing, it's like,

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
when you watch the old it,

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
which is available on your little consoles.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
And it's not called the old it.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
So when you're typing it in,

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
I keep typing in the old it,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
and it's not showing up.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
It's just it.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
It's two-part miniseries.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
It's done in 1998.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
You should be aware of the studio

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
that makes those sort of, like,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
African-American recreations of, like,

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
about last night and stuff like that.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
There's a black it called...

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
Black-ish.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
You had a bit.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
I know, I didn't have a bit,

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
but Jesus Christ.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
I know.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
That's just the name of a show.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
And it sounds like black it.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
My...

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
You know.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
I just say stuff.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
You just see a dot,

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
you just connect the one you're on.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Yeah.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Yeah.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
It's Stephen King of talking.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
I don't have a backspace.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
And who here is a time-spenser?

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
How are you?

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Hey, guys.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Yeah.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
I just...

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Everything...

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
This is the thing that I think Stephen King

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
is either good or bad at,

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
but in any case,

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
it's an extreme condition he has.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Everything's a device.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Everything's like a crucifix.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Everything's a...

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
There's, like, 90 things in it

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
that if you use the power of positivity

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
or whatever,

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
if you recite the birds in your Boy Scout manual,

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
it makes the Tim Curry clown go away.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
If you just aren't afraid,

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
if you just hold hands and ignore everything,

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
it can only hurt you if you pay attention.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
If you have an asthma inhaler,

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
you can just say it's acid and squirt it.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
It's a slingshot.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
It's silver.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
And every step of the way,

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
because he doesn't want to go back

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
and refine anything,

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
people are just like,

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
hey, I brought a slingshot

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
and I brought my mom's earrings.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
They're silver.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
How do we know that'll work?

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
If we believe it, it'll work.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Oh, fuck you.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Fuck you.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
But you have...

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
Do you have a favorite Stephen King,

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
like, adaptation book or something?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
I mean...

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
I've always said,

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I liked his stuff when he was, like, a kid.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Like, when you read those Bakman books.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Like, the long walk,

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
I thought it was just, like, really simple and granular.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
It's like, you know, 100 kids,

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
and they walk until one of them's left,

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
and if you drop below 10 miles an hour walking,

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
they shoot your brains out.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Uh-huh.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
That's cool.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
I like Carrie.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
I think Carrie...

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Carrie, the book is great.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Yeah.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Okay.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Well...

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
Remember when I told you about the library policeman?

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
When I was listening to...

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
I was listening to the book on tape,

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
The Library Policeman,

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
which is a short story

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
where there's this guy who's like,

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
oh, man, something bad happened to me as a kid.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
I can't recall it because I blocked it,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
and it's the thing, I have to get over this fear.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Otherwise, I'm gonna...

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
I won't be able to kill this monster in the library.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
How am I gonna get over this thing

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
that I can't remember that happened to me as a kid?

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
You know?

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
And I'm listening to it for, like, days,

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
because on the way to work,

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
I would listen to it, like, you know,

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
like 20 minutes at a time.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
And finally, it was, like, the chapter where we...

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
he meets up with him.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Like, he faces this fear.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
And Kate and I were, like, going to a party,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
and we go, hey, hun, you know,

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
I just really want to know what happens here.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Do you mind if I just play this on the way?

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Yeah, I don't give a fuck.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Whatever, do whatever you want.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
I don't give a shit.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
All right?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
All right.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
I'm like, oh, thanks, hunny, I love you.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
And then it goes into, again,

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
great detail about how, when he was eight years old,

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
he was molested by this guy in the bushes

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
and just describing in great detail

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
about, like, how the warm jelly went up his ass.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
And I'm just...

17:41.000 --> 17:46.000
And it's just, like, a quiet drive.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
And it's like, I don't want to press stop

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
because that's admitting that this is gross

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
and whatever.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
And Kate is just, like...

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
I'm fucking married to this guy.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
This is what I...

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
I guess I signed up for this.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
Who was reading the book on tape?

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
Oh, I forget his name, but it was...

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
It was the guy who played the white shadow.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Remember the TV series, the white shadow?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Mm-hmm.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
You guys remember the white shadow from the 70s?

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
It's a sh...

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Okay, all right.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
It was that guy.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
He was a white basketball coach

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
and then his mostly black...

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Has that high school?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
I think a high school basketball team.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
I believe it was a high school basketball team.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
And it was called the white shadow.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
It was called the white shadow.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
Little, little, little playing with the concepts of...

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Shadows are usually...

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Black and white.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
Not white.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
They're the opposite.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Hi, Spencer.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
Hey, guys, yeah.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Spencer, if you watch...

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
If you're like a 10-year-old black kid

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
and you're watching that show in the 70s,

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
you're like, the white shadow.

18:56.000 --> 19:01.000
Oh, I get it because I'm like a shadow person.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
Something like that every day.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Every cereal box is a minefield.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
Every conversation, like...

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
That's what I'm...

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
Why are you guys reacting to that observation

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
as if I did something wrong?

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
Is it just because you are scared

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
that now at the end of the world,

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
someone's gonna mention, by the way,

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
we were kind of mean to black people?

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Like, that would make up the apocalypse.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
A little worse.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
A little awkward.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
A little party foul during Armageddon.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Party foul.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Oops, party foul.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
We should do that as the...

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Just give me a second.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
Okay.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I want to make this incredibly clear to you.

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
I don't fucking care about your opinions anymore.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
You're terrible people.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
You're dumb.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
You're impressionable, manipulatable, and stupid.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
I know that seems like I've added, like, a synonym for dumb,

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
but it's two different things.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
You have no voice.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
You have no brain.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
You're bad people.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
You're a biomass of closet murderers.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
You're only held in check by your fear.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Fuck off.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
Our next guest is performing at...

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Clubs and colleges all across the nation.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
Please welcome Eddie Pepitone!

20:31.000 --> 20:36.000
Yes!

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
All right.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
Follow that.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Follow that.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Follow that.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Hi, Spencer.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Oh, I can see Spencer now.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Hi, Spencer.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Oh.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Hi, Edward.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Hello.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Edward.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Hello.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Edward, how are you?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
You look great, man.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
What's going on?

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
What are you doing?

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
I'm doing stand-up right here, actually,

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
every Wednesday night.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
I'm doing stand-up all over town.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
I'm exploring stand-up, you know?

21:07.000 --> 21:13.000
Yeah, because, no, a lot of people think stand-up is just set-up punchline.

21:13.000 --> 21:18.000
I think it's an enormous cry for help.

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
And it's tricky to make that funny, you know?

21:23.000 --> 21:32.000
But just put my id on stage and kind of try not to be embarrassed about it.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
How old were you when you started stand-up?

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
How old was I?

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Yeah, how old were you?

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
57.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
57.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
You started?

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
No, I'm kidding.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Boy, that fell flat.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
Hi, everybody!

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Fuck you!

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
There you go.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
How is this room for stand-up?

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
You've been doing it here for several sets.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
It's got to be awful, right?

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Like, high ceilings.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
Well, everybody says the high ceilings, but I like it.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
I like it, actually.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
I don't know if it's just the vibe of the place.

22:03.000 --> 22:09.000
And as far as stand-up goes, it's not so much what counts as high ceilings,

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
but who is in the audience.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Right.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
You know what I mean?

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
I mean, at this show, it's been fine, because if it's a big, giant room with high ceilings,

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
and then there's like 200 people, okay, so it's like a town hall or whatever,

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
and also not doing stand-up.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
But I wonder, yeah, about people.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
But I want to let you know, and I could do this offstage, too,

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
but I don't really have anything to talk about on stage.

22:31.000 --> 22:38.000
But we're putting the money that we make off of the ticket stuff here.

22:38.000 --> 22:45.000
We're going to be working on making kind of convertible, adjustable things.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Oh, really?

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
And fine-tune the acoustic and optical appearance.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Make it more intimate.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
Yeah, I want this place to be able to do a show with 30 people in the audience.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
That's perfect for me.

22:57.000 --> 23:04.000
That's a little much, 30, but if you could get it down to 15, 20, that would be perfect.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
But then from what I understand, music is like, oh, yeah, no,

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
fucking do it in a big, giant warehouse, that's best for music.

23:12.000 --> 23:19.000
So I want to be able to hoist a chain and make it conducive to a punk band,

23:19.000 --> 23:24.000
because I'm so enthusiastic about the music scene.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Me, too.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
I'm up on all, you know, every punk band there is.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
What's your favorite punk band?

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Right now?

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
Right now.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Dirty rats.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
The dirty rats.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
They're all Cagney impersonators, and they're fucking brilliant.

23:39.000 --> 23:44.000
Like, you, you dirty fucking rat, you dirty fucking rat,

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
and they just go on and on like that.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
It's all about vermin, it's good.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
Is that Spotify?

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Yes.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
By the way, I was listening to Stalin on Pandora on the way over,

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
and that's just a sample of what you get when you come see me.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
I have a little dictator playlist on Pandora.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
You're kind of holding in your laughter.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
I'm holding in my laughter, yeah.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
No, I'm thinking of what I'm going to say next.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
That's why I'm a bad interviewer.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
But I've heard, because you're doing these shows here,

24:23.000 --> 24:28.000
this is no different from anywhere else you're doing shows, I'm sure.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
You're like, I feel like one of the cool things about you is that you're like,

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
you've got your strong material, but then you're Eddie Pepitone.

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
If you go off the rails, it's kind of exciting.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
That's what I do.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
That's what I like to do.

24:44.000 --> 24:50.000
I started, I think I started, I've been getting into these riffs about the hurricanes.

24:50.000 --> 24:56.000
I want to try to provoke a riff, but I know that that won't work,

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
like if I announce that as my goal.

24:58.000 --> 25:09.000
I mean, I could. I was just getting into the ghoulishness of the coverage of the hurricanes.

25:09.000 --> 25:19.000
First, it was Harvey, and how I get attracted to the hurricane, like following the hurricane.

25:19.000 --> 25:28.000
They get to it early, CNN, the weather channel, and they're like, look at this.

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
They don't say fuck, but they're like, look at this fucking.

25:32.000 --> 25:38.000
That's not a good face, by the way, to be like, yeah, that's better.

25:38.000 --> 25:43.000
Holy shit, I looked over Rob, you look like God.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
Not another hurricane story.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
It is kind of insane in general.

25:49.000 --> 25:54.000
The storm stuff, that stems from just this general thing where your local news,

25:54.000 --> 25:59.000
if something happened at a school, someone stabbed someone with a pencil,

25:59.000 --> 26:04.000
a school behind me, like they take the van out, the satellite dish goes up,

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
but it's like no one's getting stabbed now.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
There's just rows of white vans, and there's all these people,

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
and they're just at the place where the stabbing took place.

26:15.000 --> 26:22.000
There's absolutely zero chance that it's going to be important to be at that location in a journalistic sense.

26:22.000 --> 26:31.000
There's not even an example in history of like, oh, we just kind of do that because you never know.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
There's nothing to never know.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
I found an eraser.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
I found a clue, ladies and gentlemen, that's the police's job.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
You're not out there for any reason.

26:40.000 --> 26:45.000
And then the storms happen, and it's just people being blown by wind.

26:45.000 --> 26:51.000
It was hilarious because when the storms happen, and they live for this,

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
what I hate about it is that they're always like, be safe.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
They're always like, please, be safe, be safe.

27:00.000 --> 27:06.000
Oh my God, I hope this hurricane doesn't hit land, but it's the opposite.

27:06.000 --> 27:13.000
They love it, they love it because it's just a spectacle, and that's what news media is about.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
That's what the whole world has become about.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
It's all spectacle.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Hold on.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
You wanted to provoke something.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Let him talk.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
For Christ's sake.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Let him talk.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
For once.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
And I masturbate too.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
Don't get me wrong.

27:35.000 --> 27:40.000
I still run home and do it.

27:40.000 --> 27:45.000
But I mean, so they're always like, be safe, be safe.

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
And they're like, nobody should be out here, but they are out there, and it's hilarious.

27:49.000 --> 27:54.000
Nobody should be out here having fun but me.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Jim Cantori.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
It was very funny.

27:58.000 --> 28:08.000
Jim Cantori is apparently like, it is very funny too that he's like the dean of TV meteorologists, you know, for whatever reason.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
The dean of TV?

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Well, you know what I mean?

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
Like people referred him like, what does Jim think about this storm?

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
What does the dean think about this meteorology?

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
I think he said the king.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
I don't think he ever said the dean.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Did you ever said the dean?

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
I did.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Did you say the dean?

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
Yeah.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
Okay.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Oh, shit.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Oh, no.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Oh, no.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
What did I, what did I, oh, you were going to correct me?

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
And you were wrong.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
I was trying to help you.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
And you were wrong.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
I was trying to help you.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
You told these people they're stupid.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
They are.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Go for your stupid.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
You're stupid.

28:44.000 --> 28:50.000
You didn't hear what he said, and you're closer to him.

28:50.000 --> 28:57.000
That's not making them any smarter, and I was trying to help you and made a mistake.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
You're revealing that you're a bad person too.

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
I thought that you needed help and helped you.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Don't fight mommy and daddy.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Don't fight.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
I don't believe you.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
I don't believe you.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
You don't, but wait.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
I don't believe you.

29:12.000 --> 29:17.000
You thought I was trying to capitalize on your, your weakness?

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Look what you're doing.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Look what you're doing.

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
I have my nice hat on and you're fighting.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
I know, I know.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
It's not, it's not your, it's not your fault.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
It's not your fault.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
Thank you.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Now I feel, go ahead.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
I never got that when I was a kid.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
It's not your fault.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
So the Dean of Meteorology.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Has anybody ever just died?

29:37.000 --> 29:43.000
Like, like, like, like the, I know, I mean, by gun, we have like horrible example, like

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
that guy just fucking, it's, it's like we're living in some weird dream.

29:47.000 --> 29:54.000
Because that guy that shot, he shot a news crew while they were doing the news, you know,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
and like that happened recently.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Yeah.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
A couple years ago.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
Yeah.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
Oh, couple of years.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Now that to me, that's good news.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Like that is good news.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
That's real.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
That's really happening.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
But they didn't know they were covering it.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
They were, they didn't know they were covering it.

30:11.000 --> 30:16.000
They were outside of school or someone got stabbed with a pencil three hours earlier.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
But the, the, it's weird.

30:18.000 --> 30:24.000
Like, but we've never seen anybody like no one's ever as many storms as there's been.

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
I'm surprised that there hasn't been journalist fatalities, you know, from people like.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
That's true.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Stealing out in the 80 mile an hour winds.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Oh, I was so hoping.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Yeah, I was so hoping.

30:34.000 --> 30:39.000
I was so hoping that, you know, this guy, they had a couple of guys, but I was so hoping

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
they would just be carried the fucking away.

30:42.000 --> 30:47.000
And, and, and one guy, one guy did not vote Jim Cantori, the Dean.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
By the way, when you say.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
Why is he the Dean?

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Now I'm confused.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Well, you've never heard that term.

30:53.000 --> 30:58.000
Like he is like, you know, the go to guy as far as meteorologists.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
So you've never heard that, that little expression Dean.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Have you ever been called into a Dean's office?

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
It's always a meteorologist.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
I'm kidding.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
That would be funny if you would call.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
Hey, how are you?

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
I'm all right.

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
I feel like I got to keep him entertained, but um, no, because I looked at him and he

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
had his hand over his eyes.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
No, he's.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Yeah, you had that fucking look.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
That's just him listening.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
It's a, yeah.

31:22.000 --> 31:29.000
But by the way, when you said you didn't say Dean, right, I want to be like so much by

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
everybody that I was going.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
There was a split second where I was going to go.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
No, I didn't.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
Then I realized everybody else had heard it.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
You were weighing whether to pretend you said King.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
All right.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
I get it.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Yeah.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
I have been a slave to people's.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Let me ask you this.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
Yeah.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Okay.

31:50.000 --> 31:55.000
Pick your nose in front of a friend or a stranger that you'll never see again on the freeway,

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
for instance, like, like, like, like, which.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Oh, you know, I, you know what's amazing?

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
I've thought of that a lot.

32:01.000 --> 32:07.000
And I was preparing for the podcast, but I'm when, when I am on the, when I am on, uh,

32:07.000 --> 32:14.000
you know, a street and I'm about to pick my nose in the car, I, I can't do it in front

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
of a stranger.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
Right.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
I can't do it.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
Because you'll never see them again.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
What is that about?

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
How sick is that?

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
But you'll, like, what is that about?

32:21.000 --> 32:25.000
I want to pick my nose in front of my girlfriend because I just don't want her to see me.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
I just don't want to see a thing come out, but.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
Well, it depends on how late in the relationship it is.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
We, we, we're, we're farting all over each other at this point.

32:33.000 --> 32:38.000
Like, like, like, and it's great, we're having a great time and that's just, uh, my, my,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
my ex-wife, we, we did a thing like that.

32:40.000 --> 32:44.000
I, uh, Sarah Silverman, uh, had told me that she and Jimmy Kimmel never farted in front

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
of each other.

32:45.000 --> 32:49.000
So I tried it with, uh, Erin McGathy, you know, Aaron, my ex-wife, or maybe you don't

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
put, you said you're a podcast maven.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
Maybe you know my ex-wife, but, but Aaron and I really never farted.

32:54.000 --> 32:59.000
You know, there was a couple, a couple of accidents happened here and there, all Aaron.

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
Um, uh, no, but, but, but, but we.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
But we just did it.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
You know, as I spent my marriage not farting.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
Really?

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
And that's not why we got divorced.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
I was going to say.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
It worked fine.

33:11.000 --> 33:16.000
It was, I was, I'm surprised looking back that I was able to not fart in front of my

33:16.000 --> 33:21.000
partner for so long, given how much I fart with Cody.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
We're just farting constantly.

33:23.000 --> 33:28.000
So it's like, what was I, I don't know what natural human behavior is anymore.

33:28.000 --> 33:33.000
I don't even know what my body needed to do or what's healthy or what I just like now.

33:33.000 --> 33:39.000
Well, I think what you're talking about there, Dan, is, um, a great example of what we can

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
do when we put our mind to something.

33:41.000 --> 33:47.000
You know, when we, when we introduce our will and with your ex-wife, you were exercising

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
tremendous will.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Yeah.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
Yeah.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
Cause it's not like I was like in tremendous abdominal pain going like, oh, well, I made

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
this agreement.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
I don't remember really needing to fart.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Did you like go into other rooms or?

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
I would.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Yeah.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Some, every once in a while it would be build up to a point.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Would you cough to disguise it?

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
I tell her I'm going to go fart, you know, like, but I just wouldn't do it in front of

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
her.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
What about, what about your.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Oh wait.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
Same story.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
Sarah said the same thing about like keeping the intimacy in your relationship.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
And Kate and I don't fart in front of each other.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
You're still doing that.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
I'm still doing that.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
And it's been seven years.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Is Sarah still with that guy?

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
No.

34:25.000 --> 34:29.000
Was she during the advice?

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
What's that?

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
Was she during the advice?

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Yes.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
Oh, okay.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
She wasn't giving advice.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
She was just.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
She was just talking about.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Something that she was doing with her partner.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
And I thought I'd give it a try.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
Yeah.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
And it worked.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
It's not why we got divorced.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
Andy, you've done it for seven years and it's, and you're not getting divorced.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
More than that.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
But yeah.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
At the same time, I can't believe it.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Just like, I guess it's just, it's just a couple thing.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
Me and Cody are like, uh, let's fart.

34:55.000 --> 35:00.000
I have been forgetting to flush the toilet.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
Which is causing like.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
You've been forgetting.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
Issues.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
Yeah.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
I blame Wi-Fi.

35:07.000 --> 35:12.000
Cause it's fucking up the bees.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
You know, they can't find their way home now, right?

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
They're happening.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
They're happening.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
The Wi-Fi is screwing up the bees.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
Right.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
And this is what I'm telling Kate when she comes home.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Jesus Christ.

35:24.000 --> 35:30.000
Did you dump a cup of coffee in the toilet?

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
And a plate of spaghetti.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
Oh shit.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
I forgot to flush the toilet.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Every day you forget to flush the toilet.

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
And I say, I think it's Wi-Fi.

35:41.000 --> 35:46.000
Because bees are dying out because of Wi-Fi.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
They, they get, it's their radar.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
They find their way home.

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
So I'm thinking there's like a Wi-Fi pocket that is just

35:55.000 --> 35:59.000
between the office and the living room and the bedroom.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
There's like a Bermuda triangle right where I'm going to the bathroom.

36:02.000 --> 36:06.000
And for some reason, you know, I get done.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
I also have the Brondle Swash.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
What?

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
The special toilet seat.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
Right.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
You know my special toilet seat.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
What's your download speed like on the toilet?

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
Because you're saying the Wi-Fi is the strongest there.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
You're referring to it as a Bermuda triangle.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
But Wi-Fi wise, it's, it's Grand Central.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
It's pretty good.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
It's pretty good.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
It's pretty good.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
Okay.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Yeah.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
But I think it's making me forget to flush the toilet.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Because this is a recent thing.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
You do a lot of computer work on the toilet?

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Is that what you're saying?

36:37.000 --> 36:42.000
You're on the, you're on...

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
So you have a, he...

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
I don't do computers on the toilet.

36:46.000 --> 36:54.000
He has a special seat that's like a bidet extension upgrade on the seat.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
Yeah.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Do you wipe your ass with toilet paper?

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Yeah.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Okay.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
To dry my ass.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Because it's beautifully clean now.

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
You've been getting up, wiping your ass, putting the toilet paper into the toilet.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
Right.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
And somehow...

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
Just walking out the door.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
I'm just walking away.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Like I got to treat myself.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
It may, don't you think it may be the bidet?

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
It comes home and opens up and it goes, what the fuck?

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
Seriously?

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Again.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
What's your, what's your offer?

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
This is the bidet.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
Well, I don't know.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Maybe it's the bidet action that is...

37:25.000 --> 37:32.000
But I've had this bidet for like, I've been, I had a bidet for like, like over like 10 years.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
I think it's funny you have a bidet by the way.

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
And I don't consider you a man, like a real man.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Yeah.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
I would not watch a football game with you or...

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
Yeah.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
When you would go to the bathroom during the game, I would be like,

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
Horrible.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
I would be like, let's get the fuck out of here.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
Yeah.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
No, no.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Do you hear that stream of water, Al?

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
Yeah.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Anyway, yeah.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
I'll press the button and it'll go beep and it'll go, I don't know why.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
It goes beep?

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Yeah, it goes beeps.

38:06.000 --> 38:11.000
I would be afraid of getting, I would be afraid of getting injured.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
That's what, that's what the beeps for.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
What?

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
That's what the beeps for.

38:15.000 --> 38:19.000
And you love it.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
And then you dry off with the toilet paper and then you won't have...

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
And then I walk the fuck out the door.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
But this is, I've been, the bidet I've been using way longer.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
This is a recent thing, like in the last two years.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
No, not two.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
Last year, it's just been like kids like, what the fuck is...

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
And I go, I'm so sorry, honey.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
I just, I don't know what, I thought I did, you know.

38:39.000 --> 38:44.000
You're like, and now I'm so nervous about getting yelled at and embarrassed about it,

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
that like she'll come home and I'll just like, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
And I run in there and I'll flush the toilet.

38:50.000 --> 38:55.000
And we have a rule that just, just, just to save the marriage,

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
just without opening up the seat, just flush the toilet.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Just for, just to be safe.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
I mean, Occam's razor says it's old age.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
I mean, that's the easier explanation.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
Okay.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
Leave a note to yourself.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
Leave a note? Yeah, leave a note.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
Tie a, tie a string around my finger.

39:16.000 --> 39:23.000
What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what mnemonic device more than a toilet full of shit, dude?

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
It should work. I don't know.

39:28.000 --> 39:32.000
What about the self-flushing toilets they have at airports and stuff?

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
Why don't you get one of them?

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
Yeah, I should get one of them.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
You know, the self-flushers.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
I want to, I want to upgrade.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
I want to get the one that has the, that blows the air.

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
The one that like opens by itself.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
Yeah, I want to, I want to, I want to really do it up.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
You know?

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
One that drives you to the airport.

39:49.000 --> 39:53.000
Yeah, I want to, I want to close my DreamWorks deal.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
You piece of shit.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
Take me to LAX, you piece of shit.

39:58.000 --> 40:05.000
Do you think we would ever see in our lifetime, like just an end to, I mean, like, like what,

40:05.000 --> 40:11.000
do you think before we die, we'll just see at least on the internet some kind of like,

40:11.000 --> 40:18.000
like Japanese press release video or something, like the technology that eliminates somehow.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
Just no more shitting in the toilet.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
I would love that.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
I would love it.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
I don't know.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
It's either like a vacuum type of, like just like it being.

40:27.000 --> 40:32.000
Like you stand in a booth and a purple line goes down your body and then there's no more

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
poop-oos in your body.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
Purple line, yeah.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
It beams it out of your Portland.

40:37.000 --> 40:43.000
Or you just have an implant that, that as you, as your food becomes poop, there's like a,

40:43.000 --> 40:51.000
there's a point in your intestinal tract where there's like a portal to, to, to a shared

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
toilet in Portland.

40:55.000 --> 41:01.000
Yeah, what if it was like, you know, you're like, okay, buy, buy this new, you, you swallow

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
like basically a, you know, a Seth Brungo, like telepod.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
Yeah.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
And then you just, you just shit.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
You swallow a ring.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
It looks like an IUD.

41:09.000 --> 41:13.000
I think it was, or what's that, or there was like a, it's like a flexi thing and you swallow

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
it and then it like, it's designed to like.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
Put a stargate in your ass.

41:17.000 --> 41:22.000
Like when it hits a certain point, it puts a, it puts a stargate not in your ass.

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
Put a star, and that, and that would be like a Sam Elliott type voice.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
Put a stargate in your ass.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
Actually, you know what?

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
Yeah.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
I'm thinking about this all wrong.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
Put it right in your, the rim of your ass.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Right.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
First of all, it feels good.

41:35.000 --> 41:43.000
Second of all, you get to still have like a baby, the feeling of taking a shit in your

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
pants.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
Well, I would think that.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
And it's just going into a portal.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
Into a portal.

41:47.000 --> 41:55.000
And then on some alien planet, this is the Starship Troopers, like pre-movie or whatever.

41:55.000 --> 42:00.000
Like there are all these insect people are like going, well, it's raining again.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Where is this coming from?

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
We just tracked it.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
It's just this Earth's place.

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
It just says it's five years into the future.

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
You know, like that's how short-sighted we are as a culture.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
It just says it's five years into the future.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
We're like, come on.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
We'll worry about it later.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
Yeah.

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
Well, luckily we won't be around too much longer on this planet.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
Yeah.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
We're not going to be.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
I don't think so.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Not to bum everybody out.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
Yeah, but a year.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
I doubt we're going to be on this planet very much longer.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Please don't worry about bumming them out.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
They're idiots.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
Man.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
Like the difference between them being bummed out.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
I don't think you're idiots.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
We're excited about life.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
I don't think you're idiots.

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
The difference between a fly having a saddle on it or not.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
Like who's going to notice?

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
You can't ride a fly.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
He's insulting you.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
He doesn't mean it.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
He doesn't mean it.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
He doesn't mean it.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
Right, Dan?

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
You don't mean it.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
I mean it.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
He doesn't mean it.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
No, this is part of my therapy.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
I've become too reliant on people's approval.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
Right.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
What I've always been good at is abuse.

43:04.000 --> 43:09.000
So I'm using that to wean myself off of your expectations.

43:09.000 --> 43:14.000
If it hurts you, it seems to be making me happy.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
It's not going to hurt you.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
You're sociopaths.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
You don't have feelings.

43:18.000 --> 43:25.000
The idea that I've been doing something or anything for people because you have feelings.

43:25.000 --> 43:32.000
It's been my problem that I've been making your problem for 40 years.

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
I need to figure out who the fuck I am.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
Me too.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
Yeah.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
Me too.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
What do I like?

43:39.000 --> 43:43.000
This is the regarding Henry stage of our lives.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
We need to regard our Henrys.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
Yeah.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Do I like rich crackers?

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
Or eggs?

43:48.000 --> 43:57.000
I like eggs more.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
Any pep in town?

43:58.000 --> 44:02.000
What's going on in your personal life?

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
Don't touch the question.

44:03.000 --> 44:09.000
Do you like eggs or it's crackers?

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
Thank you.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
I think I'll go with the cracker.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
That'd be good.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
Yeah.

44:14.000 --> 44:19.000
What are you hiding?

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
Yeah.

44:20.000 --> 44:24.000
Crackers are more utilitarian.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
It's never a bad time for a cracker.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
Right.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
It's never a bad time for a cracker.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
So you're pro cracker.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
You're pro cracker.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
Just say it.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
You're pro cracker.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
I'm pro cracker.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
Yeah.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
Definitely pro cracker.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
Wasn't too hard.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
Wasn't hard at all.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
Okay.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
I'm with the show.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Eddie Pepitone.

44:46.000 --> 44:55.000
I thought that was me.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Yes, dad.

44:57.000 --> 45:01.000
Can we talk about your love life a little bit?

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
If you want to.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
Sure.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
Sure.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
It's incredible.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
Sorry.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
I'm lying.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
No.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
No.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
I mean my love life.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
My love life is incredible.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
Yeah.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
Buckle in, baby.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
Buckle in.

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
There should be a bidet right under you right now.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
You don't know.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
You don't know.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
You don't know.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
You don't know.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
You don't know.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
Yes.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
I'm married.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
Oh, you're married.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
I'm married.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
To Mrs. Pepitone?

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
She did not take my name.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
Yeah.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
What her last name must be awesome then.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Because Pepitone's pretty rad.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
It is, right?

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
I would marry you for her.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
I was hurt by that actually.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Just a little hurt.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Like I was like, so baby.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
I called my wife baby.

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
I'm like, so baby, how are we going to do this?

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Are you going to be?

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
How are we going to do this?

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
This is becoming like.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Are you going to make it?

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
And she was like, you know, she didn't flint.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
You know, she's like, I want to stay with Karen Simmons.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
Makes sense.

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
Yeah.

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
I mean, if you really think, if you were like from Mars,

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
and someone explained that rule.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
Yeah.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
If they get married and the woman's last name changes.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
You'd be like, what?

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
That doesn't make really any sense.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
It's just what we're used to.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
Right.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
And we actually, to the point where we also use it to express,

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
for instance, joy or, you know, like for somebody,

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
I'm not knocking on any woman out there that like happily took

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
her husband's name.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
Like it doesn't, you're not, you're not a sell out anymore

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
than anyone that doesn't want to do that as an enemy of the state.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
It's like, but it's just crazy that like,

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
it is, it is just a crazy random rule.

46:41.000 --> 46:45.000
You know, like it's just weird with probably roots and like

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
horrible stuff.

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
But, but, but, you know, it's in Spain.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
I took a Spanish class at community college.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
And they were,

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
Oh, I love Spanish.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
That whole, that whole like name thing.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
Oh my God.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
Here we go again.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
They have like a, they have like this whole rule.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
You know, like this whole set of rules where it's like,

47:01.000 --> 47:05.000
it's like your last name gets longer and longer or something.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
Like I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't figure it out.

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
I insisted that Kate keep her last name.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Did she want your last name?

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
She made you.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
She made you.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
Schrab, right?

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
Yeah.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Schrab is not, and this is not anything personal.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
It's just not a good last name.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
It, it just, I mean,

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
Pepitone, Pepitone has a fucking ring to it.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
Oh yeah.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
You know, but Schrab, it's a,

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
it sounds like a product.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
Yeah.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
Of some sort.

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
Like, have you used the Schrab today or,

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
you know what I mean?

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
Like, if you don't use a Schrab,

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
you could get seriously ill.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
You know what I mean?

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
I mean, so does Pepitone, but like an awesome product.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Like it makes your tires.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Smell like minty.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
Yeah.

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
It makes your tires minty.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Minty fish, Pepitone tires.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
3M, you're driving to the airport.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
You get a flat tire.

47:58.000 --> 48:02.000
It would be fine, but it stinks.

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
Tires are shit.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
Your car's insured, your flight can be changed,

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
but the smell in your nose is permanent

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
because you didn't use Pepitone.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
I'm Robert Stack.

48:16.000 --> 48:22.000
Pepitone, the tire smeller.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
We were thinking, some, I think,

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
I think it was Chris Hardwick who one time

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
he ran up to me said,

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
listen, we can make a lot of money

48:29.000 --> 48:33.000
if we do Pepitones on the iPhone

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
or some shit like that, like Pepitone.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
Why did he say...

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
Look, let me finish.

48:39.000 --> 48:43.000
The controller who uses a bidet.

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
A man should not use a bidet.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
Round of applause if you're with me on that.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
Fuck you.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
You haven't seen my ass.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
I like the booze.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
The booze, they're funny.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
Boo!

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Of course they should.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
Yes.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Of course they should.

49:03.000 --> 49:07.000
We're people, we're probe a day for men.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
Yes, it's...

49:08.000 --> 49:13.000
We're probe a day.

49:13.000 --> 49:16.000
I really don't, I really don't care.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
Yes, no you do.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
I'm trying to make it up, and that's why I shut up.

49:20.000 --> 49:24.000
And that's why, that's why you booing is funny to me

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
because I really can give a shit.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
You seem to switch your position.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
Like that.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
Like that.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
Do you do that?

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
That's part of being well liked.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
But then you had to clarify for everybody, you said,

49:37.000 --> 49:41.000
I really don't care after you completely flipped your position.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Like we know you don't care.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
You're like, I'm probe a day and then they applaud it

49:45.000 --> 49:49.000
and you're like, I don't care.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
Yes.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
I do that a lot, I don't know who I am.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Yeah, I don't know who I am either.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
My regarding Henry thing is...

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Spencer knows exactly who he is.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
No, I don't either.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
Yes, you do.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
It's great.

50:03.000 --> 50:07.000
I feel like I belong on this stage.

50:07.000 --> 50:11.000
We don't know who we are.

50:11.000 --> 50:16.000
I guess it's a lot less exciting for you guys.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
I can't wait for that new iPhone.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Oh yeah.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
Oh, yeah, oh yeah.

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
You're being definitely not serious, right?

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
I'm definitely being serious.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
It's got a screen that goes all the way in here.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
I know exactly what person this makes me

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
and I'm tired of the charade.

50:34.000 --> 50:42.000
If Apple tomorrow announced a thumb tack

50:42.000 --> 50:46.000
that read your pinky print

50:46.000 --> 50:51.000
and alerted you to nearby cork...

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
Nearby what?

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
Nearby cork.

50:53.000 --> 50:58.000
It's the iTack.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
We asked ourselves what is a thumb tack

51:01.000 --> 51:06.000
and the answer was it's not a pin.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Nor should it be.

51:08.000 --> 51:12.000
And we set about changing fundamentally

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
the experience between the person who wants to pin something

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
to a bulletin board and the pin itself.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
This is iTack.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
I would fucking buy it.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
I would buy it.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
You would buy it?

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
Let me put an asterisk on this

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
because I deserve the humiliation.

51:34.000 --> 51:42.000
I wouldn't buy it if it was affordable.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
It would have to be egregiously priced.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
It would have to be a $49 thumb tack

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
for me to go like, well, there must be something to this.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
And I would do it.

51:54.000 --> 51:58.000
Here's some other things I would do.

51:58.000 --> 52:02.000
If you told me when I went to the airport

52:02.000 --> 52:06.000
that for $70 extra on my ticket

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
I was allowed to stand in a red circle.

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
That was in a less comfortable place.

52:12.000 --> 52:15.000
I would opt for that.

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
If you called it like platinum plus red circle program

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
I would stand in the red circle.

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
When I go to the airport I go like,

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
let's see if they have a lounge

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
and Cody and Jeff are always like,

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
fucking lounges suck.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
There's a seat here at the McDonald's or whatever

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
and they get a full bar and I'm like,

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
we don't even know the lounge.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
We got to go to the lounge.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
And they go to the lounge and they're like,

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
it's $50 extra but I'm a member.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
You're a member to a club that lets you pay $50.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
And how much for my friends?

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
And then you go and there's nowhere to sit

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
and there's like crying babies

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
are being dumped in the lounge.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
In the fucking duct?

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
In the lounge?

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Yeah, in the lounge.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
You can see through a tinted window

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
that the regular ass poor people's seats are all empty

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
because everyone wants to be in the lounge.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
And I'm no exception.

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
Is there a package where I can strap the babies

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
to my feet and just like walk around on them

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
and be more uncomfortable

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
but more importantly, more important.

53:17.000 --> 53:21.000
I'm a terrible person.

53:21.000 --> 53:25.000
And I can't wait to get that fucking iPhone X

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
because the iPhone 8 is for poor people.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
Is the 8 out?

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
Yeah, same time as the X.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
They're releasing the new phone for the poor people

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
which is only $18,000

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
because you're poor

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
and you don't want to let being poor slow you down

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
get a new iPhone poor people phone.

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
But then there's the real phone.

53:55.000 --> 53:58.000
For me, the $27 million phone.

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
It doesn't have a home button. They took the home button off, Eddie.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
You know that...

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
I hate my home button.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
I don't like the home button either.

54:07.000 --> 54:10.000
What's that button doing on my phone? I want it gone.

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
Every time I touch it, I have to swallow my vomit down.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
I feel like a poor person.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Why am I touching a button?

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
What am I fucking, like some kind of fucking refugee?

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Yeah.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
It's disgusting.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
I want a phone.

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
Only people in Aleppo have the 8.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Right?

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Yeah.

54:39.000 --> 54:42.000
Don't laugh too hard at that.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Right?

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
Yeah. No, I'm looking forward to the new phone.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
I'm looking forward to the new...

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Me and my family are looking forward to the new phone.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Every day I get up, you know,

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
you asked me about my love life

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
and it centers around the iPhone coming out.

54:58.000 --> 55:01.000
And, you know, I'm like, honey, did it come out?

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
And she's like, not yet, baby.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Are you kidding or not? I get it.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
No, I am. I am kidding,

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
but I so relate to you about the marketing of it.

55:11.000 --> 55:15.000
Like, I hardly fucking use anything on it,

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
except turn it on and go,

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Hello? What?

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
I am not an idiot.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
I'm always like, why are you calling me?

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
Whenever my phone rings, I'm like, what the fuck went wrong?

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
I know.

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
I swear, three times a week, I'm saying to somebody,

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
how did you get this number?

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
It stopped being a phone now.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
It's pretty intense.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
It's just text. It is a text.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
I barely checked my email now.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Now it's all text or I have the Slack channel, whatever.

55:47.000 --> 55:51.000
The phone rings and I'm like, who the fuck...

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
What are you doing?

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
Hello, Mr. Harmon.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
I just called about your medical procedure on Tuesday.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

55:57.000 --> 56:00.000
I have an assistant.

56:00.000 --> 56:04.000
Why are you calling me about medicine?

56:04.000 --> 56:09.000
Lose this number, Marjorie.

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
But wait, wait, wait, fuck.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Face recognition is...

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
The phone recognizes your face?

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
Fucking good. Good.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
I hope the phone recognizes everyone's face.

56:20.000 --> 56:23.000
Remember when we were concerned about biometrics?

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
Where'd that go?

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
I was never concerned.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Remember when the sign of a true anarchist

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
as you were worried about products being technically...

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
I was so concerned about biometrics.

56:32.000 --> 56:38.000
Remember that summer when we were all like...

56:38.000 --> 56:41.000
Biometrics, man.

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
I know. I know.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
You know how you preach into the pelicans, man.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Fucking biometrics.

56:47.000 --> 56:51.000
Those bio-Ms are just really...

56:51.000 --> 56:55.000
I can't even get up in the morning, man.

56:55.000 --> 56:59.000
My fucking wife is getting down on me on her biometrics.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
I'm like, baby, I don't know.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
I can't even handle my own biometrics,

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
let alone yours.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
I got another cigarette in this...

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
In these...

57:09.000 --> 57:12.000
I'm up to three packs a day,

57:12.000 --> 57:16.000
like, you know, all these biometrics.

57:16.000 --> 57:19.000
I'm not even talking to anybody right now.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
I'm just sitting on the porch,

57:21.000 --> 57:26.000
just talking to myself and smoking pencil.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Fucking biometrics, man.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
If it's not one thing, it's another.

57:30.000 --> 57:33.000
If it's not one metric, it's another, man.

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
It's either biometrics, neometrics,

57:36.000 --> 57:40.000
decometrics, octometrics.

57:40.000 --> 57:44.000
These metrics are just fucking taken over, man.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
They're taking my job.

57:46.000 --> 57:50.000
They're taking my family fucking biometrics.

57:50.000 --> 57:53.000
Some candidate should come along

57:53.000 --> 57:57.000
and get rid of these biometrics.

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
But you grew up kind of lower middle class, right?

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Peppertown? You were no IV here.

58:09.000 --> 58:12.000
Yes, lower middle class, exactly.

58:12.000 --> 58:17.000
Both my parents were teachers in New York City.

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
And teachers.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Teachers!

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Teachers! Cursory knowledge!

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
School! School!

58:27.000 --> 58:32.000
Being bred for corporate culture!

58:32.000 --> 58:36.000
No real learning anymore!

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
No philosophy!

58:38.000 --> 58:43.000
Just you're being plugged in to a machine!

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
School!

58:45.000 --> 58:51.000
But yeah, I grew up as a lower middle class kid.

58:51.000 --> 58:55.000
Did your parents beat you?

58:55.000 --> 59:02.000
You know, my dad, my mom was extremely gentle.

59:02.000 --> 59:05.000
My father, Sicilian, so he had...

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
And it's true about the Sicilian...

59:07.000 --> 59:13.000
He beat you if someone paid him.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Look, son, you didn't mow the lawn.

59:15.000 --> 59:19.000
I'm gonna beat the shit out of you as soon as I find someone that...

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Watch me.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Look at your report card!

59:23.000 --> 59:28.000
If I get $50, your ass is mine!

59:28.000 --> 59:31.000
Jimmy Three-toes is coming down.

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
Jimmy Three-toes, Marvin the...

59:34.000 --> 59:38.000
The ex-the-god is coming down.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Oh, here we go on another riff.

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
No, no, no, I think we are. This is the list of mafia guys.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
Oh, nope, he shook it off. Okay, he's not gonna do it.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
I shook it off. I shook it off.

59:48.000 --> 59:57.000
I always felt deprived about that though, because my Sicilian family had no connections at all...

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
To the cosenoes drill, the black...

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
I mean, that would have been a nice cart for me to play.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:09.000
When I was getting my ass kicked in school, like, hey, you touch me, you're gonna deal with the black hand.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Or some shit like that.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
When's the last time you saw Godfather 2?

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Oh, me. That's me telling the kids.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000
No, I just watched Godfather 2.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Remember, Robert De Niro plays Brando's character in Five Facts.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000
And then they walk you through, he's just a regular guy, he's in New York,

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
and then there's this guy who's like the guy in the white coat, you know, he's like Don Camucci.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, the guy he kills, yeah.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000
And then De Niro's like, oh, who's that guy? Who, what's with him?

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
And they're like, and Bruno Kirby's like...

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
That guy, oh, that guy!

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
He owns everything, he owns everything!

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000
And everything's like, oh, it's in his neighborhood, oh, it's everything, oh, mama mia!

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000
And then he's like, oh, I think I'll take care of it, I'll take care of it.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000
And they're like, what are you gonna do? No one else can do what you're doing.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
He's like, trust me.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000
And you're just like on the edge of your seat, like wow, we're really watching the origin,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
we're watching the evolution of the American mafia.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000
I think it'd be funny if all Sicilians would like that, because my dad was a history teacher,

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
and it'd be funny if he taught class like that.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Look, the only thing I could tell you is that the Romans had their way.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000
And he just walked out of the fucking class.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.000
They had their way, they had their message.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Read up on the catapult.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:42.000
But Robert De Niro, as you may recall, as Brando in his youth, the character, Don Corleone,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:51.000
he climbs up on a roof, and he walks across rooftops so that he can get into the apartment building.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Yes, what was that about?

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Of the mafia, Don, who holds little Italy in his iron grip.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Because of that kind of capish white thing he wears.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
He has no bodyguards, he doesn't hang out with anyone.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.000
All he ever does is walk around an alien at everyone and say that he owns the neighborhood.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Then he goes home to a one-bedroom apartment in a dark stair landing where you can access,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:17.000
but if you just go up on the roof, also the front door, what a work!

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:25.000
And he wraps a towel around his hand with a gun, and he goes like, hey, and he's like, oh no,

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.000
the one contingency for which they did not prepare.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
He's shot by a rifle.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Oh, you found the black hands kryptonite.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Bang, bang, oh, I can't believe.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Who would have thought of this?

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
There's bullets in my body.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
How did I ever, oh!

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000
And then De Niro's character is like, now I'm the guy.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
And everyone's like, can I have some money?

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
He's like, I don't have any, but...

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:59.000
So the reason why De Niro kept becoming the guy is because nobody could find a towel.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Very funny if you think about it.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000
It was cool though, the one thing that sticks out in your head is that the towel starts on fire.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Remember, he wraps it around.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Does it even work? Does that make a gunshot sound like less of a gun?

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
I use a pillow.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Just usually a throw pillow I hate because I hate the stains on throw pillows.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000
It starts on fire and then he's like whipping his hand around.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
It's kind of cool.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Scorsese's a good director, I'm not being a real controversial there.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Yeah, Scorsese directed the shit out of that.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000
When he did Godfather 2, his fucking nailed it.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
He nailed you, he nailed you.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
You know, when I think of his best taxi driver, Godfather 2...

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Edit it, edit it out!

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:46.000
If you would have had the iPhone X, it would have saved you from that.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
It'd be funny if that's what the X does, it interrupts you.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Like you're about to say Scorsese and it just buzzes in your pocket.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000
And you look at it and it says Coppola.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I can't even hear anybody over the sound of my fucking humiliation.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Coppola!

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Really? Who gives a shit?

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I don't know, it's...

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000
You don't know Coppola directed Godfather 2? Why are you doing a podcast?

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000
People just have turned off around the country.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Like, turn it off, Margaret!

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
He said Scorsese.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Yes, he called a stupid idiot, but he got that trivia wrong.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
I've had enough!

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I've had enough to hear with this guy!

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Not fact checking his riffs.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000
It's not like I can fall back on my fidget spinner knowledge.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
What is your fidget spinner knowledge?

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
No, I don't know their things.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Let's fall back on your fidget spinner knowledge.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
So I can't...

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I don't have any fidget spinner knowledge.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
You know what they are.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
That's why I'm supposed to know Coppola from Scorsese.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Because I don't invest in fidget spinner information.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:07.000
If I'm going to forget that Coppola is not Scorsese, why am I not into Pokemon?

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
That tracks.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
That tracks.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:16.000
It's either current events or curmudgeon guardian of nostalgia.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
What am I? I'm a drifting fucking wraith.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Dude, what is going on with you tonight?

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
What happened? Did something happen?

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Nothing new.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Is that what's happening? Is it nothing new?

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:36.000
You think that all descents into darkness have to have some simple...

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Oh, a potato fell on my head while I was fighting Pete's dragon.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000
What's your thing about descents into darkness, Rob?

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000
You think it's that fucking simplistic?

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
I'm taking sides with you.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.000
I wasn't here last weekend, and I was here the weekend before,

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
and you were delightful that weekend, and now...

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
I think he's delightful tonight.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
He is delightful.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
He just doesn't seem very happy right now, and I'm concerned.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I'm going through changes.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Why do we have to be happy all the time? I don't get that.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
It's true.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
No, I don't get it.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Moving with the memory islands and the different colored marvels that represent feelings?

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Yeah.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
The memory island.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Sadness is a part of happiness.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
I don't think it's wrong to be concerned.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
What's that?

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000
I don't think it's wrong to be concerned if somebody you care about is not happy.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000
I was in Duncan's podcast, and I was like, yeah, I kind of bumped out, and I don't care.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.000
He's like, well, that's because you got to just let eight people from Burning Man live here, man.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
And I was like, I'm not going to do that.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I'm not going to yese in that suggestion.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
I know that makes me a bad person.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I don't want a bunch of hippies living in my house.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Yeah, but that would make you happy.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
But why not, man?

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Because I'm evil, because I'm evil.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
I don't think that's evil.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I don't think that's evil.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
I think it's evil.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:13.000
I think it's evil not to let eight Burning Man people live in your house.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:19.000
We all know that the solution is we have to stop.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Capitalism is killing us, and we have to decentralize non-hierarchical, human-based societies.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
I've known this forever.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000
But I'd say in a podcast, I'd go like, hey, capitalism sucks.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
And then people on Reddit would go, then give all your money away.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Yeah, right.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
You got me.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
God damn it.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
You got me.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:50.000
I love my money.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
It's 9-Eleven.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000
9-Eleven.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
It's 9-Eleven.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
I lived through, fuck it.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000
I was living in New York.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:00.000
So did I. Yeah, you were shit. You pieces of shit. I'm a bad man with 9-Eleven.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Bunch of L.A. people yelling about 9-Eleven when I lived through it.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
9-Eleven.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Oh, you mean you were in New York?

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Yeah, I was right.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
That is a high road you could take.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
That's what he did.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
I thought you just assumed they were so young.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
You were just like, you didn't fucking live through 9-Eleven.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Oh, no, no.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000
No, they weren't there like I was there, you know?

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Right.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
And I was in bed when it happened, but...

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
And my friend called.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
But I was close to it.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
I was close to it.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000
I got up and I lived like in the village and not to brag.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
And I...

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
We watched the towers come down from his window.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
He had an apartment looking straight at the towers, you know?

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:51.000
David Cross said he could see people, like, leaping.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
That's something...

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
People don't talk about that, but, you know, there was a lot of people jumping

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
and they kind of just killed all footage of it.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
And kind of was like, that didn't happen.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
I can't even...

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000
I mean, that has to be like the epitome of...

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
I don't even know what the word is.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
It's just sort of like...

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:16.000
It's like you're watching a human being who is identical to you.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:22.000
And what you know about them on a fundamental level is that they were in such pain

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000
and fear that they preferred...

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Yeah.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.000
And you're just like, I don't know why am I explaining this.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000
We all know...

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
But it's just like, wow, holy shit.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Yeah, and they're yelling out 9-11.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Well, it's been a few years and we...

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
A few years?

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000
We like to have fun.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
You've been doing it for years!

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.000
9-11, people jump from buildings!

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Yeah, but where would we get as a society

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000
if every time something was genuinely tragic or filled with pathos,

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000
we paid it respect by avoiding it?

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Oh, let's all prove that we're polite.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Let's keep our elbows off the table, our feet off the table.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Let's not sit at the table.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Let's put the table in bronze.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:11.000
All right, look, I'm not getting the analogy, but...

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
No one's ever done that before.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.000
You can do that?

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
You mean just saying...

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
You can.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
That's a move with Harmon.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000
You can just say...

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.000
You're saying nonsense, that's not a metaphor.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
That's been an option this whole time.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000
But you know, when you found out, if you hit the bumper button,

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
you turned 180 degrees.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
I was like, holy fuck, what?

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
I don't have to...

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
But what you're saying is true,

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000
and this country, and the people of this country,

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
and this audience in particular,

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.000
we have no memory of history in this country.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000
And that's why what's going on is going on.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
There's no fucking...

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Matter of fact, Gore Vidal is one of my favorites.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
You like Gore Vidal?

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
I fucking love Gore Vidal.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000
And you guys like Gore Vidal?

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
He's great.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
And he wrote a book called...

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000
The United Amnesia...

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Damn it.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
This is me forgetting to flush the toilet.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
I love the guy who brings up Gore Vidal.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
That book!

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Something about amnesia.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Yeah.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
I'm the biggest fan of Gore Vidal.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.000
And his boo...

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
I believe you, I believe you.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Thank you for believing me.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000
I believe that you will...

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
The United States of Amnesia.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
He called it.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
I think the biggest contributor to my bad mood

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.000
is that I have a...

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Here's a weird thing about me.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
I'm triggered by Nazis running in the street.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
I have this crazy thing

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000
where I think that it's better to be overreactive

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000
to Nazism.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Jump the gun if you can on that one.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Someone reminds you a little bit of Hitler?

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Say it earlier.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Worst case scenario?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000
You called someone Hitler too early.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Best case scenario?

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000
You stopped a Hitler!

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Well, that is the scariest thing.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
I mean, look at the silence about it.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
That's the thing that I...

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
That's what's got me so grumpy lately.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
So there's your answer, by the way.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:44.000
I got it eventually.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
I got off of Twitter the minute

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000
I started seeing the anti-communist stuff.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
When that became a meme or whatever the fuck you call it,

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
that became a thought where I was like,

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
oh, there's a lot of anti-Nazi talk.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
So now, just watching history repeat itself of people going,

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000
oh, communism's responsible for even more debt.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
I'm out. I'm out.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
If I keep listening to these kids,

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
I'm going to fucking kill myself,

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
and that's what they want,

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000
so I'm going to live all over their asses.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
They don't deserve it.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Are you off of Twitter?

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Because it's really great.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
It's really great.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
I love Twitter, especially lately.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
I'm kidding. I'm so kidding.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
I was using it wrong.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
I am healthier now.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
I don't seem happier, but I am healthier.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
My sadnesses and angers are real now.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
I was using Twitter wrong.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
I'm so glad that Lauren Duke is on it.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Just Sarah Thyre,

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
I feel like people are saving the world on Twitter.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
I can't use it right.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Me either.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
I just sit there and read shit,

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
and I fucking my whole brain changes,

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
but I don't want to be one of these people that's like,

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
I don't want to deal with it.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
I'm good either.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
That's normalizing, right?

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
You're part of the problem.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
I didn't know a fascist coup

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
would be aggravating or exhausting.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
No, that it is.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
I think I'll focus on my backyard garden.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
That's an enemy. That's what I've become.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
That's what I am.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
That's what I'm doing, but at least if I own that,

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
then maybe my backyard garden will turn into

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
a...

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Hitler poison?

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
What's in your backyard garden?

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
What fruits?

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Avocados?

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
You have avocados?

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
I pay people to grow the backyard garden.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Anyways.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Yeah.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Well, just the reason why people...

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
One of the big reasons why people are so quiet

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
about the fascism

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
that's taking over this country,

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
because there's so...

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
I mean, we talked about the iPhone movies,

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
just constant tell,

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
fucking Netflix.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
People are much more interested

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
in their Netflix cues

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
than they are in

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
the country going down the shitter.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
You know what I mean? They're just so distracted

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
by every fucking thing.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
And Twitter is another one.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
You know, they're like...

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
They have no...

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Yeah, but I don't...

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
I definitely don't want to...

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
I don't think that the masses are being

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
willfully cowardly or stupid

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
or in more in love with iPhones

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
or worrying about the fascist takeover

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
of the United States.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
I give them, at least enough credit,

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
that, oh, no, they're very, very

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
interested in the fact

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
that we're being taken over.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
But they don't do anything about it.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Thank you.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
But I also...

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
I have to look within myself and I go,

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
are you exhausted? Are you bored?

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Are you fucking...

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
And I go, yes, I am.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
And that's exactly what's happening.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Like, if somebody, like, tweets me

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
a month after

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
November and says,

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
just get back to me, can you...

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
You shit, you fucking faggot.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
And I'm not...

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Sorry about that, by the way.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Man who doesn't flush his toilet.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
I have a lot of vices.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I was able from, you know,

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
okay, December, I'm like,

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
nice try, sucker.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Get back to work indeed.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Get used to it.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
None of us are getting back to what we do.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Get back to what you do.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
America!

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Another month, another month, another month goes by

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
and it's like, it's not that...

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
I eventually was like, man, I should really get back to

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
making my cartoon. It's not like I ever stopped.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
It was just like, it was like, as I got...

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
I just fucking crashed

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
and then one more person is like,

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
why don't you just shut the fuck up?

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
And I was like,

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
you deserve me to shut the fuck up,

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
because you're gonna fucking die

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
without me to save you.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
I see your...

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
And I raise you up.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Who the fuck cares you were born?

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
I hate you!

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Not you in the red shirt.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
I made sure you didn't make the boop sound.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Did you? Okay. Piece of shit next to you?

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
No? Okay. You? Fuck you!

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Stand up, face them!

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
What's your name? Derek!

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Boo!

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Half cheers, half boos!

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
That's what you get!

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
That's what we all get.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
This is like the end of the...

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
It's like the end of the...

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Mark Wahlberg Rockstar movie?

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Rockstar.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
I'm gonna slightly...

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
And then you start taking the microphone

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
and I go in the audience and I'm like,

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
and you can just join...

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Have a fun 20 years,

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
white piece of shit.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Have fun trying

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
to figure out if you're a good person

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
by seeing how many people like you.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
On a fucking app.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Oh, shit.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Next week's episode,

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
I'm gonna kill myself on this stage.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Are you...

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Duncan Tressel will not let you do that.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
He won't be here.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Me undies will be.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Warby Parker,

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Squarespace.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Oh, yeah, Warby Parker.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
It's a pay-per-view event.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
I'm going to...

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
I'm gonna blow my brains out.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Can I back up your point?

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
What? Where are you gonna back?

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
You want a microphone so you can...

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Whatever.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Well, no, I like your hesitance.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
You've earned a microphone.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
This happens on this show.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Charlie.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
That's my name.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
The disinterest of people

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
caring about the fact that Trump is president,

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
they've normalized it completely

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
at this point. Like, they don't care.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
You gotta eat the mic.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Let me eat the mic. No, you're doing it.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Yeah, they don't care.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
It's been nine months.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
They're over it.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
And it seems to be

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
the fact of the matter that

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Hillary is old news.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Great. No one cares.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Bernie Burroughs still fucking...

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Oh, he would have won.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Great. Thank you, DSA of Brooklyn, New York.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
I appreciate you guys.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
But no, I'm really sick of

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
fucking people like

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
acting like it's normal that we have a fucking

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
reality fucking TV star

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
as president. It's like disgusting.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
It's... It represents

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
like us to the world in some weird

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
fashion, but it also should be like

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
a wake-up call for every fucking person

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
out here that

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
there's nothing normal about the world we exist

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
in as United States

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
of America.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
I love you, Dan.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
I appreciate Dan, too, but...

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Oh, I thought his name was Dan.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
I'm sorry.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
What was that? I love you.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
No, he's Charlie.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
And the fact that people can actually

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
normalize that is...

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
I think people are scared. They know how

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
militarized the police are.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
They know how militarized every...

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
They're scared.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
They just decided that we can... Jeff Sessions

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
just decided that they can sell

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
fucking military gear back to

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
police forces now.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
So we can have tanks. We can have

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
fucking bulletproof riot shields.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
We can have fucking automatic weapons.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
It's fucking weird.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
No one wants to...

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Woke is a fucking weird word at this point,

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
but no one wants...

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
No one wants to understand that this is

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
not normal, and it stresses me out.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Yeah, I mean...

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
It's woke-up chupole.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
No, no. None of that shit.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Get that shit out of my face.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
That's the thing, though, is I don't want to...

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
It's not...

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
I think we're just used to a society

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
where actually being aware of shit

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
had its own momentum and a bunch of shit

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
done. If you kind of

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
halfway thought that

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Stephen Colbert was out of line on his last

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
show or retweeted a hashtag,

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
like, you might find out six weeks later

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
either A, oh, that person wasn't worth

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
any money and they lost their job, or that person

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
was Stephen Colbert, so fuck you, your opinion

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
didn't matter.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
But it still felt like momentum

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
happened just by you, like, knowing

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
shit, caring about shit, being

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
afraid of shit, not putting up with shit.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
And we've entered a world where

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
you can fucking not...

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
you can not put up with

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
as much as you want. You can care,

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
you can feel, you can fear, and

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
actually, that just jiggles

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
the jello. It stays the same shape

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
as it was, and

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
we're all reacting to that

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
I don't even want to say

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
poorly. Like, however

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
we react, that's the right way to react,

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
because all of us want to

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
get back to a system, or achieve a system

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
where the way that we came out of our

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
mamas was, like, the right way

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
to be, that we didn't have to, like, mold

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
ourselves and socialize ourselves

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
and be enforced by some set of rules

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
in order for us to get along

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
with some larger thing. We all want to

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
get to a system that some of us felt

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
like we had, where it was, like, yeah, but if you

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
kind of hear yourself, like, the truth

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
will out, and, like, all this stuff will happen,

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
and we're really, like, we've

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
come face to face with a system where we're

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
like, oh, shit, you mean I don't fucking matter

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
at all? I truly don't matter. And then

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
other people are going, welcome to the club,

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
that's how it felt for 20 years, and we're like, fuck you,

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
that defends me, ah!

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
And it makes me

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
like everyone else

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
just want people to talk about

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Kmart and Stephen King's

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
it, and all this shit.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
And so, whereas

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
initially it was the alt-right saying everybody

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
get back to work, or it was, like, red necks

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
that were embarrassed that they voted for a guy

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
that turned out to actually mean it when he said he wanted

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
to build a wall, whereas they thought he was

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
actually just gonna, like, be fiscal or something.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Like, like, like,

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
like, now it's just

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
everybody saying

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
I'm bored with this, get back to work,

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
entertain me, make jokes, just

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
talk about shit, and I'm like, I'm

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
feel you, like, the exact same time

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
as I feel you, I am as exhausted as you,

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
so now, I'm getting

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
back to work, I'm just being a clown,

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
I have nothing, I don't know

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
what to do either, I don't know

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
who to vote for, what to do, what pie to throw

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
at, what bandana to put on my face,

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
I don't know what to do,

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
I'm just gonna get back to my comedy podcast,

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
but guess what? My comedy

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
podcast was always me

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
complaining about how I don't understand

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
what the fuck is going on, and everyone

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
should leave me alone, stop telling me to tie my shoes.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
So now, my fucking podcast

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
really sucks!

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Like, beyond

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
whatever you could imagine, it's just

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
like me going like, I'm just collapsing

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
in on myself, like

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
the star I always was.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
And becoming a black hole

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
from which all light can escape

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
because it's a very low-stakes

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
black hole, but...

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Low-stakes black hole, my

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
favorite punk band.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
You asked me that

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
earlier, but

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
my love life is good, yeah.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
I'm married

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
and we have pretty regular

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
sex

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
like, whether I want it

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
or not, that kind of thing.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Well, thank you.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
That was great, man.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Shout out

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000

Check that out if you don't like the

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
world that you're living in. Right, Chapo.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I think we might get something from Chapo on the...

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Also, Harmon Quest, check it out

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000

Yeah.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Or, if the world

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
you're living in doesn't smell, alright, Fulton and Rourke

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
solid-clone needs.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000

and they smell great come in one of

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
14 different flavors.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Are you...

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
What are the 14 flavors?

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Lemon, hazelnut,

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
peppermint, sage,

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
rosemary,

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
sorry.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
I missed it.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Can you start over?

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
What, Dan?

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Are you still doing shows here?

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Yeah, I have two more Wednesdays here

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
the 20th and the 27th.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Go to starburnscastle.com

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Is that the...

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Starburnscastle.com

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Certainly Google Starburnscastle.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Get tickets to Peppitone. He's not going to let you down.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
This is a guy who

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
just when you think

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
you might be witness to

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
something awful, that's when

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Peppitone fucking fires up like the Hulk.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
That's right, that's right.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
This was just a tip of the iceberg.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Sorry about the bidet stuff.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
No, but you truly are amazing.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Don't apologize.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
I would recommend it

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
to anybody because

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
it's almost...

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
I really mean that.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Thank you.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.000
If you put Peppitone as a bidet, my ass is spotless.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
He does it, he immediately revealed

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
he has no bidet opinions.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
He's just like me. He just wants people to like him.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
It's like a bidet opinions who cares, right?

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
You don't care if anyone has a shit

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
hanging out of their ass.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
I get anxious about a jet of water hitting me.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
I do too.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
I'm like...

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
You walk through the fear.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Or sit through the fear, whatever it is.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Is there anything else?

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Because you donated your time and energy to us

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
that you want to plug?

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
I'm doing a show

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Dovetailing Into Collapsing

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
as a star.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
I'm doing a show, it's a one-man show.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
It's about how I wasn't loved.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
No, kidding.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
I'm doing a one-man show called End of Days.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
And it's

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
a bunch of characters

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
dealing with this stuff.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
I'm going to first do it

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
in Santa Barbara,

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
and then I'm going to find a space here.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
I like to announce things

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
before I even have a space for it.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
So you can't go...

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
And that's the way to do it, isn't that right?

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Yeah, that's the way to do it.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
He's a good controller.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
In your one-man show,

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
did I hear right,

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
you fight the devil at the end

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
of the launcher?

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Is that true?

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
You son of a bitch, don't you ruin it.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Oh, sorry.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
He asked you now.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
We'll be sure to...

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
We'll keep our eyes peeled

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
for where to get tickets to launch.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Keep your eyes really peeled.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
I don't know when

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
it's going to be anywhere.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Look at that.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Isn't it great?

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
One of the greatest

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
mimes of our time.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Let's thank Eddie Pepitone

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
for joining us again.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Eddie.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Eddie.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
I love this guy.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
I love this guy.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
I'm so glad you had him on the show today.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
He's great. I love Eddie.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Keep your eyes peeled.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Doesn't that expression actually gross you out?

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
I always picture...

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
When I was a kid,

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
I would picture a potato peeler

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
and an eyeball.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Yeah. Welcome to my world.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
That would not make you see better.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
I'm just saying

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
they should stop saying that.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
It doesn't work.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Nobody really does.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
I think it's like a Beverly Hillbillies thing.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Who actually says keep your eyes peeled?

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
We just did.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
We just did.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
I'm out now.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Good looking out.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
What?

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
That's what you sound like to me.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
What?

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
I don't know.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
I'm making it up.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
I get on a stage for two hours

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
and talk into a microphone.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Incredulity isn't an option for you.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
You could never be surprised

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
by anything I say.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
What are you saying?

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
What's happening? What's going on?

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Well, I'll tell you.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
I came up and I started talking.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
I don't know what I'm saying.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Sneaker!

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Shut up!

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
We should maybe try to transition you back

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
onto Twitter.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Just see what happens.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
It may have been useful.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
No, I'm sorry.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
I was doing a bit.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
It was great.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Steve Levy, are you...

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Steve Levy, are you here?

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
He's hiding in the corner.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
He'll be here.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
I said, Steve Levy, are you here

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
and he's still sitting with his legs

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
stretched out and he shrugged

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
and was like, yeah, I'm here.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
I mean, why do you think

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
I asked the question?

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Oh!

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Sorry, I...

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
It's okay.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
That's dumb, Steve.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
What the fuck?

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
I think I understand.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
I might have been about to say,

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Steve Levy, are you here?

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Duncan texted me when I was up here.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
The reason he didn't show up

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
is because no one ever contacted him.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000
That's the kind of thing that Steve would like to hear

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
standing up, I think.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
But I don't know if I made it clear to you

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
that maybe you should contact him.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
I don't know.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
All you said was he's booked.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
I didn't say he's booked. I never said those words.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
You said he's coming.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
I said Duncan wants to do the podcast.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
I did not say he's booked.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000
I don't know. I don't remember the words exactly.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Take another valium.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Hi! Hi, Rob.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
What are you doing?

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Rob, I really love your shirt.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
This is the part of the show

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
where you stand next to the podium?

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
I stand during D&D because my ass falls asleep

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
on these torture chairs.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Rob, are you wearing pajamas?

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Just the lower half.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
I love it.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
I like how you pronounce it.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Are you wearing pajamas?

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Rob, are you wearing pajamas?

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Yeah.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Excuse me.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Are you wearing flavor crystals in my class?

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Nobody believes me,

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
but I was this close to...

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Every once in a while, I think about

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
wearing my pajamas to the show

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
because I'm in my pajamas.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Tonight was one of those nights.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
I was like, put up pants.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
I would have been crazy.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Yeah, pajamas, bros.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Two pajamas up here.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Yeah, two grown boys.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
You know, I used to say

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
if you could make it through the whole day

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
without taking your pajamas off,

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
you're a pajampion.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
You're a what?

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
A pajampion.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
A pajampion?

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
A pajampion.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
It's like champion.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
A pajampion.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
What did I say?

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
The most explosive letter out.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.000
And also the most champion defining letter.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Right, right.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Okay, so you said pajampion.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Pajampion.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Pajampion. You said that.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
That's what you said.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
And I said what?

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Pajampion.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Oh, that's terrible.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Oh, my God.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
How embarrassing for me.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
And high five to you

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
I pronounced it.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
That is my word.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
I know it's your word

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
and it is clearly better

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
than the way I pronounced it

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
when I asked you what you just said.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
That is so much better.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
It's good. No, I'm on your side on this one.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
That's great.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
No, no, no, I'm great.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Steve, tell me you're a pajampion.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Tell me.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
I'm a pajampion.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Oh, you must be from a country

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
of like, Spencer, tell me you're a pajampion.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
I'm a pajampion.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Oh, you mean you won a contest involving pajamas?

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Of course.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Wait, what contest?

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
What comes down to that P?

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
What contest?

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
There was a contest.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
I couldn't hear what you were saying

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
so I repeated something

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
that I thought you said.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
I wasn't trying to nail it.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
I wasn't trying to nail it, Dan.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
I was trying to nail it.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
I was going, what did you just say?

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Did you just say this?

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
And I was like, oh, okay.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Sorry, question.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
They all float down here.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Is the new it movie in theaters?

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Oh, yeah.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
It's the number one movie at the box office.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
It's a huge movie.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
It's a huge hit.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Is there, the little boys don't fuck

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
the little girl in the movie?

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
No, no, no.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Well, then count me out.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
You'll get my money

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
when you do a proper adaptation.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Where is the Lysine dependency?

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Jurassic Park.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
All right, well, let's

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Pyjameon.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
I'm a pyjameon. You know something?

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
I like my way better.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Pyjameon.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
I am a pyjameon.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
I like it.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
It's mine. I pronounced it my way.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
I like it. It sounds better.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Yeah, it sounds like you're a citizen

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
of the realm of

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
pyjama. Yeah, I love it.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
It's great. I love it.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
It's a totally different concept.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
I didn't know what a pychampion was.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Pyjampion.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Not pychampion.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Pyjampion.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
P-A-J-A-M-P-I-O-N.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
What did I say?

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
I said the exact same thing that you just said.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Pychampion.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
I said the same thing.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
It sounds exactly the same thing.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
And I understood what you meant.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
I knew what you meant.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Schrab

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
when we were

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
in our 20s

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
told me that

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
he thought that the word utensil

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
was invented by smart people

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
to make him feel stupid

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
because the way he had heard the word

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
is people would say, do you have a writing utensil?

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
And he would say, why can't you just say a pen?

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
And I would say

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
because

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
they might want a pen.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
If you have a pencil in your pocket

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
then

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
they might be cheating themselves out of a pencil opportunity

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
if all they want is a writing utensil.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Then why can't you just say

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
pencil or pen?

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
You know what? Language is a living thing.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
What?

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
When did you say

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
when we were how old?

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
When we were in our what?

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
20s. 20 years ago.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
And we're in our what now?

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
You haven't changed?

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
It was a while ago.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
You had the utensil

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
argument recently?

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
It's a

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
pajambian thing. You're doing the same thing.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Why do you think I brought it up?

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
You're made up word?

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
It's the same thing.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
You're made up word?

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
It's the same thing.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
You're made up word?

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
The word you made up

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
that you were so proud of?

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
It's the same thing.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
You're made up word.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
It's the same thing.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
You're made up word in our 40s?

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
You haven't changed?

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
I've changed so much.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
You've changed in one place.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
You don't know.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
You've changed?

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
You started focusing on your butt.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Back then

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
that guy

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
he would have been like what's a bidet?

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
But now you're like, Oh get that.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Yeah. That's it.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Back then.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:42.520

dark night you like me stop down in my basement analyzing perfume man if Joker

Joker and the Riddler teamed up it would be confusing because yeah is this a

01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:10.440
Riddler is this a joke thank you thank you thank you I think DC is currently

01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:13.640
