Hello. Look at this green suit. That's fantastic. What's your name, sir? James in the green

00:18.320 --> 00:25.320
suit. I love it. Did you win the Augusta National? What happened? Super villain suit. All right.

00:25.320 --> 00:38.320
Hello, when and all. I'm your comptroller, Jeff Davis. Harmontown is now in session.

00:38.320 --> 00:47.040
It's good to be back. It feels like it's been a long, long time. Let's bring out our

00:47.040 --> 00:59.640
Game Master because I love him and adore him. Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden. What up, Spencer?

00:59.640 --> 01:07.680
Oh, yeah. How you feeling, man? I'm feeling couched. I got to couch. Yeah. You've upgraded

01:07.680 --> 01:20.360
from chair to couch. Oh, yeah. All right. For my hip, I'm 62. Is your hip hurting you? Oh, yeah. I'm dying.

01:20.360 --> 01:26.120
All right, we all, yeah. Speaking of dying, let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:26.120 --> 01:48.960
Yeah, rapid, rapid to the beat. Rapid, rapid, rapid, can't repeat. Dan, you sound like you might be a little

01:48.960 --> 02:01.040
under the weather. Yeah, I get sick like once every two years. I guess this is it. Stayed up a couple

02:01.040 --> 02:10.320
too, too many days and just caught something, I guess. Don't use this microphone. I might be playing

02:10.320 --> 02:15.560
it up a little bit. You know, you can do that. You sound like a Hall's mental elliptist commercial

02:15.560 --> 02:22.680
from the 90s. Death that could penetrate this derpy those. If you're 100% healthy, you can't fake

02:22.680 --> 02:30.360
like sounding sick. But if you're like 5% sick, you can crank it up to like 70% easy. You just have to like,

02:30.360 --> 02:38.080
it's actually a matter of just not doing anything. You just like, just don't, you just don't, you just do

02:38.080 --> 02:42.680
well so that you sound real sick. Is it the kind of sickness that you can enjoy? You have like tomato soup

02:42.680 --> 02:48.840
and grilled cheese sandwich and some hot cocoa and you watch TV or is it a bummer? It's kind of, look,

02:48.840 --> 02:54.120
I'm not in any physical pain. It's the kind of sick that's a manifestation of the psychological

02:54.120 --> 03:00.800
misery I'm in. It's self-imposed. My therapist and I are making some real breakthroughs, but

03:00.800 --> 03:07.400
unfortunately, it's like realizations of how fucked up I am. And, you know, like, she's really getting

03:07.400 --> 03:15.200
through to me. What is the, what's the headlines of your... Just like how I'm like a creature of denial,

03:15.200 --> 03:20.000
like how, like, you know, just kind of like stuff that, I don't know, it doesn't sound as profound

03:20.000 --> 03:26.760
when you repeat it, but like, you know, I've been not finishing the script for like weeks. So every

03:26.760 --> 03:31.920
week I go in there, and she's like the one person I don't have to lie to, that's not going to behoove

03:31.920 --> 03:37.480
me to lie to. So I was like, I could just go in and go, nope, nope, I didn't turn it in again. And

03:37.480 --> 03:42.360
instead of being like, oh, I'm almost done or whatever. And, you know, so it's been kind of a case

03:42.360 --> 03:49.000
study in like, you know, just the process and how it gets hung up and blocked and fucked up and

03:49.000 --> 03:56.160
like what's going on in my head, like how I managed to make like my process difficult. But this has

03:56.160 --> 04:00.680
got to be the last time I ever do this. I'm not doing it no more. I'm not writing anything by myself

04:00.680 --> 04:05.200
anymore. Because I can't do it. There's something wrong with me. Like that's what, that's what we

04:05.200 --> 04:09.760
figured out. And the thing is she's like, she's like, yeah, there's something wrong with you. She's

04:09.760 --> 04:14.240
like, I think you got to admit that there's something uncontrollable, you know, like that's what

04:14.240 --> 04:17.720
you have to do in situations like this, like you got to treat it like an addiction, like you're

04:17.720 --> 04:24.720
basically addicted to fucking up your deadlines, like you, you are like, like you, you will have a

04:24.720 --> 04:28.160
thought in your head. This is what I thought was interesting, because I think you can apply this

04:28.160 --> 04:34.320
to anything. And I'm sure it's like a talk to it's like, but it's like the idea that you can

04:34.320 --> 04:40.880
whatever you're up against, you know, there are some things that you can't control some thoughts

04:40.880 --> 04:48.280
you can't control. Like, and so procrastination or things like there's some some some things where

04:48.280 --> 04:53.480
like the reason why you keep doing the same fucked up shit over and over again is because the

04:53.480 --> 04:58.960
thought is in your head already, it's not you don't get a choice, you know, you're not there at

04:58.960 --> 05:04.400
the point where you're making the choice to think, you know, haven't you ever like, everybody's got

05:04.400 --> 05:09.120
something, whether you're a smoker or drinker, or, you know, I think it's more profound when it's

05:09.120 --> 05:13.640
not something like that, but it helps to use that stuff as metaphorically when you realize like,

05:13.640 --> 05:21.000
oh, look at your procrastination as like a, as like a cigarette, because what are you getting out

05:21.000 --> 05:24.680
of it? I don't know. I was like, I've been puzzling through it for weeks gone like, what is it? What

05:24.680 --> 05:29.080
am I addicted to the shame? Am I like afraid to be happy? And all that stuff sounds so corn ball.

05:29.080 --> 05:35.040
And then it was finally like, she's like, she's like, look, it doesn't matter. Like, it's like,

05:35.040 --> 05:40.440
the answer, it doesn't matter if you get if you figure that shit out or not, you're kind of addicted

05:40.440 --> 05:46.640
to trying to figure shit out first of all, like, that's part of the process is that you you, but

05:46.640 --> 05:52.480
I think what you have to accept is that there's like a wall of ice in your brain that like,

05:52.480 --> 05:58.200
is there before you choose it? I'm sorry, I'm repeating myself, but that like, that's the

05:58.200 --> 06:05.640
profound thing is that is that it's already there. And the only way to do anything about it is you

06:05.640 --> 06:13.880
got to accept that, okay, I'm going to be thinking this fucked up thought before way before I ever

06:13.880 --> 06:20.200
even it's there, it's like a time traveler, it's just there before it's pre fucked up whatever

06:20.200 --> 06:24.480
your relationship that if you've always fucked up your relationships, you know, over whatever

06:24.480 --> 06:28.760
way you're self destructive, it's like, like think of these things that always do you always

06:28.760 --> 06:34.520
seem to do stop waiting for you to like, figure out how to do it differently with an epiphany

06:34.520 --> 06:40.200
or something and just accept that, you know, first things first, like, I always do this,

06:40.200 --> 06:45.560
I'm always thinking this before I even decide I'm thinking it and and I like, I'll even deny that

06:45.560 --> 06:49.240
I'm thinking of it or I'll think of something else, because until you admit that and then you

06:49.240 --> 06:54.600
know, that language is familiar until you accept that you've got this problem, like you can't do

06:54.600 --> 06:59.080
the thing that you need to do, which is take contrary action, which is just the equivalent of

06:59.080 --> 07:03.800
like a fucking sit up, but you kind of have like two addictions, then don't you because like you

07:03.800 --> 07:10.920
got no addictions. If you're a dick, if you have a procrastination addiction, you also have an

07:10.920 --> 07:17.640
addiction to creating stuff, like that's a huge part of who you are. Well, I'd like to call that

07:17.640 --> 07:24.760
bluff as soon as possible. I mean, I like making stuff. I like making stuff I don't have to make,

07:24.760 --> 07:30.200
though. Like, I don't know. Yeah, wouldn't we all would all like to have created a thing that we

07:30.200 --> 07:35.160
didn't have to work hard on? Like I would like to have a book. I'm never going to sit down and

07:35.160 --> 07:40.840
write one because I'm a lazy, terrified, bad writer. Oh, man, Jeff, you got to get a ghost

07:40.840 --> 07:47.240
writer. I'd read your book. It'd be all your cool stories. What if I actually got a real ghost?

07:47.240 --> 07:53.960
Oh, that'd be great. I know a guy. The exorcist. I'll go straight. Your book is a ghost right

07:53.960 --> 08:03.400
now. Oh, chapter one. Oh, room full of dicks. I can't wait to suck them. That's problematic.

08:03.400 --> 08:15.560
Oh, ghost writer. I got you. It's me, Dan. I died. Just to do this bit. Don't go on the West Wing.

08:15.560 --> 08:25.400
It stinks. I ate myself to death. My body doesn't stink. It's the food. I don't know. What are you

08:25.400 --> 08:30.520
trying to add onto that for? You're selling past the close. How many current dead lions do you

08:30.520 --> 08:40.200
have? I got them down to like, I'm going to count them. I got one. It's this thing that I've been

08:40.200 --> 08:50.280
coveching about for the last couple of weeks. It was truly due today. All these projects,

08:50.280 --> 08:57.880
they'll always be like a guy who's like, it's just fucking, it's the saddest thing. This is a

08:57.880 --> 09:05.080
look back on my life. I go like, oh, these poor people that I get permission from. I go like,

09:05.080 --> 09:10.920
oh man, can I have one more day? And like, yeah, man, it's all good. I'm like, oh, you're such a

09:10.920 --> 09:15.480
good guy. I'm like, I was just trying to go back through my life and go like, how many of them get

09:15.480 --> 09:20.200
rewarded for this? Patience? Like, should they just come over to my house and punch me?

09:20.760 --> 09:25.160
Weren't you better when you had like a Stuart Krenfeld that would just yell at you and say,

09:25.160 --> 09:29.960
where is it? Where is it? I don't know if he got more or less for his, where is it? Where is it?

09:29.960 --> 09:35.160
I don't know. Jack Rappke was like, was like, you know, the thing that I remember, I mean,

09:35.160 --> 09:39.960
it was just, but I still didn't like, I still just shit out Monster House at the end of it and

09:39.960 --> 09:46.600
like gave it to him because, but it was like, but I remember him going like, like the, I don't know,

09:46.600 --> 09:51.880
like the third time he had to call me and Stuart or Jack Rappke at Image Movers. And I was writing

09:51.880 --> 09:56.200
Monster House. This is 20 years ago, but it still sticks out in my head that he was, because he

09:56.200 --> 10:01.800
was just like old school Hollywood and like, fuck was every other word is just like really,

10:01.800 --> 10:07.400
like interesting guy. Like, like, I mean that, like, it was just like, like, it was just like,

10:07.400 --> 10:13.880
everything was fucking this and fucking that and hey, listen, I got it. And then he got like,

10:13.880 --> 10:19.320
I just remember him going like, like, I told him like a third time, like, yeah, I'm not quite done

10:19.320 --> 10:23.320
yet. I'm still working at something. I just got it, whatever. And there's just this long silence

10:23.320 --> 10:31.880
and he goes like, all right, well, I'll tell you what fucking Dan. At this point, not going to

10:31.880 --> 10:37.240
bother calling you anymore because there's no fucking credibility here. Something like that's

10:37.240 --> 10:43.000
all I remember. I was like, damn, no credibility. Shit, I can go get a sandwich now.

10:44.600 --> 10:48.200
Wait, that didn't light a fire under your ass? No, it just made me feel real bad.

10:48.200 --> 10:53.400
But you still finished it? Not really. Did you see that fucking thing? What is it?

10:54.440 --> 10:57.800
Like, it's like, it's like the first 20 pages is great. And then it's like,

10:58.440 --> 11:01.560
it's probably not even great anymore. Because it's like, oh, wow, you want to have sex with

11:01.560 --> 11:10.520
that girl scout? That's that that aged well. Two kids ordering or arguing over who gets to

11:11.240 --> 11:15.400
Is deadless one of these things that you're working on? No. I mean, that's a that I wouldn't

11:15.400 --> 11:19.160
call that a deadline necessarily. That's like an active project that I'm very excited about.

11:19.160 --> 11:23.880
I'm not like, there's nobody that's like, you're fucking me over. So wait, okay, so I'm counting

11:23.880 --> 11:29.480
the one thing. And then I do think like, I just got a bunch of shit off like one, two, three things

11:29.480 --> 11:36.200
off my plate. And yeah, I think that's it. I think I think that's truly it. And you only have

11:36.840 --> 11:41.640
50,000 more episodes of Rick and Morty to write, which is great. No, Rick and Morty is like, I

11:41.640 --> 11:47.160
don't want to say it's easy, but it's like it's it's it's a healthy process now, you know, like

11:47.160 --> 11:57.480
it's it's like Rick and Morty's like, you know, we're it's it's it's fine. Like, that's the job

11:57.480 --> 12:02.200
that I want. That's the job that I signed the deal to do. And as soon as I got that contract,

12:02.200 --> 12:07.560
I was like, okay, let's start wrapping up all these other dalliances. And there was just like

12:07.560 --> 12:13.560
50 of them. Because because like, what are you supposed to do? You know, you know, you know,

12:14.760 --> 12:20.440
there's no I mean, look, I'm one of the luckiest writers in Los Angeles in the in the TV industry

12:20.440 --> 12:29.400
got to be one of the 1% luckiest in in in a in a field that if you're represented in paying

12:29.400 --> 12:35.320
your rent writing that those those people represent like to top whatever percent of the

12:35.320 --> 12:40.280
population of the planet in terms of luxury, in terms of like, you know, the amount of work you

12:40.280 --> 12:44.040
have to do for the amount of money you get, and then I'm up in the upper echelon of those people

12:44.040 --> 12:49.800
because I make like, I'll get a check from community sometimes and I'll get a check from from this or

12:49.800 --> 12:55.000
that. And it's still like until I got that Rick and Morty deal, I was like, well, yeah, but how

12:55.000 --> 12:59.640
am I going to retire? And then you get it's like, I guess that segues into this WGA thing, like,

12:59.640 --> 13:05.240
I guess I got it. I got it. Everybody firing their agent. Okay, good. All right. Yeah, yeah, I put

13:05.240 --> 13:10.600
on the road and and not totally hip to that. Like what what is the deal with the WGA deal? Packaging

13:10.600 --> 13:17.080
Jeff. It's all about packaging. You know about packaging. I'm packaging right now right. We're

13:17.080 --> 13:23.880
all packaging. I really can't speak with authority. I can't even go ahead. Go ahead. No, I don't know

13:23.880 --> 13:30.280
packaging is when the agents basically cut themselves further into the pie for making deals

13:30.280 --> 13:36.680
with multiple talents and parties. So they they tell they say, Hey, literary agent, like, we'll

13:36.680 --> 13:43.960
get this writer and Hey, TV agent and Hey TV actor will get you and also we'll get 10% more of

13:43.960 --> 13:49.880
everyone's money, you know, of everyone's deals for packaging. So they get 10% on top of the money

13:49.880 --> 13:55.480
they already get from the individual parties. And I'm probably way off. But that's a big part of it

13:55.480 --> 14:00.360
because it's just them, you know, cutting, cutting a huge chunk more of the money than

14:00.360 --> 14:05.640
they're already being paid to get. And so yeah, the WGA is this guy chunks of money

14:06.680 --> 14:14.280
or carving anti carving. Who does that affect the worst? The WGA, the writers,

14:14.280 --> 14:20.520
because they no longer have the same connections and you know, there's probably obviously this is

14:20.520 --> 14:27.800
a union of very smart people that like to type a lot. So there's a lot of invective, a lot of

14:27.800 --> 14:35.160
like Patrick Henry, give me my quill or give me my sword kind of stuff online that'll make you I

14:35.160 --> 14:43.880
mean, I, I really, I don't know how you once it's 9795% you know, turning out in a vote, which it's

14:43.880 --> 14:51.560
like, I'm just going to defer to my better crafts people who've thought about this more. And I did

14:51.560 --> 14:56.760
talk to a couple of colleagues and said like, look, can you explain this to me? And like, because

14:56.760 --> 15:02.680
if all this is is that we that that times are hard all over that Rome is burning. And so everyone's

15:02.680 --> 15:06.840
just starting to grab each other and shake each other down, you know, and the package is just a

15:06.840 --> 15:10.920
cluster of money that we're like, okay, now let's worry about that now that it's not the

15:11.480 --> 15:16.520
cocaine 80s anymore. And like, there's not money just like everywhere. But and then someone was

15:16.520 --> 15:20.280
like, no, no, no, it's not it's it's it's lack of transparency and stuff like that. And they kind

15:20.280 --> 15:28.920
of walked me through it. And I took my you know, my agents took me out to dinner. And there's such

15:28.920 --> 15:36.200
a sweet, sweet table of little cherubs. They're human beings. They didn't they didn't choose

15:37.400 --> 15:42.680
this stuff. They don't run their their agency or the industry for the last 30 years. And they're

15:42.680 --> 15:49.000
they're a little broken hearted that writers are such. We're so dramatic when we really set our

15:49.000 --> 15:54.200
mind to something like they just they're feeling like very bad. I think you're saying writers

15:54.200 --> 15:59.560
are dramatic. Yeah, I think it's very I always thought it was very profound. I mean, I that that

15:59.560 --> 16:04.680
like, we have this industry out here where, you know, things that in any other part of the world

16:04.680 --> 16:10.280
might be just too frivolous for there to be such compartmentalized and industrialized like a division

16:10.280 --> 16:18.280
of labor. And because even, you know, that we developed these breeds, and that it's always,

16:18.280 --> 16:26.520
you know, I'm so thankful that there's this like breed of industry person that does just every part

16:26.520 --> 16:33.000
of the job of working as a writer that I would rather kill myself than do, which I mean, notably

16:33.000 --> 16:39.720
just like selling me like telling people that I'm good and that I should have a job. I would if I

16:39.720 --> 16:44.600
would never I would die of starvation before I did that would never be like, well, I'm pretty good

16:44.600 --> 16:49.560
writer. Think, think you should maybe what are you doing over here like a Star Trek reboot like

16:49.560 --> 16:54.040
look, I've been I've been I've been I've been loving Star Trek maybe you've seen some of my work

16:54.040 --> 16:57.800
here's something you can read like I don't know if they come pretty good like I would just like

16:57.800 --> 17:03.560
now I'm gonna I didn't know that John Travolta was a writer. John Travolta, what are you working

17:03.560 --> 17:14.280
on right now? You got a you got a new script for us? I'm working on tell all about the the set

17:14.280 --> 17:21.000
of Broken Arrow. I got to say Broken Arrow is not my favorite John Travolta movie. Well,

17:21.560 --> 17:28.120
why don't you take a flying hose on a rubber hose? I've sound like Bobcat going through it.

17:31.880 --> 17:37.080
What did they say? And welcome back Connor. Take a take a sit on a rubber hose or take a put your

17:37.080 --> 17:41.240
nose up your nose with a rubber hose. Thank you. Thank you. I always say up your butt with a coconut,

17:41.240 --> 17:44.840
but that wasn't from welcome back Connor. No, I don't think you could say that back down.

17:44.840 --> 17:48.520
Yeah, you couldn't say up your butt. They wouldn't say up your nose if they could say up your butt.

17:48.520 --> 17:53.720
Right. They're like, we got to put it somewhere. They're like, you get it. The nose is like the

17:53.720 --> 17:59.800
ass. How is that happy days when they would say sit on it? Sit on it seems almost worse than

17:59.800 --> 18:03.560
up your nose. Yeah, that's sit on it. What am I supposed to sit on? Probably your dick, right?

18:04.440 --> 18:09.480
I'm assuming either. Well, they were in the they were usually in the men's room when they told

18:09.480 --> 18:14.920
somebody to sit on it. And honestly, like regardless of what you're sitting on, it's probably going

18:14.920 --> 18:21.080
up your ass. I mean, there's really no getting around that. I can't believe that. Who made happy

18:21.080 --> 18:25.800
days? Who's the creator on that one? Gary Marshall. Is it Gary Marshall? I had his office at Paramount.

18:27.000 --> 18:32.520
Oh, yeah? Yeah, my office was. That wasn't your eccentric days when you would show up at Paramount

18:32.520 --> 18:37.480
in a fucking bathrobe like one of the Wachowsky brothers or whatever, right? Yeah, I guess sometimes

18:37.480 --> 18:42.440
I do that. Then I got fired. But like, I mean, sometimes you got to edit on a Saturday. I'm not

18:42.440 --> 18:49.480
going to put pants on. I shot that Daryl video in that office was Gary Marshall's office. Did you

18:49.480 --> 18:53.800
really show up to Paramount just in pajamas and slippers and stuff? Yeah, I would go there. Like,

18:53.800 --> 18:58.440
yeah, like usually like when it was like in the thick of things when it was like, oh, you got to

18:58.440 --> 19:03.000
work on the weekends, which I would do. But it was like, oh, I got to go in on the weekend. And I'm

19:03.000 --> 19:08.040
just going to sit and pull into Paramount's lap, go into an edit bay and sit there for six hours and

19:08.600 --> 19:13.960
ship an episode. Yeah, that's where I'll wear my pajamas. I saw you and me Wednesday in the last

19:13.960 --> 19:19.320
episode of this. You came out in your little Jimmy Jams. Yeah, that was really good. Oh, all right.

19:19.320 --> 19:23.960
Well, so we got we do have some some items to go over. Like, I feel like this one's kind of urgent

19:23.960 --> 19:33.960
because for fans of my workout, which they are legion a couple days ago, a couple workouts ago,

19:33.960 --> 19:39.640
we were talking about my coyote problem. And I I had ordered this ghillie suit, like, which is where

19:39.640 --> 19:45.320
you look like a swamp thing. And it came and I like I wore it during my workout and stuff. But

19:45.320 --> 19:49.960
I was like, you know, I was talking before. Hang on, can I pause here for a second? Why did you

19:49.960 --> 19:55.960
get a ghillie suit for your coyote problem? My feeling at the time I was a little drunk, but I

19:55.960 --> 20:02.280
was like, I thought I was like maybe like wear it. And like, it was based on a threat I had made to

20:02.280 --> 20:08.280
the coyotes. While really drunk, like I did like a Kevin Spacey monologue to the coyotes for like

20:08.280 --> 20:13.880
20 minutes. So you verbally to coyotes in your backyard or just to the universe itself?

20:13.880 --> 20:19.800
Like, I did it under my breath, but in a way that if my neighbors wanted to listen, like,

20:19.800 --> 20:23.960
they would be alarmed. So it was kind of a because I was clearly talking. It was a taxi

20:23.960 --> 20:28.760
driver. You talk to me kind of thing. But I was like coyotes. Yeah, I was like projecting like

20:28.760 --> 20:33.640
this. Like, I was like, because I just I was just finished shooting some slingshot like clay

20:33.640 --> 20:38.840
biodegradable clay balls into the wait, these things are getting so aggressive. You've already

20:38.840 --> 20:45.400
invested in anti coyote weaponry. Yeah. Yeah, I got like this crazy slingshot.

20:45.400 --> 20:51.000
Right. But it was like rocket kind of thing. But I still, you know, I was like saying, I shot it

20:51.000 --> 20:56.680
and like, like, you know, into the into the area. Are you shooting at actual animals that you saw?

20:56.680 --> 21:02.840
Or no, I mean, if I couldn't see them, but I wouldn't aim at them. I wouldn't be my objective

21:02.840 --> 21:07.880
to hit them. Because I don't think that would do any good. I would rather just be a nuisance to

21:07.880 --> 21:11.960
them and scare them. And the concern would be that they're going to come and eat Nigel or what?

21:11.960 --> 21:18.600
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, eventually that they're because I feel like they're a they wouldn't be two feet

21:18.600 --> 21:25.320
from my back door. If they weren't already in some trouble, you know, so it's a it's a tragedy for

21:25.320 --> 21:31.400
them. But they probably smell the pheromones or the dog food or whatever that they just know that

21:31.400 --> 21:36.280
there's pets in the house. I know, but it's not like a natural, like, it's not like a natural

21:36.280 --> 21:41.640
thing for this is a recent thing. Again, going back to the fires that we had, and I think like

21:41.640 --> 21:45.160
there was a big migration down, there's been like a lot of aggressive coyote stuff. And I'm just

21:45.160 --> 21:50.200
saying, like, I have to imagine that all of these coyotes that are like so active in Los Filos

21:50.200 --> 21:56.280
right now, that they're they're up against it. And that and they're getting very aggressive. And

21:56.280 --> 22:03.160
what I worry about is a combination of their aggression. And like, if they're starving, like

22:03.160 --> 22:09.480
them getting kind of loopy, or like, like a hat, like a, you know, like abandoned pups or whatever,

22:09.480 --> 22:14.600
like, I don't want to know the shit's going to hit the fan if like some you've seen these like

22:14.600 --> 22:21.560
crazy coyotes, like, broad daylight, like one that was just that's just like, yeah, Paul Ruston,

22:21.560 --> 22:26.440
Leslie Orphans, little dog got eaten, like, and I heard it happen. It was fucking nuts.

22:26.440 --> 22:33.640
Jesus. Yeah, well, put a pin in that. That's awful. You heard it. Put a pin in that. And

22:33.640 --> 22:38.920
their other dog, which is a golden doodle like yours, like Harvey watched it happen. And they're

22:38.920 --> 22:44.920
like, he was never the same again. Like he was fucking absolutely went insane by watching his

22:44.920 --> 22:50.600
little friend get murdered by a pack of coyotes. Because I mean, Harvey can't even handle watching

22:50.600 --> 22:57.320
a fucking cartoon about a deer without losing his shit. Harvey just will walk in and he'll

22:57.320 --> 23:00.920
lay on his back and then pee on my shoe. Nah, come on. He doesn't pee that much.

23:02.600 --> 23:10.680
The so yeah, I'm just worried happened once. That's enough. I am worried about a like juvenile

23:10.680 --> 23:21.080
hunger starved heat stroked, like, like fucking incel coyote, just like on a on a comp on a speed

23:21.080 --> 23:27.560
ball high of nothing to lose. And he's riding a lime scooter. He's fucking coming down

23:28.360 --> 23:32.360
Griffith Park Boulevard. And he's pissed about the sesh wine sauce. He's like,

23:33.800 --> 23:39.160
and just like, like either like just just try just like going for broke. I mean, life finds away

23:39.160 --> 23:43.560
and like and like they're what I'm worried about is the failure of that plan even more than the

23:43.560 --> 23:51.480
success of it that that like a injured kind of sick coyote landing in my yard and then needing

23:51.480 --> 23:56.200
help from other coyotes or just freaking out because it's like I'm trapped. It would be trapped

23:56.200 --> 24:02.360
in there. And if I was out, if I was out and it was like 3pm and the doggy door was unlocked and

24:02.360 --> 24:09.640
there's a coyote trapped in my backyard, Nigel's a fucking idiot. Like he thinks that skunks are

24:09.640 --> 24:15.800
are party favors. Like he's just like, yay, free skunk candy. You know, like, has he been

24:15.800 --> 24:24.040
skunked a lot? Yeah, he got skunked like twice in the first like two weeks of my relationship

24:24.040 --> 24:29.720
with Cody. Dogs don't learn about skunks. You'd think that once bitten twice shy, but they

24:29.720 --> 24:34.600
fucking don't. They just say, oh, skunk again. Harvey understands. Harvey's got the got the

24:34.600 --> 24:41.000
the the whatever genes in him where he's like he hangs back 20 yards and barks and goes like skunk,

24:41.000 --> 24:46.520
skunk, skunk, skunk, skunk, skunk and Nigel's just like like a torpedo. And just and then he just

24:46.520 --> 24:51.800
like but like if Nigel gets out of bed starts barking and running downstairs panic and run

24:51.800 --> 24:56.280
because last time that happened, I made it as far as the kitchen and he's coming back in the

24:56.280 --> 25:04.280
doggie door going with like fucking mucus shooting out of his face and the whole house immediately

25:04.280 --> 25:13.080
smelling like like not it does not smell as much like weed. No, it smells like like poison. Like

25:13.080 --> 25:19.160
I just got apparently explode on my doorstep one time. And my place like you couldn't even breathe

25:19.160 --> 25:24.440
in my place. It's in your shit forever. You have to throw away like like like even just curtains

25:24.440 --> 25:29.720
and stuff. It just gets in it. And there was at my new place. There was a family of skunks.

25:30.360 --> 25:36.520
There was a mama and a papa and some babies and they're adorable. They're so cute. And we just

25:36.520 --> 25:41.400
stood there. I came home at like midnight or one a.m. And there was just a Mexican standoff.

25:41.400 --> 25:47.080
They just stood in front of my door for a half hour. And I wasn't going anywhere. They weren't

25:47.080 --> 25:54.040
going anywhere. Yeah. What do you do? You can't shoot them off. I clap my hands. Yeah.

25:56.280 --> 25:59.720
It usually makes them go away. Like I've had a couple of showdowns with a skunk where they're

25:59.720 --> 26:11.000
like, I don't want to do this anymore than you do. I thought you're going to do a skunk clapping

26:11.000 --> 26:16.760
handswrap. Oh, because clapping. I was like, what? I was trying to figure out what was awesome.

26:19.800 --> 26:24.360
There was a skunk clapping handswrap. Did you guys see that Scotty Bowers documentary,

26:24.360 --> 26:31.240
the secret Hollywood guy? Yeah, he feeds his skunks. These guys like he lives somewhere here

26:31.240 --> 26:35.400
and he like he puts out extra cat food for the skunks and they just come running right away.

26:35.400 --> 26:38.840
Like they're like they're just like waiting for him to put the food out and then they I mean

26:38.840 --> 26:42.360
that's what it looks like in that documentary. I'm like, I wonder if that's do those skunks

26:43.560 --> 26:48.200
not spray? They don't if they feel comfortable that they don't they don't like get up on your

26:48.200 --> 26:52.760
shit. But if a dog comes go like comes over and snarls at them, they're going to put their

26:52.760 --> 26:57.320
butthole right on your face. And that's that's the end of that. So this is why I bring this up

26:57.320 --> 27:01.400
is because a couple of workouts ago, I'm talking about the coyote problem. And I'm like, okay,

27:01.400 --> 27:05.960
yeah, it's Spencer and Steve are ordering me like an airsoft gun or whatever. Like we're

27:05.960 --> 27:10.760
we're getting equipment, you know, I just want to be as well scare these coyotes into having a

27:10.760 --> 27:19.160
larger birth around my yard. And and then I got I got look, and I said in case anybody out there

27:19.160 --> 27:24.600
has got their ears on to the live stream, and you're like, Oh, you just you want to be mean to

27:24.600 --> 27:29.240
animals. What's what are they doing wrong? I was like, really, no, I've tried everything. I've tried,

27:29.240 --> 27:34.520
you know, noise and don't tell me shake a coffee can at them with rocks and it like I've tried

27:34.520 --> 27:38.680
everything. They're getting really aggressive. They don't care anymore. And Dave Kline said,

27:38.680 --> 27:45.880
Have you tried praying? And I was like, you got me, though I have not tried praying. That's true.

27:45.880 --> 27:51.320
Like before I go up in my ghillie suit. And so then I did this thing where I'm like, because I'm

27:51.320 --> 27:57.880
like, I look, I, you know, functionally, I may as well be an atheist in terms of like, I don't,

27:57.880 --> 28:06.360
I don't do nothing for no no deities. I don't I don't pay nothing forward. But but culturally,

28:06.360 --> 28:13.320
I don't know, psychologically, like, I'm, I'm like, I don't I, I, I, I'm, I'm panicking even

28:13.320 --> 28:20.600
talking about it right now. Like I have this inborn, like Midwestern. If you blaspheme, like,

28:20.600 --> 28:25.800
you're God's just gonna like, it is just just seize the opportunity to prove he exists just

28:25.800 --> 28:32.440
by fucking like taking one of your legs out. And, and so I was like, okay, if I'm doing this,

28:32.440 --> 28:38.040
I gotta be real serious about it. So I very sincerely, you know, I would have made it very

28:38.040 --> 28:41.480
complicated because I was like, no, I sound like a dick, like I'm like, you know, stuff. But I did

28:41.480 --> 28:46.680
went through this like prayer, where I prayed for the coyotes to as a God take, you know,

28:46.680 --> 28:54.600
if you want, if you want to fill these coyotes hearts with the desire to relocate, whatever

28:54.600 --> 28:58.760
it is, like, like, don't don't smite them. If it's if it's a choice between doing nothing and

28:58.760 --> 29:05.800
smiting, I'll deal with them. Like I don't want anything smitten for me. It's smote. So I don't

29:05.800 --> 29:14.920
want, I don't want nothing smoke. Yo, don't be smote. But I'm smote. It might, it might

29:18.680 --> 29:23.560
why the ghillie suits? Why did you get a ghillie suit? It was part of the threat he made.

29:23.560 --> 29:27.880
Yeah. Oh, right. Because I was talking to him Kevin Spacey style into the darkness. I was drunk

29:27.880 --> 29:33.240
and I was like in my underwear. And I was like, I was just like, I felt a little emasculated,

29:33.240 --> 29:38.760
which I can say here because they can't hear me. But like, I, I feel like it's all about like

29:38.760 --> 29:44.920
vibes and stuff, like communicate, like, like if I, I, I believe not with all animals, like,

29:44.920 --> 29:51.000
I don't think you can talk to a hamster just to do it. But I believe that it when it when it comes

29:51.000 --> 29:57.720
to when it's a real situation of, of animus, I guess you'd call it, right? Like when it's,

29:57.720 --> 30:04.760
when it's significant, when it's, when it's man versus beast on some level where it's like, okay,

30:04.760 --> 30:09.960
well, we're neighbors now, you know, like in the old days, what it predates our memetic evolution

30:09.960 --> 30:15.320
and cuts right to the heart. Like we still have lizard brains. We still, we're still made of

30:15.320 --> 30:20.840
the same carbon from the same stars as these little pieces of shit. Like why did you buy a

30:20.840 --> 30:27.960
ghillie suit? Because I, because I told them I would, because I, and if I, and if I do, if I

30:27.960 --> 30:32.680
say I'm going to do something, I said I'm coming up there. I said I'm ordering shit from Amazon

30:32.680 --> 30:39.320
and you got two weeks. Why, why dress like a bush? I just sneak up on a coyote who lives in

30:39.320 --> 30:43.960
bushes. You scared the shit out of them. No, they're more scared of human beings dressed like

30:43.960 --> 30:48.200
not bushes. They're not, they're not scared enough of human beings. They need to think that I'm psycho.

30:48.200 --> 30:54.040
So any question you have is a question that they'll have. A psycho bush and they're going to go,

30:54.040 --> 30:57.240
oh, I'm going to pee on that bush. I'm going to fucking be friend. Oh, I hope so. Yeah. I hope

30:57.240 --> 31:03.080
they pee on me. And then I'm going to go, yeah. And they're going to be like, what the fuck bite

31:03.080 --> 31:12.120
you. I go, bite me. I'm a bush man. Like I just want him to be like, uh, not worth it. I was on

31:12.120 --> 31:17.560
the road. I was on the road telling a series of fantastic dick jokes across the country. But I

31:17.560 --> 31:22.680
think I saw a picture of you dressed up in a ghillie suit. Yeah. And I couldn't, for the life of

31:22.680 --> 31:28.120
me, try to reconstruct what the fucking purpose of that was. I worked out in it and it felt really

31:28.120 --> 31:32.680
great. Tony, did you put it on? Do you, do you roll around? I swear I could bench 20 more pounds

31:32.680 --> 31:37.400
wearing it because I felt like this like, do you, do you cruise around in your backyard at night

31:37.400 --> 31:41.480
and haunting coyotes in your ghillie suit? No, I haven't used it on them yet because as I told them,

31:41.480 --> 31:51.960
I said, I said, I said, I said to them, I said, I said, you guys can stay as quiet or as loud as

31:51.960 --> 31:58.680
you want right now. You do whatever you want. Like this isn't, I've told you before to be quiet

32:00.440 --> 32:04.520
and you weren't right. So we're past that point. There's no credibility now.

32:07.160 --> 32:10.760
Yeah. Politeness has gone out the window with you and these coyotes. I don't care.

32:10.760 --> 32:14.520
I feel, we're not playing games anymore. I'm not negotiating for fucking decibel.

32:14.520 --> 32:18.360
You don't negotiate with coyotes. Oh, be quiet if I throw a rock. Oh, now you made

32:18.360 --> 32:22.600
more noise. Now you made less. I'm telling you right now, too late. You may as well scream and

32:22.600 --> 32:26.760
shout or you may as well be quiet. Still won't save you because here's what's going to happen.

32:27.400 --> 32:34.280
I'm ordering a ladder from Amazon and when it comes, I'm climbing up over this wall and I'm

32:34.280 --> 32:39.800
coming up there. What? Yeah. And to what end? What's the end game when you get up over the

32:39.800 --> 32:45.800
wall? I feel like, I feel like, I feel like the effectiveness of that statement is in the negative

32:45.800 --> 32:56.440
space. Like, I want them to be going, why? What are you going to do? But I said, you don't understand

32:56.440 --> 33:02.120
human society and I don't understand coyotes society, but I will tell you right now, you are

33:02.120 --> 33:09.720
dealing with a man with unexpressed rage on a on a dead line. It seems like they and a budget you

33:10.760 --> 33:14.600
they condition me. No, it seems like they keep pushing you. Well, they keep pushing me. Yeah,

33:14.600 --> 33:20.840
yeah, I think it seems like they drew first blood. I think they are right. Dan, this is them

33:20.840 --> 33:25.000
conditioning you. They've taught you to be a bush. Yeah, you just you just got that idea from me,

33:25.000 --> 33:32.600
Miss hearing Spencer. I got to say that I I thought I knew how to fight coyotes. Yeah, he was at

33:32.600 --> 33:37.240
Wolves or coyotes, but I never imagined putting on a bush suit. This is next level. I was thinking

33:37.240 --> 33:42.440
about getting coyote urine and put and putting coyote urine on the suit to like just just just

33:42.440 --> 33:50.040
then you hit them with your like contrary action. You know, I missed I missed the wolf urine show.

33:50.040 --> 33:55.480
Tell me in a sentence or two what the point of the year and colon they hate that wolves are like

33:55.480 --> 34:01.080
well coyotes are afraid of wolves unless they're having sex with them. But that's that's genus

34:01.080 --> 34:08.200
canis for you. They're they're either they're either breeding or eating each other. But the

34:08.200 --> 34:13.400
the so so here's the thing that I just don't see the point of dressing up like a bush to fight a

34:13.400 --> 34:17.960
coyote because like you don't you want to be more course you don't more of a threat to them

34:17.960 --> 34:25.080
and look no I want I know I want to traumatize them mentally. Do you think coyotes have that

34:25.080 --> 34:30.600
sort of mental capacity to remember things because I think if it's a shock to their system and I'm

34:30.600 --> 34:37.000
not allowed to do that to them physically I can't and I wouldn't want to but like I said they're

34:37.000 --> 34:44.600
struggling like it's like you know but they come down my street like like Waverly they come down

34:44.600 --> 34:50.280
and they come down Griffith Park and Waverly and they silently like wraiths they just come down

34:50.920 --> 34:54.600
and they walk down the street and they're looking around and they kind of hoot to each other

34:55.400 --> 34:59.960
and they're all looking around and they all go into somebody's backyard and eat somebody's little

34:59.960 --> 35:05.640
dog or cat. I'll tell you what man and it's fucking gnarly and you see people you wake up and you

35:05.640 --> 35:11.240
hear the screaming of the animal dying and then you hear the screaming of the owner of the animal

35:11.240 --> 35:18.120
coming out and they're underwear throwing like hairbrushes and shoes at them and scaring them off

35:18.120 --> 35:23.320
as they as they're devouring their little precious animal. It's not happening. If I can talk to Paul

35:23.320 --> 35:29.080
Reston Leslie Arfun about their dog dying it's fucking really gruesome. So here's the thing though

35:29.080 --> 35:35.560
we're living in an extraordinary times you know like this is not normal shit like the night that

35:35.560 --> 35:42.200
I did my monologue like it was like your monologue to the coyotes in your underwear. Yeah it was

35:42.200 --> 35:48.440
like the purge anarchy like like there was like there was a coyote and like right up on my shit

35:48.440 --> 35:54.440
going like aye aye aye aye aye and and but then like it was doing it because in the distance when

35:54.440 --> 36:01.640
it would shut up and you would hear in the far distance like miles away just this army it was

36:01.640 --> 36:09.240
just like and I was like these fuckers think that they're gonna keep like pushing like they think

36:09.240 --> 36:14.600
that the were in the end days they could probably smell that we are they're like they think they

36:14.600 --> 36:20.040
probably like they hear us talking about Trump in our bedrooms and they're like sounds like it's

36:20.040 --> 36:27.000
coyote time sounds like we've entered the era of coyotes like I might I might invent a lever

36:27.000 --> 36:33.400
next week I might start I might be the Archimedes of coyotes I won't know unless I get lots of

36:33.400 --> 36:41.000
protein in me anyways so so so I so I said to the coyotes that night because it was like hearing

36:41.000 --> 36:46.600
this shit in the distance and I'm like I was like I just I knew I had to like put on a strong face

36:47.160 --> 36:52.120
and be like I just I just I just you know just like kind of counterintuitive I was just like

36:52.120 --> 36:57.880
I'm glad you're quiet now I hope you're quiet forever because but it doesn't matter because

36:59.000 --> 37:04.040
like I'm getting a ladder from Amazon and I'm coming up here. Is Harmontown gonna be about

37:04.040 --> 37:08.040
canine predators for the rest of time now because we got wolf urine and we got coyotes?

37:09.000 --> 37:13.640
Well I don't know we could get through it if you I mean like look I had this I had one thing to

37:13.640 --> 37:18.840
say about this which was that during my workout then I said I was explaining all this to Dave

37:18.840 --> 37:23.800
Klein Dave Kline says have you tried praying I prayed so look what I said in my prayer also is

37:23.800 --> 37:32.280
like look God you know obviously if the coyotes don't come back not that that not that there needs

37:32.280 --> 37:39.480
to be anything in this for you but if the coyotes just disappear now you know I'm gonna tell the

37:39.480 --> 37:45.080
story I'm not gonna leave you out I'm not gonna like whitewash like I'm not gonna be like oh

37:45.080 --> 37:50.840
you know like I'm and I know and I don't I don't mean I know you like that PR you like that you

37:50.840 --> 37:56.840
like that acknowledgement you know I don't know you don't thrive on it but I will I would I promise

37:56.840 --> 38:02.120
I will tell people I prayed for the coyotes to go away and then they went away that'll be my story

38:02.120 --> 38:08.200
and I sit here tonight to tell you like I haven't heard the fucking coyotes since I prayed for them

38:08.200 --> 38:18.440
to go away oh shit I now now now some some of you the atheist people fans it's okay that's all right

38:18.440 --> 38:23.320
I love atheists we need them we need skeptics we need we need them more than than than than ever

38:25.720 --> 38:31.960
you guys can just assume that it was the Kevin Spacey monologue because I told them I said I

38:31.960 --> 38:38.120
said get your shit I said I said look it doesn't matter coming up from what from from house of car

38:38.120 --> 38:44.600
from our commercials from his uh from his christmas christmas apron video on youtube

38:48.040 --> 38:52.840
was that brendan I was pretty fucked up I got in the plane today from Boston back to LA and the

38:52.840 --> 38:58.040
the first thing I saw was that Notre Dame was on fire in Paris that really bummed me out oh no oh

38:58.040 --> 39:06.760
yeah what happened what are nazis no I think so but no it's saying that yet just back I don't

39:06.760 --> 39:11.720
think that the the the verdict is in on what happened right they might they were doing reconstruction

39:11.720 --> 39:16.600
on it and it might have been just like a construction accident the actual church yeah there's a whole

39:16.600 --> 39:23.800
roof fell in the main spiral that was built like in 1840 or something that all fell in most of the

39:23.800 --> 39:29.240
superstructure in stone and the bell towers stayed up but there was a very big chance that all the

39:29.240 --> 39:34.520
bells were going to fucking fall down and kill everybody the firefighters in there but uh friends

39:34.520 --> 39:38.680
of ours uh like church has friends and I have friends that would like live right across the

39:38.680 --> 39:45.000
descend from it and watch the whole thing catch on fire and there was people singing Ave Maria and

39:45.000 --> 39:50.360
French and it was or maybe Latin I don't know absolutely beautiful and I don't think you have

39:50.360 --> 39:59.480
to be religious to be really struck by the fact that uh and nearly what 900 year old building is

39:59.480 --> 40:05.960
just fucking in a towering inferno and the whole roof fell in it's really it was really gruesome

40:05.960 --> 40:12.920
and it was uh it put me in a pretty bad mood and I hope that uh they can rebuild it and make it good

40:12.920 --> 40:20.280
some very rich Frenchman uh businessman said he's going to give like a like a 100 million euro

40:20.280 --> 40:27.960
just to start the uh the rebuild on it which is better yeah no shit and then and then a friend of

40:27.960 --> 40:33.240
mine uh Brian who's a very good friend he made like the joke because I posted a picture of me

40:33.240 --> 40:39.000
that I took in front of the Notre Dame like maybe like three four years ago and he's like oh yeah

40:39.000 --> 40:43.800
yeah let's let's let's make sure that I don't have a picture of myself in front of Notre Dame so I

40:43.800 --> 40:47.800
guess I can't make it about me and I was like I don't think it's making about you I don't think

40:47.800 --> 40:52.760
it's vanity I think that's just grief and we had a very very good conversation about that I think

40:52.760 --> 40:59.000
social media does want you to make things about yourself or like we just are a pair of kids pecking

40:59.000 --> 41:03.960
at our own reflection and stuff but I think to have visited Notre Dame and to be sad that the

41:03.960 --> 41:11.480
thing is fucking on fire um isn't vanity I think that's uh I think that's an expression of grief

41:11.480 --> 41:20.600
about watching one of uh the world's great pieces of architecture die in front of us and uh I don't

41:20.600 --> 41:27.880
know they may be very depressed in Notre Dame in in in the in the states and uh was it Indiana

41:27.880 --> 41:34.040
where is it university or something where's where's Notre Dame and oh it's just a college I think it's not a city is Indiana

41:34.040 --> 41:40.120
where is it south bend indiana yeah but there's no city it's just the name of the the it's Notre

41:40.120 --> 41:45.080
Dame de Paris it's uh it's the it's the Our Lady of Paris and that's the big church on the uh was it

41:45.080 --> 41:50.840
the oldest city whatever like right right on the island of uh in the middle of the Seine River

41:51.560 --> 41:57.240
and it's right in the heart of France and it's probably the most iconic church uh ever I would

41:57.240 --> 42:01.720
have been less upset if the Sistine Chapel burned down than the fucking uh Notre Dame that's it's

42:01.720 --> 42:11.080
whoa shots fired hot takes shots fired yeah there's a friends of mine like that live right by it

42:11.080 --> 42:15.400
there's just pictures of just smoke and then there's people that were up in Montmartre and uh like the

42:15.400 --> 42:20.920
soccer court like you're looking down on Paris and you just see in the middle of Paris the most famous

42:20.920 --> 42:30.200
thing in the world just raging in fire um it uh it really really affected me it made me really

42:30.200 --> 42:35.080
really sad so supposedly the bells are still standing and they they've saved the towers and

42:35.080 --> 42:42.440
whatnot but they're gonna have to rebuild it they gotta they've done it they'll do it

42:42.440 --> 42:50.760
I haven't seen uh Game of Thrones yet oh boy that's a good segue

42:55.720 --> 42:59.240
yeah also didn't Jackie Robinson turn 100 today if he was still alive

43:03.000 --> 43:06.680
there's a whole lot of shit going on today man it's a it's a it's emotionally charged

43:06.680 --> 43:11.480
I haven't seen it either I also I got a new receiver from Direct TV and I don't think I have

43:11.480 --> 43:17.000
my shit set to record Game of Thrones so I might have to go back there and fucking have to sneak

43:17.000 --> 43:23.160
I wanted to watch that Scotty Bowers documentary so I went to Apple TV and then and then I went to

43:23.160 --> 43:29.880
and then that took me to Amazon and then Amazon told me I had to get stars through Amazon and then

43:29.880 --> 43:38.760
stars said uh hey do you want to uh after your free trial do you want to get charged monthly

43:38.760 --> 43:48.040
or yearly if you get charged yearly you save 50% for only $79 a year for stars and I was like

43:50.360 --> 43:57.000
so I paid like 80 bucks for a movie about a guy that was gay with Spencer Tracy like I'll never

43:57.000 --> 44:01.960
what am I gonna browse stars what's wrong with me I don't know I guess I'd be like what's wrong

44:01.960 --> 44:10.680
with me even more though if I did the monthly thing because I'm saving 70 bucks right I don't know

44:10.680 --> 44:17.080
so Jackie Robinson was a uh african-american ballplayer who is sorry that's a real interesting

44:17.080 --> 44:24.760
documentary I would I would I would I would recommend for people very very very uh ambient I

44:24.760 --> 44:28.520
don't know it's not like it's got it's not like a big roller coaster ride like oh my god I can't

44:28.520 --> 44:32.120
believe this happened but it's just like an interesting portrait what's the one I was just

44:32.120 --> 44:38.440
I heard about today that's there's a documentary about a dude that free climbed uh all capitan

44:38.440 --> 44:45.160
in Yosemite or something what's it called free solo that's supposed to be fucking crazy right

44:45.160 --> 44:52.920
is it good yeah we got we got four Yaz hell yeah and all of his friends are dead right because

44:52.920 --> 44:58.840
everybody that tries to do that fucking dies don't fucking do that I watch that uh you guys

44:58.840 --> 45:07.720
watch I harness it when I go down staircases you know I have serious uh acrophobia which I think

45:07.720 --> 45:13.080
that's what that's what it is it's fair heights right it'll be acrophobia like Cody and I are

45:13.080 --> 45:19.880
looking at houses and I there was a house I looked at we were never gonna get it but like it was like

45:19.880 --> 45:25.560
it just had this balcony it was like I couldn't go out on it I mean I could but I was like I

45:25.560 --> 45:29.800
can't live I couldn't live here I never occurred to me like I've been in hotels you know all the

45:29.800 --> 45:37.560
time you're in a hotel I'm like I can't like I don't know I I I I wonder where I am on the you

45:37.560 --> 45:43.400
know ordinary meter of like people that can't like last uh New Year's eve or the one before

45:43.400 --> 45:47.400
we sing the microveloz thing we were we were on a very precipitous balcony the whole time on that

45:47.400 --> 45:54.520
one yeah when I go up to a balcony balcony like that like my legs get numb I'm seized with what

45:54.520 --> 45:59.960
I've read is described I did I couldn't put words onto it before I read it in this like

45:59.960 --> 46:06.120
coffee table book about phobias but it's it talked about how people are people with this phobia

46:06.120 --> 46:12.840
are particularly disturbed by what they describe as a as a as a as a as a uncontrollable thought

46:12.840 --> 46:18.200
about jumping yeah because I think your brain is just running through the fear of heights I say

46:18.200 --> 46:23.240
is not so much a fear of falling as a fear of jumping yeah but it's also like like I notice

46:23.240 --> 46:28.760
like if I'm holding an object or if anyone around me is holding an object like I can't stand watching

46:28.760 --> 46:34.760
Cody with the like that New Year's where Cody's just like you know hi and she's got like the like

46:34.760 --> 46:40.200
whether it's a whether it's a phone or a glass I'm just like the thought of this thing like like

46:40.200 --> 46:46.520
dropping yeah like it freaks me out yeah I think it's like I think I think the I don't know I've

46:46.520 --> 46:51.800
read or something that the idea is it's like your brain is kind of doing flash cards or it's like

46:51.800 --> 46:57.480
what if I jump no bad that would be bad what if I grab this cop's gun no that would be bad what if

46:57.480 --> 47:02.200
I like did a sandwich or something that'd be fine you know but it's just like it's just the brain

47:02.200 --> 47:07.960
is kind of reinforcing the negative mental and emotional what if you're on a balcony with a

47:07.960 --> 47:13.240
cop what if you're on a balcony with a cop grab their gun and just jumped off that'd be great

47:13.240 --> 47:17.560
and then they're like he didn't why don't you be an absolute legend my man yeah

47:20.920 --> 47:25.960
they'd call you Hans Gruber but yeah I get it the most with phones I'm just always imagining

47:25.960 --> 47:30.680
like dropping the last phones off bridges or opening up the hotel of a window of a hotel just

47:30.680 --> 47:36.840
to drop my phone out and I'm like this is bad I gotta get out of here like I do a lot of shows

47:36.840 --> 47:41.160
in the Bay Area and so we're constantly going back and forth across the Golden Gate where

47:41.160 --> 47:46.920
people kill themselves all the time and I'm fascinated by I had a cousin who did that huh

47:46.920 --> 47:51.720
I had a cousin who did that who did what he killed himself on the bridge he jumped up the bridge

47:51.720 --> 47:58.840
yeah your cousin it's sad which side what he side or the other side my mom's sister's no I mean

47:58.840 --> 48:07.800
which side of the bridge you you fucking suicide nephew up river stop making this about you Spencer

48:08.760 --> 48:14.120
which side of the bridge I'm sorry because some people that's awesome that's amazing most people

48:14.120 --> 48:19.000
jump off my mom's most people jump off facing the city because they want to see San Francisco as

48:19.000 --> 48:23.320
they kill themselves but once in a while some punk rockers fucking go off the other side yeah I

48:23.320 --> 48:28.920
don't I don't know that that was written down I mean I'm sure it was right I don't know if it was

48:28.920 --> 48:35.240
brought up but I have nothing if they didn't want people to jump off the Golden Gate bridge

48:35.240 --> 48:39.480
bigger fences yeah they stop putting a little sign that says hey call this number if you're

48:39.480 --> 48:42.520
feeling about what you're thinking about killing yourself yeah there is stuff they can do and I

48:42.520 --> 48:48.600
can't remember why they don't do what they can do I think I don't I don't I don't know it might

48:48.600 --> 48:55.320
maybe it's maybe maybe it's constitutional fucking liberty maybe there maybe it's San Francisco

48:55.320 --> 48:59.720
right so there maybe there's like a hippie in charge of the city and they're like hey man

48:59.720 --> 49:03.080
six thousand people six thousand people kill themselves off the bridge every year and I

49:03.080 --> 49:15.400
still can't get a parking spot oh yeah um thank thank you it used to be an AIDS joke now I made

49:15.400 --> 49:24.680
it about the bridge uh so you guys caught up on that uh on that glass trilogy what the you got

49:24.680 --> 49:32.280
you got you watch the unbreakable and then you watch the uh split and uh you got you got all

49:32.280 --> 49:38.120
caught up you see that glass movie Dan is it me or do you sound better your congestion seems to have

49:38.120 --> 49:42.600
gone away yeah I was that was that a full put on at the start of the show I can't I mean I don't

49:42.600 --> 49:47.720
want to be gross but I swallowed kind of a queen bee loogie sometimes that's all it takes

49:48.520 --> 49:54.440
the queen the queen went down the down the hatch stopped laying the drones you know you sound

49:54.440 --> 49:59.640
like you're back to full fighting shape right now it could be a little medicine it's like

50:00.360 --> 50:06.680
oldest medicine uh yeah I mean I watched that glass movie by myself

50:06.680 --> 50:16.360
uh and I and I I'm 46 years old and I knew what I was doing and I watched the whole thing

50:17.080 --> 50:21.400
and at the end of it I was like so what are you gonna tell people you watch this and you're gonna

50:21.400 --> 50:27.320
be like what a piece of shit and I was like what you knew it was gonna be a what did you think

50:27.320 --> 50:33.320

50:33.320 --> 50:39.480
that why why would you why would you watch something and then like what am I watching it for there was

50:39.480 --> 50:44.120

they spend the whole movie in a hospital run by the woman that you get if Joan Cusack isn't available

51:14.680 --> 51:23.400
and uh and I'm like if this movie if this if they just have a fight in this movie's parking lot

51:23.400 --> 51:29.160
I'm gonna shit my pants and that sure enough they fucking the whole move it's like the breakfast

51:29.160 --> 51:34.360
club that movie like they're just like in a hospital for an hour and a half and then they

51:34.360 --> 51:42.040
fight in the parking lot it is so goofy it is the goofiest movie I've ever seen no not really

51:42.040 --> 51:48.280
I've seen goofier movies surely I don't know I can't name any offhand my brain is with cheese but

51:48.280 --> 51:54.600
it was just such a goofy movie there are these there's like there's like uh is it a comedy uh no

51:54.600 --> 51:59.800
I mean not not not not not not my purpose yeah it wasn't trying to be funny I mean there was

51:59.800 --> 52:03.800
probably a moment or two and I was like oh and then this will be funny I didn't notice that but but

52:04.760 --> 52:11.000
it was just like uh are these in theaters or where are these from yeah this is uh you can

52:11.000 --> 52:16.360
you can watch this now on their streaming services I don't I don't based on your description I have

52:16.360 --> 52:21.320
no desire to watch these at all no you wouldn't want to watch this movie right I was just checking

52:21.320 --> 52:29.400
with the kids I mean I know they're they love the Shimali on the Shimali oh that's a Shimali on

52:29.400 --> 52:37.480
Shimali on that's a Shimali on yeah did you know that M night Shimali on is uh actually um

52:37.480 --> 52:52.360
um he's uh the brother of a more beloved uh director named M night uh Gamalian and like his

52:52.360 --> 52:57.320
his mom it doesn't make sense because you don't have different last names you might

52:59.080 --> 53:04.600
what if he had a different dad it's dumb I don't know you know it's just like oh Gamalian and then

53:04.600 --> 53:10.360
Gamalian died in a uh uh but oh wait no wait what am I see that wouldn't make sense well then

53:10.360 --> 53:14.360
then she just calls him Shimali on because it's like it's like calling the uh creative arts Emmys

53:14.360 --> 53:20.440
the Shmemys you know it's like ah Shimali on you know like you're no you're no you're no Gamalian

53:21.400 --> 53:27.720
Gamalian Shimali on you know he's got to live with that is that how you say his name Shimali

53:27.720 --> 53:32.200
that's how I say it I'm sure it's not how like yeah you say bag also we don't know what he knows

53:32.200 --> 53:38.840
I don't have the energy for you your hair is looking very good right now you got this kind of

53:39.880 --> 53:48.840
kind of uh deadliest catch kind of uh captain of a vessel flattery will get you everywhere

53:50.360 --> 53:53.160
the the burying sea gives up its great haircuts

53:53.160 --> 54:00.520
uh what's your secret what's your secret how do you keep your hair so soft and manageable

54:04.440 --> 54:10.760
I mean so I don't know so Cody kind of curates the Asperger detective episodes but okay this

54:10.760 --> 54:16.840
motherfucker has been killing it this motherfucker I don't I don't know if I'm hearing about an

54:16.840 --> 54:21.960
order are you listening to the patreon episodes that could be maybe she subscribed to the patreon

54:21.960 --> 54:26.840
but dude he went off on this thing what's actually called it's not called asperger it's called

54:26.840 --> 54:34.600
cold case murder mysteries murder mysteries uh I want to say his name is Ryan Kraus it is okay

54:35.560 --> 54:40.760
I mean he's like first of all he did I I don't know if he did it recently or if it was just there

54:40.760 --> 54:50.120
and I didn't know it but he did he did my the the uh Kanika Powell uh mystery like which is that

54:50.120 --> 54:54.520
that young lady that I talked about who uh you know when we had the red-handed girls on

54:54.520 --> 54:59.960
and I was saying like I don't understand why uh why this thing you know it's just like so crazy

54:59.960 --> 55:04.680
that she was you know these more than one guy it was like trying to kill her and just kill

55:04.680 --> 55:11.320
but he he really like laid it to rest for me what did he say he he he pinned it on this like

55:11.320 --> 55:19.160
guy that was active at that time before going to jail and he was like a sloppy pseudo serial killer

55:19.160 --> 55:25.480
who did run with a gang who kind of like had people doing his bidding and he was a ups guy that was

55:25.480 --> 55:31.400
like he was he frequently used friends to do like these hold up jobs where they'd pretend

55:31.400 --> 55:34.760
they're to deliver a package and then go on the thing and like all this stuff and he was doing

55:34.760 --> 55:42.520
like rapes and murders weren't be weren't weren't to be on him and um he he he he ended up in prison

55:42.520 --> 55:47.080
sometime after this happened but he was just like it's that guy and he didn't get caught for that

55:47.080 --> 55:51.160
and then he went to prison for other shit and he's in prison now and I was like oh that makes me feel

55:51.160 --> 55:56.600
better yeah because because it just seemed like and also it was like the thing the key thing about

55:56.600 --> 56:02.040
it was that the thing that was scary to me was that the end of the story is that she comes home

56:02.040 --> 56:06.680
from doing her errands and whoever was trying to get into her apartment all of a sudden shoots her

56:07.320 --> 56:16.280
in her apartment building's vestibule and just runs away but it's like oh no but he this is a

56:16.280 --> 56:22.200
person that's really stupid and that spent weeks trying to get into her apartment and it was is

56:22.200 --> 56:26.360
like very clear from the behaviors he kind of laid it out he's like you know this person wanted in

56:26.360 --> 56:32.600
her apartment and used all the dumbest ways to try to get into her apartment and then out of

56:33.160 --> 56:38.760
absolute frustration just like waited there and probably pulled a gun on her as she came home

56:38.760 --> 56:44.840
and she was military and savvy and was no way she was going to comply and and and then there was a

56:44.840 --> 56:50.360
struggle or something and just she started screaming and he couldn't control the situation so he shot

56:50.360 --> 56:54.920
her so she couldn't be a witness and ran off and that's why it was like but that that's the thing

56:54.920 --> 57:00.520
that was really freaking me up because it made it's like well if it wasn't about uh assaulting her

57:00.520 --> 57:05.800
and it wasn't about robbing her it was like like this this whole thing was a coordinated attempt

57:05.800 --> 57:11.960
to kill one woman and no one's investigating it and but it was like now it was a sloppy it was

57:11.960 --> 57:17.320
just it was it was the same kind of criminal that we're all in danger of all the time like

57:17.320 --> 57:23.080
it's just i was able to file it now thank you asperger detective he's great he is it normal for

57:23.080 --> 57:29.000
for the this true crime stuff for a guy to have just like a really concrete laid out theory that

57:29.000 --> 57:33.800
he supports with several you know i don't know i mean he's like colombo that's what's cool about

57:33.800 --> 57:37.160
it is because like i don't really like true crime but necessarily i mean i don't hate it or whatever

57:37.160 --> 57:42.040
i just don't engage in a lot but like he's just like you know he's like here's the crime and here's

57:42.040 --> 57:47.320
why this person did it who's who's not proven guilty but i'm just going out on a limb and saying i

57:47.320 --> 57:51.800
believe in it and it's just crazy because it's like i don't know if he's right or whatever and

57:51.800 --> 57:56.280
sometimes you don't know if he's right but other times it's just like oh man this guy's just like

57:56.280 --> 58:00.200
they should give him a medal or something definitely look these people up but you know i don't

58:00.200 --> 58:04.520
think a lot of them you know anyway it's just very interesting then he also does these like little

58:04.520 --> 58:09.560
little things once in a while and like you said sometimes he does it badly aggravatingly or

58:09.560 --> 58:15.960
mysteriously but then then boy i heard a couple where he is like nailing it and one of them was

58:15.960 --> 58:23.000
like the kessie kessie uh last name kessie i think that was like this this woman who stabbed her

58:23.000 --> 58:29.240
kids and then tried to pretend like someone came in her house and did it and um and he just at the

58:29.240 --> 58:37.480
end of his uh at the end of some of his episodes he just goes and that's about it and that's why

58:37.480 --> 58:44.040
she stabbed her two children but the reason why she did that is because of the same reason

58:44.040 --> 58:52.360
we do anything right because she's afraid afraid of dying afraid of being alone she can't stand

58:52.360 --> 58:58.440
the idea that her few stolen moments on this planet are precursors to an infinity of darkness

58:58.440 --> 59:05.240
after gaining only a brief glimpse of temporary fleeting light she's worried she's a sentient

59:05.240 --> 59:11.480
mammal like the rest of us she doesn't know should she lose weight should she gain weight is she

59:11.480 --> 59:17.400
doing it wrong did she get the right car he'll do like these crazy like george carlin meets bukowski

59:17.400 --> 59:24.200
like fucking henry miller like uh monologues that aren't really that forced he's like really like

59:24.200 --> 59:31.400
i'm like go aspie beat poet like he he he he really he really he's really does it right i mean it's

59:31.400 --> 59:38.280
burger detective um i i almost woke cody up i'm like you gotta you gotta rewind and listen to

59:38.280 --> 59:43.960
this guy he's like laying it down really laid it down so you have a dan you have a ghillie suit at

59:43.960 --> 59:50.360
your house currently right now is it like in the closet is it on the floor is it in a case like

59:50.360 --> 59:55.640
where is it currently existing right now well it's probably just strewn about the bedroom

59:55.640 --> 01:00:01.240
because when cody saw me in it you know no it's like laying did you have sniper sex that you

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:08.360
did you do a sniper sex no i uh it's probably laying on the uh living room coffee table right

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:14.680
and you you've worn it you've you've strode about in it you've been outside and you've you've communed

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:19.880
with the coyotes no i haven't i'm not yet he doesn't have a ladder yet no you gotta get that ladder

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:27.400
yeah you you went for the ghillie suit before you got ladder ghillie suit came first i don't know why

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:33.000
i got a ladder if you want to borrow it i actually didn't order mine yet oh shit it's

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.520
kind of bluffing them coyotes that's probably good can we do a show where you come out in the ghillie

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:47.560
suit yeah i mean maybe but i guess a proper ghillie suit you'd have to dress up like the dan

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:51.400
as you type right you'd have to wear like mahogany and have a candle on your head and stuff like that

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:57.720
like you'd want to camouflage yourself based on your surroundings yeah i mean right like a big

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:10.840
arm war but who cares you know oh dan wore something stupid i've been this this asperger

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:15.880
detectors have been blowing my mind because like you said he does these wrapy up things that are

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:21.960
like about themes and stuff and it's like it's been like church or something it's made me realize

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:28.600
i was like oh man i'm afraid to ask for thanks and i'm like i gotta ask for stuff more and i've been

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:33.640
analyzing my life oh man it feels good there was something that he did a little bit where i was i got

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:39.080
a little inspiration from it too i was i wonder if it was the same thing ask for what spencer

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:44.920
ask for stuff like for instance like stuff you need you know how people are like oh let me ask

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:51.080
for help or ask for stuff i don't do that i was thinking about it was it's one of the things that

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:58.360
drives myself hatred you know um there's a there's a podcast called i think small town dicks um

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:05.240
and it's uh i'm interested my favorite billy joe song it's a it's a real pro one it's a

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:12.200
yardley smith is that the uh lisa simpson yeah i think it's pronounced yardley no i don't know

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:22.200
yeah uh and um uh her friend and then they have these two detectives and uh it's really well done

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:28.280
it's like a higher-end true crime podcast well produced and um but uh they had an episode where

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:39.000
yardley uh told these the stories about her as a victim uh um and uh there was a couple of them and

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:45.720
then there was one for dessert that was like just insane it was like the the the behavior of the

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:51.720
person trying to victimize her was insane but then it was almost it was almost the profound thing

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:59.960
about it was how how insane she felt as a victim like how she she just she's describing this crazy

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:03.320
behavior in the part of this guy that was doing work on her house and she started running all this

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:09.080
like crazy shit on her and um and you know it's fun it's like i i have i feel like i've noticed

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:18.760
it's like if you picture uh yard yardley uh uh smith as a as an actor she she um she was she

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:25.080
wasn't always just the voice of of lisa simpson like she's she's she's she appears in tv shows and

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:31.640
stuff and she was uh having kind of a heyday in the 90s and she's she's a very small like kind of

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:39.000
adorable sort of like like unassuming like everything about her face kind of kind of

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:47.480
transmits this sort of like uh uh like i don't know unassuming or something energy something

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:54.680
like it and it's interesting because i've heard from from women before like like women there's

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:59.480
certain kinds of like women who are like like like i i have this like kind of thing about me

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:06.760
where guys like they smell something on me and they're like coming after me because they're like

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:11.400
it's like i have this like victim target on my head or something she didn't say anything like

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:15.480
that but it was like it occurred to me while listening to these stories i was like i like i

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:20.680
bet it's not just because she's famous but like it is because it's because like there's certain

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:28.040
people that like they just um i i think like like predators are just like oh yeah i don't know if it's

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:32.200
like they they if they know it's easy prey because it's like it's also it's guys like stalking like

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:37.960
falling in love not just like oh she's an easy target it's more like oh i'm in love i'm in love

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:43.320
yeah i'm just walking with certain people and then like people just yell at them like and it's like

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:49.000
i've never experienced this in my life but it's just like people seek them out and like are comfortable

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.560
throwing shit at them for whatever reason i i don't know if it's a like yeah like a predator

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:59.720
sense or something um yeah and i kind of like it was crazy like like like this actor is telling

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:05.240
this story about this just absolute batshit psycho guy that's like do it work on our house and he's

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:11.960
like ramping up the uh the stuff and she keeps she keeps talking about these these these crazy

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:16.360
points where you're listening to the story and and her friend is listening to the story and saying

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:21.960
like okay so at this point like you did you think about telling anybody about this like crazy thing

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:29.240
that was happening to you and uh and and she always had this reason why no no not at that time or

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:35.480
thing she wasn't being dodgy about it but it kind of built to this moment where she she i mean she's

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:40.920
been through this and figured this all out by now this is decades ago but it was like she the reason

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:47.720
she came to la to be an actor as this tiny person that that that you know isn't necessarily she didn't

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:51.640
look like Farrah Fawcett she was like i'm gonna go eat the world because i'm entitled to it because

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:57.400
of my stature or my whatever it's like there's this like the the culture of her family and her

01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:02.440
psychology in her head was like i gotta own my ambition and i'm gonna go out there and i'm gonna

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:07.320
do this thing and then it's like a very healthy thing like oh own your dreams and visualize your

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:13.320
success and all that stuff and that uh but it comes with this other thing that she's she's getting

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:19.160
victimized by these like crazy stalker guys and she's not telling anybody like and it's it's like

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:26.040
so far beyond points like red flags where where you know she like anyone else might have gotten

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:30.280
killed you just don't know and then but and then she kind of got she got choked up toward the end

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:35.960
because she finally got to a point with this guy where she's simply this guy came over to her house

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:40.840
that was doing work and he had he explained to her that he had just killed two people for her

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:45.480
because they had been following her and he was like laying this whole thing on her and i need

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:53.560
25 000 or just this crazy like weird psycho shakedown and uh and then she just kept letting it go

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:58.360
she still didn't go to anybody and then she describes the moment where she finally she just

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:05.640
runs out of her house and she goes and calls this guy that worked at the studio the fox lot

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:11.720
probably for um for help and she starts like breaking while she's telling the story because

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:18.680
that's that's the thing that got to her was that she finally had to explain to this guy like this

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:24.840
is what's been going on and i like like and you could hear in her voice it's like like like oh

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:29.960
this is the moment of my weakness where i have to tell somebody that i let this get this far and

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:36.200
that i finally need help with it or something and it was just such an interesting that that that

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:44.120
that other side of uh of confidence and ambition and autonomy like you could be you you might be

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:52.360
without knowing it like um pathologically incapable of of of telling somebody you need help um and i

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:57.800
thought i wondered that's what i meant i was like jeez i wonder if i'm that way no if i if

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:03.080
someone goes wrong in my life if i could smear it all over everyone i find that i i can ask people

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:07.960
for things that in a workplace context but outside of that i have a very rough time like

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:12.440
burdening my friends with a request or like i always feel like it's burning but it's just like

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:17.080
hey you want to get a sandwich it's like not you know it's not trying to take anything but it feels

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:24.600
weird to me but it might be a similar thing who knows yeah sorry no i there was nothing i thought

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:29.400
that i was just i just i couldn't believe that story i was i was really taken by it she is like

01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:37.960
like this uh she she she seems like such a um such a remarkable character i like because she

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:43.320
she's like i really like that podcast because they're very they're very like um kind of dug dug

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:48.680
down into the into their little true crime stories and it's it feels it feels less uh ghoulish because

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:53.000
they're talking to detectives so they're the detectives walking them through little cases that

01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:02.120
they have uh a lot of victim blaming a lot of parent blaming like that there was like uh like uh

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:07.800
there was a there was this like uh sex crime thing what the fuck was it it was like

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:15.400
i just remember one of the detectives explaining this made me this put me off having kids forever

01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:19.880
i'm not doing it anymore like i haven't told cody i made the permanent decision but he was he was

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:25.800
like he was like look your kids got an iphone you need to go through that thing or whatever

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:31.400
they're up to it's on you i was like i'm not going through my kids phone if they're like

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:35.960
and you can't keep your kid from having a phone they're like like like you're like until the kids

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:40.840
18 and they're living with you it's your responsibility as a parent modern parenting you

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:45.800
you got to go through their phone and make sure that they're you know you got to check up on them

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:50.680
that's the there's a whole thing happening like to go all these stories about kids that end up

01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:55.640
doing all this fucked up shit or falling into these fucked up worlds like it's all on their phone

01:09:55.640 --> 01:10:01.880
and and that's the that's the same thing as their bedroom um uh if you know in the in the 60s and

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:06.120
like you gotta you gotta it's not their diary it's like you got to go through i'm like i'm

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:11.320
listening to this advice i'm like if that's true and i guess maybe it technically is like like

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:16.120
because god knows no one else is gonna raise your kid for you but and i'm like okay so i'm not

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:23.240
having a kid for sure i'm gonna go through a 12 year old's shit or be the only dad that doesn't

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:28.120
let a 12 year old have whatever the fuck everyone else has you know do you think we ship a sail for

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:32.760
you in terms of children like for good i don't know you know these you know these tadpoles are

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:41.720
still dancing as in ted do it i i learned that the hard way i mean cody it's all it's all up to

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:47.880
cody like i mean it's not up i mean it's like it's it's it's it's driven by her she's she's

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:53.880
she's in her prime she's she's in her creative prime she's in her biological prime i should i'll

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:57.880
i'll do i'll i'll probably do whatever she wants that's not true i'm gonna have like if i

01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:03.160
i think stuff i was seized with like no i definitely don't want kids and then she was like it's time

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:12.760
i might be like uh i don't know i have to gaslight her somehow is there a book on how to gaslight

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:17.800
no i don't know i don't know we're so we're really up in the air we've been we've just been

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:26.200
having is that a uh an imperative for her or no she's not we're not yeah she's not she we don't

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:33.880
don't we're undecided and like she had she had a little period where she was like should i freeze

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:39.880
my eggs she talked to the therapist about it and the therapist was like look if freezing your eggs

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:47.320
is like a ritual you need to engage in that lets you own your life uh then by all means freeze

01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:53.560
your eggs but if you can skip the egg freezing and just and just do the like just stop identifying

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:58.680
yourself by you know it's like that kind of thing like like like don't you shouldn't be this shouldn't

01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:05.560
be running your life that's crazy the therapist probably didn't say that's crazy um but but and

01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:09.160
then cut it was like okay i'm gonna freeze my eggs i told the story and then she like looked at the

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:15.640
information she's like step one don't get high for six months and she's like nope ha ha well you were

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:23.960
okay well eventually you're gonna deal breaker uh but i don't know i read we ran into a friend and

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:32.600
she uh she's in her 40s and she uh she has a podcast about trying to do um inseminate herself

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:38.040
there's a couple of those podcasts out there now um people that are going through the process of

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:44.200
trying to conceive and sharing the the details of it and stuff does that molly hockey's podcast

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:49.160
yeah how do you know well she does a podcast oh okay right that's so weird that i mean it's like

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:53.800
she's she's advertised it on other podcasts that i've listened to okay it must be is it popular

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:58.040
well i don't i know i don't think it's super i mean i don't know especially she's a do you

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:04.760
have desire spencer to be a father or no oh i got all sorts of desires to be a father i don't know

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:11.400
i could i could i could see that i don't know i don't want to force it i don't think that i want

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:18.120
one like a lot but i feel like i could do that you know the ultimate reason to be a father

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:27.000
to prove something to the world yeah i think the ship has sailed from me i mean i could still

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:35.480
do it obviously but i'd like like my father had me when i was 41 i'm 45 and he like i i never had

01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:40.440
any memories of my dad who didn't have gray hair like he was always a salt and pepper

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:46.440
gray haired guy and he taught soccer and baseball and how to ride a horse and how to dig a hole and

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:50.360
do a thing and like he was like like there's like a super dad and it's like i just don't know if i've

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:57.080
got the fucking i do improv yeah i feel like i'm getting such joy out of withdrawing from the world

01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:04.280
and i and like like my in in 13 years if i had a kid tomorrow that's only 13 years i have before

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:10.440
i have another like fucking goober like that i just that i'm trying to cut loose you know it's

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:16.680
like like oh great another fucking like kid that i have to raise i just feel like i feel like i have

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:23.240
to raise 300 000 of them every time i post an instagram i just want to like i just want to

01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:30.040
experience for one moment before i get diagnosed with something like peace like i did it i beat you

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:36.040
guess what i didn't like any of you either ha fooled you you know i thought like just what

01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:41.720
just one one hour of that before before i'm like in charge of whether or not people feel good or

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:48.200
bad about themselves i like i hate people i've lost a lot of faith in the species but i don't

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:54.280
feel like it's a bad thing i feel like my faith was unhealthy it was like a codependence or something

01:14:54.280 --> 01:15:00.120
it was like you know approval addiction or something it's like yeah people are people suck

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.720
like they're they're shitty they're not all shitty and they're not none of them are all

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:10.840
shitty as individuals and and certainly not all people are shitty there's a there's lots and

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:17.800
lots of better ones and all the stuff but it's just in general so like you know bacteria you know

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:24.520
just they're just garbage the internet is just it's just it's it i still struggle now with like

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:31.400
oh is it is it like like i like i felt like my latest insight is like because i posted this

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:37.560
instagram like where it was like the you know the photo of the black hole and uh i thought it was

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:41.960
a reasonable i thought it was a funny joke like like like uh take on the thing it was like the

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:48.200
photo of the black hole and i did this like caption where i was like uh oh it was it was a

01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:53.720
headline that said like meet the woman that took the photo of the black hole and i and i so i did

01:15:53.720 --> 01:16:00.440
this caption that was like okay well uh i saw this headline uh after i wrote my rotten tomatoes

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:07.160
review of the black hole and then did this kind of like review of the black hole where it was very

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:14.760
clear that like i was uh trying to take something away from from the black hole as if it was created

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:21.000
by a woman um and uh it was just it was just like a like a like you know it was like like i thought

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.600
it was a well-crafted like but not like beyond anyone's like reckoning kind of thing and i remember

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:31.080
like at the end of it i was like i was like i always i always like hover over the click button

01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:35.640
i'm like okay what is anybody gonna misunderstand and i remember going like well you say the word

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:39.720
wheelchair at the end that'll probably trigger a couple people and that's okay because i i said

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:46.040
like by the way but bottom line is this black hole is basically just a a collapsed star uh

01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:50.440
that uh could have been predicted by uh almost any guy in a wheelchair or something like that and

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:54.920
i was like uh like uh he said wheelchair and like you you might get a couple like ablest

01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:59.640
comments and that's fine and then it clicked extended and it was like i looked back at it

01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:05.960
and i'm like holy shit it was like it was like like a petri dish and it was crazy it was like 10% of

01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:13.480
300 000 people just just just in all sincerity just going like yeah but just because she's a woman

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:19.400
doesn't make the black hole any less valuable like like in true sincerity i i read that one and i

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:23.480
predicted before i looked at any comments that you're gonna get rumbled on that and then and then

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:28.840
the other 10% are arguing with them and going like no he's right this is fucking bullshit like

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:35.080
identity politics i'm like like like so just like dumb people it was it was actually like a

01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:40.120
out of all the things i've ever done that have been that misunderstood by that many people

01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:43.960
like i was kind of like i regret that one the least because it really is this like moment of

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:49.480
clarity where i'm like you can kind of like see like it felt like equal equal a number of equal

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:56.920
people on two lobes there were just like people that saw concepts that made them want to leap to

01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:03.400
the defense of something with good intentions and people that hated those people is it like

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:09.640
all just like people not exercising any amount of critical thinking really right because there's

01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:16.040
absolutely no way i mean what at what point did you that's why i started thinking about it i was

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:21.640
like okay so are people getting dumber or like and i pictured like okay let's go to the roman

01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:28.040
coliseum and like i think that what's ha i think the part of what the internet is doing is is this

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:33.240
so imagine being at the roman coliseum and there's no there's no technology beyond like you're just

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:38.120
you're just in a crowd of people that's the that's the biggest internetiest crowd you could be in

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:42.840
is just a bunch of people at the coliseum and then someone comes out and they think they're

01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:46.840
they're gonna try to do a little bit you know like they and they like maybe something about

01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:54.440
their bit it's not they didn't think it through i had a i i wrote on the the vma's in 2006 and this

01:18:54.440 --> 01:19:00.040
writer matt murray was like uh he's like you know you're being too nuanced with some of this stuff

01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:06.680
like i wrote i wrote on the jimmy fowlin vma's and like what i learned is that these kinds of

01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:11.080
audiences can express themselves in one of two ways they can they can scream or they can be quiet

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:17.880
it um and and so like so you're imagining like like the bandwidth being lowered so you don't

01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:21.720
have a comment you don't have you know everyone doesn't have like this qwerty keyboard in front

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:26.920
of them and and also but they're connected to each other so think about all the times you've

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:32.440
ever been in public and you've been watching something like at a carnival or something and

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:35.880
like it probably it's probably a hard thing to remember because it probably doesn't stick out

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:39.320
that much in your memory because it's but you could what you can probably remember is that this

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:44.200
happens now and then you just probably can't like conjure up a list of the times you've seen it

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:50.680
but you're at a live performance and something something goes wrong something something goes

01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:56.760
wrong between the performer and the audience the uh the either it's either it's the performers fault

01:19:56.760 --> 01:20:01.960
then that they didn't they didn't realize like how the venue how the timing of it was going to work

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:06.360
or it's just simply like it's a matter of opinion on your part of whether or not the who

01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:10.680
who there's anyone's fault but like you have memories in your head of like a disconnect

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:20.120
happening where somebody in the audience might might go like like oh boo like like like because

01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:28.600
they're responding at the wrong time to the wrong concept and but then like that person

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:36.680
traditionally um they get they they get they get swallowed up either by silence or there's like

01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:42.120
there's a group of people around them that are like off with his head no no and then but then

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:46.200
they'll overhear people going like it's a bit it's a bit it's a bit like like in real time

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:51.400
and it'll just kind of like wash out that that's like usually we're biologically designed for

01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:57.400
that to be a much more organic process and yeah people pop off and they want to be special and

01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:03.160
they want to they want to contribute to things but we're designed biologically to do that in an

01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:08.760
environment where it just like stabilizes itself so quickly and which allows you to not have put

01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:14.360
your ass out there that's the problem I think is that by the time people are telling you these

01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:20.040
days that you're a fucking idiot that which happens to the best of us some shit goes over your head

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:24.760
sometimes you're just looking at stuff the wrong way the wrong angle coffee cup the wrong nutrients

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:31.240
and your breakfast like wrong wrong timing some performers fought sometimes too like uh like

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:37.080
like like but by the time someone is telling you uh you didn't get it it's over your head you don't

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:43.880
have a sense of humor you didn't you didn't get it you have written a fucking essay about about how

01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:49.880
no captain crunch should never be cloned cloning is unethical like there is no captain crunch that's

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:56.440
a serial character and you're like your tendency is therefore going to be to really well yeah

01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:03.080
still though there are considerations like like whereas normally the way you're designed to be

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:07.720
able to do is just go like like you're only you only have just a little bit of a yay or a boo

01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:13.720
coming out of your mouth before you feel that humiliation kick in you don't have this kite

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:19.480
that you've flown that's been designed and and and all this energy put into it and I think that's

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:26.680
and on one hand I think that that's like a way of of looking at it positively and saying like look

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:31.880
we're no different we're not changing that much we're just the just the medium it just it just

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:36.920
it just it just shines different lights in different parts of our general the same amount of

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:42.280
stupidity that we've always had but a really scary way of looking at it is that yeah but that's

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:48.440
that's a feedback loop that is that's a memory you store now it's different than going to a magic

01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:55.320
show and the ladies sawn a little bit in half and you're like call 911 and and like someone goes

01:22:55.320 --> 01:23:02.120
like it's it's magic and and you're like that's a different story you have in your head and you

01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:06.760
file that differently and affects your complete your neurological map completely differently

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:17.240
than I think than if you write a paragraph you know advocating and defending and like

01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:23.560
accusing and and and hashtagging and and then someone is like wow you read that wrong

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:31.400
and and I don't I don't know if that it's like it worries me that that that's going to make the

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:36.600
that that sock off balance it makes the dryer scoot all the way across the basement floor

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:43.320
do you millennials still have socks basements and dryers probably that probably they figured

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:48.520
how to make dryers not scoot across are we living in a post sock millennial world right now they

01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:53.240
probably have like a like like contextually aware like dryers now that are like there's only one

01:23:53.240 --> 01:24:04.040
sock in here I will I will group swarm I will tag three other dryers on the block and receive dry

01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:14.040
sock information from them I want I want to I want to hear more from millennial dryer isn't

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:20.120
it interesting uh I think it was a TED talk I heard when somebody was like this is interesting

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:24.600
this guy like like oh this is the TED talk I want to give it's sort of like just doom saying

01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:34.360
uh somebody explaining that um we can't uh we're not going to stop technology like we keep we I

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:40.040
know we know that in general but we keep the fact that we keep thinking of it like oh if something

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:44.280
goes too far we'll stop it or something goes into a dangerous area they were talking they were talking

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:48.760
about like the smart devices the fact that if you get a new refrigerator now it's it's a good

01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:55.000
chance it'll be like Wi-Fi capable for no reason that some yahoo just of course they put they made

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:00.520
your refrigerator like able to log on to the internet and like check on your juice or something

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:04.680
like like it's it's it always starts with some gimmick you know because oh what if that sells

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:11.480
an extra refrigerator but it's like it it's never gonna stop there is no way you can't opt out of

01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:17.880
this stuff I don't know why I find that interesting I guess I did find it like awful I guess we're

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:25.400
in the end of the show because I'm just drunk and babbling nonsense I I travel so much and then I

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:30.120
I have this thing where like I'll buy some food and then I have to go on the road and I'll put

01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:35.960
everything in the freezer and now I just got nothing but shit in the freezer I just have a

01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:41.560
million loaves of bread in the freezer that I just I that's I what kind of bread we're just gonna

01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:48.280
we're just gonna see we're just gonna turn we're just too old man on a bus stop bench I like a

01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:54.600
mammoth duck variation so that's kind of like I want the bike the bike is nice you never were

01:25:54.600 --> 01:26:02.440
or a red rider wagon I don't know refrigerators are a bummer you let you go you buy some bananas

01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:07.080
and you're like I gotta leave town and you put the bananas in the freezer because you don't want

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:11.560
them to be rotting and then you just got some frozen ass bananas in there and they're black and

01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:19.960
they yeah I mean I haven't I haven't I haven't stepped foot in a grocery store since since

01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:26.840
uh Teddy Roosevelt yeah and whenever it was it was just like for a party or something weird

01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:30.840
like it was some scavenger hunt or something it wasn't like what was the last time you went to a

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:40.920
movie theater hmm I think I fell asleep during that piece of shit uh George Clooney uh Hitler

01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:48.280
stealing art movie uh the the monument the monument man monuments man monuments yeah I went to that uh

01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:53.560
it was it was me and Erin McGathy uh wow that was a while I got that kind of bet no because I felt

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:59.320
Cody and I saw Deadpool together I went to the the Vista theater which I love and I went there to go

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:06.600
see uh Dunkirk and I had a couple drinks and I fell asleep like immediately and then woke up

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:12.920
like about 20 minutes in going like I'm just a drunk guy asleep in a movie theater at a matinee

01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:17.560
and I got up and I left and then I came back the next day sober and then I liked the movie it was

01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:23.000
a good movie yeah you ever go to the theater in like Old Town Pasadena where you you you get the arm

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:27.800
chair oh yeah with the sleep you get the car tails and pretzels to you and don't don't don't feed me

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:32.120
and get me drunk drink a movie I'm gonna fucking fall asleep yeah no that's what I did monuments

01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:37.880
men baby I was probably I was probably snoring I mean I can't imagine they give you a blanket

01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:42.520
don't give me a blanket when Gene Wilder died maybe maybe I spoke about this before when Gene Wilder

01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:47.560
passed away uh the arc light in Hollywood showed a bunch of Gene Wilder films and church and I went

01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:53.240
and saw blazing saddles and it was awesomely people that were over 40 and people that were

01:27:53.240 --> 01:28:01.400
like under 30 I can't imagine and people under 30 the people over 40 were dying laughing because

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:06.040
we've all seen the movie a million times we can karaoke the whole thing and the the youngsters

01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:12.600
were a little uncomfortable yeah because there's 11 n-bombs in the first reel yeah and nobody knew

01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:18.840
where to fucking put it and I I thought it was made it the movie even funnier that people were

01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:25.960
being bummed out at blazing saddles well I mean if you've repeated that process today I think

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:30.680
you'd find the people over 40 would would all right the times have changed so fast that nobody

01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:38.440
would be laughing in there right I guess I don't know it's uh it's good that things are changing

01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:43.240
by the way what sometimes I search my head for that stuff I'm like like like what is that like

01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:49.880
that reaction you have when you hear another thing about like oh so-and-sos uh wants uh from now on

01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:53.960
you they should call this thing that thing and then you like you always have that I always

01:28:53.960 --> 01:29:00.200
have that thing use my i statements I I I always have that like thing or I'm like gaw for crying

01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:07.000
out loud what's it gonna stop you know like all right well never it's never gonna stop yeah like

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:13.480
what and it's like it's kind of it's freaking me out now that I'm 46 because I'm realizing like I'm

01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:21.080
like oh shit they're coming for me and like it doesn't matter how woke I get today tomorrow

01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:27.160
next week like I'm Walt Disney at this point like I've done my crimes my steamboat willies on the

01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:33.560
internet like I can't get it off I like I am problematic I've been problematic for the first

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:38.680
40 years of my life and the older I get the more problematic it's gonna be there's a whole

01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:44.040
another generation coming if I'm lucky enough to make it the 70 there's gonna be uh 20 year olds

01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:48.600
that are gonna make you guys roll your eyes that are gonna be like this guy's Hitler like like

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:53.160
watching my fucking shitty well that's like like doing doing the improv shows that we do with who's

01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:58.600
live uh like there's a bit that we do where we uh we bring out a woman out of the audience and we

01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:05.400
ask her about her life and I sing a song to her and I used to make it way more kind of flirtatious

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:12.280
and romantic and and we did a show in Madison, Wisconsin on the day of the Kavanaugh confirmation

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:19.080
and on the uh the Capitol steps uh in Madison have I said this before have we spoken? I think you

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:24.600
I think you told the story that you that you that you you you checked yourself and before your rigidity

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:29.160
wrecked well we we got a review that day we're standing out there and hearing all these stories

01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:33.720
and everybody got up and got a microphone and told their stories about all the shit that they've

01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:39.640
gone through and it was pretty heavy and then I had to go do an improv show and it's five white guys

01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:45.960
on stage uh doing a show the day that fucking Kavanaugh was confirmed and it was a triggering

01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:53.160
day for a lot of people and we got a review from a woman who just fucking hated us and I dig it

01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:58.840
because that was a bad day for a women kind and for lots of people um but I've I've had to

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:06.680
voluntarily adjust the way that I approach that one improv game um because it's like it's like

01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:12.200
everything is just and for all the good reasons and for every possible reason things have shifted

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:19.720
into a way that like what used to be hilarious is not and in the way that it used to be even

01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:26.760
just a few months ago uh and there's ways to do it and still be funny but without doing the other

01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:35.240
thing yeah before I got me toed uh you got like me three didn't you I think I got me one and a half

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:43.800
but um even before that like on the you know when the when the Weinstein kind of like water table

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:50.200
uh did whatever water tables do I don't know I'm not nautical um but um but I remember like kind

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:54.360
of like okay all right now let's examine ourselves let's be aware of what's going on and I remember

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:59.560
running in my through my head for like the first time in my life I was just sort of in shows like

01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:06.120
whether it's on stage at the workplace with strangers anybody it was kind of like because

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:11.880
I it started with me going like okay what about that what about that relationship um

01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:18.120
um and and stumbling upon the idea of like well were you were you did it matter was it like

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:22.600
oh examine and doing all this negotiation in my head and then I was like uh something made me go

01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:29.400
well why don't you look at it this way what what what if it was uh this guy that you had the same

01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:35.400
set of circumstances with like swapped out the woman in my head for a guy and then was like

01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:40.440
whoa like like all of a sudden was like wait no I would the guy would have been like what are you

01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:46.840
doing stop or if people were just been like what what's with you or I would have been like what's

01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:52.600
with myself and then kind of like blossoming out in my head going like oh god every Dunkin

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:58.120
Donuts cashier anybody like like in any time because there's a lot of stuff that like also part of

01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:03.160
growing up don't you don't you feel like you came of an age where you were like actually a lot of

01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:13.640
it was like absolutely not anything but like learning to be uh actually kind and uh um charming or

01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:20.440
funny or you know what I mean like like part of being a man like and becoming confident it was

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:26.200
like and you'd get you get it was involved like sexualizing like I don't mean sexualizing like

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:31.160
the activity I mean like gender-wise but like like kind of like like getting like like sort of like

01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:40.040
acknowledging the differences between you and the person you're talking to it was like it was

01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:46.360
like the equivalent of like learning to use a flathead screwdriver like you were graduating from

01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:53.240
Fisher price to Sears tools and it felt benevolent it didn't it felt the opposite of

01:33:53.240 --> 01:34:00.440
predatory it felt gracious and chivalrous and charming and all this stuff and but then you

01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:09.000
look back on it and you go okay but now these kids are ready for like whether that was right or wrong

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:15.240
or doesn't really matter now the kids are ready they're like okay but let's wipe that clean like

01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:23.480
don't talk to anybody uh uh in a way that acknowledges like anything that you perceive with your

01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:32.200
eyeballs period like just see them as a fucking like tennis ball on a stick and like get ready for

01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:38.520
you know be AI compatible in your dealings and you will that then you don't have to worry about it

01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:44.360
you'll talk about what scares you talk about what you know and don't all of those areas are problem

01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:48.280
areas and I think that is what's frustrating for people is they're like oh what so I could never

01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:53.000
do this I could never do that like yeah you can't it's like yeah it's frustrating it is like a bunch

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.840
of stuff that you did last week like it's not on the table anymore and it's frustrating and

01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:02.520
embarrassing and I do and I do think that like the the problem that the perpetuating cycle thing is

01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:08.760
that the people don't they don't understand that the idea of correcting people or or hoping that

01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:14.520
people get better it shouldn't be such a gleeful activity because that's you're not you're not

01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:21.160
gonna make any new converts like it's like that's exactly their nightmare so the only way that you

01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:28.040
learn that you that that that it's it's sex worker instead of prostitute now there's no hogwarts for

01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:33.720
that you know if you're 48 years old you you could be the best person in the world if I went back

01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:38.440
through all of all of Harmontown there's a thousand things I would take back and not not have said

01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:42.200
again because they're not they weren't funny then and they wouldn't be funny now like it's it's like

01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:47.480
there's so many there's there's a couple things I said on whose line that aired on tv that I would

01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:52.680
go oh no I'd never fucking say that again because it's like it doesn't I don't think it was funny

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:57.160
then but but I was allowed to get away with it then well that's what I'm saying and that's what

01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:03.560
it's almost like karma because it's like how how much glee have we taken when we were 18 and 25 like

01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:09.800
the idea that uh oh there was some time long ago when that you could scroll back in the micro

01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:19.480
fission like aha Kleenex had a racist ad like and we felt superior I'd be like aha like like like I

01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:25.000
caught you you know when you would dig that stuff up it's it was just like more of a difficult thing

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:31.640
to do and it was more profound back then I was like but we it and then that makes me shudder now

01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:40.600
because it's like oh you're you're next like you're you're frigid air you're disney you're you're just

01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:46.120
you're an institution if you're lucky every disney you walked on main street and there was a

01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:51.960
they're gone now there was curtains had swastikas on them but I think it was swastikas in the old

01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:56.760
like like a native american thing where it wasn't like an like a like that's sure yeah that's an old

01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:02.520
symbol but they were there I remember if you even fucking see a fucking swastika curtain up in the

01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:08.840
main street that's wild man do you remember do you remember how mr. toad's wild ride would take you

01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:19.160
through al sass Lorraine uh yeah you you had to go invade the sedate and land and uh and and annex the

01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:23.480
al sass Lorraine fucking mr. toad's wild ride I don't know if you guys have ever fucking been on

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:33.160
this thing it's great because it's a story of a bunch of animals led by a toad and there's ratty

01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:39.240
and there's whatever the famoli and whatnot and you go and you start at a bar then you go get

01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:47.640
some pie and then you go to hell because it's about it's about drunk driving where you go to jail

01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:51.960
then you get hit by you escape jail you get hit by a train you die you go to hell and then it's

01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:58.120
the end of the ride and I think it's just it's just a cautionary tale about being British

01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:07.320
also we went on it was fucking freezing it's the coldest I've ever been in Los Angeles or

01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:12.760
Orange County it was just dead cold outside we went on mr. toad's wild ride a bunch and because

01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:18.120
it's one of the rides it doesn't have cameras inside so we all had flasks of booze so when you go

01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:24.360
inside and you get in the car and you go inside you could just drink on it and then at the end

she does with her cold feet that doesn't track it's stupid wait what do you why not a street a street

01:40:55.880 --> 01:41:01.720
is a terrestrial cultural yeah but the trove is like a trove it's there's fucking troves underwater

01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:06.520
that she's felt very familiar with it it's like a nothing to her you get a trove in your kinsignera

01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:12.760
when you're a mermaid right they're like here's your trove here's your fucking coconut bra or

01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:33.080
street I'm not gonna I'm not gonna let you uh revisit the little mermaid thank god I just think

01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:39.480
that's a weird thing she also very conveniently the two words that she doesn't remember rime

01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:47.080
street street and feet listen listen to yourself listen to what you've way to go and Andrew Lloyd

01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:55.640
whoever fucking wrote that Andrew Lloyd Weber what that's that's he down that's a good fish joke

01:41:55.640 --> 01:42:01.640
because his toes are webbed webbed feet you know fucking like the swamp man you know you guys know

01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:09.880
about the swamp man yeah he has webbed feet I have web feet you guys know that do you really

01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:19.480
know I got two web toes ladies I think I think church has got a web foot to hell yeah you know

01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:25.240
what they say you guys you got a web toe right syndactically yeah that's what I got I got the

01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:35.720
second and two on each foot yeah that's what I got twins oh hell yeah we can swim oh yeah

01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:43.000
yeah do you guys know my times the fly it probably doesn't really help us swimming right

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.640
and that oh no like even if it was a little bit like all olympic teams would have like

01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:52.440
all people with this yeah I mean swimming is like all technique it's really hard but they

01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:57.880
like shave their arms and stuff I mean like every you know you would think like like they're very

01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:03.720
conscious of like every little detail yeah so I would think I would assume that if having like

01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:09.960
webbed toe I think pinching your toes together approaches the the resistance of webbed toes

01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:13.480
church have you found that your webbed toes have given you an advantage in the pool

01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:23.400
of course yes you don't have to say about guys with webbed feet webbed hands yeah right is that

01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:31.640
what you're gonna say I was gonna say web dick but oh web gloves webbed dick I think all dicks are

01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:38.440
webbed all dicks are webbed it's true it's like the spitting dinosaur from Jurassic Park

01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:41.560
it's like the frill that yeah

01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:53.880
Nigel likes to go under the covers like habitually he likes to sleep like right on my thigh he likes

01:43:53.880 --> 01:44:00.520
to go under the covers and he sleeps right here like where robocops gun would be hell yeah but

01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:07.080
then every once in a while I like I will I will I will I will I will I will I will I will wake up

01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:17.240
with the morning two messians and then I will I will I will I will pull down my meundies and

01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:28.280
I'm kind of like let let Tim Allen syndicate you gotta I'm not sure I follow that well it's

01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:36.040
a I that's because I coined it it's a new way of saying I was quite proud of it but

01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:42.040
you know I just just you know you get it you're all you're all bunched up in your undies and

01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:48.120
then you get like the thing that I just I just like to my science of it is like you know I'm

01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:53.720
not gonna I'm not gonna make it the world's problem before I've let it like like wear itself out maybe

01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:59.000
you know I just just like I think it's like a so it's a self-fulfilling prophecy if you're a guy

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:03.640
you're sleeping in briefs and then this happens in the mornings and then like the first thing

01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:08.760
that's happening to your wiener is that's like encountering resistance which you're we according

01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:15.240
to your wiener is like encouragement your wieners like that's what I'm all about like I want something

01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:20.680
to fight me like that's that's that's what that's that's that's called rubbing and it's like well

01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:26.280
no it's also called like you're you're misbehaving and you're in the way and we're trying to sleep

01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:34.600
so I will I will just pull my my me undies down the like knee level like and just just let it let

01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:41.480
it just let the let the flagpole write it out yeah so that it'll stop getting encouragement

01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:46.200
and it'll just it'll just feel itself like like it'll just amelia airheart into the now you have

01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:50.680
a permuted triangle it'll just be like just be free go ahead and dream but like like leave us out of

01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:56.200
it but but now you have a a robocop dog but then the dog will come and like like it's like no you

01:45:56.200 --> 01:46:00.680
can't come under and then like the dog is like very insistent and I'm like I got a hard on like

01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:08.280
yeah anyways but that's so wait wait what what so what happened well nothing I'm not so you're

01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:12.360

01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:24.040

01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:28.600
of anything given its proclivity for munching on my underwear I don't even want to know what would

01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:39.000

01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:36.760
to be right how the end or the end question mark or no question it's how far do you have to go

01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:44.840

01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:28.120
Superman would eat this apple and you're like just write it my lift driver tonight had the

01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:36.680
the best name his name was unique unique they're all fake now people using fake names

01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:39.960
is that you think so well yeah I mean a lot of people are a lot of people

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:45.800
get their accounts banned and they make new fake accounts to keep driving for the companies

01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:51.880
I don't know how that works just a draft you're just a draft damn I already know it's just a

01:49:51.880 --> 01:50:01.560
draft I can't it's not the problem runs deeper than that man yeah you're a flash expert oh the

01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:08.600
flash oh flash expert what's your name again Jacob the flash would be able to flash so fast

01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:23.160
yeah well that's his solution to everything you know yeah I'm sure Barry Allen screenplays suck

01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:28.760
and and again it's not the goal is not to not write a sucky screenplay like I got deeper problems

01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:33.640
than that I just for me it's like it's a good there's something there's something like like
