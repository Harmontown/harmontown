{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:18.320\nHello. Look at this green suit. That's fantastic. What's your name, sir? James in the green\n\n00:18.320 --> 00:25.320\nsuit. I love it. Did you win the Augusta National? What happened? Super villain suit. All right.\n\n00:25.320 --> 00:38.320\nHello, when and all. I'm your comptroller, Jeff Davis. Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:38.320 --> 00:47.040\nIt's good to be back. It feels like it's been a long, long time. Let's bring out our\n\n00:47.040 --> 00:59.640\nGame Master because I love him and adore him. Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden. What up, Spencer?\n\n00:59.640 --> 01:07.680\nOh, yeah. How you feeling, man? I'm feeling couched. I got to couch. Yeah. You've upgraded\n\n01:07.680 --> 01:20.360\nfrom chair to couch. Oh, yeah. All right. For my hip, I'm 62. Is your hip hurting you? Oh, yeah. I'm dying.\n\n01:20.360 --> 01:26.120\nAll right, we all, yeah. Speaking of dying, let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n01:26.120 --> 01:48.960\nYeah, rapid, rapid to the beat. Rapid, rapid, rapid, can't repeat. Dan, you sound like you might be a little\n\n01:48.960 --> 02:01.040\nunder the weather. Yeah, I get sick like once every two years. I guess this is it. Stayed up a couple\n\n02:01.040 --> 02:10.320\ntoo, too many days and just caught something, I guess. Don't use this microphone. I might be playing\n\n02:10.320 --> 02:15.560\nit up a little bit. You know, you can do that. You sound like a Hall's mental elliptist commercial\n\n02:15.560 --> 02:22.680\nfrom the 90s. Death that could penetrate this derpy those. If you're 100% healthy, you can't fake\n\n02:22.680 --> 02:30.360\nlike sounding sick. But if you're like 5% sick, you can crank it up to like 70% easy. You just have to like,\n\n02:30.360 --> 02:38.080\nit's actually a matter of just not doing anything. You just like, just don't, you just don't, you just do\n\n02:38.080 --> 02:42.680\nwell so that you sound real sick. Is it the kind of sickness that you can enjoy? You have like tomato soup\n\n02:42.680 --> 02:48.840\nand grilled cheese sandwich and some hot cocoa and you watch TV or is it a bummer? It's kind of, look,\n\n02:48.840 --> 02:54.120\nI'm not in any physical pain. It's the kind of sick that's a manifestation of the psychological\n\n02:54.120 --> 03:00.800\nmisery I'm in. It's self-imposed. My therapist and I are making some real breakthroughs, but\n\n03:00.800 --> 03:07.400\nunfortunately, it's like realizations of how fucked up I am. And, you know, like, she's really getting\n\n03:07.400 --> 03:15.200\nthrough to me. What is the, what's the headlines of your... Just like how I'm like a creature of denial,\n\n03:15.200 --> 03:20.000\nlike how, like, you know, just kind of like stuff that, I don't know, it doesn't sound as profound\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:26.760\nwhen you repeat it, but like, you know, I've been not finishing the script for like weeks. So every\n\n03:26.760 --> 03:31.920\nweek I go in there, and she's like the one person I don't have to lie to, that's not going to behoove\n\n03:31.920 --> 03:37.480\nme to lie to. So I was like, I could just go in and go, nope, nope, I didn't turn it in again. And\n\n03:37.480 --> 03:42.360\ninstead of being like, oh, I'm almost done or whatever. And, you know, so it's been kind of a case\n\n03:42.360 --> 03:49.000\nstudy in like, you know, just the process and how it gets hung up and blocked and fucked up and\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:56.160\nlike what's going on in my head, like how I managed to make like my process difficult. But this has\n\n03:56.160 --> 04:00.680\ngot to be the last time I ever do this. I'm not doing it no more. I'm not writing anything by myself\n\n04:00.680 --> 04:05.200\nanymore. Because I can't do it. There's something wrong with me. Like that's what, that's what we\n\n04:05.200 --> 04:09.760\nfigured out. And the thing is she's like, she's like, yeah, there's something wrong with you. She's\n\n04:09.760 --> 04:14.240\nlike, I think you got to admit that there's something uncontrollable, you know, like that's what\n\n04:14.240 --> 04:17.720\nyou have to do in situations like this, like you got to treat it like an addiction, like you're\n\n04:17.720 --> 04:24.720\nbasically addicted to fucking up your deadlines, like you, you are like, like you, you will have a\n\n04:24.720 --> 04:28.160\nthought in your head. This is what I thought was interesting, because I think you can apply this\n\n04:28.160 --> 04:34.320\nto anything. And I'm sure it's like a talk to it's like, but it's like the idea that you can\n\n04:34.320 --> 04:40.880\nwhatever you're up against, you know, there are some things that you can't control some thoughts\n\n04:40.880 --> 04:48.280\nyou can't control. Like, and so procrastination or things like there's some some some things where\n\n04:48.280 --> 04:53.480\nlike the reason why you keep doing the same fucked up shit over and over again is because the\n\n04:53.480 --> 04:58.960\nthought is in your head already, it's not you don't get a choice, you know, you're not there at\n\n04:58.960 --> 05:04.400\nthe point where you're making the choice to think, you know, haven't you ever like, everybody's got\n\n05:04.400 --> 05:09.120\nsomething, whether you're a smoker or drinker, or, you know, I think it's more profound when it's\n\n05:09.120 --> 05:13.640\nnot something like that, but it helps to use that stuff as metaphorically when you realize like,\n\n05:13.640 --> 05:21.000\noh, look at your procrastination as like a, as like a cigarette, because what are you getting out\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:24.680\nof it? I don't know. I was like, I've been puzzling through it for weeks gone like, what is it? What\n\n05:24.680 --> 05:29.080\nam I addicted to the shame? Am I like afraid to be happy? And all that stuff sounds so corn ball.\n\n05:29.080 --> 05:35.040\nAnd then it was finally like, she's like, she's like, look, it doesn't matter. Like, it's like,\n\n05:35.040 --> 05:40.440\nthe answer, it doesn't matter if you get if you figure that shit out or not, you're kind of addicted\n\n05:40.440 --> 05:46.640\nto trying to figure shit out first of all, like, that's part of the process is that you you, but\n\n05:46.640 --> 05:52.480\nI think what you have to accept is that there's like a wall of ice in your brain that like,\n\n05:52.480 --> 05:58.200\nis there before you choose it? I'm sorry, I'm repeating myself, but that like, that's the\n\n05:58.200 --> 06:05.640\nprofound thing is that is that it's already there. And the only way to do anything about it is you\n\n06:05.640 --> 06:13.880\ngot to accept that, okay, I'm going to be thinking this fucked up thought before way before I ever\n\n06:13.880 --> 06:20.200\neven it's there, it's like a time traveler, it's just there before it's pre fucked up whatever\n\n06:20.200 --> 06:24.480\nyour relationship that if you've always fucked up your relationships, you know, over whatever\n\n06:24.480 --> 06:28.760\nway you're self destructive, it's like, like think of these things that always do you always\n\n06:28.760 --> 06:34.520\nseem to do stop waiting for you to like, figure out how to do it differently with an epiphany\n\n06:34.520 --> 06:40.200\nor something and just accept that, you know, first things first, like, I always do this,\n\n06:40.200 --> 06:45.560\nI'm always thinking this before I even decide I'm thinking it and and I like, I'll even deny that\n\n06:45.560 --> 06:49.240\nI'm thinking of it or I'll think of something else, because until you admit that and then you\n\n06:49.240 --> 06:54.600\nknow, that language is familiar until you accept that you've got this problem, like you can't do\n\n06:54.600 --> 06:59.080\nthe thing that you need to do, which is take contrary action, which is just the equivalent of\n\n06:59.080 --> 07:03.800\nlike a fucking sit up, but you kind of have like two addictions, then don't you because like you\n\n07:03.800 --> 07:10.920\ngot no addictions. If you're a dick, if you have a procrastination addiction, you also have an\n\n07:10.920 --> 07:17.640\naddiction to creating stuff, like that's a huge part of who you are. Well, I'd like to call that\n\n07:17.640 --> 07:24.760\nbluff as soon as possible. I mean, I like making stuff. I like making stuff I don't have to make,\n\n07:24.760 --> 07:30.200\nthough. Like, I don't know. Yeah, wouldn't we all would all like to have created a thing that we\n\n07:30.200 --> 07:35.160\ndidn't have to work hard on? Like I would like to have a book. I'm never going to sit down and\n\n07:35.160 --> 07:40.840\nwrite one because I'm a lazy, terrified, bad writer. Oh, man, Jeff, you got to get a ghost\n\n07:40.840 --> 07:47.240\nwriter. I'd read your book. It'd be all your cool stories. What if I actually got a real ghost?\n\n07:47.240 --> 07:53.960\nOh, that'd be great. I know a guy. The exorcist. I'll go straight. Your book is a ghost right\n\n07:53.960 --> 08:03.400\nnow. Oh, chapter one. Oh, room full of dicks. I can't wait to suck them. That's problematic.\n\n08:03.400 --> 08:15.560\nOh, ghost writer. I got you. It's me, Dan. I died. Just to do this bit. Don't go on the West Wing.\n\n08:15.560 --> 08:25.400\nIt stinks. I ate myself to death. My body doesn't stink. It's the food. I don't know. What are you\n\n08:25.400 --> 08:30.520\ntrying to add onto that for? You're selling past the close. How many current dead lions do you\n\n08:30.520 --> 08:40.200\nhave? I got them down to like, I'm going to count them. I got one. It's this thing that I've been\n\n08:40.200 --> 08:50.280\ncoveching about for the last couple of weeks. It was truly due today. All these projects,\n\n08:50.280 --> 08:57.880\nthey'll always be like a guy who's like, it's just fucking, it's the saddest thing. This is a\n\n08:57.880 --> 09:05.080\nlook back on my life. I go like, oh, these poor people that I get permission from. I go like,\n\n09:05.080 --> 09:10.920\noh man, can I have one more day? And like, yeah, man, it's all good. I'm like, oh, you're such a\n\n09:10.920 --> 09:15.480\ngood guy. I'm like, I was just trying to go back through my life and go like, how many of them get\n\n09:15.480 --> 09:20.200\nrewarded for this? Patience? Like, should they just come over to my house and punch me?\n\n09:20.760 --> 09:25.160\nWeren't you better when you had like a Stuart Krenfeld that would just yell at you and say,\n\n09:25.160 --> 09:29.960\nwhere is it? Where is it? I don't know if he got more or less for his, where is it? Where is it?\n\n09:29.960 --> 09:35.160\nI don't know. Jack Rappke was like, was like, you know, the thing that I remember, I mean,\n\n09:35.160 --> 09:39.960\nit was just, but I still didn't like, I still just shit out Monster House at the end of it and\n\n09:39.960 --> 09:46.600\nlike gave it to him because, but it was like, but I remember him going like, like the, I don't know,\n\n09:46.600 --> 09:51.880\nlike the third time he had to call me and Stuart or Jack Rappke at Image Movers. And I was writing\n\n09:51.880 --> 09:56.200\nMonster House. This is 20 years ago, but it still sticks out in my head that he was, because he\n\n09:56.200 --> 10:01.800\nwas just like old school Hollywood and like, fuck was every other word is just like really,\n\n10:01.800 --> 10:07.400\nlike interesting guy. Like, like, I mean that, like, it was just like, like, it was just like,\n\n10:07.400 --> 10:13.880\neverything was fucking this and fucking that and hey, listen, I got it. And then he got like,\n\n10:13.880 --> 10:19.320\nI just remember him going like, like, I told him like a third time, like, yeah, I'm not quite done\n\n10:19.320 --> 10:23.320\nyet. I'm still working at something. I just got it, whatever. And there's just this long silence\n\n10:23.320 --> 10:31.880\nand he goes like, all right, well, I'll tell you what fucking Dan. At this point, not going to\n\n10:31.880 --> 10:37.240\nbother calling you anymore because there's no fucking credibility here. Something like that's\n\n10:37.240 --> 10:43.000\nall I remember. I was like, damn, no credibility. Shit, I can go get a sandwich now.\n\n10:44.600 --> 10:48.200\nWait, that didn't light a fire under your ass? No, it just made me feel real bad.\n\n10:48.200 --> 10:53.400\nBut you still finished it? Not really. Did you see that fucking thing? What is it?\n\n10:54.440 --> 10:57.800\nLike, it's like, it's like the first 20 pages is great. And then it's like,\n\n10:58.440 --> 11:01.560\nit's probably not even great anymore. Because it's like, oh, wow, you want to have sex with\n\n11:01.560 --> 11:10.520\nthat girl scout? That's that that aged well. Two kids ordering or arguing over who gets to\n\n11:11.240 --> 11:15.400\nIs deadless one of these things that you're working on? No. I mean, that's a that I wouldn't\n\n11:15.400 --> 11:19.160\ncall that a deadline necessarily. That's like an active project that I'm very excited about.\n\n11:19.160 --> 11:23.880\nI'm not like, there's nobody that's like, you're fucking me over. So wait, okay, so I'm counting\n\n11:23.880 --> 11:29.480\nthe one thing. And then I do think like, I just got a bunch of shit off like one, two, three things\n\n11:29.480 --> 11:36.200\noff my plate. And yeah, I think that's it. I think I think that's truly it. And you only have\n\n11:36.840 --> 11:41.640\n50,000 more episodes of Rick and Morty to write, which is great. No, Rick and Morty is like, I\n\n11:41.640 --> 11:47.160\ndon't want to say it's easy, but it's like it's it's it's a healthy process now, you know, like\n\n11:47.160 --> 11:57.480\nit's it's like Rick and Morty's like, you know, we're it's it's it's fine. Like, that's the job\n\n11:57.480 --> 12:02.200\nthat I want. That's the job that I signed the deal to do. And as soon as I got that contract,\n\n12:02.200 --> 12:07.560\nI was like, okay, let's start wrapping up all these other dalliances. And there was just like\n\n12:07.560 --> 12:13.560\n50 of them. Because because like, what are you supposed to do? You know, you know, you know,\n\n12:14.760 --> 12:20.440\nthere's no I mean, look, I'm one of the luckiest writers in Los Angeles in the in the TV industry\n\n12:20.440 --> 12:29.400\ngot to be one of the 1% luckiest in in in a in a field that if you're represented in paying\n\n12:29.400 --> 12:35.320\nyour rent writing that those those people represent like to top whatever percent of the\n\n12:35.320 --> 12:40.280\npopulation of the planet in terms of luxury, in terms of like, you know, the amount of work you\n\n12:40.280 --> 12:44.040\nhave to do for the amount of money you get, and then I'm up in the upper echelon of those people\n\n12:44.040 --> 12:49.800\nbecause I make like, I'll get a check from community sometimes and I'll get a check from from this or\n\n12:49.800 --> 12:55.000\nthat. And it's still like until I got that Rick and Morty deal, I was like, well, yeah, but how\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:59.640\nam I going to retire? And then you get it's like, I guess that segues into this WGA thing, like,\n\n12:59.640 --> 13:05.240\nI guess I got it. I got it. Everybody firing their agent. Okay, good. All right. Yeah, yeah, I put\n\n13:05.240 --> 13:10.600\non the road and and not totally hip to that. Like what what is the deal with the WGA deal? Packaging\n\n13:10.600 --> 13:17.080\nJeff. It's all about packaging. You know about packaging. I'm packaging right now right. We're\n\n13:17.080 --> 13:23.880\nall packaging. I really can't speak with authority. I can't even go ahead. Go ahead. No, I don't know\n\n13:23.880 --> 13:30.280\npackaging is when the agents basically cut themselves further into the pie for making deals\n\n13:30.280 --> 13:36.680\nwith multiple talents and parties. So they they tell they say, Hey, literary agent, like, we'll\n\n13:36.680 --> 13:43.960\nget this writer and Hey, TV agent and Hey TV actor will get you and also we'll get 10% more of\n\n13:43.960 --> 13:49.880\neveryone's money, you know, of everyone's deals for packaging. So they get 10% on top of the money\n\n13:49.880 --> 13:55.480\nthey already get from the individual parties. And I'm probably way off. But that's a big part of it\n\n13:55.480 --> 14:00.360\nbecause it's just them, you know, cutting, cutting a huge chunk more of the money than\n\n14:00.360 --> 14:05.640\nthey're already being paid to get. And so yeah, the WGA is this guy chunks of money\n\n14:06.680 --> 14:14.280\nor carving anti carving. Who does that affect the worst? The WGA, the writers,\n\n14:14.280 --> 14:20.520\nbecause they no longer have the same connections and you know, there's probably obviously this is\n\n14:20.520 --> 14:27.800\na union of very smart people that like to type a lot. So there's a lot of invective, a lot of\n\n14:27.800 --> 14:35.160\nlike Patrick Henry, give me my quill or give me my sword kind of stuff online that'll make you I\n\n14:35.160 --> 14:43.880\nmean, I, I really, I don't know how you once it's 9795% you know, turning out in a vote, which it's\n\n14:43.880 --> 14:51.560\nlike, I'm just going to defer to my better crafts people who've thought about this more. And I did\n\n14:51.560 --> 14:56.760\ntalk to a couple of colleagues and said like, look, can you explain this to me? And like, because\n\n14:56.760 --> 15:02.680\nif all this is is that we that that times are hard all over that Rome is burning. And so everyone's\n\n15:02.680 --> 15:06.840\njust starting to grab each other and shake each other down, you know, and the package is just a\n\n15:06.840 --> 15:10.920\ncluster of money that we're like, okay, now let's worry about that now that it's not the\n\n15:11.480 --> 15:16.520\ncocaine 80s anymore. And like, there's not money just like everywhere. But and then someone was\n\n15:16.520 --> 15:20.280\nlike, no, no, no, it's not it's it's it's lack of transparency and stuff like that. And they kind\n\n15:20.280 --> 15:28.920\nof walked me through it. And I took my you know, my agents took me out to dinner. And there's such\n\n15:28.920 --> 15:36.200\na sweet, sweet table of little cherubs. They're human beings. They didn't they didn't choose\n\n15:37.400 --> 15:42.680\nthis stuff. They don't run their their agency or the industry for the last 30 years. And they're\n\n15:42.680 --> 15:49.000\nthey're a little broken hearted that writers are such. We're so dramatic when we really set our\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:54.200\nmind to something like they just they're feeling like very bad. I think you're saying writers\n\n15:54.200 --> 15:59.560\nare dramatic. Yeah, I think it's very I always thought it was very profound. I mean, I that that\n\n15:59.560 --> 16:04.680\nlike, we have this industry out here where, you know, things that in any other part of the world\n\n16:04.680 --> 16:10.280\nmight be just too frivolous for there to be such compartmentalized and industrialized like a division\n\n16:10.280 --> 16:18.280\nof labor. And because even, you know, that we developed these breeds, and that it's always,\n\n16:18.280 --> 16:26.520\nyou know, I'm so thankful that there's this like breed of industry person that does just every part\n\n16:26.520 --> 16:33.000\nof the job of working as a writer that I would rather kill myself than do, which I mean, notably\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:39.720\njust like selling me like telling people that I'm good and that I should have a job. I would if I\n\n16:39.720 --> 16:44.600\nwould never I would die of starvation before I did that would never be like, well, I'm pretty good\n\n16:44.600 --> 16:49.560\nwriter. Think, think you should maybe what are you doing over here like a Star Trek reboot like\n\n16:49.560 --> 16:54.040\nlook, I've been I've been I've been I've been loving Star Trek maybe you've seen some of my work\n\n16:54.040 --> 16:57.800\nhere's something you can read like I don't know if they come pretty good like I would just like\n\n16:57.800 --> 17:03.560\nnow I'm gonna I didn't know that John Travolta was a writer. John Travolta, what are you working\n\n17:03.560 --> 17:14.280\non right now? You got a you got a new script for us? I'm working on tell all about the the set\n\n17:14.280 --> 17:21.000\nof Broken Arrow. I got to say Broken Arrow is not my favorite John Travolta movie. Well,\n\n17:21.560 --> 17:28.120\nwhy don't you take a flying hose on a rubber hose? I've sound like Bobcat going through it.\n\n17:31.880 --> 17:37.080\nWhat did they say? And welcome back Connor. Take a take a sit on a rubber hose or take a put your\n\n17:37.080 --> 17:41.240\nnose up your nose with a rubber hose. Thank you. Thank you. I always say up your butt with a coconut,\n\n17:41.240 --> 17:44.840\nbut that wasn't from welcome back Connor. No, I don't think you could say that back down.\n\n17:44.840 --> 17:48.520\nYeah, you couldn't say up your butt. They wouldn't say up your nose if they could say up your butt.\n\n17:48.520 --> 17:53.720\nRight. They're like, we got to put it somewhere. They're like, you get it. The nose is like the\n\n17:53.720 --> 17:59.800\nass. How is that happy days when they would say sit on it? Sit on it seems almost worse than\n\n17:59.800 --> 18:03.560\nup your nose. Yeah, that's sit on it. What am I supposed to sit on? Probably your dick, right?\n\n18:04.440 --> 18:09.480\nI'm assuming either. Well, they were in the they were usually in the men's room when they told\n\n18:09.480 --> 18:14.920\nsomebody to sit on it. And honestly, like regardless of what you're sitting on, it's probably going\n\n18:14.920 --> 18:21.080\nup your ass. I mean, there's really no getting around that. I can't believe that. Who made happy\n\n18:21.080 --> 18:25.800\ndays? Who's the creator on that one? Gary Marshall. Is it Gary Marshall? I had his office at Paramount.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:32.520\nOh, yeah? Yeah, my office was. That wasn't your eccentric days when you would show up at Paramount\n\n18:32.520 --> 18:37.480\nin a fucking bathrobe like one of the Wachowsky brothers or whatever, right? Yeah, I guess sometimes\n\n18:37.480 --> 18:42.440\nI do that. Then I got fired. But like, I mean, sometimes you got to edit on a Saturday. I'm not\n\n18:42.440 --> 18:49.480\ngoing to put pants on. I shot that Daryl video in that office was Gary Marshall's office. Did you\n\n18:49.480 --> 18:53.800\nreally show up to Paramount just in pajamas and slippers and stuff? Yeah, I would go there. Like,\n\n18:53.800 --> 18:58.440\nyeah, like usually like when it was like in the thick of things when it was like, oh, you got to\n\n18:58.440 --> 19:03.000\nwork on the weekends, which I would do. But it was like, oh, I got to go in on the weekend. And I'm\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:08.040\njust going to sit and pull into Paramount's lap, go into an edit bay and sit there for six hours and\n\n19:08.600 --> 19:13.960\nship an episode. Yeah, that's where I'll wear my pajamas. I saw you and me Wednesday in the last\n\n19:13.960 --> 19:19.320\nepisode of this. You came out in your little Jimmy Jams. Yeah, that was really good. Oh, all right.\n\n19:19.320 --> 19:23.960\nWell, so we got we do have some some items to go over. Like, I feel like this one's kind of urgent\n\n19:23.960 --> 19:33.960\nbecause for fans of my workout, which they are legion a couple days ago, a couple workouts ago,\n\n19:33.960 --> 19:39.640\nwe were talking about my coyote problem. And I I had ordered this ghillie suit, like, which is where\n\n19:39.640 --> 19:45.320\nyou look like a swamp thing. And it came and I like I wore it during my workout and stuff. But\n\n19:45.320 --> 19:49.960\nI was like, you know, I was talking before. Hang on, can I pause here for a second? Why did you\n\n19:49.960 --> 19:55.960\nget a ghillie suit for your coyote problem? My feeling at the time I was a little drunk, but I\n\n19:55.960 --> 20:02.280\nwas like, I thought I was like maybe like wear it. And like, it was based on a threat I had made to\n\n20:02.280 --> 20:08.280\nthe coyotes. While really drunk, like I did like a Kevin Spacey monologue to the coyotes for like\n\n20:08.280 --> 20:13.880\n20 minutes. So you verbally to coyotes in your backyard or just to the universe itself?\n\n20:13.880 --> 20:19.800\nLike, I did it under my breath, but in a way that if my neighbors wanted to listen, like,\n\n20:19.800 --> 20:23.960\nthey would be alarmed. So it was kind of a because I was clearly talking. It was a taxi\n\n20:23.960 --> 20:28.760\ndriver. You talk to me kind of thing. But I was like coyotes. Yeah, I was like projecting like\n\n20:28.760 --> 20:33.640\nthis. Like, I was like, because I just I was just finished shooting some slingshot like clay\n\n20:33.640 --> 20:38.840\nbiodegradable clay balls into the wait, these things are getting so aggressive. You've already\n\n20:38.840 --> 20:45.400\ninvested in anti coyote weaponry. Yeah. Yeah, I got like this crazy slingshot.\n\n20:45.400 --> 20:51.000\nRight. But it was like rocket kind of thing. But I still, you know, I was like saying, I shot it\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:56.680\nand like, like, you know, into the into the area. Are you shooting at actual animals that you saw?\n\n20:56.680 --> 21:02.840\nOr no, I mean, if I couldn't see them, but I wouldn't aim at them. I wouldn't be my objective\n\n21:02.840 --> 21:07.880\nto hit them. Because I don't think that would do any good. I would rather just be a nuisance to\n\n21:07.880 --> 21:11.960\nthem and scare them. And the concern would be that they're going to come and eat Nigel or what?\n\n21:11.960 --> 21:18.600\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah, eventually that they're because I feel like they're a they wouldn't be two feet\n\n21:18.600 --> 21:25.320\nfrom my back door. If they weren't already in some trouble, you know, so it's a it's a tragedy for\n\n21:25.320 --> 21:31.400\nthem. But they probably smell the pheromones or the dog food or whatever that they just know that\n\n21:31.400 --> 21:36.280\nthere's pets in the house. I know, but it's not like a natural, like, it's not like a natural\n\n21:36.280 --> 21:41.640\nthing for this is a recent thing. Again, going back to the fires that we had, and I think like\n\n21:41.640 --> 21:45.160\nthere was a big migration down, there's been like a lot of aggressive coyote stuff. And I'm just\n\n21:45.160 --> 21:50.200\nsaying, like, I have to imagine that all of these coyotes that are like so active in Los Filos\n\n21:50.200 --> 21:56.280\nright now, that they're they're up against it. And that and they're getting very aggressive. And\n\n21:56.280 --> 22:03.160\nwhat I worry about is a combination of their aggression. And like, if they're starving, like\n\n22:03.160 --> 22:09.480\nthem getting kind of loopy, or like, like a hat, like a, you know, like abandoned pups or whatever,\n\n22:09.480 --> 22:14.600\nlike, I don't want to know the shit's going to hit the fan if like some you've seen these like\n\n22:14.600 --> 22:21.560\ncrazy coyotes, like, broad daylight, like one that was just that's just like, yeah, Paul Ruston,\n\n22:21.560 --> 22:26.440\nLeslie Orphans, little dog got eaten, like, and I heard it happen. It was fucking nuts.\n\n22:26.440 --> 22:33.640\nJesus. Yeah, well, put a pin in that. That's awful. You heard it. Put a pin in that. And\n\n22:33.640 --> 22:38.920\ntheir other dog, which is a golden doodle like yours, like Harvey watched it happen. And they're\n\n22:38.920 --> 22:44.920\nlike, he was never the same again. Like he was fucking absolutely went insane by watching his\n\n22:44.920 --> 22:50.600\nlittle friend get murdered by a pack of coyotes. Because I mean, Harvey can't even handle watching\n\n22:50.600 --> 22:57.320\na fucking cartoon about a deer without losing his shit. Harvey just will walk in and he'll\n\n22:57.320 --> 23:00.920\nlay on his back and then pee on my shoe. Nah, come on. He doesn't pee that much.\n\n23:02.600 --> 23:10.680\nThe so yeah, I'm just worried happened once. That's enough. I am worried about a like juvenile\n\n23:10.680 --> 23:21.080\nhunger starved heat stroked, like, like fucking incel coyote, just like on a on a comp on a speed\n\n23:21.080 --> 23:27.560\nball high of nothing to lose. And he's riding a lime scooter. He's fucking coming down\n\n23:28.360 --> 23:32.360\nGriffith Park Boulevard. And he's pissed about the sesh wine sauce. He's like,\n\n23:33.800 --> 23:39.160\nand just like, like either like just just try just like going for broke. I mean, life finds away\n\n23:39.160 --> 23:43.560\nand like and like they're what I'm worried about is the failure of that plan even more than the\n\n23:43.560 --> 23:51.480\nsuccess of it that that like a injured kind of sick coyote landing in my yard and then needing\n\n23:51.480 --> 23:56.200\nhelp from other coyotes or just freaking out because it's like I'm trapped. It would be trapped\n\n23:56.200 --> 24:02.360\nin there. And if I was out, if I was out and it was like 3pm and the doggy door was unlocked and\n\n24:02.360 --> 24:09.640\nthere's a coyote trapped in my backyard, Nigel's a fucking idiot. Like he thinks that skunks are\n\n24:09.640 --> 24:15.800\nare party favors. Like he's just like, yay, free skunk candy. You know, like, has he been\n\n24:15.800 --> 24:24.040\nskunked a lot? Yeah, he got skunked like twice in the first like two weeks of my relationship\n\n24:24.040 --> 24:29.720\nwith Cody. Dogs don't learn about skunks. You'd think that once bitten twice shy, but they\n\n24:29.720 --> 24:34.600\nfucking don't. They just say, oh, skunk again. Harvey understands. Harvey's got the got the\n\n24:34.600 --> 24:41.000\nthe the whatever genes in him where he's like he hangs back 20 yards and barks and goes like skunk,\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:46.520\nskunk, skunk, skunk, skunk, skunk and Nigel's just like like a torpedo. And just and then he just\n\n24:46.520 --> 24:51.800\nlike but like if Nigel gets out of bed starts barking and running downstairs panic and run\n\n24:51.800 --> 24:56.280\nbecause last time that happened, I made it as far as the kitchen and he's coming back in the\n\n24:56.280 --> 25:04.280\ndoggie door going with like fucking mucus shooting out of his face and the whole house immediately\n\n25:04.280 --> 25:13.080\nsmelling like like not it does not smell as much like weed. No, it smells like like poison. Like\n\n25:13.080 --> 25:19.160\nI just got apparently explode on my doorstep one time. And my place like you couldn't even breathe\n\n25:19.160 --> 25:24.440\nin my place. It's in your shit forever. You have to throw away like like like even just curtains\n\n25:24.440 --> 25:29.720\nand stuff. It just gets in it. And there was at my new place. There was a family of skunks.\n\n25:30.360 --> 25:36.520\nThere was a mama and a papa and some babies and they're adorable. They're so cute. And we just\n\n25:36.520 --> 25:41.400\nstood there. I came home at like midnight or one a.m. And there was just a Mexican standoff.\n\n25:41.400 --> 25:47.080\nThey just stood in front of my door for a half hour. And I wasn't going anywhere. They weren't\n\n25:47.080 --> 25:54.040\ngoing anywhere. Yeah. What do you do? You can't shoot them off. I clap my hands. Yeah.\n\n25:56.280 --> 25:59.720\nIt usually makes them go away. Like I've had a couple of showdowns with a skunk where they're\n\n25:59.720 --> 26:11.000\nlike, I don't want to do this anymore than you do. I thought you're going to do a skunk clapping\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:16.760\nhandswrap. Oh, because clapping. I was like, what? I was trying to figure out what was awesome.\n\n26:19.800 --> 26:24.360\nThere was a skunk clapping handswrap. Did you guys see that Scotty Bowers documentary,\n\n26:24.360 --> 26:31.240\nthe secret Hollywood guy? Yeah, he feeds his skunks. These guys like he lives somewhere here\n\n26:31.240 --> 26:35.400\nand he like he puts out extra cat food for the skunks and they just come running right away.\n\n26:35.400 --> 26:38.840\nLike they're like they're just like waiting for him to put the food out and then they I mean\n\n26:38.840 --> 26:42.360\nthat's what it looks like in that documentary. I'm like, I wonder if that's do those skunks\n\n26:43.560 --> 26:48.200\nnot spray? They don't if they feel comfortable that they don't they don't like get up on your\n\n26:48.200 --> 26:52.760\nshit. But if a dog comes go like comes over and snarls at them, they're going to put their\n\n26:52.760 --> 26:57.320\nbutthole right on your face. And that's that's the end of that. So this is why I bring this up\n\n26:57.320 --> 27:01.400\nis because a couple of workouts ago, I'm talking about the coyote problem. And I'm like, okay,\n\n27:01.400 --> 27:05.960\nyeah, it's Spencer and Steve are ordering me like an airsoft gun or whatever. Like we're\n\n27:05.960 --> 27:10.760\nwe're getting equipment, you know, I just want to be as well scare these coyotes into having a\n\n27:10.760 --> 27:19.160\nlarger birth around my yard. And and then I got I got look, and I said in case anybody out there\n\n27:19.160 --> 27:24.600\nhas got their ears on to the live stream, and you're like, Oh, you just you want to be mean to\n\n27:24.600 --> 27:29.240\nanimals. What's what are they doing wrong? I was like, really, no, I've tried everything. I've tried,\n\n27:29.240 --> 27:34.520\nyou know, noise and don't tell me shake a coffee can at them with rocks and it like I've tried\n\n27:34.520 --> 27:38.680\neverything. They're getting really aggressive. They don't care anymore. And Dave Kline said,\n\n27:38.680 --> 27:45.880\nHave you tried praying? And I was like, you got me, though I have not tried praying. That's true.\n\n27:45.880 --> 27:51.320\nLike before I go up in my ghillie suit. And so then I did this thing where I'm like, because I'm\n\n27:51.320 --> 27:57.880\nlike, I look, I, you know, functionally, I may as well be an atheist in terms of like, I don't,\n\n27:57.880 --> 28:06.360\nI don't do nothing for no no deities. I don't I don't pay nothing forward. But but culturally,\n\n28:06.360 --> 28:13.320\nI don't know, psychologically, like, I'm, I'm like, I don't I, I, I, I'm, I'm panicking even\n\n28:13.320 --> 28:20.600\ntalking about it right now. Like I have this inborn, like Midwestern. If you blaspheme, like,\n\n28:20.600 --> 28:25.800\nyou're God's just gonna like, it is just just seize the opportunity to prove he exists just\n\n28:25.800 --> 28:32.440\nby fucking like taking one of your legs out. And, and so I was like, okay, if I'm doing this,\n\n28:32.440 --> 28:38.040\nI gotta be real serious about it. So I very sincerely, you know, I would have made it very\n\n28:38.040 --> 28:41.480\ncomplicated because I was like, no, I sound like a dick, like I'm like, you know, stuff. But I did\n\n28:41.480 --> 28:46.680\nwent through this like prayer, where I prayed for the coyotes to as a God take, you know,\n\n28:46.680 --> 28:54.600\nif you want, if you want to fill these coyotes hearts with the desire to relocate, whatever\n\n28:54.600 --> 28:58.760\nit is, like, like, don't don't smite them. If it's if it's a choice between doing nothing and\n\n28:58.760 --> 29:05.800\nsmiting, I'll deal with them. Like I don't want anything smitten for me. It's smote. So I don't\n\n29:05.800 --> 29:14.920\nwant, I don't want nothing smoke. Yo, don't be smote. But I'm smote. It might, it might\n\n29:18.680 --> 29:23.560\nwhy the ghillie suits? Why did you get a ghillie suit? It was part of the threat he made.\n\n29:23.560 --> 29:27.880\nYeah. Oh, right. Because I was talking to him Kevin Spacey style into the darkness. I was drunk\n\n29:27.880 --> 29:33.240\nand I was like in my underwear. And I was like, I was just like, I felt a little emasculated,\n\n29:33.240 --> 29:38.760\nwhich I can say here because they can't hear me. But like, I, I feel like it's all about like\n\n29:38.760 --> 29:44.920\nvibes and stuff, like communicate, like, like if I, I, I believe not with all animals, like,\n\n29:44.920 --> 29:51.000\nI don't think you can talk to a hamster just to do it. But I believe that it when it when it comes\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:57.720\nto when it's a real situation of, of animus, I guess you'd call it, right? Like when it's,\n\n29:57.720 --> 30:04.760\nwhen it's significant, when it's, when it's man versus beast on some level where it's like, okay,\n\n30:04.760 --> 30:09.960\nwell, we're neighbors now, you know, like in the old days, what it predates our memetic evolution\n\n30:09.960 --> 30:15.320\nand cuts right to the heart. Like we still have lizard brains. We still, we're still made of\n\n30:15.320 --> 30:20.840\nthe same carbon from the same stars as these little pieces of shit. Like why did you buy a\n\n30:20.840 --> 30:27.960\nghillie suit? Because I, because I told them I would, because I, and if I, and if I do, if I\n\n30:27.960 --> 30:32.680\nsay I'm going to do something, I said I'm coming up there. I said I'm ordering shit from Amazon\n\n30:32.680 --> 30:39.320\nand you got two weeks. Why, why dress like a bush? I just sneak up on a coyote who lives in\n\n30:39.320 --> 30:43.960\nbushes. You scared the shit out of them. No, they're more scared of human beings dressed like\n\n30:43.960 --> 30:48.200\nnot bushes. They're not, they're not scared enough of human beings. They need to think that I'm psycho.\n\n30:48.200 --> 30:54.040\nSo any question you have is a question that they'll have. A psycho bush and they're going to go,\n\n30:54.040 --> 30:57.240\noh, I'm going to pee on that bush. I'm going to fucking be friend. Oh, I hope so. Yeah. I hope\n\n30:57.240 --> 31:03.080\nthey pee on me. And then I'm going to go, yeah. And they're going to be like, what the fuck bite\n\n31:03.080 --> 31:12.120\nyou. I go, bite me. I'm a bush man. Like I just want him to be like, uh, not worth it. I was on\n\n31:12.120 --> 31:17.560\nthe road. I was on the road telling a series of fantastic dick jokes across the country. But I\n\n31:17.560 --> 31:22.680\nthink I saw a picture of you dressed up in a ghillie suit. Yeah. And I couldn't, for the life of\n\n31:22.680 --> 31:28.120\nme, try to reconstruct what the fucking purpose of that was. I worked out in it and it felt really\n\n31:28.120 --> 31:32.680\ngreat. Tony, did you put it on? Do you, do you roll around? I swear I could bench 20 more pounds\n\n31:32.680 --> 31:37.400\nwearing it because I felt like this like, do you, do you cruise around in your backyard at night\n\n31:37.400 --> 31:41.480\nand haunting coyotes in your ghillie suit? No, I haven't used it on them yet because as I told them,\n\n31:41.480 --> 31:51.960\nI said, I said, I said, I said to them, I said, I said, you guys can stay as quiet or as loud as\n\n31:51.960 --> 31:58.680\nyou want right now. You do whatever you want. Like this isn't, I've told you before to be quiet\n\n32:00.440 --> 32:04.520\nand you weren't right. So we're past that point. There's no credibility now.\n\n32:07.160 --> 32:10.760\nYeah. Politeness has gone out the window with you and these coyotes. I don't care.\n\n32:10.760 --> 32:14.520\nI feel, we're not playing games anymore. I'm not negotiating for fucking decibel.\n\n32:14.520 --> 32:18.360\nYou don't negotiate with coyotes. Oh, be quiet if I throw a rock. Oh, now you made\n\n32:18.360 --> 32:22.600\nmore noise. Now you made less. I'm telling you right now, too late. You may as well scream and\n\n32:22.600 --> 32:26.760\nshout or you may as well be quiet. Still won't save you because here's what's going to happen.\n\n32:27.400 --> 32:34.280\nI'm ordering a ladder from Amazon and when it comes, I'm climbing up over this wall and I'm\n\n32:34.280 --> 32:39.800\ncoming up there. What? Yeah. And to what end? What's the end game when you get up over the\n\n32:39.800 --> 32:45.800\nwall? I feel like, I feel like, I feel like the effectiveness of that statement is in the negative\n\n32:45.800 --> 32:56.440\nspace. Like, I want them to be going, why? What are you going to do? But I said, you don't understand\n\n32:56.440 --> 33:02.120\nhuman society and I don't understand coyotes society, but I will tell you right now, you are\n\n33:02.120 --> 33:09.720\ndealing with a man with unexpressed rage on a on a dead line. It seems like they and a budget you\n\n33:10.760 --> 33:14.600\nthey condition me. No, it seems like they keep pushing you. Well, they keep pushing me. Yeah,\n\n33:14.600 --> 33:20.840\nyeah, I think it seems like they drew first blood. I think they are right. Dan, this is them\n\n33:20.840 --> 33:25.000\nconditioning you. They've taught you to be a bush. Yeah, you just you just got that idea from me,\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:32.600\nMiss hearing Spencer. I got to say that I I thought I knew how to fight coyotes. Yeah, he was at\n\n33:32.600 --> 33:37.240\nWolves or coyotes, but I never imagined putting on a bush suit. This is next level. I was thinking\n\n33:37.240 --> 33:42.440\nabout getting coyote urine and put and putting coyote urine on the suit to like just just just\n\n33:42.440 --> 33:50.040\nthen you hit them with your like contrary action. You know, I missed I missed the wolf urine show.\n\n33:50.040 --> 33:55.480\nTell me in a sentence or two what the point of the year and colon they hate that wolves are like\n\n33:55.480 --> 34:01.080\nwell coyotes are afraid of wolves unless they're having sex with them. But that's that's genus\n\n34:01.080 --> 34:08.200\ncanis for you. They're they're either they're either breeding or eating each other. But the\n\n34:08.200 --> 34:13.400\nthe so so here's the thing that I just don't see the point of dressing up like a bush to fight a\n\n34:13.400 --> 34:17.960\ncoyote because like you don't you want to be more course you don't more of a threat to them\n\n34:17.960 --> 34:25.080\nand look no I want I know I want to traumatize them mentally. Do you think coyotes have that\n\n34:25.080 --> 34:30.600\nsort of mental capacity to remember things because I think if it's a shock to their system and I'm\n\n34:30.600 --> 34:37.000\nnot allowed to do that to them physically I can't and I wouldn't want to but like I said they're\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:44.600\nstruggling like it's like you know but they come down my street like like Waverly they come down\n\n34:44.600 --> 34:50.280\nand they come down Griffith Park and Waverly and they silently like wraiths they just come down\n\n34:50.920 --> 34:54.600\nand they walk down the street and they're looking around and they kind of hoot to each other\n\n34:55.400 --> 34:59.960\nand they're all looking around and they all go into somebody's backyard and eat somebody's little\n\n34:59.960 --> 35:05.640\ndog or cat. I'll tell you what man and it's fucking gnarly and you see people you wake up and you\n\n35:05.640 --> 35:11.240\nhear the screaming of the animal dying and then you hear the screaming of the owner of the animal\n\n35:11.240 --> 35:18.120\ncoming out and they're underwear throwing like hairbrushes and shoes at them and scaring them off\n\n35:18.120 --> 35:23.320\nas they as they're devouring their little precious animal. It's not happening. If I can talk to Paul\n\n35:23.320 --> 35:29.080\nReston Leslie Arfun about their dog dying it's fucking really gruesome. So here's the thing though\n\n35:29.080 --> 35:35.560\nwe're living in an extraordinary times you know like this is not normal shit like the night that\n\n35:35.560 --> 35:42.200\nI did my monologue like it was like your monologue to the coyotes in your underwear. Yeah it was\n\n35:42.200 --> 35:48.440\nlike the purge anarchy like like there was like there was a coyote and like right up on my shit\n\n35:48.440 --> 35:54.440\ngoing like aye aye aye aye aye and and but then like it was doing it because in the distance when\n\n35:54.440 --> 36:01.640\nit would shut up and you would hear in the far distance like miles away just this army it was\n\n36:01.640 --> 36:09.240\njust like and I was like these fuckers think that they're gonna keep like pushing like they think\n\n36:09.240 --> 36:14.600\nthat the were in the end days they could probably smell that we are they're like they think they\n\n36:14.600 --> 36:20.040\nprobably like they hear us talking about Trump in our bedrooms and they're like sounds like it's\n\n36:20.040 --> 36:27.000\ncoyote time sounds like we've entered the era of coyotes like I might I might invent a lever\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:33.400\nnext week I might start I might be the Archimedes of coyotes I won't know unless I get lots of\n\n36:33.400 --> 36:41.000\nprotein in me anyways so so so I so I said to the coyotes that night because it was like hearing\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:46.600\nthis shit in the distance and I'm like I was like I just I knew I had to like put on a strong face\n\n36:47.160 --> 36:52.120\nand be like I just I just I just you know just like kind of counterintuitive I was just like\n\n36:52.120 --> 36:57.880\nI'm glad you're quiet now I hope you're quiet forever because but it doesn't matter because\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:04.040\nlike I'm getting a ladder from Amazon and I'm coming up here. Is Harmontown gonna be about\n\n37:04.040 --> 37:08.040\ncanine predators for the rest of time now because we got wolf urine and we got coyotes?\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:13.640\nWell I don't know we could get through it if you I mean like look I had this I had one thing to\n\n37:13.640 --> 37:18.840\nsay about this which was that during my workout then I said I was explaining all this to Dave\n\n37:18.840 --> 37:23.800\nKlein Dave Kline says have you tried praying I prayed so look what I said in my prayer also is\n\n37:23.800 --> 37:32.280\nlike look God you know obviously if the coyotes don't come back not that that not that there needs\n\n37:32.280 --> 37:39.480\nto be anything in this for you but if the coyotes just disappear now you know I'm gonna tell the\n\n37:39.480 --> 37:45.080\nstory I'm not gonna leave you out I'm not gonna like whitewash like I'm not gonna be like oh\n\n37:45.080 --> 37:50.840\nyou know like I'm and I know and I don't I don't mean I know you like that PR you like that you\n\n37:50.840 --> 37:56.840\nlike that acknowledgement you know I don't know you don't thrive on it but I will I would I promise\n\n37:56.840 --> 38:02.120\nI will tell people I prayed for the coyotes to go away and then they went away that'll be my story\n\n38:02.120 --> 38:08.200\nand I sit here tonight to tell you like I haven't heard the fucking coyotes since I prayed for them\n\n38:08.200 --> 38:18.440\nto go away oh shit I now now now some some of you the atheist people fans it's okay that's all right\n\n38:18.440 --> 38:23.320\nI love atheists we need them we need skeptics we need we need them more than than than than ever\n\n38:25.720 --> 38:31.960\nyou guys can just assume that it was the Kevin Spacey monologue because I told them I said I\n\n38:31.960 --> 38:38.120\nsaid get your shit I said I said look it doesn't matter coming up from what from from house of car\n\n38:38.120 --> 38:44.600\nfrom our commercials from his uh from his christmas christmas apron video on youtube\n\n38:48.040 --> 38:52.840\nwas that brendan I was pretty fucked up I got in the plane today from Boston back to LA and the\n\n38:52.840 --> 38:58.040\nthe first thing I saw was that Notre Dame was on fire in Paris that really bummed me out oh no oh\n\n38:58.040 --> 39:06.760\nyeah what happened what are nazis no I think so but no it's saying that yet just back I don't\n\n39:06.760 --> 39:11.720\nthink that the the the verdict is in on what happened right they might they were doing reconstruction\n\n39:11.720 --> 39:16.600\non it and it might have been just like a construction accident the actual church yeah there's a whole\n\n39:16.600 --> 39:23.800\nroof fell in the main spiral that was built like in 1840 or something that all fell in most of the\n\n39:23.800 --> 39:29.240\nsuperstructure in stone and the bell towers stayed up but there was a very big chance that all the\n\n39:29.240 --> 39:34.520\nbells were going to fucking fall down and kill everybody the firefighters in there but uh friends\n\n39:34.520 --> 39:38.680\nof ours uh like church has friends and I have friends that would like live right across the\n\n39:38.680 --> 39:45.000\ndescend from it and watch the whole thing catch on fire and there was people singing Ave Maria and\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:50.360\nFrench and it was or maybe Latin I don't know absolutely beautiful and I don't think you have\n\n39:50.360 --> 39:59.480\nto be religious to be really struck by the fact that uh and nearly what 900 year old building is\n\n39:59.480 --> 40:05.960\njust fucking in a towering inferno and the whole roof fell in it's really it was really gruesome\n\n40:05.960 --> 40:12.920\nand it was uh it put me in a pretty bad mood and I hope that uh they can rebuild it and make it good\n\n40:12.920 --> 40:20.280\nsome very rich Frenchman uh businessman said he's going to give like a like a 100 million euro\n\n40:20.280 --> 40:27.960\njust to start the uh the rebuild on it which is better yeah no shit and then and then a friend of\n\n40:27.960 --> 40:33.240\nmine uh Brian who's a very good friend he made like the joke because I posted a picture of me\n\n40:33.240 --> 40:39.000\nthat I took in front of the Notre Dame like maybe like three four years ago and he's like oh yeah\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:43.800\nyeah let's let's let's make sure that I don't have a picture of myself in front of Notre Dame so I\n\n40:43.800 --> 40:47.800\nguess I can't make it about me and I was like I don't think it's making about you I don't think\n\n40:47.800 --> 40:52.760\nit's vanity I think that's just grief and we had a very very good conversation about that I think\n\n40:52.760 --> 40:59.000\nsocial media does want you to make things about yourself or like we just are a pair of kids pecking\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:03.960\nat our own reflection and stuff but I think to have visited Notre Dame and to be sad that the\n\n41:03.960 --> 41:11.480\nthing is fucking on fire um isn't vanity I think that's uh I think that's an expression of grief\n\n41:11.480 --> 41:20.600\nabout watching one of uh the world's great pieces of architecture die in front of us and uh I don't\n\n41:20.600 --> 41:27.880\nknow they may be very depressed in Notre Dame in in in the in the states and uh was it Indiana\n\n41:27.880 --> 41:34.040\nwhere is it university or something where's where's Notre Dame and oh it's just a college I think it's not a city is Indiana\n\n41:34.040 --> 41:40.120\nwhere is it south bend indiana yeah but there's no city it's just the name of the the it's Notre\n\n41:40.120 --> 41:45.080\nDame de Paris it's uh it's the it's the Our Lady of Paris and that's the big church on the uh was it\n\n41:45.080 --> 41:50.840\nthe oldest city whatever like right right on the island of uh in the middle of the Seine River\n\n41:51.560 --> 41:57.240\nand it's right in the heart of France and it's probably the most iconic church uh ever I would\n\n41:57.240 --> 42:01.720\nhave been less upset if the Sistine Chapel burned down than the fucking uh Notre Dame that's it's\n\n42:01.720 --> 42:11.080\nwhoa shots fired hot takes shots fired yeah there's a friends of mine like that live right by it\n\n42:11.080 --> 42:15.400\nthere's just pictures of just smoke and then there's people that were up in Montmartre and uh like the\n\n42:15.400 --> 42:20.920\nsoccer court like you're looking down on Paris and you just see in the middle of Paris the most famous\n\n42:20.920 --> 42:30.200\nthing in the world just raging in fire um it uh it really really affected me it made me really\n\n42:30.200 --> 42:35.080\nreally sad so supposedly the bells are still standing and they they've saved the towers and\n\n42:35.080 --> 42:42.440\nwhatnot but they're gonna have to rebuild it they gotta they've done it they'll do it\n\n42:42.440 --> 42:50.760\nI haven't seen uh Game of Thrones yet oh boy that's a good segue\n\n42:55.720 --> 42:59.240\nyeah also didn't Jackie Robinson turn 100 today if he was still alive\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:06.680\nthere's a whole lot of shit going on today man it's a it's a it's emotionally charged\n\n43:06.680 --> 43:11.480\nI haven't seen it either I also I got a new receiver from Direct TV and I don't think I have\n\n43:11.480 --> 43:17.000\nmy shit set to record Game of Thrones so I might have to go back there and fucking have to sneak\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:23.160\nI wanted to watch that Scotty Bowers documentary so I went to Apple TV and then and then I went to\n\n43:23.160 --> 43:29.880\nand then that took me to Amazon and then Amazon told me I had to get stars through Amazon and then\n\n43:29.880 --> 43:38.760\nstars said uh hey do you want to uh after your free trial do you want to get charged monthly\n\n43:38.760 --> 43:48.040\nor yearly if you get charged yearly you save 50% for only $79 a year for stars and I was like\n\n43:50.360 --> 43:57.000\nso I paid like 80 bucks for a movie about a guy that was gay with Spencer Tracy like I'll never\n\n43:57.000 --> 44:01.960\nwhat am I gonna browse stars what's wrong with me I don't know I guess I'd be like what's wrong\n\n44:01.960 --> 44:10.680\nwith me even more though if I did the monthly thing because I'm saving 70 bucks right I don't know\n\n44:10.680 --> 44:17.080\nso Jackie Robinson was a uh african-american ballplayer who is sorry that's a real interesting\n\n44:17.080 --> 44:24.760\ndocumentary I would I would I would I would recommend for people very very very uh ambient I\n\n44:24.760 --> 44:28.520\ndon't know it's not like it's got it's not like a big roller coaster ride like oh my god I can't\n\n44:28.520 --> 44:32.120\nbelieve this happened but it's just like an interesting portrait what's the one I was just\n\n44:32.120 --> 44:38.440\nI heard about today that's there's a documentary about a dude that free climbed uh all capitan\n\n44:38.440 --> 44:45.160\nin Yosemite or something what's it called free solo that's supposed to be fucking crazy right\n\n44:45.160 --> 44:52.920\nis it good yeah we got we got four Yaz hell yeah and all of his friends are dead right because\n\n44:52.920 --> 44:58.840\neverybody that tries to do that fucking dies don't fucking do that I watch that uh you guys\n\n44:58.840 --> 45:07.720\nwatch I harness it when I go down staircases you know I have serious uh acrophobia which I think\n\n45:07.720 --> 45:13.080\nthat's what that's what it is it's fair heights right it'll be acrophobia like Cody and I are\n\n45:13.080 --> 45:19.880\nlooking at houses and I there was a house I looked at we were never gonna get it but like it was like\n\n45:19.880 --> 45:25.560\nit just had this balcony it was like I couldn't go out on it I mean I could but I was like I\n\n45:25.560 --> 45:29.800\ncan't live I couldn't live here I never occurred to me like I've been in hotels you know all the\n\n45:29.800 --> 45:37.560\ntime you're in a hotel I'm like I can't like I don't know I I I I wonder where I am on the you\n\n45:37.560 --> 45:43.400\nknow ordinary meter of like people that can't like last uh New Year's eve or the one before\n\n45:43.400 --> 45:47.400\nwe sing the microveloz thing we were we were on a very precipitous balcony the whole time on that\n\n45:47.400 --> 45:54.520\none yeah when I go up to a balcony balcony like that like my legs get numb I'm seized with what\n\n45:54.520 --> 45:59.960\nI've read is described I did I couldn't put words onto it before I read it in this like\n\n45:59.960 --> 46:06.120\ncoffee table book about phobias but it's it talked about how people are people with this phobia\n\n46:06.120 --> 46:12.840\nare particularly disturbed by what they describe as a as a as a as a as a uncontrollable thought\n\n46:12.840 --> 46:18.200\nabout jumping yeah because I think your brain is just running through the fear of heights I say\n\n46:18.200 --> 46:23.240\nis not so much a fear of falling as a fear of jumping yeah but it's also like like I notice\n\n46:23.240 --> 46:28.760\nlike if I'm holding an object or if anyone around me is holding an object like I can't stand watching\n\n46:28.760 --> 46:34.760\nCody with the like that New Year's where Cody's just like you know hi and she's got like the like\n\n46:34.760 --> 46:40.200\nwhether it's a whether it's a phone or a glass I'm just like the thought of this thing like like\n\n46:40.200 --> 46:46.520\ndropping yeah like it freaks me out yeah I think it's like I think I think the I don't know I've\n\n46:46.520 --> 46:51.800\nread or something that the idea is it's like your brain is kind of doing flash cards or it's like\n\n46:51.800 --> 46:57.480\nwhat if I jump no bad that would be bad what if I grab this cop's gun no that would be bad what if\n\n46:57.480 --> 47:02.200\nI like did a sandwich or something that'd be fine you know but it's just like it's just the brain\n\n47:02.200 --> 47:07.960\nis kind of reinforcing the negative mental and emotional what if you're on a balcony with a\n\n47:07.960 --> 47:13.240\ncop what if you're on a balcony with a cop grab their gun and just jumped off that'd be great\n\n47:13.240 --> 47:17.560\nand then they're like he didn't why don't you be an absolute legend my man yeah\n\n47:20.920 --> 47:25.960\nthey'd call you Hans Gruber but yeah I get it the most with phones I'm just always imagining\n\n47:25.960 --> 47:30.680\nlike dropping the last phones off bridges or opening up the hotel of a window of a hotel just\n\n47:30.680 --> 47:36.840\nto drop my phone out and I'm like this is bad I gotta get out of here like I do a lot of shows\n\n47:36.840 --> 47:41.160\nin the Bay Area and so we're constantly going back and forth across the Golden Gate where\n\n47:41.160 --> 47:46.920\npeople kill themselves all the time and I'm fascinated by I had a cousin who did that huh\n\n47:46.920 --> 47:51.720\nI

parking lot it is so goofy it is the goofiest movie I've ever seen no not really\n\n51:42.040 --> 51:48.280\nI've seen goofier movies surely I don't know I can't name any offhand my brain is with cheese but\n\n51:48.280 --> 51:54.600\nit was just such a goofy movie there are these there's like there's like uh is it a comedy uh no\n\n51:54.600 --> 51:59.800\nI mean not not not not not not my purpose yeah it wasn't trying to be funny I mean there was\n\n51:59.800 --> 52:03.800\nprobably a moment or two and I was like oh and then this will be funny I didn't notice that but but\n\n52:04.760 --> 52:11.000\nit was just like uh are these in theaters or where are these from yeah this is uh you can\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:16.360\nyou can watch this now on their streaming services I don't I don't based on your description I have\n\n52:16.360 --> 52:21.320\nno desire to watch these at all no you wouldn't want to watch this movie right I was just checking\n\n52:21.320 --> 52:29.400\nwith the kids I mean I know they're they love the Shimali on the Shimali oh that's a Shimali on\n\n52:29.400 --> 52:37.480\nShimali on that's a Shimali on yeah did you know that M night Shimali on is uh actually um\n\n52:37.480 --> 52:52.360\num he's uh the brother of a more beloved uh director named M night uh Gamalian and like his\n\n52:52.360 --> 52:57.320\nhis mom it doesn't make sense because you don't have different last names you might\n\n52:59.080 --> 53:04.600\nwhat if he had a different dad it's dumb I don't know you know it's just like oh Gamalian and then\n\n53:04.600 --> 53:10.360\nGamalian died in a uh uh but oh wait no wait what am I see that wouldn't make sense well then\n\n53:10.360 --> 53:14.360\nthen she just calls him Shimali on because it's like it's like calling the uh creative arts Emmys\n\n53:14.360 --> 53:20.440\nthe Shmemys you know it's like ah Shimali on you know like you're no you're no you're no Gamalian\n\n53:21.400 --> 53:27.720\nGamalian Shimali on you know he's got to live with that is that how you say his name Shimali\n\n53:27.720 --> 53:32.200\nthat's how I say it I'm sure it's not how like yeah you say bag also we don't know what he knows\n\n53:32.200 --> 53:38.840\nI don't have the energy for you your hair is looking very good right now you got this kind of\n\n53:39.880 --> 53:48.840\nkind of uh deadliest catch kind of uh captain of a vessel flattery will get you everywhere\n\n53:50.360 --> 53:53.160\nthe the burying sea gives up its great haircuts\n\n53:53.160 --> 54:00.520\nuh what's your secret what's your secret how do you keep your hair so soft and manageable\n\n54:04.440 --> 54:10.760\nI mean so I don't know so Cody kind of curates the Asperger detective episodes but okay this\n\n54:10.760 --> 54:16.840\nmotherfucker has been killing it this motherfucker I don't I don't know if I'm hearing about an\n\n54:16.840 --> 54:21.960\norder are you listening to the patreon episodes that could be maybe she subscribed to the patreon\n\n54:21.960 --> 54:26.840\nbut dude he went off on this thing what's actually called it's not called asperger it's called\n\n54:26.840 --> 54:34.600\ncold case murder mysteries murder mysteries uh I want to say his name is Ryan Kraus it is okay\n\n54:35.560 --> 54:40.760\nI mean he's like first of all he did I I don't know if he did it recently or if it was just there\n\n54:40.760 --> 54:50.120\nand I didn't know it but he did he did my the the uh Kanika Powell uh mystery like which is that\n\n54:50.120 --> 54:54.520\nthat young lady that I talked about who uh you know when we had the red-handed girls on\n\n54:54.520 --> 54:59.960\nand I was saying like I don't understand why uh why this thing you know it's just like so crazy\n\n54:59.960 --> 55:04.680\nthat she was you know these more than one guy it was like trying to kill her and just kill\n\n55:04.680 --> 55:11.320\nbut he he really like laid it to rest for me what did he say he he he pinned it on this like\n\n55:11.320 --> 55:19.160\nguy that was active at that time before going to jail and he was like a sloppy pseudo serial killer\n\n55:19.160 --> 55:25.480\nwho did run with a gang who kind of like had people doing his bidding and he was a ups guy that was\n\n55:25.480 --> 55:31.400\nlike he was he frequently used friends to do like these hold up jobs where they'd pretend\n\n55:31.400 --> 55:34.760\nthey're to deliver a package and then go on the thing and like all this stuff and he was doing\n\n55:34.760 --> 55:42.520\nlike rapes and murders weren't be weren't weren't to be on him and um he he he he ended up in prison\n\n55:42.520 --> 55:47.080\nsometime after this happened but he was just like it's that guy and he didn't get caught for that\n\n55:47.080 --> 55:51.160\nand then he went to prison for other shit and he's in prison now and I was like oh that makes me feel\n\n55:51.160 --> 55:56.600\nbetter yeah because because it just seemed like and also it was like the thing the key thing about\n\n55:56.600 --> 56:02.040\nit was that the thing that was scary to me was that the end of the story is that she comes home\n\n56:02.040 --> 56:06.680\nfrom doing her errands and whoever was trying to get into her apartment all of a sudden shoots her\n\n56:07.320 --> 56:16.280\nin her apartment building's vestibule and just runs away but it's like oh no but he this is a\n\n56:16.280 --> 56:22.200\nperson that's really stupid and that spent weeks trying to get into her apartment and it was is\n\n56:22.200 --> 56:26.360\nlike very clear from the behaviors he kind of laid it out he's like you know this person wanted in\n\n56:26.360 --> 56:32.600\nher apartment and used all the dumbest ways to try to get into her apartment and then out of\n\n56:33.160 --> 56:38.760\nabsolute frustration just like waited there and probably pulled a gun on her as she came home\n\n56:38.760 --> 56:44.840\nand she was military and savvy and was no way she was going to comply and and and then there was a\n\n56:44.840 --> 56:50.360\nstruggle or something and just she started screaming and he couldn't control the situation so he shot\n\n56:50.360 --> 56:54.920\nher so she couldn't be a witness and ran off and that's why it was like but that that's the thing\n\n56:54.920 --> 57:00.520\nthat was really freaking me up because it made it's like well if it wasn't about uh assaulting her\n\n57:00.520 --> 57:05.800\nand it wasn't about robbing her it was like like this this whole thing was a coordinated attempt\n\n57:05.800 --> 57:11.960\nto kill one woman and no one's investigating it and but it was like now it was a sloppy it was\n\n57:11.960 --> 57:17.320\njust it was it was the same kind of criminal that we're all in danger of all the time like\n\n57:17.320 --> 57:23.080\nit's just i was able to file it now thank you asperger detective he's great he is it normal for\n\n57:23.080 --> 57:29.000\nfor the this true crime stuff for a guy to have just like a really concrete laid out theory that\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:33.800\nhe supports with several you know i don't know i mean he's like colombo that's what's cool about\n\n57:33.800 --> 57:37.160\nit is because like i don't really like true crime but necessarily i mean i don't hate it or whatever\n\n57:37.160 --> 57:42.040\ni just don't engage in a lot but like he's just like you know he's like here's the crime and here's\n\n57:42.040 --> 57:47.320\nwhy this person did it who's who's not proven guilty but i'm just going out on a limb and saying i\n\n57:47.320 --> 57:51.800\nbelieve in it and it's just crazy because it's like i don't know if he's right or whatever and\n\n57:51.800 --> 57:56.280\nsometimes you don't know if he's right but other times it's just like oh man this guy's just like\n\n57:56.280 --> 58:00.200\nthey should give him a medal or something definitely look these people up but you know i don't\n\n58:00.200 --> 58:04.520\nthink a lot of them you know anyway it's just very interesting then he also does these like little\n\n58:04.520 --> 58:09.560\nlittle things once in a while and like you said sometimes he does it badly aggravatingly or\n\n58:09.560 --> 58:15.960\nmysteriously but then then boy i heard a couple where he is like nailing it and one of them was\n\n58:15.960 --> 58:23.000\nlike the kessie kessie uh last name kessie i think that was like this this woman who stabbed her\n\n58:23.000 --> 58:29.240\nkids and then tried to pretend like someone came in her house and did it and um and he just at the\n\n58:29.240 --> 58:37.480\nend of his uh at the end of some of his episodes he just goes and that's about it and that's why\n\n58:37.480 --> 58:44.040\nshe stabbed her two children but the reason why she did that is because of the same reason\n\n58:44.040 --> 58:52.360\nwe do anything right because she's afraid afraid of dying afraid of being alone she can't stand\n\n58:52.360 --> 58:58.440\nthe idea that her few stolen moments on this planet are precursors to an infinity of darkness\n\n58:58.440 --> 59:05.240\nafter gaining only a brief glimpse of temporary fleeting light she's worried she's a sentient\n\n59:05.240 --> 59:11.480\nmammal like the rest of us she doesn't know should she lose weight should she gain weight is she\n\n59:11.480 --> 59:17.400\ndoing it wrong did she get the right car he'll do like these crazy like george carlin meets bukowski\n\n59:17.400 --> 59:24.200\nlike fucking henry miller like uh monologues that aren't really that forced he's like really like\n\n59:24.200 --> 59:31.400\ni'm like go aspie beat poet like he he he he really he really he's really does it right i mean it's\n\n59:31.400 --> 59:38.280\nburger detective um i i almost woke cody up i'm like you gotta you gotta rewind and listen to\n\n59:38.280 --> 59:43.960\nthis guy he's like laying it down really laid it down so you have a dan you have a ghillie suit at\n\n59:43.960 --> 59:50.360\nyour house currently right now is it like in the closet is it on the floor is it in a case like\n\n59:50.360 --> 59:55.640\nwhere is it currently existing right now well it's probably just strewn about the bedroom\n\n59:55.640 --> 01:00:01.240\nbecause when cody saw me in it you know no it's like laying did you have sniper sex that you\n\n01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:08.360\ndid you do a sniper sex no i uh it's probably laying on the uh living room coffee table right\n\n01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:14.680\nand you you've worn it you've you've strode about in it you've been outside and you've you've communed\n\n01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:19.880\nwith the coyotes no i haven't i'm not yet he doesn't have a ladder yet no you gotta get that ladder\n\n01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:27.400\nyeah you you went for the ghillie suit before you got ladder ghillie suit came first i don't know why\n\n01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:33.000\ni got a ladder if you want to borrow it i actually didn't order mine yet oh shit it's\n\n01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.520\nkind of bluffing them coyotes that's probably good can we do a show where you come out in the ghillie\n\n01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:47.560\nsuit yeah i mean maybe but i guess a proper ghillie suit you'd have to dress up like the dan\n\n01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:51.400\nas you type right you'd have to wear like mahogany and have a candle on your head and stuff like that\n\n01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:57.720\nlike you'd want to camouflage yourself based on your surroundings yeah i mean right like a big\n\n01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:10.840\narm war but who cares you know oh dan wore something stupid i've been this this asperger\n\n01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:15.880\ndetectors have been blowing my mind because like you said he does these wrapy up things that are\n\n01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:21.960\nlike about themes and stuff and it's like it's been like church or something it's made me realize\n\n01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:28.600\ni was like oh man i'm afraid to ask for thanks and i'm like i gotta ask for stuff more and i've been\n\n01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:33.640\nanalyzing my life oh man it feels good there was something that he did a little bit where i was i got\n\n01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:39.080\na little inspiration from it too i was i wonder if it was the same thing ask for what spencer\n\n01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:44.920\nask for stuff like for instance like stuff you need you know how people are like oh let me ask\n\n01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:51.080\nfor help or ask for stuff i don't do that i was thinking about it was it's one of the things that\n\n01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:58.360\ndrives myself hatred you know um there's a there's a podcast called i think small town dicks um\n\n01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:05.240\nand it's uh i'm interested my favorite billy joe song it's a it's a real pro one it's a\n\n01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:12.200\nyardley smith is that the uh lisa simpson yeah i think it's pronounced yardley no i don't know\n\n01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:22.200\nyeah uh and um uh her friend and then they have these two detectives and uh it's really well done\n\n01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:28.280\nit's like a higher-end true crime podcast well produced and um but uh they had an episode where\n\n01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:39.000\nyardley uh told these the stories about her as a victim uh um and uh there was a couple of them and\n\n01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:45.720\nthen there was one for dessert that was like just insane it was like the the the behavior of the\n\n01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:51.720\nperson trying to victimize her was insane but then it was almost it was almost the profound thing\n\n01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:59.960\nabout it was how how insane she felt as a victim like how she she just she's describing this crazy\n\n01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:03.320\nbehavior in the part of this guy that was doing work on her house and she started running all this\n\n01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:09.080\nlike crazy shit on her and um and you know it's fun it's like i i have i feel like i've noticed\n\n01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:18.760\nit's like if you picture uh yard yardley uh uh smith as a as an actor she she um she was she\n\n01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:25.080\nwasn't always just the voice of of lisa simpson like she's she's she's she appears in tv shows and\n\n01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:31.640\nstuff and she was uh having kind of a heyday in the 90s and she's she's a very small like kind of\n\n01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:39.000\nadorable sort of like like unassuming like everything about her face kind of kind of\n\n01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:47.480\ntransmits this sort of like uh uh like i don't know unassuming or something energy something\n\n01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:54.680\nlike it and it's interesting because i've heard from from women before like like women there's\n\n01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:59.480\ncertain kinds of like women who are like like like i i have this like kind of thing about me\n\n01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:06.760\nwhere guys like they smell something on me and they're like coming after me because they're like\n\n01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:11.400\nit's like i have this like victim target on my head or something she didn't say anything like\n\n01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:15.480\nthat but it was like it occurred to me while listening to these stories i was like i like i\n\n01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:20.680\nbet it's not just because she's famous but like it is because it's because like there's certain\n\n01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:28.040\npeople that like they just um i i think like like predators are just like oh yeah i don't know if it's\n\n01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:32.200\nlike they they if they know it's easy prey because it's like it's also it's guys like stalking like\n\n01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:37.960\nfalling in love not just like oh she's an easy target it's more like oh i'm in love i'm in love\n\n01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:43.320\nyeah i'm just walking with certain people and then like people just yell at them like and it's like\n\n01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:49.000\ni've never experienced this in my life but it's just like people seek them out and like are comfortable\n\n01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.560\nthrowing shit at them for whatever reason i i don't know if it's a like yeah like a predator\n\n01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:59.720\nsense or something um yeah and i kind of like it was crazy like like like this actor is telling\n\n01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:05.240\nthis story about this just absolute batshit psycho guy that's like do it work on our house and he's\n\n01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:11.960\nlike ramping up the uh the stuff and she keeps she keeps talking about these these these crazy\n\n01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:16.360\npoints where you're listening to the story and and her friend is listening to the story and saying\n\n01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:21.960\nlike okay so at this point like you did you think about telling anybody about this like crazy thing\n\n01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:29.240\nthat was happening to you and uh and and she always had this reason why no no not at that time or\n\n01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:35.480\nthing she wasn't being dodgy about it but it kind of built to this moment where she she i mean she's\n\n01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:40.920\nbeen through this and figured this all out by now this is decades ago but it was like she the reason\n\n01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:47.720\nshe came to la to be an actor as this tiny person that that that you know isn't necessarily she didn't\n\n01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:51.640\nlook like Farrah Fawcett she was like i'm gonna go eat the world because i'm entitled to it because\n\n01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:57.400\nof my stature or my whatever it's like there's this like the the culture of her family and her\n\n01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:02.440\npsychology in her head was like i gotta own my ambition and i'm gonna go out there and i'm gonna\n\n01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:07.320\ndo this thing and then it's like a very healthy thing like oh own your dreams and visualize your\n\n01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:13.320\nsuccess and all that stuff and that uh but it comes with this other thing that she's she's getting\n\n01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:19.160\nvictimized by these like crazy stalker guys and she's not telling anybody like and it's it's like\n\n01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:26.040\nso far beyond points like red flags where where you know she like anyone else might have gotten\n\n01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:30.280\nkilled you just don't know and then but and then she kind of got she got choked up toward the end\n\n01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:35.960\nbecause she finally got to a point with this guy where she's simply this guy came over to her house\n\n01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:40.840\nthat was doing work and he had he explained to her that he had just killed two people for her\n\n01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:45.480\nbecause they had been following her and he was like laying this whole thing on her and i need\n\n01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:53.560\n25 000 or just this crazy like weird psycho shakedown and uh and then she just kept letting it go\n\n01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:58.360\nshe still didn't go to anybody and then she describes the moment where she finally she just\n\n01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:05.640\nruns out of her house and she goes and calls this guy that worked at the studio the fox lot\n\n01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:11.720\nprobably for um for help and she starts like breaking while she's telling the story because\n\n01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:18.680\nthat's that's the thing that got to her was that she finally had to explain to this guy like this\n\n01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:24.840\nis what's been going on and i like like and you could hear in her voice it's like like like oh\n\n01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:29.960\nthis is the moment of my weakness where i have to tell somebody that i let this get this far and\n\n01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:36.200\nthat i finally need help with it or something and it was just such an interesting that that that\n\n01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:44.120\nthat other side of uh of confidence and ambition and autonomy like you could be you you might be\n\n01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:52.360\nwithout knowing it like um pathologically incapable of of of telling somebody you need help um and i\n\n01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:57.800\nthought i wondered that's what i meant i was like jeez i wonder if i'm that way no if i if\n\n01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:03.080\nsomeone goes wrong in my life if i could smear it all over everyone i find that i i can ask people\n\n01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:07.960\nfor things that in a workplace context but outside of that i have a very rough time like\n\n01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:12.440\nburdening my friends with a request or like i always feel like it's burning but it's just like\n\n01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:17.080\nhey you want to get a sandwich it's like not you know it's not trying to take anything but it feels\n\n01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:24.600\nweird to me but it might be a similar thing who knows yeah sorry no i there was nothing i thought\n\n01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:29.400\nthat i was just i just i couldn't believe that story i was i was really taken by it she is like\n\n01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:37.960\nlike this uh she she she seems like such a um such a remarkable character i like because she\n\n01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:43.320\nshe's like i really like that podcast because they're very they're very like um kind of dug dug\n\n01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:48.680\ndown into the into their little true crime stories and it's it feels it feels less uh ghoulish because\n\n01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:53.000\nthey're talking to detectives so they're the detectives walking them through little cases that\n\n01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:02.120\nthey have uh a lot of victim blaming a lot of parent blaming like that there was like uh like uh\n\n01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:07.800\nthere was a there was this like uh sex crime thing what the fuck was it it was like\n\n01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:15.400\ni just remember one of the detectives explaining this made me this put me off having kids forever\n\n01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:19.880\ni'm not doing it anymore like i haven't told cody i made the permanent decision but he was he was\n\n01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:25.800\nlike he was like look your kids got an iphone you need to go through that thing or whatever\n\n01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:31.400\nthey're up to it's on you i was like i'm not going through my kids phone if they're like\n\n01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:35.960\nand you can't keep your kid from having a phone they're like like like you're like until the kids\n\n01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:40.840\n18 and they're living with you it's your responsibility as a parent modern parenting you\n\n01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:45.800\nyou got to go through their phone and make sure that they're you know you got to check up on them\n\n01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:50.680\nthat's the there's a whole thing happening like to go all these stories about kids that end up\n\n01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:55.640\ndoing all this fucked up shit or falling into these fucked up worlds like it's all on their phone\n\n01:09:55.640 --> 01:10:01.880\nand and that's the that's the same thing as their bedroom um uh if you know in the in the 60s and\n\n01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:06.120\nlike you gotta you gotta it's not their diary it's like you got to go through i'm like i'm\n\n01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:11.320\nlistening to this advice i'm like if that's true and i guess maybe it technically is like like\n\n01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:16.120\nbecause god knows no one else is gonna raise your kid for you but and i'm like okay so i'm not\n\n01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:23.240\nhaving a kid for sure i'm gonna go through a 12 year old's shit or be the only dad that doesn't\n\n01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:28.120\nlet a 12 year old have whatever the fuck everyone else has you know do you think we ship a sail for\n\n01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:32.760\nyou in terms of children like for good i don't know you know these you know these tadpoles are\n\n01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:41.720\nstill dancing as in ted do it i i learned that the hard way i mean cody it's all it's all up to\n\n01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:47.880\ncody like i mean it's not up i mean it's like it's it's it's it's driven by her she's she's\n\n01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:53.880\nshe's in her prime she's she's in her creative prime she's in her biological prime i should i'll\n\n01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:57.880\ni'll do i'll i'll probably do whatever she wants that's not true i'm gonna have like if i\n\n01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:03.160\ni think stuff i was seized with like no i definitely don't want kids and then she was like it's time\n\n01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:12.760\ni might be like uh i don't know i have to gaslight her somehow is there a book on how to gaslight\n\n01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:17.800\nno i don't know i don't know we're so we're really up in the air we've been we've just been\n\n01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:26.200\nhaving is that a uh an imperative for her or no she's not we're not yeah she's not she we don't\n\n01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:33.880\ndon't we're undecided and like she had she had a little period where she was like should i freeze\n\n01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:39.880\nmy eggs she talked to the therapist about it and the therapist was like look if freezing your eggs\n\n01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:47.320\nis like a ritual you need to engage in that lets you own your life uh then by all means freeze\n\n01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:53.560\nyour eggs but if you can skip the egg freezing and just and just do the like just stop identifying\n\n01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:58.680\nyourself by you know it's like that kind of thing like like like don't you shouldn't be this shouldn't\n\n01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:05.560\nbe running your life that's crazy the therapist probably didn't say that's crazy um but but and\n\n01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:09.160\nthen cut it was like okay i'm gonna freeze my eggs i told the story and then she like looked at the\n\n01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:15.640\ninformation she's like step one don't get high for six months and she's like nope ha ha well you were\n\n01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:23.960\nokay well eventually you're gonna deal breaker uh but i don't know i read we ran into a friend and\n\n01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:32.600\nshe uh she's in her 40s and she uh she has a podcast about trying to do um inseminate herself\n\n01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:38.040\nthere's a couple of those podcasts out there now um people that are going through the process of\n\n01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:44.200\ntrying to conceive and sharing the the details of it and stuff does that molly hockey's podcast\n\n01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:49.160\nyeah how do you know well she does a podcast oh okay right that's so weird that i mean it's like\n\n01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:53.800\nshe's she's advertised it on other podcasts that i've listened to okay it must be is it popular\n\n01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:58.040\nwell i don't i know i don't think it's super i mean i don't know especially she's a do you\n\n01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:04.760\nhave desire spencer to be a father or no oh i got all sorts of desires to be a father i don't know\n\n01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:11.400\ni could i could i could see that i don't know i don't want to force it i don't think that i want\n\n01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:18.120\none like a lot but i feel like i could do that you know the ultimate reason to be a father\n\n01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:27.000\nto prove something to the world yeah i think the ship has sailed from me i mean i could still\n\n01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:35.480\ndo it obviously but i'd like like my father had me when i was 41 i'm 45 and he like i i never had\n\n01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:40.440\nany memories of my dad who didn't have gray hair like he was always a salt and pepper\n\n01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:46.440\ngray haired guy and he taught soccer and baseball and how to ride a horse and how to dig a hole and\n\n01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:50.360\ndo a thing and like he was like like there's like a super dad and it's like i just don't know if i've\n\n01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:57.080\ngot the fucking i do improv yeah i feel like i'm getting such joy out of withdrawing from the world\n\n01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:04.280\nand i and like like my in in 13 years if i had a kid tomorrow that's only 13 years i have before\n\n01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:10.440\ni have another like fucking goober like that i just that i'm trying to cut loose you know it's\n\n01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:16.680\nlike like oh great another fucking like kid that i have to raise i just feel like i feel like i have\n\n01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:23.240\nto raise 300 000 of them every time i post an instagram i just want to like i just want to\n\n01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:30.040\nexperience for one moment before i get diagnosed with something like peace like i did it i beat you\n\n01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:36.040\nguess what i didn't like any of you either ha fooled you you know i thought like just what\n\n01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:41.720\njust one one hour of that before before i'm like in charge of whether or not people feel good or\n\n01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:48.200\nbad about themselves i like i hate people i've lost a lot of faith in the species but i don't\n\n01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:54.280\nfeel like it's a bad thing i feel like my faith was unhealthy it was like a codependence or something\n\n01:14:54.280 --> 01:15:00.120\nit was like you know approval addiction or something it's like yeah people are people suck\n\n01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.720\nlike they're they're shitty they're not all shitty and they're not none of them are all\n\n01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:10.840\nshitty as individuals and and certainly not all people are shitty there's a there's lots and\n\n01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:17.800\nlots of better ones and all the stuff but it's just in general so like you know bacteria you know\n\n01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:24.520\njust they're just garbage the internet is just it's just it's it i still struggle now with like\n\n01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:31.400\noh is it is it like like i like i felt like my latest insight is like because i posted this\n\n01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:37.560\ninstagram like where it was like the you know the photo of the black hole and uh i thought it was\n\n01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:41.960\na reasonable i thought it was a funny joke like like like uh take on the thing it was like the\n\n01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:48.200\nphoto of the black hole and i did this like caption where i was like uh oh it was it was a\n\n01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:53.720\nheadline that said like meet the woman that took the photo of the black hole and i and i so i did\n\n01:15:53.720 --> 01:16:00.440\nthis caption that was like okay well uh i saw this headline uh after i wrote my rotten tomatoes\n\n01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:07.160\nreview of the black hole and then did this kind of like review of the black hole where it was very\n\n01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:14.760\nclear that like i was uh trying to take something away from from the black hole as if it was created\n\n01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:21.000\nby a woman um and uh it was just it was just like a like a like you know it was like like i thought\n\n01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.600\nit was a well-crafted like but not like beyond anyone's like reckoning kind of thing and i remember\n\n01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:31.080\nlike at the end of it i was like i was like i always i always like hover over the click button\n\n01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:35.640\ni'm like okay what is anybody gonna misunderstand and i remember going like well you say the word\n\n01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:39.720\nwheelchair at the end that'll probably trigger a couple people and that's okay because i i said\n\n01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:46.040\nlike by the way but bottom line is this black hole is basically just a a collapsed star uh\n\n01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:50.440\nthat uh could have been predicted by uh almost any guy in a wheelchair or something like that and\n\n01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:54.920\ni was like uh like uh he said wheelchair and like you you might get a couple like ablest\n\n01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:59.640\ncomments and that's fine and then it clicked extended and it was like i looked back at it\n\n01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:05.960\nand i'm like holy shit it was like it was like like a petri dish and it was crazy it was like 10% of\n\n01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:13.480\n300 000 people just just just in all sincerity just going like yeah but just because she's a woman\n\n01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:19.400\ndoesn't make the black hole any less valuable like like in true sincerity i i read that one and i\n\n01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:23.480\npredicted before i looked at any comments that you're gonna get rumbled on that and then and then\n\n01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:28.840\nthe other 10% are arguing with them and going like no he's right this is fucking bullshit like\n\n01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:35.080\nidentity politics i'm like like like so just like dumb people it was it was actually like a\n\n01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:40.120\nout of all the things i've ever done that have been that misunderstood by that many people\n\n01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:43.960\nlike i was kind of like i regret that one the least because it really is this like moment of\n\n01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:49.480\nclarity where i'm like you can kind of like see like it felt like equal equal a number of equal\n\n01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:56.920\npeople on two lobes there were just like people that saw concepts that made them want to leap to\n\n01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:03.400\nthe defense of something with good intentions and people that hated those people is it like\n\n01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:09.640\nall just like people not exercising any amount of critical thinking really right because there's\n\n01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:16.040\nabsolutely no way i mean what at what point did you that's why i started thinking about it i was\n\n01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:21.640\nlike okay so are people getting dumber or like and i pictured like okay let's go to the roman\n\n01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:28.040\ncoliseum and like i think that what's ha i think the part of what the internet is doing is is this\n\n01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:33.240\nso imagine being at the roman coliseum and there's no there's no technology beyond like you're just\n\n01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:38.120\nyou're just in a crowd of people that's the that's the biggest internetiest crowd you could be in\n\n01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:42.840\nis just a bunch of people at the coliseum and then someone comes out and they think they're\n\n01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:46.840\nthey're gonna try to do a little bit you know like they and they like maybe something about\n\n01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:54.440\ntheir bit it's not they didn't think it through i had a i i wrote on the the vma's in 2006 and this\n\n01:18:54.440 --> 01:19:00.040\nwriter matt murray was like uh he's like you know you're being too nuanced with some of this stuff\n\n01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:06.680\nlike i wrote i wrote on the jimmy fowlin vma's and like what i learned is that these kinds of\n\n01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:11.080\naudiences can express themselves in one of two ways they can they can scream or they can be quiet\n\n01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:17.880\nit um and and so like so you're imagining like like the bandwidth being lowered so you don't\n\n01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:21.720\nhave a comment you don't have you know everyone doesn't have like this qwerty keyboard in front\n\n01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:26.920\nof them and and also but they're connected to each other so think about all the times you've\n\n01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:32.440\never been in public and you've been watching something like at a carnival or something and\n\n01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:35.880\nlike it probably it's probably a hard thing to remember because it probably doesn't stick out\n\n01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:39.320\nthat much in your memory because it's but you could what you can probably remember is that this\n\n01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:44.200\nhappens now and then you just probably can't like conjure up a list of the times you've seen it\n\n01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:50.680\nbut you're at a live performance and something something goes wrong something something goes\n\n01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:56.760\nwrong between the performer and the audience the uh the either it's either it's the performers fault\n\n01:19:56.760 --> 01:20:01.960\nthen that they didn't they didn't realize like how the venue how the timing of it was going to work\n\n01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:06.360\nor it's just simply like it's a matter of opinion on your part of whether or not the who\n\n01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:10.680\nwho there's anyone's fault but like you have memories in your head of like a disconnect\n\n01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:20.120\nhappening where somebody in the audience might might go like like oh boo like like like because\n\n01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:28.600\nthey're responding at the wrong time to the wrong concept and but then like that person\n\n01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:36.680\ntraditionally um they get they they get they get swallowed up either by silence or there's like\n\n01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:42.120\nthere's a group of people around them that are like off with his head no no and then but then\n\n01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:46.200\nthey'll overhear people going like it's a bit it's a bit it's a bit like like in real time\n\n01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:51.400\nand it'll just kind of like wash out that that's like usually we're biologically designed for\n\n01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:57.400\nthat to be a much more organic process and yeah people pop off and they want to be special and\n\n01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:03.160\nthey want to they want to contribute to things but we're designed biologically to do that in an\n\n01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:08.760\nenvironment where it just like stabilizes itself so quickly and which allows you to not have put\n\n01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:14.360\nyour ass out there that's the problem I think is that by the time people are telling you these\n\n01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:20.040\ndays that you're a fucking idiot that which happens to the best of us some shit goes over your head\n\n01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:24.760\nsometimes you're just looking at stuff the wrong way the wrong angle coffee cup the wrong nutrients\n\n01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:31.240\nand your breakfast like wrong wrong timing some performers fought sometimes too like uh like\n\n01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:37.080\nlike like but by the time someone is telling you uh you didn't get it it's over your head you don't\n\n01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:43.880\nhave a sense of humor you didn't you didn't get it you have written a fucking essay about about how\n\n01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:49.880\nno captain crunch should never be cloned cloning is unethical like there is no captain crunch that's\n\n01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:56.440\na serial character and you're like your tendency is therefore going to be to really well yeah\n\n01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:03.080\nstill though there are considerations like like whereas normally the way you're designed to be\n\n01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:07.720\nable to do is just go like like you're only you only have just a little bit of a yay or a boo\n\n01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:13.720\ncoming out of your mouth before you feel that humiliation kick in you don't have this kite\n\n01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:19.480\nthat you've flown that's been designed and and and all this energy put into it and I think that's\n\n01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:26.680\nand on one hand I think that that's like a way of of looking at it positively and saying like look\n\n01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:31.880\nwe're no different we're not changing that much we're just the just the medium it just it just\n\n01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:36.920\nit just it just shines different lights in different parts of our general the same amount of\n\n01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:42.280\nstupidity that we've always had but a really scary way of looking at it is that yeah but that's\n\n01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:48.440\nthat's a feedback loop that is that's a memory you store now it's different than going to a magic\n\n01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:55.320\nshow and the ladies sawn a little bit in half and you're like call 911 and and like someone goes\n\n01:22:55.320 --> 01:23:02.120\nlike it's it's magic and and you're like that's a different story you have in your head and you\n\n01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:06.760\nfile that differently and affects your complete your neurological map completely differently\n\n01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:17.240\nthan I think than if you write a paragraph you know advocating and defending and like\n\n01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:23.560\naccusing and and and hashtagging and and then someone is like wow you read that wrong\n\n01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:31.400\nand and I don't I don't know if that it's like it worries me that that that's going to make the\n\n01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:36.600\nthat that sock off balance it makes the dryer scoot all the way across the basement floor\n\n01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:43.320\ndo you millennials still have socks basements and dryers probably that probably they figured\n\n01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:48.520\nhow to make dryers not scoot across are we living in a post sock millennial world right now they\n\n01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:53.240\nprobably have like a like like contextually aware like dryers now that are like there's only one\n\n01:23:53.240 --> 01:24:04.040\nsock in here I will I will group swarm I will tag three other dryers on the block and receive dry\n\n01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:14.040\nsock information from them I want I want to I want to hear more from millennial dryer isn't\n\n01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:20.120\nit interesting uh I think it was a TED talk I heard when somebody was like this is interesting\n\n01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:24.600\nthis guy like like oh this is the TED talk I want to give it's sort of like just doom saying\n\n01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:34.360\nuh somebody explaining that um we can't uh we're not going to stop technology like we keep we I\n\n01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:40.040\nknow we know that in general but we keep the fact that we keep thinking of it like oh if something\n\n01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:44.280\ngoes too far we'll stop it or something goes into a dangerous area they were talking they were talking\n\n01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:48.760\nabout like the smart devices the fact that if you get a new refrigerator now it's it's a good\n\n01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:55.000\nchance it'll be like Wi-Fi capable for no reason that some yahoo just of course they put they made\n\n01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:00.520\nyour refrigerator like able to log on to the internet and like check on your juice or something\n\n01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:04.680\nlike like it's it's it always starts with some gimmick you know because oh what if that sells\n\n01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:11.480\nan extra refrigerator but it's like it it's never gonna stop there is no way you can't opt out of\n\n01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:17.880\nthis stuff I don't know why I find that interesting I guess I did find it like awful I guess we're\n\n01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:25.400\nin the end of the show because I'm just drunk and babbling nonsense I I travel so much and then I\n\n01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:30.120\nI have this thing where like I'll buy some food and then I have to go on the road and I'll put\n\n01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:35.960\neverything in the freezer and now I just got nothing but shit in the freezer I just have a\n\n01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:41.560\nmillion loaves of bread in the freezer that I just I that's I what kind of bread we're just gonna\n\n01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:48.280\nwe're just gonna see we're just gonna turn we're just too old man on a bus stop bench I like a\n\n01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:54.600\nmammoth duck variation so that's kind of like I want the bike the bike is nice you never were\n\n01:25:54.600 --> 01:26:02.440\nor a red rider wagon I don't know refrigerators are a bummer you let you go you buy some bananas\n\n01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:07.080\nand you're like I gotta leave town and you put the bananas in the freezer because you don't want\n\n01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:11.560\nthem to be rotting and then you just got some frozen ass bananas in there and they're black and\n\n01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:19.960\nthey yeah I mean I haven't I haven't I haven't stepped foot in a grocery store since since\n\n01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:26.840\nuh Teddy Roosevelt yeah and whenever it was it was just like for a party or something weird\n\n01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:30.840\nlike it was some scavenger hunt or something it wasn't like what was the last time you went to a\n\n01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:40.920\nmovie theater hmm I think I fell asleep during that piece of shit uh George Clooney uh Hitler\n\n01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:48.280\nstealing art movie uh the the monument the monument man monuments man monuments yeah I went to that uh\n\n01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:53.560\nit was it was me and Erin McGathy uh wow that was a while I got that kind of bet no because I felt\n\n01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:59.320\nCody and I saw Deadpool together I went to the the Vista theater which I love and I went there to go\n\n01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:06.600\nsee uh Dunkirk and I had a couple drinks and I fell asleep like immediately and then woke up\n\n01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:12.920\nlike about 20 minutes in going like I'm just a drunk guy asleep in a movie theater at a matinee\n\n01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:17.560\nand I got up and I left and then I came back the next day sober and then I liked the movie it was\n\n01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:23.000\na good movie yeah you ever go to the theater in like Old Town Pasadena where you you you get the arm\n\n01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:27.800\nchair oh yeah with the sleep you get the car tails and pretzels to you and don't don't don't feed me\n\n01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:32.120\nand get me drunk drink a movie I'm gonna fucking fall asleep yeah no that's what I did monuments\n\n01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:37.880\nmen baby I was probably I was probably snoring I mean I can't imagine they give you a blanket\n\n01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:42.520\ndon't give me a blanket when Gene Wilder died maybe maybe I spoke about this before when Gene Wilder\n\n01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:47.560\npassed away uh the arc light in Hollywood showed a bunch of Gene Wilder films and church and I went\n\n01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:53.240\nand saw blazing saddles and it was awesomely people that were over 40 and people that were\n\n01:27:53.240 --> 01:28:01.400\nlike under 30 I can't imagine and people under 30 the people over 40 were dying laughing because\n\n01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:06.040\nwe've all seen the movie a million times we can karaoke the whole thing and the the youngsters\n\n01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:12.600\nwere a little uncomfortable yeah because there's 11 n-bombs in the first reel yeah and nobody knew\n\n01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:18.840\nwhere to fucking put it and I I thought it was made it the movie even funnier that people were\n\n01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:25.960\nbeing bummed out at blazing saddles well I mean if you've repeated that process today I think\n\n01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:30.680\nyou'd find the people over 40 would would all right the times have changed so fast that nobody\n\n01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:38.440\nwould be laughing in there right I guess I don't know it's uh it's good that things are changing\n\n01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:43.240\nby the way what sometimes I search my head for that stuff I'm like like like what is that like\n\n01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:49.880\nthat reaction you have when you hear another thing about like oh so-and-sos uh wants uh from now on\n\n01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:53.960\nyou they should call this thing that thing and then you like you always have that I always\n\n01:28:53.960 --> 01:29:00.200\nhave that thing use my i statements I I I always have that like thing or I'm like gaw for crying\n\n01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:07.000\nout loud what's it gonna stop you know like all right well never it's never gonna stop yeah like\n\n01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:13.480\nwhat and it's like it's kind of it's freaking me out now that I'm 46 because I'm realizing like I'm\n\n01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:21.080\nlike oh shit they're coming for me and like it doesn't matter how woke I get today tomorrow\n\n01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:27.160\nnext week like I'm Walt Disney at this point like I've done my crimes my steamboat willies on the\n\n01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:33.560\ninternet like I can't get it off I like I am problematic I've been problematic for the first\n\n01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:38.680\n40 years of my life and the older I get the more problematic it's gonna be there's a whole\n\n01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:44.040\nanother generation coming if I'm lucky enough to make it the 70 there's gonna be uh 20 year olds\n\n01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:48.600\nthat are gonna make you guys roll your eyes that are gonna be like this guy's Hitler like like\n\n01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:53.160\nwatching my fucking shitty well that's like like doing doing the improv shows that we do with who's\n\n01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:58.600\nlive uh like there's a bit that we do where we uh we bring out a woman out of the audience and we\n\n01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:05.400\nask her about her life and I sing a song to her and I used to make it way more kind of flirtatious\n\n01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:12.280\nand romantic and and we did a show in Madison, Wisconsin on the day of the Kavanaugh confirmation\n\n01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:19.080\nand on the uh the Capitol steps uh in Madison have I said this before have we spoken? I think you\n\n01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:24.600\nI think you told the story that you that you that you you you checked yourself and before your rigidity\n\n01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:29.160\nwrecked well we we got a review that day we're standing out there and hearing all these stories\n\n01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:33.720\nand everybody got up and got a microphone and told their stories about all the shit that they've\n\n01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:39.640\ngone through and it was pretty heavy and then I had to go do an improv show and it's five white guys\n\n01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:45.960\non stage uh doing a show the day that fucking Kavanaugh was confirmed and it was a triggering\n\n01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:53.160\nday for a lot of people and we got a review from a woman who just fucking hated us and I dig it\n\n01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:58.840\nbecause that was a bad day for a women kind and for lots of people um but I've I've had to\n\n01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:06.680\nvoluntarily adjust the way that I approach that one improv game um because it's like it's like\n\n01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:12.200\neverything is just and for all the good reasons and for every possible reason things have shifted\n\n01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:19.720\ninto a way that like what used to be hilarious is not and in the way that it used to be even\n\n01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:26.760\njust a few months ago uh and there's ways to do it and still be funny but without doing the other\n\n01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:35.240\nthing yeah before I got me toed uh you got like me three didn't you I think I got me one and a half\n\n01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:43.800\nbut um even before that like on the you know when the when the Weinstein kind of like water table\n\n01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:50.200\nuh did whatever water tables do I don't know I'm not nautical um but um but I remember like kind\n\n01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:54.360\nof like okay all right now let's examine ourselves let's be aware of what's going on and I remember\n\n01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:59.560\nrunning in my through my head for like the first time in my life I was just sort of in shows like\n\n01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:06.120\nwhether it's on stage at the workplace with strangers anybody it was kind of like because\n\n01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:11.880\nI it started with me going like okay what about that what about that relationship um\n\n01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:18.120\num and and stumbling upon the idea of like well were you were you did it matter was it like\n\n01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:22.600\noh examine and doing all this negotiation in my head and then I was like uh something made me go\n\n01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:29.400\nwell why don't you look at it this way what what what if it was uh this guy that you had the same\n\n01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:35.400\nset of circumstances with like swapped out the woman in my head for a guy and then was like\n\n01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:40.440\nwhoa like like all of a sudden was like wait no I would the guy would have been like what are you\n\n01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:46.840\ndoing stop or if people were just been like what what's with you or I would have been like what's\n\n01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:52.600\nwith myself and then kind of like blossoming out in my head going like oh god every Dunkin\n\n01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:58.120\nDonuts cashier anybody like like in any time because there's a lot of stuff that like also part of\n\n01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:03.160\ngrowing up don't you don't you feel like you came of an age where you were like actually a lot of\n\n01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:13.640\nit was like absolutely not anything but like learning to be uh actually kind and uh um charming or\n\n01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:20.440\nfunny or you know what I mean like like part of being a man like and becoming confident it was\n\n01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:26.200\nlike and you'd get you get it was involved like sexualizing like I don't mean sexualizing like\n\n01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:31.160\nthe activity I mean like gender-wise but like like kind of like like getting like like sort of like\n\n01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:40.040\nacknowledging the differences between you and the person you're talking to it was like it was\n\n01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:46.360\nlike the equivalent of like learning to use a flathead screwdriver like you were graduating from\n\n01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:53.240\nFisher price to Sears tools and it felt benevolent it didn't it felt the opposite of\n\n01:33:53.240 --> 01:34:00.440\npredatory it felt gracious and chivalrous and charming and all this stuff and but then you\n\n01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:09.000\nlook back on it and you go okay but now these kids are ready for like whether that was right or wrong\n\n01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:15.240\nor doesn't really matter now the kids are ready they're like okay but let's wipe that clean like\n\n01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:23.480\ndon't talk to anybody uh uh in a way that acknowledges like anything that you perceive with your\n\n01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:32.200\neyeballs period like just see them as a fucking like tennis ball on a stick and like get ready for\n\n01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:38.520\nyou know be AI compatible in your dealings and you will that then you don't have to worry about it\n\n01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:44.360\nyou'll talk about what scares you talk about what you know and don't all of those areas are problem\n\n01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:48.280\nareas and I think that is what's frustrating for people is they're like oh what so I could never\n\n01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:53.000\ndo this I could never do that like yeah you can't it's like yeah it's frustrating it is like a bunch\n\n01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.840\nof stuff that you did last week like it's not on the table anymore and it's frustrating and\n\n01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:02.520\nembarrassing and I do and I do think that like the the problem that the perpetuating cycle thing is\n\n01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:08.760\nthat the people don't they don't understand that the idea of correcting people or or hoping that\n\n01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:14.520\npeople get better it shouldn't be such a gleeful activity because that's you're not you're not\n\n01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:21.160\ngonna make any new converts like it's like that's exactly their nightmare so the only way that you\n\n01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:28.040\nlearn that you that that that it's it's sex worker instead of prostitute now there's no hogwarts for\n\n01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:33.720\nthat you know if you're 48 years old you you could be the best person in the world if I went back\n\n01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:38.440\nthrough all of all of Harmontown there's a thousand things I would take back and not not have said\n\n01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:42.200\nagain because they're not they weren't funny then and they wouldn't be funny now like it's it's like\n\n01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:47.480\nthere's so many there's there's a couple things I said on whose line that aired on tv that I would\n\n01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:52.680\ngo oh no I'd never fucking say that again because it's like it doesn't I don't think it was funny\n\n01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:57.160\nthen but but I was allowed to get away with it then well that's what I'm saying and that's what\n\n01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:03.560\nit's almost like karma because it's like how how much glee have we taken when we were 18 and 25 like\n\n01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:09.800\nthe idea that uh oh there was some time long ago when that you could scroll back in the micro\n\n01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:19.480\nfission like aha Kleenex had a racist ad like and we felt superior I'd be like aha like like like I\n\n01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:25.000\ncaught you you know when you would dig that stuff up it's it was just like more of a difficult thing\n\n01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:31.640\nto do and it was more profound back then I was like but we it and then that makes me shudder now\n\n01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:40.600\nbecause it's like oh you're you're next like you're you're frigid air you're disney you're you're just\n\n01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:46.120\nyou're an institution if you're lucky every disney you walked on main street and there was a\n\n01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:51.960\nthey're gone now there was curtains had swastikas on them but I think it was swastikas in the old\n\n01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:56.760\nlike like a
