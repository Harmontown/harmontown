{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:07.000\nLadies and gentlemen, this is Harmontown and it is now its session.\n\n00:07.000 --> 00:16.000\nPlease welcome to the stage Spencer Crittenden.\n\n00:16.000 --> 00:21.000\nThe mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:21.000 --> 00:25.000\nI will be guest comptrolling for the lovely, lovely Jeff Davis.\n\n00:25.000 --> 00:31.000\nI am Brandon Johnson. God bless you.\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:33.000\nThank you, Brandon. How are you?\n\n00:33.000 --> 00:35.000\nI'm a little drunk already.\n\n00:35.000 --> 00:36.000\nOh, really?\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:37.000\nYeah.\n\n00:37.000 --> 00:40.000\nWell, we got a late start so we're just up there boozing it up.\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:45.000\nSorry, we'll start on time at some point in the future.\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:50.000\nAnd if we don't, then we're just late starting on time.\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:51.000\nI like that.\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:52.000\nYeah.\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:59.000\nI have really bad heartburn because I just went off of Prilosec\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:04.000\nbecause I went to the doctor and he said, how are you feeling?\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:10.000\nI went to go in for my little check-up, check the liver, check everything.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:12.000\nJust the liver.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:13.000\nWell, mostly the liver.\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:14.000\nI'm going for the liver.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:15.000\nYeah.\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:17.000\nBecause I don't want anything.\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:18.000\nWell, whatever.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:21.000\nI know I'm going to get some kind of cirrhosis or whatever or something\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:24.000\nand then people are going to be like, I just hate that.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:32.000\nI'm allowed to drink and then die without it being like, told you so.\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:34.000\nIt's just like, fuck you.\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:38.000\nSo what if I drink my whole life and then it's my liver that kills me?\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:42.000\nIt's like, see?\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:43.000\nI just hate that.\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:44.000\nI hate how we deal with death.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:48.000\nWe act like it's a disease, but even worse than that,\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:51.000\nlike that it strikes only those that did something to deserve it.\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:54.000\nLike, you're all going to die fucking pieces of shit.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:57.000\nAnd by the way, I've said it before.\n\n01:57.000 --> 01:58.000\nI'll say it again.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:06.000\nI'll believe any shit that you say about medicine the day anyone generates a society\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:11.000\nwhere the doctors live on average a day longer than the other people.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:16.000\nThere's no fucking doctors don't live any longer.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:24.000\nThey know everything and they die randomly because God made us to kill us.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:32.000\nThat's our relationship or we created God to kill us.\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:37.000\nKeeping things fancy for Brandon a little more collegiate for the kids.\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:44.000\nBut anyway, so I've been taking Prilosec for like a fucking long enough to have Alzheimer's for sure.\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:48.000\nBecause if you do die, you don't want to die with heartburn.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:53.000\nYeah, but then they linked Prilosec to Alzheimer's now, like last year.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:55.000\nSo the doctor says, how are you feeling?\n\n02:55.000 --> 03:00.000\nHe says at the end of the whole thing, he says, is there anything you're worried about?\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:03.000\nFirst of all, you don't mean.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:06.000\nMotherfucker, you're a job.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:09.000\nLike, how fucking fake is this shit?\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:17.000\nIt's like a tarot card reader being like, just think about what's on your mind and also tell me real quick.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:18.000\nMy job.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:21.000\nWell, then that's what that means.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:23.000\nHe goes like, are you worried about anything?\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:25.000\nAnd I'm like, no, no, I'm fine.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:30.000\nAnd I'm like, well, wait, well, I've been taking Prilosec for like a fucking ever.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:32.000\nAnd should I be doing that?\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:36.000\nThey told me keep taking it because it was fine.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:42.000\nAnd he's like, I'm like, because I heard it was linked to Alzheimer's and he's like, yeah, here's the thing.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:47.000\nI want you to get off the Prilosec because it causes Alzheimer's.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:51.000\nLike he acted like I said nothing.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:56.000\nHe just pretended that it was his idea.\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:58.000\nI was like, what the fuck?\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:02.000\nMaybe he heard your impression of him.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:08.000\nIs it any whatever, man? Is it is it rude to blow your nose in a restaurant?\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:09.000\nIs it?\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:10.000\nYes.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:17.000\nWell, I don't mean to ask you a question and then disagree with you, but I think the answer is a case by case basis.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:22.000\nI think if you can tell it's going to be audible, like what's in there?\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:25.000\nI think if...\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:30.000\nI think no one should ever sneeze.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:38.000\nI hold in my sneezes, I'd say like 95% of the time and I'd say it's the right thing to do.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:43.000\nI certainly wish to rip off a thought from Karen and Georgia on my favorite murder.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:47.000\nThey were talking about shout-sneezers, people that scream when they...\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:50.000\nPeople that are just like...\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:52.000\nStop doing that. That's a choice.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:57.000\nAnother thing you could do is you could turn a sneeze into a yell where you go...\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:00.000\nAhh!\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:04.000\nBut I'll tell you this, man, nothing is more nerve-wracking than people...\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:08.000\nNo, I mean, the people when they go like...\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:13.000\nAnd you're like, God, Jesus Christ, you're killing yourself.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:15.000\nI don't want anybody doing that.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:17.000\nYeah, don't do that for me.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:18.000\nOh, I'm doing it.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:19.000\nLet it out.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:21.000\nBut that's part of why you do it.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:25.000\nBecause, you know, that's what exactly it...\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:28.000\nThat's the stigma, like you're going to get a stroke or something.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:31.000\nWouldn't that be amazing if someone was like...\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:35.000\nAnd they'd just like topple over and their eye turns red?\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:37.000\nIt would be amazing.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:39.000\nHe was so polite.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:42.000\nAnd then his head exploded.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:43.000\nIt killed him.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:49.000\nHe was a doctor, but he died at 50 because he was a polite doctor.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:54.000\nWell, yeah, I don't think I had anything else to say.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:57.000\nLook, I blew my nose in a restaurant at House of Pies today.\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:01.000\nAnd I was like, first of all, it's House of Pies, so the bar is lowered.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:05.000\nBut then I blew it and I was like, I bet nobody wanted to hear that.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:10.000\nBecause it's one thing, there's a nose blow where it just sounds like there's...\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:12.000\nYou know, you're just blowing your nose.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:17.000\nAnd then there's nose blows that's like, oh, two things just came out.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nI don't know if that should be...\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:24.000\nNo one wants to hear foley work when you're blowing your nose.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:28.000\nIf it's one sound effect of guy blowing his nose on the sound effect record, fine.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:35.000\nIf it's two sound effects of grape coming out of a garden hose or something.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:38.000\nIt's still a record.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:42.000\nIn your mind, it's still a sound effect record, which I love.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:46.000\nWhen I was a kid, they had record albums at the library.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:49.000\nAnd I used to always rent the...\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:51.000\nI would beg my mom, like, can I get this?\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:53.000\nAnd she's like, again, it was sound effects record.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:56.000\nI would get sound effects records.\n\n06:56.000 --> 07:00.000\nAnd I would just sit and listen to them, like a fucking asshole.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:03.000\nThe shit paid off.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:06.000\nJust like spooky sound effects.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nI was really into the occult of stuff.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:12.000\nBut all year round, I would rent Halloween sound effects records.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:17.000\nAnd it would just be the same shit on every record, because they would just be recycled or licensed.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:21.000\nThere would be some guy going on a piano.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:23.000\nAnd then window shutters.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.000\nAnd then a cat going...\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:31.000\nAnd I would just sit there and fucking stim and listen to it.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:34.000\nI gotta be autistic, right?\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:39.000\nAnd I just figured out how to start covering it up at 9 or something.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:42.000\nSo you can't diagnose me now, because I'm like Ben Affleck in the accountant.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:44.000\nI'm like hiding it.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:45.000\nNo, he's not hiding it.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:49.000\nHe's like stoked about it.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:51.000\nYou gotta see Ben Affleck in the accountant.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:53.000\nIt's amazing.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:54.000\nIt's so incredible.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:57.000\nHe's an autistic superhero.\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:04.000\nBecause his dad was an army man that didn't cotton to autism acceptance.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nAnd so trained him to.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:12.000\nHis dad figured, well, if he doesn't like bright lights and loud sounds, then he should be exposed to more of them.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:14.000\nAnd he should learn to kill.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:19.000\nAnd instead of that guy being the villain, that guy is like the Obi-Wan.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:24.000\nHe's the reason why instead of just a regular autistic Ben Affleck is an amazing crime fighter.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:28.000\nBecause he's part autistic, part functional soldier.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:31.000\nThe combination is amazing.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:35.000\nHe can autistically aim his sniper rifle.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nIt's so fucked up.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:40.000\nHe can calculate how to kill you.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:42.000\nIt's really silly.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:43.000\nAnd amazing.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:45.000\nIt's really that and Lucy.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:48.000\nAll bad movies should be as good as that.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:52.000\nLucy's, that's the one where she's using 100% of her brain so she can just start making people float.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nIs that the one I'm thinking of?\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:56.000\nI did not see Lucy.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:59.000\nAnd Morgan Freeman just keeps narrating the whole movie at 70% of your brain.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:00.000\nYou can make shit float.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:01.000\nAnd then she just does it.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nThere's no conflict in the whole movie.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:09.000\nIn the first 10 minutes there's conflict because she hasn't yet ingested this superhero amount of drugs.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:11.000\nAnd then she becomes a superhero in the rest of the movie.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:15.000\nIt's just her fucking making the city lay down or making a building dance.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:18.000\nAnd then Morgan Freeman's explaining in VO why that's possible.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:23.000\nAnd then she just turns into a computer and flies into the moon or something.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:24.000\nBut it's great.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:28.000\nIt's a great movie.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:35.000\nAlright, let's bring up Rob's Schrab and Cordry.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.000\nWoo!\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:54.000\nThe Rob's are gesturing to each other to go through the stairs.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:59.000\nThey went up together at the same time.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:03.000\nI'm narrating.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:06.000\nWe came up together at the same time.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:12.000\nYou know, this is a great live show and a better live stream, but it's also an audio podcast.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:14.000\nYep.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:21.000\nTo those listeners at home, we did a fantastic bit.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:24.000\nAnd I narrated it excellent.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:29.000\nEven though no one laughed at it, it was funny in a very subtle way.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nI really liked it.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nI really liked what we did.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:35.000\nIt was really good.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:36.000\nIt was great.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:37.000\nIt was really good.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:38.000\nDaniel.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:39.000\nWe were on the same page.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:40.000\nHello.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:44.000\nCome on, Harmon, don't fuck this up.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nHi, Dan.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:48.000\nHi.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:50.000\nHappy Sunday.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:55.000\nThe thing is not coming up that's asking me if I want a mirror.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:56.000\nOh, no.\n\n10:56.000 --> 11:02.000\nWhy is the mannequin hid behind the dollhouse?\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:04.000\nWhy is it?\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:06.000\nWhat?\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:08.000\nYou thought I was the mannequin?\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:10.000\nThere were people that thought...\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:12.000\nThat's a compliment.\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:17.000\nThat's a sexy mannequin.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:19.000\nYou think I'm that thin?\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:22.000\nOh, I bet I know what it is.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:24.000\nOh, you can see is the dome.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:27.000\nAnd you saw fishnets.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:30.000\nYou ready, Dan?\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:32.000\nWe've been stalling.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:37.000\nI probably won't do this every week.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:40.000\nI'm experimenting with her.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:42.000\nI didn't make you wait for any...\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:44.000\nShut up.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:48.000\nI got two rubs up here.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:49.000\nThat's a good rub.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:51.000\nThere's a fucking point to that.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:54.000\nIf either of you steps out of line, it's like, look to your left.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:56.000\nIt's a p-roblem.\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:58.000\nOh, shit.\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:01.000\nAnd I'm someone, and I'm someone's dad.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:09.000\nSo I got, you know, I got topics tonight.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:11.000\nIt's just like a slide.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:13.000\nThis is my mind map.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:19.000\nI got entertainment, politics, psychology, art, science, and culture.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nBrandon's face is uncultured.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:24.000\nThank you, Brandon, for posing for...\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:26.000\nFor those of you that...\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:29.000\nThey're just laughing at the fact that I've got quite a visual...\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:31.000\nI've got a mind map set up here.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:37.000\nBut the podcast is still going to be very audio-friendly.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:41.000\nAnd I don't know that I'll have all Sunday to like...\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:44.000\nI talked about Hartburn.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:46.000\nI didn't talk about Ruby Ridge.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:48.000\nI saw a documentary about Ruby Ridge.\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:50.000\nDo you know anything about that?\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:51.000\nYou ever hear of Ruby Ridge?\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:52.000\nNo, I don't.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:53.000\nI don't either.\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:57.000\nIt was like the prequel to Waco that makes you go like,\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nwell, why did Waco happen?\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:00.000\nWhy didn't they learn anything?\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:02.000\nBecause it's just like the government was just like,\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:04.000\noh, first they entrapped a guy.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:07.000\nLike they were worried because there were Nazis in the woods.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:10.000\nLike there are people out there.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:12.000\nBut it's like, now I think you watch that and go like,\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:14.000\nGod, the glory days.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:18.000\nRemember when the Nazis were in the woods?\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:23.000\nJust running around being Nazis and having like little things,\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nburning things and like dancing and going like,\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:28.000\nwe ought to be in the city.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:34.000\nI'd love to sit high with more people while you can't.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:38.000\nYou got to stay in the woods.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:41.000\nYou got Jethro Hitler.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nBut, you know, because now they're in the White House,\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:45.000\nthat it's worse, isn't it?\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nThat's worse when they're in the White House.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:48.000\nIt's pretty bad.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:51.000\nI always go, when I go back to, I grew up in New England,\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:56.000\nwhenever I go back there, there's bunkers everywhere,\n\n13:56.000 --> 14:00.000\nlike old cement bunkers from World War II.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:02.000\nAnd it always seems so cute.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:04.000\nIt's like adorable.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:09.000\nLike, oh, look, they thought people were going to attack from the sea.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:17.000\nNo, no, it's going to be electronically, you fucking dummies.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:23.000\nPepe the frog will be the submarine that...\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:27.000\nGoing to hack your Amazon account.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\nDon't you feel bad for that?\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:31.000\nNice of DVDs.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:34.000\nRight. Well, look.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:36.000\nYeah, whatever.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:39.000\nSo there was this guy that was running around with the Nazis too,\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nbut he was really just like a farmer,\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:45.000\nand in the 70s, the farmers got really fucked.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:49.000\nAnd this guy was kind of like, you know,\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nhe wasn't a big fan of the federal government,\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:53.000\nand he liked his farm and life,\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nand he moved out to the middle of nowhere,\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:56.000\nand there were Nazis out there,\n\n14:56.000 --> 15:00.000\nand he kind of made friends with them.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:04.000\nBecause their cups of sugar were still sweet.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:08.000\nThey just happened to be Nazis.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:12.000\nAnd because there were Nazis there,\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:14.000\nthere were like feds that were like infiltrating\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:16.000\nand always trying to like, you know,\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:18.000\nfigure out how do we bust these guys?\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:19.000\nThey make us nervous.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nAnd so they told this guy,\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.000\nit was entrapment, like they said,\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:25.000\nlike, hey, do you think he could saw off some shotguns for us?\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:27.000\nAnd he's like, okay, I have a saw.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:29.000\nAnd then they're like, you're under arrest.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:31.000\nGod damn it, no.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:35.000\nNo, this is because I'm a Nazi, right?\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nThis is because my friends are Nazis.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:39.000\nAnd so he didn't want to go to jail.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nAnd then they're like, well, now what are we going to do?\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:42.000\nHe's surrounded by Nazis\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:45.000\nand has a bunch of sawed off shotguns.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:50.000\nYou didn't take the shotguns with you?\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:53.000\nAnd so then it just went to fucking shit,\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:55.000\nbecause the government was trying to figure out\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:58.000\nhow do you walk in and go and like,\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:00.000\nthere's kids and there's guns.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:03.000\nAnd so they were creeping around the property all the time\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:05.000\nfor months trying to figure out what to do.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nAnd maybe we'll set up a couple more cameras\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:09.000\nand just watch them a little bit more.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:12.000\nAnd after a while we'll figure out an easy way to do this.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:14.000\nAnd then one time they were creeping around the property\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:15.000\nand the dog started barking.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:18.000\nAnd then like five minutes later,\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:20.000\nno one knows what really happened.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:22.000\nEveryone's accusing everyone else of being villains.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:27.000\nBut like the dog was dead, a kid was dead.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:29.000\nAnd everyone was freaking the fuck out\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nand there was a big standoff.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nAnd then they brought it.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:35.000\nThey were just had like snipers\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:37.000\nthat were just watching the house.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.000\nAnd then like the wife walked out\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:41.000\nand they just fucking killed her.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:44.000\nBut the feds didn't know that the wife was dead,\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:46.000\nso they kept trying to use her\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nto like get the guy to surrender\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:50.000\nand go like, come on, do it for Margaret.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nAnd he's like, what the hell are you talking about?\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:54.000\nShe's laying on the kitchen floor\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:56.000\nand they're like, we can't hear you.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:58.000\nYou don't have a loudspeaker.\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:00.000\nMargaret loves muffins, come on.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:04.000\nAnd he thought they were just fucking with him.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:07.000\nLike because how do you kill someone and not know?\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:10.000\nAnd the answer is government.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:14.000\nAnyways, Ruby Ridge, check it out.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:16.000\nGoogle it, it's fun.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:20.000\nIs it rude to blow your nose in a restaurant?\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:22.000\nI guess the answer to what I'm hearing is no.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:23.000\nOoh, you had something.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:24.000\nI had something.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:26.000\nYou had something to say.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:27.000\nCheck it out.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:29.000\nYou know what, I think it is\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:32.000\nif you have cloth napkins.\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:35.000\nIf you're in a nicer restaurant\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:39.000\nthat has taken the time to give you cloth napkins.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.000\nBut I still do it.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:44.000\nI'll still blow my nose in those things.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:46.000\nYeah, I've never done that.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:47.000\nThat feels like...\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:48.000\nYeah, I know.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:50.000\nI don't feel good about it.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:51.000\nBut I'll do it.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:53.000\nI'll definitely do it.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:57.000\nI found out I'm not sexist because I was...\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:03.000\nI was at a rap party for a show that I control from above.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:08.000\nAnd one of the writers, who's a lady writer,\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:10.000\na righteous,\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:13.000\nshe, who I respect as a human being,\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:15.000\nI give her a job on a show.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nAnd her partner, by the way,\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:20.000\nwrote the show while writing a human being in her belly.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:23.000\nBecause if she needed maternity leave,\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:25.000\nshe wouldn't get it.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:29.000\nBut so one of the writers,\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nat the rap party,\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:33.000\nRightress,\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:36.000\nshe brought her husband,\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\nwho I've met a thousand times.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nAnd my girlfriend, Cody,\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nwho's also a rightress, by the way,\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:44.000\nshe met the husband.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:45.000\nShe started talking.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:46.000\nShe's like, well, what do you do?\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:47.000\nAnd I was like, what does he do?\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:49.000\nHe's married to a writer.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:51.000\nHe does.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:53.000\nAnd then his job turned out really interesting.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:55.000\nHe designs video games and stuff,\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:57.000\nand he's particularly designing stuff\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:59.000\nthat has to do with helping people's neurology\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:01.000\nthat have PTSD and all this stuff.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:03.000\nAll this interesting stuff that I didn't know,\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:05.000\nbecause I never saw him as a human being\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:08.000\nbecause I'm not sexist.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nBecause I respect writers,\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:13.000\nnot men.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:17.000\nAnd I hate spouses, not women.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:20.000\nI'm fucking awesome.\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:23.000\nThank you.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:25.000\nWell,\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:28.000\nwhy don't we check in with the entertainment section here?\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:31.000\nWe've got a lot of...\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:32.000\nSee, I'm so excited.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:34.000\nIt's like a real show.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:36.000\nYou guys heard about Piers Morgan today, right?\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:37.000\nLike, he...\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:38.000\nYeah, what happened?\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:40.000\nIt turned out he doesn't know...\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:42.000\nOh, yeah, yeah, I did read this.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:44.000\nHe was talking about...\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:47.000\nHe was talking about men, men this and men that,\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:49.000\nand men should suck it up, and then...\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:50.000\nYeah, men should suck it up.\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:52.000\nAnd then men should suck it up.\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:55.000\nI'm gonna get that tattooed on my fucking balls.\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:57.000\nThe...\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:59.000\nAnd he was like, oh, men this and men that,\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:01.000\nand then men were tweeting at him and going like,\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:03.000\nwell, fuck you, once you grow up,\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:06.000\nreal men know how they feel and talk about their feelings,\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:08.000\nand then he responded to one of them,\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:11.000\nis James Bond not a real man then?\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:13.000\nAnd the real entertaining thing was like,\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:15.000\nthen for the rest of the day, he...\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:17.000\nIt was like, you knew something was up,\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:19.000\nbecause it was like, wait, he doesn't know,\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:20.000\nbut then he clearly...\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:22.000\nHe was like, oh, yeah, I didn't know that.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:24.000\nYeah, thanks a lot, I didn't know that.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:26.000\nBut he responded to every tweet,\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:28.000\nand it just kept going, yeah, I didn't know.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:29.000\nThanks for telling me.\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:30.000\nWhat, James Bond isn't real?\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:31.000\nI thought he was real.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:33.000\nIt was like, you did, didn't you?\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:35.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:38.000\nYou tweeted 50 times about this.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:40.000\nYou thought James Bond was real, and you're British.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:42.000\nWe're allowed to think he's real.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:43.000\nRight.\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:46.000\nDoes he not hang out with G.I. Joe?\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:52.000\nSo anyways, way to go, you fucking ball sack.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:53.000\nI hate Pierce Morgan.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:55.000\nI guess you're supposed to hate him,\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:56.000\nand that's bread and circuses.\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:57.000\nWhat is this?\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:58.000\nAdam Ultraberg tagged you into...\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:00.000\nWell, you're just playing into his trap.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:01.000\nYeah.\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:02.000\nThat's it.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:04.000\nAnd there's Adam Goldberg figuring

21:28.000\nOh.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:30.000\nSo, like, for instance...\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:33.000\nWell, so, okay, so my girlfriend, Cody Heller,\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:36.000\nlike, she does what a lot of people does, do.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:37.000\nNo, does.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:38.000\nDoes.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:42.000\nShe, at one point, she started following everyone named\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nCody Heller on Facebook, and stuff like that.\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:45.000\nI do that.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:47.000\nI have a couple Dan Harmon friends.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:48.000\nYeah.\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:50.000\nNo, everyone should do that.\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:51.000\nI think it's fun.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:53.000\nYou want to find out what you look like\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:55.000\nif your parents had actually fed you vegetables.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:56.000\nYeah.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:57.000\nI also...\n\n21:57.000 --> 22:00.000\nYou want to find, like, the better version of you,\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:01.000\nbecause if there's, like, I look...\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:03.000\nThere's a better Brandon Johnson out there,\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:05.000\nlike, he's fucking successful, and he's handsome,\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:07.000\nand I'm like, I'll kill this dude.\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:12.000\nI follow a guy whose first name is Cordry.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:13.000\nReally?\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:14.000\nYeah.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:19.000\nBecause his parents were a fan of my, like, distant cousins,\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:23.000\nwho was a journalist for the Washington Post,\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:27.000\nback in the 60s, and he asked Ronald Reagan\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:31.000\na question once in the 80s, and they were like,\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:38.000\nyes, he... he then... and they named him Cordry.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:40.000\nHis first name is Cordry.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:43.000\nSo shout out.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:44.000\nI follow...\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:48.000\nOne of the guys I follow on Twitter is Dan Garmin.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:51.000\nAnd so when things are real bad, like, after the election,\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:52.000\nI'll just check in with him and go,\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:57.000\nwhat's going on in your universe?\n\n22:57.000 --> 22:59.000\nYou're treating it like you're parallel.\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:06.000\nI'll grump and get elected.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:08.000\nBut he's always like, no, it's the same here.\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:10.000\nMy name's just different than yours.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:15.000\nYour fame doesn't make me an object.\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:19.000\nBut anyways, Cody follows a bunch of Cody Hellers.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:21.000\nWe're all dudes, basically.\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:26.000\nCody's more, I guess, skews more of a dude name.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:30.000\nThe only reason that's important is that all this is\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:32.000\nis just a random video from YouTube.\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:34.000\nAnd if you're listening, you'll hear the audio.\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:36.000\nThere is no... the video is simply...\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:38.000\nWe'll tell you what the video is, but the audio is where it's at.\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:40.000\nSpeaking of hearing the audio,\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:42.000\nwe're going to need to plug in that headphone jack.\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:43.000\nGood call.\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:44.000\nGood call, Spencer.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:45.000\nOh, brother.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:48.000\nDo you follow any Spencers or do you curious about these?\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:51.000\nNo, I think it's a really weird thing to do.\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:55.000\nMaybe it's because I have a weird name, but yeah.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:58.000\nAre there dicks in this?\n\n23:58.000 --> 23:59.000\nNo.\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:00.000\nOkay.\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:03.000\nJust asking.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:09.000\nI think that's a reasonable question.\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:10.000\nContext, yeah.\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:12.000\nYeah, I mean, you made it a point to say that\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:15.000\nCody's are usually men.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:18.000\nOh, yeah, well, but I mean, there's a...\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:21.000\nIt takes place in a karate dojo this video,\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:24.000\nso I guess you could say there's like 50 dicks, but...\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:28.000\nBut so it's just this video that's posted of this guy,\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:30.000\nCody Heller's YouTube page.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:33.000\nI guess what it is, is it's him like...\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:37.000\nI think it's Cody Heller, who I think is maybe a Russian guy\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:40.000\nor a Polish guy, I don't know, or maybe it's just his karate instructor\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:43.000\nwhose voice you'll hear in a second is Russian or something.\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:47.000\nHe's speaking English, but with this Eastern European accent,\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:51.000\nand he's going to give Cody Heller this young man,\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:56.000\nhis purple belt in whatever martial art this is,\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:58.000\nand the guy is so...\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:00.000\nThis has nothing to do with my girlfriend or her name.\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:02.000\nIt's just like, that's how we found this random video,\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:04.000\nand I was just like so entranced by this.\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:08.000\nI wanted to share it with people because I'm so confused about this guy\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:13.000\nand his attitude about giving someone a purple belt,\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:14.000\nand also what you'll...\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:17.000\nYeah, so just listen to this guy.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:22.000\nOver here, training really hard.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:28.000\nYeah, I'm really proud to make him this level right now.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:31.000\nHis name is Cody. Come here, Cody.\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:33.000\nGive me this.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:35.000\nWhat?\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:38.000\nCome here, Cody.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:44.000\nOh, Cody.\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:47.000\nMaybe you, Cody.\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:55.000\nWhere's the camera?\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:59.000\nIt's like a casting porn video.\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:01.000\nI'm just going to pause it to say it, yeah.\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:05.000\nSo part of the visual is that this guy,\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:07.000\nthe karate instructor, I guess has a GoPro,\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:10.000\nmaybe like nestles in his gear.\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:13.000\nIt's in between my rope, Cody.\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:16.000\nI don't think he's being surreptitious.\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:18.000\nI think he just wanted to...\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:20.000\nHe just doesn't have a harness or...\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:23.000\nOh, I got a harness.\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:27.000\nI have a saddle and a whip, Cory.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:31.000\nSo really all you're seeing is the inside of a guy's coat,\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:33.000\nand if you're chopping carrots and listening to this,\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:36.000\nyou're not missing anything except this one thing.\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:40.000\nHe's about to tie the purple belt around Cody.\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:43.000\nAnd I don't...\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nDoes this guy...\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:48.000\nThis guy is either not the instructor\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:52.000\nor is so focused on the martial arts\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:55.000\nhe's never actually tied a belt before,\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:58.000\nbecause he starts to put it on.\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:05.000\nOkay, you've done enough, by the way,\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:07.000\nbelt-wise as far as I'm concerned,\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:10.000\nnow he keeps going.\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:13.000\nIt's better you can't hold it.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:17.000\nHe did weird stuff to the belt.\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:20.000\nThat's just all...\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:23.000\nHe hands it off to a guy who just ties it like a karate belt\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:26.000\nand then they hug, and then they hug.\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:28.000\nListen to him again.\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:31.000\nYour name is Cory. Come here, Cory.\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:34.000\nCome here, Cory. That's me.\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:38.000\nOh, oh, oh...\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:40.000\nCory, Cory.\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:43.000\nMy name is Cory.\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:47.000\nCory.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:50.000\nIt just sounds like he's up to something.\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:54.000\nIs that an Eastern European stereotype?\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:56.000\nIt's like if you have an Arkansas accent,\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:58.000\npeople are like, it's bad, we're closed minded,\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:00.000\nwe think you're dumb because you talk like this,\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:04.000\nbut is it like if you sound like Eastern European,\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:06.000\nyou sound like you're gonna fucking murder someone?\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:09.000\nThat's like that, guys, from the Alabama of...\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:13.000\nCory, come here.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:18.000\nYeah, no, we got your guns in the car.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:21.000\nWe never cut your head and hands off,\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:27.000\nso the fingerprints and teeth gotta be identified.\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:33.000\nI'm Greek, not Serbian.\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:35.000\nAll right, and I just wanted to share that.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:37.000\nI found this on my YouTube channel,\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:39.000\nand I don't know if I ever shared this with anybody.\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:40.000\nThis is from Forensic Files.\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:42.000\nAgain, if you're listening, just listen.\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:44.000\nThere's nothing visual that you have to...\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:47.000\nA poison that kills instantly.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:56.000\nAccording to forensic pathologist, Dr. John Butt.\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:59.000\nYou just don't get any simpler than that.\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:05.000\nWhat forensic files were they trying to get underneath?\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:06.000\nI don't think it was forensic files,\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:08.000\nbut that was, what's his name, the guy?\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:10.000\nIt was a poor man's forensic file.\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:15.000\nWhat was his name, the guy that they rescued him?\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:18.000\nAnd then here's the only other video clip.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:22.000\nBut again, totally audio-friendly for those of you fucking assholes\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:24.000\nthat just listen for free and complain.\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:26.000\nThis is from the movie...\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:29.000\nWhich one was Pierce Brosnan in Volcano or Dante's Peak?\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:31.000\nOh, Dante's Great Movies.\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:33.000\nSo, like, I don't know.\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:36.000\nEither do or don't name your characters Harry and Terry\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:39.000\nif you're in an action film.\n\n29:39.000 --> 30:05.000\nI saved the worst for last, I understand.\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:29.000\nWhat is your full name that you shortened to Harry?\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:33.000\nLet's go to one thought-provoking Twitter question.\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:36.000\nI'm so stoked about my technology.\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:40.000\nUgh, this fucking not-Dan Harmon guy keeps responding to everything.\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:42.000\nAlright.\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:48.000\nHow do you feel about LA vs. New York and the impassioned back and forth between us?\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:50.000\nIs there?\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:51.000\nWhat does that mean?\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:52.000\nIs there a rap?\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:54.000\nYou mean, like, with rap?\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:56.000\nNo, I think just hip-hop.\n\n30:56.000 --> 31:00.000\nI think just with the city's east coast is better than west coast.\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:02.000\nAlright, that's not a good question.\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:05.000\nThat wasn't a statement, that was a question.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:07.000\nWe don't get it.\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:11.000\nI think I got the clear to tell this story about Cody.\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:13.000\nI thought this was funny.\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:17.000\nWe do a lot of role-playing.\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:19.000\nOh, yeah, like Pathfinder?\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:20.000\nYeah.\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:22.000\nOh, you knock, shadow run.\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:24.000\nYeah, second edition, yeah.\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:28.000\nYou know, and it gets pretty violent.\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:29.000\nSexual.\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:30.000\nCreatives.\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:32.000\nRules heavy.\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:33.000\nLet's say taboo.\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:34.000\nBeautiful.\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:36.000\nYou're both writers, so it gets pretty...\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:38.000\nYou go to some dark forbidden places.\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:39.000\nYou kind of lose yourself.\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:43.000\nIn order to verify for our own animal brains that sex is happening.\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:44.000\nGot it.\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:47.000\nThere's visuals to this?\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:55.000\nNo, no, I just wanted to tell this story because I love my girlfriend so much.\n\n31:55.000 --> 32:01.000\nSo this really just made me really love her extra more.\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:03.000\nOkay, lay it on us Valentine.\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:04.000\nYeah, share with us.\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:05.000\nRight.\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:07.000\nShare with us, pal.\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:13.000\nWe were doing like a thing, a scene, sexually.\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:22.000\nAnd the construction of the scene had to do with the taboo age dynamic.\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:27.000\nShe was way older than you.\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:30.000\nIt was a young doctor and really old patient.\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:33.000\nI needed a college credit.\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:38.000\nDaniel, come on over here.\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:42.000\nMy rocket chair don't work so good anymore.\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:47.000\nIt's centered on a lack of experience on her part.\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:57.000\nI've never had sex before.\n\n32:57.000 --> 33:00.000\nI could go with any second time in my 90s.\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:04.000\nCould you please help a poor old lady out?\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:07.000\nCould you help a poor old lady out?\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:10.000\nAnd so hard right now.\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:14.000\nAnd she's fading out in her entire life.\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:15.000\nCould you help me?\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:21.000\nLet me put my teeth in.\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:27.000\nI'm not proud of, you know, that's why it's the bedroom and not the boardroom.\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:31.000\nAlthough we've done that, we've done that too when we talked about the boardroom.\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:35.000\nBut note to self, stay away from the star burns.\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:36.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:37.000\nThat was in Australia.\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:38.000\nTable.\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:42.000\nNo, no, stop it.\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:46.000\nI'm having my sandwich on the table here.\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:55.000\nDuring the taboo fantasy, I was like, well, if you ever done this before,\n\n33:55.000 --> 34:02.000\nand she was like, well, a couple times, I mean, four or five,\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:04.000\nand I was like, okay, and then I had more questions.\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:06.000\nI'm like, with whom?\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:12.000\nAnd then we went in and it was a kind of a circuitous path to then, you know,\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:13.000\njust like the boardroom.\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:15.000\nYeah.\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:19.000\nAnd then afterwards, you know, we like to review.\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:20.000\nGive notes.\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:21.000\nGive notes.\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:22.000\nRight.\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:24.000\nIt's not less notes, more accolades.\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:30.000\nI think it was like award ceremonies.\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:34.000\nWhen you said this, that was really good.\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:37.000\nI don't feel like your arc really would have done that.\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:38.000\nThat was really good.\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:39.000\nThat was really good.\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:40.000\nThank you for giving me a Latin surname.\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:42.000\nThere's not enough diversity in these scenarios.\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:43.000\nI really appreciate it.\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:45.000\nI was very proactive of you.\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:48.000\nYeah, we give each other little props and high fives.\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:53.000\nAnd I was like, what happened with the little loop of conversation?\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:59.000\nWhy was it so important the number of times that she had done this or that?\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:02.000\nAnd you went into all this detail and then I had questions.\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:05.000\nAnd she's like, oh, yeah, I just got, I had an internal logic bump there.\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:11.000\nLike, because, you know, I just felt like I, you know, the idea was I had never,\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:13.000\never done anything before.\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:16.000\nThen why would my blowjobs be so good?\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:18.000\nDamn.\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:20.000\nAnd she wasn't doing a bit.\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:26.000\nI was, I was like, are you like, she was like so, I mean, it's, yeah, I just,\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:28.000\nwe just want to justify.\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:29.000\nYeah.\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:33.000\nAnd for her, that's a matter of actual good writer, internal logic.\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:34.000\nYeah.\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:35.000\nYeah.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:36.000\nWhen ego fucks up role play.\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:37.000\nYeah.\n\n35:37.000

wouldn't have been like, wait a minute.\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:50.000\nBut because your character was not your character.\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:58.000\nYour character was old, experienced, old helicopter pilot, old helicopter pilot.\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:01.000\nOld helicopter pilot, brand new private in the military.\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:07.000\nJoshua Koppel asks on Twitter, is the community movie

great.\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:27.000\nWell, she didn't really murder people.\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:29.000\nI think she just stopped an elevator or something.\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:30.000\nI don't know.\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:31.000\nContinue.\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:32.000\nGood murder people.\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:35.000\nShe could have, but she was a good person.\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:38.000\nYou minus life equals corpse.\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:42.000\nAnd then they cloned her brain and made her into a Siri console.\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:44.000\nAnd they were like, everyone can use this.\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:46.000\nIt's a good show.\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:50.000\nDid the, did the, because the, is that a cape power?\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:51.000\nThe ability to make someone do a Siri?\n\n36:51.000 -->

let's not make that noise.\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:40.000\nOkay.\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:49.000\nWell, say her name, uh, the guy behind you tried his best to make a joke out of it, but\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:50.660\nthere's no jokes to be had.\n\n37:50.660 --> 37:54.000\nAre you certain, like the guy that with the guy that went bad?\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:59.440\nHe was just trying to help like yes, it was like I mean it was that it was the perfect joke, right?\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:04.520\nPerfect joke. It was also funny. Well, so it still it remains a mystery what happened to her\n\n38:04.520 --> 38:09.720\nBut you get did you know about the whole if you heard the elevator game the yeah\n\n38:10.240 --> 38:15.400\nThe the the I never knew that start from the beginning. I don't know what you're talking about Robin\n\n38:15.400 --> 38:17.560\nI the Roberts are in the dark. Yeah\n\n38:17.560 --> 38:22.960\nWell this young lady who stayed at this hotel, which is an ancillary fact\n\n38:22.960 --> 38:30.680\nIt adds to the to the spookiness of it that this hotel is downtown hotel the one that it's the one that I can't remember\n\n38:30.680 --> 38:32.680\nWhat it's called the downtown hotel\n\n38:37.240 --> 38:43.920\nYou know like apparently Richard Ramirez stayed there and I don't know Sherlock Holmes and broke his toe or something\n\n38:43.920 --> 38:48.400\nI don't know but the but she she stayed there and then she yeah\n\n38:48.400 --> 38:54.080\nThen they the what the well the facts of the story are that she was there then she disappeared\n\n38:54.080 --> 38:55.600\nShe was traveling alone\n\n38:55.600 --> 39:01.520\nShe was on some meds that she was then off it was then she was in she was staying in a room with some people who\n\n39:01.640 --> 39:08.180\nTestified to the fact that she she was kind of acting it in off her meds kind of way, but then she sorry sorry\n\n39:08.180 --> 39:14.340\nI don't like Mazel tov like yeah\n\n39:18.660 --> 39:23.100\nTwo Jewish people wanted to get married here, but just time for a Mazel tov\n\n39:25.220 --> 39:27.220\nParable time the\n\n39:27.380 --> 39:29.380\nWait for the middle of the sentence\n\n39:30.500 --> 39:33.220\nI'm treading lightly and every time someone says something out loud\n\n39:33.220 --> 39:35.340\nI'm like because we're in Los Angeles\n\n39:35.340 --> 39:40.620\nThis happens because there's 200 people in the room because you know statistically speaking there might be somebody who was a\n\n39:40.620 --> 39:44.060\nFriend of this person or whatever, but she was traveling. I don't think she was from LA, but\n\n39:44.740 --> 39:50.820\nBut anyways the so I'm trying not to be as crass as I might be if I was moving very fast telling this story like\n\n39:51.060 --> 39:53.580\ndehumanizing her but what happened is she disappeared and\n\n39:54.340 --> 40:00.380\nThen she was gone for a while and then people were like this water tastes bad from the hotel and this part\n\n40:00.380 --> 40:06.860\nThey eventually found her body in the water tower for the hotel. It was just floating in there for a long time and\n\n40:07.500 --> 40:12.860\nAnd so but then the video was released from the hotel the security video of her on the elevator\n\n40:12.860 --> 40:16.500\nI know you're talking about and she's befitting she's behaving very strangely in the elevator\n\n40:16.500 --> 40:20.180\nIt's very spooky and they and they edited it before it was released\n\n40:20.180 --> 40:24.980\nAnd there's just a lot of like very strange things about the video and their release of it and they're editing of it\n\n40:24.980 --> 40:28.500\nLike they changed the speed of it and if you and that they're yeah\n\n40:28.500 --> 40:34.140\nAnyways, one of those one of the curious things that came out of like the the DIY sleuth\n\n40:35.140 --> 40:40.180\nBoards that were analyzing this thing that I never knew about was this thing called the elevator game\n\n40:40.180 --> 40:43.420\nWhich is this whole elaborate thing where if you go into an elevator\n\n40:43.980 --> 40:50.460\nMillennials believe and you and you prep because they think that elevators just grew out of the ground\n\n40:51.460 --> 40:53.740\nThey were there they're post elevator children\n\n40:53.740 --> 40:59.140\nI mean when I when I was a kid, I don't believe mad elevators are magic because I saw them being invented\n\n41:01.300 --> 41:04.240\nWe called them pulley cars when I was your age\n\n41:05.780 --> 41:08.620\nMagical about them. I want to over to the fifth floor\n\n41:14.620 --> 41:20.220\nApparently there's an elevator game where it is like a urban legend thing where you you you press\n\n41:20.220 --> 41:25.180\nElevator buttons in a certain order and then it's got all these instructions. I wonder what's it?\n\n41:25.820 --> 41:27.820\nPlease tell me and then the devil come\n\n41:28.260 --> 41:35.540\nDevil and then the dangerous territory. I know I'm a little scared to just pop open. Okay, it's terrifying. Thank you look at my\n\n41:36.300 --> 41:42.700\nI don't want people to see my web history. It's still dangerous. I went to your search history. Australian accent tips.

That's a weird take on it\n\n42:53.100 --> 42:55.100\nElevator game stock is through the roof\n\n42:56.900 --> 43:02.580\nFloors to visit the player must stay in the elevator for the entirety of this game and press the following floor buttons in sequence\n\n43:02.580 --> 43:07.220\n1 4 2 6 2 10 5 1 the game rules state that if the ritual\n\n43:07.300 --> 43:13.980\nSucceeds when the player finally presses instead of going down to the first floor the elevator will read did a Korean write this the elevator\n\n43:13.980 --> 43:15.980\nWill return to the 10th floor\n\n43:15.980 --> 43:21.740\nAlternative world is the header of this next section the game goal is to access quote another world\n\n43:22.060 --> 43:27.140\nUnquote the 10th floor should lead to an alternative reality where nobody exists except for the player\n\n43:27.140 --> 43:32.780\nTravel back go there steps must be done in the same sequence then to the fifth floor\n\n43:32.780 --> 43:37.540\nThe then the final button will return the player to the first floor the game rules ask the player to check for small things to\n\n43:37.540 --> 43:40.980\nBe sure they are back in the real world the fifth floor ghost girl\n\n43:40.980 --> 43:43.900\nThat's what I was interested in at the fifth floor a girl could appear\n\n43:44.740 --> 43:46.740\nin person or disguised\n\n43:48.420 --> 43:54.500\nLuring the player the game rules state the girl must not be talked to that was the creepy thing that's not even in this thing\n\n43:54.500 --> 43:59.140\nHey, who are you on a specific floor? There's a girl. What's your name on this on a specific floor?\n\n43:59.140 --> 44:05.620\nThere's a girl that gets on the elevator and she says where are you going do not answer her something that's the creepy thing\n\n44:05.620 --> 44:07.620\nThat's fun, isn't it? Yeah\n\n44:08.700 --> 44:14.780\nAnyways, I just thought you know this elevator has the ability not not only to take you to another place\n\n44:14.780 --> 44:17.020\nBut also to conjure a ghost well\n\n44:17.020 --> 44:20.340\nAnd they and the full idea that I read about it was that at the end of this thing\n\n44:20.340 --> 44:25.260\nThe most you can accomplish is just you get to this alternate reality and you get to a floor\n\n44:25.260 --> 44:27.580\nAnd there's a door ahead of you, and you'll never make it to the door\n\n44:27.580 --> 44:33.940\nBut you know I think the best you can do is like walk for a while and then pass out and then you wake up in a random location\n\n44:34.460 --> 44:40.580\nSo that everybody's like a water water tower except for this young lady's parents who are like it's not a bit\n\n44:41.700 --> 44:44.380\nYeah, maybe someone killed her. All right\n\n44:45.020 --> 44:47.540\nYou know what I probably someone killed her I\n\n44:47.540 --> 44:50.820\nI can't people don't teleport into water towers\n\n44:52.940 --> 44:58.620\nIt's it's coming from the dungeon master. I know a lot about teleportation\n\n44:59.700 --> 45:06.020\nThe tough thing is that she was in there for so long that there's no possibility of any kind of like there she was she was this is\n\n45:06.020 --> 45:12.220\nThis is awful to say but there's no she you know, she was like she was sort of anything that could have provided a clue\n\n45:12.220 --> 45:16.860\nA significant decomposition. She was like yeah, she was sort of dissolved\n\n45:17.660 --> 45:21.340\nBathing in this and drinking this and they were those people all I mean\n\n45:21.340 --> 45:26.740\nI don't know what kind of settlements they got but they were drinking traveler for like days\n\n45:27.940 --> 45:34.860\nIt was like a sickly sweet odor in the thing and there was like you know just imagine they always say that about death sickly sweet\n\n45:34.860 --> 45:42.980\nYeah, it must be true Jesus\n\n45:43.100 --> 45:48.300\nWill we see any commentary on the 2016 election the Trump administration of Rick and Morty season 3?\n\n45:48.300 --> 45:53.460\nNo, we will not because it's so we were we just just just raced right out of that bit\n\n45:53.460 --> 46:00.060\nYeah, and it's up mouth. Do you think it's possible to ever really know another person at Julia 7 asks?\n\n46:00.060 --> 46:04.940\nDo you think it's possible to ever really know another person?\n\n46:06.500 --> 46:08.500\nNo\n\n46:09.260 --> 46:15.740\nBecause apparently a witch just like a like a home\n\n46:16.980 --> 46:18.980\nThe ghost girl\n\n46:18.980 --> 46:20.980\nYeah\n\n46:27.980 --> 46:29.980\nThere's a two-drink maximum tonight folks\n\n46:34.500 --> 46:40.660\nYou know what we could do I actually I have a lightning round of Twitter questions, and I thought I I could\n\n46:40.660 --> 46:48.620\nA lightning round what is the answer to the question we should ask you yes\n\n46:51.180 --> 46:53.300\nWhat's your favorite pastry and pinatas\n\n46:55.180 --> 46:58.780\nYeah using your socks as napkins that's cool right if you're alone\n\n47:00.860 --> 47:02.860\nMajor in college journalism\n\n47:03.700 --> 47:07.020\nWith a minor in psychology, but I dropped out halfway through my freshman year\n\n47:07.020 --> 47:13.100\nSo what it doesn't matter what is your advice to young writers who are scared to take chances in our nation's current political climate?\n\n47:14.140 --> 47:16.500\nWrite about being scared to take chances\n\n47:21.180 --> 47:24.380\nIs the Rick mobile real I think so yeah it seems to be\n\n47:25.620 --> 47:27.620\nKnight writer the A team night writer\n\n47:29.980 --> 47:34.300\nWhat's the project you've most enjoyed working on this show I think I like this show\n\n47:34.300 --> 47:37.940\nWhat happened to your elliptical periscope sessions fuck you all right\n\n47:39.780 --> 47:41.780\nNo, I'm gonna thank you for\n\n47:43.780 --> 47:45.900\nThank you Daffy what Daffy Woods\n\n47:47.060 --> 47:50.980\nIt's good that you had all those questions lined up for yourself there\n\n47:52.540 --> 47:54.540\nYeah, you couldn't get any for Rob\n\n47:55.820 --> 48:00.060\nYou got like nine people on stage we're listening to you answer questions. I\n\n48:00.060 --> 48:06.060\nMean you could have elaborated as well\n\n48:13.380 --> 48:19.380\nAll right, well I'll file I'll don't pick a topic that the you guys can join in on let's go to psychology\n\n48:20.580 --> 48:22.940\nAll right action and thought yes\n\n48:23.780 --> 48:26.180\nOn both of them. So my therapist\n\n48:26.180 --> 48:30.180\nMy therapist blew my mind on Friday. She said\n\n48:31.700 --> 48:33.700\nYour thoughts\n\n48:34.540 --> 48:40.860\nYou it will never lead to action your thoughts are kind of a well some of this I'm putting words in her mouth\n\n48:40.860 --> 48:45.980\nBut this is my interpretation of it your thoughts are kind of ever never gonna be more than kind of a\n\n48:46.900 --> 48:52.340\ncatalog and analysis of the of the of your experiences and behaviors like\n\n48:52.340 --> 48:57.700\nYou can't actually if so if you just keep thinking about action, it'll never result in action\n\n48:58.420 --> 49:01.740\nWhereas if you do things it'll result in new thought\n\n49:02.180 --> 49:07.340\nSo you have to act to create new thought you can't think to create new action and that really\n\n49:08.100 --> 49:11.540\nMade sense to me and also bummed me the fuck out because as with the elliptical thing\n\n49:11.540 --> 49:12.500\nThat's okay. It's like yeah\n\n49:12.500 --> 49:18.660\nI have to get on the elliptical the answer to what happened to the elliptical sessions is I stopped doing it because maybe a\n\n49:18.820 --> 49:21.900\nVacation or maybe a bad mood or a holiday or something\n\n49:21.900 --> 49:24.020\nSome excuse I had something that interrupted\n\n49:24.020 --> 49:29.580\nI can't get on the elliptical and then so that my behavior changed and then my thought changed and my thought never started\n\n49:29.580 --> 49:35.220\nAnd it is like the I have to just get on the goddamn elliptical at which point my thought will change again\n\n49:35.220 --> 49:40.980\nAnd it's kind of a bummer because you're like so I have so like you have to do shit that you don't really think\n\n49:41.060 --> 49:45.060\nAbout doing in order to think new stuff. That sucks\n\n49:45.060 --> 49:52.260\nYeah, or you you know because we're creatives we get shit on for not having a nine-to-five necessarily\n\n49:52.260 --> 49:56.900\nSo when we want to go to like to the beach or go thrift shopping or go do something that seems like it's\n\n49:57.820 --> 49:59.900\nAnti-productive we feel guilty\n\n49:59.900 --> 50:05.060\nBut the act of like getting up and walking around even if it's to do something that's kind of bullshit\n\n50:05.300 --> 50:12.260\nActually steers us back into writing and being creative. Well, we never get down. We never get taught that yeah where we skip\n\n50:12.260 --> 50:14.660\nIt keep your claps for creation\n\n50:15.700 --> 50:18.100\nYeah, yeah, motherfuckers should be at home writing right now\n\n50:21.220 --> 50:27.740\nDon't try to professionally procrastinate with me. I go see Dan Harmon. You should be writing in your journal\n\n50:30.460 --> 50:31.860\nSo it sucks\n\n50:31.860 --> 50:37.940\nBecause we get told like we want to fuck off and drink smoke a little pot do something on just a Tuesday at\n\n50:37.940 --> 50:43.420\nAt noon, but we get told that's shameful. You shouldn't do that, but it's actually yeah, that's garbage\n\n50:43.420 --> 50:46.940\nYeah, that's total garbage Cody just went through this. She's 12 years younger than me\n\n50:51.620 --> 50:55.820\nWhich is it's weird because her blowjobs are like a 50 year old that is\n\n50:57.740 --> 50:59.740\nBut the the\n\n51:01.540 --> 51:04.220\nSeems like you've done this 900,000 times the\n\n51:04.220 --> 51:08.580\nThe the the sheet but I'm why I'm because she's 12 years younger than me\n\n51:08.580 --> 51:14.820\nSo I'm kind of watching another writer go through a lot of shit that I have gone through and I'm I have my own problems, but\n\n51:15.820 --> 51:22.540\nBut but I I do know for sure like I tell it because I've watched first of all the fact that like, you know\n\n51:22.580 --> 51:24.980\nJust like like Dorothy Parker said I hate writing\n\n51:24.980 --> 51:29.060\nI love having written like that's which that she I watch her like\n\n51:29.060 --> 51:35.060\nLike hate the process and then she just need wants everybody to read her shit\n\n51:35.060 --> 51:40.860\nAnd like she gets this like fix for five seconds of like oh, I did a good job and then this crash\n\n51:41.380 --> 51:43.940\nbut also just like the endless\n\n51:44.780 --> 51:49.500\npunishment of the self for not writing which doesn't really make any sense because\n\n51:50.460 --> 51:56.940\nIt's like you you have to just like kind of be depressed a little bit. It is part of the process\n\n51:56.940 --> 52:00.140\nYou're like you're like a little cauldron or an oven\n\n52:00.140 --> 52:06.340\nYou're not going to be like a happy camper the whole time if you're making something that consists of of all of the\n\n52:06.780 --> 52:10.540\nEmotional things that human beings go through when they go through a story like\n\n52:11.220 --> 52:16.380\nPart of that is going to be you being all bummed out with yourself and like sleeping or playing video games or\n\n52:16.420 --> 52:20.780\nOr just getting high and like beating your head against a wall or watching Ben Affleck movies\n\n52:20.780 --> 52:24.100\nLike you're just doing all the things that people do to torture themselves\n\n52:24.100 --> 52:30.940\nThe the the you you do the the and like I but here's the crazy thing that happened\n\n52:31.100 --> 52:35.980\nLike Cody was like she wrote two scripts that were that were really good. She did it. She did her job\n\n52:35.980 --> 52:40.500\nShe she had had a deal to write these two scripts and she wrote them. She turned them in and and\n\n52:41.180 --> 52:45.900\nThey're like these are great. Can we get two more which is like their way of saying these two are great\n\n52:45.900 --> 52:47.500\nAnd I knew that would happen\n\n52:47.500 --> 52:48.300\nAnd then she's like okay\n\n52:48.300 --> 52:52.660\nI got to do two more and then she just and she was like I'll have them done tomorrow because she was on this high\n\n52:52.660 --> 52:57.340\nWhich is also fine to be wrong to be wrong about what you think you're gonna be able to do\n\n52:57.340 --> 52:59.060\nBut then and then she crashed. She's like wait\n\n52:59.060 --> 53:03.300\nI don't feel like writing anymore and then she was like I feel so sad and I was like you're supposed to feel sad\n\n53:03.300 --> 53:07.700\nJust lay there and it's like this weird conversation to have with somebody where they're like I feel sad\n\n53:07.700 --> 53:13.780\nI feel untalented. I feel not like doing anything. I feel like laying here like a lumped and to say to somebody\n\n53:14.460 --> 53:19.820\nThat's what you should be doing. That's what you should be feeling. How long do you recommend that goes on?\n\n53:19.820 --> 53:24.740\nI mean eventually you're gonna have to get back to work, right? I but it's a it's it's a couple weeks\n\n53:24.740 --> 53:29.380\nI don't know it kind of depends. It's the masterpiece race if you make a masterpiece\n\n53:29.380 --> 53:31.740\nIt could go on for the next 30 years, right?\n\n53:31.740 --> 53:35.220\nBecause it's so hard to turn that's true masterpiece in your lifetime\n\n53:35.500 --> 53:39.740\nBut if you're not if you haven't turned out a masterpiece your ass should probably wake up every day at 9\n\n53:42.180 --> 53:49.300\nBut she she she went through a couple weeks where she finally because her therapist and I were saying the same thing\n\n53:49.300 --> 53:51.540\nWhich is like you're fine. You're doing what you're supposed to do\n\n53:51.540 --> 53:53.980\njust lay there like a lump and watch forensic files and\n\n53:54.660 --> 53:59.180\nAnd that's what we did for weeks and then the really funny thing was that at the end of it\n\n53:59.380 --> 54:04.620\nShe she got up one morning and she was like I gotta get out of here\n\n54:04.620 --> 54:08.420\nI gotta go I gotta go somewhere and I got I got a I got a right\n\n54:08.420 --> 54:11.540\nI think I'm gonna go into a hotel for a couple days and I immediately was like\n\n54:11.540 --> 54:17.740\nWhat's the fuck? It took me a whole day to realize I was I was like, I'm sorry\n\n54:17.740 --> 54:23.660\nI didn't like cuz it was like I had become the cocoon and so for her to finish\n\n54:23.660 --> 54:29.020\nIt's it's not like a butterfly goes like I'm stoked about being in a cocoon\n\n54:29.780 --> 54:31.780\nSlippity-doodle fly in a way\n\n54:32.660 --> 54:34.660\nDo we have to pay for that if I said that in the stream?\n\n54:34.660 --> 54:41.140\nThat the the but of course you're gonna be like the first thing that you're gonna do isn't gonna be like\n\n54:41.140 --> 54:44.940\nI feel like writing you're gonna be like frustrated and go like god damn it\n\n54:44.940 --> 54:48.820\nI fucking can't stand it anymore, which is different from I feel so dead\n\n54:48.820 --> 54:52.940\nI feel like I can't do anything those are two different things if you feel irritation\n\n54:53.700 --> 54:58.300\nThat's like a coming out of an egg or a chrysalis. You're like look fuck. I can't fuck it\n\n54:58.300 --> 55:04.540\nYou should follow that impulse like I want out of here. I want to go do something\n\n55:04.740 --> 55:07.220\nEven if that thing isn't writing you got to go do that\n\n55:07.220 --> 55:13.500\nBut I at the time the funny thing is that I my immediate reaction was like fuck you you get a warning me about this stuff\n\n55:13.500 --> 55:16.620\nYou can't just decide you're gonna go check out and then I was like wait a minute\n\n55:16.620 --> 55:20.220\nWhat am I what did I expect? How did I expect this process to end? I am the cocoon\n\n55:20.220 --> 55:25.340\nI'm gonna get ripped apart and she's gonna leave me to go be a butterfly for a second\n\n55:25.340 --> 55:29.220\nI'll write a script over the weekend and probably fuck a hundred dudes\n\n55:31.860 --> 55:34.820\nWith the pro with the professional ability of a 50 year old\n\n55:40.100 --> 55:47.540\nAnyways action and thought so tomorrow even though I don't think I'm going to I'm going to get back on the elliptical\n\n55:47.540 --> 55:50.740\nAnd then I'm going to like think that I should get up because when I was on that\n\n55:50.740 --> 55:57.860\nIt took no time at all for me to be like I would be like late for meetings because my compulsion was\n\n55:58.060 --> 56:04.460\nTo get on the elliptical once I was doing it's just like Newtonian laws like you if you're doing it\n\n56:04.460 --> 56:09.820\nYou tend to keep doing it if you stop you tend to stay stop stopped and I'm not being one of those preachy\n\n56:10.900 --> 56:14.060\nexercise people on my not to my my listeners, but\n\n56:14.060 --> 56:21.420\nThat's the sad thing is like you got to just like do some crazy if that's what this podcast turned into\n\n56:22.860 --> 56:27.900\nIt's like a health health podcast like a like it. Well, I mean\n\n56:29.020 --> 56:35.940\nI just started change fighting with Joe Rogan. Yeah, I just pushing like vitamins. Yeah, you got to take your\n\n56:37.940 --> 56:39.940\nGNC brought to you\n\n56:39.940 --> 56:45.300\nI'm telling you bulletproof. I'm drinking these ginseng Vicodin shakes\n\n56:47.660 --> 56:54.120\nMy my my I was losing my hair, but now there's dicks growing out of my head. I'm like it's called the Medusa zone\n\n56:56.460 --> 56:58.660\nAnd you got to do it you got to go through this process\n\n56:58.660 --> 57:03.420\nYou got to have a hundred dicks growing out of your head jerk them all off and then come you got to keep that come\n\n57:03.420 --> 57:04.980\nAnd put it in the freezer\n\n57:04.980 --> 57:07.580\nBecause it's not come it's vitamins keep that come\n\n57:07.580 --> 57:11.420\nGot to keep that come. It's not come. It's vitamins. Yep\n\n57:15.820 --> 57:19.720\nAnd another thing I've been talking to Cody about cuz\n\n57:21.740 --> 57:26.140\nLike it's the it for those of you who are actively writing I\n\n57:26.660 --> 57:31.940\nHere's something and I've never really that took me like 20 years to figure out you you you know\n\n57:31.940 --> 57:34.900\nThere's two modes of writing which is like sometimes I equate to\n\n57:34.900 --> 57:40.580\nSometimes you're the chess piece and sometimes you're the chess player like sometimes you're like you have to like get immersed in your own\n\n57:40.580 --> 57:48.260\nShit and that can be counterproductive because you should be thinking structurally like so you all know if you if you've ever tried to write\n\n57:48.260 --> 57:51.420\nThat you know you get stuck on page one because anything can happen\n\n57:51.420 --> 57:57.700\nAnd you're like what the fuck supposed to happen and with you know at that point you should be thinking structurally like more macro\n\n57:57.700 --> 58:02.820\nBut she also don't want to just be a hack. That's like well every story is like this and it goes like that like\n\n58:02.820 --> 58:10.340\nthe magic happens inside the story so what I'm just realizing watching Cody work is that I\n\n58:10.660 --> 58:18.500\nThink that I've been making a mistake of thinking that you're supposed to think structurally up until a point where your structure is done\n\n58:18.500 --> 58:20.500\nAnd then you're supposed to think\n\n58:20.900 --> 58:22.900\nimmersively\n\n58:22.900 --> 58:24.340\nImmersively\n\n58:24.340 --> 58:31.300\nYeah, but but you may never finish that structural work because it may start to generate all kinds of question marks and you actually find your structural\n\n58:31.300 --> 58:36.620\nInspiration by going into your shitty fucked up structural story\n\n58:36.620 --> 58:41.540\nAnd like living in it as a passenger where you can clearly see what's going wrong\n\n58:41.540 --> 58:46.620\nSo like I think the better metaphor now that I'm landing on is it's like it's like\n\n58:47.300 --> 58:54.540\nTrain tracks is the structure like you could you could say willy-nilly and probably should be more willy and nilly in\n\n58:54.780 --> 58:57.740\nStructure because you don't want to waste too much time on structure\n\n58:57.740 --> 59:01.620\nJust say for instance, this is gonna go from Chicago to Philadelphia\n\n59:01.620 --> 59:04.780\nThat's like saying like boy meets girl boy and loses girl boy\n\n59:04.780 --> 59:10.420\nThat's like like you just like whatever your story your basic story is knowing that it's gonna change like it's just a plan\n\n59:10.420 --> 59:12.420\nIt's gonna go from Chicago to Philadelphia\n\n59:12.420 --> 59:15.820\nYou could if you really don't have any further passion about it\n\n59:15.820 --> 59:20.100\nI guess you could get meticulous and go and it's gonna go over this river and all this stuff\n\n59:20.100 --> 59:25.740\nBut you're still just thinking structurally and the truth is the thing that makes your movie TV show poem\n\n59:25.740 --> 59:30.220\nwhatever you're working on good is stuff that happens inside a train car and\n\n59:30.820 --> 59:37.740\nLike some stuff makes use of the fact that you can tell you're on a train call that maybe meta or like\n\n59:38.940 --> 59:41.100\nHigh concept or something where it's like wow\n\n59:41.100 --> 59:46.140\nI can really feel the structure as I'm riding in this train car, but then other stuff is like I didn't even know\n\n59:46.140 --> 59:49.740\nI was on a train. Yeah, because they just said it goes from Chicago to Philadelphia\n\n59:49.740 --> 59:55.740\nAnd it's level the whole time and it's quiet and but but really it's just like a thing that happens inside a box car\n\n59:56.580 --> 59:59.900\nLike so and I think that you have to I think we have to\n\n01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:04.460\nGo back and forth. I think you have to lay track or lay plans for track\n\n01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:08.740\nAnd then you got to get in the car and then go okay Chicago to Philadelphia\n\n01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:10.740\nLet's see how that works and let it be like\n\n01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:18.860\nScreech fucked up that just makes no sense and then change it from to Chicago to Florida or because that's a city, right? The the\n\n01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:25.420\nIt's the story of a person who failed geography becoming a writer and telling people what to do the the\n\n01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:31.820\nThe the you you change the generalities because they're easy to change then you get back in just I think it's more\n\n01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:39.740\nIt's important not to have an end goal when you're working on structure or when you're working within you got to get out of either\n\n01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:45.620\nIt's almost like I don't know what to do with this new epiphany. How are you doing? Rob? You having a good time?\n\n01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:51.620\nYes, okay. No, this is good. This is really good stuff. Okay. I was I was I couldn't tell if you were listening\n\n01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:56.260\nSometimes you're the one who invents a new structure\n\n01:00:56.260 --> 01:01:00.700\nIt's almost like you have to say it's set like an egg timer kind it's kind of thing where it's like, okay\n\n01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:02.420\nI worked on structure now\n\n01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:05.460\nI have to force myself to do that thing where I'm like, yeah\n\n01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:10.820\nBut what does Mikey feel like in the in the scene? But then you have to also not get sucked into that for too long\n\n01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:13.420\nBecause that'll drive you nuts. Yeah, so it's like you have to go back and forth\n\n01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:20.340\nIt's like if you were building a tube you would want to be outside the tube and inside the tube at equal amounts of time\n\n01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:25.060\nYou don't want to spend too much time like tube constructing. Are there any tube workers here?\n\n01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:31.500\nAnybody work on tubes because there's shit for on the inside of the tube that you're not even gonna realize till you get in there\n\n01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:35.380\nYou're like, oh man, I didn't know I was making this out of so what's the transition like between?\n\n01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:42.420\nMoving from inside the tube to outside the tube. I don't well, I mean it's\n\n01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:46.140\nNo, what is that? No for real? I'm not making a joke\n\n01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:51.540\nWell, I kind of feel like you could characterize it as like working on a white board or with note cards versus like actually sitting at the\n\n01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:56.260\nKeyboard and like like where you're typing dialogue. That's an easy distinction. That's kind of how I\n\n01:01:56.260 --> 01:02:02.020\nCharacterize it, but that could be different for other people because I feel like when I sit down and start typing dialogue\n\n01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:08.540\nI'm like inside the thing right and so I'm actually like I might jump from character to character\n\n01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:14.100\nBut I'm but I'm actually sealed within the reality. You're not building it. You're smoothing it out, right?\n\n01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:18.100\nBut then there's but then if I'm standing at a whiteboard, you know, it's like, okay\n\n01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:24.420\nWhat should happen, you know, then you're having these like weird conversations that God has about people like what if\n\n01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:32.020\nWhat if a bunch of people got cancer hearty-har-har? I'm God. I don't give a fuck. Do you use do you do you structure like\n\n01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:40.380\nPer scene or just the whole the whole thing the whole story like if you're working on like oh, I've got to work on this scene today\n\n01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:46.260\nDo you structure out the scene and then go in? No, I'm not what what am I productive? I don't know\n\n01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:50.460\nNo, I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't have a process yet\n\n01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:57.460\nI I like whatever we worked in TV on community and Rick and Morty like the thing that that the\n\n01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:00.380\nnature of the beast becomes\n\n01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:07.460\nBreak the story and then take the broken story and send it to outline and then take the outline and send it to script\n\n01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:10.940\nAnd I kind of and but then we end up re-breaking everything\n\n01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:18.940\nWe always end up re-breaking and then and we look at that as like a crime like we're like Andy Bobrow was the fire marshal\n\n01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:24.100\nFor an uncommunity like they think because it was like some fire\n\n01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:28.340\nParamount like building code thing like he was the official fire fire\n\n01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:32.140\nStewart or something like he was the guy whose job it was to know when there was a fire\n\n01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:38.080\nSo they paramount like showed him a closet where there was an orange vest and two cones or two\n\n01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:42.620\nThis is serious. Yeah, and he would but he would he would of course there was never a fire\n\n01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:49.260\nBut he would he would grab them when there was a re-break and he would run down the halls of paramount and go re-break\n\n01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:52.580\nMade me feel like shit\n\n01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:57.260\nBecause the joke was on me because it was we work on a psycho show\n\n01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:00.260\nThere's a re-break happening\n\n01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:06.420\nWhy can't you why can't you just air I can't you just air what we wrote yesterday and get an Emmy you fucking\n\n01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:08.860\nnarcissist\n\n01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:14.140\nFucking dumb fat blowhard. Is that you or Bob, bro?\n\n01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:20.020\nIt's Dan. I think it's Dan. I'm not gonna call Andy Bobrow a big fat blowhard\n\n01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:26.580\nThis I told I told Brandon to\n\n01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:30.140\nYeah, I told Brandon to make a face\n\n01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:35.260\nThe face of someone who had been told they were the culture icon\n\n01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:41.860\nDan was working so hard on this before that's why we were so late. No, that's not that's not\n\n01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:50.820\nThat's not we were sure we were waiting along with you upstairs. Yeah, we were waiting on Steve Levy. Yeah, Steve Levy's fault\n\n01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:56.740\nCan we get a pillow for Steve? He's just like hanging out\n\n01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:01.060\nHe looks good he looks sad\n\n01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:04.940\nLonely health care. Oh nice. Oh\n\n01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:08.580\nI texted this dispenser and then I saved it because I thought it was a good observation\n\n01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:12.020\nConservatives act like socialism is the opposite of capitalism\n\n01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:18.060\nBut their whole perception of poor people is inherently socialist because they expect their pursuit of happiness to generate so much revenue that even the people\n\n01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:20.260\nThey fuck over have less to gain by slitting their throats\n\n01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:23.820\nThat's one big fucking federal program and that funding just got cut\n\n01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:29.620\nBecause poor people are mad and they're gonna get sick and they're getting sick in both parties\n\n01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:32.300\nAnd we're we're in a real fucking emergency situation here\n\n01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:36.300\nLike these are the beginning this health care thing seems like something you've been hearing about your whole life\n\n01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:42.460\nBut the what the the the the thresholds that have been crossed now are like so fucking official like like it's like\n\n01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:48.660\nIt really is let them eat cake like feudal Europe level shit like like to say\n\n01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:55.980\nThat because underneath all this stuff people act like they're arguing about math and concepts and philosophies because no one is going to\n\n01:05:55.980 --> 01:06:03.180\nProfit or live through the day by saying what's really happening, which is rich people are just saying look times are tough all over\n\n01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:09.060\nLiving long is a is a luxury. It's like cable TV\n\n01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:10.820\nTeslas\n\n01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:13.740\nYour kid going to college. These are these are privileges\n\n01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:19.380\nAnd you should either be born rich if you want those things or you should work really fucking hard or get really lucky\n\n01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:23.540\nAnd that's what capitalism is and like I don't see why you people are bitching so much and why we should have to pay for your\n\n01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:28.820\nYour aides and your cancer and and I'm tired like when I went to Fiji it was like\n\n01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:35.420\nLike like the life expectancy of the people that work by the pool is like fucking 20 years less\n\n01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:39.100\nThey got great water that that that that in spite of the great water\n\n01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:43.940\nI love that one real thing if you if you look I'll pay extra for their water\n\n01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:48.300\nYeah, the waters if you look at third-world countries that have resort sentiment stuff\n\n01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:55.140\nIt's just like that is the way that your Republican congressmen see the future like they they\n\n01:06:55.420 --> 01:07:01.980\nDon't see a problem with the idea that being poor should equate to a 20 year less lifespan\n\n01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:06.060\nlike like like and that's what's really being said to you right now is\n\n01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:13.140\nIs yeah enough's enough like like like we lived in La La Land a long enough of this idea that that everyone was going to have\n\n01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:16.220\nCoverage if you get cancer in your poor then you're gonna die\n\n01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:18.860\nThat's that is the real conversation that's happening\n\n01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:23.060\nAnd I don't know why I'm lecturing you like you don't know that but I just say like like like I just want to say it out\n\n01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:27.340\nLoud because like some of us I think we're walking around going is that what's really being said right now or\n\n01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:31.420\nBecause we're so used to this chatter of like oh, I think so\n\n01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:35.860\nIowa senator so-and-so just said the blah blah blah\n\n01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:38.620\nBecause it's called this senator\n\n01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:42.580\nIt's like we kind of like are still in this mode where we're calling each other out on semantics\n\n01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:48.420\nBut we've gotten to a point where the semantics don't matter the actual fundamental thought that's being\n\n01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:53.020\nCould communicate it to us is that they actually think that you should die\n\n01:07:53.100 --> 01:08:00.180\nThey're actually telling you to fuck off and die and and they're saying it in different ways and people are at town halls going\n\n01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:04.260\nYou're telling us to fuck off and die we see you we hear you\n\n01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:10.860\nThat's what you're saying and they're running out of the town halls and hiding and they just they just did this thing anyway in spite\n\n01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:16.500\nThey're saying like what they're just going they're just doing what they were going to do anyway. It's fucking insane\n\n01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:18.900\nI I I I\n\n01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:21.220\nHave no solutions as usual\n\n01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:25.620\nResist we have solutions\n\n01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:30.580\nDo you have any idea how much harder it is to do what they just done for the last two months that it is to call for\n\n01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:36.220\nImpeachment like Google Bill Clinton impeach like like like they fucking know how to do this shit\n\n01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:44.740\nDemocrat Republican Congress people know how to move to impeach. It's not that difficult like like and everyone is just\n\n01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:50.940\nThey they're just holdovers from a different time. I don't know what to do. Do we grab pitchforks? We're they're killing us\n\n01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:57.300\nThey're gonna kill us we continue to monetize the Democratic push for 2018. We take Congress back\n\n01:08:57.580 --> 01:09:05.620\nWe all can write legislation. That's the great thing about America is that any one in this room could write a bill and then push it\n\n01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:09.660\nIf you would start at your state level, so we are kind of fucked\n\n01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:15.500\nBut we we do outnumber them there is hope we are learning am I right?\n\n01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:18.180\nAre we learning how to also here in, California?\n\n01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:27.340\nEspecially because we have one of the largest GDPs in the world number six like yeah number six guys six\n\n01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:30.660\nThat's pretty good\n\n01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:37.780\nSo that that actually commands a lot of power you talking about California. Yeah, California. Yeah\n\n01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:41.060\nYeah, I want to like I wait every time I talk about politics\n\n01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:46.220\nWe end up realizing the solution is to act locally clean up our own shit and then set an example for the outlying territories\n\n01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:52.220\nBut yeah, like fucking California should like just become we don't have to secede\n\n01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:59.300\nWe can functionally secede by being the only state in the union that's in the black say is is right on the money\n\n01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:03.060\nThis is succession people right, but I mean come on\n\n01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:04.500\nIt's just not well\n\n01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:10.920\nIt's like why but I think it's just like an extreme thing they say to to let's talk about these issues\n\n01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:12.820\nand\n\n01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:19.980\nMy producing partner came up with a great idea. He's I knew the lawyers you were doing wasn't so low\n\n01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:23.100\nI knew it. I got a good one going on. I\n\n01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:28.300\nHave a part there's always I have a partner to\n\n01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:40.260\nHe is doing a he's right. He's having a lawyer draw up a ballot initiative right now to rid\n\n01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:43.460\nCalifornia's pension\n\n01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:49.900\nFund of all everything. It's not SRIs socially responsible investments and\n\n01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:52.500\nAnd that will fuck\n\n01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:57.740\nFuck the whole world if we do that, you know what I mean, okay?\n\n01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:03.060\nNo, because there's a lot in tobacco and then\n\n01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:08.180\nThank you. Love it. The rest of the oil and oil and stuff\n\n01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:14.100\nIf we stop if the sixth largest GDP in the country stops investing in\n\n01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:18.300\noil and tobacco and things like that then\n\n01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.660\nThen there that will send a message\n\n01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.500\nThat's the only way to\n\n01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:30.660\nTo have the rest of the country give a fuck about us. I wish there was a way that California could have its own health\n\n01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:36.980\nThey're pushing for single play single pair. So California will eventually have its own\n\n01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:43.700\nHealth play like health plan system. So I know I know that people are really trying like you said Rob of\n\n01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:47.700\nMaking California be the place that people learn how to do\n\n01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:54.020\nThings across the country and that that can happen because we're sort of light years ahead of the country as we should\n\n01:11:55.100 --> 01:12:02.060\nLike the the the amazing thing would be California as the liberal version of the Iron Bank and Game of Thrones that we're just like\n\n01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:06.580\nThat with every state that starts to go bankrupt because of free market\n\n01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:11.220\nD-regulation and then and their rivers start to be filled with bloodthirsty scorpions\n\n01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:14.220\nLike they come to us and we come out in robes and go like\n\n01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:20.420\nHmm. Well, let's open the books like ideally looks like you have three congressmen that are Nazis\n\n01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.780\nLike I don't think that's a good investment for us\n\n01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:27.620\nI recall it was you back to your people and have some rallies and clean up your\n\n01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:32.260\nState because we have an election coming up and California doesn't want to live in shit land\n\n01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:35.900\nYou failed to legalize marijuana. Is that true?\n\n01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:37.900\nYeah\n\n01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:42.420\nBut you know California\n\n01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:49.540\nLike like, you know, we're the blueest state in the Union and you still saw the numbers like what out of three out of ten people at\n\n01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:52.580\nYour traitor Joe's like secretly voted for Trump\n\n01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:58.300\nIt's like I'm sure those people aren't really like at Trader Joe's in Los Angeles, but no no\n\n01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:00.300\nThey traded Joe's that\n\n01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:04.180\nEmpire Trader Joe's it's like\n\n01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:06.180\nYeah, Trader Jethro's\n\n01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:12.020\nGarlic stuffed meth\n\n01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:17.580\nOrganic\n\n01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:21.700\nBut yeah, I\n\n01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:25.660\nIt sucks because we were chilling man, and now we all got to get busy\n\n01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:31.940\nYeah, it's such a great time. We were having a great time. We're having such a good time. We were having a good time\n\n01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:34.900\nAll right, but but yeah, aren't you worried about the\n\n01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:39.260\nBetter off like like better off now\n\n01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:41.980\nAre you are you enough?\n\n01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:49.660\nYou're not a Trump supporter, but but you're you're better off now because we're energized\n\n01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:53.940\nYeah, now you now you're involved\n\n01:13:53.940 --> 01:14:00.180\nOh man\n\n01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:03.740\nCome on all means interrupt them\n\n01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:08.060\nSomething that does concern me or that I see it coming\n\n01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:13.460\nI was like I think there's gonna be a bunch of Republicans or Liberty Libertarians that that in the next couple years\n\n01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:18.580\nThey're gonna start receding to a position of they're gonna go. We're just ruptokons like we\n\n01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:23.300\nWe didn't we never supported Trump or believed that he was good for the country\n\n01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:28.340\nWe just saw that you libtard snowflakes needed some shaking up and we were right about that\n\n01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:31.660\nAnd I can't wait to spit in their face and like I\n\n01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:37.380\nLike yeah, I'm just so panicked about it's the it's the whole Bernie Hillary holdover\n\n01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:43.460\nIt's this it's the Socialist versus the the Liberals like what the the this thing of like I\n\n01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:46.380\nIt's like the Republican Party got hacked\n\n01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:53.340\nDecimated and then repair it break right now. They're like suturing through their greed\n\n01:14:53.500 --> 01:15:01.580\nThey're like coalescing and going like but at the end of the day we love money and they're and they're they're solidifying and the\n\n01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:04.100\nDemocrats are going like\n\n01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:11.380\nRemember that thing you said on that March motherfucker like like we're we're we're in danger of further fragmentation\n\n01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:18.540\nIn in a way, but it's like and it's this whole conundrum where you're like you want to fight the Death Star and\n\n01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:20.500\nThere's no better way to do it\n\n01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:26.860\nIt seems by then by constructing a bigger space station that can destroy more planets and how do you do that?\n\n01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:32.220\nExcept well, we should have more black in our costumes and we should and it's and then there's the people that keep going\n\n01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:37.660\nWhat are we doing? Stop? Yeah, like like one of the issues is that we didn't I think the left didn't know\n\n01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:43.380\nUm, how fragmented it was it is I think a lot of people on that side assumed\n\n01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:48.860\nThat we had gotten past some things like racism and misogyny and what we're learning about ourselves\n\n01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:53.380\nI think is that there's still a lot of bullshit in our own party. So it's hard for us to come together\n\n01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:58.380\nI said and we're also learning. I hope that it's called fucking\n\n01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:03.500\npolitics and democracy because if the issues are\n\n01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:10.460\nSuper fundamental and you're fighting for things that are as fundamental as like almost like people should have water\n\n01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:15.580\nThen that means the war you're fighting is between armies so big a\n\n01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:20.740\nHuge majority of the people fighting side-by-side with you are gonna be fucking stupid\n\n01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:23.580\nBecause most people are dumb\n\n01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:30.740\nSo if you're waiting for a political party that's going to one be all smart people and to win\n\n01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:32.460\nthen\n\n01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:39.980\nYou're a fucking idiot. That's just on the sidelines like statler and Waldorf just going like oh more like muppet stupid\n\n01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:41.580\nlike\n\n01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:46.060\nI'm just not impressed by that anymore like I used to be one of those guys, you know\n\n01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:52.100\nI was like I was like a fucking like weird third-party the guy and now I'm like fucking cucked out and then\n\n01:16:52.100 --> 01:17:02.700\nLike I'm I'm I'm lipped up and damped down and cut down and live down. I'm eating that Hillary pussy and fucking\n\n01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:08.780\nLike I don't know man. I'm just because I'm just like fucking we gotta cuz I nothing\n\n01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:16.100\nIt's the thing that shook me up my fragile straight white like like egg shell was yeah the idea that oh\n\n01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:21.860\nSo if I just keep sitting here and going you know why that's stupid, you know why that doesn't make sense\n\n01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:26.620\nYou know, I all I need is a blaster by my side. I don't believe in no force\n\n01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:35.980\nThat if I keep doing that I'm gonna end up living in a universe controlled by lizard people like and then that's no good for my smuggling neither\n\n01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:42.140\nAnd so I'm so I'm just like yeah, I was like I'm not just gonna like keep going\n\n01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:47.860\nAt the end of the movie. I need to like actually like notarized. Yeah, I don't know fucking\n\n01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:55.340\nI just like I'm just like I have a men's to make and I was like, okay, I'll fucking sorry\n\n01:17:55.340 --> 01:18:00.740\nI keep flickering remember that thoughts and action thing. This is a great place to merge all that. Yeah, so\n\n01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:03.580\nSo I went to I went to that one March\n\n01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:09.180\nYeah, I came up with this great story\n\n01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:13.020\nWell, we're gonna well we have here at star burns with the at the castle\n\n01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:19.100\nYou know, this is one room where we take will be streaming this show and then as things go from bad to worse\n\n01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:23.700\nWe'll keep meeting here on Sunday and Burbank and it's bright off of all the freeways\n\n01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:27.620\nSo, you know, like, you know, this is a good apocalypse like\n\n01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:33.020\nI think we're outside a nuke range if they hit yeah, we're downwind\n\n01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:40.420\nRight and there's a garage this place used to be a trucker garage. We shot an amelisa here next door\n\n01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:42.420\nbut with a little puppets but\n\n01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:47.100\nMy plan is and don't abuse this don't tell anybody outside this room.

It's like oh, you're the weaker person because you you slobber on my knobber\n\n01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:04.660\nWe're so sick\n\n01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:08.020\nWe're so sexist that it makes us homophobic\n\n01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:11.100\nBut but but then I but then I and I know this isn't a technical issue\n\n01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:15.860\nBut I don't know how else to talk about it other than that but it's like but but then I go like well wait a minute\n\n01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:23.260\nNo, there's two guys so someone's getting their dick sucked and it's not the way it's not the stronger person necessarily like there is no inherent\n\n01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:29.260\nTo say two politicians that happen to be male neither of them has a vagina no that like if they're like oh\n\n01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:34.060\nTrump well Trump wasn't a well of course wasn't gonna vote that way in the UN because of course\n\n01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:40.620\nHe's all up in Putin's butt or he's sucking Putin's cock is I mean what it is will break that down for me\n\n01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:42.340\nJust for the sake of it\n\n01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:47.980\nThe deal is that if we had a great deal of respect for people who suck cocks to begin with\n\n01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:56.220\nThat joke wouldn't play but because we always always put down the person right because we never say he's eating her out\n\n01:24:56.860 --> 01:25:03.220\nWell, we never we don't say we don't we don't say oh the prime minister of this is like obviously eating her pussy\n\n01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:05.500\nLike we don't say that right and then when you\n\n01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:10.940\nIt's the craziest thing to hear a man talk about how he got a deal on a car\n\n01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:16.860\nOr how you got a deal on a house in front of his wife or his girlfriend because he'll be like man\n\n01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:21.480\nI was supposed to pay $10,000, but I only paid $8,000.

I don't understand this or that or that that area\n\n01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:46.560\nI think that's what really scared us comedically\n\n01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:54.560\nphilosophically and it threatens some kind of deep state and it's a money train is back in the day was in the 70s\n\n01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:57.800\nThey monetize talking about race and gender and rape and things like that\n\n01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:02.780\nI'm gonna unplug this now. They sort of were like we want money, but we don't want money by alienation\n\n01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:08.320\nSo they're they're more likely to turn on a product that is appeasing to all people that doesn't start any controversy\n\n01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:11.220\nIn the 70s. They were like there's money in controversy. I\n\n01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.120\nCall my girlfriend the n-word constantly\n\n01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:17.120\nBut does she act like that?\n\n01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:31.720\nDid we get the lights the lights got brighter because that joke was so great I\n\n01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:37.520\nDo want to confess that and I don't know if I'll stop or not\n\n01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:39.620\nI have to look within myself, but it's like it's thing\n\n01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:44.120\nI mean we do with my girlfriend and I do so much fucked up shit that we could that I could never share\n\n01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:50.280\nNo matter how honest our society got like the things that we say when we have sex the things that we\n\n01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:56.840\nGet up to the things that way I find that you know what my my relationship with McGathey was very public\n\n01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:01.680\nIt was a public marriage. It was a public divorce. It was a public like we were we were pretty\n\n01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.240\ntransparent about every thought and feeling we had and then with with Cody\n\n01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:10.820\nIt's like well Cody doesn't want to be on a podcast and when we we're like we're private like we\n\n01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:15.700\nWe like I I'm starting to appreciate the concept of privacy\n\n01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:21.900\nAnd I and I and I but I but I want to admit that that like yeah\n\n01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:28.220\nI mean it's like it's a I if there was a more horrible word than it then I would call her that when we were taught\n\n01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:30.900\nWhat I was like like do you want to get a sandwich, but you know like\n\n01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:34.620\nlike and it and I I I\n\n01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:41.020\nI know that words aren't magical, but I but I I think the difference is like when you're\n\n01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:46.860\nThe things that we get up to in public when we're talking when we're communicating in public the purpose of language is to\n\n01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:50.060\nShare each other's minds and to avoid\n\n01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:55.940\nMisunderstanding and so when we have arguments about technical rules about language in public\n\n01:28:55.940 --> 01:29:00.940\nWe're kind of defeating the purpose of language which is to be understood and to gain each other's trust like we we\n\n01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:06.340\nAnd that and that's a that's another thing that I've like that where I used to be a different kind of guy\n\n01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:08.180\nI used to be this whole like\n\n01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:12.420\nIf somebody said this word or that word is like should be taken off the menu\n\n01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:17.220\nI would immediately leap to the place if this is a slippery slope and first amendment\n\n01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:19.780\nYou have to be able to express yourself, but it's like over time\n\n01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:25.340\nHey, maybe maybe I get tired and sold out and whatever but I think it's more like well wait a minute\n\n01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:31.140\nWe were never talking about legality. Nobody that ever said that this word offends me ever wanted to actually pass a law\n\n01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:37.420\nKeeping you from being able to say anything. They're only saying this hurts me and that's their first amendment, right?\n\n01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:42.860\nAnd like that's the beautiful thing about language is someone being able to reach out to you and say when you say the word pickle\n\n01:29:44.020 --> 01:29:46.020\nMy dad hit me with pickles\n\n01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:52.620\nIt causes a reaction to me you don't have to you don't have to be like you piece of shit you Nazi fuckface\n\n01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:54.620\nPickle pickle pickle\n\n01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:58.100\nGet your hands off my body\n\n01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:03.300\nIt's not it's a no one is touching you know, it's trying to take your words away\n\n01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:08.380\nThey're that's one person and they might not be an expert in telling you they might be a dummy\n\n01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:14.260\nThey might be they might be an entitled piece of shit, but you know like like like maybe they're an unlikable fucking oaf\n\n01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:19.020\nThat also in addition to that gets hurt when they hear the word pickle. Maybe they're lying\n\n01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:23.420\nMaybe they love the joy of being hurt by things. Maybe they're just not\n\n01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:30.980\nThe but the the larger truth is you can keep saying the word pickle all you want. There's a but like oh\n\n01:30:32.180 --> 01:30:37.700\nThank goodness. I use that word all the time. I'm sorry. I\n\n01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:43.260\nInterrupted you to try to talk keep keep going Dan keep going\n\n01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:46.220\nKeep going. Let's turn it over to you guys\n\n01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:49.660\nYeah, no, you know what these pickles\n\n01:30:55.540 --> 01:31:01.220\nAnyways, yeah, but I said well, I think I look at that whole thing and I was like I think everybody played it right\n\n01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:05.500\nI mean, I don't think I think I think anybody hashtagging fire coal bear is kind of dumb\n\n01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:10.860\nI think that's really stupid because like that's not gonna solve anything and you're actually not speaking\n\n01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:14.860\nYou're not you're not using your I statements. You're not saying I think the hashtag like\n\n01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:20.660\nI don't you know, I'm gay and like that hurts my feelings probably too long a hashtag\n\n01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:27.700\nLike something where you're like accountable where you go like I personally I don't like the smell of that\n\n01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:31.940\nAnd then there's like hashtags are for like solidarity where you go plus. I'm not alone check it out\n\n01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:37.920\nBut we have to get over that mop mentality too because there's a lot of people that deserve respect\n\n01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:43.020\nThat shouldn't be required to have a million people marching before we give them our respect anyways\n\n01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:46.820\nThe but but the but like coal bear\n\n01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:49.180\nsaid\n\n01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:50.140\nPutin\n\n01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:56.300\nTrump sucks on Putin's dick and then but he did it in the midst of an important fucking tirade about what a piece of shit\n\n01:31:56.300 --> 01:32:02.380\nThis horrible criminal president was and and how offensive he was and and and how he's not entitled to his own feelings\n\n01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:07.540\nAnd he can get up and have a hissy fit whenever he doesn't feel comfortable in an interview because he's a fucking piece of human garbage\n\n01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:12.900\nAnd and when Colbert gets upset and he's his words have power and things and in the midst of that he said like oh he sucks\n\n01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:19.020\nIt's dick and then people are like that hurts or that's homophobia and like half of them are conservative or and then Colbert's\n\n01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:24.220\nQuote-unquote apology was like I used words that were more harsh than maybe they should have been\n\n01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:31.140\nBut I would have said I'd say it again. I do the thing that I did again. I use the word cockholster, right?\n\n01:32:31.940 --> 01:32:33.940\nWhich is hilarious\n\n01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:35.940\nYeah\n\n01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:37.820\nRight\n\n01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:39.980\nYeah, and it's like we're the trolls now\n\n01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:46.780\nThat's the important thing like we're the ones that are disenfranchised and like one power that we should have is the power to say things that get\n\n01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:48.280\nattention\n\n01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:52.340\nI can't talk shit. That's not our that's not our thing. That's what they do\n\n01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:58.940\nRepublicans are good at that. They're full of hate not all Republicans but that side so whenever we try to talk shit back to them\n\n01:32:58.940 --> 01:33:02.580\nYeah, we look stupid. We keep it so destructive. Yeah, it's not our thing\n\n01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:07.700\nWe're not good at firebombing. We're not good at excluding. We're not good at being racist and prejudiced\n\n01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:10.260\nSo we shouldn't try to do that shit. That's what fucked him up\n\n01:33:10.260 --> 01:33:13.820\nIt's he was trying to play their game. We kind of have to remember don't do that shit\n\n01:33:16.980 --> 01:33:18.980\nYou should be at home writing in your journal\n\n01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:24.100\nThat we have to figure out some way that has to be like a\n\n01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:35.140\nIt has to be some product we can sell on cafe press. That's a little Brandon a little pickle for white writers. It's your angry Brandon writing coach\n\n01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:52.060\nThat's what that's what that's what your your privileged fragile white writer needs is a little he needs a he needs a magical mentor to like\n\n01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:56.820\nAnger vants him into\n\n01:33:57.940 --> 01:33:59.940\nWriting in his dream journal\n\n01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:05.940\nYou do it get your hand out of my pocket. I saw your dream sequence. It was real good\n\n01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:09.460\nToo many flashbacks\n\n01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:14.100\nDid I wait I\n\n01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:19.280\nDon't plug this because it was blinking and I you know, so let's plug it back in\n\n01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:24.860\nCordery, what have you been up to?

Don't care about any of the butts because I'm a gay rapper\n\n01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:34.940\nI don't know\n\n01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:40.460\nJust that further stereotypes of gay promiscuity\n\n01:44:40.940 --> 01:44:44.460\nIt's a dehumanized gayness. Is it a rapper's job to humanize anything?\n\n01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:50.620\nGay rapper g a y fucked your butt now. I won't tell you why fucked it now.

That's a gay rapping stance and I also better at dancing\n\n01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:08.300\nThat's the stereotype\n\n01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:17.020\nBut it's about black people not about gay people. Is it racist and homophobic to say I'm a gay rapper and dance twice as well\n\n01:46:20.860 --> 01:46:26.700\nThat would be a dangerous area. So you'd stay out of it. You'd say I'm a gay rapper.
