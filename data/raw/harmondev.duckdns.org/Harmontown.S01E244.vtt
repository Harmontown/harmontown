00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Harmontown and it is now its session.

00:07.000 --> 00:16.000
Please welcome to the stage Spencer Crittenden.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
The mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
I will be guest comptrolling for the lovely, lovely Jeff Davis.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
I am Brandon Johnson. God bless you.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Thank you, Brandon. How are you?

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
I'm a little drunk already.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
Oh, really?

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Yeah.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Well, we got a late start so we're just up there boozing it up.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
Sorry, we'll start on time at some point in the future.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
And if we don't, then we're just late starting on time.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
I like that.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Yeah.

00:52.000 --> 00:59.000
I have really bad heartburn because I just went off of Prilosec

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
because I went to the doctor and he said, how are you feeling?

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
I went to go in for my little check-up, check the liver, check everything.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Just the liver.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Well, mostly the liver.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
I'm going for the liver.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Yeah.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Because I don't want anything.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Well, whatever.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
I know I'm going to get some kind of cirrhosis or whatever or something

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
and then people are going to be like, I just hate that.

01:24.000 --> 01:32.000
I'm allowed to drink and then die without it being like, told you so.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
It's just like, fuck you.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
So what if I drink my whole life and then it's my liver that kills me?

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
It's like, see?

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
I just hate that.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
I hate how we deal with death.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
We act like it's a disease, but even worse than that,

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
like that it strikes only those that did something to deserve it.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
Like, you're all going to die fucking pieces of shit.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
And by the way, I've said it before.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
I'll say it again.

01:58.000 --> 02:06.000
I'll believe any shit that you say about medicine the day anyone generates a society

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
where the doctors live on average a day longer than the other people.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
There's no fucking doctors don't live any longer.

02:16.000 --> 02:24.000
They know everything and they die randomly because God made us to kill us.

02:24.000 --> 02:32.000
That's our relationship or we created God to kill us.

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
Keeping things fancy for Brandon a little more collegiate for the kids.

02:37.000 --> 02:44.000
But anyway, so I've been taking Prilosec for like a fucking long enough to have Alzheimer's for sure.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
Because if you do die, you don't want to die with heartburn.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
Yeah, but then they linked Prilosec to Alzheimer's now, like last year.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
So the doctor says, how are you feeling?

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
He says at the end of the whole thing, he says, is there anything you're worried about?

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
First of all, you don't mean.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
Motherfucker, you're a job.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Like, how fucking fake is this shit?

03:09.000 --> 03:17.000
It's like a tarot card reader being like, just think about what's on your mind and also tell me real quick.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
My job.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Well, then that's what that means.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
He goes like, are you worried about anything?

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
And I'm like, no, no, I'm fine.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
And I'm like, well, wait, well, I've been taking Prilosec for like a fucking ever.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
And should I be doing that?

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
They told me keep taking it because it was fine.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
And he's like, I'm like, because I heard it was linked to Alzheimer's and he's like, yeah, here's the thing.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
I want you to get off the Prilosec because it causes Alzheimer's.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Like he acted like I said nothing.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
He just pretended that it was his idea.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
I was like, what the fuck?

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
Maybe he heard your impression of him.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
Is it any whatever, man? Is it is it rude to blow your nose in a restaurant?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Is it?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Yes.

04:10.000 --> 04:17.000
Well, I don't mean to ask you a question and then disagree with you, but I think the answer is a case by case basis.

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
I think if you can tell it's going to be audible, like what's in there?

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
I think if...

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
I think no one should ever sneeze.

04:30.000 --> 04:38.000
I hold in my sneezes, I'd say like 95% of the time and I'd say it's the right thing to do.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
I certainly wish to rip off a thought from Karen and Georgia on my favorite murder.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
They were talking about shout-sneezers, people that scream when they...

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
People that are just like...

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Stop doing that. That's a choice.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
Another thing you could do is you could turn a sneeze into a yell where you go...

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Ahh!

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
But I'll tell you this, man, nothing is more nerve-wracking than people...

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
No, I mean, the people when they go like...

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
And you're like, God, Jesus Christ, you're killing yourself.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
I don't want anybody doing that.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Yeah, don't do that for me.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Oh, I'm doing it.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Let it out.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
But that's part of why you do it.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
Because, you know, that's what exactly it...

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
That's the stigma, like you're going to get a stroke or something.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Wouldn't that be amazing if someone was like...

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
And they'd just like topple over and their eye turns red?

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
It would be amazing.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
He was so polite.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
And then his head exploded.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
It killed him.

05:43.000 --> 05:49.000
He was a doctor, but he died at 50 because he was a polite doctor.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
Well, yeah, I don't think I had anything else to say.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Look, I blew my nose in a restaurant at House of Pies today.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
And I was like, first of all, it's House of Pies, so the bar is lowered.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
But then I blew it and I was like, I bet nobody wanted to hear that.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
Because it's one thing, there's a nose blow where it just sounds like there's...

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
You know, you're just blowing your nose.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
And then there's nose blows that's like, oh, two things just came out.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
I don't know if that should be...

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
No one wants to hear foley work when you're blowing your nose.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
If it's one sound effect of guy blowing his nose on the sound effect record, fine.

06:28.000 --> 06:35.000
If it's two sound effects of grape coming out of a garden hose or something.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
It's still a record.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
In your mind, it's still a sound effect record, which I love.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
When I was a kid, they had record albums at the library.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
And I used to always rent the...

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
I would beg my mom, like, can I get this?

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
And she's like, again, it was sound effects record.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
I would get sound effects records.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
And I would just sit and listen to them, like a fucking asshole.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
The shit paid off.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Just like spooky sound effects.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I was really into the occult of stuff.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
But all year round, I would rent Halloween sound effects records.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
And it would just be the same shit on every record, because they would just be recycled or licensed.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
There would be some guy going on a piano.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
And then window shutters.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
And then a cat going...

07:25.000 --> 07:31.000
And I would just sit there and fucking stim and listen to it.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
I gotta be autistic, right?

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
And I just figured out how to start covering it up at 9 or something.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
So you can't diagnose me now, because I'm like Ben Affleck in the accountant.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
I'm like hiding it.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
No, he's not hiding it.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
He's like stoked about it.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
You gotta see Ben Affleck in the accountant.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
It's amazing.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
It's so incredible.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
He's an autistic superhero.

07:57.000 --> 08:04.000
Because his dad was an army man that didn't cotton to autism acceptance.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
And so trained him to.

08:06.000 --> 08:12.000
His dad figured, well, if he doesn't like bright lights and loud sounds, then he should be exposed to more of them.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
And he should learn to kill.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
And instead of that guy being the villain, that guy is like the Obi-Wan.

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
He's the reason why instead of just a regular autistic Ben Affleck is an amazing crime fighter.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
Because he's part autistic, part functional soldier.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
The combination is amazing.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
He can autistically aim his sniper rifle.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
It's so fucked up.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
He can calculate how to kill you.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
It's really silly.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
And amazing.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
It's really that and Lucy.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
All bad movies should be as good as that.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
Lucy's, that's the one where she's using 100% of her brain so she can just start making people float.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Is that the one I'm thinking of?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
I did not see Lucy.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
And Morgan Freeman just keeps narrating the whole movie at 70% of your brain.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
You can make shit float.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
And then she just does it.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
There's no conflict in the whole movie.

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
In the first 10 minutes there's conflict because she hasn't yet ingested this superhero amount of drugs.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
And then she becomes a superhero in the rest of the movie.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
It's just her fucking making the city lay down or making a building dance.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
And then Morgan Freeman's explaining in VO why that's possible.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
And then she just turns into a computer and flies into the moon or something.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
But it's great.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
It's a great movie.

09:28.000 --> 09:35.000
Alright, let's bring up Rob's Schrab and Cordry.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Woo!

09:37.000 --> 09:54.000
The Rob's are gesturing to each other to go through the stairs.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
They went up together at the same time.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
I'm narrating.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
We came up together at the same time.

10:06.000 --> 10:12.000
You know, this is a great live show and a better live stream, but it's also an audio podcast.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Yep.

10:14.000 --> 10:21.000
To those listeners at home, we did a fantastic bit.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
And I narrated it excellent.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
Even though no one laughed at it, it was funny in a very subtle way.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I really liked it.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
I really liked what we did.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
It was really good.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
It was great.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
It was really good.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Daniel.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
We were on the same page.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Hello.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
Come on, Harmon, don't fuck this up.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Hi, Dan.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Hi.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Happy Sunday.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
The thing is not coming up that's asking me if I want a mirror.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Oh, no.

10:56.000 --> 11:02.000
Why is the mannequin hid behind the dollhouse?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Why is it?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
What?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
You thought I was the mannequin?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
There were people that thought...

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
That's a compliment.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
That's a sexy mannequin.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
You think I'm that thin?

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Oh, I bet I know what it is.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Oh, you can see is the dome.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
And you saw fishnets.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
You ready, Dan?

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
We've been stalling.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
I probably won't do this every week.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
I'm experimenting with her.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I didn't make you wait for any...

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Shut up.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
I got two rubs up here.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
That's a good rub.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
There's a fucking point to that.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
If either of you steps out of line, it's like, look to your left.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
It's a p-roblem.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Oh, shit.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
And I'm someone, and I'm someone's dad.

12:01.000 --> 12:09.000
So I got, you know, I got topics tonight.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
It's just like a slide.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
This is my mind map.

12:13.000 --> 12:19.000
I got entertainment, politics, psychology, art, science, and culture.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Brandon's face is uncultured.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
Thank you, Brandon, for posing for...

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
For those of you that...

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
They're just laughing at the fact that I've got quite a visual...

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I've got a mind map set up here.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
But the podcast is still going to be very audio-friendly.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
And I don't know that I'll have all Sunday to like...

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
I talked about Hartburn.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
I didn't talk about Ruby Ridge.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
I saw a documentary about Ruby Ridge.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Do you know anything about that?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
You ever hear of Ruby Ridge?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
No, I don't.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
I don't either.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
It was like the prequel to Waco that makes you go like,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
well, why did Waco happen?

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Why didn't they learn anything?

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Because it's just like the government was just like,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
oh, first they entrapped a guy.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Like they were worried because there were Nazis in the woods.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
Like there are people out there.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
But it's like, now I think you watch that and go like,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
God, the glory days.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
Remember when the Nazis were in the woods?

13:18.000 --> 13:23.000
Just running around being Nazis and having like little things,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
burning things and like dancing and going like,

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
we ought to be in the city.

13:28.000 --> 13:34.000
I'd love to sit high with more people while you can't.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
You got to stay in the woods.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
You got Jethro Hitler.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
But, you know, because now they're in the White House,

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
that it's worse, isn't it?

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
That's worse when they're in the White House.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
It's pretty bad.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
I always go, when I go back to, I grew up in New England,

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
whenever I go back there, there's bunkers everywhere,

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
like old cement bunkers from World War II.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
And it always seems so cute.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
It's like adorable.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
Like, oh, look, they thought people were going to attack from the sea.

14:09.000 --> 14:17.000
No, no, it's going to be electronically, you fucking dummies.

14:17.000 --> 14:23.000
Pepe the frog will be the submarine that...

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
Going to hack your Amazon account.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Don't you feel bad for that?

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Nice of DVDs.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
Right. Well, look.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Yeah, whatever.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
So there was this guy that was running around with the Nazis too,

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
but he was really just like a farmer,

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
and in the 70s, the farmers got really fucked.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
And this guy was kind of like, you know,

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
he wasn't a big fan of the federal government,

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
and he liked his farm and life,

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
and he moved out to the middle of nowhere,

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
and there were Nazis out there,

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
and he kind of made friends with them.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
Because their cups of sugar were still sweet.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
They just happened to be Nazis.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
And because there were Nazis there,

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
there were like feds that were like infiltrating

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
and always trying to like, you know,

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
figure out how do we bust these guys?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
They make us nervous.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
And so they told this guy,

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
it was entrapment, like they said,

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
like, hey, do you think he could saw off some shotguns for us?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
And he's like, okay, I have a saw.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
And then they're like, you're under arrest.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
God damn it, no.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
No, this is because I'm a Nazi, right?

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
This is because my friends are Nazis.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
And so he didn't want to go to jail.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
And then they're like, well, now what are we going to do?

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
He's surrounded by Nazis

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
and has a bunch of sawed off shotguns.

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
You didn't take the shotguns with you?

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
And so then it just went to fucking shit,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
because the government was trying to figure out

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
how do you walk in and go and like,

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
there's kids and there's guns.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
And so they were creeping around the property all the time

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
for months trying to figure out what to do.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
And maybe we'll set up a couple more cameras

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
and just watch them a little bit more.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
And after a while we'll figure out an easy way to do this.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
And then one time they were creeping around the property

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
and the dog started barking.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
And then like five minutes later,

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
no one knows what really happened.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Everyone's accusing everyone else of being villains.

16:22.000 --> 16:27.000
But like the dog was dead, a kid was dead.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
And everyone was freaking the fuck out

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
and there was a big standoff.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
And then they brought it.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
They were just had like snipers

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
that were just watching the house.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
And then like the wife walked out

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
and they just fucking killed her.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
But the feds didn't know that the wife was dead,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
so they kept trying to use her

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
to like get the guy to surrender

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
and go like, come on, do it for Margaret.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
And he's like, what the hell are you talking about?

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
She's laying on the kitchen floor

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
and they're like, we can't hear you.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
You don't have a loudspeaker.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Margaret loves muffins, come on.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
And he thought they were just fucking with him.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
Like because how do you kill someone and not know?

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
And the answer is government.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Anyways, Ruby Ridge, check it out.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Google it, it's fun.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Is it rude to blow your nose in a restaurant?

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
I guess the answer to what I'm hearing is no.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Ooh, you had something.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
I had something.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
You had something to say.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Check it out.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
You know what, I think it is

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
if you have cloth napkins.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
If you're in a nicer restaurant

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
that has taken the time to give you cloth napkins.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
But I still do it.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
I'll still blow my nose in those things.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Yeah, I've never done that.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
That feels like...

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Yeah, I know.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
I don't feel good about it.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
But I'll do it.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
I'll definitely do it.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
I found out I'm not sexist because I was...

17:57.000 --> 18:03.000
I was at a rap party for a show that I control from above.

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
And one of the writers, who's a lady writer,

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
a righteous,

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
she, who I respect as a human being,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
I give her a job on a show.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
And her partner, by the way,

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
wrote the show while writing a human being in her belly.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
Because if she needed maternity leave,

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
she wouldn't get it.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
But so one of the writers,

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
at the rap party,

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Rightress,

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
she brought her husband,

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
who I've met a thousand times.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
And my girlfriend, Cody,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
who's also a rightress, by the way,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
she met the husband.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
She started talking.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
She's like, well, what do you do?

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
And I was like, what does he do?

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
He's married to a writer.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
He does.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
And then his job turned out really interesting.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
He designs video games and stuff,

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
and he's particularly designing stuff

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
that has to do with helping people's neurology

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
that have PTSD and all this stuff.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
All this interesting stuff that I didn't know,

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
because I never saw him as a human being

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
because I'm not sexist.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Because I respect writers,

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
not men.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
And I hate spouses, not women.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
I'm fucking awesome.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
Thank you.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Well,

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
why don't we check in with the entertainment section here?

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
We've got a lot of...

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
See, I'm so excited.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
It's like a real show.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
You guys heard about Piers Morgan today, right?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Like, he...

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
Yeah, what happened?

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
It turned out he doesn't know...

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, I did read this.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
He was talking about...

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
He was talking about men, men this and men that,

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
and men should suck it up, and then...

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Yeah, men should suck it up.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
And then men should suck it up.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
I'm gonna get that tattooed on my fucking balls.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
The...

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
And he was like, oh, men this and men that,

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
and then men were tweeting at him and going like,

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
well, fuck you, once you grow up,

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
real men know how they feel and talk about their feelings,

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
and then he responded to one of them,

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
is James Bond not a real man then?

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
And the real entertaining thing was like,

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
then for the rest of the day, he...

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
It was like, you knew something was up,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
because it was like, wait, he doesn't know,

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
but then he clearly...

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
He was like, oh, yeah, I didn't know that.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Yeah, thanks a lot, I didn't know that.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
But he responded to every tweet,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
and it just kept going, yeah, I didn't know.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Thanks for telling me.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
What, James Bond isn't real?

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
I thought he was real.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
It was like, you did, didn't you?

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Yeah, yeah.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
You tweeted 50 times about this.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
You thought James Bond was real, and you're British.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
We're allowed to think he's real.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Right.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
Does he not hang out with G.I. Joe?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
So anyways, way to go, you fucking ball sack.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
I hate Pierce Morgan.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
I guess you're supposed to hate him,

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
and that's bread and circuses.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
What is this?

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Adam Ultraberg tagged you into...

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Well, you're just playing into his trap.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Yeah.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
That's it.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
And there's Adam Goldberg figuring out...

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
That's all he's been doing.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Yeah, he just keeps tagging tweets,

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
because he realized that'll make a drop-down happen on the...

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
That's so, that's so fucked up.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Well, I've got some...

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Now, don't freak out when I say video finds,

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
because you're listening at home,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
and you're chopping your carrots, and you're poor,

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
and you don't pay for the...

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
This part of the podcast is going to be terrible for you.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
No, it's not.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
I promise.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Oh.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
So, like, for instance...

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
Well, so, okay, so my girlfriend, Cody Heller,

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
like, she does what a lot of people does, do.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
No, does.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Does.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
She, at one point, she started following everyone named

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Cody Heller on Facebook, and stuff like that.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
I do that.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
I have a couple Dan Harmon friends.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Yeah.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
No, everyone should do that.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
I think it's fun.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
You want to find out what you look like

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
if your parents had actually fed you vegetables.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Yeah.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
I also...

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
You want to find, like, the better version of you,

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
because if there's, like, I look...

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
There's a better Brandon Johnson out there,

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
like, he's fucking successful, and he's handsome,

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
and I'm like, I'll kill this dude.

22:07.000 --> 22:12.000
I follow a guy whose first name is Cordry.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Really?

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Yeah.

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
Because his parents were a fan of my, like, distant cousins,

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
who was a journalist for the Washington Post,

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
back in the 60s, and he asked Ronald Reagan

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
a question once in the 80s, and they were like,

22:31.000 --> 22:38.000
yes, he... he then... and they named him Cordry.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
His first name is Cordry.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
So shout out.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
I follow...

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
One of the guys I follow on Twitter is Dan Garmin.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
And so when things are real bad, like, after the election,

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
I'll just check in with him and go,

22:52.000 --> 22:57.000
what's going on in your universe?

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
You're treating it like you're parallel.

22:59.000 --> 23:06.000
I'll grump and get elected.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
But he's always like, no, it's the same here.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
My name's just different than yours.

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
Your fame doesn't make me an object.

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
But anyways, Cody follows a bunch of Cody Hellers.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
We're all dudes, basically.

23:21.000 --> 23:26.000
Cody's more, I guess, skews more of a dude name.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
The only reason that's important is that all this is

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
is just a random video from YouTube.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
And if you're listening, you'll hear the audio.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
There is no... the video is simply...

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
We'll tell you what the video is, but the audio is where it's at.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Speaking of hearing the audio,

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
we're going to need to plug in that headphone jack.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Good call.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Good call, Spencer.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Oh, brother.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
Do you follow any Spencers or do you curious about these?

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
No, I think it's a really weird thing to do.

23:51.000 --> 23:55.000
Maybe it's because I have a weird name, but yeah.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
Are there dicks in this?

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
No.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Okay.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
Just asking.

24:03.000 --> 24:09.000
I think that's a reasonable question.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Context, yeah.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Yeah, I mean, you made it a point to say that

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
Cody's are usually men.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
Oh, yeah, well, but I mean, there's a...

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
It takes place in a karate dojo this video,

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
so I guess you could say there's like 50 dicks, but...

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
But so it's just this video that's posted of this guy,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Cody Heller's YouTube page.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
I guess what it is, is it's him like...

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
I think it's Cody Heller, who I think is maybe a Russian guy

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
or a Polish guy, I don't know, or maybe it's just his karate instructor

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
whose voice you'll hear in a second is Russian or something.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
He's speaking English, but with this Eastern European accent,

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
and he's going to give Cody Heller this young man,

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
his purple belt in whatever martial art this is,

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
and the guy is so...

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
This has nothing to do with my girlfriend or her name.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
It's just like, that's how we found this random video,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
and I was just like so entranced by this.

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
I wanted to share it with people because I'm so confused about this guy

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
and his attitude about giving someone a purple belt,

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
and also what you'll...

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
Yeah, so just listen to this guy.

25:17.000 --> 25:22.000
Over here, training really hard.

25:22.000 --> 25:28.000
Yeah, I'm really proud to make him this level right now.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
His name is Cody. Come here, Cody.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Give me this.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
What?

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Come here, Cody.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Oh, Cody.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
Maybe you, Cody.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Where's the camera?

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
It's like a casting porn video.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
I'm just going to pause it to say it, yeah.

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
So part of the visual is that this guy,

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
the karate instructor, I guess has a GoPro,

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
maybe like nestles in his gear.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
It's in between my rope, Cody.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
I don't think he's being surreptitious.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
I think he just wanted to...

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
He just doesn't have a harness or...

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
Oh, I got a harness.

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
I have a saddle and a whip, Cory.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
So really all you're seeing is the inside of a guy's coat,

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
and if you're chopping carrots and listening to this,

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
you're not missing anything except this one thing.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
He's about to tie the purple belt around Cody.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
And I don't...

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Does this guy...

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
This guy is either not the instructor

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
or is so focused on the martial arts

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
he's never actually tied a belt before,

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
because he starts to put it on.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Okay, you've done enough, by the way,

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
belt-wise as far as I'm concerned,

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
now he keeps going.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
It's better you can't hold it.

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
He did weird stuff to the belt.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
That's just all...

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
He hands it off to a guy who just ties it like a karate belt

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
and then they hug, and then they hug.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Listen to him again.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
Your name is Cory. Come here, Cory.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
Come here, Cory. That's me.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
Oh, oh, oh...

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Cory, Cory.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
My name is Cory.

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
Cory.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
It just sounds like he's up to something.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
Is that an Eastern European stereotype?

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
It's like if you have an Arkansas accent,

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
people are like, it's bad, we're closed minded,

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
we think you're dumb because you talk like this,

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
but is it like if you sound like Eastern European,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
you sound like you're gonna fucking murder someone?

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
That's like that, guys, from the Alabama of...

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
Cory, come here.

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
Yeah, no, we got your guns in the car.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
We never cut your head and hands off,

28:21.000 --> 28:27.000
so the fingerprints and teeth gotta be identified.

28:27.000 --> 28:33.000
I'm Greek, not Serbian.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
All right, and I just wanted to share that.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
I found this on my YouTube channel,

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
and I don't know if I ever shared this with anybody.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
This is from Forensic Files.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Again, if you're listening, just listen.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
There's nothing visual that you have to...

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
A poison that kills instantly.

28:47.000 --> 28:56.000
According to forensic pathologist, Dr. John Butt.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
You just don't get any simpler than that.

28:59.000 --> 29:05.000
What forensic files were they trying to get underneath?

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
I don't think it was forensic files,

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
but that was, what's his name, the guy?

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
It was a poor man's forensic file.

29:10.000 --> 29:15.000
What was his name, the guy that they rescued him?

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
And then here's the only other video clip.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
But again, totally audio-friendly for those of you fucking assholes

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
that just listen for free and complain.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
This is from the movie...

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
Which one was Pierce Brosnan in Volcano or Dante's Peak?

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Oh, Dante's Great Movies.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
So, like, I don't know.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
Either do or don't name your characters Harry and Terry

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
if you're in an action film.

29:39.000 --> 30:05.000
I saved the worst for last, I understand.

30:05.000 --> 30:29.000
What is your full name that you shortened to Harry?

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
Let's go to one thought-provoking Twitter question.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
I'm so stoked about my technology.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
Ugh, this fucking not-Dan Harmon guy keeps responding to everything.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Alright.

30:42.000 --> 30:48.000
How do you feel about LA vs. New York and the impassioned back and forth between us?

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Is there?

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
What does that mean?

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
Is there a rap?

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
You mean, like, with rap?

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
No, I think just hip-hop.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
I think just with the city's east coast is better than west coast.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Alright, that's not a good question.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
That wasn't a statement, that was a question.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
We don't get it.

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
I think I got the clear to tell this story about Cody.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
I thought this was funny.

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
We do a lot of role-playing.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Oh, yeah, like Pathfinder?

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Yeah.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Oh, you knock, shadow run.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Yeah, second edition, yeah.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
You know, and it gets pretty violent.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Sexual.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Creatives.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Rules heavy.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
Let's say taboo.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Beautiful.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
You're both writers, so it gets pretty...

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
You go to some dark forbidden places.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
You kind of lose yourself.

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
In order to verify for our own animal brains that sex is happening.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Got it.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
There's visuals to this?

31:47.000 --> 31:55.000
No, no, I just wanted to tell this story because I love my girlfriend so much.

31:55.000 --> 32:01.000
So this really just made me really love her extra more.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Okay, lay it on us Valentine.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Yeah, share with us.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
Right.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Share with us, pal.

32:07.000 --> 32:13.000
We were doing like a thing, a scene, sexually.

32:13.000 --> 32:22.000
And the construction of the scene had to do with the taboo age dynamic.

32:22.000 --> 32:27.000
She was way older than you.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
It was a young doctor and really old patient.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
I needed a college credit.

32:33.000 --> 32:38.000
Daniel, come on over here.

32:38.000 --> 32:42.000
My rocket chair don't work so good anymore.

32:42.000 --> 32:47.000
It's centered on a lack of experience on her part.

32:47.000 --> 32:57.000
I've never had sex before.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
I could go with any second time in my 90s.

33:00.000 --> 33:04.000
Could you please help a poor old lady out?

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
Could you help a poor old lady out?

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
And so hard right now.

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
And she's fading out in her entire life.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Could you help me?

33:15.000 --> 33:21.000
Let me put my teeth in.

33:21.000 --> 33:27.000
I'm not proud of, you know, that's why it's the bedroom and not the boardroom.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
Although we've done that, we've done that too when we talked about the boardroom.

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
But note to self, stay away from the star burns.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
No, no, no.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
That was in Australia.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
Table.

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
No, no, stop it.

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
I'm having my sandwich on the table here.

33:46.000 --> 33:55.000
During the taboo fantasy, I was like, well, if you ever done this before,

33:55.000 --> 34:02.000
and she was like, well, a couple times, I mean, four or five,

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
and I was like, okay, and then I had more questions.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
I'm like, with whom?

34:06.000 --> 34:12.000
And then we went in and it was a kind of a circuitous path to then, you know,

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
just like the boardroom.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Yeah.

34:15.000 --> 34:19.000
And then afterwards, you know, we like to review.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Give notes.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Give notes.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Right.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
It's not less notes, more accolades.

34:24.000 --> 34:30.000
I think it was like award ceremonies.

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
When you said this, that was really good.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
I don't feel like your arc really would have done that.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
That was really good.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
That was really good.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
Thank you for giving me a Latin surname.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
There's not enough diversity in these scenarios.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
I really appreciate it.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
I was very proactive of you.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
Yeah, we give each other little props and high fives.

34:48.000 --> 34:53.000
And I was like, what happened with the little loop of conversation?

34:53.000 --> 34:59.000
Why was it so important the number of times that she had done this or that?

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
And you went into all this detail and then I had questions.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
And she's like, oh, yeah, I just got, I had an internal logic bump there.

35:05.000 --> 35:11.000
Like, because, you know, I just felt like I, you know, the idea was I had never,

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
ever done anything before.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
Then why would my blowjobs be so good?

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Damn.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
And she wasn't doing a bit.

35:20.000 --> 35:26.000
I was, I was like, are you like, she was like so, I mean, it's, yeah, I just,

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
we just want to justify.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Yeah.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
And for her, that's a matter of actual good writer, internal logic.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Yeah.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
Yeah.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
When ego fucks up role play.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
Yeah.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
Essentially.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Four or five though.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
I mean, that's a lot.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
Yeah.

35:42.000 --> 35:46.000
I mean, I wouldn't have been like, wait a minute.

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
But because your character was not your character.

35:50.000 --> 35:58.000
Your character was old, experienced, old helicopter pilot, old helicopter pilot.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
Old helicopter pilot, brand new private in the military.

36:01.000 --> 36:07.000
Joshua Koppel asks on Twitter, is the community movie basically a no go asking for a friend?

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
I don't, I don't know.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
I don't know why I saved that question.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Here's the related question.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
Did you ever watch the TV show, The Cape?

36:14.000 --> 36:18.000
I saw, I saw, uh, no.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Oh man.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
It was great.

36:20.000 --> 36:24.000
There was an episode where there was this autistic chick who could like murder people with math.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
It was great.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Well, she didn't really murder people.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
I think she just stopped an elevator or something.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
I don't know.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Continue.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
Good murder people.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
She could have, but she was a good person.

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
You minus life equals corpse.

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
And then they cloned her brain and made her into a Siri console.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
And they were like, everyone can use this.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
It's a good show.

36:46.000 --> 36:50.000
Did the, did the, because the, is that a cape power?

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
The ability to make someone do a Siri?

36:51.000 --> 36:56.000
No, the bad guy was trying to, uh, make, make series for everybody.

36:56.000 --> 37:00.000
But the, the bad part is in prison, in prison, the chick.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
No.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
No, no.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
You got so disappointed.

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
There's so many great places to pitch a series right now.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
That's true.

37:08.000 --> 37:14.000
Uh, I, did you, did you got, you guys know about that young lady who stayed at that hotel in

37:14.000 --> 37:18.000
LA and then they found her body at the, in the water, uh, water.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
No, I do not.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
Tower.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Uh, downtown.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
It doesn't sound funny at all.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
No, it's not, it's not.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
She's a recent, I said, are you guys, what's that?

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
Sorry?

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
Oh, Lisa.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
Lisa Lam.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Lam?

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Lam.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Like that.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Okay.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
Oh, she's dead.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
Well, it's not.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
I mean.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Let's, let's not make that noise.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Okay.

37:40.000 --> 37:49.000
Well, say her name, uh, the guy behind you tried his best to make a joke out of it, but

37:49.000 --> 37:50.660
there's no jokes to be had.

37:50.660 --> 37:54.000
Are you certain, like the guy that with the guy that went bad?

37:54.000 --> 37:59.440
He was just trying to help like yes, it was like I mean it was that it was the perfect joke, right?

38:00.000 --> 38:04.520
Perfect joke. It was also funny. Well, so it still it remains a mystery what happened to her

38:04.520 --> 38:09.720
But you get did you know about the whole if you heard the elevator game the yeah

38:10.240 --> 38:15.400
The the the I never knew that start from the beginning. I don't know what you're talking about Robin

38:15.400 --> 38:17.560
I the Roberts are in the dark. Yeah

38:17.560 --> 38:22.960
Well this young lady who stayed at this hotel, which is an ancillary fact

38:22.960 --> 38:30.680
It adds to the to the spookiness of it that this hotel is downtown hotel the one that it's the one that I can't remember

38:30.680 --> 38:32.680
What it's called the downtown hotel

38:37.240 --> 38:43.920
You know like apparently Richard Ramirez stayed there and I don't know Sherlock Holmes and broke his toe or something

38:43.920 --> 38:48.400
I don't know but the but she she stayed there and then she yeah

38:48.400 --> 38:54.080
Then they the what the well the facts of the story are that she was there then she disappeared

38:54.080 --> 38:55.600
She was traveling alone

38:55.600 --> 39:01.520
She was on some meds that she was then off it was then she was in she was staying in a room with some people who

39:01.640 --> 39:08.180
Testified to the fact that she she was kind of acting it in off her meds kind of way, but then she sorry sorry

39:08.180 --> 39:14.340
I don't like Mazel tov like yeah

39:18.660 --> 39:23.100
Two Jewish people wanted to get married here, but just time for a Mazel tov

39:25.220 --> 39:27.220
Parable time the

39:27.380 --> 39:29.380
Wait for the middle of the sentence

39:30.500 --> 39:33.220
I'm treading lightly and every time someone says something out loud

39:33.220 --> 39:35.340
I'm like because we're in Los Angeles

39:35.340 --> 39:40.620
This happens because there's 200 people in the room because you know statistically speaking there might be somebody who was a

39:40.620 --> 39:44.060
Friend of this person or whatever, but she was traveling. I don't think she was from LA, but

39:44.740 --> 39:50.820
But anyways the so I'm trying not to be as crass as I might be if I was moving very fast telling this story like

39:51.060 --> 39:53.580
dehumanizing her but what happened is she disappeared and

39:54.340 --> 40:00.380
Then she was gone for a while and then people were like this water tastes bad from the hotel and this part

40:00.380 --> 40:06.860
They eventually found her body in the water tower for the hotel. It was just floating in there for a long time and

40:07.500 --> 40:12.860
And so but then the video was released from the hotel the security video of her on the elevator

40:12.860 --> 40:16.500
I know you're talking about and she's befitting she's behaving very strangely in the elevator

40:16.500 --> 40:20.180
It's very spooky and they and they edited it before it was released

40:20.180 --> 40:24.980
And there's just a lot of like very strange things about the video and their release of it and they're editing of it

40:24.980 --> 40:28.500
Like they changed the speed of it and if you and that they're yeah

40:28.500 --> 40:34.140
Anyways, one of those one of the curious things that came out of like the the DIY sleuth

40:35.140 --> 40:40.180
Boards that were analyzing this thing that I never knew about was this thing called the elevator game

40:40.180 --> 40:43.420
Which is this whole elaborate thing where if you go into an elevator

40:43.980 --> 40:50.460
Millennials believe and you and you prep because they think that elevators just grew out of the ground

40:51.460 --> 40:53.740
They were there they're post elevator children

40:53.740 --> 40:59.140
I mean when I when I was a kid, I don't believe mad elevators are magic because I saw them being invented

41:01.300 --> 41:04.240
We called them pulley cars when I was your age

41:05.780 --> 41:08.620
Magical about them. I want to over to the fifth floor

41:14.620 --> 41:20.220
Apparently there's an elevator game where it is like a urban legend thing where you you you press

41:20.220 --> 41:25.180
Elevator buttons in a certain order and then it's got all these instructions. I wonder what's it?

41:25.820 --> 41:27.820
Please tell me and then the devil come

41:28.260 --> 41:35.540
Devil and then the dangerous territory. I know I'm a little scared to just pop open. Okay, it's terrifying. Thank you look at my

41:36.300 --> 41:42.700
I don't want people to see my web history. It's still dangerous. I went to your search history. Australian accent tips. Oh

41:44.500 --> 41:46.500
He ha

41:46.500 --> 41:50.700
Jeff Daniels wikipedia Kate Beckinsale's IMD Daniels

41:51.900 --> 41:58.420
Trump intelligence allegations Donald Glover makes magic with touching speech after winning Best Actor in a comedy series

41:59.540 --> 42:04.660
The wikipedia entry for Spaniel you've been trumped trump intelligence allegations

42:04.980 --> 42:10.140
FXX still work in progress update a network's pushing animation. Let me see K. Albert, but all right, whatever

42:10.140 --> 42:15.740
Wow, okay, hold on wait. I need to

42:16.740 --> 42:19.500
I'm really brave and bold for doing this, but

42:20.300 --> 42:22.820
Yeah, be careful. I just want this is

42:23.500 --> 42:29.420
I'm really nervous. I don't like that. Why am I nervous? I don't like this at all. This is not cool

42:30.860 --> 42:33.820
The elevator game get the fuck out of here

42:33.820 --> 42:40.740
Urban legend ritual game from Korea. Oh, that means it's legit horror

42:44.260 --> 42:46.900
The the death of Eliza Lisa Lam

42:47.620 --> 42:51.580
Provided an opportunity to boost the game's notoriety. That's a weird take on it

42:53.100 --> 42:55.100
Elevator game stock is through the roof

42:56.900 --> 43:02.580
Floors to visit the player must stay in the elevator for the entirety of this game and press the following floor buttons in sequence

43:02.580 --> 43:07.220
1 4 2 6 2 10 5 1 the game rules state that if the ritual

43:07.300 --> 43:13.980
Succeeds when the player finally presses instead of going down to the first floor the elevator will read did a Korean write this the elevator

43:13.980 --> 43:15.980
Will return to the 10th floor

43:15.980 --> 43:21.740
Alternative world is the header of this next section the game goal is to access quote another world

43:22.060 --> 43:27.140
Unquote the 10th floor should lead to an alternative reality where nobody exists except for the player

43:27.140 --> 43:32.780
Travel back go there steps must be done in the same sequence then to the fifth floor

43:32.780 --> 43:37.540
The then the final button will return the player to the first floor the game rules ask the player to check for small things to

43:37.540 --> 43:40.980
Be sure they are back in the real world the fifth floor ghost girl

43:40.980 --> 43:43.900
That's what I was interested in at the fifth floor a girl could appear

43:44.740 --> 43:46.740
in person or disguised

43:48.420 --> 43:54.500
Luring the player the game rules state the girl must not be talked to that was the creepy thing that's not even in this thing

43:54.500 --> 43:59.140
Hey, who are you on a specific floor? There's a girl. What's your name on this on a specific floor?

43:59.140 --> 44:05.620
There's a girl that gets on the elevator and she says where are you going do not answer her something that's the creepy thing

44:05.620 --> 44:07.620
That's fun, isn't it? Yeah

44:08.700 --> 44:14.780
Anyways, I just thought you know this elevator has the ability not not only to take you to another place

44:14.780 --> 44:17.020
But also to conjure a ghost well

44:17.020 --> 44:20.340
And they and the full idea that I read about it was that at the end of this thing

44:20.340 --> 44:25.260
The most you can accomplish is just you get to this alternate reality and you get to a floor

44:25.260 --> 44:27.580
And there's a door ahead of you, and you'll never make it to the door

44:27.580 --> 44:33.940
But you know I think the best you can do is like walk for a while and then pass out and then you wake up in a random location

44:34.460 --> 44:40.580
So that everybody's like a water water tower except for this young lady's parents who are like it's not a bit

44:41.700 --> 44:44.380
Yeah, maybe someone killed her. All right

44:45.020 --> 44:47.540
You know what I probably someone killed her I

44:47.540 --> 44:50.820
I can't people don't teleport into water towers

44:52.940 --> 44:58.620
It's it's coming from the dungeon master. I know a lot about teleportation

44:59.700 --> 45:06.020
The tough thing is that she was in there for so long that there's no possibility of any kind of like there she was she was this is

45:06.020 --> 45:12.220
This is awful to say but there's no she you know, she was like she was sort of anything that could have provided a clue

45:12.220 --> 45:16.860
A significant decomposition. She was like yeah, she was sort of dissolved

45:17.660 --> 45:21.340
Bathing in this and drinking this and they were those people all I mean

45:21.340 --> 45:26.740
I don't know what kind of settlements they got but they were drinking traveler for like days

45:27.940 --> 45:34.860
It was like a sickly sweet odor in the thing and there was like you know just imagine they always say that about death sickly sweet

45:34.860 --> 45:42.980
Yeah, it must be true Jesus

45:43.100 --> 45:48.300
Will we see any commentary on the 2016 election the Trump administration of Rick and Morty season 3?

45:48.300 --> 45:53.460
No, we will not because it's so we were we just just just raced right out of that bit

45:53.460 --> 46:00.060
Yeah, and it's up mouth. Do you think it's possible to ever really know another person at Julia 7 asks?

46:00.060 --> 46:04.940
Do you think it's possible to ever really know another person?

46:06.500 --> 46:08.500
No

46:09.260 --> 46:15.740
Because apparently a witch just like a like a home

46:16.980 --> 46:18.980
The ghost girl

46:18.980 --> 46:20.980
Yeah

46:27.980 --> 46:29.980
There's a two-drink maximum tonight folks

46:34.500 --> 46:40.660
You know what we could do I actually I have a lightning round of Twitter questions, and I thought I I could

46:40.660 --> 46:48.620
A lightning round what is the answer to the question we should ask you yes

46:51.180 --> 46:53.300
What's your favorite pastry and pinatas

46:55.180 --> 46:58.780
Yeah using your socks as napkins that's cool right if you're alone

47:00.860 --> 47:02.860
Major in college journalism

47:03.700 --> 47:07.020
With a minor in psychology, but I dropped out halfway through my freshman year

47:07.020 --> 47:13.100
So what it doesn't matter what is your advice to young writers who are scared to take chances in our nation's current political climate?

47:14.140 --> 47:16.500
Write about being scared to take chances

47:21.180 --> 47:24.380
Is the Rick mobile real I think so yeah it seems to be

47:25.620 --> 47:27.620
Knight writer the A team night writer

47:29.980 --> 47:34.300
What's the project you've most enjoyed working on this show I think I like this show

47:34.300 --> 47:37.940
What happened to your elliptical periscope sessions fuck you all right

47:39.780 --> 47:41.780
No, I'm gonna thank you for

47:43.780 --> 47:45.900
Thank you Daffy what Daffy Woods

47:47.060 --> 47:50.980
It's good that you had all those questions lined up for yourself there

47:52.540 --> 47:54.540
Yeah, you couldn't get any for Rob

47:55.820 --> 48:00.060
You got like nine people on stage we're listening to you answer questions. I

48:00.060 --> 48:06.060
Mean you could have elaborated as well

48:13.380 --> 48:19.380
All right, well I'll file I'll don't pick a topic that the you guys can join in on let's go to psychology

48:20.580 --> 48:22.940
All right action and thought yes

48:23.780 --> 48:26.180
On both of them. So my therapist

48:26.180 --> 48:30.180
My therapist blew my mind on Friday. She said

48:31.700 --> 48:33.700
Your thoughts

48:34.540 --> 48:40.860
You it will never lead to action your thoughts are kind of a well some of this I'm putting words in her mouth

48:40.860 --> 48:45.980
But this is my interpretation of it your thoughts are kind of ever never gonna be more than kind of a

48:46.900 --> 48:52.340
catalog and analysis of the of the of your experiences and behaviors like

48:52.340 --> 48:57.700
You can't actually if so if you just keep thinking about action, it'll never result in action

48:58.420 --> 49:01.740
Whereas if you do things it'll result in new thought

49:02.180 --> 49:07.340
So you have to act to create new thought you can't think to create new action and that really

49:08.100 --> 49:11.540
Made sense to me and also bummed me the fuck out because as with the elliptical thing

49:11.540 --> 49:12.500
That's okay. It's like yeah

49:12.500 --> 49:18.660
I have to get on the elliptical the answer to what happened to the elliptical sessions is I stopped doing it because maybe a

49:18.820 --> 49:21.900
Vacation or maybe a bad mood or a holiday or something

49:21.900 --> 49:24.020
Some excuse I had something that interrupted

49:24.020 --> 49:29.580
I can't get on the elliptical and then so that my behavior changed and then my thought changed and my thought never started

49:29.580 --> 49:35.220
And it is like the I have to just get on the goddamn elliptical at which point my thought will change again

49:35.220 --> 49:40.980
And it's kind of a bummer because you're like so I have so like you have to do shit that you don't really think

49:41.060 --> 49:45.060
About doing in order to think new stuff. That sucks

49:45.060 --> 49:52.260
Yeah, or you you know because we're creatives we get shit on for not having a nine-to-five necessarily

49:52.260 --> 49:56.900
So when we want to go to like to the beach or go thrift shopping or go do something that seems like it's

49:57.820 --> 49:59.900
Anti-productive we feel guilty

49:59.900 --> 50:05.060
But the act of like getting up and walking around even if it's to do something that's kind of bullshit

50:05.300 --> 50:12.260
Actually steers us back into writing and being creative. Well, we never get down. We never get taught that yeah where we skip

50:12.260 --> 50:14.660
It keep your claps for creation

50:15.700 --> 50:18.100
Yeah, yeah, motherfuckers should be at home writing right now

50:21.220 --> 50:27.740
Don't try to professionally procrastinate with me. I go see Dan Harmon. You should be writing in your journal

50:30.460 --> 50:31.860
So it sucks

50:31.860 --> 50:37.940
Because we get told like we want to fuck off and drink smoke a little pot do something on just a Tuesday at

50:37.940 --> 50:43.420
At noon, but we get told that's shameful. You shouldn't do that, but it's actually yeah, that's garbage

50:43.420 --> 50:46.940
Yeah, that's total garbage Cody just went through this. She's 12 years younger than me

50:51.620 --> 50:55.820
Which is it's weird because her blowjobs are like a 50 year old that is

50:57.740 --> 50:59.740
But the the

51:01.540 --> 51:04.220
Seems like you've done this 900,000 times the

51:04.220 --> 51:08.580
The the the sheet but I'm why I'm because she's 12 years younger than me

51:08.580 --> 51:14.820
So I'm kind of watching another writer go through a lot of shit that I have gone through and I'm I have my own problems, but

51:15.820 --> 51:22.540
But but I I do know for sure like I tell it because I've watched first of all the fact that like, you know

51:22.580 --> 51:24.980
Just like like Dorothy Parker said I hate writing

51:24.980 --> 51:29.060
I love having written like that's which that she I watch her like

51:29.060 --> 51:35.060
Like hate the process and then she just need wants everybody to read her shit

51:35.060 --> 51:40.860
And like she gets this like fix for five seconds of like oh, I did a good job and then this crash

51:41.380 --> 51:43.940
but also just like the endless

51:44.780 --> 51:49.500
punishment of the self for not writing which doesn't really make any sense because

51:50.460 --> 51:56.940
It's like you you have to just like kind of be depressed a little bit. It is part of the process

51:56.940 --> 52:00.140
You're like you're like a little cauldron or an oven

52:00.140 --> 52:06.340
You're not going to be like a happy camper the whole time if you're making something that consists of of all of the

52:06.780 --> 52:10.540
Emotional things that human beings go through when they go through a story like

52:11.220 --> 52:16.380
Part of that is going to be you being all bummed out with yourself and like sleeping or playing video games or

52:16.420 --> 52:20.780
Or just getting high and like beating your head against a wall or watching Ben Affleck movies

52:20.780 --> 52:24.100
Like you're just doing all the things that people do to torture themselves

52:24.100 --> 52:30.940
The the the you you do the the and like I but here's the crazy thing that happened

52:31.100 --> 52:35.980
Like Cody was like she wrote two scripts that were that were really good. She did it. She did her job

52:35.980 --> 52:40.500
She she had had a deal to write these two scripts and she wrote them. She turned them in and and

52:41.180 --> 52:45.900
They're like these are great. Can we get two more which is like their way of saying these two are great

52:45.900 --> 52:47.500
And I knew that would happen

52:47.500 --> 52:48.300
And then she's like okay

52:48.300 --> 52:52.660
I got to do two more and then she just and she was like I'll have them done tomorrow because she was on this high

52:52.660 --> 52:57.340
Which is also fine to be wrong to be wrong about what you think you're gonna be able to do

52:57.340 --> 52:59.060
But then and then she crashed. She's like wait

52:59.060 --> 53:03.300
I don't feel like writing anymore and then she was like I feel so sad and I was like you're supposed to feel sad

53:03.300 --> 53:07.700
Just lay there and it's like this weird conversation to have with somebody where they're like I feel sad

53:07.700 --> 53:13.780
I feel untalented. I feel not like doing anything. I feel like laying here like a lumped and to say to somebody

53:14.460 --> 53:19.820
That's what you should be doing. That's what you should be feeling. How long do you recommend that goes on?

53:19.820 --> 53:24.740
I mean eventually you're gonna have to get back to work, right? I but it's a it's it's a couple weeks

53:24.740 --> 53:29.380
I don't know it kind of depends. It's the masterpiece race if you make a masterpiece

53:29.380 --> 53:31.740
It could go on for the next 30 years, right?

53:31.740 --> 53:35.220
Because it's so hard to turn that's true masterpiece in your lifetime

53:35.500 --> 53:39.740
But if you're not if you haven't turned out a masterpiece your ass should probably wake up every day at 9

53:42.180 --> 53:49.300
But she she she went through a couple weeks where she finally because her therapist and I were saying the same thing

53:49.300 --> 53:51.540
Which is like you're fine. You're doing what you're supposed to do

53:51.540 --> 53:53.980
just lay there like a lump and watch forensic files and

53:54.660 --> 53:59.180
And that's what we did for weeks and then the really funny thing was that at the end of it

53:59.380 --> 54:04.620
She she got up one morning and she was like I gotta get out of here

54:04.620 --> 54:08.420
I gotta go I gotta go somewhere and I got I got a I got a right

54:08.420 --> 54:11.540
I think I'm gonna go into a hotel for a couple days and I immediately was like

54:11.540 --> 54:17.740
What's the fuck? It took me a whole day to realize I was I was like, I'm sorry

54:17.740 --> 54:23.660
I didn't like cuz it was like I had become the cocoon and so for her to finish

54:23.660 --> 54:29.020
It's it's not like a butterfly goes like I'm stoked about being in a cocoon

54:29.780 --> 54:31.780
Slippity-doodle fly in a way

54:32.660 --> 54:34.660
Do we have to pay for that if I said that in the stream?

54:34.660 --> 54:41.140
That the the but of course you're gonna be like the first thing that you're gonna do isn't gonna be like

54:41.140 --> 54:44.940
I feel like writing you're gonna be like frustrated and go like god damn it

54:44.940 --> 54:48.820
I fucking can't stand it anymore, which is different from I feel so dead

54:48.820 --> 54:52.940
I feel like I can't do anything those are two different things if you feel irritation

54:53.700 --> 54:58.300
That's like a coming out of an egg or a chrysalis. You're like look fuck. I can't fuck it

54:58.300 --> 55:04.540
You should follow that impulse like I want out of here. I want to go do something

55:04.740 --> 55:07.220
Even if that thing isn't writing you got to go do that

55:07.220 --> 55:13.500
But I at the time the funny thing is that I my immediate reaction was like fuck you you get a warning me about this stuff

55:13.500 --> 55:16.620
You can't just decide you're gonna go check out and then I was like wait a minute

55:16.620 --> 55:20.220
What am I what did I expect? How did I expect this process to end? I am the cocoon

55:20.220 --> 55:25.340
I'm gonna get ripped apart and she's gonna leave me to go be a butterfly for a second

55:25.340 --> 55:29.220
I'll write a script over the weekend and probably fuck a hundred dudes

55:31.860 --> 55:34.820
With the pro with the professional ability of a 50 year old

55:40.100 --> 55:47.540
Anyways action and thought so tomorrow even though I don't think I'm going to I'm going to get back on the elliptical

55:47.540 --> 55:50.740
And then I'm going to like think that I should get up because when I was on that

55:50.740 --> 55:57.860
It took no time at all for me to be like I would be like late for meetings because my compulsion was

55:58.060 --> 56:04.460
To get on the elliptical once I was doing it's just like Newtonian laws like you if you're doing it

56:04.460 --> 56:09.820
You tend to keep doing it if you stop you tend to stay stop stopped and I'm not being one of those preachy

56:10.900 --> 56:14.060
exercise people on my not to my my listeners, but

56:14.060 --> 56:21.420
That's the sad thing is like you got to just like do some crazy if that's what this podcast turned into

56:22.860 --> 56:27.900
It's like a health health podcast like a like it. Well, I mean

56:29.020 --> 56:35.940
I just started change fighting with Joe Rogan. Yeah, I just pushing like vitamins. Yeah, you got to take your

56:37.940 --> 56:39.940
GNC brought to you

56:39.940 --> 56:45.300
I'm telling you bulletproof. I'm drinking these ginseng Vicodin shakes

56:47.660 --> 56:54.120
My my my I was losing my hair, but now there's dicks growing out of my head. I'm like it's called the Medusa zone

56:56.460 --> 56:58.660
And you got to do it you got to go through this process

56:58.660 --> 57:03.420
You got to have a hundred dicks growing out of your head jerk them all off and then come you got to keep that come

57:03.420 --> 57:04.980
And put it in the freezer

57:04.980 --> 57:07.580
Because it's not come it's vitamins keep that come

57:07.580 --> 57:11.420
Got to keep that come. It's not come. It's vitamins. Yep

57:15.820 --> 57:19.720
And another thing I've been talking to Cody about cuz

57:21.740 --> 57:26.140
Like it's the it for those of you who are actively writing I

57:26.660 --> 57:31.940
Here's something and I've never really that took me like 20 years to figure out you you you know

57:31.940 --> 57:34.900
There's two modes of writing which is like sometimes I equate to

57:34.900 --> 57:40.580
Sometimes you're the chess piece and sometimes you're the chess player like sometimes you're like you have to like get immersed in your own

57:40.580 --> 57:48.260
Shit and that can be counterproductive because you should be thinking structurally like so you all know if you if you've ever tried to write

57:48.260 --> 57:51.420
That you know you get stuck on page one because anything can happen

57:51.420 --> 57:57.700
And you're like what the fuck supposed to happen and with you know at that point you should be thinking structurally like more macro

57:57.700 --> 58:02.820
But she also don't want to just be a hack. That's like well every story is like this and it goes like that like

58:02.820 --> 58:10.340
the magic happens inside the story so what I'm just realizing watching Cody work is that I

58:10.660 --> 58:18.500
Think that I've been making a mistake of thinking that you're supposed to think structurally up until a point where your structure is done

58:18.500 --> 58:20.500
And then you're supposed to think

58:20.900 --> 58:22.900
immersively

58:22.900 --> 58:24.340
Immersively

58:24.340 --> 58:31.300
Yeah, but but you may never finish that structural work because it may start to generate all kinds of question marks and you actually find your structural

58:31.300 --> 58:36.620
Inspiration by going into your shitty fucked up structural story

58:36.620 --> 58:41.540
And like living in it as a passenger where you can clearly see what's going wrong

58:41.540 --> 58:46.620
So like I think the better metaphor now that I'm landing on is it's like it's like

58:47.300 --> 58:54.540
Train tracks is the structure like you could you could say willy-nilly and probably should be more willy and nilly in

58:54.780 --> 58:57.740
Structure because you don't want to waste too much time on structure

58:57.740 --> 59:01.620
Just say for instance, this is gonna go from Chicago to Philadelphia

59:01.620 --> 59:04.780
That's like saying like boy meets girl boy and loses girl boy

59:04.780 --> 59:10.420
That's like like you just like whatever your story your basic story is knowing that it's gonna change like it's just a plan

59:10.420 --> 59:12.420
It's gonna go from Chicago to Philadelphia

59:12.420 --> 59:15.820
You could if you really don't have any further passion about it

59:15.820 --> 59:20.100
I guess you could get meticulous and go and it's gonna go over this river and all this stuff

59:20.100 --> 59:25.740
But you're still just thinking structurally and the truth is the thing that makes your movie TV show poem

59:25.740 --> 59:30.220
whatever you're working on good is stuff that happens inside a train car and

59:30.820 --> 59:37.740
Like some stuff makes use of the fact that you can tell you're on a train call that maybe meta or like

59:38.940 --> 59:41.100
High concept or something where it's like wow

59:41.100 --> 59:46.140
I can really feel the structure as I'm riding in this train car, but then other stuff is like I didn't even know

59:46.140 --> 59:49.740
I was on a train. Yeah, because they just said it goes from Chicago to Philadelphia

59:49.740 --> 59:55.740
And it's level the whole time and it's quiet and but but really it's just like a thing that happens inside a box car

59:56.580 --> 59:59.900
Like so and I think that you have to I think we have to

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:04.460
Go back and forth. I think you have to lay track or lay plans for track

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:08.740
And then you got to get in the car and then go okay Chicago to Philadelphia

01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:10.740
Let's see how that works and let it be like

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:18.860
Screech fucked up that just makes no sense and then change it from to Chicago to Florida or because that's a city, right? The the

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:25.420
It's the story of a person who failed geography becoming a writer and telling people what to do the the

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:31.820
The the you you change the generalities because they're easy to change then you get back in just I think it's more

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:39.740
It's important not to have an end goal when you're working on structure or when you're working within you got to get out of either

01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:45.620
It's almost like I don't know what to do with this new epiphany. How are you doing? Rob? You having a good time?

01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:51.620
Yes, okay. No, this is good. This is really good stuff. Okay. I was I was I couldn't tell if you were listening

01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:56.260
Sometimes you're the one who invents a new structure

01:00:56.260 --> 01:01:00.700
It's almost like you have to say it's set like an egg timer kind it's kind of thing where it's like, okay

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:02.420
I worked on structure now

01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:05.460
I have to force myself to do that thing where I'm like, yeah

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:10.820
But what does Mikey feel like in the in the scene? But then you have to also not get sucked into that for too long

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:13.420
Because that'll drive you nuts. Yeah, so it's like you have to go back and forth

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:20.340
It's like if you were building a tube you would want to be outside the tube and inside the tube at equal amounts of time

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:25.060
You don't want to spend too much time like tube constructing. Are there any tube workers here?

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:31.500
Anybody work on tubes because there's shit for on the inside of the tube that you're not even gonna realize till you get in there

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:35.380
You're like, oh man, I didn't know I was making this out of so what's the transition like between?

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:42.420
Moving from inside the tube to outside the tube. I don't well, I mean it's

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:46.140
No, what is that? No for real? I'm not making a joke

01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:51.540
Well, I kind of feel like you could characterize it as like working on a white board or with note cards versus like actually sitting at the

01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:56.260
Keyboard and like like where you're typing dialogue. That's an easy distinction. That's kind of how I

01:01:56.260 --> 01:02:02.020
Characterize it, but that could be different for other people because I feel like when I sit down and start typing dialogue

01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:08.540
I'm like inside the thing right and so I'm actually like I might jump from character to character

01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:14.100
But I'm but I'm actually sealed within the reality. You're not building it. You're smoothing it out, right?

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:18.100
But then there's but then if I'm standing at a whiteboard, you know, it's like, okay

01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:24.420
What should happen, you know, then you're having these like weird conversations that God has about people like what if

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:32.020
What if a bunch of people got cancer hearty-har-har? I'm God. I don't give a fuck. Do you use do you do you structure like

01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:40.380
Per scene or just the whole the whole thing the whole story like if you're working on like oh, I've got to work on this scene today

01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:46.260
Do you structure out the scene and then go in? No, I'm not what what am I productive? I don't know

01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:50.460
No, I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't have a process yet

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:57.460
I I like whatever we worked in TV on community and Rick and Morty like the thing that that the

01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:00.380
nature of the beast becomes

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:07.460
Break the story and then take the broken story and send it to outline and then take the outline and send it to script

01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:10.940
And I kind of and but then we end up re-breaking everything

01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:18.940
We always end up re-breaking and then and we look at that as like a crime like we're like Andy Bobrow was the fire marshal

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:24.100
For an uncommunity like they think because it was like some fire

01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:28.340
Paramount like building code thing like he was the official fire fire

01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:32.140
Stewart or something like he was the guy whose job it was to know when there was a fire

01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:38.080
So they paramount like showed him a closet where there was an orange vest and two cones or two

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:42.620
This is serious. Yeah, and he would but he would he would of course there was never a fire

01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:49.260
But he would he would grab them when there was a re-break and he would run down the halls of paramount and go re-break

01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:52.580
Made me feel like shit

01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:57.260
Because the joke was on me because it was we work on a psycho show

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:00.260
There's a re-break happening

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:06.420
Why can't you why can't you just air I can't you just air what we wrote yesterday and get an Emmy you fucking

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:08.860
narcissist

01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:14.140
Fucking dumb fat blowhard. Is that you or Bob, bro?

01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:20.020
It's Dan. I think it's Dan. I'm not gonna call Andy Bobrow a big fat blowhard

01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:26.580
This I told I told Brandon to

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:30.140
Yeah, I told Brandon to make a face

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:35.260
The face of someone who had been told they were the culture icon

01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:41.860
Dan was working so hard on this before that's why we were so late. No, that's not that's not

01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:50.820
That's not we were sure we were waiting along with you upstairs. Yeah, we were waiting on Steve Levy. Yeah, Steve Levy's fault

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:56.740
Can we get a pillow for Steve? He's just like hanging out

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:01.060
He looks good he looks sad

01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:04.940
Lonely health care. Oh nice. Oh

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:08.580
I texted this dispenser and then I saved it because I thought it was a good observation

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:12.020
Conservatives act like socialism is the opposite of capitalism

01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:18.060
But their whole perception of poor people is inherently socialist because they expect their pursuit of happiness to generate so much revenue that even the people

01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:20.260
They fuck over have less to gain by slitting their throats

01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:23.820
That's one big fucking federal program and that funding just got cut

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:29.620
Because poor people are mad and they're gonna get sick and they're getting sick in both parties

01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:32.300
And we're we're in a real fucking emergency situation here

01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:36.300
Like these are the beginning this health care thing seems like something you've been hearing about your whole life

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:42.460
But the what the the the the thresholds that have been crossed now are like so fucking official like like it's like

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:48.660
It really is let them eat cake like feudal Europe level shit like like to say

01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:55.980
That because underneath all this stuff people act like they're arguing about math and concepts and philosophies because no one is going to

01:05:55.980 --> 01:06:03.180
Profit or live through the day by saying what's really happening, which is rich people are just saying look times are tough all over

01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:09.060
Living long is a is a luxury. It's like cable TV

01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:10.820
Teslas

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:13.740
Your kid going to college. These are these are privileges

01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:19.380
And you should either be born rich if you want those things or you should work really fucking hard or get really lucky

01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:23.540
And that's what capitalism is and like I don't see why you people are bitching so much and why we should have to pay for your

01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:28.820
Your aides and your cancer and and I'm tired like when I went to Fiji it was like

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:35.420
Like like the life expectancy of the people that work by the pool is like fucking 20 years less

01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:39.100
They got great water that that that that in spite of the great water

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:43.940
I love that one real thing if you if you look I'll pay extra for their water

01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:48.300
Yeah, the waters if you look at third-world countries that have resort sentiment stuff

01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:55.140
It's just like that is the way that your Republican congressmen see the future like they they

01:06:55.420 --> 01:07:01.980
Don't see a problem with the idea that being poor should equate to a 20 year less lifespan

01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:06.060
like like like and that's what's really being said to you right now is

01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:13.140
Is yeah enough's enough like like like we lived in La La Land a long enough of this idea that that everyone was going to have

01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:16.220
Coverage if you get cancer in your poor then you're gonna die

01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:18.860
That's that is the real conversation that's happening

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:23.060
And I don't know why I'm lecturing you like you don't know that but I just say like like like I just want to say it out

01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:27.340
Loud because like some of us I think we're walking around going is that what's really being said right now or

01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:31.420
Because we're so used to this chatter of like oh, I think so

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:35.860
Iowa senator so-and-so just said the blah blah blah

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:38.620
Because it's called this senator

01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:42.580
It's like we kind of like are still in this mode where we're calling each other out on semantics

01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:48.420
But we've gotten to a point where the semantics don't matter the actual fundamental thought that's being

01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:53.020
Could communicate it to us is that they actually think that you should die

01:07:53.100 --> 01:08:00.180
They're actually telling you to fuck off and die and and they're saying it in different ways and people are at town halls going

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:04.260
You're telling us to fuck off and die we see you we hear you

01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:10.860
That's what you're saying and they're running out of the town halls and hiding and they just they just did this thing anyway in spite

01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:16.500
They're saying like what they're just going they're just doing what they were going to do anyway. It's fucking insane

01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:18.900
I I I I

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:21.220
Have no solutions as usual

01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:25.620
Resist we have solutions

01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:30.580
Do you have any idea how much harder it is to do what they just done for the last two months that it is to call for

01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:36.220
Impeachment like Google Bill Clinton impeach like like like they fucking know how to do this shit

01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:44.740
Democrat Republican Congress people know how to move to impeach. It's not that difficult like like and everyone is just

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:50.940
They they're just holdovers from a different time. I don't know what to do. Do we grab pitchforks? We're they're killing us

01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:57.300
They're gonna kill us we continue to monetize the Democratic push for 2018. We take Congress back

01:08:57.580 --> 01:09:05.620
We all can write legislation. That's the great thing about America is that any one in this room could write a bill and then push it

01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:09.660
If you would start at your state level, so we are kind of fucked

01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:15.500
But we we do outnumber them there is hope we are learning am I right?

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:18.180
Are we learning how to also here in, California?

01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:27.340
Especially because we have one of the largest GDPs in the world number six like yeah number six guys six

01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:30.660
That's pretty good

01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:37.780
So that that actually commands a lot of power you talking about California. Yeah, California. Yeah

01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:41.060
Yeah, I want to like I wait every time I talk about politics

01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:46.220
We end up realizing the solution is to act locally clean up our own shit and then set an example for the outlying territories

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:52.220
But yeah, like fucking California should like just become we don't have to secede

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:59.300
We can functionally secede by being the only state in the union that's in the black say is is right on the money

01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:03.060
This is succession people right, but I mean come on

01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:04.500
It's just not well

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:10.920
It's like why but I think it's just like an extreme thing they say to to let's talk about these issues

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:12.820
and

01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:19.980
My producing partner came up with a great idea. He's I knew the lawyers you were doing wasn't so low

01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:23.100
I knew it. I got a good one going on. I

01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:28.300
Have a part there's always I have a partner to

01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:40.260
He is doing a he's right. He's having a lawyer draw up a ballot initiative right now to rid

01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:43.460
California's pension

01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:49.900
Fund of all everything. It's not SRIs socially responsible investments and

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:52.500
And that will fuck

01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:57.740
Fuck the whole world if we do that, you know what I mean, okay?

01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:03.060
No, because there's a lot in tobacco and then

01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:08.180
Thank you. Love it. The rest of the oil and oil and stuff

01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:14.100
If we stop if the sixth largest GDP in the country stops investing in

01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:18.300
oil and tobacco and things like that then

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.660
Then there that will send a message

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.500
That's the only way to

01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:30.660
To have the rest of the country give a fuck about us. I wish there was a way that California could have its own health

01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:36.980
They're pushing for single play single pair. So California will eventually have its own

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:43.700
Health play like health plan system. So I know I know that people are really trying like you said Rob of

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:47.700
Making California be the place that people learn how to do

01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:54.020
Things across the country and that that can happen because we're sort of light years ahead of the country as we should

01:11:55.100 --> 01:12:02.060
Like the the the amazing thing would be California as the liberal version of the Iron Bank and Game of Thrones that we're just like

01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:06.580
That with every state that starts to go bankrupt because of free market

01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:11.220
D-regulation and then and their rivers start to be filled with bloodthirsty scorpions

01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:14.220
Like they come to us and we come out in robes and go like

01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:20.420
Hmm. Well, let's open the books like ideally looks like you have three congressmen that are Nazis

01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.780
Like I don't think that's a good investment for us

01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:27.620
I recall it was you back to your people and have some rallies and clean up your

01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:32.260
State because we have an election coming up and California doesn't want to live in shit land

01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:35.900
You failed to legalize marijuana. Is that true?

01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:37.900
Yeah

01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:42.420
But you know California

01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:49.540
Like like, you know, we're the blueest state in the Union and you still saw the numbers like what out of three out of ten people at

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:52.580
Your traitor Joe's like secretly voted for Trump

01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:58.300
It's like I'm sure those people aren't really like at Trader Joe's in Los Angeles, but no no

01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:00.300
They traded Joe's that

01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:04.180
Empire Trader Joe's it's like

01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:06.180
Yeah, Trader Jethro's

01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:12.020
Garlic stuffed meth

01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:17.580
Organic

01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:21.700
But yeah, I

01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:25.660
It sucks because we were chilling man, and now we all got to get busy

01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:31.940
Yeah, it's such a great time. We were having a great time. We're having such a good time. We were having a good time

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:34.900
All right, but but yeah, aren't you worried about the

01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:39.260
Better off like like better off now

01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:41.980
Are you are you enough?

01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:49.660
You're not a Trump supporter, but but you're you're better off now because we're energized

01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:53.940
Yeah, now you now you're involved

01:13:53.940 --> 01:14:00.180
Oh man

01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:03.740
Come on all means interrupt them

01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:08.060
Something that does concern me or that I see it coming

01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:13.460
I was like I think there's gonna be a bunch of Republicans or Liberty Libertarians that that in the next couple years

01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:18.580
They're gonna start receding to a position of they're gonna go. We're just ruptokons like we

01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:23.300
We didn't we never supported Trump or believed that he was good for the country

01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:28.340
We just saw that you libtard snowflakes needed some shaking up and we were right about that

01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:31.660
And I can't wait to spit in their face and like I

01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:37.380
Like yeah, I'm just so panicked about it's the it's the whole Bernie Hillary holdover

01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:43.460
It's this it's the Socialist versus the the Liberals like what the the this thing of like I

01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:46.380
It's like the Republican Party got hacked

01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:53.340
Decimated and then repair it break right now. They're like suturing through their greed

01:14:53.500 --> 01:15:01.580
They're like coalescing and going like but at the end of the day we love money and they're and they're they're solidifying and the

01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:04.100
Democrats are going like

01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:11.380
Remember that thing you said on that March motherfucker like like we're we're we're in danger of further fragmentation

01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:18.540
In in a way, but it's like and it's this whole conundrum where you're like you want to fight the Death Star and

01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:20.500
There's no better way to do it

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:26.860
It seems by then by constructing a bigger space station that can destroy more planets and how do you do that?

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:32.220
Except well, we should have more black in our costumes and we should and it's and then there's the people that keep going

01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:37.660
What are we doing? Stop? Yeah, like like one of the issues is that we didn't I think the left didn't know

01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:43.380
Um, how fragmented it was it is I think a lot of people on that side assumed

01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:48.860
That we had gotten past some things like racism and misogyny and what we're learning about ourselves

01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:53.380
I think is that there's still a lot of bullshit in our own party. So it's hard for us to come together

01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:58.380
I said and we're also learning. I hope that it's called fucking

01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:03.500
politics and democracy because if the issues are

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:10.460
Super fundamental and you're fighting for things that are as fundamental as like almost like people should have water

01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:15.580
Then that means the war you're fighting is between armies so big a

01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:20.740
Huge majority of the people fighting side-by-side with you are gonna be fucking stupid

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:23.580
Because most people are dumb

01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:30.740
So if you're waiting for a political party that's going to one be all smart people and to win

01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:32.460
then

01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:39.980
You're a fucking idiot. That's just on the sidelines like statler and Waldorf just going like oh more like muppet stupid

01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:41.580
like

01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:46.060
I'm just not impressed by that anymore like I used to be one of those guys, you know

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:52.100
I was like I was like a fucking like weird third-party the guy and now I'm like fucking cucked out and then

01:16:52.100 --> 01:17:02.700
Like I'm I'm I'm lipped up and damped down and cut down and live down. I'm eating that Hillary pussy and fucking

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:08.780
Like I don't know man. I'm just because I'm just like fucking we gotta cuz I nothing

01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:16.100
It's the thing that shook me up my fragile straight white like like egg shell was yeah the idea that oh

01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:21.860
So if I just keep sitting here and going you know why that's stupid, you know why that doesn't make sense

01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:26.620
You know, I all I need is a blaster by my side. I don't believe in no force

01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:35.980
That if I keep doing that I'm gonna end up living in a universe controlled by lizard people like and then that's no good for my smuggling neither

01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:42.140
And so I'm so I'm just like yeah, I was like I'm not just gonna like keep going

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:47.860
At the end of the movie. I need to like actually like notarized. Yeah, I don't know fucking

01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:55.340
I just like I'm just like I have a men's to make and I was like, okay, I'll fucking sorry

01:17:55.340 --> 01:18:00.740
I keep flickering remember that thoughts and action thing. This is a great place to merge all that. Yeah, so

01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:03.580
So I went to I went to that one March

01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:09.180
Yeah, I came up with this great story

01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:13.020
Well, we're gonna well we have here at star burns with the at the castle

01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:19.100
You know, this is one room where we take will be streaming this show and then as things go from bad to worse

01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:23.700
We'll keep meeting here on Sunday and Burbank and it's bright off of all the freeways

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:27.620
So, you know, like, you know, this is a good apocalypse like

01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:33.020
I think we're outside a nuke range if they hit yeah, we're downwind

01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:40.420
Right and there's a garage this place used to be a trucker garage. We shot an amelisa here next door

01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:42.420
but with a little puppets but

01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:47.100
My plan is and don't abuse this don't tell anybody outside this room. I

01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:54.540
Want to get an RV and start damn nation alleying it like next in the in the garage next door

01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:58.020
So that like and then, you know, we used it. We started this podcast by going

01:18:58.020 --> 01:18:59.020
Maybe we should go to the moon

01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:04.580
But like this is more like we need to we're gonna need to run over some giant scorpions like

01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:08.820
Like we we need we need to stockpile weapons and we're

01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:14.060
Taking signups for a human mind if the apocalypse the apocalypse happens tomorrow

01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:17.700
I'm gonna somehow drag my family

01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:23.100
Up to starburn's castle like somehow we got to get here

01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:27.700
That's gonna be the movie that we and we can have like we can have a fleet of automobiles over there

01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:29.700
That are all like have like a baby's

01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:33.460
A bunch of fans to Los Feliz and Silver Lake

01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:41.060
To pick up all your friends and then we just caravan and I guess we get stuck in traffic and then we're gonna be the best army ever

01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:43.580
We're gonna kick so much ass

01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:47.260
I'll tell you one thing the the blowjob instructor is gonna

01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:50.380
Is gonna make men out of these mice

01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:57.860
What is it under culture oh the Colbert cocksuck thing

01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:01.220
Yeah, so once we have any gay gay

01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:04.780
Attendees that don't mind being a little bit of an ambassador for

01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:09.540
That's good, too, that's please please come

01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:15.820
I'm just I'm just I'm just really curious like we were having that conversation

01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:17.420
I don't know if the Colbert thing happened

01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:20.100
We were here last week and I happen to mention it because we were robbing

01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:28.420
I are constantly saying we suck dick and you suck dick and suck a dick and and yeah, and I I've tried to remove all of the

01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:30.700
gay is

01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:36.700
Stupid gay is lame gay derogatory stuff from my regular parlance. It's it's it's you know

01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:42.780
I catch myself now then but like I see the I see the hurt in that and I try I've been

01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:47.740
But but and then and then there's like this curtain that I recognize where I'm like oh when you say

01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:55.260
Two people like two same-sex corrupt politicians whose relationship you're trying to satirize for its

01:20:55.260 --> 01:21:03.900
Inappropriate level of intimacy in spite of not to supposing to be connected like to say they're sucking each other's dicks

01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:06.740
Are you are?

01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:11.300
How much homophobia parts per million are you smelling in that?

01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:17.060
Because I don't think it should be binary and they go that's homophobic or that's not I want to respect the gay person

01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:18.660
That would say you know what that smells

01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:26.220
Pretty much like you hate gay people and you're hiding behind a couple of technical things like a like a like a date on the thing

01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:29.620
But yeah, it's kind of a it's kind of a puzzler because it's like well

01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:35.900
I could definitely see if you if your car breaks down and you say my car sucks dick I

01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:41.900
Think that that's way on the other side of a line that I've learned to recognize right like well

01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:44.740
I think you're saying your car is gay because it broke down

01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:51.060
And you say your key your car doesn't you don't like your car and you're and you're you're equating that with the car

01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:54.580
Engaging in gay so much more evolved than I am

01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:58.700
But I mean with these are words by the way that no one was ever consciously

01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:04.860
Employing for those purposes, but it's just like you you but then we're all taking a lot of another look through them

01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:07.620
But that's I'm saying like when I looked through them again

01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:13.060
I was like yeah, yeah, if you say like like I would sit in the community edit bay and I'd go like I'll get rid of that shot

01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:18.420
That's fucking gay and then like but and then after a while like somebody told me the editor was gay

01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:23.140
And I was like what the fuck and I and I and I and I apologize. I was like by the way

01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:29.540
I'm so sorry. I grew up in the 70s in the Midwest and I think I've been saying I think I've been saying that a lot of shit

01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:34.660
Is gay when I mean it's bad and I'm really sorry about that and I and I was actually still at the time

01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:37.460
I was going like oh, I violated protocol

01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:46.020
And and but then he said in accepting my apology. He goes well, I was never gonna say anything, but I'm glad you apologize because

01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:53.680
When I hear that word I go back to a playground in my head where I was

01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:59.860
Finding out I was different and was finding out that that was a bad thing and that the people in control of me

01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:03.820
Could like just make me feel bad for who I'm you know

01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:09.420
He just is like like in a human way and I was just like oh the worst so then I'm like, okay

01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:13.420
I'm not gonna but so then there's just now this new frontier of like well

01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:18.380
Colbert said implied that Trump is sucking on Putin's cock

01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:26.460
As to characterize the level of corrupt relationship between them. Is that still do we have to do we have to

01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:29.660
Hedge weed we'd whacked we do

01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:31.780
We do

01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:33.780
It's typical black man

01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:43.140
Always with your boundaries about homosexuality your community is so first to worship gay people

01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:46.140
We do love you RuPaul. We love you

01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:52.340
It's it maybe it's that the act started with women that makes us

01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:57.620
Start there right not necessarily even starting with the idea that's servicing a cock at all

01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:03.180
You're a woman or a gay man. It's like oh, you're the weaker person because you you slobber on my knobber

01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:04.660
We're so sick

01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:08.020
We're so sexist that it makes us homophobic

01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:11.100
But but but then I but then I and I know this isn't a technical issue

01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:15.860
But I don't know how else to talk about it other than that but it's like but but then I go like well wait a minute

01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:23.260
No, there's two guys so someone's getting their dick sucked and it's not the way it's not the stronger person necessarily like there is no inherent

01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:29.260
To say two politicians that happen to be male neither of them has a vagina no that like if they're like oh

01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:34.060
Trump well Trump wasn't a well of course wasn't gonna vote that way in the UN because of course

01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:40.620
He's all up in Putin's butt or he's sucking Putin's cock is I mean what it is will break that down for me

01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:42.340
Just for the sake of it

01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:47.980
The deal is that if we had a great deal of respect for people who suck cocks to begin with

01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:56.220
That joke wouldn't play but because we always always put down the person right because we never say he's eating her out

01:24:56.860 --> 01:25:03.220
Well, we never we don't say we don't we don't say oh the prime minister of this is like obviously eating her pussy

01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:05.500
Like we don't say that right and then when you

01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:10.940
It's the craziest thing to hear a man talk about how he got a deal on a car

01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:16.860
Or how you got a deal on a house in front of his wife or his girlfriend because he'll be like man

01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:21.480
I was supposed to pay $10,000, but I only paid $8,000. I told that motherfucker suck my dick

01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:25.420
Ain't that what I told him baby suck my dick suck my dick, baby suck my oops

01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:30.420
You are a person who sucks my dick and that's where it fucking starts

01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:37.180
All right, if we had handled it and this is the shittiest thing about shit like that is that if motherfuckers would just handle their shit

01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:40.700
We could go back to telling the full wide range of jokes, right?

01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:45.160
You know like you were racist or sexist or homophobic the

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:47.520
Material that we could fuck with would be amazing

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:50.160
That's the thing like of the 70s

01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:55.400
It was like shit was getting edgier chevy chase said the n-word to Richard Pryor's face and a sketch on SNL

01:25:55.400 --> 01:26:00.360
Right, I'm not saying we peaked progressively there like that's our that's our goal

01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:03.800
We just want to be able to say the n-word to black people on TV

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:08.520
But but we were we were you can say it we were we were

01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:15.720
We were more racist by our definitions now, but we were also

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:20.200
Comedically bolder that's like like it's different from

01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:25.760
Sinatra and the rat pack like abusing Sammy as if he was

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:31.480
Not a human being like we look at the 60s comedy and oh Don Rickles said this or that

01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:39.520
But then he'd say we all love each other and stuff like but the the the idea of the experimentation the fascination people like like saying look

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:44.560
Cards on the table. I don't understand this or that or that that area

01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:46.560
I think that's what really scared us comedically

01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:54.560
philosophically and it threatens some kind of deep state and it's a money train is back in the day was in the 70s

01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:57.800
They monetize talking about race and gender and rape and things like that

01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:02.780
I'm gonna unplug this now. They sort of were like we want money, but we don't want money by alienation

01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:08.320
So they're they're more likely to turn on a product that is appeasing to all people that doesn't start any controversy

01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:11.220
In the 70s. They were like there's money in controversy. I

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.120
Call my girlfriend the n-word constantly

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:17.120
But does she act like that?

01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:31.720
Did we get the lights the lights got brighter because that joke was so great I

01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:37.520
Do want to confess that and I don't know if I'll stop or not

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:39.620
I have to look within myself, but it's like it's thing

01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:44.120
I mean we do with my girlfriend and I do so much fucked up shit that we could that I could never share

01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:50.280
No matter how honest our society got like the things that we say when we have sex the things that we

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:56.840
Get up to the things that way I find that you know what my my relationship with McGathey was very public

01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:01.680
It was a public marriage. It was a public divorce. It was a public like we were we were pretty

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.240
transparent about every thought and feeling we had and then with with Cody

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:10.820
It's like well Cody doesn't want to be on a podcast and when we we're like we're private like we

01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:15.700
We like I I'm starting to appreciate the concept of privacy

01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:21.900
And I and I and I but I but I want to admit that that like yeah

01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:28.220
I mean it's like it's a I if there was a more horrible word than it then I would call her that when we were taught

01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:30.900
What I was like like do you want to get a sandwich, but you know like

01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:34.620
like and it and I I I

01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:41.020
I know that words aren't magical, but I but I I think the difference is like when you're

01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:46.860
The things that we get up to in public when we're talking when we're communicating in public the purpose of language is to

01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:50.060
Share each other's minds and to avoid

01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:55.940
Misunderstanding and so when we have arguments about technical rules about language in public

01:28:55.940 --> 01:29:00.940
We're kind of defeating the purpose of language which is to be understood and to gain each other's trust like we we

01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:06.340
And that and that's a that's another thing that I've like that where I used to be a different kind of guy

01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:08.180
I used to be this whole like

01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:12.420
If somebody said this word or that word is like should be taken off the menu

01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:17.220
I would immediately leap to the place if this is a slippery slope and first amendment

01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:19.780
You have to be able to express yourself, but it's like over time

01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:25.340
Hey, maybe maybe I get tired and sold out and whatever but I think it's more like well wait a minute

01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:31.140
We were never talking about legality. Nobody that ever said that this word offends me ever wanted to actually pass a law

01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:37.420
Keeping you from being able to say anything. They're only saying this hurts me and that's their first amendment, right?

01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:42.860
And like that's the beautiful thing about language is someone being able to reach out to you and say when you say the word pickle

01:29:44.020 --> 01:29:46.020
My dad hit me with pickles

01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:52.620
It causes a reaction to me you don't have to you don't have to be like you piece of shit you Nazi fuckface

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:54.620
Pickle pickle pickle

01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:58.100
Get your hands off my body

01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:03.300
It's not it's a no one is touching you know, it's trying to take your words away

01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:08.380
They're that's one person and they might not be an expert in telling you they might be a dummy

01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:14.260
They might be they might be an entitled piece of shit, but you know like like like maybe they're an unlikable fucking oaf

01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:19.020
That also in addition to that gets hurt when they hear the word pickle. Maybe they're lying

01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:23.420
Maybe they love the joy of being hurt by things. Maybe they're just not

01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:30.980
The but the the larger truth is you can keep saying the word pickle all you want. There's a but like oh

01:30:32.180 --> 01:30:37.700
Thank goodness. I use that word all the time. I'm sorry. I

01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:43.260
Interrupted you to try to talk keep keep going Dan keep going

01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:46.220
Keep going. Let's turn it over to you guys

01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:49.660
Yeah, no, you know what these pickles

01:30:55.540 --> 01:31:01.220
Anyways, yeah, but I said well, I think I look at that whole thing and I was like I think everybody played it right

01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:05.500
I mean, I don't think I think I think anybody hashtagging fire coal bear is kind of dumb

01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:10.860
I think that's really stupid because like that's not gonna solve anything and you're actually not speaking

01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:14.860
You're not you're not using your I statements. You're not saying I think the hashtag like

01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:20.660
I don't you know, I'm gay and like that hurts my feelings probably too long a hashtag

01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:27.700
Like something where you're like accountable where you go like I personally I don't like the smell of that

01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:31.940
And then there's like hashtags are for like solidarity where you go plus. I'm not alone check it out

01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:37.920
But we have to get over that mop mentality too because there's a lot of people that deserve respect

01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:43.020
That shouldn't be required to have a million people marching before we give them our respect anyways

01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:46.820
The but but the but like coal bear

01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:49.180
said

01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:50.140
Putin

01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:56.300
Trump sucks on Putin's dick and then but he did it in the midst of an important fucking tirade about what a piece of shit

01:31:56.300 --> 01:32:02.380
This horrible criminal president was and and how offensive he was and and and how he's not entitled to his own feelings

01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:07.540
And he can get up and have a hissy fit whenever he doesn't feel comfortable in an interview because he's a fucking piece of human garbage

01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:12.900
And and when Colbert gets upset and he's his words have power and things and in the midst of that he said like oh he sucks

01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:19.020
It's dick and then people are like that hurts or that's homophobia and like half of them are conservative or and then Colbert's

01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:24.220
Quote-unquote apology was like I used words that were more harsh than maybe they should have been

01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:31.140
But I would have said I'd say it again. I do the thing that I did again. I use the word cockholster, right?

01:32:31.940 --> 01:32:33.940
Which is hilarious

01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:35.940
Yeah

01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:37.820
Right

01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:39.980
Yeah, and it's like we're the trolls now

01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:46.780
That's the important thing like we're the ones that are disenfranchised and like one power that we should have is the power to say things that get

01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:48.280
attention

01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:52.340
I can't talk shit. That's not our that's not our thing. That's what they do

01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:58.940
Republicans are good at that. They're full of hate not all Republicans but that side so whenever we try to talk shit back to them

01:32:58.940 --> 01:33:02.580
Yeah, we look stupid. We keep it so destructive. Yeah, it's not our thing

01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:07.700
We're not good at firebombing. We're not good at excluding. We're not good at being racist and prejudiced

01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:10.260
So we shouldn't try to do that shit. That's what fucked him up

01:33:10.260 --> 01:33:13.820
It's he was trying to play their game. We kind of have to remember don't do that shit

01:33:16.980 --> 01:33:18.980
You should be at home writing in your journal

01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:24.100
That we have to figure out some way that has to be like a

01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:35.140
It has to be some product we can sell on cafe press. That's a little Brandon a little pickle for white writers. It's your angry Brandon writing coach

01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:52.060
That's what that's what that's what your your privileged fragile white writer needs is a little he needs a he needs a magical mentor to like

01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:56.820
Anger vants him into

01:33:57.940 --> 01:33:59.940
Writing in his dream journal

01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:05.940
You do it get your hand out of my pocket. I saw your dream sequence. It was real good

01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:09.460
Too many flashbacks

01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:14.100
Did I wait I

01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:19.280
Don't plug this because it was blinking and I you know, so let's plug it back in

01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:24.860
Cordery, what have you been up to? Yeah, wait, what? What have you been up to?

01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:34.540
Well, we're gonna we're just gonna fucking do a 180 right into my look. I'm no Jeff Davis. He would have been much smoother

01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:37.420
I don't know if Jeff would have said that

01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:43.980
I'm Jeff would have turned right to me. How are you getting drunker and drunker? You haven't had anything to drink

01:35:08.220 --> 01:35:10.220
It bleeds into four

01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:12.700

This is the thing about progress is that we always act like we advance but the truth is like I want to make out with letterbox

01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:25.420
Like they're going to invent some product. They're going to invent some pill that just makes you cool with like anything

01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:29.500
And then and then we're all going to look down on the cavemen that we were and yeah

01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:32.460
There's a song called me and my bitch which is derogatory

01:38:32.540 --> 01:38:37.340
But it's kind of sweet because it kind of pulls it up from notorious bi g I recommend

01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:41.420
And in it it says she looks so good. I'd suck on her daddy's dick

01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:47.180
Have there been any is there has there been a a strong and maybe

01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:50.940
Maybe I'm I guess I'm racist for asking you this question

01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:57.180
Has there been a strong gay rapper like like like uh, like who mc

01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:03.820
Why am I why did I riff a name of a gay rapper thinking that that would land with me? Yeah, yeah

Mc suckin nut like what where did I think that was gonna go that was gonna make anyone happy

01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:16.140

I didn't know I was frank frank. Frank is not really a rapper. Well, he's a singer

01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:35.020
He is more of a singer. Look, I don't hear no gay rock stars

01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:40.220
Um, and there's nobody freddy mercury. You're right mercury. Okay

01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:43.500
I don't want to talk about white stuff

01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:45.500
I

01:39:45.740 --> 01:39:50.140
Well, yeah, but hold on you can't you wait where freddy mercury. That's like curating history

01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:53.420
Like was he openly gay when he no

01:39:54.140 --> 01:39:55.420
I know I

01:39:55.420 --> 01:40:00.460
Brother, I know the band's name was queen and as I know that I know how they dressed

01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:05.020
But I also jude's priest was the same way and believe me my mom did not know queen was gay

01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:09.340
Like like like neither nor did my brother who was like I want to be free

01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:12.540
No, like like like he was like this fucking thing fucks ass

01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:20.540
Like like we were all like watching flash gordon and being like fucking queen rocks. Like let's go get laid with pussies

01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:27.100
With there was no there was possible the I don't know if freddy mercury was he openly gay

01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:33.820
When he was when he was like topping the charts that's weird because like jude's priest was like like uh like the

01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:36.380
What was his name? Sorry the uh

01:40:36.380 --> 01:40:41.500
Help help run help run for it. Help for it. I mean, you know, we look and we laugh

01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:47.180
We go like back then but but like the truth is that it was like a weird thing

01:40:47.260 --> 01:40:51.740
Like it's always been that way like you have paul lind in the hollywood squares and he's just going like

01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:57.020
Oh, I think I do it with this way and everyone's like that's hilarious. He's so silly

01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:00.380
And

01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:05.740
We were able to like we're weird with my grandmother had one of her best friends was named

01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:07.260
Donald

01:41:07.260 --> 01:41:11.020
I don't remember his last name. He's dead. He's long dead

01:41:11.660 --> 01:41:13.660
But he was a confirmed bachelor

01:41:14.540 --> 01:41:18.940
That's what she used to call it and that's what that's what you know, like liberal

01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:25.180
People called gay people back then. That's the funniest joke in uh lego batman

01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:30.380
I don't know if it made the final cut or if I saw like an animatic that didn't the lego batman

01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:33.100
Batman at one point says to alfred

01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:38.860
Uh, are you because batman's like like alfred suggesting he settled down and batman goes like

01:41:39.500 --> 01:41:40.940
are you

01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:44.380
Do you know what the term confirmed bachelor means and alfred's like do you?

01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:50.940
I don't know was that was that in the movie in the theatrical release or did they like

01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:55.580
Did that just make it right to the end and they're like you can't you can't do that. I love that

01:41:56.700 --> 01:41:58.860
um

01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:03.100
There will be certainly someone will come out of the closet those lego movies are fucking ass

01:42:04.460 --> 01:42:06.460
Just trying to get it started

01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:10.300
Yep

01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:21.820

01:42:21.820 --> 01:42:28.460
Uh, all right. Well, we've we've we've we've certainly done our share of show

01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:35.340
These these kids have jobs in the morning. Um congress is we've got to get these kids home. Yeah

01:42:36.460 --> 01:42:38.460
I believe I believe there's a

01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:43.020
There's a there's a law of ruin where uh, you don't get time and a half anymore. I think

01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:46.620
Uh, so they got to get up right and early because they have to work

01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:51.340
Yeah, three times as long to make the same money. You guys don't get paid for coming to the show anymore. Yeah

01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:55.180
Uh

01:42:56.060 --> 01:42:58.060
Let's close the show with

01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:06.060
Uh, an amazing improvised musical thing that i'm very passionate about and totally sober enough to do

01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:11.020
Hit hit it

01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:17.020

Yo

01:43:41.260 --> 01:43:43.260
I'm a gay rapper

01:43:45.260 --> 01:43:47.260
I'm a gay rapper

01:43:48.780 --> 01:43:50.940
I have to walk a lot of lines

01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:54.780
I've got to be tough, but I can't sell out

01:43:56.780 --> 01:43:58.780
I'm a gay rapper

01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:01.420
What does that mean

01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:04.460
What will that mean a gay male rapper?

01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:09.340
I want to get up in the morning with a partner that I love and respect and he's a man

01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:13.980
But I don't respect him because that's the thing so

01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:16.700
Would a gay rapper be like

01:44:17.020 --> 01:44:21.020
Fuck all these dicks suck all these butts fuck these dudes with all their nuts

01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:26.780
Dudes are sluts. I use them up like coconuts. I'm a gay rapper

01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:32.940
I fuck a million butts. Don't care about any of the butts because I'm a gay rapper

01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:34.940
I don't know

01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:40.460
Just that further stereotypes of gay promiscuity

01:44:40.940 --> 01:44:44.460
It's a dehumanized gayness. Is it a rapper's job to humanize anything?

01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:50.620
Gay rapper g a y fucked your butt now. I won't tell you why fucked it now. I walk away

01:44:50.620 --> 01:45:03.180
I'm a tough rapper and gay. Do I have to be tough? I don't know

01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:05.740
It's a good question

01:45:07.260 --> 01:45:11.180
Because you can't be like wake up in the morning and cook you food

01:45:12.220 --> 01:45:14.380
Because I'm in a good mood because I'm gay

01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:17.740
So this curtain's got to go away

01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:23.500
That's a stereotype. Yeah, that's fucking dumb. You don't want to do that

01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:26.460
So I think I think a real gay rapper would be like

01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:30.540
My name is mr. Johnson

01:45:31.820 --> 01:45:34.940
I don't do a lot out of the ordinary

01:45:36.220 --> 01:45:39.020
I went to the library today

01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:42.620
But I didn't read about being gay

01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:50.220
Because I know what that's like. It's like getting your bike taken by a motherfucking forsaken sucker mc

01:45:51.660 --> 01:45:58.380
Take your shit all day. You know what that's like? I do because I'm a gay rapper. I grew up different

01:45:58.860 --> 01:46:05.580
I'm harder than you because I'm gayer than you. That's a gay rapping stance and I also better at dancing

01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:08.300
That's the stereotype

01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:17.020
But it's about black people not about gay people. Is it racist and homophobic to say I'm a gay rapper and dance twice as well

01:46:20.860 --> 01:46:26.700
That would be a dangerous area. So you'd stay out of it. You'd say I'm a gay rapper. I cut down a tree today

01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:29.580
I took my shirt off in a

01:46:30.220 --> 01:46:32.220
non-binary way. I

01:46:32.220 --> 01:46:39.100
Wrung it out. I drank a glass of lemonade and hung out. I looked real good to both sexes. I was wielding two axes

01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:43.740
I'm a fucking gay lumberjack motherfucker. I'm gonna go to your house and tuck her in

01:46:44.460 --> 01:46:46.460
your children

01:46:47.900 --> 01:46:49.900
And they're safe with me

01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:53.020
Even though I have a gold tooth

01:46:53.180 --> 01:46:58.700
I'll tell you the truth. I take it out before I suck dick. I'm gonna do it from nine to six

01:46:58.700 --> 01:47:02.860
I'm a gay rapper full-time. I don't want to get paid double time

01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:07.340
Congress keep coming for you gonna lay you down and do what you do just you

01:47:07.660 --> 01:47:09.660
I'm gonna fuck you your butt with my dick

01:47:10.140 --> 01:47:13.180
And then get make you sick because my cum's so rich

01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:16.700
You're my bitch

01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:18.700
But not in a derogatory way

01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:23.100
Unless you're not gay

01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:27.420
Because if I'm gay and I'm fucking you it's empowering to

01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:29.420
To

01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:33.260
I'm a gay rapper

01:47:33.340 --> 01:47:35.260
I'm a gay rapper

01:47:35.260 --> 01:47:38.860
I love to make love to the same sex as me

01:47:39.740 --> 01:47:44.620
And I still have the flow and I still know what it means to grow and to fight

01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:51.020
Everything that you don't know ignorance is my enemy. I fucked your mom so no, I didn't

01:47:51.020 --> 01:48:02.780
Why did you fuck your mom because I was drunk

01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:06.540
And she was trying to force me into a fucking

01:48:07.420 --> 01:48:09.420
mainstream template

01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:11.740
She made me hate myself

01:48:11.740 --> 01:48:18.700
Put my sexuality on the shelf every time you say so. Yeah, the rider was shelf, but I'm gay. So I'm gonna go lateral today

01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:20.700
self

01:48:22.220 --> 01:48:24.220
Kelp

01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:28.540
Elf

01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:36.700
I'm a gay rapper. I put your mama on the shelf. I am a christmas elf delivered a present called my dick

01:48:36.860 --> 01:48:38.860
She looked at it and said what's that?

01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:43.260
Because your mama's gay

01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:52.060
And she only was comfortable telling me. It's called disenfranchisement. Is that a surprise to you, man?

01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:59.180
When you marginalize a people you're you're not gonna get the truth at the steeple

01:48:59.580 --> 01:49:05.100
It's gonna happen in clutches people go behind your back and hutches and they gossip and they cat

01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:07.580
D-ness

01:49:07.580 --> 01:49:09.580
Never going back

01:49:09.580 --> 01:49:18.780
Gay rapper look at my arms. Look at my pants. Look at my charms. Look at me working on the farm raking, pulling, feeding the pigs

01:49:20.780 --> 01:49:22.780
Gay rapper

01:49:23.020 --> 01:49:28.700
Working the land making plants grow everything I know you don't know you don't know what it's like on the other side

01:49:28.860 --> 01:49:31.980
I'll make your butt twice as wide. I'm a gay rapper

01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:43.020
We'll work on it. We'll work on a new stereotype. All right. Well, thank you for coming brandon johnson was your cop trailer

01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:45.660
Thanks so much

01:49:46.220 --> 01:49:48.780
What do you think about that spencer? Oh, it's great

01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:52.060
Seems like you're being sarcastic. Oh, no not at all

01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:54.860
That was one of the best

01:49:55.340 --> 01:49:57.340

01:49:57.340 --> 01:50:05.500
You had a good time. Oh, I had a great time. All right. Yeah, best one. Yeah, I had a good time too

01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:09.020

01:50:10.140 --> 01:50:12.140

01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:23.500
I don't I gotta get good at thanking everybody that helps on the show because there's

01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:26.780
Sarah I know there's Sarah, but I only know her first name and so I

01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:31.180
So then I never I never think Sarah because I don't I don't memorize her last name

01:50:31.340 --> 01:50:35.980
She just wants to be called Sarah now. So that's cool. I know but now that it's out in the open

01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:41.180
Yeah, I'm gonna start thanking Sarah and I'm gonna learn her last name. I'm gonna stare at it on a poster

01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:44.940
So I thank her by default all the time

01:50:46.220 --> 01:50:48.380
Just say Sarah Sarah. So say it twice

01:50:48.380 --> 01:50:52.380
Um, it's a show over

01:50:54.380 --> 01:50:56.380
So I got a heart out

01:50:56.540 --> 01:50:59.260
What's your heart out? I got a go-play Minecraft

01:51:01.500 --> 01:51:05.660
I got a celebrity tennis tournament at 12 30

01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:10.540
I hope that gay rapper stuff flew

01:51:11.580 --> 01:51:13.580
I don't know

01:51:13.580 --> 01:51:18.220
Oh, no, that's that could be too. It's really good. That was my favorite rap ever. All right

01:51:19.020 --> 01:51:23.740
Okay, well, we'll see you next wait wait. No next week. I think I'm gone. I'm going Cody's birthday

01:51:23.740 --> 01:51:29.820
I'm going to Mexico and oh, Jesus. You gotta you gotta go to Mexico to celebrate that birthday. Oh god

01:51:29.980 --> 01:51:31.980
We're losing him to Cody

01:51:34.860 --> 01:51:39.100
So I guess when we come back, maybe Jeff will be back. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe he will

01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:41.100
Fully

01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:46.700
I don't know. Maybe he won't. Oh, maybe we're cool without him

01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:52.380
Maybe we're cool without we just pushed Jeff out of the show

01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:58.940
All right started with you. Well drive safe. Don't expect so many visuals next time. I got kind of bored with it

01:52:00.060 --> 01:52:02.060

Thanks so much for coming to harm it down bro back. We love you

01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:08.940
So drive very quickly but drive very safely

01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:13.100
Please if you see Jeff Davis, tell him we miss him so much

01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:15.100
So

01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:37.340
