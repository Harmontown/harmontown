00:00.000 --> 00:24.000
Oh yeah! Can you feel it? Oh baby! Let me hear it! Let me hear it baby! Give it up!

00:24.000 --> 00:35.000
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, Harmontown is now in session! I'm the controller tonight, Rob Schrab!

00:35.000 --> 00:56.000
Oh boy! Lower your expectations! Let's bring out Spencer! Spencer Dungeon Mentor! Spencer! Alright, here we go!

00:56.000 --> 01:12.000
Ladies and gentlemen, the man himself, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon! Alright! Alright! Alright Dan!

01:12.000 --> 01:23.000
Alright! Dan! Dan Harmon! That's a nice shirt you're wearing there tonight, Dan! Where'd you get a shirt like that?

01:23.000 --> 01:31.000
Where does one get a shirt like that, Dan? Like if I wanted to click on your chest, what would pop up?

01:31.000 --> 01:45.000
Would Amazon pop up? Or would Tee Public pop up? Or would... The rapper? The rapper pop up? Where can I get a shirt like that?

01:45.000 --> 01:55.000
Zen Monkey Studios, I think is the... Zen Monkey Studios! They've taken it upon themselves to be as prolific as the bootleggers.

01:55.000 --> 02:05.000
That's the new t-shirt market. You gotta make a million t-shirts a week, so they're all very relevant. That's a long slogan!

02:05.000 --> 02:22.000
Guess Comptroller Rob Schrab is here with us tonight. I was in my pajamas, watching South Park reruns, nuggling with my dog and eating my cereal.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
You don't want to get those in the wrong order.

02:26.000 --> 02:41.000
Oh boy! Why? And then I texted you and I said, Jeff dropped out of the show, and so I replaced him with Ryan Ridley, who just dropped out of the show.

02:41.000 --> 02:55.000
And Bobcat Goldthwait cannot do it. Andy Kiddler's not writing back. And to make a long story short, would you do me the honor of guest comptrolling tonight?

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
Yes. And call you an Uber too.

03:01.000 --> 03:09.000
Well you bail me out and oh well well you're up, why don't you press the button to call you an Uber and pick me up?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
You asked...

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
I said, hey, have you left yet? No, you want to pick me up?

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
Oh he's going to prove me wrong.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
No, no, no, I'm just looking at my oups here. There's not a lot of them.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Hi Spencer, I haven't seen you in a while, Spencer.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
Hey man, yeah, I didn't go to the movie, watch movies with you that time you invited me, I feel bad.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
You mean my birthday party?

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
Oh no, I was thinking about a completely unrelated occasion.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Yeah, that was another time you didn't write me back.

03:42.000 --> 03:48.000
Yeah, no. It happens a lot, I'm a bad person.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Hey Dan.

03:49.000 --> 03:59.000
Hello. Tonight was a rare sighting of the very, very unique, fleeting, evasive, full, panted Spencer.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
I'm wearing pants.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
Spencer, stand up and let's not look at your legs.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Show some lack of leg.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Are those at the bottom of the drawer?

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
That just looks like shorts though.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
What's that?

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
For most angles, that would have just looked like shorts would, you know, above the knees and everything.

04:23.000 --> 04:31.000
Alright, so, you know, the Ridley, I just wanted to make fun of him because he bailed like two hours before the show.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
How did that conversation go?

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Hey man.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
Well, I don't talk to anybody on the phone, but I'll talk, you know, it was...

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Guess what happened?

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
This is Ridley's professionalism.

04:48.000 --> 04:56.000
I bothered to text him at 5.03 p.m. and said, you're going to come control tonight because I asked him on Friday before I left.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
Oh, I wasn't doing anything Friday either.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
I mean, okay.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
So I just got back on Sunday at 5.03 p.m. and I said, you're going to come control tonight.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
That's called verification, that's not confirmation.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
You are confirming the thing.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
And he texts back, I can't tonight.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
And I text back, fuck!

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
And then I started texting people like crazy.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
And then at some point in there, he said, you don't have any other options?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
And I said, I'll figure something out.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
It's not an exciting, but then his response was, okay.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
All of that means that he's on another Tinder date.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
That's what that means.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
He swiped, right, or got swiped, right?

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
I don't get it, man.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
Well, the old fellas were in an Uber coming here, so it got us to talking about the Tenders.

05:54.000 --> 06:01.000
Neither of which we've ever used because I was married and you've been married a while now, probably pre-Tinder marriage.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Pre-Tinder marriage?

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
And definitely, we both have pre-Tinder bodies.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
I mean, you're a fit guy, but I just mean we're fucking old.

06:11.000 --> 06:19.000
I mean, Tinder, time to start a fire with Ralph from marketing.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
No, I want sash from Subway.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
I'm horny, not naive.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
I don't want someone to explain ISIS to me.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
I want to come.

06:36.000 --> 06:42.000
I can't explain ISIS to anybody.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
Okay, so for real, and then Rob is saying, so it's just for fucking.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
But is it just for fucking or is it for...

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Well, I don't think it's for love.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
I think it's for fucking.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
It's not for moving in.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
And it's not moving in there.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
No.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Oh wait, there's a lesbian joke on there somewhere, right?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Isn't that the lesbian stereotype that they move in with each other?

07:03.000 --> 07:12.000
You can write that joke backwards and make your lesbian friends feel sad and dehumanized.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Write it backwards?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Yeah, it's cool.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Now that you know the punchline is moving in there.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
So you go like, hey, did you hear that there's a dating app for lesbians?

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
It's called moving in there.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
I mean, I'm just saying, this is how comedy works.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
It's like blocks.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
You just go, pfft.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
You don't laugh.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
You just go, got milk.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
It's five o'clock.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
My children are hungry.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
I don't have children.

07:39.000 --> 07:48.000
My man, I could like, needs a new pair of shoes.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
Anyway, so is there maybe a millennial?

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Well, let's not be ages.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
There might be a 48-year-old person here that's like a Tinder expert.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
But is that maybe we want to just come up with this?

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Oh god, I would love to.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Hello.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Hello.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
He's got like a gorgeous, drawn Jeremy looking guy.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
He comes up with a marching name.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
The I.B. of service.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
My name is Sebastian Fuxalot.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Some George the K guy comes up.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Oh my.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Yeah.

08:17.000 --> 08:23.000
Is there anybody that's been getting used out of Tinder one way or another?

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
All right.

08:24.000 --> 08:32.000
We've got, I think we have a familiar, a Harmontown person here in front of our family, a front

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
rower.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Let's make this easy.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Come on up.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Yay.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
All right.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
All right.

08:38.000 --> 08:46.000
Well, this is a segment called, if you sit down here, then it's easy for the Carl's

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Jr., whoever it is.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
Whoever we work for now.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Well done.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Because you're so thin, it was blocking you.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Aw, damn.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
What a gentleman.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
I objectified her.

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
Okay, so yeah, your name again?

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
I'm Leah.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Leah.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Okay.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
You've been up here before, right?

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Like a year and a half ago or something like that.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
To the day.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Yeah.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
It's on my calendar.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
There are little hearts on it.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
So this is actually my anniversary.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
I played D&D at one point.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Okay.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
So tinder us.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Like the grandpa.

09:25.000 --> 09:31.000
Walk us through a day in the life of the tinder person.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Yeah.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
I actually haven't been on it for a year, but I used to be.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Oh, God.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
I used to be on it like a lot.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
I definitely, you know, I definitely got some mileage out of that web.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Jesus Christ.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
You sure?

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Come down.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Well, what does mileage mean?

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
I mean, what did I try to do?

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Mildage.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
What is the typical, what is the typical tinder encounter?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Like, like from soup to nuts.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
And I do mean, I mean, it's miles of dick.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
What's the soup?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
It's actual soup.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
If you're near a soup place.

10:09.000 --> 10:15.000
Well, actually I'm looking for a new place to live right now because my housemate met

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
her boyfriend on tinder.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
And so he's moving in.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
So it is for love.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Sometimes it's for love.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Well, love finds a way.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Yeah.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
You always try to hit it and quit it.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Fire at close range, you think.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
But then you fall in love because it's like.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
That frog DNA in there.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
And then I'll, you know, nature.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Then you start laying in your eggs.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Wait, man.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Then you're next to, you know, you're out of the paddock and you're at site B.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
T-Rex is after you.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
You gotta go, must go faster, man.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Gotta get out of there.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
It doesn't matter who throws a road flare.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
You're visual acutely.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
She is.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Is it based on light?

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
It's based on motion.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Right.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Yeah.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Gotta eat that toilet lawyer and fucking.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Welcome back.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
You know what I'm talking about?

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
Talking about family.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
Objects are closer than they are.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
In an ironic sense.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Yeah, man.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Yeah, man.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
Just gotta fucking make that girl clever.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Shit.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Uh, yeah.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
You gotta, gotta get in that plastic hamster ball and just slide.

11:23.000 --> 11:29.000
You gotta, gotta have that dream sequence where the raptor's talking at you.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
Wait, is that one from the Clone Wars?

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
That's the third one.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Third one.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Oh, okay.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
We saw that in the theater.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Oh, that's, yeah.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Then they say like, hey, Kevin, get over here.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Okay.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Hey, hey, hey.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
All right, Leah.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
So, so.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
Hey, I'm a raptor and I'm eating cream and I'm talking to you.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
It's like that.

11:47.000 --> 11:53.000
It's just like Sam Neal's like, and then the raptor goes, hey, can I have some peanuts?

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
And it's, somebody went, that's terrifying.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
All right.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
So back to Tinder.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
All right.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
So, so you, so, so you have your phone.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
You're, where are you typically surfing your Tinder?

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
I used to do it with my housemate too and I've also done it with Paul, Paul the whip guy.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Yeah.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
Like, well, like, so sometimes it's drunk tindering, which is kind of more fun because

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
then it's just like a big fun judging game with your body.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
Is there a limit on that like, like, like, like, like on those music sharing things where

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
they don't want you to be able to do next too many times because then that's like not having

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
to buy music.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
So like, look, you got to marry one of these guys or I'll see you tomorrow.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
I know what you're doing.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
You're judging us.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
And unless it changed, I don't think so.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
But once in a while it'll run out of people, which is a really sad moment where they're

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
like, there's no one else in your area for you.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Yeah.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
You insatiable sardlock pit.

12:52.000 --> 13:00.000
You bottomless, gaping, gaping.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Sex monster.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Oh my gosh.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
The, the, what was, okay, but so, okay, so then you're swiping, sometimes you're doing

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
it for onesies, like hate, hate swiping.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Yeah.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
And then, and then, and then, but then sometimes you're doing it for onesies.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
For onesies.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
And you're, and you're, and you're swiping.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Yeah.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Yeah.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Well, it's always pretty sincere even if you're doing it with the body, like the objective

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
is always to get a date.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Doing it was a buddy.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Like what are you doing?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Like you're sitting on the couch.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
And you're looking at people together and you're like, I don't like him.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
I can't say his name.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Fuck that guy.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
You know.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Right.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
That's better than a compliment.

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
Really, any minority?

13:45.000 --> 13:51.000
So, so, so, so, but sometimes, so, so, like, you swipe.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Okay.

13:52.000 --> 13:58.000
But then you see, you see a gentleman, not to presume, but like, like, you see a couple

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
apart.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
A couple.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
I've swiped a couple before.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
You see a person.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
Yeah, you see a human meat, a meat thing.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Yeah.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
And you, and you go, like it.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
And then you, and then so then is that person getting there?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Are you texting them?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Was it going to a chat thing?

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Yeah.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
If you both, you can swipe left, which means you're not interested.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Swipe right means that you are interested.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
And if you both swipe right to each other, then you're sent to a chat.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
So then you can chat with each other.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
What if you don't want to?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Most of the time you don't.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
And that's always almost like a weird sad thing because you'll match with someone and

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
it'll tell you it's a match.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
And then they're like, do you want to keep playing?

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Or do you want to talk to this person?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
You're like, I want to keep playing.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Like,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Keep playing like, like looking further or keep like,

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
It becomes an addiction after a while.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
It's just like anything else where you're just like, I just like to swipe things.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
You know,

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
So can you explain so, so, but the people that you're swiping are they, they're also,

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
they're all the people that are actively swiping.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
So there's no chance that you're swiping somebody who's like taking a map, like,

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
like everyone who's swiping is swiping each other.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
It's no, you don't have to be online right.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
Like it's anybody that's active on Tinder.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
And it's based on like what age range you said you're looking for and like the distance

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
that you're interested in driving.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
And since it's LA, it's like nothing.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
Okay.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
And so it's the average thing.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Maybe we should just skip all the way ahead too.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
If you don't mind us asking this question.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Yeah.

15:18.000 --> 15:27.000
Like how many out of all the times that you, I'm listening, how many, how many, I mean,

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
how, how many times is this just hooking up?

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
How many times is it just like a one night, one day stand?

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
A lot, a significant amount.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
But then also I dated a guy dated strong word.

15:41.000 --> 15:46.000
I was interacting with a man for 14 months that I met on Tinder.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Yeah.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
But is it a lot of one or a few time interactions?

15:51.000 --> 15:59.000
I get the impression that the people that are most of the people that are using it, are they, is it, is it, is it like dating?

15:59.000 --> 16:07.000
Like, just like everything else where it's like, well, yeah, I want to fuck probably eventually maybe even really fast.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
But I'm also not like, is it just like a gas station bathroom?

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
Well, that's a glory hole.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
Is it like E24 for pussy?

16:20.000 --> 16:27.000
Are you in the mood for Chinese?

16:27.000 --> 16:33.000
I actually know three couples that are like serious couples from Tinder.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
That's good odds.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Yeah.

16:35.000 --> 16:41.000
I mean, isn't it about fucking having sex and then people are like, oh, having sex is so great.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Let's date.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
And then, you know, sometimes relationships happen.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
No, what happened was, okay, Tinder is based on the app Grinder, which is for the gay community.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
And so that's just for fucking.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Like, so that's why originally it was like, oh, you're hot.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
I'm hot.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Do you want to bang?

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Let's go over there.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
There's a bathroom in between our houses.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
And then the houses, there's two houses involved.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
It's more adventurous to get a bathroom.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
There's bathrooms in both of those houses.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Yeah.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Sometimes multiple bathrooms.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
This is West Hollywood.

17:10.000 --> 17:15.000
There's a house and there's a house, but then there's in between each of the houses.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
There's a special gay bathroom.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Just for neighbors.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Got it.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Got it.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Right.

17:23.000 --> 17:28.000
So it's based on Grinder, but then now it's Tinder.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
And so now guys have to deal with women.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
So I mean, if guys had their way, I'm sure it's still just be like, do you want to meet

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
them between our houses at the secret heterosexual bathhouse?

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
But then women are like, no, I want you to buy me dinner and like, you know, learn my

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
name.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
And they're like, God damn it.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
And so that's what Tinder is.

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
It's like a meeting of the sexes where the men, I'm sure, you know, but then one of my

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
guy friends said that he had an account and he tried different things.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
And so when he was saying like, maybe I want a girlfriend, he was only getting like some

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
people.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
And eventually he changed it where he's like, I'm trying to bang.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
And then he'd say, you have girls hitting them up all the time.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
So he was like, girls are just as nasty as the guys, man.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
So it's all just what you're looking for.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Is that what you sound?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Oh, go ahead.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
No, it's too like.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
I mean, just as many girls are nasty as guys.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Yeah, for sure.

18:21.000 --> 18:26.000
And so apps probably, obviously it is a good thing because people are, you're using it.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
So that's the definition of being good, right?

18:28.000 --> 18:35.000
There's nobody's getting hurt more than when they use Uber.

18:35.000 --> 18:44.000
So like it is because I find, you know, that like when you're talking about sex with people,

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
it's like you can never, you can never tell, but it's like we all kind of like we have these

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
like sort of, I don't know, like we're always worried about everybody else like like like

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
worrying about us.

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
And so it's hard to, you know, that's what that that's what that guy found out that that

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
Kenzie, Ken, Ken, Ken, Kenzie guy, like it's like people, everybody's like fucked up.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Everybody's like a crazy sexual snowflake.

19:05.000 --> 19:11.000
And then the big thing that most people share is that they'd love to talk about it with

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
somebody and love to like indulge lots of it and do all kinds of weird things.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
But then we have this whole other part that's like, well, I'm not actively coming right

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
now, so I need to like not be afraid of people.

19:22.000 --> 19:29.000
And I need to like not, I need to be respected and allowed to be a senator.

19:29.000 --> 19:34.000
Yeah, so I don't know what my point is, a bunch of a bunch of really obvious shit is my point.

19:34.000 --> 19:39.000
On Tinder, is there like, is it like you have profiles and this is what I like and this is

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
what, do you have it on your phone?

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Yeah, it's on your phone.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
Can you look up Ridley's profile?

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Is it possible to search for people?

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
No.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
It's not like Instagram.

19:49.000 --> 19:54.000
Because apparently we could set up a profile right now and put Ridley's thing in the age range

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
and you probably come up eventually.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
I think Ridley might be 53, I don't know.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
I can't tell.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
Well, it's apparently, Rob said he's tearing up, he's tearing up Los Angeles.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
He's tearing up Los Angeles.

20:05.000 --> 20:11.000
Like it's like Paul Bunyan's plow is making lakes using Tinder.

20:11.000 --> 20:16.000
And so this is, that text conversation was very unapologetic and very, very curt.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
I think he got swiped.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
God knows I did.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
Side-swiped.

20:23.000 --> 20:38.000
My friendship loyalty, Hyundai got, the rearview mirror got clipped by his fucking weird dick Ferrari.

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
All right, well let's thank Leo for explaining some of Tinder to me.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
I know you guys didn't need to understand it.

20:47.000 --> 20:54.000
I like getting, I like being older than people.

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
Especially women.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
Who wants to be younger than them?

21:03.000 --> 21:11.000
You guys, I'm sorry, that was funny, but I understand, I understand it.

21:11.000 --> 21:17.000
We have a new, I don't know, all right, let's clean up.

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
Jesus Christ, let's fucking, Leah came over and the place is a goddamn mess.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
She, she, she leaves her cheeto bull bulls all over the place.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
I was just swiping and fucking and that's all she cares about.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
She doesn't, she doesn't put anything back where she found it.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Except, you know.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Stop it.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
Don't go in, don't finish that sentence.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Please don't finish that sentence.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
She puts debt back where she found it.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
Okay, you finished, you finished the sentence.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
When I just specifically asked you to not finish the sentence and you finished the sentence.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
I wasn't sure you knew what I was going to say.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
I knew what you were going to say.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
That's why I said don't finish that sentence and you finished it.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
You finished it.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
You finished the sentence.

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
You, you're a finisher.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
All right, piece of shit.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
You're not a piece of shit.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
I'm sorry.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
I went, I went too far.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
You're a good guy.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
I'm glad I'm here.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
All right.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
All right.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
Thank you for swiping tonight's conversation about that.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
And now we're going to have a slightly more serious, more dramatic one.

22:25.000 --> 22:34.000
But it's also about, it's also about, it's about connections with strangers that are possible through technology.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
Let's put it that way.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Okay.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Let's do that.

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
I'll just unceremoniously bring him out because he's not really, he's not an entertainer.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
He's just a new friend.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
I met him, I met him at a, at a bar.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Which bar?

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
I met him at the drawing room, which is where everybody goes after the show usually.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
That's true.

22:50.000 --> 22:58.000
I was there on a, probably a Tuesday morning and, and, and started, started small talking

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
and then found out that this guy's got a pretty interesting story.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
I was like, would you please come on my show and let's talk about it.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Is he back there?

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
Is he, is he, is he ready?

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
No one's listening.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Oh, okay.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
Let's put, let's, let's, let's welcome our new friend Kyle.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Kyle!

23:14.000 --> 23:21.000
It's sitting that one.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Thanks for, thanks for coming.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Give it up for Kyle.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Kyle.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
I don't do this.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Damn met him at a bar.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Kyle.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
How's it going?

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Yeah, good, good.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
Thanks for, thanks for coming out here and telling us your story.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
It's, it's pretty, it's pretty personal, but it's also like a weird, like, like, like,

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
kind of TV movie shit.

23:41.000 --> 23:47.000
So I, I, I, I pressed him to come on the show.

23:47.000 --> 23:52.000
So, so, I mean, the, the, the, the, probably separates you from almost everyone in this

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
room, although it would be fun if there was one guy that was like, wait, me too.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
That would be pretty cool actually.

23:56.000 --> 24:01.000
Is that you currently have the, the beating heart of a complete stranger in your chest.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
I do.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
Having, having, having gotten a heart transplant.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
How many years ago?

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Actually today is my anniversary.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
11 years.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
11 years.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Whoa.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
With the service party.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Today was the day I got it.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Wow.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
How old are you right now?

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
What's that?

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
How old are you right now?

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
31.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
31.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Yeah.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
When I got it.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Yeah.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Cause you're, so let's start there.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
The reason why you needed a heart transplant is not because you were eating too many french fries.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
No, no, no.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
It was not.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
I was born with a disease called not disease.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Sorry.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
That's not right to say a transposition of the great vessels.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
So your heart is backwards and your blood flows backwards.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
And so you, so you, uh, you, you loved the rain and hated children.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
I did.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Yeah.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
It was like, I was like, I can't do this.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
I just, you know, you people get away from me.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
You would take Christmas presents.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
You were the Grinch.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
I was a Grinch.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
I was like studying at a household time.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Like bubble, you know, in a bubble.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Yeah.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
So you had this.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
So, so what, what, what, what, what is the nature of that?

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
Like we've got our friend, our friend, C could comes on sometimes and he's like, he's

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
been multiple aneurysms and they can't figure out what, why that is.

25:10.000 --> 25:16.000
But, but his, his prognosis is basically that he has to like, like, like just be satisfied

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
with the fact that at any minute, like something terrible could just happen in his brain.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
I mean, I'm still a little bit there.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
But you were certainly there before the transplant.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
That was real bad.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
You were just like, what did the doctors tell you before the transplant?

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Like what was your, what were your, what was your prognosis?

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Is that the word?

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
I was in heart failure.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
So my heart was dying.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
They did all they could do to fix it.

25:35.000 --> 25:41.000
After I had a five pacemakers and after the fifth one didn't work.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
So they were just, that was me going on a list.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Yeah.

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
So the doctors were pretty much like your only option is someone else's heart.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
So that described to us.

25:53.000 --> 25:58.000
And you always hear, I'm going, I don't know, heart transplant is a concept from the, from

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
from the news is like what I've never been able to ask somebody.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
It's like, so what, what is it?

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
You're not sitting in a hospital waiting because it took how long?

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Yeah.

26:07.000 --> 26:12.000
So basically after I graduated high school, my heart was a, I was in failure.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
And then my doctor, funny enough, she was hilarious.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Yeah.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
She's like, yeah, I don't trust any doctors in Washington to help you out right now.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
So you should go to Stanford and they will give you a better heart.

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
And so I went there, you go on a list, you get the process going.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
But they, they try to mend it as much as they can though.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
They try to, try to, or they try to mend the, like they try to fix it as much as they can.

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
So that's like another pacemaker, maybe something they need to like fix the heart valve, but

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
I didn't need any of that.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
It was just more pacemaker stuff.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
So it was just kind of that whole.

26:45.000 --> 26:51.000
So then the, the moment when a donor becomes available and it's like, it's go time, which

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
it must be a huge like rush and emergency.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Like you're not sitting in a hospital.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
You're hanging out.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
I'm hanging out at home.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
I was at home with my sister.

27:01.000 --> 27:08.000
She moved to help me out and my mom and got the call around dinner time, I guess, five

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
o'clock.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
Do you remember what you were doing, the moment that the phone rang?

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
It was cooking dinner.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
I liked to cook.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
That's what I do nowadays and I work in the world.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
What were you making?

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
What was I making?

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
Something without salt.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
French fries?

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Yeah.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Yeah.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Something real high.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Like I'm just going to do this or not.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
No.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Something low salt.

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
Something like I can't, my dietary restrictions were pretty minimal.

27:33.000 --> 27:39.000
But yeah, I was with my sister and I got the call and you never meet your transplant

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
doctor ever.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
It's not, they just do the surgeries.

27:43.000 --> 27:48.000
I have another doctor that helped me out and the doctor that called me is a fellow.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Right.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
So they, yeah.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
So when I get to that doctor thing or one second, just to get the picture, like, is

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
this a cell phone time or was this pre-cell phone?

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
Yeah, I think I had that like Nokia brick, you know.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
I miss that thing too.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Those were great.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Those were durable.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
It's a voice call.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
It's a voice call.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
They call this guy on the other line.

28:07.000 --> 28:14.000
And he just, his first words were you, Kyle, let's send you some, Kyle.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
And he just said, are you, how are you feeling today?

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
I thought it was pretty creepy.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
So yeah, I just go in and say that.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
And I was like, you know, my body's pretty good actually.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
I'm pretty good.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
But he said, are you feeling ready to get a transplant?

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
And I, yeah, that was it.

28:31.000 --> 28:38.000
He didn't do anything clever like, like, hey, can I get you anything?

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Like human heart.

28:40.000 --> 28:47.000
He's like, so I got this box or what's in the box.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Okay.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
So, so then you're like, holy shit, this is it.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
Yeah.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
How much fear is there versus how much like relief?

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Because I mean, I imagine the life is already fear.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
It was all fear.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Oh, really?

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
So you're not like, oh my God, this is better than nothing.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
Therefore it's all good.

29:02.000 --> 29:07.000
The chances were still like eight percent good, 20 percent.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
That sounds so terrifying to me.

29:10.000 --> 29:17.000
Like I'm getting anxiety just thinking about it because they have to break open your rib cage.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
Yes.

29:18.000 --> 29:23.000
And take your old heart out, put it on a plate.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
All right.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
Grab zombie.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
And then get a new one.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
And like, but you're going to.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
I'm going to kill my brain open too for fun.

29:31.000 --> 29:38.000
But seriously, they're taking your heart out of your body and connecting your, your, for

29:38.000 --> 29:44.000
I don't know if you know the details of it, but how long, I mean, like how long is your

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
body without a heart?

29:46.000 --> 29:52.000
Well, at the time though, when it happened, I mean, when I got to call it, that would have,

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
would have, would be my fourth open heart surgery.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
So at the time I didn't have a sternum.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
So they had replete.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
They just stopped.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
They put just for zippers in.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
They just kind of like zip it up, throw some cartilage back in there.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
And they're like, you're good.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
They're like, we're coming back in here.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
I don't want to, I don't want to be cynical, but I also don't want to keep stabbing you.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
You got to get a phone with it.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
So it's like, don't look down, Kyle.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
But at this time you'll thank me later.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
It's mainly tape.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
Wait, what do you have instead of a sternum?

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Well, I don't really know.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Is there nothing there?

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Yeah.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
I mean, as I'm touching myself.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Yeah.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Yeah.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
You know, just like, there's a little bit of a sternum there at the top.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
Yeah.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
Holy shit.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
So what is it?

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
So you're a serious danger that if you were to ever like take a car door to the, to the

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
chest, like you actually get really fucked up.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
Car door would mess me up or nice punch or you know, Jesus.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
All right.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
So, so then you go.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Follow me story for everybody here.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
Well, they've been through so much.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
All right.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Good sweet.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
I don't know.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Did you see the Aubrey Plaza episode?

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
It was.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
I listened to it.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Actually, I listened to it.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
I'm kidding.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
I did that for the laugh.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
I really enjoyed her.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
She's, she's really cool.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
She's an awesome person.

31:09.000 --> 31:14.000
And I go, that was for a cheap, cheap laugh because my, my interview was bad and it was

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
a very talented person and you're talking shit about her.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
I went for a very, very cheap, very terrible laugh.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Yeah.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
It was pretty shitty of you.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
It's a good person.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
It's not going to be shitty.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Never did anything.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Never said anything bad about you.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
It could have been anybody but her too.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
It would have been funny and also harmless too.

31:33.000 --> 31:38.000
Cause I feel like, yeah, I could have picked anybody.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
So, so yeah.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
Well, it is interesting about it.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
Like, like, like we won't have to spend the rest of the time on the actual operation

31:43.000 --> 31:47.000
because there's a meeting with the goddess in this Campbell's journey and then there's

31:47.000 --> 31:54.000
an atonement with some shit.

31:54.000 --> 32:00.000
But there on the table, that is a really important if child is questioned like, how

32:00.000 --> 32:06.000
in the hell this thing is like, it's a, it's the motor that keeps your body from dying

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
and then they're taking it out.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
What is it?

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
Like they, what do they do?

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
Do they put the.

32:11.000 --> 32:17.000
So you're on a, so my heart was, it was, I was actually, you know, when I got the,

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
when I got the call for it, I was actually crashing a little bit.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
So my heart was kind of, it was a lot more heart failure.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
There, I think it was borderline being hospitalized a little time.

32:26.000 --> 32:32.000
So, so what I got the call and you go in there and my heart was just, I was, you know, as

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
nervous as you can be, you know, just what's going on.

32:34.000 --> 32:40.000
Yada, you know, did some calls that I had to make to family, like goodbye or whatever.

32:40.000 --> 32:51.000
And I, they could not sedate me because I actually, first off, the, when I got the call, the,

32:51.000 --> 32:59.000
the, I had to spend the night in the hospital because the donor's family wasn't like ready

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
to, you know, let go of the, let go of the body.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
So, yeah.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
So that was an interesting thing to sit there and kind of wait for that.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
So it's.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
Interesting.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
Yeah.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
He'll fuck with your head a little bit in life and make you realize life a little bit

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
more.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
You're like, oh.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
You're in a hospital.

33:16.000 --> 33:21.000
You're going to drop by the doorway and go, listen, I know I'm not entitled to anything.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
Yeah.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
I've got blue.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
I've got blue cross.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
I've got blue cross.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
It's all right.

33:26.000 --> 33:33.000
So, but, but, but just physically, I'm just saying, like, like.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
Go into a room.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
They, I mean, you go in the surgery room.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
There's a machine that pretty much looks like a real to real.

33:39.000 --> 33:46.000
And it just, you know, after they get the ports into your valves, it's basically redirecting

33:46.000 --> 33:52.000
your blood out of your body into a re, or like a real to real to oxygenated oxygen.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
Give it oxygen.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
And then it.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
And then, yeah.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
So there's a machine.

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
There's a machine on the outside that like keeps you from dying while they disconnect your

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
heart.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
And then they put the Indiana Jones, the bag of sand in there.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
Yeah.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Pretty much.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
So that your body doesn't shoot the arrows.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
Makes sense.

34:12.000 --> 34:16.000
And they, and they, you know, there's probably, they're going to adjust the amount of sand

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
depending on the heart.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
The, okay.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Well, so, yeah.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
And we can, I'll, I'll Google the rest of that.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
I'm so interested.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
Because there's things that only you can tell us about.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
It's like your personal story.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
Gotta Google it.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Gotta Google that information.

34:31.000 --> 34:36.000
The, the, so then they zip you back up.

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
There's obviously all this terror now that you have this thing, because it's like, oh,

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
there's this percentage of chances.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
It's just, it's not going to work.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
Yeah, rejection.

34:45.000 --> 34:52.000
And, and see how the Tinder thing already thematic, fear of rejection, the swiping, the cell

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
phone.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Come on.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
It's impressive.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
I didn't.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
It's so impressive.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
I didn't even plan it.

35:00.000 --> 35:05.000
And I forced the connection, you know, improvisationally and apparently offended you.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
I don't know.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
The, the, the, so you're zipped up and you're done.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
You're recovered.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
Yeah.

35:12.000 --> 35:17.000
And so then here comes the, even the thing that definitely separates you from everyone

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
in the room.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Even if someone in here did have a heart transplant.

35:20.000 --> 35:25.000
Because then this thing that's not supposed to happen happens, which is that the family.

35:25.000 --> 35:31.000
Yeah, I don't know who weren't, you're never allowed to know who the donor is.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
They are.

35:32.000 --> 35:38.000
And the family somehow, I mean, the details, I don't know how they figured it out, but

35:38.000 --> 35:44.000
the deals are really, they, they were searching a little harder for, I don't know, they were

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
kind of doing their own investigation.

35:46.000 --> 35:52.000
They found my brother's website as a painter and he wrote something in the bio of like,

35:52.000 --> 35:56.000
my brother with transplant, yada, yada, and they just matched up like San Francisco area,

35:56.000 --> 36:01.000
yada, yada, and they ended up finding it out and contacting my mom.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
And yeah.

36:02.000 --> 36:07.000
So the family of the guy whose heart's in your chest tracks you down.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
And so did you, and then did you hang out with them?

36:10.000 --> 36:16.000
To be quite honest, I have never written anything to them or seen them.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
My mom has, she's talked to them.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
I don't know, maybe somebody should do.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
Oh, I didn't know.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
It's kind of a little hard.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
What did they want?

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
If they're talking, they, they went to talk to your family.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
What were they trying to do in that?

36:32.000 --> 36:36.000
They, they just want to see where, you know, just wanted to see what happened.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
See what happened?

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Yeah.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Sorry, I did not know that was coming from actually.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
No, no, no, you were answering Schrab before when you talked.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
That's Spencer.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
Who's talking?

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
Where am I?

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
Yeah.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
Sorry, sorry.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
Just imagine Dan's stomach is talking to you.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
That's the eye line.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
But no, an answer to the extent that you're feeling any guilt.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
I would immediately absolve you of it.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
As I would any war veteran.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
I would say follow, follow.

37:05.000 --> 37:11.000
Well, I wouldn't say follow your heart because then you'd grown and I would follow your bliss,

37:11.000 --> 37:16.000
follow your comfort, follow your, I mean, there's no, this is all epilogue and whatever you feel like doing.

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
Yeah, I mean, obviously they're breaking rules, tracking you down.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
They're following their fucking impulses.

37:22.000 --> 37:27.000
They're figuring out how to find where all the pieces went.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
But what's different?

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
What's different in your life now?

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Did you notice anything?

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
I mean, did you like, I, you know, I never liked pepperoni before.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
That's a big thing.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Actually, that happens with transplant.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
See, you're shaking your head real.

37:41.000 --> 37:47.000
I was like, yes, because everything, all of your, your interest in this is purely as a direct to video feature.

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
I want to see if he's like, oh, I saw a vision.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
I saw a vision of something.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
It's as if I was running through the bush.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
I got a werewolf's heart.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
You're a lichen, aren't you?

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
Well, hold on.

37:59.000 --> 38:04.000
No, but all of these questions are fine, but there's, there's a little more to the story.

38:04.000 --> 38:11.000
There's a final little, like, like, like, like cosmic fucking, like, insane thing.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
All right. Yeah.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Okay.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
Which I don't know where to file and didn't know where to file and thought you should just come in and share it.

38:16.000 --> 38:25.000
So even though you didn't communicate with them because they connected with your mom, the information came to you.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Yeah, they've seen photos of me.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
They know, I mean, they sent her emails.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
So now you know about the donor.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
And did you do any investigating of your own?

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Or was it just all information that came to you?

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
The information that came to me.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
I didn't want to know.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
I didn't want them.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
And so what did you find out?

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
What I found out.

38:43.000 --> 38:48.000
I found out he was from like Northern California.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
And he was 27.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
I knew that though.

38:51.000 --> 38:55.000
I knew the age of the time when I was getting it.

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
And then I found out how he died.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
And that was very interesting.

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
And that was basically, I found out he committed suicide.

39:06.000 --> 39:16.000
And that was kind of a little hard to hear because the stories were a little flip-flop of what I don't think people want to tell me.

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
What do you mean they didn't want to?

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
I don't think people want me to know that he took his own life.

39:23.000 --> 39:29.000
And that's, I don't know, I mean, it's horrible.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
But it's something that like, yeah, that's who...

39:31.000 --> 39:37.000
Well, it makes the mind race through so many strange calculations that you never have to perform.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
And I still don't know what the...

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
All I know is that that's insane.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
I don't know what it means, really.

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
I don't know if it means like, oh good.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
A person who didn't even want their hearts, they threw it away.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
And I found it in the gut.

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
Or is it like, I mean, no, it's not like that at all.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
It's a dumb question.

40:00.000 --> 40:04.000
For the life, I'm, you know, 11 years now alive, living.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
And it's always been a struggle too.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
Like my heart, like five pacemakers, all that kind of stuff.

40:09.000 --> 40:14.000
And just, yeah, it's, I mean, I'm grateful for it.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
It's hard to know that that's what happened.

40:16.000 --> 40:23.000
But that's kind of, that is, that's life, I guess, too, you know, people choose their own path.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
And that's, you know...

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
So another dumb question.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
And then I'll let Rob ask his fun questions.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
That's fun.

40:32.000 --> 40:36.000
He wants to know if you can jump higher now.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
I've been able to move one thing real slowly.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
It's kind of weird. I don't know why.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
You see the movie Phenomenon? Yeah, it's pretty good.

40:44.000 --> 40:49.000
He wants to know if Denzel Washington can help you fight crime by telling you where the cartel is.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
Can't wait.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
Do you feel where a treasure might be?

40:59.000 --> 41:04.000
But my one last grounded question, which is a pretty typical one, is just sort of like,

41:04.000 --> 41:19.000
well, it's like, like, so, like, all right, so, like, is there some, is there, is there, is there like a psychological or spiritual pressure that comes with...

41:19.000 --> 41:28.000
I mean, my mind is a lot more open to a lot of things and I believe in, I mean, I don't know, psychological...

41:28.000 --> 41:34.000
There's survivors guilt if you just live through something that people...

41:34.000 --> 41:40.000
But we never talk about, I don't know if there's donors, donation receiving guilt about like,

41:40.000 --> 41:45.000
oh, I better do something with this heart of the guy saw what I just did last night on that date.

41:45.000 --> 41:50.000
He'd be like, what are you doing with my heart?

41:50.000 --> 41:55.000
And you watched Hudson Hawk?

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
Yeah, why?

41:56.000 --> 42:00.000
And you made her watch it and she told you she didn't like it the first time and you...

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
And why are you a fan of it?

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Why are you a fan of it?

42:04.000 --> 42:10.000
Every beat is the one that I didn't get and we've used it to watch Hudson Hawk.

42:10.000 --> 42:15.000
I mean, is there anything like that about, like, did your view of your career change?

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
There's a lot of, yeah, a lot of transplant people.

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
There's a lot of guilt around that, I guess, that some people have.

42:22.000 --> 42:30.000
And yeah, maybe, I mean, internally, I don't have it on the outside of like, I feel bad.

42:30.000 --> 42:35.000
I don't, I mean, I love the life that was given to me to be here and to be living.

42:35.000 --> 42:40.000
So it's not, I don't, I guess I don't really have guilt, you know?

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
I have just, just...

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
A lot of the guilt...

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
Appreciation.

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
Yeah, a lot of the guilt must go away if you found out he killed himself.

42:48.000 --> 42:54.000
It doesn't have to be glib or anything, but it's like, he literally ended his life so that I could live.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
I mean, not so that I could live.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
Right, like with the Hudson Hawk scenario, yeah, when you get that cartoonish.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Yeah, it's like, yeah, you...

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
Yes.

43:01.000 --> 43:06.000
Well, I mean, it's better than somebody who wanted to live and got into a car accident.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
Yeah.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
No, it worked out pretty great, I think.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
Jesus Christ.

43:12.000 --> 43:16.000
That's, yeah, I guess so.

43:16.000 --> 43:20.000
But you've rolled these thoughts over in your head more than we have, right?

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
All the time.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
I mean, I could get rejection anytime.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Life is really quick.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
What do you mean by rejection?

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
Like, the heart?

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
My body could reject my heart.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
Even after 11 years?

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
Potentially.

43:33.000 --> 43:39.000
And actually after 10 right now, I'm really healthy, I think so.

43:39.000 --> 43:47.000
But the body can, yeah, the body eventually can start to reduce my meds, they'll change

43:47.000 --> 43:51.000
it, try to, I don't know, formula drugs to try to keep me alive.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
So you have to take drugs to keep the heart?

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
I take a lot of drugs, yeah.

43:55.000 --> 44:00.000
So you have white blood cells, I'm sure you all know that, and they attack foreign things

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
in your body, and mine is foreign.

44:03.000 --> 44:08.000
They're not attacking it right now, but if they ever feel the urge to, because my meds

44:08.000 --> 44:15.000
stop, and they can do that, because it's not me, it's not you, it's not a part of your

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
DNA.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
So are you like a Jessica Alba now?

44:18.000 --> 44:24.000
You can like see other like murderers having, like, I mean,

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
I'm a pre-cog, yeah, exactly.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Okay, cool.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
So how many ghosts are in the building?

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
There it is, there it is.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
Well, all right, yeah, I'm bad at closing things.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
That's fine.

44:37.000 --> 44:46.000
I wanted you to come meet the kids, and I wanted to learn about Tinder, and I wanted to,

44:46.000 --> 44:50.000
well, there was one thing that you said when we were talking about it, and I was like,

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
it was like you said, you don't even get anesthetic when you do the procedure.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Oh, Jesus Christ!

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
Right?

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
They didn't put you under, or they couldn't put you under?

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Well, they couldn't put me under, because my heart was...

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
No, anesthetic, okay, but not, they can't knock you out.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
They can't knock you all the way out, they have to keep you out like a, I mean, they can't...

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Are you fucking kidding me?

45:08.000 --> 45:12.000
So they're going, okay, so here we go.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
I'm sorry.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Yeah, so they do knock you out?

45:16.000 --> 45:20.000
Oh, I bet it hurts, but ooh, we're almost done, we're almost done.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
Almost done, yeah, almost done, almost done, almost done.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
One, two, three, ooh, okay.

45:28.000 --> 45:32.000
And that, okay, you didn't see that, you know, and you're just...

45:32.000 --> 45:38.000
That's exactly it, yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:38.000 --> 45:43.000
Were you like going, hit, there's a chair, hit me with something really hard, I don't...

45:43.000 --> 45:48.000
Well, they keep that like a, like, just a happy medium, like, I'm out, but I can hear things.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Oh, fuck!

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
And I can like...

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Oh, my God.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
I don't know.

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
And then your heart does have to stop for a minute, so there's that episode that they're always...

45:59.000 --> 46:03.000
So you heard your old heart stop?

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
No, I didn't hear it.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Oh, okay.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
You feel it though, you know?

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
You felt it?

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Well, you feel certain things, or you kind of...

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
I mean, you go somewhere else, you know?

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
You kind of like...

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Bummed out, right?

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
Life stuff, you know?

46:24.000 --> 46:29.000
But you said, there was a point, and I can't remember where it was, because as they were putting...

46:29.000 --> 46:34.000
There was a line that you had, where I...

46:34.000 --> 46:39.000
Because I asked you, like, what was the last thing you said before the procedure started, or something like that?

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Do you remember what I'm talking about?

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Yeah, I do, yeah.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
I'm just exploiting you, but...

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Fuck you, that's fine, you totally are.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
You fucking are, let's do it.

46:49.000 --> 46:53.000
I just was yelling out, I don't want to die, I don't want to die, yeah.

46:53.000 --> 46:57.000
I was with my mom and my sister, and that was...

46:57.000 --> 47:02.000
And they were wheeling me into the room, and that was my last words to them, and that was pretty much...

47:02.000 --> 47:06.000
It's funny, because when you were talking about it, I was like, immediately...

47:06.000 --> 47:11.000
There's a shame we associate with that.

47:11.000 --> 47:16.000
None of us wants to be caught any more than we want to be caught masturbating or taking a shit.

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
We don't want to be caught saying, I don't want to die.

47:19.000 --> 47:23.000
We look at it as this thing that, oh, well...

47:23.000 --> 47:29.000
And it's so strange, because it's like, well, shitting and jerking off, it unites us.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
We all have to do it, right?

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
I don't know, it's just like, I don't want to die.

47:34.000 --> 47:38.000
It's very, very underappreciated as a very profound statement.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
It's one of the most...

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
The thing that leopards can't say.

47:42.000 --> 47:45.000
You'll never hear it from a fucking giraffe, that's for sure.

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
If giraffes could talk, all they'd say is, now I can reach an apple.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
So proud of myself.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
I did it, mom, I did it, I did it.

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
Only we would ever say, I don't want to die, even though nothing does.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
I think it's human, it's in our...

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
We're animals, we're something, it's in our DNA.

48:02.000 --> 48:06.000
Yeah, and I've been through so much, and I don't want to die.

48:06.000 --> 48:12.000
And I've been clinically dead a few times, and it's like, yeah, it's...

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
I love people around me, I love to live, you know.

48:15.000 --> 48:19.000
And there was a dude somewhere that, for whatever reason, he did want to.

48:19.000 --> 48:26.000
And it's fantastic that some geniuses were able to use a part of them to keep your wish.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
It's really fucking incredible.

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
Yeah, my surgery was supposed to be five hours, and it was ten hours long.

48:31.000 --> 48:36.000
I lost a ton of blood, a lot of things, and my heart was swolled over.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
It was definitely a long ordeal.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Did they try to convince you it was your fault?

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Yeah, it took ten hours.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
You know, you really got to calm down.

48:49.000 --> 48:53.000
So you were half awake for ten hours.

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
I mean, I was out, they're not talking to me, you know, they're not like...

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
Well, no, they're probably hoping, they're ignoring you.

48:59.000 --> 49:03.000
They're like, if they look you in the eye, they'd be like, oh man.

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
Oh, by the way, did you hear that?

49:06.000 --> 49:11.000
You're not allowed to, the donor, the guy that performs the actual surgery,

49:11.000 --> 49:16.000
unlike all the other surgeries anyone has ever had, like the doctor doesn't meet you.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
You never see his face, you never know his name, right?

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
No, yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
Why is that?

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
Why is that?

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
They don't want that human contact, I guess?

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Yeah, I've watched The Nick.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
I know what you're talking about.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
I think that's interesting too, that the guys that do the...

49:32.000 --> 49:39.000
And ladies, goddammit, Harmon, the geniuses who's fingers are the most precise

49:39.000 --> 49:48.000
and who really know how to do this top of the line bomb squad thing in a human body,

49:48.000 --> 49:54.000
like they actually, if you go up the tiers enough, they're like the same as executioners.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
They wear masks and they...

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
They have to have a separation, otherwise they would probably blow their brains off.

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
Because all they want to think about is the math and the fucking...

50:02.000 --> 50:06.000
They just don't want that connection, like, you know, he was a great kid.

50:06.000 --> 50:11.000
There also isn't, I mean, more to the point that they probably, isn't about the outcome too.

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
They don't want to know what happens to you after you leave.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
They want to just walk away from it to the next one

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
because they want to be thinking about something they've read about you

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
while they're working on someone else.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
They'll read about me here.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Pretty nice.

50:25.000 --> 50:34.000
Well, let's all give Kyle a warm thank you for opening himself up

50:34.000 --> 50:40.000
and sharing his heart with us.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
Thank you.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Is there anything?

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Oh, you have that thing you wanted to plug.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
He's also doing a one-man show.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
No, no, no.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
I mean, is there anything as long as you're...

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
I just called you by your first name because I figured you're not a stand-up.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Plugging anything? I don't know.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
When you were clinically dead.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
There's a lot of that.

51:01.000 --> 51:04.000
So, how many times were you clinically dead?

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
Jesus, here we go again.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
Three.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
Three?

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
I think three, yeah, I think three times.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
All right.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
So, Ben Franklin?

51:15.000 --> 51:19.000
He was clinically finishing the segment and he saw the other side.

51:19.000 --> 51:26.000
He was going into the light and then you've pulled him back to a cold room where...

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
You just wanted to know more, man.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
I nailed it.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
I did a four-point landing.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
They applauded.

51:33.000 --> 51:39.000
He grabbed his hat and you have more Roger Corman questions.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
Come on, dude.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
I'm supposed to undercut you.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
This is my job.

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
I don't know where you read that.

51:47.000 --> 51:51.000
Between the lines.

51:51.000 --> 52:00.000
Well, anyways, thank you again, Kyle, for coming and sharing your self-opening heart sharing.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
Remember that?

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
More than one thing.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
I'm just going to play it.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
I brew beer.

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
If you all love beer, I'm trying to start a beer bar.

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
So, yeah, hopefully one day I'll get that going.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
All right, well, let me know.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Yeah, you know how to get in contact with us.

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
Let us know when the grand opening is.

52:17.000 --> 52:22.000
We'll do our version of Kickstarter, which is we'll all get drunk at your bar.

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
I got a brewer, probably.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
So, yeah, we'll brew beer.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Is it going to have a clever name?

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Like the aortic...

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Now who's Roger Corman?

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
All right, all right, all right.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
Who's ready?

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
A guy's coming up with log lines.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
The sleeve behind the sleeve of the door.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
I don't know.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
All right, thanks, Kyle.

52:39.000 --> 52:43.000
We'll check back in with him at some point.

52:43.000 --> 52:51.000
Dan, Dan, have you ever had surgery?

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
I had a biopsy.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
I got this...

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Ugh, gross.

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
What did you...

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
How many opsees did you buy?

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
That was stupid.

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
How good of a friend are you that you don't know about your...

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
I knew it.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
I was setting you up to talk about it.

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
I knew about it.

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
How good of a friend of you that didn't come to my birthday

53:11.000 --> 53:16.000
or say happy birthday kissing Dan Gooderman on Twitter

53:16.000 --> 53:21.000
and you don't say happy birthday to get no text?

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
Well, you're always hanging out with your Lego friends.

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
That's why we text each other.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
We love each other.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Well, I...

53:31.000 --> 53:36.000
When he was talking about how could you reject something

53:36.000 --> 53:40.000
after 11 years, it's in your chest.

53:40.000 --> 53:44.000
I was thinking about you, man.

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
And how possible it is.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
No, no, no.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Well, I think...

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
I don't know about you, but I think this is a very interesting podcast

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
I've put together.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
I think you're doing a really good job.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
No, no, no.

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
It's a mellow one.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
I don't need it.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
It's its own reward.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
It's a mellow one.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
All right.

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
I get paid in fun.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
All right.

54:10.000 --> 54:14.000
Spencer, talk about the Chinese or ISIS or...

54:14.000 --> 54:18.000
So you guys have heard about these murder vans, right?

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
No.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Murder vans.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
Murder vans.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
Oh, yeah.

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
Was that like the legend of beggar vans?

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
It's just...

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
Oh, God.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
All right.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
I knew it.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
Okay, shit.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
I knew I shouldn't have...

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
The white blood cells are getting suspicious.

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
I know.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
I know.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
I know.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
I'm with you guys.

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
I don't want to be here tonight.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
I knew it.

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
I knew it.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
It was nice of you.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
Oh, I know what we need to talk about.

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
Okay, so...

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
Okay.

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
Chits.

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
Okay.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
I'm so sorry.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
So every once in a while it appears we have to keep reminding you what a monopoly

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
guy is in screenwriting.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
Oh, yeah.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
Oh.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
Oh, okay.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
I thought...

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
I thought that's how I'm going to die.

54:58.000 --> 55:03.000
The end of a garb.

55:03.000 --> 55:10.000
It's always a person you least expect.

55:10.000 --> 55:16.000
It was nice.

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
It was thinking for doing us...

55:19.000 --> 55:20.440
You did do me a favor.

55:20.440 --> 55:22.000
He said, I'll do it if you're in a jam.

55:22.000 --> 55:27.000
I said, I am in a jam, or why would I be like that?

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
I'm in a jam.

55:28.000 --> 55:32.000
I haven't had my vitamins today.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.000
What vitamins do you take?

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
That excites me.

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
I take out...

55:35.000 --> 55:40.000
In order to do the bit, I had to be off my...

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
I said, vitamin C.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
Goddammit.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
Vitamin C.

55:44.000 --> 55:45.000
I know what it is.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
I'm just shocked.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
I know what you were saying.

55:47.000 --> 55:59.000
I know that's what the Lego people run on.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Nine movies.

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
Come on.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
They're Legos.

56:04.000 --> 56:07.000
Knock the coke off over there.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Couple too many Lego movies coming out.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
They're cocaine.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
They're not...

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
They don't call them Legos.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
They go bricks.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Thank you.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
So the monopoly, guys.

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
So the reason we're bringing this up...

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
I don't want to have to keep explaining this to you.

56:22.000 --> 56:28.000
I mean, you're basing this off of me who saw a commercial.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
Let's verify it first because I might be wrong,

56:31.000 --> 56:32.000
because I haven't seen the movie.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
The movie Sisters?

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Is there a monopoly guy in Sisters?

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Oh, there's a monopoly guy in Sisters.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
What's the monopoly guy in Sisters?

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
I haven't seen it.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
There's a woman wearing a big belt,

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
and they're like,

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Oh, have a good time at the championship.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
And she's like,

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
What?

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Where you won the belt at because you're a wrestler?

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
I did the joke bad.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
But yeah.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
But that is a monopoly guy.

56:54.000 --> 56:55.000
Yeah, no, it's a monopoly guy.

56:55.000 --> 57:00.000
If you go, Holy cow, if you have a movie or whatever,

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
do we want to say the origin of the monopoly guy?

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
Yeah, yeah.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Just to remind you of the new-time listeners,

57:06.000 --> 57:10.000
the monopoly guy is named after the moment in Ace Ventura 2

57:10.000 --> 57:14.000
when Jim Carrey is about to let a guy have it,

57:14.000 --> 57:17.000
and he's wearing it.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
He's dressed like the monopoly guy.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
He's bald.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
He's got a mustache, a monocle.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
He's in a tux.

57:22.000 --> 57:26.000
And the guy says, Oh, I don't like people who talk to animals

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
and make faces.

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
And Jim Carrey goes, I'm sorry, we haven't met.

57:31.000 --> 57:34.000
You must be the monopoly guy.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
And it's like, it's a joke.

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
But the problem is, with a monopoly guy,

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
and it's very clever as it turns out,

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
because you're kind of holding a monopoly over all of reality,

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
and it's not really fair that you're profiting a laugh,

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
which you really aren't.

57:49.000 --> 57:55.000
So then you, my friends, you're my Asperger's flock.

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
They're like, you know, I know I always qualify this by saying,

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
like, because for you guys, because you're going to be tweeting me,

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
well, isn't a monopoly guy all comedy?

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Because then you're always contriving everything,

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
and actually, actually, actually, actually.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Yeah, no, we're talking about, we're not talking about

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
it is or it isn't.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
We're talking about a thing.

58:12.000 --> 58:15.000
It's like, well, unnecessary roughness and football.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
I mean, what is it?

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Well, I've, I've, I've tried jockey.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
I'm just saying, like, it's a concept.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
It's like, like, there's, you know, there's,

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
there's places where lines are clearly crossed.

58:25.000 --> 58:29.000
So the monopoly guy, the actual monopoly guy one is one.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
Don't do that.

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
Back then it was then Water Boy with Adam Sandler,

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
the guy walks in, he's dressed like Colonel Sanders.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
All right, Colonel Sanders, and it's like,

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
it's supposed to be a laugh, but it was a scene closer.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
It's not fair. It's a monopoly guy.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
You can't do it. You're not allowed to do it.

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
You can't dress a guy up exactly like Colonel Sanders

58:45.000 --> 58:48.000
and go, zing, you look like Colonel Sanders.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
It's cheating.

58:49.000 --> 58:52.000
You can't, you can't dress a guy like Colonel Sanders

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
and, and, and, and now I'm going like,

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
hi, I know what you're thinking.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
I'm dressed like Colonel Sanders, but here's the thing.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
Like, you could throw it away and keep moving

58:59.000 --> 59:02.000
and do more with this character.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
Just like, let him be dressed like Colonel Sanders.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Call him Colonel Sanders.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Have that be the character's name.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
I don't care.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.000
I'm not here to tell you what to do.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
I'm here to tell you to stop doing that one thing.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
Right.

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
And the reason I tell you again is because according to Rob,

59:16.000 --> 59:19.000
this is a preliminary monopoly guy,

59:19.000 --> 59:23.000
alert code orange because it's based on a trailer, clip,

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
TV commercial.

59:24.000 --> 59:28.000
What's the new Christmas with the fartings?

59:28.000 --> 59:29.000
No, no, no.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
The new Seth Rogen movie.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
Right.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
That was, that was my guess at the title.

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
The night before.

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
The night before.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
The night before.

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
Anybody see the trailer for it?

59:37.000 --> 59:38.000
Oh, the movie's back.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Well, I don't, I'm not here to qualify

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
whether the movie is good or not.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
I hear actually, it's pretty good.

59:44.000 --> 59:49.000
But, I heard it.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
I didn't see it.

59:50.000 --> 59:53.000
We could talk after the show, but in the trailer,

59:53.000 --> 59:59.000
isn't there, Seth Rogen is talking to two little girls

59:59.000 --> 01:00:06.000
who are twins, who are in like a blue little dresses

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
and like pigtails.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
And he says, what does he say?

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
There's something about the shining.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000
He says, oh, okay, hey, you know,

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
you guys are from the shining or something?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Right.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Something like that.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
They said, you look, you look weird.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
He said, have you ever seen the shining?

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Yeah.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
You can't, I mean, I can't do it.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Maybe it's a great movie.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Can't do that.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
I'm a fan of everybody.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
That's not a joke.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
I'm a fan of everybody involved, but it's cheating

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000
because if you write in the script two girls that are

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000
dressed like the twins in the shining says,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Rogen says, have you seen the shining?

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
That you can't, that's cheating.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
It's cheating.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
You're cheating.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
You're cheating.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
You can't, you can't like, you're being a bully.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
You're being a bully, I think.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
You're being a bully.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
You're bullying.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
You're monopolizing.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:01.000
If I know I can, you're being, what is that in pool

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
where you're pretending you're being bad?

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
A pool, a pool, a hustler, sure.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
A hustler.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
You're being a hustler.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Man, shit.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
I don't know if I'm going to be able to score this one.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
You know, it's just like, all right, well, you know,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
what if I get, you know, if you, if you, if you,

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
if you don't do it, I'll give you 20 bucks.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Okay.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I did it.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
All right.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Okay.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
It's cheating.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Cheating.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Cheating.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
You're being a comedy hustler.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
We can't.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
We can't go to, we're not allowed on that set.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
We can't go there and tell these guys what to do.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
They're very successful.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Whoever's writing that movie, they're doing a great job.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Seth Rogen, they live in a house so big that if I showed up,

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
they'd be shot.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Yeah.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000
So I'm starting here.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
I'm starting here where the problem starts.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
25 year old kids in Los Angeles, he came out here from your

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000
turnip farms and you got big dreams and you admire me.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
You're like, I want to do what he did from Milwaukee to LA.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
I want to, I want to build myself from dirt without

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
permission.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Like Dan Harmon did.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Yeah.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
I'm going to play each of you, chase his voicemails and,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
and, and, and, and I'm going to be a TMZ and I'm going to,

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000
everyone's going to respect me because I'm a really respectable

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
person.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
No more turnips for me.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Yeah.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
I don't want any turnips.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
So I'm telling you, well, fine.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Yeah.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Come to my podcast.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
First of all, it's 10 bucks at the door.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Pretty high price considering.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
That's for them.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
They got to give the cost money to make a room this hot.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.000
My thing that is, is with the Monopoly guys, when did, when did,

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000
the first time I noticed the Monopoly guy was the origin of

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Monopoly guy in Ace Ventura, which came out when like 90,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
this is pre Pulp Fiction laughs.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Yeah.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
It was with, with kids making them laugh.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
I know.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
We were kids.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
We were kids.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
And it's still happening.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Still happening.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
People are still doing Monopoly.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
You guys stop it.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Don't do Monopoly guys.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
You're millennials.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
It's like, you're into stopping things.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Stop that.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Stop.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Or at least set it up, do Monopoly guy and then undercut it with

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
some kind of chicken 90 degrees to do a peer to peer Monopoly guy

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
where there is no Monopoly, where everyone just does their

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
own comedy for each other on an app.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I'm not going to, I'm not going to bitch about that.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000
What do you, what, I haven't seen the movie, but you know, like,

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
I need a movie.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Who needs a movie?

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Have you seen the shining?

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
I need to, I need to laugh until someone comes to your house and

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
like shouts up at the thing.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
What if a guy was dressed like a leopard?

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000
I don't know.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Okay, cool.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Five stars, please.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
How could you, how could you?

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Okay.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Haven't seen the movie, but I mean, like if, if the little girls

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
were like going, you're weird.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
And he goes, ha, ha, have you seen the shining?

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
And they would say, yeah, why do you think we're dressed

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
exactly like these, these two girls were the shining.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
We're the biggest fans.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
And then like, you know, the dad comes in with an axe like going,

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
hey, have you seen our favorite movie?

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:51.000
And then he goes, and then Seth Rogen goes, no, no, but have you

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
seen the shining?

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Yes, we have.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000
My daughters are dressed like this.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
And I'm dressed like Jack Nicholson.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000
And then all of a sudden, Scatman comes in going.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
And I was like, I don't believe this.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
You guys, you guys lured me in.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000
You waited for me to make the monopoly over the shining joke.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
You guys have really seen the shining.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
You totally seen the shining.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Yes.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
And then he would turn around and then the shining's actually

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
playing on the TV.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
And then he's like, one thing though, cause you had twins and

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
they're like, they're not twins.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000
And then a series of black and white photos of the most

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
horrific, do-it-yourself surgery.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
And then he looks really close at one of the kids' faces and

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
it's like, oh my God, yeah, there's just like flaps of like

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
badly sewn together skin.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
And it's like, it's fucked up.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
And they keep pushing in and dissolving and dissolving.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:49.000
And then it's Seth Rogen at the end going.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Credits?

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Yeah.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Maybe, yeah, do that instead.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Stanley Kubrick shot the moon landing.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Well, yeah.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000
And he confessed to it in the form of very many hidden things

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
in the shining.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Apollo T-shirt on Danny Boyle.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Or your schizophrenic.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
And you watched the shining.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
You decide.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
You guys have really seen the shining.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
You guys have really seen the shining.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Have you seen my friend?

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
My name, Fred and his wife, Wilma, are coming over.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.000
And a guy comes in with an orange shirt with spots on it

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
and a blue tie.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
And he's kind of fat.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
You know, that's a monopoly guy.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.000
I remember in the documentary for like the behind the music

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
thing for, never mind.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
No, no, no, come on.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000
We were at all Yankeveck and it was like, and then Flea did

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
an interview.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
And they were like, what did you do?

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
He's like, I don't know.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
I like his socks.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
But the one he did for us, yeah, but they have a do now.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Do you think that's funny?

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
I don't think that's funny.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Yeah, I like if Flea, he turned it back on the interview

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
or was off camera.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
He's like, I don't think it was funny.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
What did you think?

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Are you paying attention right now, sir?

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Oh, I'm shooting an E behind the music package.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
And the interviewer wasn't Mike.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
He was just like listening.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Oh, OK.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
That's a good point.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
But I thought that was a good move.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
I learned that from Flea.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Remember when we were thinking about moving my garage nine

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
feet to the right?

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Oh, yeah.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Making it bigger or something?

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
I mean, it still may be something.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
And then the guy came and he was like, OK, so here's the thing.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
And then there was this whole estimate.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
And then the Flea showed up.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000
And he was like, ah, I drum stuff.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
He's a drummer, right?

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Come on, Harmon.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Are you chicken?

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Oh, you always know.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Yeah.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Harmon hates it when you call him chicken.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
It's going to make it.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
We haven't ever heard that before.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000
It's going to make him publicly declare you're two and three

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
sucked in a documentary about it.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
As far as today's concerned, I know we never mentioned it

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
before, but when Harmon is called chicken,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
he just can't handle it.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Especially when it's me.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
It'll make anything happen.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Don't do it.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Yeah, I said in that documentary about Back to the Future

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
that one of the notable things about what a great movie

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Back to the Future is is that it breaks so many rules,

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
including the fact that Marty McFly is not really a very,

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
kind of flawed protagonist.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
He's like a very willing hero.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
He doesn't refuse a lot of calls.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
He just like charges across the threshold, blah, blah, blah.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
A lot of tweets from a lot of people with a very deep

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
relationship with that entire trilogy.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000
You did, like people who, honestly,

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
sometimes your relationship with a movie,

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000
you need to recognize that your feelings about Muppet

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Treasure Island have less to do with just cinema

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
and more to do with what was happening at the time

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
the movie came out for you.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
It's important to recognize objectively

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
masterful pieces of cinema.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
It's important that...

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Robocop.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Yeah, I don't like Robocop.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Better than Die Hard.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Die Hard's fucking awesome.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Anyways.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
And then people tweeting me and going like,

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
what about the chicken thing?

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
I'm like, what about the chicken thing?

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
I get so angry at you kids.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
The chicken thing is the kind of first thing.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000
I put it with the chicken thing.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
But how amazing is it that that guy,

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
the conspiracy theories guy,

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
he loves so much about the...

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
He knows so many details.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
He can see a 9-11 in anything,

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
but he clearly doesn't know anything about

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
back in the future.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
No, no, he combines two and three.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
He's like, yeah, that's the thing is that Marty McFly

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
when he's got needles in the thing.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
And it's like, dude, you're talking about the second movie.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
You're talking about a conspiracy theory.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Go watch the movie with your whole brain.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Your 9-11 hunt is costing you joy.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Like, this is a good movie.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000
It's about a time traveler.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I mean, he's like as into the Oolala magazine

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
as he is into the fucking DeLorean.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000
The guy that did the Oolala.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Oolala.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Oolala.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Oolala.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Yeah, half the dialogue from Back to the Future 2.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Yeah.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Oolala.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:39.000
I actually ran into the guy who landed in LA from New York

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000
and ran into one of the guys that shot that documentary,

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.000
which the documentary is successful.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
What documentary are you talking about?

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Back in time. It's called Back in Time.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000
You're in this documentary?

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Yes.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Oh, that's why you don't call me.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Back to the Future 2 and 3 are back.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:02.000
I didn't know you were in a documentary about anything.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
I don't make them all.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
We got sidetracked.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.000
I haven't seen you in a while.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.000
The last time I saw you was here.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Whoosh.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000
I'm getting older, Dan.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
This is what I do.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000
My life is my work and my output.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Back to the Future 2.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Cats in the cradle.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.000
You're going to Australia for 90 years.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Vancouver.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Oh, man.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Baton switch.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
I've been telling you this.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000
You said it was probably maybe going to be Vancouver,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
but originally it was Australia.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
That was like five minutes.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000
I've told you it's Vancouver.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
I'm going to Vancouver next year.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000
For how long?

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
About a year and a half.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
It's a long time.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Yeah, you better soak me up while you can and return some texts.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Hang out with me.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Camille hangs out with me.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Does he?

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Yeah, we all hung out.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000
We all hung out.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000
I invited you.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Nobody showed up to that.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
I saw the text chain.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Nobody came.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000
No, no, no.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Camille came over.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Emily came over.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Jillian and Steve Agee came over.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000
We had a blast.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000
I want to share with the kids the kinds of texts

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
that you think you deserve a response to.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000
I did it.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
What did I...

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I haven't...

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
This could be bad.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Don't get me fired.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Don't get me fired for my job that I'm hanging onto by a thread.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.000
This is just a picture of a medical...

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:59.000
This is just a dick with the vast difference in the...

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.000
In case you forgot what it looks like.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
But that's on the heels of you.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I'm sharing this because you did it.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Don't.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000
You're going to make me look really bad.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
That's private.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Those are the texts I respond to.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:25.000
You reminded me that our friend was dead out of nowhere.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
I was feeling sentimental.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
I missed you.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
I said, I heard, and he said, heard what?

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000
I was like, that he's dead, and he said, shit, that's right.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
You're the one that texted it, and he said, shit, that's right.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
And I said, well, he's in a better place,

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:44.000
and that's when I got the fucking dick pic.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:54.000
So fool me 800 times.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.000
It's a cry for help, man.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:03.000
It's mostly, it's like Lego people taking shit,

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
blow-drying your dog in slow motion.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
It's a good one.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000
That's a good one.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:16.000
I wish we had 80, so we could be like Tosh.0 up in this mug.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000
We should.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000
We should.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
You could blue screen that.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
You did share with me.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
You got a little bit of trouble because when you were up here.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Don't.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Don't.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Don't.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
I don't want to bring that up.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
It's still repairing.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Don't.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000
No, I didn't.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
You really are trying to ruin me.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000
No, I wasn't.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000
You're just looking for things to talk about.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Oh, let's bring DeMorge Brown up.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Hello.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:59.000
DeMorge kicked ass at the Channies last night.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Thank you.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
What is that, the 12th annual Channel 101 awards?

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Is it the 12th?

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Yeah, I think it was 12, right?

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Yeah, 12 years.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Where's Channel 101?

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Hosted by Brady Novak.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Brady was really fucking on.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Just running around like a madman.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000
The first Channies I ever missed.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000
No, that's not true.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000
I've missed some Channies before.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000
I don't remember you missing a Channies.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I think there was a Channies I had to miss.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
I don't remember it.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Okay.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000
But Brady had like songs he wrote.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Running and dancing.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
He was out of breath and factored that into the comedy.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Yeah, it was really funny.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Oh, there's just pictures of actual dicks like photos.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Weird.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000
You don't respond to them.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000
So I keep...

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000
I mean, like you don't...

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000
You have to find the right one.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
I sent you a picture of a dick and you don't do anything.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
So I figured you didn't get it.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:48.000
So like the guy in the writer's room who keeps pitching the same joke because no one's responding

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.000
to it.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000
I mean, I...

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Look, maybe we could pick something that we watch together or something because I don't

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
watch TV anymore and I'm divorced.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Like there's no reason to watch things and I just...

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
I don't watch fucking crap movies.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Watch like Hologram Man and...

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
What was the movie you played at your birthday?

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Oh, Street Wars.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Holy crap.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000
That was a good night.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
That might have been the greatest thing I've ever seen.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Dan didn't go to that either.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000
My birthday.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Wasn't Street Wars the ultralight airplane one?

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Yeah.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Oh, man.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Okay.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000
That's a good movie.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000
We got to tell the people about it.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000
It's about a gangster movie.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000
It's the best thing.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Okay.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000
It's a movie from night...

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Check this out.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Find Street Wars on VHS or DVD.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:40.000
But it's a movie from 1992 that saw like boys in the hood and went, you know what this movie

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000
is missing?

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Ultralight aircraft.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Ultralight aircraft.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.000
I mean, it's not going anywhere.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Yeah.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
They thought hip-hop was a fad.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Right, right.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Now they think ultralight aircraft is a fad.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000
There's a hip-hop in it, too.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Yeah, there's a lot of hip-hop in it.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.000
It's like a fully-realized film with a soundtrack.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
There's a dance in it.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.000
There's a Humpty-Hump dance movie.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:12.000
It's all leading up to, now we're going to get into our ultralights and we're going to

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.000
take back the streets and they get into their ultralights and they take back the streets.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
It delivers on the poster.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
It's great.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Street Wars.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000
I like movies like that where it's clearly like the movies made by a company.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Like a karate studio or a dance studio.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Miami Connection.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Yeah.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Or an ultralight dealership.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
We should make a movie.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
I think that's great.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Somebody says, I'll give you the money to make your movie about street life if you show some

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
of my product in your film.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Oh, that would be amazing.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Yeah, I kept thinking it was just like the same people, but that would be even funnier

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
that somebody was like, I'm a really passionate filmmaker.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000
I'm like a pre-John Singleton or a contemporary.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:08.000
I don't know what year that movie was, but it's like, I just want to express my point

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000
of view about what it is to grow up in the environment I grew up in.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000
And then someone's like, well, I'm not paying for it.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.000
I'm not paying for it.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
I'm not paying for it.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000
I'll pay for it.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000
I'll pay for it.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000
My name's Bob Ultralight.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.000
From your local ultralight dealership.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Did you have fun at my birthday party?

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.000
I had a blast.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
I'm so glad you were there.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000
That was really great.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Thank you for coming to that.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Thank you for coming to that.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000
I invited Dan and Spencer.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000
I caught up with old friends I hadn't seen in a while.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Yeah, me too.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
A lot of old friends I haven't seen in a while.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
A lot of good friends.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
A lot of new friends.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000
This is cool.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000
This is so cool.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000
There's a point in the movie, the first time you see the ultralight, they're like, they're

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000
hanging out.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000
I don't know where they are.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000
And one of the main characters flies down in one.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000
And there's a whole conversation where the guy's like, what is that?

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000
And then he explains.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
He goes, you don't have a license to fly.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000
And he goes, I don't need one.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000
And then he goes through like a point by point explanation of the code that allows him.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
The government doesn't yet recognize these as vehicles.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
So he can fly them.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
They're basically chairs with propellers.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Yeah.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:22.000
I love the part of the enthusiasm for it is that it's totally fucking dangerous.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
And at any moment we'll be banned or regulated.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
But there's a loophole.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Yeah.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:35.000
The gangsters are on the ground and they're not even like the right, they're wearing,

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
they're all wearing one shot.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
They're all wearing overalls.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000
You're wearing overalls in bright colors.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000
And then the guys come flying in at night shooting at them.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
And then one of them turns around and shoots back.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000
And the guy goes, I'm hit.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000
I'm going down.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
And then they yell out, you got T-Bone.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
You got T-Bone.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
I wouldn't have turned around and talked to that ultra light.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
I would have blown out.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
I cut like an hour out of that film too.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Like I went to the whole film and just went to the good stuff because when they get to

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000
the ultra lights and you're like, all right, they got to the ultra light stuff.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:16.000
It's just like sit back for 45 minutes of the same shot of the ultra light flying through

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:23.000
the frame and a guy on a sound stage going, it takes forever.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Yeah.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Yeah.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000
The death to squib ratio is a little lower.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Yeah.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
So it was like my 46th birthday.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.000
I only have one of those in my life that I'll have.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
You know, I only have one, but I'm glad you were there, Demar.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
We've known each other for a long time.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Not as old as, you know, you know, not the oldest friend I've had, but, you know.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
But I'm glad you were there.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000
I was good.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Thank you for having me.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Yeah.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
I was doing something important.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000
I can't remember what.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Not tweeting, happy birthday.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000
I was in New York.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Yeah.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.000
I mean, what am I supposed to do?

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Text, happy birthday?

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Question mark.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.000
My dad hit me with a belt.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Skud serial number is your birthday.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Wait, Rob, so when you were coming up, when you were coming up with Skud, were you like,

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.000

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Dan's birthday.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
And I know exactly what that is.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000
No, no, no.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:40.000
I was, I was, I remember it because I was, this is how old it was.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000
It was like 1993.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:47.000
I was at Dave Friedel's like bedroom and he had like what, weasels.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Remember his ferrets or whatever that were like biting each other and fighting and it

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:57.000
smelled like weasel piss and, and, and because I didn't know how to do work.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:02.000
It was like one of those Macintoshes where the monitor and the, would you put that?

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Yeah.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:07.000
And he was designing, he was helping me design the attention sticker on the back of Skud

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000
and he was putting it in there and I got a, and you were there.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
You were like sitting on a couch or whatever.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
And I said, hey, we need a serial number.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Hey, Dan, what's your, your, your birthday?

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
And then I put it in there.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000
It's been that way.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:25.000
One, three, seven, three.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
That means it's coming up.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:33.000
I, I, I let you direct season six.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Yep.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Look what that got you.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000
I killed you.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Yahoo.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000
I killed it.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
I killed Yahoo television.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000
I killed it.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000
They went, no, we're not going to do anymore.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
I gave you Sarah's show.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000
I was like, you should have.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:56.000
I, this guy, this guy deserves this.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.000
I am, I am.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000
You did that, you did that a while ago.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000
You did that, you did that a long time ago.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000
You did that a long time ago and that was that.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
I know there's something since then.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Yeah.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Those gourmet olives.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
No, you just forgot.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000
It's fine.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000
You forgot.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000
You forgot about it.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
You forgot about me.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:31.000
How's it going?

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000
I am sorry.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000
I'm sorry.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000
You know what?

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.000
I acknowledge that I forgot your birthday and I feel remorse about it.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000
I do feel bad and I'm going to remember your next birthday.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Did you go through the three stages of Apollo?

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Three stages of apology that our therapist has told us about.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
That is the three stages of apology.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Yeah.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
The three ingredients of a proper apology.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
That's, Aaron didn't like that either.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000
What are you counting off of?

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
No, because I've used that.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000
I, I, I, I use, I, I, I, but it's still, I mean.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
We go to the same therapist, not on purpose.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Not together either.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Although we should probably.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.880
Well, you got you you've got her number from me. Yes

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:19.600
So on purpose. Yeah

01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:25.720
I'm not doing it to get like good. So was he saying about me nothing. Why is he not talking about me?

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:34.080
Motherfucker ain't talking about me at all every every third person that comes down the stairs is someone we know

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:39.720
Like like like our therapist is like some kind of like John love it

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:41.600
every

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:48.200
Every every crazy person in in in Los Feliz goes goes there and I always go you're crazy

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:53.600
And they go you're crazy. You did that bit with me. I know so you do that bit with everybody

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:00.880
Unbelievable

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:05.520
Is it is this been a good show or I think it's a fantastic show

01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:10.120
Yeah, I'm not I don't really have a very objective

01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:15.400
standpoint it seems to me that it's been a nice a nice little

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:17.080
ride

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:20.040
With I got six pack I'm out and do tell him

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:31.520
I got nothing oh Isis tomorrow to talk about Isis

01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:34.880
What is Isis stand for

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:43.720
What we look this up what look this that's those are the easy words. Well, I don't know what is it?

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:45.760
Yeah

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:49.360
Rack and Syria or Iraq and Lafont right? Is that what the ISIL is?

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:54.280
Yeah, that's why that's why if you're an NPR you call it ISIL because it's like really more like going you got a

01:24:54.280 --> 01:25:00.040
Goa well, you're supposed to call it dice because it pisses them off

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:06.320
Oh, really what they say. Yeah, they say they they they they pledge to kill anyone who calls them dice. Well, Jesus Christ

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:11.400
Well, that's a Voldemort said to and look what happened there

01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:20.040
Yeah

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:26.920
So that was his idea don't don't ever say my name. He seems more vain. I don't know who came up with I think everybody else

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:33.600
I mean like you're just asking for trouble. Yeah, it's gonna be something. Yeah, it's the Streisand effect. Yeah, that's what Voldemort died of

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:37.360
Don't don't call me Streisand

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:40.440
Don't you dare call me Streisand

01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:44.960
Don't stress. Do you call me Streisand? I'll put a hex on you

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:47.600
Don't call me Streisand

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:52.640
Don't you dare if you call me if you call me Streisand

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:56.640
I'm gonna come out of I'm gonna come down there

01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:00.760
With my cane and I'm gonna just I'm gonna whack

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:09.920
Halfway through committing to that I gave up

01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:15.080
Not where you think it is

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:17.080
The

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:23.640
Well, the alarming thing is this is what I keep running through of my head now as I like how

01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:29.400
How actually effective this I mean, I don't understand as a 42 year old

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:35.720
I grew up in a world where the concept of terrorism was like it was like these Fisher price figures

01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:40.760
And they got the outfits and they're like one of their defining features is like no graphic design

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:47.400
No, no, I mean these guys are like, you know, these are these are kids now new. These are millennial terrorists

01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:51.680
Their their videos are, you know, very JJ Abrams inspired

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.640
They like their little

01:26:54.960 --> 01:27:02.920
Time rampings and you know, they know their way around Final Cut and it's weird because it's like it's like it's

01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:06.440
For no other reason that it just like changes everything

01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:13.420
That that and also I think the other thing that makes them new is that they

01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:19.440
Whereas I think the I think when I was a kid what we call the terrorist was somebody that was kind of

01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:24.160
Foolish enough to say well, I'm just gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna create this

01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:31.720
Catastrophe and it's gonna punish this country for doing this and then they're gonna think twice before the blah blah blah

01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:33.080
And all that kind of thing where it's just like well

01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:38.240
This is just gonna play out in a pretty predictable way. You're not you're no one's ever gonna, you know, blah blah blah

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:41.040
And that these this is like like like their goal

01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:49.120
As far as I understand it their long-term larger goal is simply to provoke simply to actually

01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:54.920
Polarize and I hope there was a real sneeze and not a good guy who's like bullshit

01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:56.920
The

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:08.880
Their goal is simply to polarize right this is not a conspiracy theory. This is like this is I've heard this again and again

01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:12.880
And it's like like what they want and what they are so close to

01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:23.360
Having because it's like it's so it's there a couple of blown-up things away from this goal from polarizing is for is for is for is for

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:28.720
Rational people not just like paranoid Jingoist nutbars

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:32.680
Like rational people to start getting so

01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:43.000
Freaked out and scared that we just started to just figure the solution must be more irrational than rational because right now we still have this like

01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:48.000
This this this hold on this idea that as complicated as things are getting

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.840
That they like like like we have to we have to make sure we compartmentalize in our heads

01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:58.040
They like like this is not a this is a this is a war between people that want to fight and people that don't want to fight

01:28:58.040 --> 01:28:58.680
as

01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:02.440
This is not a war between between people that want to fight that are

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:09.320
Have one flying and people this is like the people that love fighting are trying to fucking cajole us into like a

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:15.240
Crazy fucking like weird form of World War three where it's just like

01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:18.440
We're the where we just start doing crazy shit, which we've done in the past

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:26.080
Which is like right? Let's start rounding people up and it's already been being proposed by our fringe elements like let's start tracking things

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:31.520
Let's start keeping lists. Let's put you in a I'm sure you're great if you're not guilty you've nothing to worry about

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:36.040
But why don't you stay in this chain link pen for a second? We're just it's just about freedom and

01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:43.880
And it's and it's and that those people are not gonna fucking go in there and go you know what America's

01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:49.240
Fantastic, and so is the entire Western world, and you know what sucks my religion is why I'm locked up in this cage

01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:53.800
That that the cycle will create a shitter get off the pot

01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:57.360
showdown between people who of

01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:05.360
the Islamic faith radical or not and people from Western society Westernized society a

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:14.640
A crazy or not I like that even the moderate people will all just like be sucked into this horrible fucking nightmare

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:20.080
And that and that shit will hit the fan and spray all over all of us and we'll have shit all over us that that's their goal

01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:26.360
That's that shit on us that they're not they're they're not dumb enough anymore to be like oh, I'm gonna

01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:33.480
We're gonna beat this country or that could they're just like no the fucking list is

01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:39.960
Like what Charles Manson thought he was trying to do by spray painting the n-word on like you know on the wall

01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:43.520
Where he killed people's like his his idea was like this like long-term like

01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:49.960
destabilization thing and it's doesn't it feel like they're getting really close to that goal

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:55.520
Like I don't know how we're gonna get further away from that goal. I don't know how we're gonna get less scared if

01:30:57.200 --> 01:30:59.480
I don't know how to relax more

01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:07.360
But I only I only know how to get increasingly more uptight and frightened and more like like willing to any one of those groups

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:10.480
Is at that point right now if that's

01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:14.560
Because if you want to do that then you simply have to do that

01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:18.680
It's just it's just you know if somebody wanted to scare the shit out of people. That was your sole goal

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:22.600
They could for lack of a you know

01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:29.480
Better I just you know load up a device or whatever go off to the highway somewhere pull off the road and set that off

01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:34.360
That without any explanation or any rational connection to it and no claim to it would be the thing that would be the most terrifying

01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:38.320
Right, so but I think that these broad these issues are

01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:44.600
Multiphasic there are so many different things that are a play and specifically in this case because

01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:50.640
Fundamentalism is at the center of it. There is a core center and there is a core center

01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:52.640
schedule

01:31:55.200 --> 01:32:00.800
For what's going on but outside of that it's it's you know where it reaches out from that core center

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:07.320
They're just a lot of different sort of sets of goals and they're into individual there individual in their own sort of

01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:12.680
Way they're gonna play out on what those individual goals are so certain things are happening

01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:14.640
but

01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:19.320
They're happening in their own sort of arena and also we see on our end of it

01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:25.040
The packaged news version of it even now when news is 24 hours a day and it's all over the place

01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:27.680
You're being told you're getting breaking news

01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:32.440
But again depends on what you're reading and where you are and whether how you know what the moment is and what the source is

01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:38.640
How filtered or unfiltered or how breaking it is, but it's all packaged so what you're not getting is

01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:42.560
And this is probably a good thing. You're not getting a clear sense of what

01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:46.440
For example the extent of our interdiction is on this

01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:50.120
One of the reasons it's just not running buck wild and going crazy is because

01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:58.320
The opposing force unified sort of interdiction on it is is strong. It's powerful Intel and and these

01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:01.420
Horses that are sitting there gramming a formation

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:07.520
Closing down things letting you know when they've stopped somebody letting you know sometimes not letting you know when they have because it's

01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:09.800
better for the longer goal

01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:12.840
all that stuff is

01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:19.000
Happening outside of your sight unless they want you to see it so

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:27.300
What we're seeing we are by virtue of being audience to this trying to attach a plot to it

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:32.200
Trying to foresee an end game to it trying to attach all these sort of

01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:40.140
Narratives to it, but really what it is is just these sort of this pulse-like movement of let's probe in this case

01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:42.660
There's a hole. Let's go get that

01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:48.380
There's a hole that hasn't been exploited. Let's just wait. It's just wait. Let's just wait now

01:33:48.380 --> 01:33:50.700
Let's do it, but all these things are coming out all at the same time

01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:54.320
So I think that on the one hand we are audience to this and

01:33:55.020 --> 01:34:01.380
What we're reacting to what with the tenant that the temperature of the water that we are feeling right now is real

01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:06.100
But it's reactive to what we're being allowed to see what we're being allowed to read

01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:09.340
But what's really going on is much more detailed much more specific

01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:15.220
And it's happening in pulses. It's a it's a very pointillistic thing and in each one of those cases

01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:17.220
There's a whole inventory of stuff that's happening

01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:22.740
Outward incursions that are coming forward whether they're quiet incursions or more aggressive incursions and then also

01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:27.860
The reportage and an interdiction that's going on around how much people actually know

01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:31.180
Unless you're in intelligence

01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:34.140
It's really really really really really unclear

01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:42.100
And so this is why it is really important for people to see as much as they can read as much as they can and then use these

01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:47.300
Sort of general principles of critical thinking so you know what your sources are what their biases may be and

01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:52.620
Getting multi-source information about one incident or one thing allows you to determine for yourself

01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:55.260
What you think the narrative is because for each person out there

01:34:55.260 --> 01:35:00.700
There's a separate narrative of what is actually going on. I don't think that the sole goal is to

01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:03.460
to

01:35:03.460 --> 01:35:08.780
Scatter publics that any sort of unified public certain here confidence that this is that we have

01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:15.340
Corey you talked about you don't think at least that when I think that's part of their meetings that they go like no big big big picture

01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:19.140
Because I mean no, no, I do think that's part of it, but I think that there are other within that

01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:21.900
I think there are other more to specifically to sign defined

01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:25.460
Measures and goals and there are things that are targeted

01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:28.140
That's great. I mean, yeah, that's certainly

01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:30.140
To I mean

01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:33.460
Listen Frazier all I want to know is where the bad guys are

01:35:34.740 --> 01:35:36.740
No, no, I

01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:39.940
Like that that advice from what I called of it is like yeah

01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:44.100
Be smart and like understand that they even the internet is mostly garbage and that

01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:51.060
Everything is a narrative and everything's being assembled and pre-processed and that and that and that I think maybe not to put words in your mouth

01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:54.140
But like maybe I just did a little diatribe about how

01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:58.020
the bad guys want everybody to hate each other and

01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:03.900
Like maybe adding to that also we're getting our news from good guys that don't necessarily

01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:07.660
Lose money from us hating each other

01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:10.500
So it's

01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:18.380
Like this country needs nothing more right now than a nice solid clean enemy with a logo

01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:25.540
Like and and and and you know, they've they're stepping up and we're going like I'll take the number five with cheese

01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:32.020
You look at like like a good example is like I can't feel the guy saying but the former KGB agent who was was

01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:34.940
radiated

01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:43.300
That means he that means he hasn't been listening for 20 minutes, that's that's what he does he picks one

01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:50.260
Looking at my he puts his glasses down. I was looking at the text that you've been sending me over the last oh come on

01:36:51.220 --> 01:36:57.580
All right. All right. Hey you home. Yeah, give me a bit got a tend to some cat

01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:12.660
It wasn't even clear who was saying what?

01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:15.900
You were calling me a fucking idiot

01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:31.980
You were coming over a half hour early in specify. No, you were saying Schrabbing over

01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:44.300
The the the there's a geopolitical tinderbox underneath this right now

01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:51.940
Powder keg you guys could be talking about the Packers. I could I'm so I'm so I don't know my brain

01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:54.060
You know

01:37:54.060 --> 01:38:01.980
I'm the definitely I'm the definitely the Gargamel in this situation. I can't

01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:07.500
But I only have my bucket is only so big

01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:17.380
Spencer disappeared he just like evaporated he like went away. He's gone. You're not making fun of him

01:38:17.380 --> 01:38:24.100
He gets a buy. I don't get a buy. I'm a fucking idiot because I came over a half hour early

01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:28.020
September 21st

01:38:31.860 --> 01:38:38.540
I mean the truth I remember that day I was I had just gotten home and I was I was about to masturbate

01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:41.740
Dude, we have an agreement

01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:48.100
I'm like scrubbing over and I'm like scrubbing over my that doesn't mean you have to come downstairs. I get it

01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:52.780
How many times I get it dude. I can't come that way. I

01:38:54.380 --> 01:39:02.380
Talked up like oh, sorry. I'm no I got it buddy. I'm just down here to take your time. I'll go I'll go to the grocery store

Oh, we live together on Norton. It was like that. I was younger nothing

01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:22.140
Now it's like fucking, you know news can put me out for a week, right? That's true

01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:25.220
So Isis is pronounced how?

01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:33.740
Dice dice I think but if you say it candy man comes and kills you that's what it's alright

01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:38.380
Okay, I mean, I don't know or but we're not supposed to be scared, right? Okay. We're not scared everybody shopping

01:40:10.340 --> 01:40:14.380
But I'm just I'm just curious. Have you listened to the public enemy song

01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:18.620
Where we talked about no, what?

01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:24.460
Back we back up. I don't know what you what's the big public enemy song that number one

01:40:24.460 --> 01:40:29.620
I'm not gonna look at them large when I ask. I'm looking over on the space because we're all beams of light

01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:37.620
Public enemy had the big number one that was there they're fucking like fear of a black planet. Well, that was the album

01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:42.980
What was the song? I didn't say was hello. Can you go to throw whatever other nose?

01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:46.100
Bring the noise, right

01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:53.140
That's anthrax so listen to bring the noise, but not the anthrax version. Okay. Yeah, I won't know I won't listen to that

01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:58.380
I'm talking to Steve leafy. You were looking at me, man. I'm not gonna listen to it

01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:00.980
I won't listen to that ever. No, I know that

01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:05.860
No, I'd like to know I won't listen to it

01:41:07.820 --> 01:41:10.780
Yeah, I don't like scratching your pants

01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:18.660
Come on get your chin off your chest. Let's look at these people

01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:25.820
Come on look at who you're talking to for once. There you go now. All right, you ask your therapist and she'll tell you

01:41:25.820 --> 01:41:29.580
I'm capable of dissolving relationships that are supposed to be forever

01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:36.420
I don't know any any fucking bounds

01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:46.740
I'll go to the bathroom and you know after after using me and then I'll be in there for a long time and you'll come in

01:41:46.740 --> 01:41:48.740
There'll be a curtain blown in the wind

01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:54.700
And then and then you'll see a black-and-white photo of me like as a in Alaska ice fishing

01:41:56.140 --> 01:41:58.580
And I'll be like and it'll be from 1911

01:41:58.580 --> 01:42:06.460
That's how that's how that's how that's how far away from you all get I'll become a weird like like a

01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:09.180
psychological thriller

01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:14.580
With a question mark for an ending you won't even know you'll you'll have to write a paper about it just to yeah

01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:16.580
Yeah, I don't think I'll do that

01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:19.780
I'll skip the paper

01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:28.380
Do people read newspapers anymore? I mean come on. This is me. Oh, what's happening?

01:42:31.780 --> 01:42:33.780
The weather

01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:36.100
Who does that?

01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:51.940
I mean seriously nobody does that anymore. Kill more trees. Anyway, take no prisoners. Yeah

01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:54.500
So so

01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:56.100
newsprint

01:42:56.100 --> 01:42:58.100
Ink on your fingers

01:42:58.100 --> 01:43:03.020
Under your fingernails by the way journalism industry if you're listening to me. I pray you are

01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:08.180
I've been repping here and all that you're wondering. How are you gonna save journalism?

01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:14.820
There's no just make a seal make a thing get together with the last of the journalists that still exist have a meeting

01:43:14.820 --> 01:43:19.620
You know, it doesn't have to be a government thing make it a private consortium of respected

01:43:20.220 --> 01:43:22.220
journalists

01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:26.300
You know that I've made of the an impartial kind of like consortium of

01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:33.060
of journalist experts and that that and create a thing that you put on a website if your website

01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:38.220
purports to be taken seriously as a source of actual news that you would then

01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:44.540
Like like just put a little logo in the corner. That's very very distinctive and oh, how do you enforce that?

01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:46.780
No stuff. It's like it'll be better than nothing

01:43:46.780 --> 01:43:53.260
It'll be a barrier between fecal matter and drinking water on the internet like if it looks like so that's it because this is

01:43:53.260 --> 01:44:00.100
Yeah, so like like stop this because the fucking senators talking about videos that don't exist of babies looking at the camera and going

01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:02.100
Help me before they get a board

01:44:03.940 --> 01:44:06.260
Because they read about it and fucking

01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:10.900
Shark Mike

01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:13.140
World dot blog org

01:44:13.540 --> 01:44:16.020
I and and and he's doing a bit

01:44:16.620 --> 01:44:20.740
That no one knew about anyways. All right. Just wanted put a little seal

01:44:20.740 --> 01:44:26.580
Yeah, purported purported just dude said interdiction. I don't even know what the fuck

01:44:28.260 --> 01:44:31.300
No, I'm agreeing with you. I'm gonna ask later

01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:37.460
I'm so that I was too stupid. I was too stupid to be proud of myself for wanting to know. I'm so stupid

01:44:37.460 --> 01:44:39.960
I'm too stupid to ask. What does that mean? I

01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:42.860
Don't I just I just listen

01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:47.340
Contextually I got over time it meant like intervention or

01:44:47.340 --> 01:44:51.180
Interview taking a circumscription circumventing

01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:56.260
Look all I want to know is where they are

01:44:57.820 --> 01:45:01.060
You know what can I just say I should say this though. This is outside of all that stuff

01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:06.020
All right, and back to the first one. Here we go the Channey words yesterday. Yeah. Yeah, it was a 12th annual awards

01:45:07.340 --> 01:45:12.340
Yeah, well, yeah, but there were a lot of people there. Yeah, and a new group

01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:18.340
It's okay. It's okay. I've just got going down the facts. Here we go. Okay. Here we go. Okay. Okay, Dan was there

01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:23.500
We had an important meeting. He had an important meeting more important than channel 101. Yeah, okay. Here we go. Let's go

01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:26.580
Could have been very lucrative is very

01:45:27.220 --> 01:45:29.220
He's gonna make a lot of money. Oh

01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:36.260
My studio is I keep right right right. I know I know I know like channel 101 doesn't make you any money

01:45:36.260 --> 01:45:38.980
So you didn't go. All right. Here we go. Hey, what happened?

01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:40.980
It's

01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:47.980
Okay, all of this contributes to the great thing that happened last night it happens once a year at the end of the year where I

01:45:48.580 --> 01:45:52.500
Guess it's just sort of acknowledges the fact that this thing is there, but there were so many people there

01:45:53.100 --> 01:45:58.460
Who are friends of mine from the time I got to LA up until now were still my friends

01:45:58.460 --> 01:46:00.820
Which is insane and almost doesn't happen in the city

01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:02.980
and people who

01:46:02.980 --> 01:46:08.940
You know we should just sit around and eat Oreos and watch TV and now we actually do things in the fields that we came out here

01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:09.900
to pursue

01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:11.900
There were new people there

01:46:12.140 --> 01:46:18.100
Coming just to see there were people working as interns who had just heard about it and thought that this was a chance to get close

01:46:18.100 --> 01:46:23.020
To it and actually physically do something and and be around it. It's a great thing

01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:27.660
I think a lot most of the really good stuff that I've done since I've been in the city

01:46:28.380 --> 01:46:30.380
is connected to

01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:32.460
that

01:46:32.460 --> 01:46:36.420
place figurative or otherwise and the friends that I've made through it and

01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:40.340
So it's just a nice thing to be sitting in the back of that row and watching, you know

01:46:40.340 --> 01:46:43.180
I mean, I don't know whether I'll do much or anything with it this year

01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:46.300
but I'll do some things and

01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:50.420
And I'll but I will always have those friends those friends are always around and we'll always hang out and do

01:46:50.940 --> 01:46:56.700
Great stuff, and it was just watching people. It was run by a whole new group of people. It's really beautiful

01:46:57.340 --> 01:46:59.140
struggling

01:46:59.140 --> 01:47:03.780
Struggling to hold that thing together because they made the mistakes at each new group that comes in and the next year

01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:06.420
They got a better handle on it and another handle on it. It's just great to watch it

01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:09.940
It's I think it's fantastic, and I think you guys in that speech

01:47:14.580 --> 01:47:20.300
I mean, I know I'm walking into this trap, but we I pay for it

01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:29.900
Missed one Chinese I paid for it and one year of channel 101 screens

01:47:29.900 --> 01:47:31.900
I

01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:34.700
Thank you

01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:41.020
I haven't got a channel 101 in a year either, so I'm big of a dick

01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:48.820
So then you go to the Chinese cuz yeah, yeah out of guilt and I got so fucking stoned that I might as well have not been there

01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:55.060
I was like cackling throughout the entire thing people were just like

01:47:55.060 --> 01:47:58.620
Okay, so we'll just put this here, and then I'm like

01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:07.660
All right, we're just gonna put this here and sorry, man, we're having a stutter in the

01:48:09.900 --> 01:48:15.400
I was a mess. It was a mess. It's glad you didn't see me. I'm glad you weren't there Dan to see me

01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:17.660
So glad you weren't there cuz I'm

01:48:18.340 --> 01:48:22.100
I'm trying to I'm trying to keep the studio afloat and that

01:48:22.100 --> 01:48:28.540
It's as it expands more channel one to one people get to get have jobs as actual writers and directors and things

01:48:28.540 --> 01:48:31.340
This plate this thing has drawers. I've never noticed all right

01:48:34.180 --> 01:48:41.580
What have you found Jeff Davis his secret diary I found a piece of paper day one I think I'm gonna tell the cake story

I can't remember exactly what happened, but I know the chef thanked me for eating it

01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:55.980
It's a list just shared the 9-11 dream

01:49:01.420 --> 01:49:03.420

So I'm just like my I'm just like I'm just like

01:51:39.940 --> 01:51:42.100
You know, you're just Bubba from Forrest Gump

01:51:42.100 --> 01:51:44.100

01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:53.300
Yeah, mainly yeah, so I was you know, I think I'm still stoned from last night Mike Chilean gave me some fucking wicked weed, man

01:51:54.180 --> 01:51:58.060
It was all wicked. I had some tea. Oh, yeah, man. I was

01:51:58.060 --> 01:52:08.660
I was defying gravity, man. I was defying gravity, man. I was defying some gravity. It was so wicked

01:52:11.980 --> 01:52:13.980
It's a wicked reference I

01:52:15.220 --> 01:52:20.380
Was on ecstasy when I saw that shows I still don't know if it was good the the witches thing

01:52:20.380 --> 01:52:24.820
So they're flying ever seen that they defy gravity you made a reference to it

01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:29.700
I've heard some of that takes the Wizard of Oz and it turns you right on an ear

01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:35.740
It never needed to be turned on because that move that shows a fucking party about flying monkeys. He didn't like it

01:52:35.740 --> 01:52:40.020
I didn't yeah, where were you coming back and being I thought I did like it

01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:43.460
But it was also like fire hydrants my eyeballs are wiggling out of my head

01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:50.700
I didn't like wicked it wasn't up to my standards

01:52:50.700 --> 01:52:54.860
Hey, Dan, what'd you think of the movie? I didn't like it

01:52:55.380 --> 01:52:58.580
It wasn't up to my standards. I

01:52:59.580 --> 01:53:03.420
Wanted it to be better. I didn't like wicked

01:53:07.260 --> 01:53:14.020
Did you watch the whiz I didn't like the whiz I didn't watch the whiz was the whiz good

01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:16.020
I've never seen the whiz to mortgage

01:53:16.020 --> 01:53:26.860
Is that what happens in that movie well Diana Ross I

01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:31.620
Just watch seriously never seen the whiz have you seen the way that's great

01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:36.820
It's Michael Jackson. He's who's now no longer with us. Who's like a media?

01:53:36.820 --> 01:53:44.020
And Richard Pryor was he what was he he was the whiz. Oh, okay. He was the titillary

01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:48.940
This guy loves himself

01:53:50.140 --> 01:53:52.140
Trying out words

01:53:53.620 --> 01:53:55.860
There's nothing sadder than me trying to

01:53:57.100 --> 01:54:01.740
Down keep on down the bro. That's a good song. Doop. Doop. Yeah, it was very popular

01:54:01.740 --> 01:54:06.700
It's a good song down. Yeah, no note to self keep on down

01:54:06.700 --> 01:54:12.420
You know the song keep on down. You gotta keep on down keep on down the road, right?

01:54:12.540 --> 01:54:16.740
That's how it goes. Yeah, but the song is called ease on down, which is weird

01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:23.540
The title is different from the lyrics. Gotta keep on down that road. I'm gonna keep on down this

01:54:23.540 --> 01:54:31.260
Yellow brick road. I'm gonna keep on down it. I'm gonna keep on down it. Do you ever see return to us?

Return to Sesame Street now. I'm going to return to a place

01:54:58.020 --> 01:55:05.820
That many have not returned to a place where the whole point of the movie was getting away from right right

01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:14.260
My name is Walter Merch in return to us a clever shoe thief steals a pair of slippers that are the one way to

01:55:14.860 --> 01:55:16.860
Stay in Kansas

01:55:16.860 --> 01:55:22.060
Remember when the gnome king remember who's seen it who's seen it really the gnome keep goes

01:55:22.060 --> 01:55:24.060
Are you looking for the ruby slippers?

01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:30.500
And any and any pulls up his skirt, and he's wearing the ruby slippers, and he's like

01:55:32.620 --> 01:55:34.620
Are you looking for these?

01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:40.140
This is a cartoon right? No, he's a dude with makeup on and he's gonna

01:55:40.140 --> 01:55:45.060
I don't even know this is a return to us live-action film. I've never seen this

I'm looking for those ruby slippers and and he's like his feet are like this big how big

01:56:01.940 --> 01:56:03.940
bitches feet

01:56:07.540 --> 01:56:12.140
King that's like the ring I you remember in Lord of the Rings when they you see the ring get a little smaller

01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:16.220
I like I like stuff like that. I like when they explain when he threw it in the volcano

01:56:16.780 --> 01:56:19.820
We threw it in a volcano man. Hey Dan remember that

01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:23.260
He throws it in a volcano

01:56:23.300 --> 01:56:29.620
And then they cut back to the other the other hobbits that are like infighting and there it's all slow motion and they're crying

01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:35.900
Because the mountain exploded

01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:42.860
They're crying like really like that you watch 90 hours of that saga and really all it came down to is could someone have

01:56:42.860 --> 01:56:48.260
Just gone and talked to these green ghosts a lot earlier because they turned out to be the nuclear option

01:56:48.620 --> 01:56:55.740
It's just like the green ghost that that that that that trilogy should be called a journey to convince the green ghosts to help you

01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:59.780
Because once you do you're done. They were like

01:56:59.780 --> 01:57:05.420
Brear like like just going through there was just show the elephant monsters that were sober like

01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:13.660
Everyone was like green ghosts can't be stopped remember the second one where the B story was the two hobbits and the tree man

01:57:14.140 --> 01:57:15.980
walking

01:57:15.980 --> 01:57:18.380
Yeah, and the kid was how boring he was

01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:22.140
I will spend

01:57:22.660 --> 01:57:24.420
time

01:57:24.420 --> 01:57:26.420
get it

01:57:26.420 --> 01:57:29.980
Talking cuz trees are slow

01:57:30.900 --> 01:57:33.780
Not a good time to land this joke Jackson

01:57:37.900 --> 01:57:41.420
Moving pictures right ring a bell

01:57:42.860 --> 01:57:44.860
Dead alive

01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:52.500
Remember how you started yeah, I do punk rock, baby punk rock, baby. You moved faster than this dead alive, baby

01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:54.500
Dead alive

01:57:55.940 --> 01:58:03.060
The entire movie they're walking to the end of the movie in a tree man, and he's like yeah, well, you know

01:58:05.140 --> 01:58:07.300
And they're like then what happened

01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:14.380
They would have fixed that it would have been so famous

01:58:14.380 --> 01:58:21.500
We'd all be talking about Lord of the Rings it would be a household name

01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:24.540
If had only they done a few things

01:58:25.260 --> 01:58:27.260
Well, they're gonna reboot that shit

01:58:28.700 --> 01:58:33.500
When we gonna reboot Lord of the Rings man, let's get that shit started now

01:58:34.180 --> 01:58:40.860
They're actually Sony has the rights to Lord of the Rings for one year and three months and during that time

Hey, look at me. We're gonna find out

01:58:52.780 --> 01:58:55.280
Look at this look at this mountain

I think I'll I'll cut a hole in it and I'll make a whole house in there and then I'll

01:59:01.900 --> 01:59:04.300
Maybe I'll could put the bookshelf over here

01:59:05.540 --> 01:59:07.540
This will be the atrium

01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:09.540
Ah

02:01:03.780 --> 02:01:06.020
It wasn't a bit they always do that bit

02:01:12.620 --> 02:01:14.620
Well, then I'm handsome

02:01:16.380 --> 02:01:18.380
Let's go fishing next weekend

02:01:18.380 --> 02:01:25.860
That was a that's a new segment called lindelof's corner

02:01:28.380 --> 02:01:31.660
Where we where we prequelized some of your favorite

02:01:38.740 --> 02:01:42.540
Did you know that Sauron and Bilbo were made of the same black goo

02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:51.140
I know all right, but come on. We just have to because otherwise I know what you're thinking you're like like let's not do it

02:01:51.140 --> 02:01:53.540
Yeah, but I don't think you're going to do I think

02:01:54.100 --> 02:01:57.860
Dan Robbins, I think Schrabp's been filibustering the past 20 minutes

02:02:00.780 --> 02:02:06.660
I don't think we can force this doesn't want to do punish him play shadow run give us the recap

02:02:06.660 --> 02:02:14.780
Ah, let me read something off my phone did somebody else rule see this was exactly what I'm talking about

02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:24.140
It's not the demeanor of someone who wants to do this. Where's the music? There's no music. Can't play music. It's not possible

02:02:24.900 --> 02:02:28.020
I told you. Oh, you're great. I'll take 10 episodes

02:02:28.020 --> 02:02:38.460
All right, this one was written by Scott Brackett. Who's who's in the hospital visiting his grandpa. So I feel like shit

02:02:40.820 --> 02:02:44.900
Last week on Harmon run in an adorable attempt at detective work

02:02:44.900 --> 02:02:50.660
The team decided to head to a nano opium den after indulging in a little cyberware hate speech

02:02:50.660 --> 02:02:54.620
Dr. Friend managed to find his old Schlemau David McChina men

02:02:54.620 --> 02:02:59.220
They pulled up to a few cyber beanbags to engage in some light

02:02:59.740 --> 02:03:05.820
Conversation and non-consensual brain scanning, but McChina men didn't have the information they sought in the end

02:03:05.820 --> 02:03:07.820
He wasn't completely useless

02:03:07.820 --> 02:03:11.020
He was able to shed some light on the sinister meat market

02:03:11.020 --> 02:03:13.500
Which lures people with the promise of

02:03:13.860 --> 02:03:20.580
Companionship and cyber burgers only to snatch them away in a white van to sell their dismembered corpses for meat

02:03:20.580 --> 02:03:25.700
The shadow runners quickly hatched a plan to fight honeypot with honeypot

02:03:25.860 --> 02:03:32.820
They're currently hanging in an impressive week-long bad shadow runners freeze frame in the nano opium den

02:03:33.060 --> 02:03:41.660
Will they find gem our meat market and fresh to flesh linked is augmented reality good for anything besides digital

02:03:41.660 --> 02:03:45.380
Mists find out Harmon thing now times

02:03:45.380 --> 02:03:49.860
Shadow

02:03:52.740 --> 02:03:58.140
That was an important area. All right, let's see. Let's see. Let's do three minutes. Okay. All right guys

02:04:01.180 --> 02:04:04.940
Let's go let's go to the meat market. Yep

02:04:06.380 --> 02:04:10.500
How do we get there? Fuck this is why we're bad. Yeah

02:04:10.500 --> 02:04:15.300
For horticard Voldemort

02:04:17.780 --> 02:04:19.780
Oh

02:04:20.460 --> 02:04:25.220
Here in a nano opium den. Yeah, we're in a nano opium den. Oh, I'm so high

02:04:27.020 --> 02:04:29.020
All right, like nano technology

02:04:29.900 --> 02:04:32.580
Yeah, yeah, good. All right, so

02:04:33.220 --> 02:04:38.060
Let's leave. Let's let's go talk on the sidewalk. Let's get out of this nano. Yeah. Yeah, let's let's get serious

02:04:38.060 --> 02:04:44.060
All right, we I'm I go out into the sidewalk. All right, so bright man. I can't believe it's afternoon

02:04:48.340 --> 02:04:50.340
Is it afternoon sure

02:04:52.740 --> 02:04:55.580
All right, we were in there a lot longer than we should have been

02:04:56.500 --> 02:05:02.780
And I'm not I'm not I'm not a leadership type. I'm not all right. So I'll take charge

02:05:02.780 --> 02:05:12.660
You know what after being in that opium den I could use an orange slice I

02:05:14.860 --> 02:05:17.300
Think what we need is some vitamin C

02:05:20.980 --> 02:05:23.860
There's got to be an orange tree around here somewhere

02:05:24.740 --> 02:05:30.260
Is it is it is it at all possible that dr. Friend in his kit of wonders might have a supplement

02:05:30.260 --> 02:05:32.260
Oh

02:05:32.860 --> 02:05:39.140
Yeah, no you got all sorts of supplements vitamin supplements mineral supplements of the sea

02:05:39.620 --> 02:05:45.860
Variety is what we're looking for and is there enough for all one two three four of us

02:05:46.340 --> 02:05:48.340
All right, I'm gonna go over to a

Shadowrun types of

02:06:28.700 --> 02:06:34.260
Mission that we're on, you know demands that we get in close with the meat market industry

02:06:36.060 --> 02:06:37.740
Okay

02:06:37.740 --> 02:06:41.540

Sorry about that guy was getting a little bit too close for my liking

02:07:19.060 --> 02:07:21.860
Well, what's the big one? What's the one that's always on your radar?

02:07:21.860 --> 02:07:25.380
Well, what are you talking about like the McDonald's of meat markets?

02:07:25.380 --> 02:07:32.740
I don't know about that. Not how many people do it out here. It's all scattered gangs. All right, Phil. You're breaking up

02:07:32.740 --> 02:07:35.900
All right, I want to I don't know. It doesn't happen in the future

02:07:36.740 --> 02:07:40.060
All right. All right. All right the phone call click

02:07:40.060 --> 02:07:42.620
I want to call hack guy

Okay, you do that. All right. Hey hack guy. Do you know anyone on the inside in the meat markets?

02:07:49.660 --> 02:07:55.420
Or is there anyone do you do can you do some hacking and get in there and figure out?

02:07:55.940 --> 02:07:58.060
Where they're located in stuff?

02:08:00.540 --> 02:08:02.540
No

02:08:02.540 --> 02:08:10.420
I will I will I have a mafioso connection that I will reach out to

02:08:12.060 --> 02:08:16.460
Telephone call what's his name? Ritz is a Ritz Wilson. Ritz. Okay. Ritz

02:08:17.700 --> 02:08:22.540
So hello there Ritz. Hey, how's it going? It's going it has gone better

02:08:23.780 --> 02:08:28.580
Hopefully you can shed some light on something. I'm interested in a sort of they call it the meat market

02:08:28.580 --> 02:08:31.380
I'm wondering if you have

02:08:32.860 --> 02:08:36.140
Information to pass to your good friend like a butcher

02:08:36.900 --> 02:08:40.500
This is not that type of meat. Just just hang up. Just hang up

02:08:43.820 --> 02:08:47.220
We are looking for you know the sort of

02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:51.020
They're collecting people and

02:08:51.740 --> 02:08:57.540
Doing some testing and that sort of thing. Oh, yeah human testing lots of corporations do that shit, you know

02:08:57.540 --> 02:09:02.540
But these are the ones that tend to vanish periodically along with the people in them. Oh

02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:05.540
What?

02:09:05.540 --> 02:09:12.180
They vanish. I mean you vanish the people and then you cut them up and experiment on them. Well, okay, then there you go

02:09:12.180 --> 02:09:14.180
That's what I'm looking for

02:09:14.300 --> 02:09:19.380
Well those happen all over the place, you know, we got cyberware. There's all sorts of brain things

02:09:19.380 --> 02:09:25.940
There's magic. There's all sorts of things that need human test subjects, you know, it's pretty common around here

02:09:25.940 --> 02:09:27.940
We're specifically

02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:34.860
These sort of mutated people the ghoulish people. Hmm. You understand. I don't know anyone who's been looking from ghouls

02:09:34.860 --> 02:09:36.860
That's some fucked up shit, man

02:09:37.380 --> 02:09:43.420
Do you know what the the place would be where they would be drawn or where they would be taken from taken to from there

02:09:43.500 --> 02:09:50.060
If you're talking about ghouls, I mean, there's those clinics, right? They've been popping up popping down popping left and popping right

02:09:50.060 --> 02:09:56.260
No, the last one I heard of is called press F5 to Reflesh. It's it's a ghoul treatment

02:09:58.620 --> 02:10:00.620
Don't reward that

02:10:02.420 --> 02:10:08.540
It takes a technological approach to healing the ghoulish ghoulish nature of its patients

02:10:12.380 --> 02:10:14.380
That sounds good

02:10:14.380 --> 02:10:16.380
I

02:10:17.980 --> 02:10:22.460
Ask about the white bands you're saying like well, I'm not listening. Okay. Yeah

02:10:26.140 --> 02:10:31.980
White bands associated with this I don't know about no white bands, but if you're looking for ghouls

02:10:31.980 --> 02:10:38.780
That's where the ghouls show up. That's where I'd steal some flesh from so would you could you get me that information and location?

02:10:38.780 --> 02:10:46.380
Oh, yeah, I'll email it to you. Is that a round? Yes. Okay, you can data pulse it to me on any other

02:10:46.940 --> 02:10:51.460
I doubt I'm data pulsing it to you now received. All right

02:10:53.340 --> 02:10:57.700
Gentlemen, I have a great idea. We could dress up as ghouls and

02:10:58.780 --> 02:11:02.500
Infiltrate this place. I have a makeup kit

02:11:02.500 --> 02:11:07.500
I'll start

02:11:09.900 --> 02:11:12.740
Actually, it's not not a bad idea while he's doing that

02:11:13.620 --> 02:11:15.620
We should call an uber

02:11:15.900 --> 02:11:20.500
Well, I think I'm assuming if we're gonna do a good job of this isn't actually farcical

02:11:20.980 --> 02:11:22.980
It probably takes longer than an uber

02:11:22.980 --> 02:11:28.460
Oh, it's me. I'm a ghoul

02:11:32.820 --> 02:11:36.380
And if y'all want to be dressed up like me

02:11:42.780 --> 02:11:46.460
What what what strange

02:11:46.460 --> 02:11:53.620
cultural environment resulted in you thinking that ghouls are southern bells

02:11:56.100 --> 02:11:59.420
So I'd like to eat some brains right about now

02:12:03.300 --> 02:12:07.580
No, it's just me gentlemen. Oh, I do think that's a good idea

02:12:07.580 --> 02:12:12.060
I don't I don't think we should do the fans or the the ball gowns, but I

02:12:12.060 --> 02:12:17.900
But I do think the idea of looking ghoulish. All right. Well, here's my makeup kit. Please

02:12:18.700 --> 02:12:23.180
Use some of that start with the white primer and go

02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:28.500
Make sure you remember to use the beauty marks and plenty of rouge

02:12:31.300 --> 02:12:33.300
Three hours later

02:12:34.260 --> 02:12:37.500
All right, all right follow my lead

02:12:37.500 --> 02:12:41.260
Now we call the uber. Yeah

02:12:42.460 --> 02:12:44.620
It arrives post-haste

02:12:45.620 --> 02:12:47.620
Hello, are you Jamal?

02:12:49.260 --> 02:12:51.620
No, the uber self-drive now, it's

02:12:53.140 --> 02:12:55.140
Yeah

02:12:57.020 --> 02:13:01.340
Well, it's not like Pixar it doesn't have a name it's a car. All right. Yeah

02:13:02.540 --> 02:13:04.540
All right, we get in

02:13:04.540 --> 02:13:08.720
I'm gonna go to God call shotguns. All right

02:13:08.740 --> 02:13:14.940
So anybody ever see a ghoul behave? Oh, we did we fought him, right? So we just kind of we know that shuffle

02:13:14.940 --> 02:13:19.540
Yeah, all right. So when we get there, let's none of us do all the talking, right?

02:13:20.500 --> 02:13:22.500
Because we're ghouls, right

02:13:22.500 --> 02:13:30.980
You guys hear the vice presidents up to his old tricks again, huh?

02:13:35.060 --> 02:13:37.380
Are they taking the tunnel are we taking the tunnel?

02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:41.860
No, you haven't you haven't put in the destination

02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:46.740
See the tunnel so then horde guard

02:13:46.740 --> 02:13:55.780
Uses his link to send the destination information you do that the uber it drives the location

02:13:56.780 --> 02:13:58.780
It arrives. Oh

02:14:00.860 --> 02:14:02.860

It's it's almost 1020. Excuse me. I need to get out

02:14:09.140 --> 02:14:11.140
Why is he?

02:14:11.140 --> 02:14:19.860
I don't understand how he connected those

02:14:25.860 --> 02:14:28.580
Perhaps we should split up some of us would go in the back

02:14:30.820 --> 02:14:36.740
You you me and don't leave me with her I'll be going with you not blade

All right guys, well, I have a feeling nothing could go wrong. We're dressed as ghouls

02:14:44.980 --> 02:14:51.580
There's a puddle in front of me could somebody put their coat over it so I could step

02:14:52.300 --> 02:14:56.980
Over it don't want to get my petty coat all damp and y'all

Lays it over the puddle. Oh

Shadow run future. No, well now. No, no, no, but it's on life support. I would say
