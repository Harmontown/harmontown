{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:24.000\nOh yeah! Can you feel it? Oh baby! Let me hear it! Let me hear it baby! Give it up!\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:35.000\nLadies and gentlemen, boys and girls, Harmontown is now in session! I'm the controller tonight, Rob Schrab!\n\n00:35.000 --> 00:56.000\nOh boy! Lower your expectations! Let's bring out Spencer! Spencer Dungeon Mentor! Spencer! Alright, here we go!\n\n00:56.000 --> 01:12.000\nLadies and gentlemen, the man himself, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon! Alright! Alright! Alright Dan!\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:23.000\nAlright! Dan! Dan Harmon! That's a nice shirt you're wearing there tonight, Dan! Where'd you get a shirt like that?\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:31.000\nWhere does one get a shirt like that, Dan? Like if I wanted to click on your chest, what would pop up?\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:45.000\nWould Amazon pop up? Or would Tee Public pop up? Or would... The rapper? The rapper pop up? Where can I get a shirt like that?\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:55.000\nZen Monkey Studios, I think is the... Zen Monkey Studios! They've taken it upon themselves to be as prolific as the bootleggers.\n\n01:55.000 --> 02:05.000\nThat's the new t-shirt market. You gotta make a million t-shirts a week, so they're all very relevant. That's a long slogan!\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:22.000\nGuess Comptroller Rob Schrab is here with us tonight. I was in my pajamas, watching South Park reruns, nuggling with my dog and eating my cereal.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:26.000\nYou don't want to get those in the wrong order.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:41.000\nOh boy! Why? And then I texted you and I said, Jeff dropped out of the show, and so I replaced him with Ryan Ridley, who just dropped out of the show.\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:55.000\nAnd Bobcat Goldthwait cannot do it. Andy Kiddler's not writing back. And to make a long story short, would you do me the honor of guest comptrolling tonight?\n\n02:55.000 --> 03:01.000\nYes. And call you an Uber too.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:09.000\nWell you bail me out and oh well well you're up, why don't you press the button to call you an Uber and pick me up?\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:10.000\nYou asked...\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:16.000\nI said, hey, have you left yet? No, you want to pick me up?\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:19.000\nOh he's going to prove me wrong.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:24.000\nNo, no, no, I'm just looking at my oups here. There's not a lot of them.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:27.000\nHi Spencer, I haven't seen you in a while, Spencer.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:32.000\nHey man, yeah, I didn't go to the movie, watch movies with you that time you invited me, I feel bad.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:35.000\nYou mean my birthday party?\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:39.000\nOh no, I was thinking about a completely unrelated occasion.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:42.000\nYeah, that was another time you didn't write me back.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:48.000\nYeah, no. It happens a lot, I'm a bad person.\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:49.000\nHey Dan.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:59.000\nHello. Tonight was a rare sighting of the very, very unique, fleeting, evasive, full, panted Spencer.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:00.000\nI'm wearing pants.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:04.000\nSpencer, stand up and let's not look at your legs.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:06.000\nShow some lack of leg.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:14.000\nAre those at the bottom of the drawer?\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:16.000\nThat just looks like shorts though.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:17.000\nWhat's that?\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:23.000\nFor most angles, that would have just looked like shorts would, you know, above the knees and everything.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:31.000\nAlright, so, you know, the Ridley, I just wanted to make fun of him because he bailed like two hours before the show.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:34.000\nHow did that conversation go?\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:37.000\nHey man.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:41.000\nWell, I don't talk to anybody on the phone, but I'll talk, you know, it was...\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:44.000\nGuess what happened?\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:48.000\nThis is Ridley's professionalism.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:56.000\nI bothered to text him at 5.03 p.m. and said, you're going to come control tonight because I asked him on Friday before I left.\n\n04:56.000 --> 05:01.000\nOh, I wasn't doing anything Friday either.\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:03.000\nI mean, okay.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:08.000\nSo I just got back on Sunday at 5.03 p.m. and I said, you're going to come control tonight.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:11.000\nThat's called verification, that's not confirmation.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:16.000\nYou are confirming the thing.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:20.000\nAnd he texts back, I can't tonight.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:24.000\nAnd I text back, fuck!\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:27.000\nAnd then I started texting people like crazy.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:32.000\nAnd then at some point in there, he said, you don't have any other options?\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:34.000\nAnd I said, I'll figure something out.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:38.000\nIt's not an exciting, but then his response was, okay.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:41.000\nAll of that means that he's on another Tinder date.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:43.000\nThat's what that means.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:46.000\nHe swiped, right, or got swiped, right?\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:48.000\nI don't get it, man.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:54.000\nWell, the old fellas were in an Uber coming here, so it got us to talking about the Tenders.\n\n05:54.000 --> 06:01.000\nNeither of which we've ever used because I was married and you've been married a while now, probably pre-Tinder marriage.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:03.000\nPre-Tinder marriage?\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:07.000\nAnd definitely, we both have pre-Tinder bodies.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:11.000\nI mean, you're a fit guy, but I just mean we're fucking old.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:19.000\nI mean, Tinder, time to start a fire with Ralph from marketing.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:22.000\nNo, I want sash from Subway.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:27.000\nI'm horny, not naive.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:32.000\nI don't want someone to explain ISIS to me.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:36.000\nI want to come.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:42.000\nI can't explain ISIS to anybody.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:46.000\nOkay, so for real, and then Rob is saying, so it's just for fucking.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:49.000\nBut is it just for fucking or is it for...\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:51.000\nWell, I don't think it's for love.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:54.000\nI think it's for fucking.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:55.000\nIt's not for moving in.\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:57.000\nAnd it's not moving in there.\n\n06:57.000 --> 06:59.000\nNo.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:01.000\nOh wait, there's a lesbian joke on there somewhere, right?\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:03.000\nIsn't that the lesbian stereotype that they move in with each other?\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:12.000\nYou can write that joke backwards and make your lesbian friends feel sad and dehumanized.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:14.000\nWrite it backwards?\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:15.000\nYeah, it's cool.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:17.000\nNow that you know the punchline is moving in there.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:21.000\nSo you go like, hey, did you hear that there's a dating app for lesbians?\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:22.000\nIt's called moving in there.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:24.000\nI mean, I'm just saying, this is how comedy works.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:25.000\nIt's like blocks.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:27.000\nYou just go, pfft.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:28.000\nYou don't laugh.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:30.000\nYou just go, got milk.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:33.000\nIt's five o'clock.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:36.000\nMy children are hungry.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:39.000\nI don't have children.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:48.000\nMy man, I could like, needs a new pair of shoes.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:53.000\nAnyway, so is there maybe a millennial?\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:54.000\nWell, let's not be ages.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:58.000\nThere might be a 48-year-old person here that's like a Tinder expert.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nBut is that maybe we want to just come up with this?\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:01.000\nOh god, I would love to.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:02.000\nHello.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:03.000\nHello.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:05.000\nHe's got like a gorgeous, drawn Jeremy looking guy.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:06.000\nHe comes up with a marching name.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nThe I.B. of service.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:13.000\nMy name is Sebastian Fuxalot.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nSome George the K guy comes up.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:16.000\nOh my.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:17.000\nYeah.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:23.000\nIs there anybody that's been getting used out of Tinder one way or another?\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:24.000\nAll right.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:32.000\nWe've got, I think we have a familiar, a Harmontown person here in front of our family, a front\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:33.000\nrower.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:34.000\nLet's make this easy.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:35.000\nCome on up.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:36.000\nYay.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:37.000\nAll right.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:38.000\nAll right.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:46.000\nWell, this is a segment called, if you sit down here, then it's easy for the Carl's\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:48.000\nJr., whoever it is.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:53.000\nWhoever we work for now.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:54.000\nWell done.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:56.000\nBecause you're so thin, it was blocking you.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:57.000\nAw, damn.\n\n08:57.000 --> 08:59.000\nWhat a gentleman.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:02.000\nI objectified her.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:07.000\nOkay, so yeah, your name again?\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:08.000\nI'm Leah.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:09.000\nLeah.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:10.000\nOkay.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:11.000\nYou've been up here before, right?\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:13.000\nLike a year and a half ago or something like that.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:14.000\nTo the day.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:15.000\nYeah.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:16.000\nIt's on my calendar.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:17.000\nThere are little hearts on it.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:19.000\nSo this is actually my anniversary.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:22.000\nI played D&D at one point.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:23.000\nOkay.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:24.000\nSo tinder us.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:25.000\nLike the grandpa.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:31.000\nWalk us through a day in the life of the tinder person.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:32.000\nYeah.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:35.000\nI actually haven't been on it for a year, but I used to be.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:36.000\nOh, God.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:37.000\nI used to be on it like a lot.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:42.000\nI definitely, you know, I definitely got some mileage out of that web.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:43.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:44.000\nYou sure?\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:45.000\nCome down.\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:47.000\nWell, what does mileage mean?\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:49.000\nI mean, what did I try to do?\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:50.000\nMildage.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:54.000\nWhat is the typical, what is the typical tinder encounter?\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:56.000\nLike, like from soup to nuts.\n\n09:56.000 --> 10:01.000\nAnd I do mean, I mean, it's miles of dick.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.000\nWhat's the soup?\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:05.000\nIt's actual soup.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:09.000\nIf you're near a soup place.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:15.000\nWell, actually I'm looking for a new place to live right now because my housemate met\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:16.000\nher boyfriend on tinder.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:17.000\nAnd so he's moving in.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nSo it is for love.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:20.000\nSometimes it's for love.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:22.000\nWell, love finds a way.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:23.000\nYeah.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:26.000\nYou always try to hit it and quit it.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:28.000\nFire at close range, you think.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:30.000\nBut then you fall in love because it's like.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:32.000\nThat frog DNA in there.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:35.000\nAnd then I'll, you know, nature.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nThen you start laying in your eggs.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:38.000\nWait, man.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:41.000\nThen you're next to, you know, you're out of the paddock and you're at site B.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:42.000\nT-Rex is after you.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:46.000\nYou gotta go, must go faster, man.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:48.000\nGotta get out of there.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:50.000\nIt doesn't matter who throws a road flare.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:51.000\nYou're visual acutely.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:52.000\nShe is.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:53.000\nIs it based on light?\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:54.000\nIt's based on motion.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:55.000\nRight.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:56.000\nYeah.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:58.000\nGotta eat that toilet lawyer and fucking.\n\n10:58.000 --> 10:59.000\nWelcome back.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.000\nYou know what I'm talking about?\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:05.000\nTalking about family.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:09.000\nObjects are closer than they are.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:11.000\nIn an ironic sense.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:12.000\nYeah, man.\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:13.000\nYeah, man.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:17.000\nJust gotta fucking make that girl clever.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:18.000\nShit.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:19.000\nUh, yeah.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:23.000\nYou gotta, gotta get in that plastic hamster ball and just slide.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:29.000\nYou gotta, gotta have that dream sequence where the raptor's talking at you.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:32.000\nWait, is that one from the Clone Wars?\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:33.000\nThat's the third one.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:34.000\nThird one.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:35.000\nOh, okay.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:36.000\nWe saw that in the theater.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:37.000\nOh, that's, yeah.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:38.000\nThen they say like, hey, Kevin, get over here.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:39.000\nOkay.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:40.000\nHey, hey, hey.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:41.000\nAll right, Leah.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:42.000\nSo, so.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:45.000\nHey, I'm a raptor and I'm eating cream and I'm talking to you.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.000\nIt's like that.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:53.000\nIt's just like Sam Neal's like, and then the raptor goes, hey, can I have some peanuts?\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:57.000\nAnd it's, somebody went, that's terrifying.\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nAll right.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nSo back to Tinder.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:02.000\nAll right.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:06.000\nSo, so you, so, so you have your phone.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:11.000\nYou're, where are you typically surfing your Tinder?\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:16.000\nI used to do it with my housemate too and I've also done it with Paul, Paul the whip guy.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:17.000\nYeah.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:21.000\nLike, well, like, so sometimes it's drunk tindering, which is kind of more fun because\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nthen it's just like a big fun judging game with your body.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:27.000\nIs there a limit on that like, like, like, like, like on those music sharing things where\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:31.000\nthey don't want you to be able to do next too many times because then that's like not having\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:32.000\nto buy music.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:36.000\nSo like, look, you got to marry one of these guys or I'll see you tomorrow.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:37.000\nI know what you're doing.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:39.000\nYou're judging us.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:42.000\nAnd unless it changed, I don't think so.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:46.000\nBut once in a while it'll run out of people, which is a really sad moment where they're\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:48.000\nlike, there's no one else in your area for you.\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:49.000\nYeah.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:52.000\nYou insatiable sardlock pit.\n\n12:52.000 --> 13:00.000\nYou bottomless, gaping, gaping.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:02.000\nSex monster.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:03.000\nOh my gosh.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:07.000\nThe, the, what was, okay, but so, okay, so then you're swiping, sometimes you're doing\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:09.000\nit for onesies, like hate, hate swiping.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:10.000\nYeah.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:15.000\nAnd then, and then, and then, but then sometimes you're doing it for onesies.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:16.000\nFor onesies.\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:18.000\nAnd you're, and you're, and you're swiping.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:19.000\nYeah.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:20.000\nYeah.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:22.000\nWell, it's always pretty sincere even if you're doing it with the body, like the objective\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:23.000\nis always to get a date.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nDoing it was a buddy.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:26.000\nLike what are you doing?\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\nLike you're sitting on the couch.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:31.000\nAnd you're looking at people together and you're like, I don't like him.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:32.000\nI can't say his name.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:33.000\nFuck that guy.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:34.000\nYou know.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:35.000\nRight.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:40.000\nThat's better than a compliment.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:45.000\nReally, any minority?\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:51.000\nSo, so, so, so, but sometimes, so, so, like, you swipe.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:52.000\nOkay.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:58.000\nBut then you see, you see a gentleman, not to presume, but like, like, you see a couple\n\n13:58.000 --> 13:59.000\napart.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:00.000\nA couple.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:01.000\nI've swiped a couple before.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:02.000\nYou see a person.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:05.000\nYeah, you see a human meat, a meat thing.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:06.000\nYeah.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:09.000\nAnd you, and you go, like it.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:12.000\nAnd then you, and then so then is that person getting there?\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:13.000\nAre you texting them?\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:14.000\nWas it going to a chat thing?\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:15.000\nYeah.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:18.000\nIf you both, you can swipe left, which means you're not interested.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:20.000\nSwipe right means that you are interested.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:23.000\nAnd if you both swipe right to each other, then you're sent to a chat.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nSo then you can chat with each other.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nWhat if you don't want to?\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:28.000\nMost of the time you don't.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:31.000\nAnd that's always almost like a weird sad thing because you'll match with someone and\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:32.000\nit'll tell you it's a match.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:33.000\nAnd then they're like, do you want to keep playing?\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:34.000\nOr do you want to talk to this person?\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:36.000\nYou're like, I want to keep playing.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:37.000\nLike,\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:39.000\nKeep playing like, like looking further or keep like,\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nIt becomes an addiction after a while.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:44.000\nIt's just like anything else where you're just like, I just like to swipe things.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:45.000\nYou know,\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:49.000\nSo can you explain so, so, but the people that you're swiping are they, they're also,\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nthey're all the people that are actively swiping.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:55.000\nSo there's no chance that you're swiping somebody who's like taking a map, like,\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:58.000\nlike everyone who's swiping is swiping each other.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:00.000\nIt's no, you don't have to be online right.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:03.000\nLike it's anybody that's active on Tinder.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:07.000\nAnd it's based on like what age range you said you're looking for and like the distance\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:09.000\nthat you're interested in driving.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:11.000\nAnd since it's LA, it's like nothing.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:12.000\nOkay.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:13.000\nAnd so it's the average thing.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nMaybe we should just skip all the way ahead too.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:17.000\nIf you don't mind us asking this question.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:18.000\nYeah.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:27.000\nLike how many out of all the times that you, I'm listening, how many, how many, I mean,\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:30.000\nhow, how many times is this just hooking up?\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:35.000\nHow many times is it just like a one night, one day stand?\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nA lot, a significant amount.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:41.000\nBut then also I dated a guy dated strong word.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:46.000\nI was interacting with a man for 14 months that I met on Tinder.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:47.000\nYeah.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:51.000\nBut is it a lot of one or a few time interactions?\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:59.000\nI get the impression that the people that are most of the people that are using it, are they, is it, is it, is it like dating?\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:07.000\nLike, just like everything else where it's like, well, yeah, I want to fuck probably eventually maybe even really fast.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:12.000\nBut I'm also not like, is it just like a gas station bathroom?\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:16.000\nWell, that's a glory hole.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:20.000\nIs it like E24 for pussy?\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:27.000\nAre you in the mood for Chinese?\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:33.000\nI actually know three couples that are like serious couples from Tinder.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:34.000\nThat's good odds.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:35.000\nYeah.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:41.000\nI mean, isn't it about fucking having sex and then people are like, oh, having sex is so great.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:42.000\nLet's date.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:45.000\nAnd then, you know, sometimes relationships happen.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:50.000\nNo, what happened was, okay, Tinder is based on the app Grinder, which is for the gay community.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:51.000\nAnd so that's just for fucking.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:54.000\nLike, so that's why originally it was like, oh, you're hot.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:55.000\nI'm hot.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:56.000\nDo you want to bang?\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:57.000\nLet's go over there.\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nThere's a bathroom in between our houses.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:03.000\nAnd then the houses, there's two houses involved.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nIt's more adventurous to get a bathroom.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nThere's bathrooms in both of those houses.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:08.000\nYeah.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:09.000\nSometimes multiple bathrooms.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:10.000\nThis is West Hollywood.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:15.000\nThere's a house and there's a house, but then there's in between each of the houses.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:19.000\nThere's a special gay bathroom.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:20.000\nJust for neighbors.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:21.000\nGot it.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:22.000\nGot it.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:23.000\nRight.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:28.000\nSo it's based on Grinder, but then now it's Tinder.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:30.000\nAnd so now guys have to deal with women.\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:34.000\nSo I mean, if guys had their way, I'm sure it's still just be like, do you want to meet\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:37.000\nthem between our houses at the secret heterosexual bathhouse?\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:42.000\nBut then women are like, no, I want you to buy me dinner and like, you know, learn my\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:43.000\nname.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:44.000\nAnd they're like, God damn it.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:46.000\nAnd so that's what Tinder is.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:51.000\nIt's like a meeting of the sexes where the men, I'm sure, you know, but then one of my\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:55.000\nguy friends said that he had an account and he tried different things.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:59.000\nAnd so when he was saying like, maybe I want a girlfriend, he was only getting like some\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:00.000\npeople.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:02.000\nAnd eventually he changed it where he's like, I'm trying to bang.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:04.000\nAnd then he'd say, you have girls hitting them up all the time.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nSo he was like, girls are just as nasty as the guys, man.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:09.000\nSo it's all just what you're looking for.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nIs that what you sound?\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:12.000\nOh, go ahead.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:17.000\nNo, it's too like.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:20.000\nI mean, just as many girls are nasty as guys.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:21.000\nYeah, for sure.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:26.000\nAnd so apps probably, obviously it is a good thing because people are, you're using it.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:28.000\nSo that's the definition of being good, right?\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:35.000\nThere's nobody's getting hurt more than when they use Uber.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:44.000\nSo like it is because I find, you know, that like when you're talking about sex with people,\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:48.000\nit's like you can never, you can never tell, but it's like we all kind of like we have these\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:52.000\nlike sort of, I don't know, like we're always worried about everybody else like like like\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:53.000\nworrying about us.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:58.000\nAnd so it's hard to, you know, that's what that that's what that guy found out that that\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:03.000\nKenzie, Ken, Ken, Ken, Kenzie guy, like it's like people, everybody's like fucked up.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:05.000\nEverybody's like a crazy sexual snowflake.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:11.000\nAnd then the big thing that most people share is that they'd love to talk about it with\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:15.000\nsomebody and love to like indulge lots of it and do all kinds of weird things.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:19.000\nBut then we have this whole other part that's like, well, I'm not actively coming right\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:22.000\nnow, so I need to like not be afraid of people.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:29.000\nAnd I need to like not, I need to be respected and allowed to be a senator.\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:34.000\nYeah, so I don't know what my point is, a bunch of a bunch of really obvious shit is my point.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:39.000\nOn Tinder, is there like, is it like you have profiles and this is what I like and this is\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:41.000\nwhat, do you have it on your phone?\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:42.000\nYeah, it's on your phone.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:45.000\nCan you look up Ridley's profile?\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:47.000\nIs it possible to search for people?\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:48.000\nNo.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:49.000\nIt's not like Instagram.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:54.000\nBecause apparently we could set up a profile right now and put Ridley's thing in the age range\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:56.000\nand you probably come up eventually.\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:59.000\nI think Ridley might be 53, I don't know.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:00.000\nI can't tell.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:04.000\nWell, it's apparently, Rob said he's tearing up, he's tearing up Los Angeles.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:05.000\nHe's tearing up Los Angeles.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:11.000\nLike it's like Paul Bunyan's plow is making lakes using Tinder.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:16.000\nAnd so this is, that text conversation was very unapologetic and very, very curt.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:18.000\nI think he got swiped.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:20.000\nGod knows I did.\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:23.000\nSide-swiped.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:38.000\nMy friendship loyalty, Hyundai got, the rearview mirror got clipped by his fucking weird dick Ferrari.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:43.000\nAll right, well let's thank Leo for explaining some of Tinder to me.\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:47.000\nI know you guys didn't need to understand it.\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:54.000\nI like getting, I like being older than people.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:59.000\nEspecially women.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:03.000\nWho wants to be younger than them?\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:11.000\nYou guys, I'm sorry, that was funny, but I understand, I understand it.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:17.000\nWe have a new, I don't know, all right, let's clean up.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:22.000\nJesus Christ, let's fucking, Leah came over and the place is a goddamn mess.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:26.000\nShe, she, she leaves her cheeto bull bulls all over the place.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:29.000\nI was just swiping and fucking and that's all she cares about.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:33.000\nShe doesn't, she doesn't put anything back where she found it.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:35.000\nExcept, you know.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nStop it.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:40.000\nDon't go in, don't finish that sentence.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nPlease don't finish that sentence.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nShe puts debt back where she found it.\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:47.000\nOkay, you finished, you finished the sentence.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:51.000\nWhen I just specifically asked you to not finish the sentence and you finished the sentence.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:53.000\nI wasn't sure you knew what I was going to say.\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:55.000\nI knew what you were going to say.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:57.000\nThat's why I said don't finish that sentence and you finished it.\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:58.000\nYou finished it.\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:00.000\nYou finished the sentence.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:05.000\nYou, you're a finisher.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:09.000\nAll right, piece of shit.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:10.000\nYou're not a piece of shit.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:11.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:12.000\nI went, I went too far.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:13.000\nYou're a good guy.\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:15.000\nI'm glad I'm here.\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:16.000\nAll right.\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:17.000\nAll right.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:21.000\nThank you for swiping tonight's conversation about that.\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:25.000\nAnd now we're going to have a slightly more serious, more dramatic one.\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:34.000\nBut it's also about, it's also about, it's about connections with strangers that are possible through technology.\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:35.000\nLet's put it that way.\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:36.000\nOkay.\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:37.000\nLet's do that.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:42.000\nI'll just unceremoniously bring him out because he's not really, he's not an entertainer.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:43.000\nHe's just a new friend.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:45.000\nI met him, I met him at a, at a bar.\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:46.000\nWhich bar?\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:49.000\nI met him at the drawing room, which is where everybody goes after the show usually.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:50.000\nThat's true.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:58.000\nI was there on a, probably a Tuesday morning and, and, and started, started small talking\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:01.000\nand then found out that this guy's got a pretty interesting story.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:04.000\nI was like, would you please come on my show and let's talk about it.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:05.000\nIs he back there?\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:08.000\nIs he, is he, is he ready?\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:09.000\nNo one's listening.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:10.000\nOh, okay.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:13.000\nLet's put, let's, let's, let's welcome our new friend Kyle.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:14.000\nKyle!\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:21.000\nIt's sitting that one.\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:23.000\nThanks for, thanks for coming.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:25.000\nGive it up for Kyle.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:26.000\nKyle.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:27.000\nI don't do this.\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:29.000\nDamn met him at a bar.\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:30.000\nKyle.\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:31.000\nHow's it going?\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:32.000\nYeah, good, good.\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:35.000\nThanks for, thanks for coming out here and telling us your story.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:39.000\nIt's, it's pretty, it's pretty personal, but it's also like a weird, like, like, like,\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:41.000\nkind of TV movie shit.\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:47.000\nSo I, I, I, I pressed him to come on the show.\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:52.000\nSo, so, I mean, the, the, the, the, probably separates you from almost everyone in this\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:55.000\nroom, although it would be fun if there was one guy that was like, wait, me too.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:56.000\nThat would be pretty cool actually.\n\n23:56.000 --> 24:01.000\nIs that you currently have the, the beating heart of a complete stranger in your chest.\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:02.000\nI do.\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:05.000\nHaving, having, having gotten a heart transplant.\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:06.000\nHow many years ago?\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:08.000\nActually today is my anniversary.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:09.000\n11 years.\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:10.000\n11 years.\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:11.000\nWhoa.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:12.000\nWith the service party.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:14.000\nToday was the day I got it.\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:15.000\nWow.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:16.000\nHow old are you right now?\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:17.000\nWhat's that?\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:18.000\nHow old are you right now?\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:19.000\n31.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:20.000\n31.\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:21.000\nYeah.\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:22.000\nWhen I got it.\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:23.000\nYeah.\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:24.000\nCause you're, so let's start there.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:28.000\nThe reason why you needed a heart transplant is not because you were eating too many french fries.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:29.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:31.000\nIt was not.\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:35.000\nI was born with a disease called not disease.\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:36.000\nSorry.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\nThat's not right to say a transposition of the great vessels.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:42.000\nSo your heart is backwards and your blood flows backwards.\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:46.000\nAnd so you, so you, uh, you, you loved the rain and hated children.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:47.000\nI did.\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:48.000\nYeah.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:50.000\nIt was like, I was like, I can't do this.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:52.000\nI just, you know, you people get away from me.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:53.000\nYou would take Christmas presents.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:54.000\nYou were the Grinch.\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:55.000\nI was a Grinch.\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:58.000\nI was like studying at a household time.\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:00.000\nLike bubble, you know, in a bubble.\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:01.000\nYeah.\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:02.000\nSo you had this.\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:04.000\nSo, so what, what, what, what, what is the nature of that?\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:07.000\nLike we've got our friend, our friend, C could comes on sometimes and he's like, he's\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:10.000\nbeen multiple aneurysms and they can't figure out what, why that is.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:16.000\nBut, but his, his prognosis is basically that he has to like, like, like just be satisfied\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:20.000\nwith the fact that at any minute, like something terrible could just happen in his brain.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:22.000\nI mean, I'm still a little bit there.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:24.000\nBut you were certainly there before the transplant.\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:25.000\nThat was real bad.\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:27.000\nYou were just like, what did the doctors tell you before the transplant?\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:29.000\nLike what was your, what were your, what was your prognosis?\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:30.000\nIs that the word?\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:31.000\nI was in heart failure.\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:32.000\nSo my heart was dying.\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:35.000\nThey did all they could do to fix it.\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:41.000\nAfter I had a five pacemakers and after the fifth one didn't work.\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:45.000\nSo they were just, that was me going on a list.\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:46.000\nYeah.\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:51.000\nSo the doctors were pretty much like your only option is someone else's heart.\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:53.000\nSo that described to us.\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:58.000\nAnd you always hear, I'm going, I don't know, heart transplant is a concept from the, from\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:01.000\nfrom the news is like what I've never been able to ask somebody.\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:03.000\nIt's like, so what, what is it?\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:06.000\nYou're not sitting in a hospital waiting because it took how long?\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:07.000\nYeah.\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:12.000\nSo basically after I graduated high school, my heart was a, I was in failure.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:15.000\nAnd then my doctor, funny enough, she was hilarious.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:16.000\nYeah.\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:20.000\nShe's like, yeah, I don't trust any doctors in Washington to help you out right now.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:24.000\nSo you should go to Stanford and they will give you a better heart.\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:28.000\nAnd so I went there, you go on a list, you get the process going.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:31.000\nBut they, they try to mend it as much as they can though.\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:35.000\nThey try to, try to, or they try to mend the, like they try to fix it as much as they can.\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:39.000\nSo that's like another pacemaker, maybe something they need to like fix the heart valve, but\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:41.000\nI didn't need any of that.\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:43.000\nIt was just more pacemaker stuff.\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nSo it was just kind of that whole.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:51.000\nSo then the, the moment when a donor becomes available and it's like, it's go time, which\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:54.000\nit must be a huge like rush and emergency.\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:56.000\nLike you're not sitting in a hospital.\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:58.000\nYou're hanging out.\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:00.000\nI'm hanging out at home.\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:01.000\nI was at home with my sister.\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:08.000\nShe moved to help me out and my mom and got the call around dinner time, I guess, five\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:09.000\no'clock.\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:12.000\nDo you remember what you were doing, the moment that the phone rang?\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:15.000\nIt was cooking dinner.\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:16.000\nI liked to cook.\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:18.000\nThat's what I do nowadays and I work in the world.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:19.000\nWhat were you making?\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:20.000\nWhat was I making?\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:21.000\nSomething without salt.\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:22.000\nFrench fries?\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:23.000\nYeah.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:24.000\nYeah.\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:25.000\nSomething real high.\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:27.000\nLike I'm just going to do this or not.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:28.000\nNo.\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:29.000\nSomething low salt.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:33.000\nSomething like I can't, my dietary restrictions were pretty minimal.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:39.000\nBut yeah, I was with my sister and I got the call and you never meet your transplant\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:40.000\ndoctor ever.\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:43.000\nIt's not, they just do the surgeries.\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:48.000\nI have another doctor that helped me out and the doctor that called me is a fellow.\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:49.000\nRight.\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:50.000\nSo they, yeah.\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:54.000\nSo when I get to that doctor thing or one second, just to get the picture, like, is\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:56.000\nthis a cell phone time or was this pre-cell phone?\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:59.000\nYeah, I think I had that like Nokia brick, you know.\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:00.000\nI miss that thing too.\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:01.000\nThose were great.\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:02.000\nThose were durable.\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:03.000\nIt's a voice call.\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:04.000\nIt's a voice call.\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:07.000\nThey call this guy on the other line.\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:14.000\nAnd he just, his first words were you, Kyle, let's send you some, Kyle.\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:17.000\nAnd he just said, are you, how are you feeling today?\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:18.000\nI thought it was pretty creepy.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:20.000\nSo yeah, I just go in and say that.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:23.000\nAnd I was like, you know, my body's pretty good actually.\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:25.000\nI'm pretty good.\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:29.000\nBut he said, are you feeling ready to get a transplant?\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:31.000\nAnd I, yeah, that was it.\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:38.000\nHe didn't do anything clever like, like, hey, can I get you anything?\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:40.000\nLike human heart.\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:47.000\nHe's like, so I got this box or what's in the box.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:48.000\nOkay.\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:50.000\nSo, so then you're like, holy shit, this is it.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:51.000\nYeah.\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:53.000\nHow much fear is there versus how much like relief?\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:55.000\nBecause I mean, I imagine the life is already fear.\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:56.000\nIt was all fear.\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:57.000\nOh, really?\n\n28:57.000 --> 29:01.000\nSo you're not like, oh my God, this is better than nothing.\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:02.000\nTherefore it's all good.\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:07.000\nThe chances were still like eight percent good, 20 percent.\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:10.000\nThat sounds so terrifying to me.\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:17.000\nLike I'm getting anxiety just thinking about it because they have to break open your rib cage.\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:18.000\nYes.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:23.000\nAnd take your old heart out, put it on a plate.\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:24.000\nAll right.\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:25.000\nGrab zombie.\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:27.000\nAnd then get a new one.\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:29.000\nAnd like, but you're going to.\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:31.000\nI'm going to kill my brain open too for fun.\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:38.000\nBut seriously, they're taking your heart out of your body and connecting your, your, for\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:44.000\nI don't know if you know the details of it, but how long, I mean, like how long is your\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:46.000\nbody without a heart?\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:52.000\nWell, at the time though, when it happened, I mean, when I got to call it, that would have,\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:55.000\nwould have, would be my fourth open heart surgery.\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:58.000\nSo at the time I didn't have a sternum.\n\n29:58.000 --> 29:59.000\nSo they had replete.\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:00.000\nThey just stopped.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:01.000\nThey put just for zippers in.\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:04.000\nThey just kind of like zip it up, throw some cartilage back in there.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:05.000\nAnd they're like, you're good.\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:07.000\nThey're like, we're coming back in here.\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:10.000\nI don't want to, I don't want to be cynical, but I also don't want to keep stabbing you.\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:12.000\nYou got to get a phone with it.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:15.000\nSo it's like, don't look down, Kyle.\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:17.000\nBut at this time you'll thank me later.\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:20.000\nIt's mainly tape.\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:23.000\nWait, what do you have instead of a sternum?\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:25.000\nWell, I don't really know.\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:27.000\nIs there nothing there?\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:28.000\nYeah.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:29.000\nI mean, as I'm touching myself.\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:30.000\nYeah.\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:31.000\nYeah.\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:33.000\nYou know, just like, there's a little bit of a sternum there at the top.\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:34.000\nYeah.\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:35.000\nHoly shit.\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:36.000\nSo what is it?\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:40.000\nSo you're a serious danger that if you were to ever like take a car door to the, to the\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:42.000\nchest, like you actually get really fucked up.\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:46.000\nCar door would mess me up or nice punch or you know, Jesus.\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:47.000\nAll right.\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:48.000\nSo, so then you go.\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:50.000\nFollow me story for everybody here.\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:53.000\nWell, they've been through so much.\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:54.000\nAll right.\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:55.000\nGood sweet.\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:56.000\nI don't know.\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:58.000\nDid you see the Aubrey Plaza episode?\n\n30:58.000 --> 30:59.000\nIt was.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:00.000\nI listened to it.\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:01.000\nActually, I listened to it.\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:02.000\nI'm kidding.\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:04.000\nI did that for the laugh.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:06.000\nI really enjoyed her.\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:08.000\nShe's, she's really cool.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:09.000\nShe's an awesome person.\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:14.000\nAnd I go, that was for a cheap, cheap laugh because my, my interview was bad and it was\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:19.000\na very talented person and you're talking shit about her.\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:22.000\nI went for a very, very cheap, very terrible laugh.\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:23.000\nYeah.\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:25.000\nIt was pretty shitty of you.\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:26.000\nIt's a good person.\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:27.000\nIt's not going to be shitty.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:28.000\nNever did anything.\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:30.000\nNever said anything bad about you.\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:31.000\nIt could have been anybody but her too.\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:33.000\nIt would have been funny and also harmless too.\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:38.000\nCause I feel like, yeah, I could have picked anybody.\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:39.000\nSo, so yeah.\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:40.000\nWell, it is interesting about it.\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:43.000\nLike, like, like we won't have to spend the rest of the time on the actual operation\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:47.000\nbecause there's a meeting with the goddess in this Campbell's journey and then there's\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:54.000\nan atonement with some shit.\n\n31:54.000 --> 32:00.000\nBut there on the table, that is a really important if child is questioned like, how\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:06.000\nin the hell this thing is like, it's a, it's the motor that keeps your body from dying\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:08.000\nand then they're taking it out.\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:09.000\nWhat is it?\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:10.000\nLike they, what do they do?\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:11.000\nDo they put the.\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:17.000\nSo you're on a, so my heart was, it was, I was actually, you know, when I got the,\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:20.000\nwhen I got the call for it, I was actually crashing a little bit.\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:23.000\nSo my heart was kind of, it was a lot more heart failure.\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:26.000\nThere, I think it was borderline being hospitalized a little time.\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:32.000\nSo, so what I got the call and you go in there and my heart was just, I was, you know, as\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:34.000\nnervous as you can be, you know, just what's going on.\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:40.000\nYada, you know, did some calls that I had to make to family, like goodbye or whatever.\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:51.000\nAnd I, they could not sedate me because I actually, first off, the, when I got the call, the,\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:59.000\nthe, I had to spend the night in the hospital because the donor's family wasn't like ready\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:03.000\nto, you know, let go of the, let go of the body.\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:04.000\nSo, yeah.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:07.000\nSo that was an interesting thing to sit there and kind of wait for that.\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:08.000\nSo it's.\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:09.000\nInteresting.\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:10.000\nYeah.\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:13.000\nHe'll fuck with your head a little bit in life and make you realize life a little bit\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:14.000\nmore.\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:15.000\nYou're like, oh.\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:16.000\nYou're in a hospital.\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:21.000\nYou're going to drop by the doorway and go, listen, I know I'm not entitled to anything.\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:22.000\nYeah.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:23.000\nI've got blue.\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:24.000\nI've got blue cross.\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:25.000\nI've got blue cross.\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:26.000\nIt's all right.\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:33.000\nSo, but, but, but just physically, I'm just saying, like, like.\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:34.000\nGo into a room.\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:36.000\nThey, I mean, you go in the surgery room.\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:39.000\nThere's a machine that pretty much looks like a real to real.\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:46.000\nAnd it just, you know, after they get the ports into your valves, it's basically redirecting\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:52.000\nyour blood out of your body into a re, or like a real to real to oxygenated oxygen.\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:53.000\nGive it oxygen.\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:54.000\nAnd then it.\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:56.000\nAnd then, yeah.\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:57.000\nSo there's a machine.\n\n33:57.000 --> 34:01.000\nThere's a machine on the outside that like keeps you from dying while they disconnect your\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:02.000\nheart.\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:06.000\nAnd then they put the Indiana Jones, the bag of sand in there.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:07.000\nYeah.\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:08.000\nPretty much.\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:11.000\nSo that your body doesn't shoot the arrows.\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:12.000\nMakes sense.\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:16.000\nAnd they, and they, you know, there's probably, they're going to adjust the amount of sand\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:18.000\ndepending on the heart.\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:19.000\nThe, okay.\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:20.000\nWell, so, yeah.\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:22.000\nAnd we can, I'll, I'll Google the rest of that.\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:23.000\nI'm so interested.\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:26.000\nBecause there's things that only you can tell us about.\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:28.000\nIt's like your personal story.\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:29.000\nGotta Google it.\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:31.000\nGotta Google that information.\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:36.000\nThe, the, so then they zip you back up.\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:40.000\nThere's obviously all this terror now that you have this thing, because it's like, oh,\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:42.000\nthere's this percentage of chances.\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:44.000\nIt's just, it's not going to work.\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:45.000\nYeah, rejection.\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:52.000\nAnd, and see how the Tinder thing already thematic, fear of rejection, the swiping, the cell\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:53.000\nphone.\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:55.000\nCome on.\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:56.000\nIt's impressive.\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:57.000\nI didn't.\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:58.000\nIt's so impressive.\n\n34:58.000 --> 35:00.000\nI didn't even plan it.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:05.000\nAnd I forced the connection, you know, improvisationally and apparently offended you.\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:07.000\nI don't know.\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:10.000\nThe, the, the, so you're zipped up and you're done.\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:11.000\nYou're recovered.\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:12.000\nYeah.\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:17.000\nAnd so then here comes the, even the thing that definitely separates you from everyone\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:18.000\nin the room.\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:20.000\nEven if someone in here did have a heart transplant.\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:25.000\nBecause then this thing that's not supposed to happen happens, which is that the family.\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:31.000\nYeah, I don't know who weren't, you're never allowed to know who the donor is.\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:32.000\nThey are.\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:38.000\nAnd the family somehow, I mean, the details, I don't know how they figured it out, but\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:44.000\nthe deals are really, they, they were searching a little harder for, I don't know, they were\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:46.000\nkind of doing their own investigation.\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:52.000\nThey found my brother's website as a painter and he wrote something in the bio of like,\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:56.000\nmy brother with transplant, yada, yada, and they just matched up like San Francisco area,\n\n35:56.000 --> 36:01.000\nyada, yada, and they ended up finding it out and contacting my mom.\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:02.000\nAnd yeah.\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:07.000\nSo the family of the guy whose heart's in your chest tracks you down.\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:10.000\nAnd so did you, and then did you hang out with them?\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:16.000\nTo be quite honest, I have never written anything to them or seen them.\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:19.000\nMy mom has, she's talked to them.\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:22.000\nI don't know, maybe somebody should do.\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:23.000\nOh, I didn't know.\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:25.000\nIt's kind of a little hard.\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:26.000\nWhat did they want?\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:29.000\nIf they're talking, they, they went to talk to your family.\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:32.000\nWhat were they trying to do in that?\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:36.000\nThey, they just want to see where, you know, just wanted to see what happened.\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:37.000\nSee what happened?\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:38.000\nYeah.\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:40.000\nSorry, I did not know that was coming from actually.\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:43.000\nNo, no, no, you were answering Schrab before when you talked.\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:44.000\nThat's Spencer.\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:45.000\nWho's talking?\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:46.000\nWhere am I?\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:47.000\nYeah.\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:48.000\nSorry, sorry.\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:51.000\nJust imagine Dan's stomach is talking to you.\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:54.000\nThat's the eye line.\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:57.000\nBut no, an answer to the extent that you're feeling any guilt.\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:59.000\nI would immediately absolve you of it.\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:02.000\nAs I would any war veteran.\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:05.000\nI would say follow, follow.\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:11.000\nWell, I wouldn't say follow your heart because then you'd grown and I would follow your bliss,\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:16.000\nfollow your comfort, follow your, I mean, there's no, this is all epilogue and whatever you feel like doing.\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:20.000\nYeah, I mean, obviously they're breaking rules, tracking you down.\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:22.000\nThey're following their fucking impulses.\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:27.000\nThey're figuring out how to find where all the pieces went.\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:29.000\nBut what's different?\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:31.000\nWhat's different in your life now?\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:32.000\nDid you notice anything?\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:36.000\nI mean, did you like, I, you know, I never liked pepperoni before.\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:38.000\nThat's a big thing.\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:40.000\nActually, that happens with transplant.\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:41.000\nSee, you're shaking your head real.\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:47.000\nI was like, yes, because everything, all of your, your interest in this is purely as a direct to video feature.\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:50.000\nI want to see if he's like, oh, I saw a vision.\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:52.000\nI saw a vision of something.\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:54.000\nIt's as if I was running through the bush.\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:56.000\nI got a werewolf's heart.\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:58.000\nYou're a lichen, aren't you?\n\n37:58.000 --> 37:59.000\nWell, hold on.\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:04.000\nNo, but all of these questions are fine, but there's, there's a little more to the story.\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:11.000\nThere's a final little, like, like, like, like cosmic fucking, like, insane thing.\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:12.000\nAll right. Yeah.\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:13.000\nOkay.\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:16.000\nWhich I don't know where to file and didn't know where to file and thought you should just come in and share it.\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:25.000\nSo even though you didn't communicate with them because they connected with your mom, the information came to you.\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:27.000\nYeah, they've seen photos of me.\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:29.000\nThey know, I mean, they sent her emails.\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:32.000\nSo now you know about the donor.\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:34.000\nAnd did you do any investigating of your own?\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:36.000\nOr was it just all information that came to you?\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:37.000\nThe information that came to me.\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:39.000\nI didn't want to know.\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:40.000\nI didn't want them.\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:41.000\nAnd so what did you find out?\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:43.000\nWhat I found out.\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:48.000\nI found out he was from like Northern California.\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:50.000\nAnd he was 27.\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:51.000\nI knew that though.\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:55.000\nI knew the age of the time when I was getting it.\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:59.000\nAnd then I found out how he died.\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:02.000\nAnd that was very interesting.\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:06.000\nAnd that was basically, I found out he committed suicide.\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:16.000\nAnd that was kind of a little hard to hear because the stories were a little flip-flop of what I don't think people want to tell me.\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:19.000\nWhat do you mean they didn't want to?\n\n39:19.000 --> 39:23.000\nI don't think people want me to know that he took his own life.\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:29.000\nAnd that's, I don't know, I mean, it's horrible.\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:31.000\nBut it's something that like, yeah, that's who...\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:37.000\nWell, it makes the mind race through so many strange calculations that you never have to perform.\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:40.000\nAnd I still don't know what the...\n\n39:40.000 --> 39:42.000\nAll I know is that that's insane.\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:45.000\nI don't know what it means, really.\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:49.000\nI don't know if it means like, oh good.\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:52.000\nA person who didn't even want their hearts, they threw it away.\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:54.000\nAnd I found it in the gut.\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:58.000\nOr is it like, I mean, no, it's not like that at all.\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:00.000\nIt's a dumb question.\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:04.000\nFor the life, I'm, you know, 11 years now alive, living.\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:06.000\nAnd it's always been a struggle too.\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:09.000\nLike my heart, like five pacemakers, all that kind of stuff.\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:14.000\nAnd just, yeah, it's, I mean, I'm grateful for it.\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:16.000\nIt's hard to know that that's what happened.\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:23.000\nBut that's kind of, that is, that's life, I guess, too, you know, people choose their own path.\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:25.000\nAnd that's, you know...\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:28.000\nSo another dumb question.\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:30.000\nAnd then I'll let Rob ask his fun questions.\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:32.000\nThat's fun.\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:36.000\nHe wants to know if you can jump higher now.\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:39.000\nI've been able to move one thing real slowly.\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:41.000\nIt's kind of weird. I don't know why.\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:44.000\nYou see the movie Phenomenon? Yeah, it's pretty good.\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:49.000\nHe wants to know if Denzel Washington can help you fight crime by telling you where the cartel is.\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:50.000\nCan't wait.\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:54.000\nDo you feel where a treasure might be?\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:04.000\nBut my one last grounded question, which is a pretty typical one, is just sort of like,\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:19.000\nwell, it's like, like, so, like, all right, so, like, is there some, is there, is there, is there like a psychological or spiritual pressure that comes with...\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:28.000\nI mean, my mind is a lot more open to a lot of things and I believe in, I mean, I don't know, psychological...\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:34.000\nThere's survivors guilt if you just live through something that people...\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:40.000\nBut we never talk about, I don't know if there's donors, donation receiving guilt about like,\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:45.000\noh, I better do something with this heart of the guy saw what I just did last night on that date.\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:50.000\nHe'd be like, what are you doing with my heart?\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:55.000\nAnd you watched Hudson Hawk?\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:56.000\nYeah, why?\n\n41:56.000 --> 42:00.000\nAnd you made her watch it and she told you she didn't like it the first time and you...\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:02.000\nAnd why are you a fan of it?\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:04.000\nWhy are you a fan of it?\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:10.000\nEvery beat is the one that I didn't get and we've used it to watch Hudson Hawk.\n\n42:10.000 --> 42:15.000\nI mean, is there anything like that about, like, did your view of your career change?\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:18.000\nThere's a lot of, yeah, a lot of transplant people.\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:22.000\nThere's a lot of guilt around that, I guess, that some people have.\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:30.000\nAnd yeah, maybe, I mean, internally, I don't have it on the outside of like, I feel bad.\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:35.000\nI don't, I mean, I love the life that was given to me to be here and to be living.\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:40.000\nSo it's not, I don't, I guess I don't really have guilt, you know?\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:43.000\nI have just, just...\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:44.000\nA lot of the guilt...\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:45.000\nAppreciation.\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:48.000\nYeah, a lot of the guilt must go away if you found out he killed himself.\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:54.000\nIt doesn't have to be glib or anything, but it's like, he literally ended his life so that I could live.\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:55.000\nI mean, not so that I could live.\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:58.000\nRight, like with the Hudson Hawk scenario, yeah, when you get that cartoonish.\n\n42:58.000 --> 43:00.000\nYeah, it's like, yeah, you...\n\n43:00.000 --> 43:01.000\nYes.\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:06.000\nWell, I mean, it's better than somebody who wanted to live and got into a car accident.\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:07.000\nYeah.\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:09.000\nNo, it worked out pretty great, I think.\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:12.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:16.000\nThat's, yeah, I guess so.\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:20.000\nBut you've rolled these thoughts over in your head more than we have, right?\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:21.000\nAll the time.\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:25.000\nI mean, I could get rejection anytime.\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:27.000\nLife is really quick.\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:28.000\nWhat do you mean by rejection?\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:29.000\nLike, the heart?\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:31.000\nMy body could reject my heart.\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:32.000\nEven after 11 years?\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:33.000\nPotentially.\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:39.000\nAnd actually after 10 right now, I'm really healthy, I think so.\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:47.000\nBut the body can, yeah, the body eventually can start to reduce my meds, they'll change\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:51.000\nit, try to, I don't know, formula drugs to try to keep me alive.\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.000\nSo you have to take drugs to keep the heart?\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:55.000\nI take a lot of drugs, yeah.\n\n43:55.000 --> 44:00.000\nSo you have white blood cells, I'm sure you all know that, and they attack foreign things\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:03.000\nin your body, and mine is foreign.\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:08.000\nThey're not attacking it right now, but if they ever feel the urge to, because my meds\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:15.000\nstop, and they can do that, because it's not me, it's not you, it's not a part of your\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:16.000\nDNA.\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:18.000\nSo are you like a Jessica Alba now?\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:24.000\nYou can like see other like murderers having, like, I mean,\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:26.000\nI'm a pre-cog, yeah, exactly.\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:28.000\nOkay, cool.\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:31.000\nSo how many ghosts are in the building?\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:33.000\nThere it is, there it is.\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:36.000\nWell, all right, yeah, I'm bad at closing things.\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:37.000\nThat's fine.\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:46.000\nI wanted you to come meet the kids, and I wanted to learn about Tinder, and I wanted to,\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:50.000\nwell, there was one thing that you said when we were talking about it, and I was like,\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:53.000\nit was like you said, you don't even get anesthetic when you do the procedure.\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:55.000\nOh, Jesus Christ!\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:56.000\nRight?\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:59.000\nThey didn't put you under, or they couldn't put you under?\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:01.000\nWell, they couldn't put me under, because my heart was...\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:03.000\nNo, anesthetic, okay, but not, they can't knock you out.\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:06.000\nThey can't knock you all the way out, they have to keep you out like a, I mean, they can't...\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:08.000\nAre you fucking kidding me?\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:12.000\nSo they're going, okay, so here we go.\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:14.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:16.000\nYeah, so they do knock you out?\n\n45:16.000 --> 45:20.000\nOh, I bet it hurts, but ooh, we're almost done, we're almost done.\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:22.000\nYeah, that's pretty much it.\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:25.000\nAlmost done, yeah, almost done, almost done, almost done.\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:28.000\nOne, two, three, ooh, okay.\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:32.000\nAnd that, okay, you didn't see that, you know, and you're just...\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:38.000\nThat's exactly it, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:43.000\nWere you like going, hit, there's a chair, hit me with something really hard, I don't...\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:48.000\nWell, they keep that like a, like, just a happy medium, like, I'm out, but I can hear things.\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:50.000\nOh, fuck!\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:52.000\nAnd I can like...\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:54.000\nOh, my God.\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:56.000\nI don't know.\n\n45:56.000 --> 45:59.000\nAnd then your heart does have to stop for a minute, so there's that episode that they're always...\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:03.000\nSo you heard your old heart stop?\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:05.000\nNo, I didn't hear it.\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:07.000\nOh, okay.\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:10.000\nYou feel it though, you know?\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:12.000\nYou felt it?\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:14.000\nWell, you feel certain things, or you kind of...\n\n46:14.000 --> 46:17.000\nI mean, you go somewhere else, you know?\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:19.000\nYou kind of like...\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:21.000\nBummed out, right?\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:24.000\nLife stuff, you know?\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:29.000\nBut you said, there was a point, and I can't remember where it was, because as they were putting...\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:34.000\nThere was a line that you had, where I...\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:39.000\nBecause I asked you, like, what was the last thing you said before the procedure started, or something like that?\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:41.000\nDo you remember what I'm talking about?\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:43.000\nYeah, I do, yeah.\n\n46:43.000 --> 46:45.000\nI'm just exploiting you, but...\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:47.000\nFuck you, that's fine, you totally are.\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:49.000\nYou fucking are, let's do it.\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:53.000\nI just was yelling out, I don't want to die, I don't want to die, yeah.\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:57.000\nI was with my mom and my sister, and that was...\n\n46:57.000 --> 47:02.000\nAnd they were wheeling me into the room, and that was my last words to them, and that was pretty much...\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:06.000\nIt's funny, because when you were talking about it, I was like, immediately...\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:11.000\nThere's a shame we associate with that.\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:16.000\nNone of us wants to be caught any more than we want to be caught masturbating or taking a shit.\n\n47:16.000 --> 47:19.000\nWe don't want to be caught saying, I don't want to die.\n\n47:19.000 --> 47:23.000\nWe look at it as this thing that, oh, well...\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:29.000\nAnd it's so strange, because it's like, well, shitting and jerking off, it unites us.\n\n47:29.000 --> 47:32.000\nWe all have to do it, right?\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:34.000\nI don't know, it's just like, I don't want to die.\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:38.000\nIt's very, very underappreciated as a very profound statement.\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:40.000\nIt's one of the most...\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:42.000\nThe thing that leopards can't say.\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:45.000\nYou'll never hear it from a fucking giraffe, that's for sure.\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:49.000\nIf giraffes could talk, all they'd say is, now I can reach an apple.\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:51.000\nSo proud of myself.\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:53.000\nI did it, mom, I did it, I did it.\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:57.000\nOnly we would ever say, I don't want to die, even though nothing does.\n\n47:57.000 --> 47:59.000\nI think it's human, it's in our...\n\n47:59.000 --> 48:02.000\nWe're animals, we're something, it's in our DNA.\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:06.000\nYeah, and I've been through so much, and I don't want to die.\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:12.000\nAnd I've been clinically dead a few times, and it's like, yeah, it's...\n\n48:12.000 --> 48:15.000\nI love people around me, I love to live, you know.\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:19.000\nAnd there was a dude somewhere that, for whatever reason, he did want to.\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:26.000\nAnd it's fantastic that some geniuses were able to use a part of them to keep your wish.\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:28.000\nIt's really fucking incredible.\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:31.000\nYeah, my surgery was supposed to be five hours, and it was ten hours long.\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:36.000\nI lost a ton of blood, a lot of things, and my heart was swolled over.\n\n48:36.000 --> 48:38.000\nIt was definitely a long ordeal.\n\n48:38.000 --> 48:40.000\nDid they try to convince you it was your fault?\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:42.000\nYeah, it took ten hours.\n\n48:42.000 --> 48:44.000\nYou know, you really got to calm down.\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:53.000\nSo you were half awake for ten hours.\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:56.000\nI mean, I was out, they're not talking to me, you know, they're not like...\n\n48:56.000 --> 48:59.000\nWell, no, they're probably hoping, they're ignoring you.\n\n48:59.000 --> 49:03.000\nThey're like, if they look you in the eye, they'd be like, oh man.\n\n49:03.000 --> 49:06.000\nOh, by the way, did you hear that?\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:11.000\nYou're not allowed to, the donor, the guy that performs the actual surgery,\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:16.000\nunlike all the other surgeries anyone has ever had, like the doctor doesn't meet you.\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:18.000\nYou never see his face, you never know his name, right?\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:19.000\nNo, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n49:19.000 --> 49:20.000\nWhy is that?\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:21.000\nWhy is that?\n\n49:21.000 --> 49:24.000\nThey don't want that human contact, I guess?\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:26.000\nYeah, I've watched The Nick.\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:29.000\nI know what you're talking about.\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:32.000\nI think that's interesting too, that the guys that do the...\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:39.000\nAnd ladies, goddammit, Harmon, the geniuses who's fingers are the most precise\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:48.000\nand who really know how to do this top of the line bomb squad thing in a human body,\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:54.000\nlike they actually, if you go up the tiers enough, they're like the same as executioners.\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:56.000\nThey wear masks and they...\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:59.000\nThey have to have a separation, otherwise they would probably blow their brains off.\n\n49:59.000 --> 50:02.000\nBecause all they want to think about is the math and the fucking...\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:06.000\nThey just don't want that connection, like, you know, he was a great kid.\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:11.000\nThere also isn't, I mean, more to the point that they probably, isn't about the outcome too.\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:15.000\nThey don't want to know what happens to you after you leave.\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:17.000\nThey want to just walk away from it to the next one\n\n50:17.000 --> 50:20.000\nbecause they want to be thinking about something they've read about you\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:22.000\nwhile they're working on someone else.\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:23.000\nThey'll read about me here.\n\n50:23.000 --> 50:25.000\nPretty nice.\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:34.000\nWell, let's all give Kyle a warm thank you for opening himself up\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:40.000\nand sharing his heart with us.\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:41.000\nThank you.\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:43.000\nIs there anything?\n\n50:43.000 --> 50:45.000\nOh, you have that thing you wanted to plug.\n\n50:45.000 --> 50:46.000\nHe's also doing a one-man show.\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:48.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:50.000\nI mean, is there anything as long as you're...\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:53.000\nI just called you by your first name because I figured you're not a stand-up.\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:55.000\nYeah, yeah, that's fine.\n\n50:55.000 --> 50:57.000\nPlugging anything? I don't know.\n\n50:57.000 --> 51:00.000\nWhen you were clinically dead.\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:01.000\nThere's a lot of that.\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:04.000\nSo, how many times were you clinically dead?\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:07.000\nJesus, here we go again.\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:08.000\nThree.\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:09.000\nThree?\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:11.000\nI think three, yeah, I think three times.\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:12.000\nAll right.\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:15.000\nSo, Ben Franklin?\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:19.000\nHe was clinically finishing the segment and he saw the other side.\n\n51:19.000 --> 51:26.000\nHe was going into the light and then you've pulled him back to a cold room where...\n\n51:26.000 --> 51:29.000\nYou just wanted to know more, man.\n\n51:29.000 --> 51:31.000\nI nailed it.\n\n51:31.000 --> 51:32.000\nI did a four-point landing.\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:33.000\nThey applauded.\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:39.000\nHe grabbed his hat and you have more Roger Corman questions.\n\n51:39.000 --> 51:40.000\nCome on, dude.\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:42.000\nI'm supposed to undercut you.\n\n51:42.000 --> 51:44.000\nThis is my job.\n\n51:44.000 --> 51:47.000\nI don't know where you read that.\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:51.000\nBetween the lines.\n\n51:51.000 --> 52:00.000\nWell, anyways, thank you again, Kyle, for coming and sharing your self-opening heart sharing.\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:01.000\nRemember that?\n\n52:01.000 --> 52:02.000\nMore than one thing.\n\n52:02.000 --> 52:04.000\nI'm just going to play it.\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:05.000\nI brew beer.\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:08.000\nIf you all love beer, I'm trying to start a beer bar.\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:11.000\nSo, yeah, hopefully one day I'll get that going.\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:12.000\nAll right, well, let me know.\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:14.000\nYeah, you know how to get in contact with us.\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:17.000\nLet us know when the grand opening is.\n\n52:17.000 --> 52:22.000\nWe'll do our version of Kickstarter, which is we'll all get drunk at your bar.\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:23.000\nI got a brewer, probably.\n\n52:23.000 --> 52:24.000\nSo, yeah, we'll brew beer.\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:26.000\nIs it going to have a clever name?\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:28.000\nLike the aortic...\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:30.000\nNow who's Roger Corman?\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:32.000\nAll right, all right, all right.\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:33.000\nWho's ready?\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:35.000\nA guy's coming up with log lines.\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:37.000\nThe sleeve behind the sleeve of the door.\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:38.000\nI don't know.\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:39.000\nAll right, thanks, Kyle.\n\n52:39.000 --> 52:43.000\nWe'll check back in with him at some point.\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:51.000\nDan, Dan, have you ever had surgery?\n\n52:51.000 --> 52:52.000\nI had a biopsy.\n\n52:52.000 --> 52:53.000\nI got this...\n\n52:53.000 --> 52:55.000\nUgh, gross.\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:58.000\nWhat did you...\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:00.000\nHow many opsees did you buy?\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:01.000\nThat was stupid.\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:04.000\nHow good of a friend are you that you don't know about your...\n\n53:04.000 --> 53:05.000\nI knew it.\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:07.000\nI was setting you up to talk about it.\n\n53:07.000 --> 53:08.000\nI knew about it.\n\n53:08.000 --> 53:11.000\nHow good of a friend of you that didn't come to my birthday\n\n53:11.000 --> 53:16.000\nor say happy birthday kissing Dan Gooderman on Twitter\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:21.000\nand you don't say happy birthday to get no text?\n\n53:21.000 --> 53:24.000\nWell, you're always hanging out with your Lego friends.\n\n53:24.000 --> 53:27.000\nThat's why we text each other.\n\n53:27.000 --> 53:29.000\nWe love each other.\n\n53:29.000 --> 53:31.000\nWell, I...\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:36.000\nWhen he was talking about how could you reject something\n\n53:36.000 --> 53:40.000\nafter 11 years, it's in your chest.\n\n53:40.000 --> 53:44.000\nI was thinking about you, man.\n\n53:44.000 --> 53:47.000\nAnd how possible it is.\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:50.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:52.000\nWell, I think...\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:55.000\nI don't know about you, but I think this is a very interesting podcast\n\n53:55.000 --> 53:57.000\nI've put together.\n\n53:57.000 --> 53:59.000\nI think you're doing a really good job.\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:00.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:01.000\nIt's a mellow one.\n\n54:01.000 --> 54:02.000\nI don't need it.\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:04.000\nIt's its own reward.\n\n54:04.000 --> 54:05.000\nIt's a mellow one.\n\n54:05.000 --> 54:06.000\nAll right.\n\n54:06.000 --> 54:09.000\nI get paid in fun.\n\n54:09.000 --> 54:10.000\nAll right.\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:14.000\nSpencer, talk about the Chinese or ISIS or...\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:18.000\nSo you guys have heard about these murder vans, right?\n\n54:18.000 --> 54:19.000\nNo.\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:21.000\nMurder vans.\n\n54:21.000 --> 54:22.000\nMurder vans.\n\n54:22.000 --> 54:23.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n54:23.000 --> 54:26.000\nWas that like the legend of beggar vans?\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:27.000\nIt's just...\n\n54:27.000 --> 54:28.000\nOh, God.\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:29.000\nAll right.\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:30.000\nI knew it.\n\n54:30.000 --> 54:31.000\nOkay, shit.\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:32.000\nI knew I shouldn't have...\n\n54:32.000 --> 54:34.000\nThe white blood cells are getting suspicious.\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:35.000\nI know.\n\n54:35.000 --> 54:36.000\nI know.\n\n54:36.000 --> 54:37.000\nI know.\n\n54:37.000 --> 54:38.000\nI'm with you guys.\n\n54:38.000 --> 54:39.000\nI don't want to be here tonight.\n\n54:39.000 --> 54:40.000\nI knew it.\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:41.000\nI knew it.\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:42.000\nIt was nice of you.\n\n54:42.000 --> 54:43.000\nOh, I know what we need to talk about.\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:44.000\nOkay, so...\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:45.000\nOkay.\n\n54:45.000 --> 54:46.000\nChits.\n\n54:46.000 --> 54:47.000\nOkay.\n\n54:47.000 --> 54:48.000\nI'm so sorry.\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:49.000\nSo every once in a while it appears we have to keep reminding you what a monopoly\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:51.000\nguy is in screenwriting.\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:52.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n54:52.000 --> 54:53.000\nOh.\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:54.000\nOh, okay.\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:55.000\nI thought...\n\n54:55.000 --> 54:58.000\nI thought that's how I'm going to die.\n\n54:58.000 --> 55:03.000\nThe end of a garb.\n\n55:03.000 --> 55:10.000\nIt's always a person you least expect.\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:16.000\nIt was nice.\n\n55:16.000 --> 55:19.000\nIt was thinking for doing us...\n\n55:19.000 --> 55:20.440\nYou did do me a favor.\n\n55:20.440 --> 55:22.000\nHe said, I'll do it if you're in a jam.\n\n55:22.000 --> 55:27.000\nI said, I am in a jam, or why would I be like that?\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:28.000\nI'm in a jam.\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:32.000\nI haven't had my vitamins today.\n\n55:32.000 --> 55:33.000\nWhat vitamins do you take?\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:34.000\nThat excites me.\n\n55:34.000 --> 55:35.000\nI take out...\n\n55:35.000 --> 55:40.000\nIn order to do the bit, I had to be off my...\n\n55:40.000 --> 55:42.000\nI said, vitamin C.\n\n55:42.000 --> 55:43.000\nGoddammit.\n\n55:43.000 --> 55:44.000\nVitamin C.\n\n55:44.000 --> 55:45.000\nI know what it is.\n\n55:45.000 --> 55:46.000\nI'm just shocked.\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:47.000\nI know what you were saying.\n\n55:47.000 --> 55:59.000\nI know that's what the Lego people run on.\n\n55:59.000 --> 56:01.000\nNine movies.\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:02.000\nCome on.\n\n56:02.000 --> 56:04.000\nThey're Legos.\n\n56:04.000 --> 56:07.000\nKnock the coke off over there.\n\n56:07.000 --> 56:09.000\nCouple too many Lego movies coming out.\n\n56:09.000 --> 56:11.000\nThey're cocaine.\n\n56:11.000 --> 56:12.000\nThey're not...\n\n56:12.000 --> 56:14.000\nThey don't call them Legos.\n\n56:14.000 --> 56:15.000\nThey go bricks.\n\n56:15.000 --> 56:17.000\nThank you.\n\n56:17.000 --> 56:19.000\nSo the monopoly, guys.\n\n56:19.000 --> 56:20.000\nSo the reason we're bringing this up...\n\n56:20.000 --> 56:22.000\nI don't want to have to keep explaining this to you.\n\n56:22.000 --> 56:28.000\nI mean, you're basing this off of me who saw a commercial.\n\n56:28.000 --> 56:31.000\nLet's verify it first because I might be wrong,\n\n56:31.000 --> 56:32.000\nbecause I haven't seen the movie.\n\n56:32.000 --> 56:34.000\nThe movie Sisters?\n\n56:34.000 --> 56:36.000\nIs there a monopoly guy in Sisters?\n\n56:36.000 --> 56:38.000\nOh, there's a monopoly guy in Sisters.\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:39.000\nWhat's the monopoly guy in Sisters?\n\n56:39.000 --> 56:40.000\nI haven't seen it.\n\n56:40.000 --> 56:42.000\nThere's a woman wearing a big belt,\n\n56:42.000 --> 56:43.000\nand they're like,\n\n56:43.000 --> 56:45.000\nOh, have a good time at the championship.\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:46.000\nAnd she's like,\n\n56:46.000 --> 56:47.000\nWhat?\n\n56:47.000 --> 56:49.000\nWhere you won the belt at because you're a wrestler?\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:51.000\nI did the joke bad.\n\n56:51.000 --> 56:52.000\nBut yeah.\n\n56:52.000 --> 56:54.000\nBut that is a monopoly guy.\n\n56:54.000 --> 56:55.000\nYeah, no, it's a monopoly guy.\n\n56:55.000 --> 57:00.000\nIf you go, Holy cow, if you have a movie or whatever,\n\n57:00.000 --> 57:03.000\ndo we want to say the origin of the monopoly guy?\n\n57:03.000 --> 57:04.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n57:04.000 --> 57:06.000\nJust to remind you of the new-time listeners,\n\n57:06.000 --> 57:10.000\nthe monopoly guy is named after the moment in Ace Ventura 2\n\n57:10.000 --> 57:14.000\nwhen Jim Carrey is about to let a guy have it,\n\n57:14.000 --> 57:17.000\nand he's wearing it.\n\n57:17.000 --> 57:19.000\nHe's dressed like the monopoly guy.\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:20.000\nHe's bald.\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:21.000\nHe's got a mustache, a monocle.\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:22.000\nHe's in a tux.\n\n57:22.000 --> 57:26.000\nAnd the guy says, Oh, I don't like people who talk to animals\n\n57:26.000 --> 57:28.000\nand make faces.\n\n57:28.000 --> 57:31.000\nAnd Jim Carrey goes, I'm sorry, we haven't met.\n\n57:31.000 --> 57:34.000\nYou must be the monopoly guy.\n\n57:34.000 --> 57:36.000\nAnd it's like, it's a joke.\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:39.000\nBut the problem is, with a monopoly guy,\n\n57:39.000 --> 57:41.000\nand it's very clever as it turns out,\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:44.000\nbecause you're kind of holding a monopoly over all of reality,\n\n57:44.000 --> 57:47.000\nand it's not really fair that you're profiting a laugh,\n\n57:47.000 --> 57:49.000\nwhich you really aren't.\n\n57:49.000 --> 57:55.000\nSo then you, my friends, you're my Asperger's flock.\n\n57:55.000 --> 57:58.000\nThey're like, you know, I know I always qualify this by saying,\n\n57:58.000 --> 58:00.000\nlike, because for you guys, because you're going to be tweeting me,\n\n58:00.000 --> 58:02.000\nwell, isn't a monopoly guy all comedy?\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:04.000\nBecause then you're always contriving everything,\n\n58:04.000 --> 58:07.000\nand actually, actually, actually, actually.\n\n58:07.000 --> 58:09.000\nYeah, no, we're talking about, we're not talking about\n\n58:09.000 --> 58:11.000\nit is or it isn't.\n\n58:11.000 --> 58:12.000\nWe're talking about a thing.\n\n58:12.000 --> 58:15.000\nIt's like, well, unnecessary roughness and football.\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:16.000\nI mean, what is it?\n\n58:16.000 --> 58:18.000\nWell, I've, I've, I've tried jockey.\n\n58:18.000 --> 58:20.000\nI'm just saying, like, it's a concept.\n\n58:20.000 --> 58:22.000\nIt's like, like, there's, you know, there's,\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:25.000\nthere's places where lines are clearly crossed.\n\n58:25.000 --> 58:29.000\nSo the monopoly guy, the actual monopoly guy one is one.\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:30.000\nDon't do that.\n\n58:30.000 --> 58:33.000\nBack then it was then Water Boy with Adam Sandler,\n\n58:33.000 --> 58:35.000\nthe guy walks in, he's dressed like Colonel Sanders.\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:37.000\nAll right, Colonel Sanders, and it's like,\n\n58:37.000 --> 58:39.000\nit's supposed to be a laugh, but it was a scene closer.\n\n58:39.000 --> 58:41.000\nIt's not fair. It's a monopoly guy.\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:42.000\nYou can't do it. You're not allowed to do it.\n\n58:42.000 --> 58:45.000\nYou can't dress a guy up exactly like Colonel Sanders\n\n58:45.000 --> 58:48.000\nand go, zing, you look like Colonel Sanders.\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:49.000\nIt's cheating.\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:52.000\nYou can't, you can't dress a guy like Colonel Sanders\n\n58:52.000 --> 58:54.000\nand, and, and, and now I'm going like,\n\n58:54.000 --> 58:55.000\nhi, I know what you're thinking.\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:57.000\nI'm dressed like Colonel Sanders, but here's the thing.\n\n58:57.000 --> 58:59.000\nLike, you could throw it away and keep moving\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:02.000\nand do more with this character.\n\n59:02.000 --> 59:04.000\nJust like, let him be dressed like Colonel Sanders.\n\n59:04.000 --> 59:06.000\nCall him Colonel Sanders.\n\n59:06.000 --> 59:08.000\nHave that be the character's name.\n\n59:08.000 --> 59:09.000\nI don't care.\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:10.000\nI'm not here to tell you what to do.\n\n59:10.000 --> 59:12.000\nI'm here to tell you to stop doing that one thing.\n\n59:12.000 --> 59:13.000\nRight.\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:16.000\nAnd the reason I tell you again is because according to Rob,\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:19.000\nthis is a preliminary monopoly guy,\n\n59:19.000 --> 59:23.000\nalert code orange because it's based on a trailer, clip,\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:24.000\nTV commercial.\n\n59:24.000 --> 59:28.000\nWhat's the new Christmas with the fartings?\n\n59:28.000 --> 59:29.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n59:29.000 --> 59:30.000\nThe new Seth Rogen movie.\n\n59:30.000 --> 59:31.000\nRight.\n\n59:31.000 --> 59:33.000\nThat was, that was my guess at the title.\n\n59:33.000 --> 59:34.000\nThe night before.\n\n59:34.000 --> 59:35.000\nThe night before.\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:36.000\nThe night before.\n\n59:36.000 --> 59:37.000\nAnybody see the trailer for it?\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:38.000\nOh, the movie's back.\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:40.000\nWell, I don't, I'm not here to qualify\n\n59:40.000 --> 59:42.000\nwhether the movie is good or not.\n\n59:42.000 --> 59:44.000\nI hear actually, it's pretty good.\n\n59:44.000 --> 59:49.000\nBut, I heard it.\n\n59:49.000 --> 59:50.000\nI didn't see it.\n\n59:50.000 --> 59:53.000\nWe could talk after the show, but in the trailer,\n\n59:53.000 --> 59:59.000\nisn't there, Seth Rogen is talking to two little girls\n\n59:59.000 --> 01:00:06.000\nwho are twins, who are in like a blue little dresses\n\n01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000\nand like pigtails.\n\n01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000\nAnd he says, what does he say?\n\n01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000\nThere's something about the shining.\n\n01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000\nHe says, oh, okay, hey, you know,\n\n01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000\nyou guys are from the shining or something?\n\n01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000\nRight.\n\n01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000\nSomething like that.\n\n01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000\nThey said, you look, you look weird.\n\n01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000\nHe said, have you ever seen the shining?\n\n01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000\nYeah.\n\n01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000\nYou can't, I mean, I can't do it.\n\n01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000\nMaybe it's a great movie.\n\n01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000\nCan't do that.\n\n01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000\nI'm a fan of everybody.\n\n01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nThat's not a joke.\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000\nI'm a fan of everybody involved, but it's cheating\n\n01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000\nbecause if you write in the script two girls that are\n\n01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000\ndressed like the twins in the shining says,\n\n01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000\nRogen says, have you seen the shining?\n\n01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000\nThat you can't, that's cheating.\n\n01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000\nIt's cheating.\n\n01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000\nYou're cheating.\n\n01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000\nYou're cheating.\n\n01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000\nYou can't, you can't like, you're being a bully.\n\n01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000\nYou're being a bully, I think.\n\n01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000\nYou're being a bully.\n\n01:00:54.000 -->

01:05:52.000\nAnd they were like, what did you do?\n\n01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000\nHe's like, I don't know.\n\n01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000\nI like his socks.\n\n01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000\nBut

01:06:03.000\nYeah, I like if Flea, he turned it back on the interview\n\n01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000\nor was off camera.\n\n01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000\nHe's like, I don't think it was funny.\n\n01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000\nWhat did you think?\n\n01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000\nAre you paying attention right now, sir?\n\n01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.000\nOh, I'm shooting an E behind the music package.\n\n01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000\nAnd the interviewer wasn't Mike.\n\n01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000\nHe was just like listening.\n\n01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000\nOh, OK.\n\n01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000\nThat's a good point.\n\n01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000\nBut I thought that was a good move.\n\n01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000\nI learned that from Flea.\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.000\nRemember when we were thinking about moving my garage nine\n\n01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000\nfeet to the right?\n\n01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000\nMaking it bigger or something?\n\n01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000\nI mean, it still may be something.\n\n01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000\nAnd then the guy came and he was like, OK, so here's the thing.\n\n01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000\nAnd then there was this whole estimate.\n\n01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000\nAnd then the Flea showed up.\n\n01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000\nAnd he was like, ah, I drum stuff.\n\n01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000\nHe's a drummer, right?\n\n01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000\nCome on, Harmon.\n\n01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000\nAre you chicken?\n\n01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000\nOh, you always know.\n\n01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000\nYeah.\n\n01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000\nHarmon hates it when you call him chicken.\n\n01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000\nIt's going to make it.\n\n01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000\nWe haven't ever heard that before.\n\n01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000\nIt's going to make him publicly declare you're two and three\n\n01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000\nsucked in a documentary about it.\n\n01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000\nAs far as today's concerned, I know we never mentioned it\n\n01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000\nbefore, but when Harmon is called chicken,\n\n01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000\nhe just can't handle it.\n\n01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000\nEspecially when it's me.\n\n01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000\nIt'll make anything happen.\n\n01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000\nDon't do it.\n\n01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000\nYeah, I said in that documentary about Back to the Future\n\n01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000\nthat one of the notable things about what a great movie\n\n01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000\nBack to the Future is is that it breaks so many rules,\n\n01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000\nincluding the fact that Marty McFly is not really a very,\n\n01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000\nkind of flawed protagonist.\n\n01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000\nHe's like a very willing hero.\n\n01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000\nHe doesn't refuse a lot of calls.\n\n01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000\nHe just like charges across the threshold, blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:07:47.000 -->

really funny.\n\n01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000\nOh, there's just pictures of actual dicks like photos.\n\n01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000\nWeird.\n\n01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000\nYou don't respond to

01:14:41.000\nI sent you a picture of a dick and you don't do anything.\n\n01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000\nSo I figured you didn't get it.\n\n01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:48.000\nSo like the guy in the writer's room who keeps pitching the same joke because no one's responding\n\n01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.000\nto it.\n\n01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000\nI mean, I...\n\n01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000\nLook, maybe we could pick something that we watch together or something because I don't\n\n01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000\nwatch TV anymore and I'm divorced.\n\n01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000\nLike there's no reason to watch things and I just...\n\n01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000\nI don't watch fucking crap movies.\n\n01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000\nWatch like Hologram Man

that saw like boys in the hood and went, you know what this movie\n\n01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000\nis missing?\n\n01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000\nUltralight aircraft.\n\n01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000\nUltralight aircraft.\n\n01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.000\nI mean, it's not going anywhere.\n\n01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000\nYeah.\n\n01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000\nThey thought hip-hop was a fad.\n\n01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000\nRight, right.\n\n01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000\nNow they think ultralight aircraft is a fad.\n\n01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000\nThere's a hip-hop in it, too.\n\n01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000\nYeah, there's a lot of hip-hop in it.\n\n01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.000\nIt's like a fully-realized film with a soundtrack.\n\n01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000\nThere's a dance in it.\n\n01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.000\nThere's a Humpty-Hump dance movie.\n\n01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:12.000\nIt's all leading up to, now we're going to get into our ultralights and we're going to\n\n01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.000\ntake back the streets and they get into their ultralights and they take back the streets.\n\n01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000\nIt delivers on the poster.\n\n01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000\nIt's great.\n\n01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000\nStreet Wars.\n\n01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000\nI like movies like that where it's clearly like the movies made by a company.\n\n01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000\nLike a karate studio or a dance studio.\n\n01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000\nMiami Connection.\n\n01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000\nYeah.\n\n01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000\nOr an ultralight dealership.\n\n01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000\nWe should make a movie.\n\n01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000\nI think that's great.\n\n01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:45.000\nSomebody says, I'll give you the money to make your movie about street life if you show some\n\n01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000\nof my product in your film.\n\n01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.000\nOh, that would be amazing.\n\n01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.000\nYeah, I kept thinking it was just like the same people, but that would be even funnier\n\n01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000\nthat somebody was like, I'm a really passionate filmmaker.\n\n01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000\nI'm like a pre-John Singleton or a contemporary.\n\n01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:08.000\nI don't know what year that movie was, but it's like, I just want to express my point\n\n01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000\nof view about what it is to grow up in the environment I grew up in.\n\n01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000\nAnd then someone's like, well, I'm not paying for it.\n\n01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.000\nI'm not paying for it.\n\n01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000\nI'm not paying for it.\n\n01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000\nI'll pay for it.\n\n01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000\nI'll pay for it.\n\n01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000\nMy name's Bob Ultralight.\n\n01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.000\nFrom your local ultralight dealership.\n\n01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.000\nDid you have fun at my birthday party?\n\n01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.000\nI had a blast.\n\n01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000\nI'm so glad you were there.\n\n01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000\nThat was really great.\n\n01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000\nThank you for coming to that.\n\n01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000\nThank you for coming to that.\n\n01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000\nI invited Dan and Spencer.\n\n01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000\nI caught up with old friends I hadn't seen in a while.\n\n01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000\nYeah, me too.\n\n01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000\nA lot of old friends I haven't seen in a while.\n\n01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000\nA lot of good friends.\n\n01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000\nA lot of new friends.\n\n01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000\nThis is cool.\n\n01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nThis is so cool.\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000\nThere's a point in the movie, the first time you see the ultralight, they're like, they're\n\n01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000\nhanging out.\n\n01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000\nI don't know where they are.\n\n01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000\nAnd one of the main characters flies down in one.\n\n01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000\nAnd there's a whole conversation where the guy's like, what is that?\n\n01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000\nAnd then he explains.\n\n01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000\nHe goes, you don't have a license to fly.\n\n01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000\nAnd he goes, I don't need one.\n\n01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000\nAnd then he goes through like a point by point explanation of the code that allows him.\n\n01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000\nThe government doesn't yet recognize these as vehicles.\n\n01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000\nSo he can fly them.\n\n01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000\nThey're basically chairs with propellers.\n\n01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000\nYeah.\n\n01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:22.000\nI love the part of the enthusiasm for it is that it's totally fucking dangerous.\n\n01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000\nAnd at any moment we'll be banned or regulated.\n\n01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000\nBut there's a loophole.\n\n01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000\nYeah.\n\n01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:35.000\nThe gangsters are on the ground and they're not even like the right, they're wearing,\n\n01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000\nthey're all wearing one shot.\n\n01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000\nThey're all wearing overalls.\n\n01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000\nYou're wearing overalls in bright colors.\n\n01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000\nAnd then the guys come flying in at night shooting at them.\n\n01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000\nAnd then one of them turns around and shoots back.\n\n01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000\nAnd the guy goes, I'm hit.\n\n01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000\nI'm going down.\n\n01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000\nAnd then they yell out, you got T-Bone.\n\n01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000\nYou got T-Bone.\n\n01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000\nI wouldn't have turned around and talked to that ultra light.\n\n01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000\nI would have blown out.\n\n01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000\nI cut like an hour out of that film too.\n\n01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.000\nLike I went to the whole film and just went to the good stuff because when they get to\n\n01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000\nthe ultra lights and you're like, all right, they got to the ultra light stuff.\n\n01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:16.000\nIt's just like sit back for 45 minutes of the same shot of the ultra light flying through\n\n01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:23.000\nthe frame and a guy on a sound stage going, it takes forever.\n\n01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000\nYeah.\n\n01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000\nYeah.\n\n01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000\nThe death to squib ratio is a little lower.\n\n01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000\nYeah.\n\n01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000\nSo it was like my 46th birthday.\n\n01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.000\nI only have one of those in my life that I'll have.\n\n01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000\nYou know, I only have one, but I'm glad you were there, Demar.\n\n01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000\nWe've known each other for a long time.\n\n01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:47.000\nNot as old as, you know, you know, not the oldest friend I've had, but, you know.\n\n01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000\nBut I'm glad you were there.\n\n01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000\nI was good.\n\n01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000\nThank you for having me.\n\n01:19:51.000 -->

Well, I don't know what is it?\n\n01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:45.760\nYeah\n\n01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:49.360\nRack and Syria or Iraq and Lafont right? Is that what the ISIL is?\n\n01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:54.280\nYeah, that's why that's why if you're an NPR you call it ISIL because it's like really more like going you got a\n\n01:24:54.280 --> 01:25:00.040\nGoa well, you're supposed to call it dice because it pisses them off\n\n01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:06.320\nOh, really what they say. Yeah, they say they they they they pledge to kill anyone who calls them dice. Well, Jesus Christ\n\n01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:11.400\nWell, that's a Voldemort said to and look what happened there\n\n01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:20.040\nYeah\n\n01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:26.920\nSo that was his idea don't don't ever say my name. He seems more vain. I don't know who came up with I think everybody else\n\n01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:33.600\nI mean like you're just asking for trouble. Yeah, it's gonna be something. Yeah, it's the Streisand effect. Yeah, that's what Voldemort died of\n\n01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:37.360\nDon't don't call me Streisand\n\n01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:40.440\nDon't you dare call me Streisand\n\n01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:44.960\nDon't stress. Do you call me Streisand? I'll put a hex on you\n\n01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:47.600\nDon't call me Streisand\n\n01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:52.640\nDon't you dare if you call me if you call me Streisand\n\n01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:56.640\nI'm gonna come out of I'm gonna come down there\n\n01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:00.760\nWith my cane and I'm gonna just I'm gonna whack\n\n01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:09.920\nHalfway through committing to that I gave up\n\n01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:15.080\nNot where you think it is\n\n01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:17.080\nThe\n\n01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:23.640\nWell, the alarming thing is this is what I keep running through of my head now as I like how\n\n01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:29.400\nHow actually effective this I mean, I don't understand as a 42 year old\n\n01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:35.720\nI grew up in a world where the concept of terrorism was like it was like these Fisher price figures\n\n01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:40.760\nAnd they got the outfits and they're like one of their defining features is like no graphic design\n\n01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:47.400\nNo, no, I mean these guys are like, you know, these are these are kids now new. These are millennial terrorists\n\n01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:51.680\nTheir their videos are, you know, very JJ Abrams inspired\n\n01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.640\nThey like their little\n\n01:26:54.960 --> 01:27:02.920\nTime rampings and you know, they know their way around Final Cut and it's weird because it's like it's like it's\n\n01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:06.440\nFor no other reason that it just like changes everything\n\n01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:13.420\nThat that and also I think the other thing that makes them new is that they\n\n01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:19.440\nWhereas I think the I think when I was a kid what we call the terrorist was somebody that was kind of\n\n01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:24.160\nFoolish enough to say well, I'm just gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna create this\n\n01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:31.720\nCatastrophe and it's gonna punish this country for doing this and then they're gonna think twice before the blah blah blah\n\n01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:33.080\nAnd all that kind of thing where it's just like well\n\n01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:38.240\nThis is just gonna play out in a pretty predictable way. You're not you're no one's ever gonna, you know, blah blah blah\n\n01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:41.040\nAnd that these this is like like like their goal\n\n01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:49.120\nAs far as I understand it their long-term larger goal is simply to provoke simply to actually\n\n01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:54.920\nPolarize and I hope there was a real sneeze and not a good guy who's like bullshit\n\n01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:56.920\nThe\n\n01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:08.880\nTheir goal is simply to polarize right this is not a conspiracy theory. This is like this is I've heard this again and again\n\n01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:12.880\nAnd it's like like what they want and what they are so close to\n\n01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:23.360\nHaving because it's like it's so it's there a couple of blown-up things away from this goal from polarizing is for is for is for is for\n\n01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:28.720\nRational people not just like paranoid Jingoist nutbars\n\n01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:32.680\nLike rational people to start getting so\n\n01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:43.000\nFreaked out and scared that we just started to just figure the solution must be more irrational than rational because right now we still have this like\n\n01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:48.000\nThis this this hold on this idea that as complicated as things are getting\n\n01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.840\nThat they like like like we have to we have to make sure we compartmentalize in our heads\n\n01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:58.040\nThey like like this is not a this is a this is a war between people that want to fight and people that don't want to fight\n\n01:28:58.040 --> 01:28:58.680\nas\n\n01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:02.440\nThis is not a war between between people that want to fight that are\n\n01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:09.320\nHave one flying and people this is like the people that love fighting are trying to fucking cajole us into like a\n\n01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:15.240\nCrazy fucking like weird form of World War three where it's just like\n\n01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:18.440\nWe're the where we just start doing crazy shit, which we've done in the past\n\n01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:26.080\nWhich is like right? Let's start rounding people up and it's already been being proposed by our fringe elements like let's start tracking things\n\n01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:31.520\nLet's start keeping lists. Let's put you in a I'm sure you're great if you're not guilty you've nothing to worry about\n\n01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:36.040\nBut why don't you stay in this chain link pen for a second? We're just it's just about freedom and\n\n01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:43.880\nAnd it's and it's and that those people are not gonna fucking go in there and go you know what America's\n\n01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:49.240\nFantastic, and so is the entire Western world, and you know what sucks my religion is why I'm locked up in this cage\n\n01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:53.800\nThat that the cycle will create a shitter get off the pot\n\n01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:57.360\nshowdown between people who of\n\n01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:05.360\nthe Islamic faith radical or not and people from Western society Westernized society a\n\n01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:14.640\nA crazy or not I like that even the moderate people will all just like be sucked into this horrible fucking nightmare\n\n01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:20.080\nAnd that and that shit will hit the fan and spray all over all of us and we'll have shit all over us that that's their goal\n\n01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:26.360\nThat's that shit on us that they're not they're they're not dumb enough anymore to be like oh, I'm gonna\n\n01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:33.480\nWe're gonna beat this country or that could they're just like no the fucking list is\n\n01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:39.960\nLike what Charles Manson thought he was trying to do by spray painting the n-word on like you know on the wall\n\n01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:43.520\nWhere he killed people's like his his idea was like this like long-term like\n\n01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:49.960\ndestabilization thing and it's doesn't it feel like they're getting really close to that goal\n\n01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:55.520\nLike I don't know how we're gonna get further away from that goal. I don't know how we're gonna get less scared if\n\n01:30:57.200 --> 01:30:59.480\nI don't know how to relax more\n\n01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:07.360\nBut I only I only know how to get increasingly more uptight and frightened and more like like willing to any one of those groups\n\n01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:10.480\nIs at that point right now if that's\n\n01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:14.560\nBecause if you want to do that then you simply have to do that\n\n01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:18.680\nIt's just it's just you know if somebody wanted to scare the shit out of people. That was your sole goal\n\n01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:22.600\nThey could for lack of a you know\n\n01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:29.480\nBetter I just you know load up a device or whatever go off to the highway somewhere pull off the road and set that off\n\n01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:34.360\nThat without any explanation or any rational connection to it and no claim to it would be the thing that would be the most terrifying\n\n01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:38.320\nRight, so but I think that these broad these issues are\n\n01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:44.600\nMultiphasic there are so many different things that are a play and specifically in this case because\n\n01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:50.640\nFundamentalism is at the center of it. There is a core center and there is a core center\n\n01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:52.640\nschedule\n\n01:31:55.200 --> 01:32:00.800\nFor what's going on but outside of that it's it's you know where it reaches out from that core center\n\n01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:07.320\nThey're just a lot of different sort of sets of goals and they're into individual there individual in their own sort of\n\n01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:12.680\nWay they're gonna play out on what those individual goals are so certain things are happening\n\n01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:14.640\nbut\n\n01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:19.320\nThey're happening in their own sort of arena and also we see on our end of it\n\n01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:25.040\nThe packaged news version of it even now when news is 24 hours a day and it's all over the place\n\n01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:27.680\nYou're being told you're getting breaking news\n\n01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:32.440\nBut again depends on what you're reading and where you are and whether how you know what the moment is and what the source is\n\n01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:38.640\nHow filtered or unfiltered or how breaking it is, but it's all packaged so what you're not getting is\n\n01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:42.560\nAnd this is probably a good thing. You're not getting a clear sense of what\n\n01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:46.440\nFor example the extent of our interdiction is on this\n\n01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:50.120\nOne of the reasons it's just not running buck wild and going crazy is because\n\n01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:58.320\nThe opposing force unified sort of interdiction on it is is strong. It's powerful Intel and and these\n\n01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:01.420\nHorses that are sitting there gramming a formation\n\n01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:07.520\nClosing down things letting you know when they've stopped somebody letting you know sometimes not letting you know when they have because it's\n\n01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:09.800\nbetter for the longer goal\n\n01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:12.840\nall that stuff is\n\n01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:19.000\nHappening outside of your sight unless they want you to see it so\n\n01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:27.300\nWhat we're seeing we are by virtue of being audience to this trying to attach a plot to it\n\n01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:32.200\nTrying to foresee an end game to it trying to attach all these sort of\n\n01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:40.140\nNarratives to it, but really what it is is just these sort of this pulse-like movement of let's probe in this case\n\n01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:42.660\nThere's a hole. Let's go get that\n\n01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:48.380\nThere's a hole that hasn't been exploited. Let's just wait. It's just wait. Let's just wait now\n\n01:33:48.380 --> 01:33:50.700\nLet's do it, but all these things are coming out all at the same time\n\n01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:54.320\nSo I think that on the one hand we are audience to this and\n\n01:33:55.020 --> 01:34:01.380\nWhat we're reacting to what with the tenant that the temperature of the water that we are feeling right now is real\n\n01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:06.100\nBut it's reactive to what we're being allowed to see what we're being allowed to read\n\n01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:09.340\nBut what's really going on is much more detailed much more specific\n\n01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:15.220\nAnd it's happening in pulses. It's a it's a very pointillistic thing and in each one of those cases\n\n01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:17.220\nThere's a whole inventory of stuff that's happening\n\n01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:22.740\nOutward incursions that are coming forward whether they're quiet incursions or more aggressive incursions and then also\n\n01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:27.860\nThe reportage and an interdiction that's going on around how much people actually know\n\n01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:31.180\nUnless you're in intelligence\n\n01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:34.140\nIt's really really really really really unclear\n\n01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:42.100\nAnd so this is why it is really important for people to see as much as they can read as much as they can and then use these\n\n01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:47.300\nSort of general principles of critical thinking so you know what your sources are what their biases may be and\n\n01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:52.620\nGetting multi-source information about one incident or one thing allows you to determine for yourself\n\n01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:55.260\nWhat you think the narrative is because for each person out there\n\n01:34:55.260 --> 01:35:00.700\nThere's a separate narrative of what is actually going on. I don't think that the sole goal is to\n\n01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:03.460\nto\n\n01:35:03.460 --> 01:35:08.780\nScatter publics that any sort of unified public certain here confidence that this is that we have\n\n01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:15.340\nCorey you talked about you don't think at least that when I think that's part of their meetings that they go like no big big big picture\n\n01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:19.140\nBecause I mean no, no, I do think that's part of it, but I think that there are other within that\n\n01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:21.900\nI think there are other more to specifically to sign defined\n\n01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:25.460\nMeasures and goals and there are things that are targeted\n\n01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:28.140\nThat's great. I mean, yeah, that's certainly\n\n01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:30.140\nTo I mean\n\n01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:33.460\nListen Frazier all I want to know is where the bad guys are\n\n01:35:34.740 --> 01:35:36.740\nNo, no, I\n\n01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:39.940\nLike that that advice from what I called of it is like yeah\n\n01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:44.100\nBe smart and like understand that they even the internet is mostly garbage and that\n\n01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:51.060\nEverything is a narrative and everything's being assembled and pre-processed and that and that and that I think maybe not to put words in your mouth\n\n01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:54.140\nBut like maybe I just did a little diatribe about how\n\n01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:58.020\nthe bad guys want everybody to hate each other and\n\n01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:03.900\nLike maybe adding to that also we're getting our news from good guys that don't necessarily\n\n01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:07.660\nLose money from us hating each other\n\n01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:10.500\nSo it's\n\n01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:18.380\nLike this country needs nothing more right now than a nice solid clean enemy with a logo\n\n01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:25.540\nLike and and and and you know, they've they're stepping up and we're going like I'll take the number five with cheese\n\n01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:32.020\nYou look at like like a good example is like I can't feel the guy saying but the former KGB agent who was was\n\n01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:34.940\nradiated\n\n01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:43.300\nThat means he that means he hasn't been listening for 20 minutes, that's that's what he does he picks one\n\n01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:50.260\nLooking at my he puts his glasses down. I was looking at the text that you've been sending me over the last oh come on\n\n01:36:51.220 --> 01:36:57.580\nAll right. All right. Hey you home. Yeah, give me a bit got a tend to some cat\n\n01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:03.220\nSchrabbing over no wait, bro. Come at 630, bro. You fucking idiot\n\n01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:12.660\nIt wasn't even clear who was saying what?\n\n01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:15.900\nYou were calling me a fucking idiot\n\n01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:31.980\nYou were coming over a half hour early in specify. No, you were saying Schrabbing over\n\n01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:44.300\nThe the the there's a geopolitical tinderbox underneath this right now\n\n01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:51.940\nPowder keg you guys could be talking about the Packers. I could I'm so I'm so I don't know my brain\n\n01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:54.060\nYou know\n\n01:37:54.060 --> 01:38:01.980\nI'm the definitely I'm the definitely the Gargamel in this situation.

Oh, yeah human testing lots of corporations do that shit, you know\n\n02:08:57.540 --> 02:09:02.540\nBut these are the ones that tend to vanish periodically along with the people in them.

Well, okay, then there you go\n\n02:09:12.180 --> 02:09:14.180\nThat's what I'm looking for\n\n02:09:14.300 --> 02:09:19.380\nWell those happen all over the place, you know, we got cyberware. There's all sorts of brain things\n\n02:09:19.380 --> 02:09:25.940\nThere's magic. There's all sorts of things that need human test subjects, you know, it's pretty common around here\n\n02:09:25.940 --> 02:09:27.940\nWe're specifically\n\n02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:34.860\nThese sort of mutated people the ghoulish people. Hmm. You understand.

Okay. Yeah\n\n02:10:26.140 --> 02:10:31.980\nWhite bands associated with this I don't know about no white bands, but if you're looking for ghouls\n\n02:10:31.980 --> 02:10:38.780\nThat's where the ghouls show up. That's where I'd steal some flesh from so would you could you get me that information and location?\n\n02:10:38.780 --> 02:10:46.380\nOh, yeah, I'll email it to you. Is that a round? Yes.

I have a makeup kit\n\n02:11:02.500 --> 02:11:07.500\nI'll start\n\n02:11:09.900 --> 02:11:12.740\nActually, it's not not a bad idea while he's doing that\n\n02:11:13.620 --> 02:11:15.620\nWe should call an uber\n\n02:11:15.900 --> 02:11:20.500\nWell, I think I'm assuming if we're gonna do a good job of this isn't actually farcical\n\n02:11:20.980 --> 02:11:22.980\nIt probably takes longer than an uber\n\n02:11:22.980 --> 02:11:28.460\nOh, it's me. I'm a ghoul\n\n02:11:32.820 --> 02:11:36.380\nAnd if y'all want to be dressed up like me\n\n02:11:42.780 --> 02:11:46.460\nWhat what what strange\n\n02:11:46.460 --> 02:11:53.620\ncultural environment resulted in you thinking that ghouls are southern bells\n\n02:11:56.100 --> 02:11:59.420\nSo I'd like to eat some brains right about now\n\n02:12:03.300 --> 02:12:07.580\nNo, it's just me gentlemen.
