00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comic, Harmontown is now in session.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Please keep those applause going for your Dungeon Master, Mr. Spencer Crittenden.

00:18.000 --> 00:31.000
See him scurry to his tail. That was good scurrying. Oh, that was a scamper.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
How you doing, Spencer? I'm good. Are you ready to bring out the mayor, Spencer? Yeah.

00:39.000 --> 00:54.000
Let's say it together. Dan Harmon. Thank you.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
Why do I come in from the back? At this point, it's kind of really dumb. There's a tripod in my way. It doesn't seem...

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
If we're going to do that, we need a jib camera that tracks you as you come in or a steady cam.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
We're tweaking the format here. I thought, let's bring Spencer up at the top of the show instead of saving him for dessert.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
I really mangled this guy's leg, too. Oh, really? What are you stepping on? Oh, by this guy? Stepped all over it.

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
Oh, wait. Oh, this guy? I'm glad I could help. I thought it was Anatoly. I was going to say, he deserves it.

01:30.000 --> 01:41.000
Because Anatoly, his feet touch the back wall. He sits in the front row and he puts his big Russian legs across the stage.

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
I would make a joke about Russian history, but they've always been invaded. It's like the stage was the Ukraine.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
And this back wall was the Black Sea.

01:54.000 --> 02:02.000
Yeah, see, that's the joke I would have made. I just kept thinking about Napoleon. I'm like, well, this is not going to work.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
Anyways, you remember Napoleon, right, Anatoly?

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
Is that a sore subject for Russians, the Napoleonic Wars?

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
Sure it is.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
You beat him. You kicked his butt. You sent him packing back home to France.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
Alright, let me see if this is working. Okay, great, this is working.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
Alright, so my Twitter notifications are on. I kind of panicked last time. They're on.

02:30.000 --> 02:41.000
But if you'd like to tweet at me, I won't yell at you. It should tap my wrist just a little bit and I can look and I can go, oh, good question.

02:41.000 --> 02:51.000
Alice and Brie is very nice. Something like that. So try not to abuse your power. Don't be smart, Alex.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
Actually, you in the audience, please just be in the room with us. Will you? Don't sit there and tweet at me.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
I'm talking to the people at home on the laptops.

03:03.000 --> 03:12.000
Is it happening? Has it already happened? Well, just give me one second.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Can we have it make a little noise?

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
There's two notifications. Hi, Dan. Sorry to be annoying. What will you be doing while Aaron is in Ireland?

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
I'll be playing Witcher 3.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Is she in Ireland right now?

03:26.000 --> 03:39.000
No, she's in St. Louis. Looking sexy tonight. Hashtag in the room. Okay.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
That was Spencer. That was totally Spencer.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
It's a dude. It's Huey.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
Alright, well, okay.

03:48.000 --> 03:56.000
Sports Corner, R.E. U.S. Open. A sports corner about the U.S. Open. Okay. Shall we?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Okay.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Alright.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Sports Corner!

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
Another one music. We need sports corner music. Hold up. Hold up.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
Also women's soccer, right? Women's World Cup.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Here we are.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
Sports Corner. Gotta hit the ball. Gotta make it go far in the seasons of the fall.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
Go in the summer and spring. Gotta do sports. Gotta do your thing. I like to jump real high.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
I like to go real low. I like to go across the ice. I like to go across the snow.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
Winter Olympics are done, but Sports Corner is still kind of fun.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Oh!

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Thank you.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
Thanks, guys. Thanks.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
I agree.

04:41.000 --> 04:48.000
Now, Dan, sadly, I missed the ending of the U.S. Open. Maybe you could tell us what happened.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
First of all, maybe you could tell us what sport it is.

04:52.000 --> 05:03.000
Well, I mean, the important thing is that it's American and it is open to everyone who plays the sport.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
There is no discrimination. That's the spirit of the U.S. Open.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
It's not private. You can just play. If you play, you just come and play.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Can women be in it, too?

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
If it's the women's U.S. Open, yeah.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
It's not.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
It's not. So no.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
But trans men...

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
What's your favorite thing about the sports that the U.S. Open was celebrating today?

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
Well, I mean, it's just, as you know...

05:39.000 --> 05:47.000
Like, everything comes down to where that ball is. Right?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Absolutely.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
So far, you're 100% right.

05:53.000 --> 06:00.000
And it's just like, the idea is to get the ball where it needs to be.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
Which is where specifically?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Well, you want to...

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
What's the destination for this particular ball?

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
I think the important thing is that you want to do a better job of getting it there than your opponent.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
Yes, yes.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
So we're done here.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
I think it's either tennis or golf.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
It's golf.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
Okay, it's golf. I knew that.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Who won the thing? Did anyone know?

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Teddy Rexman.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Teddy Rexman won?

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
The animatronic bear from our childhood?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Teddy Rexman won.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
That really is open.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
See? Anyone can do it.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Who won? Anyone know?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Jordan Spieth.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Jordan Spieth won.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
All right.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Jordan Spieth.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Spieth.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
What did you think, Dan, about the guy...

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
Is it Jason Day, who had vertigo a couple days ago, absolutely passed out,

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
because he has crazy vertigo, went down on the 16th hole,

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
managed to pull himself back together, finished the round,

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
and then he almost...

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
He was on the running the whole way through, wasn't he?

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
Our fans don't give a shit.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
Well, I don't know how many points overcoming vertigo should get you

07:14.000 --> 07:21.000
in a sport where you walk around and hit a ball when you feel like it.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
If I was a football player and I suffered from vertigo,

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
my doctor would tell me, why don't you try golfing?

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Go walk around on some grass until you feel better.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
So if, while you're doing that, you win a golf tournament,

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
I'm not going to go, plus, he's so special.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
He was here because he can't play football.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
How do you feel about the U.S. women's World Cup right now?

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
I mean, the women's World Cup all-inclusive, the whole world.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
The women's World Cup would be soccer.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Football, as we call it.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Those of us who are into soccer, we don't call it soccer.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
It's like calling San Francisco Frisco.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
I think it's great, Jeff.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Those ladies are out there.

08:02.000 --> 08:11.000
They're doing it just as good as ladies can.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Which might be better than men.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
You projected that on to me.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Spencer, are you following the World Cup?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
No. Are they playing?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Yes.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
The World Cup is playing against FIFA this week, aren't they?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Yeah, it's one of the weirdest matchups.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
The World Cup is playing FIFA.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
What country is FIFA that's Brazil versus the U.S.?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
It's going to be great.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
FIFA.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
All right.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Double sports corner.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
I love the World Women's World Cup.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
There was a woman playing today, and I'm just adolescent

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
and pure-wile and stupid enough to have enjoyed the fact

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
that there was a woman playing for Austria.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
His name was Dick and Men.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
Dick and Men on the back of everything.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
There's also a girl named Tamika Butt.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Yeah.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Butt.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
She did a good job.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
It's for Tamika Butt.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
All right.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
What happened to your glasses, says Anna Marie.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
You know, I don't know.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
I think they left them at the house.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
Are you afraid people aren't going to like you right now?

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Yeah, well, until Anna Marie brought it up,

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
I had forgotten about them.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Tell me you love me.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
I love you, Karimie.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Karimie?

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
Not since Tamika has a name been so chuckly.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Sorry, Karimie.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
It's just a weird name.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
I give a shit.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Okay.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
This is hard because the bird icon keeps coming up.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
I give a shit, says that guy.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
First time live streaming.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Okay, good luck.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
Kevin, see, it keeps.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Okay, every time someone sends one,

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
we'll have to, yeah, it's not going to work.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Every time someone sends one,

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
a big bird face comes up on the thing.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
I'm in the middle of reading one.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
It's not working.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
It's not, see?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
See what happens?

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
You can't disable the bird.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
I can't disable the bird.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
No, I can't disable the bird.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
There should be a bird disable function.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
There should be a lot of things.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
I found another Apple Watch bug today

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
with my Evernote app.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
If you write an Evernote

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
that is exactly as long as the Apple Watch's screen,

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
and then you add more,

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
it won't show it.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
But if you add five more things,

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
then it'll show everything.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
You can scroll it.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
But if you hit it right on the nugget,

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
bug.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
That's my bug report.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
All right, let's beep this shit up.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Let's talk about lesbians and race.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Okay.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
I don't really have anything.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
God damn it.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I can't get to my Evernote.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
People keep tweeting.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Okay.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
All right.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
This is better than the phone?

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
Shut up, Jeff.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I didn't mean that to be provocative.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
It would have been better than the phone

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
if I hadn't tried the Twitter experiment.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
I thought we could try the Twitter thing,

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
but it would be cool.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
We tried something, and you know what?

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
Do you know what the Four Agreements guy says?

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Did you read more of the book?

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
No, but this is something I still remember

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
from the first two agreements.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
We're only going off, you're reading a half hour.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
I'm one agreement in, and that's good enough.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
Did you know Jurassic World sucked 25 minutes through?

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Yes, you did.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
The Four Agreements are pretty good.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I'm one agreement in.

11:38.000 --> 11:44.000
The guy says, animals only pay for a mistake one time

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
in their whole life, one time for each mistake.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Humans are the only animal that pays a thousand times

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
for each mistake.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
That's the stupidest.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
Is that because animals die if they make a mistake?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
They get eaten?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
No, he's not being a Darwinist.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
He's saying animals just let it go.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Well, yeah, they let it go, yeah.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
No, they learn from their mistakes.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Yeah, they learn once.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
They learn the first time, so do we,

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
but then we pay for the same mistake a thousand times.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Oh my god, you guys, it's not that fucking weird.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Humans have anxiety.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
We fucking belabor our mistakes over and over again.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Raccoons don't.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
They make a mistake when they're getting your garbage

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
and their pockets hurt on the garbage can lid,

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
and they go like, ow, that hurt, done.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
They don't sit there three years later and go,

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
I'm such a fuck up.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
I'm such a fuck up.

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
Because they're brain to the size of ping pong balls

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
compared to it.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Well, we could learn a thing or two,

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
or unlearn a thing or two from a creature

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
with a brain the size of a ping pong ball.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
We can't learn anything from a ping pong ball

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
size brain.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
A parakeet sister impacts its unreflection,

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
I guess, in a big fight until the beak breaks.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
But then it learns, you know?

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
It doesn't make that mistake again.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Parakeets don't learn shit.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Fuck parakeets.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
I'm coming down hard on parakeets, you guys.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
I'm going to do what my therapist taught me to do.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
So that's the other thing.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
So we all, I have a shame button.

13:25.000 --> 13:41.000
Is it called your dick?

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
And can I push it?

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
It is my dick.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
It's called my shame button.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
I have a shame button, and it can get put.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Our buttons get pushed by other people,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
but it's not their fault.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
It's our deal, like your buttons get pushed,

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
and then you don't have to react to it.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
So if something makes you feel like a classic fight

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
that I would have with Erin, believe it or not,

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
would stem from like, if I take a nap and I wake up

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
and there's like six texts, she's going,

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
where are you?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
What's going on?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
What's happening?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Then I would have my shame button pushed

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
because I would be like, oh, I did something wrong

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
as a husband, because I didn't respond

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
to the first five texts.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Then I'd be like, why don't you calm down?

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
It's only been an hour, like trying to fix her?

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
Instead of just going like, phew.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
Hey baby, I was just taking a nap.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
This is breathing, it turns out, that's it.

14:37.000 --> 14:42.000
Seems like it was right under my nose.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Hey, you can even do it with your nose.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Yeah.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
I'm not going to let that get to me.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
The word play.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Anyways.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
I usually have to take a couple deep breaths.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Just one, not enough for me.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
No, it's not just, well, I mean,

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
it could be just one, like in a conversation,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
like if you were hanging out at a bar or something

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
and somebody like said something,

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
the minute you feel yourself,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
see the goal is, you got to keep your shamed tube

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
totally empty, like your nervous system, like...

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
I'm not going to look at him or...

15:15.000 --> 15:21.000
I don't even know.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
She never even said shamed tube, I just...

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
Did you just empty your shamed tube?

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
If you push my...

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
I'll be right back, I have to empty my shamed tube.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
The shamed tube will empty.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
You got to, like, your nervous system,

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
you know, so you go from zero to ten,

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
like, and I'm usually at a five,

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
which is bad because if I'm at a five

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
and somebody pushes my shamed button,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
I'm going to go to six and then right up to ten,

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
like, it's always been like a binary switch for me.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
But instead, four times a day, Jeff,

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
I'm supposed to take four deep breaths

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
out of four, four counts on an inhale

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
and four counts on the exhale,

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
four times, four times a day

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
for a total of 16 four-second breaths.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
And that's it, and now I'm going to be sane.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
It's going to work.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Have you done your breath today?

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
I didn't, today.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
I mean, Erin's out of town

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
and I was just playing video games.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
I was just playing video games all day.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
I don't need to breathe for that.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
It's like I'm getting mad at a dragon

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
or something and be like, fuck you.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
That's what you're supposed to do.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
It's what we call playing the game.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Could it be fucking hotter up here?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
It's very hot.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
Sorry, sorry.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Uh, I'm supposed to...

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Okay, look.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
All right, I'm supposed to tell people

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
six seasons in an Emmy.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
I'm supposed to, like, spread the word.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
It's really embarrassing.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
I don't want to ask for an Emmy.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
I'm not Seth MacFarlane.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
I just...

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
I don't know.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
I mean, if that's grown,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I mean, he literally did at one point.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
But I kind of don't blame him, I guess,

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
because at a certain point it's like,

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
what do you have to do?

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Ask for it?

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
I'm not going to ask for it,

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
but Yahoo deserves it

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
because they spent a lot of money

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
in an Emmy campaign.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
And they're the ones asking me to do it,

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
and I don't want to say no to them

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
based on some weird integrity I have.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
So I'm just saying, like,

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
I don't know how that helps.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
What is everybody going to run out

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
to the Emmy factory?

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
I don't understand.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
I don't...

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
I don't...

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
I thought you're supposed to get the...

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
have one if your show's good.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
I don't...

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
I don't like this...

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
I don't like life.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
I don't like this world!

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Is there a way...

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
are they hoping that...

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
that becomes a hashtag

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
or a trending thing?

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
That that will get...

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Yeah, and I guess it's...

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
I don't know what...

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
I don't know what...

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Did the Emmys respond to that?

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Is it that...

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
I don't know what the Emmys respond to.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
I don't know.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
I don't know.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
I had a...

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
I had a...

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
I had a...

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
I don't know if...

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
I don't know if Danny Poody

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
would appreciate me repeating the story,

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
but he said he was hanging out all night with...

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
he'd met a friend of a friend who was, like,

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
on, like, the Emmy committee or something,

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
and they were having a great time,

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
and they had dinner with their mutual friends,

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
and they're all hanging out,

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
and they had a big, long dinner,

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
and they're all joking around,

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
and getting along,

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
and then they went dancing afterward,

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
and they're out in the dance floor,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
and the person finally comes up to him

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
after talking to him all night,

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
and this is, like, it's like,

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
by the way, I just gotta ask you, like,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
what does it like to work with Amy Poehler?

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
Thought he was the Z's and sorry all night.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
All night.

18:19.000 --> 18:25.000
They thought he was a Z's and sorry all night.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
I think that's how the Emmys work for you.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
I don't know.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
I hear that story, and I go,

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
I don't think it's gonna happen for us.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Because isn't it really what it is

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
as it's voting for...

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Did you see Parks and Rec when the guy Emmys

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
when they thought it was Danny Poehler?

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
That's... I want a recount.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Everybody who's...

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
I want to know which brown guy

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
did you think you were voting for.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
I want everybody to follow up ballot.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
We have friends that are on TV

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
like do commercials,

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
and you go,

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
hey, I love your course like commercial,

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
and they go, it's Bud Light.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
And the thing is, like, people in advertising

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
know that Bud Light commercials

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
don't sell Bud Light in particular.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
They sell beer.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
A Toyota commercial doesn't necessarily

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
sell Toyotas, it sells cars.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
You are not gonna buy a Toyota

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
if you weren't already gonna buy a Toyota.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
If you were in the market for Mercedes-Benz

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
or a Chevy or whatever,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
car commercials remind you about cars.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Apparently Danny Poehler reminds them

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
about brown people.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
That's his job.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Alright, well anyways,

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I hate this fucking watch,

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
and I hate my life,

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
and I hate myself.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Are you a prisoner of the watch right now?

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Yes, I hate it.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
I hate the watch.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
I hate it.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
I hate the watch.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
It's a stupid product.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Don't buy it.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
It's dumb.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
It's a tiny little shitty iPad on your wrist.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
The Bluetooth sucks from your phone.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
It's supposed to...

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
It fucking doesn't work.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
It's dumb.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Do you have to have your phone on you

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
for the watch to have Bluetooth?

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Of course you do.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
It's garbage.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
It's a garbage product.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
That's pretty brave, man.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
What?

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
You're admitting, you know,

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
that you got it?

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
It was silly.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Well, I kind of...

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
I mean, I knew it would be.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
It's not that brave.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
I think it's very brave.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
You know...

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
How are these tweets?

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
I mean, all your tweets are dumb, too.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Is it the heat that's getting to your head?

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Yeah, it's really hot up here.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
I feel like it's dripping down my face.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
I feel like a pig.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
I've been very irritable the last couple of days.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
I don't know what it is.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
I think it is the heat.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
I don't like when it gets hot.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
The cops shot a guy at the eyeball

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
outside Schrab's place.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Yeah.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
I heard he was flagging the cops down

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
when they shot him?

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Yeah, he was asking for help.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
He said he needed help.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
He had a towel wrapped around his arm,

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
and the cops said there was a gun in the towel,

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
so they shot him in the eye,

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
and then handcuffed him.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
So they had to believe that he was saying,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
help me, help me while aiming a gun

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
with the intent to fire on them,

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
which is just an insane belief.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Godfather II style with the silencer.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
I guess they didn't want to...

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
I don't know what I mean.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Look, being a cop is a hard job,

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
and the guy did have a gun.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
He didn't.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
They turned out he didn't.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Okay, well, okay.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
That's fucked up.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
So they looked at the towel

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
and thought that's a gun?

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Yeah, I mean, here's the thing,

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
is that I smoke a lot of pot.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
I've seen people that turned out to be mailboxes.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
You know, the human brain can shift items

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
and make them look really crazy,

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
but you shouldn't like fire a weapon

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
before you make sure that you're seeing

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
what you're seeing,

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
because everyone's brain fucks up.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Yeah.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
On the flip side of that,

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
we never talked about that guy outside the...

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
that gallery.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
I can't even remember where it was now.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
It was in Austin, some place in Texas.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
They're having that dumb gallery

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
where they're having the draw-mahabit contest,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
and the guy showed up in the sedan,

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
and they had assault rifles,

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
and they were going to head into the gallery,

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
and there was one cop on duty outside the place,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
and they shot them both.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Yeah.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
It's like a weird Western story.

21:59.000 --> 22:05.000
He took them both out under a rain of assault rifle fire,

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
like shot them both dead.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
It's badass.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Yeah.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
And so he and the two guys were the only casualties, right?

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
We can be pretty sure that he probably saved

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
30 people's lives or so.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
I mean, at least, yeah.

22:19.000 --> 22:26.000
Well, I mean, sometimes cops shooting people is great.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
If they were about to shoot more people,

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
I don't know what the fuck to think about this cop stuff.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
I think it's so weird that our phones started

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
being able to pick up on this stuff,

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
but I don't think our phones got sophisticated

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
at the same time as cops started being crazy brutal.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
No, the underclass has cameras on them at all times,

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
and they get to film their friends being shot

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
in the back and shit.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
So it's been happening all the time.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
It's been going on forever and ever and ever.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
Now, the underclass and not rich people

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
have access to footage and shit.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
So I had a pinch, and you guys are going to go,

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
oh, this is stupid.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
You're stupid.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
You're dumb.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Oh, I like this one.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
I don't care.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Fuck you.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
It's your problem.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
You push that button.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
I don't care.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
You're made of smoke.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
I'm made of light.

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
I'm a quarter through the book,

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
and I'm reasonably certain I've got it.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Other people don't smoke?

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
If I say so.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
And they're glue.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Here's my pitch.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
So here's the problem is that the cops look like,

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
they look like enforcers.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
They're wearing black.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
They have guns on their hips.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
They go into these terrible situations.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
They never know what they're getting into.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
They're all jacked up.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
The people that they're visiting are not having their best day.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Never.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
You're never a cop talking to someone who's having a good day.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
They're always, like, all, you know,

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
everything is a fucking powder keg,

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
and everyone's got a gun.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
So here's my pitch.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
All right.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
So special branch of the police force

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
called the peacekeepers, okay?

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
Head to toe, white spandex.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
No weapons.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Cameras all over them.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
And, like, fingerprint sensors, too.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
Because the rule is if you touch one of them,

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
automatic lethal injection.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
Like, let alone if you shoot one or anything.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
I didn't think you were going to go in that direction.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
Well, it has to be backed up.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Like, the peacekeepers or white spandex

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
seemed a lot more laissez-faire than that.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
They are laissez-faire because if you touch one,

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
you are fucked.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Like, you're dead.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
You might as well...

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
I mean, there's problems with this pitch,

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
but we'll refine it.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
What if you're falling over and you accidentally, like,

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
you need help?

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
You're nitpicking the wrong thing

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
because I haven't finished my pitch.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
So the point is they have no gun.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
They have no gun.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
So when you see these guys, you know,

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
they don't have a gun.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
It's not their job to, like...

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
They don't even have handcuffs.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
It's not their job to shoot you

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
or arrest you or anything.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
It's their job to...

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
They have conflict training

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
and they get paid $700,000 a year

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
because they'll probably die within a week of...

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
But that's capitalism.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
It's like, hey, $700,000 a year

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
and you're probably going to die.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
And so whenever there's a police call,

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
they're the first ones in

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
and they come in and they go, hey,

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
take it easy.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
I'm a peacekeeper.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
What's going on?

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
I just want to know.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
I just want to help out.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
And they have to have that accent.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
I like this.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
And then, like...

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
But then again, if you...

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
To answer your question,

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
if you've fallen and accidentally touched them,

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
yeah, lethal injection.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
And I know you're going to ask,

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
well, wouldn't that give rise to a generation

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
that would murder people

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
by pushing them into peacekeepers?

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
I'm way ahead of you there.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
That was my next question.

26:05.000 --> 26:10.000
They're also going to be floating beholders.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Yeah.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
That watch in case that happens.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
So if that happens...

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
If that happens, poison darts

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
at the person that pushed.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
A floating beholder has poison darts?

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
Yeah.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
If you see those things coming...

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Raise of disintegration, sure.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
Poison darts, I don't know.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
It's not that beholder.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
It's named after them.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
They're just called beholders

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
and have poison darts.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
Yeah.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Okay, that explains...

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Is anyone else imagining Jim Rash

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
as a peacekeeper?

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
Yeah.

26:42.000 --> 26:47.000
Because that's who I keep thinking of.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
But somewhere in there

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
is the germ of a good idea.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Yeah.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Because the...

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
As you and I were discussing...

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
We were talking about this.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
The actual problem is that...

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Well, the way to break the cycle

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
is that the community think about...

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Think about police as being there

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
to actually help.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Every time you see them,

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
you're just like, oh, fuck.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
Unless you're...

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
Unless you're like...

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
I mean, if you're terrified

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
for your fucking life.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
Which also needs to be mentioned.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
Jesus Christ, man.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
As soon as you get the shit

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
scared out of you,

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
and sometimes when the cops show up

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
and they're nice,

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
and you're like, holy fuck.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
Thank God for the police.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
There was somebody I saw

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
that made a very interesting point

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
that they showed the picture

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
of an asshole that shot all the people

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
at the church in South Carolina.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
And he's got a bullet per vest on.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
He's being escorted very quietly

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
and casually to a car.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
And then a black guy down on the ground

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
for selling cigarettes

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
with three cops on top

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
and strangling him.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
That guy died.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
There's different ways of being arrested.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
And we treat the little white guy

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
that kills a bunch of fucking people

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
for no good reason.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
With a lot of respect

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
and a lot of courtesy

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
and a lot of care.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
It's absolutely crazy.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
What was with the bullet?

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Were people really afraid

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
he was going to get shot

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
like walking to the police car?

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Like Captain America

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
didn't get a bulletproof vest.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Oh, they put a vest on him?

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
Yeah, to walk him like in public.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Ostensibly because they don't want

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
him to die before we can find out

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
why he did it

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
and get the dope on him.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
But I don't think that happens

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
to black suspects.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
I don't think we get them

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
the bulletproof vest

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
and the perp walk

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
in front of all the media and shit.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
I find it pretty shitty.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
And the creepy ass judge,

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
you see that thing,

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
that little hearing

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
where he wanted the families

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
of the shooter

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
to make sure that we all knew

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
that they were victims too.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
That was a little cynical,

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
I thought, in front of...

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Wait, what?

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
I didn't get that.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
The families of the victims

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
were all allowed to make a comment.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Well, they put this guy

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
on a video arraignment

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
or whatever it was,

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
like a pretrial kind of thing.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
And the guy said,

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
let's not forget it

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
with the family of the shooter?

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Oh boy.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Boy.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
That's an unrelated case?

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Yeah.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
I don't know.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
I think I got where

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
he was coming from on that

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
when it was like,

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
believe me,

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
we're all victims

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
of a crime like this

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
and let's not all go crazy.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
I don't think anybody

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
was going to go crazy.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
I think that guy just wanted,

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
that judge just wanted

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
to be kind of a hot shot.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
He was on camera,

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
so he was going to have

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
a movie moment

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
where he made sure

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
the white family of this

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
white little fucking pecker

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
would cunt fucking,

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
was taken care of.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Yeah, I said pecker would cunt.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
And if that's not the name

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
of this episode of Harmonton,

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
I'm leaving.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
You're leaving,

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
you're leaving the show forever?

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
I'll never come back again.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Is it allowed to be this time?

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
And you put the C-word

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
in the title?

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
I don't think it did.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
I'm sure iTunes

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
has some algorithm.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Yeah, I mean, it's,

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
I don't know,

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
I don't want to pour

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
a bunch of white guilt kerosene

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
on that white guilt bonfire,

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
but like, Jesus Christ.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
I think the...

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
The thing that...

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
It's like a white guilt.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
The thing that...

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
He wasn't even white.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Yeah, he was Italian.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
And don't let Italians

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
convince you they're not white.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
A lot of them will try

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
to make you think they're not.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
They're not.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
That's the first thing

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
an Italian's going to try

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
to make you believe.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
That's right.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
But hey,

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
you got some problems

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
with your sink.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
By the way, I'm a white.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
No, Mario.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
No.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
You're Italian.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Go fight the oompa-looms

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
or whatever.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
That's your job.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
That's your ratio.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
That's your job.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
That's your racially designated job

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
is to kick turtles

30:43.000 --> 30:47.000
and blow fireballs out of your nose.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Sorry, it's some stereotypes are true.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Now, what I was going to say was that

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
it's like,

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
you think that bumps me out

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
when shit like that happens

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
is actually how, like,

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
how...

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
how used to it

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
the black community is?

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
I always project

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
onto when shit like this happens

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
where it's totally racially hot,

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
I always put myself

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
in the shoes of someone

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
that's part of this category

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
and affected by this,

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
and then always with

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
the African-American community,

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
it's just like,

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
that's the fucking saddest part of it,

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
is that they're not as mad

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
because they're just like,

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
what the fuck did you think

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
this world was?

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
Like when Kramer said the N-word on stage,

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
it was like, wow,

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
that's a big deal,

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
and they're like, no, it's not.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
And I'm like, oh, God, Jesus Christ,

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
it's just fucking...

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
And then this happened,

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
and it's like, there's no riots,

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
there's no...

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
This is not...

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
But let's say

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
black community got up

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
and got really pissed off

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
and started rioting, then what?

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Exactly, that's the thing is,

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
they, now I'm dehumanizing

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
by talking about they,

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
but I'm saying they,

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
that community knows

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
that that's the greatest thing

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
they could do for racism,

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
is to react,

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
and it's like this fucking horrible syndrome.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
It's like, we figured out

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Swiss army knives of oppression

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
because the butcher knife

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
stopped working in the 1800s,

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
so now we've got it down

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
to fucking corkscrews

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
and little can openers.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
That little asshole

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
said he wanted to try

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
to start a race war in America,

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
and I hope that he did

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
everything he could to make sure

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
that that never happens,

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
but actually the opposite happens from that.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
That even like anybody

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
that might have been on the racial fence

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
and that one is pushed

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
to the side of decency

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
and like, Jesus Christ.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
I think the only hope...

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
At times we gotta...

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
We gotta...

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
We gotta realize

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
that this whole thing is a dodge.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
All this race shit

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
is just a distraction

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
from the class warfare.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
It's just a...

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
All it is is just poor people.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
Their worst nightmare

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
is all poor people

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
feeling the same way

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
because then if there's that

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
and then there's also democracy,

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
then it's legal to overthrow.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
And as long as all the poor people

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
are like, you're a racist,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
you're a sexist, you're a pedophile.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
See, stop judging the pedophiles.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
I keep saying,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
let's join forces with them.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
You can't...

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
You can't pick your bedfellows

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
in a revolution.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
You know, we'll be...

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
We're gonna be storming the Capitol

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
and just when the sentinels

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
are like, blasting us with the...

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
the rays, we're gonna be like,

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
we're pinned down, I can't...

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
This is it.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
I'm sorry.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Black guy?

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
It's alright, white guy.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
At least we're gonna die as brothers.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
Yeah.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
Wait, did you hear that?

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Hootak, hootak!

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Look!

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Pedophiles!

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
Blank lift!

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
On my word!

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
Dive!

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
Dive!

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Dive!

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
Second wave!

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
Dive!

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
Dive!

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Wait, are the pedophiles played by Brian Blessed

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
from Flash Gordon?

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
The pedophiles are the Hawkman

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
from Flash Gordon, yeah.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Gordon tonight?

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
And he's 12?

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
And then the white guy and the black guy

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
look at each other and they go,

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
oh!

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
I don't know why you groaned at that.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
You were having a pretty good time

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
when the pedophiles were flying.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
I guess I gilded the lift.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
Really?

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
You made it too real all of a sudden.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
I guess because the protagonist

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
signed off on it, is that what it was?

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
Okay.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Alright.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Let's just random one of your tweets.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
I just...

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
I like flying pedophiles a lot.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
Can't that be the title?

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Fly Pedophiles.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Pedophiles!

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
Dive!

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
Pedophiles!

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
Pedophiles!

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
Dive!

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
I got a red Flash Gordon again.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
That would be so good.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Dan, can you validate me?

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
No, I can't because these fucking tweets

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
keep coming in.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Sorry, whoever that was, you're validated.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
Is that a parking thing?

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
What else was I going to talk about?

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
Oh, hey Spencer.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
Hey.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
How's your...

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Are you twitching now?

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Oh yeah, I'm twitching.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
Spencer's twitching.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
I really got to get it looked at.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Is that a new dance move?

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
Oh yeah.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Spencer got us equipment.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
I haven't hooked mine up, but...

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
so that we could show people our Minecraft worlds,

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
like on YouTube and whatnot, or...

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Yeah.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
Or Twitch.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
Or on Twitch.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
On Twitch.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
And so the Twitch puts it on the YouTubes?

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
You do that yourself, actually.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
It's not...

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
So Twitch is a thing.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
It's like YouTube for video games and live.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
It's the weirdest social phenomenon in the world.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
So you can stream your video game play?

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
Yeah.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
And people are positively...

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
It's actually working.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
People like to watch other people play video games.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
I would have never predicted that.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
And they tip them and stuff?

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
It's...

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
I mean, I don't know.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
They tip you?

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
I feel the same thing about sports though, right?

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
It's like...

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Why are people watching people play sports?

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Well, that's...

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
Yeah, I mean...

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
Yeah, but...

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Yeah, I don't...

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
I think it's probably that same human impulse, probably.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
I don't know.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
But yeah, the thing I can't...

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
But yeah...

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
Okay.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
It's a lot of fun.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Spencer, do you watch other people twitching?

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
No, I think that's hilariously dumb.

36:41.000 --> 36:46.000
So, I mean, not if you're watching me, of course.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
That's the best thing you could do.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
But you put your stuff out there and do you have a following now?

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
I mean, there's four or five people, yeah.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
I don't do it for them.

36:54.000 --> 37:00.000
I do it to feel like I'm wasting less time when I'm wasting time.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Because now you've become entertainment for other people.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
I mean, yeah.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Now it's actually doing something.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
It's not just going into the past.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
So people sit and watch you in Minecraft and you're moving little blocks around?

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Yeah.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
And sometimes I'm singing.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
I'll sit and watch for hours.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
I'll watch Minecraft tutorials and stuff.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
Because there's just so many mods and then people...

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
I'll go like, how the fuck do these wires work or whatever?

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
And then some guy will have a thing.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
It goes like, hello, I'm Mr. Pasty Pets.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
I'm going to show you how wires work.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
Oh, look over here.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
You see, I've put a one-way switch.

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
You have to put it at the top of the block and never put it facing the north or it won't work.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
I mean, I don't know why that is.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
I've sent a blood report to the author.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Yeah, so anyways.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
They do characters and stuff.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
But they show you how shit works.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
Is that what you do?

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Are you showing people how you...

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
No, I'm just fucking...

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
I'm just playing it.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
I'm just playing it and people ask me questions and I answer their questions.

37:50.000 --> 37:54.000
Is it like a weird sort of voyeurism where they're watching Spencer's mind at work?

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
I mean, I guess.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
I don't know.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Well, like I said, I think it's the sports thing.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
Anybody here follow somebody else?

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
You in the front row?

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
You watch people twitching?

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Long time to twitch, yeah.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
Really?

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Yeah.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
If you're sitting at work and you can't play but you want to watch a game.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
So which games do you watch?

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
I watch League of Legends.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
I watch Minecraft sometimes.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Hearthstone, Lopla, Hearthstone.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
You watch people play Hearthstone?

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
Yeah.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
Hearthstone is like...

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
It's a hard game.

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
It's a hard game and you watch strangers play it against each other.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
Well, you watch the stranger playing against somebody.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
Uh-huh.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
Wait.

38:29.000 --> 38:34.000
It might be a stranger or they might be playing someone you know.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Oh, okay.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
All right.

38:37.000 --> 38:41.000
I'm fascinated by the fact that it's like...

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Does that kind of scratch the same image for you?

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
What's your name, by the way?

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
Scala.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
We'll grab a mic real quick.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Oh, that means I get to sit down.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
Scala, come on up.

38:51.000 --> 38:56.000
Scala be twitching.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Have you or do you ever watch sports?

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
God, no.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
Huh?

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
God, no.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
So you don't watch a baseball game?

39:03.000 --> 39:07.000
Do you think that scratch is the same sort of itch that somebody who likes football?

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
I would assume so.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Yeah.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
It's a spectator sport.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
Yeah.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Yeah.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
I'm sorry.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
I want there to be more here.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
No, I can't figure it.

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
I mean, I've had Superman explain to me and I get it now.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
That's a lot of pressure.

39:22.000 --> 39:27.000
But the thing I haven't done is I haven't gotten on Twitch and actually tried this.

39:27.000 --> 39:32.000
But Spencer, when you're twitching, as the kids call it...

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
And you're doing exclusively Minecraft.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Are you talking to people?

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
Yeah.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
So like there's a chat room and I see it on my phone.

39:39.000 --> 39:43.000
So people are like, oh, what color is your house going to be?

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
And then I'll be all like, I don't know, maybe red.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
And they're like, I'd like blue.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
And then I'd be like, okay.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
You know.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
So and I think there is some, I don't know.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
I think people get something from the interaction.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
And also I think it's kind of like podcasting where it's like you're interacting with this

39:59.000 --> 40:04.000
person kind of in this very limited sense where you're sort of exposing yourself to them.

40:04.000 --> 40:09.000
It's very easy, but very distant and controlled interaction.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
It's a community.

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
Like it's just like the show is really people watching the podcast through the streaming

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
and stuff like that.

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
But with like now that I know that Spencer is a Twitch, I'll totally watch Spencer play Minecraft.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
Yay.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
Well, I would too.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Can I watch you watch Spencer play Minecraft?

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
That's going to be the new thing.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
We could do Twitchception.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
I want to be in the room.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
I want to be physically in the room while you watch it.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
Sure.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
Oh, I want to stand there in white spandex.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
But I can't touch you.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
I can't touch you.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
You're fucking dead, Jack.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
You'd be dead.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
I really wanted this to happen where I could touch you, but.

40:41.000 --> 40:45.000
All right.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
You can touch my floating beholders.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
Oh, all right.

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
With their disintegration rays on their anti-magic fields.

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
It's an important aspect of anti-magic fields.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
It's the scariest part.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
Don't forget.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
You lose all your bonuses.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
It's terrible.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
Yeah.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
All right.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
So what do you play when you play?

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
You play Hearthstone.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
You play the things you watch?

41:10.000 --> 41:15.000
The last time I streamed Twitch, where I was producing Twitch that people could watch,

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
I played a game called Magica 2.

41:17.000 --> 41:22.000
And it's where four wizards cast spells cooperatively where your spells can hit each other.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
So you blow each other up and yell at each other a lot.

41:25.000 --> 41:30.000
So we just went through the whole game in one sitting, but all yelling at each other on

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
a couch.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
We got the cops called on us.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
It was really good experience.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Damn.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
It was fucking rager.

41:35.000 --> 41:42.000
I understand the idea of like, I would, if I had time, I would want to, that's why I

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
asked you to look into getting this stuff.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
Because I wanted to be one of these guys who has like a YouTube video.

41:47.000 --> 41:52.000
But like, I wanted to have control over, like I want to go, hello, it's me, Dan.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
Snakebite69 or whatever.

41:55.000 --> 42:00.000
I just wanted to show you my automatic irrigation system or something over here.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
So you don't want to stream.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
You want to produce content that you have edited and then voiced over.

42:04.000 --> 42:09.000
I'm nervous about the idea of people watching me in real time because if I'm playing Minecraft,

42:09.000 --> 42:14.000
like, and I stack up some blocks and then I'm just like sitting there.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
Oh, yeah.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
Someone's watching.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
No, it's a nightmare.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
You, I'm just going to be the guy that took this.

42:19.000 --> 42:23.000
On your screen, you're seeing people comment like, bad block placement.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
All you quit watering the plants, you dick.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
Are you?

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
No, no, no.

42:30.000 --> 42:34.000
I would say that you playing Minecraft and having a community watching you and like

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
messaging you like, oh, you should go over there.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
That looks like there's goats or something.

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
Like it probably way more interesting than watching you look at your phone in front of

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
a mic or look at your watch.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
Check Twitter.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
All right.

42:45.000 --> 42:49.000
Oh, shit.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
Take a deep breath.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
Take a deep breath.

42:53.000 --> 42:57.000
It's it's a lady sitting up here speaking to one of my heroes criticizing him looking

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
at his Twitter.

42:58.000 --> 43:04.000
Like, like that's what I'm saying.

43:04.000 --> 43:10.000
I'm just checking my tweets because I'm excited for my tweet hate mail.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
I'm excited for that.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
No, it's fine.

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
Look, if you're like, look, it's a bad show and it's not a bad show.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
That's not what I'm saying.

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
I think you took the wrong thing out of what I was trying to say.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
I'm saying that this is a I'm saying that this is a beautiful thing that people care

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
about and can watch and still enjoy.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
And Minecraft can be that also.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
Oh, right.

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
Well, yeah, I mean, but I but there's no wrong.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
There's no wrong way to do it.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
That's what I'm trying to say.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
It's like a Reese's.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
Yeah.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
There's no.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
There's no wrong way to eat a Reese's.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
Thank you, Spencer.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
Thank you.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
You're welcome.

43:46.000 --> 43:52.000
There's probably a wrong way to eat it.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
Forget to unwrap it first.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
That's the wrong way to do it.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
No, that's fine.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
That's fine.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
This guy says snake bite 69 should be the name of the title.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
I don't know.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
No, pedophiles.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
Fuck you, buddy.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
Fuck you.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
I like this.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
I like this voting on the title with the audience.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Snake bite 69.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
It's just the the difficult thing is every time they said, OK,

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
someone said, don't give up.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
OK.

44:14.000 --> 44:21.000
Oh, but I but I think they I think they meant on race race relations

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
because it was eight eight minutes ago.

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
Maybe it was like, don't give up on white people.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Don't give up on your peacekeepers pitch.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
Yeah.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
Well, somebody I'm terrified of your peacekeeping.

44:33.000 --> 44:37.000
Yeah, because they're going to get cocky and arrogant and they're going to be like,

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
why don't you touch me, bro?

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
And they'll like be forcing you up against the corner.

44:42.000 --> 44:47.000
If two people walked in right now, let's say it's a man and a woman and their peacekeepers

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
and they're wearing white spandex, we'd all fucking be bummed out because you're like,

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
like, what if you touched them and you'd be dead?

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
You don't know what's going on.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
Well, that's because that's that's your signal.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Everybody fucking cool it, man.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
Yeah, but that's horrifying.

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
Well, yeah, but they don't have guns and they don't have handcuffs.

45:01.000 --> 45:06.000
It's horrifying the way if like if an angel came down, like it doesn't.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
It doesn't.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
It's not.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
It's potentially very horrifying.

45:09.000 --> 45:13.000
It's it's it's it's disruptive and it's and it's put hits the reset button.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
Oh, shit.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
Fucking the fucking.

45:15.000 --> 45:19.000
What is the vetting system for becoming a PC heavy?

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
You have to be willing to get killed on the first week of work.

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
You have the ability to run through a crowd and kill 30 people.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
All right.

45:26.000 --> 45:33.000
Well, no, no, the vetting system is you have to have had six years of of of of conflict

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
resolution training.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
Okay.

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
You have to have a liberal arts degree.

45:39.000 --> 45:49.000
You have to know Tai Chi just only to balance your your soul or or Chi.

45:49.000 --> 45:56.000
In light not to hurt people just to just to just to be calm when people are killing you

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
because you're going to die.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
But then over time, what's that?

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
If you touch an opportunity, that doesn't matter.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
They wouldn't be wearing their spandex.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
Well, is that true?

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
If you he says if you kill an off duty cop, there's a higher penalty.

46:13.000 --> 46:17.000
Well, I guess I guess given what yeah, I guess we're not shocked.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
We got to go back.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
I mean, we got to work.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
It's a good idea.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
We just got to work out the kinks.

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
I think they should be robots.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
That's what we need.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
We need those chappy robots.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
Yeah.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
But I don't think that would calm anybody down.

46:33.000 --> 46:37.000
They wouldn't like well, they probably would.

46:37.000 --> 46:41.000
You know, recognize weapons and stuff.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
British British.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
Yeah, yeah.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
He's saying the British Bobby doesn't carry a fire.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
Oh, right.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
But don't they kind of do now?

46:49.000 --> 46:55.000
Aren't there some?

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
But they'll beat the shit out of you.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Like it's fine.

46:59.000 --> 47:03.000
But they're more famous in Europe and the UK.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
The shit out of people.

47:05.000 --> 47:09.000
For like actually like casually disarming people and like talking it out.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
Oh, it's amazing, man.

47:10.000 --> 47:14.000
I saw a video of a guy with a machete who was swinging a machete around.

47:14.000 --> 47:17.000
They just kept bringing more cops and some guy hit him with a chair.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
No one.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
No, no, no guns got fired.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
No one got hurt.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
Like the guy got arrested.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
It was awesome.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Police.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
It can be done.

47:28.000 --> 47:34.000
I tell you that when we were there for Hogmany in Scotland and I bumped into a cop.

47:34.000 --> 47:39.000
And it was like New Year's Eve and everyone's drunk and I bumped into a cop.

47:39.000 --> 47:45.000
And the cop went, oh, excuse me.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
I think I ran around a corner and puked.

47:48.000 --> 47:52.000
I was just like so nervous.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
I was like, I can't believe that just happened.

47:54.000 --> 47:58.000
Our first night in Edinburgh, you guys had checked into our little apartment there.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
And Kate and I were parking a car and getting luggage out of the car.

48:00.000 --> 48:05.000
And we parked right underneath like literally like the street below the Edinburgh Castle.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Like in the shadow of the big castle there.

48:07.000 --> 48:14.000
And we parked on the road and the meters, you have to go to a little kiosk, get a receipt, put it in your car.

48:14.000 --> 48:18.000
You can buy a bunch of time on it, but what you can't do is feed the meter.

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
Like you can't go back in the middle of the night and add more time on that.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
You have to actually move your car or whatever.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
It's a pretty good system, I guess, except we didn't have any.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
You have to put coins and you can't put a card in.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
So we didn't have any.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
So we walked up to a cafe to get some money.

48:32.000 --> 48:36.000
And the time that we did that, because we had to buy something, we came back, we're getting a ticket.

48:36.000 --> 48:41.000
Now in Los Angeles, I don't know about living in other parts of the country, the US,

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
the moment they're out of the car, you're getting a ticket.

48:43.000 --> 48:48.000
The moment they start typing your license in, you have a ticket whether you drive off in a fury.

48:48.000 --> 48:52.000
There was this cop there and he's writing this up and Kate's like, oh no, no, no, no, no.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
And she's, you know, she's Scottish.

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
So she was like talking to him in the Scottish falsetto because they all talk in a falsetto.

48:57.000 --> 49:00.000
Like, oh, no, no, no, no.

49:00.000 --> 49:04.000
And the guy just put his little computer thing in his pocket and walked away.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
And she's like, do we have a ticket?

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
He's like, no, on you go.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
And she's like, really?

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
And she's like, yeah, sorry, on you go.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Put your money in there and go.

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
And so she does that and I'm like getting stuff out of the car.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
And the cop was doing his thing and looking around in other cars and he walks by.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
And it's like, it's just after Christmas, right?

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
Or maybe it was just Christmas when we were there.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
And I said, thank you very much, by the way.

49:27.000 --> 49:32.000
I'm from Los Angeles where if someone starts writing you a ticket, you have a ticket.

49:32.000 --> 49:37.000
And he goes, yeah, but we're nice here.

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
Merry Christmas.

49:40.000 --> 49:47.000
And then the Lactis Master came out and just fucking ate him.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
And you were like, what?

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
And then it pulled back and you were outside like this lab.

49:53.000 --> 49:58.000
What?

49:58.000 --> 50:03.000
I was just punching it up and had third act problems.

50:03.000 --> 50:07.000
Is Darsan, are you here?

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
Darsan?

50:08.000 --> 50:12.000
Oh, did I slightly pronounce one vowel wrong?

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
Wow.

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
Darsan?

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
Do you want to come up here?

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Do you want to chat?

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
No, you're staying.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
What's your name, Twitch lover?

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
Skyler.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
Skyler.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
That's a pretty name.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Darsan, everybody.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
Darsan!

50:32.000 --> 50:40.000
Community fans may know Darsan as Black Dave from season five who rose to prominence in season six.

50:40.000 --> 50:47.000
They came down to you and Vicky and what's his name?

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
The guy that made out with my wife.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
Garrett.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
Garrett.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
Yeah, because we lost Neil.

50:54.000 --> 51:00.000
And then we call you guys our Muppets because you're not regulars.

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
You're kind of like, but you're not background and you're not guest stars.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
You're kind of like always there.

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
Muppets.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
Muppets.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
Yeah, Muppets.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
Dehumanizing.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
I'll take it.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Yeah, it's better than Black Dave.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Better than Black Dave.

51:13.000 --> 51:17.000
It's just still somewhat dehumanizing, but I guess Muppets is less dehumanizing.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
Yeah, no.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Muppets and Black Dave, they're both neat.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
Come on.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
No.

51:22.000 --> 51:27.000
They're both neat.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
You're Jewish though, right?

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
Yeah, I am.

51:31.000 --> 51:37.000
You're sorry you were telling me in the green room, your mom's Jewish, your dad's...

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
Yeah, my mom's Jewish, my dad's, he's Black.

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
And he was like...

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
Your dad was like a rambling man, right?

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
If there's anything you don't want to talk about, you don't have to talk about it.

51:49.000 --> 51:55.000
Okay, so basically I was telling my dad that my dad's from Trinidad and he came from when

51:55.000 --> 52:00.000
it was still owned by Britain, so he kind of came out with a British accent because

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
for whatever reason he thought that actually talking like you were from Trinidad was really

52:04.000 --> 52:08.000
improper and all his family is like what the fuck you're crazy and they all talk with

52:08.000 --> 52:14.000
a Caribbean accent, so it's more like we might be out somewhere and because Black people

52:14.000 --> 52:20.000
say hi to other Black people, it's like that's a thing.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
So somebody would see him.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
If you walk in the street, is he another Black guy?

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Yeah, we'd just be like, sup.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
Right.

52:27.000 --> 52:31.000
Is that just a courtesy thing or is that a cultural thing?

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
I honestly don't know, I just have accepted it.

52:34.000 --> 52:39.000
You guys better not be up to something.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
Jeff, it's 9-11.

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
It's a code, is it?

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
9-11.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
9-11.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
It's 9-11.

52:47.000 --> 52:57.000
Black people are up to something!

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
Don't ever forget these numbers.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
These numbers are so important.

53:05.000 --> 53:13.000
They make the difference between good and bad.

53:13.000 --> 53:18.000
Don't ever forget these numbers.

53:18.000 --> 53:26.000
These numbers will make the difference when you go to bed at night and pray.

53:26.000 --> 53:30.000
Tweet, tweet, boop, boop, take a deep breath, stretch.

53:30.000 --> 53:37.000
9-11 is going to be the number I remember.

53:37.000 --> 53:43.000
9-11 is going to live forever in my mind.

53:43.000 --> 53:47.000
Chee, chee, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop!

53:47.000 --> 53:57.000
Wow!

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Pedophiles dive!

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
Pedophiles dive!

54:02.000 --> 54:06.000
I'm glad you cut it off because I was about...

54:06.000 --> 54:11.000
Osama Bin Laden was about to do a rap break.

54:11.000 --> 54:16.000
No, no, no, no.

54:16.000 --> 54:23.000
Give the people what they want, dad.

54:23.000 --> 54:31.000
My name's Osama Bin Laden.

54:31.000 --> 54:36.000
My name's Osama Bin Laden.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
Everybody!

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
One, two, three, come on, come on.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
My name's Osama Bin Laden.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
I don't eat salad, I eat ramen.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
I live in a cave.

54:46.000 --> 54:53.000
I'm all the rage till you got me with your zero dark 30 by whispering my name.

54:53.000 --> 54:57.000
Toot, toot, beep, beep, night vision.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
You whispered my name.

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
I thought you were a little girl in trouble,

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
walked into the doorway and got shot in the face.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
I deserved it.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
I deserved it.

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, I deserved it.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
My name's Osama Bin Laden.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
My name is Osama.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
I've come to see your power.

55:17.000 --> 55:22.000
He owes me five dollars from when I bode his law.

55:22.000 --> 55:27.000
Last week, I have a funny hat.

55:27.000 --> 55:33.000
My God is funny too.

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
My name's Osama Bin Laden.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Wait, can I explain what I meant?

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
My name's Osama Bin Laden.

55:40.000 --> 55:43.000
Too late, too late.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Listen, no.

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
I meant my version of it.

55:48.000 --> 55:52.000
The extreme version.

55:52.000 --> 55:55.000
Whoa, my name is Osama.

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
I think it's hot in here.

55:58.000 --> 56:03.000
I'm gonna go in my car and drive around and get a beer.

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
Can I have a beer?

56:04.000 --> 56:07.000
No, that's illegal here.

56:07.000 --> 56:11.000
Gonna park my car and get out and get a beer.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
My name's Osama.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
I live on your fear.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
And you, Lloyd Webber, wrote this song.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
I am.

56:20.000 --> 56:37.000
I didn't mean the Islamic God was funny.

56:37.000 --> 56:42.000
Osama Bin Laden, Andrew Lloyd Webber, collaboration.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
I like that in the end, he was gonna, yeah, he was gonna,

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
I live on your fear.

56:47.000 --> 56:50.000
I stopped it too soon, man.

56:50.000 --> 56:51.000
Well, I don't know.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
I don't think I had it in me.

56:53.000 --> 56:58.000
We opened in two nights, you guys.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Look, I mean, there's a lot of feelings around.

57:00.000 --> 57:09.000
You came down pretty hard on Islam, there, Dan.

57:09.000 --> 57:12.000
That's a pretty bold stance on this day in it.

57:12.000 --> 57:15.000
I said his God was funny.

57:15.000 --> 57:20.000
I meant, I meant to God that cares so much that he would,

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
that he would ask you to hurt people.

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
Seems silly.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
That made it worse.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
What?

57:29.000 --> 57:36.000
Drink your weird low and brow 40 ounce.

57:36.000 --> 57:40.000
If you don't make eye contact with me, I can't see you.

57:40.000 --> 57:47.000
He was like, that made it worse.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
All right, shit rolls downhill.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Thank you for helping me.

57:51.000 --> 57:55.000
So anyways, Jewish mom, black dad, tell me more.

57:55.000 --> 57:59.000
What was Thanksgiving like at that house?

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
I think it went a little something like this.

58:02.000 --> 58:08.000
Hey, is this a jive turkey?

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Let me be right back.

58:10.000 --> 58:17.000
Oy vey!

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
You know, if that was actually how my Thanksgiving's were,

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
I would actually have loved my Thanksgiving's.

58:22.000 --> 58:26.000
Because guys from Trinidad always talk about jive turkeys, right?

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Yeah, they always talk about jive turkeys.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
All right, so, all right.

58:30.000 --> 58:35.000
How do you know when a turkey is a jive turkey?

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
You have to look at the legs.

58:38.000 --> 58:42.000
All right, we're going to play this right this time.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Are you okay, Skyler?

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
I'm amazing.

58:45.000 --> 58:46.000
Okay, great.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
If you get uncomfortable, let me know.

58:48.000 --> 58:52.000
I know it's hot up here and I don't know what I'm doing.

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000
It's a bad show.

58:53.000 --> 58:56.000
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
I don't want you to come away with that.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
I won't stand for that.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.000
It's an amazing show.

59:00.000 --> 59:01.000
Oh, thank you, Skyler.

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
Thank you.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
I wasn't fishing for that.

59:03.000 --> 59:12.000
Yeah, but this guy watches Minecraft at home.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
He's our barometer?

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
What's entertaining?

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Is that helpful?

59:18.000 --> 59:22.000
If you knew what Hearthstone looked like.

59:22.000 --> 59:26.000
Have you been to grassgrow.com?

59:26.000 --> 59:31.000
You get to watch real-time grass growing.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Paintdryers.org.

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
What exactly does Hearthstone look like?

59:36.000 --> 59:41.000
It looks like colored rectangles bumping into each other.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
With explosions and animations and noises.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
Yeah, it's got a lot of noises.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
It's a card game.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Each card is a digital card game.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
People watch World Series of Poker.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Yeah, I don't get it either.

59:53.000 --> 59:56.000
The rectangles don't even bump into each other.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
People watch Prairie Home Companion.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
People watch this show.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
People watch Community for Six Seasons.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
But those are like...

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Thank you.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Thank you.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Thank you.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Four and a half.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
And an Emmy.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Don't forget.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Tell everybody...

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Tell Yahoo!

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I told everybody to say we deserve an Emmy.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Tell them Seth MacFarlane sent you.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Enter the code, Seth MacFarlane.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Yeah, they had a campaign a while back that was like,

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000
hey, have you noticed Family Guy hasn't gotten an Emmy yet?

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
I actually got those screeners.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
It was just kind of passive-aggressively saying to all the voters,

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
yeah, we make you laugh and you don't vote for us.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Suck our dicks, watch this episode.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
And did they win one then?

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
I don't recall.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000
The most blatant one was when the Simpsons Family Guy crossover

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
where Homer's throwing Emmys at Peter and Peter goes,

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
hey, no fair, we ain't got none of those.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
So that was kind of the most blatant please vote for us.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Yeah.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
I don't know how the Emmys worked,

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
but I think it comes down to other writers having to like me,

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000
which I think is like, there's no way that's ever going to happen.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Which Emmys do you think you'd be most likely to be nominated for?

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Well, I always thought that maybe our actors would eventually get

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000
at least nominated.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I thought that, you know, a while ago that,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
like Danny Pooty and...

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
There was never a nomination?

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
No, never, never.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I'm not bitter, I don't care.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
I mean, you know, whatever.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Everyone has an Emmy.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Do you think that the Emmy committee is a little,

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
like a little hesitant to nominate somebody

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
who has come down so hard against Islam?

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Because that seems justified.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
That seems justified.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I think having a funny God isn't coming down on the religion.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
I think God should encompass all.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Skyler, don't coddle it.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
We know what he meant.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I appreciate it, Skyler.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I mean, I just want people to be happy.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.000
If I were a God, I would...

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Be a lot like Hitler.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
But not in a bad way.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Right.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
The good parts of Hitler.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Was it clear what I was trying to say at that point?

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
No.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:20.000
I was saying, God and Hitler have...

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
We all have that in common with Hitler.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
What?

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Everything.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
The universe has that in common with Hitler.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Self-loathing?

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Yes.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Disatisfaction with the status quo.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
There was nothing.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
The universe was nothingness,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
and then it exploded into everythingness.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
So that means that the nothingness,

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
which must have been God,

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
otherwise, if something pre-existed God,

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
which nothingness would have,

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
then God wouldn't be God.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
So nothingness must also be God,

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
which means that God's origin must be nothing,

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000
which means that God was dissatisfied with his own state.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
So he split up and expanded into everything.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
He didn't like being nothing,

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
just as Hitler didn't like just being the mayor of Berlin,

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
or whatever he started us.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:09.000
He was never the mayor of Berlin.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Hitler was the mayor of Berlin?

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Never should have...

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
No one ever talked about that.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Why did they elect this guy mayor?

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
He was saying, like, if I'm mayor,

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
I will kill all the Jews,

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
and then everyone was like,

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
well, I'm voting for him

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
because he won't have that power as mayor,

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
but he stands on those potholes outside my house.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Like, he's the only guy

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
to keep the trains running out of time.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Okay, so...

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000
You're probably like,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
I'm sure he's just misunderstood.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
I mean, everybody's mad these days.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
It's 1936.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Maybe he should be mayor.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
When Margaret...

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
I was just going off about the Jews the other day.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Yes, you were.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Yes, you were.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
And we're Jewish.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
He's got my vote.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Mayor of Berlin.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Lever.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
They voted with slot machines.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I'm glad we took that time

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
for you to clear that up for us, Dan.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I didn't say...

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Well, I think it's silly that you can't say

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
that technically God and Hitler

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
had that one thing in common.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
I just don't know.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I mean, for me, I don't know if it was sufficiently clear

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
that what you were talking about was self-loathing.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
So...

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Well, self-loathing is, yeah,

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
you hate what you are.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
I mean, I get it now.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Yeah, now you get it.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I don't get the impression that Hitler hated who he was.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I think he hated what he felt had been...

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
had been done to him and his country.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Well, I think...

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Well, I'm thinking as opposed to being content.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
He doesn't seem like a content guy.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
No, I don't think contentment

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
was a real thing after World War I.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
I think Germany was pretty bummed out about that.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Oh, it was called The Great Depression.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Hello!

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
That was gold.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I love it.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Sorry, it just presented itself.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I had to grab it.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Now, so...

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Darsan?

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Yeah.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Just don't say Darsan.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Darsan.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Your mom's Jewish?

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Yes.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Does that make you officially Jewish?

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
It does.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
I'm a Black Jew.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Are you practicing?

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Do you go to temple and whatnot?

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
I did it until my bar mitzvah and I cashed out

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
and I was like, okay, I'm good.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
That's pretty Jewish.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
That's pretty Jewish.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Is that basically like the path of a...

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
That's like where your typical kind of secular Jew,

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
like gets to the...

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Because that's like a Christian confirmation, right?

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
It's like, you...

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000
When you're a kid, like, you're raised in the faith

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
and then it kind of culminates in the bar mitzvah

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
and then you can't, as you say, cash out and...

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
It's kind of...

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
I was more raised for reform where it was basically

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
and my parents and I kind of decided that temple was really boring.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
So we didn't go, but they like sent me to Jewish camp,

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
which I learned all my dirty humor

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
because I was the only Black person there.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
And then...

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
So I came back and then the bar mitzvah still seemed like a good idea.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Do you have a good Jewish joke for us from Jewish camp?

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
My God, I've used them so many times.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
I didn't quite make that connection

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
because you were the only Black kid at Jewish camp.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Did they all told you their dirty jokes?

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
It's basically...

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
For a lot of them, I was the first Black person they'd ever met

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
because most of them went to Jewish school.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
So they were trying to see what they could get away with

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
and I was so willing to push the envelope

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
that they got away with everything.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Like, they were coming up to you and saying,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
like, hey, did you hear the one about the Black guy on the rabbi?

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Or what were they...

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Can you give me an example of something really specific you remember?

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
There are a lot of back of the oven comments.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Jesus!

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Jesus!

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Get to the back of the oven?

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
That came out of the grassy knoll.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
I'm picturing these 6th grade kids.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
I'm like, oh, what does your hair feel like?

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
And they're like, what?

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Also, let's notice...

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Hit play back if you're listening to this.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000
To the laughter to outrage ratio.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000
It's because Jewish women are famous for their cooking?

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Is that the... No, okay.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Okay, here's the best example.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
I want a hundred of these.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
So I was talking with my counselor

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000
and he was asking me about the origin of my parents,

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
like how they met.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
He was like, oh, who's Black?

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Your mom or your dad? Because I'm mixed.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
And I said, oh, my mom's White.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
My dad's Black. He's from Trinidad.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
And he was asking more.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
And he said, oh, so how did they meet?

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
And I said, oh, they had a mutual friend.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
They met at a restaurant.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
And he goes, oh, was your dad cleaning up?

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Now, do you think that...

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Was he?

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Was he?

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
In your memory,

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
do you think that that kid,

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
your memory may be wrong and may be right,

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
but do you remember that

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
the kid knew what he was doing?

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Or do you think he was being naive?

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Or was he really trying to

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
shiv you?

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Was he being diabolical?

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Because it doesn't seem like kids are even smart enough

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
to be that vile.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Well, first off, that wasn't a kid. That was my counselor.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
So he had a few years on me,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
so he knew much more about the world than I did.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Was he trying to be funny, though?

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Yeah, and it was because I was crying.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I was laughing so hard.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
All the other staff who heard were just kind of standing there.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
He was being like Don Rickles.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
He was laying it on you hard.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Which shows a level of respect to deal it out that hard.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Let's not give this guy too much of a pass.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
I think it shows a level of respect

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
for him to not let it

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
push his button.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
You could be a better camp counselor than that.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I honestly think racism is hilarious.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
You're allowed to.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
You have to

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
and are allowed to.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
We could use with a few less people

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
thinking it's that hilarious

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
that they would sell that joke to a kid.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
You know, we could condemn this guy

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
and get away with it.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
He's a shitty guy.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Bad, bad, bad, bad move.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Bad humor move.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I love bad humor, so.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
That sounds pretty funny.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Thank you.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Do you have any other jokes?

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Because there's certain, I don't like racial jokes

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
where people lose.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
I was at a bar a few days ago

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
and everyone at the end of the bar was telling me

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
the pedophile jokes.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
They're usually not funny. It's just gross.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Humor when somebody loses

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
is usually a bummer.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
However, there's a rare instance.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
What do you mean by that?

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
The butt of the joke is because

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
that guy's black because he's an idiot

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
or because that guy's Polish or because she's a woman

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
or she's blonde or whatever.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
You got

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
two claps.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
That was from a low-embrow guy.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
It's from a black Polish woman.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
I think

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Gracho Marx,

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
the great Gracho Marx was always approached

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
because he was a famous funny person. Throughout his life

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
he was always approached by people,

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
by chorus assholes at a restaurant or a bar

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
on the street and say, oh, I'm a funny guy too.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
You love this one. Two Jews and a black guy going.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
And he would always stop people and say,

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
take the ethnicity out of it because if it's a funny joke

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
it doesn't need it. Just say three guys.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
If the joke needs the race

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
it's not funny.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Try the joke with just two guys

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
or a guy or a girl.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
If it's a funny joke doesn't need it.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
But

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
I've known loads of old

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
school Jewish comics and they'll tell you some old

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Jew jokes which are fucking funny, but it has to be

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
an old Jew telling you the joke.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Well, I think that, yeah.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
That kind of gives the stamp of approval in a way.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
I think it's like...

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
But it has to be Jewish.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
It comes from a place of silliness

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
and not from the outside.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
The great Sam Simon

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
he just passed away.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
He told me a bunch of jokes. One I love.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
He goes, a black guy. We're talking about the

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
racism in jokes or race in jokes.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
And he goes, here's one.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
He goes, a black guy, Irish guy, Jewish guy

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
going to a bar. And the black guy says

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
to the bartender, bartender, I'm hot.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
I'm tired. I'm thirsty. I got to have a cuvasier.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
The bartender gives him a cuvasier. He drinks it down.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
The Irish guy goes to the bartender.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
I'm hot. I'm tired. I'm thirsty.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
I've got to have a Guinness.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
The bartender gives him a Guinness. He drinks it down.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
The Jewish guy says, I'm bartender. I'm hot. I'm tired.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
I'm thirsty. I got to have diabetes.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Yeah, see, that's a...

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
I mean...

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Yeah.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
That one's on the bubble because

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
the punchline

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
isn't anti-Semitic.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
The punchline is like...

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
There's a Jewish guy telling you the joke

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
and it's kind of like the flavor of

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Jewish culturally comedy.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
The problem is that in order to tell it

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
you have to have two other races set it up

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
and the black guy has to order a cuvasier

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
and then just be forgotten

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
for the rest of his life.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
That guy was just born into this fictional world

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
and he's like, what's my job?

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
And God's like, order a cuvasier.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Oh, yeah?

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
And I couldn't be Irish? No.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
You couldn't trust me. Just don't worry about it.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Fuck.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
I want to hear you retell that joke, Dan.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
I want to hear your gift for telling me.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
All right. Go ahead.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Do it!

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
All right, a black guy and Irish guy

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
and a Jewish guy

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
go into a bar

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
and the bartender says,

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
what can I get you?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
And the black guy says,

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
bartender, I'm hot.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
I'm thirsty.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
There was a...

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Tired.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
I'm hot and tired, I'm thirsty.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
I gotta have a cuvasier.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
And the bartender says, okay.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Gives him one and the Irish guy says,

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
bartender, I'm hot.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
I'm tired. I'm thirsty.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
I've got to have

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
my Bailey's Irish cream.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
I give him one

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
and the Jewish guy says,

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
bartender, I'm hot. I'm tired.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
I'm thirsty. I gotta have diabetes.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
I got it.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
I didn't want to break the tape at the finish line.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
I crawled under it.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
We were at a bar.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
We shouldn't be in this race.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
If you know Jay Johnston from Mr. Show

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
and Sarah Silverman program,

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
we were out with Jerry Minor and Brandon Johnson

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
who are two awesome friends of ours

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
and black comics.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
And Jay was doing race jokes

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
just to piss them off

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
like Jerry Minor and Brandon

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
and they were just giving them

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
rustic in years ago

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
and they're like, I don't think that's funny, man.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
You're not making me laugh. Why are you telling these jokes?

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
And I said,

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
I don't really think that race jokes are funny.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
However, there's one joke I think

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
it's only funny if the guy is black

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
and Jerry and Brandon just give me a look

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
like, all right, go. Tell me the joke.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
And I said, I think this joke is only funny if the guy is a black guy.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
So the black guy is walking around a Cadillac dealership

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
and he's looking at the cars

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
and the guy that works there comes out

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
and says, excuse me, sir, are you

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
thinking about buying a Cadillac?

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
And I said, no, I know I'm buying a Cadillac.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
I'm thinking about pussy.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Right, Dursant?

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Fucking love it.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Fucking love it.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Who laugh at anything?

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Your atonement will be

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
with the public

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
when the free podcast drops.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
It has to be

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
if it's not something openly discriminating

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
and it's circumstantial

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
like it is funny that

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
that joke worked because...

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
His high status. He's going to get a car

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
and he's going to get laid later on.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
I don't think he's that high status.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
I don't think he's that high status.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
I think the joke plays into a stereotype

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
that he's a black guy

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
and he's going to get a Cadillac

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
because he thinks he's going to get him laid.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
It's kind of like looking down at him as a consumer.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
It's a stereotype.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
You walk away from that joke

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
you laugh at it and then you go,

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
those black people

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
they love Cadillacs because

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
they think it gets them pussy.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
You shouldn't be thinking that

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
walking away from a joke.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
You should be thinking I love humanity.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
That was your point.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
You don't like it when people lose

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
but you're having a stereotype reinforced.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
The Jewish guy saying

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
it's...

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Like I said, it's on the bubble.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I walk away from that joke thinking

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
parody the stereotype

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
also let me know that that is a stereotype

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
and know not to believe it necessarily.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
You may have been just taught about it

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
by the joke.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Where do we even know about that stuff

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
if it wasn't from jokes?

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
It's not like it's an important debate

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
because what I've learned

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
in the later years of my life

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
I've been thinking about it

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
because I was used to think

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
because I was a big freedom of speech guy

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
no matter what I'd be like

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
it's not about making anything illegal

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
it's not about taking any rights away

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
you can still have a separate conversation

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
about what is culturally beneficial

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
and what makes people happy

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
and what elevates you as a person

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
and stuff.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
What do I care?

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
I don't care.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
I'm white.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
I'm going home to play Witcher 3.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
How about that stereotype?

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Do you like it?

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Yeah, I'm white.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
I love Witcher 3.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
I'm half white so I can understand.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
You can like the first three levels.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
I like it a lot.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
It's like a bigger

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
better Skyrim

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
but I fucked up.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
I got it on Xbox and the load screens

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
are really long.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
I already bought a really expensive gaming PC

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
and I could have just downloaded it on Steam

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
and played it.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
I've already done this and it works

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
and I didn't fucking get it on Steam.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
I'm very upset with myself.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Spencer, can I find out

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
when you're going to be playing Minecraft or whatever

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
and can I come twitch and hurl abuse at you

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
or tell you what color to paint things?

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
You could come.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
I won't stop you.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
I don't have a good schedule.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
I'm just like, I want to play video games

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
so I'm like, I'm going to play video games

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
in five minutes.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
I saw you tweet that once

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
but is that the usual way

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
for people to know that you're going to do it?

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
I guess.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
I can technically answer that.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
I think he can answer that.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
You set a schedule.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
I'm a Minecraft guy.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
I Minecraft every Monday at 7pm

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
so everyone knows to come on Monday at 7pm

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
to watch me Minecraft.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Would you proper dungeon mastering

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
like D&D stuff with groups anymore?

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
No.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
It's a lot of work.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Also, don't go outside much.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
So,

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
not a joke.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
But yeah,

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
no, it's just...

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
You don't miss doing that?

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
I don't have people that I really play with

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
but I mean,

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
I do shadow run.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
It scratches that itch.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
I'm doing...

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
I'm making things happen.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
I don't know, man.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
No, I'm not playing Dungeons & Dragons

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
behind your guys' back.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Thanks.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Cops are bad.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Islam's bad.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
White people are bad.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Black people are bad.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Irish and Jews can give me a break.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Witcher 3's load screens are bad.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
I spoke out in three categories.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Jewish camp sounds pretty bad.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
I hope you get some highlighted.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Actually, you put it that way.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
See?

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
What else is bad?

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
The global warming's bad.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
I'm sweating like a pig.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
The heat.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
The heat's bad.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
I have like a puddle of sweat.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
I have to wring out later.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Evernote

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
and the Apple Watch.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
I ran out of fingers.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Everything's bad. Twitter's bad.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
My Twitter system's bad.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
All you guys are great.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Oh, shit. Thank you, Steve.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Steve just texted me.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
We're going to be at Comic-Con.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
San Diego on the 12th.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Is it July 12th?

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
July 12th.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
But not at Comic-Con.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
You don't have to have a badge.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
We're just going to be in the Gaslamp District.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
So if you're at Comic-Con,

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
I would say you're probably going to leave Sunday.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
But stay a little bit

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
because we're going to do a show Sunday night

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
at the Tin Roof

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
in the Gaslamp.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
And I'll keep tweeting the link to buy tickets.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
But I'm a little panicked.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Because I figure

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Sunday nights, the night everybody leaves.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
But so I'm hoping

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
that there's a way we can

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
just keep spreading awareness.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
And maybe Armenians that are there for Comic-Con

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
and people that are already in San Diego

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
just be there.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Because the place seats like 500 people

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
and it holds 500 people.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
So what are the...

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Let's cook up something special for them

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
and throw a party.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
I know we're going to have signable stuff

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
for Rick and Morty to give away.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
I mean, I don't know if that's enough.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
But I was thinking

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
also if you're in costume,

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
maybe we could do some kind of costume thing

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
and have prizes for that.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
And not to eclipse the whole show with that,

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
but just somebody shows up

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
dressed like a robot.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
That would be amazing.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
I could help you with that.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Are you a larper?

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
I do a lot of different ones.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
But the one I play currently

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
is a post-apocalyptic zombie larp.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
So is that like with paintballs?

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
No, we use nerf.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Nerf guns, yeah.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
And then we also use foam swords.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Is it larping if you're just shooting

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
nerf weapons at each other?

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Sounds like just playing a game.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
At night we're not allowed to fire our nerf weapons

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
because our darts get lost,

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
so we have to throw birdseed packets.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
That doesn't really address my concern.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
So is it,

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
do you pretend you're sorcerers

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
at that point against the zombies?

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Some people yell bang.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
I'm not one of those people.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
I don't use a sword though.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
I've never met a larper.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Well, I probably have,

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
but I've never met an openly larping larper.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
It is a rare thing.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
We are the bottom tier.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Furries are right underneath us.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Literally.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Sometimes right on top.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
I don't know what larping is,

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
but I think I know everything I need to know about it now.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
But I'm just curious about the,

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
so you guys go out

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
and do a clearing in the woods,

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
and then some people are saying,

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
they're like throwing.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
So for this specific one,

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
I'm just going to stick to this one.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
We all head out for a weekend.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
It's a three day event.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
We go game on,

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
and everyone is in character.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
The storytellers will release

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
mobs of 20 to 30 people

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
dressed as zombies to come and attack us.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
We will murder those things and take their things.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
And then our system

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
is a hit points based system and armor based system.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
So when you swing your weapon,

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
you yell how much damage you do,

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
and then the person gets hit by it,

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
they have to calculate their life,

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
and then they fall down if their life goes away.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
So when you swing your weapon,

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
so you're like two, two, two,

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
or like ten.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
You know what your weapon is,

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
and you know how skilled you are.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
You basically have to level up,

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
and then you have to memorize.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
No, that works.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
So like if it was your first night,

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
you would yell two.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Guns start at three.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Guns start at three.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Yeah, so your first night

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
you'd be swinging twos or swinging threes

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
if you got a two-hander.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
I mean, if...

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Yeah?

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
We have another larp over there?

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
No.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
He just loves golf clubs.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Extra hands.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Oh, he's making golf jokes.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
But I did not get that at all.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
I did not get that at all.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
His golf club deals a four.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
All right.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Everybody cool it.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
What am I funny if he was a black guy?

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
So then there are...

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Then there are also powers.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
So there's people with like psionic abilities

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
that throw packets that make your brain melt

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
and stuff.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Yes, very much so.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Can they spit acid?

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
There are zombies that vomit acid.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Good. Okay, sorry.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
There are also zombies that like punch really hard.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Not interested.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Just acid, acid, vomit.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Sign me up.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Are you down for larping

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
or not down for larping?

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Like, is it okay?

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Like real vomit?

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
In really intense scenes, I have seen like play vomit,

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
like putting stuff in their mouth

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
and then squirting it out of their mouth at people.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
We call those splatter mods.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
But he doesn't have to be play vomit, right?

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
All right.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
I think...

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
I want to vomit on people.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
I think there's a special...

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
I think there's a special other thing you could do

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
other than larping.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Is that just called vomiting on people?

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
No, not going to Japan.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Yeah, they have a room for that.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Is that a reference to the first George Bush?

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
The...

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Because he puked at that summit in Tokyo?

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Deep cousin?

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
It's like a 35-year-old...

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
I thought that was like a 35-year-old joke.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
It's like vomit, Japan.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Yeah.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
All right.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
So, psionic abilities

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
and spell abilities,

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
they're all birdseed based?

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Majority of them are.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Some of them are touch.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
How did you land on picking birdseed packets?

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Because if they get lost in the woods,

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
they biodegrade into birdseed.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Oh.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Or they turn into plants.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
That's great.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
You should put tree seeds in there.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
I hope there's tree seeds in there.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Then they would turn into more forest.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Birdseed is plant seeds.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
It doesn't grow birds.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
You're right.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
What did you think birdseeds were?

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
You know what?

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
I didn't fucking know.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Sorry.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
I also don't know where pasta comes from.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Like, I don't...

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Is there like a pasta plant?

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Like, Hitler was the mayor of Berlin?

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
I don't know.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
I like...

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Yeah.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Sunflower seeds are...

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Stay in college, everybody.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Yeah, you're right.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Birdseed is just regular old seeds.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
But we call them birdseed.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Yeah.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
It's not like there's a tree that grows birdseed.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Birdseed.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Do other birds love it?

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
We found a birdseed tree.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
When I was in high school,

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
we tore the paper with this girl's house.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
And for no reason. We were just being assholes.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
And we sprinkled birdseed all over her roof

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
because she and her family were out of town.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
And so we put birdseed all over the roof.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
But it's California, so it doesn't rain for another three months.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
And the wooden shingles are just this dormant birdseed

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
laying there.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
So three months later, all of a sudden,

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
their house is a giant chia pet.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
That's amazing.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Why birdseed?

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Because you can buy it at a pet food store

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
and you can get a giant sack of birdseed

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
and it sprouts into grasses and plants.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Wait, was that your intention?

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Or was your prank to make birds come out of their house?

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Our intention was to make their shingles grow.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Oh, and it really works.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
What's the harm of that?

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
The house looks like the shire.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
I don't know.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
It looks like Bilbo Baggins.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Why don't we all do that?

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Why don't we put birdseed on our roof?

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
They have little tiny roots.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
We'll probably cut into the ceiling.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
It's really tough stuff, but it could.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Can you have a chia cave in?

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
This guy knows his birdseed, Dan.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
It's been a terrible episode.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
That is not true.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
It's fine.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
I don't care.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
We should...

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
The heat's really gotten to you, hasn't it?

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Okay, so tonight...

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
I can't figure out how to deal with this thing

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
with Erin, where she keeps...

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
We keep getting in fights about it.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
We're not going to get in fights about it anymore, though,

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
because my shame button is going to get pushed

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
and I'm not going to breathe.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
I knew the fight was going to be about your shame button.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
But she won't fucking stop bringing up

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
the fact that at this point,

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
at the end of the show, when I go,

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
like, oh, we should get a girl up here

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
before we play the game,

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
and Erin keeps saying,

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
boy, I look forward to a day when we don't have to say that,

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
and I'm like,

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
motherfucker,

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
it's half the species, and it's not like...

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
I mean, you could technically just say,

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
could we get some up in here and then pick a girl

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
and not say it.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
That's dishonest, though.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Yeah, but who cares?

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
What the fuck distinction is that?

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
How is that progress?

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
That I'm keeping something to myself?

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
I'd say the simplest way to look at that

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
is that the show tends to be six guys on stage

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
and adding to them an entity to the show

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
is never a bad idea.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
And I was like, I don't know how to...

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
If Erin's not here, we're going to make it not a big deal.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Do I just keep...

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Because I can't...

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
I mean, I guess you're right, Skyler.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I guess I just have to own all of this

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
fucking my own

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
garbage, I guess.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
The whole point is really to make it...

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Equality is like make it...

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
It's just another thing, not a big deal.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
So by doing that, it's just another thing.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
But where is the bottleneck

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
of the no big deal?

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Is it in my own brain, like Skyler's saying,

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
where I just go, hey, who wants to come up

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
and everyone raises their hand?

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
And then, meanwhile, in my head, secret Terminator is

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
disqualified penis, disqualified penis,

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
mmm, boobies, get up.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Like...

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Or is it more honest

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
or less honest for me to say...

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
What is Erin's beef about it?

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
That it feels like women are

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
like some kind of

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
you know,

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
subhuman like...

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
It's not like you're saying, oh, we need to get a subhuman up here.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Then it's a quota or something.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
But it is a quota because there's been any women up.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Or women are just people that get

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
to be discluted because of that?

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
And then she'll bring up,

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
and then she'll go to, she'll say,

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
well, yeah, but you don't have a quota, you never say,

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
let's bring such and such

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
racial group up to which I say,

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
but race is an artificial construct.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Like, there's no, like, I also don't say

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
let's bring a red-haired person up.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
But the, you know,

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
there's a biological distinction

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
and

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
women are not up here all night.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
I'm

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
42, I can only get so fucking

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
progressive.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
My 30-year-old wife is revealing to me

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
that I'm Archie Bunker. Still, still I'm Archie Bunker.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
I agree

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
that bringing up

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
a female to play Aaron's character

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
is a progressive

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
thing.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
I think I phrased that really badly.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Because it's good, it's progressive

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
as your logic.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
I think so, yeah. I think...

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
I'm really bad at this.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
So I'm just gonna try to say it.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Are we bringing somebody else up to play Shadowrun

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
for 12 minutes?

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Yes.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Then we get to pick whether we bring up a male

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
or a female person.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Should we flip a coin?

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Why don't we bring up a female

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
but not for Aaron's character specifically?

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
We could just always get females

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
for all of the Shadowrun.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Just so you know, I don't think that's her beef.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
It has nothing to do with

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
whether you're playing her character.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
It's voicing it, that's the issue.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Well, I think we need more females.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
If it is awkward asking for them,

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
I think it's a bullet we should take.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Would a woman like to play any character

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
in Shadowrun right now after all of that horrible bullshit?

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Thank you.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
No women are even volunteering themselves right now.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Oh, we have one. Got one.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
We have one brave soul there. What's your name, man?

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Awesome.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
She'll take that government cheese.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Yeah.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
What's your name?

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Heather.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Heather has a thread that sewed the button on the jacket.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
The Jack War.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Hello, Heather.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Hello.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
I like your serious sucker shirt.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Thank you. It's just from Target.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
I dig it.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
By the way, I wasn't stopping the show

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
because it was an actual problem.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
I was stopping the show because I thought it was a conversation point

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
that I'm confused about that needs to be addressed.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
That doesn't need to be solved.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
There's just something interesting to talk about.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
You know, you know,

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
it's a big shame when you have to go out of your way

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
to proactively, like,

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
homogenize and stuff.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
But also,

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
you know,

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
you know,

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
you know,

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
you know,

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
you know,

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
you know,

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
you know,

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
you know,

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
you know,

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
you know,

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
homogenize and stuff.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
But also,

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
like,

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
until writing staff were told that they had to,

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
like,

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
you know,

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
you have to be proactive about shit and then the system changes.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
The show,

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
when there's half women out there in the audience,

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
which there aren't,

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
you know,

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
you know,

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
a woman will take Spencer's place.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
I'll go over where Jeff's sitting.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Jeff will drive the women to and from the show.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.000
I'll sign up for that.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.000
From the show.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.000
From the show.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Where'd you get behind that?

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
All right, so who...

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
You don't have to say Marcie O'Donnell, Heather.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Who would you like to play?

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
If you could pick any of these other characters,

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.000
because you could play any one...

01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:59.000
You could play Dr. Friend.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Oh, I'd like to play Dr. Friend.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000
All right.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Heather is going to play Dr. Friend.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Skyler.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
I get to pick.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Yeah.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
The remaining ones.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
I really do love Marcie.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000
I think she's a fantastic character.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000
This show is so progressive.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Skyler is Marcie.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.000
I guess Darsan, does that leave you horticard, maybe, or no?

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.000
That's racist.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000
That's racist?

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Oh, damn it!

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.000
I'm trying to get one thing.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.000
I'm trying to get one thing.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
I'm still, like, new to this, so...

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Black guy's always going to play the German psychic.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.000
How about this?

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.000
I'll play horticard, and you play Eve Liberty in Darsan.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.000
How about that?

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
I'm just going to go with... I have no idea what's going on.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Okay.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.000
You guys want to hear a joke that I think is actually only funny if it's a black guy in

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.000
the year 2075?

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Yes.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:49.000
A black guy goes to a cybernetic upgrade shop, and the guy comes out and says,

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:56.000
excuse me, sir, are you looking for a psionic chip to help focus your latent psychic powers

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.000
that were awakened in the Great Awakening of 2054?

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:08.000
And the black guy says, well, no, I'm thinking about pussy.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Still funny, even in the future.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
And then he hovers away.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Progressive.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Can I plug my LARP?

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Can I plug my LARP?

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Oh, yeah, plug your LARP, dude.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Scalers.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Well, I realized I just said a bunch of stuff about it, and a lot of the people that play

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000
listen to the podcast.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Plug your LARP, baby.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Plug it.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000
It's called dystopia rising.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
You can look up dystopia rising.com.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Can I come and be one of the zombies that dies when people throw birdseed at?

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Yes.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
There is a game here in LA.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000
It's played at a Renfairee.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.000
How do you hire those people that come out and just get birdseed?

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Oh, so everybody volunteers.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:50.000
So every time you come to an event, you do a four-hour shift as an NPC.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.000
So you do a four-hour shift of being a zombie, and then everyone kind of takes turn at that.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:01.000
So you have like a 150-person game, and then from there, people will come and shift and

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000
be zombies.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Because that's what people picked.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000
I'm sorry.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000
We're having a side conversation.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
You're trying to plug your LARP.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000
I'm being really disrespectful.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000
It's called dystopia rising.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000
There are 13 chapters across the U.S. right now, and it's growing pretty quickly.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.000
You can probably find, there's a lot on the East Coast, but there's one up in Washington,

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.000
which is where I'm from, and then also in Oregon, and then there's one here, and then

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
there's one in Indiana and Texas.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Yeah, they're all over.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:26.000
The one in Indiana is really the best.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.000
It's pretty good.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000
It was this past weekend.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.000
I don't know how you knew that.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:36.000
You know what, the combat part actually makes me kind of anxious, but the idea of going out

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:41.000
and going to a big thing where it's like game on, and then you have to be your character,

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000
and then you're just walking around like, hello, my name's Lord Fingalberry.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.000
One of the best.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.000
So a lot of...

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
I could do that forever, really.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000
A lot of LARPs.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Because I hate myself.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Sorry, I know.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.000
A lot of LARPs are built around combat, and we call them stick jocks.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
So they're guys that just like to hit each other with swords, right?

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Right.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.000
So the reason this game is so amazing is because you stay in character from Friday to Sunday.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Nice.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000
All night.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:11.000
You sleep in character, your door can get kicked in, and zombies can fucking murder you.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:15.000
So what if your character has night terrors?

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
I know characters with sleep apnea.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000
We have a medical time.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Shit.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000
We have a medical time.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.000
So the thing that's great is the whole universe is dystopian.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.000
You know players with sleep apnea.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Yes.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:34.000
All their characters are possessed by demons.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Oh, the power!

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:43.000
That'd be a serious larpher who didn't really have sleep apnea, but his character did.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000
You got a sleeping character?

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
But where was I going?

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.000
This game has production, so there are people that don't fight.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.000
There are people that just produce.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:55.000
They build things, and there's farmers.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000
There's engineers.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.000
There's tinkers.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.000
They build guns and swords and upgrade armor and stuff like that.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Are there people that just hang out and drink?

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.000
There are totally people.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.000
So we call them technically their murder hobos.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.000
They don't have jobs.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000
They don't produce anything.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
They just hit stuff, and they just drink.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Are idiots?

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Yeah, not like that.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Oh, just hang out?

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000
There's totally people.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Yeah, but I don't mean like a fratty guy crashing the thing.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Could you be like a barkeep?

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Yes, totally.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000
There are multiple bars across the U.S.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Or like a bar, just in the bar?

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Yes, there's a profession called the Entertainer, where you just play an instrument.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Jan, do you want to go do it?

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Do you stand up comedy?

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
I mean, yeah, I need a free weekend.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.000
I want to do that, and I want to go intertubing, which Erin's doing.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
So that's what Erin's doing right now.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
She's floating down a river.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:41.000
It's the best.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Right now?

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.000
It's the middle of the night.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Not in St. Louis.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Yeah.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Next time you come up north to like Seattle Portland area, if you want to coordinate,

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:59.000
I can get you and have that way I can control how good of an experience it is.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
I wouldn't be able to send you to another place.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Skylar, I've got to warn you, Dan's a bit of a stickjock.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
We take all kinds.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
We're a very accepting community.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
We have 30 seconds to play Shadowrun.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Well, to keep in mind, the show starts at 8.20.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Yeah, it doesn't.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Spencer, do you have a guest recapper for us?

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Not today.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Let me just wing it terribly.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:32.000
All right, here we are.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Last time on Shadowrun.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Our heroes found themselves in a tear gas-filled hospital bed.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000
But they got out of there pretty quick.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Donning the disguises of downed security guards, they scuttled down an elevator and passed a nosy receptionist into a secret underground area.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:59.000
There they found Baldwin Brown's former office.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:03.000
And with it, the research data they were meant to retrieve.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:09.000
But before they could retrieve it, Baldwin Brown himself hailed our adventurers.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.000
They're not adventurers in this game.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Shadowrunners over the comlink, asking to return his research to him.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:23.000
The gang studied the request before declining.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:28.000
But as they were leaving, they heard the snitch of blades.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Jesse Yellowman was here to collect on his employer's collection.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.000
I said it was terrible.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.000
I was not looking for that.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Now, Nightblade and the team, why did we say no to Baldwin Brown who wanted his stuff back?

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Because we're terrible people.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Well, we didn't say no.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
We said we'll think about it.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000
We gotta do a job.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.000
And real quick, remind me who Jesse Yellowman is.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:04.000
He's the young ward of Baldwin Brown.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.000
He's got blades coming up out of his knuckles.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000
And he wants Baldwin Brown's research for himself.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Well, he's like, hey, I'm gonna pick it up.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Pick up the research.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
The easy way or the hard way?

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Well, kid, the hard way might be the easier way for us.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.000
And the easy way may be harder for you than you think.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Huh.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Yeah, I'm not a mathematician, but there's like a thousand of us.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
You sure aren't.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000
I cast level 5 stun ball on him.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Alright, level 5.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Okay.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:49.000
You take three drain.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000
You go unconscious as you unleash a stun ball.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
It wings him in the face.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Jesus, that wasn't worth it.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.000
He looks dazed as if he's been dazed,

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:03.000
but you are unconscious from the strain of repeated spell casting.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
I should have asked what my drain was before I did that.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Yep.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Alright, kid, can you hear me?

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Can you hear me?

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Somebody heal me?

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Yeah, man.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000
We didn't say we weren't going to...

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000
I already took out one of your guys.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Oh, come on, man.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000
That's not fair.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:22.000
We didn't say we weren't going to work with your guy,

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000
but you can't...

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
You know, if you're going to fight us, we're going to fight you.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Oh, sorry.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Okay.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000
I just...

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:31.000
What's happening right now?

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
What's happening is we got the files.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000
We got to get the fuck out of this place.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Fighting each other isn't going to...

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.000
It's not a good idea.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Maybe you should have said that before your friends started fighting at me.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
I think she just fell on the ground.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
How much are they paying you?

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.000
They're not paying me nothing.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
I do it for the love of the job.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
That's unfortunate.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Well, then I'll double your price to help us get out of this building

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.000
and then we can fight in the street.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Well, I really need this research.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.000
We can't let it get out of my hand.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:02.000
You should pick her up and carry her out of here.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.000
I can do that.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
I'm a troll.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
You do that.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
You easily heft her up on your shoulder.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Yes.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
He's supposed to have Jeff's folder, right?

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Yeah.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Okay.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Oh, shit.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.000
I was playing the wrong character.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Oh, yeah.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Well, you said you were like, I'm going to play Dimorph.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
I'm Horde God.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.000
I forgot.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Yeah.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000
I don't cast a spell.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000
I said it.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.000
No.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.000
No one's unconscious.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
No one's unconscious.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:36.000
I don't cast a spell.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Is it possible that I maybe look at a thing and perhaps maybe French fries?

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
Wait, where the fuck is Dimorph?

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.000
He is here.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Is Dimorph here?

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Dimorph was in the green room.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Dimorph, get out here.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Well, then we've got to kick someone out.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000
No, no.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.000
He can play himself.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.000
I'll just sit here.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Dimorph's round.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:01.000
What?

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:11.000
You know, it's okay, Dan.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:19.000
I was thinking at the time that we were in Edinburgh and I was going up with Nipsey Russell and his friends.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.000
And you were caught up in a melee of some sort.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.000
All right.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Sorry.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.000
So let's go.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.000
I'm sorry.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.000
I forgot you were here.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Don't worry, man.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.000
It's not my game.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Okay.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
So where were we?

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
We're going to get the fuck out of here.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Yeah.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Here we go.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000
No one's unconscious.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Who's?

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.000
No one's unconscious?

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
Are we doing a do-over on that?

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Yeah, because, yeah, he was controlling the wrong character.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000
All right.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.000
So here we all go.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Blade, blade handguide, everybody.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Where are we going?

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.000
We're leaving.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Where?

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
In an Uber.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Okay.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:57.000
We've got to go upstairs first, past all these dead bodies.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000
You've killed people?

01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Yeah.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.000
I mean, I wasn't really.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:03.000
This was more of a hit-and-run sort of thing.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Not really.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Hey, Hakai.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Yes.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.000
I'm on the com link.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Did this guy set off a bunch of alarms when he murdered all of these guards to get down here?

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.000
No.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.000
He's a real pro.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.000
That's excellent.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Thank you.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.000
But they will find the bodies soon.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Fox.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Soon amount of time.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.000
All right.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Well, let's go.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000
And everyone stop asking how.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.000
It's obviously the way we came.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Why do you keep asking that?

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000
The way we came.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000
We leave.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
We leave the way we came.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Back out past the lady, into the elevators, back up, and out the exit.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Holder guard takes the lead.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Using his combat sense and all of his sensibilities leads them through to the front.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Up the stairs, around a couple floors and to the front.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Stepping over the bodies.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:56.000
If you follow his actions, perhaps you will get there safely as well.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
I follow him.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Following closely, you dodge the detection of guards with the combat senses of horticard.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:14.000
You end up in the front hallway, but there you hear a voice behind you.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Stop.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Stop you.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Turning around, you see 17 guards.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
They're a good 60 feet off.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
It's a long, long hallway.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:28.000
You've made pretty good time considering.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.000
It's all right.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:30.000
I'm a guard.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.000
No.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.000
What?

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.000
I'm dressed.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.000
I'm dressed as a guard.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.000
I'm a guard.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Can I make a force wall?

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Yeah.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:42.000
How strong of a force wall do you want to make?

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
From one to six.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Five.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Oh, shit.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
That's a good number.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
It really is.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Drawing upon your troll magic, you conjure up a shield of shimmering energy.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:08.000
It stretches across the entire hallway, coating it in light and force energy.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Now we can run.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
I'm using my city sense.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.000
I have a sense of Uber.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000
It's how far away?

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:19.000
You can sense an Uber just two blocks away.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:22.000
This technology is really, really good.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
It's a skill soft.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:29.000
If you were addicted to them as I am, you would apply them and use them to their best benefit.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Hey, I'm not really a guard.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.000
You fuck faces.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
We're behind a force field.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Just wearing guard clothes.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Hodergaard leads the gang outside.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Those that will follow.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Those that want to talk trash, well, you know.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.000
You guys go.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.000
I'm just leaving last, walking backwards.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:57.000
My arms spread like a cocky seagull talking shit.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
I assure them that everything is okay.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.000
This is common.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:04.000
He often uses the monologue defense to protect his people.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Who are you saying that to?

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
To the rest of the gang that is following.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
Good, good, good, good.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Fuck you guys.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.000
I wasn't a guard.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Fooled you.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Maybe we shouldn't tempt fate and just get in the Uber.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Well, go, just go.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Yeah, I'm just saying.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
I'm walking out backwards and talking shit.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Yeah, there you are.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:31.000
By the way, I didn't kill all those people.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
The door is closing.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Is everyone in?

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Everyone's in the Uber, including Jesse.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Solid.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Sweet.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:43.000
And we motor off.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Where are we going?

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:49.000
To our secret clubhouse.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Well, who wants these files that we got?

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.000
I do.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Two people.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
But we don't want to give them to you, right?

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Well, I hope you do.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Because otherwise we should have fought back there.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Well, I think it's easier to fight now that we're in the car.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
I don't think it's easy to fight in the car.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.000
We're going to fight in a place where we can fight,

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:15.000
or discuss civilly or whatever, free of intervention.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Let's go to my apartment.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Shane Nightblade.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.000
All right.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
You can come link a map to that section to me,

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.000
or you can just give me your address.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Done.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
So be it.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Allow it.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:42.000
I'm opening myself up a lot to you guys by inviting you to this place.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
I'm a very private person.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:47.000
This is like a big deal for me.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
You roll up to your apartment.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.000
If I recall correctly, it's not that nice.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Noted.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:03.000
I tip the doorman a few New Yen.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:12.000
We get in the Neo elevator and head up to the laser apartment.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.000
It's not that nice.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Sorry, the robot made that vacation.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:29.000
God uses his perception of truth just to determine if there ever was a robot.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:33.000
No.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
As I suspected.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
A guy like me is going to keep a low profile,

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000
have a lot of identities.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
This is just one of them.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Do you know your neighbors?

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
No, and they don't know me.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.000
That's why we're here.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
This is where we'll never be found.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
We can have a conversation.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Everybody want space drinks?

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Future drinks?

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Future drinks?

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Future drinks?

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Do you happen to have Sputnik 1?

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
You got it.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Sputnik 1.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Sputnik 1.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.000
The drink-o-matic.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Hydrate level 4, please.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.000
I should have made a pizza.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
Here you go, here's your drinks.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Now.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
What are we doing?

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Billy Baldwin.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
What's his name?

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Baldwin Brown.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
I thought we had Jesse, what's his name?

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Jesse Yellerman.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Baldwin Brown is in captivity.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Sent his compatriot here to kill everybody.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Jesse, you work for Baldwin?

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Oh yeah, we go way back.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:51.000
He was my old teacher.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Baldwin was saying that the repercussions of us doing our job,

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
which we were contracted to do,

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:04.000
were cataclysmic, shall we say?

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
You want to go into more detail about that?

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Yeah, man.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
I could do that.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
I mean, I can't.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
I don't know what his research was.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
I just trust that it was really important.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.000
If he says bad shit's going to go down,

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
I'd trust him.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Jesse, is it possible that,

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
if we were willing to give you this information,

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:29.000
the stuff that we stole with our skills,

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:32.000
that you would maybe owe us a favor?

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Yeah, no, I mean, no doubt.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Look at this.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Knuckles, they shoot laser blades, razor blades.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Not laser blades, important distinction.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Laser razor blades.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Laser razor blades would have been way cooler.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
I know, you're telling me.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
One of these days, I'll be able to afford them.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Right now, razor blades.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
How much would those cost?

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Oh, you know, 20,000, 30,000, easy.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Well, the situation we're in is we took a job,

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
and if we don't do it,

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
then they're going to be after us forever.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
So, I don't know.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Are they going to come after us,

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
or are they just going to not pay us?

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
They're going to not pay us,

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
and they're going to raise their hands up in the wrong hands.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
They're going to think that we did what we did.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Our crew isn't known for failing jobs,

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:22.000
so I understand our reputation is pretty high.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Sarcasm?

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:32.000
I think that Jesse and Baldwin as allies

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
might be better than just some creds

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:37.000
for the risk that we went through.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:40.000
I'm sorry, Newian.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
I mean, we're shadow runners.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
We shadow run.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Sometimes runs fail, man.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
But if we just go with these guys,

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
then the next time someone goes,

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
I want you to hire you for a shadow run.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Hey, this isn't going to be one of those ones

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
where you just decide in the middle of it

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
that it's like a meta shadow run

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
and you're going to bail on it.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
We're going to go, no, no, we promised this time,

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
we really...

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
It would take like a whole big thing for that to happen,

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
like someone asking us, please don't do the shadow run.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Then we'd have to...

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.000
What if we concocted an elaborate plan

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
or scheme that would make it seem

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
that we didn't do this intentionally,

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.000
that they just hijacked this information from us

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.000
and we would know that we were being allies with them,

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
but the rest of the world would think

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
that we were just the victims of their bullying.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
I think Dr. Friend's onto something.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:32.000
I think we are in a safe, secure location.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
God damn it!

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:38.000
I'd knock a bunch of stuff off the counter.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Whoa, monologue alert.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:44.000
You guys aren't hearing what I'm saying.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
I fell down to the shadows

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
from the heights of the society.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000
I go to the shadow runs because I gave up on that world.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:54.000
If they want me back, they got to tell me why.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
What's at stake? What's going on?

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
I want to know what's going on.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
I'm tired of these word games and puzzles and riddles.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
You're double talk and you're smart talk.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
I'm just a big dumb shadow runner.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
I want to know what's happening.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
This is BTL chips. Talk!

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
BTL chips are just drugs, man.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
They fuck up your brain.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Yeah, so what?

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
So this research, I don't know.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
It might be able to help people.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Can we call Baldwin?

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000
We need answers.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
I got his number.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Put him up on a hologram or something.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Alright.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
So it's visually interesting.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Let me dial him up.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Beat, boot, beat, beat, beat.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
We just killed this guy.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
He seems kind of bad-ass.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
It's Baldwin.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Hello.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Hey, what's up?

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
How'd you guys get my number?

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
We're with Pink, Pink, Jesse Pinkman.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Oh, cool.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Wait, who's that?

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.000
We're with Jesse.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Jesse Yellow.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Oh.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Okay.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:00.000
We're trying to work out a deal, but we need more information.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:01.000
We want to know, God damn it!

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
We want to know what's going on!

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:06.000
What's the worst thing that's going to happen if we don't give you your stuff?

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Just world domination, but not by us.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Bad people domination.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.000
That sounds pretty bad.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Sounds like standing operating procedure.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Yeah, look out the window, Jack!

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
The bad guys won!

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:27.000
So you're saying our Johnson's going to use this information in your research

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
to take over the world?

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Yeah, I mean, not just take it over.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Really murder it.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:39.000
So the original price you were offering us for this reversal was what?

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Oh, I mean, I don't have any money.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.000
They don't really pay me, but I will owe you two.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Three.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Three.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Of what?

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Universes.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
You know how people owe you one?

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
I'll owe you three.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Understood.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:56.000
That's pretty good.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
I believe those work in powers as well.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
So each one is actually eventually better.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:05.000
I would like to place the hologram on mute.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Muting the hologram how the guard is putting it on mute.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Okay.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:13.000
And on blind so that he cannot see my lips moving.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Smart move.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
So he cannot see my lips moving.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:21.000
It is my contention that, look, we were hired to acquire certain properties.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:25.000
We applied ourselves to the acquisition of such properties.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:32.000
We were given assistance to assist in the acquisition of such properties.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:36.000
We acquired such properties and it has become complicated in every route out of this.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Otherwise becomes infinitely and infinitely more complicated.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:43.000
The simplest route, the truest route, the route that is most shadowy of the running

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:49.000
routes is to complete it and deliver said properties and say completion of the deal,

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:54.000
take our remuneration and move from there to the next job.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:55.000
All right.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Occam's route.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.000
Occam's route.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Horticard, I agree with you.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.000
But it comes however alert.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:11.000
However, I believe this is a turning point as us as runners to decide where we stand morally.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:15.000
God damn it, the reason they hire us is so that we don't have moral turning points.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.000
But we have a choice.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:19.000
We see the consequences of our actions.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:23.000
That would make us shafts, like not shadow runners.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
We're supposed to shadow run.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:26.000
I'm sorry.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:27.000
This is my button.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:33.000
When I was a child, man, child, man, little boy, man, my mentor was shot in the street

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.000
in front of me.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:40.000
I spent many of my days not around you guys suspending myself above a bottle of water

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:44.000
and using the vapor between me to draw truths.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:47.000
So I'm not so much concerned with your moral, your morality.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
This sort of world does not have that sort of morality.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:52.000
It doesn't live in a plainer existence.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:55.000
It has several dimensions and twists and turns, and we are learning every day.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:58.000
A lunge and stun baton, Jesse Yellowman.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
All right.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Then I guess I'm just a face.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:08.000
A very subtle one.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Using robot reflexes, he dodges to the side.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Fuck!

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
That was a massager.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Is hacker.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Yeah.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:20.000
I just tried to stun him.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:21.000
He disarms you.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:22.000
No, no, no.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:23.000
He disarms me.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Now I got the stun baton, bitch.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Slithanger!

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Thank God in heaven.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Let's thank Heather, everybody.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Skyler, Darsen, Zemors Brown, Spencer Crittenden, I'm Jeff Davis, your mayor, Dan Harmon, everybody.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:50.000
This show brought to you by the Apple Watch.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:53.000
Thank you for coming.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:56.000
We went a little bit late, but we do serve breakfast.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Breakfast will be outside in the Meltdown Comic Clowns.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Did you get any of that?

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:21.000
It's a good show.
