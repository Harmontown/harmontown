{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:07.000\nFrom Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comic, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:14.000 --> 00:18.000\nPlease keep those applause going for your Dungeon Master, Mr. Spencer Crittenden.\n\n00:18.000 --> 00:31.000\nSee him scurry to his tail. That was good scurrying. Oh, that was a scamper.\n\n00:34.000 --> 00:39.000\nHow you doing, Spencer? I'm good. Are you ready to bring out the mayor, Spencer? Yeah.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:54.000\nLet's say it together. Dan Harmon. Thank you.\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:05.000\nWhy do I come in from the back? At this point, it's kind of really dumb. There's a tripod in my way. It doesn't seem...\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:10.000\nIf we're going to do that, we need a jib camera that tracks you as you come in or a steady cam.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:16.000\nWe're tweaking the format here. I thought, let's bring Spencer up at the top of the show instead of saving him for dessert.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:23.000\nI really mangled this guy's leg, too. Oh, really? What are you stepping on? Oh, by this guy? Stepped all over it.\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:30.000\nOh, wait. Oh, this guy? I'm glad I could help. I thought it was Anatoly. I was going to say, he deserves it.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:41.000\nBecause Anatoly, his feet touch the back wall. He sits in the front row and he puts his big Russian legs across the stage.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:48.000\nI would make a joke about Russian history, but they've always been invaded. It's like the stage was the Ukraine.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:54.000\nAnd this back wall was the Black Sea.\n\n01:54.000 --> 02:02.000\nYeah, see, that's the joke I would have made. I just kept thinking about Napoleon. I'm like, well, this is not going to work.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:08.000\nAnyways, you remember Napoleon, right, Anatoly?\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:12.000\nIs that a sore subject for Russians, the Napoleonic Wars?\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:15.000\nSure it is.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:19.000\nYou beat him. You kicked his butt. You sent him packing back home to France.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:24.000\nAlright, let me see if this is working. Okay, great, this is working.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:30.000\nAlright, so my Twitter notifications are on. I kind of panicked last time. They're on.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:41.000\nBut if you'd like to tweet at me, I won't yell at you. It should tap my wrist just a little bit and I can look and I can go, oh, good question.\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:51.000\nAlice and Brie is very nice. Something like that. So try not to abuse your power. Don't be smart, Alex.\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:57.000\nActually, you in the audience, please just be in the room with us. Will you? Don't sit there and tweet at me.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:03.000\nI'm talking to the people at home on the laptops.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:12.000\nIs it happening? Has it already happened? Well, just give me one second.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:14.000\nCan we have it make a little noise?\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:20.000\nThere's two notifications. Hi, Dan. Sorry to be annoying. What will you be doing while Aaron is in Ireland?\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:24.000\nI'll be playing Witcher 3.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:26.000\nIs she in Ireland right now?\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:39.000\nNo, she's in St. Louis. Looking sexy tonight. Hashtag in the room. Okay.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:41.000\nThat was Spencer. That was totally Spencer.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:44.000\nIt's a dude. It's Huey.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:48.000\nAlright, well, okay.\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:56.000\nSports Corner, R.E. U.S. Open. A sports corner about the U.S. Open. Okay. Shall we?\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:57.000\nOkay.\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:58.000\nAlright.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:01.000\nSports Corner!\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:06.000\nAnother one music. We need sports corner music. Hold up. Hold up.\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:10.000\nAlso women's soccer, right? Women's World Cup.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:14.000\nHere we are.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:19.000\nSports Corner. Gotta hit the ball. Gotta make it go far in the seasons of the fall.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:24.000\nGo in the summer and spring. Gotta do sports. Gotta do your thing. I like to jump real high.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:28.000\nI like to go real low. I like to go across the ice. I like to go across the snow.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:32.000\nWinter Olympics are done, but Sports Corner is still kind of fun.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:34.000\nOh!\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:36.000\nThank you.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:40.000\nThanks, guys. Thanks.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:41.000\nI agree.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:48.000\nNow, Dan, sadly, I missed the ending of the U.S. Open. Maybe you could tell us what happened.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:52.000\nFirst of all, maybe you could tell us what sport it is.\n\n04:52.000 --> 05:03.000\nWell, I mean, the important thing is that it's American and it is open to everyone who plays the sport.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:07.000\nThere is no discrimination. That's the spirit of the U.S. Open.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:13.000\nIt's not private. You can just play. If you play, you just come and play.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:14.000\nCan women be in it, too?\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:18.000\nIf it's the women's U.S. Open, yeah.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:19.000\nIt's not.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:24.000\nIt's not. So no.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:27.000\nBut trans men...\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:33.000\nWhat's your favorite thing about the sports that the U.S. Open was celebrating today?\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:39.000\nWell, I mean, it's just, as you know...\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:47.000\nLike, everything comes down to where that ball is. Right?\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:49.000\nAbsolutely.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:53.000\nSo far, you're 100% right.\n\n05:53.000 --> 06:00.000\nAnd it's just like, the idea is to get the ball where it needs to be.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:04.000\nWhich is where specifically?\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:06.000\nWell, you want to...\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:09.000\nWhat's the destination for this particular ball?\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:13.000\nI think the important thing is that you want to do a better job of getting it there than your opponent.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:17.000\nYes, yes.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:21.000\nSo we're done here.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:25.000\nI think it's either tennis or golf.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:26.000\nIt's golf.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:29.000\nOkay, it's golf. I knew that.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:31.000\nWho won the thing? Did anyone know?\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.000\nTeddy Rexman.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:35.000\nTeddy Rexman won?\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:40.000\nThe animatronic bear from our childhood?\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:42.000\nTeddy Rexman won.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:44.000\nThat really is open.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:45.000\nSee? Anyone can do it.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:46.000\nWho won? Anyone know?\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:47.000\nJordan Spieth.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:48.000\nJordan Spieth won.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:49.000\nAll right.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:50.000\nJordan Spieth.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:51.000\nSpieth.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:52.000\nWhat did you think, Dan, about the guy...\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:56.000\nIs it Jason Day, who had vertigo a couple days ago, absolutely passed out,\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:59.000\nbecause he has crazy vertigo, went down on the 16th hole,\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:02.000\nmanaged to pull himself back together, finished the round,\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:03.000\nand then he almost...\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:05.000\nHe was on the running the whole way through, wasn't he?\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:09.000\nOur fans don't give a shit.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:14.000\nWell, I don't know how many points overcoming vertigo should get you\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:21.000\nin a sport where you walk around and hit a ball when you feel like it.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:24.000\nIf I was a football player and I suffered from vertigo,\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:28.000\nmy doctor would tell me, why don't you try golfing?\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:31.000\nGo walk around on some grass until you feel better.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:34.000\nSo if, while you're doing that, you win a golf tournament,\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:38.000\nI'm not going to go, plus, he's so special.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:41.000\nHe was here because he can't play football.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:44.000\nHow do you feel about the U.S. women's World Cup right now?\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:47.000\nI mean, the women's World Cup all-inclusive, the whole world.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:50.000\nThe women's World Cup would be soccer.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:52.000\nFootball, as we call it.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:55.000\nThose of us who are into soccer, we don't call it soccer.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:58.000\nIt's like calling San Francisco Frisco.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nI think it's great, Jeff.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:02.000\nThose ladies are out there.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:11.000\nThey're doing it just as good as ladies can.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:14.000\nWhich might be better than men.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:19.000\nYou projected that on to me.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:21.000\nSpencer, are you following the World Cup?\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:23.000\nNo. Are they playing?\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nYes.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:28.000\nThe World Cup is playing against FIFA this week, aren't they?\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\nYeah, it's one of the weirdest matchups.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nThe World Cup is playing FIFA.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:35.000\nWhat country is FIFA that's Brazil versus the U.S.?\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nIt's going to be great.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:38.000\nFIFA.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:39.000\nAll right.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nDouble sports corner.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:43.000\nI love the World Women's World Cup.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:46.000\nThere was a woman playing today, and I'm just adolescent\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:49.000\nand pure-wile and stupid enough to have enjoyed the fact\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:51.000\nthat there was a woman playing for Austria.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:53.000\nHis name was Dick and Men.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:56.000\nDick and Men on the back of everything.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nThere's also a girl named Tamika Butt.\n\n08:58.000 --> 08:59.000\nYeah.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:01.000\nButt.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:06.000\nShe did a good job.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\nIt's for Tamika Butt.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:09.000\nAll right.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:11.000\nWhat happened to your glasses, says Anna Marie.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:13.000\nYou know, I don't know.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:17.000\nI think they left them at the house.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:20.000\nAre you afraid people aren't going to like you right now?\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nYeah, well, until Anna Marie brought it up,\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nI had forgotten about them.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nTell me you love me.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:29.000\nI love you, Karimie.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:30.000\nKarimie?\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:35.000\nNot since Tamika has a name been so chuckly.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:36.000\nSorry, Karimie.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:38.000\nIt's just a weird name.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:40.000\nI give a shit.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nOkay.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:45.000\nThis is hard because the bird icon keeps coming up.\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:47.000\nI give a shit, says that guy.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:49.000\nFirst time live streaming.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:50.000\nOkay, good luck.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:53.000\nKevin, see, it keeps.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:54.000\nOkay, every time someone sends one,\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:56.000\nwe'll have to, yeah, it's not going to work.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:57.000\nEvery time someone sends one,\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:59.000\na big bird face comes up on the thing.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:01.000\nI'm in the middle of reading one.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:02.000\nIt's not working.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:03.000\nIt's not, see?\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:04.000\nSee what happens?\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:07.000\nYou can't disable the bird.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:10.000\nI can't disable the bird.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:12.000\nNo, I can't disable the bird.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:14.000\nThere should be a bird disable function.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:15.000\nThere should be a lot of things.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:18.000\nI found another Apple Watch bug today\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:20.000\nwith my Evernote app.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:23.000\nIf you write an Evernote\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:27.000\nthat is exactly as long as the Apple Watch's screen,\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:30.000\nand then you add more,\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:32.000\nit won't show it.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:34.000\nBut if you add five more things,\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:35.000\nthen it'll show everything.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:36.000\nYou can scroll it.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:38.000\nBut if you hit it right on the nugget,\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:39.000\nbug.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:42.000\nThat's my bug report.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:44.000\nAll right, let's beep this shit up.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nLet's talk about lesbians and race.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:47.000\nOkay.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:51.000\nI don't really have anything.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:52.000\nGod damn it.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.000\nI can't get to my Evernote.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:57.000\nPeople keep tweeting.\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:58.000\nOkay.\n\n10:58.000 --> 10:59.000\nAll right.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.000\nThis is better than the phone?\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:04.000\nShut up, Jeff.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:06.000\nI didn't mean that to be provocative.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:08.000\nIt would have been better than the phone\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:09.000\nif I hadn't tried the Twitter experiment.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:11.000\nI thought we could try the Twitter thing,\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:12.000\nbut it would be cool.\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:14.000\nWe tried something, and you know what?\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:18.000\nDo you know what the Four Agreements guy says?\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:20.000\nDid you read more of the book?\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:22.000\nNo, but this is something I still remember\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:24.000\nfrom the first two agreements.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:27.000\nWe're only going off, you're reading a half hour.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:30.000\nI'm one agreement in, and that's good enough.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:33.000\nDid you know Jurassic World sucked 25 minutes through?\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:34.000\nYes, you did.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:36.000\nThe Four Agreements are pretty good.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:38.000\nI'm one agreement in.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:44.000\nThe guy says, animals only pay for a mistake one time\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:47.000\nin their whole life, one time for each mistake.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:49.000\nHumans are the only animal that pays a thousand times\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:51.000\nfor each mistake.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:54.000\nThat's the stupidest.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:57.000\nIs that because animals die if they make a mistake?\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:58.000\nThey get eaten?\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:00.000\nNo, he's not being a Darwinist.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:04.000\nHe's saying animals just let it go.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:06.000\nWell, yeah, they let it go, yeah.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nNo, they learn from their mistakes.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:09.000\nYeah, they learn once.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:11.000\nThey learn the first time, so do we,\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:15.000\nbut then we pay for the same mistake a thousand times.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:18.000\nOh my god, you guys, it's not that fucking weird.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:20.000\nHumans have anxiety.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:24.000\nWe fucking belabor our mistakes over and over again.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:25.000\nRaccoons don't.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:28.000\nThey make a mistake when they're getting your garbage\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:30.000\nand their pockets hurt on the garbage can lid,\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:32.000\nand they go like, ow, that hurt, done.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:35.000\nThey don't sit there three years later and go,\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:36.000\nI'm such a fuck up.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:38.000\nI'm such a fuck up.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:43.000\nBecause they're brain to the size of ping pong balls\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:44.000\ncompared to it.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:46.000\nWell, we could learn a thing or two,\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:48.000\nor unlearn a thing or two from a creature\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:50.000\nwith a brain the size of a ping pong ball.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:52.000\nWe can't learn anything from a ping pong ball\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:56.000\nsize brain.\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:58.000\nA parakeet sister impacts its unreflection,\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:01.000\nI guess, in a big fight until the beak breaks.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:03.000\nBut then it learns, you know?\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:06.000\nIt doesn't make that mistake again.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:08.000\nParakeets don't learn shit.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:10.000\nFuck parakeets.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:12.000\nI'm coming down hard on parakeets, you guys.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:15.000\nI'm going to do what my therapist taught me to do.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:22.000\nSo that's the other thing.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:25.000\nSo we all, I have a shame button.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:41.000\nIs it called your dick?\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:44.000\nAnd can I push it?\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:45.000\nIt is my dick.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:48.000\nIt's called my shame button.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:52.000\nI have a shame button, and it can get put.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:54.000\nOur buttons get pushed by other people,\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:56.000\nbut it's not their fault.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:58.000\nIt's our deal, like your buttons get pushed,\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:00.000\nand then you don't have to react to it.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:03.000\nSo if something makes you feel like a classic fight\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:06.000\nthat I would have with Erin, believe it or not,\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:09.000\nwould stem from like, if I take a nap and I wake up\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:11.000\nand there's like six texts, she's going,\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:12.000\nwhere are you?\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:13.000\nWhat's going on?\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:14.000\nWhat's happening?\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:16.000\nThen I would have my shame button pushed\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nbecause I would be like, oh, I did something wrong\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:20.000\nas a husband, because I didn't respond\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:22.000\nto the first five texts.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:24.000\nThen I'd be like, why don't you calm down?\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:26.000\nIt's only been an hour, like trying to fix her?\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:31.000\nInstead of just going like, phew.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:34.000\nHey baby, I was just taking a nap.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:37.000\nThis is breathing, it turns out, that's it.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:42.000\nSeems like it was right under my nose.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:44.000\nHey, you can even do it with your nose.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nYeah.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:49.000\nI'm not going to let that get to me.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nThe word play.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:52.000\nAnyways.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nI usually have to take a couple deep breaths.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:55.000\nJust one, not enough for me.\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:57.000\nNo, it's not just, well, I mean,\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nit could be just one, like in a conversation,\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:01.000\nlike if you were hanging out at a bar or something\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:02.000\nand somebody like said something,\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:04.000\nthe minute you feel yourself,\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.000\nsee the goal is, you got to keep your shamed tube\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:10.000\ntotally empty, like your nervous system, like...\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:15.000\nI'm not going to look at him or...\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:21.000\nI don't even know.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:25.000\nShe never even said shamed tube, I just...\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:28.000\nDid you just empty your shamed tube?\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:30.000\nIf you push my...\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:32.000\nI'll be right back, I have to empty my shamed tube.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:35.000\nThe shamed tube will empty.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:38.000\nYou got to, like, your nervous system,\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:40.000\nyou know, so you go from zero to ten,\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:43.000\nlike, and I'm usually at a five,\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.000\nwhich is bad because if I'm at a five\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:47.000\nand somebody pushes my shamed button,\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:49.000\nI'm going to go to six and then right up to ten,\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:52.000\nlike, it's always been like a binary switch for me.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:54.000\nBut instead, four times a day, Jeff,\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:56.000\nI'm supposed to take four deep breaths\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nout of four, four counts on an inhale\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:00.000\nand four counts on the exhale,\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:02.000\nfour times, four times a day\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:08.000\nfor a total of 16 four-second breaths.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:12.000\nAnd that's it, and now I'm going to be sane.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:13.000\nIt's going to work.\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:14.000\nHave you done your breath today?\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:15.000\nI didn't, today.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\nI mean, Erin's out of town\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:20.000\nand I was just playing video games.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:21.000\nI was just playing video games all day.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:23.000\nI don't need to breathe for that.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.000\nIt's like I'm getting mad at a dragon\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:28.000\nor something and be like, fuck you.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:29.000\nThat's what you're supposed to do.\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:30.000\nIt's what we call playing the game.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:32.000\nCould it be fucking hotter up here?\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:33.000\nIt's very hot.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:36.000\nSorry, sorry.\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:37.000\nUh, I'm supposed to...\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:38.000\nOkay, look.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:40.000\nAll right, I'm supposed to tell people\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:42.000\nsix seasons in an Emmy.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:44.000\nI'm supposed to, like, spread the word.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:45.000\nIt's really embarrassing.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:46.000\nI don't want to ask for an Emmy.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:47.000\nI'm not Seth MacFarlane.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:48.000\nI just...\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:53.000\nI don't know.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:54.000\nI mean, if that's grown,\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:56.000\nI mean, he literally did at one point.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:58.000\nBut I kind of don't blame him, I guess,\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:00.000\nbecause at a certain point it's like,\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:01.000\nwhat do you have to do?\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:02.000\nAsk for it?\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:03.000\nI'm not going to ask for it,\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:04.000\nbut Yahoo deserves it\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:05.000\nbecause they spent a lot of money\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:06.000\nin an Emmy campaign.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:08.000\nAnd they're the ones asking me to do it,\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:09.000\nand I don't want to say no to them\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:11.000\nbased on some weird integrity I have.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:12.000\nSo I'm just saying, like,\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:13.000\nI don't know how that helps.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:14.000\nWhat is everybody going to run out\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:15.000\nto the Emmy factory?\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:16.000\nI don't understand.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:17.000\nI don't...\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:18.000\nI don't...\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:19.000\nI thought you're supposed to get the...\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:20.000\nhave one if your show's good.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:21.000\nI don't...\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:22.000\nI don't like this...\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:23.000\nI don't like life.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:24.000\nI don't like this world!\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:29.000\nIs there a way...\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:30.000\nare they hoping that...\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:31.000\nthat becomes a hashtag\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:32.000\nor a trending thing?\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:33.000\nThat that will get...\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:34.000\nYeah, and I guess it's...\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:35.000\nI don't know what...\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:36.000\nI don't know what...\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:37.000\nDid the Emmys respond to that?\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:38.000\nIs it that...\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:39.000\nI don't know what the Emmys respond to.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:40.000\nI don't know.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:41.000\nI don't know.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:42.000\nI had a...\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:43.000\nI had a...\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:44.000\nI had a...\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:45.000\nI don't know if...\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:46.000\nI don't know if Danny Poody\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:47.000\nwould appreciate me repeating the story,\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nbut he said he was hanging out all night with...\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:52.000\nhe'd met a friend of a friend who was, like,\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\non, like, the Emmy committee or something,\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:55.000\nand they were having a great time,\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:57.000\nand they had dinner with their mutual friends,\n\n17:57.000 --> 17:58.000\nand they're all hanging out,\n\n17:58.000 --> 17:59.000\nand they had a big, long dinner,\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:00.000\nand they're all joking around,\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:01.000\nand getting along,\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:03.000\nand then they went dancing afterward,\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:04.000\nand they're out in the dance floor,\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nand the person finally comes up to him\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:08.000\nafter talking to him all night,\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:09.000\nand this is, like, it's like,\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nby the way, I just gotta ask you, like,\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:13.000\nwhat does it like to work with Amy Poehler?\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:18.000\nThought he was the Z's and sorry all night.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:19.000\nAll night.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:25.000\nThey thought he was a Z's and sorry all night.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:29.000\nI think that's how the Emmys work for you.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nI don't know.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:33.000\nI hear that story, and I go,\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:37.000\nI don't think it's gonna happen for us.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:38.000\nBecause isn't it really what it is\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nas it's voting for...\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:41.000\nDid you see Parks and Rec when the guy Emmys\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:43.000\nwhen they thought it was Danny Poehler?\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:46.000\nThat's... I want a recount.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:47.000\nEverybody who's...\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:49.000\nI want to know which brown guy\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:52.000\ndid you think you were voting for.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:54.000\nI want everybody to follow up ballot.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:55.000\nWe have friends that are on TV\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:56.000\nlike do commercials,\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:57.000\nand you go,\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:58.000\nhey, I love your course like commercial,\n\n18:58.000 --> 18:59.000\nand they go, it's Bud Light.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:01.000\nAnd the thing is, like, people in advertising\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:03.000\nknow that Bud Light commercials\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:05.000\ndon't sell Bud Light in particular.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:06.000\nThey sell beer.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nA Toyota commercial doesn't necessarily\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nsell Toyotas, it sells cars.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:11.000\nYou are not gonna buy a Toyota\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nif you weren't already gonna buy a Toyota.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:14.000\nIf you were in the market for Mercedes-Benz\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:17.000\nor a Chevy or whatever,\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:19.000\ncar commercials remind you about cars.\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:21.000\nApparently Danny Poehler reminds them\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:25.000\nabout brown people.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:27.000\nThat's his job.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:28.000\nAlright, well anyways,\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:30.000\nI hate this fucking watch,\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:33.000\nand I hate my life,\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:34.000\nand I hate myself.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:35.000\nAre you a prisoner of the watch right now?\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:36.000\nYes, I hate it.\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:37.000\nI hate the watch.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:38.000\nI hate it.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:39.000\nI hate the watch.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:40.000\nIt's a stupid product.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:41.000\nDon't buy it.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:42.000\nIt's dumb.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:44.000\nIt's a tiny little shitty iPad on your wrist.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:46.000\nThe Bluetooth sucks from your phone.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:47.000\nIt's supposed to...\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:48.000\nIt fucking doesn't work.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:49.000\nIt's dumb.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:51.000\nDo you have to have your phone on you\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:52.000\nfor the watch to have Bluetooth?\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:53.000\nOf course you do.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:54.000\nIt's garbage.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:55.000\nIt's a garbage product.\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:56.000\nThat's pretty brave, man.\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:57.000\nWhat?\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:58.000\nYou're admitting, you know,\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:00.000\nthat you got it?\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:01.000\nIt was silly.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:02.000\nWell, I kind of...\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:03.000\nI mean, I knew it would be.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:04.000\nIt's not that brave.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nI think it's very brave.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:08.000\nYou know...\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:15.000\nHow are these tweets?\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:18.000\nI mean, all your tweets are dumb, too.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:20.000\nIs it the heat that's getting to your head?\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:21.000\nYeah, it's really hot up here.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:23.000\nI feel like it's dripping down my face.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:24.000\nI feel like a pig.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:25.000\nI've been very irritable the last couple of days.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:26.000\nI don't know what it is.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:27.000\nI think it is the heat.\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:28.000\nI don't like when it gets hot.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:30.000\nThe cops shot a guy at the eyeball\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:31.000\noutside Schrab's place.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:32.000\nYeah.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:34.000\nI heard he was flagging the cops down\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:35.000\nwhen they shot him?\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:37.000\nYeah, he was asking for help.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:38.000\nHe said he needed help.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:40.000\nHe had a towel wrapped around his arm,\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:41.000\nand the cops said there was a gun in the towel,\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:43.000\nso they shot him in the eye,\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:44.000\nand then handcuffed him.\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:46.000\nSo they had to believe that he was saying,\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:48.000\nhelp me, help me while aiming a gun\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:50.000\nwith the intent to fire on them,\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:52.000\nwhich is just an insane belief.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.000\nGodfather II style with the silencer.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:56.000\nI guess they didn't want to...\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:57.000\nI don't know what I mean.\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:59.000\nLook, being a cop is a hard job,\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:03.000\nand the guy did have a gun.\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:04.000\nHe didn't.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:05.000\nThey turned out he didn't.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:06.000\nOkay, well, okay.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:07.000\nThat's fucked up.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:09.000\nSo they looked at the towel\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:10.000\nand thought that's a gun?\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:12.000\nYeah, I mean, here's the thing,\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:14.000\nis that I smoke a lot of pot.\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:19.000\nI've seen people that turned out to be mailboxes.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:23.000\nYou know, the human brain can shift items\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:25.000\nand make them look really crazy,\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:27.000\nbut you shouldn't like fire a weapon\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:29.000\nbefore you make sure that you're seeing\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:30.000\nwhat you're seeing,\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:33.000\nbecause everyone's brain fucks up.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:34.000\nYeah.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:35.000\nOn the flip side of that,\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:38.000\nwe never talked about that guy outside the...\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:39.000\nthat gallery.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:41.000\nI can't even remember where it was now.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:42.000\nIt was in Austin, some place in Texas.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nThey're having that dumb gallery\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:46.000\nwhere they're having the draw-mahabit contest,\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:48.000\nand the guy showed up in the sedan,\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:49.000\nand they had assault rifles,\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:51.000\nand they were going to head into the gallery,\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:54.000\nand there was one cop on duty outside the place,\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:56.000\nand they shot them both.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:57.000\nYeah.\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:59.000\nIt's like a weird Western story.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:05.000\nHe took them both out under a rain of assault rifle fire,\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:08.000\nlike shot them both dead.\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:09.000\nIt's badass.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:10.000\nYeah.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:13.000\nAnd so he and the two guys were the only casualties, right?\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:16.000\nWe can be pretty sure that he probably saved\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:18.000\n30 people's lives or so.\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:19.000\nI mean, at least, yeah.\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:26.000\nWell, I mean, sometimes cops shooting people is great.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:29.000\nIf they were about to shoot more people,\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:33.000\nI don't know what the fuck to think about this cop stuff.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:35.000\nI think it's so weird that our phones started\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:37.000\nbeing able to pick up on this stuff,\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:40.000\nbut I don't think our phones got sophisticated\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:44.000\nat the same time as cops started being crazy brutal.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:47.000\nNo, the underclass has cameras on them at all times,\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:49.000\nand they get to film their friends being shot\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:50.000\nin the back and shit.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:52.000\nSo it's been happening all the time.\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:55.000\nIt's been going on forever and ever and ever.\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:58.000\nNow, the underclass and not rich people\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:00.000\nhave access to footage and shit.\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:02.000\nSo I had a pinch, and you guys are going to go,\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:03.000\noh, this is stupid.\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:04.000\nYou're stupid.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:05.000\nYou're dumb.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:06.000\nOh, I like this one.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:07.000\nI don't care.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:08.000\nFuck you.\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:09.000\nIt's your problem.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:10.000\nYou push that button.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:11.000\nI don't care.\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:12.000\nYou're made of smoke.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:13.000\nI'm made of light.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:18.000\nI'm a quarter through the book,\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:21.000\nand I'm reasonably certain I've got it.\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:23.000\nOther people don't smoke?\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:25.000\nIf I say so.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:29.000\nAnd they're glue.\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:31.000\nHere's my pitch.\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:35.000\nSo here's the problem is that the cops look like,\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:36.000\nthey look like enforcers.\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:38.000\nThey're wearing black.\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:40.000\nThey have guns on their hips.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:43.000\nThey go into these terrible situations.\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:45.000\nThey never know what they're getting into.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:47.000\nThey're all jacked up.\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:50.000\nThe people that they're visiting are not having their best day.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:51.000\nNever.\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:54.000\nYou're never a cop talking to someone who's having a good day.\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:57.000\nThey're always, like, all, you know,\n\n23:57.000 --> 24:00.000\neverything is a fucking powder keg,\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:01.000\nand everyone's got a gun.\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:03.000\nSo here's my pitch.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:04.000\nAll right.\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:08.000\nSo special branch of the police force\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:12.000\ncalled the peacekeepers, okay?\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:15.000\nHead to toe, white spandex.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:17.000\nNo weapons.\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:19.000\nCameras all over them.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:23.000\nAnd, like, fingerprint sensors, too.\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:26.000\nBecause the rule is if you touch one of them,\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:28.000\nautomatic lethal injection.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:31.000\nLike, let alone if you shoot one or anything.\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:33.000\nI didn't think you were going to go in that direction.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:36.000\nWell, it has to be backed up.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\nLike, the peacekeepers or white spandex\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:41.000\nseemed a lot more laissez-faire than that.\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:43.000\nThey are laissez-faire because if you touch one,\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:44.000\nyou are fucked.\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:46.000\nLike, you're dead.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:47.000\nYou might as well...\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:48.000\nI mean, there's problems with this pitch,\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:51.000\nbut we'll refine it.\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:53.000\nWhat if you're falling over and you accidentally, like,\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:54.000\nyou need help?\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:55.000\nYou're nitpicking the wrong thing\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:57.000\nbecause I haven't finished my pitch.\n\n24:57.000 --> 25:00.000\nSo the point is they have no gun.\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:01.000\nThey have no gun.\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:03.000\nSo when you see these guys, you know,\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:04.000\nthey don't have a gun.\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:06.000\nIt's not their job to, like...\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:07.000\nThey don't even have handcuffs.\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:09.000\nIt's not their job to shoot you\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:11.000\nor arrest you or anything.\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:12.000\nIt's their job to...\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:14.000\nThey have conflict training\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:18.000\nand they get paid $700,000 a year\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:21.000\nbecause they'll probably die within a week of...\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:23.000\nBut that's capitalism.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:26.000\nIt's like, hey, $700,000 a year\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:28.000\nand you're probably going to die.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:30.000\nAnd so whenever there's a police call,\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:32.000\nthey're the first ones in\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:35.000\nand they come in and they go, hey,\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:37.000\ntake it easy.\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:38.000\nI'm a peacekeeper.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:39.000\nWhat's going on?\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:40.000\nI just want to know.\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:42.000\nI just want to help out.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:44.000\nAnd they have to have that accent.\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:46.000\nI like this.\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:47.000\nAnd then, like...\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:48.000\nBut then again, if you...\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:49.000\nTo answer your question,\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:51.000\nif you've fallen and accidentally touched them,\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:54.000\nyeah, lethal injection.\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:55.000\nAnd I know you're going to ask,\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:57.000\nwell, wouldn't that give rise to a generation\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:58.000\nthat would murder people\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:01.000\nby pushing them into peacekeepers?\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:03.000\nI'm way ahead of you there.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:05.000\nThat was my next question.\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:10.000\nThey're also going to be floating beholders.\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:12.000\nYeah.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:15.000\nThat watch in case that happens.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:17.000\nSo if that happens...\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:20.000\nIf that happens, poison darts\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:21.000\nat the person that pushed.\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:23.000\nA floating beholder has poison darts?\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:24.000\nYeah.\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:26.000\nIf you see those things coming...\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:28.000\nRaise of disintegration, sure.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:31.000\nPoison darts, I don't know.\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:33.000\nIt's not that beholder.\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:34.000\nIt's named after them.\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:35.000\nThey're just called beholders\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:36.000\nand have poison darts.\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:37.000\nYeah.\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:38.000\nOkay, that explains...\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:40.000\nIs anyone else imagining Jim Rash\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:41.000\nas a peacekeeper?\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:42.000\nYeah.\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:47.000\nBecause that's who I keep thinking of.\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:48.000\nBut somewhere in there\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:49.000\nis the germ of a good idea.\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:50.000\nYeah.\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:51.000\nBecause the...\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:52.000\nAs you and I were discussing...\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:53.000\nWe were talking about this.\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:54.000\nThe actual problem is that...\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:56.000\nWell, the way to break the cycle\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:58.000\nis that the community think about...\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:00.000\nThink about police as being there\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:02.000\nto actually help.\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:04.000\nEvery time you see them,\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:06.000\nyou're just like, oh, fuck.\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:07.000\nUnless you're...\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:08.000\nUnless you're like...\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:09.000\nI mean, if you're terrified\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:10.000\nfor your fucking life.\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:13.000\nWhich also needs to be mentioned.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:14.000\nJesus Christ, man.\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:15.000\nAs soon as you get the shit\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:16.000\nscared out of you,\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:17.000\nand sometimes when the cops show up\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:18.000\nand they're nice,\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:19.000\nand you're like, holy fuck.\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:20.000\nThank God for the police.\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:21.000\nThere was somebody I saw\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:22.000\nthat made a very interesting point\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:24.000\nthat they showed the picture\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:26.000\nof an asshole that shot all the people\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:28.000\nat the church in South Carolina.\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:31.000\nAnd he's got a bullet per vest on.\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:33.000\nHe's being escorted very quietly\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:34.000\nand casually to a car.\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:36.000\nAnd then a black guy down on the ground\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:37.000\nfor selling cigarettes\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:38.000\nwith three cops on top\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:40.000\nand strangling him.\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:41.000\nThat guy died.\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:44.000\nThere's different ways of being arrested.\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:46.000\nAnd we treat the little white guy\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:48.000\nthat kills a bunch of fucking people\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\nfor no good reason.\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.000\nWith a lot of respect\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:53.000\nand a lot of courtesy\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.000\nand a lot of care.\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:56.000\nIt's absolutely crazy.\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:57.000\nWhat was with the bullet?\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:58.000\nWere people really afraid\n\n27:58.000 --> 27:59.000\nhe was going to get shot\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:01.000\nlike walking to the police car?\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:02.000\nLike Captain America\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:05.000\ndidn't get a bulletproof vest.\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:07.000\nOh, they put a vest on him?\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:10.000\nYeah, to walk him like in public.\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:11.000\nOstensibly because they don't want\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:12.000\nhim to die before we can find out\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:13.000\nwhy he did it\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:15.000\nand get the dope on him.\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:16.000\nBut I don't think that happens\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:18.000\nto black suspects.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:19.000\nI don't think we get them\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:20.000\nthe bulletproof vest\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:21.000\nand the perp walk\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:22.000\nin front of all the media and

hearing\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:29.000\nwhere he wanted the families\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:30.000\nof the shooter\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:32.000\nto make sure that we all knew\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:33.000\nthat they were victims too.\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:34.000\nThat was a little cynical,\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:35.000\nI thought, in front of...\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:36.000\nWait, what?\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:37.000\nI didn't get that.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:38.000\nThe families of the victims\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:40.000\nwere all allowed to make a comment.\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:41.000\nWell, they put this guy\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:42.000\non a video arraignment\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:43.000\nor whatever it was,\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:44.000\nlike a pretrial kind of thing.\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:45.000\nAnd the guy said,\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:46.000\nlet's not forget it\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:47.000\nwith the family of the shooter?\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:48.000\nOh boy.\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:49.000\nBoy.\n\n28:52.000

coming from on that\n\n28:58.000 --> 28:59.000\nwhen it was like,\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:00.000\nbelieve me,\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:01.000\nwe're all victims\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:02.000\nof a crime like this\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nand let's not all go crazy.\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:05.000\nI don't think anybody\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:06.000\nwas going to go crazy.\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:07.000\nI think that guy just wanted,\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:08.000\nthat judge just wanted\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:10.000\nto be kind of a hot shot.\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:11.000\nHe was on camera,\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:12.000\nso he was going to have\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:13.000\na movie moment\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:14.000\nwhere he made sure\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:15.000\nthe white family of this\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:16.000\nwhite little fucking pecker\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:18.000\nwould cunt fucking,\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:20.000\nwas taken care of.\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:23.000\nYeah, I said pecker would

30:00.000\nThe thing that...\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:01.000\nIt's like a white guilt.\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:02.000\nThe thing that...\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:07.000\nHe wasn't even white.\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:10.000\nYeah, he was Italian.\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:12.000\nAnd don't let Italians\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:14.000\nconvince you they're not white.\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:17.000\nA lot of them will try\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:18.000\nto make you think they're not.\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:19.000\nThey're not.\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:20.000\nThat's the first thing\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:21.000\nan Italian's

your ratio.\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:39.000\nThat's your job.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:41.000\nThat's your racially designated job\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:43.000\nis to kick turtles\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:47.000\nand blow fireballs out of your nose.\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:50.000\nSorry, it's some stereotypes are true.\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:55.000\nNow, what I was going to say was that\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:56.000\nit's like,\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:57.000\nyou think that bumps me out\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:58.000\nwhen shit like that happens\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:00.000\nis actually how, like,\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:02.000\nhow...\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:06.000\nhow used to it\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:08.000\nthe black community is?\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:11.000\nI always project\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:13.000\nonto when shit like this happens\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:15.000\nwhere it's totally racially hot,\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:18.000\nI always put myself\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:19.000\nin the shoes of someone\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:21.000\nthat's part of this category\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:22.000\nand affected by this,\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:24.000\nand then always with\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:27.000\nthe African-American community,\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:28.000\nit's just like,\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:29.000\nthat's the fucking saddest part of it,\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:31.000\nis that they're not as mad\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:33.000\nbecause they're just like,\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:34.000\nwhat the fuck did you think\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:36.000\nthis world was?\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:39.000\nLike when Kramer said the N-word on stage,\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:40.000\nit was like, wow,\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:41.000\nthat's a big deal,\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:43.000\nand they're like, no, it's not.\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nAnd I'm like, oh, God, Jesus Christ,\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:46.000\nit's just fucking...\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:47.000\nAnd then this happened,\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:49.000\nand it's like, there's no riots,\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:50.000\nthere's no...\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:51.000\nThis is not...\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:52.000\nBut let's say\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:53.000\nblack community got up\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:54.000\nand got really pissed off\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:55.000\nand started rioting, then what?\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.000\nExactly, that's the thing is,\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nthey, now I'm dehumanizing\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:00.000\nby talking about they,\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:01.000\nbut I'm saying they,\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:03.000\nthat community knows\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:06.000\nthat that's the greatest thing\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:08.000\nthey could do for racism,\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:09.000\nis to react,\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:11.000\nand it's like this fucking horrible syndrome.\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:13.000\nIt's like, we figured out\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\nSwiss army knives of oppression\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:16.000\nbecause the butcher knife\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:18.000\nstopped working in the 1800s,\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:19.000\nso now we've got it down\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:20.000\nto fucking corkscrews\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:22.000\nand little can openers.\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:23.000\nThat little asshole\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:24.000\nsaid he wanted to try\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:25.000\nto start a race war in America,\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nand I hope that he did\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:29.000\neverything he could to make sure\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:30.000\nthat that never happens,\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:33.000\nbut actually the opposite happens from that.\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:34.000\nThat even like anybody\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:35.000\nthat might have been on the racial fence\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:36.000\nand that one is pushed\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:38.000\nto the side of decency\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:39.000\nand like, Jesus Christ.\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:40.000\nI think the only hope...\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:41.000\nAt times we gotta...\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:42.000\nWe gotta...\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:44.000\nWe gotta realize\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:46.000\nthat this whole thing is a dodge.\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:48.000\nAll this race shit\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:50.000\nis just a distraction\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:52.000\nfrom the class warfare.\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:53.000\nIt's just a...\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:55.000\nAll it is is just poor people.\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:56.000\nTheir worst nightmare\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:57.000\nis all poor people\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:58.000\nfeeling the same way\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:00.000\nbecause then if there's that\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:02.000\nand then there's also democracy,\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:04.000\nthen it's legal to overthrow.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:06.000\nAnd as long as all the poor people\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:08.000\nare like, you're a racist,\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:10.000\nyou're a sexist, you're a pedophile.\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:12.000\nSee, stop judging the pedophiles.\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:14.000\nI

the pedophiles were flying.\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:36.000\nI guess I gilded the lift.\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:37.000\nReally?\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:39.000\nYou made it too real all of a sudden.\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:40.000\nI guess because the protagonist\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:42.000\nsigned off on it, is that what it was?\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:43.000\nOkay.\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:44.000\nAlright.\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nLet's just random one of your tweets.\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:50.000\nI just...\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:52.000\nI like flying pedophiles a lot.\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:55.000\nCan't that be the title?\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:57.000\nFly Pedophiles.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:01.000\nPedophiles!\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:02.000\nDive!\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:03.000\nPedophiles!\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:04.000\nPedophiles!\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:05.000\nDive!\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:06.000\nI got a red Flash Gordon again.\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:07.000\nThat would be so good.\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:10.000\nDan, can you validate me?\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:12.000\nNo, I can't because these fucking tweets\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:13.000\nkeep coming in.\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:15.000\nSorry, whoever that was, you're validated.\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:18.000\nIs that a parking thing?\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:23.000\nWhat else was I going to talk about?\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:24.000\nOh, hey Spencer.\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:25.000\nHey.\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:26.000\nHow's your...\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:28.000\nAre you twitching now?\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:29.000\nOh yeah, I'm twitching.\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:30.000\nSpencer's twitching.\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:32.000\nI really got to get it looked at.\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:34.000\nIs that a new dance move?\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:35.000\nOh yeah.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:37.000\nSpencer got us equipment.\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:39.000\nI haven't hooked mine up, but...\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:41.000\nso that we could show people our Minecraft worlds,\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:44.000\nlike on YouTube and whatnot, or...\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:45.000\nYeah.\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:46.000\nOr Twitch.\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:47.000\nOr on Twitch.\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:48.000\nOn Twitch.\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:51.000\nAnd so the Twitch puts it on the YouTubes?\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:53.000\nYou do that yourself, actually.\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:54.000\nIt's not...\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:56.000\nSo Twitch is a thing.\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:59.000\nIt's like YouTube for video games and live.\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:02.000\nIt's the weirdest social phenomenon in the world.\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:05.000\nSo you can stream your video game play?\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:06.000\nYeah.\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:08.000\nAnd people are positively...\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:10.000\nIt's actually working.\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:12.000\nPeople like to watch other people play video games.\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:15.000\nI would have never predicted that.\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:17.000\nAnd they tip them and stuff?\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:18.000\nIt's...\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:19.000\nI mean, I don't know.\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:20.000\nThey tip you?\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:22.000\nI feel the same thing about sports though, right?\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:23.000\nIt's like...\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:25.000\nWhy are people watching people play sports?\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:26.000\nWell, that's...\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:27.000\nYeah, I mean...\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:28.000\nYeah, but...\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:29.000\nYeah, I don't...\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:31.000\nI think it's probably that same human impulse, probably.\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:32.000\nI don't know.\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:34.000\nBut yeah, the thing I can't...\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:35.000\nBut yeah...\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:36.000\nOkay.\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:37.000\nIt's a lot of fun.\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:39.000\nSpencer, do you watch other people twitching?\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:41.000\nNo, I think that's hilariously dumb.\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:46.000\nSo, I mean, not if you're watching me, of course.\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:48.000\nThat's the best thing you could do.\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:50.000\nBut you put your stuff out there and do you have a following now?\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:52.000\nI mean, there's four or five people, yeah.\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:54.000\nI don't do it for them.\n\n36:54.000 --> 37:00.000\nI do it to feel like I'm wasting less time when I'm wasting time.\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:02.000\nBecause now you've become entertainment for other people.\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:03.000\nI mean, yeah.\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:05.000\nNow it's actually doing something.\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:07.000\nIt's not just going into the past.\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:10.000\nSo people sit and watch you in Minecraft and you're moving little blocks around?\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:11.000\nYeah.\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:12.000\nAnd sometimes I'm singing.\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:13.000\nI'll sit and watch for hours.\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:15.000\nI'll watch Minecraft tutorials and stuff.\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:18.000\nBecause there's just so many mods and then people...\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:20.000\nI'll go like, how the fuck do these wires work or whatever?\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:22.000\nAnd then some guy will have a thing.\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:24.000\nIt goes like, hello, I'm Mr. Pasty Pets.\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:26.000\nI'm going to show you how wires work.\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:27.000\nOh, look over here.\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:28.000\nYou see, I've put a one-way switch.\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:32.000\nYou have to put it at the top of the block and never put it facing the north or it won't work.\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:33.000\nI mean, I don't know why that is.\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:34.000\nI've sent a blood report to the author.\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:36.000\nYeah, so anyways.\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:39.000\nThey do characters and stuff.\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:41.000\nBut they show you how shit works.\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:42.000\nIs that what you do?\n\n37:42.000 --> 37:44.000\nAre you showing people how you...\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:45.000\nNo, I'm just fucking...\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:46.000\nI'm just playing it.\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:50.000\nI'm just playing it and people ask me questions and I answer their questions.\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:54.000\nIs it like a weird sort of voyeurism where they're watching Spencer's mind at work?\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:55.000\nI mean, I guess.\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:56.000\nI don't know.\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:58.000\nWell, like I said, I think it's the sports thing.\n\n37:58.000 --> 37:59.000\nAnybody here follow somebody else?\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:00.000\nYou in the front row?\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:02.000\nYou watch people twitching?\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:03.000\nLong time to twitch, yeah.\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:04.000\nReally?\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:05.000\nYeah.\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:09.000\nIf you're sitting at work and you can't play but you want to watch a game.\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:11.000\nSo which games do you watch?\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:12.000\nI watch League of Legends.\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:13.000\nI watch Minecraft sometimes.\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:15.000\nHearthstone, Lopla, Hearthstone.\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:17.000\nYou watch people play Hearthstone?\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:18.000\nYeah.\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:19.000\nHearthstone is like...\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:20.000\nIt's a hard game.\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:24.000\nIt's a hard game and you watch strangers play it against each other.\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:27.000\nWell, you watch the stranger playing against somebody.\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:28.000\nUh-huh.\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:29.000\nWait.\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:34.000\nIt might be a stranger or they might be playing someone you know.\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:35.000\nOh, okay.\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:37.000\nAll right.\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:41.000\nI'm fascinated by the fact that it's like...\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:43.000\nDoes that kind of scratch the same image for you?\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:44.000\nWhat's your name, by the way?\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:45.000\nScala.\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:46.000\nWe'll grab a mic real quick.\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:48.000\nOh, that means I get to sit down.\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:51.000\nScala, come on up.\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:56.000\nScala be twitching.\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:58.000\nHave you or do you ever watch sports?\n\n38:58.000 --> 38:59.000\nGod, no.\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:00.000\nHuh?\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:01.000\nGod, no.\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:03.000\nSo you don't watch a baseball game?\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:07.000\nDo you think that scratch is the same sort of itch that somebody who likes football?\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:08.000\nI would assume so.\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:09.000\nYeah.\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:10.000\nIt's a spectator sport.\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:11.000\nYeah.\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:12.000\nYeah.\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:13.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:14.000\nI want there to be more here.\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:16.000\nNo, I can't figure it.\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:20.000\nI mean, I've had Superman explain to me and I get it now.\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:22.000\nThat's a lot of pressure.\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:27.000\nBut the thing I haven't done is I haven't gotten on Twitch and actually tried this.\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:32.000\nBut Spencer, when you're twitching, as the kids call it...\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:34.000\nAnd you're doing exclusively Minecraft.\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:36.000\nAre you talking to people?\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:37.000\nYeah.\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:39.000\nSo like there's a chat room and I see it on my phone.\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:43.000\nSo people are like, oh, what color is your house going to be?\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:45.000\nAnd then I'll be all like, I don't know, maybe red.\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:47.000\nAnd they're like, I'd like blue.\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:49.000\nAnd then I'd be like, okay.\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:50.000\nYou know.\n\n39:50.000 --> 39:52.000\nSo and I think there is some, I don't know.\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:55.000\nI think people get something from the interaction.\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:59.000\nAnd also I think it's kind of like podcasting where it's like you're interacting with this\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:04.000\nperson kind of in this very limited sense where you're sort of exposing yourself to them.\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:09.000\nIt's very easy, but very distant and controlled interaction.\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:10.000\nIt's a community.\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:14.000\nLike it's just like the show is really people watching the podcast through the streaming\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:15.000\nand stuff like that.\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:19.000\nBut with like now that I know that Spencer is a Twitch, I'll totally watch Spencer play Minecraft.\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:20.000\nYay.\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:21.000\nWell, I would too.\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:23.000\nCan I watch you watch Spencer play Minecraft?\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:25.000\nThat's going to be the new thing.\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:26.000\nWe could do Twitchception.\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:28.000\nI want to be in the room.\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:30.000\nI want to be physically in the room while you watch it.\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:31.000\nSure.\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:34.000\nOh, I want to stand there in white spandex.\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:35.000\nBut I can't touch you.\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:36.000\nI can't touch you.\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:37.000\nYou're fucking dead, Jack.\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:38.000\nYou'd be dead.\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:41.000\nI really wanted this to happen where I could touch you, but.\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:45.000\nAll right.\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:47.000\nYou can touch my floating beholders.\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:48.000\nOh, all right.\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:52.000\nWith their disintegration rays on their anti-magic fields.\n\n40:52.000 --> 40:55.000\nIt's an important aspect of anti-magic fields.\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:57.000\nIt's the scariest part.\n\n40:57.000 --> 40:58.000\nDon't forget.\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:00.000\nYou lose all your bonuses.\n\n41:00.000 --> 41:01.000\nIt's terrible.\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:02.000\nYeah.\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:03.000\nAll right.\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:06.000\nSo what do you play when you play?\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:07.000\nYou play Hearthstone.\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:10.000\nYou play the things you watch?\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:15.000\nThe last time I streamed Twitch, where I was producing Twitch that people could watch,\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:17.000\nI played a game called Magica 2.\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:22.000\nAnd it's where four wizards cast spells cooperatively where your spells can hit each other.\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:25.000\nSo you blow each other up and yell at each other a lot.\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:30.000\nSo we just went through the whole game in one sitting, but all yelling at each other on\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:31.000\na couch.\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:32.000\nWe got the cops called on us.\n\n41:32.000 --> 41:33.000\nIt was really good experience.\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:34.000\nDamn.\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:35.000\nIt was fucking rager.\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:42.000\nI understand the idea of like, I would, if I had time, I would want to, that's why I\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:44.000\nasked you to look into getting this stuff.\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:47.000\nBecause I wanted to be one of these guys who has like a YouTube video.\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:52.000\nBut like, I wanted to have control over, like I want to go, hello, it's me, Dan.\n\n41:52.000 --> 41:55.000\nSnakebite69 or whatever.\n\n41:55.000 --> 42:00.000\nI just wanted to show you my automatic irrigation system or something over here.\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:01.000\nSo you don't want to stream.\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:04.000\nYou want to produce content that you have edited and then voiced over.\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:09.000\nI'm nervous about the idea of people watching me in real time because if I'm playing Minecraft,\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:14.000\nlike, and I stack up some blocks and then I'm just like sitting there.\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:15.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:16.000\nSomeone's watching.\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:17.000\nNo, it's a nightmare.\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:19.000\nYou, I'm just going to be the guy that took this.\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:23.000\nOn your screen, you're seeing people comment like, bad block placement.\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:26.000\nAll you quit watering the plants, you dick.\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:27.000\nAre you?\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:30.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:34.000\nI would say that you playing Minecraft and having a community watching you and like\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:36.000\nmessaging you like, oh, you should go over there.\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:38.000\nThat looks like there's goats or something.\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:42.000\nLike it probably way more interesting than watching you look at your phone in front of\n\n42:42.000 --> 42:43.000\na mic or look at your watch.\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:44.000\nCheck Twitter.\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:45.000\nAll right.\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:49.000\nOh, shit.\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:50.000\nTake a deep breath.\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:53.000\nTake a deep breath.\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:57.000\nIt's it's a lady sitting up here speaking to one of my heroes criticizing him looking\n\n42:57.000 --> 42:58.000\nat his Twitter.\n\n42:58.000 --> 43:04.000\nLike, like that's what I'm saying.\n\n43:04.000 --> 43:10.000\nI'm just checking my tweets because I'm excited for my tweet hate mail.\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:12.000\nI'm excited for that.\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:13.000\nNo, it's fine.\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:17.000\nLook, if you're like, look, it's a bad show and it's not a bad show.\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:18.000\nThat's not what I'm saying.\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:21.000\nI think you took the wrong thing out of what I was trying to say.\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:25.000\nI'm saying that this is a I'm saying that this is a beautiful thing that people care\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:28.000\nabout and can watch and still enjoy.\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:30.000\nAnd Minecraft can be that also.\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:31.000\nOh, right.\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:34.000\nWell, yeah, I mean, but I but there's no wrong.\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:36.000\nThere's no wrong way to do it.\n\n43:36.000 --> 43:37.000\nThat's what I'm trying to say.\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:38.000\nIt's like a Reese's.\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:39.000\nYeah.\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:40.000\nThere's no.\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:43.000\nThere's no wrong way to eat a Reese's.\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:44.000\nThank you, Spencer.\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:45.000\nThank you.\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:46.000\nYou're welcome.\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:52.000\nThere's probably a wrong way to eat it.\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:53.000\nForget to unwrap it first.\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:54.000\nThat's the wrong way to do it.\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:55.000\nNo, that's fine.\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:56.000\nThat's fine.\n\n43:56.000 --> 43:59.000\nThis guy says snake bite 69 should be the name of the title.\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:00.000\nI don't know.\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:01.000\nNo, pedophiles.\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:02.000\nFuck you, buddy.\n\n44:02.000 --> 44:03.000\nFuck you.\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:04.000\nI like this.\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:07.000\nI like this voting on the title with the audience.\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:09.000\nSnake bite 69.\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:12.000\nIt's just the the difficult thing is every time they said, OK,\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:13.000\nsomeone said, don't give up.\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:14.000\nOK.\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:21.000\nOh, but I but I think they I think they meant on race race relations\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:24.000\nbecause it was eight eight minutes ago.\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:27.000\nMaybe it was like, don't give up on white people.\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:29.000\nDon't give up on your peacekeepers pitch.\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:30.000\nYeah.\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:33.000\nWell, somebody I'm terrified of your peacekeeping.\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:37.000\nYeah, because they're going to get cocky and arrogant and they're going to be like,\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:39.000\nwhy don't you touch me, bro?\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:42.000\nAnd they'll like be forcing you up against the corner.\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:47.000\nIf two people walked in right now, let's say it's a man and a woman and their peacekeepers\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:51.000\nand they're wearing white spandex, we'd all fucking be bummed out because you're like,\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:53.000\nlike, what if you touched them and you'd be dead?\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:54.000\nYou don't know what's going on.\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:55.000\nWell, that's because that's that's your signal.\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:57.000\nEverybody fucking cool it, man.\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:58.000\nYeah, but that's horrifying.\n\n44:58.000 --> 45:01.000\nWell, yeah, but they don't have guns and they don't have handcuffs.\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:06.000\nIt's horrifying the way if like if an angel came down, like it doesn't.\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:07.000\nIt doesn't.\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:08.000\nIt's not.\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:09.000\nIt's potentially very horrifying.\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:13.000\nIt's it's it's it's disruptive and it's and it's put hits the reset button.\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:14.000\nOh, shit.\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:15.000\nFucking the fucking.\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:19.000\nWhat is the vetting system for becoming a PC heavy?\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:22.000\nYou have to be willing to get killed on the first week of work.\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:25.000\nYou have the ability to run through a crowd and kill 30 people.\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:26.000\nAll right.\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:33.000\nWell, no, no, the vetting system is you have to have had six years of of of of conflict\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:34.000\nresolution training.\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:35.000\nOkay.\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:39.000\nYou have to have a liberal arts degree.\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:49.000\nYou have to know Tai Chi just only to balance your your soul or or Chi.\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:56.000\nIn light not to hurt people just to just to just to be calm when people are killing you\n\n45:56.000 --> 45:58.000\nbecause you're going to die.\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:01.000\nBut then over time, what's that?\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:04.000\nIf you touch an opportunity, that doesn't matter.\n\n46:04.000 --> 46:07.000\nThey wouldn't be wearing their spandex.\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:10.000\nWell, is that true?\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:13.000\nIf you he says if you kill an off duty cop, there's a higher penalty.\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:17.000\nWell, I guess I guess given what yeah, I guess we're not shocked.\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:18.000\nWe got to go back.\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:19.000\nI mean, we got to work.\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:20.000\nIt's a good idea.\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:22.000\nWe just got to work out the kinks.\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:25.000\nI think they should be robots.\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:26.000\nThat's what we need.\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:27.000\nWe need those chappy robots.\n\n46:27.000 --> 46:30.000\nYeah.\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:33.000\nBut I don't think that would calm anybody down.\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:37.000\nThey wouldn't like well, they probably would.\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:41.000\nYou know, recognize weapons and stuff.\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:43.000\nBritish British.\n\n46:43.000 --> 46:44.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:47.000\nHe's saying the British Bobby doesn't carry a fire.\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:48.000\nOh, right.\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:49.000\nBut don't they kind of do now?\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:55.000\nAren't there some?\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:57.000\nBut they'll beat the shit out of you.\n\n46:57.000 --> 46:59.000\nLike it's fine.\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:03.000\nBut they're more famous in Europe and the UK.\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:05.000\nThe shit out of people.\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:09.000\nFor like actually like casually disarming people and like talking it out.\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:10.000\nOh, it's amazing, man.\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:14.000\nI saw a video of a guy with a machete who was swinging a machete around.\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:17.000\nThey just kept bringing more cops and some guy hit him with a chair.\n\n47:17.000 --> 47:18.000\nNo one.\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:20.000\nNo, no, no guns got fired.\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:21.000\nNo one got hurt.\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:22.000\nLike the guy got arrested.\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:23.000\nIt was awesome.\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:25.000\nPolice.\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:28.000\nIt can be done.\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:34.000\nI tell you that when we were there for Hogmany in Scotland and I bumped into a cop.\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:39.000\nAnd it was like New Year's Eve and everyone's drunk and I bumped into a cop.\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:45.000\nAnd the cop went, oh, excuse me.\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:48.000\nI think I ran around a corner and puked.\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:52.000\nI was just like so nervous.\n\n47:52.000 --> 47:54.000\nI was like, I can't believe that just happened.\n\n47:54.000 --> 47:58.000\nOur first night in Edinburgh, you guys had checked into our little apartment there.\n\n47:58.000 --> 48:00.000\nAnd Kate and I were parking a car and getting luggage out of the car.\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:05.000\nAnd we parked right underneath like literally like the street below the Edinburgh Castle.\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:07.000\nLike in the shadow of the big castle there.\n\n48:07.000 --> 48:14.000\nAnd we parked on the road and the meters, you have to go to a little kiosk, get a receipt, put it in your car.\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:18.000\nYou can buy a bunch of time on it, but what you can't do is feed the meter.\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:21.000\nLike you can't go back in the middle of the night and add more time on that.\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:23.000\nYou have to actually move your car or whatever.\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:26.000\nIt's a pretty good system, I guess, except we didn't have any.\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:28.000\nYou have to put coins and you can't put a card in.\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:29.000\nSo we didn't have any.\n\n48:29.000 --> 48:32.000\nSo we walked up to a cafe to get some money.\n\n48:32.000 --> 48:36.000\nAnd the time that we did that, because we had to buy something, we came back, we're getting a ticket.\n\n48:36.000 --> 48:41.000\nNow in Los Angeles, I don't know about living in other parts of the country, the US,\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:43.000\nthe moment they're out of the car, you're getting a ticket.\n\n48:43.000 --> 48:48.000\nThe moment they start typing your license in, you have a ticket whether you drive off in a fury.\n\n48:48.000 --> 48:52.000\nThere was this cop there and he's writing this up and Kate's like, oh no, no, no, no, no.\n\n48:52.000 --> 48:53.000\nAnd she's, you know, she's Scottish.\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:57.000\nSo she was like talking to him in the Scottish falsetto because they all talk in a falsetto.\n\n48:57.000 --> 49:00.000\nLike, oh, no, no, no, no.\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:04.000\nAnd the guy just put his little computer thing in his pocket and walked away.\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:06.000\nAnd she's like, do we have a ticket?\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:08.000\nHe's like, no, on you go.\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:09.000\nAnd she's like, really?\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:12.000\nAnd she's like, yeah, sorry, on you go.\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:14.000\nPut your money in there and go.\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:17.000\nAnd so she does that and I'm like getting stuff out of the car.\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:20.000\nAnd the cop was doing his thing and looking around in other cars and he walks by.\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:22.000\nAnd it's like, it's just after Christmas, right?\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:25.000\nOr maybe it was just Christmas when we were there.\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:27.000\nAnd I said, thank you very much, by the way.\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:32.000\nI'm from Los Angeles where if someone starts writing you a ticket, you have a ticket.\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:37.000\nAnd he goes, yeah, but we're nice here.\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:40.000\nMerry Christmas.\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:47.000\nAnd then the Lactis Master came out and just fucking ate him.\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:50.000\nAnd you were like, what?\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:53.000\nAnd then it pulled back and you were outside like this lab.\n\n49:53.000 --> 49:58.000\nWhat?\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:03.000\nI was just punching it up and had third act problems.\n\n50:03.000 --> 50:07.000\nIs Darsan, are you here?\n\n50:07.000 --> 50:08.000\nDarsan?\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:12.000\nOh, did I slightly pronounce one vowel wrong?\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:13.000\nWow.\n\n50:13.000 --> 50:16.000\nDarsan?\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:17.000\nDo you want to come up here?\n\n50:17.000 --> 50:19.000\nDo you want to chat?\n\n50:19.000 --> 50:22.000\nNo, you're staying.\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:24.000\nWhat's your name, Twitch lover?\n\n50:24.000 --> 50:25.000\nSkyler.\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:26.000\nSkyler.\n\n50:26.000 --> 50:27.000\nThat's a pretty name.\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:29.000\nDarsan, everybody.\n\n50:29.000 --> 50:32.000\nDarsan!\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:40.000\nCommunity fans may know Darsan as Black Dave from season five who rose to prominence in season six.\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:47.000\nThey came down to you and Vicky and what's his name?\n\n50:47.000 --> 50:49.000\nThe guy that made out with my wife.\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:50.000\nGarrett.\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:51.000\nGarrett.\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:54.000\nYeah, because we lost Neil.\n\n50:54.000 --> 51:00.000\nAnd then we call you guys our Muppets because you're not regulars.\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:03.000\nYou're kind of like, but you're not background and you're not guest stars.\n\n51:03.000 --> 51:04.000\nYou're kind of like always there.\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:05.000\nMuppets.\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:06.000\nMuppets.\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:07.000\nYeah, Muppets.\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:08.000\nDehumanizing.\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:09.000\nI'll take it.\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:11.000\nYeah, it's better than Black Dave.\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:13.000\nBetter than Black Dave.\n\n51:13.000 --> 51:17.000\nIt's just still somewhat dehumanizing, but I guess Muppets is less dehumanizing.\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:18.000\nYeah, no.\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:20.000\nMuppets and Black Dave, they're both neat.\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:21.000\nCome on.\n\n51:21.000 --> 51:22.000\nNo.\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:27.000\nThey're both neat.\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:30.000\nYou're Jewish though, right?\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:31.000\nYeah, I am.\n\n51:31.000 --> 51:37.000\nYou're sorry you were telling me in the green room, your mom's Jewish, your dad's...\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:40.000\nYeah, my mom's Jewish, my dad's, he's Black.\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:43.000\nAnd he was like...\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:46.000\nYour dad was like a rambling man, right?\n\n51:46.000 --> 51:49.000\nIf there's anything you don't want to talk about, you don't have to talk about it.\n\n51:49.000 --> 51:55.000\nOkay, so basically I was telling my dad that my dad's from Trinidad and he came from when\n\n51:55.000 --> 52:00.000\nit was still owned by Britain, so he kind of came out with a British accent because\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:04.000\nfor whatever reason he thought that actually talking like you were from Trinidad was really\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:08.000\nimproper and all his family is like what the fuck you're crazy and they all talk with\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:14.000\na Caribbean accent, so it's more like we might be out somewhere and because Black people\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:20.000\nsay hi to other Black people, it's like that's a thing.\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:22.000\nSo somebody would see him.\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:24.000\nIf you walk in the street, is he another Black guy?\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:26.000\nYeah, we'd just be like, sup.\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:27.000\nRight.\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:31.000\nIs that just a courtesy thing or is that a cultural thing?\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:34.000\nI honestly don't know, I just have accepted it.\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:39.000\nYou guys better not be up to something.\n\n52:39.000 --> 52:40.000\nJeff, it's 9-11.\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:43.000\nIt's a code, is it?\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:44.000\n9-11.\n\n52:44.000 --> 52:45.000\n9-11.\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:47.000\nIt's 9-11.\n\n52:47.000 --> 52:57.000\nBlack people are up to something!\n\n52:57.000 --> 53:01.000\nDon't ever forget these numbers.\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:05.000\nThese numbers are so important.\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:13.000\nThey make the difference between good and bad.\n\n53:13.000 --> 53:18.000\nDon't ever forget these numbers.\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:26.000\nThese numbers will make the difference when you go to bed at night and pray.\n\n53:26.000 --> 53:30.000\nTweet, tweet, boop, boop, take a deep breath, stretch.\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:37.000\n9-11 is going to be the number I remember.\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:43.000\n9-11 is going to live forever in my mind.\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:47.000\nChee, chee, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop!\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:57.000\nWow!\n\n53:57.000 --> 53:59.000\nPedophiles dive!\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:02.000\nPedophiles dive!\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:06.000\nI'm glad you cut it off because I was about...\n\n54:06.000 --> 54:11.000\nOsama Bin Laden was about to do a rap break.\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:16.000\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n54:16.000 --> 54:23.000\nGive the people what they want, dad.\n\n54:23.000 --> 54:31.000\nMy name's Osama Bin Laden.\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:36.000\nMy name's Osama Bin Laden.\n\n54:36.000 --> 54:37.000\nEverybody!\n\n54:37.000 --> 54:40.000\nOne, two, three, come on, come on.\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:42.000\nMy name's Osama Bin Laden.\n\n54:42.000 --> 54:44.000\nI don't eat salad, I eat ramen.\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:46.000\nI live in a cave.\n\n54:46.000 --> 54:53.000\nI'm all the rage till you got me with your zero dark 30 by whispering my name.\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:57.000\nToot, toot, beep, beep, night vision.\n\n54:57.000 --> 54:59.000\nYou whispered my name.\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:02.000\nI thought you were a little girl in trouble,\n\n55:02.000 --> 55:04.000\nwalked into the doorway and got shot in the face.\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:05.000\nI deserved it.\n\n55:05.000 --> 55:06.000\nI deserved it.\n\n55:06.000 --> 55:09.000\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, I deserved it.\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:11.000\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:13.000\nMy name's Osama Bin Laden.\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:15.000\nMy name is Osama.\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:17.000\nI've come to see your power.\n\n55:17.000 --> 55:22.000\nHe owes me five dollars from when I bode his law.\n\n55:22.000 --> 55:27.000\nLast week, I have a funny hat.\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:33.000\nMy God is funny too.\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:36.000\nMy name's Osama Bin Laden.\n\n55:36.000 --> 55:38.000\nWait, can I explain what I meant?\n\n55:38.000 --> 55:40.000\nMy name's Osama Bin Laden.\n\n55:40.000 --> 55:43.000\nToo late, too late.\n\n55:43.000 --> 55:45.000\nListen, no.\n\n55:45.000 --> 55:48.000\nI meant my version of it.\n\n55:48.000 --> 55:52.000\nThe extreme version.\n\n55:52.000 --> 55:55.000\nWhoa, my name is Osama.\n\n55:55.000 --> 55:58.000\nI think it's hot in here.\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:03.000\nI'm gonna go in my car and drive around and get a beer.\n\n56:03.000 --> 56:04.000\nCan I have a beer?\n\n56:04.000 --> 56:07.000\nNo, that's illegal here.\n\n56:07.000 --> 56:11.000\nGonna park my car and get out and get a beer.\n\n56:11.000 --> 56:13.000\nMy name's Osama.\n\n56:13.000 --> 56:15.000\nI live on your fear.\n\n56:15.000 --> 56:18.000\nAnd you, Lloyd Webber, wrote this song.\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:20.000\nI am.\n\n56:20.000 --> 56:37.000\nI didn't mean the Islamic God was funny.\n\n56:37.000 --> 56:42.000\nOsama Bin Laden, Andrew Lloyd Webber, collaboration.\n\n56:42.000 --> 56:45.000\nI like that in the end, he was gonna, yeah, he was gonna,\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:47.000\nI live on your fear.\n\n56:47.000 --> 56:50.000\nI stopped it too soon, man.\n\n56:50.000 --> 56:51.000\nWell, I don't know.\n\n56:51.000 --> 56:53.000\nI don't think I had it in me.\n\n56:53.000 --> 56:58.000\nWe opened in two nights, you guys.\n\n56:58.000 --> 57:00.000\nLook, I mean, there's a lot of feelings around.\n\n57:00.000 --> 57:09.000\nYou came down pretty hard on Islam, there, Dan.\n\n57:09.000 --> 57:12.000\nThat's a pretty bold stance on this day in it.\n\n57:12.000 --> 57:15.000\nI said his God was funny.\n\n57:15.000 --> 57:20.000\nI meant, I meant to God that cares so much that he would,\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:23.000\nthat he would ask you to hurt people.\n\n57:23.000 --> 57:26.000\nSeems silly.\n\n57:26.000 --> 57:27.000\nThat made it worse.\n\n57:27.000 --> 57:29.000\nWhat?\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:36.000\nDrink your weird low and brow 40 ounce.\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:40.000\nIf you don't make eye contact with me, I can't see you.\n\n57:40.000 --> 57:47.000\nHe was like, that made it worse.\n\n57:47.000 --> 57:49.000\nAll right, shit rolls downhill.\n\n57:49.000 --> 57:51.000\nThank you for helping me.\n\n57:51.000 --> 57:55.000\nSo anyways, Jewish mom, black dad, tell me more.\n\n57:55.000 --> 57:59.000\nWhat was Thanksgiving like at that house?\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:02.000\nI think it went a little something like this.\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:08.000\nHey, is this a jive turkey?\n\n58:08.000 --> 58:10.000\nLet me be right back.\n\n58:10.000 --> 58:17.000\nOy vey!\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:20.000\nYou know, if that was actually how my Thanksgiving's were,\n\n58:20.000 --> 58:22.000\nI would actually have loved my Thanksgiving's.\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:26.000\nBecause guys from Trinidad always talk about jive turkeys, right?\n\n58:26.000 --> 58:28.000\nYeah, they always talk about jive turkeys.\n\n58:28.000 --> 58:30.000\nAll right, so, all right.\n\n58:30.000 --> 58:35.000\nHow do you know when a turkey is a jive turkey?\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:38.000\nYou have to look at the legs.\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:42.000\nAll right, we're going to play this right this time.\n\n58:42.000 --> 58:44.000\nAre you okay, Skyler?\n\n58:44.000 --> 58:45.000\nI'm amazing.\n\n58:45.000 --> 58:46.000\nOkay, great.\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:48.000\nIf you get uncomfortable, let me know.\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:52.000\nI know it's hot up here and I don't know what I'm doing.\n\n58:52.000 --> 58:53.000\nIt's a bad show.\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:56.000\nIt's all right, it's all right, it's all right.\n\n58:56.000 --> 58:57.000\nI don't want you to come away with that.\n\n58:57.000 --> 58:59.000\nI won't stand for that.\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:00.000\nIt's an amazing show.\n\n59:00.000 --> 59:01.000\nOh, thank you, Skyler.\n\n59:01.000 --> 59:02.000\nThank you.\n\n59:02.000 --> 59:03.000\nI wasn't fishing for that.\n\n59:03.000 --> 59:12.000\nYeah, but this guy watches Minecraft at home.\n\n59:12.000 --> 59:14.000\nHe's our barometer?\n\n59:14.000 --> 59:16.000\nWhat's entertaining?\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:18.000\nIs that helpful?\n\n59:18.000 --> 59:22.000\nIf you knew what Hearthstone looked like.\n\n59:22.000 --> 59:26.000\nHave you been to grassgrow.com?\n\n59:26.000 --> 59:31.000\nYou get to watch real-time grass growing.\n\n59:31.000 --> 59:33.000\nPaintdryers.org.\n\n59:33.000 --> 59:36.000\nWhat exactly does Hearthstone look like?\n\n59:36.000 --> 59:41.000\nIt looks like colored rectangles bumping into each other.\n\n59:41.000 --> 59:43.000\nWith explosions and animations and noises.\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:46.000\nYeah, it's got a lot of noises.\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:47.000\nIt's a card game.\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:49.000\nEach card is a digital card game.\n\n59:49.000 --> 59:51.000\nPeople watch World Series of Poker.\n\n59:51.000 --> 59:53.000\nYeah, I don't get it either.\n\n59:53.000 --> 59:56.000\nThe rectangles don't even bump into each other.\n\n59:56.000 --> 59:58.000\nPeople watch Prairie Home Companion.\n\n59:58.000 --> 59:59.000\nPeople watch this show.\n\n59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000\nPeople watch Community for Six Seasons.\n\n01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000\nBut those are like...\n\n01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000\nThank you.\n\n01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000\nThank you.\n\n01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000\nThank you.\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000\nFour and a half.\n\n01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000\nAnd an Emmy.\n\n01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000\nDon't forget.\n\n01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000\nTell everybody...\n\n01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000\nTell Yahoo!\n\n01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000\nI told everybody to say we deserve an Emmy.\n\n01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:21.000\nTell them Seth MacFarlane sent you.\n\n01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000\nEnter the code, Seth MacFarlane.\n\n01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000\nYeah, they had a campaign a while back that was like,\n\n01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000\nhey, have you noticed Family Guy hasn't gotten an Emmy yet?\n\n01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000\nI actually got those screeners.\n\n01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000\nIt was just kind of passive-aggressively saying to all the voters,\n\n01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000\nyeah, we make you laugh and you don't vote for us.\n\n01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000\nSuck our dicks, watch this episode.\n\n01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000\nAnd did they win one then?\n\n01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000\nI don't recall.\n\n01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000\nThe most blatant one was when the Simpsons Family Guy crossover\n\n01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000\nwhere Homer's throwing Emmys at Peter and Peter goes,\n\n01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000\nhey, no fair, we ain't got none of those.\n\n01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000\nSo that was kind of the most blatant please vote for us.\n\n01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000\nYeah.\n\n01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000\nI don't know how the Emmys worked,\n\n01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000\nbut I think it comes down to other writers having to like me,\n\n01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000\nwhich I think is like, there's no way that's ever going to happen.\n\n01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000\nWhich Emmys do you think you'd be most likely to be nominated for?\n\n01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000\nWell, I always thought that maybe our actors would eventually get\n\n01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000\nat least nominated.\n\n01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000\nI thought that, you know, a while ago that,\n\n01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000\nlike Danny Pooty and...\n\n01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000\nThere was never a nomination?\n\n01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000\nNo, never, never.\n\n01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000\nI'm not bitter, I don't care.\n\n01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000\nI mean, you know, whatever.\n\n01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000\nEveryone has an Emmy.\n\n01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000\nDo you think that the Emmy committee is a little,\n\n01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000\nlike a little hesitant to nominate somebody\n\n01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000\nwho has come down so hard against Islam?\n\n01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000\nBecause that seems justified.\n\n01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000\nThat seems justified.\n\n01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000\nI think having a funny God isn't coming down on the religion.\n\n01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000\nI think God should encompass all.\n\n01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000\nSkyler, don't coddle it.\n\n01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000\nWe know what he meant.\n\n01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000\nI appreciate it, Skyler.\n\n01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000\nI mean, I just want people to be happy.\n\n01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.000\nIf I were a God, I would...\n\n01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000\nBe a lot like Hitler.\n\n01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000\nBut not in a bad way.\n\n01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000\nRight.\n\n01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000\nThe good parts of Hitler.\n\n01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000\nWas it clear what I was trying to say at that point?\n\n01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000\nNo.\n\n01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:20.000\nI was saying, God and Hitler have...\n\n01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000\nWe all have that in common with Hitler.\n\n01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000\nWhat?\n\n01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000\nEverything.\n\n01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000\nThe universe has that in common with Hitler.\n\n01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000\nSelf-loathing?\n\n01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000\nYes.\n\n01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000\nDisatisfaction with the status quo.\n\n01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000\nThere was nothing.\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000\nThe universe was nothingness,\n\n01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000\nand then it exploded into everythingness.\n\n01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000\nSo that means that the nothingness,\n\n01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000\nwhich must have been God,\n\n01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000\notherwise, if something pre-existed God,\n\n01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000\nwhich nothingness would have,\n\n01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000\nthen God wouldn't be God.\n\n01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000\nSo nothingness must also be God,\n\n01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000\nwhich means that God's origin must be nothing,\n\n01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000\nwhich means that God was dissatisfied with his own state.\n\n01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000\nSo he split up and expanded into everything.\n\n01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000\nHe didn't like being nothing,\n\n01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000\njust as Hitler didn't like just being the mayor of Berlin,\n\n01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000\nor whatever he started us.\n\n01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:09.000\nHe was never the mayor of Berlin.\n\n01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000\nHitler was the mayor of Berlin?\n\n01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000\nNever should have...\n\n01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000\nNo one ever talked about that.\n\n01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000\nWhy did they elect this guy mayor?\n\n01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000\nHe was saying, like, if I'm mayor,\n\n01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000\nI will kill all the Jews,\n\n01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000\nand then everyone was like,\n\n01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000\nwell, I'm voting for him\n\n01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000\nbecause he won't have that power as mayor,\n\n01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000\nbut he stands on those potholes outside my house.\n\n01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000\nLike, he's the only guy\n\n01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000\nto keep the trains running out of time.\n\n01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000\nOkay, so...\n\n01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000\nYou're probably like,\n\n01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000\nI'm sure he's just misunderstood.\n\n01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000\nI mean, everybody's mad these days.\n\n01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000\nIt's 1936.\n\n01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000\nMaybe he should be mayor.\n\n01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nWhen Margaret...\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000\nI was just going off about the Jews the other day.\n\n01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000\nYes, you were.\n\n01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000\nYes, you were.\n\n01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000\nAnd we're Jewish.\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000\nHe's got my vote.\n\n01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000\nMayor of Berlin.\n\n01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000\nLever.\n\n01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000\nThey voted with slot machines.\n\n01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000\nI'm glad we took that time\n\n01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000\nfor you to clear that up for us, Dan.\n\n01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000\nI didn't say...\n\n01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000\nWell, I think it's silly that you can't say\n\n01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000\nthat technically God and Hitler\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000\nhad that one thing in common.\n\n01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000\nI just don't know.\n\n01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000\nI mean, for me, I don't know if it was sufficiently clear\n\n01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000\nthat what you were talking about was self-loathing.\n\n01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000\nSo...\n\n01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000\nWell, self-loathing is, yeah,\n\n01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000\nyou hate what you are.\n\n01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000\nI mean, I get it now.\n\n01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000\nYeah, now you get it.\n\n01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000\nI don't get the impression that Hitler hated who he was.\n\n01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000\nI think he hated what he felt had been...\n\n01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nhad been done to him and his country.\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000\nWell, I think...\n\n01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000\nWell, I'm thinking as opposed to being content.\n\n01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000\nHe doesn't seem like a content guy.\n\n01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000\nNo, I don't think contentment\n\n01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000\nwas a real thing after World War I.\n\n01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000\nI think Germany was pretty bummed out about that.\n\n01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000\nOh, it was called The Great Depression.\n\n01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000\nHello!\n\n01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000\nThat was gold.\n\n01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000\nI love it.\n\n01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000\nSorry, it just presented itself.\n\n01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000\nI had to grab it.\n\n01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000\nNow, so...\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000\nDarsan?\n\n01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000\nYeah.\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000\nJust don't say Darsan.\n\n01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000\nDarsan.\n\n01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000\nYour mom's Jewish?\n\n01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000\nYes.\n\n01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000\nDoes that make you officially Jewish?\n\n01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000\nIt does.\n\n01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000\nI'm a Black Jew.\n\n01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000\nAre you practicing?\n\n01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000\nDo you go to temple and whatnot?\n\n01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000\nI did it until my bar mitzvah and I cashed out\n\n01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000\nand I was like, okay, I'm good.\n\n01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000\nThat's pretty Jewish.\n\n01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000\nThat's pretty Jewish.\n\n01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000\nIs that basically like the path of a...\n\n01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000\nThat's like where your typical kind of secular Jew,\n\n01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000\nlike gets to the...\n\n01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000\nBecause that's like a Christian confirmation, right?\n\n01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000\nIt's like, you...\n\n01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000\nWhen you're a kid, like, you're raised in the faith\n\n01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000\nand then it kind of culminates in the bar mitzvah\n\n01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000\nand then you can't, as you say, cash out and...\n\n01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000\nIt's kind of...\n\n01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000\nI was more raised for reform where it was basically\n\n01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000\nand my parents and I kind of decided that temple was really boring.\n\n01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000\nSo we didn't go, but they like sent me to Jewish camp,\n\n01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000\nwhich I learned all my dirty humor\n\n01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000\nbecause I was the only Black person there.\n\n01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000\nAnd then...\n\n01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000\nSo I came back and then the bar mitzvah still seemed like a good idea.\n\n01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000\nDo you have a good Jewish joke for us from Jewish camp?\n\n01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000\nMy God, I've used them so many times.\n\n01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000\nI didn't quite make that connection\n\n01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000\nbecause you were the only Black kid at Jewish camp.\n\n01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000\nDid they all told you their dirty jokes?\n\n01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000\nIt's basically...\n\n01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000\nFor a lot of them, I was the first Black person they'd ever met\n\n01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000\nbecause most of them went to Jewish school.\n\n01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000\nSo they were trying to see what they could get away with\n\n01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000\nand I was so willing to push the envelope\n\n01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000\nthat they got away with everything.\n\n01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000\nLike, they were coming up to you and saying,\n\n01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000\nlike, hey, did you hear the one about the Black guy on the rabbi?\n\n01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000\nOr what were they...\n\n01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000\nCan you give me an example of something really specific you remember?\n\n01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000\nThere are a lot of back of the oven comments.\n\n01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000\nJesus!\n\n01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000\nJesus!\n\n01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000\nGet to the back of the oven?\n\n01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000\nThat came out of the grassy knoll.\n\n01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000\nI'm picturing these 6th grade kids.\n\n01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000\nI'm like, oh, what does your hair feel like?\n\n01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000\nAnd they're like, what?\n\n01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000\nAlso, let's notice...\n\n01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000\nHit play back if you're listening to this.\n\n01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000\nTo the laughter to outrage ratio.\n\n01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000\nIt's because Jewish women are famous for their cooking?\n\n01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000\nIs that the... No, okay.\n\n01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000\nOkay, here's the best example.\n\n01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000\nI want a hundred of these.\n\n01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000\nSo I was talking with my counselor\n\n01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000\nand he was asking me about the origin of my parents,\n\n01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000\nlike how they met.\n\n01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000\nHe was like, oh, who's Black?\n\n01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000\nYour mom or your dad? Because I'm mixed.\n\n01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000\nAnd I said, oh, my mom's White.\n\n01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000\nMy dad's Black. He's from Trinidad.\n\n01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000\nAnd he was asking more.\n\n01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000\nAnd he said, oh, so how did they meet?\n\n01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000\nAnd I said, oh, they had a mutual friend.\n\n01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000\nThey met at a restaurant.\n\n01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000\nAnd he goes, oh, was your dad cleaning up?\n\n01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000\nNow, do you think that...\n\n01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000\nWas he?\n\n01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000\nWas he?\n\n01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000\nIn your memory,\n\n01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000\ndo you think that that kid,\n\n01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000\nyour memory may be wrong and may be right,\n\n01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000\nbut do you remember that\n\n01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000\nthe kid knew what he was doing?\n\n01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000\nOr do you think he was being naive?\n\n01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000\nOr was he really trying to\n\n01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000\nshiv you?\n\n01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000\nWas he being diabolical?\n\n01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000\nBecause it doesn't seem like kids are even smart enough\n\n01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000\nto be that vile.\n\n01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000\nWell, first off, that wasn't a kid. That was my counselor.\n\n01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000\nSo he had a few years on me,\n\n01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000\nso he knew much more about the world than I did.\n\n01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000\nWas he trying to be funny, though?\n\n01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000\nYeah, and it was because I was crying.\n\n01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000\nI was laughing so hard.\n\n01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000\nAll the other staff who heard were just kind of standing there.\n\n01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000\nHe was being like Don Rickles.\n\n01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000\nHe was laying it on you hard.\n\n01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000\nWhich shows a level of respect to deal it out that hard.\n\n01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000\nLet's not give this guy too much of a pass.\n\n01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000\nI think it shows a level of respect\n\n01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000\nfor him to not let it\n\n01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000\npush his button.\n\n01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000\nYou could be a better camp counselor than that.\n\n01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000\nI honestly think racism is hilarious.\n\n01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000\nYou're allowed to.\n\n01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000\nYou have to\n\n01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000\nand are allowed to.\n\n01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000\nWe could use with a few less people\n\n01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000\nthinking it's that hilarious\n\n01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000\nthat they would sell that joke to a kid.\n\n01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000\nYou know, we could condemn this guy\n\n01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000\nand get away with it.\n\n01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000\nHe's a shitty guy.\n\n01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000\nBad, bad, bad, bad move.\n\n01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000\nBad humor move.\n\n01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000\nI love bad humor, so.\n\n01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000\nThat sounds pretty funny.\n\n01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000\nThank you.\n\n01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000\nDo you have any other jokes?\n\n01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000\nBecause there's certain, I don't like racial jokes\n\n01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000\nwhere people lose.\n\n01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000\nI was at a bar a few days ago\n\n01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000\nand everyone at the end of the bar was telling me\n\n01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000\nthe pedophile jokes.\n\n01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000\nThey're usually not funny. It's just gross.\n\n01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000\nHumor when somebody loses\n\n01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000\nis usually a bummer.\n\n01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000\nHowever, there's a rare instance.\n\n01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000\nWhat do you mean by that?\n\n01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000\nThe butt of the joke is because\n\n01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000\nthat guy's black because he's an idiot\n\n01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000\nor because that guy's Polish or because she's a woman\n\n01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000\nor she's blonde or whatever.\n\n01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000\nYou got\n\n01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000\ntwo claps.\n\n01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000\nThat was from a low-embrow guy.\n\n01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000\nIt's from a black Polish woman.\n\n01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000\nI think\n\n01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000\nGracho Marx,\n\n01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000\nthe great Gracho Marx was always approached\n\n01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000\nbecause he was a famous funny person.

have a good schedule.\n\n01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000\nI'm just like, I want to play video games\n\n01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000\nso I'm like, I'm going to play video games\n\n01:17:21.000 -->

know that you're going to do it?\n\n01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000\nI guess.\n\n01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000\nI can technically answer that.\n\n01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000\nI think he can answer that.\n\n01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000\nYou set a schedule.\n\n01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000\nI'm a Minecraft guy.\n\n01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000\nI Minecraft every Monday at 7pm\n\n01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000\nso everyone knows to come on Monday at 7pm\n\n01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000\nto watch me Minecraft.\n\n01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000\nWould you proper dungeon mastering\n\n01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nlike D&D stuff with groups anymore?\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000\nNo.\n\n01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000\nIt's a lot of work.\n\n01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000\nAlso, don't go outside much.\n\n01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000\nSo,\n\n01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000\nnot a joke.\n\n01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000\nBut yeah,\n\n01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000\nno, it's just...\n\n01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000\nYou don't miss doing that?\n\n01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000\nI don't have people that I really play with\n\n01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000\nbut I mean,\n\n01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000\nI do shadow run.\n\n01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000\nIt scratches that itch.\n\n01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000\nI'm doing...\n\n01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000\nI'm making things happen.\n\n01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000\nI don't know, man.\n\n01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000\nNo, I'm not playing Dungeons & Dragons\n\n01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000\nbehind your guys' back.\n\n01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000\nThanks.\n\n01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000\nCops are bad.\n\n01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000\nIslam's bad.\n\n01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000\nWhite people are bad.\n\n01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000\nBlack people are bad.\n\n01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000\nIrish and Jews can give me a break.\n\n01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000\nWitcher 3's load screens are bad.\n\n01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000\nI spoke out in three categories.\n\n01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000\nJewish camp sounds pretty bad.\n\n01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000\nI hope you get some highlighted.\n\n01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000\nActually, you put it that way.\n\n01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000\nSee?\n\n01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000\nWhat else is bad?\n\n01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000\nThe global warming's bad.\n\n01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000\nI'm sweating like a pig.\n\n01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000\nThe heat.\n\n01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000\nThe heat's bad.\n\n01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000\nI have like a puddle of sweat.\n\n01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000\nI have to wring out later.\n\n01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000\nEvernote\n\n01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000\nand the Apple Watch.\n\n01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000\nI ran out of fingers.\n\n01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000\nEverything's bad. Twitter's bad.\n\n01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000\nMy Twitter system's bad.\n\n01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000\nAll you guys are great.\n\n01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000\nOh, shit. Thank you, Steve.\n\n01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000\nSteve just texted me.\n\n01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000\nWe're going to be at Comic-Con.\n\n01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000\nSan Diego on the 12th.\n\n01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000\nIs it July 12th?\n\n01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000\nJuly 12th.\n\n01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000\nBut not at Comic-Con.\n\n01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000\nYou don't have to have a badge.\n\n01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000\nWe're just going to be in the Gaslamp District.\n\n01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000\nSo if you're at Comic-Con,\n\n01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000\nI would say you're probably going to leave Sunday.\n\n01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000\nBut stay a little bit\n\n01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000\nbecause we're going to do a show Sunday night\n\n01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000\nat the Tin Roof\n\n01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000\nin the Gaslamp.\n\n01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000\nAnd I'll keep tweeting the link to buy tickets.\n\n01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000\nBut I'm a little panicked.\n\n01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000\nBecause I figure\n\n01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000\nSunday nights, the night everybody leaves.\n\n01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000\nBut so I'm hoping\n\n01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000\nthat there's a way we can\n\n01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000\njust keep spreading awareness.\n\n01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000\nAnd maybe Armenians that are there for Comic-Con\n\n01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000\nand people that are already in San Diego\n\n01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000\njust be there.\n\n01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000\nBecause the place seats like 500 people\n\n01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000\nand it holds 500 people.\n\n01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000\nSo what are the...\n\n01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000\nLet's cook up something special for them\n\n01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000\nand throw a party.\n\n01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000\nI know we're going to have signable stuff\n\n01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000\nfor Rick and Morty to give away.\n\n01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000\nI mean, I don't know if that's enough.\n\n01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000\nBut I was thinking\n\n01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000\nalso if you're in costume,\n\n01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000\nmaybe we could do some kind of costume thing\n\n01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000\nand have prizes for that.\n\n01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000\nAnd not to eclipse the whole show with that,\n\n01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000\nbut just somebody shows up\n\n01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000\ndressed like a robot.\n\n01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000\nThat would be amazing.\n\n01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000\nI could help you with that.\n\n01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000\nAre you a larper?\n\n01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000\nI do a lot of different ones.\n\n01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000\nBut the one I play currently\n\n01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000\nis a post-apocalyptic zombie larp.\n\n01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000\nSo is that like with paintballs?\n\n01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000\nNo, we use nerf.\n\n01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000\nNerf guns, yeah.\n\n01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000\nAnd then we also use foam swords.\n\n01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000\nIs it larping if you're just shooting\n\n01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000\nnerf weapons at each other?\n\n01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000\nSounds like just playing a game.\n\n01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000\nAt night we're not allowed to fire our nerf weapons\n\n01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000\nbecause our darts get lost,\n\n01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000\nso we have to throw birdseed packets.\n\n01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000\nThat doesn't really address my concern.\n\n01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000\nSo is it,\n\n01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000\ndo you pretend you're sorcerers\n\n01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000\nat that point against the zombies?\n\n01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000\nSome people yell bang.\n\n01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000\nI'm not one of those people.\n\n01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000\nI don't use a sword though.\n\n01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000\nI've never met a larper.\n\n01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000\nWell, I probably have,\n\n01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000\nbut I've never met an openly larping larper.\n\n01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000\nIt is a rare thing.\n\n01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000\nWe are the bottom tier.\n\n01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000\nFurries are right underneath us.\n\n01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000\nLiterally.\n\n01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000\nSometimes right on top.\n\n01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000\nI don't know what larping is,\n\n01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000\nbut I think I know everything I need to know about it now.\n\n01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000\nBut I'm just curious about the,\n\n01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000\nso you guys go out\n\n01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000\nand do a clearing in the woods,\n\n01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000\nand then some people are saying,\n\n01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000\nthey're like throwing.\n\n01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000\nSo for this specific one,\n\n01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000\nI'm just going to stick to this one.\n\n01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000\nWe all head out for a weekend.\n\n01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000\nIt's a three day event.\n\n01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000\nWe go game on,\n\n01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000\nand everyone is in character.\n\n01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000\nThe storytellers will release\n\n01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000\nmobs of 20 to 30 people\n\n01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000\ndressed as zombies to come and attack us.\n\n01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000\nWe will murder those things and take their things.\n\n01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000\nAnd then our system\n\n01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000\nis a hit points based system and armor based system.\n\n01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000\nSo when you swing your weapon,\n\n01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000\nyou yell how much damage you do,\n\n01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000\nand then the person gets hit by it,\n\n01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000\nthey have to calculate their life,\n\n01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000\nand then they fall down if their life goes away.\n\n01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000\nSo when you swing your weapon,\n\n01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000\nso you're like two, two, two,\n\n01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000\nor like ten.\n\n01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000\nYou know what your weapon is,\n\n01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000\nand you know how skilled you are.\n\n01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000\nYou basically have to level up,\n\n01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000\nand then you have to memorize.\n\n01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000\nNo, that works.\n\n01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000\nSo like if it was your first night,\n\n01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000\nyou would yell two.\n\n01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000\nGuns start at three.\n\n01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000\nGuns start at three.\n\n01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000\nYeah, so your first night\n\n01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000\nyou'd be swinging twos or swinging threes\n\n01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000\nif you got a two-hander.\n\n01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000\nI mean, if...\n\n01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000\nYeah?\n\n01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000\nWe have another larp over there?\n\n01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000\nNo.\n\n01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000\nHe just loves golf clubs.\n\n01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000\nExtra hands.\n\n01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000\nOh, he's making golf jokes.\n\n01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000\nBut I did not get that at all.\n\n01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000\nI did not get that at all.\n\n01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000\nHis golf club deals a four.\n\n01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000\nAll right.\n\n01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000\nEverybody cool it.\n\n01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000\nWhat am I funny if he was a black guy?\n\n01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000\nSo then there are...\n\n01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000\nThen there are also powers.\n\n01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000\nSo there's people with like psionic

We were just being assholes.\n\n01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000\nAnd we sprinkled birdseed all over her roof\n\n01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000\nbecause she and her family were out of town.\n\n01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000\nAnd so we put birdseed all over the roof.\n\n01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000\nBut it's California, so it doesn't rain for another three months.\n\n01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000\nAnd the wooden shingles are just this dormant birdseed\n\n01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000\nlaying there.\n\n01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000\nSo three months later, all of a sudden,\n\n01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000\ntheir house is a giant chia pet.\n\n01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000\nThat's amazing.\n\n01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000\nWhy birdseed?\n\n01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000\nBecause you can buy it at a pet food store\n\n01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000\nand you can get a giant sack of birdseed\n\n01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000\nand it sprouts into grasses and plants.\n\n01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000\nWait, was that your intention?\n\n01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000\nOr was your prank to make birds come out of their house?\n\n01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000\nOur intention was to make their shingles grow.\n\n01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000\nOh, and it really works.\n\n01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000\nWhat's the harm of that?\n\n01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000\nThe house looks like the shire.\n\n01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000\nIt looks like Bilbo Baggins.\n\n01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000\nWhy don't we all do that?\n\n01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000\nWhy don't we put birdseed on our roof?\n\n01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000\nThey have little tiny roots.\n\n01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000\nWe'll probably cut into the ceiling.\n\n01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000\nIt's really tough stuff, but it could.\n\n01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000\nCan you have a chia cave in?\n\n01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000\nThis guy knows his birdseed, Dan.\n\n01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000\nIt's been a terrible episode.\n\n01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000\nThat is not true.\n\n01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000\nIt's fine.\n\n01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000\nI don't care.\n\n01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000\nWe should...\n\n01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000\nThe heat's really gotten to you, hasn't it?\n\n01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000\nOkay, so tonight...\n\n01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000\nI can't figure out how to deal with this thing\n\n01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000\nwith Erin, where she keeps...\n\n01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000\nWe keep getting in fights about it.\n\n01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000\nWe're not going to get in fights about it anymore, though,\n\n01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000\nbecause my shame button is going to get pushed\n\n01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000\nand I'm not going to breathe.\n\n01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000\nI knew the fight was going to be about your shame button.\n\n01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000\nBut she won't fucking stop bringing up\n\n01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000\nthe fact that at this point,\n\n01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000\nat the end of the show, when I go,\n\n01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000\nlike, oh, we should get a girl up here\n\n01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000\nbefore we play the game,\n\n01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000\nand Erin keeps saying,\n\n01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000\nboy, I look forward to a day when we don't have to say that,\n\n01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000\nand I'm like,\n\n01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000\nmotherfucker,\n\n01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000\nit's half the species, and it's not like...\n\n01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000\nI mean, you could technically just say,\n\n01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000\ncould we get some up in here and then pick a girl\n\n01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000\nand not say it.\n\n01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000\nThat's dishonest, though.\n\n01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000\nYeah, but who cares?\n\n01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000\nWhat the fuck distinction is that?\n\n01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000\nHow is that progress?\n\n01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000\nThat I'm keeping something to myself?\n\n01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000\nI'd say the simplest way to look at that\n\n01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000\nis that the show tends to be six guys on stage\n\n01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000\nand adding to them an entity to the show\n\n01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000\nis never a bad idea.\n\n01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000\nAnd I was like, I don't know how to...\n\n01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000\nIf Erin's not here, we're going to make it not a big deal.\n\n01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000\nDo I just keep...\n\n01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000\nBecause I can't...\n\n01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000\nI mean, I guess you're right, Skyler.\n\n01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000\nI guess I just have to own all of this\n\n01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000\nfucking my own\n\n01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000\ngarbage, I guess.\n\n01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000\nThe whole point is really to make it...\n\n01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000\nEquality is like make it...\n\n01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000\nIt's just another thing, not a big deal.\n\n01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000\nSo by doing that, it's just another thing.\n\n01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000\nBut where is the bottleneck\n\n01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000\nof the no big deal?\n\n01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000\nIs it in my own brain, like Skyler's saying,\n\n01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000\nwhere I just go, hey, who wants to come up\n\n01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000\nand everyone raises their hand?\n\n01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000\nAnd then, meanwhile, in my head, secret Terminator is\n\n01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000\ndisqualified penis, disqualified penis,\n\n01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000\nmmm, boobies, get up.\n\n01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000\nLike...\n\n01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000\nOr is it more honest\n\n01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000\nor less honest for me to say...\n\n01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000\nWhat is Erin's beef about it?\n\n01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000\nThat it feels like women are\n\n01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000\nlike some kind of\n\n01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000\nyou know,\n\n01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000\nsubhuman like...\n\n01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000\nIt's not like you're saying, oh, we need to get a subhuman up here.\n\n01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000\nThen it's a quota or something.\n\n01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000\nBut it is a quota because there's been any women up.\n\n01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000\nOr women are just people that get\n\n01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000\nto be discluted because of that?\n\n01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000\nAnd then she'll bring up,\n\n01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000\nand then she'll go to, she'll say,\n\n01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000\nwell, yeah, but you don't have a quota, you never say,\n\n01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000\nlet's bring such and such\n\n01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000\nracial group up to which I say,\n\n01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000\nbut race is an artificial construct.\n\n01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000\nLike, there's no, like, I also don't say\n\n01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000\nlet's bring a red-haired person up.\n\n01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000\nBut the, you know,\n\n01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000\nthere's a biological distinction\n\n01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000\nand\n\n01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000\nwomen are not up here all night.\n\n01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000\nI'm\n\n01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000\n42, I can

LARP?\n\n01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.000\nOh, yeah, plug your LARP, dude.\n\n01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.000\nScalers.\n\n01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:26.000\nWell, I realized I just said a bunch of stuff about it, and a lot of the people that play\n\n01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000\nlisten to the podcast.\n\n01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000\nPlug your LARP, baby.\n\n01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.000\nPlug

zombies that dies when people throw birdseed at?\n\n01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.000\nYes.\n\n01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000\nThere is a game here in LA.\n\n01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000\nIt's played at a Renfairee.\n\n01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.000\nHow do you hire those people that come out and just get birdseed?\n\n01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000\nOh, so everybody volunteers.\n\n01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:50.000\nSo every time you come to an event, you do a four-hour shift as an NPC.\n\n01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.000\nSo you do a four-hour shift of being a zombie, and then everyone kind of takes turn at that.\n\n01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:01.000\nSo you have like a 150-person game, and then from there, people will come and shift and\n\n01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000\nbe zombies.\n\n01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.000\nBecause that's what people picked.\n\n01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000\nWe're having a side conversation.\n\n01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000\nYou're trying to plug your LARP.\n\n01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000\nI'm being really disrespectful.\n\n01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000\nIt's called dystopia rising.\n\n01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000\nThere are 13 chapters across the U.S. right now, and it's growing pretty quickly.\n\n01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.000\nYou can probably find, there's a lot on the East Coast, but there's one up in Washington,\n\n01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.000\nwhich is where I'm from, and then also in Oregon, and then there's one here, and then\n\n01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000\nthere's one in Indiana and Texas.\n\n01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.000\nYeah, they're all over.\n\n01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:26.000\nThe one in Indiana is really the best.\n\n01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.000\nIt's pretty good.\n\n01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000\nIt was this past weekend.\n\n01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.000\nI don't know how you knew that.\n\n01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:36.000\nYou know what, the combat part actually makes me kind of anxious, but the idea of going out\n\n01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:41.000\nand going to a big thing where it's like game on, and then you have to be your character,\n\n01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000\nand then you're just walking around like, hello, my name's Lord Fingalberry.\n\n01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.000\nOne of the best.\n\n01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.000\nSo a lot of...\n\n01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000\nI could do that forever, really.\n\n01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000\nA lot of LARPs.\n\n01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000\nBecause I hate myself.\n\n01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000\nSorry, I know.\n\n01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.000\nA lot of LARPs are built around combat, and we call them stick jocks.\n\n01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000\nSo they're guys that just like to hit each other with swords, right?\n\n01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000\nRight.\n\n01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.000\nSo the reason this game is so amazing is because you stay in character from Friday to Sunday.\n\n01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000\nNice.\n\n01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000\nAll night.\n\n01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:11.000\nYou sleep in character, your door can get kicked in, and zombies can fucking murder you.\n\n01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:15.000\nSo what if your character has night terrors?\n\n01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000\nI know characters with sleep apnea.\n\n01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000\nWe have a medical time.\n\n01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000\nShit.\n\n01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000\nWe have a medical time.\n\n01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.000\nSo the thing that's great is the whole universe is dystopian.\n\n01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.000\nYou know players with sleep apnea.\n\n01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000\nYes.\n\n01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:34.000\nAll their characters are possessed by demons.\n\n01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.000\nOh, the power!\n\n01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:43.000\nThat'd be a serious larpher who didn't really have sleep apnea, but his character did.\n\n01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000\nYou got a sleeping character?\n\n01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000\nBut where was I going?\n\n01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.000\nThis game has production, so there are people that don't fight.\n\n01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.000\nThere are people that just produce.\n\n01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:55.000\nThey build things, and there's farmers.\n\n01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000\nThere's engineers.\n\n01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.000\nThere's tinkers.\n\n01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.000\nThey build guns and swords and upgrade armor and stuff like that.\n\n01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000\nAre there people that just hang out and drink?\n\n01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.000\nThere are totally people.\n\n01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.000\nSo we call them technically their murder hobos.\n\n01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.000\nThey don't have jobs.\n\n01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000\nThey don't produce anything.\n\n01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000\nThey just hit stuff, and they just drink.\n\n01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.000\nAre idiots?\n\n01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000\nYeah, not like that.\n\n01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.000\nOh, just hang out?\n\n01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000\nThere's totally people.\n\n01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:18.000\nYeah, but I don't mean like a fratty guy crashing the thing.\n\n01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.000\nCould you be like a barkeep?\n\n01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000\nYes, totally.\n\n01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000\nThere are multiple bars across the U.S.\n\n01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000\nOr like a bar, just in the bar?\n\n01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.000\nYes, there's a profession called the Entertainer, where you just play an instrument.\n\n01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000\nJan, do you want to go do it?\n\n01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000\nDo you stand up comedy?\n\n01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000\nI mean, yeah, I need a free weekend.\n\n01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.000\nI want to do that, and I want to go intertubing, which Erin's doing.\n\n01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000\nSo that's what Erin's doing right now.\n\n01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000\nShe's floating down a river.\n\n01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:41.000\nIt's the best.\n\n01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.000\nRight now?\n\n01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.000\nIt's the middle of the night.\n\n01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:44.000\nNot in St. Louis.\n\n01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000\nYeah.\n\n01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:53.000\nNext time you come up north to like Seattle Portland area, if you want to coordinate,\n\n01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:59.000\nI can get you and have that way I can control how good of an experience it is.\n\n01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000\nI wouldn't be able to send you to another place.\n\n01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:07.000\nSkylar, I've got to warn you, Dan's a bit of a stickjock.\n\n01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000\nWe take all kinds.\n\n01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000\nWe're a very accepting community.\n\n01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000\nWe have 30 seconds to play Shadowrun.\n\n01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000\nWell, to keep in mind, the show starts at 8.20.\n\n01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000\nYeah, it doesn't.\n\n01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.000\nSpencer, do you have a guest recapper for us?\n\n01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000\nNot today.\n\n01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000\nLet me just wing it terribly.\n\n01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:32.000\nAll right, here we are.\n\n01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:36.000\nLast time on Shadowrun.\n\n01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.000\nOur heroes found themselves in a tear gas-filled hospital bed.\n\n01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000\nBut they got out of there pretty quick.\n\n01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:55.000\nDonning the disguises of downed security guards, they scuttled down an elevator and passed a nosy receptionist into a secret underground area.\n\n01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:59.000\nThere they found Baldwin Brown's former office.\n\n01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:03.000\nAnd with it, the research data they were meant to retrieve.\n\n01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:09.000\nBut before they could retrieve it, Baldwin Brown himself hailed our adventurers.\n\n01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.000\nThey're not adventurers in this game.\n\n01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:19.000\nShadowrunners over the comlink, asking to return his research to him.\n\n01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:23.000\nThe gang studied the request before declining.\n\n01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:28.000\nBut as they were leaving, they heard the snitch of blades.\n\n01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:37.000\nJesse Yellowman was here to collect on his employer's collection.\n\n01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.000\nI said it was terrible.\n\n01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.000\nI was not looking for that.\n\n01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:49.000\nNow, Nightblade and the team, why did we say no to Baldwin Brown who wanted his stuff back?\n\n01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000\nBecause we're terrible people.\n\n01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000\nWell, we didn't say no.\n\n01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000\nWe said we'll think about it.\n\n01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000\nWe gotta do a job.\n\n01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.000\nAnd real quick, remind me who Jesse Yellowman is.\n\n01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:04.000\nHe's the young ward of Baldwin Brown.\n\n01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.000\nHe's got blades coming up out of his knuckles.\n\n01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000\nAnd he wants Baldwin Brown's research for himself.\n\n01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:14.000\nWell, he's like, hey, I'm gonna pick it up.\n\n01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.000\nPick up the research.\n\n01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000\nThe easy way or the hard way?\n\n01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:23.000\nWell, kid, the hard way might be the easier way for us.\n\n01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.000\nAnd the easy way may be harder for you than you think.\n\n01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000\nHuh.\n\n01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:34.000\nYeah, I'm not a mathematician, but there's like a thousand of us.\n\n01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000\nYou sure aren't.\n\n01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000\nI cast level 5 stun ball on him.\n\n01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.000\nAlright, level 5.\n\n01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000\nOkay.\n\n01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:49.000\nYou take three drain.\n\n01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000\nYou go unconscious as you unleash a stun ball.\n\n01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000\nIt wings him in the face.\n\n01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000\nJesus, that wasn't worth it.\n\n01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.000\nHe looks dazed as if he's been dazed,\n\n01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:03.000\nbut you are unconscious from the strain of repeated spell casting.\n\n01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000\nI should have asked what my drain was before I did that.\n\n01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000\nYep.\n\n01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.000\nAlright, kid, can you hear me?\n\n01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.000\nCan you hear me?\n\n01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000\nSomebody heal me?\n\n01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000\nYeah, man.\n\n01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000\nWe didn't say we weren't going to...\n\n01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000\nI already took out one of your guys.\n\n01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000\nOh, come on, man.\n\n01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000\nThat's not fair.\n\n01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:22.000\nWe didn't say we weren't going to work with your guy,\n\n01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000\nbut you can't...\n\n01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000\nYou know, if you're going to fight us, we're going to fight you.\n\n01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.000\nOh, sorry.\n\n01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.000\nOkay.\n\n01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000\nI just...\n\n01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:31.000\nWhat's happening right now?\n\n01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000\nWhat's happening is we got the files.\n\n01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000\nWe got to get the fuck out of this place.\n\n01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000\nFighting each other isn't going to...\n\n01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.000\nIt's not a good idea.\n\n01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.000\nMaybe you should have said that before your friends started fighting at me.\n\n01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000\nI think she just fell on the ground.\n\n01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000\nHow much are they paying you?\n\n01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.000\nThey're not paying me nothing.\n\n01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000\nI do it for the love of the job.\n\n01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000\nThat's unfortunate.\n\n01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:53.000\nWell, then I'll double your price to help us get out of this building\n\n01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.000\nand then we can fight in the street.\n\n01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000\nWell, I really need this research.\n\n01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.000\nWe can't let it get out of my hand.\n\n01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:02.000\nYou should pick her up and carry her out of here.\n\n01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.000\nI can do that.\n\n01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000\nI'm a troll.\n\n01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000\nYou do that.\n\n01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000\nYou easily heft her up on your shoulder.\n\n01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000\nYes.\n\n01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000\nHe's supposed to have Jeff's folder, right?\n\n01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.000\nYeah.\n\n01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000\nOkay.\n\n01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.000\nOh, shit.\n\n01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.000\nI was playing the wrong character.\n\n01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.000\nWell, you said you were like, I'm going to play Dimorph.\n\n01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000\nI'm Horde God.\n\n01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.000\nI forgot.\n\n01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.000\nYeah.\n\n01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000\nI don't cast a spell.\n\n01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000\nI said it.\n\n01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.000\nNo.\n\n01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.000\nNo one's unconscious.\n\n01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000\nNo one's unconscious.\n\n01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:36.000\nI don't cast a spell.\n\n01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:44.000\nIs it possible that I maybe look at a thing and perhaps maybe French fries?\n\n01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000\nWait, where the fuck is Dimorph?\n\n01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.000\nHe is here.\n\n01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000\nIs Dimorph here?\n\n01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000\nDimorph was in the green room.\n\n01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000\nDimorph, get out here.\n\n01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000\nWell, then we've got to kick someone out.\n\n01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000\nNo, no.\n\n01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.000\nHe can play himself.\n\n01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.000\nI'll just sit here.\n\n01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000\nDimorph's round.\n\n01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:01.000\nWhat?\n\n01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:11.000\nYou know, it's okay, Dan.\n\n01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:19.000\nI was thinking at the time that we were in Edinburgh and I was going up with Nipsey Russell and his friends.\n\n01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.000\nAnd you were caught up in a melee of some sort.\n\n01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.000\nAll right.\n\n01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:24.000\nSorry.\n\n01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.000\nSo let's go.\n\n01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.000\nI forgot you were here.\n\n01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.000\nDon't worry, man.\n\n01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.000\nIt's not my game.\n\n01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.000\nOkay.\n\n01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000\nSo where were we?\n\n01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000\nWe're going to get the fuck out of here.\n\n01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.000\nYeah.\n\n01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.000\nHere we go.\n\n01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000\nNo one's unconscious.\n\n01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000\nWho's?\n\n01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.000\nNo one's unconscious?\n\n01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000\nAre we doing a do-over on that?\n\n01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000\nYeah, because, yeah, he was controlling the wrong character.\n\n01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000\nAll right.\n\n01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.000\nSo here we all go.\n\n01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000\nBlade, blade handguide, everybody.\n\n01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.000\nWhere are we going?\n\n01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.000\nWe're leaving.\n\n01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.000\nWhere?\n\n01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000\nIn an Uber.\n\n01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.000\nOkay.\n\n01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:57.000\nWe've got to go upstairs first, past all these dead bodies.\n\n01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000\nYou've killed people?\n\n01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.000\nYeah.\n\n01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.000\nI mean, I wasn't really.\n\n01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:03.000\nThis was more of a hit-and-run sort of thing.\n\n01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.000\nNot really.\n\n01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000\nHey, Hakai.\n\n01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.000\nYes.\n\n01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.000\nI'm on the com link.\n\n01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:14.000\nDid this guy set off a bunch of alarms when he murdered all of these guards to get down here?\n\n01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.000\nNo.\n\n01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.000\nHe's a real pro.\n\n01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.000\nThat's excellent.\n\n01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:18.000\nThank you.\n\n01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.000\nBut they will find the bodies soon.\n\n01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.000\nFox.\n\n01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000\nSoon amount of time.\n\n01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.000\nAll right.\n\n01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.000\nWell, let's go.\n\n01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000\nAnd everyone stop asking how.\n\n01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.000\nIt's obviously the way we came.\n\n01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000\nWhy do you keep asking that?\n\n01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000\nThe way we came.\n\n01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000\nWe leave.\n\n01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000\nWe leave the way we came.\n\n01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:38.000\nBack out past the lady, into the elevators, back up, and out the exit.\n\n01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000\nHolder guard takes the lead.\n\n01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:45.000\nUsing his combat sense and all of his sensibilities leads them through to the front.\n\n01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.000\nUp the stairs, around a couple floors and to the front.\n\n01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000\nStepping over the bodies.\n\n01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:56.000\nIf you follow his actions, perhaps you will get there safely as well.\n\n01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000\nI follow him.\n\n01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:06.000\nFollowing closely, you dodge the detection of guards with the combat senses of horticard.\n\n01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:14.000\nYou end up in the front hallway, but there you hear a voice behind you.\n\n01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000\nStop.\n\n01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.000\nStop you.\n\n01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.000\nTurning around, you see 17 guards.\n\n01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000\nThey're a good 60 feet off.\n\n01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000\nIt's a long, long hallway.\n\n01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:28.000\nYou've made pretty good time considering.\n\n01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.000\nIt's all right.\n\n01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:30.000\nI'm a guard.\n\n01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.000\nNo.\n\n01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.000\nWhat?\n\n01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.000\nI'm dressed.\n\n01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.000\nI'm dressed as a guard.\n\n01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.000\nI'm a guard.\n\n01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.000\nCan I make a force wall?\n\n01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000\nYeah.\n\n01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:42.000\nHow strong of a force wall do you want to make?\n\n01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000\nFrom one to six.\n\n01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.000\nFive.\n\n01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000\nOh, shit.\n\n01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000\nThat's a good number.\n\n01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000\nIt really is.\n\n01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:58.000\nDrawing upon your troll magic, you conjure up a shield of shimmering energy.\n\n01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:08.000\nIt stretches across the entire hallway, coating it in light and force energy.\n\n01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000\nNow we can run.\n\n01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000\nI'm using my city sense.\n\n01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.000\nI have a sense of Uber.\n\n01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000\nIt's how far away?\n\n01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:19.000\nYou can sense an Uber just two blocks away.\n\n01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:22.000\nThis technology is really, really good.\n\n01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000\nIt's a skill soft.\n\n01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:29.000\nIf you were addicted to them as I am, you would apply them and use them to their best benefit.\n\n01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.000\nHey, I'm not really a guard.\n\n01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.000\nYou fuck faces.\n\n01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000\nWe're behind a force field.\n\n01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000\nJust wearing guard clothes.\n\n01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:42.000\nHodergaard leads the gang outside.\n\n01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.000\nThose that will follow.\n\n01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:48.000\nThose that want to talk trash, well, you know.\n\n01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.000\nYou guys go.\n\n01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.000\nI'm just leaving last, walking backwards.\n\n01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:57.000\nMy arms spread like a cocky seagull talking shit.\n\n01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000\nI assure them that everything is okay.\n\n01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.000\nThis is common.\n\n01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:04.000\nHe often uses the monologue defense to protect his people.\n\n01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000\nWho are you saying that to?\n\n01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000\nTo the rest of the gang that is following.\n\n01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000\nGood, good, good, good.\n\n01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000\nFuck you guys.\n\n01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.000\nI wasn't a guard.\n\n01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000\nFooled you.\n\n01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:20.000\nMaybe we shouldn't tempt fate and just get in the Uber.\n\n01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.000\nWell, go, just go.\n\n01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.000\nYeah, I'm just saying.\n\n01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000\nI'm walking out backwards and talking shit.\n\n01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.000\nYeah, there you are.\n\n01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:31.000\nBy the way, I didn't kill all those people.\n\n01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000\nThe door is closing.\n\n01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000\nIs everyone in?\n\n01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.000\nEveryone's in the Uber, including Jesse.\n\n01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:39.000\nSolid.\n\n01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.000\nSweet.\n\n01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:43.000\nAnd we motor off.\n\n01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000\nWhere are we going?\n\n01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:49.000\nTo our secret clubhouse.\n\n01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:53.000\nWell, who wants these files that we got?\n\n01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.000\nI do.\n\n01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.000\nTwo people.\n\n01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000\nBut we don't want to give them to you, right?\n\n01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000\nWell, I hope you do.\n\n01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000\nBecause otherwise we should have fought back there.\n\n01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:04.000\nWell, I think it's easier to fight now that we're in the car.\n\n01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000\nI don't think it's easy to fight in the car.\n\n01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.000\nWe're going to fight in a place where we can fight,\n\n01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:15.000\nor discuss civilly or whatever, free of intervention.\n\n01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:19.000\nLet's go to my apartment.\n\n01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:25.000\nShane Nightblade.\n\n01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.000\nAll right.\n\n01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000\nYou can come link a map to that section to me,\n\n01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.000\nor you can just give me your address.\n\n01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000\nDone.\n\n01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000\nSo be it.\n\n01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.000\nAllow it.\n\n01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:42.000\nI'm opening myself up a lot to you guys by inviting you to this place.\n\n01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000\nI'm a very private person.\n\n01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:47.000\nThis is like a big deal for me.\n\n01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000\nYou roll up to your apartment.\n\n01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.000\nIf I recall correctly, it's not that nice.\n\n01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:58.000\nNoted.\n\n01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:03.000\nI tip the doorman a few New Yen.\n\n01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:12.000\nWe get in the Neo elevator and head up to the laser apartment.\n\n01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.000\nIt's not that nice.\n\n01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:23.000\nSorry, the robot made that vacation.\n\n01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:29.000\nGod uses his perception of truth just to determine if there ever was a robot.\n\n01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:33.000\nNo.\n\n01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000\nAs I suspected.\n\n01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000\nA guy like me is going to keep a low profile,\n\n01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000\nhave a lot of identities.\n\n01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000\nThis is just one of them.\n\n01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000\nDo you know your neighbors?\n\n01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000\nNo, and they don't know me.\n\n01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.000\nThat's why we're here.\n\n01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000\nThis is where we'll never be found.\n\n01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000\nWe can have a conversation.\n\n01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000\nEverybody want space drinks?\n\n01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000\nFuture drinks?\n\n01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000\nFuture drinks?\n\n01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000\nFuture drinks?\n\n01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.000\nDo you happen to have Sputnik 1?\n\n01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000\nYou got it.\n\n01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000\nSputnik 1.\n\n01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000\nSputnik 1.\n\n01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.000\nThe drink-o-matic.\n\n01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:17.000\nHydrate level 4, please.\n\n01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.000\nI should have made a pizza.\n\n01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000\nHere you go, here's your drinks.\n\n01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000\nNow.\n\n01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000\nWhat are we doing?\n\n01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000\nBilly Baldwin.\n\n01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000\nWhat's his name?\n\n01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000\nBaldwin Brown.\n\n01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000\nI thought we had Jesse, what's his name?\n\n01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000\nJesse Yellerman.\n\n01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.000\nBaldwin Brown is in captivity.\n\n01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000\nSent his compatriot here to kill everybody.\n\n01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000\nJesse, you work for Baldwin?\n\n01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000\nOh yeah, we go way back.\n\n01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:51.000\nHe was my old teacher.\n\n01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:56.000\nBaldwin was saying that the repercussions of us doing our job,\n\n01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000\nwhich we were contracted to do,\n\n01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:04.000\nwere cataclysmic, shall we say?\n\n01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000\nYou want to go into more detail about that?\n\n01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000\nYeah, man.\n\n01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000\nI could do that.\n\n01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000\nI mean, I can't.\n\n01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000\nI don't know what his research was.\n\n01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000\nI just trust that it was really important.\n\n01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.000\nIf he says bad shit's going to go down,\n\n01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000\nI'd trust him.\n\n01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.000\nJesse, is it possible that,\n\n01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000\nif we were willing to give you this information,\n\n01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:29.000\nthe stuff that we stole with our skills,\n\n01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:32.000\nthat you would maybe owe us a favor?\n\n01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000\nYeah, no, I mean, no doubt.\n\n01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000\nLook at this.\n\n01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.000\nKnuckles, they shoot laser blades, razor blades.\n\n01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000\nNot laser blades, important distinction.\n\n01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000\nLaser razor blades.\n\n01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000\nLaser razor blades would have been way cooler.\n\n01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000\nI know, you're telling me.\n\n01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000\nOne of these days, I'll be able to afford them.\n\n01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000\nRight now, razor blades.\n\n01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000\nHow much would those cost?\n\n01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:59.000\nOh, you know, 20,000, 30,000, easy.\n\n01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000\nWell, the situation we're in is we took a job,\n\n01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000\nand if we don't do it,\n\n01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000\nthen they're going to be after us forever.\n\n01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000\nSo, I don't know.\n\n01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000\nAre they going to come after us,\n\n01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000\nor are they just going to not pay us?\n\n01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000\nThey're going to not pay us,\n\n01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000\nand they're going to raise their hands up in the wrong hands.\n\n01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000\nThey're going to think that we did what we did.\n\n01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000\nOur crew isn't known for failing jobs,\n\n01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:22.000\nso I understand our reputation is pretty high.\n\n01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000\nSarcasm?\n\n01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:32.000\nI think that Jesse and Baldwin as allies\n\n01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000\nmight be better than just some creds\n\n01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:37.000\nfor the risk that we went through.\n\n01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:40.000\nI'm sorry, Newian.\n\n01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000\nI mean, we're shadow runners.\n\n01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000\nWe shadow run.\n\n01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000\nSometimes runs fail, man.\n\n01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000\nBut if we just go with these guys,\n\n01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000\nthen the next time someone goes,\n\n01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000\nI want you to hire you for a shadow run.\n\n01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000\nHey, this isn't going to be one of those ones\n\n01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000\nwhere you just decide in the middle of it\n\n01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000\nthat it's like a meta shadow run\n\n01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000\nand you're going to bail on it.\n\n01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000\nWe're going to go, no, no, we promised this time,\n\n01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000\nwe really...\n\n01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000\nIt would take like a whole big thing for that to happen,\n\n01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000\nlike someone asking us, please don't do the shadow run.\n\n01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000\nThen we'd have to...\n\n01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.000\nWhat if we concocted an elaborate plan\n\n01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000\nor scheme that would make it seem\n\n01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000\nthat we didn't do this intentionally,\n\n01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.000\nthat they just hijacked this information from us\n\n01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.000\nand we would know that we were being allies with them,\n\n01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000\nbut the rest of the world would think\n\n01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000\nthat we were just the victims of their bullying.\n\n01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000\nI think Dr. Friend's onto something.\n\n01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:32.000\nI think we are in a safe, secure location.\n\n01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000\nGod damn it!\n\n01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:38.000\nI'd knock a bunch of stuff off the counter.\n\n01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:41.000\nWhoa, monologue alert.\n\n01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:44.000\nYou guys aren't hearing what I'm saying.\n\n01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000\nI fell down to the shadows\n\n01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000\nfrom the heights of the society.\n\n01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000\nI go to the shadow runs because I gave up on that world.\n\n01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:54.000\nIf they want me back, they got to tell me why.\n\n01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000\nWhat's at stake? What's going on?\n\n01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000\nI want to know what's going on.\n\n01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000\nI'm tired of these word games and puzzles and riddles.\n\n01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000\nYou're double talk and you're smart talk.\n\n01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000\nI'm just a big dumb shadow runner.\n\n01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000\nI want to know what's happening.\n\n01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000\nThis is BTL chips. Talk!\n\n01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000\nBTL chips are just drugs, man.\n\n01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000\nThey fuck up your brain.\n\n01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.000\nYeah, so what?\n\n01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000\nSo this research, I don't know.\n\n01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000\nIt might be able to help people.\n\n01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:18.000\nCan we call Baldwin?\n\n01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000\nWe need answers.\n\n01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000\nI got his number.\n\n01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000\nPut him up on a hologram or something.\n\n01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:26.000\nAlright.\n\n01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000\nSo it's visually interesting.\n\n01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000\nLet me dial him up.\n\n01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:35.000\nBeat, boot, beat, beat, beat.\n\n01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000\nWe just killed this guy.\n\n01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000\nHe seems kind of bad-ass.\n\n01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000\nIt's Baldwin.\n\n01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:43.000\nHello.\n\n01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000\nHey, what's up?\n\n01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000\nHow'd you guys get my number?\n\n01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000\nWe're with Pink, Pink, Jesse Pinkman.\n\n01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000\nOh, cool.\n\n01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:53.000\nWait, who's that?\n\n01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.000\nWe're with Jesse.\n\n01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:55.000\nJesse Yellow.\n\n01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.000\nOh.\n\n01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:57.000\nOkay.\n\n01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:00.000\nWe're trying to work out a deal, but we need more information.\n\n01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:01.000\nWe want to know, God damn it!\n\n01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000\nWe want to know what's going on!\n\n01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:06.000\nWhat's the worst thing that's going to happen if we don't give you your stuff?\n\n01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:10.000\nJust world domination, but not by us.\n\n01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000\nBad people domination.\n\n01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.000\nThat sounds pretty bad.\n\n01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:16.000\nSounds like standing operating procedure.\n\n01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:17.000\nYeah, look out the window, Jack!\n\n01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000\nThe bad guys won!\n\n01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:27.000\nSo you're saying our Johnson's going to use this information in your research\n\n01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000\nto take over the world?\n\n01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000\nYeah, I mean, not just take it over.\n\n01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.000\nReally murder it.\n\n01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:39.000\nSo the original price you were offering us for this reversal was what?\n\n01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.000\nOh, I mean, I don't have any money.\n\n01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.000\nThey don't really pay me, but I will owe you two.\n\n01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000\nThree.\n\n01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:48.000\nThree.\n\n01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.000\nOf what?\n\n01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000\nUniverses.\n\n01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000\nYou know how people owe you one?\n\n01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000\nI'll owe you three.\n\n01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.000\nUnderstood.\n\n01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:56.000\nThat's pretty good.\n\n01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000\nI believe those work in powers as well.\n\n01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000\nSo each one is actually eventually better.\n\n01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:05.000\nI would like to place the hologram on mute.\n\n01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.000\nMuting the hologram how the guard is putting it on mute.\n\n01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:09.000\nOkay.\n\n01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:13.000\nAnd on blind so that he cannot see my lips moving.\n\n01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.000\nSmart move.\n\n01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000\nSo he cannot see my lips moving.\n\n01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:21.000\nIt is my contention that, look, we were hired to acquire certain properties.\n\n01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:25.000\nWe applied ourselves to the acquisition of such properties.\n\n01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:32.000\nWe were given assistance to assist in the acquisition of such properties.\n\n01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:36.000\nWe acquired such properties and it has become complicated in every route out of this.\n\n01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.000\nOtherwise becomes infinitely and infinitely more complicated.\n\n01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:43.000\nThe simplest route, the truest route, the route that is most shadowy of the running\n\n01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:49.000\nroutes is to complete it and deliver said properties and say completion of the deal,\n\n01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:54.000\ntake our remuneration and move from there to the next job.\n\n01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:55.000\nAll right.\n\n01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.000\nOccam's route.\n\n01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.000\nOccam's route.\n\n01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.000\nHorticard, I agree with you.\n\n01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.000\nBut it comes however alert.\n\n01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:11.000\nHowever, I believe this is a turning point as us as runners to decide where we stand morally.\n\n01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:15.000\nGod damn it, the reason they hire us is so that we don't have moral turning points.\n\n01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.000\nBut we have a choice.\n\n01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:19.000\nWe see the consequences of our actions.\n\n01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:23.000\nThat would make us shafts, like not shadow runners.\n\n01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000\nWe're supposed to shadow run.\n\n01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:26.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:27.000\nThis is my button.\n\n01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:33.000\nWhen I was a child, man, child, man, little boy, man, my mentor was shot in the street\n\n01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.000\nin front of me.\n\n01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:40.000\nI spent many of my days not around you guys suspending myself above a bottle of water\n\n01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:44.000\nand using the vapor between me to draw truths.\n\n01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:47.000\nSo I'm not so much concerned with your moral, your morality.\n\n01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000\nThis sort of world does not have that sort of morality.\n\n01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:52.000\nIt doesn't live in a plainer existence.\n\n01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:55.000\nIt has several dimensions and twists and turns, and we are learning every day.\n\n01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:58.000\nA lunge and stun baton, Jesse Yellowman.\n\n01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000\nAll right.\n\n01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:05.000\nThen I guess I'm just a face.\n\n01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:08.000\nA very subtle one.\n\n01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:12.000\nUsing robot reflexes, he dodges to the side.\n\n01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.000\nFuck!\n\n01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000\nThat was a massager.\n\n01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.000\nIs hacker.\n\n01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:19.000\nYeah.\n\n01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:20.000\nI just tried to stun him.\n\n01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:21.000\nHe disarms you.\n\n01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:22.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:23.000\nHe disarms me.\n\n01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000\nNow I got the stun baton, bitch.\n\n01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000\nSlithanger!\n\n01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:32.000\nThank God in heaven.\n\n01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:33.000\nLet's thank Heather, everybody.\n\n01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:44.000\nSkyler, Darsen, Zemors Brown, Spencer Crittenden, I'm Jeff Davis, your mayor, Dan Harmon, everybody.\n\n01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:50.000\nThis show brought to you by the Apple Watch.\n\n01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:53.000\nThank you for coming.\n\n01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:56.000\nWe went a little bit late, but we do serve breakfast.\n\n01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:03.000\nBreakfast will be outside in the Meltdown Comic Clowns.\n\n01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:06.000\nDid you get any of that?\n\n01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:21.000\nIt's a good show.\n","cpu_time":["0.003s"],"str_size":[195891]}
