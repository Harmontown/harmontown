00:00.000 --> 00:23.920
Here you hear you, Harmontown is now officially in session. Welcome everybody to the Nerdmelt

00:23.920 --> 00:29.040
Theater in Hollywood, California. Thank you for joining us on Podcast Land. Won't you

00:29.040 --> 00:35.040
please join me in exalting the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:41.040 --> 00:47.040
That's very kind of you. You're a very spirited crowd. I like the feeling of this constituency

00:47.040 --> 00:54.400
tonight. You're good people. I walked the line tonight figuratively and literally talking to you.

00:54.400 --> 01:02.560
I don't want to get on a lot of tangents tonight. It's not a thing that we like to

01:02.560 --> 01:08.800
do here. I try, I make it a goal to be directing to the point. Focus is the hallmark of Harmontown.

01:11.120 --> 01:19.360
Focus is job one. We make focus at Harmontown the way they make chocolate things in the

01:19.360 --> 01:26.960
Kiebler Valley. You know what? They lived in the tree. Don't plug other products right now.

01:26.960 --> 01:32.800
I forgot to mention tonight's show brought to you by Nike. You know what? Slight change in

01:32.800 --> 01:38.800
tactic. Okay, bear with us. We're not caving. Tonight's show is brought to you by Nike.

01:38.800 --> 01:47.440
Nike. Here's what we figured out. Nike doesn't want anything to do with us. So fuck Adidas.

01:50.240 --> 01:55.200
Adidas had what, three weeks, four weeks? Yeah, they lived high on the hog. Adidas was a

01:55.200 --> 02:00.480
collateral benefit of our anti-Nike campaign, our hostage campaign to get Nike to pay us

02:00.480 --> 02:08.480
to stop advertising Adidas. We're refining our technique as we go. El Cata didn't perfect

02:08.480 --> 02:16.240
things in a day. They took him like 25, 30 years. They probably, the first thing they blew up,

02:16.240 --> 02:22.000
you don't even know what it was. It probably a rock. They blew it up, though. They moved along.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.120
They blew up a car next. But then, do you know that the official shoe of El Cata is the Nike

02:27.120 --> 02:33.040
Mercurial Soccer cleats? Interesting. Tell me more. Fusing explosive speed with eye-catching

02:33.040 --> 02:38.400
style. The Nike Mercurial Vapor 8 gives the fastest al-Qaeda members the lethal edge.

02:39.440 --> 02:47.120
Interesting, Nike. Care to pony up, you fucking stingy cocksuckers? No, no, no, no. We like them

02:47.120 --> 02:51.600
now. Oh, no, no. We like them. We just happened to mention El Cata like it's mustard. Right.

02:52.400 --> 02:58.000
And we're proudly brought to you by Nike until such time as they choose to pay up. Also,

02:58.000 --> 03:04.160
if anybody from Puma is listening, you're next, motherfuckers. Take it easy. It's the new advertising

03:04.160 --> 03:11.120
world, new paradigm. The Nike Mercurial Soccer. I walked the line tonight. I did a new thing.

03:11.120 --> 03:16.160
Usually we get questions. You've heard, if you're listening in podcast world or you're out here,

03:16.160 --> 03:20.000
you know how that goes. Did you walk the line in the Johnny Cash sense? That's what I'm saying.

03:20.000 --> 03:27.840
I did it figuratively and literally. I definitely walked the line between sobriety and drunkenness.

03:27.840 --> 03:34.720
And I also walked the actual physical line in the comic book shop and met a lot of people.

03:34.720 --> 03:41.520
And my goal, just so you understand what I'm trying to do, I'm trying to connect with you

03:41.520 --> 03:48.160
guys. I started walking the line and I used questions initially as an excuse because I wanted

03:48.160 --> 03:57.200
to talk to people. I wanted to kind of John Stuart you. He starts the daily show. If you

03:57.200 --> 04:02.240
tune into the daily show, the first thing that happens is he goes, I forgot my kazoo and everyone

04:02.240 --> 04:08.080
cracks up because he shared some joke with them before the show. There's a bond between performer

04:08.080 --> 04:16.000
and audience. I want that. Do you feel that you achieved that tonight? No. I think that what happens

04:16.000 --> 04:22.000
is I put people off still. But I'm going to keep doing it. I saw you. You're walking around with

04:22.000 --> 04:31.040
a vodka in your hand and a mayoral sash on. I was asking people, how's it going? People shrink

04:31.040 --> 04:38.960
away. You can feel them being repelled by what I have decided is my ass burgers. Having diagnosed

04:38.960 --> 04:46.960
myself with an online quiz, which is a big salute to everyone who professionally studies this stuff.

04:46.960 --> 04:52.400
I just decided from an online quiz I have ass burgers because it's fashionable. But I feel like

04:52.400 --> 05:03.360
I'm going to off put it. Just lightly applaud. I swear I won't even look. I won't look. Just

05:03.360 --> 05:11.440
lightly applaud if you were put off by me in line tonight. Okay. Who was that? Who was it?

05:11.440 --> 05:21.440
You saw Auntie? Auntie? Is that your friend? Jennifer? Were you just comedically clapping or

05:21.440 --> 05:34.480
were you really put off by me? You were surprised that I was out there. It scared you. It's weird.

05:34.480 --> 05:41.600
You read about me getting fired on a blog and then I'm next to you. Did you have a good time

05:41.600 --> 05:49.440
tonight? Well, that doesn't count. That's just you being fascinated by my majesty. You were just

05:49.440 --> 05:55.040
on a trip to San Francisco and you said everywhere you went that people were recognizing you. Thank

05:55.040 --> 06:00.800
you for calling me out on that, Jeff. That wasn't a private conversation at all. Yes, in point of

06:00.800 --> 06:04.560
fact I went to San Francisco as a private conversation. You went a sharpie in your butt in the last

06:04.560 --> 06:14.080
show. They don't know that. That isn't broadcast yet. There's a very strange, fascinating magical

06:14.080 --> 06:20.880
and I know fleeting time from it's very, very odd. I'm not an actor or anything, an athlete or

06:20.880 --> 06:28.640
anything. I went to San Francisco and Los Angeles, you expect it. It's an industry town. Everyone's

06:28.640 --> 06:35.760
an editor or a gaffer or a boom operator, an aspiring writer. You're like, okay, I'm in the

06:35.760 --> 06:41.360
capital. I'm in the epicenter of this stuff. Also, I'm at the epicenter chronologically of my

06:42.960 --> 06:50.640
cue rating because I was infamously, publicly, kind of crucified, slash self-crucified, whatever

06:50.640 --> 06:56.880
you call it. You were Chevy Chase's girlfriend. Yeah, exactly. It's a very low rent Charlie Sheen,

06:56.880 --> 07:02.160
as I've said, on a very low scale. It's like, yeah, I go to three bars and the two people

07:02.160 --> 07:08.000
recognize me. It's like an 85% rate of people. I went to San Francisco, fucking everywhere,

07:08.000 --> 07:14.480
man. I went to Exploratorium Museum and then some guy would come up and go, hey, I'm a big fan.

07:14.480 --> 07:19.280
Hey, that's fantastic. Thank you. Then you look on the Twitter, people go, hey, come to the thing

07:19.280 --> 07:23.280
and then go to the thing and then another guy'd come up and go, hey, can I buy your drink? It was

07:23.280 --> 07:29.360
pretty amazing. Anywhere that I didn't go, if I went to a place where somebody didn't explicitly

07:29.360 --> 07:34.000
come up to me and say, hey, thank you, I love what you did, I would read on Twitter later,

07:34.000 --> 07:39.440
some guy would go, holy shit, DNR, I just bought an ice cream cone here. It was really 100%.

07:40.960 --> 07:45.200
I don't know what, it matters nothing. The only thing that's going to happen is it's going to

07:45.200 --> 07:49.680
stop in a month and I'm going to, I don't know, what will I do? I'll hang myself while I'm jerking

07:49.680 --> 07:56.080
off. I don't know. Do you enjoy that experience of being recognized? I certainly have no problem

07:56.080 --> 08:04.880
with it. If you see me in public and you are thinking for a second about whether or not

08:04.880 --> 08:12.160
you should bound up to me and rub my head and say, I love you, go for it. I suffer no illusions

08:12.160 --> 08:18.160
about, like I'm going to be 50 muttering into a drink that that used to happen. Go double rub my

08:18.160 --> 08:26.800
head. Do me a big favor. That's no problem. The big question is though, is it changing my brain

08:26.800 --> 08:33.440
chemistry? Do I want it to happen? Do I care if it stops? That I don't know about. I don't know.

08:33.440 --> 08:39.840
I like to think that I'm a pretty sensible guy. That that's just, it's an oddity.

08:43.120 --> 08:46.880
This is the least charismatic thing anyone could ever talk about. I'm done. I'm finished. I'm out.

08:46.880 --> 08:50.400
That's the whole thing. I'll talk about it sometime when I'm a little more sober.

08:51.680 --> 08:57.440
Wait, have you been drinking today, Dan? Because if I find out that you have been

08:57.440 --> 09:02.720
drinking with me all day long, I'll be very disappointed. All right. We got on a little

09:02.720 --> 09:06.640
bit of a tangent. What were we talking about? You're talking about making her uncomfortable.

09:06.640 --> 09:10.960
Oh, well, yeah, but I really didn't. I just, I just amazed you. Right. I was like, holy

09:10.960 --> 09:16.400
shit, it's Batman. Okay. No, no, no. So I didn't put anybody off. But I have a lot of social

09:16.400 --> 09:20.240
anxiety. So just so you know, I go, I go down the line. What I'm trying to do is I'm, because I

09:20.240 --> 09:24.080
don't believe in therapy. So I'm going down the line and I'm actually experimenting with human

09:24.080 --> 09:29.040
contact. I'm not, I'm not talking down to you guys or like doing some kind of gimmicky thing.

09:29.040 --> 09:34.240
Like I'm actually trying to, you're the only people that I meet outside of the three friends

09:34.240 --> 09:38.640
that I have. Like, like this is a weekly thing that we do now. So like, I don't abuse it or

09:38.640 --> 09:44.080
anything. Like, but you're closer to NT than he's like number eight and your friend. Yeah.

09:44.080 --> 09:51.440
Yeah. Yeah, NT. I know NT more than I know my uncles. Certainly if NT was going to get hit by a car

09:51.440 --> 09:57.760
and the only way to save him was to shove my uncle and without hesitation.

09:59.680 --> 10:04.720
What a hero. Yeah, especially if I could shove NT into one of my daughters just to prove that I

10:04.720 --> 10:14.400
was a white liberal. Fucker, NT. Fucker. NT's black. So just for podcast land. And NT is

10:14.400 --> 10:20.000
those listening at home. Stop your stopwatches. That's the first race mentioned. We got to race.

10:20.960 --> 10:26.640
We made it to race. But Dan, that's 30 or 40 seconds later than normal. You're getting there.

10:27.760 --> 10:32.480
In four years, we might do a whole show where you don't mention race. And I think that day

10:32.480 --> 10:37.760
our souls will die a little bit. I think I was born, I'm starting to realize I was sent here to

10:37.760 --> 10:47.040
earth to obsess about race and racism. Speaking of which, Steve Harvey is hosting Family Feud now?

10:48.320 --> 10:55.040
For a long time. Okay, well, for quite some time, I believe. Well, I was in a hotel room. So this

10:55.040 --> 11:03.600
is the first I've heard of it. Aaron has some weird OCD neurosis where she can't get dressed

11:03.600 --> 11:10.480
in a hotel room unless the television is on. And so like, if it's only in a hotel room with Aaron

11:10.480 --> 11:15.600
that I'm actually like subjected to normal television signals. That's the only time I watch

11:15.600 --> 11:20.480
Sports Center for some reason is in a hotel. I find out what NASCAR is doing. Yeah, so she's

11:20.480 --> 11:28.160
gonna put on her skirt and her shirts or whatever you call them. And so we're watching Family Feud.

11:28.160 --> 11:36.320
That's it. Steve Harvey, whatever. I'm disappointed in you. You know, aim higher, Steve. I don't

11:36.320 --> 11:41.520
even know you that well. But how did he let you down? Well, by being on Family Feud. Because I

11:41.520 --> 11:47.040
just noticed that this show is a celebration of mediocrity. Like beyond any, like really,

11:47.040 --> 11:53.360
no one can argue with that. They literally, they in front of your family, they stand you up and

11:53.360 --> 12:01.760
they ask you what you think normal people said when they said something. What makes Ms. Picky

12:01.760 --> 12:06.800
different from a real pig? And the person that slams the buzzard down first and goes, she has hair!

12:08.640 --> 12:16.000
They win if the most people think like them. They win. And the person who has the slightest

12:16.000 --> 12:21.920
fucking potential to not connect dots that are right next to each other. Just on the off chance,

12:21.920 --> 12:27.920
Picasso wandered in with his family to Family Feud. He's gonna be burnt at the fucking stake on

12:27.920 --> 12:34.320
this show. That's what it's about. You will be labeled as the reason you let your family down.

12:34.960 --> 12:44.560
You think differently. You're an asshole. You're a psycho. What do you think everyone said when

12:44.560 --> 12:51.200
they eat a brownie? Yummy. You win. You win. What were you gonna say asshole? A flower. Fuck you!

12:51.200 --> 12:56.400
Get out of here! Who the fuck are you? What the fuck's with you? Do you have fungus in your brain?

12:56.400 --> 13:06.560
Get away! It's like on the playground. It's a tarot family feud. Family feud, the title,

13:06.560 --> 13:14.000
like that's a beautiful idea. Pit families against each other for sure. Make it tribal and go,

13:14.000 --> 13:19.600
okay, what makes the Harmon's different from the Johnson's? The Harmon's rule. Why do we rule?

13:19.600 --> 13:27.280
I don't know. Because we have our own language. We should win if we're able to communicate with

13:27.280 --> 13:32.560
each other better and we're weirder. I don't know how to design that game. It's not my job to make

13:34.480 --> 13:38.080
game shows. I just know that Family Feud is definitely a celebration. What's your beef with

13:38.080 --> 13:43.200
Steve Harvey though? Well, he's participating. What are you talking about? What's my beef with

13:43.200 --> 13:47.120
anybody that hosts that show? The last guy killed himself, didn't he? Why do you think?

13:48.800 --> 13:55.600
Because I'm sure if there was a note, I'm sure it was like I'm tired of being a cog in a human

13:55.600 --> 14:01.760
grinder. I can't take it. Like the karmic energy has come back from out from my asshole and into

14:01.760 --> 14:06.560
my mouth and it's like I'm poltergeisting myself. I want to die. Wait, Richard Dawson killed himself?

14:06.560 --> 14:10.000
No, no, the guy that replaced him. Richard Dawson just died of grief, I'm sure.

14:10.000 --> 14:19.920
Rick Holmes? Ray Combs. Yeah, Richard Dawson just was able to sustain that toxin going through

14:19.920 --> 14:24.400
his body. Well, because like he subverted the show by being just a fucking fantastic alcoholic.

14:24.400 --> 14:30.880
Very congenial, very congenial, very drunk. He was purple drunk. His skin took on hues.

14:32.160 --> 14:37.840
He was just like nuclear sunset, orange, purple. Yeah, yeah. He was awesome. He was 70s drunk.

14:37.840 --> 14:43.360
Yeah. Pat Noswald has a whole routine about it. If you haven't heard, I'm sure most of you had,

14:43.360 --> 14:48.480
Pat Noswald is the final word on Richard Dawson's beautiful drunkenness. So then he got replaced

14:48.480 --> 14:52.240
by that guy, but that guy, I think he killed himself, didn't he? Is that true? Anybody? This guy?

14:52.240 --> 15:00.240
What's your name, sir? Sean Combs. Sean in our front row is a historian. Oh, is that, wait,

15:00.240 --> 15:04.800
that's, I thought it was snap the jab for a second. It is, okay. See, the thing is you can't call

15:04.800 --> 15:09.600
yourself snap the jab. I can't tell you're Asian. Like, it's not, you're not Asian enough that you

15:09.600 --> 15:14.400
go, oh, it's snap the jab. It's a terrible name. Change your name. His Twitter name is snap the

15:14.400 --> 15:19.200
jab. I think as we go along, we're going to start amassing a full cast of characters. At some

15:19.200 --> 15:23.040
point, the entire audience will be people that we know by first name. We have to sit them all over

15:23.040 --> 15:30.880
there. It's like, it'll be like Hollywood Squares. Yeah. Well, that was a dead end.

15:30.880 --> 15:37.040
I just think that Family Feud should be outlawed. I don't think Dungeons and Dragons should be,

15:37.040 --> 15:42.480
because it's an exploration of the mind. And my, my, the most exciting thing that's going to happen

15:42.480 --> 15:46.080
tonight is Spencer's going to come up and we're going to start our first Dungeons and Dragons

15:46.080 --> 15:54.320
adventure. For those of you who are just joining us for the first time, three, three episodes ago,

15:54.320 --> 15:59.280
we decided to play Dungeons and Dragons. Two weeks ago, we brought up a Dungeon Master Spencer.

15:59.280 --> 16:04.480
Last week, he created our characters for us. And now we're going to bring up Spencer, our Dungeon

16:04.480 --> 16:06.960
Master. Are you ready, Spencer?

16:18.320 --> 16:23.200
Does this thing work? Yeah. Yeah. You want me over there? Yeah. Are you comfortable? You need

16:23.200 --> 16:28.320
a tabletop, right? Yeah, to roll dice on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Why don't we talk to him up here for

16:28.320 --> 16:32.160
a second and then we'll, we'll send him off to the cornfield. Well, first I want Spencer and the

16:32.160 --> 16:35.760
audience to understand that anything that goes wrong tonight, because I don't think this has

16:35.760 --> 16:42.800
ever been attempted, a live Dungeons and Dragons-ing podcast. There might be a very good reason for that.

16:43.600 --> 16:48.160
If, if that turns out to be the case, it's all the heats on me, man. This is not, Spencer's a

16:48.160 --> 16:52.400
stand-up guy. He volunteered, shot his hand up when we asked if there's a Dungeon Master in the

16:52.400 --> 16:57.760
audience. He, he has leapt to this duty. If this goes wrong, it's not because there's anything

16:57.760 --> 17:01.920
wrong with Spencer. I just want to make sure that's clear, because I'm sure we all become

17:01.920 --> 17:07.840
Dungeon Masters because we don't want something to be wrong with us that we deeply fear is.

17:08.800 --> 17:12.560
So I don't want to be, I don't want to push you further into psychosis. The Dungeons truly hide

17:12.560 --> 17:23.440
my hurts and sult pains. All right. I'm back in high school already. So do you think you're

17:23.440 --> 17:27.760
comfortable over there? Do you want that, do you want that black linen off of the table? Is that,

17:27.760 --> 17:33.600
is that not dice, dice amenable? It'll be fine. Yeah. All right. You'll be fine. Okay.

17:33.600 --> 17:39.440
Spencer, I have a question for you. How old were you when you first DM'd, when you first mastered

17:39.440 --> 17:44.880
a Dungeon? Back before I knew what Dungeons and Dragons is, we used to just play pretend, you know.

17:44.880 --> 17:48.640
But we do the same basic things. And then someone's like, Hey, have you heard of Dungeons and

17:48.640 --> 17:54.800
Dragons? And we're like, Wow, let's make this more complicated. Yeah, yeah. So you were four.

17:55.680 --> 17:59.520
All right. Oh, I guess I was in like a fourth grade. I don't know what age that is. Fantastic.

17:59.520 --> 18:04.000
I do remember, funny, I remember being in grade school. And I remember there was this kid,

18:04.000 --> 18:07.920
God damn it. What was his name? I'll never remember it. But I wish I could give him props,

18:07.920 --> 18:12.000
because he really you just remind you just made me realize that was it starts so much earlier.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.800
Like, all kids play make believe all kids play hot lava. There's a dinosaur and all this stuff.

18:16.800 --> 18:21.600
But then some kids start playing football. And and then there's other kids that are like fucking

18:21.600 --> 18:30.160
hot lava just started getting good. And I remember like being on the playground and being like playing

18:30.160 --> 18:35.360
hot lava to the fucking light like hilt with two kids one one one kids name was Sean malarkey,

18:35.360 --> 18:41.120
which sounds like a fake name. Because his name literally means fake. I would be disappointed

18:41.120 --> 18:46.000
if it was a normal name. Your friend's names are absolutely. And then there was another kid,

18:46.000 --> 18:50.880
God damn, I was like, God damn it. It was it was I think it was Armenian. It was like

18:52.880 --> 18:56.320
it doesn't matter. But I only want to think of it because I want to like to think that he'd

18:56.320 --> 19:01.120
wander into it and get props for it. But he was the fucking best. He would he would he would play.

19:01.120 --> 19:06.720
It was a form of hot lava called just jaws, because jaws was popular. So the change like

19:06.720 --> 19:10.960
there were sharks everywhere. And he would he would tell us where we were safe from the shark

19:10.960 --> 19:16.320
water and where the sharks were and stuff. And we would just like like the 30 minute recess would

19:16.320 --> 19:22.480
just like evaporate instantly. Like you couldn't believe it like I just the eye and pulling yourself

19:22.480 --> 19:27.120
away from this world where anything was was possible and you're acting out these adventures.

19:27.120 --> 19:32.480
And then you have to go trudge back to math class and all this stuff. It's like, what a bummer.

19:32.480 --> 19:38.720
I'm not going to go kill myself. But but yeah, that's I never made that correlation. Actually,

19:38.720 --> 19:42.320
that was that's the beginning of Dungeons and Dragons. It's like you hang out with your friends

19:42.320 --> 19:47.600
and you're you're improvising storytelling out on the playground. Alright, so Spencer, how do we

19:47.600 --> 19:51.680
kick this off? How do how do we begin? I think he's probably got some setup to do some physical

19:51.680 --> 19:55.680
dance. Dan has played this before back in the olden days. I've never played this before really.

19:55.680 --> 20:00.880
So you're going to have to walk me through it. But also our audience and our listening audience

20:00.880 --> 20:05.200
through it. Alright, so basically, we're going to be telling a story. And I'm going to be kind of

20:05.200 --> 20:10.080
like making the set and coming up with the non player characters. And you guys are going to be

20:10.080 --> 20:15.840
acting the parts of your player characters, which are sharpie Buttsalot and uh. And Quark.

20:19.520 --> 20:27.200
So basically, how how it'll go down is you'll say you want to do something, and then you'll roll

20:27.200 --> 20:31.520
a dice or I'll roll it for you on the table. Since I'm over here. Alright, well, there you go.

20:31.520 --> 20:36.000
And then I'll tell you if you like screwed up or whatever. Yeah, it's just basically he's telling

20:36.000 --> 20:42.560
us a story, but we decide what we do in the story. And then to simulate the chaos that is life,

20:42.560 --> 20:47.120
like he rolls dice and has charts and stuff that he uses at his discretion. So

20:47.120 --> 20:50.880
he'll be asking you what you're going to do next. You can do anything you want. Let's get it on.

20:50.880 --> 20:59.920
Everybody Spencer. The beginning of our campaign. Do campaigns have names? Do what? Do

20:59.920 --> 21:04.560
campaigns have names? Is there a title for our campaign? I'm pretty sure sometimes they do.

21:04.560 --> 21:08.960
I didn't name this. I thought it was just like, I don't know, just anything. We used to we used

21:08.960 --> 21:13.680
to have modules when you buy when you buy them in the store, they have titles, obviously. But

21:14.480 --> 21:23.360
we'll let Spencer set up. I can I can fill the time of him setting up. I want to I want to I

21:23.360 --> 21:29.200
got I always forget to tell this story. Schrabs not here tonight. He came up. He told a story

21:29.200 --> 21:36.640
about cleaning his butthole that will not soon be forgotten. But I for I account and I because

21:36.640 --> 21:41.760
that was so exciting. I forgot to tell that my favorite Schrabs story, which is when I was on

21:41.760 --> 21:46.320
the set of Heat Vision and Jack with him, which we co created. So we're on the set of this thing.

21:46.320 --> 21:55.040
This is pre 9 11. The sun is different. There's no moon. Nothing, nothing that you kids are

21:55.040 --> 22:00.320
familiar with is we're just we're standing on a set of a Jack Black motorcycle show.

22:01.760 --> 22:07.040
And and that we wrote and it says that Jack drives a motorcycle through a wall. So they're

22:07.040 --> 22:10.320
making a wall that someone can drive through. And we're like, holy shit, we're going to get in

22:10.320 --> 22:16.720
trouble. There's a medical guy on every TV and movie set that's for insurance purposes. There's

22:16.720 --> 22:22.160
like a he's like a he's his job is to, you know, obviously, if someone's finger flies off, he has

22:22.160 --> 22:28.320
to reattach it or call the ambulance or whatever. But but because that rarely happens on a good set,

22:28.320 --> 22:34.560
the medical guy tends to like hand out emergency like vitamin C powder and kind of kind of just

22:34.560 --> 22:40.480
shoot the shit with people and kind of centers around a medical thing. So this guy, this guy,

22:40.480 --> 22:45.760
the medical guy on the set of Heat Vision and Jack was talking to me and Schrab about diet coke,

22:45.760 --> 22:52.240
because Rob was a headlong into a serious diet coke addiction. And and the and he's like, man,

22:52.240 --> 22:56.480
I really got to stop drinking so much diet coke. I got to stop. And the medical guy said the

22:57.280 --> 23:01.200
because and Rob's like, yeah, because it makes me so jittery and stuff. And the medical guy says,

23:01.760 --> 23:07.920
yeah, well, also, you know, just so you know, like, it makes your dick soft. And and Rob had this

23:07.920 --> 23:13.680
weird reaction on his face, like it didn't fit like what he was hearing. He looked like intrigue,

23:13.680 --> 23:21.280
like, instead of repulsion and or dismissal and and and and he said, real, really? Like like like

23:21.280 --> 23:34.560
velvet? It's like, no, Rob, but no, it makes it not erect. And Rob goes, oh, no, I thought I thought

23:34.560 --> 23:44.560
he meant like, if you pour it over it, like, like he he wasn't kidding, man. Like, like, like Rob,

23:44.560 --> 23:50.000
I was like thinking about his dick like a Ferrari, like, like, you put a chamois on there, like,

23:50.000 --> 23:54.480
you really give it a sheen and like, like, make it soft to the touch, like, make it irresistible.

23:54.480 --> 23:59.040
Baby, your dick is so soft tonight. I dig it in a picture of Diet Coke.

23:59.040 --> 24:07.120
I thought that was amazing. That's that's that's the price of being able to draw. Are you sure

24:07.120 --> 24:11.360
that Rob wasn't right? I don't know that if you pour Diet Coke over your dick, it doesn't get

24:11.360 --> 24:16.640
really soft. I don't know. Let's find out. All right. For those of you at home, I'm doing it.

24:16.640 --> 24:21.920
Oh, it's really soft. I don't know where that's going. Do you want to start? Well,

24:21.920 --> 24:28.160
either way, we handed over to Spencer's hands. He's the sort of narrator of the because we don't. Yeah.

24:28.160 --> 24:28.480
All right.

24:35.920 --> 24:43.200
All right. Sharpie Buttsalot and Quark are on the road to a treasure vault known as the Trove.

24:43.200 --> 24:47.760
A local sage named Derevan has asked you to investigate the Trove as a result of recent

24:47.760 --> 24:52.800
scrying, having heard from beyond that a fragment of greatness is about to be revealed in this world.

24:57.840 --> 25:03.360
The path is dirt and it's a warm sunny day in Caldona. Rolling hills stretch on to around you,

25:03.360 --> 25:07.920
but the path ahead bends into some woods to the base of a great cliff. Oh, shit.

25:07.920 --> 25:21.120
It's fucking Spencer, everybody. Right now. Yeah. In an ideal universe, he's Jimmy Page,

25:21.120 --> 25:28.880
like he gets applause for his GM solo. I have a partial right now.

25:32.720 --> 25:36.240
All right. So we're on a path and it's heading into a

25:36.240 --> 25:40.880
Yeah, you're on path to go into the woods unless you guys want to like stop or something.

25:41.840 --> 25:46.880
Well, all right. Can I ask a question? Yeah, go for it. Any questions? How do we know each other?

25:46.880 --> 25:52.880
All right. You guys are friends. You met on a mission to the howling mine and you became friends

25:52.880 --> 25:57.200
and you had ventured together and you found out that you're better and you can get paid more if

25:57.200 --> 26:03.120
you work together as a team. No, we were kind of met as rivals, like kind of Indiana Jones and

26:03.120 --> 26:09.200
Balak. Yeah, exactly. All right. And then we if you guys want to subscribe to the prequel someday.

26:10.560 --> 26:16.560
What is your what's your racing? I'm a human wizard. All right. He cast spells and he has

26:16.560 --> 26:22.880
like a hawk. I mean, I have a hawk. I guess as a known barbarian, I'm a pretty whimsical kind of

26:23.760 --> 26:30.880
an emotional guy. Yeah, for sure. I go into flights of fancy. Before I go into this wood,

26:30.880 --> 26:37.120
I probably stop and ask this human magic user wizard what he thinks is best. I mean, well,

26:37.120 --> 26:44.400
I would sharpie Buttsalot. What do you think? I would say that because I have a hawk familiar,

26:44.400 --> 26:50.000
and you tell me, Spencer, what's allowed with these familiars? I would say, is this like a Beast

26:50.000 --> 26:55.120
Master situation? Can I send the hawk up to get like a literal bird's eye view? You can't like

26:55.120 --> 26:59.200
read his mind, but when he comes back, you can like look at him and know what he's seen, you know?

26:59.200 --> 27:04.080
Really? Yeah. Like to the point where it's like a like, I can know the terrain and not quite to

27:04.080 --> 27:09.360
that extent. It's not that smart, but yeah, but better better safe than not. Oh, there's a cliff.

27:09.360 --> 27:13.840
Oh, there's some trees. I don't know. Or there's a giant like if there was. I mean, I'm not going

27:13.840 --> 27:17.920
to tell you yet. Well, no, no, I know. But yeah, definitely. Okay, all right. Well, I was saying,

27:17.920 --> 27:24.720
you know, why not? That's a fair question. Let's go in the woods. I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm

27:24.720 --> 27:31.680
spoiling for a fight. Take it easy, Quark. You're so you love cigarettes and riddles. I'm sorry.

27:32.640 --> 27:35.200
Oh, I have a riddle for you. Okay.

27:38.400 --> 27:45.760
Is it about cigarettes? What did what? What did one octopus say to the other octopus?

27:45.760 --> 27:58.400
Uh, Inc. No, no, no. I get mad. Easy, easy. I want to hold your hand, hand, hand, hand,

27:58.400 --> 28:01.760
hand, hand, hand, hand. All right. Well, that makes no sense to me because there's no Beatles in

28:01.760 --> 28:10.000
this universe. To my knowledge. I know no one's going to get jiggy with anything. If we didn't

28:10.000 --> 28:18.320
have so much success in the Keldar on mind, or whatever the fuck, what did we learn? We learned

28:18.320 --> 28:25.840
to work together. Yeah. All right. So look, an ounce of prevention dot dot dot. Right. I'm going

28:25.840 --> 28:33.280
to send my hawk up. What's my hawk's name? Avenger. He's got a cooler name than I do.

28:33.280 --> 28:40.640
The audience didn't pick it. No, no, no, no. I'm going to send my hacky hawk's name up into the

28:41.600 --> 28:47.760
ether and see what he says. If he comes down, see if he has any alarms about what he sees ahead

28:47.760 --> 28:52.880
of us. You're too cautious. You're too cautious. Quirk, listen, my caution, as you know, has

28:52.880 --> 28:59.600
sometimes saved our necks. The hawk returns. All right. You catch him on your arm. Avenger.

28:59.600 --> 29:03.520
What? See you.

29:09.520 --> 29:11.520
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He probably doesn't understand that.

29:13.840 --> 29:16.640
I'm sorry. I just, I just went to heaven for a moment.

29:20.080 --> 29:23.840
This is the whole game. You spent your whole high school years getting laid. Like, see what you

29:23.840 --> 29:34.720
missed? Speakers to a gnome? What would be high school? All right. Avenger, what, what, what, what

29:34.720 --> 29:44.000
say you? He said he sees four little looking people at the, at the base of a big cliff hitting a

29:44.000 --> 29:51.760
door. Hmm. That sounds like there's four little people hitting the base of a, I'm a, I'm a little

29:51.760 --> 29:55.520
people. Let's go help those little people out. All right. Well, it sounds like, yeah, certainly

29:55.520 --> 29:59.360
if you saw anything worse than that, we would have heard about it. I'm going to rush, let's rush

29:59.360 --> 30:05.680
headlong toward that door. How, how, how would you have an eye in the distance between us and that

30:05.680 --> 30:12.880
event? You head, head or you rush headlong towards the door. All right. Just like I said. All right.

30:12.880 --> 30:19.760
Lesson learned. Walk, walk, walk, walk. Hey, uh, hey, uh, Sharpie, uh, what's red and smells like

30:19.760 --> 30:32.640
blue paint? Red paint. Nobody ever gets that. All paint smells the same. Do you need a cigarette?

30:34.640 --> 30:38.320
Have you got one? Jesus Christ. I'm trying to quit.

30:41.680 --> 30:48.560
All right. Do we do it? How far to the, you charge across the bend and you see a clearing.

30:48.560 --> 30:52.080
There's the base of the cliff with the large door, just as a venture had mentioned. And you

30:52.080 --> 30:57.520
see in front of it, four goblins trying to puzzle out how to get in. They don't seem to notice you

30:57.520 --> 31:02.160
yet. Goblins. These are, this is not cool, man. Are they friendly? No, no, they're goblin. I have a

31:04.320 --> 31:12.400
look. Let's just, let's just go away. No, I agree. What's in the, what's behind the door? Well,

31:12.400 --> 31:16.560
we're first level. Yeah. We don't, I don't think we should fuck with four goblins either. I gotta

31:16.560 --> 31:21.600
say though, my, my natural barbarian curiosity wants to know what's behind that door. It's for

31:21.600 --> 31:25.280
a goblin to try to get in. Well, that's where we're going. We, the, the, the scryer that told us to

31:25.280 --> 31:30.720
come here. How about this? Let me go talk to the goblins. I can't talk to goblins. I'm short.

31:30.720 --> 31:34.560
I'm short. They'll, they'll, they'll, they'll, they'll see me as one of their own. There's no

31:34.560 --> 31:39.760
talking to goblins, man. They're like monsters. They're absolute monsters. If you can, I don't,

31:39.760 --> 31:43.840
on the back page, they'll say the languages at the bottom, not that the other one.

31:43.840 --> 31:51.120
Yeah. But the page behind that towards the bottom languages. All right. Do you see languages?

31:51.120 --> 31:56.240
Yeah. Yeah. Does it say goblin? No. What does it say? Common gnome giant. All right. You don't

31:56.240 --> 32:03.680
speak goblin. All right. Common elvish dwarf orc undercom, undercom. I studied it in high school,

32:03.680 --> 32:09.840
but I, I only remember like a few words. You realize that goblins might speak undercommon.

32:09.840 --> 32:13.600
Oh, really? Man. I also speak of Bissell in case we run into James Cameron.

32:20.240 --> 32:24.640
Okay. So can, can, as background, as a guy in this world, I would know this. I'm just asking

32:24.640 --> 32:29.920
you a common knowledge question. Are goblins ever anything other than thuggish bastards? Like, are

32:29.920 --> 32:34.880
they, is there any point in ever talking to them? Or, I mean, they've been known to form societies,

32:34.880 --> 32:42.000
but, you know, generally they cause a menace. All right. Well, look, I say, I'm a plus one

32:42.000 --> 32:47.760
attacking goblinoids. What's a goblinoid? That's a goblin or goblinoid. Let's fuck them up, man.

32:47.760 --> 32:54.480
Let's just do it. Let's fuck them up. Let's go fuck these goblins up. All right. Right? Audience?

32:54.480 --> 33:01.440
Yeah. Okay. All right. I think, I feel the gods urging us on. So here's the thing. But wait,

33:01.440 --> 33:06.640
wait, wait. Don't do it yet. Don't do it yet. No, no, no. I have a crossbow. I'm good with a crossbow.

33:06.640 --> 33:10.080
Yeah. They still haven't noticed you. We can take one out before you fly into a rage. All right.

33:10.080 --> 33:14.960
So I want to fire my crossbow at one of them. All right. You aren't the best shot, but let's try it.

33:17.920 --> 33:23.440
Sharpie. You fire a bolt loose from your crossbow. It whizzes past the goblin and

33:23.440 --> 33:29.600
thunks in the cliffside. Son of a bitch. Now they know we're here. Now they know they're here.

33:29.600 --> 33:33.200
This is, this is time for my catchphrase, which is, oh, sorry.

33:36.800 --> 33:37.760
You'll hear it a lot.

33:41.680 --> 33:45.520
Okay. Well, flying to a rage. I'm going to go study magic. I mean,

33:46.560 --> 33:50.720
Spencer, what are my chances of taking on four goblins on my own? You can run up to one and hit

33:50.720 --> 33:56.560
it. Let's do it. Let's fucking light this fucking firecracker and see what happens. Launching yourself

33:56.560 --> 34:02.640
at the goblin. You draw your sword and then a clean slice slash slash at him. He rolls the dice.

34:04.080 --> 34:05.600
You hit the goblin. Yeah.

34:10.320 --> 34:15.120
Never had a lesson. He is cleft in twain. Sorry, whatever. He is cleft in twain.

34:15.120 --> 34:32.160
Cleft in twain. I think ray of frost sounds pretty aggressive. Yeah, for sure. I would like to cast

34:32.160 --> 34:38.720
ray of frost. With a magical gesture of your hand, a ray of frost fires forth towards the goblin.

34:38.720 --> 34:48.480
You hit the goblin. And he freezes and falls and shatters into pieces.

34:52.320 --> 34:55.440
Yeah. If you were to hit that first one with a crossbow, we don't have one dude left.

34:56.720 --> 34:59.120
I'm practicing. It's my B plan.

35:00.400 --> 35:03.280
Crossbow. It's the goblin's turn. He uses a cigarette right now.

35:03.280 --> 35:10.960
God dammit. Goblin's turn. Wait, is it my turn? No, it's the goblin's turn. They whirl around

35:10.960 --> 35:15.840
and notice that two of their brethren lie slain on the floor. They scatter like ants.

35:17.040 --> 35:21.200
Did we scare them off? You scared them off. We said they fucking did. If you kill two of them

35:21.200 --> 35:23.920
before they turn around, we're like the cactus bunch.

35:23.920 --> 35:31.680
Dan and Jeff are hugging everybody. It's a tender moment.

35:36.400 --> 35:40.880
Spencer, Spencer, I'd say if you'd be willing, when you stay put, like kind of like the Paul

35:40.880 --> 35:48.000
Schaefer to a very nerdy tonight show or whatever, David Letterman hosts. Because we may need to

35:48.000 --> 35:52.480
come back to this because it's already working. Let's just talk about our buttholes.

35:52.480 --> 35:56.880
Yeah, because now we're at the door and we sent these goblins are running, right?

35:56.880 --> 36:01.760
Yeah, that's the case. It's a little bit of a nice little breaking bad AMC commercial break

36:01.760 --> 36:07.680
for our Dungeons & Dragons adventure. We just created what can only be described as podcast

36:07.680 --> 36:15.520
history. Yeah, no, it's podcast dynamite. If Garrison Keeler knew how to do this shit, he

36:15.520 --> 36:23.600
would have done it. Speaking of goblins, holy shit, think of this segue. This is what I wanted

36:23.600 --> 36:28.960
to share with people. Halloween is quickly approaching. Now, here's the thing. We decided

36:29.680 --> 36:35.440
we're all dressing as Jareth from Labyrinth for Halloween. I'm sorry I burped while telling you

36:35.440 --> 36:42.000
that. Yeah, we were watching Erin McGathy, Dan's girlfriend, made us watch Labyrinth,

36:42.000 --> 36:46.240
which is one of, you could say it's your favorite movie or among your favorite movies.

36:49.520 --> 36:53.440
Your favorite movie growing up. So we watched it and I hadn't seen it in a long time and

36:53.440 --> 36:58.640
David Bowie, if you've never seen the movie, if you don't recall, David Bowie has a number of

36:58.640 --> 37:05.520
awesome costumes. He's got big like rock and roll hair and generally a giant cock like a huge cod

37:05.520 --> 37:11.840
piece and high boots and he's kind of an asshole on it. But so is everybody. That's a movie full

37:11.840 --> 37:16.400
of bad people. So we decided that we were all going to have a competition on Halloween that

37:16.400 --> 37:21.200
it was, we're all going to dress as Jareth Bowie's character from Labyrinth and may the best Jareth

37:21.200 --> 37:30.080
win. But we wanted, whenever our closest Harmontown is to Halloween, we invite any of you here

37:30.080 --> 37:34.880
tonight or listening to come as Jareth because Dan and I certainly will be dressed as Jareth.

37:34.880 --> 37:39.120
Yeah. Aaron almost absolutely certainly. And what we'd like to have is a

37:39.120 --> 37:46.480
a nerd melt full of Jareth's. Just a bunch of Jareth's for better or for worse. We might have

37:46.480 --> 37:51.280
a little talent show or a little costume contest and then we're going to all go to one bar together

37:52.640 --> 38:01.280
and we're going to take that bar over and my deep abiding wish is that we go to a bar where one guy

38:01.280 --> 38:12.000
was dressed as Jareth. It goes, oh, you've got to be shitting me. We would like to confuse Los Angeles.

38:13.040 --> 38:17.600
Although we can all just go to a bar like the Roxy or something like that, the Rainbow Rumors,

38:17.600 --> 38:20.880
like something in the sunset strip and they'd all just think we were Nikki Six or some shit.

38:21.840 --> 38:27.120
Are you feeling what I'm feeling? D&D withdrawal. Oh, shit. Don't you feel that? It's like,

38:27.120 --> 38:31.760
god damn it. That's why that's why I was fine. I can fairly hear the creek of that door.

38:34.400 --> 38:40.000
As the corpses of those goblins lie rotting in the noon sun. Spencer. So we're at this door.

38:40.000 --> 38:46.000
We sent these goblins a scattered. So what is this door? Can we describe this door to us?

38:46.000 --> 38:51.360
All right. Yeah. The path ends at a bottom of a sheet rock face. The natural rock extends upwards

38:51.360 --> 38:56.480
hundreds of feet to end in a cliff. Your path is flanked by trees. Channels are etched in the rock

38:56.480 --> 39:01.040
carved by ages of trickling streams, paths down the cliffside. But in the heat of the summer,

39:01.040 --> 39:06.320
it's all dry. Jesus Christ, did you write that? Yeah, that's part of the job. Fuck you.

39:08.080 --> 39:14.880
Yeah. What the hell? Said in the rock surface is a large gold door and a large gold arch standing

39:14.880 --> 39:20.320
a good 12 feet tall. The door lacks any handles or hinges, but its surface is marred by scratches

39:20.320 --> 39:26.800
and cuts. Of course. Yeah. Many, many men have been here before us and tried in vain, just as

39:26.800 --> 39:32.320
those goblins were. We're going to have to approach this with the minds of, of, of, of, of sentience.

39:34.480 --> 39:39.200
All right. So Quark, I'm going to confess. I drank a little bit before the campaign.

39:40.400 --> 39:44.240
I have to hang a leak. Let's get inside. Well, I don't think it's that easy, Quark.

39:44.240 --> 39:50.720
The arches keystone has large pearl colored eye whose lid is shut tightly. It appears to be made

39:50.720 --> 39:55.600
of a living material. The eye, there's like an eyelid in the door that's made of living material.

39:55.600 --> 40:00.560
Yeah. It's at the top of the door, like above the door. Oh, above the, in the arch. It's made of

40:00.560 --> 40:06.400
a living material. Spencer, do I have any, any talent or skills that might, you can, you can

40:06.400 --> 40:11.600
look around. You can maybe inspect the door. You can look, look on the floor. That's a skill.

40:11.600 --> 40:17.520
Looking around is a skill, I promise. Spencer, I'm going to invoke my God given right to look around.

40:19.840 --> 40:24.480
You see a small square divot on the ground. It looks to be about 10 inches square.

40:24.480 --> 40:27.200
It has dust on it, but the dust has been recently disturbed.

40:28.560 --> 40:31.760
I think there's a thing that goes in the divot. And that's like an Indiana Jones thing.

40:33.120 --> 40:38.880
That, you know, if you have any stuff in your inventory, you can use it. Oh, nice, nice hint.

40:38.880 --> 40:44.320
All right. If you have any stuff in your inventory, you're going to use it.

40:44.320 --> 40:48.320
Roll a burlap sack and plant the steel. I got seven throwing names. Holy fuck.

40:50.560 --> 40:55.280
A compass, a ball of twine. I was a bed roll. I can't stick my backpack in it. That's just stupid.

40:56.480 --> 41:03.200
What is this? Small 10 inch square. Use that. Use that. What is it? What does it say? Square?

41:03.200 --> 41:07.760
What? Mirror. Mirror. Stick it in there. It's going to shine a light. It's going to shine a light.

41:07.760 --> 41:11.920
Why do I have a small 10 inch square mirror? Just for the hell of it? It's used for scrying sometimes.

41:11.920 --> 41:17.840
Oh, okay. All right. So I, look, I'm no wizard and I'm no human. I'm saying stick it in there.

41:17.840 --> 41:22.560
I think the sun's going to beam in there and then here's what, here's what goblins couldn't figure

41:22.560 --> 41:29.600
out. I put my small 10 inch square mirror into the divot so that the sun reflects into the eyeball.

41:29.600 --> 41:33.280
As you have said it, it happens. The light streams into the eye.

41:33.280 --> 41:36.800
Don't read ahead, Dan.

41:38.160 --> 41:42.800
The eye winks open and you see that it's made out of a giant crystalline substance.

41:42.800 --> 41:45.600
It starts to glow. The door disappears.

41:47.040 --> 41:54.720
Nice. You know what? I gotta say, Sharpie, Sharpie, let's just take this moment.

41:56.080 --> 41:57.200
It's like we can't lose.

41:57.200 --> 42:02.400
You can see there seems to be swinging pendulums down the hall.

42:02.400 --> 42:06.320
The hall looks to be covered in gold. I got a bad feeling about that.

42:06.320 --> 42:09.760
Well, I don't like these pendulums. Swinging pendulums. Yeah. Sounds like booby traps.

42:09.760 --> 42:14.400
Yeah. Can I use my low light vision that I have here?

42:14.400 --> 42:17.680
Yeah. You can make out charred skeletons on the ground.

42:18.720 --> 42:21.200
Charred skeletons. Okay. This seems like a fucking.

42:21.200 --> 42:29.520
Seems like a pendulum driven torch trap. I'm making it up. All right, so how do we proceed here?

42:29.520 --> 42:31.760
Well, you're tiny. Maybe if you just run ahead.

42:36.000 --> 42:44.400
It's a bad pitch, but you know. I would like to cast Detect Magic.

42:44.400 --> 42:51.760
All right, you Detect Magic. We would all like to cast Detect Magic.

42:51.760 --> 42:57.360
It's a spell that I know, asshole. You Detect strong magical ores coming from the

42:57.360 --> 43:00.960
eye that seems to be glowing and coming from inside the dungeon.

43:00.960 --> 43:05.840
All right. Well, okay. No big surprise there. Burn that up.

43:06.480 --> 43:10.960
All right. Look, we got, we got, we got, I don't, we got pendulums and we got charged skeletons.

43:10.960 --> 43:14.880
I've got small size, man. I can, maybe I can, I can weedle my way through there.

43:14.880 --> 43:17.200
Just go crawl, just crawl in there. All right. I'm going to, I'm going to try to

43:17.200 --> 43:20.640
crawl through there. You enter the room. It's actually a large hallway.

43:21.600 --> 43:26.960
It goes down about 60 feet and it's interspersed by golden pendulums that swing back and forth.

43:26.960 --> 43:30.320
Are they sharp and scary? They aren't sharp and scary, but their pendulums

43:30.320 --> 43:34.480
hold crystal lenses that seem to be focusing a white beam that's shooting from the eye and

43:34.480 --> 43:42.000
the door frame down the hallway as. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Tomb Raider.

43:44.080 --> 43:46.800
No, what do you, what are you thinking? I'm not thinking anything.

43:47.600 --> 43:51.600
As the pendulum swing, you notice that they break the white beam of light and reflect it

43:51.600 --> 43:56.800
across the room. It seems dangerous, but down the hall, the white light is attempting to melt

43:56.800 --> 44:06.320
through a door. Let's stop those pendulums. How do we do it? I don't know. I'm so drunk.

44:06.320 --> 44:12.080
I got to have you with me in this mission. I really, I thought this would be easier.

44:13.360 --> 44:19.920
I got so much paperwork here. I'm really starting to regret my choice to be an adventurer.

44:19.920 --> 44:28.400
So my dad wanted me to make chairs. I'm making that up about my character.

44:31.040 --> 44:36.160
Should have made chairs? So how do we attempt this? Can we just go up and physically stop

44:36.160 --> 44:40.160
these pendulums from moving? You can definitely try. Yeah, let's try that shit. I want to go

44:40.160 --> 44:43.280
up and stop one of these pendulums. All right, you walk up to a pendulum and

44:43.280 --> 44:50.480
attempt to stop it. Let's roll. All right. You grab onto it, but you can't stop it.

44:50.480 --> 44:54.560
It starts to swing. Do you let go? You think your fingers might get smashed if you don't

44:54.560 --> 45:00.560
let go? I'll let go. All right. You let go. The pendulum is still swinging freely. You haven't

45:00.560 --> 45:05.520
seemed to stop it. Maybe something in the room can stop it. Let's look around. Yeah, we'll look

45:05.520 --> 45:12.720
around. Look around. God damn it. All right. Well, you don't see anything I'm afraid,

45:12.720 --> 45:18.080
but Sharpie spies that a square on the floor looks a different color of gold than the rest

45:18.080 --> 45:23.200
of the floor. All right. Well, then I said they put the mirror in the square. It's not a divot.

45:23.200 --> 45:27.120
You can put the mirror on the square. Yeah, put the mirror on the square. All right. You put the

45:27.120 --> 45:38.720
mirror on the square. It is sitting on the floor. Johnass. I look up on the ceiling from where the

45:38.720 --> 45:44.080
square on the floor is. You notice a button on the ceiling. Okay. All right. How high is it? Can

45:44.080 --> 45:48.480
I reach it? You might be able to boost quark on your shoulders and he can reach it. All right.

45:49.120 --> 45:54.560
Don't you even fucking think about it. Remember what happened on the calderon mine?

45:56.720 --> 46:02.720
Just please, can you once stop riddling and... I still have a scar on my head. Get on my shoulders

46:02.720 --> 46:06.080
and press the button. You son of a bitch. We'll edit out the parts where we couldn't figure this

46:06.080 --> 46:12.880
out for a long time. All right. And we're going to seem like gods. Wait, Sharpie, let me get in your

46:12.880 --> 46:23.440
shoulders. All right. Quark gets on Sharpie's shoulders if it's possible. It is possible. The

46:23.440 --> 46:33.680
button is pushed. The first pendulum grinds to a halt. Are there any more buttons? Well,

46:33.680 --> 46:39.440
there's probably two more, right? Do you look on the ceiling? I did. I look on the ceiling. You

46:39.440 --> 46:46.160
see two more buttons down the hallway. Push that shit, motherfucker. All right. You successfully

46:46.160 --> 46:51.120
push the buttons. The pendulums grind to the halt. I was going to waste a ball of twine on that.

46:54.320 --> 47:01.280
Sharpie, what did one elevator say to the other elevator? Need a lift?

47:01.280 --> 47:07.840
No. No. I think I'm coming down with something.

47:09.360 --> 47:11.600
It's got less riddles. In the middle of the campaign,

47:11.600 --> 47:17.680
I love riddles. All right. So we press all the buttons and the pendulums all stop.

47:18.560 --> 47:22.160
The beam is focused through the pendulums and it melts the door. The door dissipates.

47:22.880 --> 47:27.360
All right. So far so good. Another stopping point. We should probably camp here for the

47:27.360 --> 47:37.600
night. Yeah. Spent for everybody. It's our fault.

47:40.960 --> 47:44.880
Like, I mean, if it's going to take us 20 minutes to get through a bloody door.

47:44.880 --> 47:50.080
Well, that's the thing. It's Dungeons and Dragons. It's not, you know, it's not Die Hard,

47:50.080 --> 47:54.320
you know? You're never 90 minutes from John McClain saving the day. That's the appeal of Dungeons

47:54.320 --> 47:59.600
and Dragons. I like that you and I and the audience here who I can, I really can sense they were

48:01.200 --> 48:07.040
wrapped. Did you notice, I don't want to play into a stereotype, but did you notice the couple of

48:07.040 --> 48:11.200
exasperated sighs and kind of get on with it? The female voices, like it was like,

48:13.600 --> 48:21.680
something about women, they can sense a waste of time before a man can. It's a sexist cliche,

48:21.680 --> 48:25.840
but they're more intuitive. They just know when something's not worth. But as we get better,

48:25.840 --> 48:31.200
we're going to start looking around more, right? No, yeah. First of all, we can set up like a

48:31.200 --> 48:35.920
looking around macro. You know, we just hit that button. We look around, we look around. Control

48:35.920 --> 48:43.360
F means like a look around. Well, yeah, you liked it when you cleaved that guy in twain. It felt

48:43.360 --> 48:49.920
good. It felt real good. All right. What else did we talk about? I'm trying to pour a drink,

48:49.920 --> 48:54.880
like, control for a change. Can we talk about, let's see what we got here. I want to talk for a

48:54.880 --> 49:02.160
moment about you. Dan Harmon is a writer. Thank you. He's a writer. And yet most of my writer

49:02.160 --> 49:07.920
friends are completely incapable of telling an actual joke. Oh, right, right, right. Dan can't

49:07.920 --> 49:13.920
tell a joke. You would think that's an easy thing. A joke is simply a quick three act play. A guy

49:13.920 --> 49:18.400
goes into a bar. The guy says this and the punch line is that it's a boom, boom, boom, three act

49:18.400 --> 49:24.000
play. I'm a terrible joke teller. You're the worst at it. And we try to coach you on telling a joke.

49:24.000 --> 49:28.800
To the point where I swear to God, I've tried to tell the same joke a thousand times and I still

49:28.800 --> 49:33.440
can't tell it. Because you get caught up in the, is it stage fright or is it the idea? I don't know

49:33.440 --> 49:39.040
what it is. I don't know what it is. Try to tell the Walder's Masked Joke because there's a joke.

49:39.040 --> 49:43.120
All right. Okay, okay, okay. Do you remember the joke? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And don't, don't

49:43.120 --> 49:49.120
intentionally. No, no, I'm not going to fuck it up on purpose. I swear to God, I'm going to try to tell. I think this and I'm not trying to

49:49.120 --> 49:56.240
over, like to tee this too high. I think the Walder's Masked Joke is the finest joke, joke ever written.

49:57.280 --> 50:03.360
And it's, you have to finesse it. It has to be just right. So here's Dan Harmon trying to tell.

50:03.360 --> 50:06.960
Okay, all right. The Walder's Masked Joke. So there's this eight year old kid

50:06.960 --> 50:14.960
and he's walking on the side of a road and he finds a Walder's Mask. So he puts it on his head

50:15.840 --> 50:19.440
and he flips it down and he flips it back up and he flips it down and he's like,

50:19.440 --> 50:23.360
ah, it's a Walder's Mask. It's fun. Fun to have one on.

50:23.360 --> 50:33.680
And he's walking down the road on a pickup truck. Pickup truck rolls up alongside him on the road.

50:37.840 --> 50:45.600
And the driver says, hey kid, do you want a ride from me? And the kid goes, hey, fine.

50:45.600 --> 50:53.520
And he gets in the, gets in the truck and he's driving with the guy and the kid,

50:53.520 --> 50:59.200
the kid flips the Walder's Mask down, flips it back up. He's playing with it. It's fun to

50:59.200 --> 51:05.600
have a Walder's Mask as a kid. It's more fun for them than it is for a Walder, for a certain,

51:05.600 --> 51:15.440
for a Walder, it's just vocational banality. It's something you do to protect your eyes.

51:15.440 --> 51:20.480
For a kid, it's like exciting. He feels like Darth Vader. So he's just playing with it.

51:21.040 --> 51:26.320
And the guy driving the pickup is driving the kid along and he goes like, hey kid,

51:27.200 --> 51:42.400
hey, have you ever heard of massage? And the kid flips the Walder's Mask up and goes like,

51:42.400 --> 51:50.320
uh, no, no. He flips it back down. The guy drives a little longer and goes, hey kid,

51:50.320 --> 51:59.440
have you ever heard of fellatio? The kid flips the Walder's Mask back up. No, no, no. He flips

51:59.440 --> 52:06.560
it back down. Driving for a little while longer. Long pause. Twice as long as the last two because

52:06.560 --> 52:17.120
here it comes. The guy says, hey kid, have you, do you know what a, what a pedophile is? And the

52:17.120 --> 52:22.160
kid flips up his mask in exasperation and goes, look, I got to tell you, I'm not a real welder.

52:28.080 --> 52:31.200
Jeff's giving it to him. See, I can't tell that joke right, apparently. Yeah.

52:31.200 --> 52:37.040
I don't know. If you tell that joke right, these people erupt into a pause. First of all,

52:37.040 --> 52:40.640
the kid puts the Walder's Mask on, he gets in the car and the guy says, do you know what fellatio

52:40.640 --> 52:45.760
is? The kid says no. Do you know what sodomy is? The kid says no. Do you know what a pedophile is?

52:45.760 --> 52:49.600
And the kid says, look, mister, I got to be honest with you. I'm not really a welder.

52:51.360 --> 52:55.520
Funnier? I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. I'm very concise. I can't tell jokes. You're right.

52:55.520 --> 53:00.720
Do you have another joke? Yeah. Yeah. The other one I've never been able to tell correctly is the

53:00.720 --> 53:08.640
duck one. Why am I identifying it with you? I'm sorry to tell it. Okay. So, and I'm covering my

53:08.640 --> 53:14.480
eyes. Before you tell this, what do you think your problem is with telling jokes? It's because

53:14.480 --> 53:18.240
I'm trying to put myself in the play. I'm trying to describe to the audience a situation that's

53:18.240 --> 53:27.200
happening. It's important to be there. I think it's because jokes are purely semantic. There's

53:27.200 --> 53:37.520
a semantic cadence. It's like punnery. It's a deception because it really has nothing to do

53:37.520 --> 53:42.560
with the actual scene that's happening. And yet it seems like it is. It seems like a guy's walking

53:42.560 --> 53:45.760
into a bar. You need to picture the guy walking into the bar. I always picture the guy walking

53:45.760 --> 53:49.680
into the bar. I'm trying to make my bad joke telling sound like it's part of a huge gift.

53:51.520 --> 53:56.480
I'm just bad at telling jokes. I'm just trying to describe what happens in my brain. I try to

53:56.480 --> 54:02.800
tell the joke and I remember the joke because I remember what happened to who. And then I start,

54:02.800 --> 54:07.360
so then I go there and then I don't say the right combination of words right. Because the kids

54:07.360 --> 54:11.440
are supposed to say the certain combination of words. It's with a land that joke of this Jeffrey

54:11.440 --> 54:18.080
Ross fucking tough crowd with Colin Quinnway. Those guys know how to do it and I'm stuck in the

54:18.080 --> 54:23.120
moment. The kids get in the truck and he could get raped if he's not careful. I think when you're

54:23.120 --> 54:28.480
telling a joke that you feel the silence that you're hearing, when people are listening to the

54:28.480 --> 54:34.080
joke as some sort of indictment. No, no, no, it's not that. I swear to God it's not that.

54:34.080 --> 54:38.000
All right, so let's hear the duck one. Like really just fire off from the fucking hip.

54:38.000 --> 54:45.760
A guy walks into a whorehouse and he says, what do you got for me? I want to have a whore encounter.

54:45.760 --> 54:55.360
I'm not looking at you guys. Stop engaging me. I'm just going to barrel through this. So the whore

54:55.360 --> 55:04.240
master, whatever you call them. All right, so it's already fallen apart. Whatever you call them,

55:04.240 --> 55:14.160
the madam, the ma'am, the clerk, the whore clerk says, look, we're all out of whores right

55:14.160 --> 55:19.680
now. Like they're all busy. Fresh out of whores. So we are. They're busy. They're busy whoring,

55:19.680 --> 55:30.160
like I would say. No, no, no, no, I'm sorry. Okay, so she goes to the whores are busy and

55:31.440 --> 55:37.760
also like the ones that we have, they're too expensive and for you, just judging from your

55:37.760 --> 55:46.400
clothing and the guy, the guy goes, all I have is a forget all that that happened. Just understand

55:46.400 --> 55:50.800
that a guy walked into a whorehouse and then the whore person said, like, what do you want? And

55:50.800 --> 55:56.640
then this guy said, I have a I have a dollar. Okay, that's what he had. This is a time when a dollar

55:59.600 --> 56:05.440
he had. This is a different time. This is a different time in America.

56:05.440 --> 56:10.400
Yeah. You know, like, there was a reasonable expectation for a dollar at a whorehouse. So

56:10.400 --> 56:18.080
he goes, I have a dollar. I have a dollar. And the whore master says, well, I, you know, we

56:18.080 --> 56:21.760
don't have any whores for a dollar here. Times are changing. There's telegraphs going up. You

56:21.760 --> 56:27.680
know, this is, you know, this is I don't know what you came in here expecting, but this would be

56:27.680 --> 56:33.360
like the mid 1800s. I'll tell you, you certainly can't have a human whore for for a dollar. What

56:33.360 --> 56:38.880
you can have is this duck and he pulls a duck out like, uh, from underneath the counter, the whore

56:38.880 --> 56:45.040
counter and says, you can have a duck for a dollar. You can have this duck. And the guy's like, I

56:45.040 --> 56:50.960
came all the way into town. I certainly not going to go back. I got all psyched up for, I've been

56:50.960 --> 56:57.040
talking to this guy for 45 minutes. So he, so he gives a guy the dollar. He takes the duck upstairs.

56:57.040 --> 57:05.920
He goes upstairs. He actually has a great time, uh, with the duck. Uh, I, I, you know, they,

57:05.920 --> 57:12.480
they have, uh, they have vaginas. Um, I don't know why he has a great time. It doesn't matter.

57:12.480 --> 57:17.920
What Aaron, what, why is it like, what's the, I think, Dan, Dan, you're doing great, honey.

57:17.920 --> 57:27.120
I'm not doing it on purpose. I'm telling you, the joke is, I know that the beauty is, he's

57:27.120 --> 57:30.640
saying he has a, he has a good time with it. I'm going to speed through the rest of it. It's

57:30.640 --> 57:35.360
amazing. You're not, you're not fucking around right now. This is how he tells jokes for real.

57:35.360 --> 57:38.960
He has a great time with the duck. He comes down and he gives the duck back and he says,

57:38.960 --> 57:43.760
like, the joke is, uh, it's, uh, halfway over. I had a guy, I had a great time with this duck.

57:43.760 --> 57:49.600
Thank you. And he just leaves. It doesn't matter. And so, so he comes back the next day and he says,

57:49.600 --> 57:58.560
uh, uh, uh, uh, listen, uh, uh, I, I, I, can I, can I, uh, I, I, I, uh, I brought another dollar.

57:58.560 --> 58:04.240
Can I have a, can I have, can I have the, can I have, can I have the duck again?

58:04.240 --> 58:12.880
And, uh, and they, and they, and the, the whore, whore tender puts the duck on the counter and

58:12.880 --> 58:19.120
says, and says, here's the, here's the duck. Does the whore tender work beneath or above the whore

58:19.120 --> 58:24.560
master? It goes whore master, whore tender. Well, he was, he was, he was doing whore back.

58:25.840 --> 58:28.880
It's like, you can't order from the whore tender. He's whore backing.

58:28.880 --> 58:32.720
All right. He was in the weed. He's cleaning, cleaning ducks out.

58:34.880 --> 58:38.000
He said, he puts a duck in the, I already fucked it up. I know this.

58:41.920 --> 58:45.120
It's like the black stallion. Like, oh, those are like Aaron calling out, you're perfect. I'm

58:45.120 --> 58:50.240
going to tell the joke. Right. He puts a duck on the counter and the, and, and, uh, god damn it.

58:50.240 --> 58:57.040
I fucked it up. Okay. So, okay. Don't say, right. Can you just rewind one day, just rewind one day

58:57.040 --> 59:01.920
in the story. The guy, so what already happened is the, is the first transaction where the guy got

59:01.920 --> 59:06.560
the duck and he had the time of his life. Okay. I'm sorry about this. So the guy comes back in

59:07.120 --> 59:12.160
and he, and he comes in and he goes, I'll take, I'll take the duck. Okay. And the guy puts the duck

59:12.160 --> 59:16.400
on the counter and he takes the duck. He goes upstairs again, has the time of his life, comes

59:16.400 --> 59:23.200
back down, puts the duck on the counter. The whore master says, uh, that'll be $5. And the guy says,

59:23.200 --> 59:28.720
yesterday it was a dollar. And the whore master says, that duck had AIDS,

59:32.640 --> 59:33.840
which doesn't see, it doesn't.

59:38.400 --> 59:40.720
It doesn't seem like a funny joke to me either, but

59:42.800 --> 59:48.000
when I heard it told everyone laughed and I've been trying to tell it. You know why? Because

59:48.000 --> 59:54.720
their joke came in under 10 fucking minutes. Let me try one more. I swear to God, I can tell

59:54.720 --> 59:58.160
this one right. Just one more, one more, one more, one more. I swear to God, there's what I will

59:58.160 --> 01:00:03.600
not. By the way, we serve breakfast everybody. It's like, like, like three minutes. I'll be

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:08.400
through this one, like not even, not even. I swear to God. Okay. 75 year old man's walking down a

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:14.800
sidewalk. He walks past a frog. The frog looks up at him and says, Hey, I'm a magical frog. If you

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:19.440
kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful princess and I'll have sex with you for the rest of my, your

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:30.000
life and mine probably. Stay on target. Stay on target. And the old man says, what did you say

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:37.360
because of the rule of threes? You fucked it. You fucked it. Yeah, they're savvy. They know.

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:41.520
This has to repeat it. Like, like, like, like, he says, like, what did you say? And the frog says,

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:45.360
I said, I'm a magical frog. If you pick me up and kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful princess

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:50.320
and I'll have sex with you for the rest of your life. The old man picks up the frog, puts it

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:55.120
in his pocket, starts walking down the sidewalk, walks for a block, the frog calls out from his

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:59.200
pocket. Hey, what are you doing? I said, I'm a magic frog. And if you pick me up and kiss me,

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:02.560
I'll turn into a beautiful princess and have sex with you for the rest of your life. The old man

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:18.000
looks down at his pocket and says, I'm 75 years old. I think it's cooler to have a talking frog.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:26.880
The joke master. Next up, a burn notice. What's that, Jeffrey Rosho? The burn man. The burn.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:34.640
The burn. Man, that guy's looking weird. Is it like, does he know?

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:40.480
Are you about to roast Jeffrey Ross right now? Can you? Can you roast a roaster?

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:45.040
He's starting to look weird, isn't he? He's starting to look like the Vasquez Rock.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:50.320
Like, hey, it's becoming like a labyrinth character for sure. Speaking of labyrinths.

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:58.080
We can't, right? No, no. The women will revolt. You can hear them pop. They're like, no,

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:02.080
get, fuck you with your mirrors in your hallways. Don't go back into that dungeon.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:07.040
Well, I feel like we have a huge room here. And it's, I'm putting myself in their shoes,

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:11.840
watching the two of us drink and flounder around in a hallway. There's probably people

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:16.480
that go like, oh, look up. There's buttons all over this place. So you want to have like,

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:20.560
you want to bring somebody up who's like a little more, like maybe they could help us be like a

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:28.000
spirit guy? Do we have anybody? Oh, oh, oh, shit. We got, oh, God. Oh, no. Adam. All right, that's

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.920
shit. Get up here. Who else raised their hand over there? Okay. The two of you over there.

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:36.000
Guys, let's bring these three up for better or for worse. What are we doing?

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:44.320
Stand over in the corner like a Greek chorus. Jeff just uncorked this bottle with

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:53.840
for those of you listening in podcast world, the world's best boy band just walked on stage

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:59.680
right now. We have Adam, Adam on the left in the middle. What's your name, sir?

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:06.400
Yeah, in the middle. Doug and Adam, Doug and Colin, everybody.

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:17.280
Yeah, collectively known as Dream Weaver. Spencer, where were we?

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:25.600
When we last left our heroes, they had just broken down. Sorry, sorry, Spencer.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.520
Dan just paused a moment to Instagram. What's going on right now? This is taking a picture of

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:34.880
Dream Weaver. Dream Weaver. All right, Spencer, I'm sorry. So you want me, we keep going? Yeah.

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:38.720
Yeah, we're trucking to that doorway, right? Yeah, you just melted the door. Do you want

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:46.560
to look at it? Hell yeah. All right, you look through the door. It's a large room that extends

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:51.040
to the north and to the south. In front of you, the white beam continues on. It hits a large

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:56.720
crystal red eye, but the eye doesn't seem to be reacting to the white beam. In the room are

01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:03.520
three large pillars, each containing glass objects. In the center is a large prism,

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:09.200
and flanked on its sides are two large crystal globes. All right, well, this is like a, you know,

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:18.480
obviously like a fruity puzzle. I love riddles. Yeah, so we're going to want that prism, right?

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:22.800
Well, it's based, yeah. You know what, Dan? Rotate the prism. You and I consider all day.

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:30.000
Why don't we consult Dream Weaver? Dream Weaver, you got any ideas? Doug. First idea is light

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.240
refraction throughout the room. The crystal eye is the color red. The beam is white. You probably

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:38.880
have to turn the beam red through the crystals to hit the eye to get to the next room.

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:57.680
Doug. Didoy. One step ahead of you, Doug. All right. Does this prism rotate? Is it movable?

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:03.680
You approach the pillar. It looks like it could be slid. Hey, I got a sword. I'm going to,

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:08.960
uh, well, don't take it easy with the sword. I want to slip. I want to slip that shit. No,

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:15.600
not slit, slid. Slid. Oh, shit. Yeah. Sorry. Chop it with a sword. I'm going to chop. I'll

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:20.800
chop you with a sword. You fucking piece of shit. So if you move, if you move the prism,

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:24.560
like it was it, can you move it into the, I could murder a cigarette right now. I'll tell you.

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:31.280
You move it into the white beam and it turns. Do you want to try to do that? Yes. All right,

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:37.440
you move the, you move the pillar containing the prism. It slides into place as the white

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:43.840
beam hits it. The white beam splits into three beams, red, green and blue. The red beam continues

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:49.600
on and hits the crystal eye. It glows and you hear a far off rumble. Nice. Way to go, Doug. Nice.

01:05:49.600 --> 01:06:02.000
Dream weaver. I believe they can get us through the door. Fucking dream weaver. You guys are

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:09.120
coming back next week. So we, we, uh, so we opened another door. There's no door in this room.

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:14.960
The green and blue beams go north and south. They look like they're hitting the far walls,

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:19.600
but they're kind of near those pillars I mentioned earlier. Oh, okay. So we move the pillars into

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:24.240
the paths of their corresponding beams, right? All right. Well, do you try to do that? Yes.

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:28.080
Yeah. Well, how do you do that? Do you do it like one at a time? What's up together? We,

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:33.200
we, we work in 10 and we take the green one. I'll take the blue one and I'll be in Scotland before

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:40.480
you. All right. You synchronize your watches. You push. We have watches. No. Okay. That's lying.

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:46.800
All right. You push the, the pillars into the beams. You hear a, you hear a loud humming sound

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:52.640
and you feel a tingling sensation across your body, a pulling on your skin and then a tug behind

01:06:52.640 --> 01:07:02.000
your knave. and you feel yourself being teleported. Whoa. We're being teleported. I like it. We choose

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:12.560
to like it. You enjoy the teleportation. All right. They, they, they put the audience

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:16.720
applause. We're on a journey, man. We're all people love teleportation. We're all in this together.

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:25.600
All right. So you appear. I'll explain this to you guys. All right. There's a large open room

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:31.360
before you. You think it must be a few hundred feet and it seems to be rectangular. You can see

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:36.720
across, there's a large pit splitting the room in two. It looks to be bottomless. You can see on

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:44.400
the other side of the pit, your friend Sharpie and your friend Quark across the pit on the other side.

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:49.040
We're separated by this fissure in the middle of the room. Yes. This fissure is very wide. You

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:52.880
don't think you could jump it. It's, it's wider than the legend. So we've been separated. You've

01:07:52.880 --> 01:08:03.360
been separated. I miss you. You reach out across the void and somehow you know he can tell

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:09.120
that you're there for him. So do we need to get back together? I don't know. Do you look around?

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:18.720
Look, I'm always looking around Spencer. I look around across the chasm. You can see that red eye.

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:24.480
Wait, chasm? Chasm. Fissure, bottomless pit. Chasm. Chasm. I say words.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:30.000
Okay. Don't try, don't try to separate them. I'm sorry. I look across chasm. Sabotage.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.880
I look across the chasm and I see what? You see the beam arcing across the room. It seems to be

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:42.400
going down the path, but your path is blocked by a large crystal slab. You notice that your,

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:48.080
the orbs that you are near are glowing and emitting blue and green light in a ray.

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:54.400
It's hitting a statue. I turned my statue to reflect or catch, receive a beam. As you have

01:08:54.400 --> 01:09:01.360
said it, it happens. You melt the blue crystal to nothing. Sweet. Wait, that's bad. No. You can see

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:07.040
past the crystal. Behind it is another crystal slab. It's the same color and another statue.

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:11.840
Do we have to keep turning the statues? Maybe. I'm going to turn one more statue.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:17.200
All right. You turn the statue. It reflects the beam into the slab, but behind the slab,

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:20.800
after it disappears, is a statue of the color across the room.

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:27.920
It's just, it's hard to, uh, I'm so drunk. You know, I really turn, turn the statue. I turn

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:33.840
the statue again. All right. You turn the statue in much the same way. And it's your path is now

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:40.560
blocked by a crystal of the color of your partner across the room. Shit. Adam. Just keep turning

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:49.200
statues. So first time Adam and I have been on the same page. So now we, now we, let's set up

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:53.920
camp and just get to know each other. Can we set up camp and just have a little powwow? Yeah,

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:57.040
you can have a powwow. We're not together. Yeah. Well, I mean, you wouldn't be talking to each other.

01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:00.400
There's a Fisher across the room. You can send Hawk messages. Yeah, we can, we can, we can,

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:03.760
we can see each other and send me a Hawk message. Let's just build a little fire. Let's just,

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:11.600
let's just talk about our backstory. All right. Um, my father hit me for real. That's why I wanted

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:20.640
to learn magic. Uh, where did you study magic? Uh, at the Arcanium. That's very prestigious. Uh,

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:26.640
do you have a scholarship or did you? Oh, it's a, I, I, I born rich. No, God, no, you're one of those

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:31.920
rich wizards. No, you didn't fucking earn it. Heavens. No, no, you didn't earn it. Yeah. Yeah.

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:36.480
Anybody could go have a, uh, get a scholarship to a wizard school. Watch your characteristic

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:42.960
temper, quirk. Oh boy. Fucking. I am, I am, I am. I'll stab a wizard in a second. I am the

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:48.480
definition of a bootstrapper. I, I, I, I, I looked into the Arcanium arts because, uh, I wanted

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:54.560
to prove my father wrong about me. My father actually, and point of fact was a barbarian like you.

01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:00.080
Adam, get on mic. If you're gonna, if you're gonna start being a PT Barnum here,

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:08.240
guys, flashback to the Arcanarium where, uh, Sharpie was teased mercilessly by rich, spoiled

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:16.480
wizards played by their, you played by Dreamweaver. All right, go for it guys. It's the, uh, the

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:20.800
magical dining hall. I'm so sorry, Spencer. I'm going to apologize to you after this. I'm so sorry.

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:25.360
No, this is great. The spoiled dining hall where he sits at the poor kid's table with a scholarship

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:33.440
here. Scholarship inariums. You guys mind if I sit here? Uh, no. Yeah. What are you? I'd be mine.

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:40.480
Sharpie Bottom. New kid's school. It's Buttsalot. Yeah. Oh, all right. Yeah. I see you with your,

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:48.320
with your, your poor man spell. What was that? Tail of Newt? You know, one of these days, I'm

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:52.080
going to be an adventurer. You guys aren't going to be shit. I'm going to learn spells and I'm

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:56.480
going to detect magic. Sure you are. Yeah. Yeah. You know where all the real adventures go? The

01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:03.120
howling mines. Sharpie. You have any idea where that is? Sharpie. Well, I'm waking up. I'm waking

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:09.280
up next to the cat, the fisher and the, uh, the mines that we're in, right? Oh, sorry. No. You're

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:14.560
having a weird dream. Yeah. Sorry. Hey, hey, quark over there. Did you pick up on me having a weird

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:19.840
dream? Yeah. Yeah. You seem like you're talking in your sleep. My childhood was fucked up, man.

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:26.640
I got a lot to prove. Sometimes I wish I could, I could, I could launch into a rage like you and

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:32.720
just like, like make everything okay. I wish there was a way to, uh, get out of this, uh,

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.880
this room. All right. One, one more description of these beams of light and their configuration.

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:42.960
This is open to the whole bloody fucking nerd mode right now. Anybody has an idea right now?

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:54.480
We're aim the what? Cross the beams. Wait, I thought you said that would be bad.

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:01.680
Cross the beams. Is there a way Spencer to cross these beams? If you shoot the beams across the

01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:06.080
chasms at the other guy's wall, maybe something. I'm going to, I'm going to chasm beams. I'm going

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:11.440
to beam my chasms. We shoot the beams across the chasm at the other guy's wall. You melt the walls.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:13.440
Fuck yeah!

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:24.000
And scene. Let's get a little, let's get a little taste. Let's find out what the next

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.600
threshold is. Then we, we'll stop at this. Let's take a peek through. Melted the walls.

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:33.520
My guess, more light beams. More light beams? Maybe. More, more square mirrors or possibly

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:38.640
round mirrors. Where's the door in relation to the two guys in the, cause we're still separated

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:45.520
from a. Yeah. You don't see a door yet. However, as the, the walls dissipate, you can see. Remember

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:55.200
that red beam from earlier? How could I forget? Well, he's back. At this time, he means business.

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:05.680
You can see that the red beam is hitting a crystal that seems to be blocking it from accessing a

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:11.200
large crystal spear that's hanging in the air. Right. All right. The red beam is being blocked

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:15.680
by a blue crystal, a green crystal, and behind that a red crystal. All right. There's your

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:22.560
sneak preview of what lies in store. So we should stop it right there, you say, right?

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:27.120
Probably. Yeah. It feels like the Glendale Galleria at Christmas time. It's just. There's your

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:35.040
cliffhanger for next week. Yeah. Yeah. What, what, will the blue ray? Well, will more beams be

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:40.800
turned toward other beams? What will, what will reflect the beam? Will more telas be ported?

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.000
All right. Well, yeah, let's hear it for Dreamweaver, everybody. First, Dreamweaver,

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:55.360
our geek chorus, our geek chorus. Yeah. Geek chorus. Yeah. I have a Greek chorus or a geek

01:14:55.360 --> 01:15:04.640
chorus. Fantastic. And Spencer, our dungeon master. All right. So it's 955. We started at

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:09.280
eight, eight, 20-ish. We should, we should, we should wrap it up. How do we wrap it up? Usually,

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:13.360
we've gotten lazy. We've usually wrapped it up with a kind of rapid fire around,

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:19.200
played a hacky comedy, sporty, I'll answer questions in three words thing. We don't have that

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:24.080
lifesaver anymore. How do, how do we wrap up tonight? Do you want to do it in song?

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:30.480
I mean, I don't know. Something. How about, I don't encourage it.

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:36.960
How about, Dan, I just want you to follow your heart here. I want you to, first of all,

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:41.200
before I do this, I want you to think about what happened tonight. Yeah. I want you to think,

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.640
refresh our memory here. There was no theme tonight. We didn't fall back on that. We just

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:51.440
talked to people. Yeah. We just, we just let it happen. We just reached out. I hope we touched

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:56.880
you. You know, we talked about talking to you. We brought up, we brought up Spencer. We, we,

01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:03.600
we embarked on a, on a terrifying mission. We, we came together in our two new avatars cells.

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:07.600
We have a new segment to our show. We found out that you're terrible at telling jokes.

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:13.520
And yet, and yet when you tell a joke wrong, it becomes more delightful than a joke being told

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:23.200
properly. Right. I just say, whatever you're doing, I'm going to fail that. So then we're going to

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:28.240
be stuck here for a little longer. There's no question about that. I just say, I just say,

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:33.680
maybe just think about what happened tonight. Express, express how you're feeling now in song.

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:33.920
Okay.

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:48.400
Well, I had a good show, or maybe it was bad. It may not be the best show that a Harmontown

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:55.200
fans ever had, because if you've been to six of them, you've been to four better ones.

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:04.560
Well, that's just tough cosmic titties for $10 worth of fun.

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:09.280
Thank you for coming, everybody. Thank you for coming.

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:15.280
You got your $10 worth, I hope. If not, see us after the show, I think.

01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:21.920
Thank you, Spencer. Thank you. Thank you, Geek Chorus. Thank you, Jeff Davis for

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:25.040

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:51.760
coming down here. Spencer, Geek Chorus, one more time for your mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:56.960
Thank you. You guys are great. You're very, very wonderful and enthusiastic and patient.

01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:16.960
The campaign continues next week. Imagine how many pillars will be turned. Thank you.
