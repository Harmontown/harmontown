{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:23.920\nHere you hear you, Harmontown is now officially in session. Welcome everybody to the Nerdmelt\n\n00:23.920 --> 00:29.040\nTheater in Hollywood, California. Thank you for joining us on Podcast Land. Won't you\n\n00:29.040 --> 00:35.040\nplease join me in exalting the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:41.040 --> 00:47.040\nThat's very kind of you. You're a very spirited crowd. I like the feeling of this constituency\n\n00:47.040 --> 00:54.400\ntonight. You're good people. I walked the line tonight figuratively and literally talking to you.\n\n00:54.400 --> 01:02.560\nI don't want to get on a lot of tangents tonight. It's not a thing that we like to\n\n01:02.560 --> 01:08.800\ndo here. I try, I make it a goal to be directing to the point. Focus is the hallmark of Harmontown.\n\n01:11.120 --> 01:19.360\nFocus is job one. We make focus at Harmontown the way they make chocolate things in the\n\n01:19.360 --> 01:26.960\nKiebler Valley. You know what? They lived in the tree. Don't plug other products right now.\n\n01:26.960 --> 01:32.800\nI forgot to mention tonight's show brought to you by Nike. You know what? Slight change in\n\n01:32.800 --> 01:38.800\ntactic. Okay, bear with us. We're not caving. Tonight's show is brought to you by Nike.\n\n01:38.800 --> 01:47.440\nNike. Here's what we figured out. Nike doesn't want anything to do with us. So fuck Adidas.\n\n01:50.240 --> 01:55.200\nAdidas had what, three weeks, four weeks? Yeah, they lived high on the hog. Adidas was a\n\n01:55.200 --> 02:00.480\ncollateral benefit of our anti-Nike campaign, our hostage campaign to get Nike to pay us\n\n02:00.480 --> 02:08.480\nto stop advertising Adidas. We're refining our technique as we go. El Cata didn't perfect\n\n02:08.480 --> 02:16.240\nthings in a day. They took him like 25, 30 years. They probably, the first thing they blew up,\n\n02:16.240 --> 02:22.000\nyou don't even know what it was. It probably a rock. They blew it up, though. They moved along.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:27.120\nThey blew up a car next. But then, do you know that the official shoe of El Cata is the Nike\n\n02:27.120 --> 02:33.040\nMercurial Soccer cleats? Interesting. Tell me more. Fusing explosive speed with eye-catching\n\n02:33.040 --> 02:38.400\nstyle. The Nike Mercurial Vapor 8 gives the fastest al-Qaeda members the lethal edge.\n\n02:39.440 --> 02:47.120\nInteresting, Nike. Care to pony up, you fucking stingy cocksuckers? No, no, no, no. We like them\n\n02:47.120 --> 02:51.600\nnow. Oh, no, no. We like them. We just happened to mention El Cata like it's mustard. Right.\n\n02:52.400 --> 02:58.000\nAnd we're proudly brought to you by Nike until such time as they choose to pay up. Also,\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:04.160\nif anybody from Puma is listening, you're next, motherfuckers. Take it easy. It's the new advertising\n\n03:04.160 --> 03:11.120\nworld, new paradigm. The Nike Mercurial Soccer. I walked the line tonight. I did a new thing.\n\n03:11.120 --> 03:16.160\nUsually we get questions. You've heard, if you're listening in podcast world or you're out here,\n\n03:16.160 --> 03:20.000\nyou know how that goes. Did you walk the line in the Johnny Cash sense? That's what I'm saying.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:27.840\nI did it figuratively and literally. I definitely walked the line between sobriety and drunkenness.\n\n03:27.840 --> 03:34.720\nAnd I also walked the actual physical line in the comic book shop and met a lot of people.\n\n03:34.720 --> 03:41.520\nAnd my goal, just so you understand what I'm trying to do, I'm trying to connect with you\n\n03:41.520 --> 03:48.160\nguys. I started walking the line and I used questions initially as an excuse because I wanted\n\n03:48.160 --> 03:57.200\nto talk to people. I wanted to kind of John Stuart you. He starts the daily show. If you\n\n03:57.200 --> 04:02.240\ntune into the daily show, the first thing that happens is he goes, I forgot my kazoo and everyone\n\n04:02.240 --> 04:08.080\ncracks up because he shared some joke with them before the show. There's a bond between performer\n\n04:08.080 --> 04:16.000\nand audience. I want that. Do you feel that you achieved that tonight? No. I think that what happens\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:22.000\nis I put people off still. But I'm going to keep doing it. I saw you. You're walking around with\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:31.040\na vodka in your hand and a mayoral sash on. I was asking people, how's it going? People shrink\n\n04:31.040 --> 04:38.960\naway. You can feel them being repelled by what I have decided is my ass burgers. Having diagnosed\n\n04:38.960 --> 04:46.960\nmyself with an online quiz, which is a big salute to everyone who professionally studies this stuff.\n\n04:46.960 --> 04:52.400\nI just decided from an online quiz I have ass burgers because it's fashionable. But I feel like\n\n04:52.400 --> 05:03.360\nI'm going to off put it. Just lightly applaud. I swear I won't even look. I won't look. Just\n\n05:03.360 --> 05:11.440\nlightly applaud if you were put off by me in line tonight. Okay. Who was that? Who was it?\n\n05:11.440 --> 05:21.440\nYou saw Auntie? Auntie? Is that your friend? Jennifer? Were you just comedically clapping or\n\n05:21.440 --> 05:34.480\nwere you really put off by me? You were surprised that I was out there. It scared you. It's weird.\n\n05:34.480 --> 05:41.600\nYou read about me getting fired on a blog and then I'm next to you. Did you have a good time\n\n05:41.600 --> 05:49.440\ntonight? Well, that doesn't count. That's just you being fascinated by my majesty. You were just\n\n05:49.440 --> 05:55.040\non a trip to San Francisco and you said everywhere you went that people were recognizing you. Thank\n\n05:55.040 --> 06:00.800\nyou for calling me out on that, Jeff. That wasn't a private conversation at all. Yes, in point of\n\n06:00.800 --> 06:04.560\nfact I went to San Francisco as a private conversation. You went a sharpie in your butt in the last\n\n06:04.560 --> 06:14.080\nshow. They don't know that. That isn't broadcast yet. There's a very strange, fascinating magical\n\n06:14.080 --> 06:20.880\nand I know fleeting time from it's very, very odd. I'm not an actor or anything, an athlete or\n\n06:20.880 --> 06:28.640\nanything. I went to San Francisco and Los Angeles, you expect it. It's an industry town. Everyone's\n\n06:28.640 --> 06:35.760\nan editor or a gaffer or a boom operator, an aspiring writer. You're like, okay, I'm in the\n\n06:35.760 --> 06:41.360\ncapital. I'm in the epicenter of this stuff. Also, I'm at the epicenter chronologically of my\n\n06:42.960 --> 06:50.640\ncue rating because I was infamously, publicly, kind of crucified, slash self-crucified, whatever\n\n06:50.640 --> 06:56.880\nyou call it. You were Chevy Chase's girlfriend. Yeah, exactly. It's a very low rent Charlie Sheen,\n\n06:56.880 --> 07:02.160\nas I've said, on a very low scale. It's like, yeah, I go to three bars and the two people\n\n07:02.160 --> 07:08.000\nrecognize me. It's like an 85% rate of people. I went to San Francisco, fucking everywhere,\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:14.480\nman. I went to Exploratorium Museum and then some guy would come up and go, hey, I'm a big fan.\n\n07:14.480 --> 07:19.280\nHey, that's fantastic. Thank you. Then you look on the Twitter, people go, hey, come to the thing\n\n07:19.280 --> 07:23.280\nand then go to the thing and then another guy'd come up and go, hey, can I buy your drink? It was\n\n07:23.280 --> 07:29.360\npretty amazing. Anywhere that I didn't go, if I went to a place where somebody didn't explicitly\n\n07:29.360 --> 07:34.000\ncome up to me and say, hey, thank you, I love what you did, I would read on Twitter later,\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:39.440\nsome guy would go, holy shit, DNR, I just bought an ice cream cone here. It was really 100%.\n\n07:40.960 --> 07:45.200\nI don't know what, it matters nothing. The only thing that's going to happen is it's going to\n\n07:45.200 --> 07:49.680\nstop in a month and I'm going to, I don't know, what will I do? I'll hang myself while I'm jerking\n\n07:49.680 --> 07:56.080\noff. I don't know. Do you enjoy that experience of being recognized? I certainly have no problem\n\n07:56.080 --> 08:04.880\nwith it. If you see me in public and you are thinking for a second about whether or not\n\n08:04.880 --> 08:12.160\nyou should bound up to me and rub my head and say, I love you, go for it. I suffer no illusions\n\n08:12.160 --> 08:18.160\nabout, like I'm going to be 50 muttering into a drink that that used to happen. Go double rub my\n\n08:18.160 --> 08:26.800\nhead. Do me a big favor. That's no problem. The big question is though, is it changing my brain\n\n08:26.800 --> 08:33.440\nchemistry? Do I want it to happen? Do I care if it stops? That I don't know about. I don't know.\n\n08:33.440 --> 08:39.840\nI like to think that I'm a pretty sensible guy. That that's just, it's an oddity.\n\n08:43.120 --> 08:46.880\nThis is the least charismatic thing anyone could ever talk about. I'm done. I'm finished. I'm out.\n\n08:46.880 --> 08:50.400\nThat's the whole thing. I'll talk about it sometime when I'm a little more sober.\n\n08:51.680 --> 08:57.440\nWait, have you been drinking today, Dan? Because if I find out that you have been\n\n08:57.440 --> 09:02.720\ndrinking with me all day long, I'll be very disappointed. All right. We got on a little\n\n09:02.720 --> 09:06.640\nbit of a tangent. What were we talking about? You're talking about making her uncomfortable.\n\n09:06.640 --> 09:10.960\nOh, well, yeah, but I really didn't. I just, I just amazed you. Right. I was like, holy\n\n09:10.960 --> 09:16.400\nshit, it's Batman. Okay. No, no, no. So I didn't put anybody off. But I have a lot of social\n\n09:16.400 --> 09:20.240\nanxiety. So just so you know, I go, I go down the line. What I'm trying to do is I'm, because I\n\n09:20.240 --> 09:24.080\ndon't believe in therapy. So I'm going down the line and I'm actually experimenting with human\n\n09:24.080 --> 09:29.040\ncontact. I'm not, I'm not talking down to you guys or like doing some kind of gimmicky thing.\n\n09:29.040 --> 09:34.240\nLike I'm actually trying to, you're the only people that I meet outside of the three friends\n\n09:34.240 --> 09:38.640\nthat I have. Like, like this is a weekly thing that we do now. So like, I don't abuse it or\n\n09:38.640 --> 09:44.080\nanything. Like, but you're closer to NT than he's like number eight and your friend. Yeah.\n\n09:44.080 --> 09:51.440\nYeah. Yeah, NT. I know NT more than I know my uncles. Certainly if NT was going to get hit by a car\n\n09:51.440 --> 09:57.760\nand the only way to save him was to shove my uncle and without hesitation.\n\n09:59.680 --> 10:04.720\nWhat a hero. Yeah, especially if I could shove NT into one of my daughters just to prove that I\n\n10:04.720 --> 10:14.400\nwas a white liberal. Fucker, NT. Fucker. NT's black. So just for podcast land. And NT is\n\n10:14.400 --> 10:20.000\nthose listening at home. Stop your stopwatches. That's the first race mentioned. We got to race.\n\n10:20.960 --> 10:26.640\nWe made it to race. But Dan, that's 30 or 40 seconds later than normal. You're getting there.\n\n10:27.760 --> 10:32.480\nIn four years, we might do a whole show where you don't mention race. And I think that day\n\n10:32.480 --> 10:37.760\nour souls will die a little bit. I think I was born, I'm starting to realize I was sent here to\n\n10:37.760 --> 10:47.040\nearth to obsess about race and racism. Speaking of which, Steve Harvey is hosting Family Feud now?\n\n10:48.320 --> 10:55.040\nFor a long time. Okay, well, for quite some time, I believe. Well, I was in a hotel room. So this\n\n10:55.040 --> 11:03.600\nis the first I've heard of it. Aaron has some weird OCD neurosis where she can't get dressed\n\n11:03.600 --> 11:10.480\nin a hotel room unless the television is on. And so like, if it's only in a hotel room with Aaron\n\n11:10.480 --> 11:15.600\nthat I'm actually like subjected to normal television signals. That's the only time I watch\n\n11:15.600 --> 11:20.480\nSports Center for some reason is in a hotel. I find out what NASCAR is doing. Yeah, so she's\n\n11:20.480 --> 11:28.160\ngonna put on her skirt and her shirts or whatever you call them. And so we're watching Family Feud.\n\n11:28.160 --> 11:36.320\nThat's it. Steve Harvey, whatever. I'm disappointed in you. You know, aim higher, Steve. I don't\n\n11:36.320 --> 11:41.520\neven know you that well. But how did he let you down? Well, by being on Family Feud. Because I\n\n11:41.520 --> 11:47.040\njust noticed that this show is a celebration of mediocrity. Like beyond any, like really,\n\n11:47.040 --> 11:53.360\nno one can argue with that. They literally, they in front of your family, they stand you up and\n\n11:53.360 --> 12:01.760\nthey ask you what you think normal people said when they said something. What makes Ms. Picky\n\n12:01.760 --> 12:06.800\ndifferent from a real pig? And the person that slams the buzzard down first and goes, she has hair!\n\n12:08.640 --> 12:16.000\nThey win if the most people think like them. They win. And the person who has the slightest\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:21.920\nfucking potential to not connect dots that are right next to each other. Just on the off chance,\n\n12:21.920 --> 12:27.920\nPicasso wandered in with his family to Family Feud. He's gonna be burnt at the fucking stake on\n\n12:27.920 --> 12:34.320\nthis show. That's what it's about. You will be labeled as the reason you let your family down.\n\n12:34.960 --> 12:44.560\nYou think differently. You're an asshole. You're a psycho. What do you think everyone said when\n\n12:44.560 --> 12:51.200\nthey eat a brownie? Yummy. You win. You win. What were you gonna say asshole? A flower. Fuck you!\n\n12:51.200 --> 12:56.400\nGet out of here! Who the fuck are you? What the fuck's with you? Do you have fungus in your brain?\n\n12:56.400 --> 13:06.560\nGet away! It's like on the playground. It's a tarot family feud. Family feud, the title,\n\n13:06.560 --> 13:14.000\nlike that's a beautiful idea. Pit families against each other for sure. Make it tribal and go,\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:19.600\nokay, what makes the Harmon's different from the Johnson's? The Harmon's rule. Why do we rule?\n\n13:19.600 --> 13:27.280\nI don't know. Because we have our own language. We should win if we're able to communicate with\n\n13:27.280 --> 13:32.560\neach other better and we're weirder. I don't know how to design that game. It's not my job to make\n\n13:34.480 --> 13:38.080\ngame shows. I just know that Family Feud is definitely a celebration. What's your beef with\n\n13:38.080 --> 13:43.200\nSteve Harvey though? Well, he's participating. What are you talking about? What's my beef with\n\n13:43.200 --> 13:47.120\nanybody that hosts that show? The last guy killed himself, didn't he? Why do you think?\n\n13:48.800 --> 13:55.600\nBecause I'm sure if there was a note, I'm sure it was like I'm tired of being a cog in a human\n\n13:55.600 --> 14:01.760\ngrinder. I can't take it. Like the karmic energy has come back from out from my asshole and into\n\n14:01.760 --> 14:06.560\nmy mouth and it's like I'm poltergeisting myself. I want to die. Wait, Richard Dawson killed himself?\n\n14:06.560 --> 14:10.000\nNo, no, the guy that replaced him. Richard Dawson just died of grief, I'm sure.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:19.920\nRick Holmes? Ray Combs. Yeah, Richard Dawson just was able to sustain that toxin going through\n\n14:19.920 --> 14:24.400\nhis body. Well, because like he subverted the show by being just a fucking fantastic alcoholic.\n\n14:24.400 --> 14:30.880\nVery congenial, very congenial, very drunk. He was purple drunk. His skin took on hues.\n\n14:32.160 --> 14:37.840\nHe was just like nuclear sunset, orange, purple. Yeah, yeah. He was awesome. He was 70s drunk.\n\n14:37.840 --> 14:43.360\nYeah. Pat Noswald has a whole routine about it. If you haven't heard, I'm sure most of you had,\n\n14:43.360 --> 14:48.480\nPat Noswald is the final word on Richard Dawson's beautiful drunkenness. So then he got replaced\n\n14:48.480 --> 14:52.240\nby that guy, but that guy, I think he killed himself, didn't he? Is that true? Anybody? This guy?\n\n14:52.240 --> 15:00.240\nWhat's your name, sir? Sean Combs. Sean in our front row is a historian. Oh, is that, wait,\n\n15:00.240 --> 15:04.800\nthat's, I thought it was snap the jab for a second. It is, okay. See, the thing is you can't call\n\n15:04.800 --> 15:09.600\nyourself snap the jab. I can't tell you're Asian. Like, it's not, you're not Asian enough that you\n\n15:09.600 --> 15:14.400\ngo, oh, it's snap the jab. It's a terrible name. Change your name. His Twitter name is snap the\n\n15:14.400 --> 15:19.200\njab. I think as we go along, we're going to start amassing a full cast of characters. At some\n\n15:19.200 --> 15:23.040\npoint, the entire audience will be people that we know by first name. We have to sit them all over\n\n15:23.040 --> 15:30.880\nthere. It's like, it'll be like Hollywood Squares. Yeah. Well, that was a dead end.\n\n15:30.880 --> 15:37.040\nI just think that Family Feud should be outlawed. I don't think Dungeons and Dragons should be,\n\n15:37.040 --> 15:42.480\nbecause it's an exploration of the mind. And my, my, the most exciting thing that's going to happen\n\n15:42.480 --> 15:46.080\ntonight is Spencer's going to come up and we're going to start our first Dungeons and Dragons\n\n15:46.080 --> 15:54.320\nadventure. For those of you who are just joining us for the first time, three, three episodes ago,\n\n15:54.320 --> 15:59.280\nwe decided to play Dungeons and Dragons. Two weeks ago, we brought up a Dungeon Master Spencer.\n\n15:59.280 --> 16:04.480\nLast week, he created our characters for us. And now we're going to bring up Spencer, our Dungeon\n\n16:04.480 --> 16:06.960\nMaster. Are you ready, Spencer?\n\n16:18.320 --> 16:23.200\nDoes this thing work? Yeah. Yeah. You want me over there? Yeah. Are you comfortable? You need\n\n16:23.200 --> 16:28.320\na tabletop, right? Yeah, to roll dice on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Why don't we talk to him up here for\n\n16:28.320 --> 16:32.160\na second and then we'll, we'll send him off to the cornfield. Well, first I want Spencer and the\n\n16:32.160 --> 16:35.760\naudience to understand that anything that goes wrong tonight, because I don't think this has\n\n16:35.760 --> 16:42.800\never been attempted, a live Dungeons and Dragons-ing podcast. There might be a very good reason for that.\n\n16:43.600 --> 16:48.160\nIf, if that turns out to be the case, it's all the heats on me, man. This is not, Spencer's a\n\n16:48.160 --> 16:52.400\nstand-up guy. He volunteered, shot his hand up when we asked if there's a Dungeon Master in the\n\n16:52.400 --> 16:57.760\naudience. He, he has leapt to this duty. If this goes wrong, it's not because there's anything\n\n16:57.760 --> 17:01.920\nwrong with Spencer. I just want to make sure that's clear, because I'm sure we all become\n\n17:01.920 --> 17:07.840\nDungeon Masters because we don't want something to be wrong with us that we deeply fear is.\n\n17:08.800 --> 17:12.560\nSo I don't want to be, I don't want to push you further into psychosis. The Dungeons truly hide\n\n17:12.560 --> 17:23.440\nmy hurts and sult pains. All right. I'm back in high school already. So do you think you're\n\n17:23.440 --> 17:27.760\ncomfortable over there? Do you want that, do you want that black linen off of the table? Is that,\n\n17:27.760 --> 17:33.600\nis that not dice, dice amenable? It'll be fine. Yeah. All right. You'll be fine. Okay.\n\n17:33.600 --> 17:39.440\nSpencer, I have a question for you. How old were you when you first DM'd, when you first mastered\n\n17:39.440 --> 17:44.880\na Dungeon? Back before I knew what Dungeons and Dragons is, we used to just play pretend, you know.\n\n17:44.880 --> 17:48.640\nBut we do the same basic things. And then someone's like, Hey, have you heard of Dungeons and\n\n17:48.640 --> 17:54.800\nDragons? And we're like, Wow, let's make this more complicated. Yeah, yeah. So you were four.\n\n17:55.680 --> 17:59.520\nAll right. Oh, I guess I was in like a fourth grade. I don't know what age that is. Fantastic.\n\n17:59.520 --> 18:04.000\nI do remember, funny, I remember being in grade school. And I remember there was this kid,\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:07.920\nGod damn it. What was his name? I'll never remember it. But I wish I could give him props,\n\n18:07.920 --> 18:12.000\nbecause he really you just remind you just made me realize that was it starts so much earlier.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:16.800\nLike, all kids play make believe all kids play hot lava. There's a dinosaur and all this stuff.\n\n18:16.800 --> 18:21.600\nBut then some kids start playing football. And and then there's other kids that are like fucking\n\n18:21.600 --> 18:30.160\nhot lava just started getting good. And I remember like being on the playground and being like playing\n\n18:30.160 --> 18:35.360\nhot lava to the fucking light like hilt with two kids one one one kids name was Sean malarkey,\n\n18:35.360 --> 18:41.120\nwhich sounds like a fake name. Because his name literally means fake. I would be disappointed\n\n18:41.120 --> 18:46.000\nif it was a normal name. Your friend's names are absolutely. And then there was another kid,\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:50.880\nGod damn, I was like, God damn it. It was it was I think it was Armenian. It was like\n\n18:52.880 --> 18:56.320\nit doesn't matter. But I only want to think of it because I want to like to think that he'd\n\n18:56.320 --> 19:01.120\nwander into it and get props for it. But he was the fucking best. He would he would he would play.\n\n19:01.120 --> 19:06.720\nIt was a form of hot lava called just jaws, because jaws was popular. So the change like\n\n19:06.720 --> 19:10.960\nthere were sharks everywhere. And he would he would tell us where we were safe from the shark\n\n19:10.960 --> 19:16.320\nwater and where the sharks were and stuff. And we would just like like the 30 minute recess would\n\n19:16.320 --> 19:22.480\njust like evaporate instantly. Like you couldn't believe it like I just the eye and pulling yourself\n\n19:22.480 --> 19:27.120\naway from this world where anything was was possible and you're acting out these adventures.\n\n19:27.120 --> 19:32.480\nAnd then you have to go trudge back to math class and all this stuff. It's like, what a bummer.\n\n19:32.480 --> 19:38.720\nI'm not going to go kill myself. But but yeah, that's I never made that correlation. Actually,\n\n19:38.720 --> 19:42.320\nthat was that's the beginning of Dungeons and Dragons. It's like you hang out with your friends\n\n19:42.320 --> 19:47.600\nand you're you're improvising storytelling out on the playground. Alright, so Spencer, how do we\n\n19:47.600 --> 19:51.680\nkick this off? How do how do we begin? I think he's probably got some setup to do some physical\n\n19:51.680 --> 19:55.680\ndance. Dan has played this before back in the olden days. I've never played this before really.\n\n19:55.680 --> 20:00.880\nSo you're going to have to walk me through it. But also our audience and our listening audience\n\n20:00.880 --> 20:05.200\nthrough it. Alright, so basically, we're going to be telling a story. And I'm going to be kind of\n\n20:05.200 --> 20:10.080\nlike making the set and coming up with the non player characters. And you guys are going to be\n\n20:10.080 --> 20:15.840\nacting the parts of your player characters, which are sharpie Buttsalot and uh. And Quark.\n\n20:19.520 --> 20:27.200\nSo basically, how how it'll go down is you'll say you want to do something, and then you'll roll\n\n20:27.200 --> 20:31.520\na dice or I'll roll it for you on the table. Since I'm over here. Alright, well, there you go.\n\n20:31.520 --> 20:36.000\nAnd then I'll tell you if you like screwed up or whatever. Yeah, it's just basically he's telling\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:42.560\nus a story, but we decide what we do in the story. And then to simulate the chaos that is life,\n\n20:42.560 --> 20:47.120\nlike he rolls dice and has charts and stuff that he uses at his discretion. So\n\n20:47.120 --> 20:50.880\nhe'll be asking you what you're going to do next. You can do anything you want. Let's get it on.\n\n20:50.880 --> 20:59.920\nEverybody Spencer. The beginning of our campaign. Do campaigns have names? Do what? Do\n\n20:59.920 --> 21:04.560\ncampaigns have names? Is there a title for our campaign? I'm pretty sure sometimes they do.\n\n21:04.560 --> 21:08.960\nI didn't name this. I thought it was just like, I don't know, just anything. We used to we used\n\n21:08.960 --> 21:13.680\nto have modules when you buy when you buy them in the store, they have titles, obviously. But\n\n21:14.480 --> 21:23.360\nwe'll let Spencer set up. I can I can fill the time of him setting up. I want to I want to I\n\n21:23.360 --> 21:29.200\ngot I always forget to tell this story. Schrabs not here tonight. He came up. He told a story\n\n21:29.200 --> 21:36.640\nabout cleaning his butthole that will not soon be forgotten. But I for I account and I because\n\n21:36.640 --> 21:41.760\nthat was so exciting. I forgot to tell that my favorite Schrabs story, which is when I was on\n\n21:41.760 --> 21:46.320\nthe set of Heat Vision and Jack with him, which we co created. So we're on the set of this thing.\n\n21:46.320 --> 21:55.040\nThis is pre 9 11. The sun is different. There's no moon. Nothing, nothing that you kids are\n\n21:55.040 --> 22:00.320\nfamiliar with is we're just we're standing on a set of a Jack Black motorcycle show.\n\n22:01.760 --> 22:07.040\nAnd and that we wrote and it says that Jack drives a motorcycle through a wall. So they're\n\n22:07.040 --> 22:10.320\nmaking a wall that someone can drive through. And we're like, holy shit, we're going to get in\n\n22:10.320 --> 22:16.720\ntrouble. There's a medical guy on every TV and movie set that's for insurance purposes. There's\n\n22:16.720 --> 22:22.160\nlike a he's like a he's his job is to, you know, obviously, if someone's finger flies off, he has\n\n22:22.160 --> 22:28.320\nto reattach it or call the ambulance or whatever. But but because that rarely happens on a good set,\n\n22:28.320 --> 22:34.560\nthe medical guy tends to like hand out emergency like vitamin C powder and kind of kind of just\n\n22:34.560 --> 22:40.480\nshoot the shit with people and kind of centers around a medical thing. So this guy, this guy,\n\n22:40.480 --> 22:45.760\nthe medical guy on the set of Heat Vision and Jack was talking to me and Schrab about diet coke,\n\n22:45.760 --> 22:52.240\nbecause Rob was a headlong into a serious diet coke addiction. And and the and he's like, man,\n\n22:52.240 --> 22:56.480\nI really got to stop drinking so much diet coke. I got to stop. And the medical guy said the\n\n22:57.280 --> 23:01.200\nbecause and Rob's like, yeah, because it makes me so jittery and stuff. And the medical guy says,\n\n23:01.760 --> 23:07.920\nyeah, well, also, you know, just so you know, like, it makes your dick soft. And and Rob had this\n\n23:07.920 --> 23:13.680\nweird reaction on his face, like it didn't fit like what he was hearing. He looked like intrigue,\n\n23:13.680 --> 23:21.280\nlike, instead of repulsion and or dismissal and and and and he said, real, really? Like like like\n\n23:21.280 --> 23:34.560\nvelvet? It's like, no, Rob, but no, it makes it not erect. And Rob goes, oh, no, I thought I thought\n\n23:34.560 --> 23:44.560\nhe meant like, if you pour it over it, like, like he he wasn't kidding, man. Like, like, like Rob,\n\n23:44.560 --> 23:50.000\nI was like thinking about his dick like a Ferrari, like, like, you put a chamois on there, like,\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:54.480\nyou really give it a sheen and like, like, make it soft to the touch, like, make it irresistible.\n\n23:54.480 --> 23:59.040\nBaby, your dick is so soft tonight. I dig it in a picture of Diet Coke.\n\n23:59.040 --> 24:07.120\nI thought that was amazing. That's that's that's the price of being able to draw. Are you sure\n\n24:07.120 --> 24:11.360\nthat Rob wasn't right? I don't know that if you pour Diet Coke over your dick, it doesn't get\n\n24:11.360 --> 24:16.640\nreally soft. I don't know. Let's find out. All right. For those of you at home, I'm doing it.\n\n24:16.640 --> 24:21.920\nOh, it's really soft. I don't know where that's going. Do you want to start? Well,\n\n24:21.920 --> 24:28.160\neither way, we handed over to Spencer's hands. He's the sort of narrator of the because we don't. Yeah.\n\n24:28.160 --> 24:28.480\nAll right.\n\n24:35.920 --> 24:43.200\nAll right. Sharpie Buttsalot and Quark are on the road to a treasure vault known as the Trove.\n\n24:43.200 --> 24:47.760\nA local sage named Derevan has asked you to investigate the Trove as a result of recent\n\n24:47.760 --> 24:52.800\nscrying, having heard from beyond that a fragment of greatness is about to be revealed in this world.\n\n24:57.840 --> 25:03.360\nThe path is dirt and it's a warm sunny day in Caldona. Rolling hills stretch on to around you,\n\n25:03.360 --> 25:07.920\nbut the path ahead bends into some woods to the base of a great cliff. Oh, shit.\n\n25:07.920 --> 25:21.120\nIt's fucking Spencer, everybody. Right now. Yeah. In an ideal universe, he's Jimmy Page,\n\n25:21.120 --> 25:28.880\nlike he gets applause for his GM solo. I have a partial right now.\n\n25:32.720 --> 25:36.240\nAll right. So we're on a path and it's heading into a\n\n25:36.240 --> 25:40.880\nYeah, you're on path to go into the woods unless you guys want to like stop or something.\n\n25:41.840 --> 25:46.880\nWell, all right. Can I ask a question? Yeah, go for it. Any questions? How do we know each other?\n\n25:46.880 --> 25:52.880\nAll right. You guys are friends. You met on a mission to the howling mine and you became friends\n\n25:52.880 --> 25:57.200\nand you had ventured together and you found out that you're better and you can get paid more if\n\n25:57.200 --> 26:03.120\nyou work together as a team. No, we were kind of met as rivals, like kind of Indiana Jones and\n\n26:03.120 --> 26:09.200\nBalak. Yeah, exactly. All right. And then we if you guys want to subscribe to the prequel someday.\n\n26:10.560 --> 26:16.560\nWhat is your what's your racing? I'm a human wizard. All right. He cast spells and he has\n\n26:16.560 --> 26:22.880\nlike a hawk. I mean, I have a hawk. I guess as a known barbarian, I'm a pretty whimsical kind of\n\n26:23.760 --> 26:30.880\nan emotional guy. Yeah, for sure. I go into flights of fancy. Before I go into this wood,\n\n26:30.880 --> 26:37.120\nI probably stop and ask this human magic user wizard what he thinks is best. I mean, well,\n\n26:37.120 --> 26:44.400\nI would sharpie Buttsalot. What do you think? I would say that because I have a hawk familiar,\n\n26:44.400 --> 26:50.000\nand you tell me, Spencer, what's allowed with these familiars? I would say, is this like a Beast\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:55.120\nMaster situation? Can I send the hawk up to get like a literal bird's eye view? You can't like\n\n26:55.120 --> 26:59.200\nread his mind, but when he comes back, you can like look at him and know what he's seen, you know?\n\n26:59.200 --> 27:04.080\nReally? Yeah. Like to the point where it's like a like, I can know the terrain and not quite to\n\n27:04.080 --> 27:09.360\nthat extent. It's not that smart, but yeah, but better better safe than not. Oh, there's a cliff.\n\n27:09.360 --> 27:13.840\nOh, there's some trees. I don't know. Or there's a giant like if there was. I mean, I'm not going\n\n27:13.840 --> 27:17.920\nto tell you yet. Well, no, no, I know. But yeah, definitely. Okay, all right. Well, I was saying,\n\n27:17.920 --> 27:24.720\nyou know, why not? That's a fair question. Let's go in the woods. I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm\n\n27:24.720 --> 27:31.680\nspoiling for a fight. Take it easy, Quark. You're so you love cigarettes and riddles. I'm sorry.\n\n27:32.640 --> 27:35.200\nOh, I have a riddle for you. Okay.\n\n27:38.400 --> 27:45.760\nIs it about cigarettes? What did what? What did one octopus say to the other octopus?\n\n27:45.760 --> 27:58.400\nUh, Inc. No, no, no. I get mad. Easy, easy. I want to hold your hand, hand, hand, hand,\n\n27:58.400 --> 28:01.760\nhand, hand, hand, hand. All right. Well, that makes no sense to me because there's no Beatles in\n\n28:01.760 --> 28:10.000\nthis universe. To my knowledge. I know no one's going to get jiggy with anything. If we didn't\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:18.320\nhave so much success in the Keldar on mind, or whatever the fuck, what did we learn? We learned\n\n28:18.320 --> 28:25.840\nto work together. Yeah. All right. So look, an ounce of prevention dot dot dot. Right. I'm going\n\n28:25.840 --> 28:33.280\nto send my hawk up. What's my hawk's name? Avenger. He's got a cooler name than I do.\n\n28:33.280 --> 28:40.640\nThe audience didn't pick it. No, no, no, no. I'm going to send my hacky hawk's name up into the\n\n28:41.600 --> 28:47.760\nether and see what he says. If he comes down, see if he has any alarms about what he sees ahead\n\n28:47.760 --> 28:52.880\nof us. You're too cautious. You're too cautious. Quirk, listen, my caution, as you know, has\n\n28:52.880 --> 28:59.600\nsometimes saved our necks. The hawk returns. All right. You catch him on your arm. Avenger.\n\n28:59.600 --> 29:03.520\nWhat? See you.\n\n29:09.520 --> 29:11.520\nI'm sorry. I'm sorry. He probably doesn't understand that.\n\n29:13.840 --> 29:16.640\nI'm sorry. I just, I just went to heaven for a moment.\n\n29:20.080 --> 29:23.840\nThis is the whole game. You spent your whole high school years getting laid. Like, see what you\n\n29:23.840 --> 29:34.720\nmissed? Speakers to a gnome? What would be high school? All right. Avenger, what, what, what, what\n\n29:34.720 --> 29:44.000\nsay you? He said he sees four little looking people at the, at the base of a big cliff hitting a\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:51.760\ndoor. Hmm. That sounds like there's four little people hitting the base of a, I'm a, I'm a little\n\n29:51.760 --> 29:55.520\npeople. Let's go help those little people out. All right. Well, it sounds like, yeah, certainly\n\n29:55.520 --> 29:59.360\nif you saw anything worse than that, we would have heard about it. I'm going to rush, let's rush\n\n29:59.360 --> 30:05.680\nheadlong toward that door. How, how, how would you have an eye in the distance between us and that\n\n30:05.680 --> 30:12.880\nevent? You head, head or you rush headlong towards the door. All right. Just like I said. All right.\n\n30:12.880 --> 30:19.760\nLesson learned. Walk, walk, walk, walk. Hey, uh, hey, uh, Sharpie, uh, what's red and smells like\n\n30:19.760 --> 30:32.640\nblue paint? Red paint. Nobody ever gets that. All paint smells the same. Do you need a cigarette?\n\n30:34.640 --> 30:38.320\nHave you got one? Jesus Christ. I'm trying to quit.\n\n30:41.680 --> 30:48.560\nAll right. Do we do it? How far to the, you charge across the bend and you see a clearing.\n\n30:48.560 --> 30:52.080\nThere's the base of the cliff with the large door, just as a venture had mentioned. And you\n\n30:52.080 --> 30:57.520\nsee in front of it, four goblins trying to puzzle out how to get in. They don't seem to notice you\n\n30:57.520 --> 31:02.160\nyet. Goblins. These are, this is not cool, man. Are they friendly? No, no, they're goblin. I have a\n\n31:04.320 --> 31:12.400\nlook. Let's just, let's just go away. No, I agree. What's in the, what's behind the door? Well,\n\n31:12.400 --> 31:16.560\nwe're first level. Yeah. We don't, I don't think we should fuck with four goblins either. I gotta\n\n31:16.560 --> 31:21.600\nsay though, my, my natural barbarian curiosity wants to know what's behind that door. It's for\n\n31:21.600 --> 31:25.280\na goblin to try to get in. Well, that's where we're going. We, the, the, the scryer that told us to\n\n31:25.280 --> 31:30.720\ncome here. How about this? Let me go talk to the goblins. I can't talk to goblins. I'm short.\n\n31:30.720 --> 31:34.560\nI'm short. They'll, they'll, they'll, they'll, they'll see me as one of their own. There's no\n\n31:34.560 --> 31:39.760\ntalking to goblins, man. They're like monsters. They're absolute monsters. If you can, I don't,\n\n31:39.760 --> 31:43.840\non the back page, they'll say the languages at the bottom, not that the other one.\n\n31:43.840 --> 31:51.120\nYeah. But the page behind that towards the bottom languages. All right. Do you see languages?\n\n31:51.120 --> 31:56.240\nYeah. Yeah. Does it say goblin? No. What does it say? Common gnome giant. All right. You don't\n\n31:56.240 --> 32:03.680\nspeak goblin. All right. Common elvish dwarf orc undercom, undercom. I studied it in high school,\n\n32:03.680 --> 32:09.840\nbut I, I only remember like a few words. You realize that goblins might speak undercommon.\n\n32:09.840 --> 32:13.600\nOh, really? Man. I also speak of Bissell in case we run into James Cameron.\n\n32:20.240 --> 32:24.640\nOkay. So can, can, as background, as a guy in this world, I would know this. I'm just asking\n\n32:24.640 --> 32:29.920\nyou a common knowledge question. Are goblins ever anything other than thuggish bastards? Like, are\n\n32:29.920 --> 32:34.880\nthey, is there any point in ever talking to them? Or, I mean, they've been known to form societies,\n\n32:34.880 --> 32:42.000\nbut, you know, generally they cause a menace. All right. Well, look, I say, I'm a plus one\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:47.760\nattacking goblinoids. What's a goblinoid? That's a goblin or goblinoid. Let's fuck them up, man.\n\n32:47.760 --> 32:54.480\nLet's just do it. Let's fuck them up. Let's go fuck these goblins up. All right. Right? Audience?\n\n32:54.480 --> 33:01.440\nYeah. Okay. All right. I think, I feel the gods urging us on. So here's the thing. But wait,\n\n33:01.440 --> 33:06.640\nwait, wait. Don't do it yet. Don't do it yet. No, no, no. I have a crossbow. I'm good with a crossbow.\n\n33:06.640 --> 33:10.080\nYeah. They still haven't noticed you. We can take one out before you fly into a rage. All right.\n\n33:10.080 --> 33:14.960\nSo I want to fire my crossbow at one of them. All right. You aren't the best shot, but let's try it.\n\n33:17.920 --> 33:23.440\nSharpie. You fire a bolt loose from your crossbow. It whizzes past the goblin and\n\n33:23.440 --> 33:29.600\nthunks in the cliffside. Son of a bitch. Now they know we're here. Now they know they're here.\n\n33:29.600 --> 33:33.200\nThis is, this is time for my catchphrase, which is, oh, sorry.\n\n33:36.800 --> 33:37.760\nYou'll hear it a lot.\n\n33:41.680 --> 33:45.520\nOkay. Well, flying to a rage. I'm going to go study magic. I mean,\n\n33:46.560 --> 33:50.720\nSpencer, what are my chances of taking on four goblins on my own? You can run up to one and hit\n\n33:50.720 --> 33:56.560\nit. Let's do it. Let's fucking light this fucking firecracker and see what happens. Launching yourself\n\n33:56.560 --> 34:02.640\nat the goblin. You draw your sword and then a clean slice slash slash at him. He rolls the dice.\n\n34:04.080 --> 34:05.600\nYou hit the goblin. Yeah.\n\n34:10.320 --> 34:15.120\nNever had a lesson. He is cleft in twain. Sorry, whatever. He is cleft in twain.\n\n34:15.120 --> 34:32.160\nCleft in twain. I think ray of frost sounds pretty aggressive. Yeah, for sure. I would like to cast\n\n34:32.160 --> 34:38.720\nray of frost. With a magical gesture of your hand, a ray of frost fires forth towards the goblin.\n\n34:38.720 --> 34:48.480\nYou hit the goblin. And he freezes and falls and shatters into pieces.\n\n34:52.320 --> 34:55.440\nYeah. If you were to hit that first one with a crossbow, we don't have one dude left.\n\n34:56.720 --> 34:59.120\nI'm practicing. It's my B plan.\n\n35:00.400 --> 35:03.280\nCrossbow. It's the goblin's turn. He uses a cigarette right now.\n\n35:03.280 --> 35:10.960\nGod dammit. Goblin's turn. Wait, is it my turn? No, it's the goblin's turn. They whirl around\n\n35:10.960 --> 35:15.840\nand notice that two of their brethren lie slain on the floor. They scatter like ants.\n\n35:17.040 --> 35:21.200\nDid we scare them off? You scared them off. We said they fucking did. If you kill two of them\n\n35:21.200 --> 35:23.920\nbefore they turn around, we're like the cactus bunch.\n\n35:23.920 --> 35:31.680\nDan and Jeff are hugging everybody. It's a tender moment.\n\n35:36.400 --> 35:40.880\nSpencer, Spencer, I'd say if you'd be willing, when you stay put, like kind of like the Paul\n\n35:40.880 --> 35:48.000\nSchaefer to a very nerdy tonight show or whatever, David Letterman hosts. Because we may need to\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:52.480\ncome back to this because it's already working. Let's just talk about our buttholes.\n\n35:52.480 --> 35:56.880\nYeah, because now we're at the door and we sent these goblins are running, right?\n\n35:56.880 --> 36:01.760\nYeah, that's the case. It's a little bit of a nice little breaking bad AMC commercial break\n\n36:01.760 --> 36:07.680\nfor our Dungeons & Dragons adventure. We just created what can only be described as podcast\n\n36:07.680 --> 36:15.520\nhistory. Yeah, no, it's podcast dynamite. If Garrison Keeler knew how to do this shit, he\n\n36:15.520 --> 36:23.600\nwould have done it. Speaking of goblins, holy shit, think of this segue. This is what I wanted\n\n36:23.600 --> 36:28.960\nto share with people. Halloween is quickly approaching. Now, here's the thing. We decided\n\n36:29.680 --> 36:35.440\nwe're all dressing as Jareth from Labyrinth for Halloween. I'm sorry I burped while telling you\n\n36:35.440 --> 36:42.000\nthat. Yeah, we were watching Erin McGathy, Dan's girlfriend, made us watch Labyrinth,\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:46.240\nwhich is one of, you could say it's your favorite movie or among your favorite movies.\n\n36:49.520 --> 36:53.440\nYour favorite movie growing up. So we watched it and I hadn't seen it in a long time and\n\n36:53.440 --> 36:58.640\nDavid Bowie, if you've never seen the movie, if you don't recall, David Bowie has a number of\n\n36:58.640 --> 37:05.520\nawesome costumes. He's got big like rock and roll hair and generally a giant cock like a huge cod\n\n37:05.520 --> 37:11.840\npiece and high boots and he's kind of an asshole on it. But so is everybody. That's a movie full\n\n37:11.840 --> 37:16.400\nof bad people. So we decided that we were all going to have a competition on Halloween that\n\n37:16.400 --> 37:21.200\nit was, we're all going to dress as Jareth Bowie's character from Labyrinth and may the best Jareth\n\n37:21.200 --> 37:30.080\nwin. But we wanted, whenever our closest Harmontown is to Halloween, we invite any of you here\n\n37:30.080 --> 37:34.880\ntonight or listening to come as Jareth because Dan and I certainly will be dressed as Jareth.\n\n37:34.880 --> 37:39.120\nYeah. Aaron almost absolutely certainly. And what we'd like to have is a\n\n37:39.120 --> 37:46.480\na nerd melt full of Jareth's. Just a bunch of Jareth's for better or for worse. We might have\n\n37:46.480 --> 37:51.280\na little talent show or a little costume contest and then we're going to all go to one bar together\n\n37:52.640 --> 38:01.280\nand we're going to take that bar over and my deep abiding wish is that we go to a bar where one guy\n\n38:01.280 --> 38:12.000\nwas dressed as Jareth. It goes, oh, you've got to be shitting me. We would like to confuse Los Angeles.\n\n38:13.040 --> 38:17.600\nAlthough we can all just go to a bar like the Roxy or something like that, the Rainbow Rumors,\n\n38:17.600 --> 38:20.880\nlike something in the sunset strip and they'd all just think we were Nikki Six or some shit.\n\n38:21.840 --> 38:27.120\nAre you feeling what I'm feeling? D&D withdrawal. Oh, shit. Don't you feel that? It's like,\n\n38:27.120 --> 38:31.760\ngod damn it. That's why that's why I was fine. I can fairly hear the creek of that door.\n\n38:34.400 --> 38:40.000\nAs the corpses of those goblins lie rotting in the noon sun. Spencer. So we're at this door.\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:46.000\nWe sent these goblins a scattered. So what is this door? Can we describe this door to us?\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:51.360\nAll right. Yeah. The path ends at a bottom of a sheet rock face. The natural rock extends upwards\n\n38:51.360 --> 38:56.480\nhundreds of feet to end in a cliff. Your path is flanked by trees. Channels are etched in the rock\n\n38:56.480 --> 39:01.040\ncarved by ages of trickling streams, paths down the cliffside. But in the heat of the summer,\n\n39:01.040 --> 39:06.320\nit's all dry. Jesus Christ, did you write that? Yeah, that's part of the job. Fuck you.\n\n39:08.080 --> 39:14.880\nYeah. What the hell? Said in the rock surface is a large gold door and a large gold arch standing\n\n39:14.880 --> 39:20.320\na good 12 feet tall. The door lacks any handles or hinges, but its surface is marred by scratches\n\n39:20.320 --> 39:26.800\nand cuts. Of course. Yeah. Many, many men have been here before us and tried in vain, just as\n\n39:26.800 --> 39:32.320\nthose goblins were. We're going to have to approach this with the minds of, of, of, of, of sentience.\n\n39:34.480 --> 39:39.200\nAll right. So Quark, I'm going to confess. I drank a little bit before the campaign.\n\n39:40.400 --> 39:44.240\nI have to hang a leak. Let's get inside. Well, I don't think it's that easy, Quark.\n\n39:44.240 --> 39:50.720\nThe arches keystone has large pearl colored eye whose lid is shut tightly. It appears to be made\n\n39:50.720 --> 39:55.600\nof a living material. The eye, there's like an eyelid in the door that's made of living material.\n\n39:55.600 --> 40:00.560\nYeah. It's at the top of the door, like above the door. Oh, above the, in the arch. It's made of\n\n40:00.560 --> 40:06.400\na living material. Spencer, do I have any, any talent or skills that might, you can, you can\n\n40:06.400 --> 40:11.600\nlook around. You can maybe inspect the door. You can look, look on the floor. That's a skill.\n\n40:11.600 --> 40:17.520\nLooking around is a skill, I promise. Spencer, I'm going to invoke my God given right to look around.\n\n40:19.840 --> 40:24.480\nYou see a small square divot on the ground. It looks to be about 10 inches square.\n\n40:24.480 --> 40:27.200\nIt has dust on it, but the dust has been recently disturbed.\n\n40:28.560 --> 40:31.760\nI think there's a thing that goes in the divot. And that's like an Indiana Jones thing.\n\n40:33.120 --> 40:38.880\nThat, you know, if you have any stuff in your inventory, you can use it. Oh, nice, nice hint.\n\n40:38.880 --> 40:44.320\nAll right. If you have any stuff in your inventory, you're going to use it.\n\n40:44.320 --> 40:48.320\nRoll a burlap sack and plant the steel. I got seven throwing names. Holy fuck.\n\n40:50.560 --> 40:55.280\nA compass, a ball of twine. I was a bed roll. I can't stick my backpack in it. That's just stupid.\n\n40:56.480 --> 41:03.200\nWhat is this? Small 10 inch square. Use that. Use that. What is it? What does it say? Square?\n\n41:03.200 --> 41:07.760\nWhat? Mirror. Mirror. Stick it in there. It's going to shine a light. It's going to shine a light.\n\n41:07.760 --> 41:11.920\nWhy do I have a small 10 inch square mirror? Just for the hell of it? It's used for scrying sometimes.\n\n41:11.920 --> 41:17.840\nOh, okay. All right. So I, look, I'm no wizard and I'm no human. I'm saying stick it in there.\n\n41:17.840 --> 41:22.560\nI think the sun's going to beam in there and then here's what, here's what goblins couldn't figure\n\n41:22.560 --> 41:29.600\nout. I put my small 10 inch square mirror into the divot so that the sun reflects into the eyeball.\n\n41:29.600 --> 41:33.280\nAs you have said it, it happens. The light streams into the eye.\n\n41:33.280 --> 41:36.800\nDon't read ahead, Dan.\n\n41:38.160 --> 41:42.800\nThe eye winks open and you see that it's made out of a giant crystalline substance.\n\n41:42.800 --> 41:45.600\nIt starts to glow. The door disappears.\n\n41:47.040 --> 41:54.720\nNice. You know what? I gotta say, Sharpie, Sharpie, let's just take this moment.\n\n41:56.080 --> 41:57.200\nIt's like we can't lose.\n\n41:57.200 --> 42:02.400\nYou can see there seems to be swinging pendulums down the hall.\n\n42:02.400 --> 42:06.320\nThe hall looks to be covered in gold. I got a bad feeling about that.\n\n42:06.320 --> 42:09.760\nWell, I don't like these pendulums. Swinging pendulums. Yeah. Sounds like booby traps.\n\n42:09.760 --> 42:14.400\nYeah. Can I use my low light vision that I have here?\n\n42:14.400 --> 42:17.680\nYeah. You can make out charred skeletons on the ground.\n\n42:18.720 --> 42:21.200\nCharred skeletons. Okay. This seems like a fucking.\n\n42:21.200 --> 42:29.520\nSeems like a pendulum driven torch trap. I'm making it up. All right, so how do we proceed here?\n\n42:29.520 --> 42:31.760\nWell, you're tiny. Maybe if you just run ahead.\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:44.400\nIt's a bad pitch, but you know. I would like to cast Detect Magic.\n\n42:44.400 --> 42:51.760\nAll right, you Detect Magic. We would all like to cast Detect Magic.\n\n42:51.760 --> 42:57.360\nIt's a spell that I know, asshole. You Detect strong magical ores coming from the\n\n42:57.360 --> 43:00.960\neye that seems to be glowing and coming from inside the dungeon.\n\n43:00.960 --> 43:05.840\nAll right. Well, okay. No big surprise there. Burn that up.\n\n43:06.480 --> 43:10.960\nAll right. Look, we got, we got, we got, I don't, we got pendulums and we got charged skeletons.\n\n43:10.960 --> 43:14.880\nI've got small size, man. I can, maybe I can, I can weedle my way through there.\n\n43:14.880 --> 43:17.200\nJust go crawl, just crawl in there. All right. I'm going to, I'm going to try to\n\n43:17.200 --> 43:20.640\ncrawl through there. You enter the room. It's actually a large hallway.\n\n43:21.600 --> 43:26.960\nIt goes down about 60 feet and it's interspersed by golden pendulums that swing back and forth.\n\n43:26.960 --> 43:30.320\nAre they sharp and scary? They aren't sharp and scary, but their pendulums\n\n43:30.320 --> 43:34.480\nhold crystal lenses that seem to be focusing a white beam that's shooting from the eye and\n\n43:34.480 --> 43:42.000\nthe door frame down the hallway as. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Tomb Raider.\n\n43:44.080 --> 43:46.800\nNo, what do you, what are you thinking? I'm not thinking anything.\n\n43:47.600 --> 43:51.600\nAs the pendulum swing, you notice that they break the white beam of light and reflect it\n\n43:51.600 --> 43:56.800\nacross the room. It seems dangerous, but down the hall, the white light is attempting to melt\n\n43:56.800 --> 44:06.320\nthrough a door. Let's stop those pendulums. How do we do it? I don't know. I'm so drunk.\n\n44:06.320 --> 44:12.080\nI got to have you with me in this mission. I really, I thought this would be easier.\n\n44:13.360 --> 44:19.920\nI got so much paperwork here. I'm really starting to regret my choice to be an adventurer.\n\n44:19.920 --> 44:28.400\nSo my dad wanted me to make chairs. I'm making that up about my character.\n\n44:31.040 --> 44:36.160\nShould have made chairs? So how do we attempt this? Can we just go up and physically stop\n\n44:36.160 --> 44:40.160\nthese pendulums from moving? You can definitely try. Yeah, let's try that shit. I want to go\n\n44:40.160 --> 44:43.280\nup and stop one of these pendulums. All right, you walk up to a pendulum and\n\n44:43.280 --> 44:50.480\nattempt to stop it. Let's roll. All right. You grab onto it, but you can't stop it.\n\n44:50.480 --> 44:54.560\nIt starts to swing. Do you let go? You think your fingers might get smashed if you don't\n\n44:54.560 --> 45:00.560\nlet go? I'll let go. All right. You let go. The pendulum is still swinging freely. You haven't\n\n45:00.560 --> 45:05.520\nseemed to stop it. Maybe something in the room can stop it. Let's look around. Yeah, we'll look\n\n45:05.520 --> 45:12.720\naround. Look around. God damn it. All right. Well, you don't see anything I'm afraid,\n\n45:12.720 --> 45:18.080\nbut Sharpie spies that a square on the floor looks a different color of gold than the rest\n\n45:18.080 --> 45:23.200\nof the floor. All right. Well, then I said they put the mirror in the square. It's not a divot.\n\n45:23.200 --> 45:27.120\nYou can put the mirror on the square. Yeah, put the mirror on the square. All right. You put the\n\n45:27.120 --> 45:38.720\nmirror on the square. It is sitting on the floor. Johnass. I look up on the ceiling from where the\n\n45:38.720 --> 45:44.080\nsquare on the floor is. You notice a button on the ceiling. Okay. All right. How high is it? Can\n\n45:44.080 --> 45:48.480\nI reach it? You might be able to boost quark on your shoulders and he can reach it. All right.\n\n45:49.120 --> 45:54.560\nDon't you even fucking think about it. Remember what happened on the calderon mine?\n\n45:56.720 --> 46:02.720\nJust please, can you once stop riddling and... I still have a scar on my head. Get on my shoulders\n\n46:02.720 --> 46:06.080\nand press the button. You son of a bitch. We'll edit out the parts where we couldn't figure this\n\n46:06.080 --> 46:12.880\nout for a long time. All right. And we're going to seem like gods. Wait, Sharpie, let me get in your\n\n46:12.880 --> 46:23.440\nshoulders. All right. Quark gets on Sharpie's shoulders if it's possible. It is possible. The\n\n46:23.440 --> 46:33.680\nbutton is pushed. The first pendulum grinds to a halt. Are there any more buttons? Well,\n\n46:33.680 --> 46:39.440\nthere's probably two more, right? Do you look on the ceiling? I did. I look on the ceiling. You\n\n46:39.440 --> 46:46.160\nsee two more buttons down the hallway. Push that shit, motherfucker. All right. You successfully\n\n46:46.160 --> 46:51.120\npush the buttons. The pendulums grind to the halt. I was going to waste a ball of twine on that.\n\n46:54.320 --> 47:01.280\nSharpie, what did one elevator say to the other elevator? Need a lift?\n\n47:01.280 --> 47:07.840\nNo. No. I think I'm coming down with something.\n\n47:09.360 --> 47:11.600\nIt's got less riddles. In the middle of the campaign,\n\n47:11.600 --> 47:17.680\nI love riddles. All right. So we press all the buttons and the pendulums all stop.\n\n47:18.560 --> 47:22.160\nThe beam is focused through the pendulums and it melts the door. The door dissipates.\n\n47:22.880 --> 47:27.360\nAll right. So far so good. Another stopping point. We should probably camp here for the\n\n47:27.360 --> 47:37.600\nnight. Yeah. Spent for everybody. It's our fault.\n\n47:40.960 --> 47:44.880\nLike, I mean, if it's going to take us 20 minutes to get through a bloody door.\n\n47:44.880 --> 47:50.080\nWell, that's the thing. It's Dungeons and Dragons. It's not, you know, it's not Die Hard,\n\n47:50.080 --> 47:54.320\nyou know? You're never 90 minutes from John McClain saving the day. That's the appeal of Dungeons\n\n47:54.320 --> 47:59.600\nand Dragons. I like that you and I and the audience here who I can, I really can sense they were\n\n48:01.200 --> 48:07.040\nwrapped. Did you notice, I don't want to play into a stereotype, but did you notice the couple of\n\n48:07.040 --> 48:11.200\nexasperated sighs and kind of get on with it? The female voices, like it was like,\n\n48:13.600 --> 48:21.680\nsomething about women, they can sense a waste of time before a man can. It's a sexist cliche,\n\n48:21.680 --> 48:25.840\nbut they're more intuitive. They just know when something's not worth. But as we get better,\n\n48:25.840 --> 48:31.200\nwe're going to start looking around more, right? No, yeah. First of all, we can set up like a\n\n48:31.200 --> 48:35.920\nlooking around macro. You know, we just hit that button. We look around, we look around. Control\n\n48:35.920 --> 48:43.360\nF means like a look around. Well, yeah, you liked it when you cleaved that guy in twain. It felt\n\n48:43.360 --> 48:49.920\ngood. It felt real good. All right. What else did we talk about? I'm trying to pour a drink,\n\n48:49.920 --> 48:54.880\nlike, control for a change. Can we talk about, let's see what we got here. I want to talk for a\n\n48:54.880 --> 49:02.160\nmoment about you. Dan Harmon is a writer. Thank you. He's a writer. And yet most of my writer\n\n49:02.160 --> 49:07.920\nfriends are completely incapable of telling an actual joke. Oh, right, right, right. Dan can't\n\n49:07.920 --> 49:13.920\ntell a joke. You would think that's an easy thing. A joke is simply a quick three act play. A guy\n\n49:13.920 --> 49:18.400\ngoes into a bar. The guy says this and the punch line is that it's a boom, boom, boom, three act\n\n49:18.400 --> 49:24.000\nplay. I'm a terrible joke teller. You're the worst at it. And we try to coach you on telling a joke.\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:28.800\nTo the point where I swear to God, I've tried to tell the same joke a thousand times and I still\n\n49:28.800 --> 49:33.440\ncan't tell it. Because you get caught up in the, is it stage fright or is it the idea? I don't know\n\n49:33.440 --> 49:39.040\nwhat it is. I don't know what it is. Try to tell the Walder's Masked Joke because there's a joke.\n\n49:39.040 --> 49:43.120\nAll right. Okay, okay, okay. Do you remember the joke? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And don't, don't\n\n49:43.120 --> 49:49.120\nintentionally. No, no, I'm not going to fuck it up on purpose. I swear to God, I'm going to try to tell. I think this and I'm not trying to\n\n49:49.120 --> 49:56.240\nover, like to tee this too high. I think the Walder's Masked Joke is the finest joke, joke ever written.\n\n49:57.280 --> 50:03.360\nAnd it's, you have to finesse it. It has to be just right. So here's Dan Harmon trying to tell.\n\n50:03.360 --> 50:06.960\nOkay, all right. The Walder's Masked Joke. So there's this eight year old kid\n\n50:06.960 --> 50:14.960\nand he's walking on the side of a road and he finds a Walder's Mask. So he puts it on his head\n\n50:15.840 --> 50:19.440\nand he flips it down and he flips it back up and he flips it down and he's like,\n\n50:19.440 --> 50:23.360\nah, it's a Walder's Mask. It's fun. Fun to have one on.\n\n50:23.360 --> 50:33.680\nAnd he's walking down the road on a pickup truck. Pickup truck rolls up alongside him on the road.\n\n50:37.840 --> 50:45.600\nAnd the driver says, hey kid, do you want a ride from me? And the kid goes, hey, fine.\n\n50:45.600 --> 50:53.520\nAnd he gets in the, gets in the truck and he's driving with the guy and the kid,\n\n50:53.520 --> 50:59.200\nthe kid flips the Walder's Mask down, flips it back up. He's playing with it. It's fun to\n\n50:59.200 --> 51:05.600\nhave a Walder's Mask as a kid. It's more fun for them than it is for a Walder, for a certain,\n\n51:05.600 --> 51:15.440\nfor a Walder, it's just vocational banality. It's something you do to protect your eyes.\n\n51:15.440 --> 51:20.480\nFor a kid, it's like exciting. He feels like Darth Vader. So he's just playing with it.\n\n51:21.040 --> 51:26.320\nAnd the guy driving the pickup is driving the kid along and he goes like, hey kid,\n\n51:27.200 --> 51:42.400\nhey, have you ever heard of massage? And the kid flips the Walder's Mask up and goes like,\n\n51:42.400 --> 51:50.320\nuh, no, no. He flips it back down. The guy drives a little longer and goes, hey kid,\n\n51:50.320 --> 51:59.440\nhave you ever heard of fellatio? The kid flips the Walder's Mask back up. No, no, no. He flips\n\n51:59.440 --> 52:06.560\nit back down. Driving for a little while longer. Long pause. Twice as long as the last two because\n\n52:06.560 --> 52:17.120\nhere it comes. The guy says, hey kid, have you, do you know what a, what a pedophile is? And the\n\n52:17.120 --> 52:22.160\nkid flips up his mask in exasperation and goes, look, I got to tell you, I'm not a real welder.\n\n52:28.080 --> 52:31.200\nJeff's giving it to him. See, I can't tell that joke right, apparently. Yeah.\n\n52:31.200 --> 52:37.040\nI don't know. If you tell that joke right, these people erupt into a pause. First of all,\n\n52:37.040 --> 52:40.640\nthe kid puts the Walder's Mask on, he gets in the car and the guy says, do you know what fellatio\n\n52:40.640 --> 52:45.760\nis? The kid says no. Do you know what sodomy is? The kid says no. Do you know what a pedophile is?\n\n52:45.760 --> 52:49.600\nAnd the kid says, look, mister, I got to be honest with you. I'm not really a welder.\n\n52:51.360 --> 52:55.520\nFunnier? I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. I'm very concise. I can't tell jokes. You're right.\n\n52:55.520 --> 53:00.720\nDo you have another joke? Yeah. Yeah. The other one I've never been able to tell correctly is the\n\n53:00.720 --> 53:08.640\nduck one. Why am I identifying it with you? I'm sorry to tell it. Okay. So, and I'm covering my\n\n53:08.640 --> 53:14.480\neyes. Before you tell this, what do you think your problem is with telling jokes? It's because\n\n53:14.480 --> 53:18.240\nI'm trying to put myself in the play. I'm trying to describe to the audience a situation that's\n\n53:18.240 --> 53:27.200\nhappening. It's important to be there. I think it's because jokes are purely semantic. There's\n\n53:27.200 --> 53:37.520\na semantic cadence. It's like punnery. It's a deception because it really has nothing to do\n\n53:37.520 --> 53:42.560\nwith the actual scene that's happening. And yet it seems like it is. It seems like a guy's walking\n\n53:42.560 --> 53:45.760\ninto a bar. You need to picture the guy walking into the bar. I always picture the guy walking\n\n53:45.760 --> 53:49.680\ninto the bar. I'm trying to make my bad joke telling sound like it's part of a huge gift.\n\n53:51.520 --> 53:56.480\nI'm just bad at telling jokes. I'm just trying to describe what happens in my brain. I try to\n\n53:56.480 --> 54:02.800\ntell the joke and I remember the joke because I remember what happened to who. And then I start,\n\n54:02.800 --> 54:07.360\nso then I go there and then I don't say the right combination of words right. Because the kids\n\n54:07.360 --> 54:11.440\nare supposed to say the certain combination of words. It's with a land that joke of this Jeffrey\n\n54:11.440 --> 54:18.080\nRoss fucking tough crowd with Colin Quinnway. Those guys know how to do it and I'm stuck in the\n\n54:18.080 --> 54:23.120\nmoment. The kids get in the truck and he could get raped if he's not careful. I think when you're\n\n54:23.120 --> 54:28.480\ntelling a joke that you feel the silence that you're hearing, when people are listening to the\n\n54:28.480 --> 54:34.080\njoke as some sort of indictment. No, no, no, it's not that. I swear to God it's not that.\n\n54:34.080 --> 54:38.000\nAll right, so let's hear the duck one. Like really just fire off from the fucking hip.\n\n54:38.000 --> 54:45.760\nA guy walks into a whorehouse and he says, what do you got for me? I want to have a whore encounter.\n\n54:45.760 --> 54:55.360\nI'm not looking at you guys. Stop engaging me. I'm just going to barrel through this. So the whore\n\n54:55.360 --> 55:04.240\nmaster, whatever you call them. All right, so it's already fallen apart. Whatever you call them,\n\n55:04.240 --> 55:14.160\nthe madam, the ma'am, the clerk, the whore clerk says, look, we're all out of whores right\n\n55:14.160 --> 55:19.680\nnow. Like they're all busy. Fresh out of whores. So we are. They're busy. They're busy whoring,\n\n55:19.680 --> 55:30.160\nlike I would say. No, no, no, no, I'm sorry. Okay, so she goes to the whores are busy and\n\n55:31.440 --> 55:37.760\nalso like the ones that we have, they're too expensive and for you, just judging from your\n\n55:37.760 --> 55:46.400\nclothing and the guy, the guy goes, all I have is a forget all that that happened. Just understand\n\n55:46.400 --> 55:50.800\nthat a guy walked into a whorehouse and then the whore person said, like, what do you want? And\n\n55:50.800 --> 55:56.640\nthen this guy said, I have a I have a dollar. Okay, that's what he had. This is a time when a dollar\n\n55:59.600 --> 56:05.440\nhe had. This is a different time. This is a different time in America.\n\n56:05.440 --> 56:10.400\nYeah. You know, like, there was a reasonable expectation for a dollar at a whorehouse. So\n\n56:10.400 --> 56:18.080\nhe goes, I have a dollar. I have a dollar. And the whore master says, well, I, you know, we\n\n56:18.080 --> 56:21.760\ndon't have any whores for a dollar here. Times are changing. There's telegraphs going up. You\n\n56:21.760 --> 56:27.680\nknow, this is, you know, this is I don't know what you came in here expecting, but this would be\n\n56:27.680 --> 56:33.360\nlike the mid 1800s. I'll tell you, you certainly can't have a human whore for for a dollar. What\n\n56:33.360 --> 56:38.880\nyou can have is this duck and he pulls a duck out like, uh, from underneath the counter, the whore\n\n56:38.880 --> 56:45.040\ncounter and says, you can have a duck for a dollar. You can have this duck. And the guy's like, I\n\n56:45.040 --> 56:50.960\ncame all the way into town. I certainly not going to go back. I got all psyched up for, I've been\n\n56:50.960 --> 56:57.040\ntalking to this guy for 45 minutes. So he, so he gives a guy the dollar. He takes the duck upstairs.\n\n56:57.040 --> 57:05.920\nHe goes upstairs. He actually has a great time, uh, with the duck. Uh, I, I, you know, they,\n\n57:05.920 --> 57:12.480\nthey have, uh, they have vaginas. Um, I don't know why he has a great time. It doesn't matter.\n\n57:12.480 --> 57:17.920\nWhat Aaron, what, why is it like, what's the, I think, Dan, Dan, you're doing great, honey.\n\n57:17.920 --> 57:27.120\nI'm not doing it on purpose. I'm telling you, the joke is, I know that the beauty is, he's\n\n57:27.120 --> 57:30.640\nsaying he has a, he has a good time with it. I'm going to speed through the rest of it. It's\n\n57:30.640 --> 57:35.360\namazing. You're not, you're not fucking around right now. This is how he tells jokes for real.\n\n57:35.360 --> 57:38.960\nHe has a great time with the duck. He comes down and he gives the duck back and he says,\n\n57:38.960 --> 57:43.760\nlike, the joke is, uh, it's, uh, halfway over. I had a guy, I had a great time with this duck.\n\n57:43.760 --> 57:49.600\nThank you. And he just leaves. It doesn't matter. And so, so he comes back the next day and he says,\n\n57:49.600 --> 57:58.560\nuh, uh, uh, uh, listen, uh, uh, I, I, I, can I, can I, uh, I, I, I, uh, I brought another dollar.\n\n57:58.560 --> 58:04.240\nCan I have a, can I have, can I have the, can I have, can I have the duck again?\n\n58:04.240 --> 58:12.880\nAnd, uh, and they, and they, and the, the whore, whore tender puts the duck on the counter and\n\n58:12.880 --> 58:19.120\nsays, and says, here's the, here's the duck. Does the whore tender work beneath or above the whore\n\n58:19.120 --> 58:24.560\nmaster? It goes whore master, whore tender. Well, he was, he was, he was doing whore back.\n\n58:25.840 --> 58:28.880\nIt's like, you can't order from the whore tender. He's whore backing.\n\n58:28.880 --> 58:32.720\nAll right. He was in the weed. He's cleaning, cleaning ducks out.\n\n58:34.880 --> 58:38.000\nHe said, he puts a duck in the, I already fucked it up. I know this.\n\n58:41.920 --> 58:45.120\nIt's like the black stallion. Like, oh, those are like Aaron calling out, you're perfect. I'm\n\n58:45.120 --> 58:50.240\ngoing to tell the joke. Right. He puts a duck on the counter and the, and, and, uh, god damn it.\n\n58:50.240 --> 58:57.040\nI fucked it up. Okay. So, okay. Don't say, right. Can you just rewind one day, just rewind one day\n\n58:57.040 --> 59:01.920\nin the story. The guy, so what already happened is the, is the first transaction where the guy got\n\n59:01.920 --> 59:06.560\nthe duck and he had the time of his life. Okay. I'm sorry about this. So the guy comes back in\n\n59:07.120 --> 59:12.160\nand he, and he comes in and he goes, I'll take, I'll take the duck. Okay. And the guy puts the duck\n\n59:12.160 --> 59:16.400\non the counter and he takes the duck. He goes upstairs again, has the time of his life, comes\n\n59:16.400 --> 59:23.200\nback down, puts the duck on the counter. The whore master says, uh, that'll be $5. And the guy says,\n\n59:23.200 --> 59:28.720\nyesterday it was a dollar. And the whore master says, that duck had AIDS,\n\n59:32.640 --> 59:33.840\nwhich doesn't see, it doesn't.\n\n59:38.400 --> 59:40.720\nIt doesn't seem like a funny joke to me either, but\n\n59:42.800 --> 59:48.000\nwhen I heard it told everyone laughed and I've been trying to tell it. You know why? Because\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:54.720\ntheir joke came in under 10 fucking minutes. Let me try one more. I swear to God, I can tell\n\n59:54.720 --> 59:58.160\nthis one right. Just one more, one more, one more, one more. I swear to God, there's what I will\n\n59:58.160 --> 01:00:03.600\nnot. By the way, we serve breakfast everybody. It's like, like, like three minutes. I'll be\n\n01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:08.400\nthrough this one, like not even, not even. I swear to God. Okay. 75 year old man's walking down a\n\n01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:14.800\nsidewalk. He walks past a frog. The frog looks up at him and says, Hey, I'm a magical frog. If you\n\n01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:19.440\nkiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful princess and I'll have sex with you for the rest of my, your\n\n01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:30.000\nlife and mine probably. Stay on target. Stay on target. And the old man says, what did you say\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:37.360\nbecause of the rule of threes? You fucked it. You fucked it. Yeah, they're savvy. They know.\n\n01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:41.520\nThis has to repeat it. Like, like, like, like, he says, like, what did you say? And the frog says,\n\n01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:45.360\nI said, I'm a magical frog. If you pick me up and kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful princess\n\n01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:50.320\nand I'll have sex with you for the rest of your life. The old man picks up the frog, puts it\n\n01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:55.120\nin his pocket, starts walking down the sidewalk, walks for a block, the frog calls out from his\n\n01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:59.200\npocket. Hey, what are you doing? I said, I'm a magic frog. And if you pick me up and kiss me,\n\n01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:02.560\nI'll turn into a beautiful princess and have sex with you for the rest of your life. The old man\n\n01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:18.000\nlooks down at his pocket and says, I'm 75 years old. I think it's cooler to have a talking frog.\n\n01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:26.880\nThe joke master. Next up, a burn notice. What's that, Jeffrey Rosho? The burn man. The burn.\n\n01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:34.640\nThe burn. Man, that guy's looking weird. Is it like, does he know?\n\n01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:40.480\nAre you about to roast Jeffrey Ross right now? Can you? Can you roast a roaster?\n\n01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:45.040\nHe's starting to look weird, isn't he? He's starting to look like the Vasquez Rock.\n\n01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:50.320\nLike, hey, it's becoming like a labyrinth character for sure. Speaking of labyrinths.\n\n01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:58.080\nWe can't, right? No, no. The women will revolt. You can hear them pop. They're like, no,\n\n01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:02.080\nget, fuck you with your mirrors in your hallways. Don't go back into that dungeon.\n\n01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:07.040\nWell, I feel like we have a huge room here. And it's, I'm putting myself in their shoes,\n\n01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:11.840\nwatching the two of us drink and flounder around in a hallway. There's probably people\n\n01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:16.480\nthat go like, oh, look up. There's buttons all over this place. So you want to have like,\n\n01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:20.560\nyou want to bring somebody up who's like a little more, like maybe they could help us be like a\n\n01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:28.000\nspirit guy? Do we have anybody? Oh, oh, oh, shit. We got, oh, God. Oh, no. Adam. All right, that's\n\n01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.920\nshit. Get up here. Who else raised their hand over there? Okay. The two of you over there.\n\n01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:36.000\nGuys, let's bring these three up for better or for worse. What are we doing?\n\n01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:44.320\nStand over in the corner like a Greek chorus. Jeff just uncorked this bottle with\n\n01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:53.840\nfor those of you listening in podcast world, the world's best boy band just walked on stage\n\n01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:59.680\nright now. We have Adam, Adam on the left in the middle. What's your name, sir?\n\n01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:06.400\nYeah, in the middle. Doug and Adam, Doug and Colin, everybody.\n\n01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:17.280\nYeah, collectively known as Dream Weaver. Spencer, where were we?\n\n01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:25.600\nWhen we last left our heroes, they had just broken down. Sorry, sorry, Spencer.\n\n01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.520\nDan just paused a moment to Instagram. What's going on right now? This is taking a picture of\n\n01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:34.880\nDream Weaver. Dream Weaver. All right, Spencer, I'm sorry. So you want me, we keep going? Yeah.\n\n01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:38.720\nYeah, we're trucking to that doorway, right? Yeah, you just melted the door. Do you want\n\n01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:46.560\nto look at it? Hell yeah. All right, you look through the door. It's a large room that extends\n\n01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:51.040\nto the north and to the south. In front of you, the white beam continues on. It hits a large\n\n01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:56.720\ncrystal red eye, but the eye doesn't seem to be reacting to the white beam. In the room are\n\n01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:03.520\nthree large pillars, each containing glass objects. In the center is a large prism,\n\n01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:09.200\nand flanked on its sides are two large crystal globes. All right, well, this is like a, you know,\n\n01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:18.480\nobviously like a fruity puzzle. I love riddles. Yeah, so we're going to want that prism, right?\n\n01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:22.800\nWell, it's based, yeah. You know what, Dan? Rotate the prism. You and I consider all day.\n\n01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:30.000\nWhy don't we consult Dream Weaver? Dream Weaver, you got any ideas? Doug. First idea is light\n\n01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.240\nrefraction throughout the room. The crystal eye is the color red. The beam is white. You probably\n\n01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:38.880\nhave to turn the beam red through the crystals to hit the eye to get to the next room.\n\n01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:57.680\nDoug. Didoy. One step ahead of you, Doug. All right. Does this prism rotate? Is it movable?\n\n01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:03.680\nYou approach the pillar. It looks like it could be slid. Hey, I got a sword. I'm going to,\n\n01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:08.960\nuh, well, don't take it easy with the sword. I want to slip. I want to slip that shit. No,\n\n01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:15.600\nnot slit, slid. Slid. Oh, shit. Yeah. Sorry. Chop it with a sword. I'm going to chop. I'll\n\n01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:20.800\nchop you with a sword. You fucking piece of shit. So if you move, if you move the prism,\n\n01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:24.560\nlike it was it, can you move it into the, I could murder a cigarette right now. I'll tell you.\n\n01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:31.280\nYou move it into the white beam and it turns. Do you want to try to do that? Yes. All right,\n\n01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:37.440\nyou move the, you move the pillar containing the prism. It slides into place as the white\n\n01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:43.840\nbeam hits it. The white beam splits into three beams, red, green and blue. The red beam continues\n\n01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:49.600\non and hits the crystal eye. It glows and you hear a far off rumble. Nice. Way to go, Doug. Nice.\n\n01:05:49.600 --> 01:06:02.000\nDream weaver. I believe they can get us through the door. Fucking dream weaver. You guys are\n\n01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:09.120\ncoming back next week. So we, we, uh, so we opened another door. There's no door in this room.\n\n01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:14.960\nThe green and blue beams go north and south. They look like they're hitting the far walls,\n\n01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:19.600\nbut they're kind of near those pillars I mentioned earlier. Oh, okay. So we move the pillars into\n\n01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:24.240\nthe paths of their corresponding beams, right? All right. Well, do you try to do that? Yes.\n\n01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:28.080\nYeah. Well, how do you do that? Do you do it like one at a time? What's up together? We,\n\n01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:33.200\nwe, we work in 10 and we take the green one. I'll take the blue one and I'll be in Scotland before\n\n01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:40.480\nyou. All right. You synchronize your watches. You push. We have watches. No. Okay. That's lying.\n\n01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:46.800\nAll right. You push the, the pillars into the beams. You hear a, you hear a loud humming sound\n\n01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:52.640\nand you feel a tingling sensation across your body, a pulling on your skin and then a tug behind\n\n01:06:52.640 --> 01:07:02.000\nyour knave. and you feel yourself being teleported. Whoa. We're being teleported. I like it. We choose\n\n01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:12.560\nto like it. You enjoy the teleportation. All right. They, they, they put the audience\n\n01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:16.720\napplause. We're on a journey, man. We're all people love teleportation. We're all in this together.\n\n01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:25.600\nAll right. So you appear. I'll explain this to you guys. All right. There's a large open room\n\n01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:31.360\nbefore you. You think it must be a few hundred feet and it seems to be rectangular. You can see\n\n01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:36.720\nacross, there's a large pit splitting the room in two. It looks to be bottomless. You can see on\n\n01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:44.400\nthe other side of the pit, your friend Sharpie and your friend Quark across the pit on the other side.\n\n01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:49.040\nWe're separated by this fissure in the middle of the room. Yes. This fissure is very wide. You\n\n01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:52.880\ndon't think you could jump it. It's, it's wider than the legend. So we've been separated. You've\n\n01:07:52.880 --> 01:08:03.360\nbeen separated. I miss you. You reach out across the void and somehow you know he can tell\n\n01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:09.120\nthat you're there for him. So do we need to get back together? I don't know. Do you look around?\n\n01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:18.720\nLook, I'm always looking around Spencer. I look around across the chasm. You can see that red eye.\n\n01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:24.480\nWait, chasm? Chasm. Fissure, bottomless pit. Chasm. Chasm. I say words.\n\n01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:30.000\nOkay. Don't try, don't try to separate them. I'm sorry. I look across chasm. Sabotage.\n\n01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.880\nI look across the chasm and I see what? You see the beam arcing across the room. It seems to be\n\n01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:42.400\ngoing down the path, but your path is blocked by a large crystal slab. You notice that your,\n\n01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:48.080\nthe orbs that you are near are glowing and emitting blue and green light in a ray.\n\n01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:54.400\nIt's hitting a statue. I turned my statue to reflect or catch, receive a beam. As you have\n\n01:08:54.400 --> 01:09:01.360\nsaid it, it happens. You melt the blue crystal to nothing. Sweet. Wait, that's bad. No. You can see\n\n01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:07.040\npast the crystal. Behind it is another crystal slab. It's the same color and another statue.\n\n01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:11.840\nDo we have to keep turning the statues? Maybe. I'm going to turn one more statue.\n\n01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:17.200\nAll right. You turn the statue. It reflects the beam into the slab, but behind the slab,\n\n01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:20.800\nafter it disappears, is a statue of the color across the room.\n\n01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:27.920\nIt's just, it's hard to, uh, I'm so drunk. You know, I really turn, turn the statue. I turn\n\n01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:33.840\nthe statue again. All right. You turn the statue in much the same way. And it's your path is now\n\n01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:40.560\nblocked by a crystal of the color of your partner across the room. Shit. Adam. Just keep turning\n\n01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:49.200\nstatues. So first time Adam and I have been on the same page. So now we, now we, let's set up\n\n01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:53.920\ncamp and just get to know each other. Can we set up camp and just have a little powwow? Yeah,\n\n01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:57.040\nyou can have a powwow. We're not together. Yeah. Well, I mean, you wouldn't be talking to each other.\n\n01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:00.400\nThere's a Fisher across the room. You can send Hawk messages. Yeah, we can, we can, we can,\n\n01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:03.760\nwe can see each other and send me a Hawk message. Let's just build a little fire. Let's just,\n\n01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:11.600\nlet's just talk about our backstory. All right. Um, my father hit me for real. That's why I wanted\n\n01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:20.640\nto learn magic. Uh, where did you study magic? Uh, at the Arcanium. That's very prestigious. Uh,\n\n01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:26.640\ndo you have a scholarship or did you? Oh, it's a, I, I, I born rich. No, God, no, you're one of those\n\n01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:31.920\nrich wizards. No, you didn't fucking earn it. Heavens. No, no, you didn't earn it. Yeah. Yeah.\n\n01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:36.480\nAnybody could go have a, uh, get a scholarship to a wizard school. Watch your characteristic\n\n01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:42.960\ntemper, quirk. Oh boy. Fucking. I am, I am, I am. I'll stab a wizard in a second. I am the\n\n01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:48.480\ndefinition of a bootstrapper. I, I, I, I, I looked into the Arcanium arts because, uh, I wanted\n\n01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:54.560\nto prove my father wrong about me. My father actually, and point of fact was a barbarian like you.\n\n01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:00.080\nAdam, get on mic. If you're gonna, if you're gonna start being a PT Barnum here,\n\n01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:08.240\nguys, flashback to the Arcanarium where, uh, Sharpie was teased mercilessly by rich, spoiled\n\n01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:16.480\nwizards played by their, you played by Dreamweaver. All right, go for it guys. It's the, uh, the\n\n01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:20.800\nmagical dining hall. I'm so sorry, Spencer. I'm going to apologize to you after this. I'm so sorry.\n\n01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:25.360\nNo, this is great. The spoiled dining hall where he sits at the poor kid's table with a scholarship\n\n01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:33.440\nhere. Scholarship inariums. You guys mind if I sit here? Uh, no. Yeah. What are you? I'd be mine.\n\n01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:40.480\nSharpie Bottom. New kid's school. It's Buttsalot. Yeah. Oh, all right. Yeah. I see you with your,\n\n01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:48.320\nwith your, your poor man spell. What was that? Tail of Newt? You know, one of these days, I'm\n\n01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:52.080\ngoing to be an adventurer. You guys aren't going to be shit. I'm going to learn spells and I'm\n\n01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:56.480\ngoing to detect magic. Sure you are. Yeah. Yeah. You know where all the real adventures go? The\n\n01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:03.120\nhowling mines. Sharpie. You have any idea where that is? Sharpie. Well, I'm waking up. I'm waking\n\n01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:09.280\nup next to the cat, the fisher and the, uh, the mines that we're in, right? Oh, sorry. No. You're\n\n01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:14.560\nhaving a weird dream. Yeah. Sorry. Hey, hey, quark over there. Did you pick up on me having a weird\n\n01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:19.840\ndream? Yeah. Yeah. You seem like you're talking in your sleep. My childhood was fucked up, man.\n\n01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:26.640\nI got a lot to prove. Sometimes I wish I could, I could, I could launch into a rage like you and\n\n01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:32.720\njust like, like make everything okay. I wish there was a way to, uh, get out of this, uh,\n\n01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.880\nthis room. All right. One, one more description of these beams of light and their configuration.\n\n01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:42.960\nThis is open to the whole bloody fucking nerd mode right now. Anybody has an idea right now?\n\n01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:54.480\nWe're aim the what? Cross the beams. Wait, I thought you said that would be bad.\n\n01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:01.680\nCross the beams. Is there a way Spencer to cross these beams? If you shoot the beams across the\n\n01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:06.080\nchasms at the other guy's wall, maybe something. I'm going to, I'm going to chasm beams. I'm going\n\n01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:11.440\nto beam my chasms. We shoot the beams across the chasm at the other guy's wall. You melt the walls.\n\n01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:13.440\nFuck yeah!\n\n01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:24.000\nAnd scene. Let's get a little, let's get a little taste. Let's find out what the next\n\n01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.600\nthreshold is. Then we, we'll stop at this. Let's take a peek through. Melted the walls.\n\n01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:33.520\nMy guess, more light beams. More light beams? Maybe. More, more square mirrors or possibly\n\n01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:38.640\nround mirrors. Where's the door in relation to the two guys in the, cause we're still separated\n\n01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:45.520\nfrom a. Yeah. You don't see a door yet. However, as the, the walls dissipate, you can see. Remember\n\n01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:55.200\nthat red beam from earlier? How could I forget? Well, he's back. At this time, he means business.\n\n01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:05.680\nYou can see that the red beam is hitting a crystal that seems to be blocking it from accessing a\n\n01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:11.200\nlarge crystal spear that's hanging in the air. Right. All right. The red beam is being blocked\n\n01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:15.680\nby a blue crystal, a green crystal, and behind that a red crystal. All right. There's your\n\n01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:22.560\nsneak preview of what lies in store. So we should stop it right there, you say, right?\n\n01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:27.120\nProbably. Yeah. It feels like the Glendale Galleria at Christmas time. It's just. There's your\n\n01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:35.040\ncliffhanger for next week. Yeah. Yeah. What, what, will the blue ray? Well, will more beams be\n\n01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:40.800\nturned toward other beams? What will, what will reflect the beam? Will more telas be ported?\n\n01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.000\nAll right. Well, yeah, let's hear it for Dreamweaver, everybody. First, Dreamweaver,\n\n01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:55.360\nour geek chorus, our geek chorus. Yeah. Geek chorus. Yeah. I have a Greek chorus or a geek\n\n01:14:55.360 --> 01:15:04.640\nchorus. Fantastic. And Spencer, our dungeon master. All right. So it's 955. We started at\n\n01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:09.280\neight, eight, 20-ish. We should, we should, we should wrap it up. How do we wrap it up? Usually,\n\n01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:13.360\nwe've gotten lazy. We've usually wrapped it up with a kind of rapid fire around,\n\n01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:19.200\nplayed a hacky comedy, sporty, I'll answer questions in three words thing. We don't have that\n\n01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:24.080\nlifesaver anymore. How do, how do we wrap up tonight? Do you want to do it in song?\n\n01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:30.480\nI mean, I don't know. Something. How about, I don't encourage it.\n\n01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:36.960\nHow about, Dan, I just want you to follow your heart here. I want you to, first of all,\n\n01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:41.200\nbefore I do this, I want you to think about what happened tonight. Yeah. I want you to think,\n\n01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.640\nrefresh our memory here. There was no theme tonight. We didn't fall back on that. We just\n\n01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:51.440\ntalked to people. Yeah. We just, we just let it happen. We just reached out. I hope we touched\n\n01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:56.880\nyou. You know, we talked about talking to you. We brought up, we brought up Spencer. We, we,\n\n01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:03.600\nwe embarked on a, on a terrifying mission. We, we came together in our two new avatars cells.\n\n01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:07.600\nWe have a new segment to our show. We found out that you're terrible at telling jokes.\n\n01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:13.520\nAnd yet, and yet when you tell a joke wrong, it becomes more delightful than a joke being told\n\n01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:23.200\nproperly. Right. I just say, whatever you're doing, I'm going to fail that. So then we're going to\n\n01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:28.240\nbe stuck here for a little longer. There's no question about that. I just say, I just say,\n\n01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:33.680\nmaybe just think about what happened tonight. Express, express how you're feeling now in song.\n\n01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:33.920\nOkay.\n\n01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:48.400\nWell, I had a good show, or maybe it was bad. It may not be the best show that a Harmontown\n\n01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:55.200\nfans ever had, because if you've been to six of them, you've been to four better ones.\n\n01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:04.560\nWell, that's just tough cosmic titties for $10 worth of fun.\n\n01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:09.280\nThank you for coming, everybody. Thank you for coming.\n\n01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:15.280\nYou got your $10 worth, I hope. If not, see us after the show, I think.\n\n01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:21.920\nThank you, Spencer. Thank you. Thank you, Geek Chorus. Thank you, Jeff Davis for\n\n01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:25.040\nComptrolling. Jeff's got some people to thank. Yeah, let's thank Katie Levine,\n\n01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:29.840\nour audio recording, Zac McKeever, our tech guy on site, Emily Gordon, our producer,\n\n01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:34.080\nDaniel Kramer, program director, Dustin Marshall, our podcast producer,\n\n01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:40.320\nMo Fathelbab, the onsite director, and Jenny Fine, our fantastic artist. Once again, I'm Jeff Davis\n\n01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:44.640\nfrom Comptrolling. Thank you, NerdMelt. Thank you, people listening on site. Thank you all for\n\n01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:51.760\ncoming down here. Spencer, Geek Chorus, one more time for your mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:56.960\nThank you. You guys are great. You're very, very wonderful and enthusiastic and patient.\n\n01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:16.960\nThe campaign continues next week. Imagine how many pillars will be turned. Thank you.\n\n","cpu_time":["0.002s"],"str_size":[90476]}
