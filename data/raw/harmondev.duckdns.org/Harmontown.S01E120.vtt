Get out! Get out!\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:29.000\nThere's Canadians infesting the film stuff.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:30.000\nThey keep picking up the litter.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:32.000\nPut down that Tim Horton's cup.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:34.000\nWe put it there on purpose.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:37.000\nYeah, so they would actually do that.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:38.000\nCanadians.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:43.000\nYou know, I had the quintessential Canadian experience on the way here.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:46.000\nAnd there's a lot of cliches that are true.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:49.000\nAnd you guys are friendlier and a little bit nicer.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:50.000\nAnd just deal with it.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:51.000\nI mean, you're snarky too.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:53.000\nI know what you say behind our backs.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:55.000\nNo, they will argue with you about anything.\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:56.000\nYeah, they don't tip.\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:58.000\nThey go, we're not nice.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:01.000\nYou don't hate me, do you?\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:06.000\nSo I see this guy on a moped when I was walking here to the theatre.\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:08.000\nAnd he gets cut off and almost creamed.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:09.000\nHe's almost hit by this Prius.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:12.000\nAnd so he catches up with the Prius and he hits the window.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:14.000\nAnd I'm like, oh, this is good.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:15.000\nThis is going to go.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:16.000\nIt's on.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:17.000\nAnd the guy looks at the other guy.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:19.000\nAnd the guy on the moped looks at him.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:25.000\nAnd then he really angrily waves at him.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:26.000\nHello.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:27.000\nHi.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:30.000\nLike, have you noticed me?\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:33.000\nWhat was the effort there to give the finger?\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:35.000\nIt would have just been bending three fingers.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:37.000\nAnd he's just...\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:40.000\nThat would hurt me more, though, wouldn't you, as a driver?\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:42.000\nI'd be like, God, that guy...\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:43.000\nAbsolutely.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:46.000\nIn rare moments in my life, I've experienced...\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:50.000\nI've done it right just on accident, really, because I was trying to be so sarcastic.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:52.000\nAnd the other person was so nice.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:57.000\nI remember having instances in traffic where someone's honking at me angrily.\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:58.000\nIt makes me...\n\n04:58.000 --> 04:59.000\nIt puts my ire up.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:03.000\nAnd then I would look over at them, make eye contact with them,\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:06.000\nand do this big show of like...\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:11.000\nLike, fully expecting you to get shot for it.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:14.000\nBut then the person in the other car would just start laughing.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:16.000\nThat guy doesn't mug me aggressively.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:19.000\nYeah, maybe we should all be doing comedy in this moment.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:20.000\nWhat is my problem?\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:24.000\nI got re-rendered on the 101 during, like, where traffic was at all stop.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:29.000\nAnd this guy gets out, and here's a Mexican gentleman, and it was his truck.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:32.000\nAnd we go to exchange each other's insurance.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:37.000\nAnd then he hands me his license, and it says it was suspended, that his license was suspended.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:40.000\nAnd then I go, dude, just forget it, my car's fine.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:43.000\nAnd he starts crying, and he hugs me.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:46.000\nAnd unlike you, I'm not cool with the hugs.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:47.000\nUnlike me.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:49.000\nWell, all these big...\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:50.000\nI don't know, man.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:51.000\nWhat is your target audience?\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:53.000\nWe love bears.\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:58.000\nIt's 600 hours of footage of that movie.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:00.000\nLike, I hugged eight people.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:02.000\nYeah, we should say there was a screening this evening.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:03.000\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:05.000\nAnd by the way, I love the movie. It was really wonderful.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:07.000\nOh, yeah, I'm glad you liked it. It's very flattering.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:15.000\nIt was very sweet and funny, and everything I want in a movie.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:18.000\nAh, that's nice. I know you would tell me otherwise, I think.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:19.000\nI mean, not that you're...\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nI would just say, hey, that was good.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:24.000\nYeah, you would be polite, but I would know that you didn't like it.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:27.000\nAnd I could tell you saw some merit in it.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:34.000\nOf course, I sat next to you and I was laughing, and I was worried that my laugh sounded like Max Cady in the Cape Fear remake, you know.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:41.000\nI fell asleep because I'm 41, and not because the movie's boring, but because I just...\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:44.000\nI don't know, I had some of these Mill Street loggers.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:46.000\nDo you want me to tell you how it ends?\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:51.000\nNo, no, I know it is. That's the fact that guy sucks his thumb and says he's not going to change.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:59.000\nBut yeah, I woke up to people laughing, and I thought they were laughing at me snoring, and I was like, hey, make a movie about that.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:02.000\nBut yeah, what is that Canadian...\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:08.000\nI think in America, are we socialized to compartmentalize to the point where we become psychotic?\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:15.000\nAre we trained? Do people in Canada, because as a region...\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:22.000\nI don't even know... Do you guys... Does Canada really consider itself to be a country?\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:29.000\nOr do you guys really think about it in terms of like, nah, this is, you know, this is my province.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:32.000\nThis is my, you know, because it's different from wherever you go.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:36.000\nJust say America in front of a Canadian, they'll correct you.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:38.000\nThis is North America.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nWe're all American.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:48.000\nThere's a whole chunk of everything. Really? Because on the news, when they say America bombed someone today, you don't go, us or them, I'm not sure.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:53.000\nBut no, I just want to make sure I wasn't asking in a demeaning way, because I think that would be one part of the enlightened thing.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:57.000\nIt's like, why be jingoistic about a big giant swath of land?\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:01.000\nWell, but they do. It feels like Canadian is a little more civic in their mindset.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:04.000\nSure, sure.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:11.000\nNo, I mean, perhaps they're a little kinder to their brothers, but they've also got the most fucked up political system going.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:14.000\nNo, but I mean, I mean, the top four to come on.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:19.000\nThey're focused on, they're focused on shit that matters.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:27.000\nMaybe that's the only other shit that gets back to us, but it's not like, there is no such thing as like a, you know, Canada really stirred things up at the UN today.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:36.000\nYou know, it's like, you know, America continues to rattle its saber on this like global scale.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:43.000\nSo that's the only reason why you would have a reason to think of yourself as an American as opposed to perhaps a person from Portland or Milwaukee or Los Angeles,\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:49.000\nwhich is what really matters. The key difference is what kind of, what way is the traffic going?\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:54.000\nDoes your city have a rail system? Does your city, how does it spend its money?\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:57.000\nYou know, it's like, it comes down to a civic level.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:07.000\nBut I was thinking about this, because both of us grew up not far from Canada and the same kind of weather and the same kind of, you know...\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:09.000\nFocus on humility.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:13.000\nShame and oppressive religion.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:22.000\nBut I don't know why, because I grew up in Syracuse, nice to come up to Toronto. It was like going to Paris, you know, I mean, it was like...\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:26.000\nYeah, the east side of Milwaukee. It was like, wow, they really...\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:29.000\nThese people are very bougie.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:37.000\nI used to come up here to Hitchhike with Tom Kenny up here to see Second City and stuff when we were teenagers.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:44.000\nYeah, when you get into the airport, you feel a very, I don't know, it has a weird futuristic, like a 90s future feel.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:49.000\nI was like suddenly finding myself, I don't think I was that drunk, but I was like...\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:52.000\nI wanted to go pitch William Gibson-like stuff.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:56.000\nI was like, Toronto, 2028.\n\n09:56.000 --> 10:03.000\nIt's just, you know, in the 90s you're going, wow, they're still hanging out at this grunge and you're going, oh no, it's cold. That's why they're flying.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:09.000\nIt's cold, yeah. I think that's what it is. It's coldness and sophistication makes you...\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:12.000\nBecause I started craving Manhattan's. I was drinking a lot of bourbon today.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:15.000\nI was like, why am I not... Why? Why am I doing that?\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:16.000\nOh, because I'm not in a desert.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:19.000\nBut it does have politics and its own craziness and stuff.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:27.000\nIt's just that part of growing up in the US, we're not aware of other countries, even the two closest to us, you know what I mean?\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nIt's our arrogance.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nIt just seems like too much to take on.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:35.000\nWell, have you been spending much time in Quebec?\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nHave you?\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nNo, are there other troubles there?\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:44.000\nWell, when you use English, they're going, do I hate you because you're American or from Ontario?\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:48.000\nLike, they have to figure out why they hate you before they give you a rotten attitude.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:50.000\nYeah, they have their own thing up here.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:54.000\nSpeaking of weird things, this is something that...\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:57.000\nThere's something called Nuit Blanche happening right now.\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:59.000\nYeah.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:03.000\nWhich people are tweeting me about and I immediately assumed it was racist.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:08.000\nI assumed that it was Pagan and probably racist.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:11.000\nBut I think it's just sort of a silver-lakey kind of artist thing.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:17.000\nIt's an all-night, seven-to-seven art festival and they do installations all around the city.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:19.000\nAll right, high-roaded.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:29.000\nBut at the same time, I heard some of the installations from last year and I was like, oh, that sounds great.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:36.000\nEverybody got together and they made a waterfall and a building.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:39.000\nAll right.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:42.000\nWhat was that?\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:45.000\nIt was cool. That's what it was.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:49.000\nWhat's the literal translation of Nuit Blanche?\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:50.000\nWhite night?\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:52.000\nOkay, see, that's why I thought...\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:55.000\nIn America, that sounds like crystal knots.\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:59.000\nIt sounds like time for some justice.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:04.000\nWe got 24 hours to purge.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:07.000\nNuit Blanche, motherfucker.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:12.000\nDon't forget your real uppity right now, Mr. Keb Driver.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:15.000\nBut tomorrow's Nuit Blanche.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:18.000\nCome say, come say, mother of under.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:23.000\nWe stay away from white night in the south.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:29.000\nWe went to Scotland and you were in Scotland at the same time as me and we didn't look each other up.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:32.000\nThe hot-mini thing with the torches.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:35.000\nWe were like, it was fucking great. We were all walking around the torches.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:37.000\nWe can't do that here. We can't do it in America.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:40.000\nWe turned fire racist.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:41.000\nThat's hard work.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:45.000\nAmerica works hard at racism. You're welcome.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:51.000\nWe fucking figured out how to make racism fucking fundamental.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:54.000\nWell, you couldn't do it in the States because everybody would be suing each other.\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:56.000\nYeah, that's the other thing.\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:59.000\nThe post-racial America is now a...\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:05.000\nI was watching in Hogmanay, it's 5,000 people with torches walking through Edinburgh and I'm like,\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:11.000\nwhat do they do when they accidentally set each other on fire and someone goes, put them out.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:14.000\nAnd I witnessed it. I saw some people.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:19.000\nThere's like little kids and they started to go up in flames and then the parent would pack them out.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:21.000\nJust like cavemen.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:23.000\nLet's give a baby a torch.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:27.000\nThere's seven billion pieces of evidence that that's a fine system.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:30.000\nWe didn't go extinct from burning to death.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:34.000\nWell, and there's a lot of drinking too.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:37.000\nEveryone's drunk and there's wicker everywhere.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:41.000\nYou don't know if the superintendent's inside the wicker thing.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:45.000\nYou figure he'll scream if he starts to burn.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nThat's kind of where I was hoping it was going.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:48.000\nI thought it was going to be wicker, man.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:50.000\nIt was. It very much was.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:52.000\nThat's what I was hoping to eat Blanche would be.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:56.000\nYou and I would end up in a tea kettle made out of sticks.\n\n13:56.000 --> 14:00.000\nThe bees, the God damn bees.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:02.000\nSo have you been brought to us?\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:07.000\nSo will you be brought a room to the boot?\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:12.000\nI was trying to think of a way to Canadian pronunciation to a pagan ritual.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:16.000\nYou are a boot to go forth into the.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:17.000\nSorry.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:19.000\nAll right. Sorry.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:21.000\nThey say sorry so much.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:22.000\nThey say sorry.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:26.000\nI'm mispronouncing it, but you know, when you watch to grassy, they say sorry.\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:28.000\nEvery other word.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:35.000\nIt's like a nation of Chippendales after you know, after you, after you cousin.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:37.000\nThere's a sleeping giant though.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:39.000\nThey're just getting ready to kick our ass.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nThat'd be fantastic.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:43.000\nCanada is like that.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:44.000\nThat should be.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:50.000\nWe should send Canada to the moon because they would be able to operate there.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:52.000\nThey'd be like, we understand.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nWe're orbiting something disgusting.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:56.000\nLike we get it.\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:57.000\nWe have limited resources.\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:58.000\nWe can make it work.\n\n14:58.000 --> 14:59.000\nOkay.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:01.000\nWe wear a parka or now it's a space helmet.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:03.000\nI'm fine with that.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:05.000\nWe're still a colony.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:07.000\nFine.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:09.000\nWe'll humor you there.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:13.000\nAnd then like 30 years later, they were like psych.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:16.000\nMoon bombs.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:19.000\nCanadian moon bombs.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:22.000\nDo you think they're just happy to be not part of England?\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:24.000\nIs that why they're polite?\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:26.000\nAren't they still kind of though?\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:28.000\nYeah, you are.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:30.000\nThat's where I get cocky.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:36.000\nWhen we have political arguments and like my Canadian friends go like, yeah, but you guys,\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:37.000\nyou got to get your shit together.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:40.000\nI'm like, fuck you fucking England fuckers.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:43.000\nBut you fucking grow some fuckers.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:46.000\nI really thought you weren't part of the, did you guys get a chance to vote?\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:48.000\nAnd you said, no, we're scared.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:54.000\nThey just, you know, that car broke down and they're like, well, let's just live here.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:55.000\nWho cares?\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nI mean, at this point, you can't do it.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nIt's like legalizing heroin.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nLike what are you going to do?\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:05.000\nHow are you going to, what are you going to be an independent Scotland and an independent Canada?\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nI mean, how's that even going to work?\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:08.000\nWho fucking cares?\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.000\nIt's all bureaucracy.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:13.000\nI didn't realize it was going to get so heavy, man.\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:15.000\nI was here to talk about the police academy.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\nYou got to do that shit in the 1700s.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:19.000\nDo it in the 1700s.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:21.000\nYou fucked up.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:24.000\nYou got to cut some heads off.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:25.000\nLook at me.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:27.000\nLook what you could have been.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:30.000\nLook at the pride.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:32.000\nLook at the culture you could have had.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:37.000\nUSA, USA, USA.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:41.000\nI mean, yeah, growing up in Wisconsin is essentially you are Canadian.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:43.000\nThere's no difference.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:47.000\nBut back when I was a kid, you could walk across the border, probably, I think.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:48.000\nI'm assuming.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:49.000\nI'm assuming.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:50.000\nYeah, we could.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:54.000\nAnd where I grew up, not the same accent, but kind of the same.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:56.000\nYou know, where they drop the T's.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:57.000\nThey just drop the N.\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nHey, Bob, you know, I saw you there on HBO.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nLike they don't pronounce the whole.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:02.000\nRight.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:04.000\nYou don't waste a lot of time opening your mouth a lot.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:05.000\nNo.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nLike in Wisconsin, you talk through your nose.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:12.000\nSo in order to make sure that certain salons are different from others, you got to make sure that.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:16.000\nI could say that I was almost a Canadian because in my high school yearbook,\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:20.000\nyou can count how many kids died from snowmobile fatalities.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:26.000\nYou know, they are, you know, a steamwise orc there.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:28.000\nYou know, he didn't even see the Bob wire there.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:29.000\nYou know.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:38.000\nIn a land where snowmobile.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:46.000\nPeople don't even go, Hey, you know, we should make some paths or we should instill some laws.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:50.000\nWhy don't you just put tires on the goddamn things?\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:56.000\nWe're going to lose a couple, you know, I'm getting out my notepad.\n\n17:56.000 --> 18:01.000\nI'm going to look at my look at my ever note notepad to see if there's anything we need to talk about tonight.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:06.000\nThere was a guy in the LA LAX Maple Leaf Lounge.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:10.000\nAs you know, Canada is famous for its luxury.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:15.000\nThey have a, they have a, they put a, they're very elitist country.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:19.000\nThey think that people with more money should be treated much better than people with less money.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:23.000\nSo as you can imagine their, their luxury lounge, that's the thing that pisses me off.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:28.000\nWhen I, I get, I get picked up by a car at the airport and the guy was like not, you know,\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:30.000\nhe was being too practical for me.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:34.000\nAnd I wanted to like, I could recognize that all of my American blood cells are screaming out like,\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:38.000\nwhat are you fucking, don't you understand? I would give you more money.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:39.000\nWhat was he being practical about?\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:45.000\nHe was just like, he's like, he's driving a car that's supposed to pick me up from the airport and drop me off at the hotel.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:47.000\nBut he's making it my problem.\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:53.000\nLike, like he wasn't like thinking in advance like, hmm, who am I picking up?\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:55.000\nWho, who will be paying me?\n\n18:55.000 --> 19:00.000\nI should look into that so that I don't have to do that when I drop him off at the hotel.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:06.000\nSo that he's not sitting there like a jackass, like, like, like having an experience that is essentially more difficult than taking a cab.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nWell, I took a cab.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:11.000\nYeah. I wanted to have taken a cab.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nMy story is about how I recognize it.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:18.000\nLike, like, oh, this is the American in me because there's nothing, there's nothing bad that's happening here.\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:23.000\nThere's a guy that's denying me my right to elitism.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:24.000\nThat's what the big thing is.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:27.000\nDid you want him to have a sign and he didn't?\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:30.000\nI didn't mind the lack of a sign.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:39.000\nBut here's the thing, and these are, these are problems that I know you everyday folks can relate to.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:43.000\nWhen you go to a new city, you're supposed to call the driver.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:47.000\nWell, and now this guy has got my phone number.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:49.000\nWell, I don't even say, here's the thing.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:55.000\nSome guy making minimum wage has now got my phone number.\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:57.000\nI don't think you heard what I said.\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:59.000\nNo, no, no. It's not that.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:03.000\nIt's just that, you know, there was a time you didn't have to give your phone number to the pizza guy, your cell phone.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:08.000\nWell, as you just start now, in Seattle, I had to call, I was like, where's the driver?\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:12.000\nAnd then the, they go, oh, you're supposed to call the guy.\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:15.000\nI'm like, well, that's not, so nobody told me that.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:16.000\nI had to call the guy.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:17.000\nYeah.\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:18.000\nI'd call a cab.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:22.000\nI thought the whole, there was supposed to be a tier here, a tier.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:24.000\nYeah, that would make it easier.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:28.000\nSo then they tell you like, oh yeah, it's one of those airports.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:33.000\nYou can't, the drivers can't come near the, this is not a conversation to have in front of these people.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:36.000\nYeah, they're like, boy, it must be rough.\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:39.000\nI hate it when my limo driver needs my phone number.\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:43.000\nBut just fantasizing your head if you could as a person.\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:50.000\nIt's like, like when you get off that plane that first time you see that guy and it says Harmon on the sign and you're like, I fucking did it.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:52.000\nMr. Drummond adopted me.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.000\nI'm moving on up.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:55.000\nYeah.\n\n20:55.000 --> 21:00.000\nWell, now I'm assuming you travel on the first class.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:01.000\nI can't, yes.\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:02.000\nOkay.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:03.000\nI can't do anything but.\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:04.000\nBut here's the thing.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:07.000\nI started traveling first class when I was a young man.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:09.000\nTrust me, I don't have any money now.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:14.000\nBut when, and I still do because I have five million miles on American airports.\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:16.000\nLiterally you said you have five million miles.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:17.000\nI have a card that says that.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.000\nI've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:28.000\nAnd the thing that's weird is as a younger man, when I got in the line to get on the plane in first class, I was always stopped.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:30.000\nThey would say, this is first class.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:33.000\nAnd I'd be like, I'm first class this bitch.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:37.000\nNo, when I go, I'm first class and I'd mumble and be embarrassed.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:42.000\nBut I don't know what happened recently where I look like I'm first class is just because I'm old now.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:49.000\nOldness is like, you can be a grody schlub and if you're old enough, they're like, maybe he invented mustard.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:50.000\nYeah.\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:53.000\nMaybe it's Stan Lee.\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:54.000\nI don't know.\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:55.000\nLet him on.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:56.000\nHe smells like a fish.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:59.000\nMaybe he caught the first fish.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:05.000\nI was on a flight recently and all these age appropriate women were giving me the big eye.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:07.000\nWhat's the big eye?\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:08.000\nThey were flirting.\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:09.000\nThey were excited.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:10.000\nOkay, little rascal.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:11.000\nI'm fifth.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:12.000\nI'll tell you.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:13.000\nYou got the big eye.\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:17.000\nThey were giving me the big eye and I did not like the cut of their jib.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:19.000\nAnd I'm like, when did this happen?\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:24.000\nBecause as a young man, I didn't have any women like flirting with me, but now I'm 52.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:31.000\nSo like 50 and 60 old women and I'm like, you know, I'm like, I could pull so much steel wool if I wanted to.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:34.000\nAnd it's clear.\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:35.000\nI'm like, what is it?\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:36.000\nIt's like, look at him.\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:40.000\nLook at him with those healthy hips, you know.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:41.000\nLook at it.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:44.000\nI don't even think he...\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:46.000\nDude, can I talk to you about...\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:48.000\nPut a pit in that for a second.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:50.000\nBecause there was a guy in the Maple Leaf lounge.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:51.000\nIt's a luxury.\n\n22:51.000 --> 23:00.000\nIt combines Canada's fine tradition of providing elitist luxury with America's fine tradition of 56K Wi-Fi speeds.\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:01.000\nSo I'm sitting there.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:02.000\nI'm dying.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:04.000\nAnd there's a guy sitting across from me.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:06.000\nHe's got a Bluetooth headset.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:07.000\nAnd he kept...\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:09.000\nI mean, the guy was like doing a character.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:12.000\nI thought he was like gorilla marketing or...\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:16.000\nHe kept making these phone calls and he was speaking so loud.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:20.000\nAnd I'm not one of these people that's like, you know, social...\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:21.000\nI don't know.\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:22.000\nI don't care.\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:23.000\nLike, whatever.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:24.000\nWe live in a new world.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:27.000\nLike, I know there's people who take a lot of pleasure if they're in a restaurant.\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:30.000\nAnd they go like, hey, excuse me, could you take your phone call outside?\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:32.000\nAnd they get all excited about it.\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:34.000\nAnd like, I get it.\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:40.000\nLike, what are we going to fix the world that's populated by fucking idiots?\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:42.000\nSo this guy was like...\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:46.000\nBut I was like, holy shit, this guy is so loud and so crisp.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:49.000\nLike, it sounds like David Mamet wrote him.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:50.000\nYeah.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\nAnd he was just calling.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:53.000\nI knew his name.\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:55.000\nI knew his social security number.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:58.000\nEverything because he was like ordering a watch.\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:01.000\nHe was calling a guy because he had ordered...\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:04.000\nHe was interested in buying a watch.\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:10.000\nAnd he wanted to call and confirm his appointment to come by and look at watches.\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:12.000\nWhat the fuck?\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:15.000\nI hope he called his limo driver.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:18.000\nSo he kept saying stuff.\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:23.000\nAnd he kept talking about like the jelly bean face or the Pomona face.\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:26.000\nIt was like, no, I don't need the jelly bean face.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:28.000\nI want the diamonds and the numbers, but not the face.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:31.000\nBut if he could have a couple of options for me...\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:33.000\nIs he trying to impress?\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:36.000\nDoes he come into the Maple Leaf Lounge?\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:41.000\nAnd he tries to hook up with Canadian divorcees or something?\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:45.000\nIs he running some kind of dirty round scoundrels scam?\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:48.000\nAnd then he got off the phone for a while and I'm like,\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:52.000\nthank God, I'm just focused on my Minecraft.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:55.000\nAnd then five minutes later he called and I wrote it down.\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:57.000\nI wrote down what he said.\n\n24:57.000 --> 25:00.000\nHe said, hi, I have a reservation for a pickup.\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:02.000\nHe had a slight accent of indeterminate origin.\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:04.000\nI'm trying to do my best impression of.\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:07.000\nI have a reservation for a pickup.\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:12.000\nYes. Tango Papa Niner.\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:15.000\nTango Papa Niner?\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:18.000\nI wrote it down. Tango Papa Niner.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:25.000\nBut he had to keep repeating it because I'm sure the person on the other end was like, what?\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:29.000\nTango? Oh, tea? Motherfucker, it's not...\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:30.000\nWe're done.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:32.000\nHe skipped right over Tom.\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:34.000\nTango. Yeah, I get it.\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:39.000\nThe military came up with ways to make sure you only had to give bombing coordinates once\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:44.000\nbecause they were speaking over copper wire in 1941.\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:47.000\nYou don't have to say Tango to a fucking Verizon guy.\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:49.000\nTango.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:51.000\nAlright, Tango begins with a T.\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:54.000\nGot it. So T then you fucking...\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:56.000\nThat would have really frosted my cake.\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:57.000\nPapa?\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:58.000\nPapa.\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:01.000\nI never heard Papa. What's Papa?\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:03.000\nHe clearly watched a lot of Hogan's Heroes.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:05.000\nTango Papa Niner.\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:07.000\nPapa Bear to Mama Bear.\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:08.000\nPapa Bear to Mama Bear.\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:11.000\nSo he wants a Rolex and a pickup. That guy's out there somewhere.\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:13.000\nBut I just listen to those guys.\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:15.000\nI just now, I mean, I don't listen like I'm pretending.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:17.000\nI just turn and go and I chime in.\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:20.000\nI do. It's the quickest way to end it.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:22.000\nI go, yeah, yeah, get the watch.\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:24.000\nYou know what I mean? I do.\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:27.000\nI had a guy in a bathroom stall.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:29.000\nAnd...\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:33.000\nYeah.\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:35.000\nThe story we can all relate.\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:37.000\nI was just banging dudes in the bathroom stall.\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:38.000\nNo.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:40.000\nAnd he gets on the phone in the stall next to me.\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:43.000\nHe goes, hey, what are you doing?\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nWait, I'm sorry.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:47.000\nHe's in the stall next to mine.\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:50.000\nAnd I forget that people are on the phones nonstop.\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:53.000\nAnd I say, he goes, hey, what are you doing?\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:56.000\nAnd I'm like, just crapping, man.\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:58.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:06.000\nAnd then he continues to talk to the other person.\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:08.000\nI was like, oh my God.\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:10.000\nJust crapping, man.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:15.000\nI was on, and then I was, when I was on the plane,\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:17.000\nthere was a young lady walking down the aisle\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:19.000\nand she was on the phone.\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:21.000\nAnd I'm not banging on this young lady.\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:23.000\nI don't think that she's a villain for doing this.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:26.000\nI just think this is kind of fascinating that she's on the phone\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:28.000\nand she's getting on the plane and she's walking down the aisle\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:33.000\nand she goes, yeah, uh-huh, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:35.000\nOkay, well, I'm getting on the plane right now.\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:38.000\nOkay, yeah, I've become one of those people.\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:41.000\nYeah, no, I'm literally one of those people.\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:45.000\nShe had the most meta-obnoxious phone call.\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:47.000\nShe spent more time addressing it.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:49.000\nShe's like, yeah, I'm literally one of those people.\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:53.000\nI know, no, I'm on the plane and I'm talking on the phone.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:56.000\nPeople are looking at me like, what?\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:59.000\nAnd I'm like, no, I'm not allowed to do that.\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:01.000\nYou've taken that away from me.\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:03.000\nThis is worse.\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:04.000\nCut your knees right off.\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:07.000\nIt's like if ants, if somebody put you down,\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:10.000\ncrotch down naked on fire ant hills\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:12.000\nin the middle of the desert,\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:16.000\nand then the ants were like, oh, one of those, huh?\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:18.000\nOh, I know what you're thinking.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:21.000\nWe're gonna, yeah, well, here we are, we're ants.\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:24.000\nI guess we're gonna eat your crotch now.\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:26.000\nI can't believe we're doing this.\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:30.000\nI guess this guy's like, whoa, fire ants on my crotch.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:34.000\nThey think to take away my agency?\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:37.000\nI was walking down a plane,\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:42.000\nand I made a movie called God Bless America,\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:45.000\nand this, I didn't say that for that, but thank you.\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nThat's very sweet.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:51.000\nAnd this kid was watching it on his computer,\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:54.000\nand I'm like, I'm gonna blow his mind.\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:56.000\nAnd I tap him on the show, they go, hi, I'm BobCat,\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:58.000\nBob Goldway, I made that movie,\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:02.000\nand he goes, I paid for it.\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nThat's a 100% true story.\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:09.000\nLike this kid thinks, I'm going, oh, piracy!\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:12.000\nHe's all of his, now I understand,\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:15.000\ncelebrities based on radio shack commercials.\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:17.000\nHe's just like, I gotta go,\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:20.000\nthere's a kid getting on a flight in Burbank,\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:22.000\nand he just downloaded God Bless America,\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:25.000\nthat dirty little prick.\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:26.000\nThat's so funny.\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:28.000\nAnd clearly he didn't, you know what I mean,\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:29.000\nabout how fast it came out.\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:30.000\nI paid for it.\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:31.000\nYeah, he definitely did not pay for it.\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:33.000\nNo, he didn't.\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:35.000\nWhy would you say that if you did?\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:37.000\nIf you have a receipt, you'd be a dick about it.\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:40.000\nHe'd be like, what's up?\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nAsk me.\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nIt's a legal download.\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:48.000\nI woke up, it was on my phone with the YouTube album.\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:52.000\nI love that the corporate, the industry,\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:54.000\ngot their messaging out that much more thoroughly\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:56.000\nthan a filmmaker did.\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:59.000\nYouTube, you probably don't care that much\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:00.000\nif someone steals your work.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:01.000\nNo, not at all.\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:04.000\nI shouldn't say that for the distributors.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:07.000\nYou can't say that, they won't distribute your work.\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:12.000\nBut the kid had been, the suits had gotten to him.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:14.000\nHe had watched the Emmys, a guy came out and said,\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:16.000\nhello, are you enjoying the Emmys?\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:17.000\nYou know what's not enjoyable?\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:19.000\nEmmy theft.\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:22.000\nHi, like these Grammys?\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nBeyonce's gonna starve to death.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:26.000\nStop stealing music.\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:28.000\nOh, hello, happy Oscars, everybody.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:31.000\nPirates are afoot.\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:34.000\nThere's so much fucking awareness of Jesus Christ.\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:37.000\nWhat the fuck, you guys made your empire out of the fact\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:40.000\nthat it's easy for me to watch your dumb, free shit.\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:42.000\nNow that it's fucking freer and dumber,\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:44.000\nI'm like an Elma thief.\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:48.000\nIt's also, first of all, thank you for calling my stuff\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:50.000\nfree and dumb.\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:54.000\nNo, but as free and dumb as Captain Phillips,\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:58.000\nmaybe you've seen it, it's an important film.\n\n30:58.000 --> 30:59.000\nAlso free.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\nAlso, what am I gonna do?\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:02.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:04.000\nIt's not like they're watching a Clint Eastwood film\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:05.000\nand they got busted.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:06.000\nWell, he's kind of old.\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:08.000\nHe wouldn't really do much either.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:10.000\nBut what?\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:12.000\nClint Eastwood's very old.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:14.000\nHe's quite old and he would have no problem\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:16.000\nwith us saying that.\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:18.000\nAnd even if he did, what in the hell?\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:21.000\nWhat a weird stance to take.\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:23.000\nThese guys love Clint Eastwood.\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:25.000\nYeah.\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:27.000\nI guess they're thinking about, well, they're Canadian.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:29.000\nThey're thinking about other people.\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:32.000\nYeah.

Like, they're intolerant and stuff.\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:29.000\nBut the other thing is, it's like a problem I always had\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:32.000\nwith the Revenge of the Nerds movies.\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:35.000\nThe nerds, at the end, are jocks.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:36.000\nThey don't...\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:38.000\nThey have the cheerleaders as girlfriends.\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:39.000\nYeah, they start banning...\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:41.000\nThey had semi-consensual sex with them.\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:42.000\nYeah.\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:45.000\nAnd it's clearly designed by studio executives\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:48.000\nwho just assume every nerd would love to be them\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:50.000\ninstead of like, why can't you just be yourself?\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:54.000\nSure. And of course, people who cast Anthony...\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:55.000\nWhat's his name?\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:56.000\nEdwards.\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:59.000\nAnthony Edwards and a keratin as nerds, you

Hollywood.\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:06.000\nThey couldn't find a guy with bad teeth.\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:08.000\nBut the...\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:09.000\nYeah, no, I totally...\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:13.000\nI just have a problem with people not being tolerant of others.\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:16.000\nSo, you know, sometimes, like, you know,\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:21.000\nI just find this kind of nasty nerd culture, you know?\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:22.000\nI'll go you one better.\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:23.000\nWhat?\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:25.000\nAnd confuse things all the more.\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:28.000\nI'm back-lashing on the recent nerd,\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:30.000\ngenuine nerd backlash culture.\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:35.000\nI don't like this whole...\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:37.000\nI'm a real nerd.\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:40.000\nEveryone's calling themselves a nerd now,\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:41.000\nso...\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:43.000\nAnd I'm a real nerd because I have eczema.\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nI'm a...\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:47.000\nI think that's horse shit.\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:49.000\nI think...\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:51.000\nI'd like to show you my eczema.\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:53.000\nMaybe that's what the old ladies saw on the plane.\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:55.000\nI have a flaky...\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:56.000\nDo you think that...\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:57.000\nIs this eczema?\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:59.000\nWill you look?\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:00.000\nLet me see.\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:03.000\nA burn-busting show in Toronto this week, guys.\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:05.000\nShow me your eczema.\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:07.000\nI don't know what it is.\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:09.000\nI think it might just be not showering for a month.\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:10.000\nIt could be.\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:11.000\nI'm just sort of peeling apart.\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:13.000\nNo, it's probably eczema.\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:16.000\nBut yeah, I don't know.\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:20.000\nI feel like, oh, this is separatism, or...\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:22.000\nWell, you're talking about my ex-wife, she would say,\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:24.000\nI'm not a nerd because I go to Comic-Con.\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:27.000\nI'm a nerd because I complain about Comic-Con.\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:32.000\nI mean, I think if you are...\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:37.000\nIf you are worried that what's in your brain,\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:40.000\nit shouldn't come out of your mouth,\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:43.000\nwouldn't get you elected president, you're a nerd.\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:44.000\nAnd I think if that...\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:48.000\nIf we end up finding out that 249 million of us are nerds,\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:50.000\nthen we get to walk up to the White House and go,\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:51.000\nyou're out!\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:53.000\nLike, I think that...\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:55.000\nI feel like sort of like...\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:56.000\nI don't know.\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:58.000\nI feel like there's a nerd revolution where everyone's like,\n\n37:58.000 --> 37:59.000\nI'm a nerd too.\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:01.000\nThat's the nice thing about the third act of preventing the nerds,\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:03.000\nis that they go, you know what?\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:05.000\nCome on down here if you think you're a nerd,\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:08.000\nand being a nerd becomes popular.\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:10.000\nYes, there's irony to that.\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:12.000\nAnd then you thought you based your career on that?\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:13.000\nYeah.\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:14.000\nI'm going to be the...\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:15.000\nI'm going to get so late.\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:19.000\nI'm going to be the holding coffee of nerds.\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:21.000\nI don't know.\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:23.000\nI don't know.\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:26.000\nThere's a new thing now where it's like,\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:29.000\nthere's people who go like, I'm a real nerd.\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:31.000\nI don't just look cute in glasses.\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:33.000\nLike that hipster word.\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:34.000\nThe word hipster now.\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:37.000\nIt's like we're just working towards a world where hipsters come forward\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:39.000\nand go, yes, I am a hipster.\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:40.000\nBut...\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:43.000\nI'm tired of being picked on by nerds.\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:46.000\nBut when I hear the...\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:48.000\nI like cool music, alright?\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:49.000\nIt's fine.\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:53.000\nWhen I hear people making fun of using hipster as a derogatory term,\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:55.000\nyou know, I'm like...\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:58.000\nI don't find that threatening, you know?\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:01.000\nI mean, like, a hipster to me.\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:04.000\nSo, you know, it's not like...\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:08.000\nLike you said, I could probably talk to this guy about music, you know?\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:12.000\nI'm not going to fit in their skinny pants or anything, but, you know...\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:14.000\nBut anytime anybody says anything, it's like,\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:18.000\nnerd used to really mean it was like, fuck that guy, he's a nerd.\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:20.000\nNo, fuck that guy.\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:22.000\nHe can't come to our party.\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:23.000\nHe's a nerd.\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:24.000\nRight.\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:27.000\nAnd there's a ton of people in this room that truly do not remember\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:29.000\nthat that actually was the case.\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:31.000\nBecause I was honestly, like, very...\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:33.000\nI was totally very young when that changed,\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:35.000\nbecause of movies like Revenge of the Nerds.\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:37.000\nIt was like, oh, there's this word, nerd.\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:39.000\nLike, okay, now it's funny and interesting.\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:42.000\nIt's like, you can watch movies that pre-date Revenge of the Nerds.\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:43.000\nThe N-word?\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:45.000\nThere's the N-word, yeah.\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:46.000\nThe...\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:47.000\nThere's movies...\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:49.000\nI can say nerd, I am one.\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:50.000\nIf you watch...\n\n39:50.000 --> 39:52.000\nFind a movie called Joysticks,\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:55.000\nwhich is like this video game exploitation movie.\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:57.000\nIt pre-dates Revenge of the Nerds,\n\n39:57.000 --> 39:59.000\nand it sort of typifies, like,\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:01.000\nthere's other movies, like,\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:04.000\nwhere they're in the 80s,\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:06.000\nbut it's before Revenge of the Nerds,\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:09.000\nand it's like, there is a character with glasses\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:11.000\nand a pocket protector in the movie,\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:13.000\nand they do pick on him,\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:16.000\nbut the big difference is the guys picking on him are the heroes.\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:19.000\nLike, and they do

I guess he's a fucking hipster.\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:04.000\nLet's beat him up!\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:08.000\nI used to truly believe that there was,\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:10.000\nI really recently just changed.\n\n42:10.000 --> 42:12.000\nI used to think that there really wasn't good\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:16.000\nand bad in people, that I really felt that there was,\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:19.000\nwe're all flawed, and sometimes we hurt other people,\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:21.000\nand sometimes we act selfishly,\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:23.000\nand then other times we rise above it and we don't.\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:25.000\nBut I truly now believe that that's not true.\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:28.000\nI really believe there's just good and bad people.\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:29.000\nShitty people.\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:32.000\nAnd who lack the ability to empathize, you know?\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:35.000\nSo that's who I really don't have any patience for.\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:37.000\nI would say, in some conversation today,\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:39.000\nI was saying, talking about...\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:41.000\nBy the way, I'm not on grass.\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:44.000\nYou keep doing comics to this,

those callbacks, like,\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:56.000\nand it makes me feel like I hurt your feelings when I say that.\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:58.000\nThat's the sasperilla's got me nuts.\n\n42:58.000 -->

59:56.000\nabout giving away so much of myself.\n\n59:56.000 --> 59:58.000\nDon't you, don't you feel that that's, that's weird?\n\n59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000\nLike, don't you ever feel like\n\n01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000\nwhat you make is what you, you know...\n\n01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000\nI think if you, you do watch the movies\n\n01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000\nthat make you get a better idea how I see the world\n\n01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000\nthan, than if you hung out with me maybe.\n\n01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000\nI don't know, I'm very nervous about giving away\n\n01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000\nmy, my personal life.\n\n01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000\nWell, that's a huge, I think that is a huge, like, key.\n\n01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000\nI, I am not, like, I think that's what defines me.\n\n01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000\nIt's like, I'm totally, like,\n\n01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000\nonce you get to the bottom of the barrel,\n\n01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000\nthe way you scrape is like, there's nothing there.\n\n01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000\nIt's like, oh, this barrel\n\n01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000\nthanks you for being a part of scraping it.\n\n01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000\nLike, I, I'm not,\n\n01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nI, I think you are a more genuine person than me.\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000\nI think you actually do have\n\n01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000\nopinions that you wouldn't back off\n\n01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000\nof if a mob of people screamed enough at you.\n\n01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000\nLike, I think you do,\n\n01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000\nI look up to you for that reason.\n\n01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000\nI think you have a voice and a, and a point of view.\n\n01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000\nI think that you're,\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000\nbut that's the stuff that you,\n\n01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000\nyou don't give it away by sharing it.\n\n01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000\nYou don't give it away on top of it,\n\n01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000\nand the wind wafts in,\n\n01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000\nand nowadays people come in,\n\n01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000\nand if they want it, they get it.\n\n01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000\nYou can charge them a dollar for it,\n\n01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000\nand if they don't like it,\n\n01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000\nyou can tell them to go fuck themselves.\n\n01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000\nIt's amazing.\n\n01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000\nIt's like, it's not like when we were younger.\n\n01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000\nIt's a whole crazy world.\n\n01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000\nIt's like, you could, you could,\n\n01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000\nit's like no money down.\n\n01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000\nYou could create a whole cult of personality.\n\n01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000\nPeople could be crucifying you in five years.\n\n01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000\nAnd I think, I think,\n\n01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000\nMy ex-wife said,\n\n01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000\nand by the way,\n\n01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000\nI do love her dearly.\n\n01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000\nIt's not like we had a big horrible fallout.\n\n01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000\nShe once said to me,\n\n01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000\nshe goes, you're a misanthrope.\n\n01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000\nAnd I said, you're only saying that because you're a person.\n\n01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000\nBut\n\n01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000\nI don't see myself as a misanthrope.\n\n01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000\nI just feel really awkward.\n\n01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000\nAnd you know, I really related\n\n01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000\nwith Spencer when,\n\n01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000\nyou know, he was awkward by the whole thing.\n\n01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000\nGood segue.\n\n01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000\nLet's bring up Spencer Crittenden!\n\n01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000\nNow, I've had some loud applause before.\n\n01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000\nBut Jesus Christ.\n\n01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:14.000\nThat wasn't an invitation for more.\n\n01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000\nThank you.\n\n01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000\nThat was all pent up from the movie, I assume.\n\n01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000\nWhat's up, you guys?\n\n01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000\nCan I get something off my chest?\n\n01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000\nI'm a nerd.\n\n01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000\nAnd I'm fucking sick of all these jocks acting like nerds.\n\n01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000\nNo, but okay.\n\n01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000\nI don't actually take a lot of shit from being a nerd.\n\n01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000\nSo I've said that before,\n\n01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000\nbut I didn't mean it.\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000\nBut here's the thing about social groups.\n\n01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000\nFrom nerds to jocks to everything.\n\n01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000\nIt's all about excluding other people.\n\n01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000\nLike, if you're a group,\n\n01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000\nyou're only a group because you're not that group.\n\n01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000\nYou're this group.\n\n01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000\nSo you have to single people out and ridicule them.\n\n01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000\nOtherwise, you're just a huge, you know, non-group.\n\n01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000\nAnd so in high school,\n\n01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000\nwhen I was a genuine bona fide nerd\n\n01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000\nand punished for it,\n\n01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000\nand choosing it,\n\n01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000\nI would report dutifully to a living room\n\n01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000\nfull of other nerds and play Dungeons and Dragons,\n\n01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000\nand we would talk shit about fucking jocks\n\n01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000\nbecause they weren't allowed.\n\n01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000\nAnd if one of them had showed up,\n\n01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000\nwe would have treated them like shit.\n\n01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000\nI don't think it's a good part of nerd culture,\n\n01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000\nbut I think that's more humanity than anything else.\n\n01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000\nIt's just we got to get cred.\n\n01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000\nWe got to kick other people out so we can be in.\n\n01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000\nWhen I was in high school,\n\n01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000\nI was actually friends with all the other groups.\n\n01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000\nMe, too.\n\n01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000\nBut I didn't consider them...\n\n01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.000\nLook, I hated myself way more than anybody else was going on.\n\n01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000\nSo I didn't care what they thought of me.\n\n01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000\nYeah, I kind of was more like that, too.\n\n01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000\nAnd because of that, everyone liked me.\n\n01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000\nAnd I was like, well, this works.\n\n01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000\nBut then...\n\n01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000\nI only cared.\n\n01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000\nI was the biggest Jim Carrey fucking whore.\n\n01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000\nI only cared if people liked me.\n\n01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000\nAnd I would do anything for a fucking social dollar.\n\n01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000\nAnd they didn't like you, right?\n\n01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000\nNo, they did.\n\n01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000\nIt worked.\n\n01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000\nIt's a thing.\n\n01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000\nThere's no wrong answers necessarily.\n\n01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000\nThere's wrong answers.\n\n01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000\nI was a nerd for how much I wanted people to like me.\n\n01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000\nAnd I was like...\n\n01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000\njust clawing my way up.\n\n01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000\nWell, I was doing stand-up when I was like 16.\n\n01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000\nSo it was weird.\n\n01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nI didn't care about all the stuff everybody else cared about.\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000\nThey were worried about prom.\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000\nAnd I was trying to get a tight 20 together.\n\n01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000\nSeriously, I was just a weirdo that way.\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:48.000\nBut I also feel really embarrassed to admit this publicly.\n\n01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000\nThis may be an exclusive.\n\n01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000\nI was homecoming king.\n\n01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000\nI was senior class vice president.\n\n01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000\nI thought it was a joke.\n\n01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000\nNo, it probably was half.\n\n01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000\nIt was like...\n\n01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000\nA lot of the nerds I talked to that were performance oriented,\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000\nby their senior year,\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000\nthey had worked their way up to like,\n\n01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000\nI am the clown prince of nerdness.\n\n01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000\nAnd it was like, you've blurred the line between nerds.\n\n01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000\nI was like, people really...\n\n01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000\nWe used the word popularity when I was a kid.\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000\nI don't even know if that means anything anymore now\n\n01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000\nthat everyone's connected to their phones and shit.\n\n01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000\nBut yeah, it still means stuff.\n\n01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000\nPopularity was like a thing.\n\n01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000\nIt still is.\n\n01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000\nKnowing who you were.\n\n01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000\nWhen Tom Kenny and I...\n\n01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000\nTom Kenny, you guys know him as SpongeBob and all those other stuff.\n\n01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000\nAnd Ice King.\n\n01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000\nHe's the Ice King on Adventure Time.\n\n01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000\nThat's the crowd, yeah.\n\n01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000\nYeah, that's the only time I ever asked him if I could be\n\n01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000\non one of the shows he works on, actually,\n\n01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000\nbecause I love that show so much.\n\n01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000\nAnd I've known him since I was six years old.\n\n01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000\nWe've been friends our whole lives.\n\n01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000\nAnd in second grade, they were picking up teams...\n\n01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000\nThey were picking teams for dodgeball.\n\n01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000\nAnd there was three people left.\n\n01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.000\nIt was he, I, and this girl who had two hooks for arms.\n\n01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000\nThat's the true story.\n\n01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000\nAnd we were recently talking about it.\n\n01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:20.000\nAnd he said, that was the day I knew I'd never be good at sports.\n\n01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000\nAnd the way my ego worked, I actually thought,\n\n01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000\noh, they didn't pick us because they knew we can handle it.\n\n01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000\nSo I've always had this huge amount of self-esteem\n\n01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000\nand self-loathing all at the same time.\n\n01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000\nBeing able to just say, yeah, in a moment,\n\n01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000\nlike you can emergency bilge, like, yeah.\n\n01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000\nYeah, I just thought, yeah.\n\n01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000\nBy the way, she got picked before us.\n\n01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000\nThat's the tag.\n\n01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000\nHope she was great, too, yeah.\n\n01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000\nWell, she's a ringer in the dodgeball game.\n\n01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000\nShe had two hooks.\n\n01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000\nYeah, she just pops them and they stick to her.\n\n01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000\nThose are the days when I discovered them.\n\n01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000\nYou didn't hit me.\n\n01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000\nI caught it.\n\n01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000\nIt counts.\n\n01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000\nYeah, it's fine.\n\n01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000\nYou're out now.\n\n01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000\nSorry, Dan.\n\n01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000\nWhat were you saying?\n\n01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000\nI actually, I mean, my way of coping with it\n\n01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000\nwasn't to, like, create the mythology of my head.\n\n01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000\nI would just, I just found out,\n\n01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:12.000\noh, there's a wire that all this pain comes through.\n\n01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000\nI thought you had to get up and kick my ass.\n\n01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:20.000\nHere's some pain coming through.\n\n01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:26.000\nYou cut out my best parts in the movie.\n\n01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000\nThe movie only had my best parts.\n\n01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000\nLike, there's literally not another scene of me\n\n01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000\nbeing funny in any of those 600 hours of footage.\n\n01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000\nIt's amazing.\n\n01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000\nCha-ching.\n\n01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000\nYeah, no, you're telling me.\n\n01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000\nYou heard that applause.\n\n01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000\nThat's not...\n\n01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000\nThank you.\n\n01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000\nThat's very kind.\n\n01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000\nAnyways, I don't know why I have to follow this thought.\n\n01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000\nI followed the cord with the pain on it,\n\n01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.000\nand I found that it plugs into part of your heart,\n\n01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000\nand you can pull it.\n\n01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000\nPull it.\n\n01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000\nThe pain cord.\n\n01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000\nYeah.\n\n01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000\nAnd you don't feel anything anymore.\n\n01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000\nAnd you don't, you can actually be really mean to people.\n\n01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000\nLike, and you don't, like, there's no empathy anymore,\n\n01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000\nso you could, like, squeeze someone's head.\n\n01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000\nYou're going into the Game of Thrones.\n\n01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000\nThe Game of Thrones.\n\n01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000\nWhat am I, 70?\n\n01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000\nThat was the end of it.\n\n01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000\nWhen the guy puts the thumbs to the eyeballs.\n\n01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000\nIt's like, man, you know the only thing that keeps...\n\n01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000\nIsn't it funny to realize that?\n\n01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000\nThe only thing...\n\n01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000\nHuman beings have these eyeballs.\n\n01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000\nLike, if you're in a fight, like, you kind of...\n\n01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000\nLike, if you're, like, a feral human,\n\n01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000\nlike, I guess you'd probably scratch for him.\n\n01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000\nLike, I'm going to scratch your eyes out.\n\n01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000\nBut, like, truly, like, if you get in a fight,\n\n01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000\nlike, the only thing that keeps you from actually\n\n01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000\nactively, like, just doing everything you can\n\n01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000\nto this, like, these little soft grapes\n\n01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000\nthat represent 90% of the person's ability to function...\n\n01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000\nCameras made of jelly.\n\n01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000\nThat's what they are.\n\n01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000\nThe only thing that keeps you from really getting in there\n\n01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000\nis actual, like, empathy.\n\n01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000\nLike, that's why when in a movie somebody goes like...\n\n01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.000\nIt, like, represents that person not giving a fuck.\n\n01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000\nAnd you go like, what the fuck is he...\n\n01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000\nWhat does he do? Oh, my God!\n\n01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000\nBut you're like, well, if you wanted to win a fight,\n\n01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000\nI guess that's...\n\n01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000\nI guess that's how you do it.\n\n01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000\nThat's what chimps do.\n\n01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000\nYeah, they go for the fucking face\n\n01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000\nand the genitals and the hands.\n\n01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000\nA buddy of mine...\n\n01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000\nEverything that makes you a chimp.\n\n01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000\nA buddy of mine was in...\n\n01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000\nIn Georgia.\n\n01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000\nAnd they had a thing when he was growing up at the fair,\n\n01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000\nand it was, uh...\n\n01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000\nIt was, uh...\n\n01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000\nMonkey Boxing, or Chimp Boxing.\n\n01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000\nAnd, and so this guy's like,\n\n01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000\nI'm gonna go in there.\n\n01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000\nIt was $5,000 the last two minutes in the cage.\n\n01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000\nI go in there, I get my mama,\n\n01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000\nget my mama a trailer.\n\n01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000\nLike, he had all the money.\n\n01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000\nOh, come on!\n\n01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000\nWait, how much?\n\n01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.000\nHow much?\n\n01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000\nHe worked at Cartoon Network.\n\n01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000\nWhat was the price? Sorry.\n\n01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000\n$5,000 if you could last two minutes.\n\n01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000\nYou could buy a truck.\n\n01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000\nOkay.\n\n01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000\nSo he goes in...\n\n01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000\nI'm gonna get my mama a trailer?\n\n01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000\nIt's not even a chimp.\n\n01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000\nIt's an orangutan.\n\n01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000\nOh, no!\n\n01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000\nOh, no.\n\n01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000\nThey're worse, I hear.\n\n01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000\nThey got longer reaches.\n\n01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000\nYeah.\n\n01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000\nWell, they also have, like...\n\n01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000\nThe painting was very misleading.\n\n01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000\nLike, he had him, like, proper, like, you know...\n\n01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000\nHe's gloved up.\n\n01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000\nTime's boxing.\n\n01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000\nYeah.\n\n01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000\nHe's got an Irish handlebar mustache.\n\n01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.000\nI heard you wanted to have a little bit of a roundabout with me.\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000\nQueensberry rules, will it be, then?\n\n01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000\nOne banana for the winner?\n\n01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000\nSo, so...\n\n01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000\nAnd there's no ring.\n\n01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000\nThere's a ring on the poster.\n\n01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000\nThey get in there and it's just a cage.\n\n01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:44.000\nAnd they've put a ring through the ropes, I mean, through the bars of the cage.\n\n01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000\nAnd he says the orangutan's got boxing gloves on.\n\n01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000\nHe's just sitting there.\n\n01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000\nAnd he's like...\n\n01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000\nAnd the guy goes, you know, I'll just rope-a-dope him, you know.\n\n01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000\nHe's got the arm length.\n\n01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000\nSo if I just...\n\n01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000\nIf I get in tight, you know, he's got his whole strategy.\n\n01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000\nI'll just get in tight.\n\n01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000\nNot rope-a-doping.\n\n01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000\nYeah.\n\n01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000\nSo he's gonna get in there tight.\n\n01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000\nI already doesn't know what rope-a-doping is.\n\n01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000\nSo he's doomed.\n\n01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000\nSo he gets in there.\n\n01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000\nAnd they go, ding!\n\n01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000\nHe says, you didn't even see the chimp.\n\n01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.000\nThe orangutan just shot across the cage, wrapped his legs around the guy, bit him in the face,\n\n01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000\nand pissed all over him.\n\n01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000\nHe's like...\n\n01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000\nAre you fucking kidding me?\n\n01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000\nYou weren't there?\n\n01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000\nNo, no, no, my friend George tells the story.\n\n01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000\nBut I do believe it's a true story.\n\n01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.000\nWell, when you box, don't you usually wear a mouth guard?\n\n01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000\nThat's why you're calling bullshit on this story?\n\n01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000\nI don't buy that.\n\n01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000\nYes, the orangutan cheated.\n\n01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000\nI think this orangutan was not playing by sanctions.\n\n01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000\nI'm playing rules.\n\n01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000\nThey could definitely get those gloves on.\n\n01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000\nBut I wouldn't trust anyone to go in your orangutan mouth.\n\n01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000\nWell...\n\n01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000\nAnyways, what I'm saying is, the reason we don't do that to each other when we get into fights...\n\n01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000\nIs because that's the...\n\n01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000\nWe love each other.\n\n01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000\nAt the end of the day?\n\n01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.000\nAt the end of the day, when we look at each other, we see each other.\n\n01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:06.000\nAnd chimpanzees and orangutans, when they look at each other, they see a genetic rival.\n\n01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.000\nAnd they're like, if I take that guy out, the thing that keeps them in line is fear.\n\n01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.000\nThey exist in these communities, and we're no strangers to this.\n\n01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000\nWe are 99% their cousins.\n\n01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:24.000\nBut the thing that makes us different, and the thing that ironically made us be the people with the nuclear weapons,\n\n01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000\nthe tires, and the fire, and the lasers, and the GPS, is compassion.\n\n01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:35.000\nAnd I'm not saying that it makes us good people, but it's like an evolutionary step that we took.\n\n01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000\nThat's my two cents as a non-anthropologist.\n\n01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000\nBut you don't think that's all fear-based?\n\n01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000\nYou think that's compassion-based?\n\n01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:49.000\nI think it's like we became a kind of weird combination of primate and pack animal.\n\n01:12:49.000 --> 01:13:01.000\nWhen I say chose, I mean in quotes, because evolution preferred an instinct for altruism.\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:08.000\nWhat we call, like, cool. That was nice of him. He didn't have to do that.\n\n01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.000\nWe exude that. We notice when it's not happening.\n\n01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000\nWe notice that it's not happening all the time.\n\n01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.000\nBut the fact is, we have it in spades over giraffes and chimpanzees.\n\n01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000\nWe are ridiculous about it.\n\n01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000\nWe will take bullets for each other without thinking about it.\n\n01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000\nWe don't always do it. You can't predict it.\n\n01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:38.000\nBut we do have more of a propensity for sacrifice in the face of another human being suffering.\n\n01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000\nWe will go, that's not fair.\n\n01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:46.000\nHey, whoa, whoa, what's going on over here? Stop picking on that guy. Even if it doesn't profit us,\n\n01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000\neven if it puts us at risk.\n\n01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000\nBefore we even know what we're doing, we kind of go, whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000\nWhat are you doing?\n\n01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000\nThat's my theory.\n\n01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000\nNone of us is based on science. It's based on the three documentaries I've seen.\n\n01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000\nAnd what I choose to believe.\n\n01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:08.000\nWhat you're describing is like our sharp teeth or our scorpion sting or our hard armor.\n\n01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000\nThat's what we've evolved, is this really intense packed community.\n\n01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000\nWe're jingoists.\n\n01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000\nWell, yeah, but it's kind of the group mentality thing I was talking about with nerds.\n\n01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000\nThat's what we evolved and that's why we go to war.\n\n01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:23.000\nIt's because we can get together a band and go beat the shit out of a rhino.\n\n01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000\nThat's what works.\n\n01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:30.000\nWhen you watch the 300 and you see that idea of a small football team of guys going,\n\n01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:38.000\nwe are, we are, we are.\n\n01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000\nThat's how we kind of feel in general.\n\n01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:47.000\nWe default to that weird, we don't just fucking run.\n\n01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000\nI see that kind of behavior more not about protecting the little guy,\n\n01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.000\nbut more about being afraid that someone's going to take their stuff away.\n\n01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:01.000\nI think that's what I'm saying is that that's the weird twisted path that we've taken,\n\n01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000\nis that we protect ourselves through that instinct.\n\n01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:10.000\nI don't think that God is moving through us and therefore we're like really cool to each other.\n\n01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000\nI think that our species is seven billion strong because we at some point\n\n01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000\nfigured out the cheat code of like, how's my neighbor doing?\n\n01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:25.000\nIt was like not, and we are the descendants genetically of the primates\n\n01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000\nthat acted more on that impulse than others.\n\n01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:33.000\nIt worked out for our species just because it caused like giant communities.\n\n01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000\nYou're much more hopeful than I am.\n\n01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000\nWell, it's not getting us anywhere.\n\n01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000\nWe're all going to die together, like a bunch of altruistic assholes.\n\n01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000\nBut we're going to die after the dodo did.\n\n01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000\nFuck the dodo, that's the key.\n\n01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.000\nFucking dodo can take a flying fuck at a rolling version of itself.\n\n01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000\nMaybe the dodo is the asshole.\n\n01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000\nI'll tell you the biggest asshole in the world, giraffes.\n\n01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000\nFuck giraffes.\n\n01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000\nReally?\n\n01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000\nFucking long neck horse.\n\n01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000\nThat's bullshit.\n\n01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000\nNo, but it's the dolphins.\n\n01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000\nThey're the rapists of the sea.\n\n01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000\nWe had to come back to dolphins being terrible people.\n\n01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000\nWell, because people love dolphins and they're sketchy.\n\n01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000\nWe love dolphins as a species, but then it turns out, yeah,\n\n01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000\napparently now the new development is that when you look at dolphins,\n\n01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000\nif you get past the fourth wall of dolphins, it turns out they're sexists.\n\n01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000\nYeah.\n\n01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000\nWhich I love.\n\n01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000\nA dolphin will fuck you up.\n\n01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000\nYeah.\n\n01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000\nIf you're a shark, that's for sure.\n\n01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000\nThat's all I know.\n\n01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000\nOr if you're a woman.\n\n01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000\nA woman dolphin.\n\n01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000\nAnd if you're a female shark, oh my God.\n\n01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000\nOh my God.\n\n01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000\nThey must be like, payday.\n\n01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:45.000\nI saw a video really recently about a dolphin playing with a cat.\n\n01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000\nIt was the cutest thing in the world.\n\n01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.000\nThe dolphin would use its snout and tap the cat on the head,\n\n01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000\nand then the cat would touch its paw to the snout,\n\n01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000\nand they'd go back and forth for two and a half minutes.\n\n01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000\nIt was adorable.\n\n01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000\nYeah, that's the edited version.\n\n01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000\nOh yeah.\n\n01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000\nI was before the cat was mercilessly slaughtered.\n\n01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000\nIt'd be great.\n\n01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000\nThey're smart.\n\n01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000\nAs soon as that prick drops that iPhone, I am fucking up that cat.\n\n01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:14.000\nIf you're listening, and here there's a lot of dolphin experts in Toronto,\n\n01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.000\nbut if you are listening out there, please come to the nearest\n\n01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000\nHarmontown City.\n\n01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000\nIt's a dolphin expert.\n\n01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000\nWe really want to hear more about, we're going to get to the bottom\n\n01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000\nof whether dolphins are good people or bad people.\n\n01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000\nBecause I really want to know, because you hear these stories\n\n01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000\nof people are drowning, and then the dolphins save them,\n\n01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000\nand then you hear other stories that are like, no,\n\n01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.000\nthey actually actively drown the people because they're sociopaths.\n\n01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000\nAnd then you think, well, that's like humans too.\n\n01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000\nLike you could run across the wrong kind of human.\n\n01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000\nRight, right.\n\n01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000\nAnd whenever anyone uses that about an animal, they're more frightened\n\n01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000\nof you than you are of them.\n\n01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nYou're like, well, how do I know this isn't the crazy bear?\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000\nYeah.\n\n01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000\nThere's a bit of a Ted Bundy of dolphins.\n\n01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000\nThere's just like 12 really sexist dolphins that are given everyone\n\n01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.000\nthe wrong impression.\n\n01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000\nYeah.\n\n01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000\nThat's what they tell you to play dead with a bear\n\n01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000\nuntil they start eating you.\n\n01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000\nThat was always my fear.\n\n01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000\nIt's like, why do you play dead?\n\n01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000\nAre you going to eat you that you're dead?\n\n01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000\nRight.\n\n01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000\nI don't know if I grandmother that one.\n\n01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.000\nI think some of the bears are like,\n\n01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000\nyou're supposed to play dead because some of the bears\n\n01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000\ndon't want to eat you.\n\n01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000\nThey want you to stop attacking their cubs.\n\n01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000\nSo they swipe at you, and then you're supposed to go,\n\n01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000\noh, good job.\n\n01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000\nI'm dead.\n\n01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000\nSee you later.\n\n01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000\nGood luck in your bear business.\n\n01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000\nThat guy was a hell of an actor.\n\n01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000\nI can't kill him.\n\n01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000\nHe's a great thespian.\n\n01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000\nBears are like, they're huge theater fans.\n\n01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000\nYou guys are in Toronto.\n\n01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000\nThey have bears walking down the street, right?\n\n01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000\nThey're like, you know...\n\n01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000\nDid someone say gay?\n\n01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000\nDid they mean like gay bears?\n\n01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000\nOh, gay bears.\n\n01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000\nOkay.\n\n01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000\nI thought you meant it was gay.\n\n01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000\nThe idea that wildlife was part of your society.\n\n01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000\nThat's so gay to have a bear walking down the street.\n\n01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000\nWith an otter.\n\n01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.000\nGet real.\n\n01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000\nThat's gay.\n\n01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.000\nThey're like, you know, bears at the dump are like\n\n01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000\nbikers.\n\n01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.000\nYou know, you just stay in your car and keep the doors locked.\n\n01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000\nDid you ever go to the dump to look at bears?\n\n01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000\nI never went to the dump to look at bears.\n\n01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000\nAll right.\n\n01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000\nA couple of wounds from people.\n\n01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000\nYou guys going to Bear Dump in Toronto?\n\n01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000\nPack Eagle.\n\n01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000\nPack Eagle?\n\n01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000\nThe excellent Bear Dump.\n\n01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000\nIs that the, is that like Lover's Lane?\n\n01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000\nWell, sometimes when we weren't listening to the radio programs,\n\n01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000\nwe'd go out to the dump.\n\n01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000\nI'm just picturing all these discarded bears.\n\n01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:40.000\nI never understood that, like, like, like.\n\n01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000\nIt's the land of misfit toys.\n\n01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.000\nI guess I do get it.\n\n01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000\nI do get it.\n\n01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000\nI'm a bear with no teeth.\n\n01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000\nBut didn't that always confuse you when people would say like,\n\n01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:55.000\noh, don't feed the, the trouble is people feed the animal in question.\n\n01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000\nLike usually it's bears, but they say the same thing about\n\n01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:03.000\nlions or whatever they got. The danger is when they associate humans with\n\n01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000\nfood and you're like, oh, got it.\n\n01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000\nWait, what?\n\n01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000\nNo.\n\n01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000\nWhat?\n\n01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000\nWhat?\n\n01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000\nLike, because that's how you train a dog.\n\n01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000\nWell, I think you might be misunderstanding what they're saying.\n\n01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000\nThe associating with you with food is now every,\n\n01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000\nevery person I see is going to give me food.\n\n01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000\nSo I'm going to come up to them and bother them.\n\n01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000\nYeah.\n\n01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000\nAnd the person gives them a peanut.\n\n01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000\nOr it doesn't.\n\n01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000\nAnd then they, you know, if it's a coyote, they bark.\n\n01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000\nAnd, you know, that's scary for the person.\n\n01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000\nLike you don't want them approaching you because then someone could\n\n01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000\nfreak out and stab it in the face or something.\n\n01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000\nAll right.\n\n01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.000\nSo the reason, so the reason to not feed coyotes is because coyotes will get\n\n01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000\nstabbed in the face by someone without food.\n\n01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000\nYeah.\n\n01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000\nYou know about coyote hazing?\n\n01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000\nCoyote hazing.\n\n01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000\nYeah.\n\n01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000\nIt's really rampant in colleges.\n\n01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000\nIt's a shame.\n\n01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000\nI can't, if I can't have an honest conversation with you.\n\n01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000\nNo.\n\n01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000\nCoyote hazing.\n\n01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.000\nThe intent, you know, and I don't know, everyone knows I'm a huge coyote\n\n01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000\nexpert.\n\n01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.000\nBut what a cash fans.\n\n01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000\nYeah.\n\n01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.000\nI love that applause.\n\n01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:11.000\nSpencer has a, Spencer, can I explain to Bob?\n\n01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000\nI'd love it if you did.\n\n01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:19.000\nSpencer, Spencer, Spencer hears about coyote activity sometimes in Los\n\n01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000\nAngeles.\n\n01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.000\nSpencer has in his head, he imagines that if he ever gets attacked by a\n\n01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000\ngang of coyotes.\n\n01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000\nI don't, I didn't put it that way.\n\n01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:32.000\nI was in a virtual reality setting where dangerous coyotes are definitely going to\n\n01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000\nattack you until one of you guys is dead.\n\n01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:41.000\nSpencer believes that he knows how to fight a pack of coyote effectively.\n\n01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000\nFour to five.\n\n01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.000\nRopa dope pack.\n\n01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000\nNo, no.\n\n01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.000\nNot ropa dope.\n\n01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000\nNope.\n\n01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000\nIt's a circular kicking technique.\n\n01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.000\nI mean, I feel like Toronto has earned, has earned a demonstration.\n\n01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:58.000\nI don't want to, I don't want to pimp you or anything.\n\n01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000\nI, I guess I'm going to have to do it.\n\n01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000\nI mean, you have to now.\n\n01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:07.000\nI mean, this, when you lean, when you lean forward in your chair, this whole stage\n\n01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000\nshook.\n\n01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000\nSo, I don't know.\n\n01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000\nI'm going to, I'm going to move.\n\n01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000\nIt just, it just, just don't do it.\n\n01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000\nAt least segue me back into coyote hazing.\n\n01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000\nJust do it.\n\n01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000\nBecause I really want to get to the bottom of this.\n\n01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000\nJust do a, just do a quiet Canadian version of the coyote defense technique.\n\n01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000\nThat's just going to look like it.\n\n01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000\nHow do you, just for Bob, what do you mean quiet?\n\n01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000\nSo, so there's five coyotes all around you.\n\n01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000\nYeah.\n\n01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000\nAnd, and.\n\n01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:47.000\nIt's just, you don't, you don't keep your back exposed for long.\n\n01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000\nYou keep your back moving so they can't go at your knees.\n\n01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000\nI thought it was going to be more of a sweep kick, but it was more.\n\n01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000\nNo, you can't sweep a four-legged animal.\n\n01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000\nThat's your first mistake.\n\n01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000\nThat would be my first mistake.\n\n01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000\nYeah.\n\n01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000\nThey got way more balanced than us.\n\n01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000\nThat's why we use chairs with four legs.\n\n01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000\nHe was definitely taking it easy because you're nervous about these risers.\n\n01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000\nI mean, you felt that.\n\n01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000\nYeah.\n\n01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000\nThey sway.\n\n01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000\nYeah.\n\n01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000\nSo, so you, but you obviously care about coyotes.\n\n01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000\nYeah.\n\n01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000\nYou mean from his tender kicks?\n\n01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000\nHe wants them to live to tell the tale.\n\n01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:27.000\nMy coyote defense, if we're just fantasizing, involves a firearm.\n\n01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000\nYeah.\n\n01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000\nOh, no, this is an unarmed, this is an unarmed scenario.\n\n01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000\nIf I had, you know, even just a backpack, my tactics would differ greatly.\n\n01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000\nOf course.\n\n01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000\nWell, what would it look like if you had a backpack?\n\n01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000\nYou'd spin around backwards while swinging a backpack.\n\n01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000\nAll right.\n\n01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000\nOkay.\n\n01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000\nPasha.\n\n01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.000\nYeah.\n\n01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000\nYou know, one would tackle you.\n\n01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000\nThe other eat your lunchables.\n\n01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.000\nIt's important.\n\n01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000\nWell, you distract them with the lunchables.\n\n01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000\nYou distract them with the lunchables.\n\n01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000\nNow, I'm, I love coyotes.\n\n01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000\nI know.\n\n01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000\nI actually do.\n\n01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000\nI, I do like coyotes.\n\n01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000\nThey're gorgeous.\n\n01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:04.000\nBut they're also, you know, they killed, they killed my dog, Sid Vicious.\n\n01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000\nI had a Yorkie.\n\n01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000\nI feel bad about that.\n\n01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000\nBut that's the animal kingdom.\n\n01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000\nAnimals do.\n\n01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000\nAnd it's terrible.\n\n01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000\nIt's terrible.\n\n01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000\nAnd in their defense, Sid was delicious.\n\n01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000\nNo.\n\n01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000\nNo, but yeah.\n\n01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000\nSo I feel really weird.\n\n01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000\nYou know, I actually went out with a chair.\n\n01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.000\nI didn't have a backpack and didn't think about kicking.\n\n01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000\nAnd the kicking is the last resort.\n\n01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.000\nI got it.\n\n01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.000\nI got it.\n\n01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.000\nBut I, I, I scared the coyote off of Jimmy Stewart and Andy to frame the other two dogs.\n\n01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000\nOh, did you save your other two dogs?\n\n01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000\nYeah.\n\n01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000\nYeah.\n\n01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000\nI mean, Los Angeles, I don't know if the Toronto has an equivalent, but Los Angeles, it's like,\n\n01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:42.000\nit's crazy to me because like a wildlife is, it astounds me.\n\n01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:47.000\nThe fact that there's raccoons astounds me because everywhere you look, there's just city.\n\n01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:52.000\nAnd then there's this whole population of like mountain lions and, and, and I don't know\n\n01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000\nwhere they come from or where they could possibly live.\n\n01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000\nBut yes, I understand that there's probably mountains involved.\n\n01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000\nThank you.\n\n01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.000\nGriffith Park is probably where they live.\n\n01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.000\nBut it's just like, like, like there's kind of, sometimes you'll see like a kind of dazed\n\n01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.000\ncoyote, like, like walking down the sidewalk.\n\n01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000\nIn Los Feliz.\n\n01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000\nAnd it's like, holy shit.\n\n01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.000\nIt's like a dog, but it ain't a dog.\n\n01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000\nIt'll eat another dog.\n\n01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000\nYeah.\n\n01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000\nYou got to haze them.\n\n01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000\nThat's why whenever I see them driving around, I like honk my horn and I shine my lights at\n\n01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000\nthem and I go at them like I'm going to hit them with my car.\n\n01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000\nCoyote hazing.\n\n01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.000\nPeople, look it up.\n\n01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000\nLet me talk about coyote hazing.\n\n01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000\nAnd the alternative, though, is that you're one of these people that just like your dog\n\n01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000\nis gone one way.\n\n01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000\nYeah.\n\n01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000\nThat's what you do it.\n\n01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000\nBecause like we were saying, if you feed a coyote, they'll be like, oh man, humans are\n\n01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000\ncool.\n\n01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000\nI can go in their backyard and whatever.\n\n01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000\nYou know, they think you're like a cool, they think humans aren't dangerous and they need\n\n01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000\nto think humans are dangerous so they're not comfortable around them because when they're\n\n01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.000\ncomfortable around them, they're animals.\n\n01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.000\nAll right.\n\n01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000\nWell, bears don't need to.\n\n01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.000\nNo, you should do it to a lot of wildlife.\n\n01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.000\nLike they suggest you, anytime you see a squirrel.\n\n01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.500\nNo, but they say throw rocks at bears and make yourself as big as possible.\n\n01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:02.500\nIt's the same thing.\n\n01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:03.500\nThey want you to be uncomfortable.\n\n01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:08.000\nThey want you to make animals uncomfortable around you.\n\n01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:16.000\nWe saw two mountain lions when we were making the Bigfoot movie I made.\n\n01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:24.000\nYou mean Willow Creek, which is available in all the demand.\n\n01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000\nIt was terrifying.\n\n01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:30.000\nWhat did they look like when you see them in the wild?\n\n01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.000\nBecause in the movies, they're always crouching on the rock.\n\n01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000\nIt was way scarier.\n\n01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:40.000\nIt was like standing up to really tall and it was just walking casual like, what up?\n\n01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000\nYou know, it was really intimidating.\n\n01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000\nAnd then it was a scene.\n\n01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.000\nThere's a scene in the tent that's really long and scary.\n\n01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:53.000\nWe filmed that about at 2 a.m. after we'd seen a mountain lion and the actor, Bryce Johnson,\n\n01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.000\nthis is a long take and his character started crying.\n\n01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000\nAnd I said, that was really good, Bryce, but I just don't think your character would cry\n\n01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.000\nin the scene.\n\n01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000\nHe goes, I'm not crying.\n\n01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.000\nHe's like, the character's not crying, I'm crying.\n\n01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.000\nWhy are we filming this out in the woods at 3 a.m.?\n\n01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000\nWe could be in a hotel parking lot.\n\n01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:20.000\nAnd so we were hanging around with the ranger who was a Bigfoot enthusiast.\n\n01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:26.000\nAnd so I was sitting close to ranger Robert because I figured he could protect me from a mountain lion.\n\n01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.000\nAnd he said, because you know, I'm a writer too.\n\n01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000\nAnd I go, oh, what are you writing?\n\n01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000\nHe goes, you know Twilight?\n\n01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000\nI go, yeah, I don't know Twilight.\n\n01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:46.000\nHe goes, well, I write coming of age stories set in the Bigfoot community, like Twilight.\n\n01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.000\nAnd I said, what's the name of your book?\n\n01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000\nYou guys, the first one was Yeti or Not.\n\n01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000\nAnd I know you think I'm setting up for a joke, but it's available on eBay.\n\n01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000\nYou can get Yeti or Not.\n\n01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000\nWhat was the second one?\n\n01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:07.000\nI didn't ask for the second one.\n\n01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000\nYou know what they say about boys with big feet?\n\n01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:15.000\nNo.\n\n01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000\nGood times.\n\n01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:23.000\nThe Bigfoot, it doesn't work as well with the adolescent Judy Bloom kind of culture.\n\n01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.000\nHello, God, it's me, Bigfoot.\n\n01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000\nGod, it's me, Sasquatch.\n\n01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:34.000\nI once, for about an evening, thought it would be funny to make that a movie.\n\n01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000\nAnd then I went out and bought it.\n\n01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:41.000\nAnd I was like, nobody would be, you know, it all started because someone said,\n\n01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000\nwhat are you doing next?\n\n01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:48.000\nI said, I'm doing a period piece.\n\n01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000\nPuns.\n\n01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000\nAh, puns.\n\n01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000\nPuns, we're back.\n\n01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000\nThat's how today started about how much we hated puns.\n\n01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.000\nI think it's funny, though, that your life was in the hands of a guy that then was like,\n\n01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000\nI'm a writer.\n\n01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000\nDid that make you feel less safe?\n\n01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.000\nTotally.\n\n01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000\nIt's like, stand back.\n\n01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000\nHe's got an idea.\n\n01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:16.000\nYou want a guy that's like, no, I definitely am totally enthused about the idea of physical conflict with nature.\n\n01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000\nNot a guy that's like, you know, I could have done Buffy.\n\n01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.000\nI'm doing this in the meantime.\n\n01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.000\nStand back, I've got a strong second act.\n\n01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:33.000\nBut also it's like, also like you being able to resonate with that guy makes you, like as a bodyguard,\n\n01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:40.000\nwhen it comes to a bodyguard, the quality I want most is not being able to understand what he's thinking.\n\n01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000\nYeah.\n\n01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:46.000\nIf I were to hire a bodyguard, I'd be like, oh, you're a giant slab of meat.\n\n01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000\nMe, back at me.\n\n01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000\nYeah, I was definitely the alpha male at that moment.\n\n01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000\nYeah, I've got a screenplay.\n\n01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000\nOh boy.\n\n01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000\nWell, I don't know how much time we've burned.\n\n01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000\nI don't know how Toronto's time works.\n\n01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:02.000\nI think I heard that your minutes are one minute and three seconds long.\n\n01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:06.000\nWell, these days your beers are a little stronger and your minutes are a little longer.\n\n01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.000\nThese days they're 57 minutes, I'm told.\n\n01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000\nOh, that's probably America's fault.\n\n01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000\nWe probably did too much fracking.\n\n01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000\nSorry about that.\n\n01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.000\nWe had to, we drink your milkshake a little bit.\n\n01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:25.000\nWe heard there's some time up here we could use to power our cars.\n\n01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:37.000\nBut yeah, I don't know how long we've gone, but I know that we should meet some friends and play some D&D in that order.\n\n01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:47.000\nNow, I know that we do have some friends that came here, like I know Jan's here.\n\n01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000\nIt's Jan, it's just spelled weird.\n\n01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.000\nNo offense, Jan.\n\n01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000\nJan, where are you?\n\n01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.000\nAre you here?\n\n01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.000\nAre you raising your hand?\n\n01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000\nDo you want to come up and visit with us just for a little bit?\n\n01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000\nJust for a second?\n\n01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:08.000\nJust for God's sake.\n\n01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000\nJane's been on the podcast before.\n\n01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:19.000\nJane makes a special brand of moonshine called Earthshine because Harmontowns is a moon colony.\n\n01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000\nSo Earthshine is what he makes.\n\n01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.000\nHow are you, buddy?\n\n01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000\nWhere are you living now?\n\n01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:30.000\nI live in, it's called upstate New York, Central New York, around Elmira.\n\n01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.000\nSo you made the trip here to Toronto to check out the show.\n\n01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000\nDid you bring your kid?\n\n01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000\nYep, Devon did.\n\n01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000\nHey, Devon, how are you?\n\n01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.000\nSo you're making moonshine in Elmira?\n\n01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000\nYes.\n\n01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.000\nIt's super legal there.\n\n01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000\nWell, it's actually not too bad.\n\n01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000\nIn New York state, you can make a limited quantity now.\n\n01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000\nCan you guys hear him okay?\n\n01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000\nDo you need to eat that mic a little more?\n\n01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000\nI need to eat the mic a little.\n\n01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000\nOkay.\n\n01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000\nDo you sell that Earthshine?\n\n01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000\nNo, no, I'm not allowed to sell it.\n\n01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000\nIt's a labor of love.\n\n01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000\nSpencer drank some.\n\n01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000\nI don't know if you can tell.\n\n01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000\nI'm doing good. I didn't drink that much.\n\n01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000\nYou know, I'm feeling warm.\n\n01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:07.000\nYeah, it comes in about 135 proofs.\n\n01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.000\nSo yeah, you definitely want to cut it with water, serve it on the rocks.\n\n01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000\nThat's tough.\n\n01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000\nYeah, we saw them.\n\n01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:15.000\nMost of these people saw the movie.\n\n01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:19.000\nThat wasn't your moonshine, but high proof alcohol.\n\n01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:24.000\nRight now, the crowd is going, oh, I hope Dan drinks some of it.\n\n01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.000\nYou're going to take a poll?\n\n01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000\nYou don't need to take a poll.\n\n01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.000\nThey want that ending.\n\n01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000\nI mean, I'm more than happy to.\n\n01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000\nIt's backstage.\n\n01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000\nThe show is almost over.\n\n01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:37.000\nYou're going to want to chase it with some vodka.\n\n01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:44.500\nI just noticed your logo is like, it's like the male female symbol, but it's like the\n\n01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:49.800\nmale thing, but the wiener is kind of bent around the circumference.\n\n01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:53.000\nIt's because you're talking about your sex drive diminishing.\n\n01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:59.000\nActually, I did a bumper sticker version of that that some people have seen that says\n\n01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000\nHarmontown, next tangent.\n\n01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000\nOh, that's a tangent.\n\n01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.000\nIt's like an off-ramp type of motif.\n\n01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.000\nNow, Aaron told me one thing.\n\n01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:12.000\nKeep him away from the shine.\n\n01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000\nOh, really?\n\n01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000\nNo.\n\n01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000\nPop scratch gold card.\n\n01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000\nYou have one job.\n\n01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.000\nCheers.\n\n01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000\nOh, no.\n\n01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:24.000\nThat's what I did.\n\n01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000\nI mean, it's so crazy.\n\n01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:33.000\nDo you ever talk about on stage?\n\n01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.000\nWe tried to.\n\n01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.000\nYou were trying to interview me, and Jeff kept interrupting me.\n\n01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.000\nI'm Bobcat.\n\n01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000\nHe just pointed at me.\n\n01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.000\nJeff.\n\n01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000\nWell, it's your seat.\n\n01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000\nI think Jeff's a lot more hurt than I am right now.\n\n01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000\nSo when I came up on stage, I introduced myself as Glenn.\n\n01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.000\nGlenn.\n\n01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000\nRight.\n\n01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000\nWhich is my birthday.\n\n01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:54.000\nAnd then I was feeling kind of like, here's a chance.\n\n01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000\nThere's a community.\n\n01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000\nIt's going to be very accepting.\n\n01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000\nI could have just come out as transgendered, right?\n\n01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:03.000\nSo I sent you a letter afterwards that you got the next night.\n\n01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000\nAnd then you read it in episode 79.\n\n01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:08.000\nYou read some of it, and you guys talked about it.\n\n01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000\nFive or 10 minutes about transgender, and it was really cool.\n\n01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:16.000\nYou really shared a lot of just very forthcoming, very accepting\n\n01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000\naround the whole idea of transgenderism.\n\n01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.000\nBecause transgender is the new black.\n\n01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000\nI want to end on the ground floor of that shit.\n\n01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000\nI don't want to get shot in the fucking...\n\n01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000\nSay the T-word, man.\n\n01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:35.000\nNo, but the chance-gender thing is like, you can't even say...\n\n01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000\nI can't even say a simple thing like, it's crazy.\n\n01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.000\nSomeone will go, that really offended me when you said it's crazy.\n\n01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000\nIt's fucking crazy.\n\n01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:50.000\nWe're us struggling to cope with it, to work with it, is a crazy new thing.\n\n01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000\nIt's new. It's very new.\n\n01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:57.000\nIt's coming out of this whole stigma of being a mental illness.\n\n01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:06.000\nAnd trying to deal with it as like an actual code in the DSM-4, DSM-5,\n\n01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:10.000\ndiagnostic manual for people.\n\n01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:19.000\nBut the mental illness side of it is that I'm really confused.\n\n01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:24.000\nSociety is confused about me, and I'm trying to deal with a society\n\n01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.000\nthat has all these expectations about how I'm going to behave.\n\n01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000\nThere was a time when somebody were to say, you know,\n\n01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:35.000\nI guess I was born a dude, technically, but I truly feel like\n\n01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.000\nI would like to identify as a woman.\n\n01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.000\nThere was definitely a time, and I think we're still living in that time,\n\n01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.000\nwhen people would go, okay, we have a word for that.\n\n01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000\nIt's called crazy.\n\n01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:53.000\nBut now the progression is, oh, okay, let's stop calling that crazy.\n\n01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:58.000\nLet's build a society around people being allowed to do that.\n\n01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000\nAnd as people start to do that, you start to dig a little bit more deeper\n\n01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000\ninto just how complex it is.\n\n01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000\nYou and Jeff started to get into this a little bit.\n\n01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000\nYou started talking about Kinsey scale and stuff.\n\n01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:10.000\nYou're starting to recognize that, so you can have this continuum\n\n01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:14.000\nfrom male to female, when people can sit in between somewhere\n\n01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000\non how they identify, but also how they present,\n\n01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.000\nand what their biology is, what's their physiology,\n\n01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000\nwhat is their genetics.\n\n01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:27.000\nEvery one of those aspects has a sliding scale.\n\n01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000\nRight.\n\n01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000\nNobody is at either end.\n\n01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.000\nAnd not only do you not sit at a particular point in any of those scales,\n\n01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000\nyou have ranges, and those ranges change with time,\n\n01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000\nand they interact with each other.\n\n01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000\nAnd that's just the gender identity part of it, or the physiology.\n\n01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000\nThen you have the whole sexual side of it as well.\n\n01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000\nAre you attracted to men?\n\n01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:46.000\nAre you attracted to women?\n\n01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.000\nAre you attracted to both?\n\n01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.000\nAre you attracted to neither?\n\n01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.000\nAre you attracted to people who are particularly somewhere sitting in between?\n\n01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.000\nYou have the whole idea of pansexuality or asexuality,\n\n01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.000\nand all these variables, you can stack them up in this hyperspatial,\n\n01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.000\nand I've developed one of these, I'm a scientist,\n\n01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:09.000\nand you can hyperspatially map a person's sexual gender physiological identity,\n\n01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.000\nand you find out, God, we are fucking complex.\n\n01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000\nYeah, imagine we would be.\n\n01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000\nHow is society going to deal with that?\n\n01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000\nIn 15 years, you'll be able to, because I see video games,\n\n01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.000\nwhere I can choose to be a man or a woman or something in between.\n\n01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000\nLike, right now, you can still hit a binary switch,\n\n01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:29.000\nand you go, ah, I'll be a female, but I'll be a plant creature.\n\n01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000\nMakes the code a lot more simple.\n\n01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.000\nLike, the code will break those barriers down,\n\n01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000\nand video games will just be like,\n\n01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000\nwell, do you want to have feminine characteristics,\n\n01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000\nor what does that mean?\n\n01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000\nThat's also a dichotomy.\n\n01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000\nMy point being that in terms of simulation,\n\n01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000\nwe always look forward to simulation.\n\n01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.000\n20 years from now, you're going to put a USB,\n\n01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.000\nI'm sure that standard will still remain.\n\n01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:57.000\nYou're going to put a key chain plug in the back of your head,\n\n01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:00.000\nand for six hours, if you have six hours to spare,\n\n01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:05.000\nyou're going to get to know what it feels like to be an adolescent octopus.\n\n01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000\nLike, you're not going to,\n\n01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000\nand you're going to come out of that experience\n\n01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:13.000\nand having totally fucking loved and lost as a female octopus,\n\n01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:17.000\nadolescent octopus, and, you know,\n\n01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.000\nyou're going to go back to work and take over banks and stuff,\n\n01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.000\nbut you're going to be like, fuck, I miss Stacy.\n\n01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.000\nAnd your wife's going to be like, what were you doing?\n\n01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000\nNo, I was playing, you know, Tomb Raider.\n\n01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:37.000\nBut if we are afforded the opportunity,\n\n01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:42.000\nand I think Thailand stands in evidence of this,\n\n01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000\nif we are afforded the opportunity,\n\n01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000\nwe will do a lot of fucked up shit.\n\n01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000\nLike, tourists will check into a hotel,\n\n01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.000\nand they will explore different avenues,\n\n01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:55.000\nand they will bend different things.\n\n01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:58.000\nWe structure our civilization on, like,\n\n01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000\ndo I have too much moonshine?\n\n01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000\nIs that what I'm talking about?\n\n01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000\nWhat did Thailand do wrong?\n\n01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000\nThailand didn't do anything wrong.\n\n01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000\nI'm sorry, Thailand.\n\n01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000\nI've never been there.\n\n01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000\nI was playing on a joke.\n\n01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000\nI thought we would get a laugh.\n\n01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:23.000\nIt seems as clear...\n\n01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000\nWell, he makes it.\n\n01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:30.000\nIt's like a bee drinking honey.\n\n01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000\nLike, big deal.\n\n01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:37.000\nBut it seems as clear as it should have been\n\n01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.000\nto people who are making their money off of vinyl\n\n01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:45.000\nthat MP3s were a thing, that sexuality is more complicated\n\n01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000\nthan a dichotomy.\n\n01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000\nIt seems that clear.\n\n01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.000\nThat doesn't mean that anyone should get over their hangups,\n\n01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000\nbut it definitely does seem like it's like,\n\n01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000\noh, we're going to have to get used to the bit-torrenting\n\n01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.000\nof sexuality.\n\n01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.000\nWe're going to have to accept that, like,\n\n01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:04.000\nit is a four-dimensional, like, Tesseract.\n\n01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000\nIt's like...\n\n01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:10.000\nSo I'm turning 50 with me, Bob, or the old people.\n\n01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.000\nCongratulations.\n\n01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000\nThank you.\n\n01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.000\nBut I have a lot of hope from the kids.\n\n01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.000\nI mean, I see that it's just becoming more and more common,\n\n01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000\na lot more fluid.\n\n01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.000\nIt's not everywhere, and it depends upon where you live,\n\n01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000\nbut it's a creeping thing.\n\n01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000\nIt'll keep moving forward, I think,\n\n01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:34.000\nand people just see people like me, people like...\n\n01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000\nDrew Paul?\n\n01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000\nWell, maybe a little...\n\n01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.000\nNo, absolutely, though.\n\n01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000\nChesbono, I mean, there's just a lot of people\n\n01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.000\nwho are coming...

interesting point, which is,\n\n01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.000\naren't old people necessarily worse people\n\n01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000\nthan young people?\n\n01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000\nYeah, that is a good point.\n\n01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000\nI mean, that's...\n\n01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000\nBecause if we keep getting more progressive\n\n01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000\nand accepting and more ethical,\n\n01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.000\nthen that means that we were less that.\n\n01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000\nWell, we were bound by...\n\n01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.000\nSo my grandma

--> 01:41:15.000\nI will pay 200 U.S. dollars.\n\n01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000\nHe's not fucking joking.\n\n01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000\nHe hates his grandma.\n\n01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000\nShe's crazy.\n\n01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000\nSomething that you don't know about Sprenger,\n\n01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000\nhe fucking hates all old people.\n\n01:41:23.000 -->

interested,\n\n01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.000\nand not that you represent\n\n01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:16.000\nthe entire community or something,\n\n01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:19.000\nand I'm going to sound super naive right now.\n\n01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000\nYou wouldn't sound worse than Jeff did\n\n01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.000\nback in episodes.\n\n01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000\nBut I'm wondering like,\n\n01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000\nmaybe you guys talked about it,\n\n01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000\nbut Jared Leto's performance\n\n01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000\nin Dallas Buyer's club\n\n01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:32.000\nseemed to get criticized by the community.\n\n01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.000\nDo you have anything?\n\n01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.000\nI haven't seen that.\n\n01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000\nOh, okay.\n\n01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:36.000\nWas it too,\n\n01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.000\nlike Queenie or,\n\n01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000\nI think I saw that movie.\n\n01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.000\nI mean,\n\n01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.000\nbut what do I know?\n\n01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.000\nBut I mean,\n\n01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.000\nit didn't bother me.\n\n01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:44.000\nI didn't call.\n\n01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:45.000\nYou don't know what problem\n\n01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:46.000\nthey had with it.\n\n01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.000\nWell,\n\n01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:48.000\nI felt like he performed,\n\n01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.000\nand I felt like he was a dude.\n\n01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000\nI felt he was playing a human being.\n\n01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:54.000\nI didn't think it was kitsch\n\n01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.000\nor over the top,\n\n01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.000\nbut maybe that's,\n\n01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000\nmaybe the people who had a problem with it\n\n01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:59.000\ndon't hang out with the...\n\n01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.000\nWell,\n\n01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000\nI'm hearing a lot of good stuff.\n\n01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000\nI've just seen some clips online.\n\n01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.000\nI haven't actually seen\n\n01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:06.000\nan episode of Jeffrey Tambor's\n\n01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.000\nperformance in,\n\n01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:08.000\nyeah,\n\n01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.000\nin Transparent.\n\n01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.000\nSo it's a new...\n\n01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:11.000\nBut it's weird.\n\n01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.000\nIt's like,\n\n01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000\nanytime there's a group\n\n01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.000\nthat starts to get\n\n01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.000\nrespect,\n\n01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000\nthere's so much infighting.\n\n01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:18.000\nWell, there's a...\n\n01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.000\nThere's ever the very...\n\n01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.000\nIt's the group thing, right?\n\n01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.000\nYeah.\n\n01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.000\nI mean,\n\n01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:23.000\nwhen you have something as complex\n\n01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.000\nas transgenderism,\n\n01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.000\ntranssexuality,\n\n01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.000\ntransgender identity,\n\n01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.000\ngenerally,\n\n01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000\nyou're going to draw your Venn diagram\n\n01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.000\na lot of different ways.\n\n01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.000\nYeah.\n\n01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000\nAnd I understand that\n\n01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.000\nthe complaint is,\n\n01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.000\nwhy didn't you hire\n\n01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.000\na real transgender person,\n\n01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.000\nbut the reality of it\n\n01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.000\nis that wouldn't have gotten\n\n01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000\nmade that movie without it.\n\n01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000\nAnd what is a real transgender person?\n\n01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:42.000\nYeah, what is that?\n\n01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.000\nThere's a lot of...\n\n01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.000\nWhat is that?\n\n01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:45.000\nSo, right.\n\n01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.000\nSo, I mean,\n\n01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:47.000\nI identify as female.\n\n01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000\nI am...\n\n01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:53.000\nI identify as pansexual.\n\n01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000\nI have a male body,\n\n01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:56.000\nmostly,\n\n01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.000\nat the moment,\n\n01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000\nbut I am taking female hormones.\n\n01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000\nI have a male genetic structure,\n\n01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.000\nas far as I know.\n\n01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.000\nI have no idea\n\n01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.000\nwhat my epigenetic structure is\n\n01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000\nor the structure of my brain.\n\n01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000\nAll these things are mixing together,\n\n01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.000\nand since the age of 12,\n\n01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000\nhave been sort of moving to be toward\n\n01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000\nsomething where I stand here now,\n\n01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:16.000\nas I know some people who would say\n\n01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:19.000\nthat when they get to this point\n\n01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000\nwhere your body is a certain way\n\n01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000\nand your mind is essentially\n\n01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:26.000\npoisoned by male hormones\n\n01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:27.000\nfor 40 years,\n\n01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.000\nbut you're actually a female\n\n01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000\nthat just manifested differently.\n\n01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000\nSo, the fascinating thing about\n\n01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000\ntransgenderism,\n\n01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:35.000\nis that an ism?\n\n01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.000\nThat'll do.\n\n01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:40.000\nIs the idea that what we're talking about\n\n01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:43.000\nis release from a dichotomy.\n\n01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000\nWe're talking largely about\n\n01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.000\ntranscendence of dichotomy.\n\n01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.000\nAnd yet, there is so much focus,\n\n01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:56.000\nI guess, by necessity on dichotomy.\n\n01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:59.000\nNecessity within the context of the culture.\n\n01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:00.000\nRight.\n\n01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000\nWhen I was a kid,\n\n01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000\nwe had Boy George and we had Prince,\n\n01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000\nand I have no idea what was going on with them.\n\n01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.000\nBoy George was my hero.\n\n01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000\nI knew that my parents\n\n01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000\nwere upset about them.\n\n01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000\nAnd the reason they were upset\n\n01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000\nis because my dad couldn't figure out\n\n01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000\nif they were a boy or a girl.\n\n01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000\nAnd in fact, the heavy metal guys\n\n01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000\nwere wearing mascara and stuff.\n\n01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:24.000\nAndrogyny was a form of rebellion,\n\n01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:28.000\nbut it was all in service of dichotomy.\n\n01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000\nIt seems to me like the dichotomy\n\n01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.000\nis the enemy, isn't it?\n\n01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000\nIsn't the idea that you're either\n\n01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000\na man or a woman the actual bad guy?\n\n01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:38.000\nWell, it's a matter of comfort.\n\n01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000\nSociety has a certain comfort level\n\n01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000\nand a certain energy level that's necessary\n\n01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:46.000\nto maintain its structure and its forward momentum.\n\n01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.000\nComplexity makes that worse.\n\n01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000\nAnd when you start acknowledging complexity,\n\n01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000\na culture begins to say,\n\n01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000\nI need systems to deal with this.\n\n01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000\nI need more pigeonholes.\n\n01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000\nI need more bins.\n\n01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.000\nI need more bits in my bites.\n\n01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.000\nAnd that takes energy and takes time\n\n01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:08.000\nuntil people begin to then sort of relax back from it\n\n01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.000\nand say the answer isn't more pigeonholes.\n\n01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:14.000\nThe answer is just more acceptance of individuals.\n\n01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000\nYeah, I always feel like...\n\n01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:20.000\nDon't give him applause.\n\n01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000\nThat's my applause.\n\n01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000\nI created the form, but now I'm kidding.\n\n01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000\nI always feel like...\n\n01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:29.000\nThe big difference is as we progress,\n\n01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000\nthere's always two...\n\n01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.000\nThere's the progress that lowers barriers,\n\n01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000\nthat makes walls that used to be there stop existing.\n\n01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.000\nAnd those are really scary to people.\n\n01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000\nAnd then there's militant versions of the progress\n\n01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.000\nthat actually raise new walls.\n\n01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000\nAnd I'm always very suspicious of them.\n\n01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000\nThey're like, why are you telling me\n\n01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:54.000\nthat from now on I have to do this or that?\n\n01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000\nThe fear is on both sides, right?\n\n01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:01.000\nYou're going through life with this sort of a situation like I have.\n\n01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000\nYou get very defensive.\n\n01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:06.000\nYeah, because you're trying to protect your own system.\n\n01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000\nI could appreciate that.\n\n01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:12.000\nAnd across all those different spectrums I was talking about,\n\n01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.000\neach one of those subgroups has their own groups,\n\n01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000\ntheir own barriers, their own protections.\n\n01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000\nIt's incredibly difficult.\n\n01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:23.000\nI always feel like you can feel the nails across the chalkboard.\n\n01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000\nWhen we have a transgender person on stage,\n\n01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000\nor anyone that addresses the subject,\n\n01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.000\nI always feel like unlike if you talk about race or class or gender,\n\n01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:35.000\nyou can feel like the confusion.\n\n01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000\nYou can feel the nails on the chalkboard.\n\n01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000\nYou can hear in an audience of 200 people,\n\n01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:42.000\nyou can hear one person popping up over there and over there,\n\n01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000\nand then they're gone like, that's nuts.\n\n01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:49.000\nBut you pointed out before about when Levi was up on stage.\n\n01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:52.000\nBecause Levi's a very fucking specific dude.\n\n01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.000\nRight.\n\n01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:54.000\nHe had the mustache.\n\n01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:58.000\nHe was talking about how he was owning the male physiology.\n\n01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:03.000\nAnd he was saying, in Los Angeles in 2014,\n\n01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:06.000\nthat meant he was an ambassador of transgenderism.\n\n01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:09.000\nAnd so there were people in the back of the room.\n\n01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.000\nWhy aren't you effininate?\n\n01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000\nWhy aren't you just like bullying?\n\n01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000\nIt's like, oh, where's your makeup?\n\n01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.000\nWhere's your dress?\n\n01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000\nIt's like, oh, okay.\n\n01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.000\nBut right now, so I'm presenting fairly male.\n\n01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000\nI have on women's pants.\n\n01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.000\nNice.\n\n01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000\nI have on androgynous chucks, which I've always worn.\n\n01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.000\nAll right.\n\n01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:28.000\nI'm rocking my feral audio t-shirt.\n\n01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000\nNow you're making me question my sexuality.\n\n01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:31.000\nWell, you should be.\n\n01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000\nWhat's similar to me?\n\n01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:37.000\n40% of your wardrobe is apparently female.\n\n01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:40.000\nBut it's how I'm feeling.\n\n01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.000\nI'm going to reach a point in my life where I'm going to present\n\n01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000\nobviously female all the time.\n\n01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000\nI'm going to legally.\n\n01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000\nYou heard it here first folks.\n\n01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:51.000\nI'm going to change my name to Jane.\n\n01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000\nWhat, no, so is that your goal?\n\n01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.000\nI mean, I feel like this could be a three hour podcast.\n\n01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000\nIs it different goals for different people?\n\n01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000\nThat is part of the dichotomy.\n\n01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:06.000\nThere is a point where you will be like, I have arrived at a place.\n\n01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000\nYou will be a...\n\n01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:12.000\nWell, I am arriving at a place every single fucking day, believe me.\n\n01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:16.000\nAnd what I will do is I will arrive at a place where I'll say,\n\n01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:20.000\nokay, for the good of the people who I have to associate with\n\n01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:24.000\nbecause of my professional life, because of my family life, whatever,\n\n01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:29.000\nI need to put a stake in the ground for everyone else's comfort\n\n01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:32.000\nbecause I'm a nice person and I understand that I need to exist.\n\n01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:35.000\nI'm not going to be the militant outsider my whole life.\n\n01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:38.000\nSo I'm going to say, okay, for everybody else,\n\n01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:41.000\npreferred gender pronoun is now female.\n\n01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:45.000\nThe name is Jane and I'm going to be wearing a dress\n\n01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000\nand I'm going to be wanting to use the women's bathroom.\n\n01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:52.000\nAnd that just becomes, okay, that legally, socially, whatever,\n\n01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000\nthat's a stake in the ground.\n\n01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:57.000\nBut that's not something that any transgender person has to do\n\n01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:01.000\nbecause they have no obligations in society to do anything.\n\n01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000\nThey're just trying to believe me.\n\n01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000\nI mean, I'm 50 and I'm just taking these steps\n\n01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:09.000\nand I've known since I was 10 or 11 that something was fucked up.\n\n01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:12.000\nIt's taken me this long to get my life to a point\n\n01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:15.000\nwhere I can just be up here on this stage.\n\n01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.000\nIs that why you dedicated most of your life to creating a substance\n\n01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000\nthat would fuck other people up?\n\n01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000\nYes, absolutely.\n\n01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:25.000\nYou're like a Marvel super villain.\n\n01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.000\nWell, none of them will know what's going on.\n\n01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:29.000\nA poisoning woman.\n\n01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000\nThey will all wake up every morning,\n\n01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:34.000\nwondering what they did last night, who they were,\n\n01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:38.000\nI am androgyne max.\n\n01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:42.000\nIt's funny because Dr. Horrible is one of my big heroes.\n\n01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:46.000\nI think you should stay up here.\n\n01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:50.000\nWhen I was a kid, I was in a dress a lot.\n\n01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000\nAnd it wasn't for the comedy.\n\n01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:56.000\nIt was truly like I felt comfortable.\n\n01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.000\nAnd when you were like at a high school function\n\n01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:04.000\nand you show up in a skirt, not a kilt, just a skirt,\n\n01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:07.000\nit couldn't be a bigger fuck you to the football team.\n\n01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:10.000\nIt would be like, hey, how you doing?\n\n01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000\nAnd it would be like, it was really beautiful.\n\n01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000\nI used to wear skirts when I used to work on the show\n\n01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000\nand happily ever after on tape night.\n\n01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:19.000\nBecause when they would go, please welcome your audience.\n\n01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:22.000\nAnd it'd be Marines would be the audience.\n\n01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.000\nAnd then I'd come out and they'd be like, yeah.\n\n01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:28.000\nAnd one day when my daughter was really little,\n\n01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000\nshe was about eight, I woke her up and she goes,\n\n01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:31.000\ndad, where'd you get that sweater?\n\n01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.000\nI go, oh, it's new.\n\n01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.000\nShe goes, it would go so well with your brown skirt.\n\n01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:39.000\nBut the reason I did it was it would be really comfortable.\n\n01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000\nAnd it's such a fuck you.\n\n01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:44.000\nYou're not like, if you were on the set of community\n\n01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:49.000\nand you show up in a skirt, you're like, I'm the fucking guy.\n\n01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000\nGo fuck yourself.\n\n01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000\nI think they would actually be like, oh, good.\n\n01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.000\nNow we have a label for what's wrong with you.\n\n01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:58.000\nBecause otherwise it's just why is it\n\n01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:01.000\nfree and beautiful way to like squirt your musk?\n\n01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.000\nYeah, I know.\n\n01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000\nI mean, anything is, yeah.\n\n01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000\nI think everybody should.\n\n01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:10.000\nThe way I can access it is let's get out of dichotomies.\n\n01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:13.000\nLet's get away from it has to be this or that.\n\n01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000\nThat's what I can understand.\n\n01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:19.000\nBut in thinking that, that's just me,\n\n01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:22.000\na guy that exists within a very specific dichotomy,\n\n01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:25.000\nthat's going like, well, world without dichotomies.\n\n01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:26.000\nBoy, oh boy.\n\n01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000\nThere are people who want.\n\n01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:31.000\nThat's why I was obsessing about that dichotomy thing.\n\n01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:32.000\nIt was like, well, yeah.\n\n01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:35.000\nBut a lot of people, it actually is about going from one side\n\n01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:40.000\nof the fence to the other, like specifically,\n\n01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.000\neven though to a person who exists on either side\n\n01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000\nof that fence, that person might be a hero\n\n01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000\nby virtue of their transcendence.\n\n01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000\nThey actually are making a journey\n\n01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:53.000\nand they want to arrive somewhere and create stability\n\n01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000\nand be something.\n\n01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000\nThat to me is the confusing thing,\n\n01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000\nbecause I don't want to offend anybody\n\n01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000\nby assuming that about them.\n\n01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000\nI don't want to look at somebody and go like,\n\n01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:06.000\nwell, you can't wait to be a woman, can you?\n\n01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:10.000\nIt's like, maybe you're something other than that.\n\n01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:13.000\nThat doesn't, but if that were your goal,\n\n01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000\nI would love to get behind it.\n\n01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000\nAnd again, I don't want to say,\n\n01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.000\nI just can't speak for the entire trans community,\n\n01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000\nbecause it's humongous.\n\n01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000\nBut I think in general,\n\n01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:27.000\nmy experience has been that most trans folk\n\n01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:31.000\nare actually very understanding\n\n01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000\nof what's called the cis-gendered community,\n\n01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000\nthe people whose gender aligns.\n\n01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000\nI'm offended by that phrase, by the way.\n\n01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000\nYes, yes.\n\n01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000\nI'm starting that movement fairly.\n\n01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000\nThe anti-cis.\n\n01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.000\nBecause we get what it's like to be misunderstood,\n\n01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:48.000\nand if you've waited a long time,\n\n01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:53.000\njust to have someone take the time to ask,\n\n01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:54.000\nit's always better,\n\n01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.000\nwhat would you like your preferred gender pronoun to be?\n\n01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000\nHow would you like me to address you?\n\n01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:02.000\nWhich restroom would you like to be using?\n\n01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:05.000\nShall I open the door for you or will you open it for me?\n\n01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:10.000\nAll these sorts of identity things that society demands,\n\n01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000\nask about them.\n\n01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:16.000\nTrans people will love the fact that you care enough to ask.\n\n01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000\nTo be the devil's advocate,\n\n01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:21.000\na lot of people in this room would love to be constantly asked\n\n01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000\nabout all their fucking bullshit.\n\n01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:26.000\nBut everybody wants to be a fucking rockstar.\n\n01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:31.000\nRight, but if trans folk put themselves out\n\n01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:34.000\nreally in the gun sites constantly,\n\n01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:38.000\nand more so than a lot of hidden issues,\n\n01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:41.000\nbut it's more for your benefit,\n\n01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:44.000\nfor other people who aren't trans,\n\n01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000\ngo ahead and ask.\n\n01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000\nIf you're uncomfortable, ask.\n\n01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000\nIf you're not uncomfortable, don't worry about it.\n\n01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000\nIn the past, social movements,\n\n01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000\nprogressive movements have been about people\n\n01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:57.000\nwho have been shut out actively,\n\n01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:58.000\npeople who are like,\n\n01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:03.000\nyou're black, you can therefore not come into this room,\n\n01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:07.000\nand progress has been indicated by people going from saying,\n\n01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000\nI will beat you up if you come in here,\n\n01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000\nto stopping doing that,\n\n01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:14.000\nto no longer doing things\n\n01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:17.000\nthat they were actively doing because of hatred,\n\n01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:21.000\ndropping things, lowering walls, stopping things.\n\n01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:24.000\nAnd I think the transgender movement,\n\n01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:27.000\nthe part that I understand about it\n\n01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:32.000\nis people saying, drop your gender consciousness.\n\n01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:33.000\nDrop it.\n\n01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:37.000\nStop thinking about men and women as being different things.\n\n01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:41.000\nThat's where feminism and nerdism and blackism\n\n01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:46.000\nand LGBTs and every other alphabet letter,\n\n01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000\nthey all intersect there.\n\n01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:52.000\nIt can all stop thinking about the person\n\n01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:56.000\nthat you're looking at as being anything other than a person.\n\n01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:57.000\nThat person stops.\n\n01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.000\nGet to know that person.\n\n01:59:58.000 --> 01:59:59.000\nLet the boundaries drop.\n\n01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:02.000\nThe things that I don't get are the movements\n\n02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000\nthat involve new rules.\n\n02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:10.000\nMy 41-year-old road comic quills are going to go,\n\n02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:13.000\nI ain't learning no new rules.\n\n02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:16.000\nI will definitely learn to stop doing more shit.\n\n02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:17.000\nAbsolutely.\n\n02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000\nI jumped aboard.\n\n02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:22.000\nAs soon as I found out that anyone\n\n02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000\nhad a problem with gay people, I was like,\n\n02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000\nI am so on board, it's crazy.\n\n02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000\nYou know why?\n\n02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:31.000\nIt's the easiest way to be progressive in the world.\n\n02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000\nDon't hate them.\n\n02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:37.000\nAll you have to do is give less of a shit about more people.\n\n02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:38.000\nAbsolutely.\n\n02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:42.000\nAll you have to do is stop caring about even more people.\n\n02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:43.000\nIt's fucking great.\n\n02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:47.000\nMy parents had to bother to dedicate a section of their brain\n\n02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.000\nto keeping gay people from doing shit.\n\n02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:53.000\nWhat a dumb waste of fucking time.\n\n02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000\nA Minecraft to play.\n\n02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000\nI'm a fucking advocate.\n\n02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:58.000\nGet married.\n\n02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:01.000\nDo whatever the fuck you want.\n\n02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000\nIt's easy.\n\n02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000\nBoundaries coming down.\n\n02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000\nI think that's what Irish people, Jewish people,\n\n02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000\nblack people, that's all they ever wanted was,\n\n02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.000\ncan you stop noticing that I'm black?\n\n02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:18.000\nThe tough thing is, in a culture in America,\n\n02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:21.000\ndown south as we call it up here,\n\n02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:24.000\nwhere we truly, it's fucking noteworthy\n\n02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:27.000\nthat our progress is like,\n\n02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:31.000\nblack men got the vote before white women.\n\n02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:37.000\nWe respected people that we regarded as property\n\n02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:40.000\nenough to say, yes, you should also have a say\n\n02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:43.000\nin who's president, and then sometime later,\n\n02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:47.000\nwomen got the right to also be counted on that.\n\n02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:51.000\nThat is why I think the trans thing is like,\n\n02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000\nit's like, holy fuck.\n\n02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:57.000\nIt's not because we don't respect people\n\n02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000\nfor moving from one side to the other.\n\n02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000\nIt's because we don't know the fuck we were thinking\n\n02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000\nin the first place about men and women.\n\n02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:04.000\nIt was a tough road.\n\n02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:05.000\nWe have no idea.\n\n02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:06.000\nWe're just barely going to...\n\n02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000\nAnyways, too much earth shine.\n\n02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:09.000\nYou haven't drank anything.\n\n02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:12.000\nI only had a couple of quarts of this.\n\n02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:15.000\nIf you told me we were up here for six hours,\n\n02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:16.000\nI believe you.\n\n02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000\nYeah, I think we're over two hours.\n\n02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:19.000\nNo, no.\n\n02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:20.000\nLet's go to the toad board.\n\n02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000\nI'm 100% sure I'm pretty...\n\n02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000\nWhat does that mean?\n\n02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000\nThat's the time it currently is.\n\n02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000\nThat's not helpful unless we know when we started.\n\n02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000\nHow long have we been up here?\n\n02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:31.000\nAlmost two hours.\n\n02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:32.000\nTwo hours?\n\n02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:33.000\nAlright.\n\n02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000\nHow do we end this show?\n\n02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000\nD&D.\n\n02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:43.000\nAlright, let's very quickly find a woman.\n\n02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000\nSomeone who identifies as a woman.\n\n02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:46.000\nWhat?\n\n02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.000\nGenetic woman?\n\n02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:52.000\nLet's take the one in the front because we got no time to waste.\n\n02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:59.000\nAnd by the one, I don't mean that you're an object.\n\n02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:00.000\nWhat's your name, young lady?\n\n02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:01.000\nI'm Jillian.\n\n02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:02.000\nJillian?\n\n02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:03.000\nAlright.\n\n02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:06.000\nOkay, let's get the show on the road.\n\n02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:09.000\nI don't know.\n\n02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:10.000\nI love Toronto.\n\n02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.000\nI fucking...\n\n02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:12.000\nI could be up here for seven hours.\n\n02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:13.000\nI don't care.\n\n02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:16.000\nThere you go then.\n\n02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000\nOh, thank you.\n\n02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:21.000\nWho's going to be whom?\n\n02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:24.000\nLet's just see how the dice, you know, roll.\n\n02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:28.000\nWell, I would assume that Goldthwaite should play Quark.\n\n02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000\nThat's Jeff's character.\n\n02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000\nI'll play Sharpie.\n\n02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000\nI appear to be dignity.\n\n02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000\nChris de Burgh.\n\n02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000\nAnd you should be Jillian.\n\n02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000\nYou're my fiancé, Mulraine.\n\n02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:44.000\nOr, well, Diggity Star's Garden of Hell.\n\n02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:50.000\nWe're going to start doing this song called The Trans Woman in Lavender.\n\n02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:51.000\nAlright.\n\n02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:55.000\nLet's break down those color barriers too.\n\n02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000\nI'm not going to get music, right?\n\n02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:58.000\nI mean, I don't need it.\n\n02:03:58.000 --> 02:03:59.000\nI just want to know now.\n\n02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.000\nWhat?\n\n02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:01.000\nWhat do you want to know?\n\n02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:02.000\nI'm not going to get music, right?\n\n02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:03.000\nOh, fuck no, man.\n\n02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.000\nThat's all I asked.\n\n02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.000\nI don't...\n\n02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:10.000\nThat's fucking America, dude, where we have missiles pointed at whoever doesn't play music.\n\n02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:11.000\nAlright.\n\n02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.000\nWell, uh...\n\n02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000\nBut if you cut your finger here...\n\n02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:15.000\nGet a new finger.\n\n02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:16.000\nYeah.\n\n02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:17.000\nWow.\n\n02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000\nAlright.\n\n02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:24.000\nPut on by a beaver.\n\n02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:27.000\nSo, acapella then.\n\n02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:32.000\nWhen we last met, our heroes had just finished dispatching Father Tinder,\n\n02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:35.000\nwho after murdering the Dharma household,\n\n02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000\ncalled upon the evil might of the Shard of Power,\n\n02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:40.000\nand was transformed into a massive monster.\n\n02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000\nBut despite his demonic new form,\n\n02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:45.000\nteamwork still managed to win the day.\n\n02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:48.000\nBut left with Father Tinder's shattered corpse,\n\n02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000\nour gang was looking pretty suspicious,\n\n02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:51.000\nand when the cops came,\n\n02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:55.000\nDiggity lied to the guard while our friends escaped.\n\n02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000\nAfter trying to figure out what was going on,\n\n02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000\nthe gang found and interrogated Spizzbulb,\n\n02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:02.000\nwho was very defensive towards Sharpie's questioning.\n\n02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000\nBut then everybody calmed down,\n\n02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:07.000\nand in the lull, Sharpie and Diggity ran out into the street\n\n02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000\nand got hit by a horse-drawn carriage.\n\n02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:10.000\nOh.\n\n02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:11.000\nWas that cannon?\n\n02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:12.000\nYeah.\n\n02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:13.000\nYeah.\n\n02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000\nThey got knocked down.\n\n02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000\nWill they get back up again?\n\n02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:20.000\nIs anything ever gonna keep them down?\n\n02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:23.000\nFind out on an all-new Pulse Pounding episode.\n\n02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:32.000\nGive it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up.\n\n02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:33.000\nSo, okay.\n\n02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:37.000\nYou guys, you two are lying in the street face up.\n\n02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:41.000\nYour consciousness slowly, slowly comes back to you,\n\n02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:44.000\nand you don't know what happens, or what happened.\n\n02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:45.000\nYou're talking about all of us?\n\n02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000\nJust the two of you that were hit by a horse-drawn carriage.\n\n02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:48.000\nMe, me, and...\n\n02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:51.000\nWhen I'm doing the music for you, I'm not listening.\n\n02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:55.000\nNo, I mean, when you're not doing the music for me, you're not listening.\n\n02:05:55.000 --> 02:06:02.000\nAlso, when I'm sober and or have had a court of some weird...\n\n02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:03.000\nEarthshine.\n\n02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:04.000\nYeah.\n\n02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:05.000\nSome miraculous earthshine.\n\n02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:08.000\nYeah, so you got hit by a fucking horse-drawn carriage.\n\n02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:09.000\nI did.\n\n02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.000\nYou two farther away from me.\n\n02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:11.000\nYou see this happen.\n\n02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:12.000\nReact.\n\n02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000\nOh, no.\n\n02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:17.000\nWhy did you do that?\n\n02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:18.000\nWhat just happened?\n\n02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:22.000\nI hope our good friends are okay.\n\n02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:26.000\nI'm going to run over and check on them, and drag them out of the street.\n\n02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:29.000\nActually, I'll drag them out of the street so they don't get run over again.\n\n02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000\nI'm going to say that's successful, because I don't have my dice out.\n\n02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:34.000\nI'm going to watch.\n\n02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000\nDoes this village have universal health care?\n\n02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000\nGive this guy some dice for God's sake, Toronto.\n\n02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:39.000\nHow do they give it?\n\n02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:40.000\nHe has it.\n\n02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:41.000\nHe saves.\n\n02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:42.000\nThere's no clerics.\n\n02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:43.000\nYou got socialized medicine?\n\n02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:44.000\nYou don't have dice?\n\n02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:45.000\nNo, I have them.\n\n02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:46.000\nThey were just in my bag.\n\n02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:47.000\nSorry, I didn't mean to berate you.\n\n02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:48.000\nI didn't feel you were berating me.\n\n02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:49.000\nI thought that was great.\n\n02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:50.000\nNo, I was talking to them.\n\n02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:51.000\nI didn't feel like you were berating them.\n\n02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000\nI thought that was great.\n\n02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:58.000\nAll right, you pull them out of the street.\n\n02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000\nYou guys are injured pretty badly.\n\n02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000\nA couple of your ribs are broken.\n\n02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:03.000\nOw.\n\n02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:04.000\nAccurate.\n\n02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:05.000\nOw.\n\n02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:06.000\nOw.\n\n02:07:06.000 -->

adventurous.\n\n02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:02.000\nSpeaking of adventurous, you hear yet again a very familiar sound that you've heard not long ago.\n\n02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:05.000\nIt sounds like a police siren.\n\n02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.000\nWee-wee, wee-wee, wee-wee.\n\n02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:09.000\nIt's Borat.\n\n02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:10.000\nBorat's coming.\n\n02:09:10.000 -->

them.\n\n02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:18.000\nYou sure did.\n\n02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.000\nOh, shit.\n\n02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:22.000\nWell, I wish I didn't eat my wee.\n\n02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:26.000\nWe should get out of town.\n\n02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:33.000\nThe whole thing is going on, though, with Admiral Darkstar in the angel body being repelled by...\n\n02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000\nDoes anybody else remember this dark election?\n\n02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:38.000\nWhere do you think we should go?\n\n02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:44.000\nI'm serious because, honestly, the last couple weeks have been a mess.\n\n02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000\nYou've been listening.\n\n02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000\nWhere do you think we should go?\n\n02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:49.000\nAir City.\n\n02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:52.000\nYeah, we were supposed to be trying to get to the Air City because...\n\n02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000\nWhy were we going to the Air City again?\n\n02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:57.000\nBecause that's where the robot baby was going to get his memories back.\n\n02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000\nRight, it was the robot baby quest.\n\n02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:00.000\nSo we should get out of town.\n\n02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000\nNo, we should try to get outside.\n\n02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:05.000\nYeah, this whole thing was a bad turn.\n\n02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.000\nDignity.\n\n02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000\nAdmiral Darkstar's guide.\n\n02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:09.000\nI know you work here.\n\n02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:13.000\nI know you've been with us only a short time, but we would appreciate your help getting out of town.\n\n02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:14.000\nI can help with that.\n\n02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:15.000\nGreat.\n\n02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:16.000\nShe has a horse.\n\n02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000\nLet's take my horse.\n\n02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000\nLet's get out of town.\n\n02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:23.000\nDo we all fit on it?\n\n02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:26.000\nHow many people usually fit on the horse?\n\n02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000\nDon't tell them the truth.\n\n02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000\nThe truth will punish you.\n\n02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:33.000\nLike, what's the max capacity of a horse?\n\n02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000\nIt's too comfortably.\n\n02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:36.000\nPalomino?\n\n02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:37.000\nA luxury Palomino?\n\n02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000\nNo, a regular one is like nine.\n\n02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000\nIs a Clydesdale a horse?\n\n02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.000\nYes.\n\n02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:45.000\nYou could fit all of us on a Clydesdale.\n\n02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000\nThat's a stretch limo.\n\n02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000\nNo, I know Quirk's halfling.\n\n02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000\nI know he's a gnome.\n\n02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000\nNo, seriously, I don't know.\n\n02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:54.000\nTwo people.\n\n02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:57.000\nNo, I think you can all fit uncomfortably.\n\n02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:00.000\nAlright, it's not a joke.\n\n02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000\nCan we get out of town?\n\n02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:05.000\nCan we get through the gates?\n\n02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:08.000\nYeah, you ride towards the gates\n\n02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.000\nand you see crowds of city guards\n\n02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000\nkind of blocking your way.\n\n02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000\nYou're going to have to run something over or something.\n\n02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000\nStep on the gas.\n\n02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:20.000\nJust a hazard style.\n\n02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000\nLet's do it.\n\n02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000\nAlright, you step on the gas\n\n02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:27.000\nand head forward with great speed.\n\n02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000\nYou knock down three of the guards\n\n02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:32.000\nbut then you go through the barrier\n\n02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:33.000\nas if it wasn't even there\n\n02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000\nand blast out of the city gates.\n\n02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000\nThis is a metaphor for transgender.\n\n02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:38.000\nAbsolutely.\n\n02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:39.000\nI'm loving this.\n\n02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:40.000\nI don't want this lost on you.\n\n02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000\nNo, no, no, this is great.\n\n02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000\nOnward, onward.\n\n02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000\nOnward.\n\n02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000\nYeah, we're free.\n\n02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000\nWe're free of the city.\n\n02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000\nThat's what you wanted to do.\n\n02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000\nDid we lose the police?\n\n02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000\nThey're standing at the gates just watching you.\n\n02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000\nYou don't want to go out.\n\n02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000\nDid Admiral Darkstar notice that?\n\n02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000\nYeah, you quickly realize why.\n\n02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000\nThere's a large angel demon\n\n02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:07.000\nwho's now bearing down on you at incredible speeds.\n\n02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000\nAh, cheese and crackers.\n\n02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000\nBearing down on you.\n\n02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000\nAdmiral Darkstar.\n\n02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000\nYeeah!\n\n02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000\nYou're never going to catch us.\n\n02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000\nAnd that's a fact.\n\n02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000\nIs it?\n\n02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000\nNice.\n\n02:12:28.000 -->

problem,\n\n02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000\nbecause we signaled...\n\n02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000\nIs that Cannon?\n\n02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000\nYeah, yeah, he says that.\n\n02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000\nI'm going to murder you!\n\n02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000\nAll right, that's one thing we could do.\n\n02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000\nListen.\n\n02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000\nAdmiral

talked.\n\n02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000\nIt was a really dysfunctional home.\n\n02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000\nThat was evident.\n\n02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000\nI don't think\n\n02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000\nthat your goals\n\n02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000\nconflict with ours anymore.\n\n02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000\nI disagree!\n\n02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000\nWhy two

field, and you can see\n\n02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000\nthe skeletons, they're kind of climbing up\n\n02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000\non the top of the force field,\n\n02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000\nand they gather all around this shard\n\n02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000\nand in a crack of light, all of them\n\n02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000\ndisappear all at once.\n\n02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000\nAnd Admiral Darkstar is like,\n\n02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000\nWhat the fuck?\n\n02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000\nYou!\n\n02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000\nI'm coming for

02:17:30.000\nSo how bad does this horse have to piss?\n\n02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000\nUh,\n\n02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000\nas bad as a racehorse.\n\n02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000\nAll right.\n\n02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000\nSo do your best.\n\n02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000\nFiery figure.\n\n02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000\nYou command the horse to piss\n\n02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000\nand it's a well-trained mount, so it does.\n\n02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000\nIt pisses on the fiery leg\n\n02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000\nand knocks out one of its legs\n\n02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000\nfor a short amount of time.\n\n02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000\nIt falls and stumbles to the ground, prone.\n\n02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000\nWhere are you from?\n\n02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000\nLet's get out of here.\n\n02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000\nI mean, what's, you know...\n\n02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000\nEnough battles.\n\n02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000\nWhat better way to express how we feel\n\n02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000\nthan to leave?\n\n02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000\nTo piss on the leg and leave.\n\n02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000\nBecause, again,\n\n02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000\nwe're saying,\n\n02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000\nwe own you.\n\n02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000\nYou own yourself.\n\n02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000\nGood luck on your adventures\n\n02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000\nwith one leg.\n\n02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000\nAnd so to us.\n\n02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000\nAll right.\n\n02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000\nSo on a horse, you can easily outpace\n\n02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000\na one-legged fire elemental.\n\n02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000\nAnd you've ride\n\n02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000\nand you ride until you find\n\n02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000\nwhat's the only light\n\n02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000\nin this dark place.\n\n02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000\nIt looks like it's coming from a hill,\n\n02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000\nlike a hill with a light.\n\n02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000\nWe didn't have one moment to just celebrate.\n\n02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000\nWe fucking nailed it.\n\n02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000\nYou left.\n\n02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000\nWe just walked away.\n\n02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000\nThis is why Judges and Dragons is better than a video game.\n\n02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000\nWe didn't have to stay there.\n\n02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000\nWe just left.\n\n02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000\nHe didn't expect us to do that.\n\n02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000\nI didn't not expect that.\n\n02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000\nHe's got to deal with it now.\n\n02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000\nBut he respects it because he's a good dungeon master.\n\n02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000\nWe just left.\n\n02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000\nThat's what I wanted to hear.\n\n02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000\nI am a good dungeon master.\n\n02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000\nI don't know if we broke character to just do that.\n\n02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000\nNo, we didn't.\n\n02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000\nTo me, it's the most in-character I've ever ridden.\n\n02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000\nI'm a coward.\n\n02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000\nI don't want to die. I hate fighting.\n\n02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000\nIt hurts me.\n\n02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000\nIt's a weird quality for an adventurer.\n\n02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000\nYou're always been a reluctant adventurer.\n\n02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000\nIt's fine.\n\n02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000\nAdventurers come in various shapes.\n\n02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000\nHave you ever seen me play a video game\n\n02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000\nor heard me talk about one?\n\n02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000\nJust Minecraft.\n\n02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000\nI hide behind corners.\n\n02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000\nI try to build up my stealth skill\n\n02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000\nto the point where I'm functionally invisible\n\n02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000\nand I can cheat.\n\n02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000\nYou'd make a great rogue.\n\n02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000\nAnd I'm a wizard.\n\n02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000\nIt's a shame.\n\n02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000\nI played rogues my whole life.\n\n02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000\nDo you feel like a rogue inside?\n\n02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000\nI identify as a rogue.\n\n02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000\nMaybe you should continue to sort of transition\n\n02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000\ninto a cross-class sort of situation.\n\n02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000\nI identify as a rogue.\n\n02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000\nMaybe it's Christopher.\n\n02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000\nI could help you with your transitioning.\n\n02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000\nWe are tasting the fruits\n\n02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000\nof our amazing decision\n\n02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000\nto walk away from all this bullshit.\n\n02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000\nAnd you ride up to a large hill\n\n02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000\nthat has a lit window in the hill,\n\n02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000\ninside of the hill.\n\n02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:20.000\nIt's like a hobbit-hole kind of situation.\n\n02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000\nThat's what she said.\n\n02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000\nSorry.\n\n02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000\nI hope you come back\n\n02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000\nfor another show, Bob.\n\n02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000\nSorry about that.\n\n02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000\nWhat do you think we should do?\n\n02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000\nI'm going to boldly go up\n\n02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000\nand look into this window.\n\n02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000\nYou see a woman showering.\n\n02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000\nWe get rewarded for everything this show.\n\n02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000\nThis is Toronto.\n\n02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000\nLook at this woman.\n\n02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000\nAnd she's clean.\n\n02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000\nIt's true.\n\n02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000\nAre you going to invite the rest of us\n\n02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000\nto see what you're seeing?\n\n02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000\nHey, guys, nothing to see back here.\n\n02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000\nThe home's empty.\n\n02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000\nAll right.\n\n02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000\nI...\n\n02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000\nWe're in a village?\n\n02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000\nNo, this is the only dwelling\n\n02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000\nthat you see that looks anything like this.\n\n02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000\nThere are some rolling hills\n\n02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000\naround, but nothing like that.\n\n02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000\nWell, I guess I go up to the door and knock on it.\n\n02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000\nYou guys should just move on without me.\n\n02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000\nI'm serious.\n\n02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000\nI'm just going to knock on the door\n\n02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000\nand see if there's anything in my home.\n\n02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000\nYou knock on the door,\n\n02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000\nand there's no answer\n\n02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000\nas if someone was occupied inside.\n\n02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000\nLike you with the shower, for instance.\n\n02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000\nIt seems like\n\n02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000\nso whoever's in there is either not home\n\n02:21:36.000 -->
