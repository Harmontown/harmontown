WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:26.000
I am Jeff Davis and Harmontown is now in session.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
And please welcome the Mayor of Harmontown, Nan Harmon!

00:32.000 --> 00:44.000
Did you introduce me?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
I didn't hear.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Yeah, I introduced you.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
I based it on the applause.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
Bobcat Goldway, our best controller, Toronto.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
Wow, we got a double-decker, full-packed house here in Toronto.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
At the Bloor Theatre.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Yeah.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
That only shows documentaries.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Is that true, really?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
No.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
People in the audience are going, bullshit, I saw Spider-Man here.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.000
It seems like they secretly show high-profit movies on Thursday at 11pm.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
You gotta know a guy.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
Yeah, that does seem like a weird move in this day and age.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
It seems like a really good commercial platform.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Only showing documentaries.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
They might as well just show my movies and just go completely broke.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
It was awesome!

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
See, that's why I want to kill myself.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
For those listening, I just shout out, police academy is awesome.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
I have made movies in this millennium.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
The guys are yelling out, police academy is awesome.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
I think they're familiar with police academy as maybe like a color form?

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
Well, they're rebooting them.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
They're going to do what they did to Jump Street.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
They're going to make them a comedy this time.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
They're just going to have modern comedy stars.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
Nick Offerman as Steve Gutenberg.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
That sounds delightful.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Are they rebooting them?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Yeah, they are rebooting them.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
What in the world?

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Just call it cop comedy.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Dude, a new one.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
There's purists who get upset.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
They go, oh, really?

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
I was in two, three, and four.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Your character became a cop.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Your character was a criminal in the first one.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
And then he was a cop in the second one.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Apparently at the Metropolitan Police Department, they don't have very stringent.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
That was the whole idea, baby.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
Yeah, apparently I went to Batman Jail, where I was out in a week.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
The two of them I was in was up here in Toronto.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
It seems like a nice city.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
It feels gothamy here a little bit.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
When we were making police academy, we would have to dirty the streets.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
So it looked like America.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
This is the truth.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
And people would come by and clean.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Like they would pick up the trash.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Get out of here, Canadian! Get out! Get out!

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
There's Canadians infesting the film stuff.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
They keep picking up the litter.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Put down that Tim Horton's cup.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
We put it there on purpose.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Yeah, so they would actually do that.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Canadians.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
You know, I had the quintessential Canadian experience on the way here.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
And there's a lot of cliches that are true.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
And you guys are friendlier and a little bit nicer.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
And just deal with it.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
I mean, you're snarky too.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
I know what you say behind our backs.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
No, they will argue with you about anything.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Yeah, they don't tip.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
They go, we're not nice.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
You don't hate me, do you?

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
So I see this guy on a moped when I was walking here to the theatre.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
And he gets cut off and almost creamed.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
He's almost hit by this Prius.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
And so he catches up with the Prius and he hits the window.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
And I'm like, oh, this is good.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
This is going to go.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
It's on.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
And the guy looks at the other guy.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
And the guy on the moped looks at him.

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
And then he really angrily waves at him.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Hello.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Hi.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Like, have you noticed me?

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
What was the effort there to give the finger?

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
It would have just been bending three fingers.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
And he's just...

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
That would hurt me more, though, wouldn't you, as a driver?

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
I'd be like, God, that guy...

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Absolutely.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
In rare moments in my life, I've experienced...

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
I've done it right just on accident, really, because I was trying to be so sarcastic.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
And the other person was so nice.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
I remember having instances in traffic where someone's honking at me angrily.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
It makes me...

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
It puts my ire up.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
And then I would look over at them, make eye contact with them,

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
and do this big show of like...

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
Like, fully expecting you to get shot for it.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
But then the person in the other car would just start laughing.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
That guy doesn't mug me aggressively.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
Yeah, maybe we should all be doing comedy in this moment.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
What is my problem?

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
I got re-rendered on the 101 during, like, where traffic was at all stop.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
And this guy gets out, and here's a Mexican gentleman, and it was his truck.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
And we go to exchange each other's insurance.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
And then he hands me his license, and it says it was suspended, that his license was suspended.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
And then I go, dude, just forget it, my car's fine.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
And he starts crying, and he hugs me.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
And unlike you, I'm not cool with the hugs.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Unlike me.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Well, all these big...

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
I don't know, man.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
What is your target audience?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
We love bears.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
It's 600 hours of footage of that movie.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Like, I hugged eight people.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Yeah, we should say there was a screening this evening.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
And by the way, I love the movie. It was really wonderful.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Oh, yeah, I'm glad you liked it. It's very flattering.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
It was very sweet and funny, and everything I want in a movie.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
Ah, that's nice. I know you would tell me otherwise, I think.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
I mean, not that you're...

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
I would just say, hey, that was good.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Yeah, you would be polite, but I would know that you didn't like it.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
And I could tell you saw some merit in it.

06:27.000 --> 06:34.000
Of course, I sat next to you and I was laughing, and I was worried that my laugh sounded like Max Cady in the Cape Fear remake, you know.

06:34.000 --> 06:41.000
I fell asleep because I'm 41, and not because the movie's boring, but because I just...

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
I don't know, I had some of these Mill Street loggers.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Do you want me to tell you how it ends?

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
No, no, I know it is. That's the fact that guy sucks his thumb and says he's not going to change.

06:51.000 --> 06:59.000
But yeah, I woke up to people laughing, and I thought they were laughing at me snoring, and I was like, hey, make a movie about that.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
But yeah, what is that Canadian...

07:02.000 --> 07:08.000
I think in America, are we socialized to compartmentalize to the point where we become psychotic?

07:08.000 --> 07:15.000
Are we trained? Do people in Canada, because as a region...

07:15.000 --> 07:22.000
I don't even know... Do you guys... Does Canada really consider itself to be a country?

07:22.000 --> 07:29.000
Or do you guys really think about it in terms of like, nah, this is, you know, this is my province.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
This is my, you know, because it's different from wherever you go.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
Just say America in front of a Canadian, they'll correct you.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
This is North America.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
We're all American.

07:40.000 --> 07:48.000
There's a whole chunk of everything. Really? Because on the news, when they say America bombed someone today, you don't go, us or them, I'm not sure.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
But no, I just want to make sure I wasn't asking in a demeaning way, because I think that would be one part of the enlightened thing.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
It's like, why be jingoistic about a big giant swath of land?

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
Well, but they do. It feels like Canadian is a little more civic in their mindset.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Sure, sure.

08:04.000 --> 08:11.000
No, I mean, perhaps they're a little kinder to their brothers, but they've also got the most fucked up political system going.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
No, but I mean, I mean, the top four to come on.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
They're focused on, they're focused on shit that matters.

08:19.000 --> 08:27.000
Maybe that's the only other shit that gets back to us, but it's not like, there is no such thing as like a, you know, Canada really stirred things up at the UN today.

08:27.000 --> 08:36.000
You know, it's like, you know, America continues to rattle its saber on this like global scale.

08:36.000 --> 08:43.000
So that's the only reason why you would have a reason to think of yourself as an American as opposed to perhaps a person from Portland or Milwaukee or Los Angeles,

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
which is what really matters. The key difference is what kind of, what way is the traffic going?

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
Does your city have a rail system? Does your city, how does it spend its money?

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
You know, it's like, it comes down to a civic level.

08:57.000 --> 09:07.000
But I was thinking about this, because both of us grew up not far from Canada and the same kind of weather and the same kind of, you know...

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Focus on humility.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
Shame and oppressive religion.

09:13.000 --> 09:22.000
But I don't know why, because I grew up in Syracuse, nice to come up to Toronto. It was like going to Paris, you know, I mean, it was like...

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
Yeah, the east side of Milwaukee. It was like, wow, they really...

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
These people are very bougie.

09:29.000 --> 09:37.000
I used to come up here to Hitchhike with Tom Kenny up here to see Second City and stuff when we were teenagers.

09:37.000 --> 09:44.000
Yeah, when you get into the airport, you feel a very, I don't know, it has a weird futuristic, like a 90s future feel.

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
I was like suddenly finding myself, I don't think I was that drunk, but I was like...

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
I wanted to go pitch William Gibson-like stuff.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
I was like, Toronto, 2028.

09:56.000 --> 10:03.000
It's just, you know, in the 90s you're going, wow, they're still hanging out at this grunge and you're going, oh no, it's cold. That's why they're flying.

10:03.000 --> 10:09.000
It's cold, yeah. I think that's what it is. It's coldness and sophistication makes you...

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Because I started craving Manhattan's. I was drinking a lot of bourbon today.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
I was like, why am I not... Why? Why am I doing that?

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Oh, because I'm not in a desert.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
But it does have politics and its own craziness and stuff.

10:19.000 --> 10:27.000
It's just that part of growing up in the US, we're not aware of other countries, even the two closest to us, you know what I mean?

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
It's our arrogance.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
It just seems like too much to take on.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
Well, have you been spending much time in Quebec?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Have you?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
No, are there other troubles there?

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
Well, when you use English, they're going, do I hate you because you're American or from Ontario?

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
Like, they have to figure out why they hate you before they give you a rotten attitude.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Yeah, they have their own thing up here.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
Speaking of weird things, this is something that...

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
There's something called Nuit Blanche happening right now.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Yeah.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
Which people are tweeting me about and I immediately assumed it was racist.

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
I assumed that it was Pagan and probably racist.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
But I think it's just sort of a silver-lakey kind of artist thing.

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
It's an all-night, seven-to-seven art festival and they do installations all around the city.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
All right, high-roaded.

11:19.000 --> 11:29.000
But at the same time, I heard some of the installations from last year and I was like, oh, that sounds great.

11:29.000 --> 11:36.000
Everybody got together and they made a waterfall and a building.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
All right.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
What was that?

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
It was cool. That's what it was.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
What's the literal translation of Nuit Blanche?

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
White night?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Okay, see, that's why I thought...

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
In America, that sounds like crystal knots.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
It sounds like time for some justice.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
We got 24 hours to purge.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Nuit Blanche, motherfucker.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
Don't forget your real uppity right now, Mr. Keb Driver.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
But tomorrow's Nuit Blanche.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Come say, come say, mother of under.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
We stay away from white night in the south.

12:23.000 --> 12:29.000
We went to Scotland and you were in Scotland at the same time as me and we didn't look each other up.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
The hot-mini thing with the torches.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
We were like, it was fucking great. We were all walking around the torches.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
We can't do that here. We can't do it in America.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
We turned fire racist.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
That's hard work.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
America works hard at racism. You're welcome.

12:45.000 --> 12:51.000
We fucking figured out how to make racism fucking fundamental.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
Well, you couldn't do it in the States because everybody would be suing each other.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Yeah, that's the other thing.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
The post-racial America is now a...

12:59.000 --> 13:05.000
I was watching in Hogmanay, it's 5,000 people with torches walking through Edinburgh and I'm like,

13:05.000 --> 13:11.000
what do they do when they accidentally set each other on fire and someone goes, put them out.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
And I witnessed it. I saw some people.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
There's like little kids and they started to go up in flames and then the parent would pack them out.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Just like cavemen.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Let's give a baby a torch.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
There's seven billion pieces of evidence that that's a fine system.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
We didn't go extinct from burning to death.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
Well, and there's a lot of drinking too.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
Everyone's drunk and there's wicker everywhere.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
You don't know if the superintendent's inside the wicker thing.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
You figure he'll scream if he starts to burn.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
That's kind of where I was hoping it was going.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
I thought it was going to be wicker, man.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
It was. It very much was.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
That's what I was hoping to eat Blanche would be.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
You and I would end up in a tea kettle made out of sticks.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
The bees, the God damn bees.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
So have you been brought to us?

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
So will you be brought a room to the boot?

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
I was trying to think of a way to Canadian pronunciation to a pagan ritual.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
You are a boot to go forth into the.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Sorry.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
All right. Sorry.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
They say sorry so much.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
They say sorry.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
I'm mispronouncing it, but you know, when you watch to grassy, they say sorry.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Every other word.

14:28.000 --> 14:35.000
It's like a nation of Chippendales after you know, after you, after you cousin.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
There's a sleeping giant though.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
They're just getting ready to kick our ass.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
That'd be fantastic.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Canada is like that.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
That should be.

14:44.000 --> 14:50.000
We should send Canada to the moon because they would be able to operate there.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
They'd be like, we understand.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
We're orbiting something disgusting.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Like we get it.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
We have limited resources.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
We can make it work.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Okay.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
We wear a parka or now it's a space helmet.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
I'm fine with that.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
We're still a colony.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Fine.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
We'll humor you there.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
And then like 30 years later, they were like psych.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
Moon bombs.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
Canadian moon bombs.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
Do you think they're just happy to be not part of England?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Is that why they're polite?

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Aren't they still kind of though?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Yeah, you are.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
That's where I get cocky.

15:30.000 --> 15:36.000
When we have political arguments and like my Canadian friends go like, yeah, but you guys,

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
you got to get your shit together.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
I'm like, fuck you fucking England fuckers.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
But you fucking grow some fuckers.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
I really thought you weren't part of the, did you guys get a chance to vote?

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
And you said, no, we're scared.

15:48.000 --> 15:54.000
They just, you know, that car broke down and they're like, well, let's just live here.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Who cares?

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
I mean, at this point, you can't do it.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
It's like legalizing heroin.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Like what are you going to do?

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
How are you going to, what are you going to be an independent Scotland and an independent Canada?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
I mean, how's that even going to work?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Who fucking cares?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
It's all bureaucracy.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
I didn't realize it was going to get so heavy, man.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
I was here to talk about the police academy.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
You got to do that shit in the 1700s.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Do it in the 1700s.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
You fucked up.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
You got to cut some heads off.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Look at me.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Look what you could have been.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
Look at the pride.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Look at the culture you could have had.

16:32.000 --> 16:37.000
USA, USA, USA.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
I mean, yeah, growing up in Wisconsin is essentially you are Canadian.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
There's no difference.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
But back when I was a kid, you could walk across the border, probably, I think.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
I'm assuming.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
I'm assuming.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Yeah, we could.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
And where I grew up, not the same accent, but kind of the same.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
You know, where they drop the T's.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
They just drop the N.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Hey, Bob, you know, I saw you there on HBO.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Like they don't pronounce the whole.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Right.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
You don't waste a lot of time opening your mouth a lot.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
No.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Like in Wisconsin, you talk through your nose.

17:07.000 --> 17:12.000
So in order to make sure that certain salons are different from others, you got to make sure that.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
I could say that I was almost a Canadian because in my high school yearbook,

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
you can count how many kids died from snowmobile fatalities.

17:20.000 --> 17:26.000
You know, they are, you know, a steamwise orc there.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
You know, he didn't even see the Bob wire there.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
You know.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
In a land where snowmobile.

17:38.000 --> 17:46.000
People don't even go, Hey, you know, we should make some paths or we should instill some laws.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
Why don't you just put tires on the goddamn things?

17:50.000 --> 17:56.000
We're going to lose a couple, you know, I'm getting out my notepad.

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
I'm going to look at my look at my ever note notepad to see if there's anything we need to talk about tonight.

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
There was a guy in the LA LAX Maple Leaf Lounge.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
As you know, Canada is famous for its luxury.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
They have a, they have a, they put a, they're very elitist country.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
They think that people with more money should be treated much better than people with less money.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
So as you can imagine their, their luxury lounge, that's the thing that pisses me off.

18:23.000 --> 18:28.000
When I, I get, I get picked up by a car at the airport and the guy was like not, you know,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
he was being too practical for me.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
And I wanted to like, I could recognize that all of my American blood cells are screaming out like,

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
what are you fucking, don't you understand? I would give you more money.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
What was he being practical about?

18:39.000 --> 18:45.000
He was just like, he's like, he's driving a car that's supposed to pick me up from the airport and drop me off at the hotel.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
But he's making it my problem.

18:47.000 --> 18:53.000
Like, like he wasn't like thinking in advance like, hmm, who am I picking up?

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Who, who will be paying me?

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
I should look into that so that I don't have to do that when I drop him off at the hotel.

19:00.000 --> 19:06.000
So that he's not sitting there like a jackass, like, like, like having an experience that is essentially more difficult than taking a cab.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Well, I took a cab.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
Yeah. I wanted to have taken a cab.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
My story is about how I recognize it.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
Like, like, oh, this is the American in me because there's nothing, there's nothing bad that's happening here.

19:18.000 --> 19:23.000
There's a guy that's denying me my right to elitism.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
That's what the big thing is.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
Did you want him to have a sign and he didn't?

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
I didn't mind the lack of a sign.

19:30.000 --> 19:39.000
But here's the thing, and these are, these are problems that I know you everyday folks can relate to.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
When you go to a new city, you're supposed to call the driver.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
Well, and now this guy has got my phone number.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Well, I don't even say, here's the thing.

19:49.000 --> 19:55.000
Some guy making minimum wage has now got my phone number.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
I don't think you heard what I said.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
No, no, no. It's not that.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
It's just that, you know, there was a time you didn't have to give your phone number to the pizza guy, your cell phone.

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
Well, as you just start now, in Seattle, I had to call, I was like, where's the driver?

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
And then the, they go, oh, you're supposed to call the guy.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
I'm like, well, that's not, so nobody told me that.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
I had to call the guy.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Yeah.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
I'd call a cab.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
I thought the whole, there was supposed to be a tier here, a tier.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Yeah, that would make it easier.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
So then they tell you like, oh yeah, it's one of those airports.

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
You can't, the drivers can't come near the, this is not a conversation to have in front of these people.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
Yeah, they're like, boy, it must be rough.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
I hate it when my limo driver needs my phone number.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
But just fantasizing your head if you could as a person.

20:43.000 --> 20:50.000
It's like, like when you get off that plane that first time you see that guy and it says Harmon on the sign and you're like, I fucking did it.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Mr. Drummond adopted me.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
I'm moving on up.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Yeah.

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
Well, now I'm assuming you travel on the first class.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
I can't, yes.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Okay.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
I can't do anything but.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
But here's the thing.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
I started traveling first class when I was a young man.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Trust me, I don't have any money now.

21:09.000 --> 21:14.000
But when, and I still do because I have five million miles on American airports.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Literally you said you have five million miles.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
I have a card that says that.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
I've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all.

21:19.000 --> 21:28.000
And the thing that's weird is as a younger man, when I got in the line to get on the plane in first class, I was always stopped.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
They would say, this is first class.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
And I'd be like, I'm first class this bitch.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
No, when I go, I'm first class and I'd mumble and be embarrassed.

21:37.000 --> 21:42.000
But I don't know what happened recently where I look like I'm first class is just because I'm old now.

21:42.000 --> 21:49.000
Oldness is like, you can be a grody schlub and if you're old enough, they're like, maybe he invented mustard.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Yeah.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
Maybe it's Stan Lee.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
I don't know.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Let him on.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
He smells like a fish.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
Maybe he caught the first fish.

21:59.000 --> 22:05.000
I was on a flight recently and all these age appropriate women were giving me the big eye.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
What's the big eye?

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
They were flirting.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
They were excited.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Okay, little rascal.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
I'm fifth.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
I'll tell you.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
You got the big eye.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
They were giving me the big eye and I did not like the cut of their jib.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
And I'm like, when did this happen?

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
Because as a young man, I didn't have any women like flirting with me, but now I'm 52.

22:24.000 --> 22:31.000
So like 50 and 60 old women and I'm like, you know, I'm like, I could pull so much steel wool if I wanted to.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
And it's clear.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
I'm like, what is it?

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
It's like, look at him.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
Look at him with those healthy hips, you know.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Look at it.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
I don't even think he...

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Dude, can I talk to you about...

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Put a pit in that for a second.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Because there was a guy in the Maple Leaf lounge.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
It's a luxury.

22:51.000 --> 23:00.000
It combines Canada's fine tradition of providing elitist luxury with America's fine tradition of 56K Wi-Fi speeds.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
So I'm sitting there.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
I'm dying.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
And there's a guy sitting across from me.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
He's got a Bluetooth headset.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
And he kept...

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
I mean, the guy was like doing a character.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
I thought he was like gorilla marketing or...

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
He kept making these phone calls and he was speaking so loud.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
And I'm not one of these people that's like, you know, social...

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
I don't know.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
I don't care.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Like, whatever.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
We live in a new world.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
Like, I know there's people who take a lot of pleasure if they're in a restaurant.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
And they go like, hey, excuse me, could you take your phone call outside?

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
And they get all excited about it.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
And like, I get it.

23:34.000 --> 23:40.000
Like, what are we going to fix the world that's populated by fucking idiots?

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
So this guy was like...

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
But I was like, holy shit, this guy is so loud and so crisp.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
Like, it sounds like David Mamet wrote him.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Yeah.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
And he was just calling.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
I knew his name.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
I knew his social security number.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
Everything because he was like ordering a watch.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
He was calling a guy because he had ordered...

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
He was interested in buying a watch.

24:04.000 --> 24:10.000
And he wanted to call and confirm his appointment to come by and look at watches.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
What the fuck?

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
I hope he called his limo driver.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
So he kept saying stuff.

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
And he kept talking about like the jelly bean face or the Pomona face.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
It was like, no, I don't need the jelly bean face.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
I want the diamonds and the numbers, but not the face.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
But if he could have a couple of options for me...

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Is he trying to impress?

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
Does he come into the Maple Leaf Lounge?

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
And he tries to hook up with Canadian divorcees or something?

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
Is he running some kind of dirty round scoundrels scam?

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
And then he got off the phone for a while and I'm like,

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
thank God, I'm just focused on my Minecraft.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
And then five minutes later he called and I wrote it down.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
I wrote down what he said.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
He said, hi, I have a reservation for a pickup.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
He had a slight accent of indeterminate origin.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
I'm trying to do my best impression of.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
I have a reservation for a pickup.

25:07.000 --> 25:12.000
Yes. Tango Papa Niner.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
Tango Papa Niner?

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
I wrote it down. Tango Papa Niner.

25:18.000 --> 25:25.000
But he had to keep repeating it because I'm sure the person on the other end was like, what?

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
Tango? Oh, tea? Motherfucker, it's not...

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
We're done.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
He skipped right over Tom.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Tango. Yeah, I get it.

25:34.000 --> 25:39.000
The military came up with ways to make sure you only had to give bombing coordinates once

25:39.000 --> 25:44.000
because they were speaking over copper wire in 1941.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
You don't have to say Tango to a fucking Verizon guy.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Tango.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Alright, Tango begins with a T.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
Got it. So T then you fucking...

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
That would have really frosted my cake.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Papa?

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Papa.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
I never heard Papa. What's Papa?

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
He clearly watched a lot of Hogan's Heroes.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Tango Papa Niner.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Papa Bear to Mama Bear.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
Papa Bear to Mama Bear.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
So he wants a Rolex and a pickup. That guy's out there somewhere.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
But I just listen to those guys.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
I just now, I mean, I don't listen like I'm pretending.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
I just turn and go and I chime in.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
I do. It's the quickest way to end it.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
I go, yeah, yeah, get the watch.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
You know what I mean? I do.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
I had a guy in a bathroom stall.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
And...

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Yeah.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
The story we can all relate.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
I was just banging dudes in the bathroom stall.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
No.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
And he gets on the phone in the stall next to me.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
He goes, hey, what are you doing?

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Wait, I'm sorry.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
He's in the stall next to mine.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
And I forget that people are on the phones nonstop.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
And I say, he goes, hey, what are you doing?

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
And I'm like, just crapping, man.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
You know what I mean?

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
And then he continues to talk to the other person.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
I was like, oh my God.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Just crapping, man.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
I was on, and then I was, when I was on the plane,

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
there was a young lady walking down the aisle

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
and she was on the phone.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
And I'm not banging on this young lady.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
I don't think that she's a villain for doing this.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
I just think this is kind of fascinating that she's on the phone

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
and she's getting on the plane and she's walking down the aisle

27:28.000 --> 27:33.000
and she goes, yeah, uh-huh, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Okay, well, I'm getting on the plane right now.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
Okay, yeah, I've become one of those people.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
Yeah, no, I'm literally one of those people.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
She had the most meta-obnoxious phone call.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
She spent more time addressing it.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
She's like, yeah, I'm literally one of those people.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
I know, no, I'm on the plane and I'm talking on the phone.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
People are looking at me like, what?

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
And I'm like, no, I'm not allowed to do that.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
You've taken that away from me.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
This is worse.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Cut your knees right off.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
It's like if ants, if somebody put you down,

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
crotch down naked on fire ant hills

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
in the middle of the desert,

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
and then the ants were like, oh, one of those, huh?

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Oh, I know what you're thinking.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
We're gonna, yeah, well, here we are, we're ants.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
I guess we're gonna eat your crotch now.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
I can't believe we're doing this.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
I guess this guy's like, whoa, fire ants on my crotch.

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
They think to take away my agency?

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
I was walking down a plane,

28:37.000 --> 28:42.000
and I made a movie called God Bless America,

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
and this, I didn't say that for that, but thank you.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
That's very sweet.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
And this kid was watching it on his computer,

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
and I'm like, I'm gonna blow his mind.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
And I tap him on the show, they go, hi, I'm BobCat,

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Bob Goldway, I made that movie,

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
and he goes, I paid for it.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
That's a 100% true story.

29:04.000 --> 29:09.000
Like this kid thinks, I'm going, oh, piracy!

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
He's all of his, now I understand,

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
celebrities based on radio shack commercials.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
He's just like, I gotta go,

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
there's a kid getting on a flight in Burbank,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
and he just downloaded God Bless America,

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
that dirty little prick.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
That's so funny.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
And clearly he didn't, you know what I mean,

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
about how fast it came out.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
I paid for it.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Yeah, he definitely did not pay for it.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
No, he didn't.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Why would you say that if you did?

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
If you have a receipt, you'd be a dick about it.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
He'd be like, what's up?

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Ask me.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
It's a legal download.

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
I woke up, it was on my phone with the YouTube album.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
I love that the corporate, the industry,

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
got their messaging out that much more thoroughly

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
than a filmmaker did.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
YouTube, you probably don't care that much

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
if someone steals your work.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
No, not at all.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
I shouldn't say that for the distributors.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
You can't say that, they won't distribute your work.

30:07.000 --> 30:12.000
But the kid had been, the suits had gotten to him.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
He had watched the Emmys, a guy came out and said,

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
hello, are you enjoying the Emmys?

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
You know what's not enjoyable?

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Emmy theft.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
Hi, like these Grammys?

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Beyonce's gonna starve to death.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Stop stealing music.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Oh, hello, happy Oscars, everybody.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
Pirates are afoot.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
There's so much fucking awareness of Jesus Christ.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
What the fuck, you guys made your empire out of the fact

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
that it's easy for me to watch your dumb, free shit.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Now that it's fucking freer and dumber,

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I'm like an Elma thief.

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
It's also, first of all, thank you for calling my stuff

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
free and dumb.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
No, but as free and dumb as Captain Phillips,

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
maybe you've seen it, it's an important film.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Also free.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Also, what am I gonna do?

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
You know what I mean?

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
It's not like they're watching a Clint Eastwood film

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
and they got busted.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
Well, he's kind of old.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
He wouldn't really do much either.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
But what?

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Clint Eastwood's very old.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
He's quite old and he would have no problem

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
with us saying that.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
And even if he did, what in the hell?

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
What a weird stance to take.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
These guys love Clint Eastwood.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Yeah.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
I guess they're thinking about, well, they're Canadian.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
They're thinking about other people.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
Yeah. Well, you know, don't wake the sleeping giant.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
That's all I'm saying.

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
That'll be the Sarah Hava of World War III.

31:39.000 --> 31:46.000
Remarks about Clint Eastwood, where they've chipped off a new...

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
Canada has been developing a nuclear super weapon.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
They never told anyone about...

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
The Canadian wall preventing Americans.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
I mean, United States citizens.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
All right, so I just wanted to check in with you about...

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
And I haven't talked to you about this backstage

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
because I don't know.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
I didn't want to...

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Do you want to talk about your love life at all?

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Oh.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Is that off limits?

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
No, I have a girlfriend, yes.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
Well, because also, you also...

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
weren't you married?

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I was married.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
It's good it's in that order.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Right.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
I haven't talked to you about that at all.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
You were married the last time I saw you.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Yeah.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Now you have a girlfriend.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Now I have a girlfriend.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
And it's not your ex-wife.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
No.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
Right.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
But, yeah, well, my wife and I split up about a year ago

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
at this time, yeah.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Yeah, you and I don't...

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
What's that? Oh, they got...

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
Yeah, that's a good bit, I guess, to young people.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
I know at Harmon Yacht people participate in the show,

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
but not in the sense of when they try to write comedy.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
Hey, you can connect that to the giraffe thing.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
It'd be a good callback.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
I think...

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Ah, I'm just over here.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
My name's Steven Levy.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
Steven Levy is the name of my assistant.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
I just named a real guy.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
I think...

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
My name's Steven Levy.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
I live in Coimbra.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
Well, Steven Weizlerich actually lived across the street from me

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
earlier that I killed in a snowmobile accident,

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
but still alive.

33:18.000 --> 33:22.000
So, no, he was actually...

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
He wasn't going for a comedy laugh.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
He actually could feel my awkwardness

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
and tried to cut the tension.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Wait, you know, he was going for comedy

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
when he connected your relationship to the guy at the stall.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Bathroom, yeah.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Don't exonerate him.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
I just didn't think we judged here at Harmontown.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
No, we don't.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
You're right.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
Oh, cram it, all of you, you know?

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Okay, no, all right.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
There's a third act of reservoir dogs in here.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Who's judging who?

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
All right, let's all reset.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
I have a problem.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
Well, never mind.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
What?

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
If you have a problem, you should be safe to say it here.

34:01.000 --> 34:05.000
Yeah, I would say I have a problem.

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
You know, in your movie and in your life,

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
it's this nerd love, you know?

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
And, wow, pen could drop right now.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
But I have a problem with a lot of nerd culture

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
and I find them just as intolerant as other cultures.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
And, you know...

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
Whoever yelled out, shut up.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
See, that's a good bit.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Shut up!

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Go blow a guy in the bathroom!

34:33.000 --> 34:38.000
Well, my observation about nerd culture has always been that...

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Or maybe I shouldn't say it about nerd culture.

34:40.000 --> 34:44.000
I think about the individual nerd is that being a nerd,

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
I think, you know, there's a cycle of abuse.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
So you go, like, oh, I'm proud to be a nerd.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
I love being a nerd.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Like, there's a fraternity with other people

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
who you think are abused along with you.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
But there's also, like, this weird, like, reflexive...

34:57.000 --> 35:02.000
Like, if you really gave the average nerd an Iron Man suit,

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
like, I don't know if he'd use it to, like,

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
totally protect everybody.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
I think he'd do some fucked up shit.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
He'd be selective.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
Well, I also think it's like...

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Yeah, I mean, it's just like what happens in...

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Pardon my oldie time speak,

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
but, you know, I just witness a lot of nerds acting just like jocks.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
You know what I mean? Like, they're intolerant and stuff.

35:25.000 --> 35:29.000
But the other thing is, it's like a problem I always had

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
with the Revenge of the Nerds movies.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
The nerds, at the end, are jocks.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
They don't...

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
They have the cheerleaders as girlfriends.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Yeah, they start banning...

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
They had semi-consensual sex with them.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
Yeah.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
And it's clearly designed by studio executives

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
who just assume every nerd would love to be them

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
instead of like, why can't you just be yourself?

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
Sure. And of course, people who cast Anthony...

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
What's his name?

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
Edwards.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
Anthony Edwards and a keratin as nerds, you know,

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
who put prosthetic teeth in their mouths and like...

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
They're like, handsome guys.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
Well, they're in Hollywood.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
They couldn't find a guy with bad teeth.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
But the...

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
Yeah, no, I totally...

36:09.000 --> 36:13.000
I just have a problem with people not being tolerant of others.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
So, you know, sometimes, like, you know,

36:16.000 --> 36:21.000
I just find this kind of nasty nerd culture, you know?

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
I'll go you one better.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
What?

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
And confuse things all the more.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
I'm back-lashing on the recent nerd,

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
genuine nerd backlash culture.

36:30.000 --> 36:35.000
I don't like this whole...

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
I'm a real nerd.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
Everyone's calling themselves a nerd now,

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
so...

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
And I'm a real nerd because I have eczema.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
I'm a...

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
I think that's horse shit.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
I think...

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
I'd like to show you my eczema.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Maybe that's what the old ladies saw on the plane.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
I have a flaky...

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
Do you think that...

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
Is this eczema?

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Will you look?

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Let me see.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
A burn-busting show in Toronto this week, guys.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Show me your eczema.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
I don't know what it is.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
I think it might just be not showering for a month.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
It could be.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
I'm just sort of peeling apart.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
No, it's probably eczema.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
But yeah, I don't know.

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
I feel like, oh, this is separatism, or...

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Well, you're talking about my ex-wife, she would say,

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
I'm not a nerd because I go to Comic-Con.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
I'm a nerd because I complain about Comic-Con.

37:27.000 --> 37:32.000
I mean, I think if you are...

37:32.000 --> 37:37.000
If you are worried that what's in your brain,

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
it shouldn't come out of your mouth,

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
wouldn't get you elected president, you're a nerd.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
And I think if that...

37:44.000 --> 37:48.000
If we end up finding out that 249 million of us are nerds,

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
then we get to walk up to the White House and go,

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
you're out!

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Like, I think that...

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
I feel like sort of like...

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
I don't know.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
I feel like there's a nerd revolution where everyone's like,

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
I'm a nerd too.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
That's the nice thing about the third act of preventing the nerds,

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
is that they go, you know what?

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Come on down here if you think you're a nerd,

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
and being a nerd becomes popular.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Yes, there's irony to that.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
And then you thought you based your career on that?

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Yeah.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
I'm going to be the...

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
I'm going to get so late.

38:15.000 --> 38:19.000
I'm going to be the holding coffee of nerds.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
I don't know.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
I don't know.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
There's a new thing now where it's like,

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
there's people who go like, I'm a real nerd.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
I don't just look cute in glasses.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Like that hipster word.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
The word hipster now.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
It's like we're just working towards a world where hipsters come forward

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
and go, yes, I am a hipster.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
But...

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
I'm tired of being picked on by nerds.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
But when I hear the...

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
I like cool music, alright?

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
It's fine.

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
When I hear people making fun of using hipster as a derogatory term,

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
you know, I'm like...

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
I don't find that threatening, you know?

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
I mean, like, a hipster to me.

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
So, you know, it's not like...

39:04.000 --> 39:08.000
Like you said, I could probably talk to this guy about music, you know?

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
I'm not going to fit in their skinny pants or anything, but, you know...

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
But anytime anybody says anything, it's like,

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
nerd used to really mean it was like, fuck that guy, he's a nerd.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
No, fuck that guy.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
He can't come to our party.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
He's a nerd.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
Right.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
And there's a ton of people in this room that truly do not remember

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
that that actually was the case.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Because I was honestly, like, very...

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
I was totally very young when that changed,

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
because of movies like Revenge of the Nerds.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
It was like, oh, there's this word, nerd.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Like, okay, now it's funny and interesting.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
It's like, you can watch movies that pre-date Revenge of the Nerds.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
The N-word?

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
There's the N-word, yeah.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
The...

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
There's movies...

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
I can say nerd, I am one.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
If you watch...

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Find a movie called Joysticks,

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
which is like this video game exploitation movie.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
It pre-dates Revenge of the Nerds,

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
and it sort of typifies, like,

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
there's other movies, like,

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
where they're in the 80s,

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
but it's before Revenge of the Nerds,

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
and it's like, there is a character with glasses

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
and a pocket protector in the movie,

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
and they do pick on him,

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
but the big difference is the guys picking on him are the heroes.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
Like, and they do just, like, pick on him,

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
and they go like, oh, here comes Stanley.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Hey, Stanley!

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
And he's like, hey, guys, I just thought the calculations suggest

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
a different course of action.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
And they go, yeah, Stanley,

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
why don't you go in the other room?

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
There's a real hot girl in there.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
She wants it, Stanley.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
She really wants it.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
Oh, come on, guys.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
Nobody wants it from Stanley.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
No, she wants it, Stan.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
Get in there.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
But you gotta wear this blindfold, see?

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Or you won't get all of it.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
You want to get it all, Stanley.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
And that's the third act of the movie.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
It's the resolution.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Like, they overcome Stanley.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Like, teach him what a virgin he needs to be

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
by making him fuck a walrus.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
And they, like, high-five each other in their credits roll.

41:07.000 --> 41:12.000
It's like, it's in the way that you fuck with Stanley!

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Fuck that guy!

41:14.000 --> 41:18.000
That's not the plot of Tusk, is it?

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
The revenge of the nerds came out and I was like,

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
okay, now this word nerd, it's sort of,

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
that was the culture that I was sort of born into.

41:26.000 --> 41:31.000
The bottom line is then those word hipster

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
have seen the same thing.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
It's like, you go, stand up comics,

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
they go, like, oh, these fucking hipsters.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
Like, they don't, like, what the fuck does it even mean?

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
What does it mean?

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
They mean 25-year-old, kind of.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
They just, they often mean,

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
I have heard my audience referred to as hipsters

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
and nerds in the same, like, room.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
Like, in two different conversations,

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
I had a bunch of fucking hipsters showed up.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Like, that guy with the leg brace?

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Wow.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
Yeah, I guess that's hip now, since it's hip to be a nerd.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
So I guess he's a fucking hipster.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Let's beat him up!

42:04.000 --> 42:08.000
I used to truly believe that there was,

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
I really recently just changed.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
I used to think that there really wasn't good

42:12.000 --> 42:16.000
and bad in people, that I really felt that there was,

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
we're all flawed, and sometimes we hurt other people,

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
and sometimes we act selfishly,

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
and then other times we rise above it and we don't.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
But I truly now believe that that's not true.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
I really believe there's just good and bad people.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
Shitty people.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
And who lack the ability to empathize, you know?

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
So that's who I really don't have any patience for.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
I would say, in some conversation today,

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
I was saying, talking about...

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
By the way, I'm not on grass.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
You keep doing comics to this, like,

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
oh, the idea that you're doing little rascals, right?

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
What, the way I speak?

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Yeah, yeah, that's the joke.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
You're, like, eating callbacks deep into that,

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
but I think you're...

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
I'm the only one that's, like, noticing those callbacks, like,

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
and it makes me feel like I hurt your feelings when I say that.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
That's the sasperilla's got me nuts.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
I just thought, you said that there were women

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
making big eyes at you, that's it.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
I don't want to, I feel like, because you...

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
Those were some attractive dames.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
I behaved correctly,

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
but I didn't want it up in the who-scout.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
The crowbar motel.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Yeah, I'm a Damon Runyon character.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Were they the bees? The bees' knees?

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Wait, what's your...

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
She's having a conversation.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Were you...

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Was it...

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Oh, jeez and crackers, spit it out.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Talking about, like, oh, there's two teams,

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
but then it was, like, you know, it's, like,

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
ah, damn it, I fucking...

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
I swear to God, I was really eloquent about this today.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
All right.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Oh, it was probably with one of those two

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
interviewers that I talked to.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
I talked to a guy from Dork Shelf

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
and the other guy.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
What was the other publication?

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Publication.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
What was the other fiber optic hologram?

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Toronto.org.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Something.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
I don't know.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
I said some fucking profound shit.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
You can read about it in either Dork Shelf

44:06.000 --> 44:12.000
or EW.CWT.CA.org.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Very disappointed in your internet, by the way.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
None of it on your plane.

44:18.000 --> 44:22.000
And a shitty version in the hi-hat.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Couldn't play...

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Yeah, you're welcome. Thank you.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
As long as I get an apology.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
I've been hearing a lot of shit about American Wi-Fi.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
I haven't seen...

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
I didn't, like, come here and go,

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
fucking Logan's run idyllic paradise.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Like, I checked into the hi-hat

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
and they said,

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
oh, it's complimentary Wi-Fi.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
And I wanted to ask...

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
It's complimentary.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Does that mean it's slow?

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
And I was like, don't be so American.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Like, they have socialized medicine here.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
If you cut your arm off, you're just as entitled

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
to another arm.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
As Bruce Jenner.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
But they did that.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Yeah.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
That's the first, like,

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
richest guy I could think of.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Bruce Jenner.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Who needs an arm really bad.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
He's not even a gentleman anymore.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Yeah.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
No, I'm not being...

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
What?

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Trying to be inclusive.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
I'm very popular

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
with the transgender community.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
I am.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
I did a very pro transgender

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
video that...

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
I was happy.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Explain that.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Well, Bruce Jenner is becoming

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
a woman.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
What?

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
I read it on the teletype.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Wait, I don't know...

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Your mind is blown.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
It's blown.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Yeah.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
From the Wheaties box is now

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
becoming a woman.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
And it's so sad, like, at this point in his life,

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
you know, to waste your whole life

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
not being yourself.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Yes.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
The road comic version of that was going to be...

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
What's the difference?

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Because it was like, you know,

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
sex equating to sexuality, you know.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
When you get to a certain...

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
I'm lost. What would Jeff do right now?

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
No, nothing. I was just...

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
I was just confessing my own.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
When you went down that road, I was like,

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
oh, shit, brace yourself for...

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Because you said, oh, it's such a tragic thing

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
because...

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
What was your zinger?

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
No, it's just like when you're that old,

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
who cares if you're a man or a woman,

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
you're fucking old.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
It doesn't help to explain it.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
I'm so sorry.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
I'm so sorry.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
I guess you get that old

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
fuck yourself. Maybe that's why he went for it.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
I don't know. I mean, there's an asexuality to age

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
that I'm very thankful for.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
I'm 41 and I've finally been released

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
of a certain nine times a day...

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Really?

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
That's what I put a pin in earlier

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
because we were talking about sex and I...

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Well, I had...

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
This is a joke from my nightclub act,

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
but it is a true story.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
So I think that if I say that, it's true.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
But it's about what you're talking about.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
And I was in Miami and this young woman said...

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
She said, if you came home with me,

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
she was flirting.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
So if you came home with me, I'd fuck you all night.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
I'm actually getting quiet telling my story.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
That's funny. Also, that's not flirting.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
That gives you an idea how shitty my self-esteem is.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
What is she trying to say? What is the subtext here?

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
And the idea was like...

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
I was supposed to be like, yeah, but I'm 52.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
I'll fuck you all night.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
It's like...

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
That sounds horrible, young lady.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
I'm about like...

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Three minutes and then we'll watch Children of Men.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
You fuck once.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Maybe I heard that on demand.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Fuck me once, cuddle,

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
and then make me a low-sodium breakfast.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Then it would be on.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Morningstar sausages and omelets

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
made of egg beaters.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
So...

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
It went off like a light for me.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Really?

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Did you feel a dip?

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
I watched the...

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
I don't really watch them, but...

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Do you have a sex drive anymore?

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Just not as much as I did.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
I'm so grateful for it.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
I'm so grateful.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
My next step is I need to channel the

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
much more natural amount of sex drive I have.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
I need to...

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
My mic just drooped.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Did you see it?

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
It really did.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
I guess it's contagious, Dan.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
I mean, I was a slave to this shit.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
It was ridiculous.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
It got in the way of a lot of work.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
It was hard on just driving and traffic.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
I'm glad that's gone.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
I'm so glad that's gone.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
I'll actually see...

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
I'll be on the sidewalk,

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
and I'll look at something

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
and recognize it as something

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
that used to make me have to go back to the

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
hotel and deal with it.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Wow, so...

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
And I'll go like, I don't smoke anymore.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Like...

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
I'm free.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
So I see those Viagra commercials,

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
and I want to go back there.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
What are you...

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Why don't you just play Minecraft?

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
What are you...

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
What are you producing when that's happening?

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Why are you so excited about

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
wanting to come so bad?

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Me?

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
No, no, no, not you.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
I just...

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
I look at those ads with the guy that goes like,

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Hey, so...

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
My dick's not so hard anymore all the time.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
How about you?

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Don't answer. I've only got 30 seconds

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
to tell you about a new pill.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
It's gonna make your dick constantly hard.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Just like when you were 22.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Oh, yeah, feel your dick get hard.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
With dick hardier.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Mmm, ask your pharmacist

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
about dick hardier.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Yeah, it's gonna make your dick nice and hard.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
You're not gonna be able to control your fucking dick again.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
It's gonna be like in the old days

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
when you had no fucking control

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
of your life. When you got nothing done,

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
you just wanted to rub up against every fucking door jam.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
When all women were objects,

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
no matter how smart they were.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
They were reduced

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
to an outfit

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
and a smell.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Like, fucking...

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Bring yourself back to that.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Don't take the fucking

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
kind embrace of time

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
and its invitation across a threshold

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
into possibly being a human being.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Reduce yourself once again.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Take Van Wilder

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
pills.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Be a douchebag.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Like, walk around

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
with a fucking diamond in your pants.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
You're 70.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Satiable, unslakeable diamonds.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
You're 70. It's time to crap out that third family.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Fuck up your second marriage

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
with new dick pill.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Why not?

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Don't worry about the cost of education.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
You'll be dead.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
We could have put this money into

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
making people

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
read more.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
But your dick will be hard.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
You'd die with a hard dick, you old ugly fuck.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
Now you can use your money

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
and your estate to

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
leverage Starbucks baristas.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
But what would you do

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
if your drive dipped even more?

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Would you be... Well, what do you mean even more?

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
I'd get more done.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
There's no limit to it.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
I managed to be able to get things done

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
and rub one out.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
I still rub one out.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
My new goal is

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
turning the rubbing out into...

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
I'd like to throw one to Aaron.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
But...

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
That's my new... That is my honest...

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Me too.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Okay, I now...

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Thing!

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
It's nothing to do!

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Instead of, like,

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
six times a day

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
having a part of my life that's, like,

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
not shared with other people...

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Why don't you have a page count?

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
You say after five pages

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
you get to jerk off.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
What do you mean?

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
When you're writing, isn't that what you're trying to get done?

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Well, yeah, no.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Yes, yes.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
No, that's not a problem anymore.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
I can write for hours now.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Now the problem is that writing is boring.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
It seems to lack a certain...

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
What do you think is missing from it?

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
I don't know.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
It's as if the characters want something

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
that they'll never have again.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Or...

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
There's no point to writing anything at all.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
We've got to climb

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
this pointy monument.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
It's like there's a bunch of people

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
standing around with no purpose

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
in their lives.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Their god has no more reason

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
to animate them because...

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
It's like King of the Hill.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Just everyone standing there talking about

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
something.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Do you...

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
I'm happy that

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
my sex drive has diminished some,

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
but I don't want it to diminish more.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
No, I would not want mine to

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
diminishing more.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
I knew we were going to talk about this.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
It's like the oil

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
in the menorah lamp.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Now it's like...

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Yes, now it's magic stuff.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
It's a miracle.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
My boner's in the window.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Now...

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Now in those rare moments...

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Yeah, now if I

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
pleasure myself, I'm actually...

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
There's a lot of sadness to it.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Like extra sadness.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Like is it guilt or because you're going to go to sleep

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
and not get anything done?

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
Well, no, because I'm like, oh, dammit.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
One of these every three days now.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
I could have given this to Erin.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
That's the new sadness.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
I am so glad you guys are in therapy.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
That sounds really sad.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Well, that's all on me.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
You go, oh, I wasted a boner.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
I could have had sex with my fiancée.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Yeah.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Well, because now I know,

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
because I'm a workaholic and a...

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
I used to be like...

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
I have a question about your workaholicism

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
and...

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
No, because...

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
No, I don't get a lot done.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Don't ask me that. Don't make me kill myself.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
No, no, I was really trying to figure out

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
the difference between you and I.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Because we're both driven.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
I mean, I don't think that's a bad thing.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
We both, you know, after World's Greatest Dad

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
I wrote 11 screenplays, you know?

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
So I do work, you know,

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
but...

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
I, you know,

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
your form of

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
mental illness

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
is so much more lucrative than mine.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
I was really brazing myself for it.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
No, no, because I think it's amazing.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
I don't understand how you can even,

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
you know, people, you know, the movie,

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
and you view yourself destructive and stuff,

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
but you still

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
can get hired by these people.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
I mean, I don't try to because I know...

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
That's on them. That's their fault.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
I do everything I can to be un-hireable.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
I got notes once on one of my movies

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
and we had a German Shepherd in the

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
editing bay and I took the notes,

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
put peanut butter on it, gave it to the dog,

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
took a picture of it and sent it to the guy who gave me the notes.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
That's the only notes I ever got

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
on any of my movies.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
But then again, most people don't even know I make movies, you know.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Well, here's the crazy thing.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
This is the thing that I don't understand.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
This is the thing that makes me iconoclastic,

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
is that you can do that, you can react that way,

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
or you can do what I do,

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
which believe it or not,

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
and no one fucking believes it,

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
and it's in the goddamn movie,

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
is I sit there and I go,

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
okay, all right, got it, got it, got it.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
I write it all down, I address every fucking note,

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
I give it back to him, it doesn't matter.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
German shepherd photo,

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
diligence.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
If you're going to end up with a reputation

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
that's being difficult to work with,

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
I don't know, it's based on something else.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Your cheekbones, your body weight,

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
your fucking tone of your voice,

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
your blog where you say you're difficult to work with,

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
I don't know.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
But don't you, when you get notes,

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
aren't you frustrated by that process?

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
I'm not, because I don't think that TV is

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
art.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
I think that TV is commerce.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
I'm really passionate about it.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
I'm very passionate.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
I want to make the best TV show I possibly can,

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
but I also like...

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
But when these knuckleheads give you notes

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
that are making it...

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
I look at that as like the way that you would look

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
at a paintbrush if it was like,

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
if the paintbrush in your hand

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
argued with you.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
If you want to be something other than

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
a painter, in this metaphor,

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
painting is just TV,

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
so there's no way to paint without...

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
part of the medium.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Working through knuckleheads,

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
like if you're a photographer,

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
you need a camera. You can't just

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
show up at a gallery and say,

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
I saw this homeless lady,

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
and I pictured it in black and white.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Well, that is what's going on tonight,

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
all around, tomorrow.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
It probably is. There's probably something happening.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
And I support it.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
I absolutely support it.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Just 7 a.m. Oh, tell me about it.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
She was missing a shoe again.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Photography, you involve a device,

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
and you involve light,

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
and used to be film development,

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
and now it's just whatever, ones and zeros.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
But in any case, there's always

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
a limitation that defines the

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
medium. In television, it's commerce.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Right. It's the limitation that defines the medium.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
You are selling Snickers bars.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
That is the beauty of it.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
I grew up on it. Some of us actually

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
have been on Snickers commercials.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
The people

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
don't say the F word. They don't

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
rip their tops open and say,

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
look at my giant tits.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
We'll be right back.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
That would be cheating.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Personally, I think a lot of techniques...

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
That's not in any of my movies.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
I wasn't talking about you.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
But I don't know if it's my own fear

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
of being judged on a bigger level,

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
or it's not that.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
It's just I don't have that much interest

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
to play the game.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
But you don't have to anymore.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
The thing about you is that you are

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
a tiny bit older than me.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Tiny bit to the point where you are

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
one of the huge reasons

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
why I moved from Milwaukee to L.A.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
because I saw you at the comedy cafe

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
and you were post

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
police academy screeching guy

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
and you came up and did a set

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
where you were more than willing to do

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
funny jokes that were in your stand-up set

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
and then sometimes people would yell stuff out

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
and go like, do the voice!

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
And you'd be like, hey, what's your name?

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
And you were engaging with them

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
and you were just saying insightful things.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
You bridged the gap between

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
being a professional entertainer

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
and actually being a present human being on stage.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
And Rob Schrab and I were standing in the back of the room

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
with zits on our faces

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
and lollipops in our hands.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
And we were like, holy shit!

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
The fucking guy from police academy

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
is the bomb!

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
And we talked to you afterwards.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
We used to say things were the bomb back then.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
I also had a yin yang

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
on my acid wash denim jacket

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
and a rat tail

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
because I pattered myself after

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
e-gun from the real Ghostbusters cartoon.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
And we came up to you afterwards

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
and we were like, holy shit, that was really inspirational.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
And you said, yeah, what are you guys going to do?

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
And we were like, we're going to move to LA.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
And you said, don't move to LA.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Don't, don't, don't do it, don't do it.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
And then we were like, well, that's what he's supposed to say.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Well, let's be like him.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Let's do what he doesn't think we should do.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
We moved to LA.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
And you, like, time has changed.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Everything has changed.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
You need to have a fucking podcast

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
because you make a fucking oof of movies.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
And the one thing that they all have in common

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
is your point of view.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
You should be a cult of personality.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
You should be having movies made about you.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
You should be...

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
I'm committing crimes

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
that you could be getting away with very easily.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
That's really sweet.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
I didn't let any of it in.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Um...

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
I'm also a little nervous

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
about giving away so much of myself.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Don't you, don't you feel that that's, that's weird?

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Like, don't you ever feel like

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
what you make is what you, you know...

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
I think if you, you do watch the movies

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
that make you get a better idea how I see the world

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
than, than if you hung out with me maybe.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
I don't know, I'm very nervous about giving away

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
my, my personal life.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Well, that's a huge, I think that is a huge, like, key.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
I, I am not, like, I think that's what defines me.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
It's like, I'm totally, like,

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
once you get to the bottom of the barrel,

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
the way you scrape is like, there's nothing there.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
It's like, oh, this barrel

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
thanks you for being a part of scraping it.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Like, I, I'm not,

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I, I think you are a more genuine person than me.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
I think you actually do have

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
opinions that you wouldn't back off

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
of if a mob of people screamed enough at you.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Like, I think you do,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
I look up to you for that reason.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I think you have a voice and a, and a point of view.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I think that you're,

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
but that's the stuff that you,

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
you don't give it away by sharing it.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
You don't give it away on top of it,

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
and the wind wafts in,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
and nowadays people come in,

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
and if they want it, they get it.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
You can charge them a dollar for it,

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
and if they don't like it,

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
you can tell them to go fuck themselves.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
It's amazing.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
It's like, it's not like when we were younger.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
It's a whole crazy world.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
It's like, you could, you could,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
it's like no money down.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
You could create a whole cult of personality.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
People could be crucifying you in five years.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
And I think, I think,

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
I don't know.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
My ex-wife said,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
and by the way,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
I do love her dearly.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
It's not like we had a big horrible fallout.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
She once said to me,

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
she goes, you're a misanthrope.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
And I said, you're only saying that because you're a person.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
But

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
I don't see myself as a misanthrope.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
I just feel really awkward.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
And you know, I really related

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
with Spencer when,

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
you know, he was awkward by the whole thing.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Good segue.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Let's bring up Spencer Crittenden!

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Now, I've had some loud applause before.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
But Jesus Christ.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:14.000
That wasn't an invitation for more.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Thank you.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Jesus Christ.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000
That was all pent up from the movie, I assume.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000
What's up, you guys?

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Can I get something off my chest?

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I'm a nerd.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
And I'm fucking sick of all these jocks acting like nerds.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
No, but okay.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
I don't actually take a lot of shit from being a nerd.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
So I've said that before,

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
but I didn't mean it.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
But here's the thing about social groups.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
From nerds to jocks to everything.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000
It's all about excluding other people.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Like, if you're a group,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
you're only a group because you're not that group.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
You're this group.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
So you have to single people out and ridicule them.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Otherwise, you're just a huge, you know, non-group.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
And so in high school,

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000
when I was a genuine bona fide nerd

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
and punished for it,

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
and choosing it,

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000
I would report dutifully to a living room

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
full of other nerds and play Dungeons and Dragons,

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
and we would talk shit about fucking jocks

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
because they weren't allowed.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
And if one of them had showed up,

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
we would have treated them like shit.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
I don't think it's a good part of nerd culture,

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
but I think that's more humanity than anything else.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
It's just we got to get cred.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000
We got to kick other people out so we can be in.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
When I was in high school,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
I was actually friends with all the other groups.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Me, too.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000
But I didn't consider them...

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Look, I hated myself way more than anybody else was going on.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
So I didn't care what they thought of me.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Yeah, I kind of was more like that, too.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
And because of that, everyone liked me.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
And I was like, well, this works.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
But then...

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
I only cared.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I was the biggest Jim Carrey fucking whore.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I only cared if people liked me.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
And I would do anything for a fucking social dollar.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
And they didn't like you, right?

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
No, they did.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
It worked.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
It's a thing.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
There's no wrong answers necessarily.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
There's wrong answers.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
I was a nerd for how much I wanted people to like me.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
And I was like...

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
just clawing my way up.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Well, I was doing stand-up when I was like 16.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
So it was weird.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
I didn't care about all the stuff everybody else cared about.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
They were worried about prom.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
And I was trying to get a tight 20 together.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Seriously, I was just a weirdo that way.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:48.000
But I also feel really embarrassed to admit this publicly.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
This may be an exclusive.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I was homecoming king.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
I was senior class vice president.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
I thought it was a joke.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
No, it probably was half.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
It was like...

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000
A lot of the nerds I talked to that were performance oriented,

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
by their senior year,

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
they had worked their way up to like,

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I am the clown prince of nerdness.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
And it was like, you've blurred the line between nerds.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
I was like, people really...

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
We used the word popularity when I was a kid.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
I don't even know if that means anything anymore now

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000
that everyone's connected to their phones and shit.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
But yeah, it still means stuff.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Popularity was like a thing.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
It still is.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Knowing who you were.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
When Tom Kenny and I...

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Tom Kenny, you guys know him as SpongeBob and all those other stuff.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
And Ice King.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
He's the Ice King on Adventure Time.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
That's the crowd, yeah.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Yeah, that's the only time I ever asked him if I could be

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
on one of the shows he works on, actually,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
because I love that show so much.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
And I've known him since I was six years old.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
We've been friends our whole lives.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
And in second grade, they were picking up teams...

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
They were picking teams for dodgeball.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
And there was three people left.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.000
It was he, I, and this girl who had two hooks for arms.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000
That's the true story.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
And we were recently talking about it.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:20.000
And he said, that was the day I knew I'd never be good at sports.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
And the way my ego worked, I actually thought,

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
oh, they didn't pick us because they knew we can handle it.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
So I've always had this huge amount of self-esteem

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
and self-loathing all at the same time.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Being able to just say, yeah, in a moment,

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
like you can emergency bilge, like, yeah.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Yeah, I just thought, yeah.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
By the way, she got picked before us.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
That's the tag.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Hope she was great, too, yeah.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Well, she's a ringer in the dodgeball game.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
She had two hooks.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Yeah, she just pops them and they stick to her.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Those are the days when I discovered them.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
You didn't hit me.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
I caught it.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
It counts.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Yeah, it's fine.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
You're out now.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Sorry, Dan.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000
What were you saying?

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
I actually, I mean, my way of coping with it

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000
wasn't to, like, create the mythology of my head.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
I would just, I just found out,

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:12.000
oh, there's a wire that all this pain comes through.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
I thought you had to get up and kick my ass.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Here's some pain coming through.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:26.000
You cut out my best parts in the movie.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
The movie only had my best parts.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Like, there's literally not another scene of me

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
being funny in any of those 600 hours of footage.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
It's amazing.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Cha-ching.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Yeah, no, you're telling me.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000
You heard that applause.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000
That's not...

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Thank you.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
That's very kind.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Anyways, I don't know why I have to follow this thought.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
I followed the cord with the pain on it,

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.000
and I found that it plugs into part of your heart,

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000
and you can pull it.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Pull it.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
The pain cord.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Yeah.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
And you don't feel anything anymore.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000
And you don't, you can actually be really mean to people.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Like, and you don't, like, there's no empathy anymore,

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
so you could, like, squeeze someone's head.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
You're going into the Game of Thrones.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
The Game of Thrones.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
What am I, 70?

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
That was the end of it.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000
When the guy puts the thumbs to the eyeballs.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
It's like, man, you know the only thing that keeps...

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Isn't it funny to realize that?

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
The only thing...

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Human beings have these eyeballs.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Like, if you're in a fight, like, you kind of...

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Like, if you're, like, a feral human,

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
like, I guess you'd probably scratch for him.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Like, I'm going to scratch your eyes out.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
But, like, truly, like, if you get in a fight,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
like, the only thing that keeps you from actually

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000
actively, like, just doing everything you can

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
to this, like, these little soft grapes

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000
that represent 90% of the person's ability to function...

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Cameras made of jelly.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
That's what they are.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
The only thing that keeps you from really getting in there

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
is actual, like, empathy.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Like, that's why when in a movie somebody goes like...

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.000
It, like, represents that person not giving a fuck.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
And you go like, what the fuck is he...

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
What does he do? Oh, my God!

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
But you're like, well, if you wanted to win a fight,

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
I guess that's...

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
I guess that's how you do it.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
That's what chimps do.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Yeah, they go for the fucking face

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
and the genitals and the hands.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
A buddy of mine...

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Everything that makes you a chimp.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
A buddy of mine was in...

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
In Georgia.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
And they had a thing when he was growing up at the fair,

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000
and it was, uh...

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
It was, uh...

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Monkey Boxing, or Chimp Boxing.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
And, and so this guy's like,

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
I'm gonna go in there.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000
It was $5,000 the last two minutes in the cage.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
I go in there, I get my mama,

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000
get my mama a trailer.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Like, he had all the money.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Oh, come on!

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Wait, how much?

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.000
How much?

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000
He worked at Cartoon Network.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000
What was the price? Sorry.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
$5,000 if you could last two minutes.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000
You could buy a truck.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Okay.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000
So he goes in...

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
I'm gonna get my mama a trailer?

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
It's not even a chimp.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000
It's an orangutan.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Oh, no!

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Oh, no.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000
They're worse, I hear.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000
They got longer reaches.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Yeah.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Well, they also have, like...

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
The painting was very misleading.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Like, he had him, like, proper, like, you know...

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000
He's gloved up.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Time's boxing.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Yeah.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
He's got an Irish handlebar mustache.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.000
I heard you wanted to have a little bit of a roundabout with me.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Queensberry rules, will it be, then?

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
One banana for the winner?

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
So, so...

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
And there's no ring.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
There's a ring on the poster.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
They get in there and it's just a cage.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:44.000
And they've put a ring through the ropes, I mean, through the bars of the cage.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000
And he says the orangutan's got boxing gloves on.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
He's just sitting there.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000
And he's like...

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
And the guy goes, you know, I'll just rope-a-dope him, you know.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000
He's got the arm length.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000
So if I just...

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
If I get in tight, you know, he's got his whole strategy.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000
I'll just get in tight.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Not rope-a-doping.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Yeah.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
So he's gonna get in there tight.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
I already doesn't know what rope-a-doping is.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
I don't know.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
So he's doomed.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000
So he gets in there.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
And they go, ding!

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000
He says, you didn't even see the chimp.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.000
The orangutan just shot across the cage, wrapped his legs around the guy, bit him in the face,

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
and pissed all over him.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
He's like...

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
You weren't there?

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
No, no, no, my friend George tells the story.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
But I do believe it's a true story.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Well, when you box, don't you usually wear a mouth guard?

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000
That's why you're calling bullshit on this story?

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000
I don't buy that.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Yes, the orangutan cheated.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000
I think this orangutan was not playing by sanctions.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
I'm playing rules.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
They could definitely get those gloves on.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000
But I wouldn't trust anyone to go in your orangutan mouth.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Well...

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Anyways, what I'm saying is, the reason we don't do that to each other when we get into fights...

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Is because that's the...

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000
We love each other.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
At the end of the day?

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.000
At the end of the day, when we look at each other, we see each other.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:06.000
And chimpanzees and orangutans, when they look at each other, they see a genetic rival.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.000
And they're like, if I take that guy out, the thing that keeps them in line is fear.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.000
They exist in these communities, and we're no strangers to this.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
We are 99% their cousins.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:24.000
But the thing that makes us different, and the thing that ironically made us be the people with the nuclear weapons,

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000
the tires, and the fire, and the lasers, and the GPS, is compassion.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:35.000
And I'm not saying that it makes us good people, but it's like an evolutionary step that we took.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000
That's my two cents as a non-anthropologist.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
But you don't think that's all fear-based?

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
You think that's compassion-based?

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:49.000
I think it's like we became a kind of weird combination of primate and pack animal.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:13:01.000
When I say chose, I mean in quotes, because evolution preferred an instinct for altruism.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:08.000
What we call, like, cool. That was nice of him. He didn't have to do that.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.000
We exude that. We notice when it's not happening.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
We notice that it's not happening all the time.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.000
But the fact is, we have it in spades over giraffes and chimpanzees.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
We are ridiculous about it.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
We will take bullets for each other without thinking about it.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000
We don't always do it. You can't predict it.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:38.000
But we do have more of a propensity for sacrifice in the face of another human being suffering.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
We will go, that's not fair.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Hey, whoa, whoa, what's going on over here? Stop picking on that guy. Even if it doesn't profit us,

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
even if it puts us at risk.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Before we even know what we're doing, we kind of go, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
What are you doing?

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
That's my theory.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000
None of us is based on science. It's based on the three documentaries I've seen.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000
And what I choose to believe.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:08.000
What you're describing is like our sharp teeth or our scorpion sting or our hard armor.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000
That's what we've evolved, is this really intense packed community.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000
We're jingoists.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Well, yeah, but it's kind of the group mentality thing I was talking about with nerds.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
That's what we evolved and that's why we go to war.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:23.000
It's because we can get together a band and go beat the shit out of a rhino.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
That's what works.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:30.000
When you watch the 300 and you see that idea of a small football team of guys going,

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:38.000
we are, we are, we are.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
That's how we kind of feel in general.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:47.000
We default to that weird, we don't just fucking run.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000
I see that kind of behavior more not about protecting the little guy,

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.000
but more about being afraid that someone's going to take their stuff away.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:01.000
I think that's what I'm saying is that that's the weird twisted path that we've taken,

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000
is that we protect ourselves through that instinct.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:10.000
I don't think that God is moving through us and therefore we're like really cool to each other.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000
I think that our species is seven billion strong because we at some point

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000
figured out the cheat code of like, how's my neighbor doing?

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:25.000
It was like not, and we are the descendants genetically of the primates

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
that acted more on that impulse than others.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:33.000
It worked out for our species just because it caused like giant communities.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
You're much more hopeful than I am.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Well, it's not getting us anywhere.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
We're all going to die together, like a bunch of altruistic assholes.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
But we're going to die after the dodo did.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Fuck the dodo, that's the key.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Fucking dodo can take a flying fuck at a rolling version of itself.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Maybe the dodo is the asshole.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
I'll tell you the biggest asshole in the world, giraffes.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Fuck giraffes.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Really?

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Fucking long neck horse.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000
That's bullshit.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
No, but it's the dolphins.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
They're the rapists of the sea.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000
We had to come back to dolphins being terrible people.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Well, because people love dolphins and they're sketchy.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000
We love dolphins as a species, but then it turns out, yeah,

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000
apparently now the new development is that when you look at dolphins,

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000
if you get past the fourth wall of dolphins, it turns out they're sexists.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Yeah.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Which I love.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000
A dolphin will fuck you up.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Yeah.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
If you're a shark, that's for sure.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
That's all I know.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Or if you're a woman.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000
A woman dolphin.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000
And if you're a female shark, oh my God.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Oh my God.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
They must be like, payday.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:45.000
I saw a video really recently about a dolphin playing with a cat.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
It was the cutest thing in the world.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.000
The dolphin would use its snout and tap the cat on the head,

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000
and then the cat would touch its paw to the snout,

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
and they'd go back and forth for two and a half minutes.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
It was adorable.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Yeah, that's the edited version.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Oh yeah.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
I was before the cat was mercilessly slaughtered.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000
It'd be great.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000
They're smart.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000
As soon as that prick drops that iPhone, I am fucking up that cat.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:14.000
If you're listening, and here there's a lot of dolphin experts in Toronto,

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.000
but if you are listening out there, please come to the nearest

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Harmontown City.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
It's a dolphin expert.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
We really want to hear more about, we're going to get to the bottom

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000
of whether dolphins are good people or bad people.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Because I really want to know, because you hear these stories

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000
of people are drowning, and then the dolphins save them,

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
and then you hear other stories that are like, no,

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.000
they actually actively drown the people because they're sociopaths.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
And then you think, well, that's like humans too.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Like you could run across the wrong kind of human.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Right, right.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
And whenever anyone uses that about an animal, they're more frightened

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000
of you than you are of them.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000
You're like, well, how do I know this isn't the crazy bear?

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Yeah.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.000
You know what I mean?

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
There's a bit of a Ted Bundy of dolphins.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000
There's just like 12 really sexist dolphins that are given everyone

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.000
the wrong impression.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Yeah.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
That's what they tell you to play dead with a bear

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
until they start eating you.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
That was always my fear.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
It's like, why do you play dead?

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Are you going to eat you that you're dead?

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Right.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000
I don't know if I grandmother that one.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.000
I think some of the bears are like,

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
you're supposed to play dead because some of the bears

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000
don't want to eat you.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
They want you to stop attacking their cubs.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
So they swipe at you, and then you're supposed to go,

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000
oh, good job.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000
I'm dead.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000
See you later.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Good luck in your bear business.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
That guy was a hell of an actor.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000
I can't kill him.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000
He's a great thespian.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Bears are like, they're huge theater fans.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
You guys are in Toronto.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000
They have bears walking down the street, right?

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
They're like, you know...

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Did someone say gay?

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Did they mean like gay bears?

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Oh, gay bears.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Okay.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000
I thought you meant it was gay.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000
The idea that wildlife was part of your society.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000
That's so gay to have a bear walking down the street.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
With an otter.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Get real.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
That's gay.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.000
They're like, you know, bears at the dump are like

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000
bikers.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.000
You know, you just stay in your car and keep the doors locked.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Did you ever go to the dump to look at bears?

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000
I never went to the dump to look at bears.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000
All right.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
A couple of wounds from people.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000
You guys going to Bear Dump in Toronto?

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Pack Eagle.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Pack Eagle?

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000
The excellent Bear Dump.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Is that the, is that like Lover's Lane?

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Well, sometimes when we weren't listening to the radio programs,

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
we'd go out to the dump.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000
I'm just picturing all these discarded bears.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:40.000
I never understood that, like, like, like.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000
It's the land of misfit toys.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.000
I guess I do get it.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000
I do get it.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
I'm a bear with no teeth.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000
But didn't that always confuse you when people would say like,

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:55.000
oh, don't feed the, the trouble is people feed the animal in question.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Like usually it's bears, but they say the same thing about

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:03.000
lions or whatever they got. The danger is when they associate humans with

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000
food and you're like, oh, got it.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Wait, what?

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000
No.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
What?

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000
What?

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Like, because that's how you train a dog.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Well, I think you might be misunderstanding what they're saying.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000
The associating with you with food is now every,

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
every person I see is going to give me food.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
So I'm going to come up to them and bother them.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Yeah.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000
And the person gives them a peanut.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Or it doesn't.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
And then they, you know, if it's a coyote, they bark.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
And, you know, that's scary for the person.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Like you don't want them approaching you because then someone could

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000
freak out and stab it in the face or something.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000
All right.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.000
So the reason, so the reason to not feed coyotes is because coyotes will get

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
stabbed in the face by someone without food.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Yeah.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
You know about coyote hazing?

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Coyote hazing.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Yeah.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000
It's really rampant in colleges.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
It's a shame.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000
I can't, if I can't have an honest conversation with you.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000
No.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Coyote hazing.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Wait, wait, wait.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.000
The intent, you know, and I don't know, everyone knows I'm a huge coyote

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000
expert.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.000
But what a cash fans.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Yeah.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.000
I love that applause.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Spencer has a, Spencer, can I explain to Bob?

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
I'd love it if you did.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Spencer, Spencer, Spencer hears about coyote activity sometimes in Los

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Angeles.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Spencer has in his head, he imagines that if he ever gets attacked by a

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000
gang of coyotes.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
I don't, I didn't put it that way.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:32.000
I was in a virtual reality setting where dangerous coyotes are definitely going to

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
attack you until one of you guys is dead.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Spencer believes that he knows how to fight a pack of coyote effectively.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Four to five.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Ropa dope pack.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000
No, no.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Not ropa dope.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Nope.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
It's a circular kicking technique.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.000
I mean, I feel like Toronto has earned, has earned a demonstration.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:58.000
I don't want to, I don't want to pimp you or anything.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000
I, I guess I'm going to have to do it.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
I mean, you have to now.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:07.000
I mean, this, when you lean, when you lean forward in your chair, this whole stage

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000
shook.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000
So, I don't know.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
I'm going to, I'm going to move.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
It just, it just, just don't do it.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
At least segue me back into coyote hazing.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Just do it.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Because I really want to get to the bottom of this.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Just do a, just do a quiet Canadian version of the coyote defense technique.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000
That's just going to look like it.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
How do you, just for Bob, what do you mean quiet?

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000
So, so there's five coyotes all around you.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Yeah.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000
And, and.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:47.000
It's just, you don't, you don't keep your back exposed for long.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000
You keep your back moving so they can't go at your knees.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000
I thought it was going to be more of a sweep kick, but it was more.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
No, you can't sweep a four-legged animal.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
That's your first mistake.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
That would be my first mistake.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Yeah.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
They got way more balanced than us.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
That's why we use chairs with four legs.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000
He was definitely taking it easy because you're nervous about these risers.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000
I mean, you felt that.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Yeah.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000
They sway.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Yeah.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000
So, so you, but you obviously care about coyotes.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Yeah.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
You mean from his tender kicks?

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Oh, yeah.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
He wants them to live to tell the tale.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:27.000
My coyote defense, if we're just fantasizing, involves a firearm.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Yeah.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Oh, no, this is an unarmed, this is an unarmed scenario.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000
If I had, you know, even just a backpack, my tactics would differ greatly.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Of course.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Well, what would it look like if you had a backpack?

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000
You'd spin around backwards while swinging a backpack.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000
All right.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Okay.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Pasha.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Yeah.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
You know, one would tackle you.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
The other eat your lunchables.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.000
It's important.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Well, you distract them with the lunchables.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
You distract them with the lunchables.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Now, I'm, I love coyotes.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
I know.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000
I actually do.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
I, I do like coyotes.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000
They're gorgeous.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:04.000
But they're also, you know, they killed, they killed my dog, Sid Vicious.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
I had a Yorkie.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000
I feel bad about that.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
But that's the animal kingdom.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Animals do.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
And it's terrible.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
It's terrible.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
And in their defense, Sid was delicious.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000
No.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000
No, but yeah.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000
So I feel really weird.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
You know, I actually went out with a chair.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.000
I didn't have a backpack and didn't think about kicking.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
And the kicking is the last resort.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.000
I got it.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.000
I got it.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.000
But I, I, I scared the coyote off of Jimmy Stewart and Andy to frame the other two dogs.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Oh, did you save your other two dogs?

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Yeah.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Yeah.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000
I mean, Los Angeles, I don't know if the Toronto has an equivalent, but Los Angeles, it's like,

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:42.000
it's crazy to me because like a wildlife is, it astounds me.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:47.000
The fact that there's raccoons astounds me because everywhere you look, there's just city.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:52.000
And then there's this whole population of like mountain lions and, and, and I don't know

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000
where they come from or where they could possibly live.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000
But yes, I understand that there's probably mountains involved.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Thank you.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Griffith Park is probably where they live.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.000
But it's just like, like, like there's kind of, sometimes you'll see like a kind of dazed

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.000
coyote, like, like walking down the sidewalk.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
In Los Feliz.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000
And it's like, holy shit.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.000
It's like a dog, but it ain't a dog.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
It'll eat another dog.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Yeah.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000
You got to haze them.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000
That's why whenever I see them driving around, I like honk my horn and I shine my lights at

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
them and I go at them like I'm going to hit them with my car.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Coyote hazing.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.000
People, look it up.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Let me talk about coyote hazing.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000
And the alternative, though, is that you're one of these people that just like your dog

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000
is gone one way.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Yeah.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000
That's what you do it.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Because like we were saying, if you feed a coyote, they'll be like, oh man, humans are

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000
cool.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000
I can go in their backyard and whatever.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000
You know, they think you're like a cool, they think humans aren't dangerous and they need

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000
to think humans are dangerous so they're not comfortable around them because when they're

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.000
comfortable around them, they're animals.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.000
All right.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Well, bears don't need to.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.000
No, you should do it to a lot of wildlife.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Like they suggest you, anytime you see a squirrel.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.500
No, but they say throw rocks at bears and make yourself as big as possible.

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:02.500
It's the same thing.

01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:03.500
They want you to be uncomfortable.

01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:08.000
They want you to make animals uncomfortable around you.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:16.000
We saw two mountain lions when we were making the Bigfoot movie I made.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:24.000
You mean Willow Creek, which is available in all the demand.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000
It was terrifying.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:30.000
What did they look like when you see them in the wild?

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Because in the movies, they're always crouching on the rock.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
It was way scarier.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:40.000
It was like standing up to really tall and it was just walking casual like, what up?

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
You know, it was really intimidating.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000
And then it was a scene.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.000
There's a scene in the tent that's really long and scary.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:53.000
We filmed that about at 2 a.m. after we'd seen a mountain lion and the actor, Bryce Johnson,

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.000
this is a long take and his character started crying.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000
And I said, that was really good, Bryce, but I just don't think your character would cry

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.000
in the scene.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
He goes, I'm not crying.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.000
He's like, the character's not crying, I'm crying.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Why are we filming this out in the woods at 3 a.m.?

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000
We could be in a hotel parking lot.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:20.000
And so we were hanging around with the ranger who was a Bigfoot enthusiast.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:26.000
And so I was sitting close to ranger Robert because I figured he could protect me from a mountain lion.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.000
And he said, because you know, I'm a writer too.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
And I go, oh, what are you writing?

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
He goes, you know Twilight?

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
I go, yeah, I don't know Twilight.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:46.000
He goes, well, I write coming of age stories set in the Bigfoot community, like Twilight.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.000
And I said, what's the name of your book?

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
You guys, the first one was Yeti or Not.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000
And I know you think I'm setting up for a joke, but it's available on eBay.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000
You can get Yeti or Not.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
What was the second one?

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:07.000
I didn't ask for the second one.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000
You know what they say about boys with big feet?

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:15.000
No.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Good times.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:23.000
The Bigfoot, it doesn't work as well with the adolescent Judy Bloom kind of culture.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Hello, God, it's me, Bigfoot.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
God, it's me, Sasquatch.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:34.000
I once, for about an evening, thought it would be funny to make that a movie.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
And then I went out and bought it.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:41.000
And I was like, nobody would be, you know, it all started because someone said,

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000
what are you doing next?

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:48.000
I said, I'm doing a period piece.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Puns.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Ah, puns.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Puns, we're back.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000
That's how today started about how much we hated puns.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.000
I think it's funny, though, that your life was in the hands of a guy that then was like,

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
I'm a writer.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Did that make you feel less safe?

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Totally.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
It's like, stand back.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
He's got an idea.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:16.000
You want a guy that's like, no, I definitely am totally enthused about the idea of physical conflict with nature.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Not a guy that's like, you know, I could have done Buffy.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.000
I'm doing this in the meantime.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Stand back, I've got a strong second act.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:33.000
But also it's like, also like you being able to resonate with that guy makes you, like as a bodyguard,

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:40.000
when it comes to a bodyguard, the quality I want most is not being able to understand what he's thinking.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Yeah.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:46.000
If I were to hire a bodyguard, I'd be like, oh, you're a giant slab of meat.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Me, back at me.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Yeah, I was definitely the alpha male at that moment.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Yeah, I've got a screenplay.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Oh boy.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Well, I don't know how much time we've burned.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
I don't know how Toronto's time works.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:02.000
I think I heard that your minutes are one minute and three seconds long.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Well, these days your beers are a little stronger and your minutes are a little longer.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.000
These days they're 57 minutes, I'm told.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Oh, that's probably America's fault.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
We probably did too much fracking.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Sorry about that.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.000
We had to, we drink your milkshake a little bit.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:25.000
We heard there's some time up here we could use to power our cars.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:37.000
But yeah, I don't know how long we've gone, but I know that we should meet some friends and play some D&D in that order.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Now, I know that we do have some friends that came here, like I know Jan's here.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
It's Jan, it's just spelled weird.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.000
No offense, Jan.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Jan, where are you?

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Are you here?

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Are you raising your hand?

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Do you want to come up and visit with us just for a little bit?

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Just for a second?

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Just for God's sake.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Jane's been on the podcast before.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Jane makes a special brand of moonshine called Earthshine because Harmontowns is a moon colony.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
So Earthshine is what he makes.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.000
How are you, buddy?

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Where are you living now?

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:30.000
I live in, it's called upstate New York, Central New York, around Elmira.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.000
So you made the trip here to Toronto to check out the show.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Did you bring your kid?

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Yep, Devon did.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Hey, Devon, how are you?

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.000
So you're making moonshine in Elmira?

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Yes.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.000
It's super legal there.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Well, it's actually not too bad.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
In New York state, you can make a limited quantity now.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Can you guys hear him okay?

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Do you need to eat that mic a little more?

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000
I need to eat the mic a little.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Okay.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Do you sell that Earthshine?

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
No, no, I'm not allowed to sell it.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000
It's a labor of love.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Absolutely.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Spencer drank some.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000
I don't know if you can tell.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
I'm doing good. I didn't drink that much.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
You know, I'm feeling warm.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Yeah, it comes in about 135 proofs.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.000
So yeah, you definitely want to cut it with water, serve it on the rocks.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000
That's tough.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Yeah, we saw them.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Most of these people saw the movie.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:19.000
That wasn't your moonshine, but high proof alcohol.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Right now, the crowd is going, oh, I hope Dan drinks some of it.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.000
You're going to take a poll?

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000
You don't need to take a poll.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.000
They want that ending.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
I mean, I'm more than happy to.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000
It's backstage.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000
The show is almost over.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:37.000
You're going to want to chase it with some vodka.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:44.500
I just noticed your logo is like, it's like the male female symbol, but it's like the

01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:49.800
male thing, but the wiener is kind of bent around the circumference.

01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:53.000
It's because you're talking about your sex drive diminishing.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Actually, I did a bumper sticker version of that that some people have seen that says

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Harmontown, next tangent.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Oh, that's a tangent.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.000
It's like an off-ramp type of motif.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Now, Aaron told me one thing.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Keep him away from the shine.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Oh, really?

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000
No.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Pop scratch gold card.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
You have one job.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Cheers.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Oh, no.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:24.000
That's what I did.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000
I mean, it's so crazy.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Do you ever talk about on stage?

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.000
We tried to.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.000
You were trying to interview me, and Jeff kept interrupting me.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.000
I'm Bobcat.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
He just pointed at me.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Jeff.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Well, it's your seat.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
I think Jeff's a lot more hurt than I am right now.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000
So when I came up on stage, I introduced myself as Glenn.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Glenn.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Right.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Which is my birthday.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:54.000
And then I was feeling kind of like, here's a chance.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000
There's a community.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000
It's going to be very accepting.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
I could have just come out as transgendered, right?

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:03.000
So I sent you a letter afterwards that you got the next night.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
And then you read it in episode 79.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:08.000
You read some of it, and you guys talked about it.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Five or 10 minutes about transgender, and it was really cool.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:16.000
You really shared a lot of just very forthcoming, very accepting

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
around the whole idea of transgenderism.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Because transgender is the new black.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
I want to end on the ground floor of that shit.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000
I don't want to get shot in the fucking...

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Say the T-word, man.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:35.000
No, but the chance-gender thing is like, you can't even say...

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000
I can't even say a simple thing like, it's crazy.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Someone will go, that really offended me when you said it's crazy.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
It's fucking crazy.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:50.000
We're us struggling to cope with it, to work with it, is a crazy new thing.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
It's new. It's very new.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:57.000
It's coming out of this whole stigma of being a mental illness.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:06.000
And trying to deal with it as like an actual code in the DSM-4, DSM-5,

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:10.000
diagnostic manual for people.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:19.000
But the mental illness side of it is that I'm really confused.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Society is confused about me, and I'm trying to deal with a society

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.000
that has all these expectations about how I'm going to behave.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
There was a time when somebody were to say, you know,

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:35.000
I guess I was born a dude, technically, but I truly feel like

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.000
I would like to identify as a woman.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.000
There was definitely a time, and I think we're still living in that time,

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.000
when people would go, okay, we have a word for that.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
It's called crazy.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:53.000
But now the progression is, oh, okay, let's stop calling that crazy.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Let's build a society around people being allowed to do that.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000
And as people start to do that, you start to dig a little bit more deeper

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
into just how complex it is.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
You and Jeff started to get into this a little bit.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
You started talking about Kinsey scale and stuff.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:10.000
You're starting to recognize that, so you can have this continuum

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:14.000
from male to female, when people can sit in between somewhere

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000
on how they identify, but also how they present,

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.000
and what their biology is, what's their physiology,

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
what is their genetics.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Every one of those aspects has a sliding scale.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Right.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Nobody is at either end.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.000
And not only do you not sit at a particular point in any of those scales,

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000
you have ranges, and those ranges change with time,

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
and they interact with each other.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
And that's just the gender identity part of it, or the physiology.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Then you have the whole sexual side of it as well.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Are you attracted to men?

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Are you attracted to women?

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Are you attracted to both?

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Are you attracted to neither?

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Are you attracted to people who are particularly somewhere sitting in between?

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.000
You have the whole idea of pansexuality or asexuality,

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.000
and all these variables, you can stack them up in this hyperspatial,

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.000
and I've developed one of these, I'm a scientist,

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:09.000
and you can hyperspatially map a person's sexual gender physiological identity,

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.000
and you find out, God, we are fucking complex.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Yeah, imagine we would be.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
How is society going to deal with that?

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000
In 15 years, you'll be able to, because I see video games,

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.000
where I can choose to be a man or a woman or something in between.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Like, right now, you can still hit a binary switch,

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:29.000
and you go, ah, I'll be a female, but I'll be a plant creature.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Makes the code a lot more simple.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Like, the code will break those barriers down,

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
and video games will just be like,

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
well, do you want to have feminine characteristics,

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000
or what does that mean?

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
That's also a dichotomy.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
My point being that in terms of simulation,

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
we always look forward to simulation.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.000
20 years from now, you're going to put a USB,

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.000
I'm sure that standard will still remain.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:57.000
You're going to put a key chain plug in the back of your head,

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:00.000
and for six hours, if you have six hours to spare,

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:05.000
you're going to get to know what it feels like to be an adolescent octopus.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Like, you're not going to,

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
and you're going to come out of that experience

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:13.000
and having totally fucking loved and lost as a female octopus,

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:17.000
adolescent octopus, and, you know,

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.000
you're going to go back to work and take over banks and stuff,

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.000
but you're going to be like, fuck, I miss Stacy.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.000
And your wife's going to be like, what were you doing?

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000
No, I was playing, you know, Tomb Raider.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:37.000
But if we are afforded the opportunity,

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:42.000
and I think Thailand stands in evidence of this,

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
if we are afforded the opportunity,

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
we will do a lot of fucked up shit.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Like, tourists will check into a hotel,

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.000
and they will explore different avenues,

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:55.000
and they will bend different things.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:58.000
We structure our civilization on, like,

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
do I have too much moonshine?

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Is that what I'm talking about?

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
What did Thailand do wrong?

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Thailand didn't do anything wrong.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
I'm sorry, Thailand.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
I've never been there.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
I was playing on a joke.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
I thought we would get a laugh.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:23.000
It seems as clear...

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Well, he makes it.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:30.000
It's like a bee drinking honey.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Like, big deal.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:37.000
But it seems as clear as it should have been

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.000
to people who are making their money off of vinyl

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:45.000
that MP3s were a thing, that sexuality is more complicated

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000
than a dichotomy.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000
It seems that clear.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.000
That doesn't mean that anyone should get over their hangups,

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
but it definitely does seem like it's like,

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
oh, we're going to have to get used to the bit-torrenting

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.000
of sexuality.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.000
We're going to have to accept that, like,

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:04.000
it is a four-dimensional, like, Tesseract.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
It's like...

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:10.000
So I'm turning 50 with me, Bob, or the old people.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Congratulations.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Thank you.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.000
But I have a lot of hope from the kids.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.000
I mean, I see that it's just becoming more and more common,

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000
a lot more fluid.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.000
It's not everywhere, and it depends upon where you live,

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
but it's a creeping thing.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
It'll keep moving forward, I think,

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:34.000
and people just see people like me, people like...

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Drew Paul?

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Well, maybe a little...

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.000
No, absolutely, though.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000
I don't know.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000
I don't know.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.000
I don't know.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.000
I don't know.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Chesbono, I mean, there's just a lot of people

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.000
who are coming... Bruce Jenner, evidently.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Well, you give me...

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000
That's what I didn't know about.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
You bring up an interesting point, which is,

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.000
aren't old people necessarily worse people

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
than young people?

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Yeah, that is a good point.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000
I mean, that's...

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Because if we keep getting more progressive

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
and accepting and more ethical,

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.000
then that means that we were less that.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Well, we were bound by...

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.000
So my grandma should be murdered.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
He has an agenda.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Yeah, I think so.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
If anyone sees my grandma,

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.000
I will pay 200 U.S. dollars.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000
He's not fucking joking.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000
He hates his grandma.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
She's crazy.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Something that you don't know about Sprenger,

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
he fucking hates all old people.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
And he actually hates all old people.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.000
I'm not kidding.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:31.000
I used to resent young people, you know,

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.000
and now I hate people my age or older,

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:38.000
because they embrace their lack of...

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.000
You know what I mean?

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000
It's just like,

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
I don't know how the internet works.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000
How do I poop?

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.000
And it's your fault.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Yeah, I don't like that either.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Cremuginary.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.000
I don't...

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000
There's a certain...

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Cremuginary to me is like,

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
here's what I like to do.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
I like somebody who thinks they have a claim

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:59.000
to my time finding out that I'm 41 years old.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Get the fuck away from me.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
I just like the general,

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000
like kind of like,

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
nope, you're not the first person

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000
that's ever tried to leverage me

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
in that particular emotional way.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.000
You are scenario 317A.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Go fuck yourself.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
I'm closer to death than you are.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Membership has its privileges.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
That's the only...

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
As far as like,

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
yeah, I mean like culture,

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
like you definitely need to check yourself

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.000
when you're older,

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
because you definitely...

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
It's not adorable or cute.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.000
To be like,

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.000
I don't know how to work this.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:37.000
It's like, figure it out, you fucking piece of shit.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Yeah, I find it really annoying.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.000
And also,

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
figure me out, you fucking pieces of shit.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
I also extend that to movies and shit.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
Like, I start to feel like,

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
you would hear me complaining a lot

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
about movies if I bothered to...

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
I find it uncharismatic,

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
people my age going like,

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
did you see Iron Man 5?

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
I'm like, it's not for you,

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
you 49-year-old dumbass.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
It's fucking for people

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
seeing their first movie ever.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
That's for 18-year-olds.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
They're not making movies for us anymore.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Yeah, there's an art to it,

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
to making movies for 18-year-olds.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Maybe they did it better or worse

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.000
in that regard,

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000
but come on,

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000
you should be ashamed of yourself.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Go watch something French.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
If you're that...

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
If you're 45

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
and you haven't figured out

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
how to see a good movie,

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
it's on you.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Well...

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Oh, that third Hulk movie, boo!

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Yeah.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
You're 45!

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Derivative.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Would you please...

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.000
I mean, it's fine.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
I will have that conversation with you

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.000
for three hours,

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
like, in private.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.000
I'm just saying,

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
don't shake your cane at the kids.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Like, if they like Guardians of the Galaxy,

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
which sucks!

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.000
What?

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
I was fucking boring and dumb.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
What was boring about it, damn?

01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.000
I'm not gonna say,

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.000
because I'm 41 and I have class.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
I'm 50 and I don't.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.000
I loved it.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Yeah, he's older than you.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
I am Groot!

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Okay, part of it is watching it

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
on a Canadian hotel TV screen.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.000
I don't know.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.000
I've probably lost something

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.000
in the standard...

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.000
How is that even possible?

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Is that out in Canadian theaters?

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
Dude, I'm telling you...

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Doesn't it take like two years

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000
for movies to come up here?

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.000
That's racist.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.000
That's racist.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000
That's country-ist.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Thank you.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Country-ist.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
That's a cultural thing.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000
I didn't think Guardians of the Galaxy

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
was worth the hoopla.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Nothing's ever worth the hoopla.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.000
But then I was like,

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000
the kids like it.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
So, so do I.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000
There you go.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
I enjoyed it.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
I enjoyed it.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Would you call yourself a filmmaker?

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.000
No.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
I'd call you a filmmaker.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Thank you.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Say, I'm a guy.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.000
I make movies.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
I like that.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.000
When I...

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Because I would vomit in my own mouth

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
if I heard the dude from Police Academy

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
referring to himself as a filmmaker.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Filmmaker.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Hello.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.000
I'm Bobsketch Goldfob.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Filmmaker.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.000
That's why my name's not even

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.000
on my movies till the very end.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Bobsketch Goldfob?

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Yeah.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.000
No.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:13.000
I had a woman at me.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Mr. Fancy Nose.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000
She said,

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:16.000
are you Bobsketch Goldfob?

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.000
And I was like,

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
I gotta end this conversation.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.000
I got,

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
yes, yes I am.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.000
I'm whatever

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
takes to get away from you.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:28.000
What's your rich cousin from Toronto?

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.000
He's coming up.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Hello.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
I'm Bobsketch Goldfob.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:35.000
What are you doing here?

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.000
We should get some estrogen up here.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Excuse me.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Let's see.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:42.000
I don't know.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
That's one milligram twice.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:47.000
That's one of 50 questions I have for you.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Can I get some of yours?

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Are you holding?

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Look,

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.000
I don't do drugs,

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:57.000
but that would be a pretty good experiment.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Yeah, that actually would be.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.000
I mean,

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.000
we're going to be able to do that.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.000
That's what I'm saying.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:02.000
You're going to be able to put

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:03.000
a USB drive in your head.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:04.000
You're going to be able to get

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.000
to be anything you want for a day.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:06.000
What do you identify as?

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Female.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.000
But I mean,

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.000
just straight out,

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.000
that's what you say?

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Yes.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Okay.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.000
I have a question about,

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000
and I'm interested,

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.000
and not that you represent

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:16.000
the entire community or something,

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:19.000
and I'm going to sound super naive right now.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
You wouldn't sound worse than Jeff did

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.000
back in episodes.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000
But I'm wondering like,

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
maybe you guys talked about it,

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
but Jared Leto's performance

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
in Dallas Buyer's club

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:32.000
seemed to get criticized by the community.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Do you have anything?

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.000
I haven't seen that.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Oh, okay.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Was it too,

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.000
like Queenie or,

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
I think I saw that movie.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.000
I mean,

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.000
but what do I know?

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.000
But I mean,

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.000
it didn't bother me.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:44.000
I didn't call.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:45.000
You don't know what problem

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:46.000
they had with it.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Well,

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:48.000
I felt like he performed,

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.000
and I felt like he was a dude.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
I felt he was playing a human being.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:54.000
I didn't think it was kitsch

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.000
or over the top,

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.000
but maybe that's,

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
maybe the people who had a problem with it

01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:59.000
don't hang out with the...

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Well,

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
I'm hearing a lot of good stuff.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
I've just seen some clips online.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.000
I haven't actually seen

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:06.000
an episode of Jeffrey Tambor's

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.000
performance in,

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:08.000
yeah,

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.000
in Transparent.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.000
So it's a new...

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:11.000
But it's weird.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.000
It's like,

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000
anytime there's a group

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.000
that starts to get

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.000
respect,

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
there's so much infighting.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Well, there's a...

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.000
There's ever the very...

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.000
It's the group thing, right?

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Yeah.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.000
I mean,

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:23.000
when you have something as complex

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.000
as transgenderism,

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.000
transsexuality,

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.000
transgender identity,

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.000
generally,

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
you're going to draw your Venn diagram

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.000
a lot of different ways.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Yeah.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000
And I understand that

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.000
the complaint is,

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.000
why didn't you hire

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.000
a real transgender person,

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.000
but the reality of it

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.000
is that wouldn't have gotten

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
made that movie without it.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
And what is a real transgender person?

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Yeah, what is that?

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.000
There's a lot of...

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.000
What is that?

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:45.000
So, right.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.000
So, I mean,

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:47.000
I identify as female.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000
I am...

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:53.000
I identify as pansexual.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
I have a male body,

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:56.000
mostly,

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.000
at the moment,

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
but I am taking female hormones.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
I have a male genetic structure,

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.000
as far as I know.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.000
I have no idea

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.000
what my epigenetic structure is

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
or the structure of my brain.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
All these things are mixing together,

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.000
and since the age of 12,

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
have been sort of moving to be toward

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
something where I stand here now,

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:16.000
as I know some people who would say

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:19.000
that when they get to this point

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
where your body is a certain way

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
and your mind is essentially

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:26.000
poisoned by male hormones

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:27.000
for 40 years,

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.000
but you're actually a female

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
that just manifested differently.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
So, the fascinating thing about

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
transgenderism,

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:35.000
is that an ism?

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.000
That'll do.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Is the idea that what we're talking about

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:43.000
is release from a dichotomy.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
We're talking largely about

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.000
transcendence of dichotomy.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.000
And yet, there is so much focus,

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:56.000
I guess, by necessity on dichotomy.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Necessity within the context of the culture.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Right.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
When I was a kid,

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
we had Boy George and we had Prince,

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
and I have no idea what was going on with them.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Boy George was my hero.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
I knew that my parents

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
were upset about them.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
And the reason they were upset

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
is because my dad couldn't figure out

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
if they were a boy or a girl.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
And in fact, the heavy metal guys

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
were wearing mascara and stuff.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Androgyny was a form of rebellion,

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:28.000
but it was all in service of dichotomy.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
It seems to me like the dichotomy

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.000
is the enemy, isn't it?

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Isn't the idea that you're either

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
a man or a woman the actual bad guy?

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Well, it's a matter of comfort.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Society has a certain comfort level

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
and a certain energy level that's necessary

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:46.000
to maintain its structure and its forward momentum.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Complexity makes that worse.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
And when you start acknowledging complexity,

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
a culture begins to say,

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
I need systems to deal with this.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
I need more pigeonholes.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
I need more bins.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.000
I need more bits in my bites.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.000
And that takes energy and takes time

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:08.000
until people begin to then sort of relax back from it

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.000
and say the answer isn't more pigeonholes.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:14.000
The answer is just more acceptance of individuals.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Yeah, I always feel like...

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Don't give him applause.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
That's my applause.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
I created the form, but now I'm kidding.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
I always feel like...

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:29.000
The big difference is as we progress,

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
there's always two...

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.000
There's the progress that lowers barriers,

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000
that makes walls that used to be there stop existing.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.000
And those are really scary to people.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000
And then there's militant versions of the progress

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.000
that actually raise new walls.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
And I'm always very suspicious of them.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
They're like, why are you telling me

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:54.000
that from now on I have to do this or that?

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
The fear is on both sides, right?

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:01.000
You're going through life with this sort of a situation like I have.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
You get very defensive.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Yeah, because you're trying to protect your own system.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
I could appreciate that.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:12.000
And across all those different spectrums I was talking about,

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.000
each one of those subgroups has their own groups,

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
their own barriers, their own protections.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
It's incredibly difficult.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:23.000
I always feel like you can feel the nails across the chalkboard.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
When we have a transgender person on stage,

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
or anyone that addresses the subject,

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.000
I always feel like unlike if you talk about race or class or gender,

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:35.000
you can feel like the confusion.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
You can feel the nails on the chalkboard.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
You can hear in an audience of 200 people,

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:42.000
you can hear one person popping up over there and over there,

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
and then they're gone like, that's nuts.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:49.000
But you pointed out before about when Levi was up on stage.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Because Levi's a very fucking specific dude.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Right.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:54.000
He had the mustache.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:58.000
He was talking about how he was owning the male physiology.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:03.000
And he was saying, in Los Angeles in 2014,

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:06.000
that meant he was an ambassador of transgenderism.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:09.000
And so there were people in the back of the room.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Why aren't you effininate?

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Why aren't you just like bullying?

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
It's like, oh, where's your makeup?

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Where's your dress?

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000
It's like, oh, okay.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.000
But right now, so I'm presenting fairly male.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000
I have on women's pants.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Nice.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
I have on androgynous chucks, which I've always worn.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.000
All right.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:28.000
I'm rocking my feral audio t-shirt.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Now you're making me question my sexuality.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Well, you should be.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
What's similar to me?

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:37.000
40% of your wardrobe is apparently female.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:40.000
But it's how I'm feeling.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.000
I'm going to reach a point in my life where I'm going to present

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
obviously female all the time.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000
I'm going to legally.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
You heard it here first folks.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:51.000
I'm going to change my name to Jane.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
What, no, so is that your goal?

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.000
I mean, I feel like this could be a three hour podcast.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Is it different goals for different people?

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
That is part of the dichotomy.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:06.000
There is a point where you will be like, I have arrived at a place.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
You will be a...

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Well, I am arriving at a place every single fucking day, believe me.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:16.000
And what I will do is I will arrive at a place where I'll say,

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:20.000
okay, for the good of the people who I have to associate with

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:24.000
because of my professional life, because of my family life, whatever,

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:29.000
I need to put a stake in the ground for everyone else's comfort

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:32.000
because I'm a nice person and I understand that I need to exist.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:35.000
I'm not going to be the militant outsider my whole life.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:38.000
So I'm going to say, okay, for everybody else,

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:41.000
preferred gender pronoun is now female.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:45.000
The name is Jane and I'm going to be wearing a dress

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
and I'm going to be wanting to use the women's bathroom.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:52.000
And that just becomes, okay, that legally, socially, whatever,

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000
that's a stake in the ground.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:57.000
But that's not something that any transgender person has to do

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:01.000
because they have no obligations in society to do anything.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
They're just trying to believe me.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
I mean, I'm 50 and I'm just taking these steps

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:09.000
and I've known since I was 10 or 11 that something was fucked up.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:12.000
It's taken me this long to get my life to a point

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:15.000
where I can just be up here on this stage.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Is that why you dedicated most of your life to creating a substance

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
that would fuck other people up?

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Yes, absolutely.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:25.000
You're like a Marvel super villain.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Well, none of them will know what's going on.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:29.000
A poisoning woman.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
They will all wake up every morning,

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:34.000
wondering what they did last night, who they were,

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:38.000
I am androgyne max.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:42.000
It's funny because Dr. Horrible is one of my big heroes.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:46.000
I think you should stay up here.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:50.000
When I was a kid, I was in a dress a lot.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
And it wasn't for the comedy.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:56.000
It was truly like I felt comfortable.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.000
And when you were like at a high school function

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:04.000
and you show up in a skirt, not a kilt, just a skirt,

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:07.000
it couldn't be a bigger fuck you to the football team.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:10.000
It would be like, hey, how you doing?

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
And it would be like, it was really beautiful.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
I used to wear skirts when I used to work on the show

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
and happily ever after on tape night.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Because when they would go, please welcome your audience.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:22.000
And it'd be Marines would be the audience.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.000
And then I'd come out and they'd be like, yeah.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:28.000
And one day when my daughter was really little,

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
she was about eight, I woke her up and she goes,

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:31.000
dad, where'd you get that sweater?

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.000
I go, oh, it's new.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.000
She goes, it would go so well with your brown skirt.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:39.000
But the reason I did it was it would be really comfortable.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
And it's such a fuck you.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:44.000
You're not like, if you were on the set of community

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:49.000
and you show up in a skirt, you're like, I'm the fucking guy.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Go fuck yourself.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
I think they would actually be like, oh, good.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Now we have a label for what's wrong with you.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Because otherwise it's just why is it

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:01.000
free and beautiful way to like squirt your musk?

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Yeah, I know.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
I mean, anything is, yeah.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
I think everybody should.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:10.000
The way I can access it is let's get out of dichotomies.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Let's get away from it has to be this or that.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
That's what I can understand.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:19.000
But in thinking that, that's just me,

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:22.000
a guy that exists within a very specific dichotomy,

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:25.000
that's going like, well, world without dichotomies.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Boy, oh boy.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
There are people who want.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:31.000
That's why I was obsessing about that dichotomy thing.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:32.000
It was like, well, yeah.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:35.000
But a lot of people, it actually is about going from one side

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:40.000
of the fence to the other, like specifically,

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.000
even though to a person who exists on either side

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
of that fence, that person might be a hero

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
by virtue of their transcendence.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
They actually are making a journey

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:53.000
and they want to arrive somewhere and create stability

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
and be something.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
That to me is the confusing thing,

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
because I don't want to offend anybody

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
by assuming that about them.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
I don't want to look at somebody and go like,

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:06.000
well, you can't wait to be a woman, can you?

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:10.000
It's like, maybe you're something other than that.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:13.000
That doesn't, but if that were your goal,

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
I would love to get behind it.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
And again, I don't want to say,

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.000
I just can't speak for the entire trans community,

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
because it's humongous.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
But I think in general,

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:27.000
my experience has been that most trans folk

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:31.000
are actually very understanding

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
of what's called the cis-gendered community,

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
the people whose gender aligns.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
I'm offended by that phrase, by the way.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Yes, yes.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
I'm starting that movement fairly.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
The anti-cis.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Because we get what it's like to be misunderstood,

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:48.000
and if you've waited a long time,

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:53.000
just to have someone take the time to ask,

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:54.000
it's always better,

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.000
what would you like your preferred gender pronoun to be?

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
How would you like me to address you?

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Which restroom would you like to be using?

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Shall I open the door for you or will you open it for me?

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:10.000
All these sorts of identity things that society demands,

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
ask about them.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Trans people will love the fact that you care enough to ask.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
To be the devil's advocate,

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:21.000
a lot of people in this room would love to be constantly asked

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
about all their fucking bullshit.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:26.000
But everybody wants to be a fucking rockstar.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Right, but if trans folk put themselves out

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:34.000
really in the gun sites constantly,

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:38.000
and more so than a lot of hidden issues,

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:41.000
but it's more for your benefit,

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:44.000
for other people who aren't trans,

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
go ahead and ask.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
If you're uncomfortable, ask.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
If you're not uncomfortable, don't worry about it.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
In the past, social movements,

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
progressive movements have been about people

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:57.000
who have been shut out actively,

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:58.000
people who are like,

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:03.000
you're black, you can therefore not come into this room,

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:07.000
and progress has been indicated by people going from saying,

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
I will beat you up if you come in here,

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
to stopping doing that,

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:14.000
to no longer doing things

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:17.000
that they were actively doing because of hatred,

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:21.000
dropping things, lowering walls, stopping things.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:24.000
And I think the transgender movement,

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:27.000
the part that I understand about it

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:32.000
is people saying, drop your gender consciousness.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:33.000
Drop it.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:37.000
Stop thinking about men and women as being different things.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:41.000
That's where feminism and nerdism and blackism

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:46.000
and LGBTs and every other alphabet letter,

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
they all intersect there.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:52.000
It can all stop thinking about the person

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:56.000
that you're looking at as being anything other than a person.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:57.000
That person stops.

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.000
Get to know that person.

01:59:58.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Let the boundaries drop.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:02.000
The things that I don't get are the movements

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
that involve new rules.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:10.000
My 41-year-old road comic quills are going to go,

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:13.000
I ain't learning no new rules.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:16.000
I will definitely learn to stop doing more shit.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Absolutely.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
I jumped aboard.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:22.000
As soon as I found out that anyone

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
had a problem with gay people, I was like,

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
I am so on board, it's crazy.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000
You know why?

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:31.000
It's the easiest way to be progressive in the world.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Don't hate them.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:37.000
All you have to do is give less of a shit about more people.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Absolutely.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:42.000
All you have to do is stop caring about even more people.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:43.000
It's fucking great.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:47.000
My parents had to bother to dedicate a section of their brain

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.000
to keeping gay people from doing shit.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:53.000
What a dumb waste of fucking time.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
A Minecraft to play.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
I'm a fucking advocate.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Get married.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:01.000
Do whatever the fuck you want.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
It's easy.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Boundaries coming down.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
I think that's what Irish people, Jewish people,

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
black people, that's all they ever wanted was,

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.000
can you stop noticing that I'm black?

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:18.000
The tough thing is, in a culture in America,

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:21.000
down south as we call it up here,

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:24.000
where we truly, it's fucking noteworthy

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:27.000
that our progress is like,

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:31.000
black men got the vote before white women.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:37.000
We respected people that we regarded as property

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:40.000
enough to say, yes, you should also have a say

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:43.000
in who's president, and then sometime later,

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:47.000
women got the right to also be counted on that.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:51.000
That is why I think the trans thing is like,

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
it's like, holy fuck.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:57.000
It's not because we don't respect people

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
for moving from one side to the other.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
It's because we don't know the fuck we were thinking

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
in the first place about men and women.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:04.000
It was a tough road.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:05.000
We have no idea.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:06.000
We're just barely going to...

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Anyways, too much earth shine.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:09.000
You haven't drank anything.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:12.000
I only had a couple of quarts of this.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:15.000
If you told me we were up here for six hours,

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:16.000
I believe you.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Yeah, I think we're over two hours.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:19.000
No, no.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Let's go to the toad board.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
I'm 100% sure I'm pretty...

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
What does that mean?

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
That's the time it currently is.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
That's not helpful unless we know when we started.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
How long have we been up here?

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Almost two hours.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Two hours?

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Alright.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
How do we end this show?

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
D&D.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Alright, let's very quickly find a woman.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
Someone who identifies as a woman.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:46.000
What?

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Genetic woman?

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Let's take the one in the front because we got no time to waste.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:59.000
And by the one, I don't mean that you're an object.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:00.000
What's your name, young lady?

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:01.000
I'm Jillian.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Jillian?

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Alright.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Okay, let's get the show on the road.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:09.000
I don't know.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:10.000
I love Toronto.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.000
I fucking...

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:12.000
I could be up here for seven hours.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:13.000
I don't care.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:16.000
There you go then.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Oh, thank you.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Who's going to be whom?

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Let's just see how the dice, you know, roll.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:28.000
Well, I would assume that Goldthwaite should play Quark.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
That's Jeff's character.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
I'll play Sharpie.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
I appear to be dignity.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Chris de Burgh.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
And you should be Jillian.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
You're my fiancé, Mulraine.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Or, well, Diggity Star's Garden of Hell.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:50.000
We're going to start doing this song called The Trans Woman in Lavender.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Alright.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:55.000
Let's break down those color barriers too.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
I'm not going to get music, right?

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:58.000
I mean, I don't need it.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:03:59.000
I just want to know now.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.000
What?

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:01.000
What do you want to know?

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:02.000
I'm not going to get music, right?

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Oh, fuck no, man.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.000
That's all I asked.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.000
I don't...

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:10.000
That's fucking America, dude, where we have missiles pointed at whoever doesn't play music.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:11.000
Alright.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Well, uh...

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
But if you cut your finger here...

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Get a new finger.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Yeah.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Wow.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Alright.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:24.000
Put on by a beaver.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:27.000
So, acapella then.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:32.000
When we last met, our heroes had just finished dispatching Father Tinder,

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:35.000
who after murdering the Dharma household,

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
called upon the evil might of the Shard of Power,

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:40.000
and was transformed into a massive monster.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
But despite his demonic new form,

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:45.000
teamwork still managed to win the day.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:48.000
But left with Father Tinder's shattered corpse,

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
our gang was looking pretty suspicious,

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:51.000
and when the cops came,

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:55.000
Diggity lied to the guard while our friends escaped.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
After trying to figure out what was going on,

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
the gang found and interrogated Spizzbulb,

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:02.000
who was very defensive towards Sharpie's questioning.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
But then everybody calmed down,

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:07.000
and in the lull, Sharpie and Diggity ran out into the street

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
and got hit by a horse-drawn carriage.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:10.000
Oh.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Was that cannon?

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:12.000
Yeah.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Yeah.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
They got knocked down.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
Will they get back up again?

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:20.000
Is anything ever gonna keep them down?

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:23.000
Find out on an all-new Pulse Pounding episode.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:33.000
So, okay.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:37.000
You guys, you two are lying in the street face up.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:41.000
Your consciousness slowly, slowly comes back to you,

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:44.000
and you don't know what happens, or what happened.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:45.000
You're talking about all of us?

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Just the two of you that were hit by a horse-drawn carriage.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Me, me, and...

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:51.000
When I'm doing the music for you, I'm not listening.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:55.000
No, I mean, when you're not doing the music for me, you're not listening.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:06:02.000
Also, when I'm sober and or have had a court of some weird...

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:03.000
Earthshine.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:04.000
Yeah.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:05.000
Some miraculous earthshine.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Yeah, so you got hit by a fucking horse-drawn carriage.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:09.000
I did.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.000
You two farther away from me.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:11.000
You see this happen.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:12.000
React.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Oh, no.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Why did you do that?

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:18.000
What just happened?

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:22.000
I hope our good friends are okay.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:26.000
I'm going to run over and check on them, and drag them out of the street.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:29.000
Actually, I'll drag them out of the street so they don't get run over again.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
I'm going to say that's successful, because I don't have my dice out.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:34.000
I'm going to watch.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
Does this village have universal health care?

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
Give this guy some dice for God's sake, Toronto.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:39.000
How do they give it?

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:40.000
He has it.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:41.000
He saves.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:42.000
There's no clerics.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:43.000
You got socialized medicine?

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:44.000
You don't have dice?

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:45.000
No, I have them.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:46.000
They were just in my bag.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Sorry, I didn't mean to berate you.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:48.000
I didn't feel you were berating me.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:49.000
I thought that was great.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:50.000
No, I was talking to them.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:51.000
I didn't feel like you were berating them.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
I thought that was great.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:58.000
All right, you pull them out of the street.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
You guys are injured pretty badly.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
A couple of your ribs are broken.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Ow.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Accurate.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Ow.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Ow.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:11.000
I don't think any of us have any healing.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
That's dignity actually does.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Can I heal myself?

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Yeah.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:23.000
You lay hands onto yourself and you gain back 14 hit points, I think.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:24.000
14.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Not very Canadian of you.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
I don't get that at all.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
Can I heal Sharpie now?

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:33.000
I heal Sharpie.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:36.000
He also takes 14 hit points of healing.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Thank you.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:38.000
You're welcome.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:43.000
Can we recollect and go back in and talk to Spizzbulb again without you being...

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:47.000
I don't know if you remember, Dan, how you were...

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:48.000
I don't remember.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:49.000
...behaving.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Spizzbulb's there with you.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:54.000
You were having a Le Neuve moment with Spizzbulb.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
Yeah, Spizzbulb's there with you in the wheelchair.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
He's like, that was crazy.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:01.000
You guys should look both ways.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
I was mean to the actual Spizzbulb.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Don't worry about it.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
You don't remember.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
Spizzbulb was in the wheelchair.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
Can I heal him?

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Yeah.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Okay, I lay hands on Spizzbulb.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:20.000
He's like, oh man, that's super good, but my vertebrae are still shattered.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
Oh, sorry.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:25.000
I mean, it feels less painful, so thank you.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Classic, classic mistake.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
I don't feel so well.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
I sure could get healed.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:35.000
I got seven per day, so I got, like, what, four left?

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Can I lay hands on Quark?

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Oh, yeah.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
I lay hands on Quark.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Yeah.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
You feel so good.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:50.000
Oh, mother perl.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:51.000
I'm fine.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.000
That's great.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
This is a great adventure.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Yeah, it's amazing.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:56.000
It's adventurous.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:02.000
Speaking of adventurous, you hear yet again a very familiar sound that you've heard not long ago.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:05.000
It sounds like a police siren.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.000
Wee-wee, wee-wee, wee-wee.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:09.000
It's Borat.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Borat's coming.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:11.000
My wife.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Wa-wa-wee-wa.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
You hear that sound.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:17.000
We just ran away from them.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:18.000
You sure did.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.000
Oh, shit.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:22.000
Well, I wish I didn't eat my wee.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:26.000
We should get out of town.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:33.000
The whole thing is going on, though, with Admiral Darkstar in the angel body being repelled by...

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
Does anybody else remember this dark election?

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Where do you think we should go?

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:44.000
I'm serious because, honestly, the last couple weeks have been a mess.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
You've been listening.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Where do you think we should go?

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Air City.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Yeah, we were supposed to be trying to get to the Air City because...

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
Why were we going to the Air City again?

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:57.000
Because that's where the robot baby was going to get his memories back.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
Right, it was the robot baby quest.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:00.000
So we should get out of town.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
No, we should try to get outside.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Yeah, this whole thing was a bad turn.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Dignity.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Admiral Darkstar's guide.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:09.000
I know you work here.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:13.000
I know you've been with us only a short time, but we would appreciate your help getting out of town.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:14.000
I can help with that.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:15.000
Great.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:16.000
She has a horse.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
Let's take my horse.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Let's get out of town.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:23.000
Do we all fit on it?

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:26.000
How many people usually fit on the horse?

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
Don't tell them the truth.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
The truth will punish you.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Like, what's the max capacity of a horse?

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
It's too comfortably.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:36.000
Palomino?

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:37.000
A luxury Palomino?

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
No, a regular one is like nine.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Is a Clydesdale a horse?

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.000
Yes.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:45.000
You could fit all of us on a Clydesdale.

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
That's a stretch limo.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
No, I know Quirk's halfling.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
I know he's a gnome.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
No, seriously, I don't know.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Two people.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:57.000
No, I think you can all fit uncomfortably.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Alright, it's not a joke.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Can we get out of town?

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:05.000
Can we get through the gates?

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:08.000
Yeah, you ride towards the gates

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.000
and you see crowds of city guards

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
kind of blocking your way.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
You're going to have to run something over or something.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
Step on the gas.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Just a hazard style.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
Let's do it.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Alright, you step on the gas

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:27.000
and head forward with great speed.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
You knock down three of the guards

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:32.000
but then you go through the barrier

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:33.000
as if it wasn't even there

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
and blast out of the city gates.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
This is a metaphor for transgender.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Absolutely.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:39.000
I'm loving this.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:40.000
I don't want this lost on you.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
No, no, no, this is great.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
Onward, onward.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Onward.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
Yeah, we're free.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
We're free of the city.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
That's what you wanted to do.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Did we lose the police?

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
They're standing at the gates just watching you.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
You don't want to go out.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Did Admiral Darkstar notice that?

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Yeah, you quickly realize why.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
There's a large angel demon

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:07.000
who's now bearing down on you at incredible speeds.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
Ah, cheese and crackers.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
Bearing down on you.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
Admiral Darkstar.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
Yeeah!

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
You're never going to catch us.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
And that's a fact.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Is it?

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
Nice.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
Yes.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
He catches up to you.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
Yeah, but...

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
What seems to be the problem,

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
because we signaled...

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Is that Cannon?

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Yeah, yeah, he says that.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
I'm going to murder you!

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
All right, that's one thing we could do.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Listen.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
Admiral Darkstar.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
Sharpie.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
Long time enemy.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
First time conversation.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Actually, no.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
You remember when you were his mother?

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
All right.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
They never talked.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
It was a really dysfunctional home.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
That was evident.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
I don't think

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
that your goals

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
conflict with ours anymore.

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
I disagree!

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
Why two diaroles?

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
One for the...

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
They're opposed checks, Dan!

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
All right, okay, sorry.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
We don't have the shard of fucking thing.

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
We have stopped caring about that shit.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
What?!

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Yeah, that's right.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
I don't...

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
I want this to simultaneously offend you

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
and get us free from our relationship,

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
but we don't

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
care

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
about you anymore.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
He charges up

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
like Mega Man.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
Yeah, I can do that too.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
I charge up also like Mega Man.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
He breathes around his

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
form and he blasts

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
from his chest

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
a large humanoid figure

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
made of form and it plops onto the ground

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
by you guys

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
and gets up.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
It's all fiery and made of fire.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
What's his preferred pronoun?

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Oh.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Yeah.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Jillian.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
Do you ask it directly?

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
Well, we won't know that for a while, yeah.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Yeah.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
It's a fire guy.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
Fire guy. Getting to his feet.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
Friend or foe, fire guy?

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
How big is it?

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
It's a large size,

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
about eight feet tall, nine feet tall, I should say.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
Alright, honestly,

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
rabbit hunting with a tank.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
As they say in my culture.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
What's a tank?

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
It's an overkill.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
We don't have the shard.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Didn't you know that we're useful?

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
Right, exactly.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
So you're gonna die?

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Well, no.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
What is it about us that you don't like

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
in yourself that you see in us?

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
For real, like, seriously.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Because this has been going on way too long.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
Thank you.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
Are we too diverse a party?

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
Can you not really deal with how many different types of people we are?

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
That's really not it at all.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
Well,

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
so we just request passage

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
and we just, like, you have so much more energy

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
that you're gonna need to get the shard

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
from the town.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
Do we know where the shard is?

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
I mean, it still looks like in the ground

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
in the puddle or something.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
Speaking of which, you actually see

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
a dark force on the horizon.

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
You must have passed it

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
while you were coming out, but you're so

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
focused on leaving the town

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
that you just blazed right past it.

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
It's a large host of black

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
humanoid creatures, and upon closer inspection

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
they're actually darkened skeletons.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
They've been burned in ash,

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
and they're beaten on the walls,

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
the force fields of these doors

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
of the city are just

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
crowding around it.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
Not a great place to hang out.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
That's why we left. We don't like it there.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
There's a shard in there.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Also, was that

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
that bag of holding that you told us we shouldn't take out?

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
You left that in the downtown.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Okay, good. I just want to make sure.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
We have our passports.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
He's just standing.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
He looks like he's awaiting something.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
He's waiting for some sort of something.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Yeah, if it's all the same to you, Admiral,

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
we'll be on our way.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Give him the robot baby.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
That's a good call.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
Put the robot baby there

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
to intrigue him

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
and distract him, and then we'll run it.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
You see

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
from the city coming to town,

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
you see of this large dome

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
like force field popping out of the top

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
as it looks like the morning star

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
rising from the earth.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
It goes above

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
the force field, and you can see

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
the skeletons, they're kind of climbing up

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
on the top of the force field,

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
and they gather all around this shard

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
and in a crack of light, all of them

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
disappear all at once.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
And Admiral Darkstar is like,

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
What the fuck?

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
You!

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
I'm coming for you!

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
And he takes off,

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
leaving you with the fiery humanoid figure.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
All right.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
So how bad does this horse have to piss?

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Uh,

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
as bad as a racehorse.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
All right.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
So do your best.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Fiery figure.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
You command the horse to piss

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
and it's a well-trained mount, so it does.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
It pisses on the fiery leg

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
and knocks out one of its legs

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
for a short amount of time.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
It falls and stumbles to the ground, prone.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
Where are you from?

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Let's get out of here.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
I mean, what's, you know...

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Enough battles.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
What better way to express how we feel

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
than to leave?

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
To piss on the leg and leave.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Because, again,

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
we're saying,

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
we own you.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
You own yourself.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
Good luck on your adventures

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
with one leg.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
And so to us.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
All right.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
So on a horse, you can easily outpace

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
a one-legged fire elemental.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
And you've ride

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
and you ride until you find

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
what's the only light

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
in this dark place.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
It looks like it's coming from a hill,

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
like a hill with a light.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
We didn't have one moment to just celebrate.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
We fucking nailed it.

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
You left.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
We just walked away.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
This is why Judges and Dragons is better than a video game.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
We didn't have to stay there.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
We just left.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
He didn't expect us to do that.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
I didn't not expect that.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
He's got to deal with it now.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
But he respects it because he's a good dungeon master.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
We just left.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
That's what I wanted to hear.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
I am a good dungeon master.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
I don't know if we broke character to just do that.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
No, we didn't.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
To me, it's the most in-character I've ever ridden.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
I'm a coward.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
I don't want to die. I hate fighting.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
It hurts me.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
It's a weird quality for an adventurer.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
You're always been a reluctant adventurer.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
It's fine.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Adventurers come in various shapes.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
Have you ever seen me play a video game

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
or heard me talk about one?

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
Just Minecraft.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
I hide behind corners.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
I try to build up my stealth skill

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
to the point where I'm functionally invisible

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
and I can cheat.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
You'd make a great rogue.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
And I'm a wizard.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
It's a shame.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
I played rogues my whole life.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Do you feel like a rogue inside?

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
I identify as a rogue.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Maybe you should continue to sort of transition

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
into a cross-class sort of situation.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
I identify as a rogue.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
Maybe it's Christopher.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
I could help you with your transitioning.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
We are tasting the fruits

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
of our amazing decision

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
to walk away from all this bullshit.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
And you ride up to a large hill

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
that has a lit window in the hill,

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
inside of the hill.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:20.000
It's like a hobbit-hole kind of situation.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
That's what she said.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Sorry.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
I hope you come back

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
for another show, Bob.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Sorry about that.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
What do you think we should do?

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
I'm going to boldly go up

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
and look into this window.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
You see a woman showering.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
We get rewarded for everything this show.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
This is Toronto.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
Look at this woman.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
And she's clean.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
It's true.

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
Are you going to invite the rest of us

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
to see what you're seeing?

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Hey, guys, nothing to see back here.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
The home's empty.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
All right.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
I...

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
We're in a village?

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
No, this is the only dwelling

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
that you see that looks anything like this.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
There are some rolling hills

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
around, but nothing like that.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
Well, I guess I go up to the door and knock on it.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
You guys should just move on without me.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
I'm serious.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
I'm just going to knock on the door

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
and see if there's anything in my home.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
You knock on the door,

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
and there's no answer

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
as if someone was occupied inside.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Like you with the shower, for instance.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
It seems like

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
so whoever's in there is either not home

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
or...

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
doing something...

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
You wouldn't be interested.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
She's showering.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
It's not a bath.

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
Oh, she's showering.

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Well,

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
this is the first home we've come to in miles.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Should we go loot it?

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
I don't think we should.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
I mean, I don't think we should do that.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
You've been wanting to loot some things.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
No, I haven't.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
I don't know what you heard in the last podcast.

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
I must have been so drunk that...

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
I want to be a good person.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
I want to...

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
Did you see the documentary?

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
That's my shtick.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
I want to be a good person.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
I...

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
So, the door is...

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
I break in.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
Okay.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
I assume nobody's home.

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Yeah, you bust open the door

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
and you immediately are faced

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
with a woman showering.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
Oh, Jesus. Sorry, lady.

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
She screams.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
Okay, sorry, sorry.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
She screams.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
I'm sorry.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
I back out and I close the door.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
I go, sorry, I thought you were in danger.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
Did the rest of us hear the screaming?

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Oh, yeah, I mean, screaming.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
What did you do to her?

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
I close the door. I didn't do anything.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
I close the door.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
I go, sorry, just get out of the shower

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
and answer the door.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
In 10 minutes, that happens.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
What the fuck?

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
It's worse.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
Now that you trust me,

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
my friends and I would like to come in

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
and speak to you

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
about a matter of global import.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
Trust him.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
He doesn't have the same sex drive he used to.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
I see you as a beacon of light.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
Whoo!

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
That happens.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
All right, we sit at your table

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
and I say,

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
ma'am, do you know

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
the crack of Honduras?

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
I don't know. What are we doing?

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
Why did we go in?

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
I'm sorry.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
I'm a little peckish.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
Nice naked lady.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
She's not naked anymore.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Well,

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
I have fond memories of you when I first saw you,

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
so that's my nickname for you.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
So, nice naked lady.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
Do you have any food

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
that we could eat?

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
I mean, you guys

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
just kind of, like,

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
broke down my door,

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
then went back outside

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
and waited for me to answer it.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
It's a custom in my land.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
We didn't mean to.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
We're coming from a town that was overtaken by a demon.

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
I guess if it's a custom in your land.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
Oh, okay, right.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
What was the question?

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
We would like some food.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
Oh, yeah, totally.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Do you know if there's a place where we could

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
stay

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
far from here?

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
No.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
No.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
I'm, like, the closest place.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
The closest place?

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
Where are we?

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
We're just outside of Rosebook.

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
Oh, so we haven't gone too far.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
No, no.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
We should just get provisions and ride on.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
There's no adventure to be found here.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
I don't know.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
I think that she needs to understand that she...

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
Back off.

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
This is my gym.

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
I smoke a pipe full of

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
a traveler's weed.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
I don't think you have a pipe.

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
I have a pipe.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
I make a pipe out of her cabinet.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
All right, okay.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
Good one.

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
I smoke...

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
Well, you don't have any pipe weed, though.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
I smoke pipe weed

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
that I make out of

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
the cabinet.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Okay.

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
You cough horribly, terribly

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
as if you were breathing poison.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
Okay, and then I go...

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
Oh, kingdoms

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
come

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
and dungeons wait.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
That should be a good ending to the story.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
Because

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
adventurers

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
get out of my house.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
We're singing a song.

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
It's a special song. You're gonna like it.

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
Okay.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Wait.

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
You're the loot.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
Play the loot.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
This happens every time he smokes cabinet.

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
I think that's it.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
That's the conclusion of our adventure, right?

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
Yeah.

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
All right. Spencer, our dungeon master.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
Jillian.

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
Jillian, our

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
Digmy Stars guard.

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Jane, Jane.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
Jane, Jane, John.

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
Jane.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
Jane.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
Jane, our moonshine maker.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
And

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
an ambassador to the

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
realms unknown.

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
And Bobcat Goldwaite.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Thank you.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
Get Willow Creek.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
Like, freak yourself out.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
Oh, sure. Thank you.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Watch Willow Creek.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
Also, he's working on a documentary that's gonna blow your mind.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
But we don't need to promote that yet.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
But it's gonna fucking blow your mind.

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
All right. Well, thank you, Toronto.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
You've been absolutely

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
forgiving and pleasurable. Thank you.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:20.000
See you tonight.
