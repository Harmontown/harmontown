{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:15.000\nYeah, yeah, how are you tonight? Lovely downtown dynasty. Make some noise for the people at home.\n\n00:17.000 --> 00:25.000\nYeah, we need you to sound a little bit louder than you really are. Act as if we were all here tonight. Make some noise.\n\n00:25.000 --> 00:40.000\nAlright, I'll believe that, I'll believe that. Ladies and gentlemen, Superstar, Wonder Master, Game Master, Spencer Grinter!\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:55.000\nSo stop running at the mall. So stop running at the mall. I hope you paid your parking tickets. I hope you put your money down for the city. Cause you are out to pay. Cause we are all going to town.\n\n00:55.000 --> 01:13.000\nDown there at the home of... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, high pitch rapper, rapping at a high pitch. Fuck your mama cause her arm got nine stitches.\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:32.000\nI already went to a gross place immediately. A PZotomy. For the folks at home, what's an A PZotomy? I mean, I know what one is.\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:43.000\nThat's a world record for how gross it got. It was like right at the gross line, like coming off the starting block. My first step was gross.\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:49.000\nYeah, but you know the deal in order to freestyle. Well, you got to be brave. The PZotomy was a brave jumping off point.\n\n01:49.000 --> 02:04.000\nYou know what? I'm torn now. Okay. I'm a little... Sometimes I'm like, maybe not so much self-reflection. I watched my first AOC Instagram live. Have you seen her do her Instagram streams?\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:06.000\nI haven't. I have followed AOC.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:19.000\nShe apparently just... I watched it and it was genuinely inspiring. From an attitudinal standpoint, from a performative standpoint. It really doesn't matter what your politics are.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:36.000\nFor a politician to be like, I'm going to make a chicken dinner and talk shop. She wasn't spending the whole time going like, I'm sorry, was that racist? I don't know. You know what I'm saying?\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:50.000\nYou better believe she gets more trolls than I've ever had. I was just watching. Everyone's taking the hottest pot shots at her. Sorry if I hit you with a piece of popcorn.\n\n02:50.000 --> 03:02.000\nSee, she wouldn't say that. She'd be like, I got to get a new bowl for my chicken. She was just like... That's how collective bargaining will work for healthcare.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:16.000\nYou know what? I need a mixing bowl. She just had this calm... I was watching it and I'm like, she's not fucking around. She really does need that mixing bowl.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:29.000\nShe's smart enough to know that she's not... If there's 11 handlers off camera going like, no, no, no, not the mixing bowl. She'd have a million reasons to tailspin.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:39.000\nBut she's genuinely making a family dinner and just propped her phone up and she's like, okay, what's the next question? And then there's a million dudes going like, how much for a blue jug?\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:43.000\nAnd she's just like, I need a mixing bowl. It's fucking inspiring.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:49.000\nIt is. It is because you see that she really wants to do it. You're used to seeing politicians who don't want to do it.\n\n03:49.000 --> 04:02.000\nTo know that you're... I mean, what have we associated politics with throughout history? What is the problem with it? It's always that, oh, the kinds of people that aspire to it are exactly the kind of people you don't want to give that job to.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:03.000\nThat's right.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:13.000\nBecause they're pieces of shit. And maybe she's a piece of shit. I don't know much about her, but I'll tell you what. She knows how to fucking Instagram live.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:20.000\nI'll tell you, she's got that on me. I was like, man, I'm inspired. She's like the Joan of Arc of Instagram live.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:21.000\nYeah.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:31.000\nI've been trying. I asked myself while I work out in my Instagram live feed, what would AOC do right now? And I just think, get a mixing bowl.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:34.000\nLike, I just try to get the... Was that a fake laugh?\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:39.000\nOh, yeah. I got to do that these days.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:41.000\nIs it really that needed?\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:43.000\nNo, no. It's a real laugh.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:46.000\nHow are you, Spencer?\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:51.000\nOh, I'm so good. I'm not great. I'm fine. It's good.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:53.000\nAll right. Mixed signals.\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:55.000\nYeah. That's me, baby.\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:56.000\nYou need a mixing bowl?\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:57.000\nI was going to go there. Yeah.\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:58.000\nFor those signals?\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:01.000\nYeah. How do you think they got as such?\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:05.000\nWhy don't you go there on one of them?\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:06.000\nI might.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:07.000\nAll right.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:08.000\nOn my feelings?\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:09.000\nYeah.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:10.000\nOr my signals?\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:13.000\nYeah. Just one bad thing, one good thing.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:18.000\nOkay. One bad thing. I hate myself.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:24.000\nOkay. All right. We're going to have to skip the next question I lied. No. One good thing.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:31.000\nOne good thing. I don't know, man. Let's see. I guess it's not so mixed.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:34.000\nHow's it going with your...\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:36.000\nIt's just kind of a bowl of...\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:37.000\nIt's all in one.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:39.000\nYeah. It's all in just one...\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:41.000\nI was just wondering in the splash though.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:44.000\nNo, that was a vodka to go with the popcorn flake that flew off earlier.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:47.000\nWhat are you writing down? Are you...\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:48.000\nOh, no.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:49.000\nPopcorn.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:50.000\nShe sketches.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:51.000\nShe sketches.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:53.000\nOh, you're just drawing. How dare you.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:56.000\nThat's the opposite of writing. It's fine.\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:59.000\nDrawing can only ever be supportive.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:04.000\nLike, yeah. If you're writing, it's like it could go either way.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:06.000\nShe made me look like Post Malone.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:08.000\nI don't want any of this to get out.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:10.000\nDon't leave this room. Don't write anything down.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:11.000\nThis is between us.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.000\nYou could hand that to someone on a pony.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:17.000\nIt could be in Delaware by Wednesday.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:20.000\nMan, these hipsters, they reel old style.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:23.000\nThey come to your show. They don't take pictures for Instagram.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:24.000\nThey draw the shit.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:26.000\nThey hand it to a red coat.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:27.000\nRight.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:28.000\nThey hand it to a right brother.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:31.000\nAnd then there's a dirigible going to the Santa Barbara.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.000\nYou know, the next thing, you know.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:37.000\nOld Jed's a millionaire.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:42.000\nThat's all folks.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:45.000\nI was talking. I was talking.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:48.000\nI was realizing recently I have some deep seated issues\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:50.000\nwith my parents that I've been exploring.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:53.000\nOh, my therapist says I should get a haircut.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:56.000\nRight. Well, I so I wanted to ask you about your therapist.\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:58.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.000\nSo you don't let me stop you.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nFor those of you who are new to the podcast,\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:04.000\nSpencer's therapist is a bully.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:05.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:09.000\nHe just wants him to cut his hair because it's long.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:11.000\nIs that still happening?\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:16.000\nNo, I didn't see him for a month or longer\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:18.000\nbecause he had some stuff.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nI had some stuff, you know,\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:21.000\nhe had a rope he had to climb.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:22.000\nRight.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:25.000\nHe went to a therapist convention.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:27.000\nYou don't want that to happen.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:30.000\nI don't want therapists to get convincing.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:31.000\nYeah.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:34.000\nI always felt like I was when I was going to a chiropractor,\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:36.000\nhe was like, and he would go like,\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:38.000\noh, I can't do next week at the regular time.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:39.000\nI'm going to a convention.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:40.000\nRight.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:41.000\nA great, great.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:42.000\nYou're going to be,\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:44.000\nyou're going to go to nine seminars about how to,\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:47.000\nhow to fucking tell me that my foot limpness has to do\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:50.000\nwith whether I should eat Cheetos.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:51.000\nFucking garbage.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:53.000\nYou're going to like start making me fill out\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:55.000\nnew Xerox forms that you got for free\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:57.000\nfrom some fucking dude in hall H.\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:00.000\nGoing to be poking you with his other hand or something.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:02.000\nBut did your therapist come come back\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:03.000\nwith a different attitude?\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:04.000\nYeah.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:05.000\nHe was like, your hair is great.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:06.000\nOh.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:07.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:08.000\nGod damn it.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:09.000\nYou got to be excited.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:10.000\nBecause that's what I was thinking,\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:11.000\nis that he would go to a convention,\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nmaybe it's his first one in four years or something,\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nand then he'd go to a seminar and be like,\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:19.000\nhey, stop telling your customers to cut their hair.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:20.000\nYeah.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:21.000\nThat's like not cool.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:22.000\nYeah.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:23.000\nWell, I don't know.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nMy friend has a therapist who,\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:29.000\nshe says, subscribes to that simulation theory of the world,\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:32.000\nwhich I don't know that there's a lot of religious beliefs\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nthat you don't want a therapist to have,\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:37.000\nbut it's all a simulation is probably like,\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:38.000\nit's got to be one of the worst.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:40.000\nIt just seems really fucked up to me.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:41.000\nYeah.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:43.000\nLike, oh, you know what you got to do?\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:44.000\nA cheat code.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:45.000\nWhat?\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:49.000\nJust getting to hacking.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:52.000\nBut no, no, one of my therapists said,\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:55.000\nI don't know.\n\n08:55.000 --> 09:01.000\nHe asked me about my social life a lot,\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nand he's because the first time I came in,\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:05.000\nI was like really depressed about a girl,\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:08.000\nand I was just bummed out and it was bummed me out,\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:11.000\nand that's one of the reasons why I started seeing a therapist.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:14.000\nAnd so since then, he's been asking me about my social life,\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:19.000\nbut I always take that as like a transition into talking about my hair.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:21.000\nSo I've been trying to like be like, oh, it's great.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:22.000\nOh, went to the beach.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nOh boy.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:27.000\nWhich I don't think is a good use of therapy, you know.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:30.000\nBy the way, there's no guests tonight, so fuck off.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:32.000\nIn a way, we're all the guests.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:35.000\nLet's bring out Spencer's therapist.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.000\nGod, that would be a damn bully.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:38.000\nWe should book him.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:39.000\nThat would be cool.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:40.000\nWell, I don't know.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:43.000\nIt would be hostile, but it would be interesting to just ask him questions\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:45.000\nlike it was a real person.\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:47.000\nWhen he asks you about your social life,\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:48.000\nis he what is he saying?\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\nIs he asking where you go?\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nIs he trying to fucking hang?\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:53.000\nWhat is he?\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:54.000\nHe's trying to hang.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:58.000\nNo, I think that I think he's just wanting to know like what I'm doing.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:01.000\nLike because I think you even have any friends.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:02.000\nThat's what it's a picture.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:06.000\nYour therapist is like a bad guy from an 80s ski movie.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:07.000\nYeah.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:08.000\nDo you even have any friends?\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:09.000\nWhy don't you get a haircut?\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:10.000\nYeah, man.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:13.000\nMaybe you'd have more fun if you cut your fucking hair, bro.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:14.000\nWho do you know here?\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:16.000\nWho do you know at this therapist office?\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:21.000\nMy therapist started asking me a shower more as I shared,\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:25.000\nbut then also like which I have started doing because I have a pool now.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:28.000\nSo now I just shower more and I have like a better shower.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:32.000\nI have like one of those showers where you just like there's less difference\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:34.000\nbetween the shower and the bathroom.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:38.000\nSo it just feels more like, you know, like a fancy hotel.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:39.000\nYou can walk right in.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:43.000\nYeah, you walk in and you go pshh and it goes pshh and you go pshh.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:45.000\nYou start peeing.\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:46.000\nYeah.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:49.000\nInstead of like step over it.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:50.000\nSomething like that.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:53.000\nYou get in that tub that poor people tub and it's like,\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:57.000\nand the fucking shower heads just like pshh.\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:59.000\nAnd you're like,\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:06.000\nAnd instead of, this is like a big booth and you just,\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:09.000\nI can just stand behind the shower head and be like pshh.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:10.000\nBe as cold as you want.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:12.000\nYou fucking shit fuck.\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:13.000\nOkay.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:14.000\nI'll talk to you when you're hot.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:16.000\nAnd then I'm like, you're too hot.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:20.000\nI'll talk to you when you're fucking the temperature of my mom's womb.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:24.000\nToo soon, too late.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:26.000\nToo soon.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:30.000\nAnd then I'm just,

I'm the cleanest nerd in the world.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:38.000\nI guess I'm your worst nightmare.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:42.000\nWell, can I be, can I be the president now?\n\n11:42.000 -->

took it too far when you said wrap.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:05.000\nYeah.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:07.000\nAnother thing my therapist started saying though,\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:11.000\nand this troubles me, is my therapist started saying at the end of the sessions,\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:16.000\nshe now goes, so what do you want to do?\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:19.000\nSo next week, two weeks.\n\n12:19.000 -->

paid.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:44.000\nFuck off, you fat jerk.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:50.000\nOkay, but again, I think that's awesome to graduate.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:53.000\nI know, but it feels also, I feel terrified.\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:56.000\nI'm like, no, mama, I need to come back every week.\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:57.000\nI'm moving.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:58.000\nI got all kinds of problems.\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:01.000\nWhat if something doesn't spark joy?\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:02.000\nAnd that's true.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:05.000\nMy shit's like, I still have shit that maybe I haven't told you yet.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:06.000\nYeah.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:07.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:16.000\nI want to like beef it up at the end of a season of law and order, just like throwing.\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:19.000\nBy the way, I'm an alcoholic.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:20.000\nRight.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:22.000\nJerry Orbeck's got a problem.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:23.000\nDonner killed himself.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:28.000\nI just want to turn to her and be like, okay, so now here's the real me.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:29.000\nYeah.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:30.000\nAfter like four years of seeing.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:32.000\nThat would be amazing at the end of it.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:33.000\nThank you so much.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:34.000\nYeah.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:35.000\nI think I'll do two weeks from now.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:38.000\nI've always been British.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:42.000\nYou're a terrible therapist.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:44.000\nYou did not pick up my accent.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:50.000\nYou never knew I wasn't British.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:52.000\nI want a therapist react to that.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:56.000\nSo they'd be like, oh, you get some money back.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:57.000\nYou're right.\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:58.000\nI'm not that good.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:03.000\nI've been treating you as an American, which means that I don't know who you are.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:09.000\nSo that would be like finding a finding out your doctor's stethoscope didn't work.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:12.000\nI've been British the whole time.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:13.000\nLove.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:22.000\nI'm not qualified to check your prostate the entire time.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:23.000\nAll right.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:32.000\nUber updated its app and the the reckoning is upon us.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:39.000\nThere's now when you order a ride, a thing comes up and it says something I've always\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:40.000\ndreamt of.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:44.000\nIt says like, okay, and what's your conversation preference?\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:48.000\nYou can you can say I want I want to quiet or I want to chatty.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:49.000\nWhat?\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:50.000\nYeah.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:55.000\nSo like the two settings are like, keep it quiet or I don't mind it.\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:57.000\nI don't mind to chat something like that.\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:58.000\nWhich one are you?\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:04.000\nWell, 90% of the time quiet, but then but and I always wanted that.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:07.000\nI've always said, I think a lot of people have always said, by the way, could you add a fucking\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:08.000\nbutton?\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:13.000\nYou've said that I was gonna say yeah, like add a button that says just to let you know\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nbefore you even accept the fare.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:17.000\nI'm not I don't want to make a friend tonight.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.000\nI don't want to hear about your podcast.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:23.000\nI don't want to fucking like I don't want you to question my fucking left turns and right\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:24.000\nturns.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:25.000\nI don't want you to.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:26.000\nI could imagine for the ladies.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:27.000\nMaybe there's a whole thing there.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:30.000\nIt's like, don't fucking talk to me.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:35.000\nAnd and finally now there's a button there, but now now I'm filled with anxiety because\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nI'm always like, I hit that button.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:42.000\nAnd then I'm like, I keep thinking, well, one of these days I'm going to hit a, oh,\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:46.000\nmaybe I'll have like just taken an Adderall an hour earlier.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:47.000\nOh, shit.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:49.000\nAnd I'm like, I'm just kind of like in a high mood.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:51.000\nAnd I'm like, you know what?\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:57.000\nOh, I don't mind having a little chitty chat and like like the tyranny of that now for\n\n15:57.000 --> 16:01.000\nthe for a driver who would normally like the Jason Statham transporter out there who's\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:03.000\nlike, I have two rules.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:04.000\nLove.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:05.000\nI don't know.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:06.000\nYou don't bug me.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:07.000\nI don't bug you.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:09.000\nOh, just pick up.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:10.000\nYeah.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:11.000\nTake you from him.\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:14.000\nAnd then they like get the fare and they're like, it's like wouldn't wouldn't mind a little\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:15.000\nchat.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:18.000\nLike, oh, like, you don't want to punish somebody.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:21.000\nThey're like, like force somebody to like be driving.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:23.000\nAnd like, how's the weather?\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.000\nAnd God damn it.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:26.000\nFuck this.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:27.000\nYeah.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:30.000\nOr to be stuck with the sin bad of overdrivers.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:33.000\nShe's like, oh, I'm a Lassianica jokes.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:35.000\nMy San Vicente jokes.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:37.000\nHey, ma'am, here we go by pigs.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:41.000\nYou know, pigs is a hot dog seller.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:43.000\nI don't want to be in the car with that dude.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:44.000\nYeah.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:49.000\nThey could have just been like a normal or just give me a fucking minute.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:56.000\nYou know, instead of like, you got to be talking, man, talk.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:57.000\nYou better.\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:58.000\nYes.\n\n16:58.000 --> 16:59.000\nAnd me, doll.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:00.000\nBecause it's not.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:03.000\nI don't know who's requesting chattiness.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:07.000\nIt just seems like, you know, it's like I today my mom died.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:08.000\nI don't want to talk to anybody.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:11.000\nThat didn't happen to me, but it's like that's the circumstance.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:15.000\nAnd no one's like, hmm, how am I feeling like cordial?\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:20.000\nWell, the weird thing is the air one because it's like chat preferences and there's probably\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:21.000\nlike music preferences.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:26.000\nAnd there's one of those like air preferences and the choices are hot.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:30.000\nWho's choosing hot?\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:37.000\nWarm, cool, cold and no preference.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:45.000\nLike it kind of that's weird because it makes you it forces someone who ordinarily your\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:49.000\ndefault choice would be like, well, wait a minute, I want you to be accountable to the\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:56.000\nlivability of the temperature of your right of your of your cabin.\n\n17:56.000 --> 18:01.000\nBut that the only choice for a person that feels that way is no preference, which is\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:06.000\nit's a weird thing to say about your the temperature of a car you're getting to no preference.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:08.000\nWell, I do have a preference.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:10.000\nI hope it's not cold.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:11.000\nRight.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:13.000\nI also hope it's not hot.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:18.000\nThere is no selection in other words that just says room temperature.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:19.000\nRight.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:22.000\nIt's no preference, which to me is like undecided.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nI'm the Ken Bone of temperature.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:28.000\nI still haven't made up my mind.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:31.000\nLike, give me what you got.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:32.000\nI'm adorable.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:38.000\nI just I'm just here to feel things out like how will I know if I'm not exposed to all\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:44.000\nthe elements like and then they might feel like I need to like blast you with boy, what\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:46.000\na shitty episode this is.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:50.000\nI mean, that's really I think that's all I got honestly.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:52.000\nI don't know what we're going to do.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:56.000\nIt's fucked up that somebody could get in your car and be like, I'm hot and I told you\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:58.000\nto shut up.\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:04.000\nThis is this is this is my checklist that says quiet preferred button Uber and AOC chicken\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:05.000\ndinner.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:08.000\nThat's my that's my those are my notes.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:09.000\nI didn't I didn't guys.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:13.000\nI I thought that was two hours of oh well.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:15.000\nWell, we're freestyling now.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:16.000\nAll right.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:17.000\nNo net.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:18.000\nGood.\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:19.000\nWe don't need no fucking no.\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:20.000\nHow are you?\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:25.000\nHow is your clothes?\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:28.000\nGod damn it.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:30.000\nThey're lovely.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:35.000\nWhat'd you do this weekend?\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:43.000\nI I forced myself to go to my old house and grab some stuff that I felt like was worth\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.000\nbringing over to my new house.\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:48.000\nI'm like living in a big empty house.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:54.000\nCody and I are like living in this unfurnished house sleeping on a mattress on the floor\n\n19:54.000 --> 20:00.000\nand it's kind of like we keep joking like oh maybe we maybe maybe this is a new lifestyle\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:02.000\nlike no furniture.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:07.000\nThere is a decorator that the will eventually be furnishing the place but in the meantime\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:13.000\nwe're kind of like what are we supposed to it's usually when you move your you got a\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:18.000\ncouch at your old place you're going to bring it to your new place because number one usually\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:24.000\nyour old place is not going to stay your place and you all also don't want to buy a new couch\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:30.000\nso I don't think I have to explain this to you guys but I have to explain it to you because\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:36.000\nyou have to understand it's not the case with me like I'm keeping my old house and I don't\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:42.000\nwant any of the furniture in it at my new place because number one I'm probably going to rent\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:49.000\nmy old house right so I'm not gonna I may not rent it unfurnished because you don't rent\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:55.000\na house with no furniture I don't think you can do both it could do both I lived in a\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:59.000\nrented house once that was unfurnished because it was like oh I'm gonna rent this place\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:04.000\nyearly so there is that but then there's also the more like the kind of like upscale\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:10.000\nlike hey this is this place is ready to go Leo de Caprio's nephew who's in town for a\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:15.000\nyear and he has money to burn and just like I don't know if there's there's like a market\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:21.000\nfor that and that market may depend on oh just keep the furniture that's there at any rate\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:24.000\nI'm not going to throw the furniture in the garbage right but I'm not going to move it\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:28.000\nto the new place and I'm not gonna and it's just like it's just like the house is just\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:34.000\nfilled with shit and we were talking about this last night like it's like you start to\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:40.000\nrealize usually it's forced upon you because you're your mood you got to get out of your\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:45.000\nold place so that shit's you got to go through that shit anyway but if you don't have to\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:50.000\ngo through it if it's sitting there you're kind of like oh you just start to realize\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:56.000\nyour whole life represents decisions that you delayed that's what your house is full\n\n21:56.000 --> 22:03.000\nof is shit that you put off thinking about that's what's on every shelf is like piles\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:10.000\nof paper that like may or may not be valuable they weren't so obviously garbage that it\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:17.000\nwas joyful to throw them away but they also definitely aren't like oh old man withers\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:23.000\nspecial paper that he gave me to oh yeah close to my heart and it's like you're now\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:30.000\nlike forced to I got to either throw this shit out or I got to bring it I got to act\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:35.000\nlike I'm proud of it and bring it over to my place I don't want to do either and it kind\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:41.000\nof it makes me like wake up in an unfurnished house every morning and go what should I do\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:46.000\ntoday let's say on the weekend is like there could be a million answers to that if you're\n\n22:46.000 -->

new Britney Spears\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:04.000\nwhere it's like all the homeless people are wearing Rick and Morty shirts the creator\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:11.000\ngave me this man this was dumped off in a U-Haul at the Goodwill and like everyone's\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:19.000\njust like pickle Rick I could actually undercut my own cottage industry by doing that here\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:27.000\nso the irony if you should ever become homeless and then I end up you're down there wearing\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:34.000\na Rick and Morty shirt and you say same guy give it to you gave it to me maybe you

your dad's house I think you're\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:54.000\non to something there brandy is that all under the category of that's where the state sale\n\n24:54.000 --> 25:06.000\nis okay so I could pretend I died and that I'm my own uncle or something like that like\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:19.000\nyou can be you can be whoever you want you could be like I do like a Marvin Gaye's dad\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:32.000\nI can't I'm out of bail I shot my son would you like his bedspread I gotta make bail why\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:38.000\nprice is so low prices is so low because I gotta make bail by the way if you're listening\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:42.000\nand you're part of the Marvin Gaye family I'm sorry so sorry that's I that's it the\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:46.000\nnew I tell you you can't you can't joke about anything like everyone's counting now they're\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:56.000\ncounting that blurred lines money for the folks at home what's the Marvin Gaye family\n\n25:56.000 --> 26:01.000\ndoing well I don't know what the Marvin Gaye family is doing but you know what have they\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:05.000\ndone you know Marvin Marvin Gaye was a singer classic was he in the Commodores what was\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:10.000\nit no no he was his own thing he was Marvin Gaye and Tammy Terrell it was a Motons you\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:17.000\nknow a staple until he shot his son his dad's dad's oh he was jealous jealous dad his dad\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:21.000\nshot him because he stood up to his father his father had been abusive to his mom sure\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:25.000\nfor years then the Marvin fell on some hard times had to move back in with the parents\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:31.000\nwas like you can't keep talking to mom like that especially now that I've been famous\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:36.000\nthat's fucking a break yeah then was like laying down asleep and his dad came in and\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:45.000\nwas like I shot him man see family is the worst right right probably not a controversial\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:52.000\nopinion but what a shitty dad yeah well you know I don't want to go I don't want to you\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:59.000\nknow play the devil's advocate here but I'm on his but sometimes kids can be a drag as\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:04.000\nthough you're sometimes you want to you want to be mean to your wife you can't have people\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:10.000\ntelling you not to do that yeah I mean yeah I was supposed to do listen to them you're\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:14.000\na product of the twisted relationship between me and your mother how dear you condemn it\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:21.000\nright that's almost like saying I'm doing something wrong sort of say shout out to all\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:26.000\nthe dudes who punch their dads in the face for some shit like that hell yeah hope you\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:34.000\ndon't get shot right I wonder what the statistics are is there a word for is there a side you\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:43.000\nknow cide prefects for you know we have patricide matricide we have infanticide fratricide what\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:53.000\nis there is there a side I think it's for killing your offspring yeah okay if you say\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:58.000\ninsecticide I'm gonna come out there you're like a evil villain with a bow tie I'm the\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:09.000\nword miser are you looking for something I've got it I will not explain I'll nearly acknowledge\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:20.000\nits existence you have 20 questions do you know the word no you're just starting you're\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:25.000\njust you're just voting confidence in the English language you're like look I know old lady\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:40.000\nEnglish has got it it's a different guy but there our audience is just I mean you got to\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:47.000\nmake your own fun in this episode I agree like don't rush anything I am on your side it's\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:56.000\nthe same prefects when you know nephra nephra side I love which is also which is the wikipedia\n\n28:56.000 --> 29:10.000\nsays fill a side what's that fi li side fill aside motherfucker nephra side we know what that\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:18.000\nreally means it's the next episode nephra side it's also possible it could be both right\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:22.000\nlike I mean yeah yeah there's plenty of words but he had arrogance that made it sound like\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:34.000\nit could only be one and that was a mistake aside so hack why is it speaking of language\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:44.000\nevolving I think it is that I will never use an emoji but I will constantly use animated\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:52.000\ngifts like like what is that about me do you use emoticons I have you know I won't use emoticons\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:59.000\nwhen I was growing up that emoticons were the beginning of it was like people using\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:08.000\ncolon and a parenthesis to indicate a smile or a frown we were like the the the the purists\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:15.000\namong us for like that was like how dare you like if you can't communicate your state\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:21.000\nor your position or whether I should take you seriously without like reverting to the\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:29.000\nape-like behavior that chased us here to this haven like why are you bringing that here it\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:37.000\nwas like people would do ascii roses in chat rooms you know here's a rose classic yeah I\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:44.000\nmean I you know the heroes among us hated those people and then the emoji came along\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:51.000\nyeah why do a why do emoticons when you can do an emoji and I can't I won't touch it I\n\n30:51.000 --> 31:00.000\nwon't do it I also won't type lol I'll only type haha I don't understand what my definition\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:06.000\nof of those boundaries are and I especially don't understand why I think animated gifts\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:11.000\nare the fucking greatest things on sliced bread yeah I think that's amazing that I don't\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:17.000\nthink it is whether it's ironic or sincere like I'll I'll like I'll just throw you an\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:23.000\nimage of Jim Carrey going I I likey likey like whatever like I don't I don't I don't\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:29.000\nsuffer a moment of indecision about it I don't think I'm selling out it's like 50 cent\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:35.000\nlike fucking smiling and then driving away and then birds in the backseat I don't I love\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:39.000\nit all yeah they're genius because the little mini movies that you can throw at somebody\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:46.000\nwhy is that why does that meet my definition of classy or like what hip or what is it it's\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:53.000\na chance at sarcasm like never before I don't know I did like like is it is it because\n\n31:53.000 --> 32:01.000\nemo if you if you send an emoji what you're doing is is your is it is about inductive\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:05.000\nversus deductive like I kind of like the shape of the telescope like you're looking through\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:09.000\nthe image and like if I send Oprah if you say something to me and I send you an image of\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:17.000\nOprah going like it's more up to you what that means and that therefore I'm like I'm\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:23.000\nnot I'm kind of like being more creative by choosing that Oprah picture well I think that\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:28.000\nmemes are I mean gifts are basically just memes so it's essentially like responding\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:32.000\nwith like a can joke like that's what she said you know it's like you're being clever\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:37.000\nusing cultural context you're kind of hacking more than you are participating right whereas\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:43.000\nemojis are just simply like you're just crudely depicting certain concepts using images instead\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:49.000\nof words when you could easily use words so it's essentially language whereas a gif is\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:54.000\nmore of like it's it's it's more of like a joke or something but I think easily that's\n\n32:54.000 --> 33:00.000\njust a matter of I mean you're I appreciate you saying that but you probably know that\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:04.000\ntotally a subjective thing than that and oh shit number of these kids would be like that's\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:09.000\nexactly what I do when I send an eggplant emoji or right or even a smiling emoji using\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:14.000\nthose characters like they're they're creating a language using these new symbols they're\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:18.000\nessentially new letters but you know that's like creating their own meaning and so you\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:22.000\ncould like do the jack-off thing and that's maybe a step removed but that's different\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:26.000\nthan like the sweating in the hand which are just letters you know whereas I think you're\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:31.000\ncommunicating the full idea when you share a meme or a gif it's like it's again more like\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:36.000\na joke and it is almost like it's almost like albums to DJs so like certain people have\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:44.000\nincredible collections of gifts and like and memes so if you're like if you're pet if\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:48.000\nyou're petty like myself and you're online and you're you're flaming and you're going\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:53.000\nback and forth with somebody if they have like a just a fucking Pokemon ball size or\n\n33:53.000 --> 34:05.000\ncollection I don't play Pokemon because I met girls and shit was half laugh and half\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:12.000\nbald up fists and I respect you all for that but some people have like an arsenal of just\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:18.000\nlike images to throw at you and also okay so maybe this is what's key about it is that\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:25.000\nwith the emoji library that you're choosing from you're not choosing from a circulated\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:36.000\ncabin of air there's a cultural tint to an animated gif library even if because I'm not\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:43.000\ngoing to lie I don't I don't curate a fucking folder of awesome gifts and make them and\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:51.000\nstuff but people do and because people do it's kind of a little closer to sending a piece\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:57.000\nof wall graffiti that because there's a culture out there of people who are continuously\n\n34:57.000 --> 35:04.000\nupdating and circulating images pulling them from TV shows and things and if you're drawing\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:11.000\nfrom that pile you're at least drawing from something more vibrant than the idea of Pepsi\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:18.000\nor something to you here's the 109 images to choose from this fiscal quarter here's how\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:22.000\nhere's how you say I'm going swimming it's a drawing of a guy going swimming but over\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:29.000\nhere it's like like here's the latest in in but but where it fails is where it's like\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:36.000\npeople can use gifts to be just as banal and horrendously enforcing of like horrible toxic\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:42.000\nlike I remember when when Megan Gans was like like like reaching out to me on Twitter and\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:47.000\ngoing like you hurt me or whatever and like the the people that were like all the popcorn\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:51.000\ngifts of people eating popcorn and then other people going like you're gross like like\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:56.000\nthat's this is a gross time for that what the fuck what I'm eating popcorn right and\n\n35:56.000 --> 36:04.000\nit was like that is like the same sickening thing that emojis do it reduces us to yeah\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:12.000\nlike keys on a keyboard and but the the healthy idea of it is what did you just say and then\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:16.000\nyou like you just you're pulling you can you can type words into the little Giffy engine\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:21.000\nbut it's still like okay here's Steve Carell like getting a pint his face or something\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:26.000\nbut what's cool about the like gifts and memes is that like you have to pick it yourself\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:30.000\nwhich means you have to like know it exists like these days you can search for like\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:34.000\nkeywords or whatever and get one but like it's an artistic decision to pick one that\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:38.000\nyou think fits best and that's also very much like me meaning where it's like there's a\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:42.000\nbunch of different things that are kind of this basic joke but you pick this one because\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:47.000\nit's the most applicable whereas I'll type like I'll type like I went there right into\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:53.000\nGiffy and then it'll come up yeah and that's how I discovered that 50 cent like dry it's\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:58.000\nlike he's not saying I went there as he's driving away but it's like that's what comes\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:02.000\nup when you type I went there or whatever and then I like and then Cody and I discovered\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:08.000\nthat and then we have a relationship with that gift like we keep on sending 50 cent to\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:13.000\neach other like driving it's like an old meme and you can look up the origin of it and\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:18.000\nlike all the then people add like Bert in the back seat as he's driving away and stuff\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:22.000\nyeah. Yeah but I don't think emoji has that I think you can kind of get there but it's\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:26.000\njust at the end of the day it's just like this means man this means hand this means\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:31.000\ndollar bills you know and this means I'm talking to you like this so like it's all the most\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:36.000\nobnoxious shit. Who has ever done that? The worst is the fucking crying thing it's like\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:42.000\nit's like I just oh yeah the crying laughing it just makes me so fucking mad that it's\n\n37:42.000 --> 37:48.000\nit's like taking the LOL phenomenon which is like like like people just type LOL or\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:54.000\nROFL or LMA like it's just it's just such a nervous twitch that everyone wants\n\n37:54.000 --> 38:00.000\neveryone to know they're laughing at them condescendingly it's so fucking toxic I fucking\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:05.000\nhate it like like if you're gonna condescend to someone you should know how to condescend\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:11.000\nnot tell them you're condescending it's fucking horse shit that you can raise a flag while\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:16.000\nyou're talking going by the way I'm condescending to you no you're not allowed to you don't\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:23.000\nhave the words. Yeah it does kind of feel like LOL would be like executed like LOL.\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:28.000\nIt's like holding up a photo of Frasier like while you're talking by the way I'm super\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:35.000\nsmart right and from Seattle no you're not put that down. That would be cool I like\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:40.000\nlike you're not allowed to do that that's that's that's one of the big it's like it's\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:44.000\nlike fucking like that I guess that's me like really shaking my cane it was like in my\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:51.000\nday you could really you had to be a genuinely condescending person they would had to be\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:56.000\nin your fucking veins you couldn't just like go get your mail and be like oh I wish I was\n\n38:56.000 --> 39:01.000\none of those condescending types and then and then just be like oh these letters and\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:05.000\nthen condescending and like you're not no you're not you're a sincere hillbilly you're\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:10.000\nnot condescending at all you're an idiot you can't condescend to anything but maybe\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:14.000\nlike a termite that's eating your garage that you could be like I'm gonna get you\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:22.000\nlm lmao it's it's because there's a printing price now so yeah I mean these are the frustration\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:26.000\nthat's the thing that's making me real I'm like I'm only I'm only expressing the\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:31.000\nfrustrations that the fucking status quo expressed to Gutenberg yeah when he\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:41.000\nprinted police academy whoa yeah when the when the when Martin Luther was like I\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:53.000\nI have a dream that Bibles should be in German instead of Latin I don't think these I don't\n\n39:53.000 --> 40:01.000\nknow if these hilarious historical mix them up sir I don't know if they're they're\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:04.000\nnot landing because you don't get them you're just sort of like why are you doing\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:11.000\nwhat are these

a new concept the deaf jam thing and Schrab and I was\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:08.000\nvery young and I I went out was like yeah I just played to my whiteness and\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:12.000\nlike the Milwaukee black crowd was like totally respectful and supportive because\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:16.000\nI was like I was totally cheap and was like look at me I'm the white guy but\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:20.000\nthere was like there was like that I remember there was this old guy that\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:26.000\ncame out was like just he had no it was like he didn't know from he didn't there\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:30.000\nwas like deaf jam I don't it doesn't he just came out and did this crazy like\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:35.000\nCatskills act and he was like have you folks heard of spoonerisms and and I\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:39.000\nwould know what is happening and he was like a spoonerism was what and he\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:42.000\nexplained what a spoonerism was and then he was like and I have a spoonerism\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:51.000\nstory and then he told the story of Finder cella and her pleb pisters whatever\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:55.000\nI can't do it's like he just went through the story of Cinderella but like mixing\n\n41:55.000 --> 42:01.000\nthe letters and she was Cinder fellow yeah how did it oh how did it go over it\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:08.000\nwas it was it was so weird it was just it was just like people weren't heckling\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:14.000\nbecause it's Milwaukee and they were like they were polite and like it was like\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:19.000\na working-class crowd that was just like who's this old dude like why is he doing\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:22.000\nthis what is he doing I don't understand what's happening is he having a stroke\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:28.000\nlike what what why is he doing this like what is Finder cella gonna eat some\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:34.000\npussy like I it's a big jam night at an already shitty comedy club like what\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:40.000\nare we what are we doing here why are we here oh great if that had happened and\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:45.000\nthe guy just finished yeah I think they were waiting they were they were like I\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:49.000\ndon't want to be like set up like in the middle he goes like and then he ate some\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:54.000\npussy and does a backflip and like starts playing the violin with his balls and\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:59.000\nlike everyone's like see I was on his side from the beginning but he just\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:07.000\nfinished up and it was like and then he got in a hearse and drove into a pit the\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:10.000\nweird thing is we had never it was Milwaukee so you think you know everybody\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:13.000\nand that this guy just came out of nowhere I think he might have been a\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:20.000\nghost yeah I think his his hair might have been snakes like you go to his agent\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:24.000\nand go hey what was with that guy did you book him in the wrong room that guy\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:32.000\ndied 30 years ago if you listen closely you can still hear his act in all black\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:41.000\nrooms why is that ghost up here again why did he do that it's not the\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:46.000\nresponse you want from an audience I'm just still stuck on this Finder cella\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:52.000\nbecause I realized that the reason it's Finder cella is because you have to put\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:56.000\nthe F in there otherwise there's nothing to spoonerize because it would just be\n\n43:56.000 --> 44:01.000\nInder cella which is just nothing like that's spoonerizing with a non present\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:08.000\nletter yeah I I don't know what to do with the old cube\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:16.000\nwhat was wrong with the old cube it was small okay I don't like the reaction\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:22.000\nthat got it made me feel insecure well

44:42.000\nmanaged to get to the new place and and why like what did you need that you were\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:47.000\nlike I gotta stop fucking around I need knives we can I tell one more story from\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:51.000\nthat stand we'll get this remember like there's so I have so much sense memory\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:54.000\nof that that particular club I can't remember its name but

like it was a different\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:09.000\nanyone please come and I remember there was this magician and he came there early\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:14.000\nand I was like I'm gonna do my shitty stand-up act and this magician who just\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:18.000\nlike he was one of two magicians in Milwaukee and he was a constant presence\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:26.000\nat every every open mic and

was the reason why he was making me sit somewhere and he's\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:38.000\nlike just watch this is what's this and then I was like like that's cool like\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:46.000\nthis so the strings are just on your rings or whatever he was like he fucking\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:56.000\nI've never seen a human being like he was like because he had asked me to sit like\n\n46:56.000 -->

not trying to be a dick I swear no not at all because you\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:51.000\nwere in love with the actual ballet of the whole situation because you know\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:55.000\nweren't

presupposition was that one tribe\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:45.000\nwas gonna win out and what's funny is that they like I was there for the\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:50.000\nkaraoke machines being rolled in one by one and it was like it used to be\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:55.000\ncomedy versus darts it was like it was like like like my friend Sean McKenna\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:59.000\nat the at the LA freeway which

you can't play darts and it was like it was true it was\n\n53:08.000 --> 53:11.000\nlike that was the big problem with it it was like well there's a microphone in\n\n53:11.000 --> 53:16.000\nfront of the dartboard so and and then but then five years later it was like\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:21.000\nthey're just these dudes with mustaches like rolling in with these dollies of\n\n53:21.000 -->

it\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:39.000\nwas like the fuck is this a year later done everyone get yeah why would the\n\n53:39.000 --> 53:46.000\nHoliday Inn next to the airport ever want a fucking alcoholic slob to\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:51.000\nberate the people waiting in the lobby if they can replace them for 20% less\n\n53:51.000 --> 53:57.000\nwith a fucking music machine that lets them sing I will survive like they will\n\n53:57.000 --> 54:01.000\nmake them come in by the drums it was just like this crazy boogie nights thing\n\n54:01.000 --> 54:06.000\nof like oh you've been replaced with joy

screaming stereotype give me your wisdom\n\n56:21.000 --> 56:27.000\nwell I don't have that much I'm just a I'm just an eye cloud of tropes that Dan\n\n56:27.000 --> 56:36.000\nHarmon got from fivemovies I thought it would be eat eat laxatives and get off my\n\n56:36.000 --> 56:41.000\nlife but that is the thing like think I mean that like they were like western\n\n56:41.000 --> 56:46.000\nculture you go like what that's what we totally deny ourselves we deny ourselves\n\n56:46.000 --> 56:50.000\nthe right I was I was on Duncan Trussell's podcast recently and we talked a lot\n\n56:50.000 --> 56:55.000\nabout the right to change your mind how we punish it how yeah that is true like\n\n56:55.000 --> 57:01.000\nlike like like we especially like like we definitely do not want and it's\n\n57:01.000 --> 57:05.000\nsomething that that occurred to me is like all the endless debate and\n\n57:05.000 --> 57:09.000\ninvestigation that we commit to the idea of nature versus nurture which is totally\n\n57:09.000 --> 57:15.000\nvalid like that's of course that's a totally like that's of academic interest\n\n57:15.000 --> 57:21.000\nnature or nurture did your mom's genes make you a serial killer or was it the\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:27.000\nthing your mom made you eat but either way it was your mom exactly either way it\n\n57:27.000 --> 57:32.000\nwasn't you either way it wasn't you and that's the thing that we it's profound\n\n57:32.000 --> 57:36.000\nhow much we debate about nature versus nurture but we don't debate about will\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:41.000\nversus free will that much you have to like sign up for a weird unmarketable\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:45.000\ncollege class in order to have these conversations about are we choosing\n\n57:45.000 --> 57:50.000\nanything ever or are we just products of a bunch of fucking shit that's either\n\n57:50.000 --> 57:56.000\nnature and or nurture but do we do we actually like see I fucks with that\n\n57:56.000 --> 58:01.000\nargument constantly the do we choose can we move can we make our own way sort of\n\n58:01.000 --> 58:06.000\nthing and it is weird because to a certain degree we do sort of choose is\n\n58:06.000 --> 58:12.000\nmy is my thought I side with that because the alternative is going insane like\n\n58:12.000 --> 58:16.000\nyou're just like a chuchu train going around a Christmas tree he called God's\n\n58:16.000 --> 58:23.000\nboard yeah no reason and you're just like oh it's I feel like I'm choosing\n\n58:23.000 --> 58:29.000\nwhole wheat over Ryan God's like nope that's your fucking dopamine idiot fucking\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:35.000\nlittle clockwork man yeah way to choose wheat this time you fucking matchbox\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:41.000\ncar also so boring to watch us if we were constantly making the wrong choices\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:46.000\nlike be just watching a tragedy day after day so in order for it to be a sitcom\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:50.000\nand fun to watch there's a little bit of free will that goes on but there's a\n\n58:50.000 --> 58:54.000\ncertain amount of fucking up that also is part of it I like this idea that\n\n58:54.000 --> 59:01.000\nthere's free wills and illusion and God is watching that he's because the\n\n59:01.000 --> 59:07.000\nwhy did I do this this is it but that is like an old man watching a model train\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:11.000\nlike you set up a model train set and then you watch it go around and do\n\n59:11.000 --> 59:17.000\nexactly what you anticipated it would do and if it fucks up you fix it like if\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:22.000\nthe train makes its own decision you call that my I fucked up making my model\n\n59:22.000 --> 59:28.000\ntrain my understanding was I read in the past that a science scientists\n\n59:28.000 --> 59:33.000\ngenerally have formed the consensus that free will is illusion but if you think\n\n59:33.000 --> 59:38.000\nabout that it doesn't help so for all intents and purposes it's not but but\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:44.000\nscientifically it is which means that like I think that means that astrology is\n\n59:44.000 --> 59:52.000\nreal right I mean it's the equivalent for sure yeah I was born like this yeah so\n\n59:52.000 --> 59:58.000\noh so I'm just a guy who was born in this house on this date and then my mom did\n\n59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000\nthis and then my dad did this and then the school I went to this happened and\n\n01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:07.000\nlicorice was in season and right and so here I am doing this podcast saying\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000\nthese words that I'm about to say there they go there go those words that I was\n\n01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000\nalready about to say that's so I mean I guess that's what Westworld was about\n\n01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:22.000\nmaybe that was a good I thought it was a bag of shit maybe it was profound oh I\n\n01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:31.000\njust got it the piano roll oh shit was that your ring yeah Dan's ring flew off\n\n01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:38.000\nfor the folks at home who applauded my ring flying off fucking incels they're\n\n01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:49.000\neverywhere finding love is the worst thing ever happened to you you think\n\n01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.000\nthat magician like that's always how he reacts to people getting his illusions\n\n01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:02.000\nit's like yeah you just put that card there fuck\n\n01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.000\nthat's a bad temperament for a magician I think well it's a bad temperament\n\n01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:13.000\nreally I saw the inside of his apartment once oh no what and I will never trust\n\n01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:24.000\nmagicians again I was like whoa there's the trick yeah what is you being out in\n\n01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:33.000\nsociety yeah is the prestige like this is was it a mess temple to self abuse yeah\n\n01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000\nand also you have a living girlfriend who of course is your assistant at like\n\n01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.000\nlike and if she stops being your assistant there will be a new girlfriend and\n\n01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.000\nshe will be your assistant because the other one escaped and like like because\n\n01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:56.000\nbecause she unlike these dying doves in this cage who are just wondering am I\n\n01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:03.000\nnext for the sleeve like if there could be a Pixar movie there's like yellow\n\n01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.000\nfeathered doves like in this lightless apartment going like dude you're going\n\n01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:14.000\nin the sleeve next you hear that phone call that was his manager you're going\n\n01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000\nto Toronto you're going in the sleeve you're going in the fucking dove holster\n\n01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:31.000\nyou you're not gonna make it holy shit the blackness the dark fucking hole it\n\n01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:37.000\nwas like just because I think when you're a magician you do have license to\n\n01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000\njustify your apartment being caked in debris you can go well that's a bunch of\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:49.000\nmagic newspaper I can't throw that away I might have to I might need that to\n\n01:02:49.000 --> 01:03:06.000\nput it in that broken refrigerator god damn no not a magician an open mic\n\n01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:12.000\nmagician god that's darkest yeah I mean but have you that's like okay for the\n\n01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:18.000\nclan to hate darkness which only happens if you're really dark right\n\n01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:25.000\nyeah yeah justifiable well okay so just to understand I'm not trying to to\n\n01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:30.000\ngotcha journalism but I understood that your apartment was pretty messy so how\n\n01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.000\ndid this make an impact on you I think well animals obviously is a huge step\n\n01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000\nno you're right you're absolutely right I mean I ended up living in just as much\n\n01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000\nfilth as a magician oh but you see so at the time you made that judgment you had\n\n01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000\na better place I had the privilege of being a college dropout who was like\n\n01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000\nbasically still living with I was just living like a college kid like I was\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.000\nsure yeah I was going from a dorm room to like oh hey can I crash in your attic\n\n01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000\nand so I didn't have enough stuff to be filthy right I would definitely graduate\n\n01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000\nto that very quickly you're absolutely right gotcha I said it was a gotcha it\n\n01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000\nwas no I'm kidding sorry I just want to because I don't know it sounded like\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000\nobviously like and sad animals and then the mess they make is definitely like a\n\n01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000\nlevel above but I was just trying to understand because it sounded like it\n\n01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000\nwasn't necessarily the level of mess but then you're saying stuff that indicated\n\n01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:29.000\nit might have been anyway yeah what's up have you like oh buffalo why did you go\n\n01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nwings yes what what made you I was just I was like I was like Bob Dylan I was\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000\ntrying to learn about I was I would I don't know I would pick somebody up drive\n\n01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nto a gig I I can't remember honestly I would like I I was like I'm focusing on\n\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000\nmy comedy so I'm like in it to win it like I don't know I was in the biz and I\n\n01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000\njust wondered I can't I yeah maybe I would pick maybe I was picking him up\n\n01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000\nmaybe I maybe my car was working and his wasn't maybe maybe maybe we were\n\n01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.000\ngonna write a script together I have no idea I can't remember but it is it yeah\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000\nit is but I mean yeah in terms of overall filth not as meaningful as much as\n\n01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000\nlike these guys they perform in these fancy costumes and they have names like\n\n01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:22.000\nthe great zander and like to a man they do not it's like like they don't live in\n\n01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.000\nlike a loft that's like a maculet and there's like oh my illusion chest it's\n\n01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.000\nlike no it's just a fucking filth nest like because because how else are you\n\n01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:38.000\ngonna learn to roll quarters on your knuckles it's not by cleaning up you\n\n01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000\nhave to sit and like eat string cheese and like let the wrapper fall out of your\n\n01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000\nmouth like you know if you want to get the jump on the other magicians that are\n\n01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000\nlike practicing just as much quarter rolling on the knuckles you have to sit\n\n01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000\nthere and fucking like flip cards over and over again you're gonna watch\n\n01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:59.000\nColombo and collect mucus no these tricks you can learn these tricks you\n\n01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.000\ndon't need to like suffer you have to practice that shit I mean it's manual\n\n01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nit's not like the gymnast house has diarrhea all up maybe you don't know\n\n01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000\nany good gymnast a gymnast house has fucking emotional trauma all over it\n\n01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000\nbecause they're 11 years old and they've been their souls been shattered\n\n01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.000\nbecause they have no agency he was supposed to have a workshop like a magic\n\n01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000\nshop yeah like it that's what it would be in like the Colombo episode where the\n\n01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000\nsuspect was a magician everybody welcome to my loft right there's my freight elevator\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000\nand here's my guillotine trick and like because a production designer designed\n\n01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:42.000\nmy nest like there's not shit everywhere but the truth is dirty people dirty\n\n01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:51.000\npeople there was an and high suicide rate to yeah yeah there was a there was a\n\n01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000\nthere was a there was a magician that worked at the same fast and we would his\n\n01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000\ncar was in the parking lot it was very clear he was living in it like like and\n\n01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.000\nit was like he's still like they wear like three-piece suits and like ties but\n\n01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000\nit was like then they get in this like Dennis Woodruff station wagon with a\n\n01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:12.000\nportal let hanging off the back and like a fucking bag of pee on the handle and\n\n01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:21.000\nI love how we started off started off saying hey we're all equal\n\n01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:27.000\nand then by the time we were done like lousy fucking magicians with their I just\n\n01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.000\nhave a picture with people going to the looks like it's like in a world where\n\n01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:37.000\nlike it's like I'm gonna lie to people yeah I don't want to get better at that\n\n01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:43.000\nI'm not dishonest enough yeah I gotta get real

01:11:25.000\na wolf what what are you trying to look at I told you Dan I don't I don't always\n\n01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.000\nknow what's gonna happen but you're conscious of your brown we've been cool\n\n01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:36.000\nfor like 13 years but one day I may have to bite you\n\n01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:43.000\nwell yeah I mean I yeah it's I'm hard-pressed to know like do I respect wolves\n\n01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000\nmore than dogs because wolves are like they're you know you said there's a\n\n01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000\ndocumentary about they compare the two and then they put the put the little\n\n01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000\ntreat under the cup and the wolves will just like they know the treats of the\n\n01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:02.000\ncup and they paw at it and they're like wolf get the cup and then the dog\n\n01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.000\nwill try for the cup and a can't and it stops and it looks at the nearest\n\n01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:17.000\nperson because it's like can I use me but I did my best yeah and it's like I\n\n01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:22.000\ndon't are we on the side of that or not is it the shadow we cast or is it it's\n\n01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:29.000\nit's just crazy it's like it's such a it's a strange poetic relationship it\n\n01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:34.000\nis it's great that like we needed something and that something kind of\n\n01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000\nalso needed us it's weird when you're like dog walks over to you and puts its\n\n01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000\nhead on you because you're like oh man we get along and we don't speak the same\n\n01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.000\nlanguage you could have left a long time ago you could have changed your mind\n\n01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:51.000\nand bit my face off a long time ago and it's dope it's kind of the it's kind of\n\n01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:57.000\nthe coolest thing that man did or woman did for each other thousands of years\n\n01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000\nago they're like in the future you're gonna need a dog when I first moved to\n\n01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.000\nthe new house there was this moment that I never had with Harvey where like he\n\n01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.000\nit was he didn't really like he's not like this is my house and it's not he for\n\n01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:15.000\nall he knows I'm just like well you know their dogs are just like I'm sure they\n\n01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000\nget a sense of like sort of like oh this is my new bro this is my new den but\n\n01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.000\nhe just like he's like well I'm with you you're my man and I'm your dog and\n\n01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000\nwe're here together and I kind of like it just kind of organically happened that\n\n01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:35.000\nhe and I like walked the perimeter of my house together and he just like there's\n\n01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:40.000\nno leash or anything it was just sort of nighttime and he he just like fell into\n\n01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:45.000\nthis behavior that was like and that I fell into too where I was like it just\n\n01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:50.000\nfelt so right it felt like lifting a hammer or a gazelle femur like it was\n\n01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:55.000\nlike I'm this sentient primate and I would just had this like retriever at my\n\n01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.000\nhip yeah he just kept perfect pace with me and he kind of like it was as if he\n\n01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000\nunderstood that what we were doing is we were just sort of checking the perimeter\n\n01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:09.000\nand he it was that there's something just swelled inside me I think it's very\n\n01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000\nnotable though that like you know I think I don't know what the numbers are like\n\n01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000\nlet's say 50,000 years of dog domestication versus the 10,000 years of cat\n\n01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:23.000\ninfestation and I say that very affectionately as a former cat person\n\n01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:28.000\nI just like cats if you ask them are you domesticated they would say no thank you\n\n01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:34.000\nvery much sir I am not a domesticated animal I've chosen to live among humans\n\n01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:40.000\nbecause it profits me and and and unlike dogs cats don't they come in some\n\n01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000\ndifferent shapes and furs and things but they're basically cats and when we go\n\n01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:52.000\ninto outer space we're gonna bring dogs and cats and it cats didn't kiss as\n\n01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.000\nmuch ass as dogs did and they're still coming on the arc for sure and I think\n\n01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000\nthat kind of interesting because also what I find interesting that humans love\n\n01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000\ncats as much as they love dogs we maybe if you could quantify that that might not\n\n01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.000\nbe true but like we we we will bring the in the way that matters we will bring\n\n01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:16.000\ncats with us to outer space if we survive and like like we love cats because\n\n01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:22.000\nthey're soft and they they react to us loving them and and they're and like it's\n\n01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:29.000\nalmost like dogs didn't have to go as far as they did it's almost like we as\n\n01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000\nhumans were like you know what you could have split the diff and we would have\n\n01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.000\nmight have respected you more you could have negged us a little bit and the\n\n01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.000\ndogs are like I figured it out whatever you say boss and we're like all right\n\n01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:48.000\ndial it back this guy catches mice and he purrs that's it like he could shit where\n\n01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:54.000\nhe want he shits in a box how's that for fucking yeah consideration yeah it's\n\n01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000\nit's just it's interesting because humans are very self-loathing which is why we\n\n01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:03.000\nI think we reach out we every human that every animal that we ever touched I'm sure\n\n01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.000\nwe tried to domesticate we come across an elephant we probably were like oh can\n\n01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000\nyou have one as a pet and the answers no you can't because they're smarter and\n\n01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:16.000\nthey have graveyards I don't know you can't you can't have an elephant as a\n\n01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000\npet you can't what if I would have this elephant I breed it with that if it's\n\n01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000\ngonna be still be an elephant it's gonna be mad at you and step on you or it's\n\n01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:29.000\ngonna be sad and step on a stool and cry and then die and it'll remember where\n\n01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.000\nit died and every every all the other elephants will go and a scientist will\n\n01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:41.000\ngo they're all sad and we'll all cry not a pet not a pet you can't you know we\n\n01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:46.000\ntry ferrets we try lizards you know everybody needs a carney in their life\n\n01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:53.000\nbut it's because we hate ourselves like you know where we're not we're not\n\n01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:58.000\nwhat other animal species is like so insecure that they're like anybody else\n\n01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:04.000\nwant to party that's fucking crazy like you're either eating some shit or it's\n\n01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000\neating you that's the general rule in the animal king yeah there's some ants\n\n01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000\nthat milk some aphids I get you and there's copper bars I'm picking up\n\n01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000\nwhat you're laying down there's some there's some crocodile birds eating at\n\n01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:25.000\nthe teeth right I got you player that's the interspecies opening line you\n\n01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000\nare you a shark I see you shark out there general michigan's going on between\n\n01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.000\na couple species oh this spider lays an egg and the egg looks like a fruit and\n\n01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.000\nthe fruit like it makes a pollen or whatever but you know like only us are\n\n01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:44.000\nlike who wants to party yeah I'm so alone yeah Wilson well we share food yeah\n\n01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nwe fucking will give up food yeah that's a big fucking deal to animals but then\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:55.000\nonly dogs are like oh shit that's a human baby however actually oh shit this is\n\n01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:01.000\na thing I could have written down okay so damn we filled some time in my new\n\n01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:08.000\nhouse there there is this species of bird oh very interesting like there's a\n\n01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000\ncouple of neighborhood

the shark of the\n\n01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:57.000\nsphere and whereas humans are not and in fact to the contrary they is like this\n\n01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:03.000\nspecies of no species of bird that lives in a city would survive if their\n\n01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000\nbehavior included ever fucking with a guy mowing his lawn yeah because you\n\n01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:13.000\nwould immediately

01:24:57.000\nthey're they're they're they're higher tech like they're it's not good enough\n\n01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:03.000\nfor a crow to just be either scared of humans or have an affinity toward them\n\n01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.000\nI thought we were gonna die no we're good earlier about 20 minutes ago how we die\n\n01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.000\nabout 20 minutes ago through the crack in that curtain I saw Steve Levy just\n\n01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:22.000\nstanding there cracking his knuckles piano wire so maybe reach for my phone I was\n\n01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:28.000\nlike oh that is like a species of bird that we deem is ugly and kind of like\n\n01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000\nparasitic or in what would you call it infestuous is that a word like like we\n\n01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000\ndon't look at we look at crows as being like they don't they don't deserve the\n\n01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:42.000\nthe avian title they're like varmints you know but precisely because of that\n\n01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:48.000\nprobably they have developed like a keener relationship with their human\n\n01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:55.000\ncolleagues yeah they're like it doesn't pay to be a crow and look at all humans\n\n01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:01.000\nas one thing or another it it definitely you reproduce more as a crow if you can\n\n01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:08.000\ntell the difference between the little girl that brings you worms and the\n\n01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:14.000\ncranky old man that has a BB gun and it's like the only the DNA past for it's\n\n01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.000\nlike so you have this like super intelligence among this like mangy\n\n01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:23.000\nbird I fucking love crows yeah that's the thing people people love crows people\n\n01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.000\nfeel like crows are super smart some people don't like the crows but crows are\n\n01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:32.000\nlike upper middle class in the bird situation so like they're sitting pretty\n\n01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:37.000\nbecause they can take on like a hawk like they will fuck a hawk up a group of\n\n01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.000\nthem but they also kind of like will eat an egg out of a sparrow's nest so like\n\n01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000\nand sparrows can't really no matter how many sparrows get together they can't\n\n01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:51.000\nreally take on a crow so it's it's it's a it's a tense and they have funerals\n\n01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:56.000\napparently yeah if a crow is dead the other crows will gather around and they'll\n\n01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:03.000\nobserve the dead crow but it's not just out of like some elephant like nostalgia\n\n01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:09.000\nthey don't all be sad fucking idiot bleeding heart elephants oh an elephant\n\n01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.000\ndied I'm so sad let's have a wake the crows are apparently like gathered\n\n01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.000\naround the dead crow for a practical purpose they're like appraising what\n\n01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:24.000\nhappened to this dead it's really more of an autopsy it's an autopsy it's a\n\n01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.000\nyeah everyone that dies should have in a proper society an autopsy socialized\n\n01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.000\nautopsy yeah no I thought that was interesting I don't know crows are just\n\n01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:38.000\nI wish crows would be my friends does that make sense you could train a crow if\n\n01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000\nyou got a baby crow you know you could you could take it up off the streets\n\n01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.000\nyeah they actually are I mean no one wants to be like a bird pet owner but\n\n01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.000\nlike crows are especially pretty bad to keep as pets apparently I mean just\n\n01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:54.000\njust they're messy but they are smart like they'll be good but I just any time\n\n01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.000\nI see a crow I just like I wish I could just like say to that crow like hey\n\n01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:04.000\nhey man you need some like water or something I bought a frisbee and a bottle\n\n01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000\nof water to keep it in my car so if I see a hot crow I could put out like a\n\n01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:16.000\nbird bath of water a hot crow yeah you know you like a sexy crow wearing\n\n01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:26.000\nlike fishnets no but give me a be a girl take a beat but when when it gets\n\n01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.000\nhot you know they kind of open their mouth and they look like they're panting\n\n01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000\nor whatever and it seems really uncomfortable it's like man that sucks I\n\n01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:37.000\nalso went to the store to try and buy crow feed but crows don't really eat\n\n01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:42.000\nfeed so I don't know I guess I'm gonna get still french fries crows will love\n\n01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.000\nstale french fries if you didn't really fucking anything you get dead squirrel\n\n01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.000\nright awesome they kind of like I mean that's why they don't if you live in\n\n01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.000\nthe city and you got crows in your backyard they can't be super fucking\n\n01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:00.000\nannoying oh they're out there they're there that is not a pretty they're the\n\n01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:13.000\nthey're the German of bird language that is that is not a a call designed to seduce\n\n01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:20.000\nanyone it's defined and they do the thing that coyotes do which is one crow\n\n01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000\nwill make a bunch of noise to make other crows that it doesn't even know to fuck\n\n01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:30.000\nyour shit up but their call is a little more intricate and that's probably why\n\n01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000\nit sounds a little uglier to us because it's more function over form like\n\n01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:40.000\nGerman struppenhosen virgin awful the the I just said pantyhosen German that's\n\n01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:46.000\nthe only word I know it's a big internet I can say pantyhosen a lot of\n\n01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:53.000\ndifferent languages that's what you learned at the magician's house but also\n\n01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:58.000\nthat they they mimic other birds like they're just not famous for it the way\n\n01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:03.000\nparrots are that they can they can choose to sound like other birds they just\n\n01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.000\nno one pays for it just yeah exactly they're like yeah those shit gig I'm\n\n01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:12.000\nnot gonna I'm not your fucking rich little god damn I'm not I'm not I'm not\n\n01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.000\nBranson Missouri right I'm not gonna fucking like play a fiddle for you and\n\n01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:22.000\nfucking wear rhinestones I'm fucking I'm on the streets bitch\n\n01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000\npeacock\n\n01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:30.000\nnow peacock I move this place because these braids are locked up peacock\n\n01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:36.000\nsorry what sir I'm sorry peacock\n\n01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:43.000\nI love that guy yeah yeah I love just enough booze guy is that don't peacock\n\n01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:48.000\nsound like cats the peacocks go like yeah yeah kind of it's a really bad\n\n01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:59.000\nsound yeah it's awful yeah brandon's recoiling can you imagine if that cat\n\n01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:07.000\nfucking being chased by two things making the same noise but your peacock\n\n01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:13.000\nwhat if two peacocks were chasing a cat and two of those long-tailed birds that\n\n01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.000\naren't peacocks were like in the neighborhood they're like yeah I don't\n\n01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:27.000\nknow I don't know what they sound like on fox did you know that whales brandon\n\n01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:31.000\nthat they might be able to communicate their feelings with their echolocation\n\n01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:37.000\nthat that human observers detect pods of whales with a couple of sick whales in it\n\n01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:43.000\nand we suspect it's possible that the whale song in a pod of whales\n\n01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:48.000\nthat they're so their song so affects each other that if there's a couple of\n\n01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000\nsick whales in a pod that their whole song becomes we are sick\n\n01:31:52.000 --> 01:32:08.000\nyou so they sort of tease the sick whale and they really feel it too they\n\n01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:26.000\ntry to get rid of the sick whale I'm sick too I'm just going to go beach myself\n\n01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.000\nthat would be an equally valid explanation of that phenomenon we just\n\n01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.000\nwouldn't know we wouldn't assume that they were like us yeah we listen to me\n\n01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:39.000\nand Dan listen to this podcast on radio lab it was a contest about animal\n\n01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:44.000\nintelligences is is and the slime mold one which is bullshit what they're not\n\n01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:49.000\nsmart they're just efficient like a robot's not smart that's kind of doubt\n\n01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:53.000\nit's like like yeah like what's your I mean that's the question they asked in\n\n01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.000\nthe beginning like how would you measure animal intelligence would you measure\n\n01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:02.000\nit if a dog like Robert Kroll which said he used the example of like a\n\n01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:07.000\nsnow fox being able to detect a mouse and dive down to me is not intelligence\n\n01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:12.000\nlike yeah well we define intelligence by like yeah that's but that kind of\n\n01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:15.000\nraises that question it's like well what are we doing that's so goddamn smart\n\n01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:22.000\nmath cities there you go yeah but we're answers but aren't aren't we doing\n\n01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.000\nthose things by instinct and also which one of us can do those things like we're\n\n01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:36.000\nnot we're just we just those things I can do cities I love that we said it like\n\n01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:44.000\nyou to rejects during the apocalypse yeah well I could do math don't kill me\n\n01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:51.000\nand my boy here he cities we should get extra crackers we should get access to\n\n01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:56.000\nwater because my boy here do city you guys are like of mice and men traveling\n\n01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:01.000\nlike this building should be eleven buildings high which means seven\n\n01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:06.000\nbuildings high plus two buildings high and then no one can question you because\n\n01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:13.000\nyou're like I invented math no one else has math everyone's like oh good good\n\n01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:20.000\nsounds like that's what eleven is so I'm not very good at it but we're still\n\n01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:26.000\nrich I guess he's the Gary Sinise that episode was weird they were like it was\n\n01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.000\na live event and so people were leading really hard into trying to perform and\n\n01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000\nnot like pleading their case but I found it pretty unsatisfying as a result you\n\n01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.000\nknow and then it was an interesting blend of that it was a fair and it's some\n\n01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:42.000\ninformation I don't know you got it you judge an animal's intelligence by its\n\n01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.000\nability to unscrew a lid yeah see exactly what I mean it's like an octopus can\n\n01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.000\nfucking get in the thing and then put it over itself like that's smart like\n\n01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:55.000\nthe whale lady was like oh it might be the case that whales feel feelings\n\n01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.000\nbecause when they echo locate to communicate with each other it actually\n\n01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:03.000\nhits them in the face and so it's a physical sensation that they're feeling\n\n01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:07.000\nand so it's like if you're actually punched in the face by sadness rather than\n\n01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.000\njust receiving sadness and I'm like that's not that's not putting yourself\n\n01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:16.000\ninto a cup you know that's not learning to read a book like an octopus does I\n\n01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000\nmean a motherfucking chicken can beat you a tic-tac-toe that they talked about\n\n01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:25.000\nthat they talked about that hold on it's not not don't it's not true don't\n\n01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:33.000\nsorry it's my dad stuff chickens are actually the dumbest animal in the\n\n01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:41.000\nworld that chicken beat me I mean that guy was kind of funny right because he\n\n01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000\nbrought the chickens out he was kind of subverting the whole thing well yeah\n\n01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:50.000\nsee to me it's like they say oh we're gonna do a contest about animal\n\n01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.000\nintelligence and here's four people that are gonna do three minutes of weird\n\n01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.000\nstand-up like it's like well let's talk about we could do there's probably\n\n01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:03.000\nroom for both but yeah I don't know anyway I think I'm just 46 and I'm like\n\n01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:09.000\nnow I'm like I like NPR and you're like god damn it the world's on fire and I'm\n\n01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:16.000\nlike calm down it's fucking on fire listen to the big band music on the NPR\n\n01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:23.000\nthey got Tommy Dorsey blowing bubbles they don't want to say Nazi too many\n\n01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:30.000\ntimes in an hour they would upset me old bones yeah I think I just specifically\n\n01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.000\nhave a vendetta against like that radio lab style of humor I don't know\n\n01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000\nsomething about it really greats greats me did you ever hear the radio lab\n\n01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:43.000\nwhere they fucking like we're cruel which accidentally fucking catastrophically\n\n01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.000\ntriggered like this like indigenous dude who is like they like they oh that\n\n01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:53.000\npissed me off but but I was like yeah okay so there was a let's talk about there\n\n01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:57.000\nwas a guy who was talking about how in his village or city or whatever there\n\n01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:04.000\nwas this a phenomenon that he almost invested with supernatural weight to\n\n01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:09.000\nit because it's like this was it like yellow detritus or yellow dust kind of\n\n01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.000\ncame down or something some color of dust descended and there they like thought\n\n01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:18.000\nit was like it was like a myth or like it was like a secret alien not alien but\n\n01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:22.000\nthey're like oh it's like the government or it's like aliens or ghosts or\n\n01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:26.000\nsomething and then he's like you know that was like America doing weird\n\n01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.000\nexperiments and he got like really mad right was that you're talking about yeah\n\n01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.000\nbut are you sure that specifically was the paradigm because I thought I\n\n01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.000\nremembered it as like they were convinced it was government experiments right\n\n01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:42.000\nthe truth is like fungus or something yeah and so then they got really offended\n\n01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.000\nat the idea and then they were like yeah we've struggled so hard and it's been so\n\n01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.000\nhard and you just don't understand that but it's like no you don't understand\n\n01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:54.000\nyou just the government sucks and also this was just moss like I'm sorry the\n\n01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:58.000\ngovernment still sucks I'm not saying they're great yeah no it was just great\n\n01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000\nI was it was crazy to listen to it was basically what he was saying was our\n\n01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.000\npeople have suffered from this this incredible dust that the United States\n\n01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.000\nput on us and these guys were like debunkers who were like hey that was just\n\n01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:15.000\npollen yeah it was sort of like your people have been the victim of like\n\n01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:20.000\nexploitation or whatever development or whatever but this yellow shit that comes\n\n01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:25.000\ndown is actually just a natural thing and the it was like it was act it was it\n\n01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.000\nwas it was magnified by the fact that there was like a young woman that was\n\n01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:32.000\ntranslating for like this elder was like just speaking in his native language and\n\n01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:36.000\nshe was translating for him and it was just it was crazy to hear like it was\n\n01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000\nlike it was really I mean it was one of those things were like I was really\n\n01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:45.000\nglad I heard it because it was so like it was like part train wreck but there\n\n01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.000\nwas something healthy about it I don't know it was like because it was it was\n\n01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.000\nNPR guys that were just like oh by the way we do a science show at NPR and\n\n01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:59.000\nthere's just shit falling down and then the guys like you know like I don't want\n\n01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:05.000\nto do an impression of fucking indigenous language I don't know I don't know\n\n01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:08.000\nhe's like he's speaking indigenous language and she's translating and it's\n\n01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:14.000\nlike but you can hear his timber changing and then she's translating and she's\n\n01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:19.000\ngoing like but you don't understand the thing is it's this and then Kroll which\n\n01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:26.000\nis like yeah but it was just like the fungus and then he's like his\n\n01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:30.000\nexcitation level starts going up so you can't understand what he's saying but\n\n01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:35.000\nshe's matching his level and she's translating for him in real time and\n\n01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:40.000\nshe's in tears yeah she starts going like but but you don't understand like\n\n01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:47.000\nlike how can you do this to us how can you after everything you've done and\n\n01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:51.000\nthen you bring us in here and the whole time you hear him underneath saying\n\n01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.000\nthings you don't understand and but that's mounting and mounting and he's\n\n01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.000\nhe's the baseline and she's the treble and they're both going up and up and\n\n01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.000\nup and Robert Kroll which doesn't strike me as a guy who's ever been in the\n\n01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:10.000\nbusiness of confrontation and so he's just like whoops and and then Jad\n\n01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:17.000\nObenrod's like well maybe there's a way to it was fucking but like deep\n\n01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000\nrespect that they aired it that they fucking that they that they family go\n\n01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:26.000\nlike here's a crazy fucking thing we got into yeah where which is like well we\n\n01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:31.000\ndidn't mean to offend but it was like no heroes no villains just like a crazy\n\n01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:36.000\nfour-way intersection of culture humanity like like like I don't know it\n\n01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:40.000\nwas it was it was I mean one thing's for sure you get hypnotized driving to\n\n01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:43.000\nwork you're listening to Radio Lab and then all of a sudden some shit like that\n\n01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.000\ngoes down and you're like whoa god damn do I need to pull my car over should I\n\n01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:53.000\ncall in late to work like do I need to drive over to MPR do they need help\n\n01:40:53.000 --> 01:41:00.000\nit was a driveway moment and I do respect that cuz I like I did Whiting\n\n01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.000\nWong's with Jessica like you know we would do there was more than a couple\n\n01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.000\ntimes when it was like shit would hit the fan and like I would sound like a\n\n01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.000\nfucking pompous ass and like I you know we'd step out of the booth and go like\n\n01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:15.000\npoof that was visceral and then you go like the engineer be like you want me\n\n01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:21.000\nto edit anything out like no cuz you can't like don't yeah like like like\n\n01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.000\nlike let's what are we doing this for then that would be fucking dumb like\n\n01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:30.000\nlike like okay so I threw a tantrum and like like air it you know like gotta do\n\n01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:34.000\nit gotta do it put it in the shadow box otherwise otherwise you can't pay\n\n01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:39.000\nyourself to like fucking talking to a microphone I yeah so I do respect it\n\n01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000\nthat they're like they got caught in that fucking sand trap and they were\n\n01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:47.000\nlike oof this is uncomfortable this isn't it's also faster if you double down\n\n01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.000\nin a way that's like oh man I was also shocked by the things that came out of\n\n01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:56.000\nmy mouth versus this like what we do is we kind of run and I think now if you\n\n01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:02.000\ncan get there faster than your critics and go shit I was trying I said some\n\n01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:08.000\nshit I fucked up and you would have too if you've been talking for 48 minutes\n\n01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.000\nstraight cuz we all would like I think after we all got about 15 minutes with\n\n01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:19.000\nan arm in us which is in in like 30 minutes you start being like yeah my\n\n01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:23.000\ndad was just you know we just drank too much I don't know anyway I'm glad we're\n\n01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:29.000\nhere let's cut the cake but it just bring me back and I think I get that I\n\n01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:33.000\ntalked with Duncan babbling endlessly about but it was like it had to do with\n\n01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:38.000\nthat free will thing because it's like it is weird how our culture and by our\n\n01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:43.000\nculture I genuinely mean like I think basically the entire human species\n\n01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:48.000\nculture like we seem to have it in for ourselves and that we do not want to\n\n01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:54.000\nreward the changing of the mind we have an inherent suspicion and probably for\n\n01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.000\na pretty good reason because there's this thing called sociopaths that that\n\n01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:02.000\nlike if there's absolutely if you hold nothing sacred and you can just feel\n\n01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:07.000\nhowever express whatever you need to express to get through whatever gates\n\n01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:10.000\nyou need to get through your genuine danger to the rest of society we are\n\n01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:15.000\nheld in place by the fact that hey I choose not to be a criminal today it's\n\n01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000\nnot because there's a cop watching me every second it's right it's like I\n\n01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.000\nthere I might not encounter a cop the entire day and still obey the law why\n\n01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:29.000\nbecause I have decided that I am a law abiding citizen how do you do that\n\n01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:43.000\noh Brandon now a man don't move to the but it's it is it is weird how much we\n\n01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:51.000\npunish the changing of the mind that we're like oh I don't trust you now\n\n01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:56.000\nbecause you said you felt a different way yesterday yeah and the weird thing about\n\n01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:04.000\nthat is that we are all you have outside of the changing the changing is the\n\n01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:10.000\nonly thing like whether we say free will is an illusion or not it's still\n\n01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:14.000\narguably that that's all there is to who you really are everything else is\n\n01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.000\nshit outside your control even within a model where you have no control over\n\n01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.000\nyour choices like this real stat over here is still arguably the only thing\n\n01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:27.000\nattention yeah yeah this moved today to yesterday like all this other shit is\n\n01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.000\nlike well this guy woke up on Monday and he said I'm proud to be white and he\n\n01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.000\nspent 70 years saying that it's like well that's obviously worth nothing\n\n01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:41.000\nbecause it never changed and so like and we but we punish the change it we\n\n01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:46.000\nwe kind of like we regard it we want it to happen a little bit but we don't want\n\n01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:52.000\nDavid Bowie did enough but don't do it too much because you don't want to be a\n\n01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:58.000\nKardashian don't be empty don't don't reveal yourself to be virtue signal\n\n01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.000\nwhich means that you only you just do whatever you go where the wind blows\n\n01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.000\nand like we just have all these opinions about when you're allowed to change\n\n01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:10.000\nyour mind and what what what what basis you're using to change how you think\n\n01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:15.000\nand yet that's all you possibly could be in throughout your life is like how you\n\n01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:24.000\nchange I want my money back from being a human I mean I wish I could be a raccoon\n\n01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:29.000\nmade raccoons don't they there there's no raccoons out there rumbling each other\n\n01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:34.000\nlike hey man you you ate a different kind of garbage yesterday but they do sniff\n\n01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:39.000\neach other's butt for that reason so there is there is some evolutionary shit\n\n01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.000\nto change you told me all about the butt sniffing yeah with the dogs I know he's\n\n01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:49.000\ngot a whole thing about the butt sniffing it's a it's a go off king it's a\n\n01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:54.000\ngo go go is that a thing or did you most hilarious oh I invented that I'm a\n\n01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:59.000\ngenius go off no no that's a thing that's the counter to yes queen that's\n\n01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:04.000\nmore to yes queen's pepper fucking what I want to hear about this I want to hear\n\n01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:14.000\nabout the uncle or the dog butts spill the spill the power aid no what's this\n\n01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:20.000\nabout dogs spit that gospel priest that they use it to figure out what the other\n\n01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.000\ndog has been eating where it's been going what it's been fucking around with\n\n01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:29.000\nthat they sort of use it like a like it's a cheap GPS because your but hole\n\n01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:34.000\nholds all the information about where you've been the poop it's their wallet\n\n01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.000\nit's there it's the it's the shoes they're wearing it's like a dog a dog from\n\n01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.000\nuptown is gonna have a totally different asshole yeah than a dog from downtown\n\n01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.000\nand a dog from uptown is like god damn you got a high protein diet right and\n\n01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.000\nlike wool wolves are like oh shit there's a lot of protein in your asshole\n\n01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:55.000\nyou're not you're not eating a bunch of grass you're not a sick wolf you've been\n\n01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:02.000\ndowning a lot of mammoth or pigs or I'm gonna roll with you because you've got\n\n01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:06.000\nprotein dispute like like people who hunt with you end up with protein yeah\n\n01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:10.000\nyeah that's a tough skill and you thought that was a little disappointing\n\n01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:15.000\nbecause you're like their capitalists you know they're that they're that they're\n\n01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:19.000\nnot you know that they're but I thought it was a little actually uplifting I\n\n01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:22.000\nwant to go back to the choice thing though because it's super interesting is\n\n01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:27.000\nthat you can buy certain cars you can buy eight colors but on high-end cars you\n\n01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:33.000\ncan get 40 colors right so I think I think choice is a huge thing that gets\n\n01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:39.000\nused against us and that the execution of choice is offensive to people that\n\n01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:44.000\nthey're like who do you think you are to make that choice it's really what we're\n\n01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.000\nall fighting to do is get to a position where we can choose every hour of the\n\n01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.000\nday but there's a big scam going on right like like the man is laughing all\n\n01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:58.000\nthe way to the bank yeah if poor people and and like like the less we change\n\n01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.000\nour minds well they like to keep you in a box so you can't right right because\n\n01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:06.000\nbecause who wants a bunch of poor people like waking up every day and checking\n\n01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:10.000\ntaking inventory and going like how do I feel I don't know I'm gonna make a new\n\n01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:14.000\ndecision today is it taco Tuesday no fuck you it's not even Tuesday oh shit I\n\n01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:21.000\nwhoo yeah like and

YouTube to we can you YouTube\n\n01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:10.280\nBilly Joel. Oh yeah, please do. I mean I wish we could just put it up on the\n\n01:54:10.280 --> 01:54:14.520\nscreen. He throws his piano doesn't he throws a keyboard. I just I can't think\n\n01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:19.400\nof what the actual move is, but to me it was like just just incredibly violent\n\n01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:23.500\nlike you didn't hit someone, but like everything he was doing to me just just\n\n01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:29.680\nsmack to violence and I was like wow yeah yeah. It punched a violence.\n\n01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:39.680\nLet there be no mistaking where we're going. Yeah, it was like to violence.\n\n01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:44.380\nThe one thing that sticks in my head about Billy Joel is that it supposedly\n\n01:54:44.380 --> 01:54:48.260\nmaybe it's apocryphal. I don't know, but supposedly he's the one guy that never\n\n01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:55.460\ngave Weird Al permission to parody him or like boo at the tracks like Weird Al\n\n01:54:55.460 --> 01:55:00.900\ndid that science all Billy Joel to me and then Billy Joel was like historically\n\n01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:06.940\nit was like thumbs down. I don't like it. Whereas Madonna's like yeah like a\n\n01:55:06.940 --> 01:55:12.900\nsurgeon. I mean I think like a virgin's a little edgier, but I'm not sure what\n\n01:55:12.900 --> 01:55:18.360\nyou're parodying at this point. You're kind of taking the edge off of my work.\n\n01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:25.440\nSeems non satirical like a surgeon. So Billy Joel come on man. You're ripe for\n\n01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:29.940\nit. You're ripe for ridicule, but he didn't want it. He did. I don't I don't\n\n01:55:29.980 --> 01:55:36.860\ncotton to that. Don't weird. You weirdify me. I'm not weird. So you're weird\n\n01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:43.460\nmade that made that weird. I'll bootleg all Billy Joel. Don't you try to make\n\n01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:48.820\nmy songs any weirder. I'm gonna put some grease in a cracker. Jack can put a\n\n01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:54.980\nstudent baker on my shoe. We should just do the lamest version. Just change up\n\n01:55:54.980 --> 01:55:58.460\ndown to downtown just to piss him off. Girl.\n\n01:55:58.460 --> 01:56:05.460\nYou've been puttin' on a cracker jack world.

She'll see I'm not so tough. Just a box\n\n01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:38.660\nof snuff. I'm a dandruff and a top top gun.\n\n01:56:41.820 --> 01:56:43.540\nTop gun made it in.
