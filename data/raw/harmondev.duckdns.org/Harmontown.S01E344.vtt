WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
Yeah, yeah, how are you tonight? Lovely downtown dynasty. Make some noise for the people at home.

00:17.000 --> 00:25.000
Yeah, we need you to sound a little bit louder than you really are. Act as if we were all here tonight. Make some noise.

00:25.000 --> 00:40.000
Alright, I'll believe that, I'll believe that. Ladies and gentlemen, Superstar, Wonder Master, Game Master, Spencer Grinter!

00:40.000 --> 00:55.000
So stop running at the mall. So stop running at the mall. I hope you paid your parking tickets. I hope you put your money down for the city. Cause you are out to pay. Cause we are all going to town.

00:55.000 --> 01:13.000
Down there at the home of... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, high pitch rapper, rapping at a high pitch. Fuck your mama cause her arm got nine stitches.

01:13.000 --> 01:32.000
I already went to a gross place immediately. A PZotomy. For the folks at home, what's an A PZotomy? I mean, I know what one is.

01:32.000 --> 01:43.000
That's a world record for how gross it got. It was like right at the gross line, like coming off the starting block. My first step was gross.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
Yeah, but you know the deal in order to freestyle. Well, you got to be brave. The PZotomy was a brave jumping off point.

01:49.000 --> 02:04.000
You know what? I'm torn now. Okay. I'm a little... Sometimes I'm like, maybe not so much self-reflection. I watched my first AOC Instagram live. Have you seen her do her Instagram streams?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
I haven't. I have followed AOC.

02:06.000 --> 02:19.000
She apparently just... I watched it and it was genuinely inspiring. From an attitudinal standpoint, from a performative standpoint. It really doesn't matter what your politics are.

02:19.000 --> 02:36.000
For a politician to be like, I'm going to make a chicken dinner and talk shop. She wasn't spending the whole time going like, I'm sorry, was that racist? I don't know. You know what I'm saying?

02:36.000 --> 02:50.000
You better believe she gets more trolls than I've ever had. I was just watching. Everyone's taking the hottest pot shots at her. Sorry if I hit you with a piece of popcorn.

02:50.000 --> 03:02.000
See, she wouldn't say that. She'd be like, I got to get a new bowl for my chicken. She was just like... That's how collective bargaining will work for healthcare.

03:02.000 --> 03:16.000
You know what? I need a mixing bowl. She just had this calm... I was watching it and I'm like, she's not fucking around. She really does need that mixing bowl.

03:16.000 --> 03:29.000
She's smart enough to know that she's not... If there's 11 handlers off camera going like, no, no, no, not the mixing bowl. She'd have a million reasons to tailspin.

03:29.000 --> 03:39.000
But she's genuinely making a family dinner and just propped her phone up and she's like, okay, what's the next question? And then there's a million dudes going like, how much for a blue jug?

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
And she's just like, I need a mixing bowl. It's fucking inspiring.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
It is. It is because you see that she really wants to do it. You're used to seeing politicians who don't want to do it.

03:49.000 --> 04:02.000
To know that you're... I mean, what have we associated politics with throughout history? What is the problem with it? It's always that, oh, the kinds of people that aspire to it are exactly the kind of people you don't want to give that job to.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
That's right.

04:03.000 --> 04:13.000
Because they're pieces of shit. And maybe she's a piece of shit. I don't know much about her, but I'll tell you what. She knows how to fucking Instagram live.

04:13.000 --> 04:20.000
I'll tell you, she's got that on me. I was like, man, I'm inspired. She's like the Joan of Arc of Instagram live.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Yeah.

04:21.000 --> 04:31.000
I've been trying. I asked myself while I work out in my Instagram live feed, what would AOC do right now? And I just think, get a mixing bowl.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
Like, I just try to get the... Was that a fake laugh?

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
Oh, yeah. I got to do that these days.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Is it really that needed?

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
No, no. It's a real laugh.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
How are you, Spencer?

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
Oh, I'm so good. I'm not great. I'm fine. It's good.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
All right. Mixed signals.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Yeah. That's me, baby.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
You need a mixing bowl?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
I was going to go there. Yeah.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
For those signals?

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
Yeah. How do you think they got as such?

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
Why don't you go there on one of them?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
I might.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
All right.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
On my feelings?

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Yeah.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Or my signals?

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Yeah. Just one bad thing, one good thing.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
Okay. One bad thing. I hate myself.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
Okay. All right. We're going to have to skip the next question I lied. No. One good thing.

05:24.000 --> 05:31.000
One good thing. I don't know, man. Let's see. I guess it's not so mixed.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
How's it going with your...

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
It's just kind of a bowl of...

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
It's all in one.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Yeah. It's all in just one...

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
I was just wondering in the splash though.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
No, that was a vodka to go with the popcorn flake that flew off earlier.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
What are you writing down? Are you...

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Oh, no.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Popcorn.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
She sketches.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
She sketches.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Oh, you're just drawing. How dare you.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
That's the opposite of writing. It's fine.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Drawing can only ever be supportive.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
Like, yeah. If you're writing, it's like it could go either way.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
She made me look like Post Malone.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
I don't want any of this to get out.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Don't leave this room. Don't write anything down.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
This is between us.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
You could hand that to someone on a pony.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
It could be in Delaware by Wednesday.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Man, these hipsters, they reel old style.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
They come to your show. They don't take pictures for Instagram.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
They draw the shit.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
They hand it to a red coat.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Right.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
They hand it to a right brother.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
And then there's a dirigible going to the Santa Barbara.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
You know, the next thing, you know.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
Old Jed's a millionaire.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
That's all folks.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
I was talking. I was talking.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
I was realizing recently I have some deep seated issues

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
with my parents that I've been exploring.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Oh, my therapist says I should get a haircut.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Right. Well, I so I wanted to ask you about your therapist.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Oh, yeah.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
So you don't let me stop you.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
For those of you who are new to the podcast,

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Spencer's therapist is a bully.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Oh, yeah.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
He just wants him to cut his hair because it's long.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Is that still happening?

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
No, I didn't see him for a month or longer

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
because he had some stuff.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
I had some stuff, you know,

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
he had a rope he had to climb.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Right.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
He went to a therapist convention.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
You don't want that to happen.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
I don't want therapists to get convincing.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Yeah.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
I always felt like I was when I was going to a chiropractor,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
he was like, and he would go like,

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
oh, I can't do next week at the regular time.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
I'm going to a convention.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Right.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
A great, great.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
You're going to be,

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
you're going to go to nine seminars about how to,

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
how to fucking tell me that my foot limpness has to do

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
with whether I should eat Cheetos.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Fucking garbage.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
You're going to like start making me fill out

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
new Xerox forms that you got for free

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
from some fucking dude in hall H.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
Going to be poking you with his other hand or something.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
But did your therapist come come back

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
with a different attitude?

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Yeah.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
He was like, your hair is great.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Oh.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
No, no, no.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
God damn it.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
You got to be excited.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Because that's what I was thinking,

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
is that he would go to a convention,

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
maybe it's his first one in four years or something,

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
and then he'd go to a seminar and be like,

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
hey, stop telling your customers to cut their hair.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Yeah.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
That's like not cool.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Yeah.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Well, I don't know.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
My friend has a therapist who,

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
she says, subscribes to that simulation theory of the world,

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
which I don't know that there's a lot of religious beliefs

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
that you don't want a therapist to have,

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
but it's all a simulation is probably like,

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
it's got to be one of the worst.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
It just seems really fucked up to me.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Yeah.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Like, oh, you know what you got to do?

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
A cheat code.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
What?

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
Just getting to hacking.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
But no, no, one of my therapists said,

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
I don't know.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
He asked me about my social life a lot,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
and he's because the first time I came in,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
I was like really depressed about a girl,

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
and I was just bummed out and it was bummed me out,

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
and that's one of the reasons why I started seeing a therapist.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
And so since then, he's been asking me about my social life,

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
but I always take that as like a transition into talking about my hair.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
So I've been trying to like be like, oh, it's great.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Oh, went to the beach.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Oh boy.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
Which I don't think is a good use of therapy, you know.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
By the way, there's no guests tonight, so fuck off.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
In a way, we're all the guests.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
Let's bring out Spencer's therapist.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
God, that would be a damn bully.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
We should book him.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
That would be cool.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Well, I don't know.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
It would be hostile, but it would be interesting to just ask him questions

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
like it was a real person.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
When he asks you about your social life,

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
is he what is he saying?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Is he asking where you go?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Is he trying to fucking hang?

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
What is he?

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
He's trying to hang.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
No, I think that I think he's just wanting to know like what I'm doing.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Like because I think you even have any friends.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
That's what it's a picture.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
Your therapist is like a bad guy from an 80s ski movie.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Yeah.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Do you even have any friends?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Why don't you get a haircut?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Yeah, man.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Maybe you'd have more fun if you cut your fucking hair, bro.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Who do you know here?

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Who do you know at this therapist office?

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
My therapist started asking me a shower more as I shared,

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
but then also like which I have started doing because I have a pool now.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
So now I just shower more and I have like a better shower.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
I have like one of those showers where you just like there's less difference

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
between the shower and the bathroom.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
So it just feels more like, you know, like a fancy hotel.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
You can walk right in.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
Yeah, you walk in and you go pshh and it goes pshh and you go pshh.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
You start peeing.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Yeah.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Instead of like step over it.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Something like that.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
You get in that tub that poor people tub and it's like,

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
and the fucking shower heads just like pshh.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
And you're like,

10:59.000 --> 11:06.000
And instead of, this is like a big booth and you just,

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
I can just stand behind the shower head and be like pshh.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Be as cold as you want.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
You fucking shit fuck.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Okay.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
I'll talk to you when you're hot.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
And then I'm like, you're too hot.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
I'll talk to you when you're fucking the temperature of my mom's womb.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
Too soon, too late.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Too soon.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
And then I'm just, so I'm like, okay, I'll shower all the time.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Big deal.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Like I always knew it was bullshit.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
So now, so now, so now I'm the cleanest nerd in the world.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I guess I'm your worst nightmare.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
Well, can I be, can I be the president now?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
I'm so clean.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Smell my dick.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
Eat off my armpit.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
You can make a wrap sandwich.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Eat my armpit.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
I'm so cool.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
I'm so cool.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
But another thing my therapist.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
You took it too far when you said wrap.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
Yeah.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Another thing my therapist started saying though,

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
and this troubles me, is my therapist started saying at the end of the sessions,

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
she now goes, so what do you want to do?

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
So next week, two weeks.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
A suspect.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
Like she's kind of like, I think you're done.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
Like, why are you coming every week?

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
You're boring.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Like we get it.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
You're rich.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
You're happy.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Oh good.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
Like, what do you just come here to fucking talk about some dude that got on your nerves

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
on the freeway?

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
That's not why I get paid.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Fuck off, you fat jerk.

12:44.000 --> 12:50.000
Okay, but again, I think that's awesome to graduate.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
I know, but it feels also, I feel terrified.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
I'm like, no, mama, I need to come back every week.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
I'm moving.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
I got all kinds of problems.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
What if something doesn't spark joy?

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
And that's true.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
My shit's like, I still have shit that maybe I haven't told you yet.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Yeah.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Yeah, exactly.

13:07.000 --> 13:16.000
I want to like beef it up at the end of a season of law and order, just like throwing.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
By the way, I'm an alcoholic.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Right.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Jerry Orbeck's got a problem.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Donner killed himself.

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
I just want to turn to her and be like, okay, so now here's the real me.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Yeah.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
After like four years of seeing.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
That would be amazing at the end of it.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Thank you so much.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Yeah.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
I think I'll do two weeks from now.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
I've always been British.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
You're a terrible therapist.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
You did not pick up my accent.

13:44.000 --> 13:50.000
You never knew I wasn't British.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
I want a therapist react to that.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
So they'd be like, oh, you get some money back.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
You're right.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
I'm not that good.

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
I've been treating you as an American, which means that I don't know who you are.

14:03.000 --> 14:09.000
So that would be like finding a finding out your doctor's stethoscope didn't work.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
I've been British the whole time.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Love.

14:13.000 --> 14:22.000
I'm not qualified to check your prostate the entire time.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
All right.

14:23.000 --> 14:32.000
Uber updated its app and the the reckoning is upon us.

14:32.000 --> 14:39.000
There's now when you order a ride, a thing comes up and it says something I've always

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
dreamt of.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
It says like, okay, and what's your conversation preference?

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
You can you can say I want I want to quiet or I want to chatty.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
What?

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Yeah.

14:50.000 --> 14:55.000
So like the two settings are like, keep it quiet or I don't mind it.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
I don't mind to chat something like that.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Which one are you?

14:58.000 --> 15:04.000
Well, 90% of the time quiet, but then but and I always wanted that.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
I've always said, I think a lot of people have always said, by the way, could you add a fucking

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
button?

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
You've said that I was gonna say yeah, like add a button that says just to let you know

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
before you even accept the fare.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
I'm not I don't want to make a friend tonight.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
I don't want to hear about your podcast.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
I don't want to fucking like I don't want you to question my fucking left turns and right

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
turns.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
I don't want you to.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
I could imagine for the ladies.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Maybe there's a whole thing there.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
It's like, don't fucking talk to me.

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
And and finally now there's a button there, but now now I'm filled with anxiety because

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
I'm always like, I hit that button.

15:37.000 --> 15:42.000
And then I'm like, I keep thinking, well, one of these days I'm going to hit a, oh,

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
maybe I'll have like just taken an Adderall an hour earlier.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Oh, shit.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
And I'm like, I'm just kind of like in a high mood.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
And I'm like, you know what?

15:51.000 --> 15:57.000
Oh, I don't mind having a little chitty chat and like like the tyranny of that now for

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
the for a driver who would normally like the Jason Statham transporter out there who's

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
like, I have two rules.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Love.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
I don't know.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
You don't bug me.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
I don't bug you.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Oh, just pick up.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Yeah.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Take you from him.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
And then they like get the fare and they're like, it's like wouldn't wouldn't mind a little

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
chat.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Like, oh, like, you don't want to punish somebody.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
They're like, like force somebody to like be driving.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
And like, how's the weather?

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
And God damn it.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Fuck this.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
Yeah.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
Or to be stuck with the sin bad of overdrivers.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
She's like, oh, I'm a Lassianica jokes.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
My San Vicente jokes.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Hey, ma'am, here we go by pigs.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
You know, pigs is a hot dog seller.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
I don't want to be in the car with that dude.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Yeah.

16:44.000 --> 16:49.000
They could have just been like a normal or just give me a fucking minute.

16:49.000 --> 16:56.000
You know, instead of like, you got to be talking, man, talk.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
You better.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Yes.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
And me, doll.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Because it's not.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
I don't know who's requesting chattiness.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
It just seems like, you know, it's like I today my mom died.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
I don't want to talk to anybody.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
That didn't happen to me, but it's like that's the circumstance.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
And no one's like, hmm, how am I feeling like cordial?

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
Well, the weird thing is the air one because it's like chat preferences and there's probably

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
like music preferences.

17:21.000 --> 17:26.000
And there's one of those like air preferences and the choices are hot.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
Who's choosing hot?

17:30.000 --> 17:37.000
Warm, cool, cold and no preference.

17:37.000 --> 17:45.000
Like it kind of that's weird because it makes you it forces someone who ordinarily your

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
default choice would be like, well, wait a minute, I want you to be accountable to the

17:49.000 --> 17:56.000
livability of the temperature of your right of your of your cabin.

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
But that the only choice for a person that feels that way is no preference, which is

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
it's a weird thing to say about your the temperature of a car you're getting to no preference.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Well, I do have a preference.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
I hope it's not cold.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Right.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
I also hope it's not hot.

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
There is no selection in other words that just says room temperature.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Right.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
It's no preference, which to me is like undecided.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I'm the Ken Bone of temperature.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
I still haven't made up my mind.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
Like, give me what you got.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
I'm adorable.

18:32.000 --> 18:38.000
I just I'm just here to feel things out like how will I know if I'm not exposed to all

18:38.000 --> 18:44.000
the elements like and then they might feel like I need to like blast you with boy, what

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
a shitty episode this is.

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
I mean, that's really I think that's all I got honestly.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
I don't know what we're going to do.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
It's fucked up that somebody could get in your car and be like, I'm hot and I told you

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
to shut up.

18:58.000 --> 19:04.000
This is this is this is my checklist that says quiet preferred button Uber and AOC chicken

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
dinner.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
That's my that's my those are my notes.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
I didn't I didn't guys.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
I I thought that was two hours of oh well.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Well, we're freestyling now.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
All right.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
No net.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Good.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
We don't need no fucking no.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
How are you?

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
How is your clothes?

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
God damn it.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
They're lovely.

19:30.000 --> 19:35.000
What'd you do this weekend?

19:35.000 --> 19:43.000
I I forced myself to go to my old house and grab some stuff that I felt like was worth

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
bringing over to my new house.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
I'm like living in a big empty house.

19:48.000 --> 19:54.000
Cody and I are like living in this unfurnished house sleeping on a mattress on the floor

19:54.000 --> 20:00.000
and it's kind of like we keep joking like oh maybe we maybe maybe this is a new lifestyle

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
like no furniture.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
There is a decorator that the will eventually be furnishing the place but in the meantime

20:07.000 --> 20:13.000
we're kind of like what are we supposed to it's usually when you move your you got a

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
couch at your old place you're going to bring it to your new place because number one usually

20:18.000 --> 20:24.000
your old place is not going to stay your place and you all also don't want to buy a new couch

20:24.000 --> 20:30.000
so I don't think I have to explain this to you guys but I have to explain it to you because

20:30.000 --> 20:36.000
you have to understand it's not the case with me like I'm keeping my old house and I don't

20:36.000 --> 20:42.000
want any of the furniture in it at my new place because number one I'm probably going to rent

20:42.000 --> 20:49.000
my old house right so I'm not gonna I may not rent it unfurnished because you don't rent

20:49.000 --> 20:55.000
a house with no furniture I don't think you can do both it could do both I lived in a

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
rented house once that was unfurnished because it was like oh I'm gonna rent this place

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
yearly so there is that but then there's also the more like the kind of like upscale

21:04.000 --> 21:10.000
like hey this is this place is ready to go Leo de Caprio's nephew who's in town for a

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
year and he has money to burn and just like I don't know if there's there's like a market

21:15.000 --> 21:21.000
for that and that market may depend on oh just keep the furniture that's there at any rate

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
I'm not going to throw the furniture in the garbage right but I'm not going to move it

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
to the new place and I'm not gonna and it's just like it's just like the house is just

21:28.000 --> 21:34.000
filled with shit and we were talking about this last night like it's like you start to

21:34.000 --> 21:40.000
realize usually it's forced upon you because you're your mood you got to get out of your

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
old place so that shit's you got to go through that shit anyway but if you don't have to

21:45.000 --> 21:50.000
go through it if it's sitting there you're kind of like oh you just start to realize

21:50.000 --> 21:56.000
your whole life represents decisions that you delayed that's what your house is full

21:56.000 --> 22:03.000
of is shit that you put off thinking about that's what's on every shelf is like piles

22:03.000 --> 22:10.000
of paper that like may or may not be valuable they weren't so obviously garbage that it

22:10.000 --> 22:17.000
was joyful to throw them away but they also definitely aren't like oh old man withers

22:17.000 --> 22:23.000
special paper that he gave me to oh yeah close to my heart and it's like you're now

22:23.000 --> 22:30.000
like forced to I got to either throw this shit out or I got to bring it I got to act

22:30.000 --> 22:35.000
like I'm proud of it and bring it over to my place I don't want to do either and it kind

22:35.000 --> 22:41.000
of it makes me like wake up in an unfurnished house every morning and go what should I do

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
today let's say on the weekend is like there could be a million answers to that if you're

22:46.000 --> 22:53.000
just in the bustle of moving but like you wake up and you go shit I don't have anything

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
here and you go well I got a bunch of shit at the old house should I go grab that computer

22:57.000 --> 23:03.000
now that computer sucks like you're probably going to get a new computer you know what that

23:03.000 --> 23:10.000
old ass computer over here and then you go what am I really going to spend $30,000 on

23:10.000 --> 23:17.000
a new fucking Mac Pro or am I going to go PC or am I going to go like like because what

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
and then I'm like I don't want to think about that I don't want to think about that right

23:20.000 --> 23:28.000
and then I'm like okay fuck computers and then you're like what's left shirts should I bring

23:28.000 --> 23:35.000
11,000 Rick and Morty shirts over here that I don't wear because I don't want people to

23:35.000 --> 23:43.000
see me in public and think that's so sad he wants us to ask about the show so I don't

23:43.000 --> 23:50.000
like I got but I'm not throwing those away what am I doing with those shirts I have 11,000

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
Rick and Morty shirts what am I I can't throw them away I don't want to be responsible for

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
a bunch of homeless people going down it's like I don't want to be the new Britney Spears

23:58.000 --> 24:04.000
where it's like all the homeless people are wearing Rick and Morty shirts the creator

24:04.000 --> 24:11.000
gave me this man this was dumped off in a U-Haul at the Goodwill and like everyone's

24:11.000 --> 24:19.000
just like pickle Rick I could actually undercut my own cottage industry by doing that here

24:19.000 --> 24:27.000
so the irony if you should ever become homeless and then I end up you're down there wearing

24:27.000 --> 24:34.000
a Rick and Morty shirt and you say same guy give it to you gave it to me maybe you can

24:34.000 --> 24:40.000
have an estate sale and have people come over by the shit lug it away and wander the

24:40.000 --> 24:48.000
premises in your boxer shorts crying about how this was your dad's house I think you're

24:48.000 --> 24:54.000
on to something there brandy is that all under the category of that's where the state sale

24:54.000 --> 25:06.000
is okay so I could pretend I died and that I'm my own uncle or something like that like

25:06.000 --> 25:19.000
you can be you can be whoever you want you could be like I do like a Marvin Gaye's dad

25:19.000 --> 25:32.000
I can't I'm out of bail I shot my son would you like his bedspread I gotta make bail why

25:32.000 --> 25:38.000
price is so low prices is so low because I gotta make bail by the way if you're listening

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
and you're part of the Marvin Gaye family I'm sorry so sorry that's I that's it the

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
new I tell you you can't you can't joke about anything like everyone's counting now they're

25:46.000 --> 25:56.000
counting that blurred lines money for the folks at home what's the Marvin Gaye family

25:56.000 --> 26:01.000
doing well I don't know what the Marvin Gaye family is doing but you know what have they

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
done you know Marvin Marvin Gaye was a singer classic was he in the Commodores what was

26:05.000 --> 26:10.000
it no no he was his own thing he was Marvin Gaye and Tammy Terrell it was a Motons you

26:10.000 --> 26:17.000
know a staple until he shot his son his dad's dad's oh he was jealous jealous dad his dad

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
shot him because he stood up to his father his father had been abusive to his mom sure

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
for years then the Marvin fell on some hard times had to move back in with the parents

26:25.000 --> 26:31.000
was like you can't keep talking to mom like that especially now that I've been famous

26:31.000 --> 26:36.000
that's fucking a break yeah then was like laying down asleep and his dad came in and

26:36.000 --> 26:45.000
was like I shot him man see family is the worst right right probably not a controversial

26:45.000 --> 26:52.000
opinion but what a shitty dad yeah well you know I don't want to go I don't want to you

26:52.000 --> 26:59.000
know play the devil's advocate here but I'm on his but sometimes kids can be a drag as

26:59.000 --> 27:04.000
though you're sometimes you want to you want to be mean to your wife you can't have people

27:04.000 --> 27:10.000
telling you not to do that yeah I mean yeah I was supposed to do listen to them you're

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
a product of the twisted relationship between me and your mother how dear you condemn it

27:14.000 --> 27:21.000
right that's almost like saying I'm doing something wrong sort of say shout out to all

27:21.000 --> 27:26.000
the dudes who punch their dads in the face for some shit like that hell yeah hope you

27:26.000 --> 27:34.000
don't get shot right I wonder what the statistics are is there a word for is there a side you

27:34.000 --> 27:43.000
know cide prefects for you know we have patricide matricide we have infanticide fratricide what

27:43.000 --> 27:53.000
is there is there a side I think it's for killing your offspring yeah okay if you say

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
insecticide I'm gonna come out there you're like a evil villain with a bow tie I'm the

27:58.000 --> 28:09.000
word miser are you looking for something I've got it I will not explain I'll nearly acknowledge

28:09.000 --> 28:20.000
its existence you have 20 questions do you know the word no you're just starting you're

28:20.000 --> 28:25.000
just you're just voting confidence in the English language you're like look I know old lady

28:25.000 --> 28:40.000
English has got it it's a different guy but there our audience is just I mean you got to

28:40.000 --> 28:47.000
make your own fun in this episode I agree like don't rush anything I am on your side it's

28:47.000 --> 28:56.000
the same prefects when you know nephra nephra side I love which is also which is the wikipedia

28:56.000 --> 29:10.000
says fill a side what's that fi li side fill aside motherfucker nephra side we know what that

29:10.000 --> 29:18.000
really means it's the next episode nephra side it's also possible it could be both right

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
like I mean yeah yeah there's plenty of words but he had arrogance that made it sound like

29:22.000 --> 29:34.000
it could only be one and that was a mistake aside so hack why is it speaking of language

29:34.000 --> 29:44.000
evolving I think it is that I will never use an emoji but I will constantly use animated

29:44.000 --> 29:52.000
gifts like like what is that about me do you use emoticons I have you know I won't use emoticons

29:52.000 --> 29:59.000
when I was growing up that emoticons were the beginning of it was like people using

29:59.000 --> 30:08.000
colon and a parenthesis to indicate a smile or a frown we were like the the the the purists

30:08.000 --> 30:15.000
among us for like that was like how dare you like if you can't communicate your state

30:15.000 --> 30:21.000
or your position or whether I should take you seriously without like reverting to the

30:21.000 --> 30:29.000
ape-like behavior that chased us here to this haven like why are you bringing that here it

30:29.000 --> 30:37.000
was like people would do ascii roses in chat rooms you know here's a rose classic yeah I

30:37.000 --> 30:44.000
mean I you know the heroes among us hated those people and then the emoji came along

30:44.000 --> 30:51.000
yeah why do a why do emoticons when you can do an emoji and I can't I won't touch it I

30:51.000 --> 31:00.000
won't do it I also won't type lol I'll only type haha I don't understand what my definition

31:00.000 --> 31:06.000
of of those boundaries are and I especially don't understand why I think animated gifts

31:06.000 --> 31:11.000
are the fucking greatest things on sliced bread yeah I think that's amazing that I don't

31:11.000 --> 31:17.000
think it is whether it's ironic or sincere like I'll I'll like I'll just throw you an

31:17.000 --> 31:23.000
image of Jim Carrey going I I likey likey like whatever like I don't I don't I don't

31:23.000 --> 31:29.000
suffer a moment of indecision about it I don't think I'm selling out it's like 50 cent

31:29.000 --> 31:35.000
like fucking smiling and then driving away and then birds in the backseat I don't I love

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
it all yeah they're genius because the little mini movies that you can throw at somebody

31:39.000 --> 31:46.000
why is that why does that meet my definition of classy or like what hip or what is it it's

31:46.000 --> 31:53.000
a chance at sarcasm like never before I don't know I did like like is it is it because

31:53.000 --> 32:01.000
emo if you if you send an emoji what you're doing is is your is it is about inductive

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
versus deductive like I kind of like the shape of the telescope like you're looking through

32:05.000 --> 32:09.000
the image and like if I send Oprah if you say something to me and I send you an image of

32:09.000 --> 32:17.000
Oprah going like it's more up to you what that means and that therefore I'm like I'm

32:17.000 --> 32:23.000
not I'm kind of like being more creative by choosing that Oprah picture well I think that

32:23.000 --> 32:28.000
memes are I mean gifts are basically just memes so it's essentially like responding

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
with like a can joke like that's what she said you know it's like you're being clever

32:32.000 --> 32:37.000
using cultural context you're kind of hacking more than you are participating right whereas

32:37.000 --> 32:43.000
emojis are just simply like you're just crudely depicting certain concepts using images instead

32:43.000 --> 32:49.000
of words when you could easily use words so it's essentially language whereas a gif is

32:49.000 --> 32:54.000
more of like it's it's it's more of like a joke or something but I think easily that's

32:54.000 --> 33:00.000
just a matter of I mean you're I appreciate you saying that but you probably know that

33:00.000 --> 33:04.000
totally a subjective thing than that and oh shit number of these kids would be like that's

33:04.000 --> 33:09.000
exactly what I do when I send an eggplant emoji or right or even a smiling emoji using

33:09.000 --> 33:14.000
those characters like they're they're creating a language using these new symbols they're

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
essentially new letters but you know that's like creating their own meaning and so you

33:18.000 --> 33:22.000
could like do the jack-off thing and that's maybe a step removed but that's different

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
than like the sweating in the hand which are just letters you know whereas I think you're

33:26.000 --> 33:31.000
communicating the full idea when you share a meme or a gif it's like it's again more like

33:31.000 --> 33:36.000
a joke and it is almost like it's almost like albums to DJs so like certain people have

33:36.000 --> 33:44.000
incredible collections of gifts and like and memes so if you're like if you're pet if

33:44.000 --> 33:48.000
you're petty like myself and you're online and you're you're flaming and you're going

33:48.000 --> 33:53.000
back and forth with somebody if they have like a just a fucking Pokemon ball size or

33:53.000 --> 34:05.000
collection I don't play Pokemon because I met girls and shit was half laugh and half

34:05.000 --> 34:12.000
bald up fists and I respect you all for that but some people have like an arsenal of just

34:12.000 --> 34:18.000
like images to throw at you and also okay so maybe this is what's key about it is that

34:18.000 --> 34:25.000
with the emoji library that you're choosing from you're not choosing from a circulated

34:25.000 --> 34:36.000
cabin of air there's a cultural tint to an animated gif library even if because I'm not

34:36.000 --> 34:43.000
going to lie I don't I don't curate a fucking folder of awesome gifts and make them and

34:43.000 --> 34:51.000
stuff but people do and because people do it's kind of a little closer to sending a piece

34:51.000 --> 34:57.000
of wall graffiti that because there's a culture out there of people who are continuously

34:57.000 --> 35:04.000
updating and circulating images pulling them from TV shows and things and if you're drawing

35:04.000 --> 35:11.000
from that pile you're at least drawing from something more vibrant than the idea of Pepsi

35:11.000 --> 35:18.000
or something to you here's the 109 images to choose from this fiscal quarter here's how

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
here's how you say I'm going swimming it's a drawing of a guy going swimming but over

35:22.000 --> 35:29.000
here it's like like here's the latest in in but but where it fails is where it's like

35:29.000 --> 35:36.000
people can use gifts to be just as banal and horrendously enforcing of like horrible toxic

35:36.000 --> 35:42.000
like I remember when when Megan Gans was like like like reaching out to me on Twitter and

35:42.000 --> 35:47.000
going like you hurt me or whatever and like the the people that were like all the popcorn

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
gifts of people eating popcorn and then other people going like you're gross like like

35:51.000 --> 35:56.000
that's this is a gross time for that what the fuck what I'm eating popcorn right and

35:56.000 --> 36:04.000
it was like that is like the same sickening thing that emojis do it reduces us to yeah

36:04.000 --> 36:12.000
like keys on a keyboard and but the the healthy idea of it is what did you just say and then

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
you like you just you're pulling you can you can type words into the little Giffy engine

36:16.000 --> 36:21.000
but it's still like okay here's Steve Carell like getting a pint his face or something

36:21.000 --> 36:26.000
but what's cool about the like gifts and memes is that like you have to pick it yourself

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
which means you have to like know it exists like these days you can search for like

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
keywords or whatever and get one but like it's an artistic decision to pick one that

36:34.000 --> 36:38.000
you think fits best and that's also very much like me meaning where it's like there's a

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
bunch of different things that are kind of this basic joke but you pick this one because

36:42.000 --> 36:47.000
it's the most applicable whereas I'll type like I'll type like I went there right into

36:47.000 --> 36:53.000
Giffy and then it'll come up yeah and that's how I discovered that 50 cent like dry it's

36:53.000 --> 36:58.000
like he's not saying I went there as he's driving away but it's like that's what comes

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
up when you type I went there or whatever and then I like and then Cody and I discovered

37:02.000 --> 37:08.000
that and then we have a relationship with that gift like we keep on sending 50 cent to

37:08.000 --> 37:13.000
each other like driving it's like an old meme and you can look up the origin of it and

37:13.000 --> 37:18.000
like all the then people add like Bert in the back seat as he's driving away and stuff

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
yeah. Yeah but I don't think emoji has that I think you can kind of get there but it's

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
just at the end of the day it's just like this means man this means hand this means

37:26.000 --> 37:31.000
dollar bills you know and this means I'm talking to you like this so like it's all the most

37:31.000 --> 37:36.000
obnoxious shit. Who has ever done that? The worst is the fucking crying thing it's like

37:36.000 --> 37:42.000
it's like I just oh yeah the crying laughing it just makes me so fucking mad that it's

37:42.000 --> 37:48.000
it's like taking the LOL phenomenon which is like like like people just type LOL or

37:48.000 --> 37:54.000
ROFL or LMA like it's just it's just such a nervous twitch that everyone wants

37:54.000 --> 38:00.000
everyone to know they're laughing at them condescendingly it's so fucking toxic I fucking

38:00.000 --> 38:05.000
hate it like like if you're gonna condescend to someone you should know how to condescend

38:05.000 --> 38:11.000
not tell them you're condescending it's fucking horse shit that you can raise a flag while

38:11.000 --> 38:16.000
you're talking going by the way I'm condescending to you no you're not allowed to you don't

38:16.000 --> 38:23.000
have the words. Yeah it does kind of feel like LOL would be like executed like LOL.

38:23.000 --> 38:28.000
It's like holding up a photo of Frasier like while you're talking by the way I'm super

38:28.000 --> 38:35.000
smart right and from Seattle no you're not put that down. That would be cool I like

38:35.000 --> 38:40.000
like you're not allowed to do that that's that's that's one of the big it's like it's

38:40.000 --> 38:44.000
like fucking like that I guess that's me like really shaking my cane it was like in my

38:44.000 --> 38:51.000
day you could really you had to be a genuinely condescending person they would had to be

38:51.000 --> 38:56.000
in your fucking veins you couldn't just like go get your mail and be like oh I wish I was

38:56.000 --> 39:01.000
one of those condescending types and then and then just be like oh these letters and

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
then condescending and like you're not no you're not you're a sincere hillbilly you're

39:05.000 --> 39:10.000
not condescending at all you're an idiot you can't condescend to anything but maybe

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
like a termite that's eating your garage that you could be like I'm gonna get you

39:14.000 --> 39:22.000
lm lmao it's it's because there's a printing price now so yeah I mean these are the frustration

39:22.000 --> 39:26.000
that's the thing that's making me real I'm like I'm only I'm only expressing the

39:26.000 --> 39:31.000
frustrations that the fucking status quo expressed to Gutenberg yeah when he

39:31.000 --> 39:41.000
printed police academy whoa yeah when the when the when Martin Luther was like I

39:41.000 --> 39:53.000
I have a dream that Bibles should be in German instead of Latin I don't think these I don't

39:53.000 --> 40:01.000
know if these hilarious historical mix them up sir I don't know if they're they're

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
not landing because you don't get them you're just sort of like why are you doing

40:04.000 --> 40:11.000
what are these is this like fractured flickers like a 1950s comedian are you

40:11.000 --> 40:19.000
gonna do let's spoonerism that's funerals next Finder cello okay well looking at

40:19.000 --> 40:23.000

40:23.000 --> 40:30.000
spoonerism act there we go Finder cello was a was a sin press I don't think they

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
mixed the words up no I know it's we're isms are there you you flip the first word

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
of two words or to first letter but then you have to know that's that's

40:37.000 --> 40:43.000
Cinder Fella and then you have to care about that and I'm like I saw a dude

40:43.000 --> 40:47.000
in Milwaukee it was like an old-timer and he did a whole stand-up act so do you

40:47.000 --> 40:52.000

40:56.000 --> 41:00.000
gonna do the deaf jam open mic and we both this is awesome and and at the time

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
it was like it was like a new concept the deaf jam thing and Schrab and I was

41:03.000 --> 41:08.000
very young and I I went out was like yeah I just played to my whiteness and

41:08.000 --> 41:12.000
like the Milwaukee black crowd was like totally respectful and supportive because

41:12.000 --> 41:16.000
I was like I was totally cheap and was like look at me I'm the white guy but

41:16.000 --> 41:20.000

42:54.000 --> 42:59.000
like everyone's like see I was on his side from the beginning but he just

42:59.000 --> 43:07.000
finished up and it was like and then he got in a hearse and drove into a pit the

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
weird thing is we had never it was Milwaukee so you think you know everybody

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
and that this guy just came out of nowhere I think he might have been a

43:13.000 --> 43:20.000
ghost yeah I think his his hair might have been snakes like you go to his agent

43:20.000 --> 43:24.000
and go hey what was with that guy did you book him in the wrong room that guy

43:24.000 --> 43:32.000
died 30 years ago if you listen closely you can still hear his act in all black

43:32.000 --> 43:41.000
rooms why is that ghost up here again why did he do that it's not the

43:41.000 --> 43:46.000
response you want from an audience I'm just still stuck on this Finder cella

43:46.000 --> 43:52.000
because I realized that the reason it's Finder cella is because you have to put

43:52.000 --> 43:56.000
the F in there otherwise there's nothing to spoonerize because it would just be

43:56.000 --> 44:01.000
Inder cella which is just nothing like that's spoonerizing with a non present

44:01.000 --> 44:08.000
letter yeah I I don't know what to do with the old cube

44:08.000 --> 44:16.000
what was wrong with the old cube it was small okay I don't like the reaction

44:16.000 --> 44:22.000
that got it made me feel insecure well I think it's a just don't you're not gonna

44:22.000 --> 44:27.000
drink out of this you're not gonna no no I meant that you say it was too small

44:27.000 --> 44:32.000
really titillated people well they were cuz they were watching my just they were

44:32.000 --> 44:38.000
watching me the whole time they're like a dumb monkey how and what what have you

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
managed to get to the new place and and why like what did you need that you were

44:42.000 --> 44:47.000
like I gotta stop fucking around I need knives we can I tell one more story from

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
that stand we'll get this remember like there's so I have so much sense memory

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
of that that particular club I can't remember its name but it had the deaf

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
jam night that it also would have like a regular comedy night like I got

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
ostensibly for white people I don't know but like it's like it was a different

45:02.000 --> 45:09.000
anyone please come and I remember there was this magician and he came there early

45:09.000 --> 45:14.000
and I was like I'm gonna do my shitty stand-up act and this magician who just

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
like he was one of two magicians in Milwaukee and he was a constant presence

45:18.000 --> 45:26.000
at every every open mic and he something set up and he's like Dan I think I'm

45:26.000 --> 45:31.000
glad you're here sit sitting back but right in the middle right in the middle

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
and it was like this empty house and I sat in back and then he's like he played

45:35.000 --> 45:43.000
like Susie in the banshee song I was like kiss them for me and he made this

45:43.000 --> 45:48.000
like handkerchief dance and go in a aquarium and then it came out of the

45:48.000 --> 45:53.000
aquarium and and he finished he did the whole did this three-minute thing where

45:53.000 --> 45:56.000
he made this handkerchief dance and I was like really entertained by it because

45:56.000 --> 46:01.000
it's like geez the energy put into this guy like pulling these strings with his

46:01.000 --> 46:05.000
hands on his that are attached to his rings and he's like making this handkerchief

46:05.000 --> 46:11.000
dance it was like that's impressive and it was like I was like yeah it's really

46:11.000 --> 46:17.000
cool it's cool like that must have taken a lot of work and he's like yeah yeah

46:17.000 --> 46:23.000
did and I was like it I don't know what I said where it was like I didn't mean

46:23.000 --> 46:31.000
to because I didn't realize I didn't know that you weren't supposed to see the strings

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
like because he that was the reason why he was making me sit somewhere and he's

46:34.000 --> 46:38.000
like just watch this is what's this and then I was like like that's cool like

46:38.000 --> 46:46.000
this so the strings are just on your rings or whatever he was like he fucking

46:46.000 --> 46:56.000
I've never seen a human being like he was like because he had asked me to sit like

46:56.000 --> 47:01.000
that chair no that no right to your left holy shit so he must have been like that

47:01.000 --> 47:06.000
least that person won't see them or was it like that's the one chair left like

47:06.000 --> 47:10.000
had he had had he been there all night and had he had like his girlfriends in

47:10.000 --> 47:17.000
every chair I just accidentally triggered a fucking meltdown that's yeah but it

47:17.000 --> 47:21.000
was crazy because I was impressed I was like well that's fun like like a hanky

47:21.000 --> 47:25.000
on some strings tied to your rings and they're like pulleys everywhere and it

47:25.000 --> 47:31.000
was like like that's fun oh it's fun I like it doesn't I don't have to believe

47:31.000 --> 47:36.000
that there's an angel helping you like that's silly like I know that there's

47:36.000 --> 47:41.000
no ghosts happening you literally were like are those bunnies gonna be safe in

47:41.000 --> 47:47.000
that box I really was not trying to be a dick I swear no not at all because you

47:47.000 --> 47:51.000
were in love with the actual ballet of the whole situation because you know

47:51.000 --> 47:55.000
weren't supposed to see that shit the back then it was like there was like a

47:55.000 --> 48:00.000
serious fucking turf war like people the stakes were high before karaoke wiped us

48:00.000 --> 48:08.000
all out the the boy were people proud of their craft and I remember a friend of

48:08.000 --> 48:14.000
mine and everybody smoked back then and like I've told the story before but it

48:14.000 --> 48:18.000
was just like like like scenes from the class struggle in open mic comedy in

48:18.000 --> 48:27.000
Milwaukee in 1989 like it there was a comic who he was a magician sorry that's

48:27.000 --> 48:32.000
the whole point of the story who never the twain shall meet he somebody had

48:32.000 --> 48:38.000
broken into the safe house in Milwaukee and in this place like there was this

48:38.000 --> 48:42.000
door that you could just kick in from the sidewalk safe house the safe house is

48:42.000 --> 48:48.000
like a tourist trap in Milwaukee sounds like such an action moron oh it's one

48:48.000 --> 48:55.000
of those Milwaukee tourist traps hey you're in Milwaukee you'll pay anything

48:55.000 --> 49:00.000
God knows you won't take your business to Chicago but it was just sort of like it

49:00.000 --> 49:05.000
was like this spy themed bar okay that had a secret entrance okay and it had an

49:05.000 --> 49:10.000
open mic where you were you would perform for like up to five Austin

49:10.000 --> 49:16.000
businessmen who were sleeping off a red eye it would just like practice dying in

49:16.000 --> 49:23.000
this place and but and and one of the one of the magicians that stored their

49:23.000 --> 49:28.000
stuff got somebody somebody kicked in a door and the closest thing to the door

49:28.000 --> 49:34.000
was like a trunk full of magic shit and they took it and I came to the open

49:34.000 --> 49:39.000
wake night that night and wouldn't that that magician was just like crying yeah

49:39.000 --> 49:43.000
was like like no what the fuck they fucking took all my shit it was fucking

49:43.000 --> 49:48.000
like five thousand dollars worth of shit like all these like like genuinely had a

49:48.000 --> 49:53.000
bunch and I just remember like my friend and mentor like a young comic but still

49:53.000 --> 49:59.000
way older than me because I was like 17 and like he's got a camel light dangling

49:59.000 --> 50:04.000
from his lips and he's like you can still smoke indoors and he's like oh god

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
that's so that's a fucking bummer that's a bummer man bummer and then he the guy

50:08.000 --> 50:13.000
goes running off to like fret and like talk to police or file his report about

50:13.000 --> 50:17.000
his magic trunk and he just turns to me I was like that's what you get for being a

50:17.000 --> 50:26.000
fucking prop comic and it was just said with no fucking humor nothing it was just

50:26.000 --> 50:31.000
like like yeah you fucking Hispanic you know it was just like this race war

50:31.000 --> 50:38.000
between performers like the fucking jet like you know here's the thing like

50:38.000 --> 50:44.000
here's the thing puppets props all that shit big time war gangs not a lot of

50:44.000 --> 50:49.000
places to perform don't want to follow a dude with a prop but at the same time

50:49.000 --> 50:56.000
sometimes good Willie Tyler Lester people puppets not so bad puppet musicals

50:56.000 --> 51:02.000
all sorts of shit Henson great but here's the thing honor among comics we

51:02.000 --> 51:06.000
don't shit on each other we don't yeah the comic you're crazy because you have

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
a credit card machine attached to your fucking briefcase and that's a great

51:09.000 --> 51:13.000
bit for you I'm not mad at you for that shit I'm just thankful I don't have to

51:13.000 --> 51:18.000
carry that shit around it was great it was great yeah it was crazy how mad we'd

51:18.000 --> 51:22.000
get about about people who had like the same shtick or they had like they would

51:22.000 --> 51:27.000
kill yeah it was like they would kill yeah that doesn't deserve to kill that's

51:27.000 --> 51:31.000
a bunch of bullshit it's like what are we striving for here we want to earn our

51:31.000 --> 51:37.000
keep because we want to suffer like what did we we were ship Bill Hicks you

51:37.000 --> 51:43.000
know right everybody wanted to be Bill Hicks everybody wanted to be the truth

51:43.000 --> 51:48.000
bringer the light giver the the that perfect blend between like you've got a

51:48.000 --> 51:53.000
strong 45 but you you're also like so fucking filled with rage but it's like

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
not everybody's filled with rage like that was the fucked up thing is everybody

51:57.000 --> 52:03.000
wanted to be angry and everybody wanted to kill and like not die and yeah it was

52:03.000 --> 52:07.000
everybody wanted to be Bill Hicks and a lot of people would have been better

52:07.000 --> 52:11.000
Stephen Wright's yeah like a lot of people were like cornball cutesy funny and

52:11.000 --> 52:16.000
we would we would we would ridicule them yeah because if they were too cutesy

52:16.000 --> 52:21.000
or something if they were to PG yeah people that didn't work blue sometimes

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
you'd respect them but they'd have to fucking murder in order for you to

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
respect them if they don't work blue because it's like what are you trying to

52:27.000 --> 52:31.000
say you you're not you're not allowed to say fuck you're in a fucking bar like

52:31.000 --> 52:35.000
like just like the crazy factionalism is so entertaining to me now looking back

52:35.000 --> 52:40.000
but what's really funny about it is like we the presupposition was that one tribe

52:40.000 --> 52:45.000
was gonna win out and what's funny is that they like I was there for the

52:45.000 --> 52:50.000
karaoke machines being rolled in one by one and it was like it used to be

52:50.000 --> 52:55.000
comedy versus darts it was like it was like like like my friend Sean McKenna

52:55.000 --> 52:59.000
at the at the LA freeway which was a Milwaukee like bar that I did my first

52:59.000 --> 53:04.000
open mic he was like he would he would say hey it's open mic night folks and

53:04.000 --> 53:08.000
you know that because you can't play darts and it was like it was true it was

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
like that was the big problem with it it was like well there's a microphone in

53:11.000 --> 53:16.000
front of the dartboard so and and then but then five years later it was like

53:16.000 --> 53:21.000
they're just these dudes with mustaches like rolling in with these dollies of

53:21.000 --> 53:26.000
weird sci-fi equipment it was like what is that it's karaoke what does that mean

53:26.000 --> 53:32.000
yeah karaoke yeah it's a Japanese thing where you sing other people's songs it

53:32.000 --> 53:39.000
was like the fuck is this a year later done everyone get yeah why would the

53:39.000 --> 53:46.000
Holiday Inn next to the airport ever want a fucking alcoholic slob to

53:46.000 --> 53:51.000
berate the people waiting in the lobby if they can replace them for 20% less

53:51.000 --> 53:57.000
with a fucking music machine that lets them sing I will survive like they will

53:57.000 --> 54:01.000
make them come in by the drums it was just like this crazy boogie nights thing

54:01.000 --> 54:06.000
of like oh you've been replaced with joy you've been all of your conversations

54:06.000 --> 54:11.000
about what's hack of the oh that guy's act is hack because he's he's above the

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
belt and he doesn't work blue he's too blue oh he's he's ripping off Andrew

54:14.000 --> 54:22.000
Dice Clay he's ripping off Kevin Durant Durant

54:22.000 --> 54:28.000
Kevin Sorbo all that Hercules stuff thanks

54:28.000 --> 54:33.000
just all wiped out wiped out by this other thing that we never had a chance

54:33.000 --> 54:38.000
to factionalize we never were like oh singing people we're all extinct like

54:38.000 --> 54:43.000
that was funny alright anyways you're asking me a provocative question about

54:43.000 --> 54:49.000
moving about what it takes to make the list to be transferred yeah I don't

54:49.000 --> 54:53.000
know and that's that's the weird Zen tales bin I man I wake up in the morning

54:53.000 --> 54:58.000
and I go I need shit in this house and then I'm like what shit are you gonna

54:58.000 --> 55:03.000
put in this house and then I'm like I don't know a microphone because I'm

55:03.000 --> 55:09.000
good but I'm like do you talk to your therapist about this I haven't really

55:09.000 --> 55:15.000
yet I that could be fun might get you a couple more weeks so yeah take your

55:15.000 --> 55:20.000
microphone she would just say oh that's well that's where you're at you know

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
like I think that's really profound like that's where you're a little more

55:23.000 --> 55:28.000
changing you're changing you know she's really into it like but we have a

55:28.000 --> 55:32.000
shorthand league shit we got like oh that's not who Dan Heller is like I'm

55:32.000 --> 55:36.000
like like whether I would literally take Cody's name or not I like the idea that

55:36.000 --> 55:41.000
I'm Dan Heller now yeah or like I'm not Dan Heller yet because I like I keep

55:41.000 --> 55:46.000
fucking up like but I like to think in my head like I'm turning into a different

55:46.000 --> 55:52.000
guy yeah my older age Joseph Campbell talks about that like in like tribal

55:52.000 --> 55:57.000
cultures there's like you know old men they they get reborn they change the way

55:57.000 --> 56:01.000
they dress at a certain age and they go from being like they'll actually change

56:01.000 --> 56:07.000
their identity yeah they'll be like oh I was I was fucking kicking bird but now

56:07.000 --> 56:21.000
I'm like screaming screaming stereotype screaming stereotype give me your wisdom

56:21.000 --> 56:27.000
well I don't have that much I'm just a I'm just an eye cloud of tropes that Dan

56:27.000 --> 56:36.000
Harmon got from fivemovies I thought it would be eat eat laxatives and get off my

56:36.000 --> 56:41.000
life but that is the thing like think I mean that like they were like western

56:41.000 --> 56:46.000
culture you go like what that's what we totally deny ourselves we deny ourselves

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
the right I was I was on Duncan Trussell's podcast recently and we talked a lot

56:50.000 --> 56:55.000
about the right to change your mind how we punish it how yeah that is true like

56:55.000 --> 57:01.000
like like like we especially like like we definitely do not want and it's

57:01.000 --> 57:05.000
something that that occurred to me is like all the endless debate and

57:05.000 --> 57:09.000
investigation that we commit to the idea of nature versus nurture which is totally

57:09.000 --> 57:15.000
valid like that's of course that's a totally like that's of academic interest

57:15.000 --> 57:21.000
nature or nurture did your mom's genes make you a serial killer or was it the

57:21.000 --> 57:27.000
thing your mom made you eat but either way it was your mom exactly either way it

57:27.000 --> 57:32.000
wasn't you either way it wasn't you and that's the thing that we it's profound

57:32.000 --> 57:36.000
how much we debate about nature versus nurture but we don't debate about will

57:36.000 --> 57:41.000
versus free will that much you have to like sign up for a weird unmarketable

57:41.000 --> 57:45.000
college class in order to have these conversations about are we choosing

57:45.000 --> 57:50.000
anything ever or are we just products of a bunch of fucking shit that's either

57:50.000 --> 57:56.000
nature and or nurture but do we do we actually like see I fucks with that

57:56.000 --> 58:01.000
argument constantly the do we choose can we move can we make our own way sort of

58:01.000 --> 58:06.000
thing and it is weird because to a certain degree we do sort of choose is

58:06.000 --> 58:12.000
my is my thought I side with that because the alternative is going insane like

58:12.000 --> 58:16.000
you're just like a chuchu train going around a Christmas tree he called God's

58:16.000 --> 58:23.000
board yeah no reason and you're just like oh it's I feel like I'm choosing

58:23.000 --> 58:29.000
whole wheat over Ryan God's like nope that's your fucking dopamine idiot fucking

58:29.000 --> 58:35.000
little clockwork man yeah way to choose wheat this time you fucking matchbox

58:35.000 --> 58:41.000
car also so boring to watch us if we were constantly making the wrong choices

58:41.000 --> 58:46.000
like be just watching a tragedy day after day so in order for it to be a sitcom

58:46.000 --> 58:50.000
and fun to watch there's a little bit of free will that goes on but there's a

58:50.000 --> 58:54.000
certain amount of fucking up that also is part of it I like this idea that

58:54.000 --> 59:01.000
there's free wills and illusion and God is watching that he's because the

59:01.000 --> 59:07.000
why did I do this this is it but that is like an old man watching a model train

59:07.000 --> 59:11.000
like you set up a model train set and then you watch it go around and do

59:11.000 --> 59:17.000
exactly what you anticipated it would do and if it fucks up you fix it like if

59:17.000 --> 59:22.000
the train makes its own decision you call that my I fucked up making my model

59:22.000 --> 59:28.000
train my understanding was I read in the past that a science scientists

59:28.000 --> 59:33.000
generally have formed the consensus that free will is illusion but if you think

59:33.000 --> 59:38.000
about that it doesn't help so for all intents and purposes it's not but but

59:38.000 --> 59:44.000
scientifically it is which means that like I think that means that astrology is

59:44.000 --> 59:52.000
real right I mean it's the equivalent for sure yeah I was born like this yeah so

59:52.000 --> 59:58.000
oh so I'm just a guy who was born in this house on this date and then my mom did

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
this and then my dad did this and then the school I went to this happened and

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:07.000
licorice was in season and right and so here I am doing this podcast saying

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
these words that I'm about to say there they go there go those words that I was

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000
already about to say that's so I mean I guess that's what Westworld was about

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:22.000
maybe that was a good I thought it was a bag of shit maybe it was profound oh I

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:31.000
just got it the piano roll oh shit was that your ring yeah Dan's ring flew off

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:38.000
for the folks at home who applauded my ring flying off fucking incels they're

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:49.000
everywhere finding love is the worst thing ever happened to you you think

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.000
that magician like that's always how he reacts to people getting his illusions

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:02.000
it's like yeah you just put that card there fuck

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.000
that's a bad temperament for a magician I think well it's a bad temperament

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:13.000
really I saw the inside of his apartment once oh no what and I will never trust

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:24.000
magicians again I was like whoa there's the trick yeah what is you being out in

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:33.000
society yeah is the prestige like this is was it a mess temple to self abuse yeah

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
and also you have a living girlfriend who of course is your assistant at like

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.000
like and if she stops being your assistant there will be a new girlfriend and

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.000
she will be your assistant because the other one escaped and like like because

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:56.000
because she unlike these dying doves in this cage who are just wondering am I

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:03.000
next for the sleeve like if there could be a Pixar movie there's like yellow

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.000
feathered doves like in this lightless apartment going like dude you're going

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:14.000
in the sleeve next you hear that phone call that was his manager you're going

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000
to Toronto you're going in the sleeve you're going in the fucking dove holster

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:31.000
you you're not gonna make it holy shit the blackness the dark fucking hole it

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:37.000
was like just because I think when you're a magician you do have license to

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000
justify your apartment being caked in debris you can go well that's a bunch of

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:49.000
magic newspaper I can't throw that away I might have to I might need that to

01:02:49.000 --> 01:03:06.000
put it in that broken refrigerator god damn no not a magician an open mic

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:12.000
magician god that's darkest yeah I mean but have you that's like okay for the

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:18.000
clan to hate darkness which only happens if you're really dark right

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:25.000
yeah yeah justifiable well okay so just to understand I'm not trying to to

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:30.000
gotcha journalism but I understood that your apartment was pretty messy so how

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.000
did this make an impact on you I think well animals obviously is a huge step

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000
no you're right you're absolutely right I mean I ended up living in just as much

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000
filth as a magician oh but you see so at the time you made that judgment you had

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000
a better place I had the privilege of being a college dropout who was like

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
basically still living with I was just living like a college kid like I was

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.000
sure yeah I was going from a dorm room to like oh hey can I crash in your attic

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000
and so I didn't have enough stuff to be filthy right I would definitely graduate

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000
to that very quickly you're absolutely right gotcha I said it was a gotcha it

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000
was no I'm kidding sorry I just want to because I don't know it sounded like

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000
obviously like and sad animals and then the mess they make is definitely like a

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
level above but I was just trying to understand because it sounded like it

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
wasn't necessarily the level of mess but then you're saying stuff that indicated

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:29.000
it might have been anyway yeah what's up have you like oh buffalo why did you go

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:35.000
wings yes what what made you I was just I was like I was like Bob Dylan I was

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000
trying to learn about I was I would I don't know I would pick somebody up drive

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:47.000
to a gig I I can't remember honestly I would like I I was like I'm focusing on

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000
my comedy so I'm like in it to win it like I don't know I was in the biz and I

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
just wondered I can't I yeah maybe I would pick maybe I was picking him up

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000
maybe I maybe my car was working and his wasn't maybe maybe maybe we were

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.000
gonna write a script together I have no idea I can't remember but it is it yeah

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000
it is but I mean yeah in terms of overall filth not as meaningful as much as

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000
like these guys they perform in these fancy costumes and they have names like

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:22.000
the great zander and like to a man they do not it's like like they don't live in

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.000
like a loft that's like a maculet and there's like oh my illusion chest it's

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.000
like no it's just a fucking filth nest like because because how else are you

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:38.000
gonna learn to roll quarters on your knuckles it's not by cleaning up you

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000
have to sit and like eat string cheese and like let the wrapper fall out of your

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000
mouth like you know if you want to get the jump on the other magicians that are

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000
like practicing just as much quarter rolling on the knuckles you have to sit

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000
there and fucking like flip cards over and over again you're gonna watch

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Colombo and collect mucus no these tricks you can learn these tricks you

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.000
don't need to like suffer you have to practice that shit I mean it's manual

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.000
it's not like the gymnast house has diarrhea all up maybe you don't know

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000
any good gymnast a gymnast house has fucking emotional trauma all over it

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000
because they're 11 years old and they've been their souls been shattered

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.000
because they have no agency he was supposed to have a workshop like a magic

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
shop yeah like it that's what it would be in like the Colombo episode where the

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000
suspect was a magician everybody welcome to my loft right there's my freight elevator

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000
and here's my guillotine trick and like because a production designer designed

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:42.000
my nest like there's not shit everywhere but the truth is dirty people dirty

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:51.000
people there was an and high suicide rate to yeah yeah there was a there was a

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000
there was a there was a magician that worked at the same fast and we would his

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000
car was in the parking lot it was very clear he was living in it like like and

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.000
it was like he's still like they wear like three-piece suits and like ties but

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000
it was like then they get in this like Dennis Woodruff station wagon with a

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:12.000
portal let hanging off the back and like a fucking bag of pee on the handle and

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:21.000
I love how we started off started off saying hey we're all equal

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:27.000
and then by the time we were done like lousy fucking magicians with their I just

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.000
have a picture with people going to the looks like it's like in a world where

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:37.000
like it's like I'm gonna lie to people yeah I don't want to get better at that

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:43.000
I'm not dishonest enough yeah I gotta get real good what our friend Asperger

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:47.000
detective would call redirecting light like I'm gonna I'm gonna make you think

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:53.000
this handkerchief is floating because God is real I I'm not content to just be

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.000
like check out my fucking thing where I like put these wires and I made this

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:04.000
handkerchief again like I mean God bless but God damn

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:21.000
that should be the title of the podcast God bless it breaks my heart to feel bad

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:29.000
for a magician God damn that's like when you find out that shit about people at

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Disney and they're like puking in the heads and there's catacombs underneath

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000
where they feel like they have to have to eat this burrito really fast so I

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.000
can get outside and deal to do the business and you're like damn Disney

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:49.000
yeah damn or like ballerina's feet are all mashed up yeah that's worth it well

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000
it's working yeah but it's sad to find out you're like oh he's so beautiful

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:59.000
jumping over the yeah my feet are all purple yeah everybody should have to know

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:03.000
what every other profession goes through just to do the shit or you go like what

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.000
a beautiful breed of dog yeah well it's bred for fucking I have to clean its

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:14.000
sinuses out with a q-tip or it'll die overnight yeah we because someone in

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.000
England thought their faces looked adorable that way we uh it's a mush face

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:25.000
dog it can't really breathe on its own and it needs a CPAP machine ask me how I

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:33.000
can get its tail to curl dare you hot iron yeah involves thousands and

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000
thousands of years of a hot iron and then dangling it in a well I mean that's

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.000
dogs in general like dogs are that's the ultimate dogs are the ultimate

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000
magician or like they're they because they're they're like human kind's best

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000
friend and they're so emotionally attached to us and they're like so we're

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000
like oh my god what a bond we have with you and then you like you open the hood on

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
that you're like oh god yeah it's because every single time one of your

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000
brothers or sisters disappointed a caveman they threw him on the fire yeah

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000
and then the ones that were left were allowed to breed and it's just like now

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000
you got all these different shaped fucking things like oh this one's used to

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:18.000
clean cannons out and fucking Brunswick like it's it was bred for the

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:24.000
formity of its front arms and it's like it can't get it's it's it gets more lung

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:30.000
cancer than usual but it's true boy can it clean out a cannon it'll get those

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:36.000
ferrets right out of your best deals right right at first prize look at it

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:43.000
trot like you know they have special muscles in the inside of their brow

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000
that make them more expressive that wolves don't have wolves can only look

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000
like they're gonna eat you almost identical DNA with like dogs are just

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.000
like they just like them thing like it's like different breed of canine

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:01.000
since you have said that when I listen to you talk I try to not do that

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.000
my natural look at me like I think me I think all people when somebody's talking

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000
to you they're like you be like yeah I went and got some beer and they're like

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000
oh yeah yeah what happened but since you have said that to me I've been really

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:20.000
conscious of like yeah that wouldn't happen what you're trying to look like

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:25.000
a wolf what what are you trying to look at I told you Dan I don't I don't always

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.000
know what's gonna happen but you're conscious of your brown we've been cool

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:36.000
for like 13 years but one day I may have to bite you

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:43.000
well yeah I mean I yeah it's I'm hard-pressed to know like do I respect wolves

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000
more than dogs because wolves are like they're you know you said there's a

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000
documentary about they compare the two and then they put the put the little

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000
treat under the cup and the wolves will just like they know the treats of the

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:02.000
cup and they paw at it and they're like wolf get the cup and then the dog

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.000
will try for the cup and a can't and it stops and it looks at the nearest

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:17.000
person because it's like can I use me but I did my best yeah and it's like I

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:22.000
don't are we on the side of that or not is it the shadow we cast or is it it's

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:29.000
it's just crazy it's like it's such a it's a strange poetic relationship it

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:34.000
is it's great that like we needed something and that something kind of

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000
also needed us it's weird when you're like dog walks over to you and puts its

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000
head on you because you're like oh man we get along and we don't speak the same

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.000
language you could have left a long time ago you could have changed your mind

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:51.000
and bit my face off a long time ago and it's dope it's kind of the it's kind of

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:57.000
the coolest thing that man did or woman did for each other thousands of years

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
ago they're like in the future you're gonna need a dog when I first moved to

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.000
the new house there was this moment that I never had with Harvey where like he

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.000
it was he didn't really like he's not like this is my house and it's not he for

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:15.000
all he knows I'm just like well you know their dogs are just like I'm sure they

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000
get a sense of like sort of like oh this is my new bro this is my new den but

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.000
he just like he's like well I'm with you you're my man and I'm your dog and

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000
we're here together and I kind of like it just kind of organically happened that

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:35.000
he and I like walked the perimeter of my house together and he just like there's

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:40.000
no leash or anything it was just sort of nighttime and he he just like fell into

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:45.000
this behavior that was like and that I fell into too where I was like it just

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:50.000
felt so right it felt like lifting a hammer or a gazelle femur like it was

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:55.000
like I'm this sentient primate and I would just had this like retriever at my

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.000
hip yeah he just kept perfect pace with me and he kind of like it was as if he

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
understood that what we were doing is we were just sort of checking the perimeter

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:09.000
and he it was that there's something just swelled inside me I think it's very

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000
notable though that like you know I think I don't know what the numbers are like

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000
let's say 50,000 years of dog domestication versus the 10,000 years of cat

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:23.000
infestation and I say that very affectionately as a former cat person

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:28.000
I just like cats if you ask them are you domesticated they would say no thank you

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:34.000
very much sir I am not a domesticated animal I've chosen to live among humans

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:40.000
because it profits me and and and unlike dogs cats don't they come in some

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000
different shapes and furs and things but they're basically cats and when we go

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:52.000
into outer space we're gonna bring dogs and cats and it cats didn't kiss as

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.000
much ass as dogs did and they're still coming on the arc for sure and I think

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
that kind of interesting because also what I find interesting that humans love

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000
cats as much as they love dogs we maybe if you could quantify that that might not

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.000
be true but like we we we will bring the in the way that matters we will bring

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:16.000
cats with us to outer space if we survive and like like we love cats because

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:22.000
they're soft and they they react to us loving them and and they're and like it's

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:29.000
almost like dogs didn't have to go as far as they did it's almost like we as

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000
humans were like you know what you could have split the diff and we would have

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.000
might have respected you more you could have negged us a little bit and the

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.000
dogs are like I figured it out whatever you say boss and we're like all right

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:48.000
dial it back this guy catches mice and he purrs that's it like he could shit where

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:54.000
he want he shits in a box how's that for fucking yeah consideration yeah it's

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000
it's just it's interesting because humans are very self-loathing which is why we

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:03.000
I think we reach out we every human that every animal that we ever touched I'm sure

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.000
we tried to domesticate we come across an elephant we probably were like oh can

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000
you have one as a pet and the answers no you can't because they're smarter and

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:16.000
they have graveyards I don't know you can't you can't have an elephant as a

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000
pet you can't what if I would have this elephant I breed it with that if it's

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000
gonna be still be an elephant it's gonna be mad at you and step on you or it's

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:29.000
gonna be sad and step on a stool and cry and then die and it'll remember where

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.000
it died and every every all the other elephants will go and a scientist will

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:41.000
go they're all sad and we'll all cry not a pet not a pet you can't you know we

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:46.000
try ferrets we try lizards you know everybody needs a carney in their life

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:53.000
but it's because we hate ourselves like you know where we're not we're not

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:58.000
what other animal species is like so insecure that they're like anybody else

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:04.000
want to party that's fucking crazy like you're either eating some shit or it's

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
eating you that's the general rule in the animal king yeah there's some ants

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000
that milk some aphids I get you and there's copper bars I'm picking up

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
what you're laying down there's some there's some crocodile birds eating at

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:25.000
the teeth right I got you player that's the interspecies opening line you

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000
are you a shark I see you shark out there general michigan's going on between

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.000
a couple species oh this spider lays an egg and the egg looks like a fruit and

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.000
the fruit like it makes a pollen or whatever but you know like only us are

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:44.000
like who wants to party yeah I'm so alone yeah Wilson well we share food yeah

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:49.000
we fucking will give up food yeah that's a big fucking deal to animals but then

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:55.000
only dogs are like oh shit that's a human baby however actually oh shit this is

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:01.000
a thing I could have written down okay so damn we filled some time in my new

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:08.000
house there there is this species of bird oh very interesting like there's a

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000
couple of neighborhood cats and there's also this like weird species of bird that

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:18.000
I don't see a lot they have like very long tails they kind of look like sorry

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:29.000
what that would be cool

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:38.000
okay I love three things about that I love that you're British I love that you

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:45.000
in the place I moved there's these birds with like the peacock right and then

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:54.000
I was like sorry what you're like sorry peacock I'm sorry I just I hit the

01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:05.000
buzzer too early you probably didn't move to a zoo yeah where I used to live

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000
there is peacocks and like the hills like ranch property and I drive down

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:13.000
there just to seem like they jump up on a house to be like holy shit wait well

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:19.000
see me valley yeah and see me okay so I apologize sir that then so it's not a

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
crazy thing to be like peacock well to me it indicated he thought you moved

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.000
somewhere really rich yeah okay like a really rural like like out in the

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000
outskirts like shadow hills and there's peacocks out there yeah okay alright

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.000
sorry maybe I don't know I didn't mean to mock you I meant to mock you but I

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000
didn't have all the information I needed to mock you and shouldn't have mocked

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:41.000
you that's what I mean the delivery did deserve mockery no it was fun it was

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:46.000
funny that in my mind peacocks or like are like tigers like they only exist in

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:51.000
like a country zoo or a foreign land yeah that's my own ignorance apparently

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:56.000
like you think I'm like Aquaman or something like like oh he must have

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:02.000
moved to the sea like Xana do anyway sorry matter right no they're like

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:08.000
regular looking birds that float or fly around float float flappy flappy float

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.000
or what are they what colors are they I'm they just like they bird color but like

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:17.000
blue and purple green they just have they just they're just characterized by like

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000
they have slightly longer tail feathers than but they picture like a sparrow but

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000
then take its tail feathers and like make them like the length of an extra sparrow

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:30.000
on the end okay yeah so it's just like you said like a little baby road runner

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:35.000
like not a cartoon style but like anyways but they're all over my house and

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:42.000
they're very like they're they god damn they they so there's this neighborhood

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:49.000
cats and like if the cat comes in my yard I'm like ah cute kitty we got a

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:55.000
little neighborhood cat maybe I'll give it a bowl of milk one day it's like

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.000
unicef like maybe if they catch me at the right time I'll give them a heath

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:06.000
cliff fishbone but no sooner than I'm thinking that these fucking things

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:12.000
dive bomb this cat good the birds are those birds are everywhere all over my

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000
yard they don't fuck with humans they're constantly like fly they'll fly low

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.000
they're not like they don't I've never felt threatened by them I've been

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:27.000
impressed by their they're kind of like I don't know what you'd call it like their

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:35.000
space is very top gun like yeah like oh hello sailor like like they're you use

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:44.000
the sailor's don't play planes but if they did but Marines don't swim as much as

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:49.000
the Navy it's true so fuck you for thinking I'm hey look there's room for

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:55.000
immersion among the armed forces there could be sailors that fly you don't know

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:00.000
there are there are ships they go up in planes they're out in boats you got to

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000
be in the Navy to fly some of those planes right you're in the Air Force

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:09.000
still but you're also a sailor on the Navy thank you and fuck everyone boat

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:19.000
especially you peacock man how dare you think I had peacocks sorry down down

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:31.000
yes yes British fan anyways it's I just find that remarkable because I was

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
thinking what I'm like these fucking things okay I know they're there this

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:38.000
cat wasn't doing anything it was definitely not like looking to rumble

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:44.000
it was like sunning itself and these birds start one and then two started

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:50.000
going zoom and they were like fuck the cat was like fuck you like it was not it

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:55.000
was like leaving alone I'll move then and then the birds are like I said fuck

01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:00.000
you and the cat was like fuck man yeah and I was like why I was like holy shit

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000
I've never seen this these birds are warring on this cat like honey come look

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
at this and it was like moving from window to window is like holy shit they

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.000
won't leave this fucker alone he's like running is like at this point he is now

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:14.000
definitely the victim like if he wasn't before it was like he's just like I'm

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.000
like I'm only born a cat like I've done nothing to any of you and they were

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:25.000
just like fuck you don't like the shape of your body and and I just thought that

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
was crazy because and I was thought about it was like but they'd never fuck

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000
with me though I recognize that bird they don't do that to me I'm in the

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.000
backyard in my pool or I'm running around like they've obviously they've got

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.000
an instinct to protect their nest or their grounds 400 birds a year one cat

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:46.000
it though they spread out and they'll kill fucking four houses full like in

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000
that region you mean the cat cats are that cats are the shark of the

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:57.000
sphere and whereas humans are not and in fact to the contrary they is like this

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:03.000
species of no species of bird that lives in a city would survive if their

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000
behavior included ever fucking with a guy mowing his lawn yeah because you

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:13.000
would immediately go that there's a vampire bird open season you hear them

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:18.000
headpeckers are back again like they'd be extinct immediately are they are

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.000
they don't live to tell the tale there's no such thing as that species I just

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.000
found that kind of fascinating that key and tumblr mechanism but also did you know

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:33.000
crows are you hear that episode of that G show oh yeah about crows now you know

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000
you know you know about the the drop the nuts in the street and they've you know

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.000
we've all heard that one that old trope they drop pennies on the train tracks

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:47.000
but they like recognize faces they say about crows yeah human faces yeah I

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:51.000
bet they do that's why don't be mean to crows they'll they'll like they'll like

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:57.000
they're they're they're they're higher tech like they're it's not good enough

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:03.000
for a crow to just be either scared of humans or have an affinity toward them

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.000
I thought we were gonna die no we're good earlier about 20 minutes ago how we die

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.000
about 20 minutes ago through the crack in that curtain I saw Steve Levy just

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:22.000
standing there cracking his knuckles piano wire so maybe reach for my phone I was

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:28.000
like oh that is like a species of bird that we deem is ugly and kind of like

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000
parasitic or in what would you call it infestuous is that a word like like we

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000
don't look at we look at crows as being like they don't they don't deserve the

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:42.000
the avian title they're like varmints you know but precisely because of that

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:48.000
probably they have developed like a keener relationship with their human

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:55.000
colleagues yeah they're like it doesn't pay to be a crow and look at all humans

01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:01.000
as one thing or another it it definitely you reproduce more as a crow if you can

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:08.000
tell the difference between the little girl that brings you worms and the

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:14.000
cranky old man that has a BB gun and it's like the only the DNA past for it's

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.000
like so you have this like super intelligence among this like mangy

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:23.000
bird I fucking love crows yeah that's the thing people people love crows people

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.000
feel like crows are super smart some people don't like the crows but crows are

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:32.000
like upper middle class in the bird situation so like they're sitting pretty

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:37.000
because they can take on like a hawk like they will fuck a hawk up a group of

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.000
them but they also kind of like will eat an egg out of a sparrow's nest so like

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000
and sparrows can't really no matter how many sparrows get together they can't

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:51.000
really take on a crow so it's it's it's a it's a tense and they have funerals

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:56.000
apparently yeah if a crow is dead the other crows will gather around and they'll

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:03.000
observe the dead crow but it's not just out of like some elephant like nostalgia

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:09.000
they don't all be sad fucking idiot bleeding heart elephants oh an elephant

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.000
died I'm so sad let's have a wake the crows are apparently like gathered

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.000
around the dead crow for a practical purpose they're like appraising what

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:24.000
happened to this dead it's really more of an autopsy it's an autopsy it's a

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.000
yeah everyone that dies should have in a proper society an autopsy socialized

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.000
autopsy yeah no I thought that was interesting I don't know crows are just

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:38.000
I wish crows would be my friends does that make sense you could train a crow if

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000
you got a baby crow you know you could you could take it up off the streets

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.000
yeah they actually are I mean no one wants to be like a bird pet owner but

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.000
like crows are especially pretty bad to keep as pets apparently I mean just

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:54.000
just they're messy but they are smart like they'll be good but I just any time

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.000
I see a crow I just like I wish I could just like say to that crow like hey

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:04.000
hey man you need some like water or something I bought a frisbee and a bottle

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000
of water to keep it in my car so if I see a hot crow I could put out like a

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:16.000
bird bath of water a hot crow yeah you know you like a sexy crow wearing

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:26.000
like fishnets no but give me a be a girl take a beat but when when it gets

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.000
hot you know they kind of open their mouth and they look like they're panting

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000
or whatever and it seems really uncomfortable it's like man that sucks I

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:37.000
also went to the store to try and buy crow feed but crows don't really eat

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:42.000
feed so I don't know I guess I'm gonna get still french fries crows will love

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.000
stale french fries if you didn't really fucking anything you get dead squirrel

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.000
right awesome they kind of like I mean that's why they don't if you live in

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.000
the city and you got crows in your backyard they can't be super fucking

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:00.000
annoying oh they're out there they're there that is not a pretty they're the

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:13.000
they're the German of bird language that is that is not a a call designed to seduce

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:20.000
anyone it's defined and they do the thing that coyotes do which is one crow

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000
will make a bunch of noise to make other crows that it doesn't even know to fuck

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:30.000
your shit up but their call is a little more intricate and that's probably why

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000
it sounds a little uglier to us because it's more function over form like

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:40.000
German struppenhosen virgin awful the the I just said pantyhosen German that's

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:46.000
the only word I know it's a big internet I can say pantyhosen a lot of

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:53.000
different languages that's what you learned at the magician's house but also

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:58.000
that they they mimic other birds like they're just not famous for it the way

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:03.000
parrots are that they can they can choose to sound like other birds they just

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.000
no one pays for it just yeah exactly they're like yeah those shit gig I'm

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:12.000

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Branson Missouri right I'm not gonna fucking like play a fiddle for you and

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:22.000
fucking wear rhinestones I'm fucking I'm on the streets bitch

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000
peacock

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:30.000
now peacock I move this place because these braids are locked up peacock

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:36.000
sorry what sir I'm sorry peacock

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:43.000
I love that guy yeah yeah I love just enough booze guy is that don't peacock

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:48.000
sound like cats the peacocks go like yeah yeah kind of it's a really bad

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:59.000
sound yeah it's awful yeah brandon's recoiling can you imagine if that cat

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:07.000
fucking being chased by two things making the same noise but your peacock

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:13.000
what if two peacocks were chasing a cat and two of those long-tailed birds that

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.000
aren't peacocks were like in the neighborhood they're like yeah I don't

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:27.000
know I don't know what they sound like on fox did you know that whales brandon

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:31.000
that they might be able to communicate their feelings with their echolocation

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:37.000
that that human observers detect pods of whales with a couple of sick whales in it

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:43.000
and we suspect it's possible that the whale song in a pod of whales

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:48.000
that they're so their song so affects each other that if there's a couple of

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000
sick whales in a pod that their whole song becomes we are sick

01:31:52.000 --> 01:32:08.000
you so they sort of tease the sick whale and they really feel it too they

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:26.000
try to get rid of the sick whale I'm sick too I'm just going to go beach myself

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.000
that would be an equally valid explanation of that phenomenon we just

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.000
wouldn't know we wouldn't assume that they were like us yeah we listen to me

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:39.000
and Dan listen to this podcast on radio lab it was a contest about animal

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:44.000
intelligences is is and the slime mold one which is bullshit what they're not

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:49.000
smart they're just efficient like a robot's not smart that's kind of doubt

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:53.000
it's like like yeah like what's your I mean that's the question they asked in

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.000
the beginning like how would you measure animal intelligence would you measure

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:02.000
it if a dog like Robert Kroll which said he used the example of like a

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:07.000
snow fox being able to detect a mouse and dive down to me is not intelligence

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:12.000
like yeah well we define intelligence by like yeah that's but that kind of

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:15.000
raises that question it's like well what are we doing that's so goddamn smart

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:22.000
math cities there you go yeah but we're answers but aren't aren't we doing

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.000
those things by instinct and also which one of us can do those things like we're

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:36.000
not we're just we just those things I can do cities I love that we said it like

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:44.000
you to rejects during the apocalypse yeah well I could do math don't kill me

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:51.000
and my boy here he cities we should get extra crackers we should get access to

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:56.000
water because my boy here do city you guys are like of mice and men traveling

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:01.000
like this building should be eleven buildings high which means seven

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:06.000
buildings high plus two buildings high and then no one can question you because

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:13.000
you're like I invented math no one else has math everyone's like oh good good

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:20.000
sounds like that's what eleven is so I'm not very good at it but we're still

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:26.000
rich I guess he's the Gary Sinise that episode was weird they were like it was

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.000
a live event and so people were leading really hard into trying to perform and

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000
not like pleading their case but I found it pretty unsatisfying as a result you

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.000
know and then it was an interesting blend of that it was a fair and it's some

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:42.000
information I don't know you got it you judge an animal's intelligence by its

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.000
ability to unscrew a lid yeah see exactly what I mean it's like an octopus can

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.000
fucking get in the thing and then put it over itself like that's smart like

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:55.000
the whale lady was like oh it might be the case that whales feel feelings

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.000
because when they echo locate to communicate with each other it actually

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:03.000
hits them in the face and so it's a physical sensation that they're feeling

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:07.000
and so it's like if you're actually punched in the face by sadness rather than

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.000
just receiving sadness and I'm like that's not that's not putting yourself

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:16.000
into a cup you know that's not learning to read a book like an octopus does I

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000
mean a motherfucking chicken can beat you a tic-tac-toe that they talked about

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:25.000
that they talked about that hold on it's not not don't it's not true don't

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:33.000
sorry it's my dad stuff chickens are actually the dumbest animal in the

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:41.000
world that chicken beat me I mean that guy was kind of funny right because he

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000
brought the chickens out he was kind of subverting the whole thing well yeah

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:50.000
see to me it's like they say oh we're gonna do a contest about animal

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.000
intelligence and here's four people that are gonna do three minutes of weird

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.000
stand-up like it's like well let's talk about we could do there's probably

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:03.000
room for both but yeah I don't know anyway I think I'm just 46 and I'm like

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:09.000
now I'm like I like NPR and you're like god damn it the world's on fire and I'm

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:16.000
like calm down it's fucking on fire listen to the big band music on the NPR

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:23.000
they got Tommy Dorsey blowing bubbles they don't want to say Nazi too many

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:30.000
times in an hour they would upset me old bones yeah I think I just specifically

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.000
have a vendetta against like that radio lab style of humor I don't know

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000
something about it really greats greats me did you ever hear the radio lab

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:43.000
where they fucking like we're cruel which accidentally fucking catastrophically

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.000
triggered like this like indigenous dude who is like they like they oh that

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:53.000
pissed me off but but I was like yeah okay so there was a let's talk about there

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:57.000
was a guy who was talking about how in his village or city or whatever there

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:04.000
was this a phenomenon that he almost invested with supernatural weight to

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:09.000
it because it's like this was it like yellow detritus or yellow dust kind of

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.000
came down or something some color of dust descended and there they like thought

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:18.000
it was like it was like a myth or like it was like a secret alien not alien but

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:22.000
they're like oh it's like the government or it's like aliens or ghosts or

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:26.000
something and then he's like you know that was like America doing weird

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.000
experiments and he got like really mad right was that you're talking about yeah

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.000
but are you sure that specifically was the paradigm because I thought I

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.000
remembered it as like they were convinced it was government experiments right

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:42.000
the truth is like fungus or something yeah and so then they got really offended

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.000
at the idea and then they were like yeah we've struggled so hard and it's been so

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.000
hard and you just don't understand that but it's like no you don't understand

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:54.000
you just the government sucks and also this was just moss like I'm sorry the

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:58.000
government still sucks I'm not saying they're great yeah no it was just great

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000
I was it was crazy to listen to it was basically what he was saying was our

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.000
people have suffered from this this incredible dust that the United States

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.000
put on us and these guys were like debunkers who were like hey that was just

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:15.000
pollen yeah it was sort of like your people have been the victim of like

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:20.000
exploitation or whatever development or whatever but this yellow shit that comes

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:25.000
down is actually just a natural thing and the it was like it was act it was it

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.000
was it was magnified by the fact that there was like a young woman that was

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:32.000
translating for like this elder was like just speaking in his native language and

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:36.000
she was translating for him and it was just it was crazy to hear like it was

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000
like it was really I mean it was one of those things were like I was really

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:45.000
glad I heard it because it was so like it was like part train wreck but there

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.000
was something healthy about it I don't know it was like because it was it was

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.000
NPR guys that were just like oh by the way we do a science show at NPR and

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:59.000
there's just shit falling down and then the guys like you know like I don't want

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:05.000
to do an impression of fucking indigenous language I don't know I don't know

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:08.000
he's like he's speaking indigenous language and she's translating and it's

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:14.000
like but you can hear his timber changing and then she's translating and she's

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:19.000
going like but you don't understand the thing is it's this and then Kroll which

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:26.000
is like yeah but it was just like the fungus and then he's like his

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:30.000
excitation level starts going up so you can't understand what he's saying but

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:35.000
she's matching his level and she's translating for him in real time and

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:40.000
she's in tears yeah she starts going like but but you don't understand like

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:47.000
like how can you do this to us how can you after everything you've done and

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:51.000
then you bring us in here and the whole time you hear him underneath saying

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.000
things you don't understand and but that's mounting and mounting and he's

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.000
he's the baseline and she's the treble and they're both going up and up and

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.000
up and Robert Kroll which doesn't strike me as a guy who's ever been in the

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:10.000
business of confrontation and so he's just like whoops and and then Jad

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Obenrod's like well maybe there's a way to it was fucking but like deep

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000
respect that they aired it that they fucking that they that they family go

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:26.000
like here's a crazy fucking thing we got into yeah where which is like well we

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:31.000
didn't mean to offend but it was like no heroes no villains just like a crazy

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:36.000
four-way intersection of culture humanity like like like I don't know it

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:40.000
was it was it was I mean one thing's for sure you get hypnotized driving to

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:43.000
work you're listening to Radio Lab and then all of a sudden some shit like that

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.000
goes down and you're like whoa god damn do I need to pull my car over should I

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:53.000
call in late to work like do I need to drive over to MPR do they need help

01:40:53.000 --> 01:41:00.000
it was a driveway moment and I do respect that cuz I like I did Whiting

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Wong's with Jessica like you know we would do there was more than a couple

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.000
times when it was like shit would hit the fan and like I would sound like a

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.000
fucking pompous ass and like I you know we'd step out of the booth and go like

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:15.000
poof that was visceral and then you go like the engineer be like you want me

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:21.000
to edit anything out like no cuz you can't like don't yeah like like like

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.000
like let's what are we doing this for then that would be fucking dumb like

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:30.000
like like okay so I threw a tantrum and like like air it you know like gotta do

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:34.000
it gotta do it put it in the shadow box otherwise otherwise you can't pay

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:39.000
yourself to like fucking talking to a microphone I yeah so I do respect it

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000
that they're like they got caught in that fucking sand trap and they were

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:47.000
like oof this is uncomfortable this isn't it's also faster if you double down

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.000
in a way that's like oh man I was also shocked by the things that came out of

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:56.000
my mouth versus this like what we do is we kind of run and I think now if you

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:02.000
can get there faster than your critics and go shit I was trying I said some

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:08.000
shit I fucked up and you would have too if you've been talking for 48 minutes

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.000
straight cuz we all would like I think after we all got about 15 minutes with

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:19.000
an arm in us which is in in like 30 minutes you start being like yeah my

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:23.000
dad was just you know we just drank too much I don't know anyway I'm glad we're

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:29.000
here let's cut the cake but it just bring me back and I think I get that I

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:33.000
talked with Duncan babbling endlessly about but it was like it had to do with

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:38.000
that free will thing because it's like it is weird how our culture and by our

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:43.000
culture I genuinely mean like I think basically the entire human species

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:48.000
culture like we seem to have it in for ourselves and that we do not want to

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:54.000
reward the changing of the mind we have an inherent suspicion and probably for

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.000
a pretty good reason because there's this thing called sociopaths that that

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:02.000
like if there's absolutely if you hold nothing sacred and you can just feel

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:07.000
however express whatever you need to express to get through whatever gates

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:10.000
you need to get through your genuine danger to the rest of society we are

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:15.000
held in place by the fact that hey I choose not to be a criminal today it's

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000
not because there's a cop watching me every second it's right it's like I

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.000
there I might not encounter a cop the entire day and still obey the law why

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:29.000
because I have decided that I am a law abiding citizen how do you do that

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:43.000
oh Brandon now a man don't move to the but it's it is it is weird how much we

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:51.000
punish the changing of the mind that we're like oh I don't trust you now

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:56.000
because you said you felt a different way yesterday yeah and the weird thing about

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:04.000
that is that we are all you have outside of the changing the changing is the

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:10.000
only thing like whether we say free will is an illusion or not it's still

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:14.000
arguably that that's all there is to who you really are everything else is

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.000
shit outside your control even within a model where you have no control over

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.000
your choices like this real stat over here is still arguably the only thing

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:27.000
attention yeah yeah this moved today to yesterday like all this other shit is

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.000
like well this guy woke up on Monday and he said I'm proud to be white and he

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.000
spent 70 years saying that it's like well that's obviously worth nothing

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:41.000
because it never changed and so like and we but we punish the change it we

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:46.000
we kind of like we regard it we want it to happen a little bit but we don't want

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:52.000
David Bowie did enough but don't do it too much because you don't want to be a

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Kardashian don't be empty don't don't reveal yourself to be virtue signal

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.000
which means that you only you just do whatever you go where the wind blows

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.000
and like we just have all these opinions about when you're allowed to change

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:10.000
your mind and what what what what basis you're using to change how you think

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:15.000
and yet that's all you possibly could be in throughout your life is like how you

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:24.000
change I want my money back from being a human I mean I wish I could be a raccoon

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:29.000
made raccoons don't they there there's no raccoons out there rumbling each other

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:34.000
like hey man you you ate a different kind of garbage yesterday but they do sniff

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:39.000
each other's butt for that reason so there is there is some evolutionary shit

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.000
to change you told me all about the butt sniffing yeah with the dogs I know he's

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:49.000
got a whole thing about the butt sniffing it's a it's a go off king it's a

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:54.000
go go go is that a thing or did you most hilarious oh I invented that I'm a

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:59.000
genius go off no no that's a thing that's the counter to yes queen that's

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:04.000
more to yes queen's pepper fucking what I want to hear about this I want to hear

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:14.000
about the uncle or the dog butts spill the spill the power aid no what's this

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:20.000
about dogs spit that gospel priest that they use it to figure out what the other

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.000
dog has been eating where it's been going what it's been fucking around with

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:29.000
that they sort of use it like a like it's a cheap GPS because your but hole

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:34.000
holds all the information about where you've been the poop it's their wallet

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.000
it's there it's the it's the shoes they're wearing it's like a dog a dog from

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.000
uptown is gonna have a totally different asshole yeah than a dog from downtown

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.000
and a dog from uptown is like god damn you got a high protein diet right and

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.000
like wool wolves are like oh shit there's a lot of protein in your asshole

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:55.000
you're not you're not eating a bunch of grass you're not a sick wolf you've been

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:02.000
downing a lot of mammoth or pigs or I'm gonna roll with you because you've got

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:06.000
protein dispute like like people who hunt with you end up with protein yeah

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:10.000
yeah that's a tough skill and you thought that was a little disappointing

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:15.000
because you're like their capitalists you know they're that they're that they're

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:19.000
not you know that they're but I thought it was a little actually uplifting I

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:22.000
want to go back to the choice thing though because it's super interesting is

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:27.000
that you can buy certain cars you can buy eight colors but on high-end cars you

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:33.000
can get 40 colors right so I think I think choice is a huge thing that gets

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:39.000
used against us and that the execution of choice is offensive to people that

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:44.000
they're like who do you think you are to make that choice it's really what we're

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.000
all fighting to do is get to a position where we can choose every hour of the

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.000
day but there's a big scam going on right like like the man is laughing all

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:58.000
the way to the bank yeah if poor people and and like like the less we change

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.000
our minds well they like to keep you in a box so you can't right right because

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:06.000
because who wants a bunch of poor people like waking up every day and checking

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:10.000
taking inventory and going like how do I feel I don't know I'm gonna make a new

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:14.000
decision today is it taco Tuesday no fuck you it's not even Tuesday oh shit I

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:21.000
whoo yeah like and so there's a and I don't mean like America Area 51 Washington

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:30.000
I like in general society and by the way we live in one what society the like

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:36.000
that is the scam that's the big con is like don't fucking tell me you feel

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:41.000
differently today don't come at me talking about like you were do you felt

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:47.000
one way today and you felt that's women talk like we feminized that we say oh

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:51.000
women are intuitive they were mercurial like we and we tell them at the same

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:56.000
time you're weak that's why you can't be in charge of shit because you'll change

01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.000
your mind too much we're gonna go shopping it takes forever

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:05.000
goes into a story just something off the shelf I'm on to the shame you the man

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:10.000

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:31.000
so I mean have you seen these videos of Billy Joel just like losing it and

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:36.000
like throwing shit and kicking stuff was that in his earlier day or no no

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.000
on stage like he has these on he's had these on stage tantrums where you're

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:44.000
like what so you've seen him does he I think he like puts his foot through

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.000
someone's drum and yeah he got really mad at like a sound check and was like

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:52.000
fuck this but he was on stage well but if somebody brings a drum to a concert

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:58.000
he knows his band oh and I think I would be like if somebody had a microphone

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:04.000

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:09.000

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:23.000
of boom boom boom boom crap tonight boom boom boom boom spin doctors are like

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:30.400
Chicago we're famous for our camaraderie but buddy come on when you

01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:39.000

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:43.200
you're kind of like boom boom boom yeah next time I go to a concert I'm gonna

01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:45.240
get the first row and bring a harmonica

01:53:45.300 --> 01:53:52.940
I don't give a fuck who's on stage like oh look it's Tyres Gibson

01:53:52.940 --> 01:54:06.280
from the fast and the furious movies, so we all have YouTube to we can you YouTube

01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:10.280
Billy Joel. Oh yeah, please do. I mean I wish we could just put it up on the

01:54:10.280 --> 01:54:14.520
screen. He throws his piano doesn't he throws a keyboard. I just I can't think

01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:19.400
of what the actual move is, but to me it was like just just incredibly violent

01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:23.500
like you didn't hit someone, but like everything he was doing to me just just

01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:29.680
smack to violence and I was like wow yeah yeah. It punched a violence.

01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:39.680
Let there be no mistaking where we're going. Yeah, it was like to violence.

01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:44.380
The one thing that sticks in my head about Billy Joel is that it supposedly

01:54:44.380 --> 01:54:48.260
maybe it's apocryphal. I don't know, but supposedly he's the one guy that never

01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:55.460
gave Weird Al permission to parody him or like boo at the tracks like Weird Al

01:54:55.460 --> 01:55:00.900
did that science all Billy Joel to me and then Billy Joel was like historically

01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:06.940
it was like thumbs down. I don't like it. Whereas Madonna's like yeah like a

01:55:06.940 --> 01:55:12.900
surgeon. I mean I think like a virgin's a little edgier, but I'm not sure what

01:55:12.900 --> 01:55:18.360
you're parodying at this point. You're kind of taking the edge off of my work.

01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:25.440
Seems non satirical like a surgeon. So Billy Joel come on man. You're ripe for

01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:29.940
it. You're ripe for ridicule, but he didn't want it. He did. I don't I don't

01:55:29.980 --> 01:55:36.860
cotton to that. Don't weird. You weirdify me. I'm not weird. So you're weird

01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:43.460
made that made that weird. I'll bootleg all Billy Joel. Don't you try to make

01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:48.820
my songs any weirder. I'm gonna put some grease in a cracker. Jack can put a

01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:54.980
student baker on my shoe. We should just do the lamest version. Just change up

01:55:54.980 --> 01:55:58.460
down to downtown just to piss him off. Girl.

01:55:58.460 --> 01:56:05.460
You've been puttin' on a cracker jack world. Got a guitar and a six string

01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:14.220
hair. I got the palm eat on the back street stare. I've got care bears. And

01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:24.900
when she comes with my grease I got cats and dogs. And when she sneezes I

01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:34.020
collect her snot on a Lincoln lock. She'll see I'm not so tough. Just a box

01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:38.660
of snuff. I'm a dandruff and a top top gun.

01:56:41.820 --> 01:56:43.540
Top gun made it in. I like that.

01:56:45.380 --> 01:56:50.460
We're gonna end the show. The audience is like, okay, we'll clap for it. I got

01:56:50.460 --> 01:56:57.180
work. I got work. I get so good. It's the end the show. You got. All right.

01:56:57.180 --> 01:57:00.300
Everybody thanks the Brandon Johnson the Comptroller for tonight.

01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:05.940
