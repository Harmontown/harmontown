{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:08.000\nWelcome to Hollywood, California, everybody.\n\n00:08.000 --> 00:11.000\nHarmontown is now in session.\n\n00:16.000 --> 00:20.000\nThe meltdown show is gone, but Harmontown persists.\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:34.000\nLet's bring out Spencer Crittenden then everybody.\n\n00:34.000 --> 00:41.000\nAnd the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:41.000 --> 00:47.000\nThank you. Thank you very much.\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:53.000\nOkay, you know, there's warm-up and then there's show-stealing.\n\n00:53.000 --> 00:57.000\nYou know, you might want to just cool it down a little bit.\n\n00:57.000 --> 00:59.000\nWhat are you afraid of, Dan?\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:02.000\nAre you afraid that I will overshadow you with my pre-show antics?\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:06.000\nYeah, because they involve, like, exercise and stuff.\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:07.000\nWhat am I supposed to do?\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:10.000\nThat's why I do it pre-shows that you don't have to get in a lather.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:18.000\nWell, yeah, but then it's like job of the hut following Luke Skywalker.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:20.000\nDid you see me chop that cigarette in half with a whip?\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:25.000\nYeah, you used the force. I'm so proud of you.\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:33.000\nYou should have your own trilogy of movies, and I should just be a big fat thing at the beginning of the worst one.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:35.000\nWe get it.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:39.000\nAre you going to freeze me in carbonite? Just to be a dick?\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:49.000\nAnd to create 40 years of awkward soaps and chocolates.\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:51.000\nWait, there's Han Solo frozen chocolates?\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:54.000\nOh, yeah, man. I shouldn't say awkward because I love them.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:59.000\nI have carbonite Han Solo ice trays.\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:05.000\nLike little rubber things that you can put. You can have Han Solo frozen and carbonite ice in your drink.\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:10.000\nThey melt so fast because of his little fingers.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:15.000\nIt's not ideal, but there's soaps and chocolates and stuff.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:20.000\nYeah, soap's the way to go because you can just leave it out in ornamental Han Solo soap.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:23.000\nHan Sopo.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:37.000\nYou guys heard the name Katie May, the unfortunate model actor, and they just found out that she died mysteriously, but they traced it to...\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:45.000\nShe went to the chiropractor. This is just my fucking... I'm not to make her tragedy about me, but I was like...\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:48.000\nBut if you did, it would go a little something.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:56.000\nShe went to the chiropractor and he just like adjusted her to the point where then she went home and just without realizing it kind of slowly died.\n\n02:56.000 --> 03:00.000\nIt pinched something that she must have just...\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:06.000\nAnd it was like, it sounds like an urban legend, but she just like went home and was like just laying there and must have been...\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:11.000\nI mean, we don't know what happened in her final hours, but the cause of death was...\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:14.000\nI've never gone to the chiropractor again.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:20.000\nMy girlfriend has like stiff neck issues and she always asks me to crack her back. Am I going to kill her one day by doing it?\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:22.000\nI mean, I'm still...\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:29.000\nOkay. So just another thing to worry about. Just keep playing video games and just like...\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:33.000\nLet's convince her that it's really dangerous so I never have to do it again.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:42.000\nSpeaking of safety, now this is the reason why in the months ahead I'm struggling very hard to create a Graham Norton feedback loop.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:45.000\nI want the show to evolve to the point where you people...\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:50.000\nWhat do you mean you people?\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:53.000\nYou white people can...\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:55.000\nIs what I usually mean.\n\n03:55.000 --> 04:00.000\nCan see what the people on the stream are seeing so that you know...\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:03.000\nI'm not saying the goal is to become a real TV show for God's sake.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:05.000\nI mean, no, that'd be terrible.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:12.000\nBut I'm just saying you'll have a lot more fun because I can show you this Instagram of this lady.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:17.000\nMaybe you've seen it. This is a beautiful woman. A beautiful specimen of humanity.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:22.000\nI don't mean physics. Well, now what am I doing saying she's ugly?\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:24.000\nNot my first choice.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:29.000\nI'm using beautiful in a spiritual way.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:38.000\nI'm saying this is amazing. Somebody took on a plane of a woman at Kelly Oxford re-Instagram.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:42.000\nI don't know where this source is from, but it's this woman and she's sitting on an airplane.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:48.000\nShe's got the neck pillow so her head's propped up. She's sound asleep and clipped to the neck pillow.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:51.000\nIt looks like a neck brace. It's almost like she has whiplash.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:55.000\nIt's like one of those pillows. It's just holding her head perfectly still.\n\n04:55.000 --> 05:08.000\nClipped to the neck pillow is a laminated card, like a pristine type of graphically graceful.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:14.000\nIt's like the letting is perfect, like the kerning everything.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:19.000\nAnd it's laminated and it has a little clip on it. It clips right to her neck pillow.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:25.000\nAnd I don't want to make sure I get it right because she's a woman of exactitude who is...\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:28.000\nFuck, fuck, fuck, where is it? Where is it? Oh, here it is.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:33.000\nIt says, please wake me for snacks and drinks. Thank you.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:49.000\nIt was amazing to me because the caption that sums up your visceral reaction immediately is from the...\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:54.000\nThere was some person responded immediately with like, this bitch is my hero.\n\n05:54.000 --> 06:04.000\nWhich kind of sums up the dichotomy because it's kind of like you're jolted by her having demands and entitlement and all this stuff.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:06.000\nBut she's managing all of it.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:10.000\nBut that says so many things. She travels a lot first off.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:15.000\nAnd she also likes to get her little disease on the plane.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:18.000\nBut also, don't call her late for dinner.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:26.000\nIt's kind of amazing because you're so used to the dichotomy being, oh, there's people who are Zen who are in the moment.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:30.000\nAnd those are the good people and there's the uptight, schedule-based people and those are the bad people.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:35.000\nBut no, nothing's ever that simple. This is a person who clearly...\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:39.000\nShe plans her shit out. She has foresight.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:42.000\nBut she's also at the same time kind of a life master.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:46.000\nThere's a lot of Zen people who are so fucking irritated.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:51.000\nBecause they just use Zen as an excuse to be flaky and fuck up your day, right?\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:53.000\nI bet she's a really considerate house guest.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:56.000\nThere's probably a really good chance that she's not...\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:59.000\nShe would leave you a note and probably give you a nice little gift when she left you twice.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:02.000\nYeah, she probably does her own dishes and all that shit.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:07.000\nIt's just something about that because it's not like a shitty marker thing.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:16.000\nAnd also, she's like, again, please, comma, wake me for snacks, ampersand drinks. She's an ampersand exclamation point.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:18.000\nThank you, exclamation point.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:21.000\nI like that you started off by saying letting and kerning, by the way.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:22.000\nThat shows off your...\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:24.000\nBut it's just like she used it. It's not...\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:27.000\nIt's center-justified.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:31.000\nIt's not left-justified, but it's also not like shitty, like fucking like...\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:33.000\nCan I see the photo?\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:37.000\nI don't know that I have it. I don't have it off hand. I just like...\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:38.000\nI'll check it down.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:43.000\nBut like six months from now, I'll go zap, and it'll be on the thing, and America will be like,\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:47.000\nyay, and then she'll be like, you owe me money, and then we'll...\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:51.000\nAnd then CBS will be like, we'd like to buy you, and then we'll be like, yay,\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:55.000\nand they'll be like, but she can't say anything bad about Jim Belushi.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:59.000\nWhat could you possibly say bad about Jim Belushi,\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:05.000\nexcept for the fact that he pissed on the olive jar at the craft service in front of his costars?\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:10.000\nI overheard a guy at dinner tonight who was...\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:13.000\nI don't know if I can do this justice, but it was like...\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:18.000\nThere was a couple over at the other dinner table that we were eavesdropping on,\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:23.000\nand the guy was going like, he goes like, no, it's extreme pilates.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nYou know, I've been doing Wonder Bar...\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:29.000\nShe goes like, no, you know, I've been doing Wonder Bar for about three years,\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:32.000\nand he goes like, well, yeah, but no, you've been doing this other thing,\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:36.000\nand he was correcting her, and he's like, honey, I mean, no.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:40.000\nI'm telling you what you were doing was sitting upright in bed doing these things,\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:43.000\nand he's explaining to her, and then he goes like, I mean, now it's hard...\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:47.000\nI'm telling you, now, they have one down the street, and I mean, now it's hard court.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:51.000\nNow it's a legitimate workout. I mean, before it was gay.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:57.000\nAnd then there was a pause, and then I heard him very quietly go like, I shouldn't say gay.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:03.000\nAnd I was like, well, either you should, either you're fine.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:09.000\nI don't think anyone was going to come over to the table and go, excuse me, that's really offensive.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:14.000\nYou know what I mean? Because you sound super gay.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:24.000\nAnd it made me think, like, is that when gay people...\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:29.000\nGo on, Dan.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:31.000\nI forgot what they were.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:33.000\nYou're doing great. You're doing great.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:38.000\nHumans, when gay folk...\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:43.000\nThat pause was me trying to, like, do I want to get specific gay men?\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:51.000\nWhen gay people, do they, in conversations with loved ones and or each other,\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:57.000\ndo they police each other on the use of gay to be a derogate, to be, like, kind of, like, using it?\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:59.000\nYou know, I don't know.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:04.000\nAnd also, like, this guy, I also took that to mean, I was like, oh, this guy, he's straight.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:08.000\nBut, like, boys, he's got a...\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:12.000\nHe's worrying about something he does not have to worry about.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:16.000\nBecause he's, like, ostensibly the reason you're, like, backpedaling on that is, like, oh, I shouldn't say gay.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:20.000\nLike, the unspoken part of that is, I shouldn't say that because someone...\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:21.000\nIt's the wrong idea.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:24.000\nSomeone walking around here might get offended.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:27.000\nThey might, like, and it's like, no one's going to get offended.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:30.000\nYou sound gayer than the Statue of Liberty.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:31.000\nOkay.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nLike, everyone would just be like...\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:38.000\nOne of the most famous gay icons.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:45.000\nLike, Nathan Lane could be walking his seven Chihuahuas by and overhear you and he'd say,\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:46.000\nway to take it back.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:48.000\nYou know, that's how it's done.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:51.000\nLike, you have nothing to worry about, sir.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:56.000\nMan, eating the arugula salad at little Dom's.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:59.000\nDid you just out the Statue of Liberty?\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:00.000\nCome on.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:01.000\nShe's looking at her.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:02.000\nCome on.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:05.000\nShe's always hanging out with the Staten Island fairy.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:12.000\nHello, hello, hello, joke from 1983.\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:13.000\nShe's French.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nShe's carrying a book.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:17.000\nYeah.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:21.000\nShe's holding a torch for some fucking lady.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:22.000\nYeah.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:23.000\nFor some chick.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:24.000\nAll right.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:27.000\nSo I think that's enough.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:31.000\nThat's enough of my business.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:35.000\nOur guest tonight is another podcasting hero.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:40.000\nThe reason I'm familiar with this podcast, I just became familiar with it is because\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:47.000\nmy girlfriend Cody, her mom, Randy, mama LaRusso from Karate Kid.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:53.000\nHis girlfriend's mom is the mom from Karate Kid.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:57.000\nThat's never going to stop being the coolest fucking thing I've ever heard of.\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:00.000\nShe also played Rizzo on Broadway in Grease.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:01.000\nYeah.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:02.000\nShe's a fucking...\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:04.000\nBut she'll always be mama LaRusso to me.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:06.000\nBut a lot of people actually...\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nShe was on Mad Men as the...\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:11.000\nI can't remember the character's name, but she was just...\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:12.000\nWhatever.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:13.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:14.000\nIt's not about her.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:16.000\nYou haven't even said hi to Spencer.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:19.000\nYou're going to bring in a guest and you haven't even addressed Spencer over.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:20.000\nYeah.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:21.000\nDon't...\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:24.000\nYou know the tradition of addressing Spencer before you bring out the guest.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:25.000\nYeah.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:26.000\nIt's bad luck.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:27.000\nIt's a severe...\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:28.000\nSpencer, how are you?\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:30.000\nOh, I'm so good, you guys.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:33.000\nI know he's just using this as a time to pour himself a drink.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:34.000\nOh, man.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:35.000\nWow.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:37.000\nNimble is a mountain goat.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:38.000\nOh.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:41.000\nIt's in the way that she uses.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:42.000\nHey.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:43.000\nOh.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:44.000\nWoo.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:45.000\nWoo.\n\n12:45.000 --> 13:04.000\nDude.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nThat's a real weapon.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:07.000\nYeah, those...\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:08.000\nOh.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:09.000\nWhat is happening?\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:11.000\nPeople are wielding things.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:19.000\nIt looks like a...\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:22.000\nWhat are we looking at precisely here?\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:25.000\nThat is horrifying.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:27.000\nExactly.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:32.000\nEli Roth is here tonight with a prop from his next movie.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:34.000\nDo you want to try it?\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:35.000\nNo.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:36.000\nNo.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:37.000\nCome on.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:38.000\nLet's not devolve.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:39.000\nNo.\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:41.000\nWhat is this?\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nLet's just keep it.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:47.000\nThis is my scepter.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:48.000\nIt's a weird...\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:50.000\nWhat is it made of?\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:51.000\nIt looks like it's wax.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:52.000\nIs this wax?\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:53.000\nIt's a...\n\n13:53.000 --> 14:01.000\nIt's an elm stick from Sedona covered in wax from my house.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:03.000\nWould you like to come up here?\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:04.000\nYes.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:05.000\nOne second.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:22.000\nI've got scepter questions.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:27.000\nWhat in the Joshua Tree is going down?\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:28.000\nThis is...\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:30.000\nThe audience is in an uproar right now.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:36.000\nFor the listener who's not live streaming this one, you're wearing...\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:39.000\nIs it like a bathrobe?\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:40.000\nWhat do you have on it?\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:43.000\nI prefer to call it my prophetic mantle.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:44.000\nProphetic mantle?\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:45.000\nYes.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:47.000\nThat's what I prefer to call it from now on.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:48.000\nI love that.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:50.000\nDo you have a smart satchel with you?\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:51.000\nKind of a tote?\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:56.000\nA bit of a Masonic apron bag.\n\n14:56.000 --> 15:00.000\nAnd you have Mork and Mindy headband on?\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:01.000\nThat's right.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:04.000\nIt says gay in the back.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:10.000\nIt says gay in the back, but business is in front.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:12.000\nIt's an election thing.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:14.000\nI'm with her.\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:21.000\nGay in the back, voting lever in the front.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:22.000\nWhat's your name?\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:23.000\nJoey.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:24.000\nJoey.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:25.000\nAnd you're from...\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:26.000\nSovo.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:28.000\nWait, is this...\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:29.000\nProvo, Utah.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:30.000\nProvo, Utah.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:31.000\nYep.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:34.000\nAre you just visiting California?\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:35.000\nYes.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:42.000\nI have my brother and his partner, spouse, and yeah, we're visiting.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:43.000\nOkay.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:44.000\nWell, you guys all came together.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:45.000\nYou're not visiting them.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:46.000\nThat's right.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:47.000\nFrom Utah.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:49.000\nWhat are you doing, what else are you doing?\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:54.000\nIn Utah, I promote myself as the reincarnation of Joseph Smith.\n\n15:54.000 --> 16:03.000\nWhich has a built-in audience there.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:05.000\nAnd you just do what you...\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nWait, but that didn't answer my...\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:08.000\nNo.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.000\nIs that what you're doing here?\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:11.000\nAre you kind of on a pilgrimage?\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:12.000\nA mission?\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:13.000\nRight.\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:19.000\nWell, so I was here on the 200th episode recording of your podcast, and it was amazing.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:20.000\nAnd I don't know...\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:21.000\nThank you.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:27.000\nIt was after the show, so I don't know if you remember, but I actually gave you a hat that\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:31.000\nmy brother and his spouse and I actually stenciled the name...\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:32.000\nErnest Hemingway.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:33.000\nThat's right.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:34.000\nI have that in my closet.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:35.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:39.000\nAnd I regularly look at it and go, what the fuck is that?\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:40.000\nYes.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:41.000\nI was just...\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:42.000\nCody just...\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:44.000\nAnd I were just looking at that.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:45.000\nAnd she said, it's cool.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:48.000\nShe was about to wear it, and I was like, don't wear that.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:49.000\nWhat is that?\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:50.000\nNo.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nThere's another hat for her.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:53.000\nYeah.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:56.000\nBut I also gave one to Spencer, and it said...\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:57.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n16:57.000 --> 17:01.000\nWaldo Pierce, and then you got one that said Ezra Pound.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:02.000\nYes.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:03.000\nYes.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:04.000\nSo I just...\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:05.000\nYou had been talking...\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:08.000\nHow did we all forget you?\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:11.000\nMost only in Los Angeles.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nPacific prison in the world.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:16.000\nGotta work harder than this, folks.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:17.000\nGood luck.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:18.000\nI'll do what I can.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:24.000\nI've run into so many guys wearing daycoats that pretend to be Mormon's prophets.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:29.000\nWell, the truth is, he does kind of blend around here, and that's a good thing, not a bad thing.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:30.000\nYeah.\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:32.000\nBad thing for your publicist, good thing for society.\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:33.000\nYeah.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:36.000\nIt definitely stands out in Provo, not so much in LA.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:39.000\nWhat do you got in your Masonic satchel there?\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:40.000\nWhat do you have there?\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:43.000\nWell, this is a medic droid for my nephew.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:44.000\nOkay.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:45.000\nIs that what, IG-88?\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:46.000\nWhat is it?\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:48.000\nWhat do you say, medic droid?\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:49.000\nThat's the only one I remember.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:50.000\nI don't remember.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:51.000\nOh, yeah, that's some new crap.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:52.000\nHe's like a no-face.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:53.000\nAnd...\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:57.000\nI mean, I want to see some shamanic shit in there.\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:00.000\nI want to see, like, you have some sort of rune stones or something.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:01.000\nWhat the...\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:02.000\nOh.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:03.000\nOh, shit.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:04.000\nOkay.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:05.000\nPut that away.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:06.000\nPut that away.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:07.000\nYeah.\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:08.000\nAll right.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:11.000\nWell, we also have our guest that I was...\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:18.000\nWho must have the guest equivalent of Blue Balls right now.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:19.000\nWe can handle...\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nI think Joey can...\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:22.000\nYou want to linger for a bit, Joey?\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:23.000\nSure.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:24.000\nYeah, just...\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:25.000\nI like your style, man.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:26.000\nI like your style, man.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:29.000\nJoey, you remind me of early Harmontown days when we would...\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:33.000\nWe kept just discovering, like, Levi's and...\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:34.000\nRight.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:37.000\nAnd people, like, we had BJ Avril.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:40.000\nWe had these great cast of gréviness.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:41.000\nWell, I'm a...\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:44.000\nI'm a Facebook friend of Earthshine Jane.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:47.000\nI'm drinking out of her glass right now.\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:48.000\nThere you go.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:49.000\nYeah.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:53.000\nAnd we're going to be interviewing her on our own podcast, The Pulpit, in a few days\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:54.000\nwhen she visits Utah.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:55.000\nAll right.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:56.000\nNow, when you say that you're...\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:57.000\nThat you...\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:59.000\nYou bill yourself as the reincarnation of Joseph Smith.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:00.000\nIs that for real?\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:03.000\nLike, you actually go around, like, spread in the good word of the letter?\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:04.000\nThat's very real.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:05.000\nYes.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:06.000\nYeah.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:07.000\nWell, so...\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:10.000\nAnd not to...\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:14.000\nNot to frustrate your distinguished guests any longer, but...\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.000\nHe is extinguished at this point.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:19.000\nThat's the problem now.\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:24.000\nBut I do circulate the past lives of certain individuals.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:34.000\nSo, you three individuals were friends during the lifetime of Waldo Pierce as a pound Ernest Hemingway.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:41.000\nAnd we're part of that lost generation that kind of, you know, went to France and had some fun.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:43.000\nAnd you killed yourself.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:44.000\nSo...\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:45.000\nSpoilers!\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:50.000\nThat was after...\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:55.000\nAnd you had wanted to know a lot about the simulation during the 200th episode.\n\n19:55.000 --> 20:04.000\nSo, that's why I went to kind of let you know how the data conservation works in this simulation.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nWhere we just recycle your...\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:07.000\nOh, it's using...\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:08.000\nYeah, that would make sense.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:13.000\nLike, in video games, it's like, oh, that's clearly that other character with a hat.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:16.000\nThat's right.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:18.000\nIt's like, yeah, that makes sense.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:20.000\nOf course.\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:21.000\nAll right.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:23.000\nJoey, how many times have you been to Harmontown?\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:24.000\nJust twice now?\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:25.000\nThis is the second.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:27.000\nThe first time was he...\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:31.000\nHe gave us warnings we did not heed.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:34.000\nBut now he's back to wonder why...\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:38.000\nNow he has a fantastical rainbow schlong stick, which is really good.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:42.000\nI'm pretty sure if you drop this, it turns into a snake, right?\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:46.000\nA waxy, a waxy, creepy snake.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:50.000\nJust to be clear, you said, you said this is a stick from your home...\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:51.000\nFrom your home?\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:53.000\nNo, not from your home.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:54.000\nIt's a doma.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:55.000\nIt's a doma.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:56.000\nArizona.\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:57.000\nArizona.\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:58.000\nDon't forget Sedona.\n\n20:58.000 --> 20:59.000\nLand of Sticks.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:00.000\nNo, don't forget Winona.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:02.000\nAnd wax from your house.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:03.000\nThat's right.\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:04.000\nAll right.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:05.000\nWait.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:08.000\nSo you have your own wax supply at home?\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:09.000\nI do.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:11.000\nAll right.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:16.000\nWell, so anyways, so this amazing podcast that we started listening to, to help put us to sleep,\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:21.000\nthe conceit of the podcast is a sincere attempt to put you to sleep.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:23.000\nIt's for insomniacs.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:28.000\nIt claims on the surface, but it's endlessly entertaining as well.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:29.000\nThere's no wrong way to use it.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:30.000\nHe goes into all that stuff.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:33.000\nIt's very, very smart, amazing guy.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:38.000\nPlease listen to his podcast, Sleep With Me, if you haven't already after this.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:55.000\nBut let's get to know our new friend, Drew Ackerman.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:56.000\nYeah.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:57.000\nOkay.\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:58.000\nThat's nice.\n\n21:58.000 --> 21:59.000\nAll right.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:00.000\nGood move.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:01.000\nHello, Drew.\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:02.000\nDrew, meet Joey.\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:03.000\nHi.\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:04.000\nHey, what's up?\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:05.000\nDo you have any past life info on me?\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:06.000\nDo I want to know?\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:07.000\nTarot cards.\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:08.000\nI'll work on that.\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:09.000\nOkay, great.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:10.000\nOh, shit.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:12.000\nWait, I said you have shamanic shit.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:16.000\nYou're hiding tarot cards in your satchel?\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:18.000\nAre you going to do a reading right now?\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:22.000\nWell, no, I'll just be doing it.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:28.000\nYeah, do a little background tarot on this and whenever you feel like something significant pops up.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:30.000\nThat's right.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:31.000\nOkay.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:32.000\nAll right.\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:33.000\nRight there on the floor.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:34.000\nAll right.\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:35.000\nFine.\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:40.000\nCan you let me know when, you know, wait, you already did let me know?\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:41.000\nDoes that mean she's here?\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:42.000\nYeah, she's here.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:43.000\nOh, she's here.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:44.000\nOkay.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:45.000\nWell, she's on the schedule too.\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:46.000\nLet's hear from Drew.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:47.000\nThanks for coming, Drew.\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:48.000\nThank you.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:49.000\nWould you mind terribly?\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:55.000\nI'll do this Halloween intervention right now.\n\n22:55.000 --> 23:01.000\nDoing the, because I begged her to come down and she's, she had food simmering on the stove.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:07.000\nI just want to bring her out to go over a little kerfuffle we had in text.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:10.000\nYou remember our friend, my neighbor, Beth Bootson.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:11.000\nBootson?\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:19.000\nBootson, pantson, bootson, pantson, bootson, pantson, bootson, pantson, bootson, pantson, bootson, pantson, bootson, pantson, bootson, pantson.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:25.000\nBootson!\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:26.000\nAll right.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:27.000\nThis show is a.\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:30.000\nThis show is a cavalcade of stars.\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:33.000\nLay that staff across there.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:34.000\nAll right, Beth.\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:35.000\nThank you so much for coming down.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:38.000\nI know it was like, I, you know, you, you sped out of your house.\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:43.000\nI invited you last minute because I thought, well, geez, we had this thing.\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:44.000\nIt was a flare up.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:48.000\nIt was a neighborly flare up.\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:49.000\nAll right.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:51.000\nAnd I'm scrolling back in our conversation.\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:52.000\nOkay.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:54.000\nAnd it's easy because you marked it with that photo.\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:55.000\nAll right.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:59.000\nSo Beth, as you know, she came on the show with her son Timmer.\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:00.000\nYeah.\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:02.000\nWho was doing the haunted house.\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:06.000\nAnd then Timmer, the son came on again last week.\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:08.000\nWith spooky, spooky one direction.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:10.000\nHaunted house with his friends.\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:11.000\nYes.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:12.000\nYes.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:18.000\nSo the following day, Monday, 10, 11 a.m., I get, so what do we want to do?\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:25.000\nDo we want to, do we, last time we, I read your parts and you read my parts, but maybe,\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:26.000\nwhy don't we just.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:32.000\nYou know what, I think it's actually, based on all your language, maybe it's better if\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:33.000\nyou just read your own.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:34.000\nI'll read my own.\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:35.000\nAll right.\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:36.000\nBeth, I can't see.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:37.000\nAre you on a mic?\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:38.000\nYou have a microphone?\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:39.000\nHere, I'll do it right here.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:40.000\nYeah.\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:41.000\nEat that mic.\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:42.000\nOkay.\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:43.000\nSo I'm in there.\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:46.000\nSo then this happened and I'm just, you know, I don't want to take up too much of Beth's\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:50.000\ntime, but I also didn't want to, I don't want to talk about this and like, I don't even\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:51.000\nknow what happened.\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:52.000\nWell.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:54.000\nIt's like, like, like, so I guess we just start.\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:55.000\nYes.\n\n24:55.000 --> 25:06.000\nSo the, the last Sunday, my son and his friends came on and his friends were wearing gas masks\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:10.000\nand he came on to tell you about his haunted maze.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:17.000\nSo the next morning I text Dan and I said, hi Dan, last night we got a visit.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:20.000\nWe believe it was from one of your diehard fans.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:26.000\nWhoever it was stole Tamar's apocalyptic wasteland banner off of our garage door.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:30.000\nAnd then she sends a picture of the, of the, of the banner.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:34.000\nLet me see if I can show.\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:40.000\nNow what evidence did you have?\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:45.000\nI'll handle this for a 45 minute fight.\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:47.800\nBecause I have, I have minor justice issues.\n\n25:47.800 --> 25:51.800\nDan has huge justice issues, so let's see what goes down there.\n\n25:51.800 --> 25:55.800\nI have medium justice issues.\n\n25:55.800 --> 25:56.800\nWe're like the bears.\n\n25:56.800 --> 25:57.800\nYes.\n\n25:57.800 --> 26:01.800\nAnd then Spencer, your justice issues are just right.\n\n26:01.800 --> 26:02.800\nYeah.\n\n26:02.800 --> 26:03.800\nAll right.\n\n26:03.800 --> 26:13.300\nSo, so I wrote, I sent this to Dan and then I said, the price of knowing Dan Hormann.\n\n26:13.300 --> 26:18.800\nAnd I put a very surprised look of those little, what do you call them?\n\n26:18.800 --> 26:19.800\nMochis.\n\n26:19.800 --> 26:20.800\nA sticker.\n\n26:20.800 --> 26:26.800\nAnd, and, and then I wrote it again by accident and I said, oops.\n\n26:26.800 --> 26:27.800\nOkay.\n\n26:27.800 --> 26:28.800\nSo.\n\n26:28.800 --> 26:29.800\nAnd then I put, grrr.\n\n26:29.800 --> 26:32.800\nYou have to say, this sounds like you had a little wine.\n\n26:32.800 --> 26:34.800\nWith an angry face.\n\n26:34.800 --> 26:35.800\nOkay.\n\n26:35.800 --> 26:36.800\nThese are wine texts.\n\n26:36.800 --> 26:37.800\nAll right.\n\n26:37.800 --> 26:42.600\nSo then I said, why on earth would you assume an adult podcast listener would do something\n\n26:42.600 --> 26:44.600\nlike that instead of a high school student?\n\n26:44.600 --> 26:46.600\nAnd then I wrote back.\n\n26:46.600 --> 26:51.100\nI said, why would a high school student even want it so bad that they would steal it?\n\n26:51.100 --> 26:54.520\nIt has more value to the person who has something that's connected to you.\n\n26:54.520 --> 26:57.200\nA little piece of Dan Hormann.\n\n26:57.200 --> 26:58.200\nThat's a stretch.\n\n26:58.200 --> 26:59.200\nJesus.\n\n26:59.200 --> 27:05.640\nThey know my house is next door.\n\n27:05.640 --> 27:08.160\nIf they wanted a piece of me, they could take something from me.\n\n27:08.160 --> 27:09.800\nMy audience is nice people.\n\n27:09.800 --> 27:15.960\nIt makes for a great story, we will put everything away in our garage now.\n\n27:15.960 --> 27:19.440\nThey wouldn't be going to your haunted house to do anything but support you.\n\n27:19.440 --> 27:21.920\nSome of your fans are nice, normal people.\n\n27:21.920 --> 27:25.240\nSome of them are obsessed with Dan Hormann people.\n\n27:25.240 --> 27:26.740\nThat's true.\n\n27:26.740 --> 27:30.320\nYour fans are fascinated that we live next door to you.\n\n27:30.320 --> 27:31.320\nIt's okay.\n\n27:31.320 --> 27:32.320\nI'm not mad at you.\n\n27:32.320 --> 27:33.560\nWe'll just make a new one.\n\n27:33.560 --> 27:36.800\nHow could we possibly know if it is a Dan Hormann fan?\n\n27:36.800 --> 27:38.480\nWe just had a suspicion.\n\n27:38.480 --> 27:43.200\nThe boys are already excited to make a new one and they've got a great story.\n\n27:43.200 --> 27:46.640\nYou may not be mad at me, but I can't think of a reason to share that suspicion with me\n\n27:46.640 --> 27:56.880\nother than to solicit feelings of guilt.\n\n27:56.880 --> 27:58.360\nNot to make you feel guilty.\n\n27:58.360 --> 27:59.840\nIt's not your fault.\n\n27:59.840 --> 28:01.560\nIt's more a story of interest.\n\n28:01.560 --> 28:03.320\nDon't you find it interesting?\n\n28:03.320 --> 28:07.240\nWould you want me to express shame or remorse about this thing just because you have a\n\n28:07.240 --> 28:10.520\nweird theory connecting it to me?\n\n28:10.520 --> 28:13.960\nWhat if my dog got poisoned and I texted you saying I knew your friends did it?\n\n28:13.960 --> 28:18.320\nThat would be really thoughtless of me because if I respected you as a human being, I'd have\n\n28:18.320 --> 28:22.240\nto know laying something like that near you would cause you anxiety.\n\n28:22.240 --> 28:23.240\nIt's funny.\n\n28:23.240 --> 28:26.400\nWe're rather humored about it, flattered in a way.\n\n28:26.400 --> 28:30.160\nSaying you're humored and flattered that one of my fans stole your stuff is still saying\n\n28:30.160 --> 28:32.520\none of my fans stole your stuff.\n\n28:32.520 --> 28:34.600\nIt's weird to say that.\n\n28:34.600 --> 28:36.840\nWe don't know if it was one of your fans.\n\n28:36.840 --> 28:39.280\nYou don't know either.\n\n28:39.280 --> 28:40.280\nSo drunk.\n\n28:40.280 --> 28:47.680\nJust like you could smell the Chardonnay on these texts.\n\n28:47.680 --> 28:49.240\nThis is 10 a.m. though.\n\n28:49.240 --> 28:50.680\nI mean, no judgment.\n\n28:50.680 --> 28:51.680\nNotwithstanding.\n\n28:51.680 --> 28:54.240\nWe'll never really know.\n\n28:54.240 --> 28:55.600\nIt's just a suspicion.\n\n28:55.600 --> 28:57.000\nWe're not blaming you.\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:58.600\nIt's just a possibility.\n\n28:58.600 --> 29:01.160\nWe still love you no matter what.\n\n29:01.160 --> 29:05.160\nThink how cool it would be to have the banner on one's wall and be able to say that it came\n\n29:05.160 --> 29:07.960\nfrom one of Dan Harmon's episodes.\n\n29:07.960 --> 29:09.500\nMaybe it was a prankster.\n\n29:09.500 --> 29:11.000\nJust was a coincidence.\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:16.280\nYou don't have fans that are a little out there?\n\n29:16.280 --> 29:20.440\nWell I do have a crazy neighbor that accuses strangers of stealing shit, but I don't know\n\n29:20.440 --> 29:28.320\nif she's a fan or not.\n\n29:28.320 --> 29:29.560\nI didn't accuse you.\n\n29:29.560 --> 29:30.840\nI said strangers.\n\n29:30.840 --> 29:32.560\nI didn't accuse a stranger.\n\n29:32.560 --> 29:34.080\nI suspect it.\n\n29:34.080 --> 29:35.280\nYou don't really know.\n\n29:35.280 --> 29:36.920\nThought it was a possibility.\n\n29:36.920 --> 29:38.880\nThought it was a coincidence.\n\n29:38.880 --> 29:40.280\nThought it was interesting.\n\n29:40.280 --> 29:42.240\nIt's a possibility that ISIS took it.\n\n29:42.240 --> 29:44.760\nYou didn't text the president.\n\n29:44.760 --> 29:48.400\nAnd it wouldn't be coincidence if a random, unknown, unrelated person took something from\n\n29:48.400 --> 29:50.200\na haunted house that was open to the public.\n\n29:50.200 --> 29:52.560\nIt would be incidents.\n\n29:52.560 --> 29:56.560\nIf I thought that someone would do that to you guys that respected my show, I'd be livid\n\n29:56.560 --> 30:00.440\nand embarrassed.\n\n30:00.440 --> 30:05.880\nI have a neighbor sharing information with a neighbor who just happened to have an episode\n\n30:05.880 --> 30:11.960\non his podcast relating to a neighbor's haunted maze the very same night the banner goes missing.\n\n30:11.960 --> 30:13.600\nIt's just a coincidence.\n\n30:13.600 --> 30:17.160\nThere's a cardboard sign on the street corner that says haunted house.\n\n30:17.160 --> 30:19.520\nHas nobody been coming other than podcast people?\n\n30:19.520 --> 30:22.080\nDo they have podcast logos on their foreheads?\n\n30:22.080 --> 30:23.560\nIs there a sign in sheet?\n\n30:23.560 --> 30:29.680\nAnd all the people that came wrote Harmontown in the who sent you column.\n\n30:29.680 --> 30:31.000\nYou are livid.\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:33.760\nYou take responsibility for all your fans.\n\n30:33.760 --> 30:36.280\nYou know that none of them would ever do that.\n\n30:36.280 --> 30:38.920\nYou know that none of them would even consider that.\n\n30:38.920 --> 30:40.920\nDo you consider them your children?\n\n30:40.920 --> 30:45.800\nHave I offended you because I said that it is a possibility that one of your fans may\n\n30:45.800 --> 30:47.800\nhave taken it?\n\n30:47.800 --> 30:49.920\nYes!\n\n30:49.920 --> 30:51.520\nYou have!\n\n30:51.520 --> 30:53.600\nIt's an offensive thing to do.\n\n30:53.600 --> 30:58.720\nLook up the word offense.\n\n30:58.720 --> 31:00.680\nI did not accuse you.\n\n31:00.680 --> 31:02.400\nThis is not about you.\n\n31:02.400 --> 31:04.000\nWhy are you taking this so personally?\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:06.280\nThis has nothing to do with you.\n\n31:06.280 --> 31:07.680\nI'm not blaming you.\n\n31:07.680 --> 31:12.560\nThen why did you text me about it?\n\n31:12.560 --> 31:17.120\nBecause I had suspicions that it could possibly be one of your fans.\n\n31:17.120 --> 31:19.720\nSo it has something to do with me.\n\n31:19.720 --> 31:22.720\nNo, it doesn't.\n\n31:22.720 --> 31:29.280\nSo you expected me to laugh and say, haha, that's funny that someone in my podcast audience\n\n31:29.280 --> 31:31.480\nstole your property.\n\n31:31.480 --> 31:35.600\nYou joked about two episodes ago that you were afraid that if you gave our address\n\n31:35.600 --> 31:40.080\naway that everyone would know whereabouts you live and that you would come home to\n\n31:40.080 --> 31:41.920\nfind a stranger in your kitchen.\n\n31:41.920 --> 31:43.920\nI would be upset for you if that happened.\n\n31:43.920 --> 31:48.600\nI wouldn't consider it a normal human response to be amused by Timber's property being stolen\n\n31:48.600 --> 31:50.640\neven if it was by a complete random person.\n\n31:50.640 --> 31:52.200\nI would just say, oh, that's too bad.\n\n31:52.200 --> 31:54.160\nI wouldn't say, haha, that's funny.\n\n31:54.160 --> 31:58.480\nSo imagine how much weirder it would be to say, haha, to someone stealing Timber's stuff\n\n31:58.480 --> 32:01.400\nif it wasn't a complete random person but it was someone somehow doing it because of\n\n32:01.400 --> 32:02.400\nmy show.\n\n32:02.400 --> 32:05.920\nThe normal human response to the idea of that would be for me to say, oh, god, that's fucking\n\n32:05.920 --> 32:06.920\nawful.\n\n32:06.920 --> 32:07.920\nI can't believe someone did that.\n\n32:07.920 --> 32:08.920\nI'm so sorry.\n\n32:08.920 --> 32:13.200\nI didn't expect you to laugh.\n\n32:13.200 --> 32:15.480\nI didn't expect you to get mad, though.\n\n32:15.480 --> 32:17.120\nI was making a joke.\n\n32:17.120 --> 32:22.680\nYou didn't find it funny but it really was an attempt of light humor that was taken very\n\n32:22.680 --> 32:23.680\nseriously.\n\n32:23.680 --> 32:25.180\nSorry.\n\n32:25.180 --> 32:32.880\nThank you for being such a cool neighbor.\n\n32:32.880 --> 32:41.600\nYou take the high road and I'll take the low road and I'll be in Scotland before you.\n\n32:41.600 --> 32:46.240\nPeople always want to hear about what it's like to live next to Dan Harmon, a peek into\n\n32:46.240 --> 32:47.240\nhim.\n\n32:47.240 --> 32:50.960\nWell, your joke was that your son had to pay a price for living next door to me.\n\n32:50.960 --> 32:53.520\nThat would be something that I would feel terrible about and you kind of committed to\n\n32:53.520 --> 32:56.480\nthe joke to the point of arguing for a really long time that we should definitely assume\n\n32:56.480 --> 32:57.960\nsomeone that listens to the show did it.\n\n32:57.960 --> 32:59.640\nIt wasn't very clear and still isn't.\n\n32:59.640 --> 33:00.640\nWhich part is the joke?\n\n33:00.640 --> 33:03.120\nDo you still honestly believe it's more likely that someone from my audience did it and the\n\n33:03.120 --> 33:06.280\njoke was that it mattered at all or was the joke that you suspected it was someone from\n\n33:06.280 --> 33:10.600\nthe audience and you just have a very strong commitment to humor?\n\n33:10.600 --> 33:18.080\nDan, can we take that one again but faster this time?\n\n33:18.080 --> 33:21.960\nOh, Dan, it was a stupid joke.\n\n33:21.960 --> 33:25.480\nI'm not that mad.\n\n33:25.480 --> 33:32.040\nSet with balloons, but I have to fixate on my writing now.\n\n33:32.040 --> 33:34.920\nI'm way past a morning deadline and getting yelled at.\n\n33:34.920 --> 33:35.960\nPlease forgive me.\n\n33:35.960 --> 33:38.320\nI forgive you nutty pants.\n\n33:38.320 --> 33:40.000\nNo harm intended.\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:44.960\nHashtag neighbors for life.\n\n33:44.960 --> 33:52.960\nThat's a good ending.\n\n33:52.960 --> 33:58.760\nI like the new hashtag harm intended.\n\n33:58.760 --> 34:04.160\nAnd then I sent him an emoji that is the emoji where the guy's eyes are googling like this\n\n34:04.160 --> 34:08.840\nand there's the crazy guy.\n\n34:08.840 --> 34:10.720\nSo I'm not saying that you're nuts.\n\n34:10.720 --> 34:12.760\nI said, well, maybe just a little.\n\n34:12.760 --> 34:13.760\nAll right.\n\n34:13.760 --> 34:14.760\nWell, I guess.\n\n34:14.760 --> 34:15.760\nAll right.\n\n34:15.760 --> 34:19.360\nSo, you have the pulpit.\n\n34:19.360 --> 34:22.320\nDo you still think that one of my...\n\n34:22.320 --> 34:23.560\nThat we can still be friends?\n\n34:23.560 --> 34:26.520\nWell, do you still think one of my fans took your tarp?\n\n34:26.520 --> 34:30.120\nI took the fucking tarp.\n\n34:30.120 --> 34:32.040\nIt's in my car.\n\n34:32.040 --> 34:36.040\nI knew it.\n\n34:36.040 --> 34:37.040\nWell, I...\n\n34:37.040 --> 34:38.040\nWho won the tarp?\n\n34:38.040 --> 34:41.560\nI used to steal anything that wasn't nailed down.\n\n34:41.560 --> 34:42.560\nMaybe...\n\n34:42.560 --> 34:43.560\nWell...\n\n34:43.560 --> 34:46.280\nBut it's got to be a teenager unrelated to the show.\n\n34:46.280 --> 34:55.360\nThis had black gorilla tape that it was taped all to the garage and it was very, very...\n\n34:55.360 --> 35:04.880\nIt looked like a little kid that had taped it to the garage and it was big and it was...\n\n35:04.880 --> 35:09.040\nI just think it's kind of a really, really weird coincidence that...\n\n35:09.040 --> 35:10.040\nHold on.\n\n35:10.040 --> 35:11.040\nI don't know.\n\n35:11.040 --> 35:12.040\nHold on.\n\n35:12.040 --> 35:13.040\nThat the night...\n\n35:13.040 --> 35:15.040\nDon't get mad all over again.\n\n35:15.040 --> 35:17.200\nI'm trying to be mad.\n\n35:17.200 --> 35:26.880\nLet me ask you guys, because you're his fans, is it a strong coincidence that it could be...\n\n35:26.880 --> 35:29.560\nI'm not saying it's you.\n\n35:29.560 --> 35:32.800\nI'm not saying it's you.\n\n35:32.800 --> 35:36.920\nI'm sure most of you are very normal, nice people.\n\n35:36.920 --> 35:40.000\nI'm sure some of you are nice people, but a lot of you are bringing crime.\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:41.000\nYes.\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:42.000\nA lot of you are rapists.\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:43.000\nA lot of you are rapists.\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:44.000\nPossibility.\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:46.400\nI'm sure some of you are nice.\n\n35:46.400 --> 35:48.800\nSome of you are stealing signs.\n\n35:48.800 --> 35:58.120\nIs it a possibility that one of you could have driven to our house because we live next\n\n35:58.120 --> 35:59.640\ndoor to Dan Harmon?\n\n35:59.640 --> 36:07.720\nI think it's as likely that you stole this sign yourself so you can get back on the show.\n\n36:07.720 --> 36:12.480\nThere's in a world where anything's possible, there's no need to focus in on the possibility...\n\n36:12.480 --> 36:19.960\nI just think it's very, very coincidental that the next morning that we had that episode\n\n36:19.960 --> 36:23.360\nthe night before, but nobody would have stolen...\n\n36:23.360 --> 36:25.520\nSo was this Monday night that this happened?\n\n36:25.520 --> 36:27.640\nIt happened Monday more Sunday.\n\n36:27.640 --> 36:33.200\nWhen we went outside Monday morning, Monday morning, so it would have to be hearing or\n\n36:33.200 --> 36:36.240\na live streaming person that was nearby.\n\n36:36.240 --> 36:43.520\nThat somebody, you know, whatever it was, somebody, you know, somebody, one of you,\n\n36:43.520 --> 36:45.520\none of you!\n\n36:45.520 --> 36:52.480\nWell, we'll continue to, I mean, I've come forward now.\n\n36:52.480 --> 36:59.360\nWe'll lower the lights and turn our backs, and if you took the apocalypse sign, put it\n\n36:59.360 --> 37:00.360\nin there.\n\n37:00.360 --> 37:02.480\nAre you giving him a chance to turn himself in?\n\n37:02.480 --> 37:03.480\nYeah!\n\n37:03.480 --> 37:04.480\nRight.\n\n37:04.480 --> 37:05.480\nYeah, I mean, if you...\n\n37:05.480 --> 37:09.760\nWell, yeah, if someone, someone, someone, someone returned, you can, you can...\n\n37:09.760 --> 37:10.760\nJust bring it to NerdMelt.\n\n37:10.760 --> 37:11.760\nRight.\n\n37:11.760 --> 37:12.760\nYeah, bring it here and drop it off.\n\n37:12.760 --> 37:14.080\nYeah, here's a way to do it.\n\n37:14.080 --> 37:17.920\nIf you returned the sign and you were a Harmontown family, you're listening to this right\n\n37:17.920 --> 37:22.320\nnow, and you did take it, which is really cool if you did.\n\n37:22.320 --> 37:23.320\nYeah.\n\n37:23.320 --> 37:24.320\nThat's like really awesome.\n\n37:24.320 --> 37:29.760\nIt's a very, very cool banner to hang on a wall.\n\n37:29.760 --> 37:30.760\nBeth Bootson...\n\n37:30.760 --> 37:31.760\nThat somebody could say...\n\n37:31.760 --> 37:35.080\nBeth, Beth, would you put $100 bounty on that if, if, if someone could prove that they were\n\n37:35.080 --> 37:36.520\na Harmontown fan?\n\n37:36.520 --> 37:39.440\nWould you pay $100 to get that sign back?\n\n37:39.440 --> 37:40.440\nWould I pay $100?\n\n37:40.440 --> 37:41.440\nYes.\n\n37:41.440 --> 37:42.440\nYes.\n\n37:42.440 --> 37:43.440\nTo prove yourself right.\n\n37:43.440 --> 37:44.440\nYou know what?\n\n37:44.440 --> 37:45.440\nI think Dan Harmon...\n\n37:45.440 --> 37:46.440\nWhoa!\n\n37:46.440 --> 37:47.440\nOh!\n\n37:47.440 --> 37:48.440\nWould pay $100.\n\n37:48.440 --> 37:52.640\nBut then if you took it, you can just make a $100 sign.\n\n37:52.640 --> 37:53.640\nNo, I would not.\n\n37:53.640 --> 37:54.640\nI didn't take it.\n\n37:54.640 --> 37:55.640\nWell, I didn't take it either.\n\n37:55.640 --> 37:57.640\nBut Dan Harmon, I think.\n\n37:57.640 --> 37:58.640\nOkay.\n\n37:58.640 --> 37:59.960\nYou both have to, you have to match Dan's $100.\n\n37:59.960 --> 38:01.600\nYou both have to put $100.\n\n38:01.600 --> 38:04.560\n200 clams if you're a Harmonian that stole that sign.\n\n38:04.560 --> 38:05.560\nWait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\n\n38:05.560 --> 38:06.560\nYou, Beth, are...\n\n38:06.560 --> 38:07.560\nWait.\n\n38:07.560 --> 38:08.560\nNo.\n\n38:08.560 --> 38:09.560\nYou're putting up $100.\n\n38:09.560 --> 38:10.560\nBut I would be right.\n\n38:10.560 --> 38:11.560\nSo...\n\n38:11.560 --> 38:12.560\nRight, you'd be right.\n\n38:12.560 --> 38:13.560\nI would be right.\n\n38:13.560 --> 38:14.560\nBut it would cost you $100 simoleon.\n\n38:14.560 --> 38:15.560\nNo.\n\n38:15.560 --> 38:16.560\nYou would be wrong.\n\n38:16.560 --> 38:17.560\nRight, I'd be wrong.\n\n38:17.560 --> 38:18.560\nYeah.\n\n38:18.560 --> 38:23.800\nSo, the penalty for being wrong is that you have to pay $100.\n\n38:23.800 --> 38:24.800\nRight.\n\n38:24.800 --> 38:26.800\nSo, what we're saying is...\n\n38:26.800 --> 38:31.840\nWell, let me, wait, wait, wait, let me up the ante.\n\n38:31.840 --> 38:32.840\nOkay.\n\n38:32.840 --> 38:34.840\nLet me up the ante.\n\n38:34.840 --> 38:35.840\nPhysical challenge.\n\n38:35.840 --> 38:44.320\nIf we were to get that banner back, you have to pay the $100 and then autograph it for\n\n38:44.320 --> 38:46.840\nthe person.\n\n38:46.840 --> 38:53.200\nAnd then it would be worth even more when they hang it on their wall.\n\n38:53.200 --> 38:54.200\nBeth, you stole the banner.\n\n38:54.200 --> 38:55.200\nYou just won't.\n\n38:55.200 --> 38:56.200\nNo.\n\n38:56.200 --> 38:57.200\nThis is the fucking longest con I've ever seen.\n\n38:57.200 --> 38:58.200\nAre you sick of the Haunted House?\n\n38:58.200 --> 38:59.200\nThis is like the stings.\n\n38:59.200 --> 39:01.840\nAre you acting out against the Haunted House?\n\n39:01.840 --> 39:02.840\nNo, I'm...\n\n39:02.840 --> 39:03.840\nRobert Redford's about to come out.\n\n39:03.840 --> 39:04.840\nNo.\n\n39:04.840 --> 39:07.080\nI think this is a funny story.\n\n39:07.080 --> 39:10.040\nAnd wouldn't it be interesting to find out who's right?\n\n39:10.040 --> 39:11.040\nGreat.\n\n39:11.040 --> 39:12.040\nBut we won't be able to...\n\n39:12.040 --> 39:19.600\nOne thing we really can do is say, if somebody gives it back anonymously, we can...\n\n39:19.600 --> 39:23.240\nWe still won't be able to reach the conclusion, you know, automatically that a Haunted Town\n\n39:23.240 --> 39:24.240\nfan took it.\n\n39:24.240 --> 39:26.280\nHowever, that person has the...\n\n39:26.280 --> 39:28.880\nWhoever took it has the power to make it look that way.\n\n39:28.880 --> 39:31.840\nAnd we're opening ourselves up and saying, even...\n\n39:31.840 --> 39:36.560\nLike fine, if that person does that, would you be willing to pay any money for that?\n\n39:36.560 --> 39:39.280\nWell, no, no, no, no, no, no, let's look at...\n\n39:39.280 --> 39:46.080\nIf it gets returned, I think Dan Harmon should autograph it, and we can hang it here on the\n\n39:46.080 --> 39:47.080\nwall.\n\n39:47.080 --> 39:48.080\nOh, boy.\n\n39:48.080 --> 39:49.080\nAnd...\n\n39:49.080 --> 39:50.080\nCan I make a pitch?\n\n39:50.080 --> 39:51.080\nCan I...\n\n39:51.080 --> 39:52.960\nMay I make a pitch?\n\n39:52.960 --> 39:58.360\nI think anyone listening to this right now should go to that Haunted Maze, steal anything\n\n39:58.360 --> 40:00.880\nyou want.\n\n40:00.880 --> 40:03.520\nDan Harmon will autograph it for you.\n\n40:03.520 --> 40:06.440\nWell, I'll make you this deal now.\n\n40:06.440 --> 40:08.240\nLet's just go rob this fucking place.\n\n40:08.240 --> 40:13.400\nI mean, starting with the airing of this show, anything that gets stolen is kind of this\n\n40:13.400 --> 40:14.400\npodcast's fault.\n\n40:14.400 --> 40:16.400\nLike, like, like, like, because...\n\n40:16.400 --> 40:22.400\nI'm saying Harmonians now don't have the guts to go steal shit from the Bootson family.\n\n40:22.400 --> 40:25.880\nWe're putting everything in our garage now.\n\n40:25.880 --> 40:26.880\nWow, okay.\n\n40:26.880 --> 40:30.400\nBut, but anyways, all right, well, so, like, you...\n\n40:30.400 --> 40:35.200\nIs it possible, if you think of a scenario in which there's someone who is so driven\n\n40:35.200 --> 40:38.280\nby his obsession with Dan that he wants to steal...\n\n40:38.280 --> 40:39.280\nOr she.\n\n40:39.280 --> 40:43.280\nWhy do you think that person would go to you and not go to Dan's house and steal from\n\n40:43.280 --> 40:44.280\nDan's house?\n\n40:44.280 --> 40:48.200\nBecause it was the night of our episode.\n\n40:48.200 --> 40:49.200\nBut that's backwards.\n\n40:49.200 --> 40:53.000\nAnd the way they look at it, it's a really, really cool banner.\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:54.440\nThey could hang it on their wall.\n\n40:54.440 --> 40:55.440\nThat's like...\n\n40:55.440 --> 40:56.440\nAnd...\n\n40:56.440 --> 40:57.440\nThat applies to anybody.\n\n40:57.440 --> 41:02.160\nNo, it applies to only Dan Harmon fans.\n\n41:02.160 --> 41:03.400\nOne of them.\n\n41:03.400 --> 41:04.400\nOne of them.\n\n41:04.400 --> 41:09.640\nWouldn't this be cool to, like, wouldn't this be cool because I took it and it was related\n\n41:09.640 --> 41:13.320\nto Dan Harmon because it was about the episode about Harmonian mazes?\n\n41:13.320 --> 41:14.320\nAll right.\n\n41:14.320 --> 41:20.200\nWell, I feel like in this Gamera versus Mothra conflict that we have, like, like, the eucalyptus\n\n41:20.200 --> 41:23.080\ntree thing, it was like, okay, I'm the bad person.\n\n41:23.080 --> 41:24.600\nYour tree is fine, by the way.\n\n41:24.600 --> 41:26.960\nYou're the bad person in this case.\n\n41:26.960 --> 41:27.960\nIt survived those wins?\n\n41:27.960 --> 41:28.960\nOh, yeah, but you don't know.\n\n41:28.960 --> 41:32.960\nYou could be a disease eucalyptus tree and survive a million wins.\n\n41:32.960 --> 41:34.840\nNo, those trees are gone.\n\n41:34.840 --> 41:35.840\nYeah.\n\n41:35.840 --> 41:39.440\nWell, anyways, but I do want to acknowledge, like, I texted you and said, will you come\n\n41:39.440 --> 41:41.120\ndown and read this shit?\n\n41:41.120 --> 41:45.240\nAnd that's like, you had soup on the stove and you were in your pajamas and you came\n\n41:45.240 --> 41:46.240\ndown here looking at these clothes.\n\n41:46.240 --> 41:48.040\nI'm still wearing my pajama top.\n\n41:48.040 --> 41:52.160\nSo, thank you so much and we're going to...\n\n41:52.160 --> 41:53.960\nLet's hear it for Beth Bootson and...\n\n41:53.960 --> 41:54.960\nBeth Bootson!\n\n41:54.960 --> 42:05.240\nWell, don't forget to step by the haunted maze, just take every goddamn thing you can\n\n42:05.240 --> 42:06.240\nget your hands on.\n\n42:06.240 --> 42:19.560\nAnd if you bring back that tarp, yeah, the banner, Dan Harmon said he would sign it and\n\n42:19.560 --> 42:21.200\ngive you a hundred dollars.\n\n42:21.200 --> 42:22.200\nOkay.\n\n42:22.200 --> 42:23.200\nAll right.\n\n42:23.200 --> 42:28.040\nAnd if you don't bring it back, Jeff will give you a hundred dollars.\n\n42:28.040 --> 42:30.040\nBut I'm going to sign Beth Bootson.\n\n42:30.040 --> 42:31.040\nAll right.\n\n42:31.040 --> 42:32.040\nBeth Bootson!\n\n42:32.040 --> 42:44.640\nAnd the unsung hero of the Beth Bootson Chronicles, her husband, Dan, who I think drove her down\n\n42:44.640 --> 42:48.800\nhere last minute, probably went back there too, we've never even really met him.\n\n42:48.800 --> 42:49.800\nThank you, Dan.\n\n42:49.800 --> 42:50.800\nI mean, he was out here once.\n\n42:50.800 --> 42:51.800\nBut he never spoke.\n\n42:51.800 --> 42:52.800\nHe just sat there...\n\n42:52.800 --> 42:53.920\nIn blissful silence.\n\n42:53.920 --> 42:57.800\nThe long-suffering Bootson husband.\n\n42:57.800 --> 42:59.960\nThey call him on the block.\n\n42:59.960 --> 43:00.960\nBehind Beth's back.\n\n43:00.960 --> 43:01.960\nThat's what we all call him.\n\n43:01.960 --> 43:04.120\nOh, the long-suffering Bootson husband.\n\n43:04.120 --> 43:06.120\nAgain, let's take a bite of Drew Ackerman.\n\n43:06.120 --> 43:07.120\nThanks for coming up, Drew.\n\n43:07.120 --> 43:08.120\nGood to see you.\n\n43:08.120 --> 43:09.120\nAll right.\n\n43:09.120 --> 43:10.120\nAll right, Drew.\n\n43:10.120 --> 43:13.120\nJesus, this is a poor guy.\n\n43:13.120 --> 43:14.120\nI am so sorry.\n\n43:14.120 --> 43:15.120\nI...\n\n43:15.120 --> 43:16.120\nThat was awesome.\n\n43:16.120 --> 43:17.120\nOkay.\n\n43:17.120 --> 43:18.120\nHad to...\n\n43:18.120 --> 43:20.320\nIt was a timely thing.\n\n43:20.320 --> 43:21.320\nIt wasn't, though.\n\n43:21.320 --> 43:22.960\nIt was a good podcaster.\n\n43:22.960 --> 43:25.440\nYou're just being respectful of her time.\n\n43:25.440 --> 43:34.440\nSo you're a podcast conceit, which is sincere, but I have to say also doubles his genius\n\n43:34.440 --> 43:35.440\ncomedy.\n\n43:35.440 --> 43:40.740\nI mean, it's something about you that kind of, in a sublime way, rises above the dichotomy\n\n43:40.740 --> 43:44.480\nof, is he doing a bit or is he for real?\n\n43:44.480 --> 43:45.800\nYou're kind of both.\n\n43:45.800 --> 43:50.160\nYou know how funny it is that you're for real about the fact that you're dulcet tones,\n\n43:50.160 --> 43:52.200\nyour way of speaking.\n\n43:52.200 --> 43:58.440\nYou have resigned yourself instead of, in a world where everyone's trying to distinguish\n\n43:58.440 --> 44:03.000\nthemselves and entertain, you were like, you know what, come to me when you want to go\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:04.000\nto sleep.\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:05.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:07.740\nI mean, I think it's...\n\n44:07.740 --> 44:10.760\nEven as a person that makes it, I look at it like, oh, I'm putting all this work into\n\n44:10.760 --> 44:16.800\nsomething that no one listens in, and I'm a really anxious, obsessive person, so I'm constantly\n\n44:16.800 --> 44:17.800\nworrying about it.\n\n44:17.800 --> 44:22.600\nOh, this isn't good enough, blah, blah, blah, blah, and then I'm like, holy shit, like,\n\n44:22.600 --> 44:25.840\nif someone, like an outsider was watching this, they'd be like, dude, you're insane,\n\n44:25.840 --> 44:28.800\nlike, and some listeners even emailed me, they're like, why don't you just read from\n\n44:28.800 --> 44:29.800\nthe phone book?\n\n44:29.800 --> 44:31.520\nWhy do you spend so much time working on it?\n\n44:31.520 --> 44:34.960\nAnd I'm like, well, I'm convinced that's what puts you to sleep, blah, blah, blah.\n\n44:34.960 --> 44:35.960\nYeah, yeah.\n\n44:35.960 --> 44:36.960\nWell, that's...\n\n44:36.960 --> 44:40.720\nYeah, and there was an article in New Yorker about you, about your podcast that talked\n\n44:40.720 --> 44:44.400\nabout that, that insomnia is not something that people have conquered.\n\n44:44.400 --> 44:46.200\nIt's a lot like the common cold.\n\n44:46.200 --> 44:51.440\nIt is, you know, people think it's so simple, but it persists because doctors can't really\n\n44:51.440 --> 44:52.440\nget around it.\n\n44:52.440 --> 44:57.800\nBecause anything a doctor would prescribe to you, it becomes part of this labyrinth of\n\n44:57.800 --> 45:00.760\nanxiety that keeps people awake.\n\n45:00.760 --> 45:02.960\nYou yourself suffer from insomnia, correct?\n\n45:02.960 --> 45:06.560\nYeah, yeah, like, I mean, the podcast, it was funny because last Sunday, you were kind\n\n45:06.560 --> 45:11.200\nof talking about Sunday nights, and you were having a shitty night, and you're like, oh,\n\n45:11.200 --> 45:16.360\nand for me, that's where the podcast came out of was like, I had the terrible time at\n\n45:16.360 --> 45:17.360\nschool.\n\n45:17.360 --> 45:21.400\nAnd I would like, when Sundays were coming, I would not be able to sleep and I'd be like,\n\n45:21.400 --> 45:22.400\nI'll worried.\n\n45:22.400 --> 45:27.080\nAnd I was like, oh, I told my parents and they're like, drink some milk or like, you know, whatever\n\n45:27.080 --> 45:28.080\nthe...\n\n45:28.080 --> 45:29.080\nAnd I'm like, no, you don't understand.\n\n45:29.080 --> 45:34.360\nI like spend the whole night worrying and they're like, oh, and then I started listening\n\n45:34.360 --> 45:38.720\nto Dr. Demento, like weird Al and stuff.\n\n45:38.720 --> 45:42.920\nAnd it never put me to sleep, but it like took my mind off of like lying there and worrying\n\n45:42.920 --> 45:46.360\nand thinking about going to school the next day and getting in trouble and stuff.\n\n45:46.360 --> 45:50.680\nAnd yeah, I don't think like pills can work for some people.\n\n45:50.680 --> 45:54.080\nThere's different things that work for different people, but I think like a lot of people want\n\n45:54.080 --> 45:55.080\na bedtime story.\n\n45:55.080 --> 45:56.080\nYeah.\n\n45:56.080 --> 45:57.440\nNow, what do you do exactly?\n\n45:57.440 --> 46:02.160\nWhat makes you think that you're so narcotic that you can put people to sleep by talking?\n\n46:02.160 --> 46:03.160\nWhat is it about you that...\n\n46:03.160 --> 46:09.040\nWell, is it verifiable that people have said thank you, you knock me right out?\n\n46:09.040 --> 46:10.040\nYeah.\n\n46:10.040 --> 46:13.160\nAnd your sponsors are mattresses and stuff.\n\n46:13.160 --> 46:14.160\nYeah.\n\n46:14.160 --> 46:15.160\nYeah.\n\n46:15.160 --> 46:16.160\nLike...\n\n46:16.160 --> 46:17.160\nAnd he has...\n\n46:17.160 --> 46:20.880\nI think you have about as many listeners as maybe more than us.\n\n46:20.880 --> 46:23.480\nI mean, he's very humble and self-effacing.\n\n46:23.480 --> 46:25.640\nNew Yorker never wrote shit about Harmontown.\n\n46:25.640 --> 46:31.440\nBut the New Yorker piece on you, which was June 2016, but they...\n\n46:31.440 --> 46:37.680\nI copied and pasted this, it said, the ideal bedtime story, according to Natune Verma,\n\n46:37.680 --> 46:42.400\na national spokesperson for the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.\n\n46:42.400 --> 46:49.040\nSo the ideal bedtime story is one that doesn't build upon itself, like a movie with a lot\n\n46:49.040 --> 46:54.680\nof parallel stories that don't connect at the end, which I thought was kind of interesting.\n\n46:54.680 --> 46:59.800\nThe children's books that our parents would sit with us, they do have a kind of like meandering\n\n46:59.800 --> 47:01.960\nquality, they don't exactly like...\n\n47:01.960 --> 47:02.960\nThey're not die-hard.\n\n47:02.960 --> 47:03.960\nThey don't like...\n\n47:03.960 --> 47:04.960\nYeah, yeah.\n\n47:04.960 --> 47:08.920\nYou know, like the longer you're listening, the bigger the build is, oh my God, Hans Gruber\n\n47:08.920 --> 47:11.240\nis gonna get it.\n\n47:11.240 --> 47:13.080\nIt's like, oh, and then this, and then the...\n\n47:13.080 --> 47:17.640\nMy mother would always read Beowulf to me, but I don't know how to read it.\n\n47:17.640 --> 47:18.640\nBut you...\n\n47:18.640 --> 47:21.160\nWhen you first started doing the podcast, how many episodes have you done?\n\n47:21.160 --> 47:22.640\nBecause you do about three a week.\n\n47:22.640 --> 47:26.240\nYeah, like I've done like 400 and like more than 450.\n\n47:26.240 --> 47:27.240\nHow long have you been at it?\n\n47:27.240 --> 47:28.240\nSince what year?\n\n47:28.240 --> 47:29.240\nLike three years, so...\n\n47:29.240 --> 47:33.120\nI think it was less time than we've been doing this podcast and has twice as well.\n\n47:33.120 --> 47:34.120\nThis...\n\n47:34.120 --> 47:35.120\nOf course, the math would work out, Dan.\n\n47:35.120 --> 47:36.120\nYeah.\n\n47:36.120 --> 47:44.000\nIf you stacked his podcasts on top of ours, there'd be three times as many.\n\n47:44.000 --> 47:46.760\nBecause he does them three times a week.\n\n47:46.760 --> 47:52.080\nIf the moon was one from the earth, he'd have hit it three times.\n\n47:52.080 --> 47:55.400\nThanks, Dan.\n\n47:55.400 --> 47:58.200\nBut did you originally start doing it?\n\n47:58.200 --> 47:59.720\nI didn't go back to the beginning.\n\n47:59.720 --> 48:03.080\nDid you start trying to just straight up tell bedtime stories?\n\n48:03.080 --> 48:04.560\nI was curious.\n\n48:04.560 --> 48:09.640\nI was like, man, I liked listening to podcasts and comedy podcasts and stuff, and I was like,\n\n48:09.640 --> 48:10.640\nman, why...\n\n48:10.640 --> 48:16.240\nAnd this isn't like a knock on guided meditations or nature sounds, but it was always like something\n\n48:16.240 --> 48:17.240\nthat...\n\n48:17.240 --> 48:21.000\nI'm an irritable person, so it would irritate me or the nature noises we'd get at.\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:22.000\nI'd be like, why?\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:28.160\nAnd I was like, why isn't there something that's a little bit weird but that has a bedtime\n\n48:28.160 --> 48:29.160\nstory.\n\n48:29.160 --> 48:32.160\nThere's also a factor, because you're such a smart, funny guy.\n\n48:32.160 --> 48:41.480\nThe thing is, I'm sure nature, those tapes, the people that tend to delve into that area,\n\n48:41.480 --> 48:42.880\nthey don't have...\n\n48:42.880 --> 48:46.480\nGod bless them, but they're not...\n\n48:46.480 --> 48:48.480\nThere's funny things that can happen that they don't acknowledge.\n\n48:48.480 --> 48:52.040\nYeah, they're not lying there thinking about, what are the bugs crawling around?\n\n48:52.040 --> 48:53.160\nWhere the hell is this rain?\n\n48:53.160 --> 48:54.160\nLike Schrab\n\n48:54.160 --> 48:57.040\nMy partner Schrab was a partner friend, but he's a friend now.\n\n48:57.040 --> 48:59.160\nHe's a kind of a common lot of...\n\n48:59.160 --> 49:02.720\nA life partner, yeah.\n\n49:02.720 --> 49:03.720\nHe tried to do...\n\n49:03.720 --> 49:07.440\nHe had a therapist that would make his own tape, he would give him tapes and sell them\n\n49:07.440 --> 49:09.160\nto him.\n\n49:09.160 --> 49:15.040\nThis just happens at this point in the show, don't worry about it.\n\n49:15.040 --> 49:16.040\nBut one of the things...\n\n49:16.040 --> 49:19.320\nI remember Schrab describing to me, oh yeah, I'm listening to this tape and this guy's\n\n49:19.320 --> 49:24.160\nlike talking to me about, you're going to be less intimidated in public, you're going\n\n49:24.160 --> 49:29.520\nto be issuing these commands, but then clearly a screen door opens and some woman comes home\n\n49:29.520 --> 49:40.200\nwith groceries and there's these random sounds that happen.\n\n49:40.200 --> 49:44.480\nPeople that put themselves in charge of your spirit and your essence, the danger there\n\n49:44.480 --> 49:46.680\nis that the drawstring is pulled so...\n\n49:46.680 --> 49:53.560\nThe drawstring, the bowstring is drawn so tight that the slightest bit of humanity...\n\n49:53.560 --> 49:57.200\nLike shoots an arrow across the room, it's very distracting.\n\n49:57.200 --> 49:59.760\nYou're from the outset...\n\n49:59.760 --> 50:05.240\nThe first episode that I listened to you do, you just had decided that you wanted to talk\n\n50:05.240 --> 50:06.240\nabout...\n\n50:06.240 --> 50:10.560\nWell, you didn't decide, you talked about crackers for 30 minutes.\n\n50:10.560 --> 50:18.800\n30 hardcore, like crack, like just the labyrinth of your mind.\n\n50:18.800 --> 50:21.800\nI don't think I would fall asleep to that, I think I'd want to know all about it.\n\n50:21.800 --> 50:26.320\nJust to think about, isn't there a cracker industry, that's what I was thinking about,\n\n50:26.320 --> 50:35.280\nyou got the green box crackers, you got the red box crackers, what other ones are there?\n\n50:35.280 --> 50:42.560\nYou have a whole national biscuit company, you've got the Nabisco, all of Trump's followers.\n\n50:42.560 --> 50:46.480\nIt brought me to the edge of my consciousness listening to the cracker thing and then what\n\n50:46.480 --> 50:52.160\nyou really got into was that you'd become obsessed with Rick Moranis and you wanted\n\n50:52.160 --> 50:57.720\nto talk and I would drift in and out of consciousness and when I would drift back into consciousness,\n\n50:57.720 --> 51:06.080\nyou were still in what apparently was, I guess, a fantasy improv that was a conversation\n\n51:06.080 --> 51:14.000\nbetween you and Rick Moranis, just for what seemingly, it seems like it's six hours.\n\n51:14.000 --> 51:18.280\nThe podcast started about two hours long but it seems like, that's the beautiful thing,\n\n51:18.280 --> 51:22.360\nwe use ocean waves and howler monkeys and things.\n\n51:22.360 --> 51:27.400\nThat drew, for somebody, I don't suffer from insomnia, I sleep pretty well.\n\n51:27.400 --> 51:31.840\nIs this something that would put anyone to sleep or is it a certain mindset that goes\n\n51:31.840 --> 51:35.640\ninto this thing, I need this particularly to knock me out?\n\n51:35.640 --> 51:40.960\nYou would know pretty quick, the people that won't put to sleep hate me, they email me,\n\n51:40.960 --> 51:46.320\nthey're like, I fucking hate your voice, so it's pretty, because it is, like, damn\n\n51:46.320 --> 51:51.640\na sin, some people, certain things work for, they want to be led on this journey to find\n\n51:51.640 --> 51:55.920\nthe magical box within their soul or whatever, but that's just not me, I want something that's\n\n51:55.920 --> 51:56.920\ngoofy.\n\n51:56.920 --> 51:59.920\nDo you ever slip in any words of bleminal stuff?\n\n51:59.920 --> 52:08.160\nI tried a few times, yeah, and the sad thing was no one emailed me, I was like, okay, my\n\n52:08.160 --> 52:14.760\nlittle ninjas, like I was pretending I was giving a seminar on profiting from boredom\n\n52:14.760 --> 52:21.200\nor something, and then I was like, okay, now you're going to kill it, I didn't say kill\n\n52:21.200 --> 52:22.200\nit.\n\n52:22.200 --> 52:28.320\nHow did you describe yourself when you were, in the episode you just did, if people listen\n\n52:28.320 --> 52:32.600\nright now to the latest episode, you talk about your nervous coming out of the podcast\n\n52:32.600 --> 52:36.960\nand you try to do my story circle model with a thing, it makes me feel like I ruined your\n\n52:36.960 --> 52:45.280\npodcast because you're talking about my bullshit all night, but it was also brilliant, I mean\n\n52:45.280 --> 52:46.280\nyou were-\n\n52:46.280 --> 52:48.400\nI'm sure lots of people fell asleep to that, damn it.\n\n52:48.400 --> 52:56.240\nYeah, no, I don't flatter myself that way, but in that episode you said, sometimes you're\n\n52:56.240 --> 53:03.560\nexplaining each podcast episode, you're explaining to people who might be new, you're telling\n\n53:03.560 --> 53:08.640\nthem how to categorize you, and this episode you said something like, I'm just that friend\n\n53:08.640 --> 53:17.600\nof yours that you think, I'm your friend that you're allowed to think is a doofus, what\n\n53:17.600 --> 53:18.600\ndid you say?\n\n53:18.600 --> 53:23.280\nSomething like that, I mean that's kind of the conceit of the podcast is like, I mean\n\n53:23.280 --> 53:28.120\nvia podcast, like I'm coming over to your house, but you have no commitment to listen\n\n53:28.120 --> 53:34.600\nto me, or humor me, or offer me a drink, I mean like almost like a super stone person\n\n53:34.600 --> 53:39.200\nthat won't stop talking, but instead of getting on your nerves, you're like, I'm just gonna\n\n53:39.200 --> 53:44.920\nlie here and fall asleep, and they're like, totally, I don't care at all, let me tell\n\n53:44.920 --> 53:49.200\nyou about the time I showed over Rick Moranis' house and tried to pitch him to get back.\n\n53:49.200 --> 53:53.960\nI might have mentioned this a long time ago in a Harmontown, but I was on a flight and\n\n53:53.960 --> 53:58.280\nAlec Baldwin, this was a long time ago, like pre-30 Rock, was sitting across the aisle\n\n53:58.280 --> 54:02.080\nfrom me, and he was sitting next to a woman who I don't think he knew, and I had the\n\n54:02.080 --> 54:07.520\nBose noise canceling headset on, so I could just barely hear him, and it was the greatest\n\n54:07.520 --> 54:13.320\nthing to fall asleep to, he was like, you know when I was six I had this dog, this dog\n\n54:13.320 --> 54:14.320\nran away.\n\n54:14.320 --> 54:17.480\nHe told the story about this dog that ran away, I was like, I just drifted beautifully\n\n54:17.480 --> 54:21.760\noff to sleep, like I want Alec Baldwin just to come over and just lay next to me and whisper.\n\n54:21.760 --> 54:30.240\nYeah, like I'm kind of like the boring crappy version of Alec Baldwin, but also weirder,\n\n54:30.240 --> 54:34.440\nlike I try to stay calm, I think that's another thing about the podcast is I tend to be really\n\n54:34.440 --> 54:39.720\nanxious and spastic, but to do the show I've got to be like, I've got to calm down and\n\n54:39.720 --> 54:46.880\nbe like, well one, I can't believe Mrs. LaRusso lists this in a freaking podcast, but even\n\n54:46.880 --> 54:52.920\nthis would be like, okay there was just a woman on stage and it's clear to me, she's\n\n54:52.920 --> 54:58.200\nso sick of her son's haunted house that she's trying to set up Dan, and I was pitching\n\n54:58.200 --> 55:02.600\nher one night and she came out of the house, she checked Timor's door to see if Timor is\n\n55:02.600 --> 55:08.480\nasleep, when you think about Timor, you're like, what does he have on his walls, what\n\n55:08.480 --> 55:16.760\nposters does he have, and then I think about myself and I'm like man, I wish I didn't have\n\n55:16.760 --> 55:21.120\nthat, I could have never made a haunted house, like I think I started making it, so that's\n\n55:21.120 --> 55:23.640\nkind of the podcast.\n\n55:23.640 --> 55:31.480\nSo it's all, it's all free association, do you prepare anything, you just totally riff\n\n55:31.480 --> 55:33.440\nand just go with the flow?\n\n55:33.440 --> 55:40.080\nSo I do one free association one every week, then I do one, like that's like soft scripted,\n\n55:40.080 --> 55:45.080\nlike outline with dialogue, and then I do one on like TV shows, so right now I've been\n\n55:45.080 --> 55:49.920\nwatching, like there's a Colombian version of Breaking Bad, it's called metastasis, and\n\n55:49.920 --> 55:54.960\nit's like, it's awesome, it's like a shot for shot remake, almost shot for shot.\n\n55:54.960 --> 55:58.520\nSo, and this is how ill I am, it's called metastasis.\n\n55:58.520 --> 55:59.520\nLike tumors.\n\n55:59.520 --> 56:01.680\nYeah, because Walter White.\n\n56:01.680 --> 56:04.360\nI never saw it, sorry.\n\n56:04.360 --> 56:05.360\nOne day.\n\n56:05.360 --> 56:12.800\nThey have to focus more on the cancer than the drugs in this version, because some things\n\n56:12.800 --> 56:16.560\nare more shocking than others.\n\n56:16.560 --> 56:20.240\nBut yeah, like so I'll watch the Colombian version of Breaking Bad, then I'll watch Breaking\n\n56:20.240 --> 56:24.960\nBad, I'll take a ton of notes, and then I'll just be like, it's Walter Blanco, so I'll\n\n56:24.960 --> 56:27.560\nbe like, not Walter Blanco.\n\n56:27.560 --> 56:28.560\nWalter Blanco.\n\n56:28.560 --> 56:31.320\nBut they left, they left Walter.\n\n56:31.320 --> 56:41.720\nAnd Saul Bueno, Saul Bueno, it is really good, like the acting, it's not like a joke,\n\n56:41.720 --> 56:44.800\nit's like, it made me appreciate Breaking Bad so much more.\n\n56:44.800 --> 56:45.800\nWhat is it that draws you to it?\n\n56:45.800 --> 56:50.920\nBecause I think you said, you're actually kind of teaching yourself Spanish, or brushing\n\n56:50.920 --> 56:51.920\nup on your Spanish?\n\n56:51.920 --> 56:58.200\nI've learned about, I've watched 61 episodes, I probably, like twice, and I probably still\n\n56:58.200 --> 57:00.800\nknow the same words when I failed out of Spanish in high school.\n\n57:00.800 --> 57:04.320\nBut what is drawing you to that, because when I hear about that, I think, okay, I'd like\n\n57:04.320 --> 57:08.520\nto watch a five minute clip of that, but what do you, so you're really, you're hooked on\n\n57:08.520 --> 57:10.520\na thing that you already know the story, and you're watching it.\n\n57:10.520 --> 57:15.080\nI said he's a bit obsessive about your, yeah, I think it's like, well, one, it's like, from\n\n57:15.080 --> 57:18.960\nmaking anything every single week, it's like, I got to watch it every week.\n\n57:18.960 --> 57:22.720\nSo like, people are like, oh, why don't you do something like the Smurfs or something?\n\n57:22.720 --> 57:26.520\nAnd I'm like, well, I'd lose my mind, like I could watch two weeks of the Smurfs.\n\n57:26.520 --> 57:28.600\nBut Breaking Bad is a great show.\n\n57:28.600 --> 57:32.640\nAnd then it's just interesting watching, like a kind of Colombian interpretation.\n\n57:32.640 --> 57:38.400\nAll right, so it's always giving you something, because it's lateral, I think, I get that\n\n57:38.400 --> 57:43.800\nnow, correct me if I'm wrong, this is maybe something that you wouldn't do at all if you\n\n57:43.800 --> 57:46.320\ndidn't have this podcast to contend with.\n\n57:46.320 --> 57:47.320\nExactly.\n\n57:47.320 --> 57:51.280\nLike you're actually using it to like kind of charge a battery.\n\n57:51.280 --> 57:54.200\nYeah, because like, you know, when you're like, you're watching something and then you're\n\n57:54.200 --> 57:57.760\nlike, kind of like start playing around on your phone or whatever, like this, like I\n\n57:57.760 --> 58:05.000\nhave to be engaged in, I don't know, I guess like, because it's like, pointlessly challenging,\n\n58:05.000 --> 58:09.000\nI don't know, but what about that drives me, but it's like, like almost like I was like,\n\n58:09.000 --> 58:13.280\nI'm not going to watch 62, I'm going to watch 62 episodes of this Colombian Breaking Bad.\n\n58:13.280 --> 58:15.800\nBut then it's like, I have to find material in it.\n\n58:15.800 --> 58:18.040\nSo it's like, I'm mining and I'm watching their shirts and stuff.\n\n58:18.040 --> 58:19.040\nAnd I'm like, oh, that's boring.\n\n58:19.040 --> 58:23.080\nI could talk about a shirt for eight minutes, like no problem.\n\n58:23.080 --> 58:24.880\nSo we've got a mind capable of that.\n\n58:24.880 --> 58:31.600\nAnd we've got somebody who also in the episode, not to spoil it, but you almost inexplicably\n\n58:31.600 --> 58:40.200\nfocus in trying to decode my story model, you've, you choose to use this amazing song\n\n58:40.200 --> 58:42.720\nfrom a chorus line, the musical.\n\n58:42.720 --> 58:43.840\nWhy is that your favorite song?\n\n58:43.840 --> 58:44.840\nWhy and why?\n\n58:44.840 --> 58:45.840\nWhich song?\n\n58:45.840 --> 58:46.840\nI feel nothing.\n\n58:46.840 --> 58:47.840\nNothing.\n\n58:47.840 --> 58:48.840\nYeah.\n\n58:48.840 --> 58:49.840\nOh yeah.\n\n58:49.840 --> 58:50.840\nLike just because every day for a week.\n\n58:50.840 --> 58:51.840\nYeah.\n\n58:51.840 --> 58:52.840\nIt's a good song.\n\n58:52.840 --> 58:58.600\nWell, like it just like, I think like it, it goes back to like why, why do certain people\n\n58:58.600 --> 59:02.960\ncan't sleep like overthinking people or people that obsess about stuff.\n\n59:02.960 --> 59:06.760\nAnd it's like, that song does have some truth in it.\n\n59:06.760 --> 59:08.280\nAnd then it has this like feeling for me.\n\n59:08.280 --> 59:09.840\nIt's like, oh wait, I'm dead inside.\n\n59:09.840 --> 59:13.720\nLike so, so like, like I'm like, when I hear the song, I think about that.\n\n59:13.720 --> 59:19.760\nLike, and I like it better because I'm like, okay, she's singing about this surface thing.\n\n59:19.760 --> 59:23.280\nAnd then there's this whole other thing going on within the story of the song.\n\n59:23.280 --> 59:28.080\nAnd then there's like the truth behind it, like, like, like, like just whatever happened\n\n59:28.080 --> 59:30.960\nout here on the stage with the fricking haunted house.\n\n59:30.960 --> 59:35.520\nIt's like, like you could start to unpack that it's like, and I mean, the fact that\n\n59:35.520 --> 59:39.520\nyou talked, you text with your neighbor, that's great.\n\n59:39.520 --> 59:47.040\nShe texts with me and I respond every time I said, no, don't, don't, don't be sad.\n\n59:47.040 --> 59:48.800\nIt's she'll be fine.\n\n59:48.800 --> 59:50.920\nShe'll be back next week.\n\n59:50.920 --> 59:55.880\nBut, but, but I'm so intrigued by that because I just, you know, real quick, real quick,\n\n59:55.880 --> 01:00:00.520\nthis might be, might be prickly of me to say this.\n\n01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:08.080\nHow much zero to 100% do you think that she engaged you in that text conversation because\n\n01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.520\nshe thought it might parlay into being back up here?\n\n01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:15.000\nI don't, I think, I think, zero percent, I think zero, I think zero percent at the\n\n01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.120\nbeginning and, and then 10%, 10% of the way through just like me.\n\n01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.120\nI don't know.\n\n01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:25.480\nI was like, I like, I'm not, I'm not, I don't mean that to disparage her in any way.\n\n01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:29.160\nBut like, is there, is there a part of her, like, like, does she love being up here so\n\n01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:33.000\nmuch that like, like she engages with you for that?\n\n01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.960\nYou know, let's let that, let's, let's, let's, let's not be addicted to dichotomy.\n\n01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.080\nI mean, what are we learning with this election?\n\n01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:43.560\nLike, like, like, if we, if we follow the path of good person, bad person long enough,\n\n01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:46.720\nwe're going to end up in a fucking desert where we're going to lose our fucking minds\n\n01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:50.600\nbecause like, like the truth is, like, we're all just different kinds of people.\n\n01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:55.880\nAnd like, like, like, like, I just like, like, you know, is she, is she, is she a good neighbor?\n\n01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:56.880\nIs she a bad neighbor?\n\n01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:57.880\nAm I a bad neighbor?\n\n01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:58.880\nAm I a bad person?\n\n01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.600\nLike, should I let more light into my life?\n\n01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:01.760\nShould I read her screenplay?\n\n01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.760\nIs she an attention whore?\n\n01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.400\nIs, is, is, is fame bad?\n\n01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:10.200\nIs it, is, is everything, it's like these questions, like, like, like, I, my, my, my,\n\n01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:15.160\nmy epiphany lately in, in, in therapy and just in thinking about it and driving to work\n\n01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:18.360\nwith Spencer every day is just like, dichotomy is like a crutch.\n\n01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:24.440\nLike dichotomy is laziness, is ideological laziness, like we've talked about this, like,\n\n01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:29.080\nlike the idea that it's things are one thing or the other is kind of like, it's, it's an\n\n01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:33.600\naddiction and it's a comfort zone and it's like, I don't know, you know, like, like,\n\n01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:38.760\nI'm not saying that it's binary that she is all one or all the other, but I'm not trying\n\n01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:42.840\nto high road you also, I that sounds like, I sound like I'm a little high flown saying\n\n01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:47.720\nthat and answered your thing, but, but I also just like, I'm like, yeah, look, I don't know,\n\n01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:50.840\nhe's my neighbor, Beth, like she, like, she's like a character.\n\n01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:51.840\nI don't know.\n\n01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:54.040\nYou know, Joey, let's check, check back in with you.\n\n01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.040\nDid you get your tarot cards?\n\n01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.040\nJoey.\n\n01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:00.040\nOh shit.\n\n01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.040\nWhat card is that?\n\n01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:06.000\nJoey, to his credit, has sat there in graveyard silence the entire time and just totally digging\n\n01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000\nit.\n\n01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.160\nI'm very excited to be here.\n\n01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.160\nOh shit.\n\n01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.400\nI love you, Joey.\n\n01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.200\nSo this is for you.\n\n01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:15.760\nYou are the king of cups.\n\n01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:20.360\nI don't know the individual's name, but if anyone could find out who was the first person\n\n01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:26.240\nto use ether to anesthetize therapeutically, that is who his past life was.\n\n01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.960\nIsn't Dan the king of cups?\n\n01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:31.080\nI'm in the night of cups.\n\n01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:34.440\nOh, that's like my favorite bugs money routine, too.\n\n01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:39.640\nSo the ether one, so you're saying that he is the, that he's the reincarnation of the\n\n01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:43.200\nperson that first used ether to anesthetize.\n\n01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.200\nThat's right.\n\n01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:45.200\nReally?\n\n01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:46.200\nSo does that come to you?\n\n01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:49.600\nIs that some sort of Da Vinic thing that happens?\n\n01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:52.040\nWe have a Google search.\n\n01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:53.040\nGot our fans are awesome.\n\n01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:54.040\nOkay.\n\n01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:57.040\nThey would never steal a sign.\n\n01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:01.280\nSorry, yeah, you know, but you know, I don't mean to kiss your ass, but you did notice\n\n01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:07.680\nin that text conversation, I was kind of sticking up for you guys.\n\n01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:11.200\nHuman teeth are chloroform.\n\n01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.200\nYes.\n\n01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.200\nHuman.\n\n01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:16.080\nHuman teeth and chloroform.\n\n01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:22.920\nIt says that William Thomas Green Morton, who lived from August 9th, 1819 to July 15th,\n\n01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:29.320\n1868, was an American dentist who first publicly demonstrated the use of inhaled ether as a\n\n01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.560\nsurgical anesthetic.\n\n01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:32.560\nHow'd he die?\n\n01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.560\n1846.\n\n01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:39.640\nHe died on an ether bench.\n\n01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:43.400\nI think he went on ether and cut his leg open and bled to death.\n\n01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.400\nOh, really?\n\n01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.400\nThat's why I asked.\n\n01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:46.400\nMaybe that's chloroform.\n\n01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.960\nThat's my favorite scene and fear and loathing in the book by Hunter S. Thompson, where\n\n01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:53.320\nhe just pours ether on the floorboard of his car at the convertible, so he just wafts\n\n01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:57.520\nup and he goes into circus, circus, and loses his fucking shit.\n\n01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:58.520\nAll right.\n\n01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:00.040\nLet's see how you do it.\n\n01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.040\nWell, sorry.\n\n01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.040\nSo back diving into...\n\n01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.040\nIt's 9-11.\n\n01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.040\nIt's 9-11.\n\n01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.040\nIt's 9-11.\n\n01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:09.600\nIt's the most wonderful time of the day.\n\n01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:15.320\nWhen the planes are all falling and buildings...\n\n01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.760\nDon't fucking do that.\n\n01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:23.320\nYou cheer for 9-11 every week.\n\n01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:29.720\nThat song on paper, I'm only familiar with the movie, but the lyrics to that song on\n\n01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:36.280\npaper make me think that that is the story of somebody who is realizing that the dichotomy\n\n01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:43.520\nof feeling versus not feeling is a flawed dichotomy and that she is escaping it and realizing\n\n01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:46.120\nthat she can cry.\n\n01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:50.620\nIn the end, what makes her cry is the fact that she is numb.\n\n01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:55.440\nWhat makes her cry is her alienation.\n\n01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:59.400\nThat is not foreign to me, and I felt like you were kind of...\n\n01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:03.200\nYeah, that song is the idea that like, don't tell me to lie.\n\n01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:06.080\nDon't tell me that I'm an ice cream cone.\n\n01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:09.840\nLike, if you make me pretend to be an ice cream cone, I feel nothing, and then when\n\n01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:12.800\nhe died, she feels nothing.\n\n01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:17.240\nBut also, she feels nothing so passionately that maybe we need new language for feeling\n\n01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:20.640\nversus not feeling, and that you don't want to rely on us.\n\n01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:24.480\nOh, you either know what an ice cream cone feels like or you're not empathic.\n\n01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:30.080\nAre we talking about my girl, what is this?\n\n01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:31.080\nChorus Line.\n\n01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:32.080\nOh, Chorus Line.\n\n01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:39.120\nOn stage, I was with Greg Poops on stage last night, and I said a line in a dumb game,\n\n01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:41.600\nand I said, who am I anyway?\n\n01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.200\nAm I my resume?\n\n01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:45.400\nAnd Greg said, am I a picture of a person I don't know?\n\n01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:50.040\nAnd there's one girl in the balcony who was like, wow!\n\n01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.840\nBecause she was probably just in Chorus Line or loves that movie.\n\n01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:55.680\nBut those songs are really dark and really great.\n\n01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:03.000\nSo have you, Drew, felt throughout your life intellectually rattling and emotionally numb?\n\n01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.840\nDoes that lead to insomnia?\n\n01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:12.800\nDoes that lead to a connection with people who are, as you say, joining you across the\n\n01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:15.080\ndeep dark?\n\n01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:19.360\nTalk about your relationship with the universe.\n\n01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:20.800\nDo you think people are bad?\n\n01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:23.040\nDo you hate everybody?\n\n01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:28.520\nDo you look at them as like, I won't give you options, you just go.\n\n01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:37.120\nI think it's like, my interest in doing the podcast came out of this miserable thing.\n\n01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:41.040\nWhen I couldn't sleep and I'd be thinking about going to school, and I went to Catholic\n\n01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:48.280\nschool, and me and the nuns did not get along, they just fucking hated me.\n\n01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:55.240\nI think I had undiagnosed dyslexia or something, and they were like, oh no, you're just lazy.\n\n01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:59.320\nYou have the ability to do the work, but you choose not to.\n\n01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:03.880\nSo then I internalize that whatever, it's like, okay, so it's you versus me.\n\n01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:09.160\nSo now I know the kind of deal, like a little bit of a dichotomy, because I was like a kid.\n\n01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:12.920\nThese authority figures are out to get me, and I'm this kid.\n\n01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.760\nAnd I think that just led to me trying to figure stuff out at night, like I'd be lying\n\n01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:16.760\nthere thinking, well, what am I going to do?\n\n01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:17.760\nWhat am I going to say?\n\n01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:20.880\nAnd I think I still have this, well, am I going to be a good guest when I go on harm\n\n01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:21.880\ntime?\n\n01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:22.880\nWhat am I going to do?\n\n01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:25.880\nAnd there's like, oh, let me read some more about Dan.\n\n01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:33.400\nBut there's another thing that's like, oh, man, calm down.\n\n01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:38.280\nAnd I don't have total access to that, except when I do the podcast, but it's like, oh yeah,\n\n01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:43.880\nthose nuns, like some super mellow part, like dude, you might have to recruit you as my\n\n01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:46.520\nsit on my shoulder or something.\n\n01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:49.280\nShe'd be like, oh, you know what?\n\n01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:54.960\nAnd I think it's like, the truth in the song, too, is that she's like, in this put-in situation,\n\n01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:59.200\nshe gets into this performing arts school, and it's like, oh, this is it.\n\n01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:01.720\nThis is, I'm going to make it now.\n\n01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:05.320\nAnd this is like this teacher, Mr. Karp, who's a dick, spoiler.\n\n01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:10.240\nAnd he teaches the improv class or whatever, where she's supposed to feel all this stuff.\n\n01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:14.000\nI'm going to make it now, not to interject, but because the idea of getting accepted to\n\n01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:20.560\na school, that comes from a place of, oh, well, these people need to be pleased.\n\n01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.680\nAnd once they're pleased, you're fucking set.\n\n01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:26.120\nYou're going to Hogwarts, you're going to be a wizard.\n\n01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:27.120\nBut then, no.\n\n01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:28.120\nSo anyways.\n\n01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.120\nYeah.\n\n01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:32.720\nAnd I don't know, I was also trying to get inside your head.\n\n01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:38.360\nI was like, oh, man, once I started reading about how you think about story and stuff,\n\n01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:43.200\nI don't know, those things just feel like puzzles a little bit or something, and it just draws\n\n01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:51.720\nme and stuff that's like, okay, this isn't just about an entertaining story.\n\n01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:56.440\nJust like not being able to sleep or that scientists don't understand sleep.\n\n01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:01.120\nJust like Rick and Morty, there's way more there than you see on the first one or two\n\n01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:02.120\nwatch flues.\n\n01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:06.160\nIt's like there's something going on below the surface, and that's what people connect\n\n01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:07.160\nto.\n\n01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:11.680\nAnd in this song, what I connect to is she's like, shit, I don't care that he died.\n\n01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.560\nI'm in full acceptance that I feel nothing.\n\n01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:15.560\nI don't know.\n\n01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:21.800\nBut the day that you say, I don't care that this person died, that can be an incredibly\n\n01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:22.800\nfucking...\n\n01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:28.280\nBut Mr. Karpak, the teacher in that is telling all these students, pretend that you're cold\n\n01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:30.960\nand pretend that you're hot and pretend that you're this.\n\n01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:34.800\nAnd everyone else is doing it, and she thinks they're all lying.\n\n01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:39.800\nI think it's all bullshit, and when this guy that was a professional bullshit artist\n\n01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.920\ndies, it doesn't mean anything to her.\n\n01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:47.520\nHer identity had nothing to do with these weird tasks that she was asked to do.\n\n01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:50.160\nYeah, I took it as empowering too.\n\n01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:54.440\nShe didn't do this, but that she slammed the coffin, and she's like, now I'm an actor.\n\n01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:55.440\nKarpak off.\n\n01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.440\nWell, there's...\n\n01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:57.960\nI mean, if you think...\n\n01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:03.280\nThe job of acting is a psychotic job, whether it's an audience or cameras that are staring\n\n01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:08.920\nat you, you have to be equally conscious of the fact that you are faking something as\n\n01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:13.400\nyou are, because if you really believed you were an ice cream cone, you'd turn your back\n\n01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:18.840\nto the audience for the entire show, you wouldn't hit your marks, you wouldn't remember your\n\n01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:22.360\nice cream lines.\n\n01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:26.980\nThere's all kinds of reasons why you also simultaneously, in order to be so immersed\n\n01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:32.480\nin all this stuff, you also have to be so hyper-conscious of where your head is, or even\n\n01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:36.080\nmore so with the cameras instead of the audience.\n\n01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:39.720\nThat's the interesting thing I think about the lyrics of that song, is that it seems\n\n01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:43.760\nlike it's a writer exploring actually just kind of just two different acting schools\n\n01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:48.680\nand how they kind of crisscross their dichotomies, like can bisect each other to the point where\n\n01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:53.260\nyou go, oh yeah, okay, so you have to pick one that you're happy with, because hers turns\n\n01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:59.240\nout to be, you know what, I'm the person that's capable of forgetting what the fuck anybody\n\n01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:06.400\nthinks, and that could lead to really good acting, because my calluses, my barrier that\n\n01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:12.720\nI have around myself, whether I like it or not, will allow me to plow through a terrible\n\n01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:21.360\nshowing of Speed the Plow, even though there's three people in the audience, I don't know\n\n01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.680\nwhy I'm going into her biography of weird timeline, but I'm just saying there's different kinds\n\n01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:30.680\nof good actors, and she's confident at the time of singing that song, and what I'm\n\n01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:31.680\ntalking about.\n\n01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:34.400\nDrew, you said you had trouble sleeping yourself, right?\n\n01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.320\nYou have anxiety and that keeps you up?\n\n01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:37.320\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:42.600\nDoes you doing this podcast kind of busy up your day and occupy a part of your mind that\n\n01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:47.520\nallows you to rest, or do you still go to sleep with the same trouble that you're trying\n\n01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:49.520\nto assuage in other people?\n\n01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:54.400\nI think it makes me more aware, and I think the thing about the podcast is like, oh, that\n\n01:11:54.400 --> 01:12:00.120\nI'm not the only person suffering from that, so I mean, that's the main message I want\n\n01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:05.920\nto get across to the podcast, is like, okay, I'm not going to come to your house and read\n\n01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.320\nyou a story, or...\n\n01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:08.320\nTo steal your tarp.\n\n01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:09.320\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:18.680\nI've wrapped myself in the tarp, but that, like, not being able to sleep sucks, and since\n\n01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:23.520\nI can relate to that, I may not understand what other people are going through that can't\n\n01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:25.280\nsleep, but like that.\n\n01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:28.680\nYou've had people say to you that this really helps.\n\n01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:30.680\nThat must feel great.\n\n01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.680\nI'm dead inside, though, so it's kind of...\n\n01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:33.680\nOh, you feel nothing.\n\n01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:34.920\nYou feel nothing.\n\n01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:40.840\nBut it's almost like if you look at your emotional connection to them as like water, then this\n\n01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:44.000\nwould be like infusing it with like a fruit, a fruit flavor.\n\n01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.800\nOh, yeah, like fruit flavored water?\n\n01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:46.800\nYeah, like a...\n\n01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:47.800\nLike with a little fruit in there?\n\n01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:50.920\nIt's almost like a...\n\n01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:51.920\nIt sounds like you're talking about...\n\n01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:52.960\nIt sounds like a dream.\n\n01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:55.200\nIt sounds like you're talking about hint water.\n\n01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:56.200\nOh.\n\n01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:00.920\nOh, shit, that's something I have experience with personally.\n\n01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:03.280\nI had the apple flavored one.\n\n01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.280\nYou did?\n\n01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:05.280\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.280\nNo, it was great.\n\n01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:09.120\nSpencer, tell me about your personal experience with hint water, apple flavor.\n\n01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:11.640\nI had the apple flavored one.\n\n01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:13.560\nNo, seriously, it was great.\n\n01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:14.560\nI had it.\n\n01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:15.560\nThey sent it to us.\n\n01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:16.560\nIt tasted like apples.\n\n01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:17.560\nOh, boy.\n\n01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:20.920\nI had it.\n\n01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:22.880\nI had a watermelon one.\n\n01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:29.880\nIt's like watermelons, real fruit flavor, not this, you know, fake, preservative, unnatural\n\n01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:30.880\nflavor stuff.\n\n01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:34.640\nIt's not like water that's had like some syrupy goo added to it.\n\n01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:35.960\nNo, it tastes like...\n\n01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:39.640\nThat's actually the cool part, and this is a real advertisement because I'm trying to\n\n01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:45.880\nconvince you guys of something, but it actually is cool that it's like a fruit flavored beverage\n\n01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:52.600\nthat's not overbearing in any way, exactly as refreshing as water, but just has the\n\n01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:55.320\na lot of fruit.\n\n01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:56.320\nWasn't it?\n\n01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:02.080\nSpencer, I mean, I don't want to come off like I'm reading the highlighted portions\n\n01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:06.600\nof this piece of paper that I have here, but Spencer, it sounds like you just ad-libbed\n\n01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:11.360\nthe intro with the personalized story that will resonate with our audience.\n\n01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:15.440\nAnd I will add to that.\n\n01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:18.520\nI agree.\n\n01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:25.080\nWhen I tasted the hint water, I had got the distinct impression that it was invented by\n\n01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:28.320\na woman that had just had her fourth child.\n\n01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:29.320\nYou're talking about Cara Gold.\n\n01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:30.320\nCara Gold.\n\n01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:31.320\nYou're talking about Cara Gold.\n\n01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:32.320\nOf course.\n\n01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:33.320\nAnd not because I'm reading this off of the paper.\n\n01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:34.820\nNo, because she's the hint water person.\n\n01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:37.760\nI personally invested in her story.\n\n01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:42.920\nNot because they highlighted everything you have to say, and then it's at the following\n\n01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:47.560\npoints, and it includes her entire biography of having four children and then taking...\n\n01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:51.920\nShe got sick of diet soda because

time.\n\n01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:46.340\nScientists are working right now to find other planets that not only have liquid water, but\n\n01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:48.000\nhave liquid water with flavor.\n\n01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000\nFused with fruits.\n\n01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:54.900\nFused with fruits, because we found, there's so many planets right now that probably are\n\n01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:58.340\nin the Goldilocks zone where there would be liquid water, but we think because we live\n\n01:16:58.340 --> 01:17:03.940\nin such an infinite galaxy and universe that some of them are going to be blackberry flavored.\n\n01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:08.880\nAnd they have, they have actually found a lot of planets with flavored water, but they\n\n01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:13.680\nall contain preservatives or sugars, so it's like worthless.\n\n01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:14.680\nAnd calories.\n\n01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:15.680\nThe calories are crazy.\n\n01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:16.680\nIt's crazy.\n\n01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:17.680\nWhat's the point?\n\n01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:18.680\nYeah.\n\n01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:24.460\nBut until we have the ability to travel to these distant watermelon and pineapple flavored\n\n01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:25.460\nplanets.\n\n01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:26.460\nRight.\n\n01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:29.700\nYou can just go to, drink H-I-N-T.\n\n01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:30.900\nThey delivered your house.\n\n01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:34.860\nThey fucking bring in how heavy water is, you don't have to carry it.\n\n01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:37.420\nAll right, I think that's all the points.\n\n01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:41.620\nI actually, I actually heard they found a planet where it, what it did have no sugar\n\n01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:48.620\nand all that stuff, but also then they passed it by because it, it didn't offer the discount.\n\n01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:50.820\nOh yeah.\n\n01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:51.820\nThat you get when you.\n\n01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:52.820\nYeah.\n\n01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:53.820\nBecause it goes more than $24.\n\n01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:55.820\nNo, because that planet still charged $24.\n\n01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:59.140\n$24, which is not a bad price for, like, good water.\n\n01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:02.900\nYou go to drinkhint.com at Harmontown, you're, you're, you're saving.\n\n01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:03.900\nYou're

the, you're the Neil Armstrong of, of water excitement.\n\n01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:14.140\nWater's boring.\n\n01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:15.140\nNot anymore.\n\n01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:16.140\nHint

fucking straight up hit on water.\n\n01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:27.260\nThey're trying to take down big, big water.\n\n01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:31.780\nThey're just really biting the hand that feeds you when you're hint water.\n\n01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:32.780\nI mean, yeah.\n\n01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:39.300\nIf you look at the ingredients of hint water, a watermelon genetically is 99% water

really identical to, to sea water.\n\n01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:58.500\nIt's like a scuba tank that we brought with us.\n\n01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:02.420\nWe think, oh, you get stabbed in a Halloween movie and there's blood coming out.\n\n01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:03.420\nOh, that's gross.\n\n01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:04.420\nIt's just sea water.\n\n01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:05.420\nJoey.\n\n01:19:05.420

Drew?\n\n01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:43.380\nJoey.\n\n01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:44.420\nWell, I'm sorry.\n\n01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:45.420\nWhy?\n\n01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:52.400\nI mean, that one just hit home, like, because I was actually in, in a car with somebody\n\n01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:56.820\nlistening to that song and I'm like oh shit I feel nothing like and I was like\n\n01:19:56.820 --> 01:20:06.200\noh man like so it kind of cut deep I guess so if I said I love you I'd say\n\n01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:15.980\noh man I'm hungry like you semi-jungly said that you're you're you're you're\n\n01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:21.380\ndead inside that you have a numbness to you I mean is it true or is it just you\n\n01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:26.120\nkind of comedically deflecting stuff I would say it's an issue I have probably\n\n01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:32.960\nlike it's because you have a history of not you what you've noticed while you're\n\n01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:38.920\ntaking data is that the responses that you're capable of giving are are being\n\n01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:42.560\nreceived by other people you're getting you're getting returned data from them\n\n01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:49.960\nthat's saying that response was less than different than more than I expected\n\n01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:53.440\nand you are keeping score for yourself and you're going like yeah I'm not that\n\n01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:57.880\ngood at this people thing yeah I mean I think like with that not to go back to\n\n01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:02.400\nthe Halloween side but it's like oh is there a way Dan's supposed to reply to\n\n01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:07.360\nthat first text like and it's like and then you're like oh well should I I'm\n\n01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:11.760\ngonna I'm glad you just be yourself like yeah I just fucking went to just locked\n\n01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:17.880\nhorns with her like a fucking ram and then she's like twisting like oh shit\n\n01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:24.000\nwho's gonna win like but but yeah I just I well I just like it's this idea of\n\n01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.120\ndead inside like I don't know when we had Steve Silverman on who like we wrote\n\n01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:31.800\nthis amazing book called Neurotribes which is about neurodiversity doesn't\n\n01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:37.040\nhave to do with like oh you have Asperger's you are autistic you are in\n\n01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:41.640\nthe spec like like it's just like like like like can we embrace this concept of\n\n01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:48.000\nneurodiversity where there's it's like now that the internet's here and we're a\n\n01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.520\nmore text-based society what we're I think we're coming into a realization\n\n01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:59.880\nthat oh a lot of humanity doesn't necessarily have this like total average\n\n01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:03.280\nfacility there's almost artificial construct of normality when you run\n\n01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:07.240\ninto somebody in public and you oh you're learning their names and you have\n\n01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:12.040\nlike people trouble with names and faces and nervous and I don't know like I I\n\n01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:19.480\njust like it like like this idea I feel like the idea of being dead inside the\n\n01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:23.040\nidea that oh this person doesn't doesn't have empathy and all that stuff like it's\n\n01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:27.800\nit's like it's archaic language like it's it kind of it's it's problematic as\n\n01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:32.320\nthe kids would say like because it's it takes you into a zone of you're either\n\n01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:37.920\nChattner or your or your Leonard Nimoy like you're I don't know why I use the\n\n01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:44.160\nactors names yeah you're either Kirk or your spot like you're either like oh I'm\n\n01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:47.680\ngonna fly in through the windows and fuck a green lady and like like like that's\n\n01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:52.400\nhow I saw I saved the universe with my dick because I love feeling and that's\n\n01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:56.480\nand then or you're either that or your spot and like I don't understand and it's\n\n01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:01.360\nlike the whole like nerd face thing of like a spot you have feelings and stuff\n\n01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:05.040\nit's like come on what what what is a feeling what does it even mean like like\n\n01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:09.880\nyou at the end of your podcast you sit and thank a thousand people people\n\n01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:13.920\nanybody who tweets you you like people they're messaging you and going oh my\n\n01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:18.480\nband's playing and like you you you you sit there and like go go like oh you go\n\n01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:24.520\ngo see this guy's band and like all this shit you're pathetic you're a sappy\n\n01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:30.000\nsock it's a good thing I'm dead inside you're dripping in feelings like just\n\n01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.440\nlike just from a different angle you just have to get the glint like you're\n\n01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:37.600\nbecause it's a it's a it's a responsibility to other people I'm drunk\n\n01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:41.000\nyeah I think what you're like I get drunk at this point they think about the\n\n01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.160\ninternet is like that it gets all this like you're seeing with the neuro\n\n01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:49.680\ndiversity it's like oh wait like I'm not the only freak out there like I guess I\n\n01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:56.560\nwould classify myself as a spaz if we're in the Ferris Bueller spectrum of like\n\n01:23:56.560 --> 01:24:01.080\nthe social disorders but like then you realize like like I started the\n\n01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:04.280\npodcast and I was like huh I wonder if there's anybody out there that wants some\n\n01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:09.480\nweird-ass bedtime stories and then I was like oh wait there are and then it was\n\n01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:13.600\nlike then they then they started telling people and it's like I guess what\n\n01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:18.240\nyou're saying is like I can hear that because it's like oh yeah like who gives\n\n01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:22.200\nshit how like I can't respond perfectly to everything like yeah just because\n\n01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:25.320\nthat's not just because if somebody came over for a cup of sugar you wouldn't\n\n01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:28.600\nlike say the right thing isn't the right queue it doesn't mean you it's like no\n\n01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:31.560\nI'm fucking busy with my other thing that I connect with people through a\n\n01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:35.760\ndifferent channel like that's what a painter is or a furniture maker or what\n\n01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:40.040\ndo they call the guys that bring the mail a mail bringer\n\n01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:45.200\nyeah but I think those postal workers there's an expression going postal it\n\n01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:52.880\nmeans to to give your your feelings a different outlet yeah but like with the\n\n01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:57.560\ndichotomy thing like if you only can fit into these two boxes I think that's\n\n01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:00.720\nlike half the reason why everybody feels so alone I mean other than the shit you\n\n01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:04.400\nthink about when you're lying in bed like okay but but like then if you're like\n\n01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:08.920\noh wait like yeah there's a ton of other people that fit into this box with me or\n\n01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:12.040\nthe box doesn't have walls or whatever but then when you're like oh do you like\n\n01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:16.400\nthe guy with the bad hair like are you for America are you against America it's\n\n01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:23.200\nlike what the fuck like I'd like the idea that he was like I find myself alternating\n\n01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:27.680\nlike equally offended the idea that that he represents bad people and shit\n\n01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:31.720\nlike like because it's like fuck you he's a shitty bad person like he's bad at\n\n01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:35.920\nbeing shitty like I get mad I'm like he's a bad Nazi he's a bad fascist like\n\n01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:40.280\nlike Hitler would have done way better but that but by now like it's like he\n\n01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:43.000\ndoesn't even know what he's doing like you can't even do it right like you're\n\n01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.600\nbad Hitler I want to like tweet at him you're bad Hitler wrong you're a bad\n\n01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:52.680\nwrong yeah well such a nasty man\n\n01:25:52.680 --> 01:26:00.440\nnasty man such a nasty man but but the it's funny like the dichotomy thing\n\n01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:04.920\nthough I would have been a great Hitler I would have been great I have so many\n\n01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:09.720\npeople right now right now if you if you go on all the I would build a wall out\n\n01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:15.080\nof Jews Hitler I've killed more Jews I'm killing more Jews the Slavs would have\n\n01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:18.960\npaid for all of the Nazis say I'm the best they say I'm a better Nazi than a\n\n01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:24.080\nNazi yes I have all of the you're gonna do a great great Stalin grab would have\n\n01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:28.280\nfell to fall so fast your head would have spun it's gonna be true it's true\n\n01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:32.720\nbelieve it's true half Reich it's gonna be I would have so many rights there\n\n01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:40.520\nwould have been a million Reichs each Reich would have lasted for 10 million years\n\n01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:49.480\nwe're gonna be we're gonna invade China they have a great wall but the it's\n\n01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:54.200\nfunny how sometimes dichotomy you can't just count it either it's not as easy as\n\n01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:59.360\nsaying oh it's like gluten so let's do away with dichotomy we use it all the\n\n01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:03.240\ntime to get to the bottom of shit it's like well look let's step back from this\n\n01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:06.120\nand look at one of two paths here either we're gonna do this or we're gonna do\n\n01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:10.560\nthat it's such a healthy thing to do most half of the time probably half of\n\n01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:14.520\nthe time and then and then the probably half the time probably most of the time\n\n01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:19.800\nprobably the best times you're either building a wall and you're not building\n\n01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:24.440\nwall but but the the other half of the time it's like I was sitting there like\n\n01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:30.280\nI was watching Cody like crumbled to the floor during the debates and scream when\n\n01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:34.760\nhe said nasty woman like like when he at all of the things it's like it's like\n\n01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:40.880\nnails on a chalkboard then I'm noticing myself going like baby he's not gonna\n\n01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:46.760\nwin and then she goes like I know and then I'm thinking like oh well why are\n\n01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:52.120\nyou fucking being dramatic then and then and then later on she's like upset\n\n01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:55.320\nagain and I go like I thought you said you knew he wasn't gonna win and she's\n\n01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:58.720\nlike I just said that because you made me feel stupid earlier I'm like I wasn't\n\n01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:01.080\ntrying to make you feel stupid I was trying to make you feel safe I don't\n\n01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:05.040\nknow that he's not gonna win I'm just being a man I'm just being a man I was\n\n01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:09.000\nlike and it was like crazy meta thing like I was being a man I was trying to\n\n01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.240\nlike pat her on the back during the debates and tell her the orange man's\n\n01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:20.160\nnot gonna win like that's my job as a man during debates and it's like I was\n\n01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:23.160\nlike so you then you go outward on that Fibonacci curve and you go like well\n\n01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:33.400\nokay so like somewhere along it's just like well when he's not gonna win and\n\n01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:39.560\nand he can't win and and and that doesn't but and but here's the what do\n\n01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:45.440\nyou want a five-party system you got it you probably stay pretty apolitical\n\n01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:48.240\nalso what do you do about tonality that's what I was gonna ask you it's\n\n01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:53.280\ntough because you had you had you had to put a warning on your episode it was a\n\n01:28:53.280 --> 01:29:00.120\nhairpin turn man well hairpin turn next to the LeBray at Tarpet everyone\n\n01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:07.240\nvery everyone very values it bigly but you you had to put a little swear words\n\n01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:14.800\nwarning on your episode of mine what how do you how do you freely like just be\n\n01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:18.960\nyourself and then like where do you stand in terms of why aren't you just\n\n01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:25.280\nsaying shit and fucking yeah it's like like it's tough like not being able like\n\n01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:28.720\nit's like okay try to avoid talking about the election all because people are\n\n01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:32.120\ngonna go apeshit like it like I guess it's like keeping in mind somebody's\n\n01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:36.520\nlying in bed and like sometimes it's gonna be like a grandmotherly like woman\n\n01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:40.120\nand like I always that's why I like take so much time to kind of explain that the\n\n01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:43.720\npodcast is kind of weird because I always like think of this like this little\n\n01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:48.120\nold lady putting on like her shawl and putting on well she told me to listen to\n\n01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:54.080\nthe podcast and then it's like what the hell is he talking about like why is he\n\n01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:58.680\nlove abortion so much yeah I'm trying to get some sleep do you do a little like\n\n01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:02.720\nProviso at the beginning like you do like do an explainer at the top of each\n\n01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:06.640\nepisode or you kind of just get right into business it's kind of like there's\n\n01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:11.920\nlike this 12-minute intro at least where it's almost like its own show where I\n\n01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:16.680\njust like ramble on and on like okay this is the podcast but you sleep it's\n\n01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:21.800\nlike a like I was thinking about water the other day and and I was drinking a\n\n01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:25.800\nwater oh wait sorry I'm in the middle of podcast intro and then isn't water\n\n01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:34.040\ntoo boring I mean I was wishing I had like apple flavored water can we lower\n\n01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:37.720\nthe lights for a minute and just have you just like like relax and have you\n\n01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:42.840\njust treat us to the cadence that you usually use I just want to give people a\n\n01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:48.440\ntaste also everybody take your shirts off do we wait it's too late to ask for\n\n01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:51.120\nany like wind chimes back there anything you don't usually you don't use\n\n01:30:51.120 --> 01:31:00.280\nanything like that 30 seconds for wind chimes 29 28 well this brings up a good\n\n01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:05.080\nthing like with wind chimes it's like when you go to a wind chimes store do\n\n01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:09.800\nyou think about like what's your favorite bamboo wind chime what's your favorite\n\n01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:15.400\nwind chimes store in town I like wind chimes wind chimes wind chimes like I\n\n01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:19.480\ndon't know and then it's like you want a bigger small or the ones that are like a\n\n01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:22.720\nxylophone because then it's like well then when that person comes home they're\n\n01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:26.560\ngonna wrap running their hands across the stupid xylophone and it's gonna drive\n\n01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:32.040\nme nuts so maybe I'll just get the bam but I hate those bamboo wind chimes and\n\n01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:37.760\nlike like I try to lie there and think about yeah the wind chimes I used to\n\n01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:43.520\nhear when I was on that dock that one time like lying there on that dock the\n\n01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:50.760\ndock was bouncing up and down and I was staring at the clouds and I was just\n\n01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:55.200\nI was like man like those wind chimes are gonna wake my dad up he's gonna go\n\n01:31:55.200 --> 01:32:01.600\napeshit so I got off the dock and walked up to the house and I was walking up the\n\n01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:05.720\ndock and I stopped at the dock and then I looked in the water there was a fish\n\n01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:13.080\nthere and I was looking at the fish and I remember that time that guy was down\n\n01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:20.840\nthere at the bottom way down all the way down and then I was thinking like how\n\n01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:24.520\ndid he get on that spaceship that one time like because I was watching that\n\n01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:31.200\none where he's on the spaceship and his mask was different and like I was I was\n\n01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:36.840\nlike man like how do you get a new mask like is that like was that some kind of\n\n01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:42.880\ninterstellar shit like and then it was interstellar like what if what if he got\n\n01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:50.160\nsucked into a black hole and then and then he'd like and then my dad dropped\n\n01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:55.400\nhis beer in the back and I said oh shit better be quiet and not talk over these\n\n01:32:55.400 --> 01:33:03.200\nwind chimes but I was like I was thinking about like a guy was his name\n\n01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:06.400\nhis name like see this would be the pack as I couldn't say Freddie one for\n\n01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:13.280\nJason that's it Voorhees like if I've known any Voorhees before because\n\n01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:23.760\nVoorhees is a great Voorhees like Voorhees I started hearing things and then I\n\n01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:30.520\nstarted I started feeling angry like it was the wind chimes they kept going\n\n01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:35.760\nringing over and over I'm never going to sleep again\n\n01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:52.760\nThis is a nightmare. I never get to kill people. He usually works in a room.\n\n01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:59.360\nI just picture a lot of grandmother's just wide awake. This is this is the end.\n\n01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:03.600\nBut is there a guiding principle that keeps you from as you said when you\n\n01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:08.480\npicture that old woman with the shawl which which which which let's use here\n\n01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:11.640\nas a symbol of like that's a reason to not get political that's a reason to not\n\n01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:17.120\nuse profanity how is that what what compass do you is there like a guiding\n\n01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:22.040\nprinciple that keeps you clear of all of that no and like I find like using\n\n01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:26.160\nperfect like I guess I struggle with that because it's like I think some\n\n01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:30.840\npeople when you swear it makes them feel more connected like like this vanilla\n\n01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:36.680\nicing of everything like actually I think excludes people or me giving\n\n01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:40.560\neverything normalcy it's like oh my podcast is not normal like it's not\n\n01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:45.400\nlike it's like I struggle with like oh people like I can't believe you swore\n\n01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:49.160\nI'm never listening again and then I feel ashamed or whatever but then I'm\n\n01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:53.520\nlike well like I think there's four probably four thousand people that feel\n\n01:34:53.520 --> 01:35:00.160\nlike oh finally someone's swearing on a sleep so in your in your day-to-day life\n\n01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:04.960\nthe person that you are if I'm hanging out with you and how often are you\n\n01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:09.200\nsaying the word fuck shit and whatnot because I'm saying it every other word\n\n01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:14.720\nI mean probably pretty often like I mean so that's the confusing thing to me is\n\n01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:17.760\nthat you're being yourself like you're you're you're going to the you're going\n\n01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:21.800\ndown the mine that that I'm going down but you're somehow but you're kind of\n\n01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:25.960\nputting one drew more of like a like not not a character but you're going into a\n\n01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:31.280\ncertain mode where you're like you if you had to put on the hat Dan of let's\n\n01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:35.680\nmake everybody feel relaxed you wouldn't you know you would you have kids I have\n\n01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:39.400\none kid yeah and so is it possible that maybe you're accessing that lobe where\n\n01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:44.000\nyou're like she's listening or is it your daughter I think it's like part of\n\n01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:49.520\nit is like my internal critic is so loud and powerful and like so even when I\n\n01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:54.000\nsit down to record the show like there's that that narrative track going like\n\n01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:59.520\ndon't fuck this up like like like so it's like I try to like just get to this\n\n01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:04.120\nit's it unfortunately the podcast doesn't track like translate to my\n\n01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:08.720\nregular life where I can be like oh man go ahead and cut me off like like but\n\n01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:14.400\nlike so like to counteract my critic it's like I just it's the same part that\n\n01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:18.160\npeople fall asleep to I think because they're critic or that aggressive part\n\n01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:21.280\nof themselves is what's poking at them like as soon as you get in bed it's like\n\n01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:25.360\nwhy didn't you get this done today why why why did you piss your pants like you\n\n01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:30.280\nknow it's like and then you're like like like the person starts to like buy\n\n01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:33.600\ninto that story and they just start listening at story so it's like I'm\n\n01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:36.640\nthere and I'm like well here's another story you can listen to it doesn't\n\n01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:39.880\nreally make a lot of sense it doesn't really go anywhere and I think like at\n\n01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:43.120\nthe same time I'm like trying to tell I'm like listen dude we're just making a\n\n01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:47.000\npodcast put people asleep here like this isn't like a fourth draft to something\n\n01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:51.960\nlike when I asked you when I said earlier that must make you feel good that\n\n01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:55.320\nyou help people deal with their insomnia or go to sleep when you said no I feel\n\n01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:58.240\nnothing but like do you feel like this is a benevolent thing you're doing or\n\n01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:02.040\nnot not why you're doing it is it's more just you getting something off of your\n\n01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:05.920\nchest or do you how important is it that you might be helping other strangers up\n\n01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:10.520\nI mean it could be impact unpacked by like psychologists like I think part of\n\n01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:15.880\nit is like really narcissistic like that when I was a kid I couldn't sleep and I\n\n01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:20.520\nlied there in bed miserable and I didn't feel like I was like alright you're on\n\n01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:25.320\nyour own to deal with this and I can't go back in time to fix that you know so I\n\n01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:29.040\nthink like if like a cold-ass psychiatrist would be like oh well\n\n01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:33.080\nthat's just what you're trying to do just trying to go back but I guess like it\n\n01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:38.040\nis cool like if I hear from somebody like that has like PTSD like from some\n\n01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:41.000\nsomething that happened I guess I do feel stuff sometimes like it's like holy\n\n01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:46.320\nshit like this silly thing I'm doing can help distract you from something that's\n\n01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:50.600\nhorrific or does that warm you up a little bit like how do you\n\n01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:56.040\nabsorb that that compliment or do you just stick it in the drawer somewhere and\n\n01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:59.000\nthink deal up deal with it later yeah I guess I try to put it in like this\n\n01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:05.400\nbasket of like okay this this is this is this real like am I really helping\n\n01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:08.720\npeople I was just putting it in a bin that's like okay so that's like a\n\n01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:13.320\nfirewood pile like called I won't get kicked out of society for that amount\n\n01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:18.800\nof time yeah every time someone writes and says like I you helped because this\n\n01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:22.760\nfeely feely thing and then I got like a good so you'll have my back when they're\n\n01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:28.040\nabout to throw me off a cliff it is really weird like like from Harmontown\n\n01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:31.800\nand from like like doing other comedy shows like who's lying like people walk\n\n01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:36.120\nup and they say hey like it's really common like strangely common that people\n\n01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:39.760\ncome up and say like you helped me through a really hard time like I was\n\n01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:44.640\nsick or I was in hospital or my mother was going through a thing like and\n\n01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:48.520\npeople have they like these really intense connections to the stupid thing\n\n01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:51.480\nthat we're like I mean and not that this is stupid but it is stupid like we're\n\n01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:55.040\njust words it's irresponsible and we don't think about it we just show up\n\n01:38:55.040 --> 01:39:00.240\nhalf drunk and do this thing but but people like have these weird connections\n\n01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:04.120\nto it and when they say you really helped me through some major shit and my\n\n01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:09.280\ninstinct is to go you gotta get out more like and deflect that but really\n\n01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:14.560\nthat's like that's a major thing to unload but it's also it also doesn't\n\n01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:19.800\nyou can't like translate it in anything that starts with your value like I\n\n01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:25.080\nalways I've come to look at it like if you were in a pool and people are just\n\n01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:30.160\ngrabbing you that's a bad example because someone's gonna drown but but like if\n\n01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:33.640\nyou're in the dark or everyone's on ecstasy it's a confusing party you're\n\n01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:38.620\nin a hey maze or something like somebody somebody grabbing you and saying I'm so\n\n01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:45.000\nglad you're here I'm so glad I ran into you I remember you from before by the\n\n01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:50.120\nentrance to the hey maze and and I was with my girlfriend I don't know if you\n\n01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:55.080\nremember her but I lost her and like I just seeing you like reminds me but I\n\n01:39:55.080 --> 01:40:01.120\ndo you kind of like you you were like oh so we are catchers in the ride I didn't\n\n01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:06.480\nread the book I tried to make this I just I got a hundred on the test and\n\n01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:10.680\nit's just like click on alienation yeah I got it but but but I think it's\n\n01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:14.400\nsomething about that like it's like like like like you're running into each\n\n01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:19.600\nother and people are expressing that like it's not it's not oh you're you did\n\n01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:23.520\nsomething good you like your snake oil is better than other snake oil it's like\n\n01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:28.080\noh when you put yourself out there when you get onto the dance floor even if\n\n01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:33.560\nyou're doing a silly dance even if you're that sooner or later you get to\n\n01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:38.280\nexperience the sensation of dancing with other people that they will have\n\n01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:43.120\nsomeone will go yay I like I like you're I'm so glad you're out here because\n\n01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:47.920\nthese weddings suck yeah I mean I think it's like the other thing I mean it\n\n01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:51.360\nmakes me think of two things one is like also connects you like you're like well\n\n01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:54.000\nshit I know what it's like to lie there I might not know what it's like to have\n\n01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:01.080\nPTSD but I know what it's like to lie there over you will now yeah like I\n\n01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:08.760\npeteed him but all right I you tea tea you pre-teed him TB TB you pre-teed his\n\n01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:13.080\nSD all right TB TB teed we'll figure it out later but I mean the other thing is\n\n01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:16.400\npeople don't get credit for being nice like it's like all the people that say\n\n01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:20.320\nthank you for shit like everybody's always heaping on and I mean I guess I'm a\n\n01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:24.160\ncynical person too but it's like I've been blown away like you're saying that\n\n01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:29.760\npeople will come up to like that people are thankful like it's like no no when\n\n01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:36.520\nwe look at all this election shit and like oh how do you think about her like\n\n01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:40.240\nit's like oh wait there's tons of people out there and they might even be people\n\n01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:45.160\nthat believe in the crazy like the other stuff but it's like that are saying like\n\n01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:51.760\nthank you like I don't know it is definitely like making the show has made\n\n01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:56.240\nme maybe like a softer person or been like man there is some good in the world\n\n01:41:56.240 --> 01:42:01.360\ndespite like like presuming there isn't or whatever I don't know when you do one\n\n01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:06.160\ndo you have that kind of sense of like some sort of sense of accomplishment or\n\n01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:10.440\njust or just or is it simply just like oh I did one thing today that was semi or\n\n01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:14.800\npossibly productive and so like I can rest a little easier it's more like I\n\n01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:21.240\nguess if I have like one out of every 30 episodes or 40 episodes and I like I\n\n01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:26.920\nfeel like like damn that came out good even if it's not good like I don't know\n\n01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:31.200\nlike once every 40 episodes I'll have one done I'll be like oh like that felt\n\n01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:35.080\nreally good like and I don't care like I can make it another 40 episodes I'm\n\n01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:40.800\ncurious though because like I get so I'm so into detail like almost to the point\n\n01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:43.720\nof distraction that I don't know that I would fall asleep I think that I was\n\n01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:48.480\nlike where's he going this or even if you're not anywhere that's okay like\n\n01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:51.480\nthat's I think that's part of the interesting thing is that as we said\n\n01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:57.040\nthe beginning if a doctor tells you to chew on a straw like the straw chewing\n\n01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:01.080\nis just gonna it sends you into this weird thing and like he's like hey\n\n01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:06.440\nlisten by the way if you also if you find yourself very focused on what I'm\n\n01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:09.520\nsaying you know that's okay too you're not doing it wrong you may fall asleep\n\n01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:15.640\nto something else Joey are you a good sleeper are you are you a oh yes I I\n\n01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:19.280\nsleep all the time\n\n01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:28.600\nthere's the best well I think if we can pack both into five minutes each I would\n\n01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:33.080\nsay one thing I would like to try is Joey could you give us a tarot reading\n\n01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:39.400\nfor next week's episode I guess do you ever do you ever do you do am I abusing\n\n01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:45.720\nyou by asking you to pre-cog like is that no I'm sure that the spirits are\n\n01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:55.920\nwilling you know so good with with spirits here's a cynical question Joey\n\n01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:59.680\nwhile you're going through that yeah your positivity which you seem to exude\n\n01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:09.760\noh thank you I knew you're gonna say that it's not an act at all now I'm\n\n01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:14.800\nbeing dichotomy guy like this is like you're not pushing down some other\n\n01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:19.920\nlike rage part of yourself or are you actually this this groovy like for real\n\n01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:31.760\noh I'm a I'm a good Mormon boy that's that's a thing right the Mormons I went\n\n01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:34.120\nto high school with with the coolest like they were like they seemed to be the\n\n01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:40.240\nmost well adjusted like they like their families and shit no yeah that's that's\n\n01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:44.720\ndefinitely part of it and there are a couple weird ones yeah well no\n\n01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:54.200\ndefinitely there are the weird ones so so being being nice is is a virtue but\n\n01:44:54.200 --> 01:45:04.480\nbeing someone who likes people is a gift and so if you like people it's easy to\n\n01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:12.400\nbe nice yeah there you are but liking people is a skill oh well because I\n\n01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:17.440\nlike people I like strangers but also I can be really misanthropic like like\n\n01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:21.520\nlike the flip of a coin like like like people can be like when I'm driving\n\n01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:25.240\neveryone's an enemy and then but then I could be at the airport and just be in\n\n01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:30.520\ncertain mood where I'm very philanthropic and really into everybody but do you go\n\n01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:33.240\nthrough that too are you are you do you have you mastered a skill where you can\n\n01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:49.400\nlike your equanimous to just all things at all times well cannabis helps I want\n\n01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:55.360\nyou to have a podcast because your voice is soothing as fuck we have the\n\n01:45:55.360 --> 01:46:01.800\npulpit it's just a you know something we're doing in Utah we've had like 20\n\n01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:06.520\nepisodes and and we're so excited to have earth shine Jane on this oh yeah so\n\n01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:14.520\nwe we get into all kinds of fun little esoteric things that may inadvertently\n\n01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:21.000\nput people to sleep but we would encourage anybody to just keep a dream\n\n01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:25.320\njournal about what they dream about after they listen to the podcast because we\n\n01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:29.600\nneed as many insights as possible because we're trying to predict to the end\n\n01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:40.040\nof the world and and hence the tarot and I don't really have a a trained use of\n\n01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:46.120\nthese cards but oh good okay yeah that's that's the last thing we would have\n\n01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:56.320\nwanted just gets in the way of the way the education the educational\n\n01:46:56.320 --> 01:47:01.400\ninhibit the genius that's that's that's exactly so we'll let them fall where they\n\n01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:03.880\nmay\n\n01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:12.040\nare you on the floor yeah they just kind of stayed in a pile so we'll choose that\n\n01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:16.880\nindicates well see now if you hadn't told me I would have thought you'd\n\n01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:30.280\nstudied this your whole life so and you had asked me earlier about the creator\n\n01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:42.160\nof hint water and once again that's Kara golden yes yes so the card that came\n\n01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:49.400\nup is queen of cups so compliment nice to your car and get that hint water\n\n01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:54.560\nportion that's right so you're probably gonna mention hint water again is what\n\n01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:59.280\nthe cards are saying that's that's what I'm getting oh really yes and it looks\n\n01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:06.840\nlike the past life of Kara golden is Pamela Goldman Smith the creator of the\n\n01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:23.520\ntarot deck because I think I forgot to take this part out then your card is\n\n01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:30.360\nJoker my card is Hoyle's rules of poker right show has just become in a good way\n\n01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:35.760\nit's just become Carson we're just a guy with a lizard's coming out next to\n\n01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:46.800\nJoan Embry is gonna come out or a lady with a lizard nice save you can you're\n\n01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:51.160\ngetting so good at these thank you after thoughts yes these I call them cap\n\n01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:57.560\ndoffers I'm learning now our president's gonna be a space lady and I'm\n\n01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:01.800\ngonna I'm gonna I'm gonna add or maybe it's a lady yet to the end of every\n\n01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:07.080\nexpression I guess all right well so then I guess the last thing to do is to\n\n01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:13.480\ntry to do if we can possibly accomplish it what we do is like a sleep a sleepy\n\n01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:19.640\nrap and then but then the bridge is like and then if we can is there any way to\n\n01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:25.800\ngo from the rap beat to then the and then the wind chime silence and let and\n\n01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:32.160\nlet and let drew just feel like so I go so I do some rapping and then and then I\n\n01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:37.040\nand then it goes into wind chimes and and drew like talks for a little
