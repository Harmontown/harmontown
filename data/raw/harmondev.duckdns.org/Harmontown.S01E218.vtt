00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Welcome to Hollywood, California, everybody.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
Harmontown is now in session.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
The meltdown show is gone, but Harmontown persists.

00:20.000 --> 00:34.000
Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden then everybody.

00:34.000 --> 00:41.000
And the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
Okay, you know, there's warm-up and then there's show-stealing.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
You know, you might want to just cool it down a little bit.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
What are you afraid of, Dan?

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Are you afraid that I will overshadow you with my pre-show antics?

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Yeah, because they involve, like, exercise and stuff.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
What am I supposed to do?

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
That's why I do it pre-shows that you don't have to get in a lather.

01:10.000 --> 01:18.000
Well, yeah, but then it's like job of the hut following Luke Skywalker.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Did you see me chop that cigarette in half with a whip?

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
Yeah, you used the force. I'm so proud of you.

01:25.000 --> 01:33.000
You should have your own trilogy of movies, and I should just be a big fat thing at the beginning of the worst one.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
We get it.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
Are you going to freeze me in carbonite? Just to be a dick?

01:39.000 --> 01:49.000
And to create 40 years of awkward soaps and chocolates.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Wait, there's Han Solo frozen chocolates?

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
Oh, yeah, man. I shouldn't say awkward because I love them.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
I have carbonite Han Solo ice trays.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
Like little rubber things that you can put. You can have Han Solo frozen and carbonite ice in your drink.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
They melt so fast because of his little fingers.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
It's not ideal, but there's soaps and chocolates and stuff.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
Yeah, soap's the way to go because you can just leave it out in ornamental Han Solo soap.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
Han Sopo.

02:23.000 --> 02:37.000
You guys heard the name Katie May, the unfortunate model actor, and they just found out that she died mysteriously, but they traced it to...

02:37.000 --> 02:45.000
She went to the chiropractor. This is just my fucking... I'm not to make her tragedy about me, but I was like...

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
But if you did, it would go a little something.

02:48.000 --> 02:56.000
She went to the chiropractor and he just like adjusted her to the point where then she went home and just without realizing it kind of slowly died.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
It pinched something that she must have just...

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
And it was like, it sounds like an urban legend, but she just like went home and was like just laying there and must have been...

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
I mean, we don't know what happened in her final hours, but the cause of death was...

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
I've never gone to the chiropractor again.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
My girlfriend has like stiff neck issues and she always asks me to crack her back. Am I going to kill her one day by doing it?

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I mean, I'm still...

03:22.000 --> 03:29.000
Okay. So just another thing to worry about. Just keep playing video games and just like...

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
Let's convince her that it's really dangerous so I never have to do it again.

03:33.000 --> 03:42.000
Speaking of safety, now this is the reason why in the months ahead I'm struggling very hard to create a Graham Norton feedback loop.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
I want the show to evolve to the point where you people...

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
What do you mean you people?

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
You white people can...

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Is what I usually mean.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
Can see what the people on the stream are seeing so that you know...

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
I'm not saying the goal is to become a real TV show for God's sake.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
I mean, no, that'd be terrible.

04:05.000 --> 04:12.000
But I'm just saying you'll have a lot more fun because I can show you this Instagram of this lady.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
Maybe you've seen it. This is a beautiful woman. A beautiful specimen of humanity.

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
I don't mean physics. Well, now what am I doing saying she's ugly?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Not my first choice.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
I'm using beautiful in a spiritual way.

04:29.000 --> 04:38.000
I'm saying this is amazing. Somebody took on a plane of a woman at Kelly Oxford re-Instagram.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
I don't know where this source is from, but it's this woman and she's sitting on an airplane.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
She's got the neck pillow so her head's propped up. She's sound asleep and clipped to the neck pillow.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
It looks like a neck brace. It's almost like she has whiplash.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
It's like one of those pillows. It's just holding her head perfectly still.

04:55.000 --> 05:08.000
Clipped to the neck pillow is a laminated card, like a pristine type of graphically graceful.

05:08.000 --> 05:14.000
It's like the letting is perfect, like the kerning everything.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
And it's laminated and it has a little clip on it. It clips right to her neck pillow.

05:19.000 --> 05:25.000
And I don't want to make sure I get it right because she's a woman of exactitude who is...

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Fuck, fuck, fuck, where is it? Where is it? Oh, here it is.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
It says, please wake me for snacks and drinks. Thank you.

05:33.000 --> 05:49.000
It was amazing to me because the caption that sums up your visceral reaction immediately is from the...

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
There was some person responded immediately with like, this bitch is my hero.

05:54.000 --> 06:04.000
Which kind of sums up the dichotomy because it's kind of like you're jolted by her having demands and entitlement and all this stuff.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
But she's managing all of it.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
But that says so many things. She travels a lot first off.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
And she also likes to get her little disease on the plane.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
But also, don't call her late for dinner.

06:18.000 --> 06:26.000
It's kind of amazing because you're so used to the dichotomy being, oh, there's people who are Zen who are in the moment.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
And those are the good people and there's the uptight, schedule-based people and those are the bad people.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
But no, nothing's ever that simple. This is a person who clearly...

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
She plans her shit out. She has foresight.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
But she's also at the same time kind of a life master.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
There's a lot of Zen people who are so fucking irritated.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
Because they just use Zen as an excuse to be flaky and fuck up your day, right?

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
I bet she's a really considerate house guest.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
There's probably a really good chance that she's not...

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
She would leave you a note and probably give you a nice little gift when she left you twice.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
Yeah, she probably does her own dishes and all that shit.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
It's just something about that because it's not like a shitty marker thing.

07:07.000 --> 07:16.000
And also, she's like, again, please, comma, wake me for snacks, ampersand drinks. She's an ampersand exclamation point.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Thank you, exclamation point.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
I like that you started off by saying letting and kerning, by the way.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
That shows off your...

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
But it's just like she used it. It's not...

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
It's center-justified.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
It's not left-justified, but it's also not like shitty, like fucking like...

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Can I see the photo?

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
I don't know that I have it. I don't have it off hand. I just like...

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
I'll check it down.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
But like six months from now, I'll go zap, and it'll be on the thing, and America will be like,

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
yay, and then she'll be like, you owe me money, and then we'll...

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
And then CBS will be like, we'd like to buy you, and then we'll be like, yay,

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
and they'll be like, but she can't say anything bad about Jim Belushi.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
What could you possibly say bad about Jim Belushi,

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
except for the fact that he pissed on the olive jar at the craft service in front of his costars?

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
I overheard a guy at dinner tonight who was...

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
I don't know if I can do this justice, but it was like...

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
There was a couple over at the other dinner table that we were eavesdropping on,

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
and the guy was going like, he goes like, no, it's extreme pilates.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
You know, I've been doing Wonder Bar...

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
She goes like, no, you know, I've been doing Wonder Bar for about three years,

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
and he goes like, well, yeah, but no, you've been doing this other thing,

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
and he was correcting her, and he's like, honey, I mean, no.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
I'm telling you what you were doing was sitting upright in bed doing these things,

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
and he's explaining to her, and then he goes like, I mean, now it's hard...

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
I'm telling you, now, they have one down the street, and I mean, now it's hard court.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
Now it's a legitimate workout. I mean, before it was gay.

08:51.000 --> 08:57.000
And then there was a pause, and then I heard him very quietly go like, I shouldn't say gay.

08:57.000 --> 09:03.000
And I was like, well, either you should, either you're fine.

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
I don't think anyone was going to come over to the table and go, excuse me, that's really offensive.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
You know what I mean? Because you sound super gay.

09:14.000 --> 09:24.000
And it made me think, like, is that when gay people...

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Go on, Dan.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I forgot what they were.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
You're doing great. You're doing great.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
Humans, when gay folk...

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
That pause was me trying to, like, do I want to get specific gay men?

09:43.000 --> 09:51.000
When gay people, do they, in conversations with loved ones and or each other,

09:51.000 --> 09:57.000
do they police each other on the use of gay to be a derogate, to be, like, kind of, like, using it?

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
You know, I don't know.

09:59.000 --> 10:04.000
And also, like, this guy, I also took that to mean, I was like, oh, this guy, he's straight.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
But, like, boys, he's got a...

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
He's worrying about something he does not have to worry about.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
Because he's, like, ostensibly the reason you're, like, backpedaling on that is, like, oh, I shouldn't say gay.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
Like, the unspoken part of that is, I shouldn't say that because someone...

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
It's the wrong idea.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Someone walking around here might get offended.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
They might, like, and it's like, no one's going to get offended.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
You sound gayer than the Statue of Liberty.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Okay.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Like, everyone would just be like...

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
One of the most famous gay icons.

10:38.000 --> 10:45.000
Like, Nathan Lane could be walking his seven Chihuahuas by and overhear you and he'd say,

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
way to take it back.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
You know, that's how it's done.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Like, you have nothing to worry about, sir.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
Man, eating the arugula salad at little Dom's.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
Did you just out the Statue of Liberty?

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Come on.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
She's looking at her.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Come on.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
She's always hanging out with the Staten Island fairy.

11:05.000 --> 11:12.000
Hello, hello, hello, joke from 1983.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
She's French.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
She's carrying a book.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Yeah.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
She's holding a torch for some fucking lady.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Yeah.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
For some chick.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
All right.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
So I think that's enough.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
That's enough of my business.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
Our guest tonight is another podcasting hero.

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
The reason I'm familiar with this podcast, I just became familiar with it is because

11:40.000 --> 11:47.000
my girlfriend Cody, her mom, Randy, mama LaRusso from Karate Kid.

11:47.000 --> 11:53.000
His girlfriend's mom is the mom from Karate Kid.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
That's never going to stop being the coolest fucking thing I've ever heard of.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
She also played Rizzo on Broadway in Grease.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Yeah.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
She's a fucking...

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
But she'll always be mama LaRusso to me.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
But a lot of people actually...

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
She was on Mad Men as the...

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
I can't remember the character's name, but she was just...

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Whatever.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
It doesn't matter.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
It's not about her.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
You haven't even said hi to Spencer.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
You're going to bring in a guest and you haven't even addressed Spencer over.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Yeah.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Don't...

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
You know the tradition of addressing Spencer before you bring out the guest.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Yeah.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
It's bad luck.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
It's a severe...

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Spencer, how are you?

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Oh, I'm so good, you guys.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
I know he's just using this as a time to pour himself a drink.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Oh, man.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Wow.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Nimble is a mountain goat.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Oh.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
It's in the way that she uses.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Hey.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Oh.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Woo.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Woo.

12:45.000 --> 13:04.000
Dude.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
That's a real weapon.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Yeah, those...

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Oh.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
What is happening?

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
People are wielding things.

13:11.000 --> 13:19.000
It looks like a...

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
What are we looking at precisely here?

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
That is horrifying.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Exactly.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
Eli Roth is here tonight with a prop from his next movie.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Do you want to try it?

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
No.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
No.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Come on.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Let's not devolve.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
No.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
What is this?

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Let's just keep it.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
This is my scepter.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
It's a weird...

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
What is it made of?

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
It looks like it's wax.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Is this wax?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
It's a...

13:53.000 --> 14:01.000
It's an elm stick from Sedona covered in wax from my house.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Would you like to come up here?

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Yes.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
One second.

14:05.000 --> 14:22.000
I've got scepter questions.

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
What in the Joshua Tree is going down?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
This is...

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
The audience is in an uproar right now.

14:30.000 --> 14:36.000
For the listener who's not live streaming this one, you're wearing...

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
Is it like a bathrobe?

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
What do you have on it?

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
I prefer to call it my prophetic mantle.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Prophetic mantle?

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Yes.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
That's what I prefer to call it from now on.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
I love that.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Do you have a smart satchel with you?

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Kind of a tote?

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
A bit of a Masonic apron bag.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
And you have Mork and Mindy headband on?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
That's right.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
It says gay in the back.

15:04.000 --> 15:10.000
It says gay in the back, but business is in front.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
It's an election thing.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
I'm with her.

15:14.000 --> 15:21.000
Gay in the back, voting lever in the front.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
What's your name?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Joey.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Joey.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
And you're from...

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Sovo.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Wait, is this...

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Provo, Utah.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Provo, Utah.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Yep.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
Are you just visiting California?

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Yes.

15:35.000 --> 15:42.000
I have my brother and his partner, spouse, and yeah, we're visiting.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Okay.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Well, you guys all came together.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
You're not visiting them.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
That's right.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
From Utah.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
What are you doing, what else are you doing?

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
In Utah, I promote myself as the reincarnation of Joseph Smith.

15:54.000 --> 16:03.000
Which has a built-in audience there.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
And you just do what you...

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Wait, but that didn't answer my...

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
No.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Is that what you're doing here?

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Are you kind of on a pilgrimage?

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
A mission?

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Right.

16:13.000 --> 16:19.000
Well, so I was here on the 200th episode recording of your podcast, and it was amazing.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
And I don't know...

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Thank you.

16:21.000 --> 16:27.000
It was after the show, so I don't know if you remember, but I actually gave you a hat that

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
my brother and his spouse and I actually stenciled the name...

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Ernest Hemingway.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
That's right.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
I have that in my closet.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Oh, yeah.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
And I regularly look at it and go, what the fuck is that?

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Yes.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
I was just...

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Cody just...

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
And I were just looking at that.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
And she said, it's cool.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
She was about to wear it, and I was like, don't wear that.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
What is that?

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
No.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
There's another hat for her.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Yeah.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
But I also gave one to Spencer, and it said...

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Oh, yeah.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
Waldo Pierce, and then you got one that said Ezra Pound.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Yes.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
Yes.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
So I just...

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
You had been talking...

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
How did we all forget you?

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
Most only in Los Angeles.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Pacific prison in the world.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
Gotta work harder than this, folks.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Good luck.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
I'll do what I can.

17:18.000 --> 17:24.000
I've run into so many guys wearing daycoats that pretend to be Mormon's prophets.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
Well, the truth is, he does kind of blend around here, and that's a good thing, not a bad thing.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Yeah.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Bad thing for your publicist, good thing for society.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Yeah.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
It definitely stands out in Provo, not so much in LA.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
What do you got in your Masonic satchel there?

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
What do you have there?

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
Well, this is a medic droid for my nephew.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Okay.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Is that what, IG-88?

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
What is it?

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
What do you say, medic droid?

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
That's the only one I remember.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
I don't remember.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Oh, yeah, that's some new crap.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
He's like a no-face.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
And...

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
I mean, I want to see some shamanic shit in there.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
I want to see, like, you have some sort of rune stones or something.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
What the...

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Oh.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Oh, shit.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Okay.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Put that away.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Put that away.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Yeah.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
All right.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
Well, we also have our guest that I was...

18:11.000 --> 18:18.000
Who must have the guest equivalent of Blue Balls right now.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
We can handle...

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I think Joey can...

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
You want to linger for a bit, Joey?

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Sure.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Yeah, just...

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
I like your style, man.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
I like your style, man.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
Joey, you remind me of early Harmontown days when we would...

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
We kept just discovering, like, Levi's and...

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Right.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
And people, like, we had BJ Avril.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
We had these great cast of gréviness.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Well, I'm a...

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
I'm a Facebook friend of Earthshine Jane.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
I'm drinking out of her glass right now.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
There you go.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Yeah.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
And we're going to be interviewing her on our own podcast, The Pulpit, in a few days

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
when she visits Utah.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
All right.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Now, when you say that you're...

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
That you...

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
You bill yourself as the reincarnation of Joseph Smith.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Is that for real?

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
Like, you actually go around, like, spread in the good word of the letter?

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
That's very real.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Yes.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Yeah.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Well, so...

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
And not to...

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
Not to frustrate your distinguished guests any longer, but...

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
He is extinguished at this point.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
That's the problem now.

19:19.000 --> 19:24.000
But I do circulate the past lives of certain individuals.

19:24.000 --> 19:34.000
So, you three individuals were friends during the lifetime of Waldo Pierce as a pound Ernest Hemingway.

19:34.000 --> 19:41.000
And we're part of that lost generation that kind of, you know, went to France and had some fun.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
And you killed yourself.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
So...

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Spoilers!

19:45.000 --> 19:50.000
That was after...

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
And you had wanted to know a lot about the simulation during the 200th episode.

19:55.000 --> 20:04.000
So, that's why I went to kind of let you know how the data conservation works in this simulation.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Where we just recycle your...

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Oh, it's using...

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Yeah, that would make sense.

20:08.000 --> 20:13.000
Like, in video games, it's like, oh, that's clearly that other character with a hat.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
That's right.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
It's like, yeah, that makes sense.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Of course.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
All right.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Joey, how many times have you been to Harmontown?

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Just twice now?

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
This is the second.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
The first time was he...

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
He gave us warnings we did not heed.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
But now he's back to wonder why...

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
Now he has a fantastical rainbow schlong stick, which is really good.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
I'm pretty sure if you drop this, it turns into a snake, right?

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
A waxy, a waxy, creepy snake.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
Just to be clear, you said, you said this is a stick from your home...

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
From your home?

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
No, not from your home.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
It's a doma.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
It's a doma.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Arizona.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Arizona.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Don't forget Sedona.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Land of Sticks.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
No, don't forget Winona.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
And wax from your house.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
That's right.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
All right.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Wait.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
So you have your own wax supply at home?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
I do.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
All right.

21:11.000 --> 21:16.000
Well, so anyways, so this amazing podcast that we started listening to, to help put us to sleep,

21:16.000 --> 21:21.000
the conceit of the podcast is a sincere attempt to put you to sleep.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
It's for insomniacs.

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
It claims on the surface, but it's endlessly entertaining as well.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
There's no wrong way to use it.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
He goes into all that stuff.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
It's very, very smart, amazing guy.

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
Please listen to his podcast, Sleep With Me, if you haven't already after this.

21:38.000 --> 21:55.000
But let's get to know our new friend, Drew Ackerman.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Yeah.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Okay.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
That's nice.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
All right.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
Good move.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Hello, Drew.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Drew, meet Joey.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Hi.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Hey, what's up?

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Do you have any past life info on me?

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
Do I want to know?

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Tarot cards.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
I'll work on that.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Okay, great.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Oh, shit.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Wait, I said you have shamanic shit.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
You're hiding tarot cards in your satchel?

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Are you going to do a reading right now?

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
Well, no, I'll just be doing it.

22:22.000 --> 22:28.000
Yeah, do a little background tarot on this and whenever you feel like something significant pops up.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
That's right.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Okay.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
All right.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Right there on the floor.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
All right.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
Fine.

22:35.000 --> 22:40.000
Can you let me know when, you know, wait, you already did let me know?

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Does that mean she's here?

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Yeah, she's here.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Oh, she's here.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Okay.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Well, she's on the schedule too.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Let's hear from Drew.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Thanks for coming, Drew.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Thank you.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Would you mind terribly?

22:49.000 --> 22:55.000
I'll do this Halloween intervention right now.

22:55.000 --> 23:01.000
Doing the, because I begged her to come down and she's, she had food simmering on the stove.

23:01.000 --> 23:07.000
I just want to bring her out to go over a little kerfuffle we had in text.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
You remember our friend, my neighbor, Beth Bootson.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Bootson?

23:11.000 --> 23:19.000
Bootson, pantson, bootson, pantson, bootson, pantson, bootson, pantson, bootson, pantson, bootson, pantson, bootson, pantson, bootson, pantson.

23:19.000 --> 23:25.000
Bootson!

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
All right.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
This show is a.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
This show is a cavalcade of stars.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
Lay that staff across there.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
All right, Beth.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Thank you so much for coming down.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
I know it was like, I, you know, you, you sped out of your house.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
I invited you last minute because I thought, well, geez, we had this thing.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
It was a flare up.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
It was a neighborly flare up.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
All right.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
And I'm scrolling back in our conversation.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Okay.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
And it's easy because you marked it with that photo.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
All right.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
So Beth, as you know, she came on the show with her son Timmer.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Yeah.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Who was doing the haunted house.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
And then Timmer, the son came on again last week.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
With spooky, spooky one direction.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Haunted house with his friends.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Yes.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Yes.

24:12.000 --> 24:18.000
So the following day, Monday, 10, 11 a.m., I get, so what do we want to do?

24:18.000 --> 24:25.000
Do we want to, do we, last time we, I read your parts and you read my parts, but maybe,

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
why don't we just.

24:26.000 --> 24:32.000
You know what, I think it's actually, based on all your language, maybe it's better if

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
you just read your own.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
I'll read my own.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
All right.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Beth, I can't see.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Are you on a mic?

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
You have a microphone?

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Here, I'll do it right here.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Yeah.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Eat that mic.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Okay.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
So I'm in there.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
So then this happened and I'm just, you know, I don't want to take up too much of Beth's

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
time, but I also didn't want to, I don't want to talk about this and like, I don't even

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
know what happened.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Well.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
It's like, like, like, so I guess we just start.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Yes.

24:55.000 --> 25:06.000
So the, the last Sunday, my son and his friends came on and his friends were wearing gas masks

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
and he came on to tell you about his haunted maze.

25:10.000 --> 25:17.000
So the next morning I text Dan and I said, hi Dan, last night we got a visit.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
We believe it was from one of your diehard fans.

25:20.000 --> 25:26.000
Whoever it was stole Tamar's apocalyptic wasteland banner off of our garage door.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
And then she sends a picture of the, of the, of the banner.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
Let me see if I can show.

25:34.000 --> 25:40.000
Now what evidence did you have?

25:40.000 --> 25:45.000
I'll handle this for a 45 minute fight.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.800
Because I have, I have minor justice issues.

25:47.800 --> 25:51.800
Dan has huge justice issues, so let's see what goes down there.

25:51.800 --> 25:55.800
I have medium justice issues.

25:55.800 --> 25:56.800
We're like the bears.

25:56.800 --> 25:57.800
Yes.

25:57.800 --> 26:01.800
And then Spencer, your justice issues are just right.

26:01.800 --> 26:02.800
Yeah.

26:02.800 --> 26:03.800
All right.

26:03.800 --> 26:13.300
So, so I wrote, I sent this to Dan and then I said, the price of knowing Dan Hormann.

26:13.300 --> 26:18.800
And I put a very surprised look of those little, what do you call them?

26:18.800 --> 26:19.800
Mochis.

26:19.800 --> 26:20.800
A sticker.

26:20.800 --> 26:26.800
And, and, and then I wrote it again by accident and I said, oops.

26:26.800 --> 26:27.800
Okay.

26:27.800 --> 26:28.800
So.

26:28.800 --> 26:29.800
And then I put, grrr.

26:29.800 --> 26:32.800
You have to say, this sounds like you had a little wine.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.800
With an angry face.

26:34.800 --> 26:35.800
Okay.

26:35.800 --> 26:36.800
These are wine texts.

26:36.800 --> 26:37.800
All right.

26:37.800 --> 26:42.600
So then I said, why on earth would you assume an adult podcast listener would do something

26:42.600 --> 26:44.600
like that instead of a high school student?

26:44.600 --> 26:46.600
And then I wrote back.

26:46.600 --> 26:51.100
I said, why would a high school student even want it so bad that they would steal it?

26:51.100 --> 26:54.520
It has more value to the person who has something that's connected to you.

26:54.520 --> 26:57.200
A little piece of Dan Hormann.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.200
That's a stretch.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.200
Jesus.

26:59.200 --> 27:05.640
They know my house is next door.

27:05.640 --> 27:08.160
If they wanted a piece of me, they could take something from me.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.800
My audience is nice people.

27:09.800 --> 27:15.960
It makes for a great story, we will put everything away in our garage now.

27:15.960 --> 27:19.440
They wouldn't be going to your haunted house to do anything but support you.

27:19.440 --> 27:21.920
Some of your fans are nice, normal people.

27:21.920 --> 27:25.240
Some of them are obsessed with Dan Hormann people.

27:25.240 --> 27:26.740
That's true.

27:26.740 --> 27:30.320
Your fans are fascinated that we live next door to you.

27:30.320 --> 27:31.320
It's okay.

27:31.320 --> 27:32.320
I'm not mad at you.

27:32.320 --> 27:33.560
We'll just make a new one.

27:33.560 --> 27:36.800
How could we possibly know if it is a Dan Hormann fan?

27:36.800 --> 27:38.480
We just had a suspicion.

27:38.480 --> 27:43.200
The boys are already excited to make a new one and they've got a great story.

27:43.200 --> 27:46.640
You may not be mad at me, but I can't think of a reason to share that suspicion with me

27:46.640 --> 27:56.880
other than to solicit feelings of guilt.

27:56.880 --> 27:58.360
Not to make you feel guilty.

27:58.360 --> 27:59.840
It's not your fault.

27:59.840 --> 28:01.560
It's more a story of interest.

28:01.560 --> 28:03.320
Don't you find it interesting?

28:03.320 --> 28:07.240
Would you want me to express shame or remorse about this thing just because you have a

28:07.240 --> 28:10.520
weird theory connecting it to me?

28:10.520 --> 28:13.960
What if my dog got poisoned and I texted you saying I knew your friends did it?

28:13.960 --> 28:18.320
That would be really thoughtless of me because if I respected you as a human being, I'd have

28:18.320 --> 28:22.240
to know laying something like that near you would cause you anxiety.

28:22.240 --> 28:23.240
It's funny.

28:23.240 --> 28:26.400
We're rather humored about it, flattered in a way.

28:26.400 --> 28:30.160
Saying you're humored and flattered that one of my fans stole your stuff is still saying

28:30.160 --> 28:32.520
one of my fans stole your stuff.

28:32.520 --> 28:34.600
It's weird to say that.

28:34.600 --> 28:36.840
We don't know if it was one of your fans.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.280
You don't know either.

28:39.280 --> 28:40.280
So drunk.

28:40.280 --> 28:47.680
Just like you could smell the Chardonnay on these texts.

28:47.680 --> 28:49.240
This is 10 a.m. though.

28:49.240 --> 28:50.680
I mean, no judgment.

28:50.680 --> 28:51.680
Notwithstanding.

28:51.680 --> 28:54.240
We'll never really know.

28:54.240 --> 28:55.600
It's just a suspicion.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.000
We're not blaming you.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.600
It's just a possibility.

28:58.600 --> 29:01.160
We still love you no matter what.

29:01.160 --> 29:05.160
Think how cool it would be to have the banner on one's wall and be able to say that it came

29:05.160 --> 29:07.960
from one of Dan Harmon's episodes.

29:07.960 --> 29:09.500
Maybe it was a prankster.

29:09.500 --> 29:11.000
Just was a coincidence.

29:11.000 --> 29:16.280
You don't have fans that are a little out there?

29:16.280 --> 29:20.440
Well I do have a crazy neighbor that accuses strangers of stealing shit, but I don't know

29:20.440 --> 29:28.320
if she's a fan or not.

29:28.320 --> 29:29.560
I didn't accuse you.

29:29.560 --> 29:30.840
I said strangers.

29:30.840 --> 29:32.560
I didn't accuse a stranger.

29:32.560 --> 29:34.080
I suspect it.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.280
You don't really know.

29:35.280 --> 29:36.920
Thought it was a possibility.

29:36.920 --> 29:38.880
Thought it was a coincidence.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.280
Thought it was interesting.

29:40.280 --> 29:42.240
It's a possibility that ISIS took it.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.760
You didn't text the president.

29:44.760 --> 29:48.400
And it wouldn't be coincidence if a random, unknown, unrelated person took something from

29:48.400 --> 29:50.200
a haunted house that was open to the public.

29:50.200 --> 29:52.560
It would be incidents.

29:52.560 --> 29:56.560
If I thought that someone would do that to you guys that respected my show, I'd be livid

29:56.560 --> 30:00.440
and embarrassed.

30:00.440 --> 30:05.880
I have a neighbor sharing information with a neighbor who just happened to have an episode

30:05.880 --> 30:11.960
on his podcast relating to a neighbor's haunted maze the very same night the banner goes missing.

30:11.960 --> 30:13.600
It's just a coincidence.

30:13.600 --> 30:17.160
There's a cardboard sign on the street corner that says haunted house.

30:17.160 --> 30:19.520
Has nobody been coming other than podcast people?

30:19.520 --> 30:22.080
Do they have podcast logos on their foreheads?

30:22.080 --> 30:23.560
Is there a sign in sheet?

30:23.560 --> 30:29.680
And all the people that came wrote Harmontown in the who sent you column.

30:29.680 --> 30:31.000
You are livid.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.760
You take responsibility for all your fans.

30:33.760 --> 30:36.280
You know that none of them would ever do that.

30:36.280 --> 30:38.920
You know that none of them would even consider that.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.920
Do you consider them your children?

30:40.920 --> 30:45.800
Have I offended you because I said that it is a possibility that one of your fans may

30:45.800 --> 30:47.800
have taken it?

30:47.800 --> 30:49.920
Yes!

30:49.920 --> 30:51.520
You have!

30:51.520 --> 30:53.600
It's an offensive thing to do.

30:53.600 --> 30:58.720
Look up the word offense.

30:58.720 --> 31:00.680
I did not accuse you.

31:00.680 --> 31:02.400
This is not about you.

31:02.400 --> 31:04.000
Why are you taking this so personally?

31:04.000 --> 31:06.280
This has nothing to do with you.

31:06.280 --> 31:07.680
I'm not blaming you.

31:07.680 --> 31:12.560
Then why did you text me about it?

31:12.560 --> 31:17.120
Because I had suspicions that it could possibly be one of your fans.

31:17.120 --> 31:19.720
So it has something to do with me.

31:19.720 --> 31:22.720
No, it doesn't.

31:22.720 --> 31:29.280
So you expected me to laugh and say, haha, that's funny that someone in my podcast audience

31:29.280 --> 31:31.480
stole your property.

31:31.480 --> 31:35.600
You joked about two episodes ago that you were afraid that if you gave our address

31:35.600 --> 31:40.080
away that everyone would know whereabouts you live and that you would come home to

31:40.080 --> 31:41.920
find a stranger in your kitchen.

31:41.920 --> 31:43.920
I would be upset for you if that happened.

31:43.920 --> 31:48.600
I wouldn't consider it a normal human response to be amused by Timber's property being stolen

31:48.600 --> 31:50.640
even if it was by a complete random person.

31:50.640 --> 31:52.200
I would just say, oh, that's too bad.

31:52.200 --> 31:54.160
I wouldn't say, haha, that's funny.

31:54.160 --> 31:58.480
So imagine how much weirder it would be to say, haha, to someone stealing Timber's stuff

31:58.480 --> 32:01.400
if it wasn't a complete random person but it was someone somehow doing it because of

32:01.400 --> 32:02.400
my show.

32:02.400 --> 32:05.920
The normal human response to the idea of that would be for me to say, oh, god, that's fucking

32:05.920 --> 32:06.920
awful.

32:06.920 --> 32:07.920
I can't believe someone did that.

32:07.920 --> 32:08.920
I'm so sorry.

32:08.920 --> 32:13.200
I didn't expect you to laugh.

32:13.200 --> 32:15.480
I didn't expect you to get mad, though.

32:15.480 --> 32:17.120
I was making a joke.

32:17.120 --> 32:22.680
You didn't find it funny but it really was an attempt of light humor that was taken very

32:22.680 --> 32:23.680
seriously.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.180
Sorry.

32:25.180 --> 32:32.880
Thank you for being such a cool neighbor.

32:32.880 --> 32:41.600
You take the high road and I'll take the low road and I'll be in Scotland before you.

32:41.600 --> 32:46.240
People always want to hear about what it's like to live next to Dan Harmon, a peek into

32:46.240 --> 32:47.240
him.

32:47.240 --> 32:50.960
Well, your joke was that your son had to pay a price for living next door to me.

32:50.960 --> 32:53.520
That would be something that I would feel terrible about and you kind of committed to

32:53.520 --> 32:56.480
the joke to the point of arguing for a really long time that we should definitely assume

32:56.480 --> 32:57.960
someone that listens to the show did it.

32:57.960 --> 32:59.640
It wasn't very clear and still isn't.

32:59.640 --> 33:00.640
Which part is the joke?

33:00.640 --> 33:03.120
Do you still honestly believe it's more likely that someone from my audience did it and the

33:03.120 --> 33:06.280
joke was that it mattered at all or was the joke that you suspected it was someone from

33:06.280 --> 33:10.600
the audience and you just have a very strong commitment to humor?

33:10.600 --> 33:18.080
Dan, can we take that one again but faster this time?

33:18.080 --> 33:21.960
Oh, Dan, it was a stupid joke.

33:21.960 --> 33:25.480
I'm not that mad.

33:25.480 --> 33:32.040
Set with balloons, but I have to fixate on my writing now.

33:32.040 --> 33:34.920
I'm way past a morning deadline and getting yelled at.

33:34.920 --> 33:35.960
Please forgive me.

33:35.960 --> 33:38.320
I forgive you nutty pants.

33:38.320 --> 33:40.000
No harm intended.

33:40.000 --> 33:44.960
Hashtag neighbors for life.

33:44.960 --> 33:52.960
That's a good ending.

33:52.960 --> 33:58.760
I like the new hashtag harm intended.

33:58.760 --> 34:04.160
And then I sent him an emoji that is the emoji where the guy's eyes are googling like this

34:04.160 --> 34:08.840
and there's the crazy guy.

34:08.840 --> 34:10.720
So I'm not saying that you're nuts.

34:10.720 --> 34:12.760
I said, well, maybe just a little.

34:12.760 --> 34:13.760
All right.

34:13.760 --> 34:14.760
Well, I guess.

34:14.760 --> 34:15.760
All right.

34:15.760 --> 34:19.360
So, you have the pulpit.

34:19.360 --> 34:22.320
Do you still think that one of my...

34:22.320 --> 34:23.560
That we can still be friends?

34:23.560 --> 34:26.520
Well, do you still think one of my fans took your tarp?

34:26.520 --> 34:30.120
I took the fucking tarp.

34:30.120 --> 34:32.040
It's in my car.

34:32.040 --> 34:36.040
I knew it.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.040
Well, I...

34:37.040 --> 34:38.040
Who won the tarp?

34:38.040 --> 34:41.560
I used to steal anything that wasn't nailed down.

34:41.560 --> 34:42.560
Maybe...

34:42.560 --> 34:43.560
Well...

34:43.560 --> 34:46.280
But it's got to be a teenager unrelated to the show.

34:46.280 --> 34:55.360
This had black gorilla tape that it was taped all to the garage and it was very, very...

34:55.360 --> 35:04.880
It looked like a little kid that had taped it to the garage and it was big and it was...

35:04.880 --> 35:09.040
I just think it's kind of a really, really weird coincidence that...

35:09.040 --> 35:10.040
Hold on.

35:10.040 --> 35:11.040
I don't know.

35:11.040 --> 35:12.040
Hold on.

35:12.040 --> 35:13.040
That the night...

35:13.040 --> 35:15.040
Don't get mad all over again.

35:15.040 --> 35:17.200
I'm trying to be mad.

35:17.200 --> 35:26.880
Let me ask you guys, because you're his fans, is it a strong coincidence that it could be...

35:26.880 --> 35:29.560
I'm not saying it's you.

35:29.560 --> 35:32.800
I'm not saying it's you.

35:32.800 --> 35:36.920
I'm sure most of you are very normal, nice people.

35:36.920 --> 35:40.000
I'm sure some of you are nice people, but a lot of you are bringing crime.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Yes.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
A lot of you are rapists.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
A lot of you are rapists.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Possibility.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.400
I'm sure some of you are nice.

35:46.400 --> 35:48.800
Some of you are stealing signs.

35:48.800 --> 35:58.120
Is it a possibility that one of you could have driven to our house because we live next

35:58.120 --> 35:59.640
door to Dan Harmon?

35:59.640 --> 36:07.720
I think it's as likely that you stole this sign yourself so you can get back on the show.

36:07.720 --> 36:12.480
There's in a world where anything's possible, there's no need to focus in on the possibility...

36:12.480 --> 36:19.960
I just think it's very, very coincidental that the next morning that we had that episode

36:19.960 --> 36:23.360
the night before, but nobody would have stolen...

36:23.360 --> 36:25.520
So was this Monday night that this happened?

36:25.520 --> 36:27.640
It happened Monday more Sunday.

36:27.640 --> 36:33.200
When we went outside Monday morning, Monday morning, so it would have to be hearing or

36:33.200 --> 36:36.240
a live streaming person that was nearby.

36:36.240 --> 36:43.520
That somebody, you know, whatever it was, somebody, you know, somebody, one of you,

36:43.520 --> 36:45.520
one of you!

36:45.520 --> 36:52.480
Well, we'll continue to, I mean, I've come forward now.

36:52.480 --> 36:59.360
We'll lower the lights and turn our backs, and if you took the apocalypse sign, put it

36:59.360 --> 37:00.360
in there.

37:00.360 --> 37:02.480
Are you giving him a chance to turn himself in?

37:02.480 --> 37:03.480
Yeah!

37:03.480 --> 37:04.480
Right.

37:04.480 --> 37:05.480
Yeah, I mean, if you...

37:05.480 --> 37:09.760
Well, yeah, if someone, someone, someone, someone returned, you can, you can...

37:09.760 --> 37:10.760
Just bring it to NerdMelt.

37:10.760 --> 37:11.760
Right.

37:11.760 --> 37:12.760
Yeah, bring it here and drop it off.

37:12.760 --> 37:14.080
Yeah, here's a way to do it.

37:14.080 --> 37:17.920
If you returned the sign and you were a Harmontown family, you're listening to this right

37:17.920 --> 37:22.320
now, and you did take it, which is really cool if you did.

37:22.320 --> 37:23.320
Yeah.

37:23.320 --> 37:24.320
That's like really awesome.

37:24.320 --> 37:29.760
It's a very, very cool banner to hang on a wall.

37:29.760 --> 37:30.760
Beth Bootson...

37:30.760 --> 37:31.760
That somebody could say...

37:31.760 --> 37:35.080
Beth, Beth, would you put $100 bounty on that if, if, if someone could prove that they were

37:35.080 --> 37:36.520
a Harmontown fan?

37:36.520 --> 37:39.440
Would you pay $100 to get that sign back?

37:39.440 --> 37:40.440
Would I pay $100?

37:40.440 --> 37:41.440
Yes.

37:41.440 --> 37:42.440
Yes.

37:42.440 --> 37:43.440
To prove yourself right.

37:43.440 --> 37:44.440
You know what?

37:44.440 --> 37:45.440
I think Dan Harmon...

37:45.440 --> 37:46.440
Whoa!

37:46.440 --> 37:47.440
Oh!

37:47.440 --> 37:48.440
Would pay $100.

37:48.440 --> 37:52.640
But then if you took it, you can just make a $100 sign.

37:52.640 --> 37:53.640
No, I would not.

37:53.640 --> 37:54.640
I didn't take it.

37:54.640 --> 37:55.640
Well, I didn't take it either.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.640
But Dan Harmon, I think.

37:57.640 --> 37:58.640
Okay.

37:58.640 --> 37:59.960
You both have to, you have to match Dan's $100.

37:59.960 --> 38:01.600
You both have to put $100.

38:01.600 --> 38:04.560
200 clams if you're a Harmonian that stole that sign.

38:04.560 --> 38:05.560
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

38:05.560 --> 38:06.560
You, Beth, are...

38:06.560 --> 38:07.560
Wait.

38:07.560 --> 38:08.560
No.

38:08.560 --> 38:09.560
You're putting up $100.

38:09.560 --> 38:10.560
But I would be right.

38:10.560 --> 38:11.560
So...

38:11.560 --> 38:12.560
Right, you'd be right.

38:12.560 --> 38:13.560
I would be right.

38:13.560 --> 38:14.560
But it would cost you $100 simoleon.

38:14.560 --> 38:15.560
No.

38:15.560 --> 38:16.560
You would be wrong.

38:16.560 --> 38:17.560
Right, I'd be wrong.

38:17.560 --> 38:18.560
Yeah.

38:18.560 --> 38:23.800
So, the penalty for being wrong is that you have to pay $100.

38:23.800 --> 38:24.800
Right.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.800
So, what we're saying is...

38:26.800 --> 38:31.840
Well, let me, wait, wait, wait, let me up the ante.

38:31.840 --> 38:32.840
Okay.

38:32.840 --> 38:34.840
Let me up the ante.

38:34.840 --> 38:35.840
Physical challenge.

38:35.840 --> 38:44.320
If we were to get that banner back, you have to pay the $100 and then autograph it for

38:44.320 --> 38:46.840
the person.

38:46.840 --> 38:53.200
And then it would be worth even more when they hang it on their wall.

38:53.200 --> 38:54.200
Beth, you stole the banner.

38:54.200 --> 38:55.200
You just won't.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.200
No.

38:56.200 --> 38:57.200
This is the fucking longest con I've ever seen.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.200
Are you sick of the Haunted House?

38:58.200 --> 38:59.200
This is like the stings.

38:59.200 --> 39:01.840
Are you acting out against the Haunted House?

39:01.840 --> 39:02.840
No, I'm...

39:02.840 --> 39:03.840
Robert Redford's about to come out.

39:03.840 --> 39:04.840
No.

39:04.840 --> 39:07.080
I think this is a funny story.

39:07.080 --> 39:10.040
And wouldn't it be interesting to find out who's right?

39:10.040 --> 39:11.040
Great.

39:11.040 --> 39:12.040
But we won't be able to...

39:12.040 --> 39:19.600
One thing we really can do is say, if somebody gives it back anonymously, we can...

39:19.600 --> 39:23.240
We still won't be able to reach the conclusion, you know, automatically that a Haunted Town

39:23.240 --> 39:24.240
fan took it.

39:24.240 --> 39:26.280
However, that person has the...

39:26.280 --> 39:28.880
Whoever took it has the power to make it look that way.

39:28.880 --> 39:31.840
And we're opening ourselves up and saying, even...

39:31.840 --> 39:36.560
Like fine, if that person does that, would you be willing to pay any money for that?

39:36.560 --> 39:39.280
Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, let's look at...

39:39.280 --> 39:46.080
If it gets returned, I think Dan Harmon should autograph it, and we can hang it here on the

39:46.080 --> 39:47.080
wall.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.080
Oh, boy.

39:48.080 --> 39:49.080
And...

39:49.080 --> 39:50.080
Can I make a pitch?

39:50.080 --> 39:51.080
Can I...

39:51.080 --> 39:52.960
May I make a pitch?

39:52.960 --> 39:58.360
I think anyone listening to this right now should go to that Haunted Maze, steal anything

39:58.360 --> 40:00.880
you want.

40:00.880 --> 40:03.520
Dan Harmon will autograph it for you.

40:03.520 --> 40:06.440
Well, I'll make you this deal now.

40:06.440 --> 40:08.240
Let's just go rob this fucking place.

40:08.240 --> 40:13.400
I mean, starting with the airing of this show, anything that gets stolen is kind of this

40:13.400 --> 40:14.400
podcast's fault.

40:14.400 --> 40:16.400
Like, like, like, like, because...

40:16.400 --> 40:22.400
I'm saying Harmonians now don't have the guts to go steal shit from the Bootson family.

40:22.400 --> 40:25.880
We're putting everything in our garage now.

40:25.880 --> 40:26.880
Wow, okay.

40:26.880 --> 40:30.400
But, but anyways, all right, well, so, like, you...

40:30.400 --> 40:35.200
Is it possible, if you think of a scenario in which there's someone who is so driven

40:35.200 --> 40:38.280
by his obsession with Dan that he wants to steal...

40:38.280 --> 40:39.280
Or she.

40:39.280 --> 40:43.280
Why do you think that person would go to you and not go to Dan's house and steal from

40:43.280 --> 40:44.280
Dan's house?

40:44.280 --> 40:48.200
Because it was the night of our episode.

40:48.200 --> 40:49.200
But that's backwards.

40:49.200 --> 40:53.000
And the way they look at it, it's a really, really cool banner.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.440
They could hang it on their wall.

40:54.440 --> 40:55.440
That's like...

40:55.440 --> 40:56.440
And...

40:56.440 --> 40:57.440
That applies to anybody.

40:57.440 --> 41:02.160
No, it applies to only Dan Harmon fans.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.400
One of them.

41:03.400 --> 41:04.400
One of them.

41:04.400 --> 41:09.640
Wouldn't this be cool to, like, wouldn't this be cool because I took it and it was related

41:09.640 --> 41:13.320
to Dan Harmon because it was about the episode about Harmonian mazes?

41:13.320 --> 41:14.320
All right.

41:14.320 --> 41:20.200
Well, I feel like in this Gamera versus Mothra conflict that we have, like, like, the eucalyptus

41:20.200 --> 41:23.080
tree thing, it was like, okay, I'm the bad person.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.600
Your tree is fine, by the way.

41:24.600 --> 41:26.960
You're the bad person in this case.

41:26.960 --> 41:27.960
It survived those wins?

41:27.960 --> 41:28.960
Oh, yeah, but you don't know.

41:28.960 --> 41:32.960
You could be a disease eucalyptus tree and survive a million wins.

41:32.960 --> 41:34.840
No, those trees are gone.

41:34.840 --> 41:35.840
Yeah.

41:35.840 --> 41:39.440
Well, anyways, but I do want to acknowledge, like, I texted you and said, will you come

41:39.440 --> 41:41.120
down and read this shit?

41:41.120 --> 41:45.240
And that's like, you had soup on the stove and you were in your pajamas and you came

41:45.240 --> 41:46.240
down here looking at these clothes.

41:46.240 --> 41:48.040
I'm still wearing my pajama top.

41:48.040 --> 41:52.160
So, thank you so much and we're going to...

41:52.160 --> 41:53.960
Let's hear it for Beth Bootson and...

41:53.960 --> 41:54.960
Beth Bootson!

41:54.960 --> 42:05.240
Well, don't forget to step by the haunted maze, just take every goddamn thing you can

42:05.240 --> 42:06.240
get your hands on.

42:06.240 --> 42:19.560
And if you bring back that tarp, yeah, the banner, Dan Harmon said he would sign it and

42:19.560 --> 42:21.200
give you a hundred dollars.

42:21.200 --> 42:22.200
Okay.

42:22.200 --> 42:23.200
All right.

42:23.200 --> 42:28.040
And if you don't bring it back, Jeff will give you a hundred dollars.

42:28.040 --> 42:30.040
But I'm going to sign Beth Bootson.

42:30.040 --> 42:31.040
All right.

42:31.040 --> 42:32.040
Beth Bootson!

42:32.040 --> 42:44.640
And the unsung hero of the Beth Bootson Chronicles, her husband, Dan, who I think drove her down

42:44.640 --> 42:48.800
here last minute, probably went back there too, we've never even really met him.

42:48.800 --> 42:49.800
Thank you, Dan.

42:49.800 --> 42:50.800
I mean, he was out here once.

42:50.800 --> 42:51.800
But he never spoke.

42:51.800 --> 42:52.800
He just sat there...

42:52.800 --> 42:53.920
In blissful silence.

42:53.920 --> 42:57.800
The long-suffering Bootson husband.

42:57.800 --> 42:59.960
They call him on the block.

42:59.960 --> 43:00.960
Behind Beth's back.

43:00.960 --> 43:01.960
That's what we all call him.

43:01.960 --> 43:04.120
Oh, the long-suffering Bootson husband.

43:04.120 --> 43:06.120
Again, let's take a bite of Drew Ackerman.

43:06.120 --> 43:07.120
Thanks for coming up, Drew.

43:07.120 --> 43:08.120
Good to see you.

43:08.120 --> 43:09.120
All right.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.120
All right, Drew.

43:10.120 --> 43:13.120
Jesus, this is a poor guy.

43:13.120 --> 43:14.120
I am so sorry.

43:14.120 --> 43:15.120
I...

43:15.120 --> 43:16.120
That was awesome.

43:16.120 --> 43:17.120
Okay.

43:17.120 --> 43:18.120
Had to...

43:18.120 --> 43:20.320
It was a timely thing.

43:20.320 --> 43:21.320
It wasn't, though.

43:21.320 --> 43:22.960
It was a good podcaster.

43:22.960 --> 43:25.440
You're just being respectful of her time.

43:25.440 --> 43:34.440
So you're a podcast conceit, which is sincere, but I have to say also doubles his genius

43:34.440 --> 43:35.440
comedy.

43:35.440 --> 43:40.740
I mean, it's something about you that kind of, in a sublime way, rises above the dichotomy

43:40.740 --> 43:44.480
of, is he doing a bit or is he for real?

43:44.480 --> 43:45.800
You're kind of both.

43:45.800 --> 43:50.160
You know how funny it is that you're for real about the fact that you're dulcet tones,

43:50.160 --> 43:52.200
your way of speaking.

43:52.200 --> 43:58.440
You have resigned yourself instead of, in a world where everyone's trying to distinguish

43:58.440 --> 44:03.000
themselves and entertain, you were like, you know what, come to me when you want to go

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
to sleep.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
Yeah, yeah.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.740
I mean, I think it's...

44:07.740 --> 44:10.760
Even as a person that makes it, I look at it like, oh, I'm putting all this work into

44:10.760 --> 44:16.800
something that no one listens in, and I'm a really anxious, obsessive person, so I'm constantly

44:16.800 --> 44:17.800
worrying about it.

44:17.800 --> 44:22.600
Oh, this isn't good enough, blah, blah, blah, blah, and then I'm like, holy shit, like,

44:22.600 --> 44:25.840
if someone, like an outsider was watching this, they'd be like, dude, you're insane,

44:25.840 --> 44:28.800
like, and some listeners even emailed me, they're like, why don't you just read from

44:28.800 --> 44:29.800
the phone book?

44:29.800 --> 44:31.520
Why do you spend so much time working on it?

44:31.520 --> 44:34.960
And I'm like, well, I'm convinced that's what puts you to sleep, blah, blah, blah.

44:34.960 --> 44:35.960
Yeah, yeah.

44:35.960 --> 44:36.960
Well, that's...

44:36.960 --> 44:40.720
Yeah, and there was an article in New Yorker about you, about your podcast that talked

44:40.720 --> 44:44.400
about that, that insomnia is not something that people have conquered.

44:44.400 --> 44:46.200
It's a lot like the common cold.

44:46.200 --> 44:51.440
It is, you know, people think it's so simple, but it persists because doctors can't really

44:51.440 --> 44:52.440
get around it.

44:52.440 --> 44:57.800
Because anything a doctor would prescribe to you, it becomes part of this labyrinth of

44:57.800 --> 45:00.760
anxiety that keeps people awake.

45:00.760 --> 45:02.960
You yourself suffer from insomnia, correct?

45:02.960 --> 45:06.560
Yeah, yeah, like, I mean, the podcast, it was funny because last Sunday, you were kind

45:06.560 --> 45:11.200
of talking about Sunday nights, and you were having a shitty night, and you're like, oh,

45:11.200 --> 45:16.360
and for me, that's where the podcast came out of was like, I had the terrible time at

45:16.360 --> 45:17.360
school.

45:17.360 --> 45:21.400
And I would like, when Sundays were coming, I would not be able to sleep and I'd be like,

45:21.400 --> 45:22.400
I'll worried.

45:22.400 --> 45:27.080
And I was like, oh, I told my parents and they're like, drink some milk or like, you know, whatever

45:27.080 --> 45:28.080
the...

45:28.080 --> 45:29.080
And I'm like, no, you don't understand.

45:29.080 --> 45:34.360
I like spend the whole night worrying and they're like, oh, and then I started listening

45:34.360 --> 45:38.720
to Dr. Demento, like weird Al and stuff.

45:38.720 --> 45:42.920
And it never put me to sleep, but it like took my mind off of like lying there and worrying

45:42.920 --> 45:46.360
and thinking about going to school the next day and getting in trouble and stuff.

45:46.360 --> 45:50.680
And yeah, I don't think like pills can work for some people.

45:50.680 --> 45:54.080
There's different things that work for different people, but I think like a lot of people want

45:54.080 --> 45:55.080
a bedtime story.

45:55.080 --> 45:56.080
Yeah.

45:56.080 --> 45:57.440
Now, what do you do exactly?

45:57.440 --> 46:02.160
What makes you think that you're so narcotic that you can put people to sleep by talking?

46:02.160 --> 46:03.160
What is it about you that...

46:03.160 --> 46:09.040
Well, is it verifiable that people have said thank you, you knock me right out?

46:09.040 --> 46:10.040
Yeah.

46:10.040 --> 46:13.160
And your sponsors are mattresses and stuff.

46:13.160 --> 46:14.160
Yeah.

46:14.160 --> 46:15.160
Yeah.

46:15.160 --> 46:16.160
Like...

46:16.160 --> 46:17.160
And he has...

46:17.160 --> 46:20.880
I think you have about as many listeners as maybe more than us.

46:20.880 --> 46:23.480
I mean, he's very humble and self-effacing.

46:23.480 --> 46:25.640
New Yorker never wrote shit about Harmontown.

46:25.640 --> 46:31.440
But the New Yorker piece on you, which was June 2016, but they...

46:31.440 --> 46:37.680
I copied and pasted this, it said, the ideal bedtime story, according to Natune Verma,

46:37.680 --> 46:42.400
a national spokesperson for the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

46:42.400 --> 46:49.040
So the ideal bedtime story is one that doesn't build upon itself, like a movie with a lot

46:49.040 --> 46:54.680
of parallel stories that don't connect at the end, which I thought was kind of interesting.

46:54.680 --> 46:59.800
The children's books that our parents would sit with us, they do have a kind of like meandering

46:59.800 --> 47:01.960
quality, they don't exactly like...

47:01.960 --> 47:02.960
They're not die-hard.

47:02.960 --> 47:03.960
They don't like...

47:03.960 --> 47:04.960
Yeah, yeah.

47:04.960 --> 47:08.920
You know, like the longer you're listening, the bigger the build is, oh my God, Hans Gruber

47:08.920 --> 47:11.240
is gonna get it.

47:11.240 --> 47:13.080
It's like, oh, and then this, and then the...

47:13.080 --> 47:17.640
My mother would always read Beowulf to me, but I don't know how to read it.

47:17.640 --> 47:18.640
But you...

47:18.640 --> 47:21.160
When you first started doing the podcast, how many episodes have you done?

47:21.160 --> 47:22.640
Because you do about three a week.

47:22.640 --> 47:26.240
Yeah, like I've done like 400 and like more than 450.

47:26.240 --> 47:27.240
How long have you been at it?

47:27.240 --> 47:28.240
Since what year?

47:28.240 --> 47:29.240
Like three years, so...

47:29.240 --> 47:33.120
I think it was less time than we've been doing this podcast and has twice as well.

47:33.120 --> 47:34.120
This...

47:34.120 --> 47:35.120
Of course, the math would work out, Dan.

47:35.120 --> 47:36.120
Yeah.

47:36.120 --> 47:44.000
If you stacked his podcasts on top of ours, there'd be three times as many.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.760
Because he does them three times a week.

47:46.760 --> 47:52.080
If the moon was one from the earth, he'd have hit it three times.

47:52.080 --> 47:55.400
Thanks, Dan.

47:55.400 --> 47:58.200
But did you originally start doing it?

47:58.200 --> 47:59.720
I didn't go back to the beginning.

47:59.720 --> 48:03.080
Did you start trying to just straight up tell bedtime stories?

48:03.080 --> 48:04.560
I was curious.

48:04.560 --> 48:09.640
I was like, man, I liked listening to podcasts and comedy podcasts and stuff, and I was like,

48:09.640 --> 48:10.640
man, why...

48:10.640 --> 48:16.240
And this isn't like a knock on guided meditations or nature sounds, but it was always like something

48:16.240 --> 48:17.240
that...

48:17.240 --> 48:21.000
I'm an irritable person, so it would irritate me or the nature noises we'd get at.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
I'd be like, why?

48:22.000 --> 48:28.160
And I was like, why isn't there something that's a little bit weird but that has a bedtime

48:28.160 --> 48:29.160
story.

48:29.160 --> 48:32.160
There's also a factor, because you're such a smart, funny guy.

48:32.160 --> 48:41.480
The thing is, I'm sure nature, those tapes, the people that tend to delve into that area,

48:41.480 --> 48:42.880
they don't have...

48:42.880 --> 48:46.480
God bless them, but they're not...

48:46.480 --> 48:48.480
There's funny things that can happen that they don't acknowledge.

48:48.480 --> 48:52.040
Yeah, they're not lying there thinking about, what are the bugs crawling around?

48:52.040 --> 48:53.160
Where the hell is this rain?

48:53.160 --> 48:54.160
Like Schrab

48:54.160 --> 48:57.040
My partner Schrab was a partner friend, but he's a friend now.

48:57.040 --> 48:59.160
He's a kind of a common lot of...

48:59.160 --> 49:02.720
A life partner, yeah.

49:02.720 --> 49:03.720
He tried to do...

49:03.720 --> 49:07.440
He had a therapist that would make his own tape, he would give him tapes and sell them

49:07.440 --> 49:09.160
to him.

49:09.160 --> 49:15.040
This just happens at this point in the show, don't worry about it.

49:15.040 --> 49:16.040
But one of the things...

49:16.040 --> 49:19.320
I remember Schrab describing to me, oh yeah, I'm listening to this tape and this guy's

49:19.320 --> 49:24.160
like talking to me about, you're going to be less intimidated in public, you're going

49:24.160 --> 49:29.520
to be issuing these commands, but then clearly a screen door opens and some woman comes home

49:29.520 --> 49:40.200
with groceries and there's these random sounds that happen.

49:40.200 --> 49:44.480
People that put themselves in charge of your spirit and your essence, the danger there

49:44.480 --> 49:46.680
is that the drawstring is pulled so...

49:46.680 --> 49:53.560
The drawstring, the bowstring is drawn so tight that the slightest bit of humanity...

49:53.560 --> 49:57.200
Like shoots an arrow across the room, it's very distracting.

49:57.200 --> 49:59.760
You're from the outset...

49:59.760 --> 50:05.240
The first episode that I listened to you do, you just had decided that you wanted to talk

50:05.240 --> 50:06.240
about...

50:06.240 --> 50:10.560
Well, you didn't decide, you talked about crackers for 30 minutes.

50:10.560 --> 50:18.800
30 hardcore, like crack, like just the labyrinth of your mind.

50:18.800 --> 50:21.800
I don't think I would fall asleep to that, I think I'd want to know all about it.

50:21.800 --> 50:26.320
Just to think about, isn't there a cracker industry, that's what I was thinking about,

50:26.320 --> 50:35.280
you got the green box crackers, you got the red box crackers, what other ones are there?

50:35.280 --> 50:42.560
You have a whole national biscuit company, you've got the Nabisco, all of Trump's followers.

50:42.560 --> 50:46.480
It brought me to the edge of my consciousness listening to the cracker thing and then what

50:46.480 --> 50:52.160
you really got into was that you'd become obsessed with Rick Moranis and you wanted

50:52.160 --> 50:57.720
to talk and I would drift in and out of consciousness and when I would drift back into consciousness,

50:57.720 --> 51:06.080
you were still in what apparently was, I guess, a fantasy improv that was a conversation

51:06.080 --> 51:14.000
between you and Rick Moranis, just for what seemingly, it seems like it's six hours.

51:14.000 --> 51:18.280
The podcast started about two hours long but it seems like, that's the beautiful thing,

51:18.280 --> 51:22.360
we use ocean waves and howler monkeys and things.

51:22.360 --> 51:27.400
That drew, for somebody, I don't suffer from insomnia, I sleep pretty well.

51:27.400 --> 51:31.840
Is this something that would put anyone to sleep or is it a certain mindset that goes

51:31.840 --> 51:35.640
into this thing, I need this particularly to knock me out?

51:35.640 --> 51:40.960
You would know pretty quick, the people that won't put to sleep hate me, they email me,

51:40.960 --> 51:46.320
they're like, I fucking hate your voice, so it's pretty, because it is, like, damn

51:46.320 --> 51:51.640
a sin, some people, certain things work for, they want to be led on this journey to find

51:51.640 --> 51:55.920
the magical box within their soul or whatever, but that's just not me, I want something that's

51:55.920 --> 51:56.920
goofy.

51:56.920 --> 51:59.920
Do you ever slip in any words of bleminal stuff?

51:59.920 --> 52:08.160
I tried a few times, yeah, and the sad thing was no one emailed me, I was like, okay, my

52:08.160 --> 52:14.760
little ninjas, like I was pretending I was giving a seminar on profiting from boredom

52:14.760 --> 52:21.200
or something, and then I was like, okay, now you're going to kill it, I didn't say kill

52:21.200 --> 52:22.200
it.

52:22.200 --> 52:28.320
How did you describe yourself when you were, in the episode you just did, if people listen

52:28.320 --> 52:32.600
right now to the latest episode, you talk about your nervous coming out of the podcast

52:32.600 --> 52:36.960
and you try to do my story circle model with a thing, it makes me feel like I ruined your

52:36.960 --> 52:45.280
podcast because you're talking about my bullshit all night, but it was also brilliant, I mean

52:45.280 --> 52:46.280
you were-

52:46.280 --> 52:48.400
I'm sure lots of people fell asleep to that, damn it.

52:48.400 --> 52:56.240
Yeah, no, I don't flatter myself that way, but in that episode you said, sometimes you're

52:56.240 --> 53:03.560
explaining each podcast episode, you're explaining to people who might be new, you're telling

53:03.560 --> 53:08.640
them how to categorize you, and this episode you said something like, I'm just that friend

53:08.640 --> 53:17.600
of yours that you think, I'm your friend that you're allowed to think is a doofus, what

53:17.600 --> 53:18.600
did you say?

53:18.600 --> 53:23.280
Something like that, I mean that's kind of the conceit of the podcast is like, I mean

53:23.280 --> 53:28.120
via podcast, like I'm coming over to your house, but you have no commitment to listen

53:28.120 --> 53:34.600
to me, or humor me, or offer me a drink, I mean like almost like a super stone person

53:34.600 --> 53:39.200
that won't stop talking, but instead of getting on your nerves, you're like, I'm just gonna

53:39.200 --> 53:44.920
lie here and fall asleep, and they're like, totally, I don't care at all, let me tell

53:44.920 --> 53:49.200
you about the time I showed over Rick Moranis' house and tried to pitch him to get back.

53:49.200 --> 53:53.960
I might have mentioned this a long time ago in a Harmontown, but I was on a flight and

53:53.960 --> 53:58.280
Alec Baldwin, this was a long time ago, like pre-30 Rock, was sitting across the aisle

53:58.280 --> 54:02.080
from me, and he was sitting next to a woman who I don't think he knew, and I had the

54:02.080 --> 54:07.520
Bose noise canceling headset on, so I could just barely hear him, and it was the greatest

54:07.520 --> 54:13.320
thing to fall asleep to, he was like, you know when I was six I had this dog, this dog

54:13.320 --> 54:14.320
ran away.

54:14.320 --> 54:17.480
He told the story about this dog that ran away, I was like, I just drifted beautifully

54:17.480 --> 54:21.760
off to sleep, like I want Alec Baldwin just to come over and just lay next to me and whisper.

54:21.760 --> 54:30.240
Yeah, like I'm kind of like the boring crappy version of Alec Baldwin, but also weirder,

54:30.240 --> 54:34.440
like I try to stay calm, I think that's another thing about the podcast is I tend to be really

54:34.440 --> 54:39.720
anxious and spastic, but to do the show I've got to be like, I've got to calm down and

54:39.720 --> 54:46.880
be like, well one, I can't believe Mrs. LaRusso lists this in a freaking podcast, but even

54:46.880 --> 54:52.920
this would be like, okay there was just a woman on stage and it's clear to me, she's

54:52.920 --> 54:58.200
so sick of her son's haunted house that she's trying to set up Dan, and I was pitching

54:58.200 --> 55:02.600
her one night and she came out of the house, she checked Timor's door to see if Timor is

55:02.600 --> 55:08.480
asleep, when you think about Timor, you're like, what does he have on his walls, what

55:08.480 --> 55:16.760
posters does he have, and then I think about myself and I'm like man, I wish I didn't have

55:16.760 --> 55:21.120
that, I could have never made a haunted house, like I think I started making it, so that's

55:21.120 --> 55:23.640
kind of the podcast.

55:23.640 --> 55:31.480
So it's all, it's all free association, do you prepare anything, you just totally riff

55:31.480 --> 55:33.440
and just go with the flow?

55:33.440 --> 55:40.080
So I do one free association one every week, then I do one, like that's like soft scripted,

55:40.080 --> 55:45.080
like outline with dialogue, and then I do one on like TV shows, so right now I've been

55:45.080 --> 55:49.920
watching, like there's a Colombian version of Breaking Bad, it's called metastasis, and

55:49.920 --> 55:54.960
it's like, it's awesome, it's like a shot for shot remake, almost shot for shot.

55:54.960 --> 55:58.520
So, and this is how ill I am, it's called metastasis.

55:58.520 --> 55:59.520
Like tumors.

55:59.520 --> 56:01.680
Yeah, because Walter White.

56:01.680 --> 56:04.360
I never saw it, sorry.

56:04.360 --> 56:05.360
One day.

56:05.360 --> 56:12.800
They have to focus more on the cancer than the drugs in this version, because some things

56:12.800 --> 56:16.560
are more shocking than others.

56:16.560 --> 56:20.240
But yeah, like so I'll watch the Colombian version of Breaking Bad, then I'll watch Breaking

56:20.240 --> 56:24.960
Bad, I'll take a ton of notes, and then I'll just be like, it's Walter Blanco, so I'll

56:24.960 --> 56:27.560
be like, not Walter Blanco.

56:27.560 --> 56:28.560
Walter Blanco.

56:28.560 --> 56:31.320
But they left, they left Walter.

56:31.320 --> 56:41.720
And Saul Bueno, Saul Bueno, it is really good, like the acting, it's not like a joke,

56:41.720 --> 56:44.800
it's like, it made me appreciate Breaking Bad so much more.

56:44.800 --> 56:45.800
What is it that draws you to it?

56:45.800 --> 56:50.920
Because I think you said, you're actually kind of teaching yourself Spanish, or brushing

56:50.920 --> 56:51.920
up on your Spanish?

56:51.920 --> 56:58.200
I've learned about, I've watched 61 episodes, I probably, like twice, and I probably still

56:58.200 --> 57:00.800
know the same words when I failed out of Spanish in high school.

57:00.800 --> 57:04.320
But what is drawing you to that, because when I hear about that, I think, okay, I'd like

57:04.320 --> 57:08.520
to watch a five minute clip of that, but what do you, so you're really, you're hooked on

57:08.520 --> 57:10.520
a thing that you already know the story, and you're watching it.

57:10.520 --> 57:15.080
I said he's a bit obsessive about your, yeah, I think it's like, well, one, it's like, from

57:15.080 --> 57:18.960
making anything every single week, it's like, I got to watch it every week.

57:18.960 --> 57:22.720
So like, people are like, oh, why don't you do something like the Smurfs or something?

57:22.720 --> 57:26.520
And I'm like, well, I'd lose my mind, like I could watch two weeks of the Smurfs.

57:26.520 --> 57:28.600
But Breaking Bad is a great show.

57:28.600 --> 57:32.640
And then it's just interesting watching, like a kind of Colombian interpretation.

57:32.640 --> 57:38.400
All right, so it's always giving you something, because it's lateral, I think, I get that

57:38.400 --> 57:43.800
now, correct me if I'm wrong, this is maybe something that you wouldn't do at all if you

57:43.800 --> 57:46.320
didn't have this podcast to contend with.

57:46.320 --> 57:47.320
Exactly.

57:47.320 --> 57:51.280
Like you're actually using it to like kind of charge a battery.

57:51.280 --> 57:54.200
Yeah, because like, you know, when you're like, you're watching something and then you're

57:54.200 --> 57:57.760
like, kind of like start playing around on your phone or whatever, like this, like I

57:57.760 --> 58:05.000
have to be engaged in, I don't know, I guess like, because it's like, pointlessly challenging,

58:05.000 --> 58:09.000
I don't know, but what about that drives me, but it's like, like almost like I was like,

58:09.000 --> 58:13.280
I'm not going to watch 62, I'm going to watch 62 episodes of this Colombian Breaking Bad.

58:13.280 --> 58:15.800
But then it's like, I have to find material in it.

58:15.800 --> 58:18.040
So it's like, I'm mining and I'm watching their shirts and stuff.

58:18.040 --> 58:19.040
And I'm like, oh, that's boring.

58:19.040 --> 58:23.080
I could talk about a shirt for eight minutes, like no problem.

58:23.080 --> 58:24.880
So we've got a mind capable of that.

58:24.880 --> 58:31.600
And we've got somebody who also in the episode, not to spoil it, but you almost inexplicably

58:31.600 --> 58:40.200
focus in trying to decode my story model, you've, you choose to use this amazing song

58:40.200 --> 58:42.720
from a chorus line, the musical.

58:42.720 --> 58:43.840
Why is that your favorite song?

58:43.840 --> 58:44.840
Why and why?

58:44.840 --> 58:45.840
Which song?

58:45.840 --> 58:46.840
I feel nothing.

58:46.840 --> 58:47.840
Nothing.

58:47.840 --> 58:48.840
Yeah.

58:48.840 --> 58:49.840
Oh yeah.

58:49.840 --> 58:50.840
Like just because every day for a week.

58:50.840 --> 58:51.840
Yeah.

58:51.840 --> 58:52.840
It's a good song.

58:52.840 --> 58:58.600
Well, like it just like, I think like it, it goes back to like why, why do certain people

58:58.600 --> 59:02.960
can't sleep like overthinking people or people that obsess about stuff.

59:02.960 --> 59:06.760
And it's like, that song does have some truth in it.

59:06.760 --> 59:08.280
And then it has this like feeling for me.

59:08.280 --> 59:09.840
It's like, oh wait, I'm dead inside.

59:09.840 --> 59:13.720
Like so, so like, like I'm like, when I hear the song, I think about that.

59:13.720 --> 59:19.760
Like, and I like it better because I'm like, okay, she's singing about this surface thing.

59:19.760 --> 59:23.280
And then there's this whole other thing going on within the story of the song.

59:23.280 --> 59:28.080
And then there's like the truth behind it, like, like, like, like just whatever happened

59:28.080 --> 59:30.960
out here on the stage with the fricking haunted house.

59:30.960 --> 59:35.520
It's like, like you could start to unpack that it's like, and I mean, the fact that

59:35.520 --> 59:39.520
you talked, you text with your neighbor, that's great.

59:39.520 --> 59:47.040
She texts with me and I respond every time I said, no, don't, don't, don't be sad.

59:47.040 --> 59:48.800
It's she'll be fine.

59:48.800 --> 59:50.920
She'll be back next week.

59:50.920 --> 59:55.880
But, but, but I'm so intrigued by that because I just, you know, real quick, real quick,

59:55.880 --> 01:00:00.520
this might be, might be prickly of me to say this.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:08.080
How much zero to 100% do you think that she engaged you in that text conversation because

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.520
she thought it might parlay into being back up here?

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:15.000
I don't, I think, I think, zero percent, I think zero, I think zero percent at the

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.120
beginning and, and then 10%, 10% of the way through just like me.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.120
I don't know.

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:25.480
I was like, I like, I'm not, I'm not, I don't mean that to disparage her in any way.

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:29.160
But like, is there, is there a part of her, like, like, does she love being up here so

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:33.000
much that like, like she engages with you for that?

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.960
You know, let's let that, let's, let's, let's, let's not be addicted to dichotomy.

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.080
I mean, what are we learning with this election?

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:43.560
Like, like, like, if we, if we follow the path of good person, bad person long enough,

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:46.720
we're going to end up in a fucking desert where we're going to lose our fucking minds

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:50.600
because like, like the truth is, like, we're all just different kinds of people.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:55.880
And like, like, like, like, I just like, like, you know, is she, is she, is she a good neighbor?

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:56.880
Is she a bad neighbor?

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:57.880
Am I a bad neighbor?

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:58.880
Am I a bad person?

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.600
Like, should I let more light into my life?

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:01.760
Should I read her screenplay?

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.760
Is she an attention whore?

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.400
Is, is, is, is fame bad?

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:10.200
Is it, is, is everything, it's like these questions, like, like, like, I, my, my, my,

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:15.160
my epiphany lately in, in, in therapy and just in thinking about it and driving to work

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:18.360
with Spencer every day is just like, dichotomy is like a crutch.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:24.440
Like dichotomy is laziness, is ideological laziness, like we've talked about this, like,

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:29.080
like the idea that it's things are one thing or the other is kind of like, it's, it's an

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:33.600
addiction and it's a comfort zone and it's like, I don't know, you know, like, like,

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:38.760
I'm not saying that it's binary that she is all one or all the other, but I'm not trying

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:42.840
to high road you also, I that sounds like, I sound like I'm a little high flown saying

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:47.720
that and answered your thing, but, but I also just like, I'm like, yeah, look, I don't know,

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:50.840
he's my neighbor, Beth, like she, like, she's like a character.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:51.840
I don't know.

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:54.040
You know, Joey, let's check, check back in with you.

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.040
Did you get your tarot cards?

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.040
Joey.

01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:00.040
Oh shit.

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.040
What card is that?

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:06.000
Joey, to his credit, has sat there in graveyard silence the entire time and just totally digging

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
it.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.160
I'm very excited to be here.

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.160
Oh shit.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.400
I love you, Joey.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.200
So this is for you.

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:15.760
You are the king of cups.

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:20.360
I don't know the individual's name, but if anyone could find out who was the first person

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:26.240
to use ether to anesthetize therapeutically, that is who his past life was.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.960
Isn't Dan the king of cups?

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:31.080
I'm in the night of cups.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:34.440
Oh, that's like my favorite bugs money routine, too.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:39.640
So the ether one, so you're saying that he is the, that he's the reincarnation of the

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:43.200
person that first used ether to anesthetize.

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.200
That's right.

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:45.200
Really?

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:46.200
So does that come to you?

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:49.600
Is that some sort of Da Vinic thing that happens?

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:52.040
We have a Google search.

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:53.040
Got our fans are awesome.

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:54.040
Okay.

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:57.040
They would never steal a sign.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:01.280
Sorry, yeah, you know, but you know, I don't mean to kiss your ass, but you did notice

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:07.680
in that text conversation, I was kind of sticking up for you guys.

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:11.200
Human teeth are chloroform.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.200
Yes.

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.200
Human.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:16.080
Human teeth and chloroform.

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:22.920
It says that William Thomas Green Morton, who lived from August 9th, 1819 to July 15th,

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:29.320
1868, was an American dentist who first publicly demonstrated the use of inhaled ether as a

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.560
surgical anesthetic.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:32.560
How'd he die?

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.560
1846.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:39.640
He died on an ether bench.

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:43.400
I think he went on ether and cut his leg open and bled to death.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.400
Oh, really?

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.400
That's why I asked.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:46.400
Maybe that's chloroform.

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.960
That's my favorite scene and fear and loathing in the book by Hunter S. Thompson, where

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:53.320
he just pours ether on the floorboard of his car at the convertible, so he just wafts

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:57.520
up and he goes into circus, circus, and loses his fucking shit.

01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:58.520
All right.

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:00.040
Let's see how you do it.

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.040
Well, sorry.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.040
So back diving into...

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.040
It's 9-11.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.040
It's 9-11.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.040
It's 9-11.

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:09.600
It's the most wonderful time of the day.

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:15.320
When the planes are all falling and buildings...

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.760
Don't fucking do that.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:23.320
You cheer for 9-11 every week.

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:29.720
That song on paper, I'm only familiar with the movie, but the lyrics to that song on

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:36.280
paper make me think that that is the story of somebody who is realizing that the dichotomy

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:43.520
of feeling versus not feeling is a flawed dichotomy and that she is escaping it and realizing

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:46.120
that she can cry.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:50.620
In the end, what makes her cry is the fact that she is numb.

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:55.440
What makes her cry is her alienation.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:59.400
That is not foreign to me, and I felt like you were kind of...

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:03.200
Yeah, that song is the idea that like, don't tell me to lie.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:06.080
Don't tell me that I'm an ice cream cone.

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:09.840
Like, if you make me pretend to be an ice cream cone, I feel nothing, and then when

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:12.800
he died, she feels nothing.

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:17.240
But also, she feels nothing so passionately that maybe we need new language for feeling

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:20.640
versus not feeling, and that you don't want to rely on us.

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:24.480
Oh, you either know what an ice cream cone feels like or you're not empathic.

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:30.080
Are we talking about my girl, what is this?

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:31.080
Chorus Line.

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:32.080
Oh, Chorus Line.

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:39.120
On stage, I was with Greg Poops on stage last night, and I said a line in a dumb game,

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:41.600
and I said, who am I anyway?

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.200
Am I my resume?

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:45.400
And Greg said, am I a picture of a person I don't know?

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:50.040
And there's one girl in the balcony who was like, wow!

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.840
Because she was probably just in Chorus Line or loves that movie.

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:55.680
But those songs are really dark and really great.

01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:03.000
So have you, Drew, felt throughout your life intellectually rattling and emotionally numb?

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.840
Does that lead to insomnia?

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:12.800
Does that lead to a connection with people who are, as you say, joining you across the

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:15.080
deep dark?

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:19.360
Talk about your relationship with the universe.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:20.800
Do you think people are bad?

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:23.040
Do you hate everybody?

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:28.520
Do you look at them as like, I won't give you options, you just go.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:37.120
I think it's like, my interest in doing the podcast came out of this miserable thing.

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:41.040
When I couldn't sleep and I'd be thinking about going to school, and I went to Catholic

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:48.280
school, and me and the nuns did not get along, they just fucking hated me.

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:55.240
I think I had undiagnosed dyslexia or something, and they were like, oh no, you're just lazy.

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:59.320
You have the ability to do the work, but you choose not to.

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:03.880
So then I internalize that whatever, it's like, okay, so it's you versus me.

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:09.160
So now I know the kind of deal, like a little bit of a dichotomy, because I was like a kid.

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:12.920
These authority figures are out to get me, and I'm this kid.

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.760
And I think that just led to me trying to figure stuff out at night, like I'd be lying

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:16.760
there thinking, well, what am I going to do?

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:17.760
What am I going to say?

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:20.880
And I think I still have this, well, am I going to be a good guest when I go on harm

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:21.880
time?

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:22.880
What am I going to do?

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:25.880
And there's like, oh, let me read some more about Dan.

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:33.400
But there's another thing that's like, oh, man, calm down.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:38.280
And I don't have total access to that, except when I do the podcast, but it's like, oh yeah,

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:43.880
those nuns, like some super mellow part, like dude, you might have to recruit you as my

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:46.520
sit on my shoulder or something.

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:49.280
She'd be like, oh, you know what?

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:54.960
And I think it's like, the truth in the song, too, is that she's like, in this put-in situation,

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:59.200
she gets into this performing arts school, and it's like, oh, this is it.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:01.720
This is, I'm going to make it now.

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:05.320
And this is like this teacher, Mr. Karp, who's a dick, spoiler.

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:10.240
And he teaches the improv class or whatever, where she's supposed to feel all this stuff.

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:14.000
I'm going to make it now, not to interject, but because the idea of getting accepted to

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:20.560
a school, that comes from a place of, oh, well, these people need to be pleased.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.680
And once they're pleased, you're fucking set.

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:26.120
You're going to Hogwarts, you're going to be a wizard.

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:27.120
But then, no.

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:28.120
So anyways.

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.120
Yeah.

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:32.720
And I don't know, I was also trying to get inside your head.

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:38.360
I was like, oh, man, once I started reading about how you think about story and stuff,

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:43.200
I don't know, those things just feel like puzzles a little bit or something, and it just draws

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:51.720
me and stuff that's like, okay, this isn't just about an entertaining story.

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:56.440
Just like not being able to sleep or that scientists don't understand sleep.

01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:01.120
Just like Rick and Morty, there's way more there than you see on the first one or two

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:02.120
watch flues.

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:06.160
It's like there's something going on below the surface, and that's what people connect

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:07.160
to.

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:11.680
And in this song, what I connect to is she's like, shit, I don't care that he died.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.560
I'm in full acceptance that I feel nothing.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:15.560
I don't know.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:21.800
But the day that you say, I don't care that this person died, that can be an incredibly

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:22.800
fucking...

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:28.280
But Mr. Karpak, the teacher in that is telling all these students, pretend that you're cold

01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:30.960
and pretend that you're hot and pretend that you're this.

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:34.800
And everyone else is doing it, and she thinks they're all lying.

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:39.800
I think it's all bullshit, and when this guy that was a professional bullshit artist

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.920
dies, it doesn't mean anything to her.

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:47.520
Her identity had nothing to do with these weird tasks that she was asked to do.

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:50.160
Yeah, I took it as empowering too.

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:54.440
She didn't do this, but that she slammed the coffin, and she's like, now I'm an actor.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:55.440
Karpak off.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.440
Well, there's...

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:57.960
I mean, if you think...

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:03.280
The job of acting is a psychotic job, whether it's an audience or cameras that are staring

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:08.920
at you, you have to be equally conscious of the fact that you are faking something as

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:13.400
you are, because if you really believed you were an ice cream cone, you'd turn your back

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:18.840
to the audience for the entire show, you wouldn't hit your marks, you wouldn't remember your

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:22.360
ice cream lines.

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:26.980
There's all kinds of reasons why you also simultaneously, in order to be so immersed

01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:32.480
in all this stuff, you also have to be so hyper-conscious of where your head is, or even

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:36.080
more so with the cameras instead of the audience.

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:39.720
That's the interesting thing I think about the lyrics of that song, is that it seems

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:43.760
like it's a writer exploring actually just kind of just two different acting schools

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:48.680
and how they kind of crisscross their dichotomies, like can bisect each other to the point where

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:53.260
you go, oh yeah, okay, so you have to pick one that you're happy with, because hers turns

01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:59.240
out to be, you know what, I'm the person that's capable of forgetting what the fuck anybody

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:06.400
thinks, and that could lead to really good acting, because my calluses, my barrier that

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:12.720
I have around myself, whether I like it or not, will allow me to plow through a terrible

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:21.360
showing of Speed the Plow, even though there's three people in the audience, I don't know

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.680
why I'm going into her biography of weird timeline, but I'm just saying there's different kinds

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:30.680
of good actors, and she's confident at the time of singing that song, and what I'm

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:31.680
talking about.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:34.400
Drew, you said you had trouble sleeping yourself, right?

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.320
You have anxiety and that keeps you up?

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:37.320
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:42.600
Does you doing this podcast kind of busy up your day and occupy a part of your mind that

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:47.520
allows you to rest, or do you still go to sleep with the same trouble that you're trying

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:49.520
to assuage in other people?

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:54.400
I think it makes me more aware, and I think the thing about the podcast is like, oh, that

01:11:54.400 --> 01:12:00.120
I'm not the only person suffering from that, so I mean, that's the main message I want

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:05.920
to get across to the podcast, is like, okay, I'm not going to come to your house and read

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.320
you a story, or...

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:08.320
To steal your tarp.

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:09.320
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:18.680
I've wrapped myself in the tarp, but that, like, not being able to sleep sucks, and since

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:23.520
I can relate to that, I may not understand what other people are going through that can't

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:25.280
sleep, but like that.

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:28.680
You've had people say to you that this really helps.

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:30.680
That must feel great.

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.680
I'm dead inside, though, so it's kind of...

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:33.680
Oh, you feel nothing.

01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:34.920
You feel nothing.

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:40.840
But it's almost like if you look at your emotional connection to them as like water, then this

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:44.000
would be like infusing it with like a fruit, a fruit flavor.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.800
Oh, yeah, like fruit flavored water?

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:46.800
Yeah, like a...

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:47.800
Like with a little fruit in there?

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:50.920
It's almost like a...

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:51.920
It sounds like you're talking about...

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:52.960
It sounds like a dream.

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:55.200
It sounds like you're talking about hint water.

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:56.200
Oh.

01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:00.920
Oh, shit, that's something I have experience with personally.

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:03.280
I had the apple flavored one.

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.280
You did?

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:05.280
Oh, yeah.

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.280
No, it was great.

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:09.120
Spencer, tell me about your personal experience with hint water, apple flavor.

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:11.640
I had the apple flavored one.

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:13.560
No, seriously, it was great.

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:14.560
I had it.

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:15.560
They sent it to us.

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:16.560
It tasted like apples.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:17.560
Oh, boy.

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:20.920
I had it.

01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:22.880
I had a watermelon one.

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:29.880
It's like watermelons, real fruit flavor, not this, you know, fake, preservative, unnatural

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:30.880
flavor stuff.

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:34.640
It's not like water that's had like some syrupy goo added to it.

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:35.960
No, it tastes like...

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:39.640
That's actually the cool part, and this is a real advertisement because I'm trying to

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:45.880
convince you guys of something, but it actually is cool that it's like a fruit flavored beverage

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:52.600
that's not overbearing in any way, exactly as refreshing as water, but just has the

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:55.320
a lot of fruit.

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:56.320
Wasn't it?

01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:02.080
Spencer, I mean, I don't want to come off like I'm reading the highlighted portions

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:06.600
of this piece of paper that I have here, but Spencer, it sounds like you just ad-libbed

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:11.360
the intro with the personalized story that will resonate with our audience.

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:15.440
And I will add to that.

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:18.520
I agree.

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:25.080
When I tasted the hint water, I had got the distinct impression that it was invented by

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:28.320
a woman that had just had her fourth child.

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:29.320
You're talking about Cara Gold.

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:30.320
Cara Gold.

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:31.320
You're talking about Cara Gold.

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:32.320
Of course.

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:33.320
And not because I'm reading this off of the paper.

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:34.820
No, because she's the hint water person.

01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:37.760
I personally invested in her story.

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:42.920
Not because they highlighted everything you have to say, and then it's at the following

01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:47.560
points, and it includes her entire biography of having four children and then taking...

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:51.920
She got sick of diet soda because it didn't have that crisp, refreshing water taste I

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.640
was telling you about in that great intro.

01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:54.640
She was bored.

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:56.400
She was bored with the liquids in her life.

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:57.960
Water is boring, Nan.

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:00.440
Water is boring, but what are my options?

01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:01.440
Hint water.

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.440
That's the whole point of what we're doing.

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:03.440
You've got to eat that mic, Joe.

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:04.440
Eat that mic.

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:05.440
Hint water.

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:07.440
Wait, Jeff, you're not on mic.

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:08.440
You're off mic.

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:09.920
Where can I get hint water?

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:10.920
Where can I get some of this water?

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:11.920
Oh, shit.

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:12.920
Where can you get it?

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:13.920
Well, it's funny.

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:21.560
You can get a single variety pack shipped right to your door, including three bottles

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:26.120
of each of Hint Water's four most popular flavors.

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.760
Want to guess what the four most popular flavors are?

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:29.760
Pregnancy.

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:30.760
Diet Coke.

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:31.760

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:32.760
No.

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:33.760
Apple.

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:34.760

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:36.760
Crisp apple.

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:37.760
Watermelon.

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:38.760
Watermelon.

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:39.760
Oh, watermelon.

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:40.760
Pineapple and blackberry.

01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:41.760
Normally $24.

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:45.160
Probably $15 if you go to drink.com slash Harmontown.

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:46.720
I'm dying with that.

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:29.720
Drink.

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:30.720
Drink.

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:31.720
Drink.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:32.720
Drink.

01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:33.720
Drink.

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:34.720
Drink.

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:35.720
Drink.

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:36.720
Drink.

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:37.720
Drink.

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:38.720
Drink.

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:42.900
happy to see it when we see it, but until then, bite your time.

01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:46.340
Scientists are working right now to find other planets that not only have liquid water, but

01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:48.000
have liquid water with flavor.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Fused with fruits.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:54.900
Fused with fruits, because we found, there's so many planets right now that probably are

01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:58.340
in the Goldilocks zone where there would be liquid water, but we think because we live

01:16:58.340 --> 01:17:03.940
in such an infinite galaxy and universe that some of them are going to be blackberry flavored.

01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:08.880
And they have, they have actually found a lot of planets with flavored water, but they

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:13.680
all contain preservatives or sugars, so it's like worthless.

01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:14.680
And calories.

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:15.680
The calories are crazy.

01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:16.680
It's crazy.

01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:17.680
What's the point?

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:18.680
Yeah.

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:24.460
But until we have the ability to travel to these distant watermelon and pineapple flavored

01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:25.460
planets.

01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:26.460
Right.

01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:29.700
You can just go to, drink H-I-N-T.

01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:30.900
They delivered your house.

01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:34.860
They fucking bring in how heavy water is, you don't have to carry it.

01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:37.420
All right, I think that's all the points.

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:41.620
I actually, I actually heard they found a planet where it, what it did have no sugar

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:48.620
and all that stuff, but also then they passed it by because it, it didn't offer the discount.

01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:50.820
Oh yeah.

01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:51.820
That you get when you.

01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:52.820
Yeah.

01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:53.820
Because it goes more than $24.

01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:55.820
No, because that planet still charged $24.

01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:59.140
$24, which is not a bad price for, like, good water.

01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:02.900
You go to drinkhint.com at Harmontown, you're, you're, you're saving.

01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:03.900
You're $9.

01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:04.900
You're an astronaut.

01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:05.900
Yeah.

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:06.900
Financially.

01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:12.180
No, you're, you're the, you're the Neil Armstrong of, of water excitement.

01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:14.140
Water's boring.

01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:15.140
Not anymore.

01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:16.140
Hint water.

01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:20.340
I like, I like that hint water, hint, hint water.

01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:21.340
Hint water.

01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:24.300
Hint water is just putting a fucking straight up hit on water.

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:27.260
They're trying to take down big, big water.

01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:31.780
They're just really biting the hand that feeds you when you're hint water.

01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:32.780
I mean, yeah.

01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:39.300
If you look at the ingredients of hint water, a watermelon genetically is 99% water and

01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:41.860
you don't hear watermelons going, fuck this fucking water.

01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:45.300
So you are, we're water.

01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:46.300
We are water.

01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:47.300
Yeah.

01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:49.420
We biologically, we lunged ourselves onto the shore.

01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:55.380
We are, our, our plasma is really identical to, to sea water.

01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:58.500
It's like a scuba tank that we brought with us.

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:02.420
We think, oh, you get stabbed in a Halloween movie and there's blood coming out.

01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:03.420
Oh, that's gross.

01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:04.420
It's just sea water.

01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:05.420
Joey.

01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:07.300
It's like a, it's like a, it's like a scuba tank.

01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:11.500
Could you pick a tarot card for what you think the reincarnation of hint water or who, who

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:14.020
hint water is the reincarnation of?

01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:16.180
Well, uh, Cara Goldman's past life.

01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:17.180
Is that?

01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:18.180
Cara Goldman.

01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:19.180
Yes.

01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:20.180
Okay.

01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:21.180
Wow.

01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:22.180
Golden.

01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:23.180
Golden.

01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:24.180
There we go.

01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:25.180
Yes.

01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:30.260
Like, sing, golly, golly, golly.

01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:32.500
Please don't make me drink my last water.

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:35.720
I just, I felt like the whole time we went, that Joey's been up here, that an awesome

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:40.220
rendition of Jesus Christ superstar was just about to break out.

01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:42.380
Are you a fan of musicals, uh, Drew?

01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:43.380
Joey.

01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:44.420
Well, I'm sorry.

01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:45.420
Why?

01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:52.400
I mean, that one just hit home, like, because I was actually in, in a car with somebody

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:56.820
listening to that song and I'm like oh shit I feel nothing like and I was like

01:19:56.820 --> 01:20:06.200
oh man like so it kind of cut deep I guess so if I said I love you I'd say

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:15.980
oh man I'm hungry like you semi-jungly said that you're you're you're you're

01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:21.380
dead inside that you have a numbness to you I mean is it true or is it just you

01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:26.120
kind of comedically deflecting stuff I would say it's an issue I have probably

01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:32.960
like it's because you have a history of not you what you've noticed while you're

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:38.920
taking data is that the responses that you're capable of giving are are being

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:42.560
received by other people you're getting you're getting returned data from them

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:49.960
that's saying that response was less than different than more than I expected

01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:53.440
and you are keeping score for yourself and you're going like yeah I'm not that

01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:57.880
good at this people thing yeah I mean I think like with that not to go back to

01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:02.400
the Halloween side but it's like oh is there a way Dan's supposed to reply to

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:07.360
that first text like and it's like and then you're like oh well should I I'm

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:11.760
gonna I'm glad you just be yourself like yeah I just fucking went to just locked

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:17.880
horns with her like a fucking ram and then she's like twisting like oh shit

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:24.000
who's gonna win like but but yeah I just I well I just like it's this idea of

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.120
dead inside like I don't know when we had Steve Silverman on who like we wrote

01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:31.800
this amazing book called Neurotribes which is about neurodiversity doesn't

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:37.040
have to do with like oh you have Asperger's you are autistic you are in

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:41.640
the spec like like it's just like like like like can we embrace this concept of

01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:48.000
neurodiversity where there's it's like now that the internet's here and we're a

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.520
more text-based society what we're I think we're coming into a realization

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:59.880
that oh a lot of humanity doesn't necessarily have this like total average

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:03.280
facility there's almost artificial construct of normality when you run

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:07.240
into somebody in public and you oh you're learning their names and you have

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:12.040
like people trouble with names and faces and nervous and I don't know like I I

01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:19.480
just like it like like this idea I feel like the idea of being dead inside the

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:23.040
idea that oh this person doesn't doesn't have empathy and all that stuff like it's

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:27.800
it's like it's archaic language like it's it kind of it's it's problematic as

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:32.320
the kids would say like because it's it takes you into a zone of you're either

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:37.920
Chattner or your or your Leonard Nimoy like you're I don't know why I use the

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:44.160
actors names yeah you're either Kirk or your spot like you're either like oh I'm

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:47.680
gonna fly in through the windows and fuck a green lady and like like like that's

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:52.400
how I saw I saved the universe with my dick because I love feeling and that's

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:56.480
and then or you're either that or your spot and like I don't understand and it's

01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:01.360
like the whole like nerd face thing of like a spot you have feelings and stuff

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:05.040
it's like come on what what what is a feeling what does it even mean like like

01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:09.880
you at the end of your podcast you sit and thank a thousand people people

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:13.920
anybody who tweets you you like people they're messaging you and going oh my

01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:18.480
band's playing and like you you you you sit there and like go go like oh you go

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:24.520
go see this guy's band and like all this shit you're pathetic you're a sappy

01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:30.000
sock it's a good thing I'm dead inside you're dripping in feelings like just

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.440
like just from a different angle you just have to get the glint like you're

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:37.600
because it's a it's a it's a responsibility to other people I'm drunk

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:41.000
yeah I think what you're like I get drunk at this point they think about the

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.160
internet is like that it gets all this like you're seeing with the neuro

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:49.680
diversity it's like oh wait like I'm not the only freak out there like I guess I

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:56.560
would classify myself as a spaz if we're in the Ferris Bueller spectrum of like

01:23:56.560 --> 01:24:01.080
the social disorders but like then you realize like like I started the

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:04.280
podcast and I was like huh I wonder if there's anybody out there that wants some

01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:09.480
weird-ass bedtime stories and then I was like oh wait there are and then it was

01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:13.600
like then they then they started telling people and it's like I guess what

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:18.240
you're saying is like I can hear that because it's like oh yeah like who gives

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:22.200
shit how like I can't respond perfectly to everything like yeah just because

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:25.320
that's not just because if somebody came over for a cup of sugar you wouldn't

01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:28.600
like say the right thing isn't the right queue it doesn't mean you it's like no

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:31.560
I'm fucking busy with my other thing that I connect with people through a

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:35.760
different channel like that's what a painter is or a furniture maker or what

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:40.040
do they call the guys that bring the mail a mail bringer

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:45.200
yeah but I think those postal workers there's an expression going postal it

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:52.880
means to to give your your feelings a different outlet yeah but like with the

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:57.560
dichotomy thing like if you only can fit into these two boxes I think that's

01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:00.720
like half the reason why everybody feels so alone I mean other than the shit you

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:04.400
think about when you're lying in bed like okay but but like then if you're like

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:08.920
oh wait like yeah there's a ton of other people that fit into this box with me or

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:12.040
the box doesn't have walls or whatever but then when you're like oh do you like

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:16.400
the guy with the bad hair like are you for America are you against America it's

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:23.200
like what the fuck like I'd like the idea that he was like I find myself alternating

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:27.680
like equally offended the idea that that he represents bad people and shit

01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:31.720
like like because it's like fuck you he's a shitty bad person like he's bad at

01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:35.920
being shitty like I get mad I'm like he's a bad Nazi he's a bad fascist like

01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:40.280
like Hitler would have done way better but that but by now like it's like he

01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:43.000
doesn't even know what he's doing like you can't even do it right like you're

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.600
bad Hitler I want to like tweet at him you're bad Hitler wrong you're a bad

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:52.680
wrong yeah well such a nasty man

01:25:52.680 --> 01:26:00.440
nasty man such a nasty man but but the it's funny like the dichotomy thing

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:04.920
though I would have been a great Hitler I would have been great I have so many

01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:09.720
people right now right now if you if you go on all the I would build a wall out

01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:15.080
of Jews Hitler I've killed more Jews I'm killing more Jews the Slavs would have

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:18.960
paid for all of the Nazis say I'm the best they say I'm a better Nazi than a

01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:24.080
Nazi yes I have all of the you're gonna do a great great Stalin grab would have

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:28.280
fell to fall so fast your head would have spun it's gonna be true it's true

01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:32.720
believe it's true half Reich it's gonna be I would have so many rights there

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:40.520
would have been a million Reichs each Reich would have lasted for 10 million years

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:49.480
we're gonna be we're gonna invade China they have a great wall but the it's

01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:54.200
funny how sometimes dichotomy you can't just count it either it's not as easy as

01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:59.360
saying oh it's like gluten so let's do away with dichotomy we use it all the

01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:03.240
time to get to the bottom of shit it's like well look let's step back from this

01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:06.120
and look at one of two paths here either we're gonna do this or we're gonna do

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:10.560
that it's such a healthy thing to do most half of the time probably half of

01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:14.520
the time and then and then the probably half the time probably most of the time

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:19.800
probably the best times you're either building a wall and you're not building

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:24.440
wall but but the the other half of the time it's like I was sitting there like

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:30.280
I was watching Cody like crumbled to the floor during the debates and scream when

01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:34.760
he said nasty woman like like when he at all of the things it's like it's like

01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:40.880
nails on a chalkboard then I'm noticing myself going like baby he's not gonna

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:46.760
win and then she goes like I know and then I'm thinking like oh well why are

01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:52.120
you fucking being dramatic then and then and then later on she's like upset

01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:55.320
again and I go like I thought you said you knew he wasn't gonna win and she's

01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:58.720
like I just said that because you made me feel stupid earlier I'm like I wasn't

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:01.080
trying to make you feel stupid I was trying to make you feel safe I don't

01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:05.040
know that he's not gonna win I'm just being a man I'm just being a man I was

01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:09.000
like and it was like crazy meta thing like I was being a man I was trying to

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.240
like pat her on the back during the debates and tell her the orange man's

01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:20.160
not gonna win like that's my job as a man during debates and it's like I was

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:23.160
like so you then you go outward on that Fibonacci curve and you go like well

01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:33.400
okay so like somewhere along it's just like well when he's not gonna win and

01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:39.560
and he can't win and and and that doesn't but and but here's the what do

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:45.440
you want a five-party system you got it you probably stay pretty apolitical

01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:48.240
also what do you do about tonality that's what I was gonna ask you it's

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:53.280
tough because you had you had you had to put a warning on your episode it was a

01:28:53.280 --> 01:29:00.120
hairpin turn man well hairpin turn next to the LeBray at Tarpet everyone

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:07.240
very everyone very values it bigly but you you had to put a little swear words

01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:14.800
warning on your episode of mine what how do you how do you freely like just be

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:18.960
yourself and then like where do you stand in terms of why aren't you just

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:25.280
saying shit and fucking yeah it's like like it's tough like not being able like

01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:28.720
it's like okay try to avoid talking about the election all because people are

01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:32.120
gonna go apeshit like it like I guess it's like keeping in mind somebody's

01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:36.520
lying in bed and like sometimes it's gonna be like a grandmotherly like woman

01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:40.120
and like I always that's why I like take so much time to kind of explain that the

01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:43.720
podcast is kind of weird because I always like think of this like this little

01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:48.120
old lady putting on like her shawl and putting on well she told me to listen to

01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:54.080
the podcast and then it's like what the hell is he talking about like why is he

01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:58.680
love abortion so much yeah I'm trying to get some sleep do you do a little like

01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:02.720
Proviso at the beginning like you do like do an explainer at the top of each

01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:06.640
episode or you kind of just get right into business it's kind of like there's

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:11.920
like this 12-minute intro at least where it's almost like its own show where I

01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:16.680
just like ramble on and on like okay this is the podcast but you sleep it's

01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:21.800
like a like I was thinking about water the other day and and I was drinking a

01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:25.800
water oh wait sorry I'm in the middle of podcast intro and then isn't water

01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:34.040
too boring I mean I was wishing I had like apple flavored water can we lower

01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:37.720
the lights for a minute and just have you just like like relax and have you

01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:42.840
just treat us to the cadence that you usually use I just want to give people a

01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:48.440
taste also everybody take your shirts off do we wait it's too late to ask for

01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:51.120
any like wind chimes back there anything you don't usually you don't use

01:30:51.120 --> 01:31:00.280
anything like that 30 seconds for wind chimes 29 28 well this brings up a good

01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:05.080
thing like with wind chimes it's like when you go to a wind chimes store do

01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:09.800
you think about like what's your favorite bamboo wind chime what's your favorite

01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:15.400
wind chimes store in town I like wind chimes wind chimes wind chimes like I

01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:19.480
don't know and then it's like you want a bigger small or the ones that are like a

01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:22.720
xylophone because then it's like well then when that person comes home they're

01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:26.560
gonna wrap running their hands across the stupid xylophone and it's gonna drive

01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:32.040
me nuts so maybe I'll just get the bam but I hate those bamboo wind chimes and

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:37.760
like like I try to lie there and think about yeah the wind chimes I used to

01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:43.520
hear when I was on that dock that one time like lying there on that dock the

01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:50.760
dock was bouncing up and down and I was staring at the clouds and I was just

01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:55.200
I was like man like those wind chimes are gonna wake my dad up he's gonna go

01:31:55.200 --> 01:32:01.600
apeshit so I got off the dock and walked up to the house and I was walking up the

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:05.720
dock and I stopped at the dock and then I looked in the water there was a fish

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:13.080
there and I was looking at the fish and I remember that time that guy was down

01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:20.840
there at the bottom way down all the way down and then I was thinking like how

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:24.520
did he get on that spaceship that one time like because I was watching that

01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:31.200
one where he's on the spaceship and his mask was different and like I was I was

01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:36.840
like man like how do you get a new mask like is that like was that some kind of

01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:42.880
interstellar shit like and then it was interstellar like what if what if he got

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:50.160
sucked into a black hole and then and then he'd like and then my dad dropped

01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:55.400
his beer in the back and I said oh shit better be quiet and not talk over these

01:32:55.400 --> 01:33:03.200
wind chimes but I was like I was thinking about like a guy was his name

01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:06.400
his name like see this would be the pack as I couldn't say Freddie one for

01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:13.280
Jason that's it Voorhees like if I've known any Voorhees before because

01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:23.760
Voorhees is a great Voorhees like Voorhees I started hearing things and then I

01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:30.520
started I started feeling angry like it was the wind chimes they kept going

01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:35.760
ringing over and over I'm never going to sleep again

01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:52.760
This is a nightmare. I never get to kill people. He usually works in a room.

01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:59.360
I just picture a lot of grandmother's just wide awake. This is this is the end.

01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:03.600
But is there a guiding principle that keeps you from as you said when you

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:08.480
picture that old woman with the shawl which which which which let's use here

01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:11.640
as a symbol of like that's a reason to not get political that's a reason to not

01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:17.120
use profanity how is that what what compass do you is there like a guiding

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:22.040
principle that keeps you clear of all of that no and like I find like using

01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:26.160
perfect like I guess I struggle with that because it's like I think some

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:30.840
people when you swear it makes them feel more connected like like this vanilla

01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:36.680
icing of everything like actually I think excludes people or me giving

01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:40.560
everything normalcy it's like oh my podcast is not normal like it's not

01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:45.400
like it's like I struggle with like oh people like I can't believe you swore

01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:49.160
I'm never listening again and then I feel ashamed or whatever but then I'm

01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:53.520
like well like I think there's four probably four thousand people that feel

01:34:53.520 --> 01:35:00.160
like oh finally someone's swearing on a sleep so in your in your day-to-day life

01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:04.960
the person that you are if I'm hanging out with you and how often are you

01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:09.200
saying the word fuck shit and whatnot because I'm saying it every other word

01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:14.720
I mean probably pretty often like I mean so that's the confusing thing to me is

01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:17.760
that you're being yourself like you're you're you're going to the you're going

01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:21.800
down the mine that that I'm going down but you're somehow but you're kind of

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:25.960
putting one drew more of like a like not not a character but you're going into a

01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:31.280
certain mode where you're like you if you had to put on the hat Dan of let's

01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:35.680
make everybody feel relaxed you wouldn't you know you would you have kids I have

01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:39.400
one kid yeah and so is it possible that maybe you're accessing that lobe where

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:44.000
you're like she's listening or is it your daughter I think it's like part of

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:49.520
it is like my internal critic is so loud and powerful and like so even when I

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:54.000
sit down to record the show like there's that that narrative track going like

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:59.520
don't fuck this up like like like so it's like I try to like just get to this

01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:04.120
it's it unfortunately the podcast doesn't track like translate to my

01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:08.720
regular life where I can be like oh man go ahead and cut me off like like but

01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:14.400
like so like to counteract my critic it's like I just it's the same part that

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:18.160
people fall asleep to I think because they're critic or that aggressive part

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:21.280
of themselves is what's poking at them like as soon as you get in bed it's like

01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:25.360
why didn't you get this done today why why why did you piss your pants like you

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:30.280
know it's like and then you're like like like the person starts to like buy

01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:33.600
into that story and they just start listening at story so it's like I'm

01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:36.640
there and I'm like well here's another story you can listen to it doesn't

01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:39.880
really make a lot of sense it doesn't really go anywhere and I think like at

01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:43.120
the same time I'm like trying to tell I'm like listen dude we're just making a

01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:47.000
podcast put people asleep here like this isn't like a fourth draft to something

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:51.960
like when I asked you when I said earlier that must make you feel good that

01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:55.320
you help people deal with their insomnia or go to sleep when you said no I feel

01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:58.240
nothing but like do you feel like this is a benevolent thing you're doing or

01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:02.040
not not why you're doing it is it's more just you getting something off of your

01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:05.920
chest or do you how important is it that you might be helping other strangers up

01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:10.520
I mean it could be impact unpacked by like psychologists like I think part of

01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:15.880
it is like really narcissistic like that when I was a kid I couldn't sleep and I

01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:20.520
lied there in bed miserable and I didn't feel like I was like alright you're on

01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:25.320
your own to deal with this and I can't go back in time to fix that you know so I

01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:29.040
think like if like a cold-ass psychiatrist would be like oh well

01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:33.080
that's just what you're trying to do just trying to go back but I guess like it

01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:38.040
is cool like if I hear from somebody like that has like PTSD like from some

01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:41.000
something that happened I guess I do feel stuff sometimes like it's like holy

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:46.320
shit like this silly thing I'm doing can help distract you from something that's

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:50.600
horrific or does that warm you up a little bit like how do you

01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:56.040
absorb that that compliment or do you just stick it in the drawer somewhere and

01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:59.000
think deal up deal with it later yeah I guess I try to put it in like this

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:05.400
basket of like okay this this is this is this real like am I really helping

01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:08.720
people I was just putting it in a bin that's like okay so that's like a

01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:13.320
firewood pile like called I won't get kicked out of society for that amount

01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:18.800
of time yeah every time someone writes and says like I you helped because this

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:22.760
feely feely thing and then I got like a good so you'll have my back when they're

01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:28.040
about to throw me off a cliff it is really weird like like from Harmontown

01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:31.800
and from like like doing other comedy shows like who's lying like people walk

01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:36.120
up and they say hey like it's really common like strangely common that people

01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:39.760
come up and say like you helped me through a really hard time like I was

01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:44.640
sick or I was in hospital or my mother was going through a thing like and

01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:48.520
people have they like these really intense connections to the stupid thing

01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:51.480
that we're like I mean and not that this is stupid but it is stupid like we're

01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:55.040
just words it's irresponsible and we don't think about it we just show up

01:38:55.040 --> 01:39:00.240
half drunk and do this thing but but people like have these weird connections

01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:04.120
to it and when they say you really helped me through some major shit and my

01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:09.280
instinct is to go you gotta get out more like and deflect that but really

01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:14.560
that's like that's a major thing to unload but it's also it also doesn't

01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:19.800
you can't like translate it in anything that starts with your value like I

01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:25.080
always I've come to look at it like if you were in a pool and people are just

01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:30.160
grabbing you that's a bad example because someone's gonna drown but but like if

01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:33.640
you're in the dark or everyone's on ecstasy it's a confusing party you're

01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:38.620
in a hey maze or something like somebody somebody grabbing you and saying I'm so

01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:45.000
glad you're here I'm so glad I ran into you I remember you from before by the

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:50.120
entrance to the hey maze and and I was with my girlfriend I don't know if you

01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:55.080
remember her but I lost her and like I just seeing you like reminds me but I

01:39:55.080 --> 01:40:01.120
do you kind of like you you were like oh so we are catchers in the ride I didn't

01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:06.480
read the book I tried to make this I just I got a hundred on the test and

01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:10.680
it's just like click on alienation yeah I got it but but but I think it's

01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:14.400
something about that like it's like like like like you're running into each

01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:19.600
other and people are expressing that like it's not it's not oh you're you did

01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:23.520
something good you like your snake oil is better than other snake oil it's like

01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:28.080
oh when you put yourself out there when you get onto the dance floor even if

01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:33.560
you're doing a silly dance even if you're that sooner or later you get to

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:38.280
experience the sensation of dancing with other people that they will have

01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:43.120
someone will go yay I like I like you're I'm so glad you're out here because

01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:47.920
these weddings suck yeah I mean I think it's like the other thing I mean it

01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:51.360
makes me think of two things one is like also connects you like you're like well

01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:54.000
shit I know what it's like to lie there I might not know what it's like to have

01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:01.080
PTSD but I know what it's like to lie there over you will now yeah like I

01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:08.760
peteed him but all right I you tea tea you pre-teed him TB TB you pre-teed his

01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:13.080
SD all right TB TB teed we'll figure it out later but I mean the other thing is

01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:16.400
people don't get credit for being nice like it's like all the people that say

01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:20.320
thank you for shit like everybody's always heaping on and I mean I guess I'm a

01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:24.160
cynical person too but it's like I've been blown away like you're saying that

01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:29.760
people will come up to like that people are thankful like it's like no no when

01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:36.520
we look at all this election shit and like oh how do you think about her like

01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:40.240
it's like oh wait there's tons of people out there and they might even be people

01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:45.160
that believe in the crazy like the other stuff but it's like that are saying like

01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:51.760
thank you like I don't know it is definitely like making the show has made

01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:56.240
me maybe like a softer person or been like man there is some good in the world

01:41:56.240 --> 01:42:01.360
despite like like presuming there isn't or whatever I don't know when you do one

01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:06.160
do you have that kind of sense of like some sort of sense of accomplishment or

01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:10.440
just or just or is it simply just like oh I did one thing today that was semi or

01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:14.800
possibly productive and so like I can rest a little easier it's more like I

01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:21.240
guess if I have like one out of every 30 episodes or 40 episodes and I like I

01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:26.920
feel like like damn that came out good even if it's not good like I don't know

01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:31.200
like once every 40 episodes I'll have one done I'll be like oh like that felt

01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:35.080
really good like and I don't care like I can make it another 40 episodes I'm

01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:40.800
curious though because like I get so I'm so into detail like almost to the point

01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:43.720
of distraction that I don't know that I would fall asleep I think that I was

01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:48.480
like where's he going this or even if you're not anywhere that's okay like

01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:51.480
that's I think that's part of the interesting thing is that as we said

01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:57.040
the beginning if a doctor tells you to chew on a straw like the straw chewing

01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:01.080
is just gonna it sends you into this weird thing and like he's like hey

01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:06.440
listen by the way if you also if you find yourself very focused on what I'm

01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:09.520
saying you know that's okay too you're not doing it wrong you may fall asleep

01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:15.640
to something else Joey are you a good sleeper are you are you a oh yes I I

01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:19.280
sleep all the time

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:28.600
there's the best well I think if we can pack both into five minutes each I would

01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:33.080
say one thing I would like to try is Joey could you give us a tarot reading

01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:39.400
for next week's episode I guess do you ever do you ever do you do am I abusing

01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:45.720
you by asking you to pre-cog like is that no I'm sure that the spirits are

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:55.920
willing you know so good with with spirits here's a cynical question Joey

01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:59.680
while you're going through that yeah your positivity which you seem to exude

01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:09.760
oh thank you I knew you're gonna say that it's not an act at all now I'm

01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:14.800
being dichotomy guy like this is like you're not pushing down some other

01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:19.920
like rage part of yourself or are you actually this this groovy like for real

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:31.760
oh I'm a I'm a good Mormon boy that's that's a thing right the Mormons I went

01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:34.120
to high school with with the coolest like they were like they seemed to be the

01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:40.240
most well adjusted like they like their families and shit no yeah that's that's

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:44.720
definitely part of it and there are a couple weird ones yeah well no

01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:54.200
definitely there are the weird ones so so being being nice is is a virtue but

01:44:54.200 --> 01:45:04.480
being someone who likes people is a gift and so if you like people it's easy to

01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:12.400
be nice yeah there you are but liking people is a skill oh well because I

01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:17.440
like people I like strangers but also I can be really misanthropic like like

01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:21.520
like the flip of a coin like like like people can be like when I'm driving

01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:25.240
everyone's an enemy and then but then I could be at the airport and just be in

01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:30.520
certain mood where I'm very philanthropic and really into everybody but do you go

01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:33.240
through that too are you are you do you have you mastered a skill where you can

01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:49.400
like your equanimous to just all things at all times well cannabis helps I want

01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:55.360
you to have a podcast because your voice is soothing as fuck we have the

01:45:55.360 --> 01:46:01.800
pulpit it's just a you know something we're doing in Utah we've had like 20

01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:06.520
episodes and and we're so excited to have earth shine Jane on this oh yeah so

01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:14.520
we we get into all kinds of fun little esoteric things that may inadvertently

01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:21.000
put people to sleep but we would encourage anybody to just keep a dream

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:25.320
journal about what they dream about after they listen to the podcast because we

01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:29.600
need as many insights as possible because we're trying to predict to the end

01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:40.040
of the world and and hence the tarot and I don't really have a a trained use of

01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:46.120
these cards but oh good okay yeah that's that's the last thing we would have

01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:56.320
wanted just gets in the way of the way the education the educational

01:46:56.320 --> 01:47:01.400
inhibit the genius that's that's that's exactly so we'll let them fall where they

01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:03.880
may

01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:12.040
are you on the floor yeah they just kind of stayed in a pile so we'll choose that

01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:16.880
indicates well see now if you hadn't told me I would have thought you'd

01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:30.280
studied this your whole life so and you had asked me earlier about the creator

01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:42.160
of hint water and once again that's Kara golden yes yes so the card that came

01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:49.400
up is queen of cups so compliment nice to your car and get that hint water

01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:54.560
portion that's right so you're probably gonna mention hint water again is what

01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:59.280
the cards are saying that's that's what I'm getting oh really yes and it looks

01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:06.840
like the past life of Kara golden is Pamela Goldman Smith the creator of the

01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:23.520
tarot deck because I think I forgot to take this part out then your card is

01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:30.360
Joker my card is Hoyle's rules of poker right show has just become in a good way

01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:35.760
it's just become Carson we're just a guy with a lizard's coming out next to

01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:46.800
Joan Embry is gonna come out or a lady with a lizard nice save you can you're

01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:51.160
getting so good at these thank you after thoughts yes these I call them cap

01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:57.560
doffers I'm learning now our president's gonna be a space lady and I'm

01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:01.800
gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna add or maybe it's a lady yet to the end of every

01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:07.080
expression I guess all right well so then I guess the last thing to do is to

01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:13.480
try to do if we can possibly accomplish it what we do is like a sleep a sleepy

01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:19.640
rap and then but then the bridge is like and then if we can is there any way to

01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:25.800
go from the rap beat to then the and then the wind chime silence and let and

01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:32.160
let and let drew just feel like so I go so I do some rapping and then and then I

01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:37.040
and then it goes into wind chimes and and drew like talks for a little bit

01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:41.760
probably like about what I rapped about and then I and then it goes back into me

01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:52.600
rapping and so on until 10 p.m. can I lie on the floor that's perfect yeah I

01:49:52.600 --> 01:50:03.160
think it I think it would be rude of us to not let you do that I don't know how

01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:07.560
I expected him to lie on the floor but it wasn't that

01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:19.600
right absolutely yeah yeah and and and you were pleasantly surprised right like

01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:22.840
like you didn't know it was gonna be that adorable and take up that little space

01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:26.920

01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:03.640
different guy I'm Sleepy Jim and I'll tell you why when he was born he was a

01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:08.560
juvenile offender and I used to hang out with him and play defender in his

01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:12.360
parents basement and then we were united at the soul and now I follow him

01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:17.640
around and try to keep him on a roll but he victimizes people he stands in

01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:22.680
their backyards and looks in their windows and it's creep so I try to

01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:28.440
counsel him sort of like a sponsor in AA if that makes you understand it this

01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:34.720

01:58:37.660 --> 01:58:41.660
and then Drew's gonna do his part.

01:58:41.660 --> 01:58:45.660
Again, so I'm just gonna do a couple of bars.

We don't serve breakfast, Sleepy Rapper.

01:58:48.660 --> 01:58:50.660
Go back to sleep.

01:58:52.660 --> 01:58:54.660
Serial pillows.

01:58:54.660 --> 01:58:57.660
I like to rap about sleepy pillows.

01:58:57.660 --> 01:59:00.660
It doesn't matter if I rap good or bad,

01:59:00.660 --> 01:59:02.660
cause now Drew's taking over.

01:59:02.660 --> 01:59:04.660
These are what I had for breakfast.

01:59:04.660 --> 01:59:06.660
The pancakes and blueberries.

01:59:06.660 --> 01:59:09.660
I fucked your mama cause her pussy was hairy,

01:59:09.660 --> 01:59:12.660
but I'm not judging her for that.

01:59:12.660 --> 01:59:15.660
There's no body shaming that happens here.

01:59:15.660 --> 01:59:18.660
That's not it. That's not gay.

01:59:18.660 --> 01:59:22.660
Sleeping with the ladies driving in his little car,

01:59:22.660 --> 01:59:25.660
peeping in windows every place,

01:59:25.660 --> 01:59:28.660
but he's gonna call up to your window and say,

01:59:28.660 --> 01:59:31.660
little buddy, hey, wait, wait.

01:59:31.660 --> 01:59:34.660
He's fine sleeping. He's not peeping.

01:59:34.660 --> 01:59:37.660
He's got his little car and he's driving down the street,

01:59:37.660 --> 01:59:39.660
driving down the street.

01:59:39.660 --> 01:59:41.660
It's just peeping in windows,

01:59:41.660 --> 01:59:44.660
driving down the car, driving down the car.

01:59:44.660 --> 01:59:46.660
And then he says, well, let me turn here.

01:59:46.660 --> 01:59:48.660
That's my car.

01:59:48.660 --> 01:59:50.660
Thank you for coming to Harlem Town.

01:59:50.660 --> 01:59:52.660
Going to sleep.

01:59:54.660 --> 01:59:58.660
Let's hear it for Joey, the reincarnated Joseph Smith from Provo.

02:00:02.660 --> 02:00:04.660
Spencer Crittenden.

02:00:06.660 --> 02:00:08.660
Drew Ackerman.

02:00:09.660 --> 02:00:11.660
MC Sleepy.

02:00:11.660 --> 02:00:13.660
Sleepy Jim.

02:00:15.660 --> 02:00:17.660
I'm Jeff Davis.

02:00:17.660 --> 02:00:20.660
Let's hear it for your Mayor Dan Harmon, everybody.

02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:39.660
All right. Drive fast. Take chances.

02:00:51.660 --> 02:00:53.660
You get any of that?

02:00:53.660 --> 02:01:21.660
It's a good show.
