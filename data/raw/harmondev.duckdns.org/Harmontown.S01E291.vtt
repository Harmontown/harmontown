WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.880
Welcome once again to the Double Tree Sweetwater in Extended Stay Hotel here at the Hayward

00:10.880 --> 00:11.880
Theater.

00:11.880 --> 00:12.880
Now it's Dynasty Typewriter.

00:12.880 --> 00:25.040
Once again, very happy to announce to all y'all that Harmontown is now in session.

00:25.040 --> 00:28.320
Sorry for the late start, but let's make it up for it with our Game Master Spencer

00:28.320 --> 00:30.320
Krippenden.

00:30.320 --> 00:32.320
Oh yeah.

00:32.320 --> 00:34.320
Oh yeah.

00:34.320 --> 00:36.320
Oh yeah.

00:36.320 --> 00:38.320
Oh yeah.

00:38.320 --> 00:40.320
Oh yeah.

00:40.320 --> 00:42.320
Oh yeah.

00:42.320 --> 00:44.320
Oh yeah.

00:44.320 --> 00:46.320
Everybody say, oh yeah.

00:46.320 --> 00:48.320
Oh yeah.

00:48.320 --> 00:50.320
Oh yeah.

00:50.320 --> 00:52.320
Let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.320
Dan Harmon!

00:54.320 --> 01:02.320
Thank you!

01:02.320 --> 01:10.880
Yo, yo, yo, yo, rapping perfunctorily, rapping is perfuntural to me, rapping is just a thing

01:10.880 --> 01:16.320
you see when you come out of the top of the show, it's like pee, it comes out of your

01:16.320 --> 01:25.720
dick, and goes on the floor, and then you rap a lot more, and then you want to rap less,

01:25.720 --> 01:30.880
you're a victim of your own rapping gimmick.

01:30.880 --> 01:39.200
Just look at your phone and try to get through it, no one's forcing you to rap, you know.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.360
I'm not in charge of this, this is Zach and the booth is running this, I don't have the

01:42.360 --> 01:43.360
button on this.

01:43.360 --> 01:54.120
I know, I'm not just looking at my notes, listening to my inner monologue, no one's

01:54.120 --> 02:01.040
forcing you to rap, you don't have to do it.

02:01.040 --> 02:02.680
I forgot my water, I'll be right back.

02:02.680 --> 02:12.080
What are you afraid of, are you afraid to start the show by just looking at people and

02:12.080 --> 02:26.280
being in the moment, and engaging, yes, my name is MC fear, I don't want to be here,

02:26.280 --> 02:45.400
the world's falling apart.

02:45.400 --> 02:50.280
I should either commit to a rap at the top of the show, or I should just say thank you

02:50.280 --> 02:56.120
very much and proceed right now, I don't know what I'm doing, we're just on our third weekend

02:56.120 --> 03:00.720
back in our honeymoon with the live audience, so I don't know what I'm doing, feeling it

03:00.720 --> 03:03.240
out, I don't know how to start a show.

03:03.240 --> 03:09.720
We're trying to get the audio dialed in for the home listener and everything.

03:09.720 --> 03:13.920
If anyone, here's me talking, I think I've mentioned it before, I have a bad thing in

03:13.920 --> 03:18.320
my throat, so if I sound weird, that's why.

03:18.320 --> 03:21.480
You're going to get a vocal therapy surgery soon.

03:21.480 --> 03:26.280
I am, I'm going to have a little surgery and take a little polyp off of my vocal fold.

03:26.280 --> 03:31.720
And then I can't talk for two weeks, isn't that going to be exciting for my girlfriend?

03:31.720 --> 03:35.400
But don't worry, I already got an app, I'm already working on replacing you.

03:35.400 --> 03:41.120
See Dan, as a good friend, I was thinking I'll get a little chalkboard, like Beethoven

03:41.120 --> 03:45.800
and write things down, and the doctor gave me a little button that I can wear that says

03:45.800 --> 03:52.200
I'm going through, like what was I saying, like, no talking, I can't talk, I'm going

03:52.200 --> 03:55.760
through like the thing and vocal rest, yes.

03:55.760 --> 04:02.040
And so with Dan, because he's a techno genius, instantly got to work to help his good friend

04:02.040 --> 04:03.040
out.

04:03.040 --> 04:10.120
Hey everybody, how are you doing tonight?

04:10.120 --> 04:11.120
You can put other phrases in there.

04:11.120 --> 04:16.480
Yeah, we're talking about maybe like some fan out there, something that could just make

04:16.480 --> 04:21.000
me like a big file of MP3s of some of my favorite phrases, and I could just come out here and

04:21.000 --> 04:26.080
just DJ my own inimical sense of wit and wisdom.

04:26.080 --> 04:29.400
We already knew we had to put this one in here.

04:29.400 --> 04:35.320
It's 9-Eleven.

04:35.320 --> 04:37.720
Do I have to be British?

04:37.720 --> 04:41.080
And then of course, my favorite.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.720
Dan, that sounds like you should do a rap.

04:43.720 --> 04:45.960
I can't really understand him.

04:45.960 --> 04:50.600
He said, Dan, that sounds like you should do a rap.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.840
How's work life going, Dan?

04:52.840 --> 04:53.840
That's good.

04:53.840 --> 04:58.920
I'm just writing, I'm just trying to get done with this thing, and I just want to kill myself.

04:58.920 --> 05:03.840
But it's probably for the best, because it keeps me up on the Twitter for the most part,

05:03.840 --> 05:07.880
and that's a mess, and I'm having a good time at Rick and Morty, we're back in the writer's

05:07.880 --> 05:11.640
room, sorry.

05:11.640 --> 05:14.640
How far into the 70 episodes are you so far?

05:14.640 --> 05:23.360
We're just brainstorming, you know, like stuff.

05:23.360 --> 05:24.360
Let's see.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.600
Well, here's from my notes.

05:26.600 --> 05:30.640
So there's this button.

05:30.640 --> 05:32.240
Did I talk about this last time?

05:32.240 --> 05:34.000
I don't believe so.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.760
How do you know?

05:35.760 --> 05:38.880
Oh, because I said there's a button.

05:38.880 --> 05:39.880
Okay.

05:39.880 --> 05:43.360
I mean, we talk about buttons all the time.

05:43.360 --> 05:44.360
How do you know?

05:44.360 --> 05:48.240
There's a crosswalk button, if I mentioned this crosswalk button, when we were working

05:48.240 --> 05:56.280
at Rick and Morty in the old Burbank offices, and there was this beeping sound that would

05:56.280 --> 06:02.440
happen all the time, that I always thought was a frenetic version of, a weirdly arrhythmic

06:02.440 --> 06:13.360
version of some kind of hearing impaired or visually impaired, I guess, crosswalk audio.

06:13.360 --> 06:20.120
Sometimes they make old cuckoo sounds, the crosswalks for the folks that can't see the

06:20.120 --> 06:26.400
walking people pictograms, and so the light will go like cuckoo, cuckoo, which means,

06:26.400 --> 06:28.720
I guess, walk.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.720
They better tell them that.

06:30.720 --> 06:35.600
I'm sure there's some, someone must coordinate with them, but I always thought, maybe, there's

06:35.600 --> 06:41.240
some version of that because I just hear those beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,

06:41.240 --> 06:44.760
beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

06:44.760 --> 06:51.400
Just coming out from this window.

06:51.400 --> 06:54.200
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.360
One time I was like, what is that?

06:55.360 --> 06:56.360
And someone was like, that's the crosswalk.

06:56.360 --> 06:58.100
I was like, okay, that confirms that.

06:58.100 --> 07:00.120
Their little months go by.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.880
No, the crosswalk, what do you mean it's the crosswalk?

07:02.880 --> 07:06.880
It goes crazy and one day I go down there

07:06.880 --> 07:09.560
and I'm gonna go across the street to the liquor store

07:09.560 --> 07:13.080
and I hit the button for the crosswalk

07:13.080 --> 07:16.640
and it goes beep and I go, you gotta be fucking kidding me.

07:16.640 --> 07:19.080
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

07:19.080 --> 07:21.320
Like I'm like, that's what people are doing?

07:21.320 --> 07:22.480
Like, wow.

07:22.480 --> 07:27.440
Like, and then sure I go out and look out the window

07:27.440 --> 07:30.440
and everybody starts like, beep, beep, beep, beep.

07:30.440 --> 07:33.440
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

07:34.980 --> 07:37.340
I have so many questions for this person.

07:37.340 --> 07:39.960
Like, so do you...

07:39.960 --> 07:44.020
So you live in a society where you are fine with the fact

07:44.020 --> 07:46.420
that this button really just doesn't work,

07:47.380 --> 07:49.520
but you are not quite to the point

07:49.520 --> 07:52.460
where you're gonna be Han Solo and just bound across the street.

07:52.460 --> 07:54.600
Like because fuck that button.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.260
Like you're like, well, the button doesn't work

07:57.260 --> 08:00.180
and that's fucked up, but I'm gonna press it a million times.

08:00.180 --> 08:03.060
Like, oh, it didn't work again, it didn't work again,

08:03.060 --> 08:03.900
it didn't work again.

08:03.900 --> 08:07.260
Like, you think the button's supposed to work instantly?

08:07.260 --> 08:11.940
Or is it that you think it's like a slot machine kind of game

08:11.940 --> 08:15.180
where there's a window where you snooze, you lose?

08:15.180 --> 08:17.620
Like, I checked back in with the button

08:17.620 --> 08:19.660
and you were touching your purse.

08:19.660 --> 08:20.940
Fuck you, lady.

08:20.940 --> 08:24.200
And so you're just like, I don't know when you decide.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.620
I know someone engineered this thing

08:25.620 --> 08:28.380
to give me the feedback of, yes, the button's been pushed,

08:28.380 --> 08:30.420
because obviously some engineer for the city

08:30.420 --> 08:32.980
like came back and got, guys, I know this is hard to believe,

08:32.980 --> 08:36.700
but people are pushing this thing 8,000 times a minute.

08:36.700 --> 08:39.500
Are you sure it's not kids just making like little EDM,

08:39.500 --> 08:41.580
like having fun making music while they wait?

08:41.580 --> 08:44.820
I work above this thing for years, and I'm telling,

08:44.820 --> 08:48.140
no, it's every human being that goes to that crosswalk,

08:49.300 --> 08:52.420
just like old, young, like whatever, like they're just like,

08:52.420 --> 08:55.340
maybe, maybe, like, it's like this weird,

08:55.340 --> 08:57.300
maybe it's like Jeopardy, like the person across the street

08:57.300 --> 08:58.580
hit it first and you locked out

08:58.580 --> 09:00.420
and you got to hit the button a bunch of times.

09:00.420 --> 09:01.260
Yeah.

09:01.260 --> 09:05.260
That's it, that's, that's the hardcore game show knowledge.

09:05.260 --> 09:10.260
If you hit the Jeopardy buzzer before the little light

09:10.780 --> 09:12.980
goes on, it says you can now answer the question.

09:12.980 --> 09:14.060
That's why you see people hitting the button

09:14.060 --> 09:16.420
like 1,000 times because they don't, they missed it.

09:16.420 --> 09:18.820
If I thought that that's how the button worked,

09:18.820 --> 09:21.700
I would not push it, I would go, I would push it once

09:21.700 --> 09:23.180
and I would go, well, if it's gonna be like that,

09:23.180 --> 09:24.700
fuck it, and I'd walk across the street.

09:24.700 --> 09:27.980
And if the cop was like, you're J walking,

09:27.980 --> 09:31.020
I'd be like, you better prove to me that that button works.

09:31.020 --> 09:33.400
Show me how it works.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.900
And then they'd be like, and then that would resolve it

09:35.900 --> 09:37.900
or I get to go across the street anytime I want

09:37.900 --> 09:38.740
and tell that happens.

09:38.740 --> 09:40.900
Wait, do the siren a few times?

09:40.900 --> 09:45.040
Rrr, rrr, rrr, rrr, rrr.

09:45.040 --> 09:45.880
That's just kind of crazy.

09:45.880 --> 09:47.680
I'm trying to layer some sweet tracks

09:47.680 --> 09:50.580
so we can have a full song at the end of this show.

09:50.580 --> 09:51.940
All right, well that was that thought,

09:51.940 --> 09:54.460
I guess that kind of shit the bed.

09:54.460 --> 09:56.460
No, there's no pressure on you.

09:56.460 --> 09:58.700
You don't have to enjoy my thoughts.

09:58.700 --> 10:01.380
We were like in Kansas City or St. Louis or somewhere.

10:01.380 --> 10:06.340
And sometimes a gentle voice goes, walk.

10:06.340 --> 10:08.380
Walk, and then that lets you know.

10:08.380 --> 10:11.460
But there's one, he goes, stop.

10:11.460 --> 10:14.700
If you hit the button, and it's not time for you to go,

10:14.700 --> 10:16.420
he goes, stop.

10:16.420 --> 10:17.980
The thing actually yells at you.

10:17.980 --> 10:20.380
Don't, no, stop.

10:20.380 --> 10:21.940
But I mean, don't try to walk.

10:21.940 --> 10:23.100
No, I think they're telling you don't.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.580
Well, yeah, they're telling you don't walk.

10:24.580 --> 10:25.860
Yeah, but I think it doubles as.

10:25.860 --> 10:26.820
Don't start walking.

10:26.820 --> 10:29.500
Also, stop fucking pushing the button.

10:29.500 --> 10:30.420
Oh, well, I don't.

10:30.420 --> 10:32.540
Oh, you're saying they should add that.

10:32.540 --> 10:33.740
They should go, yeah.

10:33.740 --> 10:38.340
They should add a sound that says, hey, the button's been pushed.

10:38.340 --> 10:41.820
You're good until an entire cycle of getting what you want

10:41.820 --> 10:43.460
either happens or doesn't happen.

10:43.460 --> 10:49.380
You definitely only have, think of it like an elevator.

10:49.380 --> 10:50.660
An elevator.

10:50.660 --> 10:51.820
I'm like a six-year-old kid.

10:51.820 --> 10:54.900
Think about it like spaghetti.

10:54.900 --> 10:56.460
Biscuity.

10:56.460 --> 10:57.900
To think about it like an elevator,

10:57.900 --> 10:59.260
I was going to say you fucking moron,

10:59.260 --> 11:01.660
and then I found out I can't say the word elevator.

11:01.660 --> 11:04.060
You've got 11 people waiting to cross the road,

11:04.060 --> 11:05.740
and everyone's just standing there, chilling out.

11:05.740 --> 11:08.260
Everyone's looking at their phones, and you're, stop.

11:08.260 --> 11:11.300
Everybody looks up, either because you're being told

11:11.300 --> 11:14.420
to stop what you're doing, or someone trying to cross the street,

11:14.420 --> 11:15.820
they're going to get hit by a bus.

11:15.820 --> 11:18.020
It's really alarming.

11:18.020 --> 11:20.060
You've got those new buses that are silent.

11:20.060 --> 11:22.100
There's like those completely electric silent buses.

11:22.100 --> 11:25.500
They're just, they're going to kill everybody.

11:25.500 --> 11:28.300
The whole point of a bus is that you can hear it coming.

11:28.300 --> 11:31.860
That's the whole point of a bus.

11:31.860 --> 11:32.360
Yeah.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.460
The fact that somebody was smart enough to say,

11:42.460 --> 11:53.980
let's put some seats in this and make some money.

11:53.980 --> 11:59.140
You know, people ask me, Dan, you're kind of a social media

11:59.140 --> 12:05.380
master, like I'm looking to spread my influence,

12:05.380 --> 12:09.900
boost my signal, like, how do I get more followers?

12:09.900 --> 12:12.660
I want to be able to use these social medias

12:12.660 --> 12:16.420
to make a difference in the world.

12:16.420 --> 12:21.020
And I don't have the reach that you or Joel McHale have.

12:21.020 --> 12:27.260
I didn't accidentally get born right around the time that

12:27.260 --> 12:29.300
would make me 30 when Twitter was invented.

12:29.300 --> 12:33.140
So now I got a fucked up username that's 20 numbers long,

12:33.140 --> 12:36.180
and I got two followers, and I don't know what to do.

12:36.180 --> 12:39.180
And I say, look, here's what you do.

12:39.180 --> 12:45.500
You just go onto Twitter, and you look for the things that

12:45.500 --> 12:48.700
are getting retweeted by the thousands.

12:48.700 --> 12:50.100
Oh, that got a lot of retweets.

12:50.100 --> 12:50.500
Look at that.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.300
People really liked reading that, and then they clicked

12:52.300 --> 12:53.580
retweet after they saw that.

12:53.580 --> 12:56.860
And then you click Reply to those, and then you just

12:56.860 --> 13:01.980
argue with another person who has two followers.

13:01.980 --> 13:05.820
If you do that for eight years, I promise you

13:05.820 --> 13:10.260
that you will gain five followers, because you're

13:10.260 --> 13:15.140
performing for an audience of two, and you're a fucking idiot.

13:15.140 --> 13:17.340
Anyways, I don't understand.

13:17.340 --> 13:21.020
It's like somebody will go, hey, I don't understand.

13:21.020 --> 13:22.620
Why are they taking babies?

13:22.620 --> 13:23.460
That seems bad.

13:23.460 --> 13:25.180
And then it's like 10,000 retweets.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.500
You know what, that person's job is kind of done.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.420
They're not really a dragon for you to slay.

13:29.420 --> 13:32.740
And then you just look at the responses, and people are like,

13:32.740 --> 13:35.460
yeah, but what do you think about the ramifications of that?

13:35.460 --> 13:38.460
Why don't you just fucking tweet it on your own thing?

13:38.460 --> 13:42.180
Because then eight people, who do you think is reading this?

13:42.180 --> 13:42.820
Weirdo?

13:42.820 --> 13:44.060
Why are you arguing?

13:44.060 --> 13:46.820
What are you climbing this person's wall and going like,

13:46.820 --> 13:50.060
yeah, I have a thing to say about that.

13:50.060 --> 13:52.540
Just seems kind of weird.

13:52.540 --> 13:55.860
You always look at the number of retweets and likes that's

13:55.860 --> 13:56.360
there.

13:56.360 --> 14:11.860
Yeah.

14:11.860 --> 14:13.420
Eventually I would bring you out.

14:17.420 --> 14:20.420
Get used to it.

14:20.420 --> 14:21.420
Get used to it.

14:21.420 --> 14:22.920
Get used to it.

14:22.920 --> 14:26.420
No, he's blowing it up.

14:26.420 --> 14:28.420
Get used to it.

14:28.420 --> 14:30.420
Get used to it.

14:30.420 --> 14:34.420
Get used to it.

14:34.420 --> 14:36.420
It gets worse.

14:36.420 --> 14:40.420
The closer you get, it gets worse.

14:40.420 --> 14:42.420
The closer you are.

14:42.420 --> 14:44.420
Worse.

14:44.420 --> 14:46.420
The closer you get, it gets worse.

14:46.420 --> 14:48.420
Grab shot, everyone.

14:48.420 --> 14:49.420
The closer you are.

14:49.420 --> 15:01.420
He's rolling a chair.

15:01.420 --> 15:06.420
He's moving the stage.

15:06.420 --> 15:09.920
The court is tangled in a chair.

15:09.920 --> 15:13.920
He threw the chair.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.920
He's sitting down.

15:16.920 --> 15:20.920
It's such a good show last week.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.920
Feel the lens?

15:22.920 --> 15:24.920
That show was great.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.920
You were talking to Judd Apatow.

15:26.920 --> 15:29.920
Yeah, nobody was playing.

15:29.920 --> 15:30.920
Hello, Dan.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.920
Chair games.

15:32.920 --> 15:36.920
I haven't seen you in a while now.

15:36.920 --> 15:38.920
Yeah, I, you know.

15:38.920 --> 15:40.920
You're looking good.

15:40.920 --> 15:42.920
So that's going to feed back, right?

15:42.920 --> 15:45.920
If I bring the microphone over here, isn't that?

15:45.920 --> 15:47.920
Just don't point the mic at the thing.

15:47.920 --> 15:49.920
Like this.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.920
Don't shout.

15:51.920 --> 15:53.920
I won't.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.920
Thank you for not.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.920
You got some kinks to work out.

15:57.920 --> 16:03.920
That was a great thing to happen after you said we have some kinks to work out.

16:03.920 --> 16:05.920
Oh, boy.

16:05.920 --> 16:11.920
You know, seven ups really got to start bringing their A game.

16:11.920 --> 16:20.920
I think, I mean, I think Sprite is winning this white soda war.

16:20.920 --> 16:23.920
I mean, remember, remember the unculled?

16:23.920 --> 16:27.920
They used to own the fucking airwaves, man.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.920
Now I go into a restaurant.

16:29.920 --> 16:31.920
You know, I said like seven up.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.920
They say Sprite okay.

16:33.920 --> 16:37.920
I mean, like, when's the last time you had seven up?

16:37.920 --> 16:38.920
I mean, be serious.

16:38.920 --> 16:47.920
That's the last time anybody had seven up at a place of business.

16:47.920 --> 16:53.920
You know, they really, I mean, they just, they backed off.

16:53.920 --> 16:54.920
It's tortoise in the hair.

16:54.920 --> 16:57.920
You know, they were just like, what are they going to do?

16:57.920 --> 16:59.920
Okay, slice.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.920
All right.

17:01.920 --> 17:02.920
Yeah.

17:02.920 --> 17:04.920
You're going to try to take us down.

17:04.920 --> 17:07.920
You're going to try to take down the uncooler.

17:07.920 --> 17:10.920
We got the red dot with the sunglasses, man.

17:10.920 --> 17:12.920
You're going to try to take us.

17:12.920 --> 17:13.920
Okay, fine.

17:13.920 --> 17:14.920
Whatever.

17:14.920 --> 17:17.920
And they're hanging out and Sprite just is like slow and steady.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.920
Wait, when's the race, man?

17:19.920 --> 17:21.920
And they fucking, they took it over.

17:21.920 --> 17:23.920
They took it over.

17:23.920 --> 17:25.920
It's gone.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.920
It's all over with, man.

17:27.920 --> 17:28.920
What are they doing?

17:28.920 --> 17:31.920
What are you fucking doing, seven up?

17:31.920 --> 17:32.920
Get in the game.

17:32.920 --> 17:35.920
Fucking start ideas.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.920
Give me ideas, seven up.

17:37.920 --> 17:40.920
What happened to your campaign?

17:40.920 --> 17:41.920
What?

17:41.920 --> 17:46.920
I mean, Jesus fucking Christ.

17:46.920 --> 17:47.920
Don't you care?

17:47.920 --> 17:49.920
I mean, like really?

17:49.920 --> 17:53.920
I mean, God, damn it.

17:53.920 --> 17:58.920
I'm not, I'm not alone here with this.

17:58.920 --> 17:59.920
Right?

17:59.920 --> 18:02.920
Cause I used to be a big bubble up guy.

18:02.920 --> 18:03.920
See?

18:03.920 --> 18:04.920
Yeah.

18:04.920 --> 18:05.920
Where are they?

18:05.920 --> 18:06.920
You don't hear them anymore.

18:06.920 --> 18:13.920
Seven up is going bubble up pretty soon, man.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.920
Is that the name of a, also a Sprite alternative bubble up?

18:16.920 --> 18:19.920
Yeah, from like the 1940s, 1948, I think.

18:19.920 --> 18:22.920
There's a song, there's a song with bubble up in it.

18:22.920 --> 18:25.920
Rainbow stew and a silver spoon.

18:25.920 --> 18:27.920
Think what you're saying is seven up used to be,

18:27.920 --> 18:29.920
used to own the market because there were these.

18:29.920 --> 18:31.920
They used to be the Coca Cola.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.920
The uncola alternative.

18:33.920 --> 18:34.920
Right.

18:34.920 --> 18:35.920
The uncola.

18:35.920 --> 18:36.920
The uncola.

18:36.920 --> 18:37.920
Crisp and clean.

18:37.920 --> 18:38.920
No caffeine.

18:38.920 --> 18:39.920
Right?

18:39.920 --> 18:40.920
Yeah.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.920
They had the steel vagina guy in the fucking commercial.

18:43.920 --> 18:44.920
Steel vagina.

18:44.920 --> 18:45.920
They had him locked.

18:45.920 --> 18:46.920
Yep.

18:46.920 --> 18:48.920
It's like Jim Henson.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.920
He dies and now the company's done.

18:51.920 --> 18:55.920
Yeah, there must have been some Steve Jobs of seven up.

18:55.920 --> 18:59.920
I think they didn't Sprite get bought by Coca Cola.

18:59.920 --> 19:00.920
I don't know.

19:00.920 --> 19:01.920
I don't know.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.920
It seems, I don't know.

19:03.920 --> 19:09.920
I mean, I just, you know, I mean, like you kids know about seven up, right?

19:09.920 --> 19:10.920
Anyone?

19:10.920 --> 19:11.920
I mean, I don't know.

19:11.920 --> 19:14.920
It could be something, something people don't know about.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.920
Well, our first guest.

19:16.920 --> 19:17.920
What about you, Spencer?

19:17.920 --> 19:22.920
I'm not finished.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.920
Spencer, what is your opinion?

19:24.920 --> 19:25.920
Oh.

19:25.920 --> 19:30.920
Why do you have drawers in front of your desk?

19:30.920 --> 19:37.920
I have to get a pencil.

19:37.920 --> 19:45.920
I should have probably got a piece of paper first.

19:45.920 --> 19:50.920
What's on the other side?

19:50.920 --> 19:53.920
No, what's on, what's.

19:53.920 --> 20:06.920
Yes.

20:06.920 --> 20:12.920
I want this to be like an advent calendar every show we open up a new thing.

20:12.920 --> 20:16.920
So everybody listening, you know, just like, not that I care about the free listeners.

20:16.920 --> 20:22.920
I mean, like, I like the subscribers more, but even they sometimes listen to audio only.

20:22.920 --> 20:27.920
And I'm saying, like, it's, you know, last week, fucking Apatow killed it.

20:27.920 --> 20:28.920
Like, great.

20:28.920 --> 20:31.920
I haven't listened to it.

20:31.920 --> 20:36.920
How unattractive is the actual desk side?

20:36.920 --> 20:38.920
That is the desk side.

20:38.920 --> 20:41.920
I got to tell you, it's not great back here.

20:41.920 --> 20:45.920
This is the side you want to be looking at.

20:45.920 --> 20:48.920
It's all just shitty, like raw plywood in the back.

20:48.920 --> 20:52.920
Yeah, it's designed to go up against the wall.

20:52.920 --> 20:57.920
It's not like a command desk.

20:57.920 --> 20:58.920
Are you okay?

20:58.920 --> 21:01.920
By the way, like your Instagrams are starting to look photoshopped.

21:01.920 --> 21:06.920
Oh, yeah, people were saying that it was that's, you know, that was those my space angles.

21:06.920 --> 21:10.920
It turns out, you know, you can take pictures from flattering angles.

21:10.920 --> 21:13.920
Holy shit.

21:13.920 --> 21:15.920
You look like a goddamn pirate.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.920
I know it's amazing.

21:17.920 --> 21:19.920
I was upset.

21:19.920 --> 21:21.920
I mean, happy.

21:21.920 --> 21:23.920
You look, you look hot.

21:23.920 --> 21:24.920
You look hot in it.

21:24.920 --> 21:25.920
I'm getting there.

21:25.920 --> 21:27.920
Yeah.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.920
Let's bring out an old friend of the show.

21:29.920 --> 21:30.920
So Boston's coming up.

21:30.920 --> 21:32.920
We got that show.

21:32.920 --> 21:33.920
Let's come on.

21:33.920 --> 21:34.920
What?

21:34.920 --> 21:36.920
You made me sit out there waiting.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.920
I had to come in here with a fucking balloon.

21:39.920 --> 21:41.920
With a fucking balloon.

21:41.920 --> 21:44.920
You didn't have to.

21:44.920 --> 21:48.920
I have to wait 15 minutes before you could bring me out.

21:48.920 --> 21:52.920
Like a fucking, what the heck am I peddling or something like that?

21:52.920 --> 21:53.920
I can't come out.

21:53.920 --> 21:55.920
I'm a second class citizen.

21:55.920 --> 21:57.920
I'm not rolling here.

21:57.920 --> 22:00.920
I guess we'll bring Rob out.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.920
I have no idea if you're ever going to bring me out there.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.920
I have to come in.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.920
Wait, you have, you have no idea?

22:07.920 --> 22:08.920
How would you?

22:08.920 --> 22:09.920
No idea.

22:09.920 --> 22:10.920
You have no idea.

22:10.920 --> 22:11.920
I have no idea.

22:11.920 --> 22:12.920
That's fair.

22:12.920 --> 22:13.920
Okay.

22:13.920 --> 22:16.920
I have no idea if I'm ever going to...

22:16.920 --> 22:18.920
James Adomian everybody.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.920
James Adomian.

22:20.920 --> 22:22.920
Let's bring James Adomian out.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.920
Oh, yeah.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.920
I was the first guest, right?

22:36.920 --> 22:37.920
Yes.

22:37.920 --> 22:40.920
I was hoping I didn't just accidentally steal someone's spot.

22:40.920 --> 22:41.920
No.

22:41.920 --> 22:43.920
I mean, don't even...

22:43.920 --> 22:44.920
I'm not a guest.

22:44.920 --> 22:49.920
I'm a fucking part of the show that comes out later when we get to it.

22:49.920 --> 22:52.920
He's a phenomenon.

22:52.920 --> 22:55.920
You could tell you could even hear me trying to...

22:55.920 --> 22:57.920
I was trying to get you out here.

22:57.920 --> 22:58.920
Oh, yeah.

22:58.920 --> 22:59.920
No, I was...

22:59.920 --> 23:00.920
I'm fine.

23:00.920 --> 23:01.920
This guy's a friend of the show.

23:01.920 --> 23:02.920
There's drinks back there.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.920
I've known you since you were 19 years old.

23:04.920 --> 23:07.920
I'm a friend of the show.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.920
I love that shows have friends.

23:10.920 --> 23:13.920
A friend of the show takes a friend out to the lake

23:13.920 --> 23:15.920
and talks serious stuff.

23:15.920 --> 23:16.920
Yeah.

23:16.920 --> 23:19.920
Maybe that friend sometimes used to go all the way out on the lake

23:19.920 --> 23:23.920
and then there's a single gunshot.

23:23.920 --> 23:25.920
He was a friend of the show.

23:25.920 --> 23:26.920
Let's keep it at that.

23:26.920 --> 23:31.920
I know it was you, Kumail.

23:31.920 --> 23:32.920
He'll be back.

23:32.920 --> 23:33.920
He'll be back.

23:33.920 --> 23:34.920
We did not kill him.

23:34.920 --> 23:36.920
No, we won't.

23:36.920 --> 23:37.920
Yeah.

23:37.920 --> 23:39.920
How are you, James Adomian?

23:39.920 --> 23:40.920
I'm great.

23:40.920 --> 23:41.920
I'm fantastic.

23:41.920 --> 23:46.920
All my projects have been canceled so I have nothing to plug.

23:46.920 --> 23:47.920
I'm free.

23:47.920 --> 23:48.920
I'm liberated.

23:48.920 --> 23:49.920
Thank you.

23:49.920 --> 23:50.920
He knows Gorka.

23:50.920 --> 23:51.920
I was actually watching.

23:51.920 --> 23:54.920
Sometimes I'll always get like Harmontown highlights

23:54.920 --> 23:57.920
suggested in the YouTube margins.

23:57.920 --> 23:58.920
Wait.

23:58.920 --> 24:00.920
You get yourself marketed to you?

24:00.920 --> 24:01.920
Yeah.

24:01.920 --> 24:02.920
And I swear, I don't know.

24:02.920 --> 24:06.920
I mean, I don't know what the algorithm is because I hate myself.

24:06.920 --> 24:07.920
That's probably it.

24:07.920 --> 24:12.920
I don't know why I click on shit that says I'm an asshole or something.

24:12.920 --> 24:17.920
That's like the emperor and Star Wars jolting himself with his powers.

24:17.920 --> 24:20.920
But it's actually a really nice thing because it's been almost 300 episodes

24:20.920 --> 24:22.920
and you're self-loathing.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.920
You tend to just go, oh, everything's always been shit.

24:24.920 --> 24:27.920
And then there's people out there that'll pull like little clips

24:27.920 --> 24:29.920
and they'll go, this is an amazing moment.

24:29.920 --> 24:30.920
And they'll give it a nice title.

24:30.920 --> 24:34.920
And you go, yes, I will click on the first time James Adomian did Bernie Sanders

24:34.920 --> 24:35.920
coming out of the show.

24:35.920 --> 24:36.920
And it was here.

24:36.920 --> 24:37.920
You debuted.

24:37.920 --> 24:39.920
You debuted your Sanders impression.

24:39.920 --> 24:41.920
Bernie Sanders debuted on Harmontown.

24:41.920 --> 24:42.920
What?

24:42.920 --> 24:44.920
At the meltdown.

24:44.920 --> 24:45.920
And he was.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.920
I like just that as a pull quote.

24:47.920 --> 24:51.920
Bernie Sanders debuted on Harmontown.

24:51.920 --> 24:56.920
And the political scene, the mess, the stage that became coded in blood

24:56.920 --> 24:59.920
was so clean back then that you could see me not knowing.

24:59.920 --> 25:02.920
I had asked DeMorge Brown, who's Bernie Sanders?

25:02.920 --> 25:06.920
And he said, oh, it's that black guy that is Ben Carson.

25:06.920 --> 25:07.920
And I was like, oh, it's Ben Carson.

25:07.920 --> 25:09.920
So I'm introducing what I think is Ben Carson.

25:09.920 --> 25:11.920
I don't know either of their names.

25:11.920 --> 25:13.920
And then you come out in these wigs.

25:13.920 --> 25:16.920
Yes, there were two wigs on the side of my head at the time.

25:16.920 --> 25:21.920
These two really awful wigs, like Bobby pinned together both on backwards.

25:21.920 --> 25:22.920
It was very good.

25:22.920 --> 25:25.920
Yeah, yeah, that's how you, that's DIY.

25:25.920 --> 25:27.920
What was the ride like?

25:27.920 --> 25:32.920
You had a homespun version of like, I know always like, like, oh, there'll always be that feature

25:32.920 --> 25:36.920
and variety or something about like, oh, this guy got cast on SNL.

25:36.920 --> 25:42.920
And who little did he know that Gary Hart would become such a thing because that was one of his impressions.

25:42.920 --> 25:51.920
But you just did it like the weekend style, like mixtape style, like turned platinum artist.

25:51.920 --> 25:57.920
Like your Bernie Sanders became like a cottage industry that you controlled.

25:57.920 --> 25:58.920
Yes.

25:58.920 --> 26:08.920
And look, as all industries, I believe that the Bernie Sanders industry should be strictly regulated.

26:08.920 --> 26:18.920
There should be no monopolies and the workers should take control of the impression itself.

26:18.920 --> 26:23.920
Are there any little tidbits or are you tired of talking about it?

26:23.920 --> 26:31.920
Like the ride of like, holy shit, you started, you got in the ground floor of this impression of this guy

26:31.920 --> 26:37.920
that has become like the Tony Stark of this Marvel movie that's lasting four years.

26:37.920 --> 26:39.920
It changed rapidly week to week.

26:39.920 --> 26:46.920
When I started doing it, I knew and loved Bernie Sanders, but I thought I was doing an impression of someone who was doomed.

26:46.920 --> 26:48.920
Dennis Kucinich.

26:48.920 --> 26:51.920
So my angle was, well, I don't have a chance.

26:51.920 --> 26:59.920
Within a week, there were these 30,000 people crowds and I was like, that's not the angle anymore.

26:59.920 --> 27:02.920
When I first started doing it, it was like, this is the biggest crowd I've seen.

27:02.920 --> 27:03.920
Ha, ha, ha, big laugh.

27:03.920 --> 27:07.920
But after a while, it was like, I can't believe I'm playing a room this small.

27:07.920 --> 27:11.920
Which must parallel his journey, I assume, if you were up here.

27:11.920 --> 27:17.920
Yeah, I think he definitely started in a Volvo somewhere.

27:17.920 --> 27:23.920
Whenever I see a good Volvo or an old Studebaker on the road, I'm like, that's Bernie Sanders' car.

27:23.920 --> 27:30.920
But was there any moment that really like, where just the absurdity reached a height for you where,

27:30.920 --> 27:35.920
because the political fervor of all of this and the fact that you're out there doing a guy,

27:35.920 --> 27:41.920
was there anybody like, I don't know what I'm expecting to hear, someone yelling, hey, James,

27:41.920 --> 27:45.920
and then throwing paint on you and going like, stop making fun of him, you're part of the problem,

27:45.920 --> 27:47.920
or the opposite?

27:47.920 --> 27:55.920
There was a couple of broken brains that thought that making fun of Bernie Sanders is not allowed,

27:55.920 --> 27:58.920
because he's perfect, and I'm like, no, I like him.

27:58.920 --> 28:02.920
I'm a second Bernie Sanders.

28:02.920 --> 28:08.920
I'm trying to say the same things and get the message amplified, and also work in some more radical things,

28:08.920 --> 28:12.920
like I got to call for the legalization of psilocybin mushrooms, which he wouldn't do,

28:12.920 --> 28:14.920
but I was like, I'm going to do it.

28:14.920 --> 28:20.920
Because I read a piece in New Yorker that said that your impression of him might have cost him two and a half points in the primary.

28:20.920 --> 28:21.920
Thank you.

28:21.920 --> 28:27.920
Was that an article, or was that like a two-person New Yorker cartoon?

28:27.920 --> 28:33.920
Where there was like an ill-shapen therapist talking to a desk with drawers in the front.

28:33.920 --> 28:37.920
And it was actually, it was my winning caption. That wasn't even one that had.

28:37.920 --> 28:39.920
It was a contest.

28:39.920 --> 28:46.920
But sometimes people thought from our advertising that it was really going to be a Trump vs. Bernie debate

28:46.920 --> 28:53.920
when we were on the road, me and Anthony and Tamanick, and in Boston, there was a big sign on the front door that was like,

28:53.920 --> 28:58.920
Donald Trump at Bernie Sanders will not be at the show tonight. These are comedians.

28:58.920 --> 28:59.920
Jesus.

28:59.920 --> 29:02.920
Because they had been getting calls, apparently.

29:02.920 --> 29:06.920
Speaking of, yeah, his, Anthony's Trump impression, fantastic.

29:06.920 --> 29:13.920
And was like, but everybody's like, I mean, that's a guy that's like, everybody's got a Trump impression.

29:13.920 --> 29:14.920
Who is a Trump impression?

29:14.920 --> 29:16.920
Have you dabbled?

29:16.920 --> 29:22.920
You know, on the road, I do a Trump impression because I feel like I have to.

29:22.920 --> 29:26.920
Because I went to, I was in Europe, and I'm like, the American who does impressions.

29:26.920 --> 29:30.920
And if, like, if you don't do a Trump impression, there's like, you failed, mate.

29:30.920 --> 29:37.920
It seems like kind of a hard impression. Like, there's a surface that's just like, beige, like George Bush gandam.

29:37.920 --> 29:41.920
Like, you just kind of like that, like the Trump version of that would be like, I'm Donald Trump.

29:41.920 --> 29:43.920
I don't know. I tried it.

29:43.920 --> 29:45.920
That's it. There's a stuntedness to the vote.

29:45.920 --> 29:50.920
But he has like a tool, he has like a, like a weird jagged toolbox of like,

29:50.920 --> 29:52.920
Anthony Atamanic is my favorite.

29:52.920 --> 29:54.920
He has the, he does the breathy thing.

29:54.920 --> 29:56.920
You know, where it's just, I mean, come on.

29:59.920 --> 30:03.920
I mostly just ape his impression and give him credit one fourth of the time.

30:03.920 --> 30:08.920
But, but there's, there's something I love that Donald Trump speaks.

30:08.920 --> 30:13.920
Like, he hates people from other cultures and places and races,

30:13.920 --> 30:17.920
but he speaks English in a way that would be useful.

30:17.920 --> 30:20.920
If you were learning English for the first time,

30:20.920 --> 30:26.920
or if you're teaching it to someone, because he uses very simple sentences and easy words.

30:26.920 --> 30:29.920
He's like, we used to be bad. We were so bad.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.920
In the past, we used to be bad.

30:31.920 --> 30:35.920
Now, here in the present, we're getting better.

30:35.920 --> 30:37.920
We're so much getting better.

30:37.920 --> 30:39.920
And in the future, we're going to be great.

30:39.920 --> 30:43.920
We're going to be great. That's all three possibilities.

30:43.920 --> 30:46.920
He's conjugating words.

30:46.920 --> 30:48.920
It sounds like a George Carlin set too.

30:48.920 --> 30:51.920
Like, like, like Rick Moran, this is an impression of George Carlin.

30:51.920 --> 30:53.920
It's like, beats, beats, beats.

30:53.920 --> 30:54.920
You want beats?

30:54.920 --> 30:55.920
Am I on the plane?

30:55.920 --> 30:57.920
Why are you, are you on the plane?

30:57.920 --> 30:59.920
I'm not on the plane. I'm, the plane is grounded.

30:59.920 --> 31:01.920
It's a low energy plane.

31:02.920 --> 31:04.920
You got more, you want more stuff.

31:04.920 --> 31:07.920
You're going to have stuff to put your stuff in.

31:07.920 --> 31:09.920
Well, now you got to have stuff and put, I'm trying to do George,

31:09.920 --> 31:13.920
George Carlin's materialist, Donald Trump, in case that's not clear.

31:13.920 --> 31:15.920
That's what I was trying to do too, with you on the plane.

31:15.920 --> 31:16.920
No, you did it.

31:16.920 --> 31:19.920
And then I tried to come in and join the party and I killed it.

31:21.920 --> 31:24.920
You have owners. You think you're free? You have owners.

31:24.920 --> 31:27.920
I mean, come on. I'm your owner.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.920
All right. That was a George Carlin pit. Thank you.

31:30.920 --> 31:33.920
We're going to make a cage. It's going to hold so many babies.

31:33.920 --> 31:36.920
So many children are going to fit in so many cages.

31:36.920 --> 31:41.920
I like to think of them as hard cradles. They're hard cradles.

31:41.920 --> 31:45.920
Think of them, think of them as big boy pens.

31:47.920 --> 31:48.920
Big boy cribs.

31:48.920 --> 31:52.920
What was that? I want to check in with Spencer for some, for some Spencer.

31:52.920 --> 31:55.920
It's a new, it's a new segment called Spencer's Plainies.

31:55.920 --> 31:56.920
Yeah.

31:57.920 --> 31:59.920
Spencer's Plainies. Oh, sorry.

31:59.920 --> 32:01.920
I was just so excited. Sorry.

32:01.920 --> 32:02.920
Oh, okay.

32:03.920 --> 32:04.920
Okay.

32:04.920 --> 32:06.920
That was a weird theme.

32:06.920 --> 32:08.920
A lot of things happened at once.

32:08.920 --> 32:12.920
Well, I want to check, because I clicked on the thing where the White House lady was going,

32:12.920 --> 32:15.920
like where it was like, hey, this is misinformation.

32:15.920 --> 32:19.920
And then she's like, I watched like four minutes of it where she's like,

32:19.920 --> 32:22.920
this is the reality of it and all this stuff.

32:22.920 --> 32:27.920
Like for these people, like as we're all tweeting and then like being alarmed and going like,

32:27.920 --> 32:32.920
boy, does this feel a lot like something from history books and things and all this stuff.

32:32.920 --> 32:37.920
And then there's like, there's one chorus of counter argument, which is this,

32:37.920 --> 32:39.920
it happened under Obama too.

32:39.920 --> 32:43.920
And it's like such a scattering of like signals.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.920
And I just don't know if you've parsed any of it.

32:45.920 --> 32:49.920
Well, a good rule of thumb is everything Republicans say is a lie.

32:49.920 --> 32:58.920
So if you start from there, no, but, but specifically, I understand that my understanding is that policy that

32:58.920 --> 33:04.920
everyone's pointing to in bad faith to lie to people is that unaccompanied minors

33:04.920 --> 33:09.920
found at the border without parents were detained.

33:09.920 --> 33:11.920
So that's not good.

33:11.920 --> 33:16.920
But I mean, you either leave a kid in the desert or you don't leave a kid.

33:16.920 --> 33:18.920
So I mean, it's not, it's not a comparison.

33:18.920 --> 33:20.920
Also, you know, Obama wasn't great.

33:20.920 --> 33:24.920
He was the before Trump, a real deporter guy, but he, he got him out of the country.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.920
He didn't keep them in concentration camps.

33:27.920 --> 33:30.920
So it's, it's hard to really compare the two.

33:30.920 --> 33:34.920
The thing is politicians are bad even when they're not as bad.

33:34.920 --> 33:37.920
So Obama is bad even when he's the best president.

33:37.920 --> 33:39.920
I know, you know, but he was.

33:39.920 --> 33:40.920
Yeah.

33:40.920 --> 33:41.920
So does that answer your question?

33:41.920 --> 33:42.920
Yeah.

33:42.920 --> 33:46.920
But Dan, if you're going to ask him another question, I want to take another pass at.

33:46.920 --> 33:47.920
At a thing.

33:47.920 --> 33:48.920
Thank God.

33:48.920 --> 33:49.920
Yeah.

33:49.920 --> 33:51.920
I think you owe us another.

33:51.920 --> 33:52.920
Yeah.

33:52.920 --> 33:57.920
First tee up the segment and then we cut to the graphic, you know, in the whole thing.

33:57.920 --> 33:58.920
Right.

33:58.920 --> 34:01.920
I haven't played the song in a long time, so I'm not sure it's perfect.

34:01.920 --> 34:06.920
Well, there's a lot of stuff going on in the news and I can't tell my ass from a hole in the ground

34:06.920 --> 34:10.920
and I'm too selfish and rich to really care that much.

34:10.920 --> 34:14.920
That's when I turned to my friend Spencer for Spencer splainies.

34:14.920 --> 34:16.920
I don't know.

34:16.920 --> 34:20.920
Do you have the code, Senator?

34:20.920 --> 34:23.920
This isn't ketchup.

34:23.920 --> 34:26.920
People are dying.

34:26.920 --> 34:30.920
No, actually, that is ketchup.

34:30.920 --> 34:32.920
You bread raptors.

34:32.920 --> 34:45.920
Wow, it seems like we missed an episode.

34:45.920 --> 34:59.920
Yeah, I think I think most programs that are evil originated in some version that people

34:59.920 --> 35:01.920
didn't realize were going to be so evil at first.

35:01.920 --> 35:02.920
Yeah.

35:02.920 --> 35:07.920
But Obama did not have a clean immigration policy.

35:07.920 --> 35:08.920
It was bad.

35:08.920 --> 35:13.920
And there were people at the time saying, hey, eventually someone's going to get a hold of this power and abuse it.

35:13.920 --> 35:19.920
And conversely, Obama got blamed completely for the drone killings, which were very bad,

35:19.920 --> 35:22.920
but Bush started it.

35:22.920 --> 35:23.920
It started under Bush.

35:23.920 --> 35:27.920
So it's like, if it's a billion bad, it's often rooted in the last guy, too.

35:27.920 --> 35:34.920
I guess we're just paying the price for a fucking hundred years of just going, politicians,

35:34.920 --> 35:37.920
being the price.

35:37.920 --> 35:39.920
But we really have to, man.

35:39.920 --> 35:43.920
We never should have got those guys off those soapboxes.

35:43.920 --> 35:45.920
Things would have been a lot better.

35:45.920 --> 35:48.920
We could just throw a tomato at them if they didn't like it.

35:48.920 --> 35:51.920
They're like, hey, have you seen my baby?

35:51.920 --> 35:53.920
Have you seen my baby?

35:53.920 --> 35:55.920
Stop, stop.

35:55.920 --> 36:00.920
And also, the politicians can't be picking our pockets when they get their thumbs up on their suspenders like this,

36:00.920 --> 36:01.920
where we can see their hands.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.920
That was why they did that.

36:03.920 --> 36:06.920
Whatever happened to...

36:06.920 --> 36:09.920
Whatever happened to a good old whistle stop tour?

36:09.920 --> 36:12.920
Nothing right here.

36:12.920 --> 36:13.920
But the fact that...

36:13.920 --> 36:17.920
Teddy Roosevelt was the most attractive fat man.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.920
I can imagine.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.920
He was, like, robust.

36:22.920 --> 36:29.920
But that memo that people are tweeting, where it's signed by sessions,

36:29.920 --> 36:35.920
and it's, like, zero tolerance, like, here we go, that's a real thing.

36:35.920 --> 36:40.920
That's not, like, the libs go and we're connecting these dots.

36:40.920 --> 36:43.920
It's, like, that's the key, right?

36:43.920 --> 36:46.920
Is that they were like, oh, let's jack it up.

36:46.920 --> 36:48.920
Yeah, no, that's a policy change.

36:48.920 --> 36:50.920
Yeah, no, a very explicit policy change.

36:50.920 --> 36:55.920
And as a result, whether they intended it or not, there's, like, this wake of that motorboat

36:55.920 --> 36:59.920
that's, like, a bunch of babies being ripped from mother's arms, and they're, like, either...

36:59.920 --> 37:03.920
What I can't tell is if they were, like,

37:03.920 --> 37:06.920
yeah, there's going to be babies ripped from mother's arms,

37:06.920 --> 37:09.920
but there's going to be a certain shade of brown baby and brown arm,

37:09.920 --> 37:12.920
and there's going to be a certain number, and we're going to keep ratcheting it up,

37:12.920 --> 37:15.920
because there's the motorboat in the no-wake zone just going, like,

37:15.920 --> 37:20.920
And pretty soon, it's all about that wall negotiation, right?

37:21.680 --> 37:22.880
Is that a real, it's like.

37:22.880 --> 37:27.880
I think that they intend to cause misery

37:28.480 --> 37:32.440
for non-white families, mostly at the border

37:32.440 --> 37:36.120
and at other places where they detain immigrants.

37:36.120 --> 37:38.120
And I think there's people that want there

37:38.120 --> 37:40.080
to be family misery.

37:40.080 --> 37:40.920
Because they're.

37:40.920 --> 37:43.400
To deter people from coming in, which is a nightmare.

37:43.400 --> 37:44.600
They say that out loud.

37:44.600 --> 37:45.440
They've said that.

37:45.440 --> 37:47.120
Before it became controversial

37:47.120 --> 37:48.320
because we didn't have pictures.

37:48.320 --> 37:49.840
They were like, yeah, it's going to be great.

37:49.840 --> 37:51.120
We'll be separating families.

37:51.120 --> 37:52.880
And they'll be like, I don't want to separate my family.

37:52.880 --> 37:54.000
I'm not going to come to America.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.560
Like that was what they were saying.

37:55.560 --> 37:56.720
This is the plan.

37:56.720 --> 37:58.320
But now that it's actually happening,

37:58.320 --> 37:59.600
they're like, this isn't happening.

37:59.600 --> 38:03.920
But before it was like a political issue,

38:03.920 --> 38:05.480
they were like, no, it'll be great.

38:05.480 --> 38:07.480
We're going to separate families.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.800
And that was just what they were openly saying.

38:09.800 --> 38:11.520
You know how you compromise?

38:11.520 --> 38:19.920
Wall of babies, they're already there.

38:19.920 --> 38:23.360
Two birds with one stone.

38:23.360 --> 38:24.520
It's called compromise people.

38:24.520 --> 38:29.120
Is it a wall of white babies that are outward?

38:29.120 --> 38:33.560
Hey, Jan, take it easy.

38:33.560 --> 38:36.960
I think you wildly misread my points.

38:36.960 --> 38:40.520
Now, this wall is going to be brown, brown, brown.

38:40.520 --> 38:42.560
But is that so that's like a very grizzly.

38:42.560 --> 38:44.640
You're talking about like a thunderdome thing

38:44.640 --> 38:47.480
where the babies are like an example.

38:47.480 --> 38:50.520
The picture of the cage, all these kids are in it.

38:50.520 --> 38:52.680
You're making a thunderdome for people.

38:52.680 --> 38:56.880
I thought maybe like healthy, white, well-fed, fat, white

38:56.880 --> 38:59.960
babies that are like facing Mexico.

38:59.960 --> 39:04.840
And the sign says, look, we already have so many babies.

39:04.840 --> 39:05.680
We're using a dispenser.

39:05.680 --> 39:08.840
And the babies are like, we love America.

39:08.840 --> 39:11.520
Don't come in here with your baby.

39:11.520 --> 39:16.120
I mean, I hear people say, oh, it's not

39:16.120 --> 39:17.720
helpful to say that they're Nazis.

39:17.720 --> 39:18.320
And I hear that.

39:18.320 --> 39:20.320
I'm not sure where I stand on it.

39:20.320 --> 39:23.000
But definitely, if they're like, OK, fine, fine, fine,

39:23.000 --> 39:25.440
for sake of argument, if they're not literally Nazis,

39:25.440 --> 39:30.320
they're at least like the bad guys from Children of Men.

39:30.320 --> 39:33.680
And I think we're our own bad thing.

39:33.680 --> 39:34.680
We're our own bad thing.

39:34.680 --> 39:35.520
We've got to stop it.

39:35.520 --> 39:37.520
Yeah.

39:37.520 --> 39:39.000
Here's the thing.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.800
I like to think, I think in my listenership,

39:42.800 --> 39:46.160
if that's a word, there's probably everything but Nazis.

39:46.160 --> 39:47.880
Maybe there's a couple, like there's probably

39:47.880 --> 39:50.440
a little churn coming through.

39:50.440 --> 39:53.000
Gorka could be a secret Nazi.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.840
I saw enough Rick and Morty to tune in.

39:54.840 --> 39:56.200
What was this cuck talking about?

39:56.200 --> 39:57.400
But I don't know.

39:57.400 --> 39:59.160
You could be a libertarian and listen to the show.

39:59.160 --> 40:02.560
You could be a Republican, a fiscal log cabin Republican.

40:02.560 --> 40:05.040
You're probably not going to go, oh, he's a big, fat, blow

40:05.040 --> 40:07.200
hard, like I resonate with him.

40:07.200 --> 40:10.000
Like you're welcome here.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.400
I'm not going to shame you.

40:11.400 --> 40:13.320
Free markets?

40:13.320 --> 40:17.560
As you probably know, like I was the most apolitical,

40:17.560 --> 40:19.240
like kind of like guy.

40:19.240 --> 40:22.000
Like I was like, oh, I don't believe in politics.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.200
I don't believe in the election.

40:23.200 --> 40:24.760
And then it was like, the election happened.

40:24.760 --> 40:26.160
And then it became fucking Schrab.

40:26.160 --> 40:27.160
I fucking hate Schrab.

40:27.160 --> 40:29.360
I hate him so much.

40:29.360 --> 40:31.680
Fucking hate him.

40:31.680 --> 40:34.400
You know, I said, what do you want to talk about?

40:34.400 --> 40:36.280
Farts for an hour?

40:36.280 --> 40:37.200
It's just you.

40:37.200 --> 40:38.800
It's all, it's just you.

40:38.800 --> 40:43.800
I'm trying to connect with you with the 7-Up thing.

40:43.800 --> 40:45.680
Yeah, you're not giving Schrab enough credit

40:45.680 --> 40:48.080
for trying to connect with you earlier.

40:48.080 --> 40:49.480
I don't suffer the illusion that I'm supposed to be.

40:49.480 --> 40:50.680
I never see you anymore.

40:50.680 --> 40:51.520
I never see you anymore.

40:51.520 --> 40:53.560
Just want to have a conversation with my friends

40:53.560 --> 40:56.120
about what's going on in my world, which

40:56.120 --> 40:59.080
includes what's going on in other people's world.

40:59.080 --> 41:00.200
No one's stopping you.

41:00.200 --> 41:01.440
Yeah, you're not stopping me.

41:01.440 --> 41:04.080
You look like a fucking dead scarecrow over there.

41:04.080 --> 41:07.400
You're swiveling around in your chairs, rolling his eyes.

41:07.400 --> 41:08.760
He's like, he's like mounting a thing.

41:08.760 --> 41:10.680
He's like, you think I don't know what's going on?

41:10.680 --> 41:15.440
You got Schrab loyalists like building in my crowd.

41:15.440 --> 41:16.240
I know what's going on.

41:16.240 --> 41:17.840
Perhaps the most dangerous faction of all.

41:17.840 --> 41:20.280
He's splintering my people.

41:20.280 --> 41:21.920
People are coming here to see you.

41:21.920 --> 41:24.080
I see your t-shirt shop.

41:24.080 --> 41:25.440
I saw your t-shirt shop.

41:25.440 --> 41:26.800
I see you selling shit.

41:31.040 --> 41:32.120
Why are you so mean?

41:32.120 --> 41:34.520
There's so angry.

41:34.520 --> 41:40.200
Anyways, Nazis, all I'm saying, look, Nazis,

41:40.200 --> 41:43.640
all you got to do, because it's this faction of people

41:43.640 --> 41:46.520
that are like, if you were to just be like,

41:46.520 --> 41:48.600
oh, I'm going to get a swastika tattoo,

41:48.600 --> 41:52.640
and I hate everybody that's not me and a Nazi.

41:52.640 --> 41:53.680
How would you do that?

41:53.680 --> 41:55.760
That's terrible.

41:55.760 --> 41:58.680
The problem is that people that are like, whoa, whoa, whoa,

41:58.680 --> 42:00.000
what's this Nazi talk?

42:00.000 --> 42:00.960
I don't like that.

42:00.960 --> 42:02.080
You know what I am?

42:02.080 --> 42:04.400
I'm a totally intellectual, logical guy

42:04.400 --> 42:06.000
who hates overreaction.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.480
I'd like to exterminate overreaction

42:08.480 --> 42:10.240
with some logical discourse.

42:10.240 --> 42:12.080
Why do you say a Nazi all the time?

42:12.080 --> 42:13.600
That seems really hysterical.

42:13.600 --> 42:16.720
I'm such a logical person that's definitely not a Nazi.

42:16.720 --> 42:20.400
I just happen to be arguing for calmness and discourse

42:20.400 --> 42:21.720
in both sides of the thing.

42:21.720 --> 42:23.400
And I'm like, you're a fucking closet Nazi.

42:23.400 --> 42:26.080
You're just biding your time.

42:26.080 --> 42:28.040
And I just say to those people.

42:28.040 --> 42:30.280
Why are you afraid of honest debate?

42:30.280 --> 42:32.240
Yeah, why don't you keep talking to me

42:32.240 --> 42:33.800
about whether or not we're Nazis?

42:33.800 --> 42:36.320
I'm just fucking exhausted already.

42:36.320 --> 42:38.000
I'm a spoiled baby.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.320
Can I start punching you yet?

42:40.320 --> 42:41.960
Like, I really got so much time left.

42:41.960 --> 42:43.000
Jesus Christ.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.720
I like to imagine the current day.

42:45.720 --> 42:48.680
If Hitler was here now, there would be some bunker

42:48.680 --> 42:52.200
where he was like, we have 40,000 trolls.

42:52.200 --> 42:53.360
We can send it Harmon.

42:53.360 --> 42:55.640
Yes, yes.

42:55.640 --> 42:57.240
I just say to those people, hey,

42:57.240 --> 42:59.440
if you're really honestly for real,

42:59.440 --> 43:01.240
you're honest about this fact.

43:01.240 --> 43:02.680
You're going like, you know what?

43:02.680 --> 43:04.360
We're never going to turn Nazi.

43:04.360 --> 43:05.960
This isn't anything.

43:05.960 --> 43:08.120
Just would you please, you know what?

43:08.120 --> 43:09.480
We help you so much.

43:09.480 --> 43:13.000
Would you just Google 1933 Germany?

43:13.000 --> 43:15.640
Because you think you're going to see a description that's

43:15.640 --> 43:20.440
going to, just do an hour of fucking research.

43:20.440 --> 43:24.440
And if I'm wrong, you will be so much more armed

43:24.440 --> 43:25.600
in your next argument.

43:25.600 --> 43:28.880
You'll be able to go, there's a lot of differences here.

43:28.880 --> 43:34.960
But I'm afraid you're going to see that everything has a ramp

43:34.960 --> 43:37.480
and that everything starts a certain way.

43:37.480 --> 43:44.160
And that marginalization and institutionalization of it

43:44.160 --> 43:47.520
is like, it all takes the same form in the beginning.

43:47.520 --> 43:49.840
And it's all very argued about.

43:49.840 --> 43:53.160
And people are always amorphous and blurry about it.

43:53.160 --> 43:58.080
Like, while regimes change hands and cabinets switch around

43:58.080 --> 43:59.320
and everybody has these arguments,

43:59.320 --> 44:01.440
and it's like the things that don't change are just

44:01.440 --> 44:04.560
these brick on brick on brick buildings and policies

44:04.560 --> 44:06.320
and things where people are separated

44:06.320 --> 44:10.200
and people are alienated and people are fucked.

44:10.200 --> 44:13.600
Yeah, and there's like a long track record

44:13.600 --> 44:17.680
of other bad fascist dictators in other countries.

44:17.680 --> 44:20.320
But it's not always like explicitly,

44:20.320 --> 44:23.280
we disagree with Hitler on five things.

44:23.280 --> 44:24.280
There's other guys.

44:24.280 --> 44:25.400
There's Pinochet.

44:25.400 --> 44:28.320
I would love to, I like to, this is my style.

44:28.320 --> 44:31.120
I love to jump the gun on my Hitler comparisons.

44:31.120 --> 44:32.280
That's just me.

44:32.280 --> 44:35.040
I'm a gun jumper on the Hitler comparison.

44:35.040 --> 44:39.640
I like to not wait until it's actually Hitler.

44:39.640 --> 44:43.760
The early bird gets the Hitler.

44:43.760 --> 44:45.960
I'd like to be wrong a couple of times.

44:45.960 --> 44:47.400
Oops, that guy wasn't Hitler.

44:47.400 --> 44:50.680
He just hated Jews and wanted to be senator.

44:50.680 --> 44:55.680
Oh well, down the drain you go, anti-Semitic senator

44:55.800 --> 44:57.720
that would have done great things for healthcare.

44:57.720 --> 45:00.840
Fuck you, you reminded me of Hitler too early.

45:00.840 --> 45:03.840
That's the worst thing anybody's said about me this hour.

45:06.320 --> 45:08.440
All right, let's move into the fun things.

45:08.440 --> 45:11.520
Rob, take it away, entertain us.

45:14.320 --> 45:16.520
Or I'll rip you from the arms of your mother

45:16.520 --> 45:18.720
and stick you in a fucking cage.

45:18.720 --> 45:21.320
Why, what, what did I ever do?

45:21.320 --> 45:23.760
Fucking entertain me, you're part of the show.

45:25.400 --> 45:26.960
Ask me some questions.

45:26.960 --> 45:28.680
Oh, what about transformers?

45:28.680 --> 45:29.840
What about soda?

45:32.040 --> 45:37.040
I like soda, I'm okay with transformers.

45:37.960 --> 45:40.360
Hey, have you seen this with the toys

45:40.360 --> 45:42.240
that made us on Netflix?

45:42.240 --> 45:44.240
They did a whole Transformers, right?

45:44.240 --> 45:47.280
A couple of them did a whole Transformers one

45:47.280 --> 45:50.920
and you're all great about, you love Transformers, right?

45:50.920 --> 45:52.520
And it's pretty cool, it's pretty cool,

45:52.520 --> 45:55.720
you should check it out, you check it out.

45:55.720 --> 45:58.040
Can you name all five DinoBots?

45:58.040 --> 46:00.480
All five DinoBots, okay, Grimlock.

46:01.880 --> 46:02.720
I'm so excited.

46:02.720 --> 46:07.200
Scabies, scabies, landing strip.

46:08.480 --> 46:11.360
First is Grimlock and then right to Scabies.

46:11.360 --> 46:12.200
James.

46:12.200 --> 46:15.040
Scabies was, when they formed the big thing together,

46:15.040 --> 46:18.160
he would like layer over the skin of the big guy.

46:19.240 --> 46:20.640
Oh man, how amazing would it be?

46:20.640 --> 46:22.640
Slag, slag.

46:22.640 --> 46:25.360
Scare-a-dactyl.

46:25.360 --> 46:26.200
That's not one.

46:26.200 --> 46:27.640
I think you're thinking of Swoop.

46:27.640 --> 46:29.560
Swoop would be the pterodactyl.

46:29.560 --> 46:30.880
Swoop.

46:30.880 --> 46:31.960
Snarl.

46:31.960 --> 46:33.160
Snarl, thank you.

46:33.160 --> 46:34.000
Yeah, snarl.

46:35.440 --> 46:37.880
Snarf and snarl used to hang out at craft services.

46:37.880 --> 46:39.520
Trans-Vaginal mesh.

46:39.520 --> 46:43.520
Did we do slag, the slag, slag is for Triceratops.

46:43.520 --> 46:46.760
Stomp, is that the, is that the Brontosaurus?

46:46.760 --> 46:49.240
Was he in the Broadway show inspiration?

46:50.680 --> 46:51.760
It was Rent.

46:51.760 --> 46:53.120
It was Grimlock and Four Ashes.

46:53.120 --> 46:54.120
And Rent was the last.

46:55.320 --> 46:58.040
Grimlock and Four Essence.

46:58.040 --> 47:01.680
Grimlock was the breakout star of the DinoBots.

47:01.680 --> 47:02.840
He was the Joan Jett.

47:04.840 --> 47:06.360
He's kind of an interesting transformer

47:06.360 --> 47:08.840
because his head, his robot head,

47:08.840 --> 47:13.000
was the size of a caper and it was nestled deep

47:13.000 --> 47:16.920
within the chest of a T-Rex

47:16.920 --> 47:19.240
with a much larger, more majestic head.

47:19.240 --> 47:23.320
Well, a T-Rex would have a brain the size of a P, Daniel.

47:23.320 --> 47:25.520
All right, so there is an...

47:25.520 --> 47:27.000
Ipsofacto.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.520
Rob, which...

47:31.520 --> 47:32.800
Yes.

47:32.800 --> 47:33.640
QED.

47:33.640 --> 47:34.480
Which...

47:36.000 --> 47:38.920
Which three transformers do you think

47:38.920 --> 47:40.840
you could do a passable impression of?

47:40.840 --> 47:43.640
Oh, well, Starscream, probably.

47:43.640 --> 47:46.640
What, James, can you do any transformers

47:46.640 --> 47:47.840
that aren't Starscream?

47:47.840 --> 47:49.160
Oh, you're gonna do Starscream?

47:49.160 --> 47:50.000
Yeah, I mean...

47:50.000 --> 47:51.160
Oh, yeah, I'll do Megatron.

47:51.160 --> 47:52.000
Okay, okay.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.960
Okay, and then, Dan, you'd be Grimlock.

47:53.960 --> 47:54.800
Okay.

47:54.800 --> 47:56.360
Okay, so let's do a little improv.

47:56.360 --> 47:59.160
Can I get a place where three transformers might meet?

47:59.160 --> 48:00.000
Barbecue.

48:00.000 --> 48:00.840
At a barbecue.

48:02.480 --> 48:06.200
Do you have any gluten-free options?

48:06.200 --> 48:11.160
Starscream, you're embarrassing me.

48:11.160 --> 48:16.160
If I have a wheat bun, I'm going to get brain fog.

48:16.160 --> 48:18.160
I am the leader of the Decepticons.

48:18.160 --> 48:21.160
I will order for you, and there will be gluten.

48:21.160 --> 48:22.160
Why?

48:23.160 --> 48:26.160
I'm getting a rash on my knee.

48:27.160 --> 48:30.160
Barista will take three inner job cues.

48:30.160 --> 48:33.160
Oh, look who's here, Grimlock.

48:33.160 --> 48:35.160
Oh, fucky sucky.

48:35.160 --> 48:39.160
Wow, why did you come over here?

48:41.160 --> 48:47.160
Hey, hey, have you checked out this slime wave pornography?

48:50.160 --> 48:54.160
Does that involve the false dicks, Starscream?

48:54.160 --> 49:01.160
It involves fake penises that squirt jeans.

49:03.160 --> 49:04.160
Fool.

49:04.160 --> 49:05.160
Ah.

49:05.160 --> 49:09.160
Grimlock likes slime wave.

49:10.160 --> 49:13.160
Grimlock have mylon fetish.

49:13.160 --> 49:15.160
Slime wave.

49:15.160 --> 49:18.160
Grimlock not know that nomenclature,

49:18.160 --> 49:25.160
but for a long time Grimlock been consuming lesbian strap on porn

49:26.160 --> 49:31.160
in which women wear pantyhose and are shot in high definition.

49:31.160 --> 49:33.160
Slime wave.

49:33.160 --> 49:39.160
And also have huge artificial tongs that shoot a giant,

49:39.160 --> 49:43.160
a transform into a tiny slime wave dick

49:43.160 --> 49:47.160
that doesn't match the size I am as a robot.

49:47.160 --> 49:50.160
I will hold you and shoot you.

49:50.160 --> 49:52.160
That's sound wave, I'm sound wave.

49:52.160 --> 50:01.160
Laserbeak, transform, mission, destruction.

50:01.160 --> 50:03.160
No, wait, you can play.

50:06.160 --> 50:08.160
Blaster.

50:09.160 --> 50:13.160
Oh man, we're really taking a beating over here, Optimus.

50:14.160 --> 50:18.160
It's a tape deck versus tape deck.

50:18.160 --> 50:23.160
It'll be the battle of the cassette guys.

50:23.160 --> 50:27.160
Hey, nobody calls Optimus Uncharismatic.

50:29.160 --> 50:34.160
First we crack the shell, then we crack the nuts inside.

50:34.160 --> 50:40.160
Oh, Optimus, well there's some crazy shit going on out there.

50:41.160 --> 50:44.160
I'm Scatman Crothers.

50:44.160 --> 50:56.160
I play a robot named Jazz in one of history's more embarrassing chapters.

51:00.160 --> 51:05.160
Well I'm Ironsides and I don't see a problem with it.

51:06.160 --> 51:11.160
Oh, as long as we can get along I think that's fine.

51:11.160 --> 51:17.160
I'm a red state minivan, arguably the least fearsome of the Autobots.

51:18.160 --> 51:20.160
I'm from Alabama.

51:20.160 --> 51:25.160
I'd love to help you as a beneficiary of the coastal elite.

51:32.160 --> 51:35.160
Can we get back to this slime wave thing?

51:35.160 --> 51:40.160
I mean, I'm not weird if I'm into it.

51:40.160 --> 51:45.160
Grimlock already say, love slime wave, not know it called that.

51:45.160 --> 51:49.160
Weird name for something more beautiful than that to Grimlock.

51:49.160 --> 51:53.160
Empowered women fucking each other with giant fake dicks.

51:53.160 --> 51:57.160
Grimlock like look at their legs while they do it.

51:58.160 --> 52:02.160
Starscream pull me out of Grimlock's ass.

52:05.160 --> 52:07.160
Oh, my foot!

52:07.160 --> 52:10.160
You fool!

52:10.160 --> 52:13.160
And see!

52:17.160 --> 52:23.160
I think the word fool is only ever said by a villain to another villain.

52:23.160 --> 52:29.160
It doesn't seem like that big of an insult, but if you've been in a vocal training it really lands.

52:29.160 --> 52:30.160
It sounds like...

52:30.160 --> 52:34.160
Fool! You have failed to see the dangers of your hubris!

52:34.160 --> 52:38.160
Why don't you eat all the shit?

52:38.160 --> 52:42.160
Because I'm going to fucking when I'm large-sized.

52:42.160 --> 52:44.160
Okay, alright.

52:44.160 --> 52:49.160
You guys do Cobra Commander and you do Destro.

52:49.160 --> 52:50.160
Oh, boy.

52:50.160 --> 52:53.160
Isn't that the same two voices?

52:53.160 --> 52:56.160
Yeah, but their status is flipped.

52:58.160 --> 53:00.160
Cobra Commander!

53:00.160 --> 53:02.160
Yes?

53:02.160 --> 53:08.160
We're here in this empty void space with no other suggestion or character.

53:08.160 --> 53:10.160
You and me!

53:10.160 --> 53:14.160
I've got a suitcase full of props.

53:14.160 --> 53:18.160
Here is a salamander.

53:18.160 --> 53:21.160
Here is a pair of scissors.

53:21.160 --> 53:23.160
Okay, alright, alright.

53:23.160 --> 53:24.160
Freeze, freeze.

53:24.160 --> 53:26.160
Can I get a style of movie?

53:26.160 --> 53:27.160
Western.

53:27.160 --> 53:29.160
Continue as a Western.

53:29.160 --> 53:34.160
Here is a six-shooter.

53:34.160 --> 53:37.160
That's not... that's... alright.

53:37.160 --> 53:43.160
If you reach for it, I'll have to obey you.

53:43.160 --> 53:45.160
I'm reaching for it.

53:45.160 --> 53:49.160
Very well, sir.

53:49.160 --> 53:53.160
Hi guys, it's me, Sir Pantor.

53:53.160 --> 53:55.160
Why are you floating so high up there?

53:55.160 --> 53:57.160
Come down here.

53:57.160 --> 54:01.160
Why did you come down here to our level?

54:01.160 --> 54:08.160
I just want to let you guys know I really appreciate you making me out of the DNA of six of the world's leaders.

54:08.160 --> 54:10.160
Whatever that storyline was.

54:10.160 --> 54:11.160
Yes!

54:11.160 --> 54:16.160
Yes, it was Gorbachev.

54:16.160 --> 54:18.160
Idi Amin.

54:18.160 --> 54:24.160
I feel like it was like all of the world's conquerors were the convenient sidestepping of the world.

54:24.160 --> 54:26.160
Get off me!

54:26.160 --> 54:31.160
I'm 14 now, and I'm just living up in the attic room.

54:31.160 --> 54:35.160
We always pushed you too hard at a young age.

54:35.160 --> 54:37.160
I don't really think we need this guy here.

54:37.160 --> 54:39.160
Excuse me, what? Sorry.

54:39.160 --> 54:44.160
I don't think... I just... why would we have another big bad?

54:44.160 --> 54:48.160
You know, we have... we already... the position is taken.

54:48.160 --> 54:54.160
Because you aren't good enough. I didn't ask to be amuleted.

54:54.160 --> 54:55.160
Float.

54:55.160 --> 54:57.160
It could be real, you asshole.

54:57.160 --> 55:00.160
Sepidar, Cobra Commander, the horizon, look!

55:00.160 --> 55:07.160
The Jews, ground forces, and air forces are approaching at exactly the same speed.

55:07.160 --> 55:11.160
Yee-haw!

55:11.160 --> 55:14.160
From their nearby base.

55:14.160 --> 55:16.160
Ski lift!

55:16.160 --> 55:17.160
Lasso dick!

55:17.160 --> 55:19.160
Megan's Law!

55:19.160 --> 55:20.160
Broken mirror!

55:20.160 --> 55:23.160
Go forward!

55:23.160 --> 55:25.160
Whoo!

55:25.160 --> 55:27.160
Shish kebab!

55:27.160 --> 55:30.160
S'more spaghetti!

55:30.160 --> 55:33.160
Roe butter boy!

55:33.160 --> 55:35.160
BTK!

55:35.160 --> 55:40.160
Power bottom!

55:40.160 --> 55:43.160
Bernie Bro!

55:43.160 --> 55:44.160
Gas light!

55:44.160 --> 55:46.160
Actually...

55:46.160 --> 55:51.160
What about...

55:51.160 --> 55:53.160
What about...

55:53.160 --> 55:58.160
Alright, the G.I. Joe's would have to have an internet force now.

55:58.160 --> 56:06.160
They probably get most of their work done with bot swarms and troll farms.

56:06.160 --> 56:09.160
Barbecue, how's it going on that troll farm?

56:09.160 --> 56:11.160
Cobra never knew what hit him.

56:11.160 --> 56:13.160
Are you just Southern because you're barbecue?

56:13.160 --> 56:17.160
I don't ever heard my voice. I was more of a Transformers.

56:17.160 --> 56:19.160
What did barbecue sound like?

56:19.160 --> 56:21.160
I don't know.

56:21.160 --> 56:25.160
Same as iron sights!

56:25.160 --> 56:32.160
Vinegar, ketchup, and a gun smoke!

56:32.160 --> 56:35.160
Alright, now do the banana splits.

56:35.160 --> 56:39.160
I'm kidding, that's for Noah.

56:39.160 --> 56:41.160
Spencer!

56:41.160 --> 56:43.160
Hey guys.

56:43.160 --> 56:50.160
G.I. Joe's base was always a nice commute away from where Cobra was.

56:50.160 --> 56:52.160
Yeah, I pitched it.

56:52.160 --> 56:55.160
I want to do a show that's like...

56:55.160 --> 56:59.160
I don't want to go all the way so ironic with it that it's like Robot Chicken,

56:59.160 --> 57:05.160
but I want to do a Mad Men level workplace comedy that goes back and forth between G.I. Joe and Cobra.

57:05.160 --> 57:13.160
Yes, it will be comedic, but on a grounded level.

57:13.160 --> 57:17.160
Accepting the what if of what if these organizations existed.

57:17.160 --> 57:20.160
All the instant pressure that puts everyone under.

57:20.160 --> 57:23.160
We're having problems with our funding!

57:23.160 --> 57:25.160
The women in Cobra, they don't have HR.

57:25.160 --> 57:27.160
You're not going to do bits of Cobra has HR,

57:27.160 --> 57:29.160
but you have women that work for Cobra and they're going to be like,

57:29.160 --> 57:31.160
I need to assert myself.

57:31.160 --> 57:33.160
It's like Orange is the new black.

57:33.160 --> 57:35.160
It's an issue to deal with.

57:35.160 --> 57:37.160
There's different from the women in G.I. Joe.

57:37.160 --> 57:39.160
Everybody's just cracking all the time.

57:39.160 --> 57:41.160
Everybody's just going like,

57:41.160 --> 57:43.160
here's our briefing,

57:43.160 --> 57:45.160
and then go get on Miojo,

57:45.160 --> 57:47.160
and then if the camera just stays behind,

57:47.160 --> 57:49.160
and just have people just rub their eyes,

57:49.160 --> 57:53.160
and then just have somebody come in,

57:53.160 --> 57:57.160
and just have that music going like...

57:57.160 --> 58:01.160
Hey, can somebody pick up my laundry?

58:01.160 --> 58:04.160
I'm so busy right now.

58:04.160 --> 58:08.160
There was an episode I saw as an adult, G.I. Joe,

58:08.160 --> 58:11.160
and obviously none of it's written as comedy,

58:11.160 --> 58:14.160
so someone had to do this without making a joke out of it.

58:14.160 --> 58:16.160
But the Joes like crashed,

58:16.160 --> 58:19.160
they like crash landed into the Cobra base,

58:19.160 --> 58:21.160
and it broke through the wall,

58:21.160 --> 58:24.160
I swear to God, into the Cobra cafeteria.

58:24.160 --> 58:26.160
And there were all these Cobra guys with their lunch trays,

58:26.160 --> 58:28.160
and they were like,

58:28.160 --> 58:31.160
and it was not played for laughs,

58:31.160 --> 58:33.160
but they had to animate it,

58:33.160 --> 58:36.160
get it back from Korea.

58:36.160 --> 58:38.160
Yeah, and those guys,

58:38.160 --> 58:40.160
there's so much intermingling,

58:40.160 --> 58:42.160
like one guy's another guy's brother,

58:42.160 --> 58:44.160
like if you're in Cobra or G.I. Joe,

58:44.160 --> 58:46.160
you're in a fraternal organization,

58:46.160 --> 58:48.160
like, oh, Snowsteam,

58:48.160 --> 58:50.160
my long lost twin,

58:50.160 --> 58:54.160
we were separated as children by a ninja,

58:54.160 --> 58:56.160
because he's me,

58:56.160 --> 58:58.160
but my action figures painted differently.

58:58.160 --> 59:02.160
Maybe the Baroness has like a valid grievance against G.I. Joe's.

59:02.160 --> 59:05.160
They scooped my eyeball out.

59:05.160 --> 59:07.160
I was tortured by them.

59:07.160 --> 59:09.160
Yeah, yeah, like they're always like,

59:09.160 --> 59:13.160
oh, so much for the compassionate left.

59:15.160 --> 59:17.160
We never said we were left.

59:17.160 --> 59:20.160
And I assumed we were right wing.

59:20.160 --> 59:26.160
Everyone's left of us, Cobra!

59:26.160 --> 59:29.160
Or are they, do they consider themselves left?

59:29.160 --> 59:30.160
That's amazing.

59:30.160 --> 59:32.160
That's what we need right now.

59:32.160 --> 59:35.160
We need Cobra and G.I. Joe engaged in adult dialogue

59:35.160 --> 59:37.160
so that the children that we are

59:37.160 --> 59:40.160
can start to understand how fucked the world is.

59:40.160 --> 59:42.160
Because Cobra Commander wouldn't be like,

59:42.160 --> 59:45.160
you know, I'm kind of conservative.

59:45.160 --> 59:47.160
Like, he wouldn't consider himself conservative.

59:47.160 --> 59:49.160
Perhaps horseshoe theory is valid.

59:49.160 --> 59:54.160
The extreme right and the extreme left come back to join.

59:59.160 --> 01:00:01.160
Another idea lost to the ages.

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:03.160
Lost to the ages.

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:04.160
What do I got to do?

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:07.160
Write a crazy script and put it on Twitter and, you know,

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.160
be like, hmm, look at that.

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.160
Yeah.

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:15.160
That's the most promising development process.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.160
Write a fake thing, put it on Twitter,

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:20.160
and then see if that works.

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:25.160
Ahhhh.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:26.160
You like my Steve?

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.160
Ohhhh.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.160
Shoo-bop, shoo-bop.

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:33.160
Let me see if I got one more thing.

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.160
Can you hold this?

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.160
James, do you want to stick around and play some deep?

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.160
Dad?

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.160
James, do you want to stick around and play a little D&D with us

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:40.160
to close the show?

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:42.160
Yes, yes, I am a...

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.160
Oh, is that the test?

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.160
I only know how to play Axis and Allies.

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.160
I'm out of my depth here.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:51.160
Spencer, can we dovetail some domes in here?

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.160
What?

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:56.160
Can we bring James into the game here?

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.160
Yeah, no, yeah.

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.160
Which one?

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.160
Did I talk about that button?

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.160
Yeah.

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:05.160
Cody sent me this link to this article.

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:09.160
It says, the headline says,

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:13.160
Ohio man sentenced after attempting to seduce undercover officer

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:15.160
with chicken Alfredo.

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:18.160
And it's just an article about a guy who got,

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.160
basically, you know, he's like,

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.160
oh, is an undercover officer in a chat room

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:24.160
and this guy thought he was talking to a 15-year-old boy.

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:26.160
Oh, shit, I lost it.

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.160
Slime Wave.

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:32.160
And he was like, I'll be there with Slime Wave.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.160
Slime Wave is the perfect name for a transformer.

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.160
Yes.

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.160
There's Shockwave, Soundwave.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.160
Why not Slime Wave?

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:40.160
How come no one did Slime Wave?

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:42.160
He transforms into a dick.

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.160
Wait, let's just listen.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.160
We're going to button this up.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.160
This is great.

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:47.160
You're going to love it.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.160
He thought he was talking to a 15-year-old boy online,

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:52.160
but it was actually an undercover Austin Town police officer.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:55.160
He arranged to meet the officer in Austin Town.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.160
He planned to bring lubricant,

01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:01.160
sprite, and chicken Alfredo to the date.

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.160
I'm telling you.

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.160
Seven Up just lost another fucking...

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:07.160
Another customer.

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:10.160
Seven Up, if you're listening to this podcast,

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.160
get in the game.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.160
You are losing.

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.160
You are losing.

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.160
You've been losing for a while, Seven Up.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:19.160
Seven Up, you've been losing.

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.160
I know you're fascinated with these.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:25.160
When you did the Pac-Man commercial back in the 90s.

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:29.160
They're a failing lime and soda.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:34.160
They're a limited lime, and they're failing at both.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:39.160
We need to put thirst first.

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:41.160
That's the liberal alternative?

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.160
A thirst first soda policy.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:46.160
I was trying to do Trump, and you were talking sprite talk.

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:51.160
When our calories go low, their calories go high.

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:54.160
You don't want high calories.

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:57.160
What I love about these local news articles,

01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.160
because they're usually like,

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:01.160
oh, this is California news, or Los Angeles news,

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:03.160
or the desert region outside LA news,

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:06.160
and then there'll be one comment.

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:09.160
Somebody will say, 18 hours ago,

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:13.160
this is footprints in the snow.

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:16.160
This person is not a hotspot for this person.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.160
There was a guy underneath this article that was like,

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:21.160
seven days?

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:24.160
Geez, no wonder we got a pedophile problem.

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:27.160
I kept looking at him, where did he get seven days?

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.160
I don't even know what he's talking about.

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.160
It's like the ring.

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:34.160
Seven days, by the way,

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:36.160
probably would be a good...

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.160
If he means seven days in prison,

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:40.160
I think that would be pretty good for somebody

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:46.160
whose crime was like meeting a cop in a chat room

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:48.160
that got them to say,

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:51.160
I'll fuck you with some chicken alfredo.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:54.160
That's all the FBI does.

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:58.160
They go in chat rooms and go, hey, you want to do a crime?

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:02.160
Yeah, my heart goes out to law enforcement agencies this.

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:05.160
Do you like heavy creams and sauces?

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:08.160
I feel like, oh, you're not going to make a headline by going,

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:12.160
FBI realizes that cycles of abuse are the key

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:14.160
and spends a bunch of money

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:17.160
that will only pay off in 25 years

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:19.160
when this generation of abused children

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:22.160
stops abusing the next generation.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:25.160
The long headline, the long headline.

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:28.160
J. Edgar Hoover left a time capsule

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.160
that's going to make up for everything.

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:33.160
So they're just like, how do you bust a pedophile?

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.160
How do you bust them? We need a big bust.

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:38.160
We need a big pile of pedophilia on a table.

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:40.160
So then they go into chat rooms.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.160
Like on the local news?

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:48.160
We recovered five compact computers.

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:50.160
I'm 15.

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:52.160
I sure would like some chicken alfredo.

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:54.160
I don't know what I'd do for it.

01:04:54.160 --> 01:05:00.160
44 kilos of chicken alfredo sauce in powdered form.

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:02.160
It's fucking cold here.

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:05.160
It's fucking freezing. Are you cold?

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.160
It's good for last, right?

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.160
Yeah.

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:12.160
Look, in my view,

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:14.160
I feel that for far too long,

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:17.160
the top 1% of 7up has gotten

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:23.160
a far larger percentage of the bubbles than they deserve.

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:27.160
Over 60% of the bubbles available

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:30.160
that are carbon dioxide in the can of 7up

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:36.160
are going to the top 0.07 of the soda at the top of the can.

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:39.160
In my view, we should flatten the soda,

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:41.160
remove all the bubbles,

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:44.160
and we all get sweet lime flavored syrup.

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:50.160
Lemon and lime should not be...

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:53.160
These are public resources.

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:55.160
Yeah, I believe that the government...

01:05:55.160 --> 01:06:00.160
There should be a government allotted amount of lemon and lime

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.160
and carbon dioxide,

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:11.160
and individual communities can do what they will.

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:15.160
I didn't have any dinner.

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:17.160
Me neither.

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:21.160
I had a pasta lunch.

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:23.160
Did you have chicken alfredo?

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:25.160
I had a chicken alfredo.

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:27.160
Was that you?

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:29.160
No.

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:31.160
Never mind.

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:35.160
I had an impossible burger with Joel.

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:37.160
Nice.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:40.160
Go on.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:44.160
I felt like I was supposed to feel bad about not feeding you a minute ago.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:49.160
Now you're just trying to brag that you ate food with our friend.

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:51.160
You want to go for a baguette?

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:52.160
No.

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.160
Slime wave.

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:55.160
Okay.

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:58.160
I'm like a hold up in a bedroom eating protein bars,

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:00.160
just waiting...

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:04.160
Whether I die or...

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:07.160
Maybe it's the power trying to come back on.

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.160
Schrab's coming to Boston,

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:12.160
and he just told me backstage that he's fine coach.

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:14.160
Yeah, something like that.

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.160
That's cool.

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:20.160
It took me a while before I got bumped up.

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:22.160
You got to put it in the hours.

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:24.160
Yeah, that's cool.

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.160
You got to put it in the hours.

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:29.160
You got to put it in the hours.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:34.160
Going to cradle con, I'm going to be doing a panel,

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:37.160
and I'm hoping Spencer moderates it.

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:39.160
Yeah, he was hoping.

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:42.160
Yep.

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:46.160
I would have gotten you a first class ticket to Boston.

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:48.160
I know.

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:50.160
Why don't we try to upgrade him?

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:53.160
I got to go to DC in July.

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.160
Can you help me out?

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:59.160
Okay, here we go.

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.160
Steve Levy, everybody!

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.160
Steve Levy.

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:05.160
He's on the show.

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.160
He's on the show.

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:09.160
I'm hungry, too.

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:11.160
God damn, I've been drinking nothing but vodka.

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:14.160
I already booked Schrab first class to Boston and back.

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:15.160
Wait a second.

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:18.160
Well, that would make Schrab a fucking liar.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.160
Wait, so...

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:22.160
I did it backstage when I found out about it.

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:26.160
He ate dinner. He's flying first class.

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:30.160
This guy doesn't even know what slime wave is.

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:32.160
Jack Hughes!

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:34.160
Oh, no!

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.160
Yeah.

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:38.160
Jack Hughes.

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.160
Why are you shaking your head at me?

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.160
I don't know.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:45.160
Just, you know...

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.160
Thank you, sir.

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:50.160
Let's get out of here.

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.160
I'm sorry, Steve.

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:55.160
I mean, why were you flying coach in the first place?

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:58.160
I don't want to shame anybody.

01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:00.160
Were you shaming him?

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.160
No, no, no.

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:04.160
Who would it be on?

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:08.160
Look at this character that's on the popcorn bag.

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.160
You love him.

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.160
Look at him.

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.160
That's Bart Simpson's cousin.

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:17.160
He's saying awesome pop songs.

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:21.160
He's saying awesome popcorn.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:23.160
Look at that. That's pretty fun.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:26.160
I don't expect the venue to fly him out.

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:28.160
I know he's my burden.

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:30.160
No, no, no, no.

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:33.160
They invited me out...

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:36.160
with separate of you.

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:42.160
And so you went over my head,

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:45.160
and it turned out they'll only get you coach.

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:47.160
No.

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.160
I didn't go over anybody's head.

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:51.160
Okay. What airline is it?

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:53.160
JetBlue.

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.160
They listen to the podcast.

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.160
No longer.

01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:59.160
That's true, yeah.

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:01.160
All right. James, you understand that?

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:03.160
I had your druid stealth.

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:05.160
You understand the basic idea here, right?

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:07.160
No. Do I have to pretend I get it?

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.160
You're going to listen to Spencer lay down the rules

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:12.160
and watch the four of us make no sense out of what's going on.

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:15.160
Once years ago, and it was widely panned

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.160
on this very podcast,

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:20.160
did you make the mistake of following up

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:23.160
and looking at some Reddit thread or something?

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:27.160
Oh, no, no, no. They sent reviews to my house.

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.160
Okay.

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:31.160
All right, Spencer, let me know when you're ready to go

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.160
and we'll do a little recap.

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:36.160
Give it to me. He's not going to eat that on top of it?

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:38.160
I'm starving.

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:40.160
Fucking.

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.160
I didn't think about it.

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:44.160
There's probably butter on it.

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.160
Yeah, and there's probably butter on it.

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.160
You want some?

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.160
No, it's got butter on it.

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.160
No, popcorn's good for you.

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:55.160
But it's got whole grains, they say,

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:57.160
which seems like a cheat.

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:59.160
It's got whole grains like corn.

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:01.160
Like whole fucking kernels.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.160
That's a whole grain.

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:05.160
That's as whole as a grain can get.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.160
Corn doesn't seem like a grain.

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:10.160
It's like a bunch of fruits on a stick. It's a whole grain.

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.160
It's a whole bunch of grains.

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:15.160
I'm not going to write tonight.

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:18.160
You're going to be one of your popcorn hazes.

01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:22.160
Blackout Popcorn, Soapy's Choice Book, and Kevin Klein.

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:24.160
I know you.

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:27.160
You'll hopped up on popcorns, won't you?

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.160
Thanks to the facts.

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.160
Are we all ready to pay attention to Spencer now?

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:36.160
That sounded accusatory.

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:38.160
It's all good.

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:40.160
Right, no, I know.

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:44.160
I didn't think you were accusing me of not being ready to be listened to.

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:54.160
Last time on Harmon Time, our heroes were still in that fight.

01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:57.160
They had gotten in that fight to find Patchens,

01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:59.160
who had gotten in way over his head.

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:02.160
And they did get in way over their heads, but they fought.

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:07.160
It was a good fight, and they basically won because...

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:09.160
Well, what happened?

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:12.160
A dwarf came out with a wiffleball bat and teleported Jeff,

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:14.160
who was currently a tree into a shed.

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:16.160
And then a bear showed up.

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:18.160
His name was Bernie Mac.

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:24.160
The fight finished when one of the guys dropped his gun,

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:26.160
and then someone, I think it was Steve,

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:30.160
cut him real bad with a sword, and he started screaming and crying.

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:35.160
And then a dude came back to life and was a vampire, and ran away.

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:42.160
Anyway, find out whether or not they'll solve the mystery.

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.160
Thank you, Spencer.

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:51.160
So, let's look around the room and see what the...

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:54.160
Has the dust settled, and we can look around.

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:56.160
So, Jeff, you've made it back to the guys.

01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:00.160
You're back in the underground of this theater house.

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:02.160
You're in the storage room.

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.160
You're there, and James, you're playing Bernie Mac,

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:07.160
who's a bear that literally just showed up and can talk.

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:09.160
So, you could do what a bear can do.

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:13.160
Imagine being a bear that can talk pretty much there.

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:16.160
Like Country Bear Jamboree.

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:21.160
Except more dangerous, or the same amount of dangerous.

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:26.160
Didn't somebody die a long time ago at the Country Bear Jamboree in Disneyland?

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:28.160
Why are you looking at me?

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:30.160
Yeah, because it's not the D&D.

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:32.160
They got mauled by an animatronic bear.

01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:34.160
It's called I-Lines. I don't want to upstage everybody,

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.160
but look at this guy over here.

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:39.160
He came swinging down on a porch swing,

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:42.160
and then just mauled them.

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:44.160
Okay, so we're right in this theater.

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:46.160
We got Bernie Mac the Bear.

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:50.160
You got this guy who's screaming and bleeding, kind of like a hostage.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.160
Everyone else is dead.

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:55.160
But I can talk.

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:56.160
Hey, Carlos.

01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:00.160
Carlos, interrogate this guy before he bleeds out.

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:02.160
I interrogate this guy.

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.160
Okay, how do you want to do it?

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:07.160
I put my foot on him.

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:10.160
No, I can't do that. I can't do that.

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:12.160
Classic criminology.

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:19.160
Well, can I use a form of the spell?

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.160
You know, I have, like, cure light wounds,

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.160
and I can use those to inflict wounds.

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:25.160
Would that be to say that I could, like,

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:28.160
could I use my wound-affecting energy

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:36.160
to kind of, like, basically, magically open and shut his wounds?

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:40.160
You can do that, but it would take, like,

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.160
basically the last of your magic,

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:44.160
because you've been casting a lot of spells today,

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.160
so you're pretty low.

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:46.160
Well, it should be worth it.

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.160
I'm sure it's going to be a jackpot of information.

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:50.160
I have the spell stabilized,

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:53.160
which can cause a dying creature to stabilize their condition.

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.160
So you can kill him.

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.160
I don't think we want him stabilized.

01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:59.160
I think we're going to milk the fruit that is a man

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:02.160
on the cusp of both worlds.

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:05.160
Wow.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:10.160
You exist on the threshold

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:14.160
of what the Church of Silver light regards as worthy.

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:16.160
You can make a choice,

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.160
provide us with information

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:21.160
that will guide the light to cleanse the world

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:24.160
and slip back into mortality,

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:27.160
or lose your grip forever and plummet

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:30.160
in the margins of the forgotten.

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:36.160
Oh, damn.

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:38.160
Not bad.

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:41.160
He goes, oh, yeah, no, okay.

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:43.160
What do you want?

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.160
That's crazy.

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:49.160
You know I just got into this because I love acting, but...

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.160
Yeah, it seems like someone's acting

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:54.160
like they don't have the information that we want.

01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:56.160
Where is the gem?

01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:58.160
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:01.160
No, I'm kidding, I don't say Patchens' Jump.

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:03.160
God damn it.

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:05.160
This is the part where I fail.

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.160
You can ask me questions.

01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.160
I have a question.

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:08.160
Okay.

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:09.160
Am I the bear that mauled the guy?

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:10.160
Is that why he's been hurt?

01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:11.160
Not that guy.

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:12.160
You killed the other guy.

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:13.160
Like, he's dead.

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:15.160
The guy you killed is dead.

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:18.160
Okay, so I was worried you were undoing my work.

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.160
Sorry.

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:24.160
I look through the body of the dead man.

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:26.160
Okay, he's already been looted by Jeff.

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:34.160
Okay, I look through his body.

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:36.160
What does that mean?

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:39.160
I don't look through his clothes.

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:44.160
I look through his body because I'm like swamp thing, alright?

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:47.160
So I'm gonna look inside.

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:48.160
Uh-huh.

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:49.160
Right?

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:50.160
Right.

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:51.160
What do I see?

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:52.160
What do you mean by look inside?

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:53.160
Like using extrasensory perception?

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:55.160
I look.

01:16:55.160 --> 01:17:00.160
Inside his body.

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.160
Okay.

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.160
Sounds like he's...

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:04.160
You mean like looking inside his open wounds?

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:06.160
Like do you open him up?

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:07.160
Yeah.

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:08.160
His butthole?

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:09.160
Okay.

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.160
No.

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:11.160
Okay.

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:12.160
Alright, so...

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:15.160
I open up his mouth and I look inside...

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:16.160
Okay.

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:17.160
His body...

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:18.160
Yeah.

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:19.160
Swamps thing style.

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:20.160
Right.

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:25.160
He looks like a person.

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:27.160
He learned interesting things.

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:28.160
And?

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:30.160
About humans.

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:31.160
And?

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:32.160
That's all.

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:35.160
I didn't read swamp thing.

01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:36.160
Or listen to it.

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:40.160
Was it a sound?

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:42.160
It was a sound.

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:47.160
The environment gets mad at people and sends Alan Moore to write something.

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:54.160
No, I snaky vine like down his throat and look around, you know?

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:55.160
Yeah.

01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:56.160
Okay.

01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:57.160
So the dead guy.

01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:58.160
Yeah.

01:17:58.160 --> 01:17:59.160
No.

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.160
He's normal.

01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:01.160
But dead.

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:02.160
Okay.

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:03.160
Alright.

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:04.160
Normally dead.

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.160
Yeah.

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.160
He's entirely president of this deadness.

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:07.160
Nothing.

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:08.160
Couldn't find anything.

01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:10.160
You guys see all that unfold.

01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:11.160
Alright.

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.160
I'm out of ideas.

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.160
Spencer, you said I could ask you questions.

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:15.160
Yeah.

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:20.160
You know, fucking like a lifeline there and go, okay, I'm drunk when we're playing this.

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:21.160
Yeah.

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:22.160
I don't remember over the spans of the ages.

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:23.160
Right.

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.160
Who could?

01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:26.160
We were on this case.

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:29.160
We traced these guys down.

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:35.160
We're looking for these like dragon born kind of dragon marked guys.

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:36.160
Right?

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.160
A little bit.

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.160
So, okay.

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:40.160
You came here looking for the gem.

01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:42.160
You found that Shrove might know where the gem is.

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:44.160
You took Shrove hostage and he wasn't talking.

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:48.160
You found a tiny bit of information about a drop point, but you didn't know where the

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.160
drop point is.

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:50.160
Right.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.160
Okay.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.160
You thought Shrove could help you out, but he didn't and he fucked off.

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:56.160
So, then you went looking essentially for more clues and that's where you are now.

01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:57.160
Okay.

01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.160
Still trying to find that drop point.

01:18:58.160 --> 01:18:59.160
So, here we go.

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:00.160
Where's Shrove?

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.160
Yeah.

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:02.160
There we go.

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:03.160
I don't know, man.

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:04.160
I think he was fighting the fire.

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:06.160
You know there's a fire happening right now?

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:08.160
You piece of shit.

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:10.160
I didn't do it.

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:15.160
By the power of the Silver Flame, you show no fire.

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:16.160
I'm complying.

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:17.160
What?

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:18.160
I'm complying.

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:19.160
Well, where's Shrove?

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:20.160
I don't.

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.160
I don't.

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:22.160
I think he might be fighting fires.

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:23.160
Okay.

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:24.160
One more thing though.

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:25.160
Just in case.

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:28.160
The Silver Flame is not helping with the fires that are raging.

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:29.160
Right.

01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:30.160
Thank you.

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:32.160
I could connect those dots.

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:33.160
That would be fine.

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:34.160
What are you guys talking about?

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:37.160
I want to ask you one more thing.

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:41.160
Wait, so this is where Shrove and...

01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:43.160
Where's the drop point?

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:46.160
Probably where the fire is.

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:47.160
Let me...

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:48.160
No, I don't think it is.

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:53.160
But it seems like the fire might get close if you don't hurry.

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.160
I'll tell you where it is.

01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:56.160
Where it is.

01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:59.160
It's in Boykin's Pig Farm.

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:01.160
What's your name?

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:08.160
My name is Burfboro Binkus.

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:14.160
Do your friends call you something shorter?

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:15.160
Binkus.

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:16.160
Sorry?

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:17.160
Binkus.

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:18.160
Binkus.

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.160
Binkus.

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.160
Binkus.

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:21.160
Binkus with a B.

01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:22.160
Binkus.

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:23.160
Binkus.

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:24.160
Binkus.

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:25.160
Burfboro.

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:26.160
Binkus.

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:27.160
Do you guys smell fire?

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:28.160
Binkus.

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:29.160
Binkus.

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:30.160
Binkus?

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:32.160
I can't understand.

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:36.160
Let's just all decide to call him Binkus.

01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:37.160
Binkus.

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:38.160
Is Binkus close?

01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:39.160
It's very close.

01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:40.160
All right, Binkus.

01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:44.160
You lucked the fuck out by the power of the Silver Flame.

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:45.160
Your wounds are healed.

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:47.160
Oh, thanks, man.

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:48.160
Move on.

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:49.160
Move on.

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:51.160
Tell us the name of the pig farm again.

01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:54.160
Boykin Hodges Pig Farm and Stabulary.

01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.160
Let's go.

01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:59.160
So help me Christ, Binkus.

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:01.160
Once Christ is invented.

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:05.160
I'm scared of this fire.

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:07.160
It's all right, Beharney.

01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:13.160
You can call me Orson Welles, the bear.

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:15.160
So help me Christ, Binkus.

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:19.160
If we go to that fire and it doesn't pan out for us, and yes, you have to allow for the

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:23.160
fact that we're inept, so it might not work out for us through no fault of your own.

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:26.160
We will be back and we will fuck you up.

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.160
We'll fuck up your family.

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:30.160
We will rip the children from your mother's arms.

01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:34.160
And we will put them in things that we convince people aren't cages.

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:39.160
And if they still convinces their cages, we'll say it was Obama's idea.

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:45.160
Like, we can go round and round, Binkus.

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:47.160
I'm trying to help.

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.160
How do we get to the pig farm?

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:50.160
Which direction is it?

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:51.160
North.

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:52.160
Wait.

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:56.160
Guys, I have no direction, so I can just turn north.

01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:57.160
It's that way.

01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:58.160
All right.

01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:01.160
Follow me, motherfuckers.

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:06.160
Am I cool to join you guys?

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:07.160
Yes, please.

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:12.160
I'm not sure if I'm loyal to your party, but it seems fun for now.

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:17.160
A lot of people that have no direction, you're not supposed to follow.

01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:20.160
No one tells bear rules.

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:25.160
Okay, so you head outside and there is indeed a fire.

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:30.160
It's started by the tavern, and it's grown wildly out of control on account of the town

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:33.160
is protected by a big flammable wall.

01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:38.160
It's starting to engulf the town as you head north to Boykin Hodge's pig farm, which you do.

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:41.160
Did we start this fire?

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:45.160
We didn't start the fire.

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:48.160
It was always burning, arguably.

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:49.160
Yeah.

01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:54.160
It seems too big to have started it, but you do remember starting a fire.

01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:59.160
It wasn't my brand of cigarettes.

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:01.160
You go to the pig farm.

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:05.160
It's like a farmhouse with a little...

01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:06.160
No, sorry.

01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:08.160
It's a farmhouse with a barn.

01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:13.160
So then the barn is next to the stablery, which is like a customer-facing stablery

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:15.160
where you put your own horses and stuff.

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:20.160
And then out the back behind the barn, that's where all the pigs is.

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:23.160
We got to save these pigs.

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.160
The pigs are in back.

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:30.160
We should have asked specifically where the drop point...

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:32.160
Who?

01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:33.160
Mingus.

01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:35.160
We should have asked him.

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:37.160
You can ask him.

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:40.160
Mingus was specifically where at the pig farm.

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:43.160
Because a point sounds very specific.

01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:44.160
Oh, yeah.

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:45.160
I'll tell you.

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:49.160
It's in this corner of the third pig stable.

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:50.160
Thank you.

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:52.160
Uh-oh.

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:55.160
Oh, Christ, Mingus, if you're lying.

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:58.160
Do we have to throw birds at it?

01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:01.160
All the pigs to make them fall down?

01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:05.160
I don't know nothing about no pig fighting.

01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:13.160
Mingus, if you're lying, I'm going to wear your ass like a face mask.

01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:18.160
I'm going to go for trick-or-treat as your ass.

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:20.160
And it's going to be one of those costumes where it's just...

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:24.160
Most of the attention is put into the plastic your ass face.

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:30.160
And then the rest is just a plastic apron with a picture of you from head to toe on it.

01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:34.160
A lot of people will point out it's not a costume.

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:39.160
Would this singular hole be for your mouth or your one eye?

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:41.160
For one eye, probably.

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:43.160
I don't think Mingus wants to find out.

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:44.160
Okay.

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:45.160
Yeah, man.

01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:46.160
I don't know.

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:48.160
You should talk to Boykin Hodge.

01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:50.160
He doesn't really talk.

01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:51.160
Hey, guys.

01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:52.160
I don't know.

01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:55.160
I mean, like, what are we doing here?

01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:58.160
I'm starting to question a lot.

01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:03.160
I mean, you guys were cool for letting me come along and we had some fun, but what are we doing?

01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:05.160
All right, well, let's get to the...

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:07.160
Stick it out, Gary.

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:09.160
His name is Garry Shandling.

01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:10.160
He's a Shambling Mound.

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:11.160
I'm a Shambling Mound.

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:12.160
I'm getting hungry.

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:13.160
Can I eat a pig?

01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:14.160
There we go.

01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:15.160
Yeah.

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:17.160
We'll incentivize Barney Mack to come along.

01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:18.160
Let's go to the pig farm.

01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:23.160
Third pig's pen from the left in the corner.

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:24.160
Drop point.

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:25.160
No one should be eating the pig.

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:26.160
They're adorable.

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:27.160
We got to save the pigs from the fire.

01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:28.160
Jesus Christ.

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:31.160
Come on, Gary.

01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:33.160
Back me up on this.

01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:35.160
Let's just do one thing.

01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:37.160
One thing right.

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:44.160
Until we decide, I'll just have this pig sitting in front of me with an apple and I'll be deliciously

01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:46.160
sharpening my knife.

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:50.160
Let's go to the cocksuckin' pig farm.

01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:51.160
Wait a minute.

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:55.160
What kind of pigs are these?

01:25:55.160 --> 01:26:00.160
Pigs are having a real blast.

01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:05.160
This is a different kind of pig farm.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:09.160
I start wandering off just like muttering to myself.

01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:10.160
Wait.

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:13.160
Are these just sex pigs?

01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:17.160
Yes, you can do whatever you want with these pigs.

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:18.160
It's pretty gross.

01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:19.160
It's a little gross.

01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.160
It's a little hot.

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:24.160
Customers are always right.

01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:30.160
Is there, like, what's the cutest one?

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:33.160
Like, what, like, where?

01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:34.160
Charlotte.

01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:35.160
Charlotte?

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:36.160
Okay.

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:39.160
Why is she the cutest?

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.160
Let's just go.

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:42.160
I go to the third pig pen.

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.160
All right.

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:50.160
You go back to the pig area and you see a pier almost as if supernaturally, like this crazy

01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:51.160
old bald guy.

01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:58.160
He looks like a really angry farmer, like an old hardworn farmer.

01:26:58.160 --> 01:26:59.160
Sir.

01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:04.160
He goes, are you choking?

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:08.160
I think we got to do the Heimlich on this guy.

01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:09.160
You all right?

01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:10.160
He points to his voice.

01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:11.160
He's about to have vocal surgery.

01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:12.160
He points to what?

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:15.160
He points to a big button on his chest.

01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:19.160
He points, what?

01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:22.160
I think, I think he doesn't, I think he can't speak.

01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:24.160
I think he's lost the ability to speak.

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:25.160
He points at you while you're saying that.

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:26.160
He points at me.

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:27.160
He points at you?

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:28.160
While he's saying that.

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:29.160
I can speak?

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:32.160
Oh, he's pointing like bingo, like he can't speak.

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:33.160
Hey.

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:34.160
Why can't you speak?

01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:35.160
Are you dying?

01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:36.160
No.

01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:37.160
He just can't speak.

01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:38.160
Does anybody know sign language?

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:40.160
Are you a good person?

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:41.160
He nods, yeah.

01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:42.160
He's what?

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:43.160
He nods.

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:44.160
He nods.

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:45.160
Is this the drop point?

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:46.160
Yeah.

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:47.160
Darth Vader would nod.

01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:49.160
He looks at you quizzically.

01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:53.160
Do you know who Darth Vader is?

01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:56.160
Can anyone, does anyone telepathy?

01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:58.160
Darth Vader would nod.

01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:01.160
Wait, well listen, we're here.

01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:08.160
I can do sign language, but whenever I do, I accidentally slash people with my claws.

01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:10.160
You have bad depth perception.

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:13.160
I'm bigger than I think.

01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:15.160
We're here for the drop.

01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:19.160
He just looks at you like he doesn't know what you're saying.

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:22.160
Have you heard of anyone named Patchens before?

01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:23.160
He shakes his head.

01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.160
No.

01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:26.160
You have a gem?

01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:28.160
Are you waiting for a gem?

01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:31.160
He squints his head and he goes, no.

01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:34.160
Are you waiting for a delivery?

01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:41.160
He thinks like he's remembering and then he goes out around back of his house.

01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:45.160
Hey, where are you going?

01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:46.160
I guess we follow him.

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:49.160
Dude, when you said this guy appears, you don't mean like ethereally.

01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:51.160
No, but like, he's a normal guy.

01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:55.160
Like in those scenes where it's like a creepy guy and it's like, oh, he wasn't there.

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.160
Ah, the shadows.

01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:57.160
Yeah.

01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:00.160
Right, exactly.

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:03.160
That's exactly the trope I was trying to hit, yeah.

01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:08.160
Well, let's fucking take this guy.

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:12.160
Did he walk out beckoning us to follow or he just walked out?

01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:14.160
He was being creepy about it, so you couldn't tell.

01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:22.160
Okay, so what's my thing where I conjure up like a light so we can see in the darkness of the pen?

01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:23.160
Dancing lights?

01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:24.160
Sure.

01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:26.160
I just have light.

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:27.160
I can make things a torch.

01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:28.160
Oh, yeah, okay.

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:29.160
So I reach out and pick up a stick.

01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:30.160
Poof, it's a torch.

01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:31.160
It is.

01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:33.160
I examine the corner that he was in.

01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:34.160
The corner he was in?

01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:36.160
Oh, I just threw the whole pen.

01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:37.160
Say that again.

01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:40.160
I examine the pig pen that we discovered.

01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:42.160
So you are following him then?

01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:43.160
Okay.

01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:46.160
Did he get up and leave the pig pen?

01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:49.160
You didn't get quite to the pig pen.

01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:50.160
Oh, okay.

01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:53.160
We thought that we were arriving at the pig pen and meeting him.

01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:54.160
Right.

01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:56.160
Now he was just like, sorry if I was wrong.

01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:57.160
Let's follow him.

01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:58.160
Let's see where this leads.

01:29:58.160 --> 01:29:59.160
Okay.

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:00.160
Follow him.

01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:05.160
He goes around back to the pig pen and he goes and stands in front of the third one.

01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:07.160
And he's just kind of like looking at it.

01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:09.160
Looking in the corner.

01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:11.160
And he goes, phew.

01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:12.160
All right.

01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:15.160
Well, somebody give this guy the Heimlich.

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:16.160
Heimlich?

01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:18.160
You don't hang it up.

01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:21.160
I examine, I use my light and examine the pen.

01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:24.160
All right.

01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:26.160
You do that.

01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:32.160
You find an old muddy sack in the corner of the pen hidden under mud.

01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:34.160
You love those muddy sacks.

01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:38.160
I leap on that sack and I open it up.

01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:39.160
Oh, shit.

01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:40.160
You do it.

01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:41.160
I look inside.

01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:42.160
There's a gem.

01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:43.160
God damn it.

01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:44.160
We did it.

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:45.160
We fucking did it.

01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:47.160
Outrageous.

01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:50.160
We did everything wrong and it led to...

01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:52.160
Outrageous.

01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:53.160
We got it.

01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:55.160
We got Patchen's gem.

01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:57.160
Here's Patchen's.

01:30:57.160 --> 01:31:00.160
Truly outrageous.

01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:01.160
What about this farmer?

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:03.160
Can I maul him for fun?

01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:07.160
Well, as you say that, it seems like while everyone's excited over the gem,

01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:09.160
he's picked up a brick and has started creeping towards you.

01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:10.160
Outrageous.

01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:11.160
Creeping towards us.

01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:13.160
Yeah, with a big brick in his hand.

01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:15.160
I'm telling you, let me maul the guy.

01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:16.160
Ready?

01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:17.160
Okay.

01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:18.160
Country bear.

01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:20.160
Country bear.

01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:32.160
And then I do the bear rape in order to caprio.

01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:39.160
And I leave him for a second and then I come back.

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:43.160
You don't come here for the gem drop off, do you?

01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:48.160
Guys, do we need another monster in our group?

01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:51.160
I mean, like, do we need one?

01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:53.160
There's a guy with a brick.

01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:55.160
I'm feeling unwell all of a sudden.

01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:57.160
I cast Dazzle so we can't see.

01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:59.160
Well, the bear attacks first.

01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:00.160
Hold on.

01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:02.160
I hold on to my Dazzle but I got it.

01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:04.160
It's up here.

01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:06.160
It's ready to go.

01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:12.160
All right, so yeah, the Orson Welles attacks Boink and Hodge

01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:15.160
and you just get him, you smack him in the face

01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:17.160
and then you just bite him right in the chest

01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:19.160
and then you just start ripping him apart

01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:23.160
and he starts hissing and screaming and he's like

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:25.160
and he's screaming and his teeth are sharp

01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:28.160
and it seems like he's a vampire.

01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:32.160
Uh-oh.

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:35.160
You're eating a vampire.

01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:37.160
Is that, I don't know how the rules work.

01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:39.160
Does that make me contagious?

01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:41.160
You also don't know as a bear.

01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:44.160
Should I get a tetanus shot?

01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:47.160
Shit, I'm a cleric. I'm a cleric. God damn it.

01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:49.160
I'm a cleric.

01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:53.160
I think you're out of magic now because you used it on the guy.

01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:58.160
Yeah, but you have to have faith.

01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:00.160
You ever see Fright Night?

01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:02.160
That's fair.

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:05.160
Uh, okay, I'm out of magic.

01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:08.160
I'm out of magic. That's fine.

01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:12.160
I'm sure there's some passive ability to turn vampires.

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:15.160
What's our proximity to each other and to Blankens?

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:17.160
You're within 10 feet of each other.

01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:19.160
I have a question.

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:24.160
When I'm a shambling mound, okay, so I'm like a plant creature.

01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:25.160
Right?

01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:26.160
Right.

01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:28.160
Is there any wood in me?

01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:30.160
Yeah, there's some woodier branches.

01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:31.160
You see where I'm going with this?

01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:32.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:33.160
Okay.

01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:37.160
I go up to him and I do one of these.

01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:39.160
Oh, that's not, I thought.

01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:40.160
What did you think I was going to do?

01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:42.160
Steak in the heart. I thought a steak in the heart.

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:43.160
I didn't know you were going to...

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:47.160
There's no Jesus in this world.

01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:50.160
We thought you were going to sacrifice one of your limbs so that we could steak him through the heart.

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:55.160
What are we going to wait for Christ to be born?

01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:56.160
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:58.160
Okay, I did it wrong.

01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:00.160
So we'll do it your way.

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:02.160
Steak, steak through the heart.

01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:04.160
That's got to be dimensionless.

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:05.160
Do you have a hammer?

01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:06.160
What?

01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:07.160
Do you have a hammer?

01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:09.160
You don't need one. It's your fists.

01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:10.160
Just punch him.

01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:14.160
Okay, I'll punch him with one of my stick fingers in the heart.

01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:16.160
Aim for his heart.

01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:17.160
Aim for his heart, stick finger.

01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:20.160
Bear, you can hammer his elbow if that's...

01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:22.160
All right, okay.

01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:27.160
I honestly think we only need one monster.

01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:30.160
I think that's a little bit turf war-ish.

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:31.160
Yeah, well...

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:32.160
I think there's...

01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:35.160
I'm here first.

01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:41.160
I'm not disputing that, but everybody else is being cool.

01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:44.160
All right, okay, whatever.

01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:46.160
Look, I eat stuff that you guys don't,

01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:49.160
like some of your allies and other creatures.

01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:50.160
Right, right, okay.

01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:53.160
Can I finish what I started here?

01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:56.160
Stick my finger in his heart.

01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:59.160
All right, as he's being mauled by the bear,

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:02.160
he's pretty easy to hit with your steak fingers,

01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:04.160
and you steak him right in the chest.

01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:05.160
Nice.

01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:08.160
And he explodes into dust around its skeleton.

01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:09.160
Yeah.

01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:10.160
Ah!

01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:11.160
You did it!

01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:14.160
Garry Shandling, you did it.

01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:18.160
Aw, I was quite wanted to eat him.

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:22.160
Can I collect some of the dust and put it into my glass jar?

01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:23.160
Yep, I do that.

01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:26.160
That's probably a crafting ingredient.

01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:27.160
You don't know.

01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:28.160
What?

01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:29.160
What?

01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:31.160
It's probably a crafting ingredient.

01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:32.160
It's a keepsake.

01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:35.160
It's a vampire dust.

01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:37.160
What are you shaking your head to me?

01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:39.160
You're made out of swamp leaves.

01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:42.160
Hey, you know, you're made out of meat.

01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:44.160
Okay, is that a threat?

01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:47.160
I just want to collect some vampire dust.

01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:52.160
Nothing says back to school like vampire dust.

01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:53.160
Okay, well...

01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:54.160
Guys, we did it.

01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:55.160
We got Patchen's gem.

01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:56.160
Where's Patchen's?

01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:57.160
Do we know this is Patchen's gem?

01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:58.160
What if it's just another...

01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:01.160
Of course it's Patchen's gem.

01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:02.160
How long since it's been...

01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:05.160
I loot the...

01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:07.160
To Boynkins' clothing.

01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:10.160
You get 17 gold as well as a compass.

01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:14.160
I split it up evenly among the five of us.

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:15.160
You all get three gold.

01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:19.160
All right, we need this gem put somewhere where it will not be waylaid.

01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:21.160
You know, while they're doing that,

01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:23.160
I'm just going to...

01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:25.160
Spencer, while they're doing that,

01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:28.160
I'm just going to kind of wander out alone.

01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:31.160
I just need to be alone for a bit.

01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:32.160
All right.

01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:34.160
Guys, let them go.

01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:35.160
Just let them go.

01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:37.160
How long is the bear going to last?

01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:39.160
That's not a summon bear, I don't think.

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:40.160
I think it's the bear.

01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:43.160
I'm going to split with my share of the gold ASAP.

01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:45.160
Because I keep thinking like the best place to hide a gem is...

01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:46.160
In my ass.

01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:47.160
A bear's ass.

01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:50.160
Like, who's ever going to rob a...

01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:54.160
I walk away from all of this.

01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:56.160
You know, they can argue about all that.

01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.160
And I'm just going to kind of just...

01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:00.160
I'll have you know I do shit in the woods.

01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:02.160
I follow Garry Shandling.

01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:03.160
I follow him.

01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:04.160
Okay.

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:05.160
I don't know if he'd like that.

01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:07.160
Well, I don't expect him to.

01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:08.160
There needs to be a transition.

01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:09.160
Hey, Gary.

01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:11.160
I'm sitting on the road.

01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:12.160
Gary.

01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:15.160
I'm just like kind of like looking at the dirt

01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:18.160
and playing with a rock that I found.

01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:20.160
And I'm just like...

01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:22.160
Yeah, what?

01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:24.160
Killed...

01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:27.160
Couldn't have killed that vampire without you.

01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:28.160
Thank you.

01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:30.160
Yeah, I know.

01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:33.160
Help us get Patchen's gem.

01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:37.160
It's not fun anymore.

01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:38.160
Can you say anymore?

01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:40.160
But this was your first adventure.

01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:41.160
I've been doing this a long time.

01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:43.160
It gets worse than this.

01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:45.160
I just...

01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:46.160
I'm just like...

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:50.160
I didn't let my dog out before I left the place.

01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:52.160
Gary.

01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:54.160
I'm just starting to worry that

01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:56.160
this is as good as it's going to get.

01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:59.160
I mean, I thought it would be more than this.

01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:02.160
And it's just like we're hurting people.

01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:03.160
I don't know.

01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:05.160
Are we the good guys?

01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:07.160
Or the bad guys?

01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:08.160
Sometimes we're the bad guys.

01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:11.160
And it often coincides with us being disunited

01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:13.160
and confused about what we did last week.

01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:16.160
It seems like we're always talking over each other.

01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:19.160
Yeah, well, that's why we need the cure

01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:24.160
to this problem is commitment to a weekly schedule

01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:30.160
and people showing up and listening

01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:32.160
and give and take and all this stuff.

01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:36.160
And I know that it would be better with you, you know?

01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:37.160
And I want to invite you...

01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:38.160
I mean, I'm just like...

01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:40.160
The bear is it, right?

01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:41.160
I mean, we're going to get another...

01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:45.160
This bear is here to plug some fucking improv show he's doing.

01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:47.160
We don't even know.

01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:49.160
This bear is here today.

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:51.160
Mind if I just pop over?

01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:52.160
Hi.

01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:55.160
I'm in the Sunday company at the Groundlings.

01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:58.160
It's my last six months.

01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:01.160
So if you could want to pop by.

01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:06.160
I've got flyers, but they're a little claw shredded.

01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:10.160
Look, I mean...

01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:14.160
Karen Mariamma is my teacher.

01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:18.160
Of course, we're going to come to your show.

01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:22.160
Great, great, great.

01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:23.160
Now, there's a limit.

01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:25.160
I can only get three people.

01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:26.160
Oh, okay.

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:35.160
Well, I thought I saw Adele close over there by the bushes.

01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:39.160
Anyways, Gary, we'd love for you to continue

01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:41.160
to be a part of our gang.

01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:44.160
Okay, but...

01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:52.160
I'm up inside the farmhouse trying to loot the farmhouse.

01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:53.160
All right, all right.

01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:58.160
Well, I could probably hang out for another day or two.

01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:01.160
But if the bear stays, is it a deal breaker?

01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:02.160
No, no, no.

01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:05.160
I was like, I started, you know, like,

01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:09.160
carving out like a niche and then all of a sudden

01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:11.160
like all over...

01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:13.160
I don't know, it's whatever.

01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:15.160
I mean, it's just been rough, you know.

01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:17.160
Like, I'm just really tired.

01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:18.160
I need to...

01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:19.160
I should have...

01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:20.160
I missed...

01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:21.160
It's fine.

01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:22.160
It's fine.

01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:23.160
It's a bunch of shit.

01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:24.160
Don't worry about it.

01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:25.160
Don't worry about it.

01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:27.160
You mind if I offer just to say,

01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:30.160
if I'm passed on at the groundlings,

01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:34.160
I probably will have to go do that anyway.

01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:36.160
So, I mean, for me to continue being here

01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:38.160
and bothering you, I would have to...

01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:41.160
Not pass the Sunday company ground.

01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:43.160
I just, you know, it's my stupid...

01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:45.160
I'm wandering around the front room with my flashlight

01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:47.160
just sort of like checking things out.

01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:50.160
I grabbed Charlotte the most adorable pig

01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:53.160
and I walk over to Gary and I'm like,

01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:55.160
look at how cute this little pig is.

01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:56.160
She loves you.

01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:59.160
That's a sex pig.

01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:11.160
Thank you for coming down here.

01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:15.160
To MacArthur Park in Los Angeles, California.

01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:25.160
Let's give it up for James Ajomean.

01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:29.160
And everybody here is Zach Spencer, Chris, Sarah,

01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:30.160
and Levy of course.

01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:34.160
Steve Levy.

01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:37.160
Brian and Usang and Nolan and everybody here.

01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:38.160
