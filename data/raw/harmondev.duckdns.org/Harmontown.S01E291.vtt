{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:10.880\nWelcome once again to the Double Tree Sweetwater in Extended Stay Hotel here at the Hayward\n\n00:10.880 --> 00:11.880\nTheater.\n\n00:11.880 --> 00:12.880\nNow it's Dynasty Typewriter.\n\n00:12.880 --> 00:25.040\nOnce again, very happy to announce to all y'all that Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:25.040 --> 00:28.320\nSorry for the late start, but let's make it up for it with our Game Master Spencer\n\n00:28.320 --> 00:30.320\nKrippenden.\n\n00:30.320 --> 00:32.320\nOh yeah.\n\n00:32.320 --> 00:34.320\nOh yeah.\n\n00:34.320 --> 00:36.320\nOh yeah.\n\n00:36.320 --> 00:38.320\nOh yeah.\n\n00:38.320 --> 00:40.320\nOh yeah.\n\n00:40.320 --> 00:42.320\nOh yeah.\n\n00:42.320 --> 00:44.320\nOh yeah.\n\n00:44.320 --> 00:46.320\nEverybody say, oh yeah.\n\n00:46.320 --> 00:48.320\nOh yeah.\n\n00:48.320 --> 00:50.320\nOh yeah.\n\n00:50.320 --> 00:52.320\nLet's bring out the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:52.320 --> 00:54.320\nDan Harmon!\n\n00:54.320 --> 01:02.320\nThank you!\n\n01:02.320 --> 01:10.880\nYo, yo, yo, yo, rapping perfunctorily, rapping is perfuntural to me, rapping is just a thing\n\n01:10.880 --> 01:16.320\nyou see when you come out of the top of the show, it's like pee, it comes out of your\n\n01:16.320 --> 01:25.720\ndick, and goes on the floor, and then you rap a lot more, and then you want to rap less,\n\n01:25.720 --> 01:30.880\nyou're a victim of your own rapping gimmick.\n\n01:30.880 --> 01:39.200\nJust look at your phone and try to get through it, no one's forcing you to rap, you know.\n\n01:39.200 --> 01:42.360\nI'm not in charge of this, this is Zach and the booth is running this, I don't have the\n\n01:42.360 --> 01:43.360\nbutton on this.\n\n01:43.360 --> 01:54.120\nI know, I'm not just looking at my notes, listening to my inner monologue, no one's\n\n01:54.120 --> 02:01.040\nforcing you to rap, you don't have to do it.\n\n02:01.040 --> 02:02.680\nI forgot my water, I'll be right back.\n\n02:02.680 --> 02:12.080\nWhat are you afraid of, are you afraid to start the show by just looking at people and\n\n02:12.080 --> 02:26.280\nbeing in the moment, and engaging, yes, my name is MC fear, I don't want to be here,\n\n02:26.280 --> 02:45.400\nthe world's falling apart.\n\n02:45.400 --> 02:50.280\nI should either commit to a rap at the top of the show, or I should just say thank you\n\n02:50.280 --> 02:56.120\nvery much and proceed right now, I don't know what I'm doing, we're just on our third weekend\n\n02:56.120 --> 03:00.720\nback in our honeymoon with the live audience, so I don't know what I'm doing, feeling it\n\n03:00.720 --> 03:03.240\nout, I don't know how to start a show.\n\n03:03.240 --> 03:09.720\nWe're trying to get the audio dialed in for the home listener and everything.\n\n03:09.720 --> 03:13.920\nIf anyone, here's me talking, I think I've mentioned it before, I have a bad thing in\n\n03:13.920 --> 03:18.320\nmy throat, so if I sound weird, that's why.\n\n03:18.320 --> 03:21.480\nYou're going to get a vocal therapy surgery soon.\n\n03:21.480 --> 03:26.280\nI am, I'm going to have a little surgery and take a little polyp off of my vocal fold.\n\n03:26.280 --> 03:31.720\nAnd then I can't talk for two weeks, isn't that going to be exciting for my girlfriend?\n\n03:31.720 --> 03:35.400\nBut don't worry, I already got an app, I'm already working on replacing you.\n\n03:35.400 --> 03:41.120\nSee Dan, as a good friend, I was thinking I'll get a little chalkboard, like Beethoven\n\n03:41.120 --> 03:45.800\nand write things down, and the doctor gave me a little button that I can wear that says\n\n03:45.800 --> 03:52.200\nI'm going through, like what was I saying, like, no talking, I can't talk, I'm going\n\n03:52.200 --> 03:55.760\nthrough like the thing and vocal rest, yes.\n\n03:55.760 --> 04:02.040\nAnd so with Dan, because he's a techno genius, instantly got to work to help his good friend\n\n04:02.040 --> 04:03.040\nout.\n\n04:03.040 --> 04:10.120\nHey everybody, how are you doing tonight?\n\n04:10.120 --> 04:11.120\nYou can put other phrases in there.\n\n04:11.120 --> 04:16.480\nYeah, we're talking about maybe like some fan out there, something that could just make\n\n04:16.480 --> 04:21.000\nme like a big file of MP3s of some of my favorite phrases, and I could just come out here and\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:26.080\njust DJ my own inimical sense of wit and wisdom.\n\n04:26.080 --> 04:29.400\nWe already knew we had to put this one in here.\n\n04:29.400 --> 04:35.320\nIt's 9-Eleven.\n\n04:35.320 --> 04:37.720\nDo I have to be British?\n\n04:37.720 --> 04:41.080\nAnd then of course, my favorite.\n\n04:41.080 --> 04:43.720\nDan, that sounds like you should do a rap.\n\n04:43.720 --> 04:45.960\nI can't really understand him.\n\n04:45.960 --> 04:50.600\nHe said, Dan, that sounds like you should do a rap.\n\n04:50.600 --> 04:52.840\nHow's work life going, Dan?\n\n04:52.840 --> 04:53.840\nThat's good.\n\n04:53.840 --> 04:58.920\nI'm just writing, I'm just trying to get done with this thing, and I just want to kill myself.\n\n04:58.920 --> 05:03.840\nBut it's probably for the best, because it keeps me up on the Twitter for the most part,\n\n05:03.840 --> 05:07.880\nand that's a mess, and I'm having a good time at Rick and Morty, we're back in the writer's\n\n05:07.880 --> 05:11.640\nroom, sorry.\n\n05:11.640 --> 05:14.640\nHow far into the 70 episodes are you so far?\n\n05:14.640 --> 05:23.360\nWe're just brainstorming, you know, like stuff.\n\n05:23.360 --> 05:24.360\nLet's see.\n\n05:24.360 --> 05:26.600\nWell, here's from my notes.\n\n05:26.600 --> 05:30.640\nSo there's this button.\n\n05:30.640 --> 05:32.240\nDid I talk about this last time?\n\n05:32.240 --> 05:34.000\nI don't believe so.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:35.760\nHow do you know?\n\n05:35.760 --> 05:38.880\nOh, because I said there's a button.\n\n05:38.880 --> 05:39.880\nOkay.\n\n05:39.880 --> 05:43.360\nI mean, we talk about buttons all the time.\n\n05:43.360 --> 05:44.360\nHow do you know?\n\n05:44.360 --> 05:48.240\nThere's a crosswalk button, if I mentioned this crosswalk button, when we were working\n\n05:48.240 --> 05:56.280\nat Rick and Morty in the old Burbank offices, and there was this beeping sound that would\n\n05:56.280 --> 06:02.440\nhappen all the time, that I always thought was a frenetic version of, a weirdly arrhythmic\n\n06:02.440 --> 06:13.360\nversion of some kind of hearing impaired or visually impaired, I guess, crosswalk audio.\n\n06:13.360 --> 06:20.120\nSometimes they make old cuckoo sounds, the crosswalks for the folks that can't see the\n\n06:20.120 --> 06:26.400\nwalking people pictograms, and so the light will go like cuckoo, cuckoo, which means,\n\n06:26.400 --> 06:28.720\nI guess, walk.\n\n06:28.720 --> 06:30.720\nThey better tell them that.\n\n06:30.720 --> 06:35.600\nI'm sure there's some, someone must coordinate with them, but I always thought, maybe, there's\n\n06:35.600 --> 06:41.240\nsome version of that because I just hear those beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,\n\n06:41.240 --> 06:44.760\nbeep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.\n\n06:44.760 --> 06:51.400\nJust coming out from this window.\n\n06:51.400 --> 06:54.200\nBeep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.\n\n06:54.200 --> 06:55.360\nOne time I was like, what is that?\n\n06:55.360 --> 06:56.360\nAnd someone was like, that's the crosswalk.\n\n06:56.360 --> 06:58.100\nI was like, okay, that confirms that.\n\n06:58.100 --> 07:00.120\nTheir little months go by.\n\n07:00.120 --> 07:02.880\nNo, the crosswalk, what do you mean it's the crosswalk?\n\n07:02.880 --> 07:06.880\nIt goes crazy and one day I go down there\n\n07:06.880 --> 07:09.560\nand I'm gonna go across the street to the liquor store\n\n07:09.560 --> 07:13.080\nand I hit the button for the crosswalk\n\n07:13.080 --> 07:16.640\nand it goes beep and I go, you gotta be fucking kidding me.\n\n07:16.640 --> 07:19.080\nBeep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.\n\n07:19.080 --> 07:21.320\nLike I'm like, that's what people are doing?\n\n07:21.320 --> 07:22.480\nLike, wow.\n\n07:22.480 --> 07:27.440\nLike, and then sure I go out and look out the window\n\n07:27.440 --> 07:30.440\nand everybody starts like, beep, beep, beep, beep.\n\n07:30.440 --> 07:33.440\nBeep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.\n\n07:34.980 --> 07:37.340\nI have so many questions for this person.\n\n07:37.340 --> 07:39.960\nLike, so do you...\n\n07:39.960 --> 07:44.020\nSo you live in a society where you are fine with the fact\n\n07:44.020 --> 07:46.420\nthat this button really just doesn't work,\n\n07:47.380 --> 07:49.520\nbut you are not quite to the point\n\n07:49.520 --> 07:52.460\nwhere you're gonna be Han Solo and just bound across the street.\n\n07:52.460 --> 07:54.600\nLike because fuck that button.\n\n07:54.600 --> 07:57.260\nLike you're like, well, the button doesn't work\n\n07:57.260 --> 08:00.180\nand that's fucked up, but I'm gonna press it a million times.\n\n08:00.180 --> 08:03.060\nLike, oh, it didn't work again, it didn't work again,\n\n08:03.060 --> 08:03.900\nit didn't work again.\n\n08:03.900 --> 08:07.260\nLike, you think the button's supposed to work instantly?\n\n08:07.260 --> 08:11.940\nOr is it that you think it's like a slot machine kind of game\n\n08:11.940 --> 08:15.180\nwhere there's a window where you snooze, you lose?\n\n08:15.180 --> 08:17.620\nLike, I checked back in with the button\n\n08:17.620 --> 08:19.660\nand you were touching your purse.\n\n08:19.660 --> 08:20.940\nFuck you, lady.\n\n08:20.940 --> 08:24.200\nAnd so you're just like, I don't know when you decide.\n\n08:24.200 --> 08:25.620\nI know someone engineered this thing\n\n08:25.620 --> 08:28.380\nto give me the feedback of, yes, the button's been pushed,\n\n08:28.380 --> 08:30.420\nbecause obviously some engineer for the city\n\n08:30.420 --> 08:32.980\nlike came back and got, guys, I know this is hard to believe,\n\n08:32.980 --> 08:36.700\nbut people are pushing this thing 8,000 times a minute.\n\n08:36.700 --> 08:39.500\nAre you sure it's not kids just making like little EDM,\n\n08:39.500 --> 08:41.580\nlike having fun making music while they wait?\n\n08:41.580 --> 08:44.820\nI work above this thing for years, and I'm telling,\n\n08:44.820 --> 08:48.140\nno, it's every human being that goes to that crosswalk,\n\n08:49.300 --> 08:52.420\njust like old, young, like whatever, like they're just like,\n\n08:52.420 --> 08:55.340\nmaybe, maybe, like, it's like this weird,\n\n08:55.340 --> 08:57.300\nmaybe it's like Jeopardy, like the person across the street\n\n08:57.300 --> 08:58.580\nhit it first and you locked out\n\n08:58.580 --> 09:00.420\nand you got to hit the button a bunch of times.\n\n09:00.420 --> 09:01.260\nYeah.\n\n09:01.260 --> 09:05.260\nThat's it, that's, that's the hardcore game show knowledge.\n\n09:05.260 --> 09:10.260\nIf you hit the Jeopardy buzzer before the little light\n\n09:10.780 --> 09:12.980\ngoes on, it says you can now answer the question.\n\n09:12.980 --> 09:14.060\nThat's why you see people hitting the button\n\n09:14.060 --> 09:16.420\nlike 1,000 times because they don't, they missed it.\n\n09:16.420 --> 09:18.820\nIf I thought that that's how the button worked,\n\n09:18.820 --> 09:21.700\nI would not push it, I would go, I would push it once\n\n09:21.700 --> 09:23.180\nand I would go, well, if it's gonna be like that,\n\n09:23.180 --> 09:24.700\nfuck it, and I'd walk across the street.\n\n09:24.700 --> 09:27.980\nAnd if the cop was like, you're J walking,\n\n09:27.980 --> 09:31.020\nI'd be like, you better prove to me that that button works.\n\n09:31.020 --> 09:33.400\nShow me how it works.\n\n09:33.400 --> 09:35.900\nAnd then they'd be like, and then that would resolve it\n\n09:35.900 --> 09:37.900\nor I get to go across the street anytime I want\n\n09:37.900 --> 09:38.740\nand tell that happens.\n\n09:38.740 --> 09:40.900\nWait, do the siren a few times?\n\n09:40.900 --> 09:45.040\nRrr, rrr, rrr, rrr, rrr.\n\n09:45.040 --> 09:45.880\nThat's just kind of crazy.\n\n09:45.880 --> 09:47.680\nI'm trying to layer some sweet tracks\n\n09:47.680 --> 09:50.580\nso we can have a full song at the end of this show.\n\n09:50.580 --> 09:51.940\nAll right, well that was that thought,\n\n09:51.940 --> 09:54.460\nI guess that kind of shit the bed.\n\n09:54.460 --> 09:56.460\nNo, there's no pressure on you.\n\n09:56.460 --> 09:58.700\nYou don't have to enjoy my thoughts.\n\n09:58.700 --> 10:01.380\nWe were like in Kansas City or St. Louis or somewhere.\n\n10:01.380 --> 10:06.340\nAnd sometimes a gentle voice goes, walk.\n\n10:06.340 --> 10:08.380\nWalk, and then that lets you know.\n\n10:08.380 --> 10:11.460\nBut there's one, he goes, stop.\n\n10:11.460 --> 10:14.700\nIf you hit the button, and it's not time for you to go,\n\n10:14.700 --> 10:16.420\nhe goes, stop.\n\n10:16.420 --> 10:17.980\nThe thing actually yells at you.\n\n10:17.980 --> 10:20.380\nDon't, no, stop.\n\n10:20.380 --> 10:21.940\nBut I mean, don't try to walk.\n\n10:21.940 --> 10:23.100\nNo, I think they're telling you don't.\n\n10:23.100 --> 10:24.580\nWell, yeah, they're telling you don't walk.\n\n10:24.580 --> 10:25.860\nYeah, but I think it doubles as.\n\n10:25.860 --> 10:26.820\nDon't start walking.\n\n10:26.820 --> 10:29.500\nAlso, stop fucking pushing the button.\n\n10:29.500 --> 10:30.420\nOh, well, I don't.\n\n10:30.420 --> 10:32.540\nOh, you're saying they should add that.\n\n10:32.540 --> 10:33.740\nThey should go, yeah.\n\n10:33.740 --> 10:38.340\nThey should add a sound that says, hey, the button's been pushed.\n\n10:38.340 --> 10:41.820\nYou're good until an entire cycle of getting what you want\n\n10:41.820 --> 10:43.460\neither happens or doesn't happen.\n\n10:43.460 --> 10:49.380\nYou definitely only have, think of it like an elevator.\n\n10:49.380 --> 10:50.660\nAn elevator.\n\n10:50.660 --> 10:51.820\nI'm like a six-year-old kid.\n\n10:51.820 --> 10:54.900\nThink about it like spaghetti.\n\n10:54.900 --> 10:56.460\nBiscuity.\n\n10:56.460 --> 10:57.900\nTo think about it like an elevator,\n\n10:57.900 --> 10:59.260\nI was going to say you fucking moron,\n\n10:59.260 --> 11:01.660\nand then I found out I can't say the word elevator.\n\n11:01.660 --> 11:04.060\nYou've got 11 people waiting to cross the road,\n\n11:04.060 --> 11:05.740\nand everyone's just standing there, chilling out.\n\n11:05.740 --> 11:08.260\nEveryone's looking at their phones, and you're, stop.\n\n11:08.260 --> 11:11.300\nEverybody looks up, either because you're being told\n\n11:11.300 --> 11:14.420\nto stop what you're doing, or someone trying to cross the street,\n\n11:14.420 --> 11:15.820\nthey're going to get hit by a bus.\n\n11:15.820 --> 11:18.020\nIt's really alarming.\n\n11:18.020 --> 11:20.060\nYou've got those new buses that are silent.\n\n11:20.060 --> 11:22.100\nThere's like those completely electric silent buses.\n\n11:22.100 --> 11:25.500\nThey're just, they're going to kill everybody.\n\n11:25.500 --> 11:28.300\nThe whole point of a bus is that you can hear it coming.\n\n11:28.300 --> 11:31.860\nThat's the whole point of a bus.\n\n11:31.860 --> 11:32.360\nYeah.\n\n11:40.300 --> 11:42.460\nThe fact that somebody was smart enough to say,\n\n11:42.460 --> 11:53.980\nlet's put some seats in this and make some money.\n\n11:53.980 --> 11:59.140\nYou know, people ask me, Dan, you're kind of a social media\n\n11:59.140 --> 12:05.380\nmaster, like I'm looking to spread my influence,\n\n12:05.380 --> 12:09.900\nboost my signal, like, how do I get more followers?\n\n12:09.900 --> 12:12.660\nI want to be able to use these social medias\n\n12:12.660 --> 12:16.420\nto make a difference in the world.\n\n12:16.420 --> 12:21.020\nAnd I don't have the reach that you or Joel McHale have.\n\n12:21.020 --> 12:27.260\nI didn't accidentally get born right around the time that\n\n12:27.260 --> 12:29.300\nwould make me 30 when Twitter was invented.\n\n12:29.300 --> 12:33.140\nSo now I got a fucked up username that's 20 numbers long,\n\n12:33.140 --> 12:36.180\nand I got two followers, and I don't know what to do.\n\n12:36.180 --> 12:39.180\nAnd I say, look, here's what you do.\n\n12:39.180 --> 12:45.500\nYou just go onto Twitter, and you look for the things that\n\n12:45.500 --> 12:48.700\nare getting retweeted by the thousands.\n\n12:48.700 --> 12:50.100\nOh, that got a lot of retweets.\n\n12:50.100 --> 12:50.500\nLook at that.\n\n12:50.500 --> 12:52.300\nPeople really liked reading that, and then they clicked\n\n12:52.300 --> 12:53.580\nretweet after they saw that.\n\n12:53.580 --> 12:56.860\nAnd then you click Reply to those, and then you just\n\n12:56.860 --> 13:01.980\nargue with another person who has two followers.\n\n13:01.980 --> 13:05.820\nIf you do that for eight years, I promise you\n\n13:05.820 --> 13:10.260\nthat you will gain five followers, because you're\n\n13:10.260 --> 13:15.140\nperforming for an audience of two, and you're a fucking idiot.\n\n13:15.140 --> 13:17.340\nAnyways, I don't understand.\n\n13:17.340 --> 13:21.020\nIt's like somebody will go, hey, I don't understand.\n\n13:21.020 --> 13:22.620\nWhy are they taking babies?\n\n13:22.620 --> 13:23.460\nThat seems bad.\n\n13:23.460 --> 13:25.180\nAnd then it's like 10,000 retweets.\n\n13:25.180 --> 13:27.500\nYou know what, that person's job is kind of done.\n\n13:27.500 --> 13:29.420\nThey're not really a dragon for you to slay.\n\n13:29.420 --> 13:32.740\nAnd then you just look at the responses, and people are like,\n\n13:32.740 --> 13:35.460\nyeah, but what do you think about the ramifications of that?\n\n13:35.460 --> 13:38.460\nWhy don't you just fucking tweet it on your own thing?\n\n13:38.460 --> 13:42.180\nBecause then eight people, who do you think is reading this?\n\n13:42.180 --> 13:42.820\nWeirdo?\n\n13:42.820 --> 13:44.060\nWhy are you arguing?\n\n13:44.060 --> 13:46.820\nWhat are you climbing this person's wall and going like,\n\n13:46.820 --> 13:50.060\nyeah, I have a thing to say about that.\n\n13:50.060 --> 13:52.540\nJust seems kind of weird.\n\n13:52.540 --> 13:55.860\nYou always look at the number of retweets and likes that's\n\n13:55.860 --> 13:56.360\nthere.\n\n13:56.360 --> 14:11.860\nYeah.\n\n14:11.860 --> 14:13.420\nEventually I would bring you out.\n\n14:17.420 --> 14:20.420\nGet used to it.\n\n14:20.420 --> 14:21.420\nGet used to it.\n\n14:21.420 --> 14:22.920\nGet used to it.\n\n14:22.920 --> 14:26.420\nNo, he's blowing it up.\n\n14:26.420 --> 14:28.420\nGet used to it.\n\n14:28.420 --> 14:30.420\nGet used to it.\n\n14:30.420 --> 14:34.420\nGet used to it.\n\n14:34.420 --> 14:36.420\nIt gets worse.\n\n14:36.420 --> 14:40.420\nThe closer you get, it gets worse.\n\n14:40.420 --> 14:42.420\nThe closer you are.\n\n14:42.420 --> 14:44.420\nWorse.\n\n14:44.420 --> 14:46.420\nThe closer you get, it gets worse.\n\n14:46.420 --> 14:48.420\nGrab shot, everyone.\n\n14:48.420 --> 14:49.420\nThe closer you are.\n\n14:49.420 --> 15:01.420\nHe's rolling a chair.\n\n15:01.420 --> 15:06.420\nHe's moving the stage.\n\n15:06.420 --> 15:09.920\nThe court is tangled in a chair.\n\n15:09.920 --> 15:13.920\nHe threw the chair.\n\n15:13.920 --> 15:16.920\nHe's sitting down.\n\n15:16.920 --> 15:20.920\nIt's such a good show last week.\n\n15:20.920 --> 15:22.920\nFeel the lens?\n\n15:22.920 --> 15:24.920\nThat show was great.\n\n15:24.920 --> 15:26.920\nYou were talking to Judd Apatow.\n\n15:26.920 --> 15:29.920\nYeah, nobody was playing.\n\n15:29.920 --> 15:30.920\nHello, Dan.\n\n15:30.920 --> 15:32.920\nChair games.\n\n15:32.920 --> 15:36.920\nI haven't seen you in a while now.\n\n15:36.920 --> 15:38.920\nYeah, I, you know.\n\n15:38.920 --> 15:40.920\nYou're looking good.\n\n15:40.920 --> 15:42.920\nSo that's going to feed back, right?\n\n15:42.920 --> 15:45.920\nIf I bring the microphone over here, isn't that?\n\n15:45.920 --> 15:47.920\nJust don't point the mic at the thing.\n\n15:47.920 --> 15:49.920\nLike this.\n\n15:49.920 --> 15:51.920\nDon't shout.\n\n15:51.920 --> 15:53.920\nI won't.\n\n15:53.920 --> 15:55.920\nThank you for not.\n\n15:55.920 --> 15:57.920\nYou got some kinks to work out.\n\n15:57.920 --> 16:03.920\nThat was a great thing to happen after you said we have some kinks to work out.\n\n16:03.920 --> 16:05.920\nOh, boy.\n\n16:05.920 --> 16:11.920\nYou know, seven ups really got to start bringing their A game.\n\n16:11.920 --> 16:20.920\nI think, I mean, I think Sprite is winning this white soda war.\n\n16:20.920 --> 16:23.920\nI mean, remember, remember the unculled?\n\n16:23.920 --> 16:27.920\nThey used to own the fucking airwaves, man.\n\n16:27.920 --> 16:29.920\nNow I go into a restaurant.\n\n16:29.920 --> 16:31.920\nYou know, I said like seven up.\n\n16:31.920 --> 16:33.920\nThey say Sprite okay.\n\n16:33.920 --> 16:37.920\nI mean, like, when's the last time you had seven up?\n\n16:37.920 --> 16:38.920\nI mean, be serious.\n\n16:38.920 --> 16:47.920\nThat's the last time anybody had seven up at a place of business.\n\n16:47.920 --> 16:53.920\nYou know, they really, I mean, they just, they backed off.\n\n16:53.920 --> 16:54.920\nIt's tortoise in the hair.\n\n16:54.920 --> 16:57.920\nYou know, they were just like, what are they going to do?\n\n16:57.920 --> 16:59.920\nOkay, slice.\n\n16:59.920 --> 17:01.920\nAll right.\n\n17:01.920 --> 17:02.920\nYeah.\n\n17:02.920 --> 17:04.920\nYou're going to try to take us down.\n\n17:04.920 --> 17:07.920\nYou're going to try to take down the uncooler.\n\n17:07.920 --> 17:10.920\nWe got the red dot with the sunglasses, man.\n\n17:10.920 --> 17:12.920\nYou're going to try to take us.\n\n17:12.920 --> 17:13.920\nOkay, fine.\n\n17:13.920 --> 17:14.920\nWhatever.\n\n17:14.920 --> 17:17.920\nAnd they're hanging out and Sprite just is like slow and steady.\n\n17:17.920 --> 17:19.920\nWait, when's the race, man?\n\n17:19.920 --> 17:21.920\nAnd they fucking, they took it over.\n\n17:21.920 --> 17:23.920\nThey took it over.\n\n17:23.920 --> 17:25.920\nIt's gone.\n\n17:25.920 --> 17:27.920\nIt's all over with, man.\n\n17:27.920 --> 17:28.920\nWhat are they doing?\n\n17:28.920 --> 17:31.920\nWhat are you fucking doing, seven up?\n\n17:31.920 --> 17:32.920\nGet in the game.\n\n17:32.920 --> 17:35.920\nFucking start ideas.\n\n17:35.920 --> 17:37.920\nGive me ideas, seven up.\n\n17:37.920 --> 17:40.920\nWhat happened to your campaign?\n\n17:40.920 --> 17:41.920\nWhat?\n\n17:41.920 --> 17:46.920\nI mean, Jesus fucking Christ.\n\n17:46.920 --> 17:47.920\nDon't you care?\n\n17:47.920 --> 17:49.920\nI mean, like really?\n\n17:49.920 --> 17:53.920\nI mean, God, damn it.\n\n17:53.920 --> 17:58.920\nI'm not, I'm not alone here with this.\n\n17:58.920 --> 17:59.920\nRight?\n\n17:59.920 --> 18:02.920\nCause I used to be a big bubble up guy.\n\n18:02.920 --> 18:03.920\nSee?\n\n18:03.920 --> 18:04.920\nYeah.\n\n18:04.920 --> 18:05.920\nWhere are they?\n\n18:05.920 --> 18:06.920\nYou don't hear them anymore.\n\n18:06.920 --> 18:13.920\nSeven up is going bubble up pretty soon, man.\n\n18:13.920 --> 18:16.920\nIs that the name of a, also a Sprite alternative bubble up?\n\n18:16.920 --> 18:19.920\nYeah, from like the 1940s, 1948, I think.\n\n18:19.920 --> 18:22.920\nThere's a song, there's a song with bubble up in it.\n\n18:22.920 --> 18:25.920\nRainbow stew and a silver spoon.\n\n18:25.920 --> 18:27.920\nThink what you're saying is seven up used to be,\n\n18:27.920 --> 18:29.920\nused to own the market because there were these.\n\n18:29.920 --> 18:31.920\nThey used to be the Coca Cola.\n\n18:31.920 --> 18:33.920\nThe uncola alternative.\n\n18:33.920 --> 18:34.920\nRight.\n\n18:34.920 --> 18:35.920\nThe uncola.\n\n18:35.920 --> 18:36.920\nThe uncola.\n\n18:36.920 --> 18:37.920\nCrisp and clean.\n\n18:37.920 --> 18:38.920\nNo caffeine.\n\n18:38.920 --> 18:39.920\nRight?\n\n18:39.920 --> 18:40.920\nYeah.\n\n18:40.920 --> 18:43.920\nThey had the steel vagina guy in the fucking commercial.\n\n18:43.920 --> 18:44.920\nSteel vagina.\n\n18:44.920 --> 18:45.920\nThey had him locked.\n\n18:45.920 --> 18:46.920\nYep.\n\n18:46.920 --> 18:48.920\nIt's like Jim Henson.\n\n18:48.920 --> 18:51.920\nHe dies and now the company's done.\n\n18:51.920 --> 18:55.920\nYeah, there must have been some Steve Jobs of seven up.\n\n18:55.920 --> 18:59.920\nI think they didn't Sprite get bought by Coca Cola.\n\n18:59.920 --> 19:00.920\nI don't know.\n\n19:00.920 --> 19:01.920\nI don't know.\n\n19:01.920 --> 19:03.920\nIt seems, I don't know.\n\n19:03.920 --> 19:09.920\nI mean, I just, you know, I mean, like you kids know about seven up, right?\n\n19:09.920 --> 19:10.920\nAnyone?\n\n19:10.920 --> 19:11.920\nI mean, I don't know.\n\n19:11.920 --> 19:14.920\nIt could be something, something people don't know about.\n\n19:14.920 --> 19:16.920\nWell, our first guest.\n\n19:16.920 --> 19:17.920\nWhat about you, Spencer?\n\n19:17.920 --> 19:22.920\nI'm not finished.\n\n19:22.920 --> 19:24.920\nSpencer, what is your opinion?\n\n19:24.920 --> 19:25.920\nOh.\n\n19:25.920 --> 19:30.920\nWhy do you have drawers in front of your desk?\n\n19:30.920 --> 19:37.920\nI have to get a pencil.\n\n19:37.920 --> 19:45.920\nI should have probably got a piece of paper first.\n\n19:45.920 --> 19:50.920\nWhat's on the other side?\n\n19:50.920 --> 19:53.920\nNo, what's on, what's.\n\n19:53.920 --> 20:06.920\nYes.\n\n20:06.920 --> 20:12.920\nI want this to be like an advent calendar every show we open up a new thing.\n\n20:12.920 --> 20:16.920\nSo everybody listening, you know, just like, not that I care about the free listeners.\n\n20:16.920 --> 20:22.920\nI mean, like, I like the subscribers more, but even they sometimes listen to audio only.\n\n20:22.920 --> 20:27.920\nAnd I'm saying, like, it's, you know, last week, fucking Apatow killed it.\n\n20:27.920 --> 20:28.920\nLike, great.\n\n20:28.920 --> 20:31.920\nI haven't listened to it.\n\n20:31.920 --> 20:36.920\nHow unattractive is the actual desk side?\n\n20:36.920 --> 20:38.920\nThat is the desk side.\n\n20:38.920 --> 20:41.920\nI got to tell you, it's not great back here.\n\n20:41.920 --> 20:45.920\nThis is the side you want to be looking at.\n\n20:45.920 --> 20:48.920\nIt's all just shitty, like raw plywood in the back.\n\n20:48.920 --> 20:52.920\nYeah, it's designed to go up against the wall.\n\n20:52.920 --> 20:57.920\nIt's not like a command desk.\n\n20:57.920 --> 20:58.920\nAre you okay?\n\n20:58.920 --> 21:01.920\nBy the way, like your Instagrams are starting to look photoshopped.\n\n21:01.920 --> 21:06.920\nOh, yeah, people were saying that it was that's, you know, that was those my space angles.\n\n21:06.920 --> 21:10.920\nIt turns out, you know, you can take pictures from flattering angles.\n\n21:10.920 --> 21:13.920\nHoly shit.\n\n21:13.920 --> 21:15.920\nYou look like a goddamn pirate.\n\n21:15.920 --> 21:17.920\nI know it's amazing.\n\n21:17.920 --> 21:19.920\nI was upset.\n\n21:19.920 --> 21:21.920\nI mean, happy.\n\n21:21.920 --> 21:23.920\nYou look, you look hot.\n\n21:23.920 --> 21:24.920\nYou look hot in it.\n\n21:24.920 --> 21:25.920\nI'm getting there.\n\n21:25.920 --> 21:27.920\nYeah.\n\n21:27.920 --> 21:29.920\nLet's bring out an old friend of the show.\n\n21:29.920 --> 21:30.920\nSo Boston's coming up.\n\n21:30.920 --> 21:32.920\nWe got that show.\n\n21:32.920

balloon.\n\n21:39.920 --> 21:41.920\nWith a fucking balloon.\n\n21:41.920 --> 21:44.920\nYou didn't have to.\n\n21:44.920 --> 21:48.920\nI have to wait 15 minutes before you could bring me out.\n\n21:48.920 --> 21:52.920\nLike a fucking, what the heck am I peddling or something like that?\n\n21:52.920 --> 21:53.920\nI can't come out.\n\n21:53.920 --> 21:55.920\nI'm a second class citizen.\n\n21:55.920 --> 21:57.920\nI'm not rolling here.\n\n21:57.920 --> 22:00.920\nI guess we'll bring Rob out.\n\n22:00.920 --> 22:03.920\nI have no idea if you're ever going to bring me out there.\n\n22:03.920 --> 22:05.920\nI have to come in.\n\n22:05.920 --> 22:07.920\nWait, you have, you have no idea?\n\n22:07.920 --> 22:08.920\nHow would you?\n\n22:08.920 --> 22:09.920\nNo idea.\n\n22:09.920 --> 22:10.920\nYou have no idea.\n\n22:10.920 --> 22:11.920\nI have no idea.\n\n22:11.920 --> 22:12.920\nThat's fair.\n\n22:12.920 --> 22:13.920\nOkay.\n\n22:13.920 --> 22:16.920\nI have no idea if I'm ever going to...\n\n22:16.920 --> 22:18.920\nJames Adomian everybody.\n\n22:18.920 --> 22:20.920\nJames Adomian.\n\n22:20.920 --> 22:22.920\nLet's bring James Adomian out.\n\n22:22.920 --> 22:24.920\nOh, yeah.\n\n22:34.920 --> 22:36.920\nI was the first guest, right?\n\n22:36.920 --> 22:37.920\nYes.\n\n22:37.920 --> 22:40.920\nI was hoping I didn't just accidentally steal someone's spot.\n\n22:40.920 --> 22:41.920\nNo.\n\n22:41.920 --> 22:43.920\nI mean, don't even...\n\n22:43.920 --> 22:44.920\nI'm not a guest.\n\n22:44.920 --> 22:49.920\nI'm a fucking part of the show that comes out later when we get to it.\n\n22:49.920 --> 22:52.920\nHe's a phenomenon.\n\n22:52.920 --> 22:55.920\nYou could tell you could even hear me trying to...\n\n22:55.920 --> 22:57.920\nI was trying to get you out here.\n\n22:57.920 --> 22:58.920\nOh, yeah.\n\n22:58.920 --> 22:59.920\nNo, I was...\n\n22:59.920 --> 23:00.920\nI'm fine.\n\n23:00.920 --> 23:01.920\nThis guy's a friend of the show.\n\n23:01.920 --> 23:02.920\nThere's drinks back there.\n\n23:02.920 --> 23:04.920\nI've known you since you were 19 years old.\n\n23:04.920 --> 23:07.920\nI'm a friend of the show.\n\n23:07.920 --> 23:10.920\nI love that shows have friends.\n\n23:10.920 --> 23:13.920\nA friend of the show takes a friend out to the lake\n\n23:13.920 --> 23:15.920\nand talks serious stuff.\n\n23:15.920 --> 23:16.920\nYeah.\n\n23:16.920 --> 23:19.920\nMaybe that friend sometimes used to go all the way out on the lake\n\n23:19.920 --> 23:23.920\nand then there's a single gunshot.\n\n23:23.920 --> 23:25.920\nHe was a friend of the show.\n\n23:25.920 --> 23:26.920\nLet's keep it at that.\n\n23:26.920 --> 23:31.920\nI know it was you, Kumail.\n\n23:31.920 --> 23:32.920\nHe'll be back.\n\n23:32.920 --> 23:33.920\nHe'll be back.\n\n23:33.920 --> 23:34.920\nWe did not kill him.\n\n23:34.920 --> 23:36.920\nNo, we won't.\n\n23:36.920 --> 23:37.920\nYeah.\n\n23:37.920 --> 23:39.920\nHow are you, James Adomian?\n\n23:39.920 --> 23:40.920\nI'm great.\n\n23:40.920 --> 23:41.920\nI'm fantastic.\n\n23:41.920 --> 23:46.920\nAll my projects have been canceled so I have nothing to plug.\n\n23:46.920 --> 23:47.920\nI'm free.\n\n23:47.920 --> 23:48.920\nI'm liberated.\n\n23:48.920 --> 23:49.920\nThank you.\n\n23:49.920 --> 23:50.920\nHe knows Gorka.\n\n23:50.920 --> 23:51.920\nI was actually watching.\n\n23:51.920 --> 23:54.920\nSometimes I'll always get like Harmontown highlights\n\n23:54.920 --> 23:57.920\nsuggested in the YouTube margins.\n\n23:57.920 --> 23:58.920\nWait.\n\n23:58.920 --> 24:00.920\nYou get yourself marketed to you?\n\n24:00.920 --> 24:01.920\nYeah.\n\n24:01.920 --> 24:02.920\nAnd I swear, I don't know.\n\n24:02.920 --> 24:06.920\nI mean, I don't know what the algorithm is because I hate myself.\n\n24:06.920 --> 24:07.920\nThat's probably it.\n\n24:07.920 --> 24:12.920\nI don't know why I click on shit that says I'm an asshole or something.\n\n24:12.920 --> 24:17.920\nThat's like the emperor and Star Wars jolting himself with his powers.\n\n24:17.920 --> 24:20.920\nBut it's actually a really nice thing because it's been almost 300 episodes\n\n24:20.920 --> 24:22.920\nand you're self-loathing.\n\n24:22.920 --> 24:24.920\nYou tend to just go, oh, everything's always been shit.\n\n24:24.920 --> 24:27.920\nAnd then there's people out there that'll pull like little clips\n\n24:27.920 --> 24:29.920\nand they'll go, this is an amazing moment.\n\n24:29.920 --> 24:30.920\nAnd they'll give it a nice title.\n\n24:30.920 --> 24:34.920\nAnd you go, yes, I will click on the first time James Adomian did Bernie Sanders\n\n24:34.920 --> 24:35.920\ncoming out of the show.\n\n24:35.920 --> 24:36.920\nAnd it was here.\n\n24:36.920 --> 24:37.920\nYou debuted.\n\n24:37.920 --> 24:39.920\nYou debuted your Sanders impression.\n\n24:39.920 --> 24:41.920\nBernie Sanders debuted on Harmontown.\n\n24:41.920 --> 24:42.920\nWhat?\n\n24:42.920 --> 24:44.920\nAt the meltdown.\n\n24:44.920 --> 24:45.920\nAnd he was.\n\n24:45.920 --> 24:47.920\nI like just that as a pull quote.\n\n24:47.920 --> 24:51.920\nBernie Sanders debuted on Harmontown.\n\n24:51.920 --> 24:56.920\nAnd the political scene, the mess, the stage that became coded in blood\n\n24:56.920 --> 24:59.920\nwas so clean back then that you could see me not knowing.\n\n24:59.920 --> 25:02.920\nI had asked DeMorge Brown, who's Bernie Sanders?\n\n25:02.920 --> 25:06.920\nAnd he said, oh, it's that black guy that is Ben Carson.\n\n25:06.920 --> 25:07.920\nAnd I was like, oh, it's Ben Carson.\n\n25:07.920 --> 25:09.920\nSo I'm introducing what I think is Ben Carson.\n\n25:09.920 --> 25:11.920\nI don't know either of their names.\n\n25:11.920 --> 25:13.920\nAnd then you come out in these wigs.\n\n25:13.920 --> 25:16.920\nYes, there were two wigs on the side of my head at the time.\n\n25:16.920 --> 25:21.920\nThese two really awful wigs, like Bobby pinned together both on backwards.\n\n25:21.920 --> 25:22.920\nIt was very good.\n\n25:22.920 --> 25:25.920\nYeah, yeah, that's how you, that's DIY.\n\n25:25.920 --> 25:27.920\nWhat was the ride like?\n\n25:27.920 --> 25:32.920\nYou had a homespun version of like, I know always like, like, oh, there'll always be that feature\n\n25:32.920 --> 25:36.920\nand variety or something about like, oh, this guy got cast on SNL.\n\n25:36.920 --> 25:42.920\nAnd who little did he know that Gary Hart would become such a thing because that was one of his impressions.\n\n25:42.920 --> 25:51.920\nBut you just did it like the weekend style, like mixtape style, like turned platinum artist.\n\n25:51.920 --> 25:57.920\nLike your Bernie Sanders became like a cottage industry that you controlled.\n\n25:57.920 --> 25:58.920\nYes.\n\n25:58.920 --> 26:08.920\nAnd look, as all industries, I believe that the Bernie Sanders industry should be strictly regulated.\n\n26:08.920 --> 26:18.920\nThere should be no monopolies and the workers should take control of the impression itself.\n\n26:18.920 --> 26:23.920\nAre there any little tidbits or are you tired of talking about it?\n\n26:23.920 --> 26:31.920\nLike the ride of like, holy shit, you started, you got in the ground floor of this impression of this guy\n\n26:31.920 --> 26:37.920\nthat has become like the Tony Stark of this Marvel movie that's lasting four years.\n\n26:37.920 --> 26:39.920\nIt changed rapidly week to week.\n\n26:39.920 --> 26:46.920\nWhen I started doing it, I knew and loved Bernie Sanders, but I thought I was doing an impression of someone who was doomed.\n\n26:46.920 --> 26:48.920\nDennis Kucinich.\n\n26:48.920 --> 26:51.920\nSo my angle was, well, I don't have a chance.\n\n26:51.920 --> 26:59.920\nWithin a week, there were these 30,000 people crowds and I was like, that's not the angle anymore.\n\n26:59.920 --> 27:02.920\nWhen I first started doing it, it was like, this is the biggest crowd I've seen.\n\n27:02.920 --> 27:03.920\nHa, ha, ha, big laugh.\n\n27:03.920 --> 27:07.920\nBut after a while, it was like, I can't believe I'm playing a room this small.\n\n27:07.920 --> 27:11.920\nWhich must parallel his journey, I assume, if you were up here.\n\n27:11.920 --> 27:17.920\nYeah, I think he definitely started in a Volvo somewhere.\n\n27:17.920 --> 27:23.920\nWhenever I see a good Volvo or an old Studebaker on the road, I'm like, that's Bernie Sanders' car.\n\n27:23.920 --> 27:30.920\nBut was there any moment that really like, where just the absurdity reached a height for you where,\n\n27:30.920 --> 27:35.920\nbecause the political fervor of all of this and the fact that you're out there doing a guy,\n\n27:35.920 --> 27:41.920\nwas there anybody like, I don't know what I'm expecting to hear, someone yelling, hey, James,\n\n27:41.920 --> 27:45.920\nand then throwing paint on you and going like, stop making fun of him, you're part of the problem,\n\n27:45.920 --> 27:47.920\nor the opposite?\n\n27:47.920 --> 27:55.920\nThere was a couple of broken brains that thought that making fun of Bernie Sanders is not allowed,\n\n27:55.920 --> 27:58.920\nbecause he's perfect, and I'm like, no, I like him.\n\n27:58.920 --> 28:02.920\nI'm a second Bernie Sanders.\n\n28:02.920 --> 28:08.920\nI'm trying to say the same things and get the message amplified, and also work in some more radical things,\n\n28:08.920 --> 28:12.920\nlike I got to call for the legalization of psilocybin mushrooms, which he wouldn't do,\n\n28:12.920 --> 28:14.920\nbut I was like, I'm going to do it.\n\n28:14.920 --> 28:20.920\nBecause I read a piece in New Yorker that said that your impression of him might have cost him two and a half points in the primary.\n\n28:20.920 --> 28:21.920\nThank you.\n\n28:21.920 --> 28:27.920\nWas that an article, or was that like a two-person New Yorker cartoon?\n\n28:27.920 --> 28:33.920\nWhere there was like an ill-shapen therapist talking to a desk with drawers in the front.\n\n28:33.920 --> 28:37.920\nAnd it was actually, it was my winning caption. That wasn't even one that had.\n\n28:37.920 --> 28:39.920\nIt was a contest.\n\n28:39.920 --> 28:46.920\nBut sometimes people thought from our advertising that it was really going to be a Trump vs. Bernie debate\n\n28:46.920 --> 28:53.920\nwhen we were on the road, me and Anthony and Tamanick, and in Boston, there was a big sign on the front door that was like,\n\n28:53.920 --> 28:58.920\nDonald Trump at Bernie Sanders will not be at the show tonight. These are comedians.\n\n28:58.920 --> 28:59.920\nJesus.\n\n28:59.920 --> 29:02.920\nBecause they had been getting calls, apparently.\n\n29:02.920 --> 29:06.920\nSpeaking of, yeah, his, Anthony's Trump impression, fantastic.\n\n29:06.920 --> 29:13.920\nAnd was like, but everybody's like, I mean, that's a guy that's like, everybody's got a Trump impression.\n\n29:13.920 --> 29:14.920\nWho is a Trump impression?\n\n29:14.920 --> 29:16.920\nHave you dabbled?\n\n29:16.920 --> 29:22.920\nYou know, on the road, I do a Trump impression because I feel like I have to.\n\n29:22.920 --> 29:26.920\nBecause I went to, I was in Europe, and I'm like, the American who does impressions.\n\n29:26.920 --> 29:30.920\nAnd if, like, if you don't do a Trump impression, there's like, you failed, mate.\n\n29:30.920 --> 29:37.920\nIt seems like kind of a hard impression. Like, there's a surface that's just like, beige, like George Bush gandam.\n\n29:37.920 --> 29:41.920\nLike, you just kind of like that, like the Trump version of that would be like, I'm Donald Trump.\n\n29:41.920 --> 29:43.920\nI don't know. I tried it.\n\n29:43.920 --> 29:45.920\nThat's it. There's a stuntedness to the vote.\n\n29:45.920 --> 29:50.920\nBut he has like a tool, he has like a, like a weird jagged toolbox of like,\n\n29:50.920 --> 29:52.920\nAnthony Atamanic is my favorite.\n\n29:52.920 --> 29:54.920\nHe has the, he does the breathy thing.\n\n29:54.920 --> 29:56.920\nYou know, where it's just, I mean, come on.\n\n29:59.920 --> 30:03.920\nI mostly just ape his impression and give him credit one fourth of the time.\n\n30:03.920 --> 30:08.920\nBut, but there's, there's something I love that Donald Trump speaks.\n\n30:08.920 --> 30:13.920\nLike, he hates people from other cultures and places and races,\n\n30:13.920 --> 30:17.920\nbut he speaks English in a way that would be useful.\n\n30:17.920 --> 30:20.920\nIf you were learning English for the first time,\n\n30:20.920 --> 30:26.920\nor if you're teaching it to someone, because he uses very simple sentences and easy words.\n\n30:26.920 --> 30:29.920\nHe's like, we used to be bad. We were so bad.\n\n30:29.920 --> 30:31.920\nIn the past, we used to be bad.\n\n30:31.920 --> 30:35.920\nNow, here in the present, we're getting better.\n\n30:35.920 --> 30:37.920\nWe're so much getting better.\n\n30:37.920 --> 30:39.920\nAnd in the future, we're going to be great.\n\n30:39.920 --> 30:43.920\nWe're going to be great. That's all three possibilities.\n\n30:43.920 --> 30:46.920\nHe's conjugating words.\n\n30:46.920 --> 30:48.920\nIt sounds like a George Carlin set too.\n\n30:48.920 --> 30:51.920\nLike, like, like Rick Moran, this is an impression of George Carlin.\n\n30:51.920 --> 30:53.920\nIt's like, beats, beats, beats.\n\n30:53.920 --> 30:54.920\nYou want beats?\n\n30:54.920 --> 30:55.920\nAm I on the plane?\n\n30:55.920 --> 30:57.920\nWhy are you, are you on the plane?\n\n30:57.920 --> 30:59.920\nI'm not on the plane. I'm, the plane is grounded.\n\n30:59.920 --> 31:01.920\nIt's a low energy plane.\n\n31:02.920 --> 31:04.920\nYou got more, you want more stuff.\n\n31:04.920 --> 31:07.920\nYou're going to have stuff to put your stuff in.\n\n31:07.920 --> 31:09.920\nWell, now you got to have stuff and put, I'm trying to do George,\n\n31:09.920 --> 31:13.920\nGeorge Carlin's materialist, Donald Trump, in case that's not clear.\n\n31:13.920 --> 31:15.920\nThat's what I was trying to do too, with you on the plane.\n\n31:15.920 --> 31:16.920\nNo, you did it.\n\n31:16.920 --> 31:19.920\nAnd then I tried to come in and join the party and I killed it.\n\n31:21.920 --> 31:24.920\nYou have owners. You think you're free? You have owners.\n\n31:24.920 --> 31:27.920\nI mean, come on. I'm your owner.\n\n31:27.920 --> 31:30.920\nAll right. That was a George Carlin pit. Thank you.\n\n31:30.920 --> 31:33.920\nWe're going to make a cage. It's going to hold so many babies.\n\n31:33.920 --> 31:36.920\nSo many children are going to fit in so many cages.\n\n31:36.920 --> 31:41.920\nI like to think of them as hard cradles. They're hard cradles.\n\n31:41.920 --> 31:45.920\nThink of them, think of them as big boy pens.\n\n31:47.920 --> 31:48.920\nBig boy cribs.\n\n31:48.920 --> 31:52.920\nWhat was that? I want to check in with Spencer for some, for some Spencer.\n\n31:52.920 --> 31:55.920\nIt's a new, it's a new segment called Spencer's Plainies.\n\n31:55.920 --> 31:56.920\nYeah.\n\n31:57.920 --> 31:59.920\nSpencer's Plainies. Oh, sorry.\n\n31:59.920 --> 32:01.920\nI was just so excited. Sorry.\n\n32:01.920 --> 32:02.920\nOh, okay.\n\n32:03.920 --> 32:04.920\nOkay.\n\n32:04.920 --> 32:06.920\nThat was a weird theme.\n\n32:06.920 --> 32:08.920\nA lot of things happened at once.\n\n32:08.920 --> 32:12.920\nWell, I want to check, because I clicked on the thing where the White House lady was going,\n\n32:12.920 --> 32:15.920\nlike where it was like, hey, this is misinformation.\n\n32:15.920 --> 32:19.920\nAnd then she's like, I watched like four minutes of it where she's like,\n\n32:19.920 --> 32:22.920\nthis is the reality of it and all this stuff.\n\n32:22.920 --> 32:27.920\nLike for these people, like as we're all tweeting and then like being alarmed and going like,\n\n32:27.920 --> 32:32.920\nboy, does this feel a lot like something from history books and things and all this stuff.\n\n32:32.920 --> 32:37.920\nAnd then there's like, there's one chorus of counter argument, which is this,\n\n32:37.920 --> 32:39.920\nit happened under Obama too.\n\n32:39.920 --> 32:43.920\nAnd it's like such a scattering of like signals.\n\n32:43.920 --> 32:45.920\nAnd I just don't know if you've parsed any of it.\n\n32:45.920 --> 32:49.920\nWell, a good rule of thumb is everything Republicans say is a lie.\n\n32:49.920 --> 32:58.920\nSo if you start from there, no, but, but specifically, I understand that my understanding is that policy that\n\n32:58.920 --> 33:04.920\neveryone's pointing to in bad faith to lie to people is that unaccompanied minors\n\n33:04.920 --> 33:09.920\nfound at the border without parents were detained.\n\n33:09.920 --> 33:11.920\nSo that's not good.\n\n33:11.920 --> 33:16.920\nBut I mean, you either leave a kid in the desert or you don't leave a kid.\n\n33:16.920 --> 33:18.920\nSo I mean, it's not, it's not a comparison.\n\n33:18.920 --> 33:20.920\nAlso, you know, Obama wasn't great.\n\n33:20.920 --> 33:24.920\nHe was the before Trump, a real deporter guy, but he, he got him out of the country.\n\n33:24.920 --> 33:27.920\nHe didn't keep them in concentration camps.\n\n33:27.920 --> 33:30.920\nSo it's, it's hard to really compare the two.\n\n33:30.920 --> 33:34.920\nThe thing is politicians are bad even when they're not as bad.\n\n33:34.920 --> 33:37.920\nSo Obama is bad even when he's the best president.\n\n33:37.920 --> 33:39.920\nI know, you know, but he was.\n\n33:39.920 --> 33:40.920\nYeah.\n\n33:40.920 --> 33:41.920\nSo does that answer your question?\n\n33:41.920 --> 33:42.920\nYeah.\n\n33:42.920 --> 33:46.920\nBut Dan, if you're going to ask him another question, I want to take another pass at.\n\n33:46.920 --> 33:47.920\nAt a thing.\n\n33:47.920 --> 33:48.920\nThank God.\n\n33:48.920 --> 33:49.920\nYeah.\n\n33:49.920 --> 33:51.920\nI think you owe us another.\n\n33:51.920 --> 33:52.920\nYeah.\n\n33:52.920 --> 33:57.920\nFirst tee up the segment and then we cut to the graphic, you know, in the whole thing.\n\n33:57.920 --> 33:58.920\nRight.\n\n33:58.920 --> 34:01.920\nI haven't played the song in a long time, so I'm not sure it's perfect.\n\n34:01.920 --> 34:06.920\nWell, there's a lot of stuff going on in the news and I can't tell my ass from a hole in the ground\n\n34:06.920 --> 34:10.920\nand I'm too selfish and rich to really care that much.\n\n34:10.920 --> 34:14.920\nThat's when I turned to my friend Spencer for Spencer splainies.\n\n34:14.920 --> 34:16.920\nI don't know.\n\n34:16.920 --> 34:20.920\nDo you have the code, Senator?\n\n34:20.920 --> 34:23.920\nThis isn't ketchup.\n\n34:23.920 --> 34:26.920\nPeople are dying.\n\n34:26.920 --> 34:30.920\nNo, actually, that is ketchup.\n\n34:30.920 --> 34:32.920\nYou bread raptors.\n\n34:32.920 --> 34:45.920\nWow, it seems like we missed an episode.\n\n34:45.920 --> 34:59.920\nYeah, I think I think most programs that are evil originated in some version that people\n\n34:59.920 --> 35:01.920\ndidn't realize were going to be so evil at first.\n\n35:01.920 --> 35:02.920\nYeah.\n\n35:02.920 --> 35:07.920\nBut Obama did not have a clean immigration policy.\n\n35:07.920 --> 35:08.920\nIt was bad.\n\n35:08.920 --> 35:13.920\nAnd there were people at the time saying, hey, eventually someone's going to get a hold of this power and abuse it.\n\n35:13.920 --> 35:19.920\nAnd conversely, Obama got blamed completely for the drone killings, which were very bad,\n\n35:19.920 --> 35:22.920\nbut Bush started it.\n\n35:22.920 --> 35:23.920\nIt started under Bush.\n\n35:23.920 --> 35:27.920\nSo it's like, if it's a billion bad, it's often rooted in the last guy, too.\n\n35:27.920 --> 35:34.920\nI guess we're just paying the price for a fucking hundred years of just going, politicians,\n\n35:34.920 --> 35:37.920\nbeing the price.\n\n35:37.920 --> 35:39.920\nBut we really have to, man.\n\n35:39.920 --> 35:43.920\nWe never should have got those guys off those soapboxes.\n\n35:43.920 --> 35:45.920\nThings would have been a lot better.\n\n35:45.920 --> 35:48.920\nWe could just throw a tomato at them if they didn't like it.\n\n35:48.920 --> 35:51.920\nThey're like, hey, have you seen my baby?\n\n35:51.920 --> 35:53.920\nHave you seen my baby?\n\n35:53.920 --> 35:55.920\nStop, stop.\n\n35:55.920 --> 36:00.920\nAnd also, the politicians can't be picking our pockets when they get their thumbs up on their suspenders like this,\n\n36:00.920 --> 36:01.920\nwhere we can see their hands.\n\n36:01.920 --> 36:03.920\nThat was why they did that.\n\n36:03.920 --> 36:06.920\nWhatever happened to...\n\n36:06.920 --> 36:09.920\nWhatever happened to a good old whistle stop tour?\n\n36:09.920 --> 36:12.920\nNothing right here.\n\n36:12.920 --> 36:13.920\nBut the fact that...\n\n36:13.920 --> 36:17.920\nTeddy Roosevelt was the most attractive fat man.\n\n36:17.920 --> 36:19.920\nI can imagine.\n\n36:19.920 --> 36:22.920\nHe was, like, robust.\n\n36:22.920 --> 36:29.920\nBut that memo that people are tweeting, where it's signed by sessions,\n\n36:29.920 --> 36:35.920\nand it's, like, zero tolerance, like, here we go, that's a real thing.\n\n36:35.920 --> 36:40.920\nThat's not, like, the libs go and we're connecting these dots.\n\n36:40.920 --> 36:43.920\nIt's, like, that's the key, right?\n\n36:43.920 --> 36:46.920\nIs that they were like, oh, let's jack it up.\n\n36:46.920 --> 36:48.920\nYeah, no, that's a policy change.\n\n36:48.920 --> 36:50.920\nYeah, no, a very explicit policy change.\n\n36:50.920 --> 36:55.920\nAnd as a result, whether they intended it or not, there's, like, this wake of that motorboat\n\n36:55.920 --> 36:59.920\nthat's, like, a bunch of babies being ripped from mother's arms, and they're, like, either...\n\n36:59.920 --> 37:03.920\nWhat I can't tell is if they were, like,\n\n37:03.920 --> 37:06.920\nyeah, there's going to be babies ripped from mother's arms,\n\n37:06.920 --> 37:09.920\nbut there's going to be a certain shade of brown baby and brown arm,\n\n37:09.920 --> 37:12.920\nand there's going to be a certain number, and we're going to keep ratcheting it up,\n\n37:12.920 --> 37:15.920\nbecause there's the motorboat in the no-wake zone just going, like,\n\n37:15.920 --> 37:20.920\nAnd pretty soon, it's all about that wall negotiation, right?\n\n37:21.680 --> 37:22.880\nIs that a real, it's like.\n\n37:22.880 --> 37:27.880\nI think that they intend to cause misery\n\n37:28.480 --> 37:32.440\nfor non-white families, mostly at the border\n\n37:32.440 --> 37:36.120\nand at other places where they detain immigrants.\n\n37:36.120 --> 37:38.120\nAnd I think there's people that want there\n\n37:38.120 --> 37:40.080\nto be family misery.\n\n37:40.080 --> 37:40.920\nBecause they're.\n\n37:40.920 --> 37:43.400\nTo deter people from coming in, which is a nightmare.\n\n37:43.400 --> 37:44.600\nThey say that out loud.\n\n37:44.600 --> 37:45.440\nThey've said that.\n\n37:45.440 --> 37:47.120\nBefore it became controversial\n\n37:47.120 --> 37:48.320\nbecause we didn't have pictures.\n\n37:48.320 --> 37:49.840\nThey were like, yeah, it's going to be great.\n\n37:49.840 --> 37:51.120\nWe'll be separating families.\n\n37:51.120 --> 37:52.880\nAnd they'll be like, I don't want to separate my family.\n\n37:52.880 --> 37:54.000\nI'm not going to come to America.\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:55.560\nLike that was what they were saying.\n\n37:55.560 --> 37:56.720\nThis is the plan.\n\n37:56.720 --> 37:58.320\nBut now that it's actually happening,\n\n37:58.320 --> 37:59.600\nthey're like, this isn't happening.\n\n37:59.600 --> 38:03.920\nBut before it was like a political issue,\n\n38:03.920 --> 38:05.480\nthey were like, no, it'll be great.\n\n38:05.480 --> 38:07.480\nWe're going to separate families.\n\n38:07.480 --> 38:09.800\nAnd that was just what they were openly saying.\n\n38:09.800 --> 38:11.520\nYou know how you compromise?\n\n38:11.520 --> 38:19.920\nWall of babies, they're already there.\n\n38:19.920 --> 38:23.360\nTwo birds with one stone.\n\n38:23.360 --> 38:24.520\nIt's called compromise people.\n\n38:24.520 --> 38:29.120\nIs it a wall of white babies that are outward?\n\n38:29.120 --> 38:33.560\nHey, Jan, take it easy.\n\n38:33.560 --> 38:36.960\nI think you wildly misread my points.\n\n38:36.960 --> 38:40.520\nNow, this wall is going to be brown, brown, brown.\n\n38:40.520 --> 38:42.560\nBut is that so that's like a very grizzly.\n\n38:42.560 --> 38:44.640\nYou're talking about like a thunderdome thing\n\n38:44.640 --> 38:47.480\nwhere the babies are like an example.\n\n38:47.480 --> 38:50.520\nThe picture of the cage, all these kids are in it.\n\n38:50.520 --> 38:52.680\nYou're making a thunderdome for people.\n\n38:52.680 --> 38:56.880\nI thought maybe like healthy, white, well-fed, fat, white\n\n38:56.880 --> 38:59.960\nbabies that are like facing Mexico.\n\n38:59.960 --> 39:04.840\nAnd the sign says, look, we already have so many babies.\n\n39:04.840 --> 39:05.680\nWe're using a dispenser.\n\n39:05.680 --> 39:08.840\nAnd the babies are like, we love America.\n\n39:08.840 --> 39:11.520\nDon't come in here with your baby.\n\n39:11.520 --> 39:16.120\nI mean, I hear people say, oh, it's not\n\n39:16.120 --> 39:17.720\nhelpful to say that they're Nazis.\n\n39:17.720 --> 39:18.320\nAnd I hear that.\n\n39:18.320 --> 39:20.320\nI'm not sure where I stand on it.\n\n39:20.320 --> 39:23.000\nBut definitely, if they're like, OK, fine, fine, fine,\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:25.440\nfor sake of argument, if they're not literally Nazis,\n\n39:25.440 --> 39:30.320\nthey're at least like the bad guys from Children of Men.\n\n39:30.320 --> 39:33.680\nAnd I think we're our own bad thing.\n\n39:33.680 --> 39:34.680\nWe're our own bad thing.\n\n39:34.680 --> 39:35.520\nWe've got to stop it.\n\n39:35.520 --> 39:37.520\nYeah.\n\n39:37.520 --> 39:39.000\nHere's the thing.\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:42.800\nI like to think, I think in my listenership,\n\n39:42.800 --> 39:46.160\nif that's a word, there's probably everything but Nazis.\n\n39:46.160 --> 39:47.880\nMaybe there's a couple, like there's probably\n\n39:47.880 --> 39:50.440\na little churn coming through.\n\n39:50.440 --> 39:53.000\nGorka could be a secret Nazi.\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:54.840\nI saw enough Rick and Morty to tune in.\n\n39:54.840 --> 39:56.200\nWhat was this cuck talking about?\n\n39:56.200 --> 39:57.400\nBut I don't know.\n\n39:57.400 --> 39:59.160\nYou could be a libertarian and listen to the show.\n\n39:59.160 --> 40:02.560\nYou could be a Republican, a fiscal log cabin Republican.\n\n40:02.560 --> 40:05.040\nYou're probably not going to go, oh, he's a big, fat, blow\n\n40:05.040 --> 40:07.200\nhard, like I resonate with him.\n\n40:07.200 --> 40:10.000\nLike you're welcome here.\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:11.400\nI'm not going to shame you.\n\n40:11.400 --> 40:13.320\nFree markets?\n\n40:13.320 --> 40:17.560\nAs you probably know, like I was the most apolitical,\n\n40:17.560 --> 40:19.240\nlike kind of like guy.\n\n40:19.240 --> 40:22.000\nLike I was like, oh, I don't believe in politics.\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:23.200\nI don't believe in the election.\n\n40:23.200 --> 40:24.760\nAnd then it was like, the election happened.\n\n40:24.760 --> 40:26.160\nAnd then it became fucking Schrab.\n\n40:26.160 --> 40:27.160\nI fucking hate Schrab.\n\n40:27.160 --> 40:29.360\nI hate him so much.\n\n40:29.360 --> 40:31.680\nFucking hate him.\n\n40:31.680 --> 40:34.400\nYou know, I said, what do you want to talk about?\n\n40:34.400 --> 40:36.280\nFarts for an hour?\n\n40:36.280 --> 40:37.200\nIt's just you.\n\n40:37.200 --> 40:38.800\nIt's all, it's just you.\n\n40:38.800 --> 40:43.800\nI'm trying to connect with you with the 7-Up thing.\n\n40:43.800 --> 40:45.680\nYeah, you're not giving Schrab enough credit\n\n40:45.680 --> 40:48.080\nfor trying to connect with you earlier.\n\n40:48.080 --> 40:49.480\nI don't suffer the illusion that I'm supposed to be.\n\n40:49.480 --> 40:50.680\nI never see you anymore.\n\n40:50.680 --> 40:51.520\nI never see you anymore.\n\n40:51.520 --> 40:53.560\nJust want to have a conversation with my friends\n\n40:53.560 --> 40:56.120\nabout what's going on in my world, which\n\n40:56.120 --> 40:59.080\nincludes what's going on in other people's world.\n\n40:59.080 --> 41:00.200\nNo one's stopping you.\n\n41:00.200 --> 41:01.440\nYeah, you're not stopping me.\n\n41:01.440 --> 41:04.080\nYou look like a fucking dead scarecrow over there.\n\n41:04.080 --> 41:07.400\nYou're swiveling around in your chairs, rolling his eyes.\n\n41:07.400 --> 41:08.760\nHe's like, he's like mounting a thing.\n\n41:08.760 --> 41:10.680\nHe's like, you think I don't know what's going on?\n\n41:10.680 --> 41:15.440\nYou got Schrab loyalists like building in my crowd.\n\n41:15.440 --> 41:16.240\nI know what's going on.\n\n41:16.240 --> 41:17.840\nPerhaps the most dangerous faction of all.\n\n41:17.840 --> 41:20.280\nHe's splintering my people.\n\n41:20.280 --> 41:21.920\nPeople are coming here to see you.\n\n41:21.920 --> 41:24.080\nI see your t-shirt shop.\n\n41:24.080 --> 41:25.440\nI saw your t-shirt shop.\n\n41:25.440 --> 41:26.800\nI see you selling shit.\n\n41:31.040 --> 41:32.120\nWhy are you so mean?\n\n41:32.120 --> 41:34.520\nThere's so angry.\n\n41:34.520 --> 41:40.200\nAnyways, Nazis, all I'm saying, look, Nazis,\n\n41:40.200 --> 41:43.640\nall you got to do, because it's this faction of people\n\n41:43.640 --> 41:46.520\nthat are like, if you were to just be like,\n\n41:46.520 --> 41:48.600\noh, I'm going to get a swastika tattoo,\n\n41:48.600 --> 41:52.640\nand I hate everybody that's not me and a Nazi.\n\n41:52.640 --> 41:53.680\nHow would you do that?\n\n41:53.680 --> 41:55.760\nThat's terrible.\n\n41:55.760 --> 41:58.680\nThe problem is that people that are like, whoa, whoa, whoa,\n\n41:58.680 --> 42:00.000\nwhat's this Nazi talk?\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:00.960\nI don't like that.\n\n42:00.960 --> 42:02.080\nYou know what I am?\n\n42:02.080 --> 42:04.400\nI'm a totally intellectual, logical guy\n\n42:04.400 --> 42:06.000\nwho hates overreaction.\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:08.480\nI'd like to exterminate overreaction\n\n42:08.480 --> 42:10.240\nwith some logical discourse.\n\n42:10.240 --> 42:12.080\nWhy do you say a Nazi all the time?\n\n42:12.080 --> 42:13.600\nThat seems really hysterical.\n\n42:13.600 --> 42:16.720\nI'm such a logical person that's definitely not a Nazi.\n\n42:16.720 --> 42:20.400\nI just happen to be arguing for calmness and discourse\n\n42:20.400 --> 42:21.720\nin both sides of the thing.\n\n42:21.720 --> 42:23.400\nAnd I'm like, you're a fucking closet Nazi.\n\n42:23.400 --> 42:26.080\nYou're just biding your time.\n\n42:26.080 --> 42:28.040\nAnd I just say to those people.\n\n42:28.040 --> 42:30.280\nWhy are you afraid of honest debate?\n\n42:30.280 --> 42:32.240\nYeah, why don't you keep talking to me\n\n42:32.240 --> 42:33.800\nabout whether or not we're Nazis?\n\n42:33.800 --> 42:36.320\nI'm just fucking exhausted already.\n\n42:36.320 --> 42:38.000\nI'm a spoiled baby.\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:40.320\nCan I start punching you yet?\n\n42:40.320 --> 42:41.960\nLike, I really got so much time left.\n\n42:41.960 --> 42:43.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:45.720\nI like to imagine the current day.\n\n42:45.720 --> 42:48.680\nIf Hitler was here now, there would be some bunker\n\n42:48.680 --> 42:52.200\nwhere he was like, we have 40,000 trolls.\n\n42:52.200 --> 42:53.360\nWe can send it Harmon.\n\n42:53.360 --> 42:55.640\nYes, yes.\n\n42:55.640 --> 42:57.240\nI just say to those people, hey,\n\n42:57.240 --> 42:59.440\nif you're really honestly for real,\n\n42:59.440 --> 43:01.240\nyou're honest about this fact.\n\n43:01.240 --> 43:02.680\nYou're going like, you know what?\n\n43:02.680 --> 43:04.360\nWe're never going to turn Nazi.\n\n43:04.360 --> 43:05.960\nThis isn't anything.\n\n43:05.960 --> 43:08.120\nJust would you please, you know what?\n\n43:08.120 --> 43:09.480\nWe help you so much.\n\n43:09.480 --> 43:13.000\nWould you just Google 1933 Germany?\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:15.640\nBecause you think you're going to see a description that's\n\n43:15.640 --> 43:20.440\ngoing to, just do an hour of fucking research.\n\n43:20.440 --> 43:24.440\nAnd if I'm wrong, you will be so much more armed\n\n43:24.440 --> 43:25.600\nin your next argument.\n\n43:25.600 --> 43:28.880\nYou'll be able to go, there's a lot of differences here.\n\n43:28.880 --> 43:34.960\nBut I'm afraid you're going to see that everything has a ramp\n\n43:34.960 --> 43:37.480\nand that everything starts a certain way.\n\n43:37.480 --> 43:44.160\nAnd that marginalization and institutionalization of it\n\n43:44.160 --> 43:47.520\nis like, it all takes the same form in the beginning.\n\n43:47.520 --> 43:49.840\nAnd it's all very argued about.\n\n43:49.840 --> 43:53.160\nAnd people are always amorphous and blurry about it.\n\n43:53.160 --> 43:58.080\nLike, while regimes change hands and cabinets switch around\n\n43:58.080 --> 43:59.320\nand everybody has these arguments,\n\n43:59.320 --> 44:01.440\nand it's like the things that don't change are

I don't want to upstage everybody,\n\n01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.160\nbut look at this guy over here.\n\n01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:39.160\nHe came swinging down on a porch swing,\n\n01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:42.160\nand then just mauled them.\n\n01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:44.160\nOkay, so we're right in this theater.\n\n01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:46.160\nWe got Bernie Mac the Bear.\n\n01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:50.160\nYou got this guy who's screaming and bleeding, kind of like a hostage.\n\n01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.160\nEveryone else is dead.\n\n01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:55.160\nBut I can talk.\n\n01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:56.160\nHey, Carlos.\n\n01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:00.160\nCarlos, interrogate this guy before he bleeds out.\n\n01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:02.160\nI interrogate this guy.\n\n01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.160\nOkay, how do you want to do it?\n\n01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:07.160\nI put my foot on him.\n\n01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:10.160\nNo, I can't do that. I can't do that.\n\n01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:12.160\nClassic criminology.\n\n01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:19.160\nWell, can I use a form of the spell?\n\n01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.160\nYou know, I have, like, cure light wounds,\n\n01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.160\nand I can use those to inflict wounds.\n\n01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:25.160\nWould that be to say that I could, like,\n\n01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:28.160\ncould I use my wound-affecting energy\n\n01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:36.160\nto kind of, like, basically, magically open and shut his wounds?\n\n01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:40.160\nYou can do that, but it would take, like,\n\n01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.160\nbasically the last of your magic,\n\n01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:44.160\nbecause you've been casting a lot of spells today,\n\n01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.160\nso you're pretty low.\n\n01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:46.160\nWell, it should be worth it.\n\n01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.160\nI'm sure it's going to be a jackpot of information.\n\n01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:50.160\nI have the spell stabilized,\n\n01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:53.160\nwhich can cause a dying creature to stabilize their condition.\n\n01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.160\nSo you can kill him.\n\n01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.160\nI don't think we want him stabilized.\n\n01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:59.160\nI think we're going to milk the fruit that is a man\n\n01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:02.160\non the cusp of both worlds.\n\n01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:05.160\nWow.\n\n01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:10.160\nYou exist on the threshold\n\n01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:14.160\nof what the Church of Silver light regards as worthy.\n\n01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:16.160\nYou can make a choice,\n\n01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.160\nprovide us with information\n\n01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:21.160\nthat will guide the light to cleanse the world\n\n01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:24.160\nand slip back into mortality,\n\n01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:27.160\nor lose your grip forever and plummet\n\n01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:30.160\nin the margins of the forgotten.\n\n01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:36.160\nOh, damn.\n\n01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:38.160\nNot bad.\n\n01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:41.160\nHe goes, oh, yeah, no, okay.\n\n01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:43.160\nWhat do you want?\n\n01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.160\nThat's crazy.\n\n01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:49.160\nYou know I just got into this because I love acting, but...\n\n01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.160\nYeah, it seems like someone's acting\n\n01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:54.160\nlike they don't have the information that we want.\n\n01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:56.160\nWhere is the gem?\n\n01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:58.160\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:01.160\nNo, I'm kidding, I don't say Patchens' Jump.\n\n01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:03.160\nGod damn it.\n\n01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:05.160\nThis is the part where I fail.\n\n01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.160\nYou can ask me questions.\n\n01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.160\nI have a question.\n\n01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:08.160\nOkay.\n\n01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:09.160\nAm I the bear that mauled the guy?\n\n01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:10.160\nIs that why he's been hurt?\n\n01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:11.160\nNot that guy.\n\n01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:12.160\nYou killed the other guy.\n\n01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:13.160\nLike, he's dead.\n\n01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:15.160\nThe guy you killed is dead.\n\n01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:18.160\nOkay, so I was worried you were undoing my work.\n\n01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.160\nSorry.\n\n01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:24.160\nI look through the body of the dead man.\n\n01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:26.160\nOkay, he's already been looted by Jeff.\n\n01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:34.160\nOkay, I look through his body.\n\n01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:36.160\nWhat does that mean?\n\n01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:39.160\nI don't look through his clothes.\n\n01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:44.160\nI look through his body because I'm like swamp thing, alright?\n\n01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:47.160\nSo I'm gonna look inside.\n\n01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:48.160\nUh-huh.\n\n01:16:48.160 -->

--> 01:18:24.160\nWho could?\n\n01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:26.160\nWe were on this case.\n\n01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:29.160\nWe traced these guys down.\n\n01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:35.160\nWe're looking for these like dragon born kind of dragon marked guys.\n\n01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:36.160\nRight?\n\n01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.160\nA little bit.\n\n01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.160\nSo, okay.\n\n01:18:38.160

he wasn't talking.\n\n01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:48.160\nYou found a tiny bit of information about a drop point, but you didn't know where the\n\n01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.160\ndrop point is.\n\n01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:50.160\nRight.\n\n01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.160\nOkay.\n\n01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.160\nYou thought Shrove could help you out, but he didn't and he fucked off.\n\n01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:56.160\nSo, then you went looking essentially for more clues and that's where you are now.\n\n01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:57.160\nOkay.\n\n01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.160\nStill trying to find that drop point.\n\n01:18:58.160 --> 01:18:59.160\nSo, here we go.\n\n01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:00.160\nWhere's Shrove?\n\n01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.160\nYeah.\n\n01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:02.160\nThere we go.\n\n01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:03.160\nI don't know, man.\n\n01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:04.160\nI think he was fighting the fire.\n\n01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:06.160\nYou know there's a fire happening right now?\n\n01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:08.160\nYou piece of shit.\n\n01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:10.160\nI didn't do it.\n\n01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:15.160\nBy the power of the Silver Flame, you show no fire.\n\n01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:16.160\nI'm complying.\n\n01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:17.160\nWhat?\n\n01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:18.160\nI'm complying.\n\n01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:19.160\nWell, where's Shrove?\n\n01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:20.160\nI don't.\n\n01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.160\nI don't.\n\n01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:22.160\nI think he might be fighting fires.\n\n01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:23.160\nOkay.\n\n01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:24.160\nOne more thing though.\n\n01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:25.160\nJust in case.\n\n01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:28.160\nThe Silver Flame is not helping with the fires that are raging.\n\n01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:29.160\nRight.\n\n01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:30.160\nThank you.\n\n01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:32.160\nI could connect those dots.\n\n01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:33.160\nThat would be fine.\n\n01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:34.160\nWhat are you guys talking about?\n\n01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:37.160\nI want to ask you one more thing.\n\n01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:41.160\nWait, so this is where Shrove and...\n\n01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:43.160\nWhere's the drop point?\n\n01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:46.160\nProbably where the fire is.\n\n01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:47.160\nLet me...\n\n01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:48.160\nNo, I don't think it is.\n\n01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:53.160\nBut it seems like the fire might get close if you don't hurry.\n\n01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.160\nI'll tell you where it is.\n\n01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:56.160\nWhere it is.\n\n01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:59.160\nIt's in Boykin's Pig Farm.\n\n01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:01.160\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:08.160\nMy name is Burfboro Binkus.\n\n01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:14.160\nDo your friends call you something shorter?\n\n01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:15.160\nBinkus.\n\n01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:16.160\nSorry?\n\n01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:17.160\nBinkus.\n\n01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:18.160\nBinkus.\n\n01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.160\nBinkus.\n\n01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.160\nBinkus.\n\n01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:21.160\nBinkus with a B.\n\n01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:22.160\nBinkus.\n\n01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:23.160\nBinkus.\n\n01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:24.160\nBinkus.\n\n01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:25.160\nBurfboro.\n\n01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:26.160\nBinkus.\n\n01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:27.160\nDo you guys smell fire?\n\n01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:28.160\nBinkus.\n\n01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:29.160\nBinkus.\n\n01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:30.160\nBinkus?\n\n01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:32.160\nI can't understand.\n\n01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:36.160\nLet's just all decide to call him Binkus.\n\n01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:37.160\nBinkus.\n\n01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:38.160\nIs Binkus close?\n\n01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:39.160\nIt's very close.\n\n01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:40.160\nAll right, Binkus.\n\n01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:44.160\nYou lucked the fuck out by the power of the Silver Flame.\n\n01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:45.160\nYour wounds are healed.\n\n01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:47.160\nOh, thanks, man.\n\n01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:48.160\nMove on.\n\n01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:49.160\nMove on.\n\n01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:51.160\nTell us the name of the pig farm again.\n\n01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:54.160\nBoykin Hodges Pig Farm and Stabulary.\n\n01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.160\nLet's go.\n\n01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:59.160\nSo help me Christ, Binkus.\n\n01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:01.160\nOnce Christ is invented.\n\n01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:05.160\nI'm scared of this fire.\n\n01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:07.160\nIt's all right, Beharney.\n\n01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:13.160\nYou can call me Orson Welles, the bear.\n\n01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:15.160\nSo help me Christ, Binkus.\n\n01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:19.160\nIf we go to that fire and it doesn't pan out for us, and yes, you have to allow for the\n\n01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:23.160\nfact that we're inept, so it might not work out for us through no fault of your own.\n\n01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:26.160\nWe will be back and we will fuck you up.\n\n01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.160\nWe'll fuck up your family.\n\n01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:30.160\nWe will rip the children from your mother's arms.\n\n01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:34.160\nAnd we will put them in things that we convince people aren't cages.\n\n01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:39.160\nAnd if they still convinces their cages, we'll say it was Obama's idea.\n\n01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:45.160\nLike, we can go round and round, Binkus.\n\n01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:47.160\nI'm trying to help.\n\n01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.160\nHow do we get to the pig farm?\n\n01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:50.160\nWhich direction is it?\n\n01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:51.160\nNorth.\n\n01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:52.160\nWait.\n\n01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:56.160\nGuys, I have no direction, so I can just turn north.\n\n01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:57.160\nIt's that way.\n\n01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:58.160\nAll right.\n\n01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:01.160\nFollow me, motherfuckers.\n\n01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:06.160\nAm I cool to join you guys?\n\n01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:07.160\nYes, please.\n\n01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:12.160\nI'm not sure if I'm loyal to your party, but it seems fun for now.\n\n01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:17.160\nA lot of people that have no direction, you're not supposed to follow.\n\n01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:20.160\nNo one tells bear rules.\n\n01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:25.160\nOkay, so you head outside and there is indeed a fire.\n\n01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:30.160\nIt's started by the tavern, and it's grown wildly out of control on account of the town\n\n01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:33.160\nis protected by a big flammable wall.\n\n01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:38.160\nIt's starting to engulf the town as you head north to Boykin Hodge's pig farm, which you do.\n\n01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:41.160\nDid we start this fire?\n\n01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:45.160\nWe didn't start the fire.\n\n01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:48.160\nIt was always burning, arguably.\n\n01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:49.160\nYeah.\n\n01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:54.160\nIt seems too big to have started it, but you do remember starting a fire.\n\n01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:59.160\nIt wasn't my brand of cigarettes.\n\n01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:01.160\nYou go to the pig farm.\n\n01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:05.160\nIt's like a farmhouse with a little...\n\n01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:06.160\nNo, sorry.\n\n01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:08.160\nIt's a farmhouse with a barn.\n\n01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:13.160\nSo then the barn is next to the stablery, which is like a customer-facing stablery\n\n01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:15.160\nwhere you put your own horses and stuff.\n\n01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:20.160\nAnd then out the back behind the barn, that's where all the pigs is.\n\n01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:23.160\nWe got to save these pigs.\n\n01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.160\nThe pigs are in back.\n\n01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:30.160\nWe should have asked specifically where the drop point...\n\n01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:32.160\nWho?\n\n01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:33.160\nMingus.\n\n01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:35.160\nWe should have asked him.\n\n01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:37.160\nYou can ask him.\n\n01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:40.160\nMingus was specifically where at the pig farm.\n\n01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:43.160\nBecause a point sounds very specific.\n\n01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:44.160\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:45.160\nI'll tell you.\n\n01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:49.160\nIt's in this corner of the third pig stable.\n\n01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:50.160\nThank you.\n\n01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:52.160\nUh-oh.\n\n01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:55.160\nOh, Christ, Mingus, if you're lying.\n\n01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:58.160\nDo we have to throw birds at it?\n\n01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:01.160\nAll the pigs to make them fall down?\n\n01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:05.160\nI don't know nothing about no pig fighting.\n\n01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:13.160\nMingus, if you're lying, I'm going to wear your ass like a face mask.\n\n01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:18.160\nI'm going to go for trick-or-treat as your ass.\n\n01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:20.160\nAnd it's going to be one of those costumes where it's just...\n\n01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:24.160\nMost of the attention is put into the plastic your ass face.\n\n01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:30.160\nAnd then the rest is just a plastic apron with a picture of you from head to toe on it.\n\n01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:34.160\nA lot of people will point out it's not a costume.\n\n01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:39.160\nWould this singular hole be for your mouth or your one eye?\n\n01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:41.160\nFor one eye, probably.\n\n01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:43.160\nI don't think Mingus wants to find out.\n\n01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:44.160\nOkay.\n\n01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:45.160\nYeah, man.\n\n01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:46.160\nI don't know.\n\n01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:48.160\nYou should talk to Boykin Hodge.\n\n01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:50.160\nHe doesn't really talk.\n\n01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:51.160\nHey, guys.\n\n01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:52.160\nI don't know.\n\n01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:55.160\nI mean, like, what are we doing here?\n\n01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:58.160\nI'm starting to question a lot.\n\n01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:03.160\nI mean, you guys were cool for letting me come along and we had some fun, but what are we doing?\n\n01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:05.160\nAll right, well, let's get to the...\n\n01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:07.160\nStick it out, Gary.\n\n01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:09.160\nHis name is Garry Shandling.\n\n01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:10.160\nHe's a Shambling Mound.\n\n01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:11.160\nI'm a Shambling Mound.\n\n01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:12.160\nI'm getting hungry.\n\n01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:13.160\nCan I eat a pig?\n\n01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:14.160\nThere we go.\n\n01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:15.160\nYeah.\n\n01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:17.160\nWe'll incentivize Barney Mack to come along.\n\n01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:18.160\nLet's go to the pig farm.\n\n01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:23.160\nThird pig's pen from the left in the corner.\n\n01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:24.160\nDrop point.\n\n01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:25.160\nNo one should be eating the pig.\n\n01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:26.160\nThey're adorable.\n\n01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:27.160\nWe got to save the pigs from the fire.\n\n01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:28.160\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:31.160\nCome on, Gary.\n\n01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:33.160\nBack me up on this.\n\n01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:35.160\nLet's just do one thing.\n\n01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:37.160\nOne thing right.\n\n01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:44.160\nUntil we decide, I'll just have this pig sitting in front of me with an apple and I'll be deliciously\n\n01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:46.160\nsharpening my knife.\n\n01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:50.160\nLet's go to the cocksuckin' pig farm.\n\n01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:51.160\nWait a minute.\n\n01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:55.160\nWhat kind of pigs are these?\n\n01:25:55.160 --> 01:26:00.160\nPigs are having a real blast.\n\n01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:05.160\nThis is a different kind of pig farm.\n\n01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:09.160\nI start wandering off just like muttering to myself.\n\n01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:10.160\nWait.\n\n01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:13.160\nAre these just sex pigs?\n\n01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:17.160\nYes, you can do whatever you want with these pigs.\n\n01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:18.160\nIt's pretty gross.\n\n01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:19.160\nIt's a little gross.\n\n01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.160\nIt's a little hot.\n\n01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:24.160\nCustomers are always right.\n\n01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:30.160\nIs there, like, what's the cutest one?\n\n01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:33.160\nLike, what, like, where?\n\n01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:34.160\nCharlotte.\n\n01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:35.160\nCharlotte?\n\n01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:36.160\nOkay.\n\n01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:39.160\nWhy is she the cutest?\n\n01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.160\nLet's just go.\n\n01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:42.160\nI go to the third pig pen.\n\n01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.160\nAll right.\n\n01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:50.160\nYou go back to the pig area and you see a pier almost as if supernaturally, like this crazy\n\n01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:51.160\nold bald guy.\n\n01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:58.160\nHe looks like a really angry farmer, like an old hardworn farmer.\n\n01:26:58.160 --> 01:26:59.160\nSir.\n\n01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:04.160\nHe goes, are you choking?\n\n01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:08.160\nI think we got to do the Heimlich on this guy.\n\n01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:09.160\nYou all right?\n\n01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:10.160\nHe points to his voice.\n\n01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:11.160\nHe's about to have vocal surgery.\n\n01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:12.160\nHe points to what?\n\n01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:15.160\nHe points to a big button on his chest.\n\n01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:19.160\nHe points, what?\n\n01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:22.160\nI think, I think he doesn't, I think he can't speak.\n\n01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:24.160\nI think he's lost the ability to speak.\n\n01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:25.160\nHe points at you while you're saying that.\n\n01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:26.160\nHe points at me.\n\n01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:27.160\nHe points at you?\n\n01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:28.160\nWhile he's saying that.\n\n01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:29.160\nI can speak?\n\n01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:32.160\nOh, he's pointing like bingo, like he can't speak.\n\n01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:33.160\nHey.\n\n01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:34.160\nWhy can't you speak?\n\n01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:35.160\nAre you dying?\n\n01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:36.160\nNo.\n\n01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:37.160\nHe just can't speak.\n\n01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:38.160\nDoes anybody know sign language?\n\n01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:40.160\nAre you a good person?\n\n01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:41.160\nHe nods, yeah.\n\n01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:42.160\nHe's what?\n\n01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:43.160\nHe nods.\n\n01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:44.160\nHe nods.\n\n01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:45.160\nIs this the drop point?\n\n01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:46.160\nYeah.\n\n01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:47.160\nDarth Vader would nod.\n\n01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:49.160\nHe looks at you quizzically.\n\n01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:53.160\nDo you know who Darth Vader is?\n\n01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:56.160\nCan anyone, does anyone telepathy?\n\n01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:58.160\nDarth Vader would nod.\n\n01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:01.160\nWait, well listen, we're here.\n\n01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:08.160\nI can do sign language, but whenever I do, I accidentally slash people with my claws.\n\n01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:10.160\nYou have bad depth perception.\n\n01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:13.160\nI'm bigger than I think.\n\n01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:15.160\nWe're here for the drop.\n\n01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:19.160\nHe just looks at you like he doesn't know what you're saying.\n\n01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:22.160\nHave you heard of anyone named Patchens before?\n\n01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:23.160\nHe shakes his head.\n\n01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.160\nNo.\n\n01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:26.160\nYou have a gem?\n\n01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:28.160\nAre you waiting for a gem?\n\n01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:31.160\nHe squints his head and he goes, no.\n\n01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:34.160\nAre you waiting for a delivery?\n\n01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:41.160\nHe thinks like he's remembering and then he goes out around back of his house.\n\n01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:45.160\nHey, where are you going?\n\n01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:46.160\nI guess we follow him.\n\n01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:49.160\nDude, when you said this guy appears, you don't mean like ethereally.\n\n01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:51.160\nNo, but like, he's a normal guy.\n\n01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:55.160\nLike in those scenes where it's like a creepy guy and it's like, oh, he wasn't there.\n\n01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.160\nAh, the shadows.\n\n01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:57.160\nYeah.\n\n01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:00.160\nRight, exactly.\n\n01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:03.160\nThat's exactly the trope I was trying to hit, yeah.\n\n01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:08.160\nWell, let's fucking take this guy.\n\n01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:12.160\nDid he walk out beckoning us to follow or he just walked out?\n\n01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:14.160\nHe was being creepy about it, so you couldn't tell.\n\n01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:22.160\nOkay, so what's my thing where I conjure up like a light so we can see in the darkness of the pen?\n\n01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:23.160\nDancing lights?\n\n01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:24.160\nSure.\n\n01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:26.160\nI just have light.\n\n01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:27.160\nI can make things a torch.\n\n01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:28.160\nOh, yeah, okay.\n\n01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:29.160\nSo I reach out and pick up a stick.\n\n01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:30.160\nPoof, it's a torch.\n\n01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:31.160\nIt is.\n\n01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:33.160\nI examine the corner that he was in.\n\n01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:34.160\nThe corner he was in?\n\n01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:36.160\nOh, I just threw the whole pen.\n\n01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:37.160\nSay that again.\n\n01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:40.160\nI examine the pig pen that we discovered.\n\n01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:42.160\nSo you are following him then?\n\n01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:43.160\nOkay.\n\n01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:46.160\nDid he get up and leave the pig pen?\n\n01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:49.160\nYou didn't get quite to the pig pen.\n\n01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:50.160\nOh, okay.\n\n01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:53.160\nWe thought that we were arriving at the pig pen and meeting him.\n\n01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:54.160\nRight.\n\n01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:56.160\nNow he was just like, sorry if I was wrong.\n\n01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:57.160\nLet's follow him.\n\n01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:58.160\nLet's see where this leads.\n\n01:29:58.160 --> 01:29:59.160\nOkay.\n\n01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:00.160\nFollow him.\n\n01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:05.160\nHe goes around back to the pig pen and he goes and stands in front of the third one.\n\n01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:07.160\nAnd he's just kind of like looking at it.\n\n01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:09.160\nLooking in the corner.\n\n01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:11.160\nAnd he goes, phew.\n\n01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:12.160\nAll right.\n\n01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:15.160\nWell, somebody give this guy the Heimlich.\n\n01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:16.160\nHeimlich?\n\n01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:18.160\nYou don't hang it up.\n\n01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:21.160\nI examine, I use my light and examine the pen.\n\n01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:24.160\nAll right.\n\n01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:26.160\nYou do that.\n\n01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:32.160\nYou find an old muddy sack in the corner of the pen hidden under mud.\n\n01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:34.160\nYou love those muddy sacks.\n\n01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:38.160\nI leap on that sack and I open it up.\n\n01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:39.160\nOh, shit.\n\n01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:40.160\nYou do it.\n\n01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:41.160\nI look inside.\n\n01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:42.160\nThere's a gem.\n\n01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:43.160\nGod damn it.\n\n01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:44.160\nWe did it.\n\n01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:45.160\nWe fucking did it.\n\n01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:47.160\nOutrageous.\n\n01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:50.160\nWe did everything wrong and it led to...\n\n01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:52.160\nOutrageous.\n\n01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:53.160\nWe got it.\n\n01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:55.160\nWe got Patchen's gem.\n\n01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:57.160\nHere's Patchen's.\n\n01:30:57.160 --> 01:31:00.160\nTruly outrageous.\n\n01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:01.160\nWhat about this farmer?\n\n01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:03.160\nCan I maul him for fun?\n\n01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:07.160\nWell, as you say that, it seems like while everyone's excited over the gem,\n\n01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:09.160\nhe's picked up a brick and has started creeping towards you.\n\n01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:10.160\nOutrageous.\n\n01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:11.160\nCreeping towards us.\n\n01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:13.160\nYeah, with a big brick in his hand.\n\n01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:15.160\nI'm telling you, let me maul the guy.\n\n01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:16.160\nReady?\n\n01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:17.160\nOkay.\n\n01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:18.160\nCountry bear.\n\n01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:20.160\nCountry bear.\n\n01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:32.160\nAnd then I do the bear rape in order to caprio.\n\n01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:39.160\nAnd I leave him for a second and then I come back.\n\n01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:43.160\nYou don't come here for the gem drop off, do you?\n\n01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:48.160\nGuys, do we need another monster in our group?\n\n01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:51.160\nI mean, like, do we need one?\n\n01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:53.160\nThere's a guy with a brick.\n\n01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:55.160\nI'm feeling unwell all of a sudden.\n\n01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:57.160\nI cast Dazzle so we can't see.\n\n01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:59.160\nWell, the bear attacks first.\n\n01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:00.160\nHold on.\n\n01:32:00.160 -->

yeah, the Orson Welles attacks Boink and Hodge\n\n01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:15.160\nand you just get him, you smack him in the face\n\n01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:17.160\nand then you just bite him right in the chest\n\n01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:19.160\nand then you just start ripping him apart\n\n01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:23.160\nand he starts hissing and screaming and he's like\n\n01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:25.160\nand he's screaming and his teeth are sharp\n\n01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:28.160\nand it seems like he's a vampire.\n\n01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:32.160\nUh-oh.\n\n01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:35.160\nYou're eating a vampire.\n\n01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:37.160\nIs that, I don't know how the rules work.\n\n01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:39.160\nDoes that make me contagious?\n\n01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:41.160\nYou also don't know as a bear.\n\n01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:44.160\nShould I get a tetanus shot?\n\n01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:47.160\nShit, I'm a cleric. I'm a cleric. God damn it.\n\n01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:49.160\nI'm a cleric.\n\n01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:53.160\nI think you're out of magic now because you used it on the guy.\n\n01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:58.160\nYeah, but you have to have faith.\n\n01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:00.160\nYou ever see Fright Night?\n\n01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:02.160\nThat's fair.\n\n01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:05.160\nUh, okay, I'm out of magic.\n\n01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:08.160\nI'm out of magic. That's fine.\n\n01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:12.160\nI'm sure there's some passive ability to turn vampires.\n\n01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:15.160\nWhat's our proximity to each other and to Blankens?\n\n01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:17.160\nYou're within 10 feet of each other.\n\n01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:19.160\nI have a question.\n\n01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:24.160\nWhen I'm a shambling mound, okay, so I'm like a plant creature.\n\n01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:25.160\nRight?\n\n01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:26.160\nRight.\n\n01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:28.160\nIs there any wood in me?\n\n01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:30.160\nYeah, there's some woodier branches.\n\n01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:31.160\nYou see where I'm going with this?\n\n01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:32.160\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:33.160\nOkay.\n\n01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:37.160\nI go up to him and I do one of these.\n\n01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:39.160\nOh, that's not, I thought.\n\n01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:40.160\nWhat did you think I was going to do?\n\n01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:42.160\nSteak in the heart. I thought a steak in the heart.\n\n01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:43.160\nI didn't know you were going to...\n\n01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:47.160\nThere's no Jesus in this world.\n\n01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:50.160\nWe thought you were going to sacrifice one of your limbs so that we could steak him through the heart.\n\n01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:55.160\nWhat are we going to wait for Christ to be born?\n\n01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:56.160\nOh, I'm sorry.\n\n01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:58.160\nOkay, I did it wrong.\n\n01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:00.160\nSo we'll do it your way.\n\n01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:02.160\nSteak, steak through the heart.\n\n01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:04.160\nThat's got to be dimensionless.\n\n01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:05.160\nDo you have a hammer?\n\n01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:06.160\nWhat?\n\n01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:07.160\nDo you have a hammer?\n\n01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:09.160\nYou don't need one. It's your fists.\n\n01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:10.160\nJust punch him.\n\n01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:14.160\nOkay, I'll punch him with one of my stick fingers in the heart.\n\n01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:16.160\nAim for his heart.\n\n01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:17.160\nAim for his heart, stick finger.\n\n01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:20.160\nBear, you can hammer his elbow if that's...\n\n01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:22.160\nAll right, okay.\n\n01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:27.160\nI honestly think we only need one monster.\n\n01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:30.160\nI think that's a little bit turf war-ish.\n\n01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:31.160\nYeah, well...\n\n01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:32.160\nI think there's...\n\n01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:35.160\nI'm here first.\n\n01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:41.160\nI'm not disputing that, but everybody else is being cool.\n\n01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:44.160\nAll right, okay, whatever.\n\n01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:46.160\nLook, I eat stuff that you guys don't,\n\n01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:49.160\nlike some of your allies and other creatures.\n\n01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:50.160\nRight, right, okay.\n\n01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:53.160\nCan I finish what I started here?\n\n01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:56.160\nStick my finger in his heart.\n\n01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:59.160\nAll right, as he's being mauled by the bear,\n\n01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:02.160\nhe's pretty easy to hit with your steak fingers,\n\n01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:04.160\nand you steak him right in the chest.\n\n01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:05.160\nNice.\n\n01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:08.160\nAnd he explodes into dust around its skeleton.\n\n01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:09.160\nYeah.\n\n01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:10.160\nAh!\n\n01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:11.160\nYou did it!\n\n01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:14.160\nGarry Shandling, you did it.\n\n01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:18.160\nAw, I was quite wanted to eat him.\n\n01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:22.160\nCan I collect some of the dust and put it into my glass jar?\n\n01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:23.160\nYep, I do that.\n\n01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:26.160\nThat's probably a crafting ingredient.\n\n01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:27.160\nYou don't know.\n\n01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:28.160\nWhat?\n\n01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:29.160\nWhat?\n\n01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:31.160\nIt's probably a crafting ingredient.\n\n01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:32.160\nIt's a keepsake.\n\n01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:35.160\nIt's a vampire dust.\n\n01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:37.160\nWhat are you shaking your head to me?\n\n01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:39.160\nYou're made out of swamp leaves.\n\n01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:42.160\nHey, you know, you're made out of meat.\n\n01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:44.160\nOkay, is that a threat?\n\n01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:47.160\nI just want to collect some vampire dust.\n\n01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:52.160\nNothing says back to school like vampire dust.\n\n01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:53.160\nOkay, well...\n\n01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:54.160\nGuys, we did it.\n\n01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:55.160\nWe got Patchen's gem.\n\n01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:56.160\nWhere's Patchen's?\n\n01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:57.160\nDo we know this is Patchen's gem?\n\n01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:58.160\nWhat if it's just another...\n\n01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:01.160\nOf course it's Patchen's gem.\n\n01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:02.160\nHow long since it's been...\n\n01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:05.160\nI loot the...\n\n01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:07.160\nTo Boynkins' clothing.\n\n01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:10.160\nYou get 17 gold as well as a compass.\n\n01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:14.160\nI split it up evenly among the five of us.\n\n01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:15.160\nYou all get three gold.\n\n01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:19.160\nAll right, we need this gem put somewhere where it will not be waylaid.\n\n01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:21.160\nYou know, while they're doing that,\n\n01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:23.160\nI'm just going to...\n\n01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:25.160\nSpencer, while they're doing that,\n\n01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:28.160\nI'm just going to kind of wander out alone.\n\n01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:31.160\nI just need to be alone for a bit.\n\n01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:32.160\nAll right.\n\n01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:34.160\nGuys, let them go.\n\n01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:35.160\nJust let them go.\n\n01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:37.160\nHow long is the bear going to last?\n\n01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:39.160\nThat's not a summon bear, I don't think.\n\n01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:40.160\nI think it's the bear.\n\n01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:43.160\nI'm going to split with my share of the gold ASAP.\n\n01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:45.160\nBecause I keep thinking like the best place to hide a gem is...\n\n01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:46.160\nIn my ass.\n\n01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:47.160\nA bear's ass.\n\n01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:50.160\nLike, who's ever going to rob a...\n\n01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:54.160\nI walk away from all of this.\n\n01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:56.160\nYou know, they can argue about all that.\n\n01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.160\nAnd I'm just going to kind of just...\n\n01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:00.160\nI'll have you know I do shit in the woods.\n\n01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:02.160\nI follow Garry Shandling.\n\n01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:03.160\nI follow him.\n\n01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:04.160\nOkay.\n\n01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:05.160\nI don't know if he'd like that.\n\n01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:07.160\nWell, I don't expect him to.\n\n01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:08.160\nThere needs to be a transition.\n\n01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:09.160\nHey, Gary.\n\n01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:11.160\nI'm sitting on the road.\n\n01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:12.160\nGary.\n\n01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:15.160\nI'm just like kind of like looking at the dirt\n\n01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:18.160\nand playing with a rock that I found.\n\n01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:20.160\nAnd I'm just like...\n\n01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:22.160\nYeah, what?\n\n01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:24.160\nKilled...\n\n01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:27.160\nCouldn't have killed that vampire without you.\n\n01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:28.160\nThank you.\n\n01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:30.160\nYeah, I know.\n\n01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:33.160\nHelp us get Patchen's gem.\n\n01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:37.160\nIt's not fun anymore.\n\n01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:38.160\nCan you say anymore?\n\n01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:40.160\nBut this was your first adventure.\n\n01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:41.160\nI've been doing this a long time.\n\n01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:43.160\nIt gets worse than this.\n\n01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:45.160\nI just...\n\n01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:46.160\nI'm just like...\n\n01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:50.160\nI didn't let my dog out before I left the place.\n\n01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:52.160\nGary.\n\n01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:54.160\nI'm just starting to worry that\n\n01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:56.160\nthis is as good as it's going to get.\n\n01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:59.160\nI mean, I thought it would be more than this.\n\n01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:02.160\nAnd it's just like we're hurting people.\n\n01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:03.160\nI don't know.\n\n01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:05.160\nAre we the good guys?\n\n01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:07.160\nOr the bad guys?\n\n01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:08.160\nSometimes we're the bad guys.\n\n01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:11.160\nAnd it often coincides with us being disunited\n\n01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:13.160\nand confused about what we did last week.\n\n01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:16.160\nIt seems like we're always talking over each other.\n\n01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:19.160\nYeah, well, that's why we need the cure\n\n01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:24.160\nto this problem is commitment to a weekly schedule\n\n01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:30.160\nand people showing up and listening\n\n01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:32.160\nand give and take and all this stuff.\n\n01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:36.160\nAnd I know that it would be better with you, you know?\n\n01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:37.160\nAnd I want to invite you...\n\n01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:38.160\nI mean, I'm just like...\n\n01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:40.160\nThe bear is it, right?\n\n01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:41.160\nI mean, we're going to get another...\n\n01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:45.160\nThis bear is here to plug some fucking improv show he's doing.\n\n01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:47.160\nWe don't even know.\n\n01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:49.160\nThis bear is here today.\n\n01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:51.160\nMind if I just pop over?\n\n01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:52.160\nHi.\n\n01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:55.160\nI'm in the Sunday company at the Groundlings.\n\n01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:58.160\nIt's my last six months.\n\n01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:01.160\nSo if you could want to pop by.\n\n01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:06.160\nI've got flyers, but they're a little claw shredded.\n\n01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:10.160\nLook, I mean...\n\n01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:14.160\nKaren Mariamma is my teacher.\n\n01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:18.160\nOf course, we're going to come to your show.\n\n01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:22.160\nGreat, great, great.\n\n01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:23.160\nNow, there's a limit.\n\n01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:25.160\nI can only get three people.\n\n01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:26.160\nOh, okay.\n\n01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:35.160\nWell, I thought I saw Adele close over there by the bushes.\n\n01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:39.160\nAnyways, Gary, we'd love for you to continue\n\n01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:41.160\nto be a part of our gang.\n\n01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:44.160\nOkay, but...\n\n01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:52.160\nI'm up inside the farmhouse trying to loot the farmhouse.\n\n01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:53.160\nAll right, all right.\n\n01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:58.160\nWell, I could probably hang out for another day or two.\n\n01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:01.160\nBut if the bear stays, is it a deal breaker?\n\n01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:02.160\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:05.160\nI was like, I started, you know, like,\n\n01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:09.160\ncarving out like a niche and then all of a sudden\n\n01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:11.160\nlike all over...\n\n01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:13.160\nI don't know, it's whatever.\n\n01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:15.160\nI mean, it's just been rough, you know.\n\n01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:17.160\nLike, I'm just really tired.\n\n01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:18.160\nI need to...\n\n01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:19.160\nI should have...\n\n01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:20.160\nI missed...\n\n01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:21.160\nIt's fine.\n\n01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:22.160\nIt's fine.\n\n01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:23.160\nIt's a bunch of shit.\n\n01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:24.160\nDon't worry about it.\n\n01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:25.160\nDon't worry about it.\n\n01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:27.160\nYou mind if I offer just to say,\n\n01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:30.160\nif I'm passed on at the groundlings,\n\n01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:34.160\nI probably will have to go do that anyway.\n\n01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:36.160\nSo, I mean, for me to continue being here\n\n01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:38.160\nand bothering you, I would have to...\n\n01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:41.160\nNot pass the Sunday company ground.\n\n01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:43.160\nI just, you know, it's my stupid...\n\n01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:45.160\nI'm wandering around the front room with my flashlight\n\n01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:47.160\njust sort of like checking things out.\n\n01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:50.160\nI grabbed Charlotte the most adorable pig\n\n01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:53.160\nand I walk over to Gary and I'm like,\n\n01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:55.160\nlook at how
