{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:07.800\nFrom Hollywood, California, it is my pleasure and duty to announce that Harmontown is once\n\n00:07.800 --> 00:12.800\nagain in session.\n\n00:12.800 --> 00:23.800\nSpencer Crittenden did to the stage.\n\n00:23.800 --> 00:32.800\nHow's it going, buddy?\n\n00:32.800 --> 00:33.800\nI'm bad.\n\n00:33.800 --> 00:34.800\nAlright, well let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown.\n\n00:34.800 --> 00:35.800\nShall we, Mr. Dan Harmon?\n\n00:35.800 --> 00:36.800\nHello.\n\n00:36.800 --> 00:37.800\nThank you.\n\n00:37.800 --> 00:38.800\nThank you very much.\n\n00:38.800 --> 00:39.800\nSo you came here from LAX.\n\n00:39.800 --> 00:40.800\nI came here from LAX.\n\n00:40.800 --> 00:41.800\nBut where were you?\n\n00:41.800 --> 00:42.800\nI was in Las Vegas.\n\n00:42.800 --> 00:43.800\nWhat was going down on Las Vegas?\n\n00:43.800 --> 00:52.800\nChris McKenna's birthday.\n\n00:52.800 --> 01:01.800\nI'm an awful, awful gambler, which is good because that means I never will develop a\n\n01:01.800 --> 01:02.800\nproblem.\n\n01:02.800 --> 01:06.800\nI'm so bad at it that it's never fun.\n\n01:06.800 --> 01:14.800\nI just do that thing that, oh, I've lost three times in a row, so I'll bet six times\n\n01:14.800 --> 01:19.880\nas much, and then I'll break even, and I just keep doing that until $1,000 goes, which\n\n01:19.880 --> 01:23.800\nis five minutes later, and then I go get another $1,000, and then the ATM says, you\n\n01:23.800 --> 01:27.800\ncan't do that, and I go, okay, I'm done gambling.\n\n01:27.800 --> 01:28.800\nWhat's your game?\n\n01:28.800 --> 01:30.640\nI like Blackjack the most.\n\n01:30.640 --> 01:35.720\nIf I can control myself, as you know, you can sit there like, Blackjack, what you should\n\n01:35.720 --> 01:39.600\ndo is just fucking follow the rules, and then you're just drinking for free, sitting at\n\n01:39.600 --> 01:43.200\na table with some friends for maybe possibly hours and hours, and you're up, and you're\n\n01:43.200 --> 01:47.160\ndown, and you're up, and you're down, and if you say in your head, okay, I'm going\n\n01:47.160 --> 01:49.520\nto lose $500, maybe, let's say.\n\n01:49.520 --> 01:51.600\nBut the thing is, this was the Cosmopolitan hotel.\n\n01:51.600 --> 01:56.800\nIt was like $25 minimum tables, and it's just like, that's $25, that's a half of a video\n\n01:56.800 --> 01:57.800\ngame.\n\n01:57.800 --> 02:01.480\nI've heard from people there that that's not a great place to gamble.\n\n02:01.480 --> 02:06.040\nNobody has ever had a good story of gambling and winning and having fun there.\n\n02:06.040 --> 02:07.040\nYou have?\n\n02:07.040 --> 02:08.040\nYeah.\n\n02:08.040 --> 02:09.040\nYou enjoy the Cosmopolitan?\n\n02:09.040 --> 02:15.200\nI went and got $25 on the free card, and I spent it, and I won $100.\n\n02:15.200 --> 02:16.200\nDamn.\n\n02:16.200 --> 02:17.200\nAll right.\n\n02:17.200 --> 02:30.200\nWell, not to be outdone, I also won $25, because I got a triple Bazinga on the Big Bang\n\n02:30.200 --> 02:33.160\nthree-machine trip.\n\n02:33.160 --> 02:35.320\nThree Bazingas should be more than $25.\n\n02:35.320 --> 02:40.920\nI don't even watch that show, and I know a Bazinga is important.\n\n02:40.920 --> 02:45.720\nYou got three Bazingas, and all you got was $25?\n\n02:45.720 --> 02:46.720\nYeah.\n\n02:46.720 --> 02:47.720\nWhat was your coin?\n\n02:47.720 --> 02:51.680\nWell, I guess the guys that write, the slot machine, get home by $5, too.\n\n02:51.680 --> 02:54.760\nNow, still better.\n\n02:54.760 --> 02:55.920\nWhy were you playing this?\n\n02:55.920 --> 02:57.640\nYou were playing it ironically, I assume?\n\n02:57.640 --> 03:02.920\nWell, yeah, I guess I thought it would be hilarious if I hit a huge jackpot on the Big\n\n03:02.920 --> 03:07.920\nBang three-machine, but I also thought it would be funny if I lost $1,000.\n\n03:07.920 --> 03:12.560\nIn either case, I knew I was going to tweet Bill Prady, my friend who runs, I think is\n\n03:12.560 --> 03:16.200\nstill running it, and I don't know.\n\n03:16.200 --> 03:21.520\nIt's fun to have friends that are so successful that you can openly hate them.\n\n03:21.520 --> 03:24.840\nThey're just going, hey, Big Bang three, suck my dick.\n\n03:24.840 --> 03:25.840\nYou guys suck.\n\n03:25.840 --> 03:30.160\nThey're like, we don't care, we're snorting diamonds.\n\n03:30.160 --> 03:33.800\nYou can say whatever you want.\n\n03:33.800 --> 03:37.040\nThere is a place, I was in Death Valley over Thanksgiving.\n\n03:37.040 --> 03:43.160\nThere is a gas station slash mini-mart, actually quite a sizable establishment, and it is\n\n03:43.160 --> 03:53.360\ncalled Eddie World, and the logo is a photograph of a child that I am told is the deceased\n\n03:53.360 --> 04:00.240\nchild of the owners, after which they named the mini-mart, and it's really weird.\n\n04:00.240 --> 04:02.680\nAnd that's it.\n\n04:02.680 --> 04:03.880\nI spent a lot of time.\n\n04:03.880 --> 04:06.880\nIt is called Death Valley.\n\n04:06.880 --> 04:10.640\nI spent a lot of time, I don't know, I was really high and Cody was laughing, so I started\n\n04:10.640 --> 04:14.080\nrecording it because I didn't want to, because I knew if I tried to do it here, she'd be\n\n04:14.080 --> 04:18.840\nlike, why are you doing jokes about a dead kid?\n\n04:18.840 --> 04:21.120\nBecause they're hilarious.\n\n04:21.120 --> 04:29.640\nBut I did like, I'll just, I'll see if, let's see, because I started, I was coming up with\n\n04:29.640 --> 04:52.000\njingles kind of trying, oh wait, there's a world where you don't have a sandwich in a\n\n04:52.000 --> 05:00.800\nroom, where we don't have everything, because we lost the most important thing in our lives.\n\n05:00.800 --> 05:04.600\nEddie World, do you need milk or glasses?\n\n05:04.600 --> 05:13.280\nEddie World, our son can't come back, Eddie World, just come and get some candy, Eddie\n\n05:13.280 --> 05:21.160\nWorld, our whole will never be quite filled, but you take candy.\n\n05:21.160 --> 05:30.240\nI think there's something, it goes on for seven more minutes, and now you're applauding\n\n05:30.240 --> 05:37.920\na child's death, but everybody out there voted for Trump, so I'm sure Eddie did too, or he\n\n05:37.920 --> 05:38.920\nwould've, he would've.\n\n05:38.920 --> 05:46.200\nMan, speaking of child death, I was driving through a cemetery and the cemetery had all\n\n05:46.200 --> 05:52.920\nthese weird street names that were all kind of noble and gravity, like heavy, it was like\n\n05:52.920 --> 05:58.640\nnoble spraying and golden dawn and stuff, and I found myself on a street that was called\n\n05:58.640 --> 06:06.960\nBabyland, and that's a terrifying realization to have when you're really high in a cemetery\n\n06:06.960 --> 06:14.880\ndriving around, and right at the head of Babyland was this giant statue of a baby that was kind\n\n06:14.880 --> 06:19.680\nof like, yeah, it was clearly, it was like, nope, there's definitely babies buried on\n\n06:19.680 --> 06:26.320\nthis property, and then I left, it was great.\n\n06:26.320 --> 06:33.000\nBabyland, I think a lot of cemeteries have a Babyland too, I don't think that's unique.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:36.080\nBabyland's a terrible name though, like.\n\n06:36.080 --> 06:42.080\nOn the lighter side of child development, my, I guess you'd call him my pseudo nephew\n\n06:42.080 --> 06:47.360\nbecause I'm dating his aunt, Ryland, who maybe, if you follow my Instagram, maybe you've\n\n06:47.360 --> 06:52.680\nseen him, the president of Train Town Kid, he's four years old, and he was learning\n\n06:52.680 --> 06:57.880\nto drive on his grandpa's lap, like in Death Valley, like his grandpa was just steering\n\n06:57.880 --> 07:07.800\nwith the hands on the bottom, but he was like thinking he was driving, and asked him, asked\n\n07:07.800 --> 07:11.080\nhim after he finished, after he finally got tired of driving, which was an exhilarating\n\n07:11.080 --> 07:16.120\nexperience for him, he said, Ryland, how do you feel, and he said, I feel like I'm five\n\n07:16.120 --> 07:17.120\nyears old.\n\n07:17.120 --> 07:23.320\nIt's just pretty amazing, because he wasn't being glib or ironic, he really, he didn't\n\n07:23.320 --> 07:27.680\nknow how funny that was, he really was like, that's how to express, he's like, in his\n\n07:27.680 --> 07:32.960\nfour-year-old mind, like being five is going to have more energy to it.\n\n07:32.960 --> 07:38.880\nI guess he's right, I guess it's not until you turn like 13 that you start dying, right?\n\n07:38.880 --> 07:47.920\nAs soon as you can reach the faucet, like it's all downhill, yeah, well it's the reproductive\n\n07:47.920 --> 07:51.640\nhormones probably hit your bloodstream, and then they start killing your body, right?\n\n07:51.640 --> 07:55.320\nBecause it's like, we're like mosquitoes, like nature's saying, okay, time to make more\n\n07:55.320 --> 08:02.880\nof you, or what good are you, and also if you can do that, bye, yeah, well, nobody's\n\n08:02.880 --> 08:08.400\ngetting out alive, I don't know why you're so quiet.\n\n08:08.400 --> 08:09.400\nDid you enjoy your Death Valley experience?\n\n08:09.400 --> 08:10.400\nIt looked like you had a lot of fun.\n\n08:10.400 --> 08:18.280\nWhen you laughed at Eddie's death, you had to have a chuckle at your own, wouldn't be\n\n08:18.280 --> 08:24.320\na bad idea, karmically, I think, yeah, speaking of death, I mean, like I said, everybody out\n\n08:24.320 --> 08:30.240\nthere voted for Trump, and like, it's funny because as a liberal, you're out there, like,\n\n08:30.240 --> 08:34.920\nwhen I got to Death Valley, I was like, oh god, this is where I need to come now that\n\n08:34.920 --> 08:37.960\nTrump got elected, but the place is filled with a bunch of people that are like, oh,\n\n08:37.960 --> 08:41.160\nthis is where I need to be now that Obama got elected, like, they're just walking around\n\n08:41.160 --> 08:45.560\nwith guns on their hips, and like, they've created their own little world, and like,\n\n08:45.560 --> 08:52.520\neverybody's from somewhere else, nobody, nothing is born in Death Valley, and they tried with\n\n08:52.520 --> 09:07.240\nEddie, and he just like, yeah, the warning is in the name of the town, you don't do it.\n\n09:07.240 --> 09:09.480\nDid you know it's the hottest place on earth?\n\n09:09.480 --> 09:12.720\nYou would think it's somewhere in Africa, or the Middle East, or something like, or\n\n09:12.720 --> 09:18.280\nthe equator, like, it's the hottest goddamn place on earth, recorded anyway, 135 degrees,\n\n09:18.280 --> 09:24.760\nand every, the hottest day of the year, people gather and watch the temperature needle, passing\n\n09:24.760 --> 09:32.480\nout from heat stroke, and they all wait to celebrate the, if it gets up to 136, or whatever\n\n09:32.480 --> 09:33.480\nit is.\n\n09:33.480 --> 09:35.000\nDid you get that hot in Saudi Arabia, or like?\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:39.760\nYeah, I would have thought, I would have thought, but apparently, they used to think not as,\n\n09:39.760 --> 09:45.040\nthat yes, that is the case, but then there was some kind of thermometer recalibration,\n\n09:45.040 --> 09:50.960\nor something, like they were using bad thermo, they were using Chinese steel in their thermometers,\n\n09:50.960 --> 09:52.800\nover in Saudi Arabia.\n\n09:52.800 --> 09:56.520\nChinese steel is the cologne I'm wearing right now.\n\n09:56.520 --> 10:11.080\nEddie World, we've got everything, but Eddie!\n\n10:11.080 --> 10:16.080\nEddie World, if we haven't got it, it's our son!\n\n10:16.080 --> 10:27.080\nEddie World, our prices aren't just low, they're misdirected grief!\n\n10:27.080 --> 10:30.160\nDo you know, are these all written down?\n\n10:30.160 --> 10:31.160\nWhat?\n\n10:31.160 --> 10:32.160\nAre you riffing these?\n\n10:32.160 --> 10:33.160\nAre these all written down?\n\n10:33.160 --> 10:38.040\nI saw, I saw, I opened my notepad, I saw a couple of them.\n\n10:38.040 --> 10:42.080\nI'm terribly sorry, if I'm by, for some reason, there's somebody listening that is connected\n\n10:42.080 --> 10:46.280\nsomehow to Eddie, and you're being traumatized by this, I'm operating under the assumption\n\n10:46.280 --> 10:51.560\nthat that's not the case, and therefore, you know, where you are as a figure in a textbook\n\n10:51.560 --> 10:56.800\nto us, like Abraham Lincoln, whose assassination is no longer tragic, it's hilarious, he got\n\n10:56.800 --> 11:02.080\nshot in the head, brains flew everywhere, Kennedy slightly less so, and you know, time\n\n11:02.080 --> 11:03.080\ngoes on.\n\n11:03.080 --> 11:08.560\nEddie, from his picture, looked like, it probably happened a while ago, and it could be an urban\n\n11:08.560 --> 11:09.560\nlegend.\n\n11:09.560 --> 11:16.480\nBut when you look at it, you go, I bet that's, you kind of, it could be like, unconfirmable.\n\n11:16.480 --> 11:17.480\nAnyways.\n\n11:17.480 --> 11:22.800\nCan't you ask the owners?\n\n11:22.800 --> 11:23.800\nWho's gonna do that?\n\n11:23.800 --> 11:28.760\nI mean, like, I'm not gonna do that, plus the place is so big, like, the owners aren't\n\n11:28.760 --> 11:34.360\neven there, I mean, it was like, they had a lot of candy.\n\n11:34.360 --> 11:36.440\nI bought a lot of candy.\n\n11:36.440 --> 11:40.720\nWe love candy.\n\n11:40.720 --> 11:50.000\nSince we're there, like, scraping the bottom of taste, like, there was this fire in Oakland,\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:55.600\nthis terrible tragedy, this warehouse thing, and did anybody see the video, I mean, some\n\n11:55.600 --> 12:00.520\npeople out here might be connected to people, I know Cody had a friend who lost two friends\n\n12:00.520 --> 12:03.160\nin that fire.\n\n12:03.160 --> 12:12.600\nThere was a video of a guy who was describing, like, trying to drag his friend out, who had\n\n12:12.600 --> 12:20.400\nbroken his ankle, and he was trying to drag his friend out of this inferno, and he's explaining\n\n12:20.400 --> 12:25.200\nto the news cameras, you know, I thought, I was like, oh my god, this guy's so brave\n\n12:25.200 --> 12:29.960\nand vulnerable, like, you know, who would, I mean, because he's describing the experience\n\n12:29.960 --> 12:35.520\nof trying to save his friend, and then it gets so hot, and his lungs are filling with\n\n12:35.520 --> 12:40.920\nsmoke, and he had no choice but to just let go, and just walk away, like, run away, get\n\n12:40.920 --> 12:47.200\nout of there, and he couldn't drag his friend out, had to leave him there, but the guy's\n\n12:47.200 --> 12:53.840\ndescribing it, and he describes it, and then he goes, like, you know, obviously that's\n\n12:53.840 --> 12:59.440\nmaking him, like, tear up, and like, like, he's still out there, and then he, but then\n\n12:59.440 --> 13:06.080\nhe says, and then I went out, and then I watched it all, all burn, all my stuff, all my, all\n\n13:06.080 --> 13:10.880\nmy, all my, and he just started talking about all the things that he had in there, anyways.\n\n13:10.880 --> 13:17.880\nI just thought it was such a weird build, like, it was, like, the story about the friend,\n\n13:17.880 --> 13:22.320\nand then he was just like, he's like, my pants are in there.\n\n13:22.320 --> 13:26.160\nI know nothing about this, I've been in Mexico for almost a week, I haven't watched any news\n\n13:26.160 --> 13:27.160\nat all, so.\n\n13:27.160 --> 13:32.840\nYeah, yeah, yeah, how are you feeling, we should, we should, we might want to take up\n\n13:32.840 --> 13:38.600\nthis regiment, like, like, are you feeling great, I feel great, man, Mexico City is\n\n13:38.600 --> 13:42.800\nthe most goddamn fun city, if you haven't been there, really go down to Mexico City\n\n13:42.800 --> 13:46.720\nand chill out, the people are cool, they're laid back, the food is fucking screaming,\n\n13:46.720 --> 13:50.720\nthey love music, the architecture is wild, there's, there's dogs everywhere, there's\n\n13:50.720 --> 13:57.160\ndogs everywhere, and, and the thing is, I never once heard a dog bark, no, I heard one\n\n13:57.160 --> 14:00.520\ndog bark when we were in like, oh, well yeah, but you know they were barking in Spanish,\n\n14:00.520 --> 14:05.040\nso you probably didn't recognize it, don't, don't, don't they, you know, in, in French\n\n14:05.040 --> 14:09.600\nclass, like, we always had, you had to learn how all the animals, like, vow, vow, yeah,\n\n14:09.600 --> 14:19.800\nvow, vow, yeah, but the dogs, there's a park, park in Mexico, like, there's a big park in\n\n14:19.800 --> 14:24.560\nthe, like, in the Condesa area, and there's a million dogs, dog walkers have, like, 40\n\n14:24.560 --> 14:29.000\ndogs on one leader, like, it's amazing, and all the dogs are just chilled out, having\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:32.720\na good time, no one's, they're not jumping and barking and biting and scratching, they're\n\n14:32.720 --> 14:37.240\njust, just the happiest, most well-socialized dogs in the world, it's really great, and\n\n14:37.240 --> 14:44.960\nthen there's one place called, uh, Sochi, chocolate milk, so, so, so, so, so, so, sochimil,\n\n14:44.960 --> 14:51.360\nI don't know what the fuck, uh, there's canals, there's fucking wild, and there's an island\n\n14:51.360 --> 14:56.200\nof the dolls, people just took baby dolls and nailed them to trees, and it's the fucking\n\n14:56.200 --> 15:02.800\ncreepiest ass shit, so there's just, there's just a whole island of dolls nailed to things,\n\n15:02.800 --> 15:05.800\nand there's just feral chihuahuas running around everywhere, it's fucking grand.\n\n15:05.800 --> 15:11.120\nIs it possible that Mexico has affected your reactions to things, like, you're, you're\n\n15:11.120 --> 15:15.440\ndescribing things that should make you upset, yeah, it was, but you're on a boat, you're\n\n15:15.440 --> 15:20.440\non these big colorful barges and these canals, and, and then there's food, it's like, rows\n\n15:20.440 --> 15:24.560\nup next to you, and there's just a guy selling tamales, there's a woman selling fruit, and\n\n15:24.560 --> 15:28.560\nthere's enchiladas, and then there's a bunch of bands, there's like, there's like a thousand\n\n15:28.560 --> 15:33.000\nbands out there, so we hired a mariachi band that came on board our boat, and we're all\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:36.760\njust singing along, and it was the god, it was the fucking greatest day of my life.\n\n15:36.760 --> 15:42.360\nAlright, well, what's your favorite TV show right now, what are you watching the most?\n\n15:42.360 --> 15:43.760\nUh, probably Westworld.\n\n15:43.760 --> 15:44.760\nAlright.\n\n15:44.760 --> 15:45.760\nWoohoo!\n\n15:45.760 --> 15:50.080\nWell, the, the finale's tonight, but I, I'm, I'm back, I, I'm, I don't think I've seen\n\n15:50.080 --> 15:52.160\ntwo episodes back, so no spoilers.\n\n15:52.160 --> 15:54.160\nYeah, well, okay, no spoilers.\n\n15:54.160 --> 15:57.480\nDon't say your, your groans are spoilers.\n\n15:57.480 --> 16:00.920\nEverybody promise, we'll, we'll just not talk about Westworld at all tonight, uh, please\n\n16:00.920 --> 16:02.760\nwelcome our first guest, Tolemy,\n\n16:02.760 --> 16:03.760\nSlocum.\n\n16:03.760 --> 16:04.760\nSlocum from Westworld.\n\n16:04.760 --> 16:06.760\nSylvester the tech guy from Westworld.\n\n16:06.760 --> 16:19.760\nHe's the nerd that you tried to kill, but you can't kill a nerd like Sylvester.\n\n16:19.760 --> 16:22.760\nThat's so easy.\n\n16:22.760 --> 16:25.760\nHi everybody.\n\n16:25.760 --> 16:31.440\nProbably, uh, uh, second to the British writer character, the least liked character.\n\n16:31.440 --> 16:33.280\nSo far, so I've noticed.\n\n16:33.280 --> 16:38.920\nI do, I do feel like I'm, I am slightly more, uh, palpable than he, I probably, I shouldn't\n\n16:38.920 --> 16:39.920\nstart with that.\n\n16:39.920 --> 16:46.520\nUm, yeah, at least to my wife, uh, my wife likes me slightly better than him.\n\n16:46.520 --> 16:51.200\nWell, how did you, uh, everybody, everybody's, I mean, this is probably the, this is the\n\n16:51.200 --> 16:55.520\nshow that everybody's watching, at least in LA, like, uh, and so you're, like, this\n\n16:55.520 --> 17:00.280\nis brand new, like we had a, we had, we had Grey Worm from Game of Thrones on it, I, I,\n\n17:00.280 --> 17:04.520\nI, and, and I was on a yacht with Game of Thrones people and all I can think to ask them\n\n17:04.520 --> 17:06.680\nis what does it feel like to be playing this thing?\n\n17:06.680 --> 17:10.280\nBut the answer is never satisfying, but why don't you take a shot at it?\n\n17:10.280 --> 17:11.280\nAll right.\n\n17:11.280 --> 17:18.160\nThat's a great lead in, um, yeah, it is interesting, um, about six weeks ago, I was standing back\n\n17:18.160 --> 17:19.160\nwhere those guys are.\n\n17:19.160 --> 17:21.360\nI see you by the bathroom cause I had to walk past you.\n\n17:21.360 --> 17:29.280\nUm, and so this is like, you know, six weeks later, my life is about, uh, like what, 30\n\n17:29.280 --> 17:31.080\nyards different, you know?\n\n17:31.080 --> 17:35.960\nBut it's a big 30 yards and it feels, you mean, you, you, you, by, you were standing\n\n17:35.960 --> 17:39.800\nback there, you mean you were just some regular Joe watching the show?\n\n17:39.800 --> 17:40.800\nYeah.\n\n17:40.800 --> 17:44.360\nAnd now you're up here with like, in the limelight, right?\n\n17:44.360 --> 17:45.360\nYes.\n\n17:45.360 --> 17:49.600\nBut also you're on Westworld, which is more important.\n\n17:49.600 --> 17:50.600\nYeah.\n\n17:50.600 --> 17:56.640\nLike, like, you're, you're measuring, uh, the, uh, what it's like to go from not being\n\n17:56.640 --> 18:01.200\non Westworld to being on Westworld by, by you're using the yardstick you're using as\n\n18:01.200 --> 18:03.640\nmy shitty show.\n\n18:03.640 --> 18:10.240\nI feel like that's what, I thought that was your setup, um, for like, what is, how is\n\n18:10.240 --> 18:13.960\nlife different for, for you in terms of like being on the show?\n\n18:13.960 --> 18:16.960\nBut, uh, if you want to talk about the experience of shooting that show, it was fascinating.\n\n18:16.960 --> 18:20.200\nWell, I want to tell you, that was like two years of fascinating because it took two years\n\n18:20.200 --> 18:21.520\nto shoot one season.\n\n18:21.520 --> 18:22.520\nRight.\n\n18:22.520 --> 18:23.520\nThere's a question right there.\n\n18:23.520 --> 18:28.040\nSo, so, so we have to go back all the way two years ago to what I think what, what a\n\n18:28.040 --> 18:32.280\nlot of us would like to hear is like you going from being a guy who has not been cast on\n\n18:32.280 --> 18:37.480\nWestworld to like, like, like what's the, cause there's got to be some little breathtaking\n\n18:37.480 --> 18:39.320\nbanana peel stoplight.\n\n18:39.320 --> 18:42.640\nIf this had happened differently story about you getting the role, right?\n\n18:42.640 --> 18:47.520\nI mean, yeah, you're looking at, you're looking at that moment, the fact that I'm even here\n\n18:47.520 --> 18:51.880\nat all because we just as actors attempt to do that constantly.\n\n18:51.880 --> 18:59.480\nSo this was very normal audition, one audition, no callback, walked into the room.\n\n18:59.480 --> 19:04.040\nI don't think they had even done an audition for this guy, Sylvester.\n\n19:04.040 --> 19:05.560\nNo one understood the script.\n\n19:05.560 --> 19:10.520\nIt was weird comments about like MSRA and like this abdomen, like what the fuck are they\n\n19:10.520 --> 19:11.720\ntalking about?\n\n19:11.720 --> 19:13.440\nThey didn't even know how to run the audition.\n\n19:13.440 --> 19:17.600\nI was in there was like, I think when I was reading it, it was like, maybe this guy's\n\n19:17.600 --> 19:20.960\nlike has his hands inside someone.\n\n19:20.960 --> 19:25.160\nAnd so I don't even think they had ever done one of those, never did a callback, didn't\n\n19:25.160 --> 19:27.200\nknow that much about the show.\n\n19:27.200 --> 19:28.720\nAnd I was just trying to get a job.\n\n19:28.720 --> 19:33.760\nAnd what was your relationship with the property where you, were you a fan of the movie?\n\n19:33.760 --> 19:34.760\nI knew the movie.\n\n19:34.760 --> 19:36.240\nI have, I still haven't seen the second.\n\n19:36.240 --> 19:37.960\nI really want to see the sequel.\n\n19:37.960 --> 19:38.960\nFuture world.\n\n19:38.960 --> 19:39.960\nYeah.\n\n19:39.960 --> 19:40.960\nAny thoughts?\n\n19:40.960 --> 19:44.080\nFuture world is even more seventies than Westworld.\n\n19:44.080 --> 19:45.080\nYeah.\n\n19:45.080 --> 19:47.640\nLike the seventies had third act problems.\n\n19:47.640 --> 19:48.640\nYes.\n\n19:48.640 --> 19:55.680\nUntil, until JAWS at which point, all movies stopped having third act problems, but began\n\n19:55.680 --> 19:59.960\nto have the unified third act problem of all ripping off JAWS for, you know, it's like,\n\n19:59.960 --> 20:01.800\nlike we all learned how to end a movie.\n\n20:01.800 --> 20:02.800\nRight.\n\n20:02.800 --> 20:05.840\nBut then it was like a shackle, like that was, because it was successful, it's almost everything\n\n20:05.840 --> 20:06.840\nhas to repeat that.\n\n20:06.840 --> 20:07.840\nYeah.\n\n20:07.840 --> 20:08.840\nNow there's such a thing.\n\n20:08.840 --> 20:09.840\nIt's almost as bad as when that law wasn't there.\n\n20:09.840 --> 20:13.320\nEvery movie, after JAWS, every movie ends with a blown up shark.\n\n20:13.320 --> 20:14.320\nYes.\n\n20:14.320 --> 20:15.320\nYeah.\n\n20:15.320 --> 20:16.320\nI mean, essentially.\n\n20:16.320 --> 20:17.320\nI mean, or a safe cat.\n\n20:17.320 --> 20:21.480\nLike the shark industry in Hollywood and those people have JAWS.\n\n20:21.480 --> 20:25.560\nBecause before that, the seventies was like, like, like, you know, you were watching a\n\n20:25.560 --> 20:29.000\nmovie and it was like, oh, Gene Hackman might just run off screen and there's a gunshot\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:30.000\nand a cat meows.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:31.480\nAnd you're like, what the fuck just happened?\n\n20:31.480 --> 20:32.480\nYeah.\n\n20:32.480 --> 20:33.480\nThey didn't have any rules like that.\n\n20:33.480 --> 20:34.720\nAnd then Westworld is a great example.\n\n20:34.720 --> 20:37.520\nI love the setup of Westworld.\n\n20:37.520 --> 20:42.040\nIt starts at that airport, if you remember, and they, they, it's a really cool setup,\n\n20:42.040 --> 20:43.960\nvery elegant, very efficient.\n\n20:43.960 --> 20:48.360\nAnd then starting in, like, basically the third act, they didn't, they didn't attempt\n\n20:48.360 --> 20:49.360\nanything.\n\n20:49.360 --> 20:50.360\nThey didn't have any plan.\n\n20:50.360 --> 20:51.360\nRight.\n\n20:51.360 --> 20:52.360\nIt was just, this guy starts running.\n\n20:52.360 --> 20:53.360\nRight.\n\n20:53.360 --> 20:54.360\nHe never stops.\n\n20:54.360 --> 20:55.360\nOkay.\n\n20:55.360 --> 20:56.360\nAnd it's just one long chase scene.\n\n20:56.360 --> 20:57.360\nIt's like, what happened?\n\n20:57.360 --> 20:58.360\nYeah.\n\n20:58.360 --> 20:59.360\nBut it's, that, they could do that.\n\n20:59.360 --> 21:01.120\nAnd I actually kind of prefer it.\n\n21:01.120 --> 21:04.920\nI mean, I guess because it's like, like, what, yeah, how should, because the thing that,\n\n21:04.920 --> 21:09.600\nthat, that you have to gain from a, from an era where nobody really knows how to end\n\n21:09.600 --> 21:13.800\na movie is that every once in a while, I mean, you, you're sitting there.\n\n21:13.800 --> 21:18.080\nYou, you're on the edge of your seat, like, because you don't know, you're in the hands\n\n21:18.080 --> 21:19.080\nof a lunatic.\n\n21:19.080 --> 21:20.080\nRight.\n\n21:20.080 --> 21:22.920\nYou're like, I don't know, like, like, like, he could just like, like, like, easy rider\n\n21:22.920 --> 21:29.240\njust ends with fucking, just like, get your motor running, hey.\n\n21:29.240 --> 21:30.880\nAnd then it just like credits.\n\n21:30.880 --> 21:31.880\nYeah.\n\n21:31.880 --> 21:37.880\nEven at the cemetery scene in, in Easy Rider, like, should I have gone on this ride with\n\n21:37.880 --> 21:38.880\nthem?\n\n21:38.880 --> 21:39.880\nYeah.\n\n21:39.880 --> 21:40.880\nAre you, are you, yeah.\n\n21:40.880 --> 21:41.880\nDid you break the movie?\n\n21:41.880 --> 21:42.880\nYeah.\n\n21:42.880 --> 21:46.240\nI think that that is waiting for you at the end of this film is pretty exciting.\n\n21:46.240 --> 21:47.240\nYeah.\n\n21:47.240 --> 21:48.240\nAnd that's kind of wrong.\n\n21:48.240 --> 21:50.200\nBecause that makes you care about the characters, because if you were in real life, we're running\n\n21:50.200 --> 21:55.000\nfrom Yule Brenner, who was programmed to kill you, or rather programmed to not kill you\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:57.560\nand had decided to not be programmed that way anymore.\n\n21:57.560 --> 21:58.560\nRight.\n\n21:58.560 --> 22:05.120\nLike, if you were having that experience, you should feel unlike the way you feel when\n\n22:05.120 --> 22:06.120\nyou're watching Jaws.\n\n22:06.120 --> 22:07.640\nYou should feel like, what the fuck is happening?\n\n22:07.640 --> 22:08.640\nYeah.\n\n22:08.640 --> 22:09.640\nHow do I get out of this?\n\n22:09.640 --> 22:10.640\nCan I just play dead?\n\n22:10.640 --> 22:15.080\nThe other thing about the 70s movies is like, I watched, I watched the Westworld movie in\n\n22:15.080 --> 22:17.800\npreparation for the series, and then I also watched Logan's Run.\n\n22:17.800 --> 22:25.120\nAnd it's like, it's amazing how, it's amazing how flimsy the, the evil is, like, how easy\n\n22:25.120 --> 22:26.120\nit is to take down.\n\n22:26.120 --> 22:30.120\nAnd Logan's Run, he comes back from the lack of sanctuary.\n\n22:30.120 --> 22:35.520\nThe computer that runs all of dystopian life asks him, where's sanctuary?\n\n22:35.520 --> 22:36.720\nHe says there isn't one.\n\n22:36.720 --> 22:37.720\nIt says bullshit.\n\n22:37.720 --> 22:38.720\nI'm going to read your mind.\n\n22:38.720 --> 22:40.440\nAnd his mind says there's no sanctuary.\n\n22:40.440 --> 22:47.160\nAnd the computer explodes, and with it, and the shopping mall they live in starts falling\n\n22:47.160 --> 22:51.760\napart, and all of the people in pantyhose have to run out, and they see an old man\n\n22:51.760 --> 22:56.320\nand touch his beard, and it's over.\n\n22:56.320 --> 23:02.560\nBecause it's like, it was that easy back then to, to, to foil a, an oligarchic technocratic\n\n23:02.560 --> 23:03.560\nhydra.\n\n23:03.560 --> 23:04.560\nYeah.\n\n23:04.560 --> 23:07.600\nSo, so going back to this show.\n\n23:07.600 --> 23:12.920\nNo, um, because I did realize I might have, uh, so you did this audition, which it sounds\n\n23:12.920 --> 23:14.880\nlike it was in a casting director's office.\n\n23:14.880 --> 23:15.880\nYeah.\n\n23:15.880 --> 23:17.480\nUh, and you, you booked it off of one read?\n\n23:17.480 --> 23:18.480\nThat was it?\n\n23:18.480 --> 23:19.480\nOne read?\n\n23:19.480 --> 23:20.480\nNo, call back.\n\n23:20.480 --> 23:21.480\nNo idea about anything.\n\n23:21.480 --> 23:22.480\nHired.\n\n23:22.480 --> 23:23.480\nFucking death.\n\n23:23.480 --> 23:24.480\nJust hired.\n\n23:24.480 --> 23:25.480\nThat's the best.\n\n23:25.480 --> 23:29.200\nClearly, and I'm used to this, not, not going to go anywhere or be anything.\n\n23:29.200 --> 23:30.760\nThat was just my mentality.\n\n23:30.760 --> 23:34.920\nAnd it was like, it was basically like four lines in a pilot.\n\n23:34.920 --> 23:38.720\nAnd I did know that people were in it, but I didn't, I didn't, I just didn't know what\n\n23:38.720 --> 23:39.720\nto expect.\n\n23:39.720 --> 23:40.720\nI'm so cool though.\n\n23:40.720 --> 23:44.920\nHow much of your day when you're on the set for you is spent, uh, looking at naked actors\n\n23:44.920 --> 23:45.920\nin a chair?\n\n23:45.920 --> 23:46.920\nYeah.\n\n23:46.920 --> 23:48.920\nThey're, they're, they're everywhere.\n\n23:48.920 --> 23:49.920\nYeah.\n\n23:49.920 --> 23:53.320\nLike all, cause they are all not just the chairs, everyone laying down unless they have their\n\n23:53.320 --> 23:55.400\nlegs cut off is a real person.\n\n23:55.400 --> 23:56.400\nReally?\n\n23:56.400 --> 23:59.120\nSo they're all like fully naked with, with scars.\n\n23:59.120 --> 24:06.200\nIt is a real fascinating emotional cocktail to see an attractive naked person that is\n\n24:06.200 --> 24:11.080\ngashed open because you're like, want to help them and also aroused by it.\n\n24:11.080 --> 24:17.480\nIt's like very, it's difficult.\n\n24:17.480 --> 24:22.120\nThis segment brought to you by Eddie world.\n\n24:22.120 --> 24:27.360\nEddie world where the customer probably has a child.\n\n24:27.360 --> 24:32.920\nEddie world my glasses on and it's real offensive to me how hard it is to tell a male from a\n\n24:32.920 --> 24:35.640\nfemale laying down like 10 feet away.\n\n24:35.640 --> 24:43.240\nIf your glasses are not on, I was, I was offended by once they like sat, I was like, no.\n\n24:43.240 --> 24:47.680\nI think we're offended by your adherence to a binary, uh, heteronormative.\n\n24:47.680 --> 24:48.680\nOkay.\n\n24:48.680 --> 24:52.480\nDon't want to cash in on that one.\n\n24:52.480 --> 24:54.480\nAll right.\n\n24:54.480 --> 24:57.360\nUm, the, uh, the, uh, God damn it.\n\n24:57.360 --> 24:58.360\nThe shit.\n\n24:58.360 --> 24:59.360\nOh, oh, okay.\n\n24:59.360 --> 25:00.360\nCome on.\n\n25:00.360 --> 25:01.360\nTell the truth.\n\n25:01.360 --> 25:04.360\nUh, some of that, some of that shits from Game of Thrones sets like, like, like, like,\n\n25:04.360 --> 25:05.360\nI don't know.\n\n25:05.360 --> 25:08.840\nThere was like sets in there where I'm like, come on, that's, Cody was really the one\n\n25:08.840 --> 25:09.840\nthat pointed out.\n\n25:09.840 --> 25:10.840\nShe's like, come on.\n\n25:10.840 --> 25:11.840\nThat's a Game of Thrones set.\n\n25:11.840 --> 25:12.840\nLike, they're taking like curtains and stuff.\n\n25:12.840 --> 25:16.440\nAnd then the heads and the, on the wall, like, like, like, there is a, there's no, it doesn't\n\n25:16.440 --> 25:17.440\nlook like that.\n\n25:17.440 --> 25:18.440\nNo.\n\n25:18.440 --> 25:19.440\nBut HBO wouldn't have those laying around.\n\n25:19.440 --> 25:20.440\nThat's not how it works.\n\n25:20.440 --> 25:21.440\nNo, that's all in England.\n\n25:21.440 --> 25:22.440\nI think those sets are.\n\n25:22.440 --> 25:27.360\nThis is all up in, um, about 30 minutes north of here, kind of parallel to where, um, Six\n\n25:27.360 --> 25:32.960\nFlags is, but they did, they, they do have old, um, like tanks laying around from other\n\n25:32.960 --> 25:38.640\nproductions and some, um, like original Mad Maxi kind of little cars that were like welded\n\n25:38.640 --> 25:41.680\non a, on one of those like motorcycles, like old stuff.\n\n25:41.680 --> 25:45.680\nSo there is stuff laying around, but all that, I don't think they duplicated anything.\n\n25:45.680 --> 25:47.800\nSo do you have viewing parties?\n\n25:47.800 --> 25:48.800\nNo.\n\n25:48.800 --> 25:50.800\nAre you married or are you in a relationship?\n\n25:50.800 --> 25:51.800\nI'm married.\n\n25:51.800 --> 25:52.800\nYeah.\n\n25:52.800 --> 25:54.640\nTo a, to, to, uh, what gender person?\n\n25:54.640 --> 25:55.640\nTo a wife.\n\n25:55.640 --> 25:56.640\nYeah.\n\n25:56.640 --> 25:58.440\nUh, I'm married to a wife.\n\n25:58.440 --> 25:59.440\nA lady wife?\n\n25:59.440 --> 26:00.440\nA lady wife.\n\n26:00.440 --> 26:01.440\nIt is.\n\n26:01.440 --> 26:02.440\nUh, from 10 feet away.\n\n26:02.440 --> 26:03.440\nYou don't know.\n\n26:03.440 --> 26:04.440\nUm, yeah.\n\n26:04.440 --> 26:05.440\nDo you know?\n\n26:05.440 --> 26:06.440\nDid you know?\n\n26:06.440 --> 26:07.440\nI know.\n\n26:07.440 --> 26:08.440\nI know who she is.\n\n26:08.440 --> 26:11.880\nI saw your wife laying on a, on a, on a metal slab and I thought, I really couldn't tell\n\n26:11.880 --> 26:13.280\nif she was a dude or not.\n\n26:13.280 --> 26:16.200\nIs she, uh, what is she?\n\n26:16.200 --> 26:17.200\nIs she, is she.\n\n26:17.200 --> 26:18.760\nI'm not going to react to that.\n\n26:18.760 --> 26:19.760\nI'm just going to.\n\n26:19.760 --> 26:20.760\nI didn't.\n\n26:20.760 --> 26:23.840\nI didn't pass me by like I'm still talking about it.\n\n26:23.840 --> 26:27.200\nIt's not the world's best kept secret that your wife likes to lay naked on slab.\n\n26:27.200 --> 26:30.040\nThat you followed it up with a second one.\n\n26:30.040 --> 26:32.400\nI tried not to react to the first one.\n\n26:32.400 --> 26:33.400\nShe's known as slab later.\n\n26:33.400 --> 26:38.200\nOh, son of a bitch.\n\n26:38.200 --> 26:42.240\nThere are people like, sometimes I see, I think, I go, I think that's a real doll or\n\n26:42.240 --> 26:43.240\nsomething.\n\n26:43.240 --> 26:44.240\nLike in the background.\n\n26:44.240 --> 26:45.240\nYeah.\n\n26:45.240 --> 26:46.240\nThey never, they never use like fake.\n\n26:46.240 --> 26:47.240\nLike they did.\n\n26:47.240 --> 26:49.080\nIf they're like bodies were cut up, but they were like real or if they're just like sitting\n\n26:49.080 --> 26:50.080\nin a chair.\n\n26:50.080 --> 26:51.080\nThey're real people.\n\n26:51.080 --> 26:52.080\nReally?\n\n26:52.080 --> 26:53.080\nFor the most part.\n\n26:53.080 --> 26:54.080\nHow are they holding that still?\n\n26:54.080 --> 26:55.080\nUh, well, two things.\n\n26:55.080 --> 27:02.560\nUm, one of them was my, uh, a dude I grew up with in Lodi, California, this small town.\n\n27:02.560 --> 27:07.240\nWe grew up like three houses down from each other and our families were like, like sister\n\n27:07.240 --> 27:08.240\nfamilies.\n\n27:08.240 --> 27:10.640\nYou know, like once a week you have dinner with them.\n\n27:10.640 --> 27:11.640\nUh-huh.\n\n27:11.640 --> 27:18.800\nThis dude named Craig comes in at night and touches everyone's muscles with a special\n\n27:18.800 --> 27:19.800\nacid.\n\n27:19.800 --> 27:20.800\nUh-huh.\n\n27:20.800 --> 27:22.680\nThey, they put the shots under a pillow.\n\n27:22.680 --> 27:27.560\nUm, he was working on the show, which is crazy because we grew up like next to each\n\n27:27.560 --> 27:28.560\nother.\n\n27:28.560 --> 27:32.360\nHe was one of the naked like, no, he does, uh, he does post, but what he does is to, he'll\n\n27:32.360 --> 27:36.680\ntake a frame and, and if, if it is like still, but you know, there is somebody that's going\n\n27:36.680 --> 27:39.800\nthrough and like stealing images because people can't be that stiff.\n\n27:39.800 --> 27:40.800\nRight.\n\n27:40.800 --> 27:41.800\nOh, so easily just like split screen.\n\n27:41.800 --> 27:42.800\nThey like doing a little chunk.\n\n27:42.800 --> 27:43.800\nIt's not split screen.\n\n27:43.800 --> 27:44.800\nIt'll be like a frame.\n\n27:44.800 --> 27:48.240\nSo if, if something, if there is like, there, there, you know, that's how often how we would\n\n27:48.240 --> 27:51.000\nget it to look like Chevy Chase knew all his lines.\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:52.000\nYeah.\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:56.040\nLike we would do, we would do liquid more for like, like, like, like, you see those two\n\n27:56.040 --> 27:58.000\nshots of him next to Donald Glover.\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:02.800\nIt's like, like, see if there's a clock in the background of Chevy besides cause that\n\n28:02.800 --> 28:09.440\nfucking thing's going to go freak out for some extra, the background is hot, hot dog\n\n28:09.440 --> 28:11.440\nkeeps changing sizes.\n\n28:11.440 --> 28:14.800\nThe candles are all different.\n\n28:14.800 --> 28:19.200\nWe wish him the best, he's in recovery right now.\n\n28:19.200 --> 28:25.400\nCan we go back, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, slow, and first of all, this is\n\n28:25.400 --> 28:26.400\na fantastic name.\n\n28:26.400 --> 28:27.400\nYeah.\n\n28:27.400 --> 28:30.080\nI said, is it Tolome and you said that's the correct pronunciation, but it's not the\n\n28:30.080 --> 28:31.080\nAmerican pronunciation.\n\n28:31.080 --> 28:32.080\nYeah.\n\n28:32.080 --> 28:33.400\nThere's more English would be Tolome.\n\n28:33.400 --> 28:34.400\nGreek would be Tolome.\n\n28:34.400 --> 28:36.200\nThey actually pronounce the P. Tolome.\n\n28:36.200 --> 28:37.800\nPut the pit in there.\n\n28:37.800 --> 28:38.800\nYeah.\n\n28:38.800 --> 28:40.120\nYou said you were born in Kenya.\n\n28:40.120 --> 28:41.120\nThis is born in Kenya.\n\n28:41.120 --> 28:46.160\nSo I was born on the eclipse of the moon, which is the story I was told, but then I\n\n28:46.160 --> 28:48.680\nwent to an astrologer and I was born like two days after the eclipse of the moon.\n\n28:48.680 --> 28:50.640\nWho notices when the moon is eclipsed?\n\n28:50.640 --> 28:52.400\nWell, my parents.\n\n28:52.400 --> 28:53.400\nWhat eclipse is it?\n\n28:53.400 --> 28:54.400\nThe sun?\n\n28:54.400 --> 28:57.960\nNo, the earth eclipses anything, right?\n\n28:57.960 --> 28:58.960\nI don't know.\n\n28:58.960 --> 28:59.960\nI don't know.\n\n28:59.960 --> 29:03.840\nThe moon can eclipse the sun, the earth can eclipse both.\n\n29:03.840 --> 29:08.080\nThe reason why you don't see the moon all the time is cause of the shadow of the earth.\n\n29:08.080 --> 29:09.080\nWhat kind of show is this?\n\n29:09.080 --> 29:10.080\nYou're blowing my mind.\n\n29:10.080 --> 29:11.080\nYeah.\n\n29:11.080 --> 29:15.320\nSo, yeah, it was a full eclipse of the moon, which aren't that rare.\n\n29:15.320 --> 29:20.800\nAnd then Tolome was a Greek astronomer, Claudius Tolomeus was a Greek astronomer lived in\n\n29:20.800 --> 29:26.840\nEgypt, Alexander, when the Greek Empire owned Egypt, and he proved that was the family of\n\n29:26.840 --> 29:27.840\nthe Cleopatra decision.\n\n29:27.840 --> 29:28.840\nNo.\n\n29:28.840 --> 29:29.840\nNo.\n\n29:29.840 --> 29:30.840\nThe different guys, similar era.\n\n29:30.840 --> 29:31.840\nOkay.\n\n29:31.840 --> 29:35.240\nWere your parents, why so weird?\n\n29:35.240 --> 29:39.760\nWhy were they in Kenya and why did they name you that?\n\n29:39.760 --> 29:40.760\nThis with them.\n\n29:40.760 --> 29:44.760\nThis, by the way, I'm a bad interviewer.\n\n29:44.760 --> 29:53.600\nWell, you haven't attacked my wife, and I've gotten over it, I'm not thinking about it\n\n29:53.600 --> 29:54.600\nanymore.\n\n29:54.600 --> 29:55.600\nI don't think I attacked just somebody else.\n\n29:55.600 --> 30:00.560\nYou attacked, you called her a slab woman, pretty sure you called her a slab woman.\n\n30:00.560 --> 30:06.680\nI said people called her a slab lady, I had never said that at all.\n\n30:06.680 --> 30:08.480\nI simply am a journalist, sir.\n\n30:08.480 --> 30:14.720\nWell, and for my part, I've gotten over it.\n\n30:14.720 --> 30:20.640\nYeah, it's an interesting story, and I don't know how far to go into it, but it's dark.\n\n30:20.640 --> 30:21.640\nReally?\n\n30:21.640 --> 30:22.640\nYeah.\n\n30:22.640 --> 30:24.140\nYour parents having you as the story starts?\n\n30:24.140 --> 30:27.920\nThat story is much darker than I knew, and I found out about it recently.\n\n30:27.920 --> 30:28.920\nReally?\n\n30:28.920 --> 30:29.920\nYeah.\n\n30:29.920 --> 30:31.760\nSo how much time do you want to commit to this thing?\n\n30:31.760 --> 30:33.760\nWell, we've got other people to meet.\n\n30:33.760 --> 30:34.760\nOkay.\n\n30:34.760 --> 30:40.000\nI'll try to do the fast version.\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:44.320\nThe story that I was told was that he worked for an American guy, I should not be telling\n\n30:44.320 --> 30:47.160\nthe story.\n\n30:47.160 --> 30:51.600\nThis is not going well already.\n\n30:51.600 --> 30:55.000\nSo the story I was told as a child growing up was that he was building a fertilizer plant\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:56.000\nfor the Kenyan government.\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:58.200\nThere was an American company building fertilizer plant for the Kenyan government, and it didn't\n\n30:58.200 --> 31:03.000\ngo well, and so we got extradited out of the country, and the Kenyan government is horrible,\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:09.000\nand they threatened our lives a couple of times, and eventually we escaped and got out.\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:14.960\nWent to Cincinnati, which was my parents' relationship fell apart, because it was so\n\n31:14.960 --> 31:17.160\nstressful to get out of Kenya.\n\n31:17.160 --> 31:21.120\nOh, it's one of those couples that's going to blame the Kenyan government for hating\n\n31:21.120 --> 31:22.120\nthem?\n\n31:22.120 --> 31:23.120\nYes.\n\n31:23.120 --> 31:27.680\nI'm not working it out.\n\n31:27.680 --> 31:33.680\nSo I have to tell this difficult story, but also you're going to attack me along the way.\n\n31:33.680 --> 31:34.680\nAll right.\n\n31:34.680 --> 31:35.680\nOkay.\n\n31:35.680 --> 31:36.680\nI didn't know.\n\n31:36.680 --> 31:39.440\nIf we do attack anything, we'll just put a wound in its head and strip it naked so that\n\n31:39.440 --> 31:43.000\nyou can derive sexual pleasure from it.\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:50.440\nThat is literally my nightmare is like, I hope I end up naked on this show, because I've\n\n31:50.440 --> 31:51.440\nearned it.\n\n31:51.440 --> 31:56.640\nThat was my Westworld theory, by the way, was that the show was taking place in the\n\n31:56.640 --> 32:01.760\nyear, sorry to cut you off, the show's taking place in the year 7,000, and all of the robot,\n\n32:01.760 --> 32:02.760\nthere are no humans left.\n\n32:02.760 --> 32:03.760\nYeah, I heard that.\n\n32:03.760 --> 32:08.760\nAll of the robots go to Westworld as a mecca, where they can experience a budistic reincarnation\n\n32:08.760 --> 32:16.560\nprocess where you can rise up through the Rosencrantzes and the Guildensterns, to the\n\n32:16.560 --> 32:24.640\nMaves, to the Anthony Hopkins, and then cycle back through, because they've lost all contact\n\n32:24.640 --> 32:30.320\nwith their human roots, and they go there to just sort of revive themselves spiritually.\n\n32:30.320 --> 32:32.000\nIt's like they're wailing wall.\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:33.000\nYeah.\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:34.000\nAnyways.\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:39.040\nBasically, on that theory, someone like Maeve is actually attending the park.\n\n32:39.040 --> 32:43.880\nYou would eventually see that Maeve was also like a, yeah, that she'd be in that photo\n\n32:43.880 --> 32:47.320\nwith Anthony Hopkins when they're starting Westworld, or something, that she'd be in\n\n32:47.320 --> 32:51.640\nthe background with a lab coat on, or something, and that you'd be like a bartender, and that\n\n32:51.640 --> 32:55.320\nyou'd go, oh, that's pointless.\n\n32:55.320 --> 33:00.040\nWhat is the deal with the English guy, with the British overacting, like, screaming guy?\n\n33:00.040 --> 33:01.640\nI didn't meet him.\n\n33:01.640 --> 33:02.640\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n33:02.640 --> 33:03.640\nWhat do you mean?\n\n33:03.640 --> 33:05.640\nWas he in a different show?\n\n33:05.640 --> 33:11.520\nDoes he know that he's not, and that he's also in the same show as everybody else?\n\n33:11.520 --> 33:12.520\nI'm pretty sure.\n\n33:12.520 --> 33:18.720\nI mean, I didn't know he was even on, like, I only read my scenes.\n\n33:18.720 --> 33:19.720\nI know nothing about it.\n\n33:19.720 --> 33:23.600\nThey probably shot you out in an hour, like, all of your scenes are in one room in UTA's\n\n33:23.600 --> 33:24.600\nbasement.\n\n33:24.600 --> 33:25.600\nYeah.\n\n33:25.600 --> 33:27.720\nOkay, it's like, it's just...\n\n33:27.720 --> 33:31.720\nNo, no, it took the full two years.\n\n33:31.720 --> 33:32.720\nYeah.\n\n33:32.720 --> 33:33.720\nSo, technically, like...\n\n33:33.720 --> 33:34.720\nI mean, do impugn your craft.\n\n33:34.720 --> 33:35.720\nNo, no, logistically, I give you credit.\n\n33:35.720 --> 33:36.720\nLogistically, I couldn't open it up in that way.\n\n33:36.720 --> 33:37.720\nYeah.\n\n33:37.720 --> 33:48.720\nYeah, I'm thinking about all the time that I wasted, because had you, between being shooting\n\n33:48.720 --> 33:49.720\nthe show, it would have known much more efficiently.\n\n33:49.720 --> 33:50.720\nNow, did you ever...\n\n33:50.720 --> 33:51.720\nI've known for my efficiency.\n\n33:51.720 --> 33:52.720\nDid you ever have to interact?\n\n33:52.720 --> 33:56.480\nBecause I think the most fascinating part of that show is when they're just walking\n\n33:56.480 --> 33:57.720\nthat bison around in that glass road.\n\n33:57.720 --> 34:00.720\nThat's the funniest thing that you've got.\n\n34:00.720 --> 34:03.720\nJust showing the bison how to walk around.\n\n34:03.720 --> 34:11.160\nThey've mastered post-singularity, nanotechnological, like, like, life creation, but yeah, you've\n\n34:11.160 --> 34:12.160\ngot to...\n\n34:12.160 --> 34:14.720\nIt's well-known you've got to prime that bison, like, you've got to...\n\n34:14.720 --> 34:22.720\nBut the coolest thing, though, is that when Maeve was walking through.\n\n34:22.720 --> 34:24.720\nNo spoilers here, if you're listening.\n\n34:24.720 --> 34:25.720\nI don't think.\n\n34:25.720 --> 34:31.720\nBut walking through, and then there's, like, in those rooms, like, the poker game guys,\n\n34:31.720 --> 34:35.720\nand then they all draw guns, and then the technician goes, like, all right, back to one,\n\n34:35.720 --> 34:37.720\nor whatever, and they all pick up their cards.\n\n34:37.720 --> 34:39.720\nI thought that shit was...\n\n34:39.720 --> 34:40.720\nIt's a cool show.\n\n34:40.720 --> 34:41.720\nWe like it.\n\n34:41.720 --> 34:45.720\nI do wish there was a slower version of that show.\n\n34:45.720 --> 34:46.720\nHere's my thing.\n\n34:46.720 --> 34:53.720\nI would watch ten episodes where there is no plot, and just show us, like, some dude getting\n\n34:53.720 --> 34:58.720\noff a train and, like, getting on a horse and riding in one direction and just see what happens.\n\n34:58.720 --> 35:04.720\nIt's called Love Boat Meets Downton Abbey Meets Deadwood.\n\n35:04.720 --> 35:08.720\nIt's just, like, there's guest stars, and you don't have to do the serialized, like,\n\n35:08.720 --> 35:11.720\noh, shit, this whole park's going crazy.\n\n35:11.720 --> 35:12.720\nIt is Love Boat.\n\n35:12.720 --> 35:13.720\nThat's right.\n\n35:13.720 --> 35:14.720\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n35:14.720 --> 35:15.720\nOr it's Fantasy Heaven.\n\n35:15.720 --> 35:16.720\nThey could just do that.\n\n35:16.720 --> 35:19.720\nI think before the show came out, they thought that's what it was going to be.\n\n35:19.720 --> 35:22.720\nLike, people were like, oh, so each episode, someone new comes.\n\n35:22.720 --> 35:23.720\nOh, Tattoo.\n\n35:23.720 --> 35:25.720\nHere comes Bill Gates.\n\n35:25.720 --> 35:27.720\nHe's a philanthropist.\n\n35:27.720 --> 35:30.720\nHis fantasy is to be a gunslinger.\n\n35:30.720 --> 35:31.720\nBoss!\n\n35:31.720 --> 35:33.720\nBoss, isn't that everybody?\n\n35:33.720 --> 35:39.720\nYes, Tattoo, but Bill Gates wants to sling guns in a way that breaks his heart.\n\n35:39.720 --> 35:41.720\nI think you're tampering with magic.\n\n35:41.720 --> 35:43.720\nYou don't understand, boss.\n\n35:43.720 --> 35:44.720\nThat's okay.\n\n35:44.720 --> 35:45.720\nApparently, I'm God.\n\n35:45.720 --> 35:47.720\nWe all learned in season three.\n\n35:47.720 --> 35:53.720\nThere was this show called Fantasy Island that we've talked about with Paul F. Tompkins.\n\n35:53.720 --> 35:54.720\nDetrain!\n\n35:54.720 --> 35:55.720\nDetrain!\n\n35:55.720 --> 35:57.720\nGood night, everybody.\n\n35:57.720 --> 35:58.720\nDetrain?\n\n35:58.720 --> 35:59.720\nYeah, yeah.\n\n35:59.720 --> 36:03.720\nNo, but I really, that's what, that was my fantasy Westworld.\n\n36:03.720 --> 36:04.720\nI'm not knocking this one.\n\n36:04.720 --> 36:05.720\nNo!\n\n36:05.720 --> 36:09.720\nThe story is fascinating, but the idea that there would be an upstairs downstairs, like\n\n36:09.720 --> 36:10.720\ndown in Abbey.\n\n36:10.720 --> 36:11.720\nYeah.\n\n36:11.720 --> 36:13.720\nThe servants were the gods.\n\n36:13.720 --> 36:20.720\nThe gods lived in the underworld, and they were these polyamorous, asexual, multisexual.\n\n36:20.720 --> 36:23.720\nThey were so fucked up, like what you're saying.\n\n36:23.720 --> 36:29.720\nLike, they're looking at that you come to Westworld to fuck and murder in a simulation,\n\n36:29.720 --> 36:33.720\nand these people, like, designed the things and send them back up.\n\n36:33.720 --> 36:38.720\nAnd, like, how fucked up would they be as people, like, had their culture and stuff,\n\n36:38.720 --> 36:39.720\nand we...\n\n36:39.720 --> 36:42.720\nThey turned out a lot like that British guy on the show.\n\n36:42.720 --> 36:46.720\nCould there be a character that just comes in, like, just wants to open up a little mercantile\n\n36:46.720 --> 36:47.720\nstore?\n\n36:47.720 --> 36:48.720\nLike, just wants to...\n\n36:48.720 --> 36:50.720\nI want to become a blacksmith.\n\n36:50.720 --> 36:52.720\nI really want to get into blacksmiths.\n\n36:52.720 --> 36:53.720\nI get...\n\n36:53.720 --> 36:55.720\nHere's one thought that I've had that I haven't shared.\n\n36:55.720 --> 36:59.720\nI probably shouldn't, but I do think there are a couple people, probably, that would\n\n36:59.720 --> 37:04.720\ngo to the park, pay to go to the park, and then try to convince people that we're visiting\n\n37:04.720 --> 37:05.720\nthat they are robots.\n\n37:05.720 --> 37:06.720\nRight.\n\n37:06.720 --> 37:07.720\nNo, of course.\n\n37:07.720 --> 37:08.720\nOf course.\n\n37:08.720 --> 37:12.720\nAnd have sex with people, like, as almost like a servant, just want to feel what that's\n\n37:12.720 --> 37:16.720\nlike to, like, go through it, because people are that fucked up.\n\n37:16.720 --> 37:17.720\nOf course they are.\n\n37:17.720 --> 37:19.720\nGo to any ren fair, yes.\n\n37:19.720 --> 37:20.720\nYes!\n\n37:20.720 --> 37:21.720\nExactly.\n\n37:21.720 --> 37:25.720\nLike, the people that aren't getting paid that are walking around going, I don't look\n\n37:25.720 --> 37:26.720\nof none!\n\n37:26.720 --> 37:31.720\nYou're like, your dream is to, like, this guy's making $5 an hour, and he hates doing it.\n\n37:31.720 --> 37:33.720\nYou want to do it for free.\n\n37:33.720 --> 37:34.720\nYeah, like, yeah.\n\n37:34.720 --> 37:36.720\nIt'd be like a non-crying game.\n\n37:36.720 --> 37:42.720\nWhat happens if the guns that the guests have, are they real bullets, right?\n\n37:42.720 --> 37:44.720\nThey're blowing away the robots.\n\n37:44.720 --> 37:45.720\nWhat's keeping them from...\n\n37:45.720 --> 37:46.720\nI have no idea.\n\n37:46.720 --> 37:49.720\nFrom accidentally blowing away somebody that's another guest, they just didn't realize.\n\n37:49.720 --> 37:54.720\nWell, my assumption is that it is some kind of charge of some kind, and it either...\n\n37:54.720 --> 37:55.720\nI don't know.\n\n37:55.720 --> 37:57.720\nSome people get hit, and then they fall in and go, owie.\n\n37:57.720 --> 38:02.720\nAnd it has something to do with, like, the further out you go, you're, like, volunteering\n\n38:02.720 --> 38:07.720\nfor the potential for physical abuse, but there's still cardinal rules.\n\n38:07.720 --> 38:08.720\nLike, I can't leave a mark.\n\n38:08.720 --> 38:09.720\nLike, maybe.\n\n38:09.720 --> 38:10.720\nThat's what I'm hearing alluded to.\n\n38:10.720 --> 38:12.720\nThat doesn't seem from the show.\n\n38:12.720 --> 38:14.720\nAgain, I'm just watching as a fan.\n\n38:14.720 --> 38:15.720\nBut people get punched.\n\n38:15.720 --> 38:16.720\nLike, what happens there?\n\n38:16.720 --> 38:19.720\nBut I feel like it's like Ed Harris' character is out there.\n\n38:19.720 --> 38:21.720\nBy the way, I know there's this huge...\n\n38:21.720 --> 38:24.720\nThere's these reveals and shit that I'm not talking about, but like, so I'm not...\n\n38:24.720 --> 38:28.720\nI'm staring clear of spoilers, but saying, like, it seems like the Ed Harris character\n\n38:28.720 --> 38:32.720\nwas, like, going further and further out where it was, like, it's...\n\n38:32.720 --> 38:33.720\nYeah, more and more dangerous.\n\n38:33.720 --> 38:34.720\nThey can punch you in the face.\n\n38:34.720 --> 38:35.720\nYes.\n\n38:35.720 --> 38:36.720\nThey can knock you unconscious.\n\n38:36.720 --> 38:39.720\nLike, a little...\n\n38:39.720 --> 38:42.720\nYou know, you can tell the writers when you go back to work.\n\n38:42.720 --> 38:44.720\nI could use a little more clarity on that.\n\n38:44.720 --> 38:46.720\nI'm just kidding.\n\n38:46.720 --> 38:48.720\nThey have their thing going.\n\n38:48.720 --> 38:50.720\nSo, okay.\n\n38:50.720 --> 38:52.720\nSo, well, let's...\n\n38:52.720 --> 38:54.720\nDo you want...\n\n38:54.720 --> 38:56.720\nDo you want me to...\n\n38:56.720 --> 38:58.720\nOh, he's gone.\n\n38:58.720 --> 39:00.720\nI believe I can fly.\n\n39:00.720 --> 39:01.720\nAnd he's gone.\n\n39:01.720 --> 39:03.720\nI believe I can touch.\n\n39:03.720 --> 39:05.720\nEddie!\n\n39:10.720 --> 39:12.720\nDo you want me to...\n\n39:12.720 --> 39:15.720\nA very quick version of the other side of that Kenyan story?\n\n39:15.720 --> 39:17.720\nYes, the Kenyan government side.\n\n39:17.720 --> 39:20.720\nYeah, before I was born, my father worked for the CIA.\n\n39:20.720 --> 39:21.720\nOh, my God!\n\n39:21.720 --> 39:22.720\nYeah.\n\n39:22.720 --> 39:26.720\nTurns out, my father was the Bernie Madoff of Kenya.\n\n39:26.720 --> 39:34.720\nAnd I didn't find that out until 2012 when information came out that that plant that he was supposedly had built,\n\n39:34.720 --> 39:38.720\nthe Kenyan government was making payments on it for 30 years\n\n39:38.720 --> 39:42.720\nto a Brussels company, a Shell company.\n\n39:42.720 --> 39:44.720\nSo, the entire thing was a scam.\n\n39:44.720 --> 39:45.720\nOh, my God!\n\n39:45.720 --> 39:46.720\nThey scammed the entire country.\n\n39:46.720 --> 39:51.720\nThe only thing that would make the story good would be if it was in Nigeria.\n\n39:51.720 --> 39:52.720\nWhat?\n\n39:52.720 --> 39:55.720\nYour dad's job was to scam Nigerians.\n\n39:55.720 --> 39:57.720\nNever mind.\n\n39:57.720 --> 40:00.720\nOh, now I understand that.\n\n40:00.720 --> 40:02.720\nSo, his job...\n\n40:02.720 --> 40:04.720\nSo, that was the EIA operation?\n\n40:04.720 --> 40:06.720\nI don't know. We don't know.\n\n40:06.720 --> 40:10.720\nThey threatened your lives they had reason to because they...\n\n40:10.720 --> 40:11.720\nExactly.\n\n40:11.720 --> 40:15.720\nAnd some of this came out with WikiLeaks has...\n\n40:15.720 --> 40:18.720\nWhy am I talking about this?\n\n40:18.720 --> 40:21.720\nAre we all going to learn about your dad's with WikiLeaks?\n\n40:21.720 --> 40:23.720\nIs there going to be a drone strike on Harmony?\n\n40:23.720 --> 40:24.720\nNo.\n\n40:24.720 --> 40:27.720\nBut they have the embassy recordings.\n\n40:27.720 --> 40:32.720\nThey have the transcripts of when he had to go to the embassy to try to hide.\n\n40:32.720 --> 40:38.720\nSo, they had like, why am I saying the name?\n\n40:38.720 --> 40:41.720\nBut they have those transcripts of when he was...\n\n40:41.720 --> 40:44.720\nWhat the actual American interaction with this guy...\n\n40:44.720 --> 40:45.720\nSo, he gave you...\n\n40:45.720 --> 40:47.720\nYour name is like...\n\n40:47.720 --> 40:49.720\nIt's like a spy operation.\n\n40:49.720 --> 40:51.720\nLike, a Ptolemae.\n\n40:51.720 --> 40:53.720\nLike, it's like...\n\n40:53.720 --> 40:56.720\nYeah, there might be the key to the entire my name.\n\n40:56.720 --> 40:58.720\nI might have it in me.\n\n40:58.720 --> 41:00.720\nI think your name is like a password and some vault.\n\n41:00.720 --> 41:01.720\nRight.\n\n41:01.720 --> 41:05.720\nSo, first I have to do sexy laser hopscotch.\n\n41:05.720 --> 41:08.720\nAnd then when I get to the thing, I'm like, there's a password?\n\n41:08.720 --> 41:10.720\nPtolemae.\n\n41:10.720 --> 41:12.720\nYeah.\n\n41:12.720 --> 41:14.720\nI put my like, hand on it.\n\n41:14.720 --> 41:16.720\nOr they realize like, it's inside me.\n\n41:16.720 --> 41:19.720\nSome like, some kind of horcrux and they have to kill me to get it out.\n\n41:19.720 --> 41:25.720\nOh my god, like your scalp has a maze on it.\n\n41:25.720 --> 41:27.720\nThat's a show, right?\n\n41:27.720 --> 41:29.720\nYou understand, it's like a fiction.\n\n41:29.720 --> 41:30.720\nIt's a fiction.\n\n41:30.720 --> 41:33.720\nI don't think your scalp has a show, so there's a maze on it.\n\n41:33.720 --> 41:34.720\nNo, I...\n\n41:34.720 --> 41:39.720\nIt's getting a little bit like one of those 70's movies where you don't know how it's gonna end.\n\n41:39.720 --> 41:42.720\nAnd I'm slightly concerned.\n\n41:42.720 --> 41:48.720\nBy the way, if that, if that, if that scalp maze doesn't turn out to come to some use, some navigational purpose,\n\n41:48.720 --> 41:51.720\nI want some of my HBO money back.\n\n41:51.720 --> 41:54.720\nOr like, if he doesn't pull that scalp back out and go like,\n\n41:54.720 --> 42:01.720\nwell, we should be about in the middle.\n\n42:01.720 --> 42:03.720\nWe're right by the eyebrow.\n\n42:03.720 --> 42:08.720\nThe back side of the eyebrow.\n\n42:08.720 --> 42:14.720\nAlright, well, speaking of gore and things human and visceral,\n\n42:14.720 --> 42:20.720\nyour character has to deal in robotic blood and guts.\n\n42:20.720 --> 42:26.720\nAnd I, in my genius of booking guests, like I thought, just fit like a tumbler and key.\n\n42:26.720 --> 42:30.720\nYou just asked me to do the show like 10 minutes before.\n\n42:30.720 --> 42:31.720\nYeah, that's true.\n\n42:31.720 --> 42:34.720\nBut then I saw this connection and I'm excited about it.\n\n42:34.720 --> 42:36.720\nWe have, I met this couple.\n\n42:36.720 --> 42:40.720\nLet's bring out Alan and Katrina.\n\n42:40.720 --> 42:42.720\nI won't use their last names.\n\n42:42.720 --> 42:47.720\nAny World\n\n42:47.720 --> 42:52.720\nAny World\n\n42:52.720 --> 42:57.720\nAny World\n\n42:57.720 --> 43:05.720\nAny World, our loss is your gain.\n\n43:05.720 --> 43:10.720\nAlright, Alan and Katrina, you guys are EMTs, both of you.\n\n43:10.720 --> 43:11.720\nCorrect.\n\n43:11.720 --> 43:13.720\nYou're a married EMT couple.\n\n43:13.720 --> 43:14.720\nActually, we're just friends.\n\n43:14.720 --> 43:15.720\nWe're not married.\n\n43:15.720 --> 43:16.720\nWe're roommates.\n\n43:16.720 --> 43:17.720\nWhat?\n\n43:17.720 --> 43:18.720\nYes.\n\n43:18.720 --> 43:19.720\nWait, shut up, wait.\n\n43:19.720 --> 43:24.720\nAny World\n\n43:24.720 --> 43:30.720\nWait, when did I, how many times have you heard me talk to you as if you were husband and wife?\n\n43:30.720 --> 43:34.720\nActually, the only time was when we talked in the green room.\n\n43:34.720 --> 43:36.720\nBefore that, it was just Steve as far as I know.\n\n43:36.720 --> 43:39.720\nBut I was like, okay, well, we'll correct him when we get a chance.\n\n43:39.720 --> 43:42.720\nOkay, so whose kids did I meet?\n\n43:42.720 --> 43:43.720\nYou met my kids.\n\n43:43.720 --> 43:45.720\nOkay, your kids, you're just friends with Katrina.\n\n43:45.720 --> 43:46.720\nYou're not married.\n\n43:46.720 --> 43:48.720\nThose were not her kids.\n\n43:48.720 --> 43:49.720\nNo.\n\n43:49.720 --> 43:50.720\nAlright, fantastic.\n\n43:50.720 --> 43:53.720\nAlright, well, I mean, God, you guys are so boring now.\n\n43:53.720 --> 43:55.720\nOh, I thought you were married.\n\n43:55.720 --> 43:57.720\nNo, the marriage had nothing to do with it.\n\n43:57.720 --> 43:59.720\nI'm just fascinated I could get that wrong somehow.\n\n43:59.720 --> 44:03.720\nOkay, so anyways, but I met you guys and your kids.\n\n44:03.720 --> 44:13.720\nYou guys had, we met at Stan Lee's Kamikaze Expo in line to meet Stan Lee,\n\n44:13.720 --> 44:18.720\nwhich I was told was happening because Stan Lee wanted to meet me.\n\n44:18.720 --> 44:25.720\nAnd you had been told was happening because you were a contest winner\n\n44:25.720 --> 44:28.720\nand got to meet Stan Lee and both of us experienced the same thing,\n\n44:28.720 --> 44:33.720\nwhich is a very confusing kind of awkward.\n\n44:33.720 --> 44:35.720\nIf you had told me this was how it was going to work,\n\n44:35.720 --> 44:39.720\nI could have opted out like kind of meeting with a very beleaguered,\n\n44:39.720 --> 44:41.720\nnot beleaguered, he wasn't cranky.\n\n44:41.720 --> 44:44.720\nHe's just kind of, he's Stan Lee, he's got bigger fish to fry.\n\n44:44.720 --> 44:46.720\nHe's just kind of like, what?\n\n44:46.720 --> 44:48.720\nHello, hello, hello.\n\n44:48.720 --> 44:50.720\nHe's got a pep in his step.\n\n44:50.720 --> 44:52.720\nI mean, he's really, as far as what I see him,\n\n44:52.720 --> 44:54.720\nhe's walking around like he's 20 years old.\n\n44:54.720 --> 44:55.720\nYeah, I don't know how old he is.\n\n44:55.720 --> 44:56.720\n93.\n\n44:56.720 --> 44:57.720\nJesus.\n\n44:57.720 --> 44:58.720\nYes.\n\n44:58.720 --> 45:01.720\nHe's 93 years old and he walks around.\n\n45:01.720 --> 45:06.720\nI mean, we pick up patients every day that they're 30 years old\n\n45:06.720 --> 45:09.720\nand they're like, I can't walk to the gurney.\n\n45:09.720 --> 45:10.720\nWell, what happened?\n\n45:10.720 --> 45:11.720\nI stubbed my toe.\n\n45:11.720 --> 45:12.720\nReally?\n\n45:12.720 --> 45:14.720\nThis is what you're going to go with when we get to the hospital.\n\n45:14.720 --> 45:15.720\nYou stubbed your toe.\n\n45:15.720 --> 45:16.720\nYou don't need to go to the hospital.\n\n45:16.720 --> 45:17.720\nYes, I do.\n\n45:17.720 --> 45:20.720\nStan Lee's walking around in 93 like he's, you know, the godfather\n\n45:20.720 --> 45:23.720\nand you can't get to the gurney because you stubbed your toe.\n\n45:23.720 --> 45:24.720\nYeah.\n\n45:24.720 --> 45:25.720\nYeah, so he's doing great.\n\n45:25.720 --> 45:27.720\nHonestly, yeah, if you guys haven't met him and want to meet him,\n\n45:27.720 --> 45:29.720\nyeah, soon.\n\n45:29.720 --> 45:32.720\nBut maybe he's never stubbed his toe.\n\n45:32.720 --> 45:35.720\nMaybe Stan Lee is only 93 because somehow,\n\n45:35.720 --> 45:38.720\nand then he's going to stub his toe and just shatter like close.\n\n45:38.720 --> 45:40.720\nOh, just sick.\n\n45:40.720 --> 45:42.720\nKnock on wood.\n\n45:42.720 --> 45:46.720\nBut anyways, we met him, which was essentially, it was like,\n\n45:46.720 --> 45:48.720\nit was like, Stan Lee wants to meet you.\n\n45:48.720 --> 45:50.720\nWell, no, he doesn't.\n\n45:50.720 --> 45:53.720\nWe were brought to the front of an autograph line\n\n45:53.720 --> 45:56.720\nat a standard convention thing and then it was like,\n\n45:56.720 --> 45:59.720\nlet me introduce you to, this is Dan Harmon.\n\n45:59.720 --> 46:01.720\nHe has a show called Rick and Morty.\n\n46:01.720 --> 46:03.720\nOh, is that on the radio?\n\n46:03.720 --> 46:07.720\nHe said something like, I didn't know if he was doing a bit or not\n\n46:07.720 --> 46:10.720\nor if that was like, I don't know if that was like a Stan Lee standard bit\n\n46:10.720 --> 46:16.720\nor if he really was like, hey, maybe, I mean, maybe it's on the radio.\n\n46:16.720 --> 46:18.720\nBut anyways, we...\n\n46:18.720 --> 46:20.720\nRadio TV shows are what he knows.\n\n46:20.720 --> 46:21.720\nYeah, yeah.\n\n46:21.720 --> 46:22.720\nThat's what you grew up on.\n\n46:22.720 --> 46:24.720\nLike you guys...\n\n46:24.720 --> 46:26.720\nSo then you were standing there and I was like,\n\n46:26.720 --> 46:28.720\nI was wondering who the hell are these guys?\n\n46:28.720 --> 46:31.720\nI thought maybe you were like, you could have been somebody from a CW show\n\n46:31.720 --> 46:33.720\nor something, I didn't know.\n\n46:33.720 --> 46:37.720\nI was there to do a panel and then meet Stan Lee\n\n46:37.720 --> 46:39.720\nand then you guys were there, you were cosplaying,\n\n46:39.720 --> 46:41.720\nyou were your Green Lantern.\n\n46:41.720 --> 46:43.720\nI was the Flash that day.\n\n46:43.720 --> 46:46.720\nWe did a group as the Blue Lanterns\n\n46:46.720 --> 46:50.720\nand my character was the Flash that had been recruited by the Blue Lanterns.\n\n46:50.720 --> 46:52.720\nThose Lanterns.\n\n46:52.720 --> 46:54.720\nYeah.\n\n46:54.720 --> 46:56.720\nIt was a simple hope.\n\n46:56.720 --> 46:58.720\nYou love the Lantern mythology like that?\n\n46:58.720 --> 47:01.720\nActually, I do enjoy a lot of the Lantern mythology.\n\n47:01.720 --> 47:06.720\nI think it shows the perspective of a lot of people's personalities\n\n47:06.720 --> 47:09.720\nand how we're all different and how things balance out\n\n47:09.720 --> 47:11.720\nand keep each other in check.\n\n47:11.720 --> 47:15.720\nBecause if you're a Green Lantern, you're basing it on willpower.\n\n47:15.720 --> 47:17.720\nWillpower, right? What's blue again?\n\n47:17.720 --> 47:18.720\nHope.\n\n47:18.720 --> 47:20.720\nHope versus willpower.\n\n47:20.720 --> 47:24.720\nSee, you could have willpower and bring that to bear with hope.\n\n47:24.720 --> 47:27.720\nCouldn't you hope with will, with a strong will?\n\n47:27.720 --> 47:29.720\nYes, I think.\n\n47:29.720 --> 47:31.720\nOr be angry with a strong will.\n\n47:31.720 --> 47:34.720\nBut you could have a strong will and still be like, oh, I can't do this.\n\n47:34.720 --> 47:36.720\nThis sucks.\n\n47:36.720 --> 47:38.720\nI don't want to get out of bed.\n\n47:38.720 --> 47:40.720\nI work at Walmart.\n\n47:40.720 --> 47:42.720\nWas that anywhere?\n\n47:42.720 --> 47:44.720\nAnywhere.\n\n47:44.720 --> 47:46.720\nThere we go.\n\n47:46.720 --> 47:48.720\nOkay, well, I don't know.\n\n47:48.720 --> 47:50.720\nThere's a thing. I'm a verbal thinker.\n\n47:50.720 --> 47:54.720\nI don't like the superpower where I can make a green thing in front of me.\n\n47:54.720 --> 47:57.720\nAnd then it's like, oh, no, there's a yellow thing.\n\n47:57.720 --> 47:59.720\nThat's my worst enemy.\n\n47:59.720 --> 48:01.720\nI was like, what is the green thing?\n\n48:01.720 --> 48:03.720\nThe green thing is like a machine gun.\n\n48:03.720 --> 48:05.720\nI made a green machine gun.\n\n48:05.720 --> 48:07.720\nAnd I was like, oh, great.\n\n48:07.720 --> 48:09.720\nThat's clever that you thought of a machine gun.\n\n48:09.720 --> 48:12.720\nAnyways, I don't want to shit on your life.\n\n48:12.720 --> 48:15.720\nKatrina, what were you dressed as?\n\n48:15.720 --> 48:18.720\nI was debuting Jack Skellington Assassin.\n\n48:18.720 --> 48:21.720\nSo Assassin's Creed, Jack Skellington version.\n\n48:21.720 --> 48:22.720\nNice.\n\n48:22.720 --> 48:26.720\nAnd you guys are married, which I thought was so cool.\n\n48:26.720 --> 48:29.720\nCongratulations, by the way.\n\n48:29.720 --> 48:31.720\nI like what you said that you were debuting it.\n\n48:31.720 --> 48:35.720\nThat was the inaugural go at this particular cosplay?\n\n48:35.720 --> 48:38.720\nIt was. I had just finished it the night before.\n\n48:38.720 --> 48:41.720\nBut yeah, it was where I debuted that new cosplay.\n\n48:41.720 --> 48:43.720\nDid it get some love? Did you get some good attention for that?\n\n48:43.720 --> 48:45.720\nIt actually did. It was a big hit.\n\n48:45.720 --> 48:47.720\nAre you all right, Tolome?\n\n48:47.720 --> 48:48.720\nNo, I'm good.\n\n48:48.720 --> 48:50.720\nHe's asleep now.\n\n48:50.720 --> 48:53.720\nI'm kind of a fan of the lantern situation,\n\n48:53.720 --> 48:55.720\nbut I'm trying to keep my mouth shut.\n\n48:55.720 --> 48:57.720\nWell, all right. I mean, sell me on Green Lantern.\n\n48:57.720 --> 48:58.720\nLook, Eric.\n\n48:58.720 --> 48:59.720\nIt's imagination.\n\n48:59.720 --> 49:00.720\nEric Esquivel.\n\n49:00.720 --> 49:01.720\nHe sold me on Superman.\n\n49:01.720 --> 49:03.720\nLike, I fucking love Superman now, you know?\n\n49:03.720 --> 49:04.720\nLike, tell me about you.\n\n49:04.720 --> 49:06.720\nWell, so here's the thing about Superman.\n\n49:06.720 --> 49:08.720\nIn my opinion, like all of these things came from\n\n49:08.720 --> 49:12.720\nan aspect of human nature that was then expanded\n\n49:12.720 --> 49:14.720\nupon as a what if.\n\n49:14.720 --> 49:18.720\nIt's as like the natural incarnation of that thing.\n\n49:18.720 --> 49:20.720\nAnd one of the things that we have as humans\n\n49:20.720 --> 49:21.720\nis imagination.\n\n49:21.720 --> 49:24.720\nLike, what if I could just imagine something\n\n49:24.720 --> 49:27.720\nto will it into place?\n\n49:27.720 --> 49:30.720\nThe colors thing, that is a currency that it's using.\n\n49:30.720 --> 49:31.720\nThere's just like differences,\n\n49:31.720 --> 49:33.720\nand there's a lot of card games that are based on that colors\n\n49:33.720 --> 49:34.720\nor what have you.\n\n49:34.720 --> 49:37.720\nBut the essence of what wouldn't be cool is\n\n49:37.720 --> 49:38.720\nif I could lift something,\n\n49:38.720 --> 49:40.720\nwhat if I could lift a million things?\n\n49:40.720 --> 49:42.720\nYou know what I mean?\n\n49:42.720 --> 49:43.720\nIt's just an extension of a human trait.\n\n49:43.720 --> 49:45.720\nAnd this trait is imagination itself.\n\n49:45.720 --> 49:47.720\nAnd that is a really cool thing to follow.\n\n49:47.720 --> 49:51.720\nLike, it's so fun to like celebrate that as a power.\n\n49:51.720 --> 49:53.720\nAnd a physical incarnation of that power.\n\n49:53.720 --> 49:56.720\nBut is it the idea that the ring gives you more imagination,\n\n49:56.720 --> 49:58.720\nor is it the ring that could focus your imagination\n\n49:58.720 --> 50:01.720\nso you need to be imaginative to use it right?\n\n50:01.720 --> 50:03.720\nBecause he could just shoot people with green\n\n50:03.720 --> 50:04.720\nblast of energy and kill them.\n\n50:04.720 --> 50:05.720\nAnd it works.\n\n50:05.720 --> 50:06.720\nThat is also part of his imagination.\n\n50:06.720 --> 50:07.720\nWhatever it's, whatever it's commanded with.\n\n50:07.720 --> 50:10.720\nAlso, he could just cover himself with a green shield\n\n50:10.720 --> 50:11.720\nthat protects him against damage.\n\n50:11.720 --> 50:14.720\nSo he could just do that the whole time.\n\n50:14.720 --> 50:15.720\nHe kind of does.\n\n50:15.720 --> 50:16.720\nAll these things.\n\n50:16.720 --> 50:18.720\nAnd DC suffers from this across the board.\n\n50:18.720 --> 50:20.720\nSo I think it's beautiful is that it's all overpowered.\n\n50:20.720 --> 50:21.720\nAll of these things are overpowered.\n\n50:21.720 --> 50:23.720\nAnd that's why it's difficult for them to like figure out\n\n50:23.720 --> 50:24.720\nhow to make these things human.\n\n50:24.720 --> 50:26.720\nBut it is an amazing,\n\n50:26.720 --> 50:30.720\nit's just an amazing currency to play with the idea of imagination.\n\n50:30.720 --> 50:33.720\nAnd I like that they went with it because he had so much power,\n\n50:33.720 --> 50:34.720\nthe power of imagination,\n\n50:34.720 --> 50:36.720\nthat he eventually just went crazy.\n\n50:36.720 --> 50:37.720\nWhich I think is so interesting.\n\n50:37.720 --> 50:38.720\nWell, yeah.\n\n50:38.720 --> 50:39.720\nThey're getting into,\n\n50:39.720 --> 50:40.720\nI'm sure if I read every,\n\n50:40.720 --> 50:43.720\nlike Green Lantern obviously goes all the way.\n\n50:43.720 --> 50:44.720\nJust don't watch the movie.\n\n50:44.720 --> 50:45.720\nI only know him from the surface.\n\n50:45.720 --> 50:46.720\nIt's just like the guy with the green,\n\n50:46.720 --> 50:48.720\nwith the ring and the thing.\n\n50:48.720 --> 50:49.720\nYeah, sorry.\n\n50:49.720 --> 50:50.720\nThe, uh...\n\n50:50.720 --> 50:54.720\nBut just make a green Superman.\n\n50:54.720 --> 51:00.720\nSpencer's point is about that I never...\n\n51:00.720 --> 51:01.720\nAnd just to be clear,\n\n51:01.720 --> 51:02.720\nI don't hate Green Lantern.\n\n51:02.720 --> 51:05.720\nYou brought this on and then we talked about it.\n\n51:05.720 --> 51:06.720\nLike I think it's...\n\n51:06.720 --> 51:07.720\nI said, what do you think of Green Lantern?\n\n51:07.720 --> 51:09.720\nBut then you said something that I thought was interesting\n\n51:09.720 --> 51:12.720\nbecause I don't think this stuff through enough.\n\n51:12.720 --> 51:15.720\nBut you said, what you just said,\n\n51:15.720 --> 51:20.720\nDC characters, it's all like gods basically.\n\n51:20.720 --> 51:21.720\nUnless you count Batman,\n\n51:21.720 --> 51:24.720\nbut there's Marvel characters.\n\n51:24.720 --> 51:27.720\nDC characters are defined by one weakness.\n\n51:27.720 --> 51:28.720\nThey all have like a kryptonite.\n\n51:28.720 --> 51:31.720\nAnd then Marvel characters are,\n\n51:31.720 --> 51:35.720\nyou know, they're all kind of, in one sense or another,\n\n51:35.720 --> 51:38.720\nregular Joes who have one power.\n\n51:38.720 --> 51:39.720\nYes.\n\n51:39.720 --> 51:42.720\nLike that kind of like fucks up their life.\n\n51:42.720 --> 51:43.720\nExactly.\n\n51:43.720 --> 51:45.720\nBut if you look at it, it's like a 70's movie thing.\n\n51:45.720 --> 51:46.720\nYou're a superhero.\n\n51:46.720 --> 51:47.720\nYou cannot date.\n\n51:47.720 --> 51:48.720\nSorry.\n\n51:48.720 --> 51:49.720\nNo, no, it's okay.\n\n51:49.720 --> 51:51.720\nI'm gonna stop talking because I'm just gonna keep talking.\n\n51:51.720 --> 51:52.720\nNo, come on.\n\n51:52.720 --> 51:53.720\nYou're Ptolemae.\n\n51:53.720 --> 51:54.720\nI mean, we can't...\n\n51:54.720 --> 51:57.720\nLook at it like in the 70's version, right?\n\n51:57.720 --> 51:59.720\nSo there's 70's films and there's films that come after it\n\n51:59.720 --> 52:00.720\nthat are just like archetypes.\n\n52:00.720 --> 52:05.720\nBut these things came at a time in our world that is much,\n\n52:05.720 --> 52:08.720\nthat is in the past, long time ago.\n\n52:08.720 --> 52:13.720\nSo the idea of extending a human trait to its maximum was\n\n52:13.720 --> 52:15.720\nbrand new and had never happened before.\n\n52:15.720 --> 52:18.720\nSo they weren't perceiving how this would need to be\n\n52:18.720 --> 52:19.720\nmodified in the future.\n\n52:19.720 --> 52:23.720\nThey were, they, from a single individual that is a living\n\n52:23.720 --> 52:26.720\nperson to the godlike power that they were given,\n\n52:26.720 --> 52:28.720\nreally expanded people's imagination.\n\n52:28.720 --> 52:31.720\nAnd expanded like their experience of the world around them.\n\n52:31.720 --> 52:32.720\nThere was purpose to these things.\n\n52:32.720 --> 52:34.720\nSo it was this big thing and they still gave them that\n\n52:34.720 --> 52:36.720\nweakness, which I think is fascinating.\n\n52:36.720 --> 52:37.720\nIt's an interesting archetype.\n\n52:37.720 --> 52:40.720\nAnd I don't think it holds up as well or as easily as today.\n\n52:40.720 --> 52:43.720\nSo I'm not arguing one against the other, but these are\n\n52:43.720 --> 52:44.720\nfascinating.\n\n52:44.720 --> 52:47.720\nI think they're fascinating like tools for storytelling.\n\n52:47.720 --> 52:50.720\nAnd I think people don't quite understand like the lineage\n\n52:50.720 --> 52:53.720\nof where it came from even in the same way that people don't\n\n52:53.720 --> 52:55.720\nlike 70's movies now because they're not great.\n\n52:55.720 --> 52:57.720\nBut they were really fascinating at the time when there were\n\n52:57.720 --> 52:58.720\nno rules.\n\n52:58.720 --> 52:59.720\nRight.\n\n52:59.720 --> 53:01.720\nBut are we supposed to look at them through that lens?\n\n53:01.720 --> 53:03.720\nI guess, yeah, when I watch a Woody Allen movie, I'm like,\n\n53:03.720 --> 53:06.720\npart of my appreciation is he wasn't famous for being Woody\n\n53:06.720 --> 53:07.720\nAllen yet.\n\n53:07.720 --> 53:09.720\nThis is amazing that he put himself in a movie even though\n\n53:09.720 --> 53:13.720\nhe's not sexy and he's like, just decided to cast himself as\n\n53:13.720 --> 53:14.720\nthe romantic lead.\n\n53:14.720 --> 53:15.720\nLike that's hilarious.\n\n53:15.720 --> 53:21.720\nLike, I am looking at it through a cultural retro lens.\n\n53:21.720 --> 53:23.720\nAnd his level of honesty was way too far.\n\n53:23.720 --> 53:25.720\nBecause if I look at it through a modern lens, I'm like,\n\n53:25.720 --> 53:30.720\nI don't like Woody Allen movies anymore.\n\n53:30.720 --> 53:34.720\nI'm fascinated by the idea that, like, I fortunately have\n\n53:34.720 --> 53:37.720\nnever had to be in an ambulance with EMTs.\n\n53:37.720 --> 53:40.720\nBut I like the idea that the EMTs that come and get you might\n\n53:40.720 --> 53:43.720\nalso have been cosplaying the night before.\n\n53:43.720 --> 53:44.720\nYes.\n\n53:44.720 --> 53:47.720\nLet's get into your vocation because that's what's fascinating.\n\n53:47.720 --> 53:49.720\nSo I just learned in the green room, for instance,\n\n53:49.720 --> 53:51.720\nEMTs totally different from paramedics.\n\n53:51.720 --> 53:53.720\nNot totally different, but different.\n\n53:53.720 --> 53:54.720\nI always thought it was synonymous.\n\n53:54.720 --> 54:01.720\nEMTs are alarmingly close to a person that got out of high\n\n54:01.720 --> 54:04.720\nschool and wants to work with blood and guts for a living.\n\n54:04.720 --> 54:05.720\nYeah, that's basic.\n\n54:05.720 --> 54:08.720\nNot to knock your vocation, but actually to praise you because\n\n54:08.720 --> 54:09.720\nit's a very low paying job.\n\n54:09.720 --> 54:10.720\nGo ahead.\n\n54:10.720 --> 54:11.720\nYou take it from here.\n\n54:11.720 --> 54:12.720\nYeah.\n\n54:12.720 --> 54:15.720\nWell, first of all, thank you for saying I'm out of high\n\n54:15.720 --> 54:16.720\nschool.\n\n54:16.720 --> 54:18.720\nI'm actually 30 now, so I must look good.\n\n54:18.720 --> 54:20.720\nBeyond that, yeah, it's true.\n\n54:20.720 --> 54:25.720\nBasically, it's considered a certificate that you would get\n\n54:25.720 --> 54:32.720\nin a college setting, but ultimately, our schooling and\n\n54:32.720 --> 54:35.720\nstuff is about six to nine months, and there's even\n\n54:35.720 --> 54:37.720\naccelerated programs, which you can do it in like two.\n\n54:37.720 --> 54:39.720\nI don't recommend that to anybody.\n\n54:39.720 --> 54:41.720\nImagine trying to understand all this information in two\n\n54:41.720 --> 54:43.720\nmonths, and really that's not even true.\n\n54:43.720 --> 54:45.720\nI don't recommend that to the injured.\n\n54:45.720 --> 54:48.720\nYeah, we're sending the guy out.\n\n54:48.720 --> 54:51.720\nHe's got his GT, and he took it weekend intensive.\n\n54:51.720 --> 54:56.720\nThat's exactly why I didn't do that, because in my\n\n54:56.720 --> 54:59.720\nopinion, if your life is in my hands, the last thing you\n\n54:59.720 --> 55:02.720\nwant to know is I've been practicing this for the past\n\n55:02.720 --> 55:03.720\nfour weeks.\n\n55:03.720 --> 55:05.720\nDon't worry, you're going to be okay.\n\n55:05.720 --> 55:07.720\nHow do I do this again?\n\n55:07.720 --> 55:08.720\nIt's okay.\n\n55:08.720 --> 55:11.720\nI've been doing this for every weekend for the past month.\n\n55:11.720 --> 55:12.720\nYou're good.\n\n55:12.720 --> 55:15.720\nAnd you said an EMT's job is to stabilize.\n\n55:15.720 --> 55:18.720\nYou arrive at the scene, it's like tourniquets,\n\n55:18.720 --> 55:20.720\nsplints, I don't know, whatever.\n\n55:20.720 --> 55:24.720\nSplinting, bleeding control, so tourniquets, breathing\n\n55:24.720 --> 55:25.720\nfor people?\n\n55:25.720 --> 55:26.720\nWe actually are able to do that.\n\n55:26.720 --> 55:27.720\nVentilating, yes.\n\n55:27.720 --> 55:28.720\nVentilating.\n\n55:28.720 --> 55:29.720\nLike tracheotomies?\n\n55:29.720 --> 55:30.720\nYou ever have to punch a hole?\n\n55:30.720 --> 55:31.720\nNo tricks.\n\n55:31.720 --> 55:32.720\nNo tricks.\n\n55:32.720 --> 55:33.720\nOh, okay.\n\n55:33.720 --> 55:34.720\nYou have the little mask that you put over people's\n\n55:34.720 --> 55:36.720\nfaces, and you squeeze the bags.\n\n55:36.720 --> 55:38.720\nAre able to breathe for them until the paramedics come\n\n55:38.720 --> 55:41.720\nand can stick tubes down their throat and intubate them.\n\n55:41.720 --> 55:43.720\nYeah, and the difference basically between like EMT\n\n55:43.720 --> 55:46.720\nand paramedics, so EMT, basically we are their\n\n55:46.720 --> 55:48.720\nassistants, if you want to put it that way.\n\n55:48.720 --> 55:49.720\nWe assist them.\n\n55:49.720 --> 55:51.720\nWe're the nurses to their doctor.\n\n55:51.720 --> 55:52.720\nRight.\n\n55:52.720 --> 55:55.720\nAnd the paramedics spend a lot more time in school to get\n\n55:55.720 --> 56:00.720\ntheir medical license and basically, as I said, our job is\n\n56:00.720 --> 56:03.720\nto stabilize the patient to get them to the hospital in\n\n56:03.720 --> 56:05.720\nunder 10 minutes, hopefully.\n\n56:05.720 --> 56:08.720\nAnd in that time, once we get there, the nurses and the doctors\n\n56:08.720 --> 56:11.720\nand the ER take over and they go ahead and make sure that\n\n56:11.720 --> 56:12.720\nyou're able to revitalize the person.\n\n56:12.720 --> 56:17.720\nSo if a 911 call goes out, an EMT is a responder on that.\n\n56:17.720 --> 56:19.720\nYeah, so the EMT likely is the person driving.\n\n56:19.720 --> 56:22.720\nThe paramedic is going to be in the passenger seat because\n\n56:22.720 --> 56:24.720\nhe's got to be first to...\n\n56:24.720 --> 56:26.720\nOr she.\n\n56:26.720 --> 56:27.720\nOr she.\n\n56:27.720 --> 56:28.720\nI apologize.\n\n56:28.720 --> 56:29.720\nYes.\n\n56:29.720 --> 56:33.720\nI believe I cry.\n\n56:33.720 --> 56:36.720\nGender equality, this guy.\n\n56:36.720 --> 56:39.720\nDan's Marvel superpower is that he learned that he can\n\n56:39.720 --> 56:45.720\nhigh road you without doing anything really, let that heros get off.\n\n56:45.720 --> 56:52.720\nImagine harnessing the power to high road.\n\n56:52.720 --> 56:56.720\nI thought you guys were married because I'm not racist.\n\n56:56.720 --> 57:03.720\nOh, God.\n\n57:03.720 --> 57:05.720\nBut he has a weakness.\n\n57:05.720 --> 57:06.720\nYes.\n\n57:06.720 --> 57:08.720\nI see race.\n\n57:08.720 --> 57:11.720\nI can't stop seeing it.\n\n57:11.720 --> 57:13.720\nIt's everywhere.\n\n57:13.720 --> 57:15.720\nYou said you were from Kenya, right?\n\n57:15.720 --> 57:22.720\nNo.\n\n57:22.720 --> 57:31.720\nI'm basically like the last guy that deserves to say I'm Kenyan.\n\n57:31.720 --> 57:41.720\nYou guys told me something.\n\n57:41.720 --> 57:47.720\nI want to honor your candor.\n\n57:47.720 --> 57:50.720\nI think people will understand this.\n\n57:50.720 --> 57:54.720\nYou guys work in human plumbing for a living.\n\n57:54.720 --> 57:59.720\nYou show up and people are ripped apart.\n\n57:59.720 --> 58:01.720\nYou have things knocked off of them.\n\n58:01.720 --> 58:05.720\nPeople are in various states of biological chaos and your job is to stabilize it.\n\n58:05.720 --> 58:06.720\nWhat's that?\n\n58:06.720 --> 58:08.720\nDifferent parts of decay.\n\n58:08.720 --> 58:17.720\nAnd so you shared with me in the green room, you guys among yourselves, just as I think\n\n58:17.720 --> 58:22.720\nwriters in writers' rooms go to some pretty dark places that don't necessarily have anything\n\n58:22.720 --> 58:26.720\nto do with the jokes that end up in the Big Bang Theory.\n\n58:26.720 --> 58:29.720\nYou guys go to fucking dark.\n\n58:29.720 --> 58:33.720\nYou said you got a YouTube video that was like a private link to a YouTube video.\n\n58:33.720 --> 58:39.720\nBasically, our Christmas parties are who has the goriest pictures and who has the goriest stories.\n\n58:39.720 --> 58:43.720\nIt's not so much that we're like six sadistic people.\n\n58:43.720 --> 58:46.720\nIt's the fact that that's how we cope with it.\n\n58:46.720 --> 58:52.720\nYou have to basically make humor out of some of, I'm sorry, to say somebody's darkest day\n\n58:52.720 --> 58:56.720\nor their family's darkest day because you've got to be able to come home and be like,\n\n58:56.720 --> 58:57.720\nI'm okay.\n\n58:57.720 --> 58:58.720\nI'm going to be okay.\n\n58:58.720 --> 59:00.720\nIt gives you control over it.\n\n59:00.720 --> 59:03.720\nIt's a very uncontrollable circumstance that you're constantly inserting.\n\n59:03.720 --> 59:05.720\nI can see all this stuff all day.\n\n59:05.720 --> 59:07.720\nGo home and still be able to lay down and sleep at night.\n\n59:07.720 --> 59:08.720\nExactly.\n\n59:08.720 --> 59:12.720\nAnd otherwise than that, I mean, loving Deadpool is my favorite character.\n\n59:12.720 --> 59:13.720\nIt does help.\n\n59:13.720 --> 59:17.720\nDeadpool makes sense for an EMT.\n\n59:17.720 --> 59:18.720\nExactly.\n\n59:18.720 --> 59:20.720\nThat's when people are really excited to see me.\n\n59:20.720 --> 59:21.720\nI was cosplaying Deadpool this morning.\n\n59:21.720 --> 59:23.720\nNow I'm here to help you.\n\n59:23.720 --> 59:26.720\nSo, because you guys told me, I mean, you were just, I don't know,\n\n59:26.720 --> 59:28.720\nit's like, I don't even know why I bring it up again.\n\n59:28.720 --> 59:32.720\nIt was just like kind of fascinating watching your face, which like,\n\n59:32.720 --> 59:37.720\nwhen you're describing like, you got this video and it was like this guy that got like,\n\n59:37.720 --> 59:39.720\nground up or split apart or something.\n\n59:39.720 --> 59:42.720\nAnd you're kind of like, I was like, like this sort of like,\n\n59:42.720 --> 59:45.720\nyou might as well have been talking about like architecture.\n\n59:45.720 --> 59:47.720\nArm went this way, head was that way.\n\n59:47.720 --> 59:48.720\nYeah.\n\n59:48.720 --> 59:50.720\nThat's basically, I mean, and that's how it is.\n\n59:50.720 --> 59:55.720\nIt's a point of why we kind of do our jobs because whether we're talking about,\n\n59:55.720 --> 01:00:01.720\nyes, this video where the guy was going like 170 miles per hour on his motorcycle\n\n01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:06.720\nand then next part in the video, well, his torso is here, his head is over there\n\n01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:12.720\nand his legs are split apart like, you know, wishbones, except in the middle are his pants\n\n01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:15.720\nthat are holding the two feet so you can kind of nunchuck them, you know.\n\n01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:20.720\nYou know, it's funny to me because...\n\n01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.720\nThat's what I'm talking about.\n\n01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:23.720\nLike, he's not a bad guy.\n\n01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.720\nYou know, he's a good guy.\n\n01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:32.720\nBut with the people who are only listening to this can't see is how turned on told me is right now.\n\n01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:43.720\nI had that one in the chamber and I was like, this is going to be the easiest call back.\n\n01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:47.720\nBut there's other days that there's good stories.\n\n01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:52.720\nSo she actually had a really good story that happened not too long ago, the racetrack.\n\n01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:53.720\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:56.720\nSo I'm part of a race team.\n\n01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:59.720\nI don't know if anyone's ever heard of Chuck Waller Raceway.\n\n01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:00.720\nIt's way out in Desert Center.\n\n01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.720\nIt's a private racetrack.\n\n01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.720\nWe do private race teams.\n\n01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:08.720\nNot even three weeks ago, I was out there.\n\n01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.720\nIt's usually super boring.\n\n01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:14.720\nWe lay there or we sit there waiting for something.\n\n01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.720\nThat was a union rule.\n\n01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:17.720\nWe lay there.\n\n01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:21.720\nWe sit there.\n\n01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:25.720\nThe stretchers are only for the clients.\n\n01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:26.720\nThis is true.\n\n01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:27.720\nVery true.\n\n01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:29.720\nYeah.\n\n01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.720\nSo we were just sitting there waiting.\n\n01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:37.720\nWe wait for people to go down on their motorcycles or crash their cars into the different towers.\n\n01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:39.720\nWhich is exactly what the audience is waiting for.\n\n01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:40.720\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:41.720\nYeah.\n\n01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:42.720\nSo we're sitting there waiting.\n\n01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:47.720\nAnd like most of the day, it was biker down, riders down.\n\n01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:48.720\nOkay, rider popped back up.\n\n01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.720\nBack on his bike.\n\n01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:50.720\nLet's go.\n\n01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:53.720\nSo we hear rider down, second rider down.\n\n01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:54.720\nOkay, wait.\n\n01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:56.720\nFirst rider's up.\n\n01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:57.720\nOh, shit.\n\n01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:58.720\nSecond rider's not moving.\n\n01:01:58.720 --> 01:01:59.720\nSorry.\n\n01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:00.720\nCan I say that?\n\n01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.720\nSo second rider's not moving.\n\n01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:09.720\nHe just said nunchucks out of a man's life.\n\n01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:10.720\nTrue, true.\n\n01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.720\nYeah, no, you can say anything you want.\n\n01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:13.720\nOkay.\n\n01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:16.720\nSo we hear second rider's not getting up.\n\n01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:24.720\nSo we flip on our license arenas, shoot across the racetrack, get to him and he's laying face down.\n\n01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.720\nAnd we're like, oh crap.\n\n01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:27.720\nOkay.\n\n01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:28.720\nWell, we actually have to work today.\n\n01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:29.720\nYay.\n\n01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:30.720\nNo, it's a lot of fun.\n\n01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.720\nBut so we...\n\n01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:35.720\nThat was a heartwarming story.\n\n01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.720\nYou were right.\n\n01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:42.720\nAt first I thought, oh, these nunchucks, that's a tough story.\n\n01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.720\nBut he went right to the heart warmer.\n\n01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.720\nShe's like, oh, I get to work today.\n\n01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:51.720\nNo, I kid the injured.\n\n01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:55.720\nI kid him because I love him.\n\n01:02:55.720 --> 01:03:02.720\nYeah, so we're like, okay, so we rock up, he's face down or whatever.\n\n01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:06.720\nWe do our normal roll him over, support his airway, support his head.\n\n01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.720\nWe start taking off his clothes.\n\n01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:10.720\nWe have special leather cutters, start taking his helmet off.\n\n01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:15.720\nAnd after taking a helmet off, we notice that he's doing a weird thing we call guppy breathing.\n\n01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:19.720\nSo basically it's...\n\n01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:21.720\nIt waits a while.\n\n01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:22.720\nOkay.\n\n01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:25.720\nWell, okay, that obviously means he's not breathing.\n\n01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.720\nCheck pulses, no pulses.\n\n01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:30.720\nSo it's just me and my partner, me and a medic.\n\n01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.720\nJust the two of us were like, crap.\n\n01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.720\nOkay, fire department's 15 minutes away.\n\n01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:38.720\nHelicopters, half an hour away.\n\n01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.720\nOkay, well, here we go.\n\n01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:45.720\nSo we cut his leathers off, begin CPR, chest compressions, breathing from.\n\n01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:49.720\nThe other rider that went down with them, unfortunately, had broke his arm.\n\n01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:53.720\nSo he's walking up with like a flimsy wrist.\n\n01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.720\nLike, guys, what do you need?\n\n01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.720\nI'm ski patrol, but I can try to help.\n\n01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:59.720\nEverybody's afraid of the T-Rex.\n\n01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:02.720\nHis name was ski patrol?\n\n01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.720\nAre they like transformers?\n\n01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:07.720\nThat's badass.\n\n01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.720\nSki patrol.\n\n01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:10.720\nSidewinder.\n\n01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:11.720\nRoll out.\n\n01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:13.720\nWheeljack.\n\n01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:21.720\nSo anyway, so we start to do these compressions on him, and we get to shock him, which, believe it or not, is a very rare thing.\n\n01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:25.720\nWhen someone has no heartbeat, we hardly ever shock them.\n\n01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:27.720\nSo we got to shock him.\n\n01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:29.720\nAfter the third shock, we feel down.\n\n01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:31.720\nHe has pulses.\n\n01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.720\nWe're like, yes, by ourselves, just two of us.\n\n01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:39.720\nNo one, probably the most rewarding thing I've had in a couple years, get him to a helicopter.\n\n01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.720\nBy the time we get him to a helicopter, he's fighting us.\n\n01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:43.720\nHe's like...\n\n01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:44.720\nFighting us is a good thing.\n\n01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.720\nThat means you're alive again and wanting to live.\n\n01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.720\nYeah, trying to...\n\n01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:49.720\nThrowing punches at you?\n\n01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:50.720\nLike, get the fuck off me?\n\n01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.720\nYes.\n\n01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:52.720\nAlso, you ruined my pants.\n\n01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.720\nYou cut my goddamn letters off.\n\n01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:55.720\nYou ruined my letters!\n\n01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:56.720\nYou wouldn't be surprised.\n\n01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:01.720\nA lot of people get really upset about us cutting their clothes off, trying to save their life.\n\n01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:05.720\nIs that in a fugue state, or are you...\n\n01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:06.720\nNo, that's just...\n\n01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.720\nOh my God, you just cut my $100 pair of pants.\n\n01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:10.720\nFuck you, what are you going to do?\n\n01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:13.720\nI want that money back for that $100.\n\n01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:18.720\nI mean, obviously the leather he had on was multi-hundred dollars, and he was fighting us away.\n\n01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:19.720\nWe get him in a helicopter.\n\n01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:22.720\nHe's still fighting them, like, leave me alone, leave me alone.\n\n01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:24.720\nSo that was extremely rewarding.\n\n01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:26.720\nYeah, so...\n\n01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:27.720\nTo actually...\n\n01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.720\nLeave me alone, leave me alone.\n\n01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:34.720\nIt was rewarding to actually make a difference for once, instead of just taking the person that stubbed their toe,\n\n01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:38.720\nor, believe it or not, woke up from a bad dream and is scared to be home alone.\n\n01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:42.720\nSo that brings to mind the question, like, what...\n\n01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:45.720\nIt seems to me that there's two things that would bring you to this job.\n\n01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:50.720\nOne is this, like, altruistic thing that's like, oh my God, I love people,\n\n01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:54.720\nwhich is why a story like that is so much more fulfilling for you.\n\n01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:59.720\nLike, I got to do the thing that I want to do today, which is actually...\n\n01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:05.720\nWhich is actually do the zappy paddles and bring somebody from dead to alive,\n\n01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:09.720\nand if I hadn't been there, they'd be dead, and now I feel good going to bed tonight.\n\n01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.720\nExactly. If the two of us weren't there, then...\n\n01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:13.720\nBut that speaks to empathy.\n\n01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:17.720\nAnd the other thing that makes you good at this job is the other thing we've seen,\n\n01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:20.720\nwhich is that you're sociopaths, like, that you...\n\n01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:25.720\nThat you guys can actually somehow, like, you can deal with that stuff without going,\n\n01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:28.720\nthis is a human being, I can't handle looking at their innards.\n\n01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:29.720\nRight.\n\n01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:34.720\nWell, 90% of our job, honestly, is transporting patients from one hospital to another.\n\n01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:36.720\nThat's 90% of our job.\n\n01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:44.720\n10% is actually going code 3 and having to show up at an emergency,\n\n01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:52.720\nand of that 10%, probably only another 5% of that is actually serious injury\n\n01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:55.720\nto a point where this is why I love my job, this is why I do it,\n\n01:06:55.720 --> 01:07:01.720\nbecause yeah, we all initially do it because we care about people or we like the job we do,\n\n01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:04.720\nbecause as we told you, we don't get paid almost anything.\n\n01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.720\nRight.\n\n01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:07.720\nI'm talking about a little bit above minimum wage.\n\n01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:08.720\nWhat?\n\n01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:09.720\nThat's it.\n\n01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:10.720\nWhich I was kind of shocked by.\n\n01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:11.720\nYeah.\n\n01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:12.720\nGood for you.\n\n01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:13.720\nGood for you.\n\n01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:14.720\nIt's the same thing.\n\n01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:17.720\nMeaning that they're doing it is, you know...\n\n01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:20.720\nYeah, this is not a job you go and get rich quick scheme.\n\n01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:23.720\nDo people, does America need more EMTs?\n\n01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:28.720\nWe need more specifically paramedics, because again, EMTs do help,\n\n01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:31.720\nbut without the paramedic, because of the scope of practice,\n\n01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:35.720\nthere are certain things we're not allowed to do, even if we know how.\n\n01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.720\nWe just, if we do it, we're losing our license.\n\n01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.720\nI did say something, because there's kind of a paramedic shortage.\n\n01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:41.720\nYes.\n\n01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:45.720\nAnd because there's money to be made, therefore, by these paramedic schools,\n\n01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:52.720\nwhich, correct me when I'm wrong, you pay $10,000 to, if you're an EMT,\n\n01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:58.720\nyou pay $10,000 like tuition to a school, do some schooling.\n\n01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:06.720\nThere's barriers between you and being a paramedic that represent money for schools\n\n01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:09.720\nthat are now rushing people into paramedic.\n\n01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:11.720\nBasically, you graduate EMT school.\n\n01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:14.720\nThe next week, they say, hey, give us $10,000.\n\n01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.720\nWe'll make you this paramedic.\n\n01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:21.720\nWhich is scary to think, because this paramedic will go through two years of school, roughly.\n\n01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:27.720\nAnd, however, if he spent no time on a rig, this guy basically has spent, or she,\n\n01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:39.720\nthis person, this person, this person now has to literally know how to help people\n\n01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:44.720\nwithout ever actually helping a person in their whole career.\n\n01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.720\nThey might not know that they're squeamish.\n\n01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:47.720\nExactly.\n\n01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:48.720\nIt's happened.\n\n01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:52.720\nThey go all the way through school, they go to their first real scene,\n\n01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:54.720\nand they're like, I can't handle this.\n\n01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.720\nBut that's where the EMTs come in.\n\n01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:59.720\nYou have EMTs like me, who've been doing this for eight years,\n\n01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:04.720\nthat take those new medics and are able to babysit them.\n\n01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:09.720\nBut you're the nurse to their doctor, and now you're more qualified than them.\n\n01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:10.720\nExactly.\n\n01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:13.720\nSo, Trump's going to take care of this, right?\n\n01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:16.720\nHe's going to, he's a businessman.\n\n01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:21.720\nHe'll build a wall to put around the bodies.\n\n01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:27.720\nIf he could put a bigger wall between paramedic and EMT, like maybe that would help, I don't know.\n\n01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:30.720\nYeah, I mean, the whole thing is, I get it, you know, everybody has to make their money.\n\n01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:34.720\nWe have to, you know, pay to, you've got to pay to be in a certain profession,\n\n01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:37.720\nno matter what profession it is, like originally I wanted to be an actor.\n\n01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:40.720\nThere's still money I've got to pay to go to school and do that.\n\n01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:47.720\nHowever, the point is, is just, yes, it's those provisions put in the place where you have to do usually a thousand hours\n\n01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:50.720\nof being at EMT before you can even become a paramedic,\n\n01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:55.720\nand that's really important for the safety of the population as well as the safety of us.\n\n01:09:55.720 --> 01:10:00.720\nAnd again, it's, you know, it's not a pity party to say that,\n\n01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:05.720\nyeah, we would like some more money in this and that, but again, we do our jobs because we enjoy them.\n\n01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.720\nHowever, you know, we have our bad days too.\n\n01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:12.720\nYeah, even today, unfortunately, one of my divisions, which guys, this is really important,\n\n01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:17.720\nI bring it up because it's sad to me, but we watched it the other day,\n\n01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.720\nand sure enough today, things went wrong.\n\n01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:23.720\nWhen we go code three, guys, pull over, please pull over.\n\n01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:24.720\nTo the left, please.\n\n01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:25.720\nCode three means lights and sirens.\n\n01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:27.720\nCode three means lights and sirens because today,\n\n01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:29.720\nWait, what does pull over to the left mean?\n\n01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:30.720\nThat seems important.\n\n01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:31.720\nPull to the left side of the road.\n\n01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:33.720\nDo not pull to the right because we drive.\n\n01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:34.720\nI think you're getting that backwards.\n\n01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:35.720\nOh, sorry, correction, sorry.\n\n01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:38.720\nAre you sure you're not a dick?\n\n01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:42.720\nPark perpendicularly perpendicular to the road.\n\n01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.720\nPull to the right.\n\n01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:48.720\nPull to the right side of the road because we drive on the left side of the road.\n\n01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:50.720\nYeah, just like you see any cops or anything else,\n\n01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:52.720\nand please just double check your mirrors.\n\n01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:58.720\nUnfortunately today, a SUV went head on with one of my division's rigs,\n\n01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:01.720\nand we had to fly out our paramedic,\n\n01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:05.720\nand they were already on a, I said, code three going to a scene,\n\n01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.720\nand unfortunately they had to be flown out to a trauma center.\n\n01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:10.720\nSo that also means the scene they were going to,\n\n01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.720\nthey had to, took longer for them to get there,\n\n01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:14.720\nbecause they had to send a second ambulance,\n\n01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:16.720\nalong with an ambulance to the accident.\n\n01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:19.720\nYeah, that's, that's the system.\n\n01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:20.720\nYou okay?\n\n01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:22.720\nI have a horrible joke.\n\n01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:23.720\nGo ahead.\n\n01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:28.720\nI just don't know if you guys show pictures of that paramedic at the party.\n\n01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:31.720\nYeah.\n\n01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.720\nThat's going to be up to the paramedic.\n\n01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:35.720\nOr is that like too personal?\n\n01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:37.720\nUnderstand, whenever we show pictures,\n\n01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:40.720\nwe make sure first and foremost that,\n\n01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.720\nbecause of the HIPAA laws and stuff,\n\n01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:45.720\nwe don't state names, we don't take pictures of the person's face and stuff like that.\n\n01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:47.720\nSo usually it's nothing identifying.\n\n01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.720\nUsually it's the wreckage of the car.\n\n01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:50.720\nYeah.\n\n01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.720\nOr, yeah, or if it's a body part that's by itself,\n\n01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:54.720\nyou really can't tell who that is, but.\n\n01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.720\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:00.720\nBut the, the.\n\n01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.720\nYou ever see somebody just dick fly off?\n\n01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:05.720\nYou should see.\n\n01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:07.720\nActually yes, actually yes.\n\n01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:09.720\nJust their dick.\n\n01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:11.720\nOkay, let's be clear.\n\n01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:12.720\nLet's be clear.\n\n01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:14.720\nI work in Palm Springs, so.\n\n01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:15.720\nDicks are flying.\n\n01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:17.720\nYes.\n\n01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:20.720\nThe dick mutilation capital of the world.\n\n01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.720\nYes, so.\n\n01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:25.720\nDick injuries are very common for me.\n\n01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:30.720\nI'm kind of curious about your own personal injuries.\n\n01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:34.720\nDo you guys ever like, like, like if you, if you are the way you are,\n\n01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:37.720\nand you're, and you're able to be comfortable with other people's injuries,\n\n01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:40.720\ndoes that make you a little bit like a super person?\n\n01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:45.720\nLike if you're working on a bandsaw and you lose your pinky, are you less dizzy?\n\n01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:47.720\nActually, knock on wood.\n\n01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:49.720\nI've never broken a bone in my body.\n\n01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:54.720\nAnd as far as injuries go, yeah, I, I look at myself and I say, you know, hey,\n\n01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.720\nyou know, pain's going to come, things happen.\n\n01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:59.720\nBut if you're telling me, yeah, if I, uh, bandsaw in my hand,\n\n01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:01.720\nno, I'm screaming like a little girl.\n\n01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:02.720\nOh my God!\n\n01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:04.720\nFour little boys.\n\n01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:09.720\nNon-stop.\n\n01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:11.720\nI'm screaming like a baby.\n\n01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:14.720\nBut what about your kids?\n\n01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:15.720\nYou had two kids, right?\n\n01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:16.720\nI have three total.\n\n01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:17.720\nThree total.\n\n01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:19.720\nSo one of each.\n\n01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:23.720\nWait, I didn't hear.\n\n01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:24.720\nThis is true.\n\n01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.720\nWait.\n\n01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.720\nI'm going to actually need to go back over that afterwards.\n\n01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:35.720\nThat, that, but have they, have they, have they, have they,\n\n01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:37.720\nhave they, have they, can't ever like just fall it on their face\n\n01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:39.720\nor like just blood and everything and like.\n\n01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:44.720\nActually, the, uh, first time that I've ever had to do anything that was,\n\n01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:49.720\num, medically, uh, induced help was my first, uh, child,\n\n01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:53.720\nme being the wonderful father I am, I was a county change on the bed\n\n01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:56.720\nand he got a hold of a quarter when I walked out of the room\n\n01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:59.720\nand, uh, swallowed the quarter partially.\n\n01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:03.720\nAnd I had to do, uh, backthrest and kind of the Heimlich maneuver\n\n01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:07.720\nwhile he's actively vomiting everywhere.\n\n01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:11.720\nAnd that's the only thing that kept me happy is if he's vomiting,\n\n01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:13.720\nthere's, there's airway.\n\n01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:17.720\nSo, but eventually a quarter popped out before we had to go to the hospital.\n\n01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:18.720\nSo, Holy smokes.\n\n01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:19.720\nVery thankful for that.\n\n01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:23.720\nAnd, um, that's the only thing I've done so far.\n\n01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:26.720\nI, I, I, I, I, I, I, so Starburn's, my studio, we, we had, uh, Dino and I\n\n01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:31.720\nhad lunch with, uh, uh, our, uh, C, CFO, our, uh, head accountant,\n\n01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:36.720\nuh, uh, uh, Pleasant Mormon fellow who is, uh, we had hired who,\n\n01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.720\nwho, to, to, to, to turn our business around for us.\n\n01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:42.720\nAnd, and we were, we were talking to him about, uh, uh, uh, uh,\n\n01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:47.920\nuh, uh, you know, uh, oh, we should, we should get health benefits for all the\n\n01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:50.640\neverybody. And it's so great that you're here. Thank you so much. And then he\n\n01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:55.520\nstarted choking on his, uh, skirt steak, uh, that he was eating. And Dino and I\n\n01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:01.480\njust kind of like sat there. It was like, it was like an out of body\n\n01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:04.800\nexperience, but with it where you don't like, I wasn't doing, I was looking at\n\n01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:10.200\nmyself doing nothing. He was like, why are you choking on my dinner table? Stop\n\n01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:13.760\nthat. We did, in the seventies, it seemed like there was a movement to like\n\n01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:16.680\nteach people about the Heimlich, you know, there was like a big movement.\n\n01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:21.400\nThis is like, like, like this is like, you know, it's like, is there anything you\n\n01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:25.320\ncould just verbally impart to me when I said, I, because I know the general idea\n\n01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:30.440\nis, I know I shouldn't sit there, but, but, but, but like, like, like, I mean, I\n\n01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:35.440\ndon't know, like, did he die? You never finished. No, he just, he stood up out of\n\n01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:43.440\nthe booth. Dino and I were still sitting. We were so slow in reacting that the bar\n\n01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:50.080\ntender at little Dom's made it all the way around the bar and said, are you okay\n\n01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:55.720\nas he finally barfed up a little piece of steak onto the floor? And Dino and I\n\n01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:01.080\nwere still sitting. And I just look about, I was like, that's the day I learned I'm a\n\n01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:05.520\nfucking horrible, like, I'm just like, like, like, I got to change something, but I, I,\n\n01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:11.920\nI won't, right? Like, I'll, my only, I don't want to be, I was just like, I didn't, I\n\n01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:18.640\ndidn't do anything. But that's like, this is the, what the Marvel universe is. Like,\n\n01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:24.600\nit's 100% weaknesses, but one power, one gender power. And that's, yeah, I have the\n\n01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:30.840\nability to proclaim myself feminist. That's it. If a woman is choking, I'll just\n\n01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:36.520\nbe like, I don't know what to tell you. If they, if they have a historic election dangled\n\n01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:41.800\nin front of them and then snatched away, I'll just be like, all right, take it easy.\n\n01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:46.360\nI think I told the story before, but I almost died on a corn dog at Wienerschnitzel in high\n\n01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:50.840\nschool. And, and I was like, Oh, fuck it. This is how I die. I die on a fucking corn\n\n01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:55.440\ndog. Cause I was trying to get a bite of the corn dog and I bit too much and the guy did\n\n01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:58.960\na joke of giving me more than I wanted. So I got the whole corn dog and I bit it off and\n\n01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:04.600\nnow I got a corn dog in my throat and I just, I'm, and everyone just sat there and I'm\n\n01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:08.360\ndying and I can't breathe at all. And you can't swallow it. It's not coming back up.\n\n01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:12.440\nThere's no way to get a hand on it. And my friend Brandon Morgan, who we call Bam Bam\n\n01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:15.760\nbecause he was just really strong. All right. He just fucking picked me up by the ankles\n\n01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:24.520\nand shook it on out. He fucking, he got it done.\n\n01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:30.640\nHow tall was Bam Bam? I was you by the ankles. No, I was little. I was like five foot four\n\n01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:37.440\nwhen I was like a freshman in high school. Bam Bam, everything. He was my best friend.\n\n01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:42.760\nEverything on my shitty Volkswagen Shirako, my 81 Shirako. It was, I love that car. It\n\n01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:46.560\nwas a piece of garbage and everything on the passenger side because Bam Bam was always\n\n01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:49.800\nin there. Everything was broken. He would just close the door and the handle will come\n\n01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:55.720\noff in his hand. All the knobs and anything that he could touch on his side was off. So\n\n01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:58.960\nwe had to get in and out of that side of the car like the General Lee. Like you had to\n\n01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:06.720\nfuck it. All right. Well, Alan and Katrina, thank you so much for sharing your, your lives\n\n01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:14.920\nwith us. So you're living together and there's a will they won't they going on there, but\n\n01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:24.040\nit's not, it's the living situation comes down to California prices. Yeah, but it's\n\n01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:27.120\njust amazing. I was talking to the green room and I became kind of ashamed of myself because\n\n01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:30.840\nI'm like, you guys watching Westworld and like your answer was like, it had so much\n\n01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:36.360\nto do with like, well, once a year when HBO is, is has a package for $10 less, like we\n\n01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:40.360\nsaid, it's like, you guys are living hand to mouth and you're, then you're just showing\n\n01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:44.280\nup whenever everybody else who's like, you know, I don't know, it's just kind of fucked\n\n01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:47.880\nup. Like we should pay teachers more. We should pay cops more. We should pay EMTs more. We\n\n01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:53.040\nshould pay everybody more. But like, like, like, you know, I don't know, maybe, maybe\n\n01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:56.040\nwe can have some Harmontown scholarship to make sure you guys make it to the paramedic\n\n01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:02.760\nlevel where I'm sure it's like $8 an hour. Right. I'll, I'll, I'll, we'll, we'll, we'll,\n\n01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:08.520\nwe'll figure it out. I feel like I might put more into the Big Bang Theory slot machine\n\n01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:14.120\nthan you guys need to like, like get up there. There was a, there was a Kickstarter that happened\n\n01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:17.960\nbecause somebody stole your glass that, that Jane made. Like, it was like, like, what,\n\n01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:23.640\nwe should do Kickstarter for just people that, that, that don't barf when they see your dick\n\n01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:32.320\nfly off. Yes, we should. We should. That's kind of a rough pitch, but you got, you got\n\n01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:37.080\nthe idea. Yeah. So, so everybody pull over when you, when you, when you, for, for ambulance\n\n01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:44.080\npull over to the left and the right. Just do a series of figure eights. Even if you, even\n\n01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:48.360\nif you just at least stop, just stop, just let us move around you, go around you, something\n\n01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:51.960\nof that nature. I'll start stopping when you start spelling words in the right direction.\n\n01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:58.960\nRight. Fucking spelling ship backwards. They're anticipating your backwards viewing of it.\n\n01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:06.320\nRight. All right. Well, so, so, so if you guys don't mind saying goodbye to the, let's\n\n01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:16.320\nthank Katrina and Alan. You can go back in the, in the, in the holding tank. I'm not\n\n01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:24.320\nvery good at running the show. That was great. There's more people I wanted to meet. Is\n\n01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:29.600\na, I can't believe we missed 9-11 when we had EMGs out here. That was sad. I saw it.\n\n01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:34.600\nI saw it, but you saw, you son of a bitch. You just issued that much restraints. Yeah.\n\n01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:40.960\nThat was a missed opportunity. He'll be fine. Speaking of 9-11, you know, I was at the Las\n\n01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:48.080\nVegas airport today and the TSA like slowed to a crawl and like detained Cody and I and\n\n01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:52.360\nlike, I was getting so cranky and like, I was, I'm going to miss the show and I'm so\n\n01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:57.080\npissed. Fuck it's TSA. Fuck the TSA. These fucking assholes like, look at them like,\n\n01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:02.360\nlike blah, blah, blah. But it turns out like, like we were slowed down because both Cody\n\n01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:11.600\nand I were carrying knives from Death Valley that I bought, I bought, I bought at a store\n\n01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:16.120\na knife that said Cody and a knife that said Dan and we had them in our luggage and they\n\n01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:23.880\ngot both of us. And I was like, we had flown from Los Angeles to Las Vegas with those knives.\n\n01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:28.640\nSo congratulations Las Vegas TSA. I like, you went from being my least favorite people\n\n01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:32.600\nto because I don't want to be on a plane. If you can get on there with a knife, I didn't\n\n01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:37.440\nknow I had the knife. I had fucking knives. Anyways, wait, did you lose them? Did you\n\n01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:40.800\nhave to surrender your knife? Yeah, I had to throw them away. I mean, they had $10\n\n01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:47.320\nknives, but you can, but I mean, come on. It's all terrible. The knives were 10 bucks\n\n01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:52.320\nat a gift store and you know, I don't know.

This show\n\n01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:38.120\nhas become my character. It's become a Charles Manson's shark tank. Yes. What I'm proposing\n\n01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:46.880\nis this one, I guess.

I was not. I was not uncomfortable until just now. He's already\n\n01:27:54.360 --> 01:28:00.080\nI was like, thank God I'm still here. The paramedics leave.

Nobody cares about you on the\n\n01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:21.160\nshow, but I love your show. That's that's just a carryover from him. That's okay. I still\n\n01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:29.600\nhave my slab wife. Yes. Yes. You call her that, not me. You call her slab lady. No,\n\n01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:33.960\nI don't. You call her slab lady.

Why would\n\n01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:43.720\nthey call her that? She didn't like laying on slabs all the time. You're right. Yeah.\n\n01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:47.960\nYou I distracted. You're right. There should not have been a guy. No, no, no, no, no. You\n\n01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:54.040\nare watching my dream. My dream is doing this as you go. No, no, no, no.

It sounds and my bus broke down on the way to the airport.\n\n01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:03.680\nThe number of times you probably went through this show on the journey, right over and over\n\n01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:08.040\nand none of them on the plane going like that. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. People are\n\n01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:12.320\ngoing to say this and not one of them had this guy in your dream. Oh yeah. He announces\n\n01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:16.840\nyou and I love you. Sean. I'm like, fuck, fuck that guy. And he said, you said the story\n\n01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:20.760\nabout 20 minutes ago and I'm thinking, oh my God, great. And then he brings paramedics\n\n01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:28.760\nout and I'm like, I can't compete with paramedics. EMT. Sorry. Sorry. Yeah. Let's get into it.\n\n01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:33.360\nYou want to get into it? Well, yes. All right. All right. What, what, how did this come about\n\n01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:40.600\nthen? What qualified John here? Oh, so in case anyone else is also interested in this kind\n\n01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:45.640\nof thing, you could just tweeted us. No, don't say that. Don't say that. This is what happened.\n\n01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:52.600\nSo he tweeted at us and now he's here. Right. I don't know. He tweeted and I would say the\n\n01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:57.480\nadverb, hopefully it's not an offensive adverb incessantly. You tweeted incessantly.\n\n01:29:57.480 --> 01:30:06.400\nHere, here, here. I'll just hold you. Oh, yeah. Put it in front of him. He's not necessary.\n\n01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:10.560\nCareful with that. He's like a, he's like a dead body in the back of one of his scenes\n\n01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:17.560\nright there. Needlessly hostile. I'm on the edge of my fucking seat right now. I have\n\n01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:24.560\nno idea. I have no idea what on earth is happening. All right. He's a crazy person. He's going\n\n01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:35.680\nto kill all of us. All right. Oh, no. Fuck your dreams. I fuck your dreams. Where's my\n\n01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:42.560\nlist of things I need from Dan at the end. I think that's a mind map. Sorry. All right.\n\n01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:48.560\nI'm sorry. Okay. The first thing everybody has to remember, human party on Facebook,\n\n01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:53.920\nhuman party on Facebook. I'm starting a new political party. Okay. So third, a political\n\n01:30:53.920 --> 01:31:01.100\nthird party. Yes, go ahead. Central to your, that's central to your platform is it needs\n\n01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:06.480\nto be a third party. Yes. Okay. Continue. That's all right. These are the things we're\n\n01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:11.000\ngoing to go do. Oh my God. I've been sitting over there and now it's all gone, Dan. Oh,\n\n01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:18.240\nwell, okay. Well, all right. What I need here is my goal, Dan is I'm, these are the things\n\n01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:21.960\nwe're going to do. These are the, the platform I've given him because he and I are discussing\n\n01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:28.800\nit seriously. But here's the key for you is we live in a culture of personality. We have\n\n01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:33.600\nfor a long time, even before Trump, my friends have been sick of hearing about it for 20 years,\n\n01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:39.440\n20 years. I've been a socialist Democrat. I believe these things. I am really doing\n\n01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:48.440\nthis because you know, my son is 17 and I would say he's ashamed of me. He's known my\n\n01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:56.480\nentire life that I've wanted to fix this country. Yes. I love that guy. That's start\n\n01:31:56.480 --> 01:32:01.000\nit won't happen. It won't happen. No, no, 10 years out here. I don't know what that's\n\n01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:05.240\naccomplishing, by the way. So yeah, I don't want to bore you guys. And I'm sorry, Dan.\n\n01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:10.240\nDan just was kind of questioning whether this was serious because I sounded like a dork.\n\n01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:13.840\nYou know, he's like, what's this going to be? It is serious. Here's what I need you for,\n\n01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:21.040\nDan is I am going to tell stars. I'm going to start Twitter Wars with stars. You were\n\n01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:27.200\nmy first domino. Twitter my concept. Wait, Twitter Wars. Yeah. Okay. Well, let's let's\n\n01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:33.160\nexplore that. Okay. What do these Twitter Wars do? Okay, what? So we live in a world\n\n01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:39.600\nof Twitter. Yeah, yeah. Okay, Trump proved it. Sure. I think stars are part of the problem.\n\n01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:44.040\nThe ultra liberal stars think that something's being accomplished by them getting likes on\n\n01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:48.560\ntheir tweets are by them throwing a dinner for someone. And I've got a list of 20 stars.\n\n01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:54.520\nI think I handed it to you that that it's okay. It's okay. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:58.040\nI know I'm sorry guys. I'm sorry. Again, this might pay off with throw up everywhere.\n\n01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:06.440\nOh, it'll pay off. No, don't do it. Don't. Oh, it's too early. Oh, no. All right. Number\n\n01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:14.280\none, voting holiday election reform. But number two, no, go back to the Twitter Wars. So one\n\n01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:18.600\nof the problems you're solving up here is your son being embarrassed or hating you. What\n\n01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:22.760\nwas that? No, no. Okay, you ready? Well, no, I also, we're fixing that tonight. I want\n\n01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:28.280\nsocialist Democrats. I want to fix the world. My son has just heard about this for his entire\n\n01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:33.120\nlife. You know, when it's like I said, I had to get a normal job. I work a union job. I\n\n01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:40.280\nwork check to check just to get everybody to know what I gave you the pen, right? Oh\n\n01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:49.040\nmy God. All right. Hey, if they gave awards for Comptroller's, you would get. So I need.\n\n01:33:49.040 --> 01:34:00.640\nAll right. So what are the Twitter Wars? Okay, Spencer, they're supposed to energize\n\n01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:07.160\nthese celebrities by sharing it. Here it is. Shame and hope. Yes, here it is. And it's\n\n01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:17.760\ntwo great tastes that go great together through shame and hope. Absolutely. I love you. You\n\n01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:31.360\ngot hope in my name. You got shame in my hope. You're getting to you're getting. I need him\n\n01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:35.360\nfor my music. No, no, you're you're building an implement. It's like, oh, no, you can't\n\n01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:43.320\ndo it. Number one. So all right, we really got to get through. Yeah, we don't have to\n\n01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:48.360\nget through the list. The most important thing is the first thing, everybody. Colt was elected.\n\n01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:51.840\nWell, Colt the personality I need your help with. Maybe we can talk so I don't bore. Trump's\n\n01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:57.160\nmore popular than Dan. No, no, it's fine. What is the problem is, is these stars need\n\n01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:01.320\neither put up or shut the fuck up. I'm going to go with these people. Bill Maher is our\n\n01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:15.000\nnext shot. No, no. No, no, no. We just need number one. Just number one. Okay, so the\n\n01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:20.720\nkey is everybody remember, you're going to hear it all the time. Only 26% of the people\n\n01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:27.880\nelected Trump, 26% or 47% of the motherfuckers all stayed home and just don't care. But then\n\n01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:31.800\nthey bitch every day. Sure. I'm afraid to ask for, you know, an audience participation\n\n01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:38.680\nof who didn't. I'll be participation. All right. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.\n\n01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:42.280\nWhat we're going to do first thing, I'm going to get all these stars to run on this. All\n\n01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:46.000\nright, we got to get through this. No, we don't have to get through. No, we need to.\n\n01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.840\nNo, we need us to get through this. No, we can't. They will know they don't know we're\n\n01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:55.960\nmaking it happen until you stop making it happen. We got to keep it going. I fucking\n\n01:35:55.960 --> 01:36:01.560\nlove you. Just keep it going. I love you. I just need you to say more words on the subject.\n\n01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:10.920\nAll right, here we go. Number one. Oh, you want. Okay, I feel like I all right. We can't\n\n01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:14.640\njump around. All right. All right, America works. It's going to solve all the problems.\n\n01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:18.560\nWe're going to get free college and pick stakes, but you can't go there. Okay, at this point,\n\n01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:23.080\nI think we have some ideas. Your platforms, your third party, you're coming, you're going\n\n01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:28.520\nto fix everything. And then everyone will love it. Love it. Right. So there's this,\n\n01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:34.160\nyou know, this South Park sketch, these underpants gnomes, they're like step one, collect underpants,\n\n01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:40.760\nstep two, step three profit. That's the problem I'm having here. The step two involves create\n\n01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:47.480\na third party, infiltrate the two party system, which, which by the way, the two parties control\n\n01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:52.520\nthe electoral system and the voting system. So if you wanted to make voter change, you'd\n\n01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:57.420\nactually have to, you'd have to join the parties because those are the people who vote on the\n\n01:36:57.420 --> 01:37:02.600\nvoting laws. So you literally could not affect voting reform. If you were a third party,\n\n01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:06.320\nyou'd have to join the Republicans and the Democrats and get both of those parties to\n\n01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:10.960\nchange their voting. And you'd need to do that before you can have a viable third party\n\n01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:16.560\nin the first place. So I feel like even all your policies are what I'd consider standard\n\n01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:20.320\nsocial policies that are very helpful and very good, but they're good. Yeah, but they're\n\n01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:25.800\nnot going, I agree, but you can't, but without this first step, you can't enact any of that.\n\n01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:30.880\nAnd that's, that's like asking like, that's like saying, okay, I got this plan, delivery\n\n01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:35.440\nstuff, all I have to do is fly and then I could deliver all these packages. It'll be\n\n01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:40.960\neasy, but that's really hard in that, in, in our Twitter interaction. And today there's\n\n01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:45.840\nbeen not, it's been completely glossed over in a way that I think we have to, you know,\n\n01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:49.640\ncome to terms with before we can really go forward because I think we can all agree that\n\n01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:51.440\nit's important to make the world better.\n\n01:37:51.440 --> 01:38:02.520\nOkay. I got my hand up and you're 100% right. Yes. No, I am. Except, except it can be done\n\n01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:07.960\nthrough the Senate if I can get four to six seats. And if some of those seats are famous\n\n01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:13.800\npeople, 46 Congress, no, four to six, right? Four to six, four to six. So let's say six\n\n01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:21.520\nseats. 126 seats. You're on the ball. That was better than you guys reacted to. Good\n\n01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:28.600\njoke, Jeff. Okay. This is what I'm counting on is if I can get some people involved that\n\n01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:33.440\ncan make some noise that will be listened to sadly, just because they're stars, we will\n\n01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:37.800\nbe able to disrupt the Senate because the Senate's the key. What Bernie did wrong and\n\n01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:42.240\nI love Bernie and I hate Bernie. He took my plan and ruined it. You can't do it. You're\n\n01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:46.560\nright. You're right about, you can't do it on a presidential basis, but the Senate is\n\n01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:51.960\na place because of the way the Senate works. Four to six seats could stop everything till\n\n01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:56.280\nwe get that. So how many votes does it take to get one seat? Like how many people would\n\n01:38:56.280 --> 01:39:01.160\nit take to vote a Senate seat? Now, this is the great part. It has to happen on 2018.\n\n01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:05.640\nI think you got this whole room. First of all, these people were all, I don't think so.\n\n01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:09.600\nI think they just want me to shut the fuck up. Oh, you got that? You got that from him?\n\n01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:14.760\nYeah. I think, but it's not going to happen till he says so because thank you, Dan. Thank\n\n01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:18.000\nyou. Well, I'm not, I'm not going to say, it's not evening at the Apollo. I'm not going\n\n01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.280\nto have like somebody sweep you off the stage. I'm not going to go through this whole thing.\n\n01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:25.280\nThis has been a long show. And if crazy people weren't allowed on this stage, where would\n\n01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:31.400\nwe stop? Right? Right? Like where would we stop enforcing that rule? Right? I like people\n\n01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:35.240\nthinking like, like, I gotta be thinking about this stuff. Well, Dan, exactly. I'd rather\n\n01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:39.480\nhave these conversations and not happen. So, so anyways, why am I getting, why am I just\n\n01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:42.840\nidentifying myself to you? Keep telling us your political plan. Okay, well, let's concentrate\n\n01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:46.560\non the important part. Yes, it's very important because this is what we've been fighting\n\n01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:51.400\nabout him and I, you're one of the people, Dan, that I can't say to you because I love\n\n01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:54.920\nyou too much, but you're at, we're at the point, you hate what's going on as much as\n\n01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:59.360\nme, where it's time for people in your position to put up or shut up to either get the fuck\n\n01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:05.600\nout of it or get into it. And all I'm going to be telling people on my list is work part\n\n01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:10.080\ntime for a couple of years. You can still tour, you can still do shit, and you can still\n\n01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:15.800\nbe a senator. You can do it and they will listen to them. You want me to be a senator?\n\n01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:21.640\nNo, no, no, no. He wants, okay. No. He wants Natalie Portman to be a senator. No, no, no.\n\n01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:25.040\nDan? He wants Natalie Portman to be a senator or something. Something like that. Oh, and\n\n01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:29.640\nhe's using me to get to Natalie Portman. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wait, wait, you're, I don't think\n\n01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:31.640\nyou can get me to Natalie Portman. Didn't you see the bubble chart on the last page?\n\n01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:35.840\nNo, you're using me to get to Will Wheaton and Will Wheaton. Oh, wait, here we go. Hold\n\n01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:40.640\non. Ready? I, I, for one, this is how, hey, Dan, I don't know. I'm hoping for better.\n\n01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:46.480\nI'm using you for Ackerman, Proups, Paul F. Thompson. You're going to use, you're going\n\n01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:55.480\nto, you're going to build from me to Ackerman? Get the fuck out of here. You just said you're\n\n01:40:55.480 --> 01:41:02.480\nnot going to kick people off. I'm not getting drawn into this. But that almost did it. You're\n\n01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:07.040\ngoing to Ackerman. No. Senator Ackerman, you have the floor. No. No, sorry. Ackerman's\n\n01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:11.760\non tour right now. He committed 20%. Would Senator Natalie Portman please keep it down\n\n01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:16.960\nfor a moment? Thank you. Now, Dan, I, I just, I, I have dreams. You could get me to Clooney,\n\n01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:21.760\nbut I just didn't want to jump too far. Okay. Right. I, but, okay. So, but I, I've been in\n\n01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:25.520\nthis situation before where people, yeah, yeah. Well, so you're, I mean, you know, you know\n\n01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:29.200\nthat. I know that. And I'm not saying through, I'm not saying through a holiday party, invite\n\n01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:32.720\nme so I can board it. I don't think he knows. You should explain that because maybe he doesn't\n\n01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:35.040\nunderstand. Well, of course it's insulting. Like it's a very, you know, like, like, look,\n\n01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:40.640\nI'd be the, well, it would be very hypocritical of me to decry narcissism. But you clearly,\n\n01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:44.880\nthat's the way the world works. You have this agenda. You don't care about, you know, like,\n\n01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:50.720\nlike, like, you, I, like, I have this pulpit. You have an opportunity to connect with these\n\n01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:57.680\npeople. I've given you their time. And you're, you're, like, all we've heard so far is, is\n\n01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:02.000\nthat you're hoping to get as many famous people as possible to build up to something.\n\n01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.240\nYeah. I'm just saying this aboard them, but you're also like, it seems a little bit like\n\n01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:09.520\nyou've learned, you've learned what to do by watching Trump.\n\n01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:13.160\nOh my God. I had this, and this drives me crazy. I've been telling my friends and they\n\n01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:17.080\nall know because they've listened to this for so many years. And I was so worried. I\n\n01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:20.280\nsaid, you know what everybody's going to say, baby, is they're all going to say, I'm reacting\n\n01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:23.840\nto Trump. Right. No, I had the, I decided to run. No, I think it's good to react to\n\n01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:27.840\nTrump, but I don't think he's overreacting to Trump. I just don't think you should emulate\n\n01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:32.440\nhim necessarily. And it's, I wish it wasn't the case, but our society is a cult of personality\n\n01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:36.480\nand you know it as well as anybody. Cause maybe that's the problem. Maybe it's a problem\n\n01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:39.880\nin it, but it's going to get used one more time. Okay. Here's my analogy. I tell my friends\n\n01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:43.800\nthe cult of personality is a loaded gun in the middle of the table. Sure. The Democrats\n\n01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:47.480\nare on one side or Republicans are on the other side. They are going to use that loaded\n\n01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:54.160\ngun in 2018. Remind me why it has to be 2018. Because we got to flip the Senate. We got\n\n01:42:54.160 --> 01:43:00.600\nto flip the Senate. Okay. Wait. Okay. Hold on. Yep. Here's now. I think what you happen\n\n01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:05.760\nis this is a big conversation because we are in this post fact world and it's like Democrats\n\n01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:09.600\nhave to decide, are we going to be post truth or are we going to be truth truth? And so\n\n01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:14.360\nI think what you're talking about is valuable, but I would say that my trepidation is that\n\n01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:19.920\nRepublicans and the GOP are bathed in lies and they're bathed in dishonesty and that's\n\n01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:24.080\ntheir wheelhouse. So the idea that we're going to be able to fight on that level strikes\n\n01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:28.560\nme as kind of, I don't know. It's just cause we're noobs and they're like, you know, they're\n\n01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:34.160\nthe mob kind of, it just seems like a heart. It's unfair. We have the truth on our side.\n\n01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:37.960\nSo like we could bring that to bear, but like, I don't know that playing their tricks is\n\n01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:42.040\nlike, and that's a question I've had with myself because it might be that that's the\n\n01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:46.320\nanswer, but I feel like it seems hard. We've lost this horror. We've fought them if we\n\n01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:50.160\nlooked at their tactics and felt like, you know what they did that made them win? They\n\n01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:56.840\ngot on Twitter and they tweeted racist memes that weren't a, like, but that, and in my\n\n01:43:56.840 --> 01:44:00.040\npersonal opinion, that's the problem with the bipartisan system is that the Democrats\n\n01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:03.440\nhave already become that. They always, every four years, they always go, oh, you know what\n\n01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:08.200\nthe Republicans did? Anyways, but like, you're wearing a kilt.\n\n01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:12.960\nI say, we just, I said, we wrap, I said, you guys, this was a strategic decision. We wrap\n\n01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:16.120\nit out. I think we have to wrap this shit up. Oh, damn it. You got a fucking wrap.\n\n01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:20.680\nWell, it's, well, yeah, let's let, well, what, so you drove from Washington or you flew\n\n01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:25.040\nfrom Washington? Yeah. Okay. So what was the, what did the plane ticket cost? Maybe we\n\n01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:31.840\nno, no, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, it was too much for me, but no, no. What I want, what\n\n01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:35.320\nI need from this is I've gotten, I've gotten exposure. If people would just go to the human\n\n01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:39.720\nparty on Facebook, there's more about it. The human party on Facebook. Yeah. I, I, so\n\n01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:43.680\nit's, it's, it's a real thing. And I guess, aren't you, aren't you John worried though\n\n01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:49.880\nabout Natalie Portman's very notable stance on the state of Israel? She loves it. You\n\n01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:57.520\nknow, like, and her, and her, her hawkish foreign policy. Yeah, but she's a stepping\n\n01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:09.320\nstone to Amy Adams. Yeah. Fuck, fuck humanity. It's all just a fucking carnival. The thing\n\n01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:12.600\nthat has touched me most, Dan, is that I've known you for many years, and I didn't know\n\n01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:19.120\nyou could get me to Ockerman. Oh, no, you, I mean, not in one step, not in one step.\n\n01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:23.560\nI'm sure not in one step. No, he's got to go through one of the engineers or something.\n\n01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:31.240\nHe's got to go to the Skala brothers. Yeah. Okay. The reason all this is this way is\n\n01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:36.520\nbecause these people, your audience, they love to support crowdfunding. The only way\n\n01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:40.320\nI can do this is through crowdfunding. Right. I've seen dreams happen on your show through\n\n01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:46.280\ncrowdfunding and I will never compete with money. I can only do this if my crowdfund\n\n01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:49.600\nhits. Otherwise I have to go back to my normal job. What do you call it? What's, what, what\n\n01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:53.000\nare we going to? What's the site? It's not ready yet that because they say to be ready\n\n01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.880\nfirst. Okay, now here's your problem. No, they say to be ready first and they're going\n\n01:45:55.880 --> 01:46:00.120\nto go to the human party. And then I'm going to have the date set. Right. And then, and\n\n01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:03.360\nthat's so that I'm driving to the human party, setting the date. They say you need to have\n\n01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:07.280\nyour money lined up before you start your crowdfunding. So you're not supposed to start\n\n01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:12.680\ntoo early. Okay. Damn it. I love you so much. I'm on your side. All right. We're all on\n\n01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:20.360\nyour side. So, so the thing is, I'm actually not on your side. I'm like the devil that\n\n01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:31.120\nshowed up to destroy your dreams. And I am, I'm going to keep talking because that's horrible.\n\n01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:36.560\nBut I do think that you don't like something that's called the cult of personality. It's\n\n01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:40.680\na fact of life. Right. You don't like it, but you're using it. Like what it's the loaded\n\n01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:45.280\ngun and they're going to use it if we don't, but that is what we're looking for worse than\n\n01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:50.280\nto 2018. They're going to, what we're looking for as a humankind is an answer to problems,\n\n01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:55.040\nnot using the problems. That five list, that's the, that's the answer is that five list.\n\n01:46:55.040 --> 01:47:02.240\nYeah, but this Twitter war of yours. Believe me, I also have sort of called telephone terrorism.\n\n01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:11.560\nI read every item on this. I feel like you're using poison. I am for health. I am. And I\n\n01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:17.120\ndon't, okay. Okay. I'm going to, I'll riff a, I'll riff a pitch. Like putting my money\n\n01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:22.560\nwhere my mouth is. What if we were able to use the, the, the, the current bipartisan system,\n\n01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:29.800\nwe were able to start locally, create, you know, like, like, like, like do like a community\n\n01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:36.760\nstuff, call ourselves Democrats, but like, like, have a little asterisk on it, you know,\n\n01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:40.600\nlike, like, like, like, like we're, we're blue shield Democrats or leftists. We're, we're\n\n01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:45.080\nlong cabin Democrats, you know, we're, we're, we're people that actually care about like,\n\n01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:49.760\nlike, you know, blah, blah, blah. And we, we, we give interest free loans to, to, to\n\n01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:50.760\npeople.\n\n01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:54.480\nWe should call it like something that everyone can access, like the human party.\n\n01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:59.680\nAll right. Well, anyways, I'm not going to, I'll pitch that next episode, but, but it's\n\n01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:00.680\ngood.\n\n01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:03.080\nI thought he was just going to get, it was going to be a guy in a kilt that gave us drugs.\n\n01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:04.400\nI didn't know it was going to fucking go.\n\n01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:05.400\nWell, okay.\n\n01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:06.400\nYeah.\n\n01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:07.400\nHe was going to give us the keys to Ockerman.\n\n01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:08.400\nOckerman.\n\n01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:09.400\nWhat about proofs?\n\n01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:10.400\nI don't even know.\n\n01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:14.880\nIt doesn't even look like I'm directly like I get you to Ockerman. Oh, contact. Okay.\n\n01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:15.880\nAs goes Ockerman.\n\n01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:16.880\nSo does Ockerman.\n\n01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:20.880\nNo, okay. See, and I'm starting small because I have very little confidence in myself. I\n\n01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:22.480\ndon't think I can get Clooney yet.\n\n01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:26.480\nRight. No, I know I'm very, very insulted by all of this. Yes.\n\n01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:29.280\nOh, no, I've got, I get it.\n\n01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:31.880\nWell, who should I have mentioned? Because that's my problem.\n\n01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:32.880\nNo, you should.\n\n01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:38.800\nNo, Dan get, Dan has to be behind the scenes. Dan has to be the man. He's the heart. Dan,\n\n01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:40.160\nyou don't want to run, right?\n\n01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:41.160\nNo, I don't, I, I,\n\n01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:42.160\nNo, he doesn't.\n\n01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:49.680\nBut right now I want to run. Yeah. I want to hide. I want to, I want to duck. I want\n\n01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:50.680\nto cover.\n\n01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:51.680\nOh my God.\n\n01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:59.200\nBut it's, it's 10 o'clock, but I do like, I don't want you to be mocked and ridiculed\n\n01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:04.440\nand deflated. I think that, I think that, I think that I'm fucking crazy right now.\n\n01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:07.080\nLike, like, I feel like there's Nazis taking over the,\n\n01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:08.080\nYeah.\n\n01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:09.080\nSo let's do something about it.\n\n01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:14.320\nI'm, I'm alarmed about it. I don't, I don't, I don't, I, the, the stuff that I'm seeing\n\n01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:17.960\nwritten on your giant pads, I, everything I've seen, I don't see.\n\n01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:18.960\nThis is the key.\n\n01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:19.960\nI don't see anything that I disagree with.\n\n01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:20.960\nThis will change everything.\n\n01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:24.800\nWe definitely need to, uh, uh, election reform. We definitely need to.\n\n01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:25.800\nThis will change it all.\n\n01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:29.080\nBut, but I also agree with Spencer that, like, we have to think strategically about how.\n\n01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:32.080\nEven four to six Senate seats is a huge accomplishment.\n\n01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:36.200\nAnd it will stop everything. If there are people that get, listen, if they are listened\n\n01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:41.280\nto, if there are people that are listened to stars, sadly, it will happen. People will\n\n01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:46.600\nwatch C-SPAN to see what happens when we, when we're on the floor, they will stop to\n\n01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:50.440\nwatch. If they see that, oh my God, you got a guy from Westworld. You could ask him.\n\n01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:51.440\nRight.\n\n01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:52.440\nDo you want to run?\n\n01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:53.440\nNo.\n\n01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:54.440\nThank you.\n\n01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:55.440\nOkay.\n\n01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:58.640\nWithin three years, if you start with a friendship with him, Anthony Hopkins.\n\n01:49:58.640 --> 01:49:59.640\nOh.\n\n01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:03.680\nYou, you could quickly be in a war with Anthony Hopkins.\n\n01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:06.680\nImagine that.\n\n01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:08.680\nLet's hear from John Roswell, everybody.\n\n01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:09.680\nJohn Roswell.\n\n01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:10.680\nGo to human party.\n\n01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:11.680\nHuman party.\n\n01:50:11.680

01:53:01.120\nYeah.\n\n01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:05.120\nI've seen, I've seen a little on Instagram today at the, or maybe Facebook that Jane\n\n01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:09.120\nmay have posted of one of your little Harmontown comics is very, very cute.\n\n01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:11.120\nJane has been very sweet about it.\n\n01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:12.120\nYeah.\n\n01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:13.120\nJane's a sweetie.\n\n01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:18.120\nJane's the official, like, like she's like, like coordinating all of the fandom on Facebook.\n\n01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:19.120\nYeah.\n\n01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:25.120\nThere was a guy that was like, it was like, like, you know, having suicidal ideology.\n\n01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:27.120\nAnd then like, he was off the grid.\n\n01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:32.120\nAnd then like, like Jane, like, I'm hearing this all third hand because I can't get, I\n\n01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:34.120\ncan't get involved.\n\n01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:37.120\nI'm too busy running for Senate.\n\n01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:41.120\nBut, but, but, but, but yeah, Jane just props to Jane.\n\n01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:45.120\nI mean, change, like, change is like out there, like coordinating and I don't know.\n\n01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:50.120\nJust like there's a little family that's like ancillarily related to Harmontown that doesn't\n\n01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:53.120\neven have to have to do with whether I'm a good or a bad person.\n\n01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:58.120\nYou know, it's like, it's like, oh, we all like Cheetos and we're good people.\n\n01:53:58.120 --> 01:54:03.120\nLike Cheetos doesn't have to be good for you.\n\n01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:04.120\nI like that.\n\n01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:08.120\nYou know, it doesn't have to be a, I don't, I don't, I don't have to, if I, if I, if I\n\n01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:12.120\njoined that Facebook group, for instance, within two weeks, it would like be decimated\n\n01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:18.120\nbecause I'd be like jerk off and I'd still mad at, still mad about season four.\n\n01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:21.120\nAnd everybody'd be like, I don't like this.\n\n01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:22.120\nIt feels toxic.\n\n01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:27.120\nAnd like, yeah, I like that there could be a little, that the May poll doesn't have to be me.\n\n01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:28.120\nYeah.\n\n01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:35.120\nI mean, I, when I respond to that, I just, I made that comic like a year ago and I didn't\n\n01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:36.120\nreally know about that.\n\n01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:40.120\nAnd Jane, like, immediately like reached out to me and she was like super sweet and she\n\n01:54:40.120 --> 01:54:43.120\nwrote me this very nice message I still like think about.\n\n01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:46.120\nShe's very, um, and she got me like into that.\n\n01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:47.120\nLike I didn't, I didn't know.\n\n01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:48.120\nI didn't know.\n\n01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:50.120\nCause when I, when I was like, when Harvard town was like my lifeline, like years ago,\n\n01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:53.120\nlike I, it really felt like there were only like a few of us listening.\n\n01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:56.120\nI didn't realize there were so many people who listened to the show.\n\n01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:58.120\nWeren't you kind of down when we met you?\n\n01:54:58.120 --> 01:54:59.120\nI mean, this is like, yeah.\n\n01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:00.120\nI was like, super.\n\n01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:04.120\nI was like, we asked the, the sentiment out there, going through any pain and you, you\n\n01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:06.120\nlaid some heavy stuff on us.\n\n01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:07.120\nYeah.\n\n01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:08.120\nYou didn't

and clean and bright\n\n01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:44.120\nand shiny doesn't make you a good person.\n\n01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:47.120\nIt doesn't mean that your life is on the right track, but it's also at the same time.\n\n01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:51.120\nIt's nice to see somebody like that was down in the roller coaster.\n\n01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:52.120\nBe, be up on it.\n\n01:55:52.120 -->
