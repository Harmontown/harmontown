00:00.000 --> 00:07.800
From Hollywood, California, it is my pleasure and duty to announce that Harmontown is once

00:07.800 --> 00:12.800
again in session.

00:12.800 --> 00:23.800
Spencer Crittenden did to the stage.

00:23.800 --> 00:32.800
How's it going, buddy?

00:32.800 --> 00:33.800
I'm bad.

00:33.800 --> 00:34.800
Alright, well let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown.

00:34.800 --> 00:35.800
Shall we, Mr. Dan Harmon?

00:35.800 --> 00:36.800
Hello.

00:36.800 --> 00:37.800
Thank you.

00:37.800 --> 00:38.800
Thank you very much.

00:38.800 --> 00:39.800
So you came here from LAX.

00:39.800 --> 00:40.800
I came here from LAX.

00:40.800 --> 00:41.800
But where were you?

00:41.800 --> 00:42.800
I was in Las Vegas.

00:42.800 --> 00:43.800
What was going down on Las Vegas?

00:43.800 --> 00:52.800
Chris McKenna's birthday.

00:52.800 --> 01:01.800
I'm an awful, awful gambler, which is good because that means I never will develop a

01:01.800 --> 01:02.800
problem.

01:02.800 --> 01:06.800
I'm so bad at it that it's never fun.

01:06.800 --> 01:14.800
I just do that thing that, oh, I've lost three times in a row, so I'll bet six times

01:14.800 --> 01:19.880
as much, and then I'll break even, and I just keep doing that until $1,000 goes, which

01:19.880 --> 01:23.800
is five minutes later, and then I go get another $1,000, and then the ATM says, you

01:23.800 --> 01:27.800
can't do that, and I go, okay, I'm done gambling.

01:27.800 --> 01:28.800
What's your game?

01:28.800 --> 01:30.640
I like Blackjack the most.

01:30.640 --> 01:35.720
If I can control myself, as you know, you can sit there like, Blackjack, what you should

01:35.720 --> 01:39.600
do is just fucking follow the rules, and then you're just drinking for free, sitting at

01:39.600 --> 01:43.200
a table with some friends for maybe possibly hours and hours, and you're up, and you're

01:43.200 --> 01:47.160
down, and you're up, and you're down, and if you say in your head, okay, I'm going

01:47.160 --> 01:49.520
to lose $500, maybe, let's say.

01:49.520 --> 01:51.600
But the thing is, this was the Cosmopolitan hotel.

01:51.600 --> 01:56.800
It was like $25 minimum tables, and it's just like, that's $25, that's a half of a video

01:56.800 --> 01:57.800
game.

01:57.800 --> 02:01.480
I've heard from people there that that's not a great place to gamble.

02:01.480 --> 02:06.040
Nobody has ever had a good story of gambling and winning and having fun there.

02:06.040 --> 02:07.040
You have?

02:07.040 --> 02:08.040
Yeah.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.040
You enjoy the Cosmopolitan?

02:09.040 --> 02:15.200
I went and got $25 on the free card, and I spent it, and I won $100.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.200
Damn.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.200
All right.

02:17.200 --> 02:30.200
Well, not to be outdone, I also won $25, because I got a triple Bazinga on the Big Bang

02:30.200 --> 02:33.160
three-machine trip.

02:33.160 --> 02:35.320
Three Bazingas should be more than $25.

02:35.320 --> 02:40.920
I don't even watch that show, and I know a Bazinga is important.

02:40.920 --> 02:45.720
You got three Bazingas, and all you got was $25?

02:45.720 --> 02:46.720
Yeah.

02:46.720 --> 02:47.720
What was your coin?

02:47.720 --> 02:51.680
Well, I guess the guys that write, the slot machine, get home by $5, too.

02:51.680 --> 02:54.760
Now, still better.

02:54.760 --> 02:55.920
Why were you playing this?

02:55.920 --> 02:57.640
You were playing it ironically, I assume?

02:57.640 --> 03:02.920
Well, yeah, I guess I thought it would be hilarious if I hit a huge jackpot on the Big

03:02.920 --> 03:07.920
Bang three-machine, but I also thought it would be funny if I lost $1,000.

03:07.920 --> 03:12.560
In either case, I knew I was going to tweet Bill Prady, my friend who runs, I think is

03:12.560 --> 03:16.200
still running it, and I don't know.

03:16.200 --> 03:21.520
It's fun to have friends that are so successful that you can openly hate them.

03:21.520 --> 03:24.840
They're just going, hey, Big Bang three, suck my dick.

03:24.840 --> 03:25.840
You guys suck.

03:25.840 --> 03:30.160
They're like, we don't care, we're snorting diamonds.

03:30.160 --> 03:33.800
You can say whatever you want.

03:33.800 --> 03:37.040
There is a place, I was in Death Valley over Thanksgiving.

03:37.040 --> 03:43.160
There is a gas station slash mini-mart, actually quite a sizable establishment, and it is

03:43.160 --> 03:53.360
called Eddie World, and the logo is a photograph of a child that I am told is the deceased

03:53.360 --> 04:00.240
child of the owners, after which they named the mini-mart, and it's really weird.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.680
And that's it.

04:02.680 --> 04:03.880
I spent a lot of time.

04:03.880 --> 04:06.880
It is called Death Valley.

04:06.880 --> 04:10.640
I spent a lot of time, I don't know, I was really high and Cody was laughing, so I started

04:10.640 --> 04:14.080
recording it because I didn't want to, because I knew if I tried to do it here, she'd be

04:14.080 --> 04:18.840
like, why are you doing jokes about a dead kid?

04:18.840 --> 04:21.120
Because they're hilarious.

04:21.120 --> 04:29.640
But I did like, I'll just, I'll see if, let's see, because I started, I was coming up with

04:29.640 --> 04:52.000
jingles kind of trying, oh wait, there's a world where you don't have a sandwich in a

04:52.000 --> 05:00.800
room, where we don't have everything, because we lost the most important thing in our lives.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.600
Eddie World, do you need milk or glasses?

05:04.600 --> 05:13.280
Eddie World, our son can't come back, Eddie World, just come and get some candy, Eddie

05:13.280 --> 05:21.160
World, our whole will never be quite filled, but you take candy.

05:21.160 --> 05:30.240
I think there's something, it goes on for seven more minutes, and now you're applauding

05:30.240 --> 05:37.920
a child's death, but everybody out there voted for Trump, so I'm sure Eddie did too, or he

05:37.920 --> 05:38.920
would've, he would've.

05:38.920 --> 05:46.200
Man, speaking of child death, I was driving through a cemetery and the cemetery had all

05:46.200 --> 05:52.920
these weird street names that were all kind of noble and gravity, like heavy, it was like

05:52.920 --> 05:58.640
noble spraying and golden dawn and stuff, and I found myself on a street that was called

05:58.640 --> 06:06.960
Babyland, and that's a terrifying realization to have when you're really high in a cemetery

06:06.960 --> 06:14.880
driving around, and right at the head of Babyland was this giant statue of a baby that was kind

06:14.880 --> 06:19.680
of like, yeah, it was clearly, it was like, nope, there's definitely babies buried on

06:19.680 --> 06:26.320
this property, and then I left, it was great.

06:26.320 --> 06:33.000
Babyland, I think a lot of cemeteries have a Babyland too, I don't think that's unique.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.080
Babyland's a terrible name though, like.

06:36.080 --> 06:42.080
On the lighter side of child development, my, I guess you'd call him my pseudo nephew

06:42.080 --> 06:47.360
because I'm dating his aunt, Ryland, who maybe, if you follow my Instagram, maybe you've

06:47.360 --> 06:52.680
seen him, the president of Train Town Kid, he's four years old, and he was learning

06:52.680 --> 06:57.880
to drive on his grandpa's lap, like in Death Valley, like his grandpa was just steering

06:57.880 --> 07:07.800
with the hands on the bottom, but he was like thinking he was driving, and asked him, asked

07:07.800 --> 07:11.080
him after he finished, after he finally got tired of driving, which was an exhilarating

07:11.080 --> 07:16.120
experience for him, he said, Ryland, how do you feel, and he said, I feel like I'm five

07:16.120 --> 07:17.120
years old.

07:17.120 --> 07:23.320
It's just pretty amazing, because he wasn't being glib or ironic, he really, he didn't

07:23.320 --> 07:27.680
know how funny that was, he really was like, that's how to express, he's like, in his

07:27.680 --> 07:32.960
four-year-old mind, like being five is going to have more energy to it.

07:32.960 --> 07:38.880
I guess he's right, I guess it's not until you turn like 13 that you start dying, right?

07:38.880 --> 07:47.920
As soon as you can reach the faucet, like it's all downhill, yeah, well it's the reproductive

07:47.920 --> 07:51.640
hormones probably hit your bloodstream, and then they start killing your body, right?

07:51.640 --> 07:55.320
Because it's like, we're like mosquitoes, like nature's saying, okay, time to make more

07:55.320 --> 08:02.880
of you, or what good are you, and also if you can do that, bye, yeah, well, nobody's

08:02.880 --> 08:08.400
getting out alive, I don't know why you're so quiet.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.400
Did you enjoy your Death Valley experience?

08:09.400 --> 08:10.400
It looked like you had a lot of fun.

08:10.400 --> 08:18.280
When you laughed at Eddie's death, you had to have a chuckle at your own, wouldn't be

08:18.280 --> 08:24.320
a bad idea, karmically, I think, yeah, speaking of death, I mean, like I said, everybody out

08:24.320 --> 08:30.240
there voted for Trump, and like, it's funny because as a liberal, you're out there, like,

08:30.240 --> 08:34.920
when I got to Death Valley, I was like, oh god, this is where I need to come now that

08:34.920 --> 08:37.960
Trump got elected, but the place is filled with a bunch of people that are like, oh,

08:37.960 --> 08:41.160
this is where I need to be now that Obama got elected, like, they're just walking around

08:41.160 --> 08:45.560
with guns on their hips, and like, they've created their own little world, and like,

08:45.560 --> 08:52.520
everybody's from somewhere else, nobody, nothing is born in Death Valley, and they tried with

08:52.520 --> 09:07.240
Eddie, and he just like, yeah, the warning is in the name of the town, you don't do it.

09:07.240 --> 09:09.480
Did you know it's the hottest place on earth?

09:09.480 --> 09:12.720
You would think it's somewhere in Africa, or the Middle East, or something like, or

09:12.720 --> 09:18.280
the equator, like, it's the hottest goddamn place on earth, recorded anyway, 135 degrees,

09:18.280 --> 09:24.760
and every, the hottest day of the year, people gather and watch the temperature needle, passing

09:24.760 --> 09:32.480
out from heat stroke, and they all wait to celebrate the, if it gets up to 136, or whatever

09:32.480 --> 09:33.480
it is.

09:33.480 --> 09:35.000
Did you get that hot in Saudi Arabia, or like?

09:35.000 --> 09:39.760
Yeah, I would have thought, I would have thought, but apparently, they used to think not as,

09:39.760 --> 09:45.040
that yes, that is the case, but then there was some kind of thermometer recalibration,

09:45.040 --> 09:50.960
or something, like they were using bad thermo, they were using Chinese steel in their thermometers,

09:50.960 --> 09:52.800
over in Saudi Arabia.

09:52.800 --> 09:56.520
Chinese steel is the cologne I'm wearing right now.

09:56.520 --> 10:11.080
Eddie World, we've got everything, but Eddie!

10:11.080 --> 10:16.080
Eddie World, if we haven't got it, it's our son!

10:16.080 --> 10:27.080
Eddie World, our prices aren't just low, they're misdirected grief!

10:27.080 --> 10:30.160
Do you know, are these all written down?

10:30.160 --> 10:31.160
What?

10:31.160 --> 10:32.160
Are you riffing these?

10:32.160 --> 10:33.160
Are these all written down?

10:33.160 --> 10:38.040
I saw, I saw, I opened my notepad, I saw a couple of them.

10:38.040 --> 10:42.080
I'm terribly sorry, if I'm by, for some reason, there's somebody listening that is connected

10:42.080 --> 10:46.280
somehow to Eddie, and you're being traumatized by this, I'm operating under the assumption

10:46.280 --> 10:51.560
that that's not the case, and therefore, you know, where you are as a figure in a textbook

10:51.560 --> 10:56.800
to us, like Abraham Lincoln, whose assassination is no longer tragic, it's hilarious, he got

10:56.800 --> 11:02.080
shot in the head, brains flew everywhere, Kennedy slightly less so, and you know, time

11:02.080 --> 11:03.080
goes on.

11:03.080 --> 11:08.560
Eddie, from his picture, looked like, it probably happened a while ago, and it could be an urban

11:08.560 --> 11:09.560
legend.

11:09.560 --> 11:16.480
But when you look at it, you go, I bet that's, you kind of, it could be like, unconfirmable.

11:16.480 --> 11:17.480
Anyways.

11:17.480 --> 11:22.800
Can't you ask the owners?

11:22.800 --> 11:23.800
Who's gonna do that?

11:23.800 --> 11:28.760
I mean, like, I'm not gonna do that, plus the place is so big, like, the owners aren't

11:28.760 --> 11:34.360
even there, I mean, it was like, they had a lot of candy.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.440
I bought a lot of candy.

11:36.440 --> 11:40.720
We love candy.

11:40.720 --> 11:50.000
Since we're there, like, scraping the bottom of taste, like, there was this fire in Oakland,

11:50.000 --> 11:55.600
this terrible tragedy, this warehouse thing, and did anybody see the video, I mean, some

11:55.600 --> 12:00.520
people out here might be connected to people, I know Cody had a friend who lost two friends

12:00.520 --> 12:03.160
in that fire.

12:03.160 --> 12:12.600
There was a video of a guy who was describing, like, trying to drag his friend out, who had

12:12.600 --> 12:20.400
broken his ankle, and he was trying to drag his friend out of this inferno, and he's explaining

12:20.400 --> 12:25.200
to the news cameras, you know, I thought, I was like, oh my god, this guy's so brave

12:25.200 --> 12:29.960
and vulnerable, like, you know, who would, I mean, because he's describing the experience

12:29.960 --> 12:35.520
of trying to save his friend, and then it gets so hot, and his lungs are filling with

12:35.520 --> 12:40.920
smoke, and he had no choice but to just let go, and just walk away, like, run away, get

12:40.920 --> 12:47.200
out of there, and he couldn't drag his friend out, had to leave him there, but the guy's

12:47.200 --> 12:53.840
describing it, and he describes it, and then he goes, like, you know, obviously that's

12:53.840 --> 12:59.440
making him, like, tear up, and like, like, he's still out there, and then he, but then

12:59.440 --> 13:06.080
he says, and then I went out, and then I watched it all, all burn, all my stuff, all my, all

13:06.080 --> 13:10.880
my, all my, and he just started talking about all the things that he had in there, anyways.

13:10.880 --> 13:17.880
I just thought it was such a weird build, like, it was, like, the story about the friend,

13:17.880 --> 13:22.320
and then he was just like, he's like, my pants are in there.

13:22.320 --> 13:26.160
I know nothing about this, I've been in Mexico for almost a week, I haven't watched any news

13:26.160 --> 13:27.160
at all, so.

13:27.160 --> 13:32.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, how are you feeling, we should, we should, we might want to take up

13:32.840 --> 13:38.600
this regiment, like, like, are you feeling great, I feel great, man, Mexico City is

13:38.600 --> 13:42.800
the most goddamn fun city, if you haven't been there, really go down to Mexico City

13:42.800 --> 13:46.720
and chill out, the people are cool, they're laid back, the food is fucking screaming,

13:46.720 --> 13:50.720
they love music, the architecture is wild, there's, there's dogs everywhere, there's

13:50.720 --> 13:57.160
dogs everywhere, and, and the thing is, I never once heard a dog bark, no, I heard one

13:57.160 --> 14:00.520
dog bark when we were in like, oh, well yeah, but you know they were barking in Spanish,

14:00.520 --> 14:05.040
so you probably didn't recognize it, don't, don't, don't they, you know, in, in French

14:05.040 --> 14:09.600
class, like, we always had, you had to learn how all the animals, like, vow, vow, yeah,

14:09.600 --> 14:19.800
vow, vow, yeah, but the dogs, there's a park, park in Mexico, like, there's a big park in

14:19.800 --> 14:24.560
the, like, in the Condesa area, and there's a million dogs, dog walkers have, like, 40

14:24.560 --> 14:29.000
dogs on one leader, like, it's amazing, and all the dogs are just chilled out, having

14:29.000 --> 14:32.720
a good time, no one's, they're not jumping and barking and biting and scratching, they're

14:32.720 --> 14:37.240
just, just the happiest, most well-socialized dogs in the world, it's really great, and

14:37.240 --> 14:44.960
then there's one place called, uh, Sochi, chocolate milk, so, so, so, so, so, so, sochimil,

14:44.960 --> 14:51.360
I don't know what the fuck, uh, there's canals, there's fucking wild, and there's an island

14:51.360 --> 14:56.200
of the dolls, people just took baby dolls and nailed them to trees, and it's the fucking

14:56.200 --> 15:02.800
creepiest ass shit, so there's just, there's just a whole island of dolls nailed to things,

15:02.800 --> 15:05.800
and there's just feral chihuahuas running around everywhere, it's fucking grand.

15:05.800 --> 15:11.120
Is it possible that Mexico has affected your reactions to things, like, you're, you're

15:11.120 --> 15:15.440
describing things that should make you upset, yeah, it was, but you're on a boat, you're

15:15.440 --> 15:20.440
on these big colorful barges and these canals, and, and then there's food, it's like, rows

15:20.440 --> 15:24.560
up next to you, and there's just a guy selling tamales, there's a woman selling fruit, and

15:24.560 --> 15:28.560
there's enchiladas, and then there's a bunch of bands, there's like, there's like a thousand

15:28.560 --> 15:33.000
bands out there, so we hired a mariachi band that came on board our boat, and we're all

15:33.000 --> 15:36.760
just singing along, and it was the god, it was the fucking greatest day of my life.

15:36.760 --> 15:42.360
Alright, well, what's your favorite TV show right now, what are you watching the most?

15:42.360 --> 15:43.760
Uh, probably Westworld.

15:43.760 --> 15:44.760
Alright.

15:44.760 --> 15:45.760
Woohoo!

15:45.760 --> 15:50.080
Well, the, the finale's tonight, but I, I'm, I'm back, I, I'm, I don't think I've seen

15:50.080 --> 15:52.160
two episodes back, so no spoilers.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.160
Yeah, well, okay, no spoilers.

15:54.160 --> 15:57.480
Don't say your, your groans are spoilers.

15:57.480 --> 16:00.920
Everybody promise, we'll, we'll just not talk about Westworld at all tonight, uh, please

16:00.920 --> 16:02.760
welcome our first guest, Tolemy,

16:02.760 --> 16:03.760
Slocum.

16:03.760 --> 16:04.760
Slocum from Westworld.

16:04.760 --> 16:06.760
Sylvester the tech guy from Westworld.

16:06.760 --> 16:19.760
He's the nerd that you tried to kill, but you can't kill a nerd like Sylvester.

16:19.760 --> 16:22.760
That's so easy.

16:22.760 --> 16:25.760
Hi everybody.

16:25.760 --> 16:31.440
Probably, uh, uh, second to the British writer character, the least liked character.

16:31.440 --> 16:33.280
So far, so I've noticed.

16:33.280 --> 16:38.920
I do, I do feel like I'm, I am slightly more, uh, palpable than he, I probably, I shouldn't

16:38.920 --> 16:39.920
start with that.

16:39.920 --> 16:46.520
Um, yeah, at least to my wife, uh, my wife likes me slightly better than him.

16:46.520 --> 16:51.200
Well, how did you, uh, everybody, everybody's, I mean, this is probably the, this is the

16:51.200 --> 16:55.520
show that everybody's watching, at least in LA, like, uh, and so you're, like, this

16:55.520 --> 17:00.280
is brand new, like we had a, we had, we had Grey Worm from Game of Thrones on it, I, I,

17:00.280 --> 17:04.520
I, and, and I was on a yacht with Game of Thrones people and all I can think to ask them

17:04.520 --> 17:06.680
is what does it feel like to be playing this thing?

17:06.680 --> 17:10.280
But the answer is never satisfying, but why don't you take a shot at it?

17:10.280 --> 17:11.280
All right.

17:11.280 --> 17:18.160
That's a great lead in, um, yeah, it is interesting, um, about six weeks ago, I was standing back

17:18.160 --> 17:19.160
where those guys are.

17:19.160 --> 17:21.360
I see you by the bathroom cause I had to walk past you.

17:21.360 --> 17:29.280
Um, and so this is like, you know, six weeks later, my life is about, uh, like what, 30

17:29.280 --> 17:31.080
yards different, you know?

17:31.080 --> 17:35.960
But it's a big 30 yards and it feels, you mean, you, you, you, by, you were standing

17:35.960 --> 17:39.800
back there, you mean you were just some regular Joe watching the show?

17:39.800 --> 17:40.800
Yeah.

17:40.800 --> 17:44.360
And now you're up here with like, in the limelight, right?

17:44.360 --> 17:45.360
Yes.

17:45.360 --> 17:49.600
But also you're on Westworld, which is more important.

17:49.600 --> 17:50.600
Yeah.

17:50.600 --> 17:56.640
Like, like, you're, you're measuring, uh, the, uh, what it's like to go from not being

17:56.640 --> 18:01.200
on Westworld to being on Westworld by, by you're using the yardstick you're using as

18:01.200 --> 18:03.640
my shitty show.

18:03.640 --> 18:10.240
I feel like that's what, I thought that was your setup, um, for like, what is, how is

18:10.240 --> 18:13.960
life different for, for you in terms of like being on the show?

18:13.960 --> 18:16.960
But, uh, if you want to talk about the experience of shooting that show, it was fascinating.

18:16.960 --> 18:20.200
Well, I want to tell you, that was like two years of fascinating because it took two years

18:20.200 --> 18:21.520
to shoot one season.

18:21.520 --> 18:22.520
Right.

18:22.520 --> 18:23.520
There's a question right there.

18:23.520 --> 18:28.040
So, so, so we have to go back all the way two years ago to what I think what, what a

18:28.040 --> 18:32.280
lot of us would like to hear is like you going from being a guy who has not been cast on

18:32.280 --> 18:37.480
Westworld to like, like, like what's the, cause there's got to be some little breathtaking

18:37.480 --> 18:39.320
banana peel stoplight.

18:39.320 --> 18:42.640
If this had happened differently story about you getting the role, right?

18:42.640 --> 18:47.520
I mean, yeah, you're looking at, you're looking at that moment, the fact that I'm even here

18:47.520 --> 18:51.880
at all because we just as actors attempt to do that constantly.

18:51.880 --> 18:59.480
So this was very normal audition, one audition, no callback, walked into the room.

18:59.480 --> 19:04.040
I don't think they had even done an audition for this guy, Sylvester.

19:04.040 --> 19:05.560
No one understood the script.

19:05.560 --> 19:10.520
It was weird comments about like MSRA and like this abdomen, like what the fuck are they

19:10.520 --> 19:11.720
talking about?

19:11.720 --> 19:13.440
They didn't even know how to run the audition.

19:13.440 --> 19:17.600
I was in there was like, I think when I was reading it, it was like, maybe this guy's

19:17.600 --> 19:20.960
like has his hands inside someone.

19:20.960 --> 19:25.160
And so I don't even think they had ever done one of those, never did a callback, didn't

19:25.160 --> 19:27.200
know that much about the show.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.720
And I was just trying to get a job.

19:28.720 --> 19:33.760
And what was your relationship with the property where you, were you a fan of the movie?

19:33.760 --> 19:34.760
I knew the movie.

19:34.760 --> 19:36.240
I have, I still haven't seen the second.

19:36.240 --> 19:37.960
I really want to see the sequel.

19:37.960 --> 19:38.960
Future world.

19:38.960 --> 19:39.960
Yeah.

19:39.960 --> 19:40.960
Any thoughts?

19:40.960 --> 19:44.080
Future world is even more seventies than Westworld.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.080
Yeah.

19:45.080 --> 19:47.640
Like the seventies had third act problems.

19:47.640 --> 19:48.640
Yes.

19:48.640 --> 19:55.680
Until, until JAWS at which point, all movies stopped having third act problems, but began

19:55.680 --> 19:59.960
to have the unified third act problem of all ripping off JAWS for, you know, it's like,

19:59.960 --> 20:01.800
like we all learned how to end a movie.

20:01.800 --> 20:02.800
Right.

20:02.800 --> 20:05.840
But then it was like a shackle, like that was, because it was successful, it's almost everything

20:05.840 --> 20:06.840
has to repeat that.

20:06.840 --> 20:07.840
Yeah.

20:07.840 --> 20:08.840
Now there's such a thing.

20:08.840 --> 20:09.840
It's almost as bad as when that law wasn't there.

20:09.840 --> 20:13.320
Every movie, after JAWS, every movie ends with a blown up shark.

20:13.320 --> 20:14.320
Yes.

20:14.320 --> 20:15.320
Yeah.

20:15.320 --> 20:16.320
I mean, essentially.

20:16.320 --> 20:17.320
I mean, or a safe cat.

20:17.320 --> 20:21.480
Like the shark industry in Hollywood and those people have JAWS.

20:21.480 --> 20:25.560
Because before that, the seventies was like, like, like, you know, you were watching a

20:25.560 --> 20:29.000
movie and it was like, oh, Gene Hackman might just run off screen and there's a gunshot

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
and a cat meows.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.480
And you're like, what the fuck just happened?

20:31.480 --> 20:32.480
Yeah.

20:32.480 --> 20:33.480
They didn't have any rules like that.

20:33.480 --> 20:34.720
And then Westworld is a great example.

20:34.720 --> 20:37.520
I love the setup of Westworld.

20:37.520 --> 20:42.040
It starts at that airport, if you remember, and they, they, it's a really cool setup,

20:42.040 --> 20:43.960
very elegant, very efficient.

20:43.960 --> 20:48.360
And then starting in, like, basically the third act, they didn't, they didn't attempt

20:48.360 --> 20:49.360
anything.

20:49.360 --> 20:50.360
They didn't have any plan.

20:50.360 --> 20:51.360
Right.

20:51.360 --> 20:52.360
It was just, this guy starts running.

20:52.360 --> 20:53.360
Right.

20:53.360 --> 20:54.360
He never stops.

20:54.360 --> 20:55.360
Okay.

20:55.360 --> 20:56.360
And it's just one long chase scene.

20:56.360 --> 20:57.360
It's like, what happened?

20:57.360 --> 20:58.360
Yeah.

20:58.360 --> 20:59.360
But it's, that, they could do that.

20:59.360 --> 21:01.120
And I actually kind of prefer it.

21:01.120 --> 21:04.920
I mean, I guess because it's like, like, what, yeah, how should, because the thing that,

21:04.920 --> 21:09.600
that, that you have to gain from a, from an era where nobody really knows how to end

21:09.600 --> 21:13.800
a movie is that every once in a while, I mean, you, you're sitting there.

21:13.800 --> 21:18.080
You, you're on the edge of your seat, like, because you don't know, you're in the hands

21:18.080 --> 21:19.080
of a lunatic.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.080
Right.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.920
You're like, I don't know, like, like, like, he could just like, like, like, easy rider

21:22.920 --> 21:29.240
just ends with fucking, just like, get your motor running, hey.

21:29.240 --> 21:30.880
And then it just like credits.

21:30.880 --> 21:31.880
Yeah.

21:31.880 --> 21:37.880
Even at the cemetery scene in, in Easy Rider, like, should I have gone on this ride with

21:37.880 --> 21:38.880
them?

21:38.880 --> 21:39.880
Yeah.

21:39.880 --> 21:40.880
Are you, are you, yeah.

21:40.880 --> 21:41.880
Did you break the movie?

21:41.880 --> 21:42.880
Yeah.

21:42.880 --> 21:46.240
I think that that is waiting for you at the end of this film is pretty exciting.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.240
Yeah.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.240
And that's kind of wrong.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.200
Because that makes you care about the characters, because if you were in real life, we're running

21:50.200 --> 21:55.000
from Yule Brenner, who was programmed to kill you, or rather programmed to not kill you

21:55.000 --> 21:57.560
and had decided to not be programmed that way anymore.

21:57.560 --> 21:58.560
Right.

21:58.560 --> 22:05.120
Like, if you were having that experience, you should feel unlike the way you feel when

22:05.120 --> 22:06.120
you're watching Jaws.

22:06.120 --> 22:07.640
You should feel like, what the fuck is happening?

22:07.640 --> 22:08.640
Yeah.

22:08.640 --> 22:09.640
How do I get out of this?

22:09.640 --> 22:10.640
Can I just play dead?

22:10.640 --> 22:15.080
The other thing about the 70s movies is like, I watched, I watched the Westworld movie in

22:15.080 --> 22:17.800
preparation for the series, and then I also watched Logan's Run.

22:17.800 --> 22:25.120
And it's like, it's amazing how, it's amazing how flimsy the, the evil is, like, how easy

22:25.120 --> 22:26.120
it is to take down.

22:26.120 --> 22:30.120
And Logan's Run, he comes back from the lack of sanctuary.

22:30.120 --> 22:35.520
The computer that runs all of dystopian life asks him, where's sanctuary?

22:35.520 --> 22:36.720
He says there isn't one.

22:36.720 --> 22:37.720
It says bullshit.

22:37.720 --> 22:38.720
I'm going to read your mind.

22:38.720 --> 22:40.440
And his mind says there's no sanctuary.

22:40.440 --> 22:47.160
And the computer explodes, and with it, and the shopping mall they live in starts falling

22:47.160 --> 22:51.760
apart, and all of the people in pantyhose have to run out, and they see an old man

22:51.760 --> 22:56.320
and touch his beard, and it's over.

22:56.320 --> 23:02.560
Because it's like, it was that easy back then to, to, to foil a, an oligarchic technocratic

23:02.560 --> 23:03.560
hydra.

23:03.560 --> 23:04.560
Yeah.

23:04.560 --> 23:07.600
So, so going back to this show.

23:07.600 --> 23:12.920
No, um, because I did realize I might have, uh, so you did this audition, which it sounds

23:12.920 --> 23:14.880
like it was in a casting director's office.

23:14.880 --> 23:15.880
Yeah.

23:15.880 --> 23:17.480
Uh, and you, you booked it off of one read?

23:17.480 --> 23:18.480
That was it?

23:18.480 --> 23:19.480
One read?

23:19.480 --> 23:20.480
No, call back.

23:20.480 --> 23:21.480
No idea about anything.

23:21.480 --> 23:22.480
Hired.

23:22.480 --> 23:23.480
Fucking death.

23:23.480 --> 23:24.480
Just hired.

23:24.480 --> 23:25.480
That's the best.

23:25.480 --> 23:29.200
Clearly, and I'm used to this, not, not going to go anywhere or be anything.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.760
That was just my mentality.

23:30.760 --> 23:34.920
And it was like, it was basically like four lines in a pilot.

23:34.920 --> 23:38.720
And I did know that people were in it, but I didn't, I didn't, I just didn't know what

23:38.720 --> 23:39.720
to expect.

23:39.720 --> 23:40.720
I'm so cool though.

23:40.720 --> 23:44.920
How much of your day when you're on the set for you is spent, uh, looking at naked actors

23:44.920 --> 23:45.920
in a chair?

23:45.920 --> 23:46.920
Yeah.

23:46.920 --> 23:48.920
They're, they're, they're everywhere.

23:48.920 --> 23:49.920
Yeah.

23:49.920 --> 23:53.320
Like all, cause they are all not just the chairs, everyone laying down unless they have their

23:53.320 --> 23:55.400
legs cut off is a real person.

23:55.400 --> 23:56.400
Really?

23:56.400 --> 23:59.120
So they're all like fully naked with, with scars.

23:59.120 --> 24:06.200
It is a real fascinating emotional cocktail to see an attractive naked person that is

24:06.200 --> 24:11.080
gashed open because you're like, want to help them and also aroused by it.

24:11.080 --> 24:17.480
It's like very, it's difficult.

24:17.480 --> 24:22.120
This segment brought to you by Eddie world.

24:22.120 --> 24:27.360
Eddie world where the customer probably has a child.

24:27.360 --> 24:32.920
Eddie world my glasses on and it's real offensive to me how hard it is to tell a male from a

24:32.920 --> 24:35.640
female laying down like 10 feet away.

24:35.640 --> 24:43.240
If your glasses are not on, I was, I was offended by once they like sat, I was like, no.

24:43.240 --> 24:47.680
I think we're offended by your adherence to a binary, uh, heteronormative.

24:47.680 --> 24:48.680
Okay.

24:48.680 --> 24:52.480
Don't want to cash in on that one.

24:52.480 --> 24:54.480
All right.

24:54.480 --> 24:57.360
Um, the, uh, the, uh, God damn it.

24:57.360 --> 24:58.360
The shit.

24:58.360 --> 24:59.360
Oh, oh, okay.

24:59.360 --> 25:00.360
Come on.

25:00.360 --> 25:01.360
Tell the truth.

25:01.360 --> 25:04.360
Uh, some of that, some of that shits from Game of Thrones sets like, like, like, like,

25:04.360 --> 25:05.360
I don't know.

25:05.360 --> 25:08.840
There was like sets in there where I'm like, come on, that's, Cody was really the one

25:08.840 --> 25:09.840
that pointed out.

25:09.840 --> 25:10.840
She's like, come on.

25:10.840 --> 25:11.840
That's a Game of Thrones set.

25:11.840 --> 25:12.840
Like, they're taking like curtains and stuff.

25:12.840 --> 25:16.440
And then the heads and the, on the wall, like, like, like, there is a, there's no, it doesn't

25:16.440 --> 25:17.440
look like that.

25:17.440 --> 25:18.440
No.

25:18.440 --> 25:19.440
But HBO wouldn't have those laying around.

25:19.440 --> 25:20.440
That's not how it works.

25:20.440 --> 25:21.440
No, that's all in England.

25:21.440 --> 25:22.440
I think those sets are.

25:22.440 --> 25:27.360
This is all up in, um, about 30 minutes north of here, kind of parallel to where, um, Six

25:27.360 --> 25:32.960
Flags is, but they did, they, they do have old, um, like tanks laying around from other

25:32.960 --> 25:38.640
productions and some, um, like original Mad Maxi kind of little cars that were like welded

25:38.640 --> 25:41.680
on a, on one of those like motorcycles, like old stuff.

25:41.680 --> 25:45.680
So there is stuff laying around, but all that, I don't think they duplicated anything.

25:45.680 --> 25:47.800
So do you have viewing parties?

25:47.800 --> 25:48.800
No.

25:48.800 --> 25:50.800
Are you married or are you in a relationship?

25:50.800 --> 25:51.800
I'm married.

25:51.800 --> 25:52.800
Yeah.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.640
To a, to, to, uh, what gender person?

25:54.640 --> 25:55.640
To a wife.

25:55.640 --> 25:56.640
Yeah.

25:56.640 --> 25:58.440
Uh, I'm married to a wife.

25:58.440 --> 25:59.440
A lady wife?

25:59.440 --> 26:00.440
A lady wife.

26:00.440 --> 26:01.440
It is.

26:01.440 --> 26:02.440
Uh, from 10 feet away.

26:02.440 --> 26:03.440
You don't know.

26:03.440 --> 26:04.440
Um, yeah.

26:04.440 --> 26:05.440
Do you know?

26:05.440 --> 26:06.440
Did you know?

26:06.440 --> 26:07.440
I know.

26:07.440 --> 26:08.440
I know who she is.

26:08.440 --> 26:11.880
I saw your wife laying on a, on a, on a metal slab and I thought, I really couldn't tell

26:11.880 --> 26:13.280
if she was a dude or not.

26:13.280 --> 26:16.200
Is she, uh, what is she?

26:16.200 --> 26:17.200
Is she, is she.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.760
I'm not going to react to that.

26:18.760 --> 26:19.760
I'm just going to.

26:19.760 --> 26:20.760
I didn't.

26:20.760 --> 26:23.840
I didn't pass me by like I'm still talking about it.

26:23.840 --> 26:27.200
It's not the world's best kept secret that your wife likes to lay naked on slab.

26:27.200 --> 26:30.040
That you followed it up with a second one.

26:30.040 --> 26:32.400
I tried not to react to the first one.

26:32.400 --> 26:33.400
She's known as slab later.

26:33.400 --> 26:38.200
Oh, son of a bitch.

26:38.200 --> 26:42.240
There are people like, sometimes I see, I think, I go, I think that's a real doll or

26:42.240 --> 26:43.240
something.

26:43.240 --> 26:44.240
Like in the background.

26:44.240 --> 26:45.240
Yeah.

26:45.240 --> 26:46.240
They never, they never use like fake.

26:46.240 --> 26:47.240
Like they did.

26:47.240 --> 26:49.080
If they're like bodies were cut up, but they were like real or if they're just like sitting

26:49.080 --> 26:50.080
in a chair.

26:50.080 --> 26:51.080
They're real people.

26:51.080 --> 26:52.080
Really?

26:52.080 --> 26:53.080
For the most part.

26:53.080 --> 26:54.080
How are they holding that still?

26:54.080 --> 26:55.080
Uh, well, two things.

26:55.080 --> 27:02.560
Um, one of them was my, uh, a dude I grew up with in Lodi, California, this small town.

27:02.560 --> 27:07.240
We grew up like three houses down from each other and our families were like, like sister

27:07.240 --> 27:08.240
families.

27:08.240 --> 27:10.640
You know, like once a week you have dinner with them.

27:10.640 --> 27:11.640
Uh-huh.

27:11.640 --> 27:18.800
This dude named Craig comes in at night and touches everyone's muscles with a special

27:18.800 --> 27:19.800
acid.

27:19.800 --> 27:20.800
Uh-huh.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.680
They, they put the shots under a pillow.

27:22.680 --> 27:27.560
Um, he was working on the show, which is crazy because we grew up like next to each

27:27.560 --> 27:28.560
other.

27:28.560 --> 27:32.360
He was one of the naked like, no, he does, uh, he does post, but what he does is to, he'll

27:32.360 --> 27:36.680
take a frame and, and if, if it is like still, but you know, there is somebody that's going

27:36.680 --> 27:39.800
through and like stealing images because people can't be that stiff.

27:39.800 --> 27:40.800
Right.

27:40.800 --> 27:41.800
Oh, so easily just like split screen.

27:41.800 --> 27:42.800
They like doing a little chunk.

27:42.800 --> 27:43.800
It's not split screen.

27:43.800 --> 27:44.800
It'll be like a frame.

27:44.800 --> 27:48.240
So if, if something, if there is like, there, there, you know, that's how often how we would

27:48.240 --> 27:51.000
get it to look like Chevy Chase knew all his lines.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
Yeah.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.040
Like we would do, we would do liquid more for like, like, like, like, you see those two

27:56.040 --> 27:58.000
shots of him next to Donald Glover.

27:58.000 --> 28:02.800
It's like, like, see if there's a clock in the background of Chevy besides cause that

28:02.800 --> 28:09.440
fucking thing's going to go freak out for some extra, the background is hot, hot dog

28:09.440 --> 28:11.440
keeps changing sizes.

28:11.440 --> 28:14.800
The candles are all different.

28:14.800 --> 28:19.200
We wish him the best, he's in recovery right now.

28:19.200 --> 28:25.400
Can we go back, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, slow, and first of all, this is

28:25.400 --> 28:26.400
a fantastic name.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.400
Yeah.

28:27.400 --> 28:30.080
I said, is it Tolome and you said that's the correct pronunciation, but it's not the

28:30.080 --> 28:31.080
American pronunciation.

28:31.080 --> 28:32.080
Yeah.

28:32.080 --> 28:33.400
There's more English would be Tolome.

28:33.400 --> 28:34.400
Greek would be Tolome.

28:34.400 --> 28:36.200
They actually pronounce the P. Tolome.

28:36.200 --> 28:37.800
Put the pit in there.

28:37.800 --> 28:38.800
Yeah.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.120
You said you were born in Kenya.

28:40.120 --> 28:41.120
This is born in Kenya.

28:41.120 --> 28:46.160
So I was born on the eclipse of the moon, which is the story I was told, but then I

28:46.160 --> 28:48.680
went to an astrologer and I was born like two days after the eclipse of the moon.

28:48.680 --> 28:50.640
Who notices when the moon is eclipsed?

28:50.640 --> 28:52.400
Well, my parents.

28:52.400 --> 28:53.400
What eclipse is it?

28:53.400 --> 28:54.400
The sun?

28:54.400 --> 28:57.960
No, the earth eclipses anything, right?

28:57.960 --> 28:58.960
I don't know.

28:58.960 --> 28:59.960
I don't know.

28:59.960 --> 29:03.840
The moon can eclipse the sun, the earth can eclipse both.

29:03.840 --> 29:08.080
The reason why you don't see the moon all the time is cause of the shadow of the earth.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.080
What kind of show is this?

29:09.080 --> 29:10.080
You're blowing my mind.

29:10.080 --> 29:11.080
Yeah.

29:11.080 --> 29:15.320
So, yeah, it was a full eclipse of the moon, which aren't that rare.

29:15.320 --> 29:20.800
And then Tolome was a Greek astronomer, Claudius Tolomeus was a Greek astronomer lived in

29:20.800 --> 29:26.840
Egypt, Alexander, when the Greek Empire owned Egypt, and he proved that was the family of

29:26.840 --> 29:27.840
the Cleopatra decision.

29:27.840 --> 29:28.840
No.

29:28.840 --> 29:29.840
No.

29:29.840 --> 29:30.840
The different guys, similar era.

29:30.840 --> 29:31.840
Okay.

29:31.840 --> 29:35.240
Were your parents, why so weird?

29:35.240 --> 29:39.760
Why were they in Kenya and why did they name you that?

29:39.760 --> 29:40.760
This with them.

29:40.760 --> 29:44.760
This, by the way, I'm a bad interviewer.

29:44.760 --> 29:53.600
Well, you haven't attacked my wife, and I've gotten over it, I'm not thinking about it

29:53.600 --> 29:54.600
anymore.

29:54.600 --> 29:55.600
I don't think I attacked just somebody else.

29:55.600 --> 30:00.560
You attacked, you called her a slab woman, pretty sure you called her a slab woman.

30:00.560 --> 30:06.680
I said people called her a slab lady, I had never said that at all.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.480
I simply am a journalist, sir.

30:08.480 --> 30:14.720
Well, and for my part, I've gotten over it.

30:14.720 --> 30:20.640
Yeah, it's an interesting story, and I don't know how far to go into it, but it's dark.

30:20.640 --> 30:21.640
Really?

30:21.640 --> 30:22.640
Yeah.

30:22.640 --> 30:24.140
Your parents having you as the story starts?

30:24.140 --> 30:27.920
That story is much darker than I knew, and I found out about it recently.

30:27.920 --> 30:28.920
Really?

30:28.920 --> 30:29.920
Yeah.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.760
So how much time do you want to commit to this thing?

30:31.760 --> 30:33.760
Well, we've got other people to meet.

30:33.760 --> 30:34.760
Okay.

30:34.760 --> 30:40.000
I'll try to do the fast version.

30:40.000 --> 30:44.320
The story that I was told was that he worked for an American guy, I should not be telling

30:44.320 --> 30:47.160
the story.

30:47.160 --> 30:51.600
This is not going well already.

30:51.600 --> 30:55.000
So the story I was told as a child growing up was that he was building a fertilizer plant

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
for the Kenyan government.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.200
There was an American company building fertilizer plant for the Kenyan government, and it didn't

30:58.200 --> 31:03.000
go well, and so we got extradited out of the country, and the Kenyan government is horrible,

31:03.000 --> 31:09.000
and they threatened our lives a couple of times, and eventually we escaped and got out.

31:09.000 --> 31:14.960
Went to Cincinnati, which was my parents' relationship fell apart, because it was so

31:14.960 --> 31:17.160
stressful to get out of Kenya.

31:17.160 --> 31:21.120
Oh, it's one of those couples that's going to blame the Kenyan government for hating

31:21.120 --> 31:22.120
them?

31:22.120 --> 31:23.120
Yes.

31:23.120 --> 31:27.680
I'm not working it out.

31:27.680 --> 31:33.680
So I have to tell this difficult story, but also you're going to attack me along the way.

31:33.680 --> 31:34.680
All right.

31:34.680 --> 31:35.680
Okay.

31:35.680 --> 31:36.680
I didn't know.

31:36.680 --> 31:39.440
If we do attack anything, we'll just put a wound in its head and strip it naked so that

31:39.440 --> 31:43.000
you can derive sexual pleasure from it.

31:43.000 --> 31:50.440
That is literally my nightmare is like, I hope I end up naked on this show, because I've

31:50.440 --> 31:51.440
earned it.

31:51.440 --> 31:56.640
That was my Westworld theory, by the way, was that the show was taking place in the

31:56.640 --> 32:01.760
year, sorry to cut you off, the show's taking place in the year 7,000, and all of the robot,

32:01.760 --> 32:02.760
there are no humans left.

32:02.760 --> 32:03.760
Yeah, I heard that.

32:03.760 --> 32:08.760
All of the robots go to Westworld as a mecca, where they can experience a budistic reincarnation

32:08.760 --> 32:16.560
process where you can rise up through the Rosencrantzes and the Guildensterns, to the

32:16.560 --> 32:24.640
Maves, to the Anthony Hopkins, and then cycle back through, because they've lost all contact

32:24.640 --> 32:30.320
with their human roots, and they go there to just sort of revive themselves spiritually.

32:30.320 --> 32:32.000
It's like they're wailing wall.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
Yeah.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
Anyways.

32:34.000 --> 32:39.040
Basically, on that theory, someone like Maeve is actually attending the park.

32:39.040 --> 32:43.880
You would eventually see that Maeve was also like a, yeah, that she'd be in that photo

32:43.880 --> 32:47.320
with Anthony Hopkins when they're starting Westworld, or something, that she'd be in

32:47.320 --> 32:51.640
the background with a lab coat on, or something, and that you'd be like a bartender, and that

32:51.640 --> 32:55.320
you'd go, oh, that's pointless.

32:55.320 --> 33:00.040
What is the deal with the English guy, with the British overacting, like, screaming guy?

33:00.040 --> 33:01.640
I didn't meet him.

33:01.640 --> 33:02.640
Wait, wait, wait.

33:02.640 --> 33:03.640
What do you mean?

33:03.640 --> 33:05.640
Was he in a different show?

33:05.640 --> 33:11.520
Does he know that he's not, and that he's also in the same show as everybody else?

33:11.520 --> 33:12.520
I'm pretty sure.

33:12.520 --> 33:18.720
I mean, I didn't know he was even on, like, I only read my scenes.

33:18.720 --> 33:19.720
I know nothing about it.

33:19.720 --> 33:23.600
They probably shot you out in an hour, like, all of your scenes are in one room in UTA's

33:23.600 --> 33:24.600
basement.

33:24.600 --> 33:25.600
Yeah.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.720
Okay, it's like, it's just...

33:27.720 --> 33:31.720
No, no, it took the full two years.

33:31.720 --> 33:32.720
Yeah.

33:32.720 --> 33:33.720
So, technically, like...

33:33.720 --> 33:34.720
I mean, do impugn your craft.

33:34.720 --> 33:35.720
No, no, logistically, I give you credit.

33:35.720 --> 33:36.720
Logistically, I couldn't open it up in that way.

33:36.720 --> 33:37.720
Yeah.

33:37.720 --> 33:48.720
Yeah, I'm thinking about all the time that I wasted, because had you, between being shooting

33:48.720 --> 33:49.720
the show, it would have known much more efficiently.

33:49.720 --> 33:50.720
Now, did you ever...

33:50.720 --> 33:51.720
I've known for my efficiency.

33:51.720 --> 33:52.720
Did you ever have to interact?

33:52.720 --> 33:56.480
Because I think the most fascinating part of that show is when they're just walking

33:56.480 --> 33:57.720
that bison around in that glass road.

33:57.720 --> 34:00.720
That's the funniest thing that you've got.

34:00.720 --> 34:03.720
Just showing the bison how to walk around.

34:03.720 --> 34:11.160
They've mastered post-singularity, nanotechnological, like, like, life creation, but yeah, you've

34:11.160 --> 34:12.160
got to...

34:12.160 --> 34:14.720
It's well-known you've got to prime that bison, like, you've got to...

34:14.720 --> 34:22.720
But the coolest thing, though, is that when Maeve was walking through.

34:22.720 --> 34:24.720
No spoilers here, if you're listening.

34:24.720 --> 34:25.720
I don't think.

34:25.720 --> 34:31.720
But walking through, and then there's, like, in those rooms, like, the poker game guys,

34:31.720 --> 34:35.720
and then they all draw guns, and then the technician goes, like, all right, back to one,

34:35.720 --> 34:37.720
or whatever, and they all pick up their cards.

34:37.720 --> 34:39.720
I thought that shit was...

34:39.720 --> 34:40.720
It's a cool show.

34:40.720 --> 34:41.720
We like it.

34:41.720 --> 34:45.720
I do wish there was a slower version of that show.

34:45.720 --> 34:46.720
Here's my thing.

34:46.720 --> 34:53.720
I would watch ten episodes where there is no plot, and just show us, like, some dude getting

34:53.720 --> 34:58.720
off a train and, like, getting on a horse and riding in one direction and just see what happens.

34:58.720 --> 35:04.720
It's called Love Boat Meets Downton Abbey Meets Deadwood.

35:04.720 --> 35:08.720
It's just, like, there's guest stars, and you don't have to do the serialized, like,

35:08.720 --> 35:11.720
oh, shit, this whole park's going crazy.

35:11.720 --> 35:12.720
It is Love Boat.

35:12.720 --> 35:13.720
That's right.

35:13.720 --> 35:14.720
Wait, wait, wait.

35:14.720 --> 35:15.720
Or it's Fantasy Heaven.

35:15.720 --> 35:16.720
They could just do that.

35:16.720 --> 35:19.720
I think before the show came out, they thought that's what it was going to be.

35:19.720 --> 35:22.720
Like, people were like, oh, so each episode, someone new comes.

35:22.720 --> 35:23.720
Oh, Tattoo.

35:23.720 --> 35:25.720
Here comes Bill Gates.

35:25.720 --> 35:27.720
He's a philanthropist.

35:27.720 --> 35:30.720
His fantasy is to be a gunslinger.

35:30.720 --> 35:31.720
Boss!

35:31.720 --> 35:33.720
Boss, isn't that everybody?

35:33.720 --> 35:39.720
Yes, Tattoo, but Bill Gates wants to sling guns in a way that breaks his heart.

35:39.720 --> 35:41.720
I think you're tampering with magic.

35:41.720 --> 35:43.720
You don't understand, boss.

35:43.720 --> 35:44.720
That's okay.

35:44.720 --> 35:45.720
Apparently, I'm God.

35:45.720 --> 35:47.720
We all learned in season three.

35:47.720 --> 35:53.720
There was this show called Fantasy Island that we've talked about with Paul F. Tompkins.

35:53.720 --> 35:54.720
Detrain!

35:54.720 --> 35:55.720
Detrain!

35:55.720 --> 35:57.720
Good night, everybody.

35:57.720 --> 35:58.720
Detrain?

35:58.720 --> 35:59.720
Yeah, yeah.

35:59.720 --> 36:03.720
No, but I really, that's what, that was my fantasy Westworld.

36:03.720 --> 36:04.720
I'm not knocking this one.

36:04.720 --> 36:05.720
No!

36:05.720 --> 36:09.720
The story is fascinating, but the idea that there would be an upstairs downstairs, like

36:09.720 --> 36:10.720
down in Abbey.

36:10.720 --> 36:11.720
Yeah.

36:11.720 --> 36:13.720
The servants were the gods.

36:13.720 --> 36:20.720
The gods lived in the underworld, and they were these polyamorous, asexual, multisexual.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.720
They were so fucked up, like what you're saying.

36:23.720 --> 36:29.720
Like, they're looking at that you come to Westworld to fuck and murder in a simulation,

36:29.720 --> 36:33.720
and these people, like, designed the things and send them back up.

36:33.720 --> 36:38.720
And, like, how fucked up would they be as people, like, had their culture and stuff,

36:38.720 --> 36:39.720
and we...

36:39.720 --> 36:42.720
They turned out a lot like that British guy on the show.

36:42.720 --> 36:46.720
Could there be a character that just comes in, like, just wants to open up a little mercantile

36:46.720 --> 36:47.720
store?

36:47.720 --> 36:48.720
Like, just wants to...

36:48.720 --> 36:50.720
I want to become a blacksmith.

36:50.720 --> 36:52.720
I really want to get into blacksmiths.

36:52.720 --> 36:53.720
I get...

36:53.720 --> 36:55.720
Here's one thought that I've had that I haven't shared.

36:55.720 --> 36:59.720
I probably shouldn't, but I do think there are a couple people, probably, that would

36:59.720 --> 37:04.720
go to the park, pay to go to the park, and then try to convince people that we're visiting

37:04.720 --> 37:05.720
that they are robots.

37:05.720 --> 37:06.720
Right.

37:06.720 --> 37:07.720
No, of course.

37:07.720 --> 37:08.720
Of course.

37:08.720 --> 37:12.720
And have sex with people, like, as almost like a servant, just want to feel what that's

37:12.720 --> 37:16.720
like to, like, go through it, because people are that fucked up.

37:16.720 --> 37:17.720
Of course they are.

37:17.720 --> 37:19.720
Go to any ren fair, yes.

37:19.720 --> 37:20.720
Yes!

37:20.720 --> 37:21.720
Exactly.

37:21.720 --> 37:25.720
Like, the people that aren't getting paid that are walking around going, I don't look

37:25.720 --> 37:26.720
of none!

37:26.720 --> 37:31.720
You're like, your dream is to, like, this guy's making $5 an hour, and he hates doing it.

37:31.720 --> 37:33.720
You want to do it for free.

37:33.720 --> 37:34.720
Yeah, like, yeah.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.720
It'd be like a non-crying game.

37:36.720 --> 37:42.720
What happens if the guns that the guests have, are they real bullets, right?

37:42.720 --> 37:44.720
They're blowing away the robots.

37:44.720 --> 37:45.720
What's keeping them from...

37:45.720 --> 37:46.720
I have no idea.

37:46.720 --> 37:49.720
From accidentally blowing away somebody that's another guest, they just didn't realize.

37:49.720 --> 37:54.720
Well, my assumption is that it is some kind of charge of some kind, and it either...

37:54.720 --> 37:55.720
I don't know.

37:55.720 --> 37:57.720
Some people get hit, and then they fall in and go, owie.

37:57.720 --> 38:02.720
And it has something to do with, like, the further out you go, you're, like, volunteering

38:02.720 --> 38:07.720
for the potential for physical abuse, but there's still cardinal rules.

38:07.720 --> 38:08.720
Like, I can't leave a mark.

38:08.720 --> 38:09.720
Like, maybe.

38:09.720 --> 38:10.720
That's what I'm hearing alluded to.

38:10.720 --> 38:12.720
That doesn't seem from the show.

38:12.720 --> 38:14.720
Again, I'm just watching as a fan.

38:14.720 --> 38:15.720
But people get punched.

38:15.720 --> 38:16.720
Like, what happens there?

38:16.720 --> 38:19.720
But I feel like it's like Ed Harris' character is out there.

38:19.720 --> 38:21.720
By the way, I know there's this huge...

38:21.720 --> 38:24.720
There's these reveals and shit that I'm not talking about, but like, so I'm not...

38:24.720 --> 38:28.720
I'm staring clear of spoilers, but saying, like, it seems like the Ed Harris character

38:28.720 --> 38:32.720
was, like, going further and further out where it was, like, it's...

38:32.720 --> 38:33.720
Yeah, more and more dangerous.

38:33.720 --> 38:34.720
They can punch you in the face.

38:34.720 --> 38:35.720
Yes.

38:35.720 --> 38:36.720
They can knock you unconscious.

38:36.720 --> 38:39.720
Like, a little...

38:39.720 --> 38:42.720
You know, you can tell the writers when you go back to work.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.720
I could use a little more clarity on that.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.720
I'm just kidding.

38:46.720 --> 38:48.720
They have their thing going.

38:48.720 --> 38:50.720
So, okay.

38:50.720 --> 38:52.720
So, well, let's...

38:52.720 --> 38:54.720
Do you want...

38:54.720 --> 38:56.720
Do you want me to...

38:56.720 --> 38:58.720
Oh, he's gone.

38:58.720 --> 39:00.720
I believe I can fly.

39:00.720 --> 39:01.720
And he's gone.

39:01.720 --> 39:03.720
I believe I can touch.

39:03.720 --> 39:05.720
Eddie!

39:10.720 --> 39:12.720
Do you want me to...

39:12.720 --> 39:15.720
A very quick version of the other side of that Kenyan story?

39:15.720 --> 39:17.720
Yes, the Kenyan government side.

39:17.720 --> 39:20.720
Yeah, before I was born, my father worked for the CIA.

39:20.720 --> 39:21.720
Oh, my God!

39:21.720 --> 39:22.720
Yeah.

39:22.720 --> 39:26.720
Turns out, my father was the Bernie Madoff of Kenya.

39:26.720 --> 39:34.720
And I didn't find that out until 2012 when information came out that that plant that he was supposedly had built,

39:34.720 --> 39:38.720
the Kenyan government was making payments on it for 30 years

39:38.720 --> 39:42.720
to a Brussels company, a Shell company.

39:42.720 --> 39:44.720
So, the entire thing was a scam.

39:44.720 --> 39:45.720
Oh, my God!

39:45.720 --> 39:46.720
They scammed the entire country.

39:46.720 --> 39:51.720
The only thing that would make the story good would be if it was in Nigeria.

39:51.720 --> 39:52.720
What?

39:52.720 --> 39:55.720
Your dad's job was to scam Nigerians.

39:55.720 --> 39:57.720
Never mind.

39:57.720 --> 40:00.720
Oh, now I understand that.

40:00.720 --> 40:02.720
So, his job...

40:02.720 --> 40:04.720
So, that was the EIA operation?

40:04.720 --> 40:06.720
I don't know. We don't know.

40:06.720 --> 40:10.720
They threatened your lives they had reason to because they...

40:10.720 --> 40:11.720
Exactly.

40:11.720 --> 40:15.720
And some of this came out with WikiLeaks has...

40:15.720 --> 40:18.720
Why am I talking about this?

40:18.720 --> 40:21.720
Are we all going to learn about your dad's with WikiLeaks?

40:21.720 --> 40:23.720
Is there going to be a drone strike on Harmony?

40:23.720 --> 40:24.720
No.

40:24.720 --> 40:27.720
But they have the embassy recordings.

40:27.720 --> 40:32.720
They have the transcripts of when he had to go to the embassy to try to hide.

40:32.720 --> 40:38.720
So, they had like, why am I saying the name?

40:38.720 --> 40:41.720
But they have those transcripts of when he was...

40:41.720 --> 40:44.720
What the actual American interaction with this guy...

40:44.720 --> 40:45.720
So, he gave you...

40:45.720 --> 40:47.720
Your name is like...

40:47.720 --> 40:49.720
It's like a spy operation.

40:49.720 --> 40:51.720
Like, a Ptolemae.

40:51.720 --> 40:53.720
Like, it's like...

40:53.720 --> 40:56.720
Yeah, there might be the key to the entire my name.

40:56.720 --> 40:58.720
I might have it in me.

40:58.720 --> 41:00.720
I think your name is like a password and some vault.

41:00.720 --> 41:01.720
Right.

41:01.720 --> 41:05.720
So, first I have to do sexy laser hopscotch.

41:05.720 --> 41:08.720
And then when I get to the thing, I'm like, there's a password?

41:08.720 --> 41:10.720
Ptolemae.

41:10.720 --> 41:12.720
Yeah.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.720
I put my like, hand on it.

41:14.720 --> 41:16.720
Or they realize like, it's inside me.

41:16.720 --> 41:19.720
Some like, some kind of horcrux and they have to kill me to get it out.

41:19.720 --> 41:25.720
Oh my god, like your scalp has a maze on it.

41:25.720 --> 41:27.720
That's a show, right?

41:27.720 --> 41:29.720
You understand, it's like a fiction.

41:29.720 --> 41:30.720
It's a fiction.

41:30.720 --> 41:33.720
I don't think your scalp has a show, so there's a maze on it.

41:33.720 --> 41:34.720
No, I...

41:34.720 --> 41:39.720
It's getting a little bit like one of those 70's movies where you don't know how it's gonna end.

41:39.720 --> 41:42.720
And I'm slightly concerned.

41:42.720 --> 41:48.720
By the way, if that, if that, if that scalp maze doesn't turn out to come to some use, some navigational purpose,

41:48.720 --> 41:51.720
I want some of my HBO money back.

41:51.720 --> 41:54.720
Or like, if he doesn't pull that scalp back out and go like,

41:54.720 --> 42:01.720
well, we should be about in the middle.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.720
We're right by the eyebrow.

42:03.720 --> 42:08.720
The back side of the eyebrow.

42:08.720 --> 42:14.720
Alright, well, speaking of gore and things human and visceral,

42:14.720 --> 42:20.720
your character has to deal in robotic blood and guts.

42:20.720 --> 42:26.720
And I, in my genius of booking guests, like I thought, just fit like a tumbler and key.

42:26.720 --> 42:30.720
You just asked me to do the show like 10 minutes before.

42:30.720 --> 42:31.720
Yeah, that's true.

42:31.720 --> 42:34.720
But then I saw this connection and I'm excited about it.

42:34.720 --> 42:36.720
We have, I met this couple.

42:36.720 --> 42:40.720
Let's bring out Alan and Katrina.

42:40.720 --> 42:42.720
I won't use their last names.

42:42.720 --> 42:47.720
Any World

42:47.720 --> 42:52.720
Any World

42:52.720 --> 42:57.720
Any World

42:57.720 --> 43:05.720
Any World, our loss is your gain.

43:05.720 --> 43:10.720
Alright, Alan and Katrina, you guys are EMTs, both of you.

43:10.720 --> 43:11.720
Correct.

43:11.720 --> 43:13.720
You're a married EMT couple.

43:13.720 --> 43:14.720
Actually, we're just friends.

43:14.720 --> 43:15.720
We're not married.

43:15.720 --> 43:16.720
We're roommates.

43:16.720 --> 43:17.720
What?

43:17.720 --> 43:18.720
Yes.

43:18.720 --> 43:19.720
Wait, shut up, wait.

43:19.720 --> 43:24.720
Any World

43:24.720 --> 43:30.720
Wait, when did I, how many times have you heard me talk to you as if you were husband and wife?

43:30.720 --> 43:34.720
Actually, the only time was when we talked in the green room.

43:34.720 --> 43:36.720
Before that, it was just Steve as far as I know.

43:36.720 --> 43:39.720
But I was like, okay, well, we'll correct him when we get a chance.

43:39.720 --> 43:42.720
Okay, so whose kids did I meet?

43:42.720 --> 43:43.720
You met my kids.

43:43.720 --> 43:45.720
Okay, your kids, you're just friends with Katrina.

43:45.720 --> 43:46.720
You're not married.

43:46.720 --> 43:48.720
Those were not her kids.

43:48.720 --> 43:49.720
No.

43:49.720 --> 43:50.720
Alright, fantastic.

43:50.720 --> 43:53.720
Alright, well, I mean, God, you guys are so boring now.

43:53.720 --> 43:55.720
Oh, I thought you were married.

43:55.720 --> 43:57.720
No, the marriage had nothing to do with it.

43:57.720 --> 43:59.720
I'm just fascinated I could get that wrong somehow.

43:59.720 --> 44:03.720
Okay, so anyways, but I met you guys and your kids.

44:03.720 --> 44:13.720
You guys had, we met at Stan Lee's Kamikaze Expo in line to meet Stan Lee,

44:13.720 --> 44:18.720
which I was told was happening because Stan Lee wanted to meet me.

44:18.720 --> 44:25.720
And you had been told was happening because you were a contest winner

44:25.720 --> 44:28.720
and got to meet Stan Lee and both of us experienced the same thing,

44:28.720 --> 44:33.720
which is a very confusing kind of awkward.

44:33.720 --> 44:35.720
If you had told me this was how it was going to work,

44:35.720 --> 44:39.720
I could have opted out like kind of meeting with a very beleaguered,

44:39.720 --> 44:41.720
not beleaguered, he wasn't cranky.

44:41.720 --> 44:44.720
He's just kind of, he's Stan Lee, he's got bigger fish to fry.

44:44.720 --> 44:46.720
He's just kind of like, what?

44:46.720 --> 44:48.720
Hello, hello, hello.

44:48.720 --> 44:50.720
He's got a pep in his step.

44:50.720 --> 44:52.720
I mean, he's really, as far as what I see him,

44:52.720 --> 44:54.720
he's walking around like he's 20 years old.

44:54.720 --> 44:55.720
Yeah, I don't know how old he is.

44:55.720 --> 44:56.720
93.

44:56.720 --> 44:57.720
Jesus.

44:57.720 --> 44:58.720
Yes.

44:58.720 --> 45:01.720
He's 93 years old and he walks around.

45:01.720 --> 45:06.720
I mean, we pick up patients every day that they're 30 years old

45:06.720 --> 45:09.720
and they're like, I can't walk to the gurney.

45:09.720 --> 45:10.720
Well, what happened?

45:10.720 --> 45:11.720
I stubbed my toe.

45:11.720 --> 45:12.720
Really?

45:12.720 --> 45:14.720
This is what you're going to go with when we get to the hospital.

45:14.720 --> 45:15.720
You stubbed your toe.

45:15.720 --> 45:16.720
You don't need to go to the hospital.

45:16.720 --> 45:17.720
Yes, I do.

45:17.720 --> 45:20.720
Stan Lee's walking around in 93 like he's, you know, the godfather

45:20.720 --> 45:23.720
and you can't get to the gurney because you stubbed your toe.

45:23.720 --> 45:24.720
Yeah.

45:24.720 --> 45:25.720
Yeah, so he's doing great.

45:25.720 --> 45:27.720
Honestly, yeah, if you guys haven't met him and want to meet him,

45:27.720 --> 45:29.720
yeah, soon.

45:29.720 --> 45:32.720
But maybe he's never stubbed his toe.

45:32.720 --> 45:35.720
Maybe Stan Lee is only 93 because somehow,

45:35.720 --> 45:38.720
and then he's going to stub his toe and just shatter like close.

45:38.720 --> 45:40.720
Oh, just sick.

45:40.720 --> 45:42.720
Knock on wood.

45:42.720 --> 45:46.720
But anyways, we met him, which was essentially, it was like,

45:46.720 --> 45:48.720
it was like, Stan Lee wants to meet you.

45:48.720 --> 45:50.720
Well, no, he doesn't.

45:50.720 --> 45:53.720
We were brought to the front of an autograph line

45:53.720 --> 45:56.720
at a standard convention thing and then it was like,

45:56.720 --> 45:59.720
let me introduce you to, this is Dan Harmon.

45:59.720 --> 46:01.720
He has a show called Rick and Morty.

46:01.720 --> 46:03.720
Oh, is that on the radio?

46:03.720 --> 46:07.720
He said something like, I didn't know if he was doing a bit or not

46:07.720 --> 46:10.720
or if that was like, I don't know if that was like a Stan Lee standard bit

46:10.720 --> 46:16.720
or if he really was like, hey, maybe, I mean, maybe it's on the radio.

46:16.720 --> 46:18.720
But anyways, we...

46:18.720 --> 46:20.720
Radio TV shows are what he knows.

46:20.720 --> 46:21.720
Yeah, yeah.

46:21.720 --> 46:22.720
That's what you grew up on.

46:22.720 --> 46:24.720
Like you guys...

46:24.720 --> 46:26.720
So then you were standing there and I was like,

46:26.720 --> 46:28.720
I was wondering who the hell are these guys?

46:28.720 --> 46:31.720
I thought maybe you were like, you could have been somebody from a CW show

46:31.720 --> 46:33.720
or something, I didn't know.

46:33.720 --> 46:37.720
I was there to do a panel and then meet Stan Lee

46:37.720 --> 46:39.720
and then you guys were there, you were cosplaying,

46:39.720 --> 46:41.720
you were your Green Lantern.

46:41.720 --> 46:43.720
I was the Flash that day.

46:43.720 --> 46:46.720
We did a group as the Blue Lanterns

46:46.720 --> 46:50.720
and my character was the Flash that had been recruited by the Blue Lanterns.

46:50.720 --> 46:52.720
Those Lanterns.

46:52.720 --> 46:54.720
Yeah.

46:54.720 --> 46:56.720
It was a simple hope.

46:56.720 --> 46:58.720
You love the Lantern mythology like that?

46:58.720 --> 47:01.720
Actually, I do enjoy a lot of the Lantern mythology.

47:01.720 --> 47:06.720
I think it shows the perspective of a lot of people's personalities

47:06.720 --> 47:09.720
and how we're all different and how things balance out

47:09.720 --> 47:11.720
and keep each other in check.

47:11.720 --> 47:15.720
Because if you're a Green Lantern, you're basing it on willpower.

47:15.720 --> 47:17.720
Willpower, right? What's blue again?

47:17.720 --> 47:18.720
Hope.

47:18.720 --> 47:20.720
Hope versus willpower.

47:20.720 --> 47:24.720
See, you could have willpower and bring that to bear with hope.

47:24.720 --> 47:27.720
Couldn't you hope with will, with a strong will?

47:27.720 --> 47:29.720
Yes, I think.

47:29.720 --> 47:31.720
Or be angry with a strong will.

47:31.720 --> 47:34.720
But you could have a strong will and still be like, oh, I can't do this.

47:34.720 --> 47:36.720
This sucks.

47:36.720 --> 47:38.720
I don't want to get out of bed.

47:38.720 --> 47:40.720
I work at Walmart.

47:40.720 --> 47:42.720
Was that anywhere?

47:42.720 --> 47:44.720
Anywhere.

47:44.720 --> 47:46.720
There we go.

47:46.720 --> 47:48.720
Okay, well, I don't know.

47:48.720 --> 47:50.720
There's a thing. I'm a verbal thinker.

47:50.720 --> 47:54.720
I don't like the superpower where I can make a green thing in front of me.

47:54.720 --> 47:57.720
And then it's like, oh, no, there's a yellow thing.

47:57.720 --> 47:59.720
That's my worst enemy.

47:59.720 --> 48:01.720
I was like, what is the green thing?

48:01.720 --> 48:03.720
The green thing is like a machine gun.

48:03.720 --> 48:05.720
I made a green machine gun.

48:05.720 --> 48:07.720
And I was like, oh, great.

48:07.720 --> 48:09.720
That's clever that you thought of a machine gun.

48:09.720 --> 48:12.720
Anyways, I don't want to shit on your life.

48:12.720 --> 48:15.720
Katrina, what were you dressed as?

48:15.720 --> 48:18.720
I was debuting Jack Skellington Assassin.

48:18.720 --> 48:21.720
So Assassin's Creed, Jack Skellington version.

48:21.720 --> 48:22.720
Nice.

48:22.720 --> 48:26.720
And you guys are married, which I thought was so cool.

48:26.720 --> 48:29.720
Congratulations, by the way.

48:29.720 --> 48:31.720
I like what you said that you were debuting it.

48:31.720 --> 48:35.720
That was the inaugural go at this particular cosplay?

48:35.720 --> 48:38.720
It was. I had just finished it the night before.

48:38.720 --> 48:41.720
But yeah, it was where I debuted that new cosplay.

48:41.720 --> 48:43.720
Did it get some love? Did you get some good attention for that?

48:43.720 --> 48:45.720
It actually did. It was a big hit.

48:45.720 --> 48:47.720
Are you all right, Tolome?

48:47.720 --> 48:48.720
No, I'm good.

48:48.720 --> 48:50.720
He's asleep now.

48:50.720 --> 48:53.720
I'm kind of a fan of the lantern situation,

48:53.720 --> 48:55.720
but I'm trying to keep my mouth shut.

48:55.720 --> 48:57.720
Well, all right. I mean, sell me on Green Lantern.

48:57.720 --> 48:58.720
Look, Eric.

48:58.720 --> 48:59.720
It's imagination.

48:59.720 --> 49:00.720
Eric Esquivel.

49:00.720 --> 49:01.720
He sold me on Superman.

49:01.720 --> 49:03.720
Like, I fucking love Superman now, you know?

49:03.720 --> 49:04.720
Like, tell me about you.

49:04.720 --> 49:06.720
Well, so here's the thing about Superman.

49:06.720 --> 49:08.720
In my opinion, like all of these things came from

49:08.720 --> 49:12.720
an aspect of human nature that was then expanded

49:12.720 --> 49:14.720
upon as a what if.

49:14.720 --> 49:18.720
It's as like the natural incarnation of that thing.

49:18.720 --> 49:20.720
And one of the things that we have as humans

49:20.720 --> 49:21.720
is imagination.

49:21.720 --> 49:24.720
Like, what if I could just imagine something

49:24.720 --> 49:27.720
to will it into place?

49:27.720 --> 49:30.720
The colors thing, that is a currency that it's using.

49:30.720 --> 49:31.720
There's just like differences,

49:31.720 --> 49:33.720
and there's a lot of card games that are based on that colors

49:33.720 --> 49:34.720
or what have you.

49:34.720 --> 49:37.720
But the essence of what wouldn't be cool is

49:37.720 --> 49:38.720
if I could lift something,

49:38.720 --> 49:40.720
what if I could lift a million things?

49:40.720 --> 49:42.720
You know what I mean?

49:42.720 --> 49:43.720
It's just an extension of a human trait.

49:43.720 --> 49:45.720
And this trait is imagination itself.

49:45.720 --> 49:47.720
And that is a really cool thing to follow.

49:47.720 --> 49:51.720
Like, it's so fun to like celebrate that as a power.

49:51.720 --> 49:53.720
And a physical incarnation of that power.

49:53.720 --> 49:56.720
But is it the idea that the ring gives you more imagination,

49:56.720 --> 49:58.720
or is it the ring that could focus your imagination

49:58.720 --> 50:01.720
so you need to be imaginative to use it right?

50:01.720 --> 50:03.720
Because he could just shoot people with green

50:03.720 --> 50:04.720
blast of energy and kill them.

50:04.720 --> 50:05.720
And it works.

50:05.720 --> 50:06.720
That is also part of his imagination.

50:06.720 --> 50:07.720
Whatever it's, whatever it's commanded with.

50:07.720 --> 50:10.720
Also, he could just cover himself with a green shield

50:10.720 --> 50:11.720
that protects him against damage.

50:11.720 --> 50:14.720
So he could just do that the whole time.

50:14.720 --> 50:15.720
He kind of does.

50:15.720 --> 50:16.720
All these things.

50:16.720 --> 50:18.720
And DC suffers from this across the board.

50:18.720 --> 50:20.720
So I think it's beautiful is that it's all overpowered.

50:20.720 --> 50:21.720
All of these things are overpowered.

50:21.720 --> 50:23.720
And that's why it's difficult for them to like figure out

50:23.720 --> 50:24.720
how to make these things human.

50:24.720 --> 50:26.720
But it is an amazing,

50:26.720 --> 50:30.720
it's just an amazing currency to play with the idea of imagination.

50:30.720 --> 50:33.720
And I like that they went with it because he had so much power,

50:33.720 --> 50:34.720
the power of imagination,

50:34.720 --> 50:36.720
that he eventually just went crazy.

50:36.720 --> 50:37.720
Which I think is so interesting.

50:37.720 --> 50:38.720
Well, yeah.

50:38.720 --> 50:39.720
They're getting into,

50:39.720 --> 50:40.720
I'm sure if I read every,

50:40.720 --> 50:43.720
like Green Lantern obviously goes all the way.

50:43.720 --> 50:44.720
Just don't watch the movie.

50:44.720 --> 50:45.720
I only know him from the surface.

50:45.720 --> 50:46.720
It's just like the guy with the green,

50:46.720 --> 50:48.720
with the ring and the thing.

50:48.720 --> 50:49.720
Yeah, sorry.

50:49.720 --> 50:50.720
The, uh...

50:50.720 --> 50:54.720
But just make a green Superman.

50:54.720 --> 51:00.720
Spencer's point is about that I never...

51:00.720 --> 51:01.720
And just to be clear,

51:01.720 --> 51:02.720
I don't hate Green Lantern.

51:02.720 --> 51:05.720
You brought this on and then we talked about it.

51:05.720 --> 51:06.720
Like I think it's...

51:06.720 --> 51:07.720
I said, what do you think of Green Lantern?

51:07.720 --> 51:09.720
But then you said something that I thought was interesting

51:09.720 --> 51:12.720
because I don't think this stuff through enough.

51:12.720 --> 51:15.720
But you said, what you just said,

51:15.720 --> 51:20.720
DC characters, it's all like gods basically.

51:20.720 --> 51:21.720
Unless you count Batman,

51:21.720 --> 51:24.720
but there's Marvel characters.

51:24.720 --> 51:27.720
DC characters are defined by one weakness.

51:27.720 --> 51:28.720
They all have like a kryptonite.

51:28.720 --> 51:31.720
And then Marvel characters are,

51:31.720 --> 51:35.720
you know, they're all kind of, in one sense or another,

51:35.720 --> 51:38.720
regular Joes who have one power.

51:38.720 --> 51:39.720
Yes.

51:39.720 --> 51:42.720
Like that kind of like fucks up their life.

51:42.720 --> 51:43.720
Exactly.

51:43.720 --> 51:45.720
But if you look at it, it's like a 70's movie thing.

51:45.720 --> 51:46.720
You're a superhero.

51:46.720 --> 51:47.720
You cannot date.

51:47.720 --> 51:48.720
Sorry.

51:48.720 --> 51:49.720
No, no, it's okay.

51:49.720 --> 51:51.720
I'm gonna stop talking because I'm just gonna keep talking.

51:51.720 --> 51:52.720
No, come on.

51:52.720 --> 51:53.720
You're Ptolemae.

51:53.720 --> 51:54.720
I mean, we can't...

51:54.720 --> 51:57.720
Look at it like in the 70's version, right?

51:57.720 --> 51:59.720
So there's 70's films and there's films that come after it

51:59.720 --> 52:00.720
that are just like archetypes.

52:00.720 --> 52:05.720
But these things came at a time in our world that is much,

52:05.720 --> 52:08.720
that is in the past, long time ago.

52:08.720 --> 52:13.720
So the idea of extending a human trait to its maximum was

52:13.720 --> 52:15.720
brand new and had never happened before.

52:15.720 --> 52:18.720
So they weren't perceiving how this would need to be

52:18.720 --> 52:19.720
modified in the future.

52:19.720 --> 52:23.720
They were, they, from a single individual that is a living

52:23.720 --> 52:26.720
person to the godlike power that they were given,

52:26.720 --> 52:28.720
really expanded people's imagination.

52:28.720 --> 52:31.720
And expanded like their experience of the world around them.

52:31.720 --> 52:32.720
There was purpose to these things.

52:32.720 --> 52:34.720
So it was this big thing and they still gave them that

52:34.720 --> 52:36.720
weakness, which I think is fascinating.

52:36.720 --> 52:37.720
It's an interesting archetype.

52:37.720 --> 52:40.720
And I don't think it holds up as well or as easily as today.

52:40.720 --> 52:43.720
So I'm not arguing one against the other, but these are

52:43.720 --> 52:44.720
fascinating.

52:44.720 --> 52:47.720
I think they're fascinating like tools for storytelling.

52:47.720 --> 52:50.720
And I think people don't quite understand like the lineage

52:50.720 --> 52:53.720
of where it came from even in the same way that people don't

52:53.720 --> 52:55.720
like 70's movies now because they're not great.

52:55.720 --> 52:57.720
But they were really fascinating at the time when there were

52:57.720 --> 52:58.720
no rules.

52:58.720 --> 52:59.720
Right.

52:59.720 --> 53:01.720
But are we supposed to look at them through that lens?

53:01.720 --> 53:03.720
I guess, yeah, when I watch a Woody Allen movie, I'm like,

53:03.720 --> 53:06.720
part of my appreciation is he wasn't famous for being Woody

53:06.720 --> 53:07.720
Allen yet.

53:07.720 --> 53:09.720
This is amazing that he put himself in a movie even though

53:09.720 --> 53:13.720
he's not sexy and he's like, just decided to cast himself as

53:13.720 --> 53:14.720
the romantic lead.

53:14.720 --> 53:15.720
Like that's hilarious.

53:15.720 --> 53:21.720
Like, I am looking at it through a cultural retro lens.

53:21.720 --> 53:23.720
And his level of honesty was way too far.

53:23.720 --> 53:25.720
Because if I look at it through a modern lens, I'm like,

53:25.720 --> 53:30.720
I don't like Woody Allen movies anymore.

53:30.720 --> 53:34.720
I'm fascinated by the idea that, like, I fortunately have

53:34.720 --> 53:37.720
never had to be in an ambulance with EMTs.

53:37.720 --> 53:40.720
But I like the idea that the EMTs that come and get you might

53:40.720 --> 53:43.720
also have been cosplaying the night before.

53:43.720 --> 53:44.720
Yes.

53:44.720 --> 53:47.720
Let's get into your vocation because that's what's fascinating.

53:47.720 --> 53:49.720
So I just learned in the green room, for instance,

53:49.720 --> 53:51.720
EMTs totally different from paramedics.

53:51.720 --> 53:53.720
Not totally different, but different.

53:53.720 --> 53:54.720
I always thought it was synonymous.

53:54.720 --> 54:01.720
EMTs are alarmingly close to a person that got out of high

54:01.720 --> 54:04.720
school and wants to work with blood and guts for a living.

54:04.720 --> 54:05.720
Yeah, that's basic.

54:05.720 --> 54:08.720
Not to knock your vocation, but actually to praise you because

54:08.720 --> 54:09.720
it's a very low paying job.

54:09.720 --> 54:10.720
Go ahead.

54:10.720 --> 54:11.720
You take it from here.

54:11.720 --> 54:12.720
Yeah.

54:12.720 --> 54:15.720
Well, first of all, thank you for saying I'm out of high

54:15.720 --> 54:16.720
school.

54:16.720 --> 54:18.720
I'm actually 30 now, so I must look good.

54:18.720 --> 54:20.720
Beyond that, yeah, it's true.

54:20.720 --> 54:25.720
Basically, it's considered a certificate that you would get

54:25.720 --> 54:32.720
in a college setting, but ultimately, our schooling and

54:32.720 --> 54:35.720
stuff is about six to nine months, and there's even

54:35.720 --> 54:37.720
accelerated programs, which you can do it in like two.

54:37.720 --> 54:39.720
I don't recommend that to anybody.

54:39.720 --> 54:41.720
Imagine trying to understand all this information in two

54:41.720 --> 54:43.720
months, and really that's not even true.

54:43.720 --> 54:45.720
I don't recommend that to the injured.

54:45.720 --> 54:48.720
Yeah, we're sending the guy out.

54:48.720 --> 54:51.720
He's got his GT, and he took it weekend intensive.

54:51.720 --> 54:56.720
That's exactly why I didn't do that, because in my

54:56.720 --> 54:59.720
opinion, if your life is in my hands, the last thing you

54:59.720 --> 55:02.720
want to know is I've been practicing this for the past

55:02.720 --> 55:03.720
four weeks.

55:03.720 --> 55:05.720
Don't worry, you're going to be okay.

55:05.720 --> 55:07.720
How do I do this again?

55:07.720 --> 55:08.720
It's okay.

55:08.720 --> 55:11.720
I've been doing this for every weekend for the past month.

55:11.720 --> 55:12.720
You're good.

55:12.720 --> 55:15.720
And you said an EMT's job is to stabilize.

55:15.720 --> 55:18.720
You arrive at the scene, it's like tourniquets,

55:18.720 --> 55:20.720
splints, I don't know, whatever.

55:20.720 --> 55:24.720
Splinting, bleeding control, so tourniquets, breathing

55:24.720 --> 55:25.720
for people?

55:25.720 --> 55:26.720
We actually are able to do that.

55:26.720 --> 55:27.720
Ventilating, yes.

55:27.720 --> 55:28.720
Ventilating.

55:28.720 --> 55:29.720
Like tracheotomies?

55:29.720 --> 55:30.720
You ever have to punch a hole?

55:30.720 --> 55:31.720
No tricks.

55:31.720 --> 55:32.720
No tricks.

55:32.720 --> 55:33.720
Oh, okay.

55:33.720 --> 55:34.720
You have the little mask that you put over people's

55:34.720 --> 55:36.720
faces, and you squeeze the bags.

55:36.720 --> 55:38.720
Are able to breathe for them until the paramedics come

55:38.720 --> 55:41.720
and can stick tubes down their throat and intubate them.

55:41.720 --> 55:43.720
Yeah, and the difference basically between like EMT

55:43.720 --> 55:46.720
and paramedics, so EMT, basically we are their

55:46.720 --> 55:48.720
assistants, if you want to put it that way.

55:48.720 --> 55:49.720
We assist them.

55:49.720 --> 55:51.720
We're the nurses to their doctor.

55:51.720 --> 55:52.720
Right.

55:52.720 --> 55:55.720
And the paramedics spend a lot more time in school to get

55:55.720 --> 56:00.720
their medical license and basically, as I said, our job is

56:00.720 --> 56:03.720
to stabilize the patient to get them to the hospital in

56:03.720 --> 56:05.720
under 10 minutes, hopefully.

56:05.720 --> 56:08.720
And in that time, once we get there, the nurses and the doctors

56:08.720 --> 56:11.720
and the ER take over and they go ahead and make sure that

56:11.720 --> 56:12.720
you're able to revitalize the person.

56:12.720 --> 56:17.720
So if a 911 call goes out, an EMT is a responder on that.

56:17.720 --> 56:19.720
Yeah, so the EMT likely is the person driving.

56:19.720 --> 56:22.720
The paramedic is going to be in the passenger seat because

56:22.720 --> 56:24.720
he's got to be first to...

56:24.720 --> 56:26.720
Or she.

56:26.720 --> 56:27.720
Or she.

56:27.720 --> 56:28.720
I apologize.

56:28.720 --> 56:29.720
Yes.

56:29.720 --> 56:33.720
I believe I cry.

56:33.720 --> 56:36.720
Gender equality, this guy.

56:36.720 --> 56:39.720
Dan's Marvel superpower is that he learned that he can

56:39.720 --> 56:45.720
high road you without doing anything really, let that heros get off.

56:45.720 --> 56:52.720
Imagine harnessing the power to high road.

56:52.720 --> 56:56.720
I thought you guys were married because I'm not racist.

56:56.720 --> 57:03.720
Oh, God.

57:03.720 --> 57:05.720
But he has a weakness.

57:05.720 --> 57:06.720
Yes.

57:06.720 --> 57:08.720
I see race.

57:08.720 --> 57:11.720
I can't stop seeing it.

57:11.720 --> 57:13.720
It's everywhere.

57:13.720 --> 57:15.720
You said you were from Kenya, right?

57:15.720 --> 57:22.720
No.

57:22.720 --> 57:31.720
I'm basically like the last guy that deserves to say I'm Kenyan.

57:31.720 --> 57:41.720
You guys told me something.

57:41.720 --> 57:47.720
I want to honor your candor.

57:47.720 --> 57:50.720
I think people will understand this.

57:50.720 --> 57:54.720
You guys work in human plumbing for a living.

57:54.720 --> 57:59.720
You show up and people are ripped apart.

57:59.720 --> 58:01.720
You have things knocked off of them.

58:01.720 --> 58:05.720
People are in various states of biological chaos and your job is to stabilize it.

58:05.720 --> 58:06.720
What's that?

58:06.720 --> 58:08.720
Different parts of decay.

58:08.720 --> 58:17.720
And so you shared with me in the green room, you guys among yourselves, just as I think

58:17.720 --> 58:22.720
writers in writers' rooms go to some pretty dark places that don't necessarily have anything

58:22.720 --> 58:26.720
to do with the jokes that end up in the Big Bang Theory.

58:26.720 --> 58:29.720
You guys go to fucking dark.

58:29.720 --> 58:33.720
You said you got a YouTube video that was like a private link to a YouTube video.

58:33.720 --> 58:39.720
Basically, our Christmas parties are who has the goriest pictures and who has the goriest stories.

58:39.720 --> 58:43.720
It's not so much that we're like six sadistic people.

58:43.720 --> 58:46.720
It's the fact that that's how we cope with it.

58:46.720 --> 58:52.720
You have to basically make humor out of some of, I'm sorry, to say somebody's darkest day

58:52.720 --> 58:56.720
or their family's darkest day because you've got to be able to come home and be like,

58:56.720 --> 58:57.720
I'm okay.

58:57.720 --> 58:58.720
I'm going to be okay.

58:58.720 --> 59:00.720
It gives you control over it.

59:00.720 --> 59:03.720
It's a very uncontrollable circumstance that you're constantly inserting.

59:03.720 --> 59:05.720
I can see all this stuff all day.

59:05.720 --> 59:07.720
Go home and still be able to lay down and sleep at night.

59:07.720 --> 59:08.720
Exactly.

59:08.720 --> 59:12.720
And otherwise than that, I mean, loving Deadpool is my favorite character.

59:12.720 --> 59:13.720
It does help.

59:13.720 --> 59:17.720
Deadpool makes sense for an EMT.

59:17.720 --> 59:18.720
Exactly.

59:18.720 --> 59:20.720
That's when people are really excited to see me.

59:20.720 --> 59:21.720
I was cosplaying Deadpool this morning.

59:21.720 --> 59:23.720
Now I'm here to help you.

59:23.720 --> 59:26.720
So, because you guys told me, I mean, you were just, I don't know,

59:26.720 --> 59:28.720
it's like, I don't even know why I bring it up again.

59:28.720 --> 59:32.720
It was just like kind of fascinating watching your face, which like,

59:32.720 --> 59:37.720
when you're describing like, you got this video and it was like this guy that got like,

59:37.720 --> 59:39.720
ground up or split apart or something.

59:39.720 --> 59:42.720
And you're kind of like, I was like, like this sort of like,

59:42.720 --> 59:45.720
you might as well have been talking about like architecture.

59:45.720 --> 59:47.720
Arm went this way, head was that way.

59:47.720 --> 59:48.720
Yeah.

59:48.720 --> 59:50.720
That's basically, I mean, and that's how it is.

59:50.720 --> 59:55.720
It's a point of why we kind of do our jobs because whether we're talking about,

59:55.720 --> 01:00:01.720
yes, this video where the guy was going like 170 miles per hour on his motorcycle

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:06.720
and then next part in the video, well, his torso is here, his head is over there

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:12.720
and his legs are split apart like, you know, wishbones, except in the middle are his pants

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:15.720
that are holding the two feet so you can kind of nunchuck them, you know.

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:20.720
You know, it's funny to me because...

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.720
That's what I'm talking about.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:23.720
Like, he's not a bad guy.

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.720
You know, he's a good guy.

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:32.720
But with the people who are only listening to this can't see is how turned on told me is right now.

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:43.720
I had that one in the chamber and I was like, this is going to be the easiest call back.

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:47.720
But there's other days that there's good stories.

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:52.720
So she actually had a really good story that happened not too long ago, the racetrack.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:53.720
Oh, yeah.

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:56.720
So I'm part of a race team.

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:59.720
I don't know if anyone's ever heard of Chuck Waller Raceway.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:00.720
It's way out in Desert Center.

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.720
It's a private racetrack.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.720
We do private race teams.

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:08.720
Not even three weeks ago, I was out there.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.720
It's usually super boring.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:14.720
We lay there or we sit there waiting for something.

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.720
That was a union rule.

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:17.720
We lay there.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:21.720
We sit there.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:25.720
The stretchers are only for the clients.

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:26.720
This is true.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:27.720
Very true.

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:29.720
Yeah.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.720
So we were just sitting there waiting.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:37.720
We wait for people to go down on their motorcycles or crash their cars into the different towers.

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:39.720
Which is exactly what the audience is waiting for.

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:40.720
Yeah, exactly.

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:41.720
Yeah.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:42.720
So we're sitting there waiting.

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:47.720
And like most of the day, it was biker down, riders down.

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:48.720
Okay, rider popped back up.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.720
Back on his bike.

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:50.720
Let's go.

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:53.720
So we hear rider down, second rider down.

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:54.720
Okay, wait.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:56.720
First rider's up.

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:57.720
Oh, shit.

01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:58.720
Second rider's not moving.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:01:59.720
Sorry.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:00.720
Can I say that?

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.720
So second rider's not moving.

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:09.720
He just said nunchucks out of a man's life.

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:10.720
True, true.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.720
Yeah, no, you can say anything you want.

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:13.720
Okay.

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:16.720
So we hear second rider's not getting up.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:24.720
So we flip on our license arenas, shoot across the racetrack, get to him and he's laying face down.

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.720
And we're like, oh crap.

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:27.720
Okay.

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:28.720
Well, we actually have to work today.

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:29.720
Yay.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:30.720
No, it's a lot of fun.

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.720
But so we...

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:35.720
That was a heartwarming story.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.720
You were right.

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:42.720
At first I thought, oh, these nunchucks, that's a tough story.

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.720
But he went right to the heart warmer.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.720
She's like, oh, I get to work today.

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:51.720
No, I kid the injured.

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:55.720
I kid him because I love him.

01:02:55.720 --> 01:03:02.720
Yeah, so we're like, okay, so we rock up, he's face down or whatever.

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:06.720
We do our normal roll him over, support his airway, support his head.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.720
We start taking off his clothes.

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:10.720
We have special leather cutters, start taking his helmet off.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:15.720
And after taking a helmet off, we notice that he's doing a weird thing we call guppy breathing.

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:19.720
So basically it's...

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:21.720
It waits a while.

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:22.720
Okay.

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:25.720
Well, okay, that obviously means he's not breathing.

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.720
Check pulses, no pulses.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:30.720
So it's just me and my partner, me and a medic.

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.720
Just the two of us were like, crap.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.720
Okay, fire department's 15 minutes away.

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:38.720
Helicopters, half an hour away.

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.720
Okay, well, here we go.

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:45.720
So we cut his leathers off, begin CPR, chest compressions, breathing from.

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:49.720
The other rider that went down with them, unfortunately, had broke his arm.

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:53.720
So he's walking up with like a flimsy wrist.

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.720
Like, guys, what do you need?

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.720
I'm ski patrol, but I can try to help.

01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:59.720
Everybody's afraid of the T-Rex.

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:02.720
His name was ski patrol?

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.720
Are they like transformers?

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:07.720
That's badass.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.720
Ski patrol.

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:10.720
Sidewinder.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:11.720
Roll out.

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:13.720
Wheeljack.

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:21.720
So anyway, so we start to do these compressions on him, and we get to shock him, which, believe it or not, is a very rare thing.

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:25.720
When someone has no heartbeat, we hardly ever shock them.

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:27.720
So we got to shock him.

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:29.720
After the third shock, we feel down.

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:31.720
He has pulses.

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.720
We're like, yes, by ourselves, just two of us.

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:39.720
No one, probably the most rewarding thing I've had in a couple years, get him to a helicopter.

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.720
By the time we get him to a helicopter, he's fighting us.

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:43.720
He's like...

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:44.720
Fighting us is a good thing.

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.720
That means you're alive again and wanting to live.

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.720
Yeah, trying to...

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:49.720
Throwing punches at you?

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:50.720
Like, get the fuck off me?

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.720
Yes.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:52.720
Also, you ruined my pants.

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.720
You cut my goddamn letters off.

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:55.720
You ruined my letters!

01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:56.720
You wouldn't be surprised.

01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:01.720
A lot of people get really upset about us cutting their clothes off, trying to save their life.

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:05.720
Is that in a fugue state, or are you...

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:06.720
No, that's just...

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.720
Oh my God, you just cut my $100 pair of pants.

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:10.720
Fuck you, what are you going to do?

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:13.720
I want that money back for that $100.

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:18.720
I mean, obviously the leather he had on was multi-hundred dollars, and he was fighting us away.

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:19.720
We get him in a helicopter.

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:22.720
He's still fighting them, like, leave me alone, leave me alone.

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:24.720
So that was extremely rewarding.

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:26.720
Yeah, so...

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:27.720
To actually...

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.720
Leave me alone, leave me alone.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:34.720
It was rewarding to actually make a difference for once, instead of just taking the person that stubbed their toe,

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:38.720
or, believe it or not, woke up from a bad dream and is scared to be home alone.

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:42.720
So that brings to mind the question, like, what...

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:45.720
It seems to me that there's two things that would bring you to this job.

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:50.720
One is this, like, altruistic thing that's like, oh my God, I love people,

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:54.720
which is why a story like that is so much more fulfilling for you.

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:59.720
Like, I got to do the thing that I want to do today, which is actually...

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:05.720
Which is actually do the zappy paddles and bring somebody from dead to alive,

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:09.720
and if I hadn't been there, they'd be dead, and now I feel good going to bed tonight.

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.720
Exactly. If the two of us weren't there, then...

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:13.720
But that speaks to empathy.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:17.720
And the other thing that makes you good at this job is the other thing we've seen,

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:20.720
which is that you're sociopaths, like, that you...

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:25.720
That you guys can actually somehow, like, you can deal with that stuff without going,

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:28.720
this is a human being, I can't handle looking at their innards.

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:29.720
Right.

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:34.720
Well, 90% of our job, honestly, is transporting patients from one hospital to another.

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:36.720
That's 90% of our job.

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:44.720
10% is actually going code 3 and having to show up at an emergency,

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:52.720
and of that 10%, probably only another 5% of that is actually serious injury

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:55.720
to a point where this is why I love my job, this is why I do it,

01:06:55.720 --> 01:07:01.720
because yeah, we all initially do it because we care about people or we like the job we do,

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:04.720
because as we told you, we don't get paid almost anything.

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.720
Right.

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:07.720
I'm talking about a little bit above minimum wage.

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:08.720
What?

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:09.720
That's it.

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:10.720
Which I was kind of shocked by.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:11.720
Yeah.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:12.720
Good for you.

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:13.720
Good for you.

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:14.720
It's the same thing.

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:17.720
Meaning that they're doing it is, you know...

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:20.720
Yeah, this is not a job you go and get rich quick scheme.

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:23.720
Do people, does America need more EMTs?

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:28.720
We need more specifically paramedics, because again, EMTs do help,

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:31.720
but without the paramedic, because of the scope of practice,

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:35.720
there are certain things we're not allowed to do, even if we know how.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.720
We just, if we do it, we're losing our license.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.720
I did say something, because there's kind of a paramedic shortage.

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:41.720
Yes.

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:45.720
And because there's money to be made, therefore, by these paramedic schools,

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:52.720
which, correct me when I'm wrong, you pay $10,000 to, if you're an EMT,

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:58.720
you pay $10,000 like tuition to a school, do some schooling.

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:06.720
There's barriers between you and being a paramedic that represent money for schools

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:09.720
that are now rushing people into paramedic.

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:11.720
Basically, you graduate EMT school.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:14.720
The next week, they say, hey, give us $10,000.

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.720
We'll make you this paramedic.

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:21.720
Which is scary to think, because this paramedic will go through two years of school, roughly.

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:27.720
And, however, if he spent no time on a rig, this guy basically has spent, or she,

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:39.720
this person, this person, this person now has to literally know how to help people

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:44.720
without ever actually helping a person in their whole career.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.720
They might not know that they're squeamish.

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:47.720
Exactly.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:48.720
It's happened.

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:52.720
They go all the way through school, they go to their first real scene,

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:54.720
and they're like, I can't handle this.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.720
But that's where the EMTs come in.

01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:59.720
You have EMTs like me, who've been doing this for eight years,

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:04.720
that take those new medics and are able to babysit them.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:09.720
But you're the nurse to their doctor, and now you're more qualified than them.

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:10.720
Exactly.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:13.720
So, Trump's going to take care of this, right?

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:16.720
He's going to, he's a businessman.

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:21.720
He'll build a wall to put around the bodies.

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:27.720
If he could put a bigger wall between paramedic and EMT, like maybe that would help, I don't know.

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:30.720
Yeah, I mean, the whole thing is, I get it, you know, everybody has to make their money.

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:34.720
We have to, you know, pay to, you've got to pay to be in a certain profession,

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:37.720
no matter what profession it is, like originally I wanted to be an actor.

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:40.720
There's still money I've got to pay to go to school and do that.

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:47.720
However, the point is, is just, yes, it's those provisions put in the place where you have to do usually a thousand hours

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:50.720
of being at EMT before you can even become a paramedic,

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:55.720
and that's really important for the safety of the population as well as the safety of us.

01:09:55.720 --> 01:10:00.720
And again, it's, you know, it's not a pity party to say that,

01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:05.720
yeah, we would like some more money in this and that, but again, we do our jobs because we enjoy them.

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.720
However, you know, we have our bad days too.

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:12.720
Yeah, even today, unfortunately, one of my divisions, which guys, this is really important,

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:17.720
I bring it up because it's sad to me, but we watched it the other day,

01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.720
and sure enough today, things went wrong.

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:23.720
When we go code three, guys, pull over, please pull over.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:24.720
To the left, please.

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:25.720
Code three means lights and sirens.

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:27.720
Code three means lights and sirens because today,

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:29.720
Wait, what does pull over to the left mean?

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:30.720
That seems important.

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:31.720
Pull to the left side of the road.

01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:33.720
Do not pull to the right because we drive.

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:34.720
I think you're getting that backwards.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:35.720
Oh, sorry, correction, sorry.

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:38.720
Are you sure you're not a dick?

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:42.720
Park perpendicularly perpendicular to the road.

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.720
Pull to the right.

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:48.720
Pull to the right side of the road because we drive on the left side of the road.

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:50.720
Yeah, just like you see any cops or anything else,

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:52.720
and please just double check your mirrors.

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:58.720
Unfortunately today, a SUV went head on with one of my division's rigs,

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:01.720
and we had to fly out our paramedic,

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:05.720
and they were already on a, I said, code three going to a scene,

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.720
and unfortunately they had to be flown out to a trauma center.

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:10.720
So that also means the scene they were going to,

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.720
they had to, took longer for them to get there,

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:14.720
because they had to send a second ambulance,

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:16.720
along with an ambulance to the accident.

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:19.720
Yeah, that's, that's the system.

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:20.720
You okay?

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:22.720
I have a horrible joke.

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:23.720
Go ahead.

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:28.720
I just don't know if you guys show pictures of that paramedic at the party.

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:31.720
Yeah.

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.720
That's going to be up to the paramedic.

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:35.720
Or is that like too personal?

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:37.720
Understand, whenever we show pictures,

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:40.720
we make sure first and foremost that,

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.720
because of the HIPAA laws and stuff,

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:45.720
we don't state names, we don't take pictures of the person's face and stuff like that.

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:47.720
So usually it's nothing identifying.

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.720
Usually it's the wreckage of the car.

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:50.720
Yeah.

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.720
Or, yeah, or if it's a body part that's by itself,

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:54.720
you really can't tell who that is, but.

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.720
Yeah, I don't know.

01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:00.720
But the, the.

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.720
You ever see somebody just dick fly off?

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:05.720
You should see.

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:07.720
Actually yes, actually yes.

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:09.720
Just their dick.

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:11.720
Okay, let's be clear.

01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:12.720
Let's be clear.

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:14.720
I work in Palm Springs, so.

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:15.720
Dicks are flying.

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:17.720
Yes.

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:20.720
The dick mutilation capital of the world.

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.720
Yes, so.

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:25.720
Dick injuries are very common for me.

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:30.720
I'm kind of curious about your own personal injuries.

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:34.720
Do you guys ever like, like, like if you, if you are the way you are,

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:37.720
and you're, and you're able to be comfortable with other people's injuries,

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:40.720
does that make you a little bit like a super person?

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:45.720
Like if you're working on a bandsaw and you lose your pinky, are you less dizzy?

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:47.720
Actually, knock on wood.

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:49.720
I've never broken a bone in my body.

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:54.720
And as far as injuries go, yeah, I, I look at myself and I say, you know, hey,

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.720
you know, pain's going to come, things happen.

01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:59.720
But if you're telling me, yeah, if I, uh, bandsaw in my hand,

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:01.720
no, I'm screaming like a little girl.

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:02.720
Oh my God!

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:04.720
Four little boys.

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:09.720
Non-stop.

01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:11.720
I'm screaming like a baby.

01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:14.720
But what about your kids?

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:15.720
You had two kids, right?

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:16.720
I have three total.

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:17.720
Three total.

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:19.720
So one of each.

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:23.720
Wait, I didn't hear.

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:24.720
This is true.

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.720
Wait.

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.720
I'm going to actually need to go back over that afterwards.

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:35.720
That, that, but have they, have they, have they, have they,

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:37.720
have they, have they, can't ever like just fall it on their face

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:39.720
or like just blood and everything and like.

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:44.720
Actually, the, uh, first time that I've ever had to do anything that was,

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:49.720
um, medically, uh, induced help was my first, uh, child,

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:53.720
me being the wonderful father I am, I was a county change on the bed

01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:56.720
and he got a hold of a quarter when I walked out of the room

01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:59.720
and, uh, swallowed the quarter partially.

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:03.720
And I had to do, uh, backthrest and kind of the Heimlich maneuver

01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:07.720
while he's actively vomiting everywhere.

01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:11.720
And that's the only thing that kept me happy is if he's vomiting,

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:13.720
there's, there's airway.

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:17.720
So, but eventually a quarter popped out before we had to go to the hospital.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:18.720
So, Holy smokes.

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:19.720
Very thankful for that.

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:23.720
And, um, that's the only thing I've done so far.

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:26.720
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, so Starburn's, my studio, we, we had, uh, Dino and I

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:31.720
had lunch with, uh, uh, our, uh, C, CFO, our, uh, head accountant,

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:36.720
uh, uh, uh, Pleasant Mormon fellow who is, uh, we had hired who,

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.720
who, to, to, to, to turn our business around for us.

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:42.720
And, and we were, we were talking to him about, uh, uh, uh, uh,

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:47.920
uh, uh, you know, uh, oh, we should, we should get health benefits for all the

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:50.640
everybody. And it's so great that you're here. Thank you so much. And then he

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:55.520
started choking on his, uh, skirt steak, uh, that he was eating. And Dino and I

01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:01.480
just kind of like sat there. It was like, it was like an out of body

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:04.800
experience, but with it where you don't like, I wasn't doing, I was looking at

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:10.200
myself doing nothing. He was like, why are you choking on my dinner table? Stop

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:13.760
that. We did, in the seventies, it seemed like there was a movement to like

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:16.680
teach people about the Heimlich, you know, there was like a big movement.

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:21.400
This is like, like, like this is like, you know, it's like, is there anything you

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:25.320
could just verbally impart to me when I said, I, because I know the general idea

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:30.440
is, I know I shouldn't sit there, but, but, but, but like, like, like, I mean, I

01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:35.440
don't know, like, did he die? You never finished. No, he just, he stood up out of

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:43.440
the booth. Dino and I were still sitting. We were so slow in reacting that the bar

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:50.080
tender at little Dom's made it all the way around the bar and said, are you okay

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:55.720
as he finally barfed up a little piece of steak onto the floor? And Dino and I

01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:01.080
were still sitting. And I just look about, I was like, that's the day I learned I'm a

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:05.520
fucking horrible, like, I'm just like, like, like, I got to change something, but I, I,

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:11.920
I won't, right? Like, I'll, my only, I don't want to be, I was just like, I didn't, I

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:18.640
didn't do anything. But that's like, this is the, what the Marvel universe is. Like,

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:24.600
it's 100% weaknesses, but one power, one gender power. And that's, yeah, I have the

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:30.840
ability to proclaim myself feminist. That's it. If a woman is choking, I'll just

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:36.520
be like, I don't know what to tell you. If they, if they have a historic election dangled

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:41.800
in front of them and then snatched away, I'll just be like, all right, take it easy.

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:46.360
I think I told the story before, but I almost died on a corn dog at Wienerschnitzel in high

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:50.840
school. And, and I was like, Oh, fuck it. This is how I die. I die on a fucking corn

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:55.440
dog. Cause I was trying to get a bite of the corn dog and I bit too much and the guy did

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:58.960
a joke of giving me more than I wanted. So I got the whole corn dog and I bit it off and

01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:04.600
now I got a corn dog in my throat and I just, I'm, and everyone just sat there and I'm

01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:08.360
dying and I can't breathe at all. And you can't swallow it. It's not coming back up.

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:12.440
There's no way to get a hand on it. And my friend Brandon Morgan, who we call Bam Bam

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:15.760
because he was just really strong. All right. He just fucking picked me up by the ankles

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:24.520
and shook it on out. He fucking, he got it done.

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:30.640
How tall was Bam Bam? I was you by the ankles. No, I was little. I was like five foot four

01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:37.440
when I was like a freshman in high school. Bam Bam, everything. He was my best friend.

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:42.760
Everything on my shitty Volkswagen Shirako, my 81 Shirako. It was, I love that car. It

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:46.560
was a piece of garbage and everything on the passenger side because Bam Bam was always

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:49.800
in there. Everything was broken. He would just close the door and the handle will come

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:55.720
off in his hand. All the knobs and anything that he could touch on his side was off. So

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:58.960
we had to get in and out of that side of the car like the General Lee. Like you had to

01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:06.720
fuck it. All right. Well, Alan and Katrina, thank you so much for sharing your, your lives

01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:14.920
with us. So you're living together and there's a will they won't they going on there, but

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:24.040
it's not, it's the living situation comes down to California prices. Yeah, but it's

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:27.120
just amazing. I was talking to the green room and I became kind of ashamed of myself because

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:30.840
I'm like, you guys watching Westworld and like your answer was like, it had so much

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:36.360
to do with like, well, once a year when HBO is, is has a package for $10 less, like we

01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:40.360
said, it's like, you guys are living hand to mouth and you're, then you're just showing

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:44.280
up whenever everybody else who's like, you know, I don't know, it's just kind of fucked

01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:47.880
up. Like we should pay teachers more. We should pay cops more. We should pay EMTs more. We

01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:53.040
should pay everybody more. But like, like, like, you know, I don't know, maybe, maybe

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:56.040
we can have some Harmontown scholarship to make sure you guys make it to the paramedic

01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:02.760
level where I'm sure it's like $8 an hour. Right. I'll, I'll, I'll, we'll, we'll, we'll,

01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:08.520
we'll figure it out. I feel like I might put more into the Big Bang Theory slot machine

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:14.120
than you guys need to like, like get up there. There was a, there was a Kickstarter that happened

01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:17.960
because somebody stole your glass that, that Jane made. Like, it was like, like, what,

01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:23.640
we should do Kickstarter for just people that, that, that don't barf when they see your dick

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:32.320
fly off. Yes, we should. We should. That's kind of a rough pitch, but you got, you got

01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:37.080
the idea. Yeah. So, so everybody pull over when you, when you, when you, for, for ambulance

01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:44.080
pull over to the left and the right. Just do a series of figure eights. Even if you, even

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:48.360
if you just at least stop, just stop, just let us move around you, go around you, something

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:51.960
of that nature. I'll start stopping when you start spelling words in the right direction.

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:58.960
Right. Fucking spelling ship backwards. They're anticipating your backwards viewing of it.

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:06.320
Right. All right. Well, so, so, so if you guys don't mind saying goodbye to the, let's

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:16.320
thank Katrina and Alan. You can go back in the, in the, in the holding tank. I'm not

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:24.320
very good at running the show. That was great. There's more people I wanted to meet. Is

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:29.600
a, I can't believe we missed 9-11 when we had EMGs out here. That was sad. I saw it.

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:34.600
I saw it, but you saw, you son of a bitch. You just issued that much restraints. Yeah.

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:40.960
That was a missed opportunity. He'll be fine. Speaking of 9-11, you know, I was at the Las

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:48.080
Vegas airport today and the TSA like slowed to a crawl and like detained Cody and I and

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:52.360
like, I was getting so cranky and like, I was, I'm going to miss the show and I'm so

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:57.080
pissed. Fuck it's TSA. Fuck the TSA. These fucking assholes like, look at them like,

01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:02.360
like blah, blah, blah. But it turns out like, like we were slowed down because both Cody

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:11.600
and I were carrying knives from Death Valley that I bought, I bought, I bought at a store

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:16.120
a knife that said Cody and a knife that said Dan and we had them in our luggage and they

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:23.880
got both of us. And I was like, we had flown from Los Angeles to Las Vegas with those knives.

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:28.640
So congratulations Las Vegas TSA. I like, you went from being my least favorite people

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:32.600
to because I don't want to be on a plane. If you can get on there with a knife, I didn't

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:37.440
know I had the knife. I had fucking knives. Anyways, wait, did you lose them? Did you

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:40.800
have to surrender your knife? Yeah, I had to throw them away. I mean, they had $10

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:47.320
knives, but you can, but I mean, come on. It's all terrible. The knives were 10 bucks

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:52.320
at a gift store and you know, I don't know. I just like, like we were late for, we weren't

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:56.760
late, but I'm lazy. I don't want to fill out a form. Then you get like junk mail, I'm sure

01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:03.880
from the TSA. They're like, Hey, if you'd ask about our condo deals. What were you going

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:26.200
to say? You can, if it's precious, you can have it mailed. Well here, wait, this I can

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:32.960
solve. Wait, you would, I was invading. You're going to pay her for the knife, but you're

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:40.680
not going to pay the EMTs. I can't afford HBO. I don't have $10,000 in my pocket. I have

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:45.760
no, you could have bought them an HBO for a subscription. Oh, that's true. Well, this

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:50.840
is for them. Okay. $100. I'll pretend I have spent a big bank. Who else is in hard times

01:22:50.840 --> 01:23:01.840
right now? Dantan and not money. Anybody? We should really have an ATM here.

01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:15.960
I spent my last 120. Well, wait, I, I, I, I, I, I, there's other people I wanted to,

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:23.120
oh yeah. Yeah. Now he's got guests to bring out. Yeah. Is the, is the, is the guy, who

01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:27.960
is the guy that was tweeting the, is the, he's here. I saw him put up a sign towards the

01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:33.440
front of the stage. All right. Human, human party guy. Where, okay. Do you want to come

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:46.600
up? Come on up. Human party stranger. Oh, hello. You are. Yeah. Hello. This is on purpose.

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:50.760
This is strategic. Oh, thank you. Okay. There's a gentleman in a kilt and a t-shirt handing

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:57.680
out gifts. It's the Las Vegas class. Just hot as a God damn pistol. He's got all sorts

01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:02.920
of labels on his back. You're handing me a vapor with his weed. This is some sort of

01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:09.400
American. Oh, what's your name, sir? My name is John Roswell. John Roswell? No. And what

01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:16.960
did you bring for me? I actually was going to bring you my luckiest 20. But then I was

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:22.360
going to give you that. Get closer. Get closer because he's, no, no, no, I'm fine. No, no,

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:28.080
I'm not, I'm not a real vapy weedy type. You could use a better than me. All right. No,

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:38.720
I still want it. If you're not giving a dispenser. Are you about to sell us real estate or what's

01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:47.440
happening here? More or less. He's got a kilt on. Well, grab a mic. Yeah. Yes. Eat the

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:55.760
mic. Eat the mic. Yeah. So you might crush my dream tonight. So before anything happens,

01:24:55.760 --> 01:25:00.400
switch cameras on. Just the red light. Look at the red light. Baby, I love you. I love

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:04.800
you so much. My beautiful wife, Heather, got me here and my son, D'Artagnan. This is for

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:10.960
you. Maybe are you in the agency with his dad? No, you can go. This is going to get

01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:21.800
weird. So it's already weird. Don't just miss my guests. Now, Dan, I even have props, but

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:26.760
we'll see if we get to that. All right. The poster that was brought up. Right. So how do

01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:32.320
you want me to do this, Dan? Well, I mean, I'll I feel like you're prepared, right? What's

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:37.480
that? You seem very prepared for what's about to happen. Let me get the backstory. Would

01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:40.960
you want to sit or do you want to stock the stage like a panther the whole time? Oh my

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:44.800
God. All right. All right. I've never done anything like this before in my life. I would

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:49.320
give you all there's about a 50 50 chance I throw up on you people. Okay. I've never

01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:54.480
been on stage. I've never I have a didn't do drama. I don't have a script. I'm trying

01:25:54.480 --> 01:26:00.880
to sell. I'm not a failed actor. I live in Washington. Getting here was insane. I flew

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:07.160
just for this because you finally told me give it a shot and oh, hold on. I've got hold

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:12.160
on. Oh, and I'm going to start a Kickstarter and this shirt is going to be on there. It's

01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:16.640
very important to what I'm doing. All right. Because my point is we're all we still need

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:26.240
the mic though. Let's just tear the show. All right. This is for you. Okay. This show

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:38.120
has become my character. It's become a Charles Manson's shark tank. Yes. What I'm proposing

01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:46.880
is this one, I guess. I like that. Let me see. I've been sitting back there nervously.

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:50.360
I love this show and I've never hated a show more than this one. How do I follow those

01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:57.760
guys? Oh, well, not by insulting the show traditionally, but the way the show is beautiful. You're

01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:03.640
beautiful. I love you for how you show us all your soul and we see how wonderful a person

01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:09.800
you are. I love him for his logic. I love your I love you for keeping shit going. Fuck yeah.

01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:13.600
And everybody that knows me, everybody at home that knows me is now saying fuck, he's

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:18.280
doing the seven to one rule on. Sorry, guys. What is the seven to one rule? Oh, oh, shit.

01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:24.200
It's not even on subject. Jesus Christ. All right. Seven to one rule is basically as a

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:29.480
management thing where you're supposed to give people seven compliments to one negative.

01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:35.840
Okay. Here comes the one. I'm saving that for I threw that in early. He let off with

01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:39.560
the one. Yeah. Yeah. He's making. All right. So it's what people up here. You can add me

01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:44.360
to the seven. You got like a whole seven. I was hoping I was hoping for a no guess night.

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:54.360
I really was. I bet. Wow. I was not. I was not uncomfortable until just now. He's already

01:27:54.360 --> 01:28:00.080
I was like, thank God I'm still here. The paramedics leave. I'm like, oh, Dan still

01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:04.960
wants me on stage. Like, no, the paramedics are the lucky ones. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm sitting

01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:07.960
over there and I'm just going, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,

01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:13.160
my dream is dying. Oh my God. They're EMTs, by the way. Do you want me to go? No, I will

01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:16.400
go. I love you. I love your show. Okay. But he's right. Nobody cares about you on the

01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:21.160
show, but I love your show. That's that's just a carryover from him. That's okay. I still

01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:29.600
have my slab wife. Yes. Yes. You call her that, not me. You call her slab lady. No,

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:33.960
I don't. You call her slab lady. I said that. He said he heard it. People. That's like,

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:38.960
you learn that from Trump. There's like, people call her slab lady. That's the same. Why would

01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:43.720
they call her that? She didn't like laying on slabs all the time. You're right. Yeah.

01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:47.960
You I distracted. You're right. There should not have been a guy. No, no, no, no, no. You

01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:54.040
are watching my dream. My dream is doing this as you go. No, no, no, no. My dream is

01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:58.960
dying hours traveling here. It sounds and my bus broke down on the way to the airport.

01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:03.680
The number of times you probably went through this show on the journey, right over and over

01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:08.040
and none of them on the plane going like that. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. People are

01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:12.320
going to say this and not one of them had this guy in your dream. Oh yeah. He announces

01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:16.840
you and I love you. Sean. I'm like, fuck, fuck that guy. And he said, you said the story

01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:20.760
about 20 minutes ago and I'm thinking, oh my God, great. And then he brings paramedics

01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:28.760
out and I'm like, I can't compete with paramedics. EMT. Sorry. Sorry. Yeah. Let's get into it.

01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:33.360
You want to get into it? Well, yes. All right. All right. What, what, how did this come about

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:40.600
then? What qualified John here? Oh, so in case anyone else is also interested in this kind

01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:45.640
of thing, you could just tweeted us. No, don't say that. Don't say that. This is what happened.

01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:52.600
So he tweeted at us and now he's here. Right. I don't know. He tweeted and I would say the

01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:57.480
adverb, hopefully it's not an offensive adverb incessantly. You tweeted incessantly.

01:29:57.480 --> 01:30:06.400
Here, here, here. I'll just hold you. Oh, yeah. Put it in front of him. He's not necessary.

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:10.560
Careful with that. He's like a, he's like a dead body in the back of one of his scenes

01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:17.560
right there. Needlessly hostile. I'm on the edge of my fucking seat right now. I have

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:24.560
no idea. I have no idea what on earth is happening. All right. He's a crazy person. He's going

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:35.680
to kill all of us. All right. Oh, no. Fuck your dreams. I fuck your dreams. Where's my

01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:42.560
list of things I need from Dan at the end. I think that's a mind map. Sorry. All right.

01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:48.560
I'm sorry. Okay. The first thing everybody has to remember, human party on Facebook,

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:53.920
human party on Facebook. I'm starting a new political party. Okay. So third, a political

01:30:53.920 --> 01:31:01.100
third party. Yes, go ahead. Central to your, that's central to your platform is it needs

01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:06.480
to be a third party. Yes. Okay. Continue. That's all right. These are the things we're

01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:11.000
going to go do. Oh my God. I've been sitting over there and now it's all gone, Dan. Oh,

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:18.240
well, okay. Well, all right. What I need here is my goal, Dan is I'm, these are the things

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:21.960
we're going to do. These are the, the platform I've given him because he and I are discussing

01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:28.800
it seriously. But here's the key for you is we live in a culture of personality. We have

01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:33.600
for a long time, even before Trump, my friends have been sick of hearing about it for 20 years,

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:39.440
20 years. I've been a socialist Democrat. I believe these things. I am really doing

01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:48.440
this because you know, my son is 17 and I would say he's ashamed of me. He's known my

01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:56.480
entire life that I've wanted to fix this country. Yes. I love that guy. That's start

01:31:56.480 --> 01:32:01.000
it won't happen. It won't happen. No, no, 10 years out here. I don't know what that's

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:05.240
accomplishing, by the way. So yeah, I don't want to bore you guys. And I'm sorry, Dan.

01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:10.240
Dan just was kind of questioning whether this was serious because I sounded like a dork.

01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:13.840
You know, he's like, what's this going to be? It is serious. Here's what I need you for,

01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:21.040
Dan is I am going to tell stars. I'm going to start Twitter Wars with stars. You were

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:27.200
my first domino. Twitter my concept. Wait, Twitter Wars. Yeah. Okay. Well, let's let's

01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:33.160
explore that. Okay. What do these Twitter Wars do? Okay, what? So we live in a world

01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:39.600
of Twitter. Yeah, yeah. Okay, Trump proved it. Sure. I think stars are part of the problem.

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:44.040
The ultra liberal stars think that something's being accomplished by them getting likes on

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:48.560
their tweets are by them throwing a dinner for someone. And I've got a list of 20 stars.

01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:54.520
I think I handed it to you that that it's okay. It's okay. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:58.040
I know I'm sorry guys. I'm sorry. Again, this might pay off with throw up everywhere.

01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:06.440
Oh, it'll pay off. No, don't do it. Don't. Oh, it's too early. Oh, no. All right. Number

01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:14.280
one, voting holiday election reform. But number two, no, go back to the Twitter Wars. So one

01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:18.600
of the problems you're solving up here is your son being embarrassed or hating you. What

01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:22.760
was that? No, no. Okay, you ready? Well, no, I also, we're fixing that tonight. I want

01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:28.280
socialist Democrats. I want to fix the world. My son has just heard about this for his entire

01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:33.120
life. You know, when it's like I said, I had to get a normal job. I work a union job. I

01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:40.280
work check to check just to get everybody to know what I gave you the pen, right? Oh

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:49.040
my God. All right. Hey, if they gave awards for Comptroller's, you would get. So I need.

01:33:49.040 --> 01:34:00.640
All right. So what are the Twitter Wars? Okay, Spencer, they're supposed to energize

01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:07.160
these celebrities by sharing it. Here it is. Shame and hope. Yes, here it is. And it's

01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:17.760
two great tastes that go great together through shame and hope. Absolutely. I love you. You

01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:31.360
got hope in my name. You got shame in my hope. You're getting to you're getting. I need him

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:35.360
for my music. No, no, you're you're building an implement. It's like, oh, no, you can't

01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:43.320
do it. Number one. So all right, we really got to get through. Yeah, we don't have to

01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:48.360
get through the list. The most important thing is the first thing, everybody. Colt was elected.

01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:51.840
Well, Colt the personality I need your help with. Maybe we can talk so I don't bore. Trump's

01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:57.160
more popular than Dan. No, no, it's fine. What is the problem is, is these stars need

01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:01.320
either put up or shut the fuck up. I'm going to go with these people. Bill Maher is our

01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:15.000
next shot. No, no. No, no, no. We just need number one. Just number one. Okay, so the

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:20.720
key is everybody remember, you're going to hear it all the time. Only 26% of the people

01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:27.880
elected Trump, 26% or 47% of the motherfuckers all stayed home and just don't care. But then

01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:31.800
they bitch every day. Sure. I'm afraid to ask for, you know, an audience participation

01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:38.680
of who didn't. I'll be participation. All right. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.

01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:42.280
What we're going to do first thing, I'm going to get all these stars to run on this. All

01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:46.000
right, we got to get through this. No, we don't have to get through. No, we need to.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.840
No, we need us to get through this. No, we can't. They will know they don't know we're

01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:55.960
making it happen until you stop making it happen. We got to keep it going. I fucking

01:35:55.960 --> 01:36:01.560
love you. Just keep it going. I love you. I just need you to say more words on the subject.

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:10.920
All right, here we go. Number one. Oh, you want. Okay, I feel like I all right. We can't

01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:14.640
jump around. All right. All right, America works. It's going to solve all the problems.

01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:18.560
We're going to get free college and pick stakes, but you can't go there. Okay, at this point,

01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:23.080
I think we have some ideas. Your platforms, your third party, you're coming, you're going

01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:28.520
to fix everything. And then everyone will love it. Love it. Right. So there's this,

01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:34.160
you know, this South Park sketch, these underpants gnomes, they're like step one, collect underpants,

01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:40.760
step two, step three profit. That's the problem I'm having here. The step two involves create

01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:47.480
a third party, infiltrate the two party system, which, which by the way, the two parties control

01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:52.520
the electoral system and the voting system. So if you wanted to make voter change, you'd

01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:57.420
actually have to, you'd have to join the parties because those are the people who vote on the

01:36:57.420 --> 01:37:02.600
voting laws. So you literally could not affect voting reform. If you were a third party,

01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:06.320
you'd have to join the Republicans and the Democrats and get both of those parties to

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:10.960
change their voting. And you'd need to do that before you can have a viable third party

01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:16.560
in the first place. So I feel like even all your policies are what I'd consider standard

01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:20.320
social policies that are very helpful and very good, but they're good. Yeah, but they're

01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:25.800
not going, I agree, but you can't, but without this first step, you can't enact any of that.

01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:30.880
And that's, that's like asking like, that's like saying, okay, I got this plan, delivery

01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:35.440
stuff, all I have to do is fly and then I could deliver all these packages. It'll be

01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:40.960
easy, but that's really hard in that, in, in our Twitter interaction. And today there's

01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:45.840
been not, it's been completely glossed over in a way that I think we have to, you know,

01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:49.640
come to terms with before we can really go forward because I think we can all agree that

01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:51.440
it's important to make the world better.

01:37:51.440 --> 01:38:02.520
Okay. I got my hand up and you're 100% right. Yes. No, I am. Except, except it can be done

01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:07.960
through the Senate if I can get four to six seats. And if some of those seats are famous

01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:13.800
people, 46 Congress, no, four to six, right? Four to six, four to six. So let's say six

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:21.520
seats. 126 seats. You're on the ball. That was better than you guys reacted to. Good

01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:28.600
joke, Jeff. Okay. This is what I'm counting on is if I can get some people involved that

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:33.440
can make some noise that will be listened to sadly, just because they're stars, we will

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:37.800
be able to disrupt the Senate because the Senate's the key. What Bernie did wrong and

01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:42.240
I love Bernie and I hate Bernie. He took my plan and ruined it. You can't do it. You're

01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:46.560
right. You're right about, you can't do it on a presidential basis, but the Senate is

01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:51.960
a place because of the way the Senate works. Four to six seats could stop everything till

01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:56.280
we get that. So how many votes does it take to get one seat? Like how many people would

01:38:56.280 --> 01:39:01.160
it take to vote a Senate seat? Now, this is the great part. It has to happen on 2018.

01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:05.640
I think you got this whole room. First of all, these people were all, I don't think so.

01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:09.600
I think they just want me to shut the fuck up. Oh, you got that? You got that from him?

01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:14.760
Yeah. I think, but it's not going to happen till he says so because thank you, Dan. Thank

01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:18.000
you. Well, I'm not, I'm not going to say, it's not evening at the Apollo. I'm not going

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.280
to have like somebody sweep you off the stage. I'm not going to go through this whole thing.

01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:25.280
This has been a long show. And if crazy people weren't allowed on this stage, where would

01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:31.400
we stop? Right? Right? Like where would we stop enforcing that rule? Right? I like people

01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:35.240
thinking like, like, I gotta be thinking about this stuff. Well, Dan, exactly. I'd rather

01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:39.480
have these conversations and not happen. So, so anyways, why am I getting, why am I just

01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:42.840
identifying myself to you? Keep telling us your political plan. Okay, well, let's concentrate

01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:46.560
on the important part. Yes, it's very important because this is what we've been fighting

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:51.400
about him and I, you're one of the people, Dan, that I can't say to you because I love

01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:54.920
you too much, but you're at, we're at the point, you hate what's going on as much as

01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:59.360
me, where it's time for people in your position to put up or shut up to either get the fuck

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:05.600
out of it or get into it. And all I'm going to be telling people on my list is work part

01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:10.080
time for a couple of years. You can still tour, you can still do shit, and you can still

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:15.800
be a senator. You can do it and they will listen to them. You want me to be a senator?

01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:21.640
No, no, no, no. He wants, okay. No. He wants Natalie Portman to be a senator. No, no, no.

01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:25.040
Dan? He wants Natalie Portman to be a senator or something. Something like that. Oh, and

01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:29.640
he's using me to get to Natalie Portman. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wait, wait, you're, I don't think

01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:31.640
you can get me to Natalie Portman. Didn't you see the bubble chart on the last page?

01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:35.840
No, you're using me to get to Will Wheaton and Will Wheaton. Oh, wait, here we go. Hold

01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:40.640
on. Ready? I, I, for one, this is how, hey, Dan, I don't know. I'm hoping for better.

01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:46.480
I'm using you for Ackerman, Proups, Paul F. Thompson. You're going to use, you're going

01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:55.480
to, you're going to build from me to Ackerman? Get the fuck out of here. You just said you're

01:40:55.480 --> 01:41:02.480
not going to kick people off. I'm not getting drawn into this. But that almost did it. You're

01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:07.040
going to Ackerman. No. Senator Ackerman, you have the floor. No. No, sorry. Ackerman's

01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:11.760
on tour right now. He committed 20%. Would Senator Natalie Portman please keep it down

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:16.960
for a moment? Thank you. Now, Dan, I, I just, I, I have dreams. You could get me to Clooney,

01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:21.760
but I just didn't want to jump too far. Okay. Right. I, but, okay. So, but I, I've been in

01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:25.520
this situation before where people, yeah, yeah. Well, so you're, I mean, you know, you know

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:29.200
that. I know that. And I'm not saying through, I'm not saying through a holiday party, invite

01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:32.720
me so I can board it. I don't think he knows. You should explain that because maybe he doesn't

01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:35.040
understand. Well, of course it's insulting. Like it's a very, you know, like, like, look,

01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:40.640
I'd be the, well, it would be very hypocritical of me to decry narcissism. But you clearly,

01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:44.880
that's the way the world works. You have this agenda. You don't care about, you know, like,

01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:50.720
like, like, you, I, like, I have this pulpit. You have an opportunity to connect with these

01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:57.680
people. I've given you their time. And you're, you're, like, all we've heard so far is, is

01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:02.000
that you're hoping to get as many famous people as possible to build up to something.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.240
Yeah. I'm just saying this aboard them, but you're also like, it seems a little bit like

01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:09.520
you've learned, you've learned what to do by watching Trump.

01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:13.160
Oh my God. I had this, and this drives me crazy. I've been telling my friends and they

01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:17.080
all know because they've listened to this for so many years. And I was so worried. I

01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:20.280
said, you know what everybody's going to say, baby, is they're all going to say, I'm reacting

01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:23.840
to Trump. Right. No, I had the, I decided to run. No, I think it's good to react to

01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:27.840
Trump, but I don't think he's overreacting to Trump. I just don't think you should emulate

01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:32.440
him necessarily. And it's, I wish it wasn't the case, but our society is a cult of personality

01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:36.480
and you know it as well as anybody. Cause maybe that's the problem. Maybe it's a problem

01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:39.880
in it, but it's going to get used one more time. Okay. Here's my analogy. I tell my friends

01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:43.800
the cult of personality is a loaded gun in the middle of the table. Sure. The Democrats

01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:47.480
are on one side or Republicans are on the other side. They are going to use that loaded

01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:54.160
gun in 2018. Remind me why it has to be 2018. Because we got to flip the Senate. We got

01:42:54.160 --> 01:43:00.600
to flip the Senate. Okay. Wait. Okay. Hold on. Yep. Here's now. I think what you happen

01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:05.760
is this is a big conversation because we are in this post fact world and it's like Democrats

01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:09.600
have to decide, are we going to be post truth or are we going to be truth truth? And so

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:14.360
I think what you're talking about is valuable, but I would say that my trepidation is that

01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:19.920
Republicans and the GOP are bathed in lies and they're bathed in dishonesty and that's

01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:24.080
their wheelhouse. So the idea that we're going to be able to fight on that level strikes

01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:28.560
me as kind of, I don't know. It's just cause we're noobs and they're like, you know, they're

01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:34.160
the mob kind of, it just seems like a heart. It's unfair. We have the truth on our side.

01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:37.960
So like we could bring that to bear, but like, I don't know that playing their tricks is

01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:42.040
like, and that's a question I've had with myself because it might be that that's the

01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:46.320
answer, but I feel like it seems hard. We've lost this horror. We've fought them if we

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:50.160
looked at their tactics and felt like, you know what they did that made them win? They

01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:56.840
got on Twitter and they tweeted racist memes that weren't a, like, but that, and in my

01:43:56.840 --> 01:44:00.040
personal opinion, that's the problem with the bipartisan system is that the Democrats

01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:03.440
have already become that. They always, every four years, they always go, oh, you know what

01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:08.200
the Republicans did? Anyways, but like, you're wearing a kilt.

01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:12.960
I say, we just, I said, we wrap, I said, you guys, this was a strategic decision. We wrap

01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:16.120
it out. I think we have to wrap this shit up. Oh, damn it. You got a fucking wrap.

01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:20.680
Well, it's, well, yeah, let's let, well, what, so you drove from Washington or you flew

01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:25.040
from Washington? Yeah. Okay. So what was the, what did the plane ticket cost? Maybe we

01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:31.840
no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, it was too much for me, but no, no. What I want, what

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:35.320
I need from this is I've gotten, I've gotten exposure. If people would just go to the human

01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:39.720
party on Facebook, there's more about it. The human party on Facebook. Yeah. I, I, so

01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:43.680
it's, it's, it's a real thing. And I guess, aren't you, aren't you John worried though

01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:49.880
about Natalie Portman's very notable stance on the state of Israel? She loves it. You

01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:57.520
know, like, and her, and her, her hawkish foreign policy. Yeah, but she's a stepping

01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:09.320
stone to Amy Adams. Yeah. Fuck, fuck humanity. It's all just a fucking carnival. The thing

01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:12.600
that has touched me most, Dan, is that I've known you for many years, and I didn't know

01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:19.120
you could get me to Ockerman. Oh, no, you, I mean, not in one step, not in one step.

01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:23.560
I'm sure not in one step. No, he's got to go through one of the engineers or something.

01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:31.240
He's got to go to the Skala brothers. Yeah. Okay. The reason all this is this way is

01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:36.520
because these people, your audience, they love to support crowdfunding. The only way

01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:40.320
I can do this is through crowdfunding. Right. I've seen dreams happen on your show through

01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:46.280
crowdfunding and I will never compete with money. I can only do this if my crowdfund

01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:49.600
hits. Otherwise I have to go back to my normal job. What do you call it? What's, what, what

01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:53.000
are we going to? What's the site? It's not ready yet that because they say to be ready

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.880
first. Okay, now here's your problem. No, they say to be ready first and they're going

01:45:55.880 --> 01:46:00.120
to go to the human party. And then I'm going to have the date set. Right. And then, and

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:03.360
that's so that I'm driving to the human party, setting the date. They say you need to have

01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:07.280
your money lined up before you start your crowdfunding. So you're not supposed to start

01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:12.680
too early. Okay. Damn it. I love you so much. I'm on your side. All right. We're all on

01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:20.360
your side. So, so the thing is, I'm actually not on your side. I'm like the devil that

01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:31.120
showed up to destroy your dreams. And I am, I'm going to keep talking because that's horrible.

01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:36.560
But I do think that you don't like something that's called the cult of personality. It's

01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:40.680
a fact of life. Right. You don't like it, but you're using it. Like what it's the loaded

01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:45.280
gun and they're going to use it if we don't, but that is what we're looking for worse than

01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:50.280
to 2018. They're going to, what we're looking for as a humankind is an answer to problems,

01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:55.040
not using the problems. That five list, that's the, that's the answer is that five list.

01:46:55.040 --> 01:47:02.240
Yeah, but this Twitter war of yours. Believe me, I also have sort of called telephone terrorism.

01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:11.560
I read every item on this. I feel like you're using poison. I am for health. I am. And I

01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:17.120
don't, okay. Okay. I'm going to, I'll riff a, I'll riff a pitch. Like putting my money

01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:22.560
where my mouth is. What if we were able to use the, the, the, the current bipartisan system,

01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:29.800
we were able to start locally, create, you know, like, like, like, like do like a community

01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:36.760
stuff, call ourselves Democrats, but like, like, have a little asterisk on it, you know,

01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:40.600
like, like, like, like, like we're, we're blue shield Democrats or leftists. We're, we're

01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:45.080
long cabin Democrats, you know, we're, we're, we're people that actually care about like,

01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:49.760
like, you know, blah, blah, blah. And we, we, we give interest free loans to, to, to

01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:50.760
people.

01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:54.480
We should call it like something that everyone can access, like the human party.

01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:59.680
All right. Well, anyways, I'm not going to, I'll pitch that next episode, but, but it's

01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:00.680
good.

01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:03.080
I thought he was just going to get, it was going to be a guy in a kilt that gave us drugs.

01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:04.400
I didn't know it was going to fucking go.

01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:05.400
Well, okay.

01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:06.400
Yeah.

01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:07.400
He was going to give us the keys to Ockerman.

01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:08.400
Ockerman.

01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:09.400
What about proofs?

01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:10.400
I don't even know.

01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:14.880
It doesn't even look like I'm directly like I get you to Ockerman. Oh, contact. Okay.

01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:15.880
As goes Ockerman.

01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:16.880
So does Ockerman.

01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:20.880
No, okay. See, and I'm starting small because I have very little confidence in myself. I

01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:22.480
don't think I can get Clooney yet.

01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:26.480
Right. No, I know I'm very, very insulted by all of this. Yes.

01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:29.280
Oh, no, I've got, I get it.

01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:31.880
Well, who should I have mentioned? Because that's my problem.

01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:32.880
No, you should.

01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:38.800
No, Dan get, Dan has to be behind the scenes. Dan has to be the man. He's the heart. Dan,

01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:40.160
you don't want to run, right?

01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:41.160
No, I don't, I, I,

01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:42.160
No, he doesn't.

01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:49.680
But right now I want to run. Yeah. I want to hide. I want to, I want to duck. I want

01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:50.680
to cover.

01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:51.680
Oh my God.

01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:59.200
But it's, it's 10 o'clock, but I do like, I don't want you to be mocked and ridiculed

01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:04.440
and deflated. I think that, I think that, I think that I'm fucking crazy right now.

01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:07.080
Like, like, I feel like there's Nazis taking over the,

01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:08.080
Yeah.

01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:09.080
So let's do something about it.

01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:14.320
I'm, I'm alarmed about it. I don't, I don't, I don't, I, the, the stuff that I'm seeing

01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:17.960
written on your giant pads, I, everything I've seen, I don't see.

01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:18.960
This is the key.

01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:19.960
I don't see anything that I disagree with.

01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:20.960
This will change everything.

01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:24.800
We definitely need to, uh, uh, election reform. We definitely need to.

01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:25.800
This will change it all.

01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:29.080
But, but I also agree with Spencer that, like, we have to think strategically about how.

01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:32.080
Even four to six Senate seats is a huge accomplishment.

01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:36.200
And it will stop everything. If there are people that get, listen, if they are listened

01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:41.280
to, if there are people that are listened to stars, sadly, it will happen. People will

01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:46.600
watch C-SPAN to see what happens when we, when we're on the floor, they will stop to

01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:50.440
watch. If they see that, oh my God, you got a guy from Westworld. You could ask him.

01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:51.440
Right.

01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:52.440
Do you want to run?

01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:53.440
No.

01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:54.440
Thank you.

01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:55.440
Okay.

01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:58.640
Within three years, if you start with a friendship with him, Anthony Hopkins.

01:49:58.640 --> 01:49:59.640
Oh.

01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:03.680
You, you could quickly be in a war with Anthony Hopkins.

01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:06.680
Imagine that.

01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:08.680
Let's hear from John Roswell, everybody.

01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:09.680
John Roswell.

01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:10.680
Go to human party.

01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:11.680
Human party.

01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:12.680
Human party on Facebook.

01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:13.680
Human party on Facebook.

01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:14.680
Thank you, John.

01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:15.680
Thank you, John.

01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:28.200
And you know who got bumped, Miranda Harmon, who was here.

01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:32.120
Uh, remember her from many, many episodes ago?

01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:33.120
You got bumped.

01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:34.120
Yeah.

01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:35.120
There you are.

01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:36.120
Yeah.

01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:37.120
How are you?

01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:38.120
Uh, yeah.

01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:39.120
Jane texted that you were here.

01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:40.120
Uh, remember Miranda Harmon?

01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:41.120
No relation.

01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:45.120
She, uh, she made this amazing, where can people see that comic that you made about coming

01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:46.120
to Harmon?

01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:47.120
Come go to the mic real quick, Miranda.

01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:48.120
Come up on stage for us.

01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:49.120
Miranda, everybody.

01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:50.120
Harmontown Success Story.

01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:51.120
Hey.

01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:52.120
Hey.

01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:53.120
Hey, guys.

01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:54.120
Um, ooh.

01:50:54.120 --> 01:51:02.120
So my website is mirandaharmon.com and Harmontown, the comic is on there.

01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:05.120
And I have, I have copies of the zines for you guys.

01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:06.120
Oh, that's great.

01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:09.120
And when we met, you know, you were an aspiring artist, right?

01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:10.120
Yeah.

01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:11.120
You wanted to talk to us.

01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:12.120
And guess, guess what?

01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:13.120
What?

01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:14.120
I'm a cartoonist now.

01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:15.120
Yay.

01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:20.120
One dream at a time.

01:51:20.120 --> 01:51:25.120
Uh, but, and, and, you know, our show didn't make that possible.

01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:27.120
Your, your, your talent did, right?

01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:28.120
It helps.

01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:29.120
Yay.

01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:34.120
Well, that, that comic, um, it turns out a lot of people listen to Harmontown.

01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:35.120
I didn't, I didn't know that.

01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:37.120
Tell, tell that to John Rossfeld.

01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:42.120
Who thinks that, who thinks that only, you know, if enough, yeah, whatever.

01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:46.120
That's, you know, I, you know, I got, I got Natalie Portman on speed dial.

01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:49.120
That's, that's the jokes on him.

01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:50.120
Yeah.

01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:54.120
You know, I, I, I can get you Kevin Bacon.

01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:55.120
Yeah.

01:51:55.120 --> 01:51:59.120
I remember when the fappening happened, I had to change my iCloud password because,

01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:02.120
because of, of, of Cameron Diaz.

01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:04.120
That's a true story.

01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:08.120
One degree of separation.

01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:13.120
I appeared on Harmontown with Steve Agee, who appeared alongside Kevin Bacon and Super,

01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:14.120
I think.

01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:15.120
Anyways.

01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:16.120
Wow.

01:52:16.120 --> 01:52:17.120
That's fast.

01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:18.120
So, so what, are you living in LA now?

01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:19.120
Where are you?

01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:22.120
No, I still live in Florida, but I'm moving here like within the month.

01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:23.120
All right.

01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:25.120
What's your, what's your cartoon?

01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:26.120
What?

01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:29.120
What is your cartoon that you are cartoonist?

01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:30.120
Oh, no, no, no.

01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:32.120
I'm, I'm just, I'm a, I'm a comic artist.

01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:33.120
Like I make comics for myself.

01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:34.120
Oh, awesome.

01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:35.120
Okay.

01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:36.120
Yeah.

01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:37.120
Yeah.

01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:38.120
No, I mean, yeah.

01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:39.120
You working for other people or have you?

01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:40.120
Not yet.

01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:41.120
Okay.

01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:42.120
Yeah.

01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:43.120
Great.

01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:44.120
You're, you're, you're, you're, you're cocoon has been breached.

01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:45.120
Yeah.

01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:46.120
Yeah.

01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:48.120
I'm actually here because I am like taping at a, at a comics convention.

01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:49.120
That's why.

01:52:49.120 --> 01:52:50.120
Nice.

01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:51.120
Yeah.

01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:52.120
Sign in, sign in some stuff.

01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:53.120
Get your portfolio out there.

01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:55.120
Can you plug something for us so we can find it?

01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:57.120
Like, can you say it out to the fans?

01:52:57.120 --> 01:52:58.120
Yeah.

01:52:58.120 --> 01:52:59.120
Just like Miranda Harmon.com.

01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:00.120
That's me.

01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:01.120
Yeah.

01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:05.120
I've seen, I've seen a little on Instagram today at the, or maybe Facebook that Jane

01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:09.120
may have posted of one of your little Harmontown comics is very, very cute.

01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:11.120
Jane has been very sweet about it.

01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:12.120
Yeah.

01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:13.120
Jane's a sweetie.

01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:18.120
Jane's the official, like, like she's like, like coordinating all of the fandom on Facebook.

01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:19.120
Yeah.

01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:25.120
There was a guy that was like, it was like, like, you know, having suicidal ideology.

01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:27.120
And then like, he was off the grid.

01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:32.120
And then like, like Jane, like, I'm hearing this all third hand because I can't get, I

01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:34.120
can't get involved.

01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:37.120
I'm too busy running for Senate.

01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:41.120
But, but, but, but, but yeah, Jane just props to Jane.

01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:45.120
I mean, change, like, change is like out there, like coordinating and I don't know.

01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:50.120
Just like there's a little family that's like ancillarily related to Harmontown that doesn't

01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:53.120
even have to have to do with whether I'm a good or a bad person.

01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:58.120
You know, it's like, it's like, oh, we all like Cheetos and we're good people.

01:53:58.120 --> 01:54:03.120
Like Cheetos doesn't have to be good for you.

01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:04.120
I like that.

01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:08.120
You know, it doesn't have to be a, I don't, I don't, I don't have to, if I, if I, if I

01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:12.120
joined that Facebook group, for instance, within two weeks, it would like be decimated

01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:18.120
because I'd be like jerk off and I'd still mad at, still mad about season four.

01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:21.120
And everybody'd be like, I don't like this.

01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:22.120
It feels toxic.

01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:27.120
And like, yeah, I like that there could be a little, that the May poll doesn't have to be me.

01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:28.120
Yeah.

01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:35.120
I mean, I, when I respond to that, I just, I made that comic like a year ago and I didn't

01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:36.120
really know about that.

01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:40.120
And Jane, like, immediately like reached out to me and she was like super sweet and she

01:54:40.120 --> 01:54:43.120
wrote me this very nice message I still like think about.

01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:46.120
She's very, um, and she got me like into that.

01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:47.120
Like I didn't, I didn't know.

01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:48.120
I didn't know.

01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:50.120
Cause when I, when I was like, when Harvard town was like my lifeline, like years ago,

01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:53.120
like I, it really felt like there were only like a few of us listening.

01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:56.120
I didn't realize there were so many people who listened to the show.

01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:58.120
Weren't you kind of down when we met you?

01:54:58.120 --> 01:54:59.120
I mean, this is like, yeah.

01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:00.120
I was like, super.

01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:04.120
I was like, we asked the, the sentiment out there, going through any pain and you, you

01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:06.120
laid some heavy stuff on us.

01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:07.120
Yeah.

01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:08.120
You didn't disappoint.

01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:09.120
You were right.

01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:12.120
I mean, I, yeah, I was super depressed.

01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:14.120
And I, I, I mean, which was neat.

01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:15.120
We loved it.

01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:19.120
But that's a very, that's like a paramedic thing for emotion.

01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:23.120
It's like, oh, look how horrible she's an emotional EMT.

01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:25.120
I have like this share picture.

01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:29.120
But yeah, but I'm just saying like that's, it's, it's wonderful to see you.

01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:33.120
I don't, but I don't, I also don't want to worship at the altar of like too many people

01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:34.120
in our audience.

01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:36.120
Like that's, that's the story we hear over and over again.

01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:42.120
It's like that, that thing of like smiling and being happy and, and clean and bright

01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:44.120
and shiny doesn't make you a good person.

01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:47.120
It doesn't mean that your life is on the right track, but it's also at the same time.

01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:51.120
It's nice to see somebody like that was down in the roller coaster.

01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:52.120
Be, be up on it.

01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:53.120
I don't know.

01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:54.120
I'm drunk in the shows over.

01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:55.120
Okay.

01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:56.120
But, but yeah.
