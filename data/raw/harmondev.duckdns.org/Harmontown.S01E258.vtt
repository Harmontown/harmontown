{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:16.200\nWelcome once again, one and all, Mademoiselle and the other guys, from Uptown, Uptown Burbank,\n\n00:16.200 --> 00:28.400\nthe beautiful part of Uptown Burbank, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:28.400 --> 00:41.600\nWould you please join me in welcoming the Game Master of your dreams, Spencer Crittenden.\n\n00:41.600 --> 00:49.640\nAnd the fuzziest mayor of all time, you love him, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:49.640 --> 00:50.640\nThank you.\n\n00:50.640 --> 00:51.640\nThank you very much.\n\n00:51.640 --> 01:03.880\nLet's bring this town hall meeting to order, that's the conceit of the show.\n\n01:03.880 --> 01:08.960\nFirst order of business, when will we get to the moon?\n\n01:08.960 --> 01:12.640\nRemember that premise that never came to fruition?\n\n01:12.640 --> 01:17.520\nWell, you mean we didn't build a rocket ship, is that what's...\n\n01:17.520 --> 01:22.120\nI don't know, I feel like now isn't that more important than ever to get the hell off of\n\n01:22.120 --> 01:26.840\nthis horrible planet that wants to kill us?\n\n01:26.840 --> 01:34.320\nYeah, yeah, but in order to do it we'd have to work with hundreds of people that I now\n\n01:34.320 --> 01:42.160\ndon't like, like I think we missed our deadline, it's like the Tower of Babel, like humanity's\n\n01:42.160 --> 01:43.160\nbeen disbanded.\n\n01:43.160 --> 01:49.400\nI just, I'm a lone wolf now.\n\n01:49.400 --> 01:59.520\nI'm like that wolf that Tom Cruise saw in that movie, lone wolf.\n\n01:59.520 --> 02:02.800\nThe movie was not called, what was your guess, the lone wolf?\n\n02:02.800 --> 02:03.800\nNo, no.\n\n02:03.800 --> 02:04.800\nThat would be great.\n\n02:04.800 --> 02:05.800\nWas it called Wolf?\n\n02:05.800 --> 02:06.800\nNo.\n\n02:06.800 --> 02:09.000\nWolf of Wall Street.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:10.000\nNope.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:16.760\nThese are all famous movies that are famous for not starring Tom Cruise, except for Spencer's\n\n02:16.760 --> 02:19.920\nguess which is a non-existent movie.\n\n02:19.920 --> 02:23.880\nThat would be the movie you'd expect him to see a lone wolf in when he's a lone wolf.\n\n02:23.880 --> 02:24.880\nWould it though?\n\n02:24.880 --> 02:25.880\nWas it?\n\n02:25.880 --> 02:26.880\nWas it?\n\n02:26.880 --> 02:30.320\nThat happens and then it's like lone wolf and then the credits roll.\n\n02:30.320 --> 02:32.840\nIt's like a three minute movie.\n\n02:32.840 --> 02:34.960\nI know what it is, I know what it is.\n\n02:34.960 --> 02:37.880\nIt was Wolfie McGuire.\n\n02:37.880 --> 02:46.880\nWhy wouldn't the breakfast club be about a sandwich with egg on it?\n\n02:46.880 --> 02:52.880\nWhy wouldn't the title be a guy falls through a ceiling while trying to go get his weed\n\n02:52.880 --> 02:53.880\nfrom his locker?\n\n02:53.880 --> 02:57.000\nThat would be a terrible title for breakfast club, but.\n\n02:57.000 --> 02:59.800\nA great title for weed locker.\n\n02:59.800 --> 03:01.800\nWeed locker is, yeah.\n\n03:01.800 --> 03:06.440\nBut that was about the Iraq war, I think.\n\n03:06.440 --> 03:15.440\nThat's Doug Benson's indie comedy movie, that's where he shoots it in the Angelus Desert.\n\n03:15.440 --> 03:18.040\nIs there an Angelus Desert?\n\n03:18.040 --> 03:19.040\nThere's a forest.\n\n03:19.040 --> 03:21.200\nOkay, but next to it is there any sand?\n\n03:21.200 --> 03:23.800\nYeah, you go inland a couple miles.\n\n03:23.800 --> 03:26.000\nOkay, and the trees run out and there's no ocean.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:27.840\nYeah, now you're in Angelus Desert.\n\n03:27.840 --> 03:30.440\nNow you're talking Angelus Desert.\n\n03:30.440 --> 03:34.440\nOr you just hit like, I don't know, Nevada.\n\n03:34.440 --> 03:40.400\nMaybe I should have said Nevada, but it's like a $1 million comedy, you know, like they\n\n03:40.400 --> 03:43.560\ngot some investors, but it's like they're pretending that it's about Doug Benson being\n\n03:43.560 --> 03:45.560\nan Iraq and it's called the weed locker.\n\n03:45.560 --> 03:56.280\nI just wanted to finish my pitch, although I agree with you, the movie sells itself.\n\n03:56.280 --> 03:58.040\nWhat is a Tom Cruise movie you're talking about?\n\n03:58.040 --> 04:02.840\nOh, you'd see him, he's a gray-haired hitman in the back of a Wayne's Brothers, no.\n\n04:02.840 --> 04:05.200\nWho's a what?\n\n04:05.200 --> 04:06.200\nRacist.\n\n04:06.200 --> 04:07.200\nRacist.\n\n04:07.200 --> 04:08.200\nWait, who was it?\n\n04:08.200 --> 04:09.200\nWho's Jamie Foxx?\n\n04:09.200 --> 04:10.200\nJamie Foxx?\n\n04:10.200 --> 04:11.200\nCaladero.\n\n04:11.200 --> 04:12.200\nWait, what?\n\n04:12.200 --> 04:13.200\nJamie Caladero.\n\n04:13.200 --> 04:14.200\nJamie Caladero.\n\n04:14.200 --> 04:15.200\nOh, I thought you were telling me his name.\n\n04:15.200 --> 04:16.200\nI'm like, I'm not that often.\n\n04:16.200 --> 04:20.320\nThat person's name I do not know.\n\n04:20.320 --> 04:23.240\nThat person sounds like he won an Oscar.\n\n04:23.240 --> 04:25.320\nHwadarwa.\n\n04:25.320 --> 04:27.320\nAnd the winner is Hwadara.\n\n04:27.320 --> 04:37.560\nHwadara is winning his first Oscar and will soon be a cab driver.\n\n04:37.560 --> 04:39.880\nWe'll take it up with white society, you pricks.\n\n04:39.880 --> 04:45.720\nSomeone's looking at me, I'm not the fucking one that's the cause of this.\n\n04:45.720 --> 04:47.680\nThat poor guy in the, what's that movie called?\n\n04:47.680 --> 04:52.000\nCaptain, my captain, I'm the captain now.\n\n04:52.000 --> 05:01.480\nPoe society, that's the only old captain, my captain, Poe society called, I'm the captain\n\n05:01.480 --> 05:07.600\nnow, captain, desk standards, with an exclamation point.\n\n05:07.600 --> 05:09.840\nI found my, look what I found.\n\n05:09.840 --> 05:15.240\nOh, a lot of you, a lot of you plebes don't know what these are because, I meant to bring\n\n05:15.240 --> 05:16.240\nyou mine, I forgot.\n\n05:16.240 --> 05:19.520\nEar pods, my ear pods.\n\n05:19.520 --> 05:22.840\nThese guys are going to be gone in like 48 hours.\n\n05:22.840 --> 05:23.840\nNo way, man.\n\n05:23.840 --> 05:27.000\nI'm never going to lose you, baby, again.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:29.040\nWhere'd you even find those anyway?\n\n05:29.040 --> 05:33.880\nHe put them in, he's dancing like he's already playing music on them and I know that's not\n\n05:33.880 --> 05:34.880\nhow it works.\n\n05:34.880 --> 05:42.800\nI'm dancing like Brad Pitt in Fight Club when he runs around the corner with, what's\n\n05:42.800 --> 05:43.800\nyour name?\n\n05:43.800 --> 05:46.800\nTim Burton's wife.\n\n05:46.800 --> 05:48.960\nSorry ladies.\n\n05:48.960 --> 05:51.360\nEverything she does can unobjectify her.\n\n05:51.360 --> 05:54.400\nShe's still just some guy's wife.\n\n05:54.400 --> 06:00.040\nHelen Abonham Carter, and he drags her around the corner and then he just starts going like\n\n06:00.040 --> 06:06.640\nthis because the cops run by because if you're dancing in a junkie hallway, you're not who\n\n06:06.640 --> 06:07.640\nthey're looking for.\n\n06:07.640 --> 06:13.520\nThis is the only time I would say it was better to not pay the $5 a month for the live streams\n\n06:13.520 --> 06:16.520\nso they didn't have to see that dance.\n\n06:16.520 --> 06:19.720\nThey might have saved themselves the trouble on that one.\n\n06:19.720 --> 06:23.440\nTo answer your question, Spencer, you found them in your car.\n\n06:23.440 --> 06:24.440\nWhat?\n\n06:24.440 --> 06:25.440\nYeah.\n\n06:25.440 --> 06:26.440\nCrazy.\n\n06:26.440 --> 06:32.200\nWhy did I know that?\n\n06:32.200 --> 06:47.400\nSo I was in the, it's not a hospital, it's a surgery center, trying to see if I can take\n\n06:47.400 --> 06:48.400\ncare of that.\n\n06:48.400 --> 06:54.080\nThey put a camera down my throat again because, okay, this is a little crazy.\n\n06:54.080 --> 07:00.120\nYou know, I have a chronic heartburn, I can't imagine why.\n\n07:00.120 --> 07:08.760\nI've been searching and searching for a way to mitigate the burning pain in my esophagus.\n\n07:08.760 --> 07:16.760\nThe first time I went, they looked down my cake tunnel and they found some polyps and\n\n07:16.760 --> 07:23.120\nthey grabbed them and sent them off to a lab to see if they were cancer polyps.\n\n07:23.120 --> 07:30.480\nThen they said, oh, your digestive system looks great and I can't even, what the fuck,\n\n07:30.480 --> 07:34.360\nwere they looking for that time because then they said, I'm getting so upset just thinking\n\n07:34.360 --> 07:38.360\nabout it because I was, I told you last time, I was a little upset in the last episode,\n\n07:38.360 --> 07:43.280\nyou might have noticed the tonal shift here, I'm a little calmer now.\n\n07:43.280 --> 07:47.280\nYou were on some pretty heavy-duty painkillers, they give you for that, are you still floating\n\n07:47.280 --> 07:48.280\non those or is that over?\n\n07:48.280 --> 07:51.960\nHow I feel like it, but they tell you don't make any business decisions today, no matter\n\n07:51.960 --> 08:01.400\nthat's what they say, which is kind of delightful, I was like, I cancel my calls, smithers.\n\n08:01.400 --> 08:05.320\nDon't call North Korea until tomorrow.\n\n08:05.320 --> 08:09.840\nDon't address any Boy Scouts for God's sake.\n\n08:09.840 --> 08:15.320\nYou might not be in a proper frame of mind to hold the stitching of society together.\n\n08:15.320 --> 08:18.680\nMind your peas and queues, sir.\n\n08:18.680 --> 08:22.640\nDon't go off on a psychotropic substance stumbling into society.\n\n08:22.640 --> 08:24.840\nYou might end up elected president.\n\n08:24.840 --> 08:27.440\nAll right.\n\n08:27.440 --> 08:31.680\nDon't have half a brain when you just run out into the street shouting whenever you're\n\n08:31.680 --> 08:33.880\nfeeling.\n\n08:33.880 --> 08:39.040\nYou'll get rewarded for it endlessly and then die while killing everyone.\n\n08:39.040 --> 08:41.320\nYou wouldn't want that, Mr. Harmon.\n\n08:41.320 --> 08:43.440\nGoodbye, want some cheez-its?\n\n08:43.440 --> 08:45.720\nThey gave me cheez-its.\n\n08:45.720 --> 08:52.480\nJust the one thing is, after you wake up, you're super high.\n\n08:52.480 --> 08:58.720\nIt's kind of an intimidating thing to be rolled into a room where they don't design surgery\n\n08:58.720 --> 09:04.760\nrooms to be, they wouldn't want fluffy pillows in there and stuff with hair on them.\n\n09:04.760 --> 09:10.000\nThe comfort goes hand-in-hand with non-sterility.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:15.000\nYou wouldn't want beanbags in your room or oil paintings and the oil's going to get\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:17.080\nin your body.\n\n09:17.080 --> 09:25.760\nIt's like a grody, creepy jigsaw room, but clean, but still sociopathic and just beeping\n\n09:25.760 --> 09:29.040\nand you can hear your heart beeping and then when you hear your heart beeping, it starts\n\n09:29.040 --> 09:33.040\nbeeping faster and then you try to experiment with lowering it because you think you're\n\n09:33.040 --> 09:37.360\ngoing to blow their mind and go like, who are you?\n\n09:37.360 --> 09:46.680\nYou feel like I'm just seeing an eagle in the sky, but then they start this fucking thing\n\n09:46.680 --> 09:52.600\nthrough the IV and this time they didn't even say, count down from 10 to 1, they just didn't\n\n09:52.600 --> 10:00.360\neven give a fuck and I was like, boom, you're out and you're instantly awake, nothing happens.\n\n10:00.360 --> 10:04.880\nIt's not like being asleep where you have this weird consciousness of time, it's like\n\n10:04.880 --> 10:09.600\na cut and then you're in a different room and no one else is there because they left\n\n10:09.600 --> 10:14.040\nyour ass because you're boring because you have been knocked out.\n\n10:14.040 --> 10:17.920\nYou feel abandoned because you're like, wait, everybody left, but it's like, no, we were\n\n10:17.920 --> 10:21.520\nall here with you, we rolled you like the furniture you are into a corner after we cut\n\n10:21.520 --> 10:25.280\nsome polyps out of your stomach, fucking chill out when you start babbling like a maniac,\n\n10:25.280 --> 10:27.560\nwe'll come back and give you cheez-its.\n\n10:27.560 --> 10:29.800\nWhy is cheez-its the goat's neck?\n\n10:29.800 --> 10:33.640\nI don't know, but why do they follow the bag of cheez-its with a lecture about why you're\n\n10:33.640 --> 10:34.640\nfat?\n\n10:34.640 --> 10:41.760\nI never said the phrase, you guys gave me the cheez-its so many times today because they\n\n10:41.760 --> 10:45.320\nkept coming in and they're like, you want some cheez-its?\n\n10:45.320 --> 10:48.240\nI'm like, yes?\n\n10:48.240 --> 10:50.040\nAm I in heaven?\n\n10:50.040 --> 10:53.800\nAnd then the cheez-its are like, okay, the doctor will be right in and then another person\n\n10:53.800 --> 10:58.360\ncomes in and goes like, Mr. Harmon, listen, we didn't find anything in there that's not\n\n10:58.360 --> 11:04.800\nthe result of a guy your age having gained your amount of weight.\n\n11:04.800 --> 11:06.800\nYou guys gave me the cheez-its.\n\n11:06.800 --> 11:08.440\nNo, I know, sir.\n\n11:08.440 --> 11:09.440\nI just sang.\n\n11:09.440 --> 11:12.120\nIt just kept happening, like different people kept coming in.\n\n11:12.120 --> 11:14.960\nDid they give you the airport-sized bag of those or like a big bag?\n\n11:14.960 --> 11:20.160\nIt was a little baby bag, but I just kind of felt like maybe if I wasn't eating cheez-its\n\n11:20.160 --> 11:24.840\nwith crumbs all over my face that maybe they would have laid off the fat lectures a little\n\n11:24.840 --> 11:29.960\nbit because at least, I'm not saying I would have looked thinner with now, oh, cheez-its\n\n11:29.960 --> 11:35.800\nin my hand, but maybe they would have thought like, well, he must not know that he's fat.\n\n11:35.800 --> 11:39.960\nFor all we know, he started his diet yesterday, let's not fuck with him too much, but they\n\n11:39.960 --> 11:40.960\nwere like, dude, you're fat.\n\n11:40.960 --> 11:42.720\nI'm like, you gave me cheez-its.\n\n11:42.720 --> 11:49.040\nYeah, maybe trail mix, maybe something not so fatty, like a cluster all the way.\n\n11:49.040 --> 11:53.680\nWell, now that you're pitching that, I'm like, fuck, no, that would be awful, that would\n\n11:53.680 --> 11:54.680\nbe awful.\n\n11:54.680 --> 12:00.720\nYeah, but you would feel like you were in a hospital, not a trail mix.\n\n12:00.720 --> 12:01.720\nWhat would be a good hospital?\n\n12:01.720 --> 12:04.440\nLike, I don't know, it'd be like a Robocop paste, you know, they'd be like-\n\n12:04.440 --> 12:05.440\nYeah, it's applesauce.\n\n12:05.440 --> 12:06.440\nYeah, applesauce.\n\n12:06.440 --> 12:11.280\nIt would be like in one of those paper containers that when you finish, you can unfold it and\n\n12:11.280 --> 12:13.080\nturn it into a yamaka.\n\n12:13.080 --> 12:17.520\nBut there must be some sort of scientific reason, like is it because of the salts, the fats,\n\n12:17.520 --> 12:19.320\nlike the things that you were depruted?\n\n12:19.320 --> 12:22.000\nYeah, I'm sure they were like, yeah, I'm sure they were.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:23.000\nOr it's just big cheez-its.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:24.000\nBig cheez-its.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:25.000\nThey were like, what the fuck are they involved?\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:30.440\nYeah, they got like depribulators with the cheez-it brands, depribulators, there's station\n\n12:30.440 --> 12:34.160\nareas like cheez-it, station area, they're like, what's going on here?\n\n12:34.160 --> 12:38.000\nAnd you leave your hospital, you call it not a hospital, and you realize that you were\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\njust at Nabisco the whole time.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:46.600\nYeah, you look back, because you hear one squeaky hinge, and you look back and the stage\n\n12:46.600 --> 12:53.400\nhands are hoisting the flat, it's like, God, isn't a giant box of crackers.\n\n12:53.400 --> 12:57.400\nI was in the Kiebler Elf Tree, and they were all on stilts.\n\n12:57.400 --> 13:01.880\nI told you, I went under general anesthesia once for my wisdom teeth, and I woke up and\n\n13:01.880 --> 13:05.760\nsomething horrible had happened, like there was a footprint on my chest and my belt was\n\n13:05.760 --> 13:06.760\noff.\n\n13:06.760 --> 13:07.760\nI've been under three times.\n\n13:07.760 --> 13:12.680\nAnd the doctor wasn't there, and I asked the woman, like the nurse, I was like, where\n\n13:12.680 --> 13:13.680\nis the doctor?\n\n13:13.680 --> 13:14.680\nHe left.\n\n13:14.680 --> 13:15.680\nLike, when?\n\n13:15.680 --> 13:16.680\nWhen?\n\n13:16.680 --> 13:23.000\nIt was like a couple of hours ago, I'm like, what's up, like, was, did everything,\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.800\ndid all my teeth come out okay?\n\n13:25.800 --> 13:29.160\nIt was a struggle.\n\n13:29.160 --> 13:31.480\nMy belt, my belt was off.\n\n13:31.480 --> 13:36.920\nI went to sleep with my belt on, and I tell you, fucking for sure, and then she showed\n\n13:36.920 --> 13:42.000\nme my teeth in a cup, and it looked like they had gone hammer and chisel on those motherfuckers,\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:43.000\nbecause they had.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:47.560\nAnd then I go home, and my friend drove me home, because you have to have somebody to\n\n13:47.560 --> 13:55.760\ndrive you home, because you're high as a kite, and I go home, I have to get my prescription\n\n13:55.760 --> 13:56.760\ncard.\n\n13:56.760 --> 13:59.240\nHave I told the story before on the show?\n\n13:59.240 --> 14:01.280\nI can't remember.\n\n14:01.280 --> 14:02.280\nWe've both gotten this.\n\n14:02.280 --> 14:03.280\nI have.\n\n14:03.280 --> 14:04.280\nEarly on?\n\n14:04.280 --> 14:05.280\nCome on.\n\n14:05.280 --> 14:06.280\nWhat did you think, though?\n\n14:06.280 --> 14:07.280\nIt's kind of like gremlins, too.\n\n14:07.280 --> 14:08.280\nYou want to see it again.\n\n14:08.280 --> 14:09.280\nYou're not sure.\n\n14:09.280 --> 14:19.880\nYou're like, wasn't there like a trans gremlin in that movie that transitioned and was like\n\n14:19.880 --> 14:20.880\nkissing other gremlins?\n\n14:20.880 --> 14:22.200\nI can't remember.\n\n14:22.200 --> 14:24.240\nI think we need to watch it again.\n\n14:24.240 --> 14:28.960\nThe only funny part for me was that I went to go get my insurance, like my prescription\n\n14:28.960 --> 14:32.360\ncard, and then while I was up, that was so high, I thought, oh, I'm going to take some\n\n14:32.360 --> 14:33.360\ntrash out.\n\n14:33.360 --> 14:35.840\nSo I threw my prescription card out with the trash.\n\n14:35.840 --> 14:37.840\nYeah, that is the funniest.\n\n14:37.840 --> 14:41.720\nAnd then I got to the place, and now the paint colors are wearing off.\n\n14:41.720 --> 14:42.720\nI'm dying.\n\n14:42.720 --> 14:47.360\nWe had to go figure out where my thing was, and I was just now not high enough to remember\n\n14:47.360 --> 14:49.520\nto dig through my trash and find the fucking thing.\n\n14:49.520 --> 14:53.080\nYeah, that's why they wouldn't let me take an Uber from the place.\n\n14:53.080 --> 14:59.600\nAlso, they said it's sexist, and you should take a left, but they wouldn't let me take\n\n14:59.600 --> 15:05.080\nan Uber because they were like, oh, you have to be like a limo service that we have a relationship\n\n15:05.080 --> 15:10.040\nwith, and I'm like, OK, the Cheez-It transit company, maybe?\n\n15:10.040 --> 15:11.040\nCheez-Wheels?\n\n15:11.040 --> 15:12.040\nYour car is Cheez-It.\n\n15:12.040 --> 15:13.040\nThe fucking wheels are square.\n\n15:13.040 --> 15:14.040\nIt gets shitty mileage.\n\n15:14.040 --> 15:18.040\nIt's shaped like a trisket.\n\n15:18.040 --> 15:19.720\nThe salty, salty rover.\n\n15:19.720 --> 15:24.520\nThey shouldn't be giving you fucking Cheez-Its after you've had a surgery.\n\n15:24.520 --> 15:25.520\nThat's crazy.\n\n15:25.520 --> 15:28.240\nWell, the customer's always right, man.\n\n15:28.240 --> 15:30.760\nI think at that point, they're like, we put a camera down your throat.\n\n15:30.760 --> 15:31.760\nYou survived.\n\n15:31.760 --> 15:32.760\nEat one bag of crackers.\n\n15:32.760 --> 15:33.760\nDid you get to see the camera?\n\n15:33.760 --> 15:36.320\nDo you get to look at the apparatus before it goes down your gut?\n\n15:36.320 --> 15:38.960\nThey don't show you the, I'm sure I could have asked.\n\n15:38.960 --> 15:41.640\nI don't think they probably want you to see it, though.\n\n15:41.640 --> 15:45.160\nI was kind of like, I could have asked this time because I kind of like, this was like\n\n15:45.160 --> 15:50.760\nmy third time going, you know, I had an endoscopy and then I had a biopsy for the sarcoid thing,\n\n15:50.760 --> 15:54.800\nand then this was my second time going under in a lightweight, you know, so like this isn't\n\n15:54.800 --> 15:55.800\neven like surgery.\n\n15:55.800 --> 15:58.840\nThis is just like, so I was like, I was fucking Bill Murray and that shit.\n\n15:58.840 --> 16:00.320\nI was like, they're wheeling me in.\n\n16:00.320 --> 16:05.440\nI'm like, hey, Glenda, how's it going, still looking good?\n\n16:05.440 --> 16:14.040\nMy name's Diane and that isn't funny anymore, just pointing at women and sexualizing them.\n\n16:14.040 --> 16:16.760\nThat was, you were a hero in the 80s, if you did that.\n\n16:16.760 --> 16:18.760\nSorry, I'm 44.\n\n16:18.760 --> 16:24.520\nI know, I've seen your x-rays, but they, like, you know, doctor, doctor, doctor, what's\n\n16:24.520 --> 16:28.720\nhis fuck, he's like, hey, Dan, welcome back.\n\n16:28.720 --> 16:29.720\nIt's good to be back.\n\n16:29.720 --> 16:34.600\nI was like, I was like a real charmer, you know, but I get like a hair net on him, man,\n\n16:34.600 --> 16:35.800\nI'm like, it's good to be back.\n\n16:35.800 --> 16:39.520\nI'm like, this guy thinks he's in some kind of lounge.\n\n16:39.520 --> 16:40.680\nI was cool, man.\n\n16:40.680 --> 16:43.320\nI wasn't getting a lot of laughs, but I was like funny.\n\n16:43.320 --> 16:46.560\nI just think doctors, like, I just think I wouldn't want them to be cracking up because\n\n16:46.560 --> 16:47.720\nthen it'd be like, these guys are shakeable.\n\n16:47.720 --> 16:49.560\nLike, I don't want that.\n\n16:49.560 --> 16:55.440\nThey're focused on their craft, but I know I was being funny.\n\n16:55.440 --> 16:58.680\nThey have like, they probably have like an orientation video where they're like, look,\n\n16:58.680 --> 17:02.240\nsome of your patients, you're in Los Angeles, some of your patients are going to be crackups,\n\n17:02.240 --> 17:03.240\nyou know?\n\n17:03.240 --> 17:06.800\nLike they're going to be talented people, like crazy geniuses, you know?\n\n17:06.800 --> 17:11.280\nSome of them are going to have a gift for moving the human heart.\n\n17:11.280 --> 17:15.240\nYou got to, like, trust me, as much as it seems like they would love for you to break\n\n17:15.240 --> 17:23.000\ninto gales of frivolity, as much as it would be involuntary, truly, given their hilarity\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:28.680\nacumen, just keep a stiff upper lip.\n\n17:28.680 --> 17:34.880\nThey probably do things like, you know, like, soldier guys, like, they, like, they like\n\n17:34.880 --> 17:35.880\nexpit.\n\n17:35.880 --> 17:43.120\nThey, like, you know, why did I, the only thing, I'm going to try to make this specific.\n\n17:43.120 --> 17:46.360\nI'll just make them men.\n\n17:46.360 --> 17:49.000\nYou went way out of your way to make them men.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:50.720\nThat was the final result, but that was not the intention.\n\n17:50.720 --> 17:56.240\nI was trying to, I was, I was like, God, come on, Tom Clancy, do it.\n\n17:56.240 --> 17:58.400\nSoldier guys.\n\n17:58.400 --> 18:00.600\nNow it sounds like you've been in the military.\n\n18:00.600 --> 18:02.560\nUh, I, you know, like-\n\n18:02.560 --> 18:04.080\nAlso, when you said surgery room.\n\n18:04.080 --> 18:07.680\nInfantry, I was, I think I was searching for infantry and came up with soldier guys.\n\n18:07.680 --> 18:11.680\nYou can't turn soldier into infantry, if soldier infantry, you'll sound like an idiot.\n\n18:11.680 --> 18:16.520\nI went soldier guys, I fucking saved it.\n\n18:16.520 --> 18:19.760\nIn their training, one of the things they have to do, or I saw I've seen in movies,\n\n18:19.760 --> 18:23.880\nis that they, you know, or like they, they expose you to tear gas, right?\n\n18:23.880 --> 18:27.240\nLike, or, you know, whatever you're using on other people, they're like, take off your\n\n18:27.240 --> 18:28.240\ngas mask.\n\n18:28.240 --> 18:30.760\nYou know, you've seen that scene in the movies and they, you got to, like, sit there and\n\n18:30.760 --> 18:32.800\ntake the fucking tear gas.\n\n18:32.800 --> 18:37.080\nThey probably do, they, they have to do that with comedy in the operating room.\n\n18:37.080 --> 18:42.120\nThey have to hear all the dumb semi sedated jokes that they're going to hear.\n\n18:42.120 --> 18:49.840\nThey have to watch, like, season two of Community.\n\n18:49.840 --> 18:53.400\nI was gonna, you know, when I started that sentence, I was gonna say, like, the British\n\n18:53.400 --> 18:54.400\noffice.\n\n18:54.400 --> 18:56.640\nBut then I was like, I think that was one season.\n\n18:56.640 --> 19:01.920\nAnd then I was like, do Parks and Rec, and then I was like, fuck it.\n\n19:01.920 --> 19:05.000\nWrite what you know.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:08.920\nI, I still, I still on the line that Greg Proops uses every time for the last 30 years\n\n19:08.920 --> 19:11.120\nat his dentist he's been going to forever.\n\n19:11.120 --> 19:15.280\nBut every time he gets in the chair, every time the dentist asks him, are you comfortable?\n\n19:15.280 --> 19:21.680\nAnd Greg always says, I make a living.\n\n19:21.680 --> 19:22.840\nThat's always a goodie.\n\n19:22.840 --> 19:25.040\nBut it's funnier if you're an old Jewish comic.\n\n19:25.040 --> 19:26.040\nI said, I make a living.\n\n19:26.040 --> 19:27.840\nHe has a little exchange I had.\n\n19:27.840 --> 19:28.840\nI'm no Greg Proops.\n\n19:28.840 --> 19:30.360\nBut he said, he said, welcome back.\n\n19:30.360 --> 19:31.360\nI said, it's good to be back.\n\n19:31.360 --> 19:33.480\nAnd he said, how, how are you feeling?\n\n19:33.480 --> 19:34.800\nAnd I said, I said, great.\n\n19:34.800 --> 19:36.560\nI just had a huge sandwich.\n\n19:36.560 --> 19:39.960\nAnd because they, you're not supposed to eat for like eight hours because they're\n\n19:39.960 --> 19:41.560\ngoing to go in there.\n\n19:41.560 --> 19:43.040\nAnd he's like, oh, thanks for telling us.\n\n19:43.040 --> 19:48.760\nI said, look, if you found a sandwich in the bathroom, you'd eat it too.\n\n19:48.760 --> 19:49.760\nThese are good jokes.\n\n19:49.760 --> 19:50.760\nYeah.\n\n19:50.760 --> 19:51.760\nThese are good jokes.\n\n19:51.760 --> 19:52.760\nAnd they're stone-faced.\n\n19:52.760 --> 19:54.920\nAnd it's not because I'm not funny.\n\n19:54.920 --> 19:57.520\nIt's because they're good doctors.\n\n19:57.520 --> 20:01.040\nThey want me to stay alive, make more people happy.\n\n20:01.040 --> 20:07.600\nWhy don't we make your next HBO special, just you on a gurney?\n\n20:07.600 --> 20:12.200\nAnd you're really letting the doctor staff have it.\n\n20:12.200 --> 20:16.280\nYou're making light of what could potentially be a fatal thing that's going on here.\n\n20:16.280 --> 20:17.280\nI could.\n\n20:17.280 --> 20:18.280\nThey always have to tell you.\n\n20:18.280 --> 20:19.280\nThey feel like they've got to tell you.\n\n20:19.280 --> 20:22.560\nThere's like a point zero one chance you'll wake up and choke on the camera and die.\n\n20:22.560 --> 20:27.680\nIsn't that crazy that they put a camera down your throat and like, if you were to wake\n\n20:27.680 --> 20:31.080\nup, it's like, it's exactly like Wiley Coyote, like when he runs off the edge of the cliff.\n\n20:31.080 --> 20:35.560\nAs long as he doesn't just fucking stay in the zone Wiley, like, like you could just,\n\n20:35.560 --> 20:39.600\nthe time it took for you to mug to the camera and hold up a sign that says, Yikes, you could\n\n20:39.600 --> 20:41.240\nhave made it to the other cliff.\n\n20:41.240 --> 20:42.440\nYou can technically fly.\n\n20:42.440 --> 20:45.440\nYou just have to be less self-aware.\n\n20:45.440 --> 20:52.400\nIf you have a camera down your throat, they can just churn you like a butter bucket.\n\n20:52.400 --> 21:02.520\nThey can just churn you like the fuselage on a butter churn.\n\n21:02.520 --> 21:09.880\nBut if you were to wake up, simply wake up, you'd be like, and you'd immediately die.\n\n21:09.880 --> 21:13.160\nBecause there's a camera down your throat because if you were in a bar fight, that's\n\n21:13.160 --> 21:15.160\na way to kill you.\n\n21:15.160 --> 21:24.280\nYou have a bar fight in like an EV room, like a bar fight with like filmmakers.\n\n21:24.280 --> 21:29.200\nWhy was my belt off and why didn't they put it back on?\n\n21:29.200 --> 21:33.960\nWhat message were they trying to send me, like, no, no, leave it off, leave it off.\n\n21:33.960 --> 21:38.360\nI wanted to know exactly what the emotional crisis I went through.\n\n21:38.360 --> 21:42.880\nIf the doctor was in the room, it would just be like, kind of like, oh, was I, you know,\n\n21:42.880 --> 21:46.480\nit's like, it's almost not funny because it's just sort of like, oh, what happened.\n\n21:46.480 --> 21:49.720\nBut the fact that the doctor's got makes it funny to me because it's like, this is a story\n\n21:49.720 --> 21:53.800\nhappened and he was like, I need some space.\n\n21:53.800 --> 21:57.840\nAnd then she's like, I want to start sexually assaulting other patients.\n\n21:57.840 --> 22:00.960\nIt's like ordinary people now that are like, she's hold, she's trying to hold it together\n\n22:00.960 --> 22:02.440\nand like, where did the doctor go?\n\n22:02.440 --> 22:05.120\nHe'll be back when he, when you have calmed down.\n\n22:05.120 --> 22:06.120\nYes.\n\n22:06.120 --> 22:07.120\nYes.\n\n22:07.120 --> 22:08.120\nHe's staying at Shutter's for three weekends now.\n\n22:08.120 --> 22:09.120\nHe's going to sleep.\n\n22:09.120 --> 22:12.440\nShe's like, he'll be back later and then she's like cleaning some tools and then like,\n\n22:12.440 --> 22:16.360\n20 seconds goes by and she goes, you know, he's a good doctor and he works hard.\n\n22:16.360 --> 22:20.720\nAnd you're like, what the fuck?\n\n22:20.720 --> 22:23.560\nSo he's allowed to grab, to play with my dick.\n\n22:23.560 --> 22:24.800\nIs that what you think happened?\n\n22:24.800 --> 22:28.440\nBut then the thing, the thing that they tell you when you're getting, I had all four wisdom\n\n22:28.440 --> 22:32.480\nteeth that way too late in life and they said that there's a chance that a whole, it stopped\n\n22:32.480 --> 22:36.640\nme if I've talked about this before, there's a chance that you'll perforate the sinus bone\n\n22:36.640 --> 22:39.560\nup here above your, your teeth.\n\n22:39.560 --> 22:40.960\nAnd I remembered signing that thing.\n\n22:40.960 --> 22:41.960\nOh yeah.\n\n22:41.960 --> 22:42.960\nAnd if it happens, it's not a big deal.\n\n22:42.960 --> 22:43.960\nYour bone will regenerate.\n\n22:43.960 --> 22:44.960\nIt'll, you know, it'll be a thing.\n\n22:44.960 --> 22:49.120\nI don't remember that after the thing because I'm drugged out of my mind.\n\n22:49.120 --> 22:51.960\nThe next morning I get up, rinse my mouth out.\n\n22:51.960 --> 22:55.000\nLike you're not supposed to like, like spit and do anything of violence with your sinuses.\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:56.000\nOh God.\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:59.120\nAnd I lean forward and everything in my mouth poured out of my nose because there's a hole\n\n22:59.120 --> 23:00.360\nin my face.\n\n23:00.360 --> 23:05.960\nAnd now everything, then I was eating some miso soup and I leaned, that night I leaned\n\n23:05.960 --> 23:06.960\nover.\n\n23:06.960 --> 23:10.480\nI leaned over to get more miso soup and the miso soup that was currently in my mouth went\n\n23:10.480 --> 23:14.440\nback into the bowl.\n\n23:14.440 --> 23:15.440\nYou're like a muppet.\n\n23:15.440 --> 23:18.440\nYou're like the cookie master.\n\n23:18.440 --> 23:19.440\nIt's motherfucker.\n\n23:19.440 --> 23:20.440\nI don't like cookies.\n\n23:20.440 --> 23:22.320\nI was a, I was a fountain.\n\n23:22.320 --> 23:27.080\nI was a, and then I freaked out and I was like, I called the doctor and he's like, remember\n\n23:27.080 --> 23:29.440\nthat we had this big conversation and it's going to be fine.\n\n23:29.440 --> 23:30.440\nI go, what do I do?\n\n23:30.440 --> 23:33.440\nHe goes, just don't sneeze for two months.\n\n23:33.440 --> 23:35.440\nFuck you.\n\n23:35.440 --> 23:37.360\nWhere's my cheez-its?\n\n23:37.360 --> 23:39.080\nWhere's my cheez-its?\n\n23:39.080 --> 23:41.560\nThe last time you talked about this, I probably mentioned this.\n\n23:41.560 --> 23:45.200\nWe're like an old married couple that both have dementia and we're just triggering each\n\n23:45.200 --> 23:48.000\nother like, oh no, the navy soup, navy.\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:49.000\nI was in the navy.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:50.720\nYou were in the navy.\n\n23:50.720 --> 23:52.940\nI was in the, I, I, I, I.\n\n23:52.940 --> 23:56.360\nYour story is going to be about the song Me So Horny.\n\n23:56.360 --> 24:00.100\nBut there's a, there's a, there's a nerve in your upper lip.\n\n24:00.100 --> 24:04.720\nThat's why in cartoons, like when Scooby-Doo's about to sneeze, Shaggy will like, like put\n\n24:04.720 --> 24:05.720\nhis thing.\n\n24:05.720 --> 24:07.040\nIt's like, I always thought that was so dumb.\n\n24:07.040 --> 24:08.040\nIt was like, oh, you're right.\n\n24:08.040 --> 24:11.440\nBut it's like, there's like a, if you push really hard on your upper lip, like if you're\n\n24:11.440 --> 24:14.720\never in a situation where you feel like you truly have to sneeze and like it's a do or\n\n24:14.720 --> 24:16.280\ndie, like, I've done it.\n\n24:16.280 --> 24:17.280\nIt works.\n\n24:17.280 --> 24:18.280\nLike you just shove really hard.\n\n24:18.280 --> 24:19.280\nIt's like some kind of nerve in there.\n\n24:19.280 --> 24:20.280\nOh well.\n\n24:20.280 --> 24:21.280\nAll right.\n\n24:21.280 --> 24:22.280\nOkay.\n\n24:22.280 --> 24:26.200\nSo it's not about the nose, it's about the, it's about the lip.\n\n24:26.200 --> 24:27.200\nYeah.\n\n24:27.200 --> 24:28.200\nIt's pushing on the lip.\n\n24:28.200 --> 24:30.520\nI don't know why you'd have to do it with your, with a fucking gangster style with your\n\n24:30.520 --> 24:31.520\nside of your finger.\n\n24:31.520 --> 24:32.520\nI don't know why people don't go like this.\n\n24:32.520 --> 24:38.080\nI guess because if people were coming like from behind you or in front of you, is that,\n\n24:38.080 --> 24:39.080\nis that you picking his nose?\n\n24:39.080 --> 24:43.980\nAnd you say you want to be like, no dude, I'm like, I'm like, I'm just doing a crazy\n\n24:43.980 --> 24:46.480\nmustache game.\n\n24:46.480 --> 24:48.480\nAnd then you can tell them later, sorry about lying to you.\n\n24:48.480 --> 24:49.480\nI was trying to stop sneezing.\n\n24:49.480 --> 24:51.200\nAnd they're like, oh cool.\n\n24:51.200 --> 24:53.080\nI thought you were trying to mine my mustache.\n\n24:53.080 --> 24:54.080\nNo dude.\n\n24:54.080 --> 24:57.280\nBut as, and I was like, well, shit, at least you weren't picking your nose.\n\n24:57.280 --> 24:59.280\nLike, no, and it didn't even look like it did it.\n\n24:59.280 --> 25:00.280\nNo.\n\n25:00.280 --> 25:02.840\nCause you weren't using the tip of your finger.\n\n25:02.840 --> 25:08.560\nConversely, if you're a ninja, what I learned in Ninja magazines in the 80s is that you\n\n25:08.560 --> 25:13.480\nwant to point your sword directly at your prey because it's invisible from a distance\n\n25:13.480 --> 25:15.080\nthat way.\n\n25:15.080 --> 25:16.080\nThink about it.\n\n25:16.080 --> 25:17.080\nYou hold your sword like this.\n\n25:17.080 --> 25:18.080\nOh, there's a ninja.\n\n25:18.080 --> 25:19.080\nHe's got a sword.\n\n25:19.080 --> 25:20.080\nGo like this.\n\n25:20.080 --> 25:21.080\nWhat's that ninja doing?\n\n25:21.080 --> 25:22.080\nYeah.\n\n25:22.080 --> 25:23.080\nI'm going to kick his ass.\n\n25:23.080 --> 25:24.080\nI'm going to charge at him.\n\n25:24.080 --> 25:32.400\nI'll tell you right now, if I see a ninja in front of me and I can't tell what he's\n\n25:32.400 --> 25:34.600\ndoing, I know he's doing something fucking ninja style.\n\n25:34.600 --> 25:39.680\nWell, because of the magazines, but I mean, a lot of ninjas were mad at these magazines\n\n25:39.680 --> 25:40.680\nin the 80s.\n\n25:40.680 --> 25:45.680\nLike, did you have a subscription to Ninja magazine?\n\n25:45.680 --> 25:51.600\nIt was 1982 and you got one with your locker.\n\n25:51.600 --> 25:52.600\nDid I have ninja stars?\n\n25:52.600 --> 25:53.600\nI had all the ninja stars.\n\n25:53.600 --> 25:54.600\nYeah.\n\n25:54.600 --> 25:55.600\nI mean, you could make them out of paper, right?\n\n25:55.600 --> 25:57.120\nYou know how to make a ninja star out of paper.\n\n25:57.120 --> 25:59.680\nDo you millennials know how to make a ninja star out of paper?\n\n25:59.680 --> 26:03.600\nI heard some mixed messages there, but mostly no.\n\n26:03.600 --> 26:06.200\nThat's something you could learn.\n\n26:06.200 --> 26:09.600\nA lethal ninja star when they could break skin?\n\n26:09.600 --> 26:10.600\nWell, no.\n\n26:10.600 --> 26:11.600\nYou hit someone.\n\n26:11.600 --> 26:13.920\nAs with everything, if you hit someone in the eye with it, I'm sure it could do some\n\n26:13.920 --> 26:14.920\ndamage.\n\n26:14.920 --> 26:22.280\nThat goes for socks, pillowcases, ferrets, popcorn, kisses, if you kiss someone in the\n\n26:22.280 --> 26:26.560\neye really hard, you could blind them.\n\n26:26.560 --> 26:33.240\nOr you can give them mono, mono-ocleosis, that's what they call it, it's when you get\n\n26:33.240 --> 26:35.240\nit in the eye.\n\n26:35.240 --> 26:39.440\nThat's just science pieces of shit.\n\n26:39.440 --> 26:48.560\nThat's what the Cyclops had in the Spanish ads, the odyssey.\n\n26:48.560 --> 26:51.200\nSpencer, were you ever a weapon enthusiast?\n\n26:51.200 --> 26:52.600\nDid you have like throwing stars?\n\n26:52.600 --> 26:53.600\nOh, yeah.\n\n26:53.600 --> 26:54.600\nKatanas?\n\n26:54.600 --> 26:55.600\nI mean, come on.\n\n26:55.600 --> 26:57.080\nDo you even have to ask?\n\n26:57.080 --> 26:58.080\nYeah, of course.\n\n26:58.080 --> 26:59.080\nYeah.\n\n26:59.080 --> 27:00.080\nThey're just Chinatown.\n\n27:00.080 --> 27:03.120\nYou could get anything, man.\n\n27:03.120 --> 27:05.280\nThis guy invented seagull hunting.\n\n27:05.280 --> 27:06.280\nYeah.\n\n27:06.280 --> 27:11.320\nOh, that's right, by burying yourself in the sand and having a bag, what was your weapon\n\n27:11.320 --> 27:12.320\nof choice?\n\n27:12.320 --> 27:13.640\nThat was in a ninja magazine.\n\n27:13.640 --> 27:16.600\nI tuned it towards seagulls.\n\n27:16.600 --> 27:22.800\nIt was like retired ninja quarterly.\n\n27:22.800 --> 27:29.200\nFulfilled your blood oath, kids moved out, try hunting some seagull.\n\n27:29.200 --> 27:39.720\nIt's a great way to placate your neurotic compulsion to avenge and be invisible without\n\n27:39.720 --> 27:43.360\npinching the pocket.\n\n27:43.360 --> 27:46.080\nI can see, Spencer, correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n27:46.080 --> 27:50.000\nI can see you as having owned at least one pair of nunchucks in your lifetime.\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.080\nNot nunchucks, no.\n\n27:52.080 --> 27:53.920\nThose are dangerous, man.\n\n27:53.920 --> 27:58.440\nYou really got to know how to use them before they stop being dangerous to oneself.\n\n27:58.440 --> 28:02.960\nYeah, nunchucks is the weapon that kills you before you kill you.\n\n28:02.960 --> 28:04.960\nYou learn to kill somebody else with it.\n\n28:04.960 --> 28:10.280\nI think that's why in every scene in movies, that's why the person starts off with 10 minutes\n\n28:10.280 --> 28:16.160\nof nunchucking because then the person's supposed to think, god damn, that's a long time without\n\n28:16.160 --> 28:18.480\nhitting yourself in the nuts.\n\n28:18.480 --> 28:21.680\nI better get the fuck out of here.\n\n28:21.680 --> 28:24.920\nIf this guy decides to hit me in the head, he might succeed.\n\n28:24.920 --> 28:26.440\nI'm fucking next.\n\n28:26.440 --> 28:29.160\nHe has avoided his groin for many, many minutes.\n\n28:29.160 --> 28:30.160\nAnd he keeps going down.\n\n28:30.160 --> 28:34.960\nYeah, no, he's purposely, it's like Houdini asking people to punch him in the face.\n\n28:34.960 --> 28:39.560\nHe's going between the legs, hard and low trying to shit.\n\n28:39.560 --> 28:44.200\nI think we should get our guest prepared.\n\n28:44.200 --> 28:45.200\nIs she ready back there?\n\n28:45.200 --> 28:47.400\nDo I need to say that and then pause?\n\n28:47.400 --> 28:49.520\nI don't know.\n\n28:49.520 --> 28:50.520\nThere's no feedback.\n\n28:50.520 --> 28:52.280\nThere's no feedback loop in this show.\n\n28:52.280 --> 28:53.280\nWe don't know what we're doing.\n\n28:53.280 --> 28:56.200\nI'm just flying blind.\n\n28:56.200 --> 28:57.800\nOur guest is a new friend.\n\n28:57.800 --> 29:04.120\nI met her through, I don't know, kind of strange circumstances, but they're also kind of boring\n\n29:04.120 --> 29:11.560\ncircumstances because they're kind of work-related, but I was like, well, this is a person that\n\n29:11.560 --> 29:12.560\nwe should meet.\n\n29:12.560 --> 29:13.560\nI don't know.\n\n29:13.560 --> 29:16.200\nI'm bad at introductions.\n\n29:16.200 --> 29:17.200\nShe's a rapper.\n\n29:17.200 --> 29:18.200\nShe has a bus.\n\n29:18.200 --> 29:22.400\nShe's just back from Burning Man and boy, her wheels tired.\n\n29:22.400 --> 29:26.920\nBoy, her arms burnt, I think.\n\n29:26.920 --> 29:44.560\nLet's bring up B-Squid.\n\n29:44.560 --> 29:46.200\nThat's the music we picked to bring you on.\n\n29:46.200 --> 29:47.200\nIt's beautiful.\n\n29:47.200 --> 29:48.200\nHello, B-Squid.\n\n29:48.200 --> 29:49.200\nHello.\n\n29:49.200 --> 29:53.000\nB-Squid, are you a drinker?\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:56.400\nDo you want me to touch your eyes?\n\n29:56.400 --> 29:57.400\nYou can touch my eyes.\n\n29:57.400 --> 29:58.400\nDo you want eyes?\n\n29:58.400 --> 29:59.400\nYeah, I'd love some eyes.\n\n29:59.400 --> 30:00.400\nThank you.\n\n30:00.400 --> 30:01.400\nHey, Dan.\n\n30:01.400 --> 30:03.000\nCan I touch your eyes?\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:04.000\nYou want to touch my eyes?\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:05.000\nI want to touch your eyes.\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:06.000\nYou can touch my eyes.\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:07.000\nI'll touch hers.\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:10.400\nLet's not touch each other's eyes.\n\n30:10.400 --> 30:11.400\nHere.\n\n30:11.400 --> 30:12.400\nThis is my eyes.\n\n30:12.400 --> 30:13.400\nHand this to Jeff so he can touch it.\n\n30:13.400 --> 30:19.400\nShe's subject to you guys.\n\n30:19.400 --> 30:21.000\nYeah, you need that right now.\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:22.000\nThank you.\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:23.000\nThank you.\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:24.000\nWhat's that?\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:25.000\nHow did you guys meet?\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:26.880\nWhat's the origin story of your friendship?\n\n30:26.880 --> 30:33.160\nWe met in the desert hot springs.\n\n30:33.160 --> 30:37.960\nWe had both just robbed different banks and we were burying our briefcases under the same\n\n30:37.960 --> 30:38.960\ntree.\n\n30:38.960 --> 30:45.880\nMe and Cody and our mutual friend Evan were up there.\n\n30:45.880 --> 30:49.800\nI was working on this Vonnegut thing that I'm adapting with Evan, Sirens of Titan and\n\n30:49.800 --> 30:52.920\nCody was working on her thing.\n\n30:52.920 --> 30:56.680\nWe decided let's take a week and I've never tried that.\n\n30:56.680 --> 30:57.680\nCody always does that.\n\n30:57.680 --> 30:58.680\nShe gets results.\n\n30:58.680 --> 31:02.760\nShe goes away like a sick cat that goes under the stove.\n\n31:02.760 --> 31:09.320\nI was like, where's the cat that comes out and goes, I wrote a draft.\n\n31:09.320 --> 31:13.480\nI was like, I want to try that.\n\n31:13.480 --> 31:14.480\nIt did work.\n\n31:14.480 --> 31:16.480\nEvan and I would go out there.\n\n31:16.480 --> 31:25.280\nWe got two bungalows at this resort and it's at a discount because it was so goddamn hot\n\n31:25.280 --> 31:32.160\nand you're going to the desert, they're like, if you come here, we'll give you a dollar.\n\n31:32.160 --> 31:38.160\nThen we worked for like a business week and then toward the end of it, you came up in\n\n31:38.160 --> 31:41.400\nyour bus because you're friends with Evan.\n\n31:41.400 --> 31:44.480\nIt's not that exciting a story, but it's also kind of like a friend of us.\n\n31:44.480 --> 31:46.560\nWhat kind of bus am I picturing right now?\n\n31:46.560 --> 31:49.160\nIt's a short bus.\n\n31:49.160 --> 31:50.160\nIt's painted blue.\n\n31:50.160 --> 31:51.400\nIt says my name on the side.\n\n31:51.400 --> 31:52.400\nIt says B-squid.\n\n31:52.400 --> 31:53.400\nI used it to tour in.\n\n31:53.400 --> 31:57.080\nIt's where the country.\n\n31:57.080 --> 31:59.120\nYou perform rapping?\n\n31:59.120 --> 32:00.120\nI rap.\n\n32:00.120 --> 32:01.120\nYes.\n\n32:01.120 --> 32:11.280\nYou do shows around the coast and inland and anywhere they'll have me.\n\n32:11.280 --> 32:12.960\nYou do a lot of live performance, right?\n\n32:12.960 --> 32:13.960\nObviously.\n\n32:13.960 --> 32:14.960\nYeah.\n\n32:14.960 --> 32:22.160\nAre there live venues that make you more nervous or that you hate doing?\n\n32:22.160 --> 32:23.920\nEveryone is like a totally different experience.\n\n32:23.920 --> 32:29.440\nThere's some that are bigger and sometimes they're fuller than others and sometimes they're\n\n32:29.440 --> 32:34.760\nkind of empty for big places and that's kind of weird, but I don't think there's anything\n\n32:34.760 --> 32:39.120\nreally that makes me more nervous than anything else except for, I guess, sometimes when you're\n\n32:39.120 --> 32:45.320\nin that environment where you've got people who you care about watching and then you're\n\n32:45.320 --> 32:47.000\nreally, it's really on your mind.\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:48.840\nLike family or friends or both?\n\n32:48.840 --> 32:52.280\nOh yeah, like family and friends and you're like, oh shit, I can't believe I wrote this\n\n32:52.280 --> 32:56.800\nline into the song and then you just kind of jump over it weirdly and that kind of thing.\n\n32:56.800 --> 33:00.680\nSo when people, how do you explain to your family, does your family kind of bust your\n\n33:00.680 --> 33:07.960\nballs like when they're like, so what do you do and you're like, is it hard to say I'm\n\n33:07.960 --> 33:09.960\na rapper?\n\n33:09.960 --> 33:10.960\nSometimes.\n\n33:10.960 --> 33:11.960\nThey support me generally.\n\n33:11.960 --> 33:13.400\nI mean, we're all a little weird, I guess.\n\n33:13.400 --> 33:18.760\nMy dad is a piano technician and my sister is, she builds MOOCs synthesizers and she's\n\n33:18.760 --> 33:20.560\nstudying for that.\n\n33:20.560 --> 33:26.560\nSo they really support me when I decided I was going to take the music route because\n\n33:26.560 --> 33:31.200\nI've been working in film all this time and that was like also a little weird for some\n\n33:31.200 --> 33:34.640\nof the people who I grew up with, they're like, oh, it's like a creative field and you're\n\n33:34.640 --> 33:38.520\nnever going to make it in film, but you know, here we are, so.\n\n33:38.520 --> 33:42.360\nWe have another mutual friend, Open Mike Eagle, who was on the show a couple months ago and\n\n33:42.360 --> 33:43.360\nyou know him too.\n\n33:43.360 --> 33:49.520\nThat's what we discovered over dinner and so I just wanted to drop that.\n\n33:49.520 --> 33:51.000\nYou need to respect me as an interviewer.\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:52.000\nOh yeah, I do.\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:53.000\nI know Open Mike Eagle.\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:55.520\nI will close this mic and turn it into a falcon.\n\n33:55.520 --> 33:56.520\nI'm dumb, so dumb.\n\n33:56.520 --> 33:58.920\nI'm like, wait, I'll yank a bit now.\n\n33:58.920 --> 33:59.920\nBut he's fine.\n\n33:59.920 --> 34:01.320\nWhy am I shitting on him?\n\n34:01.320 --> 34:05.680\nAll right, so how did you get involved in rap?\n\n34:05.680 --> 34:06.760\nHow did you get interested in it?\n\n34:06.760 --> 34:07.760\nWhat drew you to it?\n\n34:07.760 --> 34:11.680\nYou said your primary interest was film, so then take us to the threshold in your biopic\n\n34:11.680 --> 34:13.360\nwhere you're like, I'm a rap.\n\n34:13.360 --> 34:18.200\nWell, I've always written poetry since I was a little kid and then I started to go through\n\n34:18.200 --> 34:25.000\nthis phase in 2010, 2011, where if I would get mad at work, I would just be like, oh\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:30.160\nyeah, well, I'm going to write a poem and I would do that.\n\n34:30.160 --> 34:36.160\nAnd I wouldn't share them with anybody, but eventually somebody showed me hip hop music\n\n34:36.160 --> 34:41.400\nand then I was able to take these secret poems I was writing and stitch them over beats and\n\n34:41.400 --> 34:44.400\nthen make something really awesome.\n\n34:44.400 --> 34:49.800\nAnd I put out a music video once and it got a lot of attention kind of right away.\n\n34:49.800 --> 34:55.960\nAnd so someone called me and asked me to come and screen that video at this event that he\n\n34:55.960 --> 34:59.400\nwas throwing at O'Brien's in Santa Monica.\n\n34:59.400 --> 35:02.320\nAnd I was like, I'm not going to screen that shitty video.\n\n35:02.320 --> 35:05.240\nIt's not happening, but I'll do a 30 minute set.\n\n35:05.240 --> 35:07.400\nAnd he was like, all right, that's great, cool, booked.\n\n35:07.400 --> 35:11.120\nTwo months later, I had to write that music because I didn't have any.\n\n35:11.120 --> 35:12.120\nBut I put it together.\n\n35:12.120 --> 35:13.120\nIt made it happen.\n\n35:13.120 --> 35:15.200\nI think that's how the good people have their friends.\n\n35:15.200 --> 35:18.760\nIf you know, just like somehow your ego like makes you say you're going to do something\n\n35:18.760 --> 35:25.360\nlike that's what Channel 101 was for filmmakers when we were starting it in 2003, God, whatever.\n\n35:25.360 --> 35:30.560\nIt was like Schrab and I knew if we don't have an appointment like where everyone's\n\n35:30.560 --> 35:34.760\ngoing to either know that we suck because we didn't finish something or we have something,\n\n35:34.760 --> 35:35.760\nlike that's there.\n\n35:35.760 --> 35:36.760\nYeah, whatever.\n\n35:36.760 --> 35:37.760\nWhy am I explaining this to you?\n\n35:37.760 --> 35:38.760\nI totally agree.\n\n35:38.760 --> 35:41.240\nDo you make your own beats or do you have people that you work with?\n\n35:41.240 --> 35:42.240\nI work with people.\n\n35:42.240 --> 35:43.240\nBeat people.\n\n35:43.240 --> 35:44.880\nI have beat people.\n\n35:44.880 --> 35:48.440\nI have a friend in New Orleans who I met when I was working on a job over there.\n\n35:48.440 --> 35:49.600\nHis name is Raddy Skirvix.\n\n35:49.600 --> 35:53.040\nHe produced my full album, my first album which I put out in November.\n\n35:53.040 --> 35:55.000\nIt's called Cloud Nine.\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.480\nAnd then I have another producer who I work with regularly.\n\n35:57.480 --> 36:00.640\nHis name is DJ Bless One and he lives in El Paso.\n\n36:00.640 --> 36:03.960\nSo sometimes when I'm crossing the country to tour, I'll like stop with Raddy and we'll\n\n36:03.960 --> 36:07.800\nmake a song and then I'll stop with Bless and we'll make a song and then, you know, wherever\n\n36:07.800 --> 36:09.280\nI can do that.\n\n36:09.280 --> 36:12.760\nWho was the first, I know you had like kind of a mentor character you were telling me\n\n36:12.760 --> 36:13.920\nabout when we were talking.\n\n36:13.920 --> 36:22.840\nBut then also, like who just popped culturally, like who was the rap artist that kind of,\n\n36:22.840 --> 36:28.800\nlike I don't know, like you're early, I want to, now I really want to do this because I'm\n\n36:28.800 --> 36:31.880\nlistening to this all the time or I don't know, early influence, is that what I'm trying\n\n36:31.880 --> 36:32.880\nto get around to?\n\n36:32.880 --> 36:38.200\nOne of my favorite bands growing up was this Screamo band called Glassjaw and I love them\n\n36:38.200 --> 36:40.720\nuntil the day I die.\n\n36:40.720 --> 36:41.720\nThey're amazing.\n\n36:41.720 --> 36:43.720\nBut anyway, it's a little intense, very different.\n\n36:43.720 --> 36:44.720\nDid you go Screamo?\n\n36:44.720 --> 36:45.720\nScreamo, yeah.\n\n36:45.720 --> 36:46.720\nI'm not familiar with it.\n\n36:46.720 --> 36:47.720\nOh yeah.\n\n36:47.720 --> 36:49.720\nIt's like emo where they scream.\n\n36:49.720 --> 36:53.720\nIt's a surprise to know that I am not familiar with Screamo.\n\n36:53.720 --> 36:54.720\nI feel like you might be.\n\n36:54.720 --> 36:58.640\nI mean, you may cause it Screamo fan, but you're there, it's there.\n\n36:58.640 --> 36:59.640\nI just don't know what it is.\n\n36:59.640 --> 37:01.640\nIt might be my new favorite thing.\n\n37:01.640 --> 37:04.640\nWhat's a Screamo band?\n\n37:04.640 --> 37:08.800\nWell, they'll sing and they'll have their heavy guitars and it's like kind of a, I don't\n\n37:08.800 --> 37:13.600\nknow, like an indie hardcore music genre, but then they scream at the top of their lungs\n\n37:13.600 --> 37:17.520\nlike, and it's beautiful.\n\n37:17.520 --> 37:19.520\nIf I scream once, I lose my voice for a month.\n\n37:19.520 --> 37:20.520\nRight, me too.\n\n37:20.520 --> 37:21.520\nIt's art.\n\n37:21.520 --> 37:22.520\nWhat they do is craft.\n\n37:22.520 --> 37:24.960\nThe people that can scream, they do that all the time.\n\n37:24.960 --> 37:29.600\nNight after night song, like do a two hour set, night after night on a tour, like yeah,\n\n37:29.600 --> 37:30.600\nthat is a craft.\n\n37:30.600 --> 37:32.000\nThere is something in there happening.\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:35.080\nBut are these, is Screamo rapping when Screamo?\n\n37:35.080 --> 37:36.080\nNo.\n\n37:36.080 --> 37:37.080\nSo there was a singer.\n\n37:37.080 --> 37:38.080\nHis singer's name is...\n\n37:38.080 --> 37:40.080\nDamn, don't embarrass yourself.\n\n37:40.080 --> 37:44.360\nWell, I mean, anybody can rap, you know, like I think probably one of the first raps that\n\n37:44.360 --> 37:50.040\nI learned was like in a Rancid song, you know, without even realizing that that was rap.\n\n37:50.040 --> 37:53.800\nI just like really like the fast chop of it and I wanted to learn it.\n\n37:53.800 --> 37:58.560\nAnd then, but anyway, the singer of Glassjaw, his name is Darryl Palumbo and he did a hook\n\n37:58.560 --> 38:01.320\nfor an artist named Cage.\n\n38:01.320 --> 38:06.240\nAnd Cage was out of New York and I listened to that album to hear that hook, like that\n\n38:06.240 --> 38:07.240\npart where he sings.\n\n38:07.240 --> 38:10.640\nAnd I heard the whole album and I bought it and now I have it and I grew up with it,\n\n38:10.640 --> 38:11.840\nyou know, because of that.\n\n38:11.840 --> 38:17.400\nSo like I kind of let like people who I'm, you know, love and I'm following like to bring\n\n38:17.400 --> 38:22.760\nme to my next kind of like bubble to explore in and then to the next thing.\n\n38:22.760 --> 38:23.760\nSo yeah.\n\n38:23.760 --> 38:28.640\nWell, here comes the part where I show you that I'm bad at what I do and I don't mean\n\n38:28.640 --> 38:30.600\nrapping, which I will blow your mind with later.\n\n38:30.600 --> 38:32.520\nYes, you will.\n\n38:32.520 --> 38:37.640\nBut it will blow my mind if we can just do this like willy-nilly, but you did bring\n\n38:37.640 --> 38:39.720\nlike a thumb drive of Beats, didn't you?\n\n38:39.720 --> 38:44.000\nAnd do we, are we, would you mind like doing like, what would you like most, what would\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:45.000\nyou be following your bliss?\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:48.800\nDo you want to just do one of your numbers?\n\n38:48.800 --> 38:51.000\nI sound like your dad.\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:58.480\nCan you spend some of your wax for us?\n\n38:58.480 --> 38:59.480\nOr whatever.\n\n38:59.480 --> 39:02.560\nI mean, what's your preference to do like, or?\n\n39:02.560 --> 39:07.600\nI mean, I brought four different songs with me to perform, but I don't expect to be able\n\n39:07.600 --> 39:08.800\nto have time to do all of them.\n\n39:08.800 --> 39:10.200\nSo I mean, I can do whatever.\n\n39:10.200 --> 39:11.200\nYeah.\n\n39:11.200 --> 39:12.200\nI could like spit one.\n\n39:12.200 --> 39:14.720\nNo, I think like you should, you should do one that's like, all right.\n\n39:14.720 --> 39:17.400\nWell, here, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll dance, explain what you should do then.\n\n39:17.400 --> 39:23.020\nWhat if you, if unless, unless there's something that would make you happier, do one that's\n\n39:23.020 --> 39:25.840\njust like your thing that you do.\n\n39:25.840 --> 39:28.560\nAnd then, and then we'll talk a little more because there was like this, you just came\n\n39:28.560 --> 39:33.280\nback from Burning Man and I want to talk about that thing, the not Burning Man, but the other\n\n39:33.280 --> 39:34.280\nthing.\n\n39:34.280 --> 39:42.760\nBut, but, and, and then, and then at a certain point, obviously I'm going to get some like\n\n39:42.760 --> 39:46.680\nopen mic eagle taught me like lessons about my freestyling.\n\n39:46.680 --> 39:47.680\nI want those lessons.\n\n39:47.680 --> 39:51.320\nWell, I'll give you his lessons, but then I need more from you because I didn't come\n\n39:51.320 --> 39:52.320\nhere for nothing.\n\n39:52.320 --> 39:54.240\nDo I call you B Squid or do I call you by your, your first name?\n\n39:54.240 --> 39:58.080\nYou can call me B Squid or Squid or Allie because that's also my name.\n\n39:58.080 --> 39:59.080\nYeah.\n\n39:59.080 --> 40:00.080\nAll right.\n\n40:00.080 --> 40:01.080\nSo Squid.\n\n40:01.080 --> 40:02.080\nWhat if it was Agnes?\n\n40:02.080 --> 40:03.080\nYes.\n\n40:03.080 --> 40:04.080\nThen it would be amazing.\n\n40:04.080 --> 40:06.480\nObviously Agnes would be the greatest name of all time.\n\n40:06.480 --> 40:07.480\nI know.\n\n40:07.480 --> 40:08.480\nAgnes.\n\n40:08.480 --> 40:09.480\nYeah.\n\n40:09.480 --> 40:10.480\nGo Agnes.\n\n40:10.480 --> 40:12.320\nLike my, my, my riff of what a, what a, what a sad name would be.\n\n40:12.320 --> 40:15.600\nIt's like, like, yeah, no, that would be cool because that's, I'm 44.\n\n40:15.600 --> 40:17.960\nBut Squid, are you, are you a comfortable freestyler?\n\n40:17.960 --> 40:18.960\nDo you like that?\n\n40:18.960 --> 40:19.960\nOr do you, is that something you enjoy?\n\n40:19.960 --> 40:21.320\nUh, it's something I enjoy.\n\n40:21.320 --> 40:24.160\nI actually haven't broken my public freestyling cherry.\n\n40:24.160 --> 40:25.160\nSo that would be a thing.\n\n40:25.160 --> 40:28.240\nWell, the bar is incredibly low here.\n\n40:28.240 --> 40:31.680\nYou're going to be the Babe Ruth of freestyling here.\n\n40:31.680 --> 40:32.680\nNice.\n\n40:32.680 --> 40:35.920\nBut I think first let's, you know, like, let's, let's, let's, let's warm up with\n\n40:35.920 --> 40:39.680\njust a, like one of your, how do you, how do you tell them what to play though if you\n\n40:39.680 --> 40:41.760\nwanted to just do one of your set things?\n\n40:41.760 --> 40:43.680\nI want to do a thousand winters.\n\n40:43.680 --> 40:44.680\nFantastic.\n\n40:44.680 --> 40:46.600\nIt was the one I said I wasn't going to do.\n\n40:46.600 --> 40:48.760\nZach, you up, you up on that, Zach?\n\n40:48.760 --> 40:50.760\nAll right.\n\n40:50.760 --> 40:58.320\nIt's, we don't, you know, we don't always do this.\n\n40:58.320 --> 41:01.320\nIt's worth the wait.\n\n41:01.320 --> 41:04.840\nShould I like stand up?\n\n41:04.840 --> 41:05.840\nYeah.\n\n41:05.840 --> 41:06.840\nMake it show biz.\n\n41:06.840 --> 41:13.360\nWhat about a lighting, a lighting effect that's a little less butcher shop?\n\n41:13.360 --> 41:20.360\nIf it takes forever, I will wait for you\n\n41:20.360 --> 41:27.360\nFor a thousand winters, I will wait for you\n\n41:27.360 --> 41:31.360\nTill you're here beside me\n\n41:31.360 --> 41:35.360\nTill I'm holding you\n\n41:35.360 --> 41:38.360\nTill I hear you sigh\n\n41:38.360 --> 41:43.360\nHere in my eyes\n\n41:43.360 --> 41:47.360\nBecause I know you're weeding too, and all my thoughts involve you\n\n41:47.360 --> 41:51.360\nDon't tell me what I cannot do, for in my own good I'll wait for you\n\n41:51.360 --> 41:54.360\nI'm searching time and watching close for all the signals, coast to coast\n\n41:54.360 --> 41:58.360\nClouds are painting tentacles, compass pointing where to go\n\n41:58.360 --> 42:01.360\nEast into the sunrise, cause I try and try to land in time\n\n42:01.360 --> 42:05.360\nTo sandy a time like paper with some grit, unleash a shine\n\n42:05.360 --> 42:09.360\nWith blue balloons I float to you, where I will grow out of these boots\n\n42:09.360 --> 42:13.360\nAnd if you leave and travel on, my heart will follow with a song\n\n42:13.360 --> 42:16.360\nYou can take my magic wand, repeat these spells across the pond\n\n42:16.360 --> 42:20.360\nOne week flies by like Dumbo did, they thought he'd fall, but he learned to live\n\n42:20.360 --> 42:24.360\nOf all the hearts this world will bring, I hope each one enlightens me\n\n42:24.360 --> 42:28.360\nSo in your presence I am free to gift you with eternity\n\n42:28.360 --> 42:31.360\nLighter than a feather, I am stricken, like a match\n\n42:31.360 --> 42:35.360\nYou and me expand to fill the space and plug the gaps\n\n42:35.360 --> 42:38.360\nI miss you, need you, want you bad, and while we wait we may go mad\n\n42:38.360 --> 42:42.360\nBut I'll be there when leaves turn brown, and I'll be singing you this song\n\n42:42.360 --> 42:46.360\nDreaming daylight, think of me, I'm always somewhere you could be\n\n42:46.360 --> 42:50.360\nFeeding every harmony with hearts of possibility\n\n42:50.360 --> 43:03.360\nIf it takes forever, I will wait for you\n\n43:03.360 --> 43:10.360\nFor a thousand winters, I will wait for you\n\n43:10.360 --> 43:18.360\nTill you're here beside me, till I'm holding you\n\n43:18.360 --> 43:25.360\nTill I hear you sigh, hear in my arms\n\n43:25.360 --> 43:33.360\nIf it takes forever, I will wait for you\n\n43:33.360 --> 43:40.360\nFor a thousand winters, I will wait for you\n\n43:40.360 --> 43:48.360\nTill you're here beside me, till I'm holding you\n\n43:48.360 --> 43:55.360\nTill I hear you sigh, hear in my arms\n\n43:55.360 --> 43:59.360\nAnywhere you wonder, anywhere you go\n\n43:59.360 --> 44:03.360\nEvery day remember, I adore you so\n\n44:03.360 --> 44:09.360\nIn your heart, believe what in my heart I know that forevermore\n\n44:09.360 --> 44:15.360\nI'll wait for you\n\n44:25.360 --> 44:27.360\nHell yeah\n\n44:27.360 --> 44:28.360\nB-Squid!\n\n44:28.360 --> 44:30.360\nB-Squid.\n\n44:30.360 --> 44:31.360\nThank you guys.\n\n44:31.360 --> 44:37.360\nI was mortified in the beginning because there wasn't enough monitor or something.\n\n44:37.360 --> 44:40.360\nI couldn't really hear the beat, but then I kind of got it anyway.\n\n44:40.360 --> 44:42.360\nYeah, you had to squat it.\n\n44:42.360 --> 44:45.360\nYeah, if we do more, Zach, can we get more of the sound in the monitor?\n\n44:45.360 --> 44:47.360\nWhen I'm up...\n\n44:47.360 --> 44:49.360\nI kind of want to see...\n\n44:49.360 --> 44:50.360\nHe happens sometimes.\n\n44:50.360 --> 44:52.360\nI'll stop the show.\n\n44:52.360 --> 44:58.360\nI was kind of thinking maybe we could experiment where either we play that same beat again and Dan tries to...\n\n44:58.360 --> 45:00.360\nWell, I think I got it, yeah.\n\n45:00.360 --> 45:02.360\nOkay, so let's put...\n\n45:02.360 --> 45:07.360\nBut I also want to hear that...\n\n45:07.360 --> 45:10.360\nI want to hear that singer-songwriter hook stuff, too.\n\n45:10.360 --> 45:11.360\nYes, the song.\n\n45:11.360 --> 45:12.360\nNo, I think I got it, I got it.\n\n45:12.360 --> 45:13.360\nOkay.\n\n45:19.360 --> 45:21.360\nLet's give it up for P-Squid.\n\n45:23.360 --> 45:25.360\nHe pees on squids.\n\n45:25.360 --> 45:33.360\nThere are a thousand winters\n\n45:33.360 --> 45:37.360\nI wait for you\n\n45:37.360 --> 45:41.360\nI'll have no splinters\n\n45:41.360 --> 45:45.360\nInside my shoe\n\n45:45.360 --> 45:48.360\nA thousand winters\n\n45:48.360 --> 45:52.360\nAnd a half a dozen falls\n\n45:52.360 --> 45:55.360\nWent to my friend's house\n\n45:55.360 --> 45:59.360\nAnd I can't take it all\n\n45:59.360 --> 46:01.360\nYo, I'm sick of this shit, I'm sick of society's shit\n\n46:01.360 --> 46:03.360\nI'm so sick of it, I'm going to sit on it\n\n46:03.360 --> 46:05.360\nI'm going to take my ass and put it down on it\n\n46:05.360 --> 46:08.360\nI can't fucking hear it, god damn it\n\n46:08.360 --> 46:10.360\nDon't fuck with me\n\n46:10.360 --> 46:12.360\nFuck, fuck, fuck\n\n46:12.360 --> 46:14.360\nNo one's in the street\n\n46:14.360 --> 46:16.360\nI saw everyone's feet\n\n46:16.360 --> 46:18.360\nI went up to the sky\n\n46:18.360 --> 46:21.360\nI can't fucking hear\n\n46:21.360 --> 46:23.360\nThe beat\n\n46:23.360 --> 46:25.360\nPiece of shit\n\n46:25.360 --> 46:28.360\nThere are a thousand falls\n\n46:28.360 --> 46:30.360\nI'm sick of this shit\n\n46:30.360 --> 46:32.360\nI'm going to put it on a hat\n\n46:32.360 --> 46:34.360\nI'm going to put it back on my head\n\n46:34.360 --> 46:36.360\nBecause I've got a zit\n\n46:36.360 --> 46:38.360\nWent into my car, went fire\n\n46:38.360 --> 46:40.360\nI drove to the moon and ate some tar\n\n46:40.360 --> 46:43.360\nIt burned me, it burned my ass\n\n46:43.360 --> 46:47.360\nI got too fast when you rap too fast\n\n46:47.360 --> 46:50.360\nYou can't improvise when you rap too fast\n\n46:50.360 --> 46:55.360\nThere's no such thing as rapping that fast\n\n46:55.360 --> 46:58.360\nWhen you improvise\n\n46:58.360 --> 47:00.360\nI saw your mama the other day\n\n47:00.360 --> 47:02.360\nShe looked at me and asked if I was gay\n\n47:02.360 --> 47:05.360\nI said, I don't have that honor, bitch\n\n47:05.360 --> 47:07.360\nMom's closed minded, she's homophobic\n\n47:07.360 --> 47:09.360\nI went down the street and got on a telephone\n\n47:09.360 --> 47:12.360\nWhy is there still a telephone on the street?\n\n47:14.360 --> 47:16.360\nBecause I'm a time traveler\n\n47:16.360 --> 47:19.360\nMy dad is Dan Rather\n\n47:19.360 --> 47:22.360\nPlayed by Robert Redford in the movie Truth\n\n47:22.360 --> 47:24.360\nHave you heard about that?\n\n47:24.360 --> 47:28.360\nIt's about the thing about George Bush's military service\n\n47:34.360 --> 47:37.360\nFor a thousand winters\n\n47:37.360 --> 47:40.360\nWhat, what, what, thousand days\n\n47:40.360 --> 47:45.360\nWhat, what, what, for a thousand million calendars\n\n47:45.360 --> 47:49.360\nWhat, what, what, I've seen a purple hair\n\n47:49.360 --> 47:51.360\nTell you what about that\n\n47:51.360 --> 47:52.360\nFuck, mother cat\n\n47:52.360 --> 47:53.360\nFuck you, darn two\n\n47:53.360 --> 47:54.360\nThat a rat\n\n47:54.360 --> 47:56.360\nPut them all together in a jar\n\n47:56.360 --> 47:57.360\nThrough the shit, says\n\n47:57.360 --> 47:58.360\nFuck it\n\n48:04.360 --> 48:07.360\nFor a thirty-five\n\n48:07.360 --> 48:08.360\nSprings\n\n48:12.360 --> 48:13.360\nI saw you the other day\n\n48:13.360 --> 48:17.560\nYou had a tattoo? I broke my heart. What about you? I haven't seen you in ten years.\n\n48:17.560 --> 48:22.080\nWhat's the Facebook status? Why is it still single? You know you got you got\n\n48:22.080 --> 48:27.960\ninto somebody else. Two weeks after we broke up, I sensed overlap. I'm not\n\n48:27.960 --> 48:35.720\nstalking. I sensed overlap. I'm not a Facebook stalker. I'm policing overlap.\n\n48:35.720 --> 48:41.880\nI'm police overlap. Think about that. With your butt flaps. Wrap it up,\n\n48:41.880 --> 48:47.480\nwrap it up, wrap it up. Wrap it up, wrap it up. Think about that.\n\n48:48.320 --> 49:02.200\nFor a thousand winters, it snows so long. I hope my zombie dragon doesn't go to the\n\n49:02.200 --> 49:09.760\nwrong side. I can't. Got you dragging out of ice. You got some chains. Don't know how\n\n49:09.760 --> 49:14.240\nI made them. Police dragging out of ice, brought it back to life, made its eyes blue.\n\n49:14.240 --> 49:17.840\nNow I'm gonna cut like a knife through the wall. The rubble's gonna fall. Then I'm\n\n49:17.840 --> 49:25.480\ngonna walk over it all. I'm gonna go south. Right? I just get that mixed up. South is\n\n49:25.480 --> 49:30.400\nbad? South is like the Korean thing. It's like you can never keep track north of\n\n49:30.400 --> 49:40.960\nwalls, man. Fucking thousand winters. Yo, it's like a thousand winters. Yo, yo. Ain't\n\n49:40.960 --> 49:45.680\nno fucking summer in sight, bitch.\n\n49:45.680 --> 49:52.680\nI like this game.\n\n49:52.680 --> 49:57.680\nI mean, I don't think my version's perfect. We're gonna go to the judges.\n\n49:57.680 --> 50:01.280\nIt brought tears to my eyes a little.\n\n50:01.280 --> 50:07.600\nI don't think mine's perfect, but you had a chance to write yours. I did have the advantage\n\n50:07.600 --> 50:11.440\nof watching yours, so it's even. I think we tied.\n\n50:11.440 --> 50:13.840\nI'd say so.\n\n50:13.840 --> 50:23.240\nBut yeah, so Open Mike Eagle, he divested me. If you wanna know how I got to that level.\n\n50:23.240 --> 50:30.480\nOpen Mike Eagle, he taught me that I don't have to say fuck your mama all the time. Do\n\n50:30.480 --> 50:36.720\nyou have crutches when you freestyle? The phrases that you lean on when you're killing\n\n50:36.720 --> 50:37.720\ntime?\n\n50:37.720 --> 50:38.720\nSometimes.\n\n50:38.720 --> 50:41.160\nDude, what are they?\n\n50:41.160 --> 50:47.880\nI try not to repeat them, but as an exercise. Right now, I guess if we start freestyling,\n\n50:47.880 --> 50:50.160\nI think you'll figure it out.\n\n50:50.160 --> 50:52.240\nYou don't wanna give them power.\n\n50:52.240 --> 50:55.960\nYeah, because they're changing. They change every time I freestyle.\n\n50:55.960 --> 50:59.720\nOh, so if I drop the fuck your mama's, which as soon as Open Mike left, I was like back\n\n50:59.720 --> 51:00.720\non it.\n\n51:00.720 --> 51:03.600\nYeah, it's like the sauce, you know, you gotta take it.\n\n51:03.600 --> 51:07.120\nEverybody was cheering, like he made me not say fuck your mama for like a rap, and it\n\n51:07.120 --> 51:08.120\nwas like...\n\n51:08.120 --> 51:09.120\nYou gotta push yourself.\n\n51:09.120 --> 51:12.560\nEverybody was like, yay, you're learning and growing, and then he left. He's like, I'm\n\n51:12.560 --> 51:17.360\nrich, and I was like, fuck your mama!\n\n51:17.360 --> 51:23.440\nBut yeah, did any of the beats that you brought for freestyling, are they kind of like a little\n\n51:23.440 --> 51:24.440\nslower?\n\n51:24.440 --> 51:30.360\nApparently they're all licensed, but they were slower. So I guess there's other beats\n\n51:30.360 --> 51:31.360\non hand.\n\n51:31.360 --> 51:32.360\nOh, we have some.\n\n51:32.360 --> 51:37.600\nDan, you really push yourself, I mean lyrically, you're pushing yourself to the limit.\n\n51:37.600 --> 51:38.600\nYou move very quickly there.\n\n51:38.600 --> 51:44.600\nYeah, but the Kiki Baby dance was really, really on point tonight. That was some good\n\n51:44.600 --> 51:48.560\nKiki Baby going on there.\n\n51:48.560 --> 51:54.200\nFor me, that song is about the cycle of life.\n\n51:54.200 --> 51:56.240\nMy main takeaway is that you're sick of this shit.\n\n51:56.240 --> 51:57.240\nYeah.\n\n51:57.240 --> 52:04.880\nI think that's the main message, kind of a through line.\n\n52:04.880 --> 52:09.800\nThat's how I perceive, that's like my perception of like a female rapper. Well, she must be\n\n52:09.800 --> 52:10.800\nsick of this shit.\n\n52:10.800 --> 52:17.960\nLike I'm sick of this shit. If anyone's rapping that fast, what else could it be? I don't\n\n52:17.960 --> 52:18.960\nknow.\n\n52:18.960 --> 52:21.000\nI'm just sharing my obstacles.\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:26.000\nSquid, do you think there's any chance, subconsciously, that based on what you just saw, that you\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:28.720\nmight accidentally bite some of Dan's freestyle right?\n\n52:28.720 --> 52:36.240\nI hope I don't. I mean, I would feel really terrible if I did, because I respect you and\n\n52:36.240 --> 52:39.920\nyour freestyles are sacred to that moment.\n\n52:39.920 --> 52:46.880\nIs it lame to use the word lame as a derogatory way, because it's ablest? Okay, starting\n\n52:46.880 --> 52:49.880\nover.\n\n52:49.880 --> 52:50.880\nIs it bad?\n\n52:50.880 --> 52:59.000\nWhat a boring world we've created. I hope Nazis take it over.\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:05.200\nIs it negative to take more than three ibuprofen?\n\n53:05.200 --> 53:09.760\nIs it bad that his beats are so retarded?\n\n53:09.760 --> 53:16.480\nIs it bad to ask? I feel like this is something that journalism does to the female persuasion\n\n53:16.480 --> 53:22.960\nwhen they're like, you know, like to corner you and say, like, what's the state of women\n\n53:22.960 --> 53:28.400\nin rap, like, so that you might, but I don't think anyone's listening to this. So, like,\n\n53:28.400 --> 53:32.280\nif, I mean, I don't know, just like, what's your, do you, do you have any opinions about\n\n53:32.280 --> 53:39.880\nthat, or are you, like, genderblind, like, about rap and go?\n\n53:39.880 --> 53:43.800\nIn case you hadn't noticed, I'm a lady, no hating, just saying they always underpay me\n\n53:43.800 --> 53:47.720\nwhen new lanes are laid in. I'm a laden, gaze changing, windowpane is prayin', new free\n\n53:47.720 --> 53:52.280\nway to playin', escaping, creatin', somethin' missed by education. Labelers are lookin'\n\n53:52.280 --> 53:56.480\nfor your contribution, if laboring, tailoring, or execution, impaling, failure with the loose\n\n53:56.480 --> 54:00.000\nend, goose heads, body running crazy, and a chicken's pen, gotta feel for him, he's for\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:03.080\nhim, to the lore where we're supposed to get bored, eight to four, with chorns of performance,\n\n54:03.080 --> 54:06.840\nstickin' to bird's eye, scored to make the writ, his core, an orb of explorers sentiment,\n\n54:06.840 --> 54:09.880\nspecially to movers and shakers who can't afford you, hulls are dumped by their players,\n\n54:09.880 --> 54:13.480\nthe system regrets to inform him, his mission is canceled, and wish in concussion, discussion\n\n54:13.480 --> 54:16.840\nof structure that he's been disrupting is kept at a minimum, take this chrysanthemum,\n\n54:16.840 --> 54:20.200\nlet's all remember him, in member random, the rebel of random reaction is granted, museum\n\n54:20.200 --> 54:23.440\nin the hall of all fame, a graveyard of hunger, pink, certain in the name of the young and\n\n54:23.440 --> 54:24.440\nashamed.\n\n54:24.440 --> 54:30.160\nSo, all right, I think you're avoiding the question.\n\n54:30.160 --> 54:33.040\nAnswer the fuckin' question.\n\n54:33.040 --> 54:45.440\nSo, that's my, it's actually, I performed that rap, half way through it, did you stop\n\n54:45.440 --> 54:51.000\nlistening to the actual, for the first half I was like, god damn, this is like, my brain\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:55.240\nis growing, it snaps and then the second half is like, what's the bit that I'm gonna do?\n\n54:55.240 --> 54:59.440\nWhich is probably, there's probably the second half of that is like, and they're always\n\n54:59.440 --> 55:01.840\njust thinkin' about what they're gonna say next to me.\n\n55:01.840 --> 55:07.080\nNo, I love, I love being a female and I love doing what I do, I think that, you know, it,\n\n55:07.080 --> 55:09.280\nit's like, you know, the game of, um,\n\n55:09.280 --> 55:10.280\nThrones.\n\n55:10.280 --> 55:11.280\nGuess who?\n\n55:11.280 --> 55:12.280\nYou remember that game, guess who?\n\n55:12.280 --> 55:13.280\nRight?\n\n55:13.280 --> 55:16.560\nWith all the dude's faces, you're like, oh, this one's got, my guy's got glasses, or my\n\n55:16.560 --> 55:20.880\nguy's got a beard, or, my guy's a lady, and you're like, oh, it's one of these\n\n55:20.880 --> 55:21.880\ntwo people.\n\n55:21.880 --> 55:22.880\nOkay.\n\n55:22.880 --> 55:26.440\nSo that's kind of what it feels like, you know, like, not a lot of people get your card,\n\n55:26.440 --> 55:29.240\nbut when they do get your card, it's like, it stands out, you know?\n\n55:29.240 --> 55:30.240\nRight.\n\n55:30.240 --> 55:31.240\nSo that's a good thing.\n\n55:31.240 --> 55:32.240\nSometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad, sometimes it's whatever.\n\n55:32.240 --> 55:33.240\nYeah.\n\n55:33.240 --> 55:34.240\nIt is what it is.\n\n55:34.240 --> 55:35.240\nIt is what it is.\n\n55:35.240 --> 55:39.080\nI'm a strong independent woman, I think, I feel, I try to be anyway, and, uh, and so\n\n55:39.080 --> 55:44.560\nI don't like, really let the industry walk all over me, which is why I'm an independent\n\n55:44.560 --> 55:45.560\nstarring artist.\n\n55:45.560 --> 55:48.960\nBut hey, you know, you gotta do what you gotta do in this life.\n\n55:48.960 --> 55:53.680\nNow you, you rocking that Los Feliz cap, are you a Los Feliz native, or?\n\n55:53.680 --> 55:54.680\nYes, I am.\n\n55:54.680 --> 55:55.680\nWell, not a native, but I, I live there.\n\n55:55.680 --> 55:56.680\nThat's who you live in.\n\n55:56.680 --> 55:57.680\nThat's where I live.\n\n55:57.680 --> 55:58.680\nAll right.\n\n55:58.680 --> 55:59.680\nThat's my hometown.\n\n55:59.680 --> 56:00.680\nYeah.\n\n56:00.680 --> 56:01.680\nDan's hometown.\n\n56:01.680 --> 56:05.200\nJust to get grim for a second, because it's kind of just historically grim, like, you\n\n56:05.200 --> 56:10.480\nwere just a burning man, and I've never been, and, uh, you've been there many, many times\n\n56:10.480 --> 56:11.480\nlately.\n\n56:11.480 --> 56:12.480\nSeven times.\n\n56:12.480 --> 56:17.880\nUh, this, I, and then we're like, you're talking about the heat, and I was like, and\n\n56:17.880 --> 56:21.720\nthen the obvious dumb joke is I was like, yeah, it was a literal, literal burning man.\n\n56:21.720 --> 56:25.920\nThere were burning men there, and then you're like, no, there was one because this fucking\n\n56:25.920 --> 56:26.920\nthing happened.\n\n56:26.920 --> 56:32.400\nI don't know how many of you heard about this, like, it's probably easy to, to miss\n\n56:32.400 --> 56:33.400\nnews these days.\n\n56:33.400 --> 56:37.320\nLike, like, but, but do you, I mean, should I, should I say what happened and then you\n\n56:37.320 --> 56:38.320\ntalk about it?\n\n56:38.320 --> 56:40.240\nLike, or, or do you want to just take it from there?\n\n56:40.240 --> 56:44.880\nUm, well, I was there, uh, and I was sitting kind of like on a, like on the, I want to\n\n56:44.880 --> 56:50.720\nsay the three o'clock side, maybe, and from where I was, I wasn't able to see occur at\n\n56:50.720 --> 56:51.720\nthe fire.\n\n56:51.720 --> 56:55.280\nBut, um, when the man was burning this year on Saturday night, there was a guy, and his\n\n56:55.280 --> 57:00.600\nname was Aaron Joel Mitchell, and he ran into the fire, um, and committed suicide.\n\n57:00.600 --> 57:03.520\nAnd that was actually really, like a really sad thing I didn't find out about until the\n\n57:03.520 --> 57:04.520\nnext morning.\n\n57:04.520 --> 57:07.280\nUm, you said he was in there for 30 minutes.\n\n57:07.280 --> 57:08.280\nLike 30 seconds.\n\n57:08.280 --> 57:09.280\nOh, 30 seconds.\n\n57:09.280 --> 57:10.280\n30 minutes.\n\n57:10.280 --> 57:11.280\nOkay.\n\n57:11.280 --> 57:12.280\nYou know what?\n\n57:12.280 --> 57:13.280\nStill too long.\n\n57:13.280 --> 57:14.280\nStill too long.\n\n57:14.280 --> 57:15.280\nI'm sorry.\n\n57:15.280 --> 57:16.280\nI, I know nothing about this.\n\n57:16.280 --> 57:20.840\nI was wondering about, there was a guy, a guy just like ran into the fire, but he, to,\n\n57:20.840 --> 57:24.800\nto self-emolate and, and, and kill himself by fire at Burning Man.\n\n57:24.800 --> 57:26.760\nI mean, nobody knows why he did it.\n\n57:26.760 --> 57:27.760\nOh really?\n\n57:27.760 --> 57:30.960\nNobody knows if he was on drugs or they know he wasn't drunk.\n\n57:30.960 --> 57:36.640\nUm, they know that he had been sober previously and that he was like a, a beaming, gentle\n\n57:36.640 --> 57:41.600\nsoul and, um, and that, you know, you can, nobody can really speak on why he did it.\n\n57:41.600 --> 57:45.840\nCause they think it's a sign of the times that I immediately was like, I don't, I won't\n\n57:45.840 --> 57:49.080\nbe surprised if I find out this isn't the case, but the first thought in my head is\n\n57:49.080 --> 57:51.840\nI wonder if this guy is just like, fuck it.\n\n57:51.840 --> 57:52.840\nThis is it.\n\n57:52.840 --> 57:59.200\nLike, like, like this point in history, like, and it's whether or not it, it often these\n\n57:59.200 --> 58:04.680\nthings aren't, they're not sometimes a cigar is a cigar and like who knows why he did it.\n\n58:04.680 --> 58:07.840\nBut like it's, it's already notable that that was the first thought in my head cause it\n\n58:07.840 --> 58:08.840\nwouldn't have been last year.\n\n58:08.840 --> 58:14.200\nI wouldn't have been like, I bet, I bet he did that because, because the world is ending.\n\n58:14.200 --> 58:22.040\nLike, it's, so it's like, but the other crazy thing is that is realizing that you were there\n\n58:22.040 --> 58:28.360\nthe entire time you were on one side of a fire with a guy that ran into it and basically\n\n58:28.360 --> 58:29.360\nnever came out.\n\n58:29.360 --> 58:33.320\nI mean, they fetched him out and then he died in the hospital, um, but you didn't find out\n\n58:33.320 --> 58:37.640\nabout it till the next day and I was like, okay, so I need to recalibrate my definition\n\n58:37.640 --> 58:44.520\nof what a large fire is because like, I've never been a burning man of like, how many\n\n58:44.520 --> 58:48.000\npeople are gathered around the actual burning man?\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:52.440\nThey say there's like, there were like 50,000 people there and so there's like a whole perimeter\n\n58:52.440 --> 58:57.240\nof like party buses and art cars that kind of like surrounded and then within that, between\n\n58:57.240 --> 59:03.200\nthat perimeter and then there's like a perimeter of, um, you know, Rangers like making sure\n\n59:03.200 --> 59:09.000\nnobody runs into fucking fire, um, in between that is where everybody sits and stands and\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:12.000\nyou know, it's a beautiful fire show.\n\n59:12.000 --> 59:14.480\nThere's like this whole procession beforehand.\n\n59:14.480 --> 59:18.000\nIt's like very ceremonious, you know, they've been doing it, I think like 30 years.\n\n59:18.000 --> 59:24.240\nAnd then there's, um, fireworks, the best damn fire, fireworks show you'll ever see\n\n59:24.240 --> 59:30.840\nthat burn, um, and then, uh, and then the fire and fire was like insane this year.\n\n59:30.840 --> 59:31.840\nLike it was insane.\n\n59:31.840 --> 59:36.400\nIt was kind of like a structure around the man and the man was like in the center of\n\n59:36.400 --> 59:37.400\nit.\n\n59:37.400 --> 59:41.160\nUsually he's like up on a post or like up somehow, but this year the theme was radical\n\n59:41.160 --> 59:42.160\nrituals.\n\n59:42.160 --> 59:48.000\nSo what they did was they made the, the man almost looked like the traditional temple\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:49.360\nthat is at Burning Man as well.\n\n59:49.360 --> 59:54.440\nSo there was like kind of a secondary, it was, it was a really spiritual year, um, at\n\n59:54.440 --> 59:55.440\nBurning Man.\n\n59:55.440 --> 59:57.400\nEverything was built like it was a shrine of some kind.\n\n59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.520\nSo I mean, there's like cynical dots I'm connecting here, what you're describing.\n\n01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:05.520\nSo this year they tried something different where they had like an injury way on the fire.\n\n01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:11.640\nI mean, they kind of designed it like a place you could go into.\n\n01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:12.640\nI guess so.\n\n01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:18.600\nI mean, it's just, this guy broke through the lines of marshals and people there and\n\n01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:25.520\nmade it, made it through and thrust himself into the fire and they got him out like half\n\n01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.520\nalive.\n\n01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:30.720\nThey got him out like after 30 seconds and they, you know, flew him to safety, but he\n\n01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:31.720\ndid.\n\n01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:32.720\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.720\nIt's really sad.\n\n01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:34.720\nYeah.\n\n01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:38.200\nI mean, that's, but we don't know why if, if that was a moment of passion or something\n\n01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.280\nhe'd been planning on or no idea.\n\n01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:41.280\nYeah.\n\n01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.280\nWow.\n\n01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:43.280\nHe apparently didn't leave a note or anything.\n\n01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.960\nWhat was the reaction after that happened?\n\n01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:48.000\nLike did, how much of that crowd, because the whole crowd couldn't possibly have seen\n\n01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000\nall that maybe, right?\n\n01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.880\nI mean, I remember hearing like sound come from the other side.\n\n01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:57.880\nLike sometimes the, the whole crowd like, you know, sparks up some kind of like chant\n\n01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:03.760\nor cheer or like wave of howling at the moon or like, or somebody's like calling for their\n\n01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.760\nfriend, Sarah.\n\n01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.760\nAnd they're like, Sarah.\n\n01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:10.160\nAnd then the whole crowd is screaming Sarah, Sarah's fucking found or something.\n\n01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:14.280\nBut I mean, like you, you could hear something was happening on the other side, but I, I\n\n01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:15.280\nmean,\n\n01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:19.280\nAnd you've done that seven times in a row, like been kind of there at the fire.\n\n01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:24.640\nAnd so yeah, and you, you, you look back and go, Oh yeah, something happened, but something's\n\n01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.640\nalways happening.\n\n01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:33.160\nAnd I mean, that, that is such a, that's such a weird, crazy metaphor for if I end that\n\n01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:38.000\nsentence with life, I devalue my observation because this sounds dumb, that's such a metaphor\n\n01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000\nfor life.\n\n01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.520\nBut, but it is, I mean, you can't say that's a metaphor for society.\n\n01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:44.880\nYou can't say, that is, that is what life is.\n\n01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:49.120\nThat's great that we're all gathered together and that there is tragedy happening.\n\n01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:53.720\nThat, that from a distance, from the other side of the, of the fire, which is the greatest\n\n01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:54.720\nthing that's ever happened.\n\n01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:59.720\nAnd that's like, there can be a person and, and, and, and it can be mistaken from certain\n\n01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:06.480\nperspectives for just another part of a celebration and then the next day, it's like, yeah, dude,\n\n01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:14.040\nman, it's like, like, like, unrelated to that because I don't want to follow up that story\n\n01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.160\nwith like, I want to go to Burning Man at this point.\n\n01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:23.320\nI, I, but, but it's like, at this point, yeah, after the, the aftermath of the election\n\n01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:27.920\nand stuff, it's like, my mind and soul are shambles of, of white fragile shards, like\n\n01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:30.040\nI bought a gun.\n\n01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:33.760\nI'm like, I'm planning on just doomsday prepping in a desert.\n\n01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:37.280\nI don't know how I'm going to die of thirst, like digging a hole straight down because\n\n01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.280\nI play Minecraft.\n\n01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:47.120\nI, I, like, like, and, and like, I, so it's, it's, it's like, I look back on like, a 10\n\n01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:53.120\nyear history of using the phrase Burning Man as a comedy writer to like, you know, mean\n\n01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:58.800\nhippie and dippy and whatever, just like, make fun or whatever, like, and, and now it's\n\n01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:02.680\nlike, because of this year, it's like, this is something that I got to go to at some point.\n\n01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:07.000\nYou would definitely obviously recommend it, right, like, like, maybe not to everybody,\n\n01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.360\nbut you, you wouldn't go seven times if you, you weren't getting something out of it.\n\n01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.160\nYou're not like monetizing when you go there.\n\n01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:16.520\nNo, I'm not monetizing at all when I go there in Cognito and nobody, you know, like, I'm\n\n01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:17.520\nnot selling anything there.\n\n01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.520\nOh, you don't even perform there.\n\n01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:19.520\nI do perform there.\n\n01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.520\nI do perform there.\n\n01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:25.640\nI'll perform my songs and my set and, you know, it'll be a lot of fun, but it's not something\n\n01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:29.640\nthat I'm like, banking on or being like, follow my website, you know, it's like, not like\n\n01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.640\nthat.\n\n01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.560\nIt's sharing what you've been working on all, like your art for the year, you know, and\n\n01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:38.000\nbringing that out and making sure that your friends and family and people get to be touched\n\n01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.800\nby it, like, however they can.\n\n01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.040\nBut I definitely recommend going.\n\n01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:44.560\nI think it's an amazing spiritual journey.\n\n01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:50.080\nAnd if you need it for, you know, it can really open new windows of perception for anybody\n\n01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.800\nwho goes, really changes the way you see shit.\n\n01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:59.120\nHow do you, I'm sorry, did, how much did that guy's death, like, affect the rest of the proceedings\n\n01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:05.200\nthere or like, did it cast a total pall over it or was, did it kind of move along?\n\n01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.800\nIt was kind of dark.\n\n01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:11.320\nJust from my experience, which I mean, I'm not like on the inner circles of that, of\n\n01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.040\nthe burn and what's going on in there.\n\n01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:17.960\nSo, you know, it, it, the news came to me in passing and it was just like really strange.\n\n01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:22.840\nBut, and a lot of people knew about it, but we're not talking about it, you know, because\n\n01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:27.200\nthey didn't want that dark dismal, like, black stain on their week, you know, but at the\n\n01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:30.400\nsame time, then you go to the temple burn the next night and there's this like gigantic\n\n01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.160\nfence and it's like up around it.\n\n01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:36.720\nAnd I've never seen that before, like a fence and they're like, nobody is jumping in this\n\n01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:37.720\ndamn fire.\n\n01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:43.680\nWhat's the, oh, so wait, so just to, so the, is there a fire multiple nights?\n\n01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:44.680\nUh-huh.\n\n01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:45.680\nOkay.\n\n01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:46.680\nThere's lots of fire.\n\n01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:49.920\nOkay, but there's one, there's, there's the one big burning man that will be where the\n\n01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:50.920\nman burns.\n\n01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.840\nSo like, that's not the end of everything.\n\n01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:56.640\nEveryone doesn't end that and go like, Jesus Christ, I got a PowerPoint tomorrow.\n\n01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:01.080\nOh, somebody does, I think, because people like leave, people leave, but burning like\n\n01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:05.000\nthat Saturday night, that's like the biggest and best party of the week.\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.920\nAnd then Sunday, usually people are like leaving all day and then leaving all night and the\n\n01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:12.600\ntemple burn is like a really quiet and like spiritual experience for people.\n\n01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:15.200\nLike people don't like talk through it, stand up through it.\n\n01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:17.440\nThis is a joke, but also it's probably true.\n\n01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:22.560\nSo it's like Comic-Con, like Sundays, like, yeah, exactly.\n\n01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:23.560\nJust like Comic-Con.\n\n01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:26.800\nLots of costumes, lots of weirdos and freaks.\n\n01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:31.320\nSee, like, I'm not a big fan of major crowds and a lot of dirt.\n\n01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:33.800\nIt seems like a lot of dirt and crowds.\n\n01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:34.800\nIt's like dust, but yeah.\n\n01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:35.800\nDust.\n\n01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:36.800\nIt's pretty dirty.\n\n01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:37.800\nAlso, what was the temperature?\n\n01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:39.320\nBecause it was bloody hot during that time, right?\n\n01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:40.320\nUm, yeah, it was hot.\n\n01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:41.840\nIt was really hot.\n\n01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:42.840\nLike 120?\n\n01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:43.840\nLike, what was it?\n\n01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:44.840\nIt was crazy.\n\n01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:45.840\nI don't know.\n\n01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:46.840\nIt was, it was really hot.\n\n01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:47.840\nIt was like.\n\n01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:48.840\nIt's a dry heat.\n\n01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:49.840\nIt was hot at night too.\n\n01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:52.640\nLike, usually it's like really cold at night, but this year it's like really hot at night.\n\n01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:56.000\nSo, like, you're trying to get dressed to go out at night because at night it's like\n\n01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000\na different place.\n\n01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.960\nIt's like, it's like you're going to, you know, Antarctica for the night or something.\n\n01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:02.960\nJust hanging out in the snow.\n\n01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:06.440\nAnd so you're like, I gotta put on my heaviest shit and my brightest things because it's\n\n01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.440\nlike pitch black.\n\n01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:11.280\nAnd then, so when the nights would roll around, I'd be like, is it a pants night?\n\n01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.760\nShould I put a shirt on?\n\n01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.720\nWhat do I do here?\n\n01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:15.720\nEvery night's a pants night.\n\n01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:16.720\nGive me a beat.\n\n01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:17.720\nYeah.\n\n01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:20.600\nDo we have a beat?\n\n01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:25.560\nDo you guys do like a duet, like maybe kick it back and forth freestyle?\n\n01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:28.640\nThat's why I wanted like kind of a lazy beat, like something that could be a little more\n\n01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:29.640\nnostalgic.\n\n01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:30.640\nSomething kind of on the mellow tip.\n\n01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:31.640\nZach, you got that?\n\n01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:32.640\nAll right.\n\n01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:33.640\nYo.\n\n01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:39.840\nIt's one minute away from 9-Eleven, but we're going to wrap right through this.\n\n01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:48.760\nEvery night's a pants night for all you wondering what should be on your legs, if you think\n\n01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:49.760\nshorts.\n\n01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:50.760\nYeah.\n\n01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:51.760\nThink again.\n\n01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.760\nOh shit.\n\n01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:53.760\nYo.\n\n01:06:53.760 --> 01:07:02.520\nI see you walking away from me with your feet.\n\n01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:09.920\nI wonder what's down the street that's for you and not for me that we should separate\n\n01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:10.920\nlike this.\n\n01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:13.520\nIt hurts me.\n\n01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:25.680\nI rhymed me with me and then I took a pee into a jar and drank it.\n\n01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:30.680\nWhy don't you go?\n\n01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:31.680\nOkay.\n\n01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:32.680\nTonight I'm walking with pants on.\n\n01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:34.360\nI'm doing a little dance.\n\n01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:40.000\nI'm kicking babies like I was scoutastic and it was romance on the stage with the people\n\n01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.520\nwho were looking at me.\n\n01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:46.520\nIt's nice to meet a love you, my name is Squid, Squiddy B. No, it's not like that.\n\n01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:48.400\nIt's the other way around.\n\n01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:49.400\nBe Squid.\n\n01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:55.480\nThat's my name and I originate in your town, but I've read Miami where my family's rocking\n\n01:07:55.480 --> 01:08:00.320\nand they rollin' with the storm, Irma and I not holdin' back.\n\n01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.200\nI know that they are waitin' for that.\n\n01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.200\nThey're waitin' for that.\n\n01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:08.480\nThey've got their stuff in their cabinets and it's kinda wack that the windstorm of\n\n01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:15.920\n195 miles per hour, whatever it is, is gonna be a tiny rain shower to the natives of that\n\n01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:22.720\nplace, cause the storm was born in our face and we do it like we in a race.\n\n01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:23.720\nExtreme weather.\n\n01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:24.720\nPhenomenon.\n\n01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:29.360\nDon't be blind to what's goin' on.\n\n01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:32.080\nInconvenient is the facts.\n\n01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:36.840\nDo you need me to send you a fax about it?\n\n01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:46.680\nAlright, don't judge my rapping when the earth is crappin' us out of its earthly butthole.\n\n01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:51.000\nWe've been here a while and now we're on the dole.\n\n01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:57.280\nIt's a catch-is-catch-can relationship with Mother Gaia and you gotta honor it.\n\n01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:02.920\nShe's got them polar ice caps and they're chilly but they keep us warm in ironic ways.\n\n01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:06.360\nYou gotta go to school to understand it.\n\n01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:14.840\nYo, put your pants on, put your motherfuckin' pants on, motherfuckin' get your shorts off\n\n01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:20.080\nyour pants on, gonna take the club down the street and keep the dance on.\n\n01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:24.880\nDoesn't matter if they're big, doesn't matter if they're small, doesn't matter if they're\n\n01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:31.360\ntight or if they fit at all, doesn't matter if they're gray, if they're black, but not\n\n01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:35.640\nwearing pants right now is a little wack.\n\n01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:36.640\nB-Squid, everybody!\n\n01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.640\nThank you so much, Ally.\n\n01:09:38.640 -->

first version.\n\n01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:11.880\nNot the...\n\n01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:13.600\nI don't want them to get confused.\n\n01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:17.960\nLike, can we put this bonus track on it, I mean, that would be pretty awesome too.\n\n01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.440\nWe'll do like a novelty vinyl number.\n\n01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.440\nIt'd be great.\n\n01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:24.280\nThat'd be really, really special and sampled for eons to come.\n\n01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:29.240\nAlright, cool, and you'll come back one day, hopefully, and yeah, maybe you and Mike Eagle\n\n01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:32.080\nand Logic at the same time, we'll have a rap of Palooza.\n\n01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:33.080\nOh yeah.\n\n01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:34.080\nI love it.\n\n01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:37.400\nI won't group you all together, maybe I don't see the world through that lens where you're\n\n01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:38.400\neither a rapper or not.\n\n01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.640\nI mean, rap parties are fun though, like...\n\n01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:41.640\nMaybe we're all rappers.\n\n01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:44.920\nMaybe I'll just pick them all up in my bus and bring them over and we'll be rapping the\n\n01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:46.920\nwhole way here and the whole way back and it'll be adorable.\n\n01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:47.920\nAnd we'll leave in that bus.\n\n01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:49.560\nCan we outfit your bus for Armageddon?\n\n01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:50.560\nI can.\n\n01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:51.560\nOkay.\n\n01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:52.560\nIt's already ready, we're good for that.\n\n01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:53.560\nWell, you know what you call it?\n\n01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:54.560\nYou call it Armageddon.\n\n01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:55.560\nArmageddon.\n\n01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:56.560\nArmageddon.\n\n01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:57.560\nArmageddon.\n\n01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:58.560\nThe Armageddon tour.\n\n01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:01.080\nWe can't talk about that yet, the deal's not fully closed.\n\n01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:04.160\nAll right, well, let's thank you, B-Squid.\n\n01:11:04.160 -->

often for your little vision quests.\n\n01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.960\nI do want to because I got a lot of writing done out there.\n\n01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:29.960\nYeah?\n\n01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:34.040\nYeah, it's not easy adapting Vonnegut, you know?\n\n01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:37.040\nI strained one of my pinkies.\n\n01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.040\nWhoa.\n\n01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:44.520\nHitting too many commas or like on the keyboard or what?\n\n01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:46.520\nYeah, it was just like, oh man.\n\n01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:47.520\nHe's comma heavy.\n\n01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:48.520\nYou could spray on a pinkie.\n\n01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:49.520\nHe loves commas.\n\n01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.520\nI was just like, oh no.\n\n01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.520\nYeah.\n\n01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:52.520\nAll right.\n\n01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:56.120\nLord knows how many semicolons you're using.\n\n01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:57.520\nLet's, should we get

01:14:07.200\nSilicon Valley is taking over so you can drink my pee\n\n01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:10.200\nbecause I can produce this shit.\n\n01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:12.200\nI ain't going to take it no more.\n\n01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.200\nI'm going to fuck your mama in the front door.\n\n01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:17.200\nGo out the back door and floss her body.\n\n01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:22.200\nI fucked your mama so hard she's now a hottie.\n\n01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:23.200\nShe's now a hottie?\n\n01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:26.200\nIt didn't make sense and had like your connotations of like\n\n01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:27.200\nyou need to fuck a woman to make her hot.\n\n01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.200\nI didn't like it.\n\n01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:30.200\nI backed off because I'm woke.\n\n01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:32.200\nI backed off.\n\n01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:34.200\nBack off that shit.\n\n01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:36.200\nBecause I'm woke like a bicycle spoke.\n\n01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:39.200\nI woke up with a baseball card putting to my spokes\n\n01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:41.200\nand it made a noise that's hard.\n\n01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.200\nLike a motorcycle.\n\n01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:47.200\nI'm going to ride to your mama's house with Michael.\n\n01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:49.200\nUncle Michael.\n\n01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:55.200\nYeah.\n\n01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:57.200\nHere's the thing.\n\n01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:00.200\n9-Eleven was an inside job.\n\n01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:05.200\nHear me out.\n\n01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:09.200\nThe melting point of steel is 457.\n\n01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:11.200\nWhat happened to building seven?\n\n01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:13.200\nWhat don't they want you to know?\n\n01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:14.200\nWhat they want you to think?\n\n01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:17.200\nIf you Google it, you'll see in the sink.\n\n01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:24.200\nAlcada, spelled backwards, is Alcada.\n\n01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:26.200\nDon't look it up.\n\n01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:28.200\nAll right.\n\n01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:33.200\nOkay.\n\n01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:35.200\nWhat if that was someone's evidence that 9-Eleven was\n\n01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:38.200\nan inside job that Alcada spelled backwards as Alcada?\n\n01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:42.200\nThat's neat, but I don't know if it proves anything.\n\n01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:44.200\nYou're not riding the 9-Eleven.\n\n01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:46.200\nTower seven.\n\n01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:50.200\nYeah.\n\n01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:52.200\nI'd just say future wraps.\n\n01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:55.200\nJust put that in your rhyme bank.\n\n01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:57.200\nRemember right after 9-Eleven that email went out\n\n01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:00.200\nthat was like, hey, listen, you got to type in\n\n01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:03.200\nthese are the flight numbers of the planes\n\n01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:06.200\nand then type this in and then change your font to Wingdings\n\n01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:10.200\nand then it was like two buildings and two planes\n\n01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:13.200\nand then some oil, stuff like black drops\n\n01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.200\nand I was like, dude, that's oil!\n\n01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:19.200\nAnd then we were like, wait a minute, those are the flight numbers.\n\n01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:26.200\nWhy would the 9-Eleven people be like, no, here's what we do?\n\n01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:28.200\nWe got to wait until...\n\n01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:31.200\nYou know we should get on the show?\n\n01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:33.200\nThe 9-Eleven people.\n\n01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:35.200\nTragically.\n\n01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:39.200\nOr like the guy who was the inside guy at Microsoft\n\n01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:42.200\nwho manipulated the Wingdings font.\n\n01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:44.200\nAll right.\n\n01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:45.200\nDavid?\n\n01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.200\nYeah.\n\n01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:47.200\nHow you doing?\n\n01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:49.200\nIt's been an interesting week.\n\n01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:50.200\nYeah?\n\n01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:52.200\nBreak it down for us.\n\n01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:54.200\nShe's so shocked.\n\n01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:56.200\nIt's been an interesting week.\n\n01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:02.200\nYeah, what happened?\n\n01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:06.200\nMy roommate's car was stolen out of my garage.\n\n01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:07.200\nYeah.\n\n01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.200\nSounds like an inside job.\n\n01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.200\nYeah.\n\n01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:12.200\nI think it was an inside job.\n\n01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:16.200\nWhat's the point of that car?\n\n01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:20.200\nIt was a real bummer because my car was broken into\n\n01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.200\nand they found my garage clicker\n\n01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:27.200\nand his spare key somewhere in my car.\n\n01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:30.200\nWait, no, back us up through that.\n\n01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:32.200\nThey didn't break into...\n\n01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:35.200\nThat's how they got into the garage is by breaking into your car.\n\n01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:36.200\nI think it was an inside job.\n\n01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:39.200\nI think somebody watched me...\n\n01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:42.200\nSomebody watched me walk away from my car,\n\n01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.200\nforget to lock it,\n\n01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:45.200\nand then...\n\n01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:47.200\nOutside the...\n\n01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:48.200\nNo, in the garage.\n\n01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:50.200\nBecause I'm in an apartment building.\n\n01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:53.200\nOkay, so when you say inside job,\n\n01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:55.200\nliterally like someone who lives in the apartment...\n\n01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:56.200\nSomeone who lives in...\n\n01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:57.200\nYeah.\n\n01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:58.200\nI think it was the Russians.\n\n01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:59.200\nBut that's better than...\n\n01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:01.200\nI thought you were saying you parked on the street\n\n01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.200\nand that you'd have to feel guilty about that\n\n01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.200\nfor the rest of your life.\n\n01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:05.200\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:07.200\nI parked on the street because I was just going to run in\n\n01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:09.200\nand my clicker opened the garage,\n\n01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:11.200\nwent in and had a field day.\n\n01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:12.200\nNo.\n\n01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:13.200\nBut no, you're an innocent too.\n\n01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:16.200\nYou can't control when another human being\n\n01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:19.200\nthat is allowed past all of the security measures\n\n01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:22.200\nis going to be a crazy car.\n\n01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.200\nShouldn't it be easy to investigate then?\n\n01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:27.200\nI mean, like, it's just one building of suspects.\n\n01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:28.200\nRight.\n\n01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:29.200\nThere are cameras.\n\n01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:30.200\nThey called the...\n\n01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:31.200\nI don't know.\n\n01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:32.200\nI would also...\n\n01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:33.200\nAnd I'm suspecting, like,\n\n01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:36.200\nthat's a good ten episodes of a Netflix original.\n\n01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:37.200\nYeah.\n\n01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:39.200\nIt's called The Building.\n\n01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:42.200\nDan, you have enough on your plate right now.\n\n01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:44.200\nYou've already sprained one pinky.\n\n01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:47.200\nEd Harris made one mistake.\n\n01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:50.200\nIt's just because I'm the only one who's lifted his head\n\n01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:51.200\nwhile beating Rodney King.\n\n01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:54.200\nNow I'm in charge of apartment building the car thievery.\n\n01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:57.200\nBut one job was going to change everything.\n\n01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:58.200\nWhoa!\n\n01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:00.200\nThis is a crazy job.\n\n01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:02.200\nI've got to throw the car.\n\n01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:05.200\nNetflix presents\n\n01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:07.200\na show with a trailer\n\n01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:10.200\nthat follows the 90s trailer trope.\n\n01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:14.200\nIn a world.\n\n01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:15.200\nOh, shit.\n\n01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:18.200\nYo, 90s trailers.\n\n01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:21.200\nThey got that voice and says,\n\n01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.200\nIn a world where you stole a car.\n\n01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:25.200\nFuckin' man, drink a jar.\n\n01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:26.200\nAll right.\n\n01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:27.200\nGet back to the...\n\n01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:28.200\nI'm not that interesting.\n\n01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:29.200\nTalk.\n\n01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:32.200\nUh...\n\n01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:36.200\nDan and Spencer shot a fun Harmon Quest commercial this week.\n\n01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:37.200\nRight.\n\n01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.200\nThat was a highlight.\n\n01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:39.200\nReal fun.\n\n01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:40.200\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:41.200\nHarmon Quest is coming to Verve.\n\n01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:43.200\nNext week.\n\n01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:44.200\nVerve?\n\n01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:45.200\nThis week.\n\n01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:47.200\nIt's twice as expensive as CISO\n\n01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:50.200\nand twice as likely to stick around for a year.\n\n01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:55.200\nI didn't...\n\n01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:58.200\nI didn't ask for this new world any more than you did.\n\n01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.200\nLike, try to look at it this way.\n\n01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.200\nLike, CISO was a Kickstarter.\n\n01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:06.200\nAnd thank you for your $5 commitment to their experiment,\n\n01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:10.200\nwhich was noble and gave, like, Cameron and Ria a show\n\n01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:14.200\nand, like, a bunch of really cool shows on CISO.\n\n01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:17.200\nAnd then, like, I don't think this was a controversial statement.\n\n01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:19.200\nI don't think Universal gave it enough of a chance.\n\n01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:20.200\nYou can't...\n\n01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:22.200\nThat business model needs five years,\n\n01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.200\nbut they had their own reasons and they fucking folded it.\n\n01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:25.200\nThat's not your problem.\n\n01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:26.200\nOr...\n\n01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:27.200\nBut it's a little bit mine,\n\n01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:29.200\nbecause, like, now we have this world where it's like,\n\n01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:31.200\nguys like me are like, I got a built-in audience,\n\n01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:33.200\nand am I going to keep coming to you and going,\n\n01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:35.200\nhere's another person to subscribe to.\n\n01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:36.200\nI don't want to do that to you.\n\n01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:37.200\nThat's not what Robin Hood does.\n\n01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:39.200\nHe doesn't go,\n\n01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:41.200\nhey, Merry Men,\n\n01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:44.200\nI want to introduce you to Gerald of Nottingham.\n\n01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:47.200\nHe's got a real fun business plan.\n\n01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:50.200\nFor every bottle of shampoo you sell,\n\n01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:53.200\nthree people underneath you sell six bottles,\n\n01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:56.200\nand that's not the Robin Hood myth we want.\n\n01:20:56.200 --> 01:21:00.200\nAre we finding out that Harmon Quest isn't good enough to make it to, like, an adult swim?\n\n01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:02.200\nOh, yeah, for sure.\n\n01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:08.200\nI mean, it's kind of the fact that we're not already on one of those networks\n\n01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:12.200\nimplies that we did not make it onto one of those networks.\n\n01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:13.200\nRight.\n\n01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.200\nYeah, but now I...\n\n01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:18.200\nOur show is good enough to be on that, compared to...\n\n01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:24.200\nI think there's an alternate reality where we did go to adult swim or something similar.\n\n01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:26.200\nBut now adult swim doesn't need us to,\n\n01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:28.200\nbecause we're making it for free for two seasons,\n\n01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:31.200\nand if that becomes so big and with such a success,\n\n01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:33.200\nadult swim can come along, scoop it up,\n\n01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:35.200\nand they're going to be like the heroes,\n\n01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:36.200\nbut they didn't do anything.\n\n01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:38.200\nYeah, I mean, I don't even know the particulars of the deal,\n\n01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:40.200\nbut we didn't have...\n\n01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.200\nAmong our options wasn't like,\n\n01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:44.200\nwe're going to keep our show and go...\n\n01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:46.200\nRight, yeah, we don't have the rights.\n\n01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:48.200\nWe would just do it on the internet, sell it for a dollar an episode,\n\n01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:49.200\nbut that's not...\n\n01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:53.200\nThe business works like we couldn't have produced that level of show\n\n01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:55.200\nif CISO didn't exist.\n\n01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:59.200\nThey had the budget to give us to do it dinner for five fucking style\n\n01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.200\nand have an audience,\n\n01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:02.200\nand my camera's going wooshy woosh,\n\n01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:04.200\nand Lizzie Olson's on it,\n\n01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:06.200\nand fucking it's a good show,\n\n01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:09.200\nbecause it's a little higher production value than if we did it on our own,\n\n01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.200\nbut the upside of that,\n\n01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.200\nor the downside, or the side side of that is like,\n\n01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:16.200\nokay, so CISO, they're folded,\n\n01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:19.200\nthey sold all their shit to Verve.\n\n01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:21.200\nVerve is huge fans, they love the show.\n\n01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:23.200\nIt's one of my favorite bands, too.\n\n01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:24.200\nRight.\n\n01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:26.200\nSo, you know, and then I go to you guys and I go,\n\n01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.200\nhey, it's 11.99 a month now.\n\n01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:29.200\nI go to you guys and they're like,\n\n01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:30.200\nhow is this going to...\n\n01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:31.200\nHow does this end?\n\n01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:32.200\nAm I just in a bunker with you,\n\n01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:35.200\ngiving you $50 a month for your pee?\n\n01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:39.200\nThat's why this season we're asking you not to watch Harmon Quest.\n\n01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:44.200\nWe're tired of it, we're not being complicit any longer.\n\n01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:45.200\nBut our show...\n\n01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:51.200\nLet's just be honest, our show is on dialysis and we need your money.\n\n01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.200\nYeah, for the first season.\n\n01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:53.200\nWhat I also think they...\n\n01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:55.200\nWell, yeah, they made the first season available.\n\n01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:57.200\nYou can't like check out the second season, right?\n\n01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:58.200\nThere might be...\n\n01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:02.200\nI would not be surprised if the first episode of the second season is free,\n\n01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:03.200\nbut I'm not sure.\n\n01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:04.200\nThat sounds right.\n\n01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:05.200\nIt's a good episode, though.\n\n01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:07.200\nWe got Gillian Jacobs and, oh boy,\n\n01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:10.200\nI don't want to say she was like very Brita-esque,\n\n01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:11.200\nbut it was great.\n\n01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:12.200\nWhy?\n\n01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:14.200\nHow do you even have that much money?\n\n01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:16.200\nIt's just, these are singles, but...\n\n01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:17.200\nWhat are you doing?\n\n01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:18.200\nI know!\n\n01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:20.200\nThis is half of the singles in my underwear drawer.\n\n01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:21.200\nOh, okay.\n\n01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.200\nAre you going to jumbos later?\n\n01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:24.200\nWhat's happening?\n\n01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:26.200\nWhy did you choose to take them out of your drawer?\n\n01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:27.200\nBecause I thought maybe something would come up.\n\n01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:28.200\nI don't know.\n\n01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:29.200\nAnd maybe it has.\n\n01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.200\nIt's like, well, if anybody feels like...\n\n01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:32.200\nDid you want to make it rain?\n\n01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:33.200\nYeah, make it rain.\n\n01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:34.200\nYou want to make it rain.\n\n01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:35.200\nYou want to make it rain.\n\n01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:37.200\nIf you give everyone here $1, if you give everyone here $1...\n\n01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:38.200\nI think I might be...\n\n01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:40.200\nNo, I probably couldn't.\n\n01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:41.200\nTry it.\n\n01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:44.200\nBut I could...\n\n01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:45.200\nTry it.\n\n01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:47.200\nI thought he had to stuck her for dollars.\n\n01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:51.200\nOr you give someone all the money, but they have to answer three riddles.\n\n01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.200\nOh, shit.\n\n01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:59.200\nWhy don't I just do what I do for Trick or Treat, which is I'll put a plate at the foot\n\n01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:06.200\nof the stage with a sign that says, just take one, and I'll put one of these dollars on\n\n01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:10.200\nit, and fucking sleep like a baby, because then you see the empty plate, and you're like,\n\n01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:12.200\nfuck society.\n\n01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:18.200\nThis nice man left a bunch of money on a plate.\n\n01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:21.200\nNo one ever appreciates that.\n\n01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:23.200\nDid you really do that?\n\n01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:25.200\nYeah, like, you know, put up...\n\n01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:26.200\nThis is a Trick or Treat trick.\n\n01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:29.200\nLook, if you didn't have time to go buy candy, put an empty bucket outside your door, and\n\n01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:37.200\nput a sign that says, like, high road the fucking kids, and go, be honest, just take\n\n01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:38.200\none.\n\n01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:40.200\nAnd then the kid gets to...\n\n01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:41.200\nHere's the thing.\n\n01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:43.200\nIt's a victimless crime.\n\n01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:50.200\nThe first kid, the first kid, if there's a kid that goes Trick or Treating at 3.15\n\n01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:53.200\np.m., fuck that kid.\n\n01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:55.200\nBut also, he's like a red pillar.\n\n01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:56.200\nHe knows.\n\n01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:58.200\nHe's like, this fucking dude's pulling a scam.\n\n01:24:58.200 --> 01:24:59.200\nThere's nobody here before me.\n\n01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:00.200\nOkay, fine.\n\n01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:02.200\nThat kid goes off and gets a serial killer.\n\n01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:06.200\nEvery kid after that, every kid after that goes up to the bucket.\n\n01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:11.200\nHe's an empty bucket and a sign that says, let's try to be nice people, huh?\n\n01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:12.200\nAnd an empty bucket.\n\n01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:14.200\nAnd the kid goes like, you know what?\n\n01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:17.200\nI love that there's a guy here that thought society was worth a shit.\n\n01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:18.200\nToo bad it wasn't.\n\n01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:20.200\nI'm gonna move on through my day.\n\n01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:21.200\nGo get some other candy.\n\n01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:23.200\nVictimless crime.\n\n01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:24.200\nI got two things.\n\n01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:29.200\nOkay, so the first one is, isn't it just fine to not have any candy and stuff?\n\n01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.200\nLike, will people shame you or anything like that?\n\n01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:32.200\nIs that something you have to worry about?\n\n01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:35.200\nWell, I have a lockable gate in the front of my estate now, so that's just not really\n\n01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:36.200\nan issue anymore.\n\n01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:38.200\nWell, it just means, you know, there's a lot of...\n\n01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:41.200\nI could just hit a button shape like a bat and fucking turrets like pointed.\n\n01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:46.200\nThe kids, you have 10 seconds to expect less.\n\n01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:49.200\nDid you fear your trees getting tepied?\n\n01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:50.200\nRight, yeah.\n\n01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:54.200\nLike, what's the downside of just not having candy?\n\n01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:55.200\nThat's pretty standard, right?\n\n01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:04.200\nIf they're gonna tepee my trees, first of all, they're only hurting my gardener.\n\n01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:06.200\nSecond of all, and I'll put that on the note.\n\n01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:08.200\nDan, what I like about you is their front door.\n\n01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:12.200\nThe more success that you achieve, the more relatable you become.\n\n01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:16.200\nI'm not trying to be relatable anymore, man.\n\n01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:19.200\nI'm just trying to be honest, brother.\n\n01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:21.200\nYou've become a man of the people.\n\n01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:24.200\nYeah, I'm salt of the earth now.\n\n01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:32.200\nA big salt of the earth orbiting the earth on a military grade platform, hoarding the\n\n01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:35.200\noxygen it steals.\n\n01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:40.200\nI thought you were saying that you put a bowl out with a $1 bill in it and said,\n\n01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:41.200\nplease just take one.\n\n01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:45.200\nAnd then somebody goes, oh, fuck, somebody got all the money.\n\n01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:47.200\nRight, well, I am saying that.\n\n01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:48.200\nI mean, it's an interesting twist.\n\n01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:51.200\nYou have one piece of candy you put in the bucket and it's the last one left.\n\n01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:52.200\nSee how long it lasts.\n\n01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:55.200\nBut if you have that kind of time, buy a bag of candy.\n\n01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:57.200\nRight, it would be hard to get one piece of candy.\n\n01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:59.200\nThis is for a guy who didn't have time to buy candy.\n\n01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:02.200\nI'm not being cruel, I'm not like a weird monster.\n\n01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:07.200\nYeah, but you have like two full-sized Snickers in there.\n\n01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:08.200\nIt says, please just take one.\n\n01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:12.200\nBut you have a camera rig, like the way to take a picture of you when you're going down\n\n01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:13.200\nSplash Mountain.\n\n01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:18.200\nAnd so the kid walks away with two Snickers and he's got a picture of him.\n\n01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:21.200\nBut he also gets to buy that picture if he wants.\n\n01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:23.200\nLook, I'll tell you what, man.\n\n01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:27.200\nOnce you get over 30, it's like the pressure gets on, unless you live in a really specific\n\n01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:31.200\nneighborhood that's designed for people to buy the house because it looks like a house\n\n01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:34.200\nwhere they can't wait to give that candy a trick or treat and designed for the parents\n\n01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:36.200\nto drop their kids off at that cul-de-sac.\n\n01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:41.200\nLike every other place in Los Angeles, it's like, you start to like, it becomes an exercise\n\n01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:47.200\nand the fucking primatological anxiety, like you open the door and there's like a 15-year-old\n\n01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:55.200\ndude that put like a fucking ski cap on his head because that's his costume and he's\n\n01:27:55.200 --> 01:28:00.200\nlike holding his shirt out going, give me candy and you're like, Jesus Christ, don't\n\n01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:01.200\nkill me.\n\n01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.200\nLike it's a big city, man.\n\n01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:05.200\nThere's no charm to trick or treat.\n\n01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:06.200\nLike it's kind of like the purge now.\n\n01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:11.200\nI just kind of like, Ethan hawk into my bedroom and watch through a camera.\n\n01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:16.200\nI say this Halloween, we just break into Steve's roommate's car and put all our candy in there\n\n01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:20.200\nand the kids have to go and kind of pretend to break into that car.\n\n01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:27.200\nDid I ever share the story of when I was, me and my friend, my best friend Ram Stack,\n\n01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:33.200\nwe were like, I think we were like 11 or 12 and we were like, we were kind of doing that.\n\n01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:39.200\nWe were like, we put some dirt on our face so we had hobo costumes and we were like going\n\n01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:41.200\nand trick or treating like, free candy.\n\n01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:49.200\nAnd then like, here comes Jenny Vote who is like the crush of my life in grade school\n\n01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:53.200\nand she's like walking and she's got this like little girl with her, like maybe a little\n\n01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:57.200\nsister is dressed like an astronaut or a princess or something.\n\n01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:02.200\nAnd it's always Jenny Vote and I got like soot on my face and I'm like, hey, what's\n\n01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:03.200\ngoing on?\n\n01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:05.200\nAnd she's like, yeah, you trick or treating?\n\n01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:06.200\nI'm like, yeah, are you?\n\n01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:09.200\nAnd she's like, well, she is.\n\n01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:15.200\nShe was like on fucking like, you know, chaperoning because she was a grown up because she was\n\n01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:16.200\nmy age.\n\n01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:23.200\nThat's like one of those big moments where the girls grow up fast and then you're like,\n\n01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:26.200\nI'm a fucking worst.\n\n01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:28.200\nI was a worst person at that age.\n\n01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:33.200\nWe would go up to the top of the steep hill and take the pumpkins from people's front\n\n01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:40.200\nguards and then spray him like awkward spray paint and light them on fire and roll them\n\n01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:45.200\ndown hill and it's pretty scary when you see a jack-o-lantern coming at you on fire.\n\n01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:52.200\nBut then the problem that, you know, the bad part of that is that at the end there's a house\n\n01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:59.200\nand a flaming incendiary device is going into the juniper tree in their front yard and going\n\n01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:00.200\nto kill everybody.\n\n01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:04.200\nAt the end of it is a whole society that's just like, oh, so you kids just don't give\n\n01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:05.200\na fuck.\n\n01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:07.200\nLike I feel so bad about being a kid now.\n\n01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:09.200\nLike we used to just like throw shit at cars.\n\n01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:10.200\nLike we didn't get it.\n\n01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:12.200\nWe thought we were the goonies.\n\n01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:14.200\nDid we talk about windows happen?\n\n01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:15.200\nYeah.\n\n01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:16.200\nWith the penny in the tape.\n\n01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:17.200\nDid we ever talk about this?\n\n01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:19.200\nWait, my penny tapping?\n\n01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:20.200\nNo, window tapping.\n\n01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:21.200\nPenny tapping.\n\n01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:22.200\nWe called it penny tapping.\n\n01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.200\nYeah.\n\n01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:24.200\nDid you tell me about this?\n\n01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:25.200\nYeah.\n\n01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:26.200\nI told you about penny tapping.\n\n01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:27.200\nYeah, that's fucking it.\n\n01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:28.200\nThat's some sinister shit.\n\n01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:29.200\nYeah.\n\n01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:30.200\nBut that's like the most benign thing of all.\n\n01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:31.200\nYeah, but it's just tortures.\n\n01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:32.200\nThat is beauty shit.\n\n01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:33.200\nI know.\n\n01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:34.200\nBut at least, yeah.\n\n01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:35.200\nWell, you know what?\n\n01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:36.200\nNow that I think about it.\n\n01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:40.200\nBut it's because you're implying to a person that someone's tapping on their window.\n\n01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:44.200\nLike now you look at it through a modern lens, you're like, that's a horrible thing to do\n\n01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:45.200\nto somebody.\n\n01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:46.200\nBut we were kids.\n\n01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:47.200\nIt was the 80s.\n\n01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:49.200\nSo we thought, well, they will think it's like Slender Man.\n\n01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:50.200\nI didn't.\n\n01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:53.200\nI was invented in 2013.\n\n01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:57.200\nShut the fuck up, you fucking uncreative, shitty generation.\n\n01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:00.200\nThat's been our show.\n\n01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:03.200\nThank you very much for coming.\n\n01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:05.200\nWhat if a guy had long arms?\n\n01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:09.200\nYou should be ashamed of yourselves.\n\n01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:13.200\nYou have an entire internet to create mythology.\n\n01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:19.200\nYou are bad kids.\n\n01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:22.200\nAll right.\n\n01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:23.200\nThat's mine.\n\n01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:30.200\nSimon wanted us to plug his Kickstarter, The Crawling King.\n\n01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:34.200\nSo I guess Starburns, they're doing a project called The Crawling King.\n\n01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:40.200\nIt's going to be a hard written horror fantasy with almost 200 pages of incredibly insane\n\n01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:41.200\nart.\n\n01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:46.200\nAre you available as a publicist?\n\n01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:49.200\nI can fill that role sometimes.\n\n01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:53.200\nI just like, yeah, whatever you're selling, I'm buying.\n\n01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:54.200\nAll right.\n\n01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:55.200\nHow do you access it?\n\n01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:59.200\nCan I pitch something that is happening here at the Starburns Castle?\n\n01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:01.200\nIt's something I actually believe in because I went last Wednesday.\n\n01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:04.200\nChurch, three more weekends?\n\n01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:06.200\nHow many more weekends is Eddie here?\n\n01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:07.200\nThree.\n\n01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:09.200\nEddie Pepitone is one of my favorite comics of all time.\n\n01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:11.200\nWas anybody here on Wednesday?\n\n01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:13.200\nIt was absolutely wonderful.\n\n01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:15.200\nHe's a crazy genius, wonderful.\n\n01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:21.200\nIt's partly material, partly just rift, and you just watch a really, really funny guy\n\n01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:24.200\nlose his fucking mind in front of your eyes, and it was magical.\n\n01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:29.200\nSo I'm sad that I'm going to be out of town for the next two Wednesdays, but if you're\n\n01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:33.200\nfree, come here on Wednesdays to see Eddie Pepitone.\n\n01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:37.200\nLook it up at StarburnsIndustries.com, right, Church?\n\n01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:38.200\nStarburnsCastle.com.\n\n01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:39.200\nStarburnsCastle.com.\n\n01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:41.200\nIt's really good stuff, and he's a monster.\n\n01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:46.200\nIf you don't already know him, you must, because he's doing comedy the way, like, stand\n\n01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:48.200\nup, ought to aspire to, I think.\n\n01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:49.200\nI love him.\n\n01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:52.200\nPepitone is the best at tone.\n\n01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:54.200\nNo, no takers?\n\n01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:58.200\nPepitone is the best at tone?\n\n01:32:58.200 --> 01:32:59.200\nI know, I tried.\n\n01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:01.200\nIt's better than him.\n\n01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:03.200\nDid you hear that?\n\n01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:06.200\nSimon wants you to do that.\n\n01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:07.200\nI guess it's a horror series.\n\n01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:10.200\nI guess there's a thing someone wants you to do.\n\n01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:11.200\nWhat?\n\n01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:12.200\nYeah.\n\n01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:13.200\nWell, how do we in?\n\n01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:18.760\nI guess they took a dog's blood and extracted the oxygen from it, and it's a new sports\n\n01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:21.200\ndrink that makes you sad.\n\n01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:29.200\nIt's called Doggone Energy.\n\n01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:31.000\nYou sound like an experiment.\n\n01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.000\nYour heart is broken.\n\n01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.000\nYou had a heartbreak.\n\n01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.000\nI did, yeah.\n\n01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.000\nRecently?\n\n01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000\nYeah, this last week.\n\n01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.200\nBut you opened with a car breaking, but you actually had a real break.\n\n01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:44.200\nHe's like one of these boy scouts he doesn't want to talk about.\n\n01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:49.200\nHe's not like me, he's like, get up on stage and go, yeah, girl broke my heart.\n\n01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:52.200\nI mean, broken hearted?\n\n01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:55.200\nI mean, look, I'm numb these days.\n\n01:33:55.200 --> 01:34:01.200\nIt was like two and a half months ago, that one was like I wasn't eating, I couldn't sleep.\n\n01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:03.200\nBut this one, I was just like, I'm tired.\n\n01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:06.200\nBut your ad reads last time were amazing.\n\n01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:09.200\nNow we can tell that you're hurting yourself.\n\n01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:11.200\nI'm making a lot of it.\n\n01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:13.200\nCan we talk about it at all?\n\n01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:14.200\nIf you want.\n\n01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:15.200\nI'd love to.\n\n01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:18.200\nOh, geez, okay.\n\n01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:23.200\nLike, were you in love and love or falling in love or infatuated?\n\n01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:24.200\nWhich one?\n\n01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:28.200\nI mean, that's the question.\n\n01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:34.200\nThat's what multiple choice questions are all about.\n\n01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:39.200\nThis one we, I don't know, we've loved each other for a long time and we're trying to\n\n01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:40.200\nmake it work.\n\n01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:49.200\nBut, you know, it's, she was like, the girl I've been chasing my whole life kind of thing.\n\n01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:53.200\nIt was like 16 years in the making.\n\n01:34:53.200 --> 01:35:00.200\nAnd I don't think we gave it much of a chance this time around.\n\n01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:03.200\nLike, you know, you know, whatever.\n\n01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:06.200\nWait, I'm not, that was a joke, right?\n\n01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:07.200\nAre you?\n\n01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:09.200\nNo, no, I mean like.\n\n01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:10.200\nI thought it was.\n\n01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:12.200\nThat's like a note that a writer would write.\n\n01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:13.200\nThat's a joke.\n\n01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:14.200\nNo, I know.\n\n01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:15.200\nHe's one of you.\n\n01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:18.200\nThis time around, this time around they didn't give it a chance.\n\n01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:19.200\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:24.200\nNo, we, it was like, I, it was always like unrequited, but we, our friendship like just got stronger\n\n01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:27.200\nand stronger until we were able to finally cross a threshold.\n\n01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:32.200\nAnd then this summer it was like, let's try, let's actually try to have a, a relationship.\n\n01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:33.200\nWell, you know what, Steve?\n\n01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:35.200\nLet's bring her out.\n\n01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:38.200\nPut your hands together.\n\n01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:39.200\nYeah.\n\n01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:40.200\nYeah.\n\n01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:41.200\nYeah.\n\n01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:42.200\nYeah.\n\n01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:43.200\nThat'd be amazing.\n\n01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:50.200\nIt's a nice show called This Isn't Your Wife.\n\n01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:51.200\nWhat?\n\n01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:52.200\nIt's hilarious.\n\n01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:53.200\nIt's hilarious.\n\n01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:54.200\nI stand by it.\n\n01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:57.200\nI stand by it.\n\n01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:59.200\nYou laughed through your own grog.\n\n01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:04.200\nBut yeah, I mean, I, you know, it's nice.\n\n01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:06.200\nYou're, you're, you're a good guy.\n\n01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:12.200\nLike, like, like in my, in my day, like that would, that's, that just goes right into the\n\n01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:16.200\nmisogyny engine because the way to recover from that, like sure is like you get bit by\n\n01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:19.200\na snake, you rub it in dirt or whatever you do.\n\n01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:20.200\nAnd that's a bad example.\n\n01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:24.200\nI don't know anything, I don't know anything about primal medicine.\n\n01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:25.200\nCan we put a pin on that thought?\n\n01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:26.200\nAll right.\n\n01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:29.200\nIt's like, you know how, like you burn your thumb and then you shove it in your mouth.\n\n01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:33.200\nAnd it's like, probably that's not helping as much as some other counterintuitive thing,\n\n01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:35.200\nlike you're supposed to pee on it or let a bee lick it.\n\n01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:36.200\nI don't know.\n\n01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:40.200\nBut like you, you millennials, you're a millennial, right?\n\n01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:41.200\nYou're 40.\n\n01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:42.200\nYeah.\n\n01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:47.200\nLike you kids, like you're very, like you're, you're, you don't go to that place.\n\n01:36:47.200 -->

a harder thing to deal with because\n\n01:36:54.200 --> 01:37:00.200\nyou don't get to go to the places that I got to go to when I was an adolescent or even\n\n01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:01.200\nin my 30s.\n\n01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:03.200\nI was still like fucking, okay.\n\n01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.200\nWell, that's easy.\n\n01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:05.200\nThat's easy.\n\n01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:06.200\nBitches is crazy.\n\n01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:10.200\nYou know, like, like, like I'll leave a shitty comment on her blog and yeah, like, like,\n\n01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:13.200\nlike, like

gentleman and I know that hurts more.\n\n01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:28.200\nYou're having to deal with more pain.\n\n01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:30.200\nYou're having to manage more pain on your own.\n\n01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:32.200\nIt's, that's like very applaudable.\n\n01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:34.200\nYou should know people appreciate that.\n\n01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:38.200\nIt's like, like, like you're not going to a dark place and that that's harder to do.\n\n01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:39.200\nThat's fucking cool.\n\n01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:40.200\nLove you.\n\n01:37:40.200 -->

get, you know, like somewhere\n\n01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:11.200\nin the middle is like a rhythm.\n\n01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:13.200\nWill you go see my therapist?\n\n01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:15.200\nI told

is to live out a life of fantasy.\n\n01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:35.200\nWhy don't we play a little bit of D&D?\n\n01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:40.200\nOh yeah.\n\n01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:43.200\nLast time.\n\n01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:45.200\nWhat happened?\n\n01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:46.200\nAll right.\n\n01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:47.200\nWho dumped you?\n\n01:39:47.200 -->

01:40:06.200\nIt's treacherous goings.\n\n01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:07.200\nNo, what happened?\n\n01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:09.200\nWe, we, we found some bandits.\n\n01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:11.200\nWe left with the, with Patchens.\n\n01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:12.200\nRight.\n\n01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:13.200\nLeaving the church with Patchens.\n\n01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:16.200\nBanditos attacked and they got him.\n\n01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:18.200\nThe end.\n\n01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:20.200\nI'm still unconscious, right?\n\n01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:21.200\nDid we, did we lose Patchens?\n\n01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:23.200\nPatchens is gone?\n\n01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:28.200\nThat's a great question to ask in character.\n\n01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:31.200\nWell, we, we know that the, that the prior boned out.\n\n01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:32.200\nHe de-camped.\n\n01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:34.200\nHe left us cause he wanted to get out.\n\n01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:35.200\nYeah.\n\n01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:36.200\nSo you're at the campground.\n\n01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:40.200\nOne of, one of the guys, one of the guys Dan touched with his inflict wounds and he kind\n\n01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:41.200\nof withered.\n\n01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:42.200\nYeah.\n\n01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:43.200\nThat guy's kind of hobbling away.\n\n01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:47.200\nAnd then there's another guy who you clubbed his, he clubbed him in the head and he kind\n\n01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:49.200\nof just went down coal.\n\n01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:54.200\nThe rest of the banditos have kind of escaped at this point and they made off with Patchens'\n\n01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:55.200\nclothes.\n\n01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:58.200\nThey took Patchens' clothes but I took some clothes off another dead guy and put them on\n\n01:40:58.200 --> 01:40:59.200\nPatchens.\n\n01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:00.200\nRight.\n\n01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:01.200\nI go up to Patchens.\n\n01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:02.200\nPatchens, can you hear me?\n\n01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:03.200\nHow are you?\n\n01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:04.200\nUgh.\n\n01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:05.200\nUgh.\n\n01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:06.200\nUgh.\n\n01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:07.200\nUgh.\n\n01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:08.200\nOh my God.\n\n01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:09.200\nUgh.\n\n01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:10.200\nI'm stabbed.\n\n01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:15.200\nPatchens, is your character so important to our story that I should heal you?\n\n01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:16.200\nThese little kinds of-\n\n01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:18.200\nWhy should you have to ask that?\n\n01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:19.200\nHe's Patchens.\n\n01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:20.200\nI'll answer that.\n\n01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:21.200\nOkay.\n\n01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:24.200\nThese are the moral questions you've got to decide.\n\n01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:28.200\nI have a little PTSD from fighting these, for those banditos.\n\n01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:30.200\nThat's in real life.\n\n01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:33.200\nWhere are my clothes?\n\n01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:36.200\nSome other guy took them but you're wearing a bandito's outfit right now.\n\n01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:37.200\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:38.200\nOh my God.\n\n01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:39.200\nHe starts sobbing inconsolably.\n\n01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:43.200\nHe's like, he's thrashing around and like clawing at the soil.\n\n01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:44.200\nI'm going to fix this.\n\n01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:47.200\nI want to follow the hobbling bandito.\n\n01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:48.200\nOkay.\n\n01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:49.200\nHe's slower, right?\n\n01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:50.200\nYeah.\n\n01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:51.200\nSo I'm going to go grab him.\n\n01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:52.200\nAll right.\n\n01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:53.200\nYou're just grabbing him?\n\n01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:54.200\nWell, if I can.\n\n01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:55.200\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:56.200\nWell-\n\n01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:57.200\nIf I may.\n\n01:41:57.200 --> 01:41:58.200\nYeah.\n\n01:41:58.200 --> 01:41:59.200\nNo.\n\n01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:00.200\nI mean, there's a lot of ways to approach the guy.\n\n01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:01.200\nBut yeah, that works.\n\n01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:02.200\nOkay.\n\n01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:03.200\nSo I'm sorry.\n\n01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:04.200\nYou rolled a two.\n\n01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:05.200\nYou do not grab him.\n\n01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:06.200\nYeah.\n\n01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:07.200\nNo.\n\n01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:09.200\nYou definitely don't grab him.\n\n01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:13.200\nBut he's still just hobbling away so you can essentially try.\n\n01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:14.200\nYeah.\n\n01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:16.200\nI walk up to Patchens and I cure light wounds.\n\n01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:17.200\nOkay.\n\n01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:18.200\nLight wounds.\n\n01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:19.200\nThat's 1d8.\n\n01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:20.200\nAll right.\n\n01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:22.200\nHe heals eight damage.\n\n01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:27.200\nMost of his wounds are starting to scab over, but he's not like completely healed and he's\n\n01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:33.200\nstill just, you know, I don't know, insane almost.\n\n01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:35.200\nYou want to grab him again?\n\n01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:36.200\nDo you want to do something?\n\n01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:37.200\nI think I'm unconscious.\n\n01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:38.200\nYeah.\n\n01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:39.200\nThat's true.\n\n01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:40.200\nOh, Steve, you're dreaming.\n\n01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:45.200\nYou're dreaming about that same door that Rob Schrab's version of you was dreaming about.\n\n01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:46.200\nYeah.\n\n01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:50.200\nCarlos, we got a bigger fish to fry here.\n\n01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:55.200\nOur friend Diarrhea Jr. here, he's got a demon mist inside him.\n\n01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:56.200\nWe got to help this guy.\n\n01:42:56.200 --> 01:43:02.200\nI don't have time to explain, but a lot of medicine has to do with state of mind and\n\n01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:05.200\nhe needs to confront his tormentor.\n\n01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:06.200\nWho does?\n\n01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:07.200\nHuh?\n\n01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:09.200\nWho has to confront who?\n\n01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:10.200\nPatchens.\n\n01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:11.200\nI'll be right there.\n\n01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:12.200\nOkay.\n\n01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:13.200\nI just, I rolled a two.\n\n01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:14.200\nSorry.\n\n01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:15.200\nI'll be back already.\n\n01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:16.200\nOkay.\n\n01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:17.200\nI got you.\n\n01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:18.200\nAll right.\n\n01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:19.200\nYou grab him this time.\n\n01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:20.200\nAll right.\n\n01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:21.200\nCan I drag him over?\n\n01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:22.200\nAll right.\n\n01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:28.280\nHe is still armed, so, yeah, he doesn't, he doesn't stab you, but he's, if you don't like\n\n01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:31.200\nreally restrain him, like you're, you're like grappling one of them, you know, but if you\n\n01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:33.200\ndon't really restrain him, he might keep stabbing you.\n\n01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:38.720\nI pull him, I pull him by the hair and I, and I, and I, you know, I say in a, in a very\n\n01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:43.320\nconvicted voice because the truth is my character in these moments is convicted about these\n\n01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:44.320\nkinds of things.\n\n01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:45.320\nOkay.\n\n01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:52.640\nI say, if you one more time make the wrong decision about, about who you're trying to\n\n01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:59.320\nharm, I, I, I will kill you and that will be the beginning of your misery.\n\n01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:00.320\nOkay.\n\n01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:05.080\nI'm an expert on these things.\n\n01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:10.400\nThere is a silver flame that guides us and it will make an example of you.\n\n01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:14.600\nDo you have, do you have intimidate or diplomacy?\n\n01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:17.200\nBut isn't it, isn't it more intimidating if I don't have those things?\n\n01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:23.640\nI'm like, you know, like how many times are we the victims of a charming bully?\n\n01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:26.560\nThey usually have like bad grammar and, okay, let me look.\n\n01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:27.560\nSorry.\n\n01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:37.880\nThere's a whole stack of papers and I, I, the Mrs. and I were recently and, uh, other\n\n01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:48.760\nside, uh, looking for intimidate diplomacy, no, that's a zero and, uh, diplomacy.\n\n01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:49.760\nThere's a check mark.\n\n01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:50.760\nOkay.\n\n01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:51.760\nGreat.\n\n01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:52.760\nUm, but no numbers.\n\n01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:53.760\nRight.\n\n01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:54.760\nDo have it.\n\n01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:55.760\nIt's just not measurable.\n\n01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:56.760\nWell, yeah.\n\n01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:00.060\nSame could be true of all of us.\n\n01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:01.560\nYou definitely scare him.\n\n01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:04.160\nHe's like, Jesus, oh boy.\n\n01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:05.960\nThat's a bad, uh, yeah.\n\n01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:06.960\nOkay.\n\n01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:08.680\nYou're at a fork in your life.\n\n01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:10.480\nYou were a bandito.\n\n01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:13.120\nNow you're a hostage.\n\n01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:18.120\nYour behavior as a hostage could lead you to the main road of humanity, something you\n\n01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:20.320\ndeparted when you became a bandito.\n\n01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:21.840\nProbably your dad's fault.\n\n01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:22.840\nOkay.\n\n01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:24.040\nI'm your new dad.\n\n01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:25.040\nI'm taking you back.\n\n01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:28.880\nYou don't have to be a hostage forever.\n\n01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:33.160\nYou could die a hostage or you could spend a time as a hostage proving that you're a\n\n01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:34.160\nhuman.\n\n01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:35.160\nAll right.\n\n01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:37.160\nOkay.\n\n01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:43.680\nIt, it's not checked and then there's a, it says total bonus and there's a three in\n\n01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:44.680\nparenthesis.\n\n01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:45.680\nPerfect.\n\n01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:50.680\nI'm that perceptive.\n\n01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:52.680\nAll right.\n\n01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:53.680\nOkay.\n\n01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:54.680\nSo now obviously, come on.\n\n01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:55.680\nHuh?\n\n01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:57.640\nYou just asked me what my perception was and now you're saying nothing.\n\n01:45:57.640 --> 01:45:58.640\nRight.\n\n01:45:58.640 --> 01:45:59.640\nWell, so how is that?\n\n01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:00.640\nI'm not, what is this?\n\n01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:02.120\nI'm paranoid now.\n\n01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:03.120\nHuh?\n\n01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:04.120\nWhat didn't I perceive?\n\n01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:05.120\nYeah.\n\n01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:06.120\nWhat didn't you perceive?\n\n01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:07.120\nI grab, I pull his hair.\n\n01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:08.640\nI go, what am I not perceiving here?\n\n01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:09.640\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:10.640\nWhat are you doing?\n\n01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:11.640\nI look at his hand.\n\n01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:12.640\nHe swallows hard.\n\n01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:13.640\nWhat?\n\n01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:15.400\nYou dirty, shitty person.\n\n01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:16.400\nI walk over.\n\n01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:17.400\nI, I have 11 perception.\n\n01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:18.400\nLet me try.\n\n01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:20.840\nHey, Carlos, what are we trying to perceive?\n\n01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:22.340\nHe swallowed something.\n\n01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:23.340\nOpen up.\n\n01:46:23.340 --> 01:46:24.340\nDrop it.\n\n01:46:24.340 --> 01:46:25.340\nDrop it.\n\n01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:26.340\nAll right.\n\n01:46:26.340 --> 01:46:27.340\nHe opens his mouth.\n\n01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:28.340\nI reach in and pull his jaw open.\n\n01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:29.340\nYeah.\n\n01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:30.340\nYeah.\n\n01:46:30.340 --> 01:46:31.340\nYeah.\n\n01:46:31.340 --> 01:46:32.340\nI would pull it, drop it.\n\n01:46:32.340 --> 01:46:33.340\nDrop it.\n\n01:46:33.340 --> 01:46:34.340\nHe didn't have anything in his mouth.\n\n01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:35.940\nHe just swallowed nervously, I think.\n\n01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:39.140\nHe wasn't swallowing the microfilm.\n\n01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:45.740\nAlternately, if you swallow something, it no longer remains in your mouth.\n\n01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:48.340\nI, I, I punch him in the stomach.\n\n01:46:48.340 --> 01:46:49.340\nAll right.\n\n01:46:49.340 --> 01:46:53.220\nI'm trying to, I, I, I, I, I have induced vomit.\n\n01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:58.260\nGive him a Heimlich, like, like, like, like, like, hold him upside down, go old school\n\n01:46:58.260 --> 01:46:59.260\non this guy.\n\n01:46:59.260 --> 01:47:00.260\nAll right.\n\n01:47:00.260 --> 01:47:03.340\nWell, you punch him in the stomach, but it doesn't make him throw up.\n\n01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:04.460\nHe just takes a couple of damage.\n\n01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:05.460\nHe swallowed some.\n\n01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:06.460\nAll right.\n\n01:47:06.460 --> 01:47:07.460\nWell, it doesn't, you know what?\n\n01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:08.460\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:09.460\nI only brought him over here for one thing.\n\n01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:10.460\nIt's not like we're on an adventure where we need to know where the treasure is.\n\n01:47:10.460 --> 01:47:11.460\nI, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,\n\n01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:12.460\nI, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,\n\n01:47:12.460 --> 01:47:31.980\nI, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,\n\n01:47:31.980 --> 01:47:36.860\nI, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,\n\n01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:41.960\nI, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,\n\n01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:47.740\nIn what's wait. Okay. Are you gonna kill him though? Patches? No, no the guy. No, I'm gonna die\n\n01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:53.440\nHe's going to die. I want to shake him upside down and make him cough up whatever he had. How is he going?\n\n01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:55.840\nOkay, well that doesn't work. Okay. I\n\n01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:59.380\nInvent the Heimlich maneuvering him the Heimlich maneuver. All right\n\n01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:02.560\nWell, yeah, um\n\n01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:11.400\nYeah, I see it. Yeah, I don't even know. How do you critically fail a non-Heimlich?\n\n01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:22.000\nI smash his sternum in. Well, yeah, you can hear ribs cracking as you give him the Heimlich maneuver and after way\n\n01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:31.240\nToo many attempts he finally starts to choke something up and it gets lodged in his throat and dies. Patches, Patches watch. See Patches? See?\n\n01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:34.680\nSee the will of the eternal flame?\n\n01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:40.840\nPatches is like still for a moment and then he just starts like thrashing an overdrive. It's okay\n\n01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:48.000\nI reach in and grab the thing that I kind of perceived with my 11 perception that he choked up. He choked on it\n\n01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000\nLooks like a big weird pill. Oh, I\n\n01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:58.800\nExamine the pill it looks big and weird and a little bit dissolved, but only a little tiny bit\n\n01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:04.960\nOh, so he was trying to take his own life. He was trying to like Hermann Göring his way out of not standard bandito protocol\n\n01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:10.800\nYeah, what why what do these guys have to hide they want to take their own lives? Perhaps these banditos\n\n01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:18.560\nNo more than we knows\n\n01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:25.880\nShould we search him you can sure Patchens you okay?\n\n01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:33.880\nHe's he's just screaming. He's saying I can't believe it's God. Oh my god. I have one job. Oh my god\n\n01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:37.600\nWhat is it? Oh my god? He's like he's he's clutching at you\n\n01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:42.280\nYou know like when someone's like hysterical with with with pain and agony\n\n01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:47.600\nYou don't know what they're doing like he's doing that and he's like just kind of slapping you like he's I don't know\n\n01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:54.080\nAnd you could at that some point you figure out what he's doing is he's trying to grab like a knife out of your wallet and stuff\n\n01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:57.760\nLike he's trying to grab a knife from you. Patches. Why do you want my knife? He?\n\n01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:04.560\nHe doesn't grab it. He just grabs at it. He's just like I can't handle this\n\n01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:07.320\nPatchens you got to tell me what what you lost? I\n\n01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:14.000\nHad the game I was sent to her own\n\n01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:19.280\nFor one read just to keep this thing safe. It's like I don't know what it is\n\n01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:23.720\nIt's like a treasure sacred treasure. I don't know. I don't know\n\n01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:30.600\nWhat does it look like? It's like a like the it's like a big big gem like the most beautiful jewel you've ever seen\n\n01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:38.600\nAnd all I was supposed to do was just lay low and you know hide and I figured after there was all those boogins\n\n01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:41.220\nI should probably relocate but fuck wait\n\n01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:44.080\nDid one of the banditos just take that jewel that you had on you?\n\n01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:50.000\nWell, my clothes is gone and I'm stamped up. We gotta get those banditos. I thought this was just a\n\n01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:57.320\nPantons, why don't you tell us you had precious jewel treasures on you before the boogins came up because I'm not supposed to tell anybody\n\n01:50:57.320 --> 01:51:03.160\nThat's part of the whole thing. If I you couldn't steal it. You could be you know agents of shield\n\n01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:12.520\nI I grabbed the bandito that's that's that's there just it was he dead that one that was the choking one\n\n01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:17.800\nYeah, he's dead. Yeah, are there any live live banditos? There's one. That's of indeterminate status\n\n01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:20.280\nHe's he's he's got a caved-in helmet. I\n\n01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:27.480\nI search him to see if he's got the jet the jet the other guys ran off of the jet right for sure. Yeah\n\n01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:30.920\nSo we fucked I search I search that guy anyway\n\n01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:37.880\nYeah, okay, you search him you find what do you find you find under his regular bandito clothes\n\n01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:43.400\nHe has very finely crafted stuttered leather armor. It's very quiet and stealthy\n\n01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:48.040\nIt seems like it was meant to be hidden underneath normal clothes. What size is he?\n\n01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:53.000\nUh, he's a human. He's a human. Yeah, a little big for me. Yeah, shit\n\n01:51:53.240 --> 01:52:00.520\nAnd then you also see a dagger. He's got a dagger and a short sword and they both seem of incredibly fine make like\n\n01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:06.200\nLike master work weapons. You don't even know who made them, but it was a real real master\n\n01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:11.880\nWell, I'm small. I take that dagger and I give this who wants this awesome sword. You guys are sword peoples\n\n01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:18.200\nI don't I don't use blades. I'm gonna. I will check the dead guy. I want to see if that's the same thing\n\n01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:22.200\nAre these guys all like this? Um, yeah, you search him too and you get the same thing\n\n01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:28.600\nSo I didn't quite finish so I'll just so there's also a poison pill in the one who didn't take a poison pills\n\n01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:35.720\nPake and then one of them has a little note, but it's it's like with like script and symbols and runes and stuff\n\n01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:41.640\nIt's it doesn't seem like any written language. It seems like a code except to someone with knowledge arcana\n\n01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:50.200\nIt's clearly not magical. It's uh, it's just uh, it's just a normal code knowledge history\n\n01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:54.280\nDo you how many points do you have a knowledge history?\n\n01:52:55.240 --> 01:52:57.080\nIt's a check mark, but\n\n01:52:57.080 --> 01:52:58.440\nBut no points\n\n01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:08.200\nOkay, you recognize it is it seems to use a basic a basic standard of symbology used in uh, the guilds for trading purposes\n\n01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:11.560\nSo it's like a symbology a symbolic language. That's not\n\n01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:18.120\nExactly like for speaking. It's not like the you know, it's not common or anything. It's just like its own language\n\n01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:24.360\nBut that's the only thing you only recognize the symbols like you don't actually know what they mean and you couldn't read it\n\n01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:29.160\nIf you wanted knowledge, nobility\n\n01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:32.120\nAll right\n\n01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:33.960\nnobility\n\n01:53:33.960 --> 01:53:36.120\nOccasionally learns that symbol language\n\n01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:40.440\nKnowledge religions\n\n01:53:42.760 --> 01:53:46.120\nSome religions disagree with that symbol language\n\n01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.680\nLinguistics, but I don't think you have knowledge linguistics. I do\n\n01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:53.240\ncheck mark\n\n01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:56.840\nDo you have any points in it? No, I don't point to any of this shit\n\n01:53:57.720 --> 01:53:59.720\na fucking second third level\n\n01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:01.640\nfucking\n\n01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:03.640\nlike look it's\n\n01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:05.960\nI know this this language\n\n01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:09.400\nIt's a trading language\n\n01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:11.400\nThese people aren't banditos\n\n01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:13.400\nThey're stock brokers\n\n01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:18.600\nI I take that dagger I take the symbols written on a note\n\n01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:26.600\nUh, yeah, okay. I take that note and then I take the poison pill and I put it in his mouth\n\n01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:31.000\nAnd then I say where are your friends staying?\n\n01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:34.120\nAnd I won't make you swallow this pill\n\n01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:40.360\nWho are you saying that to the guy to the bandito? Which one the one that's not dead. They're both dead. They're both dead\n\n01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:43.720\nI take his dagger to stab him eight times\n\n01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:50.200\nOh, man, it's no good. I'm just just testing out the strength of the dagger. It's it slides through easily\n\n01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:53.240\nas if it's\n\n01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:58.600\nMagically sharp these guys weren't regular banditos and they've got they've got patches precious gem\n\n01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:01.720\nYeah, but we've also got a sick diarrhea on right?\n\n01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:05.000\nHe's dying over here. He's got that mist\n\n01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:10.440\nI think the mist went into the keyhole in his heart and he's infected with some sort of horrible demonic business\n\n01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:16.040\nYeah, we got we got to get him to the church.
