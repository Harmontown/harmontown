WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.200
Welcome once again, one and all, Mademoiselle and the other guys, from Uptown, Uptown Burbank,

00:16.200 --> 00:28.400
the beautiful part of Uptown Burbank, Harmontown is now in session.

00:28.400 --> 00:41.600
Would you please join me in welcoming the Game Master of your dreams, Spencer Crittenden.

00:41.600 --> 00:49.640
And the fuzziest mayor of all time, you love him, Dan Harmon.

00:49.640 --> 00:50.640
Thank you.

00:50.640 --> 00:51.640
Thank you very much.

00:51.640 --> 01:03.880
Let's bring this town hall meeting to order, that's the conceit of the show.

01:03.880 --> 01:08.960
First order of business, when will we get to the moon?

01:08.960 --> 01:12.640
Remember that premise that never came to fruition?

01:12.640 --> 01:17.520
Well, you mean we didn't build a rocket ship, is that what's...

01:17.520 --> 01:22.120
I don't know, I feel like now isn't that more important than ever to get the hell off of

01:22.120 --> 01:26.840
this horrible planet that wants to kill us?

01:26.840 --> 01:34.320
Yeah, yeah, but in order to do it we'd have to work with hundreds of people that I now

01:34.320 --> 01:42.160
don't like, like I think we missed our deadline, it's like the Tower of Babel, like humanity's

01:42.160 --> 01:43.160
been disbanded.

01:43.160 --> 01:49.400
I just, I'm a lone wolf now.

01:49.400 --> 01:59.520
I'm like that wolf that Tom Cruise saw in that movie, lone wolf.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.800
The movie was not called, what was your guess, the lone wolf?

02:02.800 --> 02:03.800
No, no.

02:03.800 --> 02:04.800
That would be great.

02:04.800 --> 02:05.800
Was it called Wolf?

02:05.800 --> 02:06.800
No.

02:06.800 --> 02:09.000
Wolf of Wall Street.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Nope.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.760
These are all famous movies that are famous for not starring Tom Cruise, except for Spencer's

02:16.760 --> 02:19.920
guess which is a non-existent movie.

02:19.920 --> 02:23.880
That would be the movie you'd expect him to see a lone wolf in when he's a lone wolf.

02:23.880 --> 02:24.880
Would it though?

02:24.880 --> 02:25.880
Was it?

02:25.880 --> 02:26.880
Was it?

02:26.880 --> 02:30.320
That happens and then it's like lone wolf and then the credits roll.

02:30.320 --> 02:32.840
It's like a three minute movie.

02:32.840 --> 02:34.960
I know what it is, I know what it is.

02:34.960 --> 02:37.880
It was Wolfie McGuire.

02:37.880 --> 02:46.880
Why wouldn't the breakfast club be about a sandwich with egg on it?

02:46.880 --> 02:52.880
Why wouldn't the title be a guy falls through a ceiling while trying to go get his weed

02:52.880 --> 02:53.880
from his locker?

02:53.880 --> 02:57.000
That would be a terrible title for breakfast club, but.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.800
A great title for weed locker.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.800
Weed locker is, yeah.

03:01.800 --> 03:06.440
But that was about the Iraq war, I think.

03:06.440 --> 03:15.440
That's Doug Benson's indie comedy movie, that's where he shoots it in the Angelus Desert.

03:15.440 --> 03:18.040
Is there an Angelus Desert?

03:18.040 --> 03:19.040
There's a forest.

03:19.040 --> 03:21.200
Okay, but next to it is there any sand?

03:21.200 --> 03:23.800
Yeah, you go inland a couple miles.

03:23.800 --> 03:26.000
Okay, and the trees run out and there's no ocean.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.840
Yeah, now you're in Angelus Desert.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.440
Now you're talking Angelus Desert.

03:30.440 --> 03:34.440
Or you just hit like, I don't know, Nevada.

03:34.440 --> 03:40.400
Maybe I should have said Nevada, but it's like a $1 million comedy, you know, like they

03:40.400 --> 03:43.560
got some investors, but it's like they're pretending that it's about Doug Benson being

03:43.560 --> 03:45.560
an Iraq and it's called the weed locker.

03:45.560 --> 03:56.280
I just wanted to finish my pitch, although I agree with you, the movie sells itself.

03:56.280 --> 03:58.040
What is a Tom Cruise movie you're talking about?

03:58.040 --> 04:02.840
Oh, you'd see him, he's a gray-haired hitman in the back of a Wayne's Brothers, no.

04:02.840 --> 04:05.200
Who's a what?

04:05.200 --> 04:06.200
Racist.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.200
Racist.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.200
Wait, who was it?

04:08.200 --> 04:09.200
Who's Jamie Foxx?

04:09.200 --> 04:10.200
Jamie Foxx?

04:10.200 --> 04:11.200
Caladero.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.200
Wait, what?

04:12.200 --> 04:13.200
Jamie Caladero.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.200
Jamie Caladero.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.200
Oh, I thought you were telling me his name.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.200
I'm like, I'm not that often.

04:16.200 --> 04:20.320
That person's name I do not know.

04:20.320 --> 04:23.240
That person sounds like he won an Oscar.

04:23.240 --> 04:25.320
Hwadarwa.

04:25.320 --> 04:27.320
And the winner is Hwadara.

04:27.320 --> 04:37.560
Hwadara is winning his first Oscar and will soon be a cab driver.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.880
We'll take it up with white society, you pricks.

04:39.880 --> 04:45.720
Someone's looking at me, I'm not the fucking one that's the cause of this.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.680
That poor guy in the, what's that movie called?

04:47.680 --> 04:52.000
Captain, my captain, I'm the captain now.

04:52.000 --> 05:01.480
Poe society, that's the only old captain, my captain, Poe society called, I'm the captain

05:01.480 --> 05:07.600
now, captain, desk standards, with an exclamation point.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.840
I found my, look what I found.

05:09.840 --> 05:15.240
Oh, a lot of you, a lot of you plebes don't know what these are because, I meant to bring

05:15.240 --> 05:16.240
you mine, I forgot.

05:16.240 --> 05:19.520
Ear pods, my ear pods.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.840
These guys are going to be gone in like 48 hours.

05:22.840 --> 05:23.840
No way, man.

05:23.840 --> 05:27.000
I'm never going to lose you, baby, again.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.040
Where'd you even find those anyway?

05:29.040 --> 05:33.880
He put them in, he's dancing like he's already playing music on them and I know that's not

05:33.880 --> 05:34.880
how it works.

05:34.880 --> 05:42.800
I'm dancing like Brad Pitt in Fight Club when he runs around the corner with, what's

05:42.800 --> 05:43.800
your name?

05:43.800 --> 05:46.800
Tim Burton's wife.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.960
Sorry ladies.

05:48.960 --> 05:51.360
Everything she does can unobjectify her.

05:51.360 --> 05:54.400
She's still just some guy's wife.

05:54.400 --> 06:00.040
Helen Abonham Carter, and he drags her around the corner and then he just starts going like

06:00.040 --> 06:06.640
this because the cops run by because if you're dancing in a junkie hallway, you're not who

06:06.640 --> 06:07.640
they're looking for.

06:07.640 --> 06:13.520
This is the only time I would say it was better to not pay the $5 a month for the live streams

06:13.520 --> 06:16.520
so they didn't have to see that dance.

06:16.520 --> 06:19.720
They might have saved themselves the trouble on that one.

06:19.720 --> 06:23.440
To answer your question, Spencer, you found them in your car.

06:23.440 --> 06:24.440
What?

06:24.440 --> 06:25.440
Yeah.

06:25.440 --> 06:26.440
Crazy.

06:26.440 --> 06:32.200
Why did I know that?

06:32.200 --> 06:47.400
So I was in the, it's not a hospital, it's a surgery center, trying to see if I can take

06:47.400 --> 06:48.400
care of that.

06:48.400 --> 06:54.080
They put a camera down my throat again because, okay, this is a little crazy.

06:54.080 --> 07:00.120
You know, I have a chronic heartburn, I can't imagine why.

07:00.120 --> 07:08.760
I've been searching and searching for a way to mitigate the burning pain in my esophagus.

07:08.760 --> 07:16.760
The first time I went, they looked down my cake tunnel and they found some polyps and

07:16.760 --> 07:23.120
they grabbed them and sent them off to a lab to see if they were cancer polyps.

07:23.120 --> 07:30.480
Then they said, oh, your digestive system looks great and I can't even, what the fuck,

07:30.480 --> 07:34.360
were they looking for that time because then they said, I'm getting so upset just thinking

07:34.360 --> 07:38.360
about it because I was, I told you last time, I was a little upset in the last episode,

07:38.360 --> 07:43.280
you might have noticed the tonal shift here, I'm a little calmer now.

07:43.280 --> 07:47.280
You were on some pretty heavy-duty painkillers, they give you for that, are you still floating

07:47.280 --> 07:48.280
on those or is that over?

07:48.280 --> 07:51.960
How I feel like it, but they tell you don't make any business decisions today, no matter

07:51.960 --> 08:01.400
that's what they say, which is kind of delightful, I was like, I cancel my calls, smithers.

08:01.400 --> 08:05.320
Don't call North Korea until tomorrow.

08:05.320 --> 08:09.840
Don't address any Boy Scouts for God's sake.

08:09.840 --> 08:15.320
You might not be in a proper frame of mind to hold the stitching of society together.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.680
Mind your peas and queues, sir.

08:18.680 --> 08:22.640
Don't go off on a psychotropic substance stumbling into society.

08:22.640 --> 08:24.840
You might end up elected president.

08:24.840 --> 08:27.440
All right.

08:27.440 --> 08:31.680
Don't have half a brain when you just run out into the street shouting whenever you're

08:31.680 --> 08:33.880
feeling.

08:33.880 --> 08:39.040
You'll get rewarded for it endlessly and then die while killing everyone.

08:39.040 --> 08:41.320
You wouldn't want that, Mr. Harmon.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.440
Goodbye, want some cheez-its?

08:43.440 --> 08:45.720
They gave me cheez-its.

08:45.720 --> 08:52.480
Just the one thing is, after you wake up, you're super high.

08:52.480 --> 08:58.720
It's kind of an intimidating thing to be rolled into a room where they don't design surgery

08:58.720 --> 09:04.760
rooms to be, they wouldn't want fluffy pillows in there and stuff with hair on them.

09:04.760 --> 09:10.000
The comfort goes hand-in-hand with non-sterility.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
You wouldn't want beanbags in your room or oil paintings and the oil's going to get

09:15.000 --> 09:17.080
in your body.

09:17.080 --> 09:25.760
It's like a grody, creepy jigsaw room, but clean, but still sociopathic and just beeping

09:25.760 --> 09:29.040
and you can hear your heart beeping and then when you hear your heart beeping, it starts

09:29.040 --> 09:33.040
beeping faster and then you try to experiment with lowering it because you think you're

09:33.040 --> 09:37.360
going to blow their mind and go like, who are you?

09:37.360 --> 09:46.680
You feel like I'm just seeing an eagle in the sky, but then they start this fucking thing

09:46.680 --> 09:52.600
through the IV and this time they didn't even say, count down from 10 to 1, they just didn't

09:52.600 --> 10:00.360
even give a fuck and I was like, boom, you're out and you're instantly awake, nothing happens.

10:00.360 --> 10:04.880
It's not like being asleep where you have this weird consciousness of time, it's like

10:04.880 --> 10:09.600
a cut and then you're in a different room and no one else is there because they left

10:09.600 --> 10:14.040
your ass because you're boring because you have been knocked out.

10:14.040 --> 10:17.920
You feel abandoned because you're like, wait, everybody left, but it's like, no, we were

10:17.920 --> 10:21.520
all here with you, we rolled you like the furniture you are into a corner after we cut

10:21.520 --> 10:25.280
some polyps out of your stomach, fucking chill out when you start babbling like a maniac,

10:25.280 --> 10:27.560
we'll come back and give you cheez-its.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.800
Why is cheez-its the goat's neck?

10:29.800 --> 10:33.640
I don't know, but why do they follow the bag of cheez-its with a lecture about why you're

10:33.640 --> 10:34.640
fat?

10:34.640 --> 10:41.760
I never said the phrase, you guys gave me the cheez-its so many times today because they

10:41.760 --> 10:45.320
kept coming in and they're like, you want some cheez-its?

10:45.320 --> 10:48.240
I'm like, yes?

10:48.240 --> 10:50.040
Am I in heaven?

10:50.040 --> 10:53.800
And then the cheez-its are like, okay, the doctor will be right in and then another person

10:53.800 --> 10:58.360
comes in and goes like, Mr. Harmon, listen, we didn't find anything in there that's not

10:58.360 --> 11:04.800
the result of a guy your age having gained your amount of weight.

11:04.800 --> 11:06.800
You guys gave me the cheez-its.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.440
No, I know, sir.

11:08.440 --> 11:09.440
I just sang.

11:09.440 --> 11:12.120
It just kept happening, like different people kept coming in.

11:12.120 --> 11:14.960
Did they give you the airport-sized bag of those or like a big bag?

11:14.960 --> 11:20.160
It was a little baby bag, but I just kind of felt like maybe if I wasn't eating cheez-its

11:20.160 --> 11:24.840
with crumbs all over my face that maybe they would have laid off the fat lectures a little

11:24.840 --> 11:29.960
bit because at least, I'm not saying I would have looked thinner with now, oh, cheez-its

11:29.960 --> 11:35.800
in my hand, but maybe they would have thought like, well, he must not know that he's fat.

11:35.800 --> 11:39.960
For all we know, he started his diet yesterday, let's not fuck with him too much, but they

11:39.960 --> 11:40.960
were like, dude, you're fat.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.720
I'm like, you gave me cheez-its.

11:42.720 --> 11:49.040
Yeah, maybe trail mix, maybe something not so fatty, like a cluster all the way.

11:49.040 --> 11:53.680
Well, now that you're pitching that, I'm like, fuck, no, that would be awful, that would

11:53.680 --> 11:54.680
be awful.

11:54.680 --> 12:00.720
Yeah, but you would feel like you were in a hospital, not a trail mix.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.720
What would be a good hospital?

12:01.720 --> 12:04.440
Like, I don't know, it'd be like a Robocop paste, you know, they'd be like-

12:04.440 --> 12:05.440
Yeah, it's applesauce.

12:05.440 --> 12:06.440
Yeah, applesauce.

12:06.440 --> 12:11.280
It would be like in one of those paper containers that when you finish, you can unfold it and

12:11.280 --> 12:13.080
turn it into a yamaka.

12:13.080 --> 12:17.520
But there must be some sort of scientific reason, like is it because of the salts, the fats,

12:17.520 --> 12:19.320
like the things that you were depruted?

12:19.320 --> 12:22.000
Yeah, I'm sure they were like, yeah, I'm sure they were.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Or it's just big cheez-its.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Big cheez-its.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
They were like, what the fuck are they involved?

12:25.000 --> 12:30.440
Yeah, they got like depribulators with the cheez-it brands, depribulators, there's station

12:30.440 --> 12:34.160
areas like cheez-it, station area, they're like, what's going on here?

12:34.160 --> 12:38.000
And you leave your hospital, you call it not a hospital, and you realize that you were

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
just at Nabisco the whole time.

12:40.000 --> 12:46.600
Yeah, you look back, because you hear one squeaky hinge, and you look back and the stage

12:46.600 --> 12:53.400
hands are hoisting the flat, it's like, God, isn't a giant box of crackers.

12:53.400 --> 12:57.400
I was in the Kiebler Elf Tree, and they were all on stilts.

12:57.400 --> 13:01.880
I told you, I went under general anesthesia once for my wisdom teeth, and I woke up and

13:01.880 --> 13:05.760
something horrible had happened, like there was a footprint on my chest and my belt was

13:05.760 --> 13:06.760
off.

13:06.760 --> 13:07.760
I've been under three times.

13:07.760 --> 13:12.680
And the doctor wasn't there, and I asked the woman, like the nurse, I was like, where

13:12.680 --> 13:13.680
is the doctor?

13:13.680 --> 13:14.680
He left.

13:14.680 --> 13:15.680
Like, when?

13:15.680 --> 13:16.680
When?

13:16.680 --> 13:23.000
It was like a couple of hours ago, I'm like, what's up, like, was, did everything,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.800
did all my teeth come out okay?

13:25.800 --> 13:29.160
It was a struggle.

13:29.160 --> 13:31.480
My belt, my belt was off.

13:31.480 --> 13:36.920
I went to sleep with my belt on, and I tell you, fucking for sure, and then she showed

13:36.920 --> 13:42.000
me my teeth in a cup, and it looked like they had gone hammer and chisel on those motherfuckers,

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
because they had.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.560
And then I go home, and my friend drove me home, because you have to have somebody to

13:47.560 --> 13:55.760
drive you home, because you're high as a kite, and I go home, I have to get my prescription

13:55.760 --> 13:56.760
card.

13:56.760 --> 13:59.240
Have I told the story before on the show?

13:59.240 --> 14:01.280
I can't remember.

14:01.280 --> 14:02.280
We've both gotten this.

14:02.280 --> 14:03.280
I have.

14:03.280 --> 14:04.280
Early on?

14:04.280 --> 14:05.280
Come on.

14:05.280 --> 14:06.280
What did you think, though?

14:06.280 --> 14:07.280
It's kind of like gremlins, too.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.280
You want to see it again.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.280
You're not sure.

14:09.280 --> 14:19.880
You're like, wasn't there like a trans gremlin in that movie that transitioned and was like

14:19.880 --> 14:20.880
kissing other gremlins?

14:20.880 --> 14:22.200
I can't remember.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.240
I think we need to watch it again.

14:24.240 --> 14:28.960
The only funny part for me was that I went to go get my insurance, like my prescription

14:28.960 --> 14:32.360
card, and then while I was up, that was so high, I thought, oh, I'm going to take some

14:32.360 --> 14:33.360
trash out.

14:33.360 --> 14:35.840
So I threw my prescription card out with the trash.

14:35.840 --> 14:37.840
Yeah, that is the funniest.

14:37.840 --> 14:41.720
And then I got to the place, and now the paint colors are wearing off.

14:41.720 --> 14:42.720
I'm dying.

14:42.720 --> 14:47.360
We had to go figure out where my thing was, and I was just now not high enough to remember

14:47.360 --> 14:49.520
to dig through my trash and find the fucking thing.

14:49.520 --> 14:53.080
Yeah, that's why they wouldn't let me take an Uber from the place.

14:53.080 --> 14:59.600
Also, they said it's sexist, and you should take a left, but they wouldn't let me take

14:59.600 --> 15:05.080
an Uber because they were like, oh, you have to be like a limo service that we have a relationship

15:05.080 --> 15:10.040
with, and I'm like, OK, the Cheez-It transit company, maybe?

15:10.040 --> 15:11.040
Cheez-Wheels?

15:11.040 --> 15:12.040
Your car is Cheez-It.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.040
The fucking wheels are square.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.040
It gets shitty mileage.

15:14.040 --> 15:18.040
It's shaped like a trisket.

15:18.040 --> 15:19.720
The salty, salty rover.

15:19.720 --> 15:24.520
They shouldn't be giving you fucking Cheez-Its after you've had a surgery.

15:24.520 --> 15:25.520
That's crazy.

15:25.520 --> 15:28.240
Well, the customer's always right, man.

15:28.240 --> 15:30.760
I think at that point, they're like, we put a camera down your throat.

15:30.760 --> 15:31.760
You survived.

15:31.760 --> 15:32.760
Eat one bag of crackers.

15:32.760 --> 15:33.760
Did you get to see the camera?

15:33.760 --> 15:36.320
Do you get to look at the apparatus before it goes down your gut?

15:36.320 --> 15:38.960
They don't show you the, I'm sure I could have asked.

15:38.960 --> 15:41.640
I don't think they probably want you to see it, though.

15:41.640 --> 15:45.160
I was kind of like, I could have asked this time because I kind of like, this was like

15:45.160 --> 15:50.760
my third time going, you know, I had an endoscopy and then I had a biopsy for the sarcoid thing,

15:50.760 --> 15:54.800
and then this was my second time going under in a lightweight, you know, so like this isn't

15:54.800 --> 15:55.800
even like surgery.

15:55.800 --> 15:58.840
This is just like, so I was like, I was fucking Bill Murray and that shit.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.320
I was like, they're wheeling me in.

16:00.320 --> 16:05.440
I'm like, hey, Glenda, how's it going, still looking good?

16:05.440 --> 16:14.040
My name's Diane and that isn't funny anymore, just pointing at women and sexualizing them.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.760
That was, you were a hero in the 80s, if you did that.

16:16.760 --> 16:18.760
Sorry, I'm 44.

16:18.760 --> 16:24.520
I know, I've seen your x-rays, but they, like, you know, doctor, doctor, doctor, what's

16:24.520 --> 16:28.720
his fuck, he's like, hey, Dan, welcome back.

16:28.720 --> 16:29.720
It's good to be back.

16:29.720 --> 16:34.600
I was like, I was like a real charmer, you know, but I get like a hair net on him, man,

16:34.600 --> 16:35.800
I'm like, it's good to be back.

16:35.800 --> 16:39.520
I'm like, this guy thinks he's in some kind of lounge.

16:39.520 --> 16:40.680
I was cool, man.

16:40.680 --> 16:43.320
I wasn't getting a lot of laughs, but I was like funny.

16:43.320 --> 16:46.560
I just think doctors, like, I just think I wouldn't want them to be cracking up because

16:46.560 --> 16:47.720
then it'd be like, these guys are shakeable.

16:47.720 --> 16:49.560
Like, I don't want that.

16:49.560 --> 16:55.440
They're focused on their craft, but I know I was being funny.

16:55.440 --> 16:58.680
They have like, they probably have like an orientation video where they're like, look,

16:58.680 --> 17:02.240
some of your patients, you're in Los Angeles, some of your patients are going to be crackups,

17:02.240 --> 17:03.240
you know?

17:03.240 --> 17:06.800
Like they're going to be talented people, like crazy geniuses, you know?

17:06.800 --> 17:11.280
Some of them are going to have a gift for moving the human heart.

17:11.280 --> 17:15.240
You got to, like, trust me, as much as it seems like they would love for you to break

17:15.240 --> 17:23.000
into gales of frivolity, as much as it would be involuntary, truly, given their hilarity

17:23.000 --> 17:28.680
acumen, just keep a stiff upper lip.

17:28.680 --> 17:34.880
They probably do things like, you know, like, soldier guys, like, they, like, they like

17:34.880 --> 17:35.880
expit.

17:35.880 --> 17:43.120
They, like, you know, why did I, the only thing, I'm going to try to make this specific.

17:43.120 --> 17:46.360
I'll just make them men.

17:46.360 --> 17:49.000
You went way out of your way to make them men.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.720
That was the final result, but that was not the intention.

17:50.720 --> 17:56.240
I was trying to, I was, I was like, God, come on, Tom Clancy, do it.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.400
Soldier guys.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.600
Now it sounds like you've been in the military.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.560
Uh, I, you know, like-

18:02.560 --> 18:04.080
Also, when you said surgery room.

18:04.080 --> 18:07.680
Infantry, I was, I think I was searching for infantry and came up with soldier guys.

18:07.680 --> 18:11.680
You can't turn soldier into infantry, if soldier infantry, you'll sound like an idiot.

18:11.680 --> 18:16.520
I went soldier guys, I fucking saved it.

18:16.520 --> 18:19.760
In their training, one of the things they have to do, or I saw I've seen in movies,

18:19.760 --> 18:23.880
is that they, you know, or like they, they expose you to tear gas, right?

18:23.880 --> 18:27.240
Like, or, you know, whatever you're using on other people, they're like, take off your

18:27.240 --> 18:28.240
gas mask.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.760
You know, you've seen that scene in the movies and they, you got to, like, sit there and

18:30.760 --> 18:32.800
take the fucking tear gas.

18:32.800 --> 18:37.080
They probably do, they, they have to do that with comedy in the operating room.

18:37.080 --> 18:42.120
They have to hear all the dumb semi sedated jokes that they're going to hear.

18:42.120 --> 18:49.840
They have to watch, like, season two of Community.

18:49.840 --> 18:53.400
I was gonna, you know, when I started that sentence, I was gonna say, like, the British

18:53.400 --> 18:54.400
office.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.640
But then I was like, I think that was one season.

18:56.640 --> 19:01.920
And then I was like, do Parks and Rec, and then I was like, fuck it.

19:01.920 --> 19:05.000
Write what you know.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.920
I, I still, I still on the line that Greg Proops uses every time for the last 30 years

19:08.920 --> 19:11.120
at his dentist he's been going to forever.

19:11.120 --> 19:15.280
But every time he gets in the chair, every time the dentist asks him, are you comfortable?

19:15.280 --> 19:21.680
And Greg always says, I make a living.

19:21.680 --> 19:22.840
That's always a goodie.

19:22.840 --> 19:25.040
But it's funnier if you're an old Jewish comic.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.040
I said, I make a living.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.840
He has a little exchange I had.

19:27.840 --> 19:28.840
I'm no Greg Proops.

19:28.840 --> 19:30.360
But he said, he said, welcome back.

19:30.360 --> 19:31.360
I said, it's good to be back.

19:31.360 --> 19:33.480
And he said, how, how are you feeling?

19:33.480 --> 19:34.800
And I said, I said, great.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.560
I just had a huge sandwich.

19:36.560 --> 19:39.960
And because they, you're not supposed to eat for like eight hours because they're

19:39.960 --> 19:41.560
going to go in there.

19:41.560 --> 19:43.040
And he's like, oh, thanks for telling us.

19:43.040 --> 19:48.760
I said, look, if you found a sandwich in the bathroom, you'd eat it too.

19:48.760 --> 19:49.760
These are good jokes.

19:49.760 --> 19:50.760
Yeah.

19:50.760 --> 19:51.760
These are good jokes.

19:51.760 --> 19:52.760
And they're stone-faced.

19:52.760 --> 19:54.920
And it's not because I'm not funny.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.520
It's because they're good doctors.

19:57.520 --> 20:01.040
They want me to stay alive, make more people happy.

20:01.040 --> 20:07.600
Why don't we make your next HBO special, just you on a gurney?

20:07.600 --> 20:12.200
And you're really letting the doctor staff have it.

20:12.200 --> 20:16.280
You're making light of what could potentially be a fatal thing that's going on here.

20:16.280 --> 20:17.280
I could.

20:17.280 --> 20:18.280
They always have to tell you.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.280
They feel like they've got to tell you.

20:19.280 --> 20:22.560
There's like a point zero one chance you'll wake up and choke on the camera and die.

20:22.560 --> 20:27.680
Isn't that crazy that they put a camera down your throat and like, if you were to wake

20:27.680 --> 20:31.080
up, it's like, it's exactly like Wiley Coyote, like when he runs off the edge of the cliff.

20:31.080 --> 20:35.560
As long as he doesn't just fucking stay in the zone Wiley, like, like you could just,

20:35.560 --> 20:39.600
the time it took for you to mug to the camera and hold up a sign that says, Yikes, you could

20:39.600 --> 20:41.240
have made it to the other cliff.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.440
You can technically fly.

20:42.440 --> 20:45.440
You just have to be less self-aware.

20:45.440 --> 20:52.400
If you have a camera down your throat, they can just churn you like a butter bucket.

20:52.400 --> 21:02.520
They can just churn you like the fuselage on a butter churn.

21:02.520 --> 21:09.880
But if you were to wake up, simply wake up, you'd be like, and you'd immediately die.

21:09.880 --> 21:13.160
Because there's a camera down your throat because if you were in a bar fight, that's

21:13.160 --> 21:15.160
a way to kill you.

21:15.160 --> 21:24.280
You have a bar fight in like an EV room, like a bar fight with like filmmakers.

21:24.280 --> 21:29.200
Why was my belt off and why didn't they put it back on?

21:29.200 --> 21:33.960
What message were they trying to send me, like, no, no, leave it off, leave it off.

21:33.960 --> 21:38.360
I wanted to know exactly what the emotional crisis I went through.

21:38.360 --> 21:42.880
If the doctor was in the room, it would just be like, kind of like, oh, was I, you know,

21:42.880 --> 21:46.480
it's like, it's almost not funny because it's just sort of like, oh, what happened.

21:46.480 --> 21:49.720
But the fact that the doctor's got makes it funny to me because it's like, this is a story

21:49.720 --> 21:53.800
happened and he was like, I need some space.

21:53.800 --> 21:57.840
And then she's like, I want to start sexually assaulting other patients.

21:57.840 --> 22:00.960
It's like ordinary people now that are like, she's hold, she's trying to hold it together

22:00.960 --> 22:02.440
and like, where did the doctor go?

22:02.440 --> 22:05.120
He'll be back when he, when you have calmed down.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.120
Yes.

22:06.120 --> 22:07.120
Yes.

22:07.120 --> 22:08.120
He's staying at Shutter's for three weekends now.

22:08.120 --> 22:09.120
He's going to sleep.

22:09.120 --> 22:12.440
She's like, he'll be back later and then she's like cleaning some tools and then like,

22:12.440 --> 22:16.360
20 seconds goes by and she goes, you know, he's a good doctor and he works hard.

22:16.360 --> 22:20.720
And you're like, what the fuck?

22:20.720 --> 22:23.560
So he's allowed to grab, to play with my dick.

22:23.560 --> 22:24.800
Is that what you think happened?

22:24.800 --> 22:28.440
But then the thing, the thing that they tell you when you're getting, I had all four wisdom

22:28.440 --> 22:32.480
teeth that way too late in life and they said that there's a chance that a whole, it stopped

22:32.480 --> 22:36.640
me if I've talked about this before, there's a chance that you'll perforate the sinus bone

22:36.640 --> 22:39.560
up here above your, your teeth.

22:39.560 --> 22:40.960
And I remembered signing that thing.

22:40.960 --> 22:41.960
Oh yeah.

22:41.960 --> 22:42.960
And if it happens, it's not a big deal.

22:42.960 --> 22:43.960
Your bone will regenerate.

22:43.960 --> 22:44.960
It'll, you know, it'll be a thing.

22:44.960 --> 22:49.120
I don't remember that after the thing because I'm drugged out of my mind.

22:49.120 --> 22:51.960
The next morning I get up, rinse my mouth out.

22:51.960 --> 22:55.000
Like you're not supposed to like, like spit and do anything of violence with your sinuses.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Oh God.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.120
And I lean forward and everything in my mouth poured out of my nose because there's a hole

22:59.120 --> 23:00.360
in my face.

23:00.360 --> 23:05.960
And now everything, then I was eating some miso soup and I leaned, that night I leaned

23:05.960 --> 23:06.960
over.

23:06.960 --> 23:10.480
I leaned over to get more miso soup and the miso soup that was currently in my mouth went

23:10.480 --> 23:14.440
back into the bowl.

23:14.440 --> 23:15.440
You're like a muppet.

23:15.440 --> 23:18.440
You're like the cookie master.

23:18.440 --> 23:19.440
It's motherfucker.

23:19.440 --> 23:20.440
I don't like cookies.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.320
I was a, I was a fountain.

23:22.320 --> 23:27.080
I was a, and then I freaked out and I was like, I called the doctor and he's like, remember

23:27.080 --> 23:29.440
that we had this big conversation and it's going to be fine.

23:29.440 --> 23:30.440
I go, what do I do?

23:30.440 --> 23:33.440
He goes, just don't sneeze for two months.

23:33.440 --> 23:35.440
Fuck you.

23:35.440 --> 23:37.360
Where's my cheez-its?

23:37.360 --> 23:39.080
Where's my cheez-its?

23:39.080 --> 23:41.560
The last time you talked about this, I probably mentioned this.

23:41.560 --> 23:45.200
We're like an old married couple that both have dementia and we're just triggering each

23:45.200 --> 23:48.000
other like, oh no, the navy soup, navy.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
I was in the navy.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.720
You were in the navy.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.940
I was in the, I, I, I, I.

23:52.940 --> 23:56.360
Your story is going to be about the song Me So Horny.

23:56.360 --> 24:00.100
But there's a, there's a, there's a nerve in your upper lip.

24:00.100 --> 24:04.720
That's why in cartoons, like when Scooby-Doo's about to sneeze, Shaggy will like, like put

24:04.720 --> 24:05.720
his thing.

24:05.720 --> 24:07.040
It's like, I always thought that was so dumb.

24:07.040 --> 24:08.040
It was like, oh, you're right.

24:08.040 --> 24:11.440
But it's like, there's like a, if you push really hard on your upper lip, like if you're

24:11.440 --> 24:14.720
ever in a situation where you feel like you truly have to sneeze and like it's a do or

24:14.720 --> 24:16.280
die, like, I've done it.

24:16.280 --> 24:17.280
It works.

24:17.280 --> 24:18.280
Like you just shove really hard.

24:18.280 --> 24:19.280
It's like some kind of nerve in there.

24:19.280 --> 24:20.280
Oh well.

24:20.280 --> 24:21.280
All right.

24:21.280 --> 24:22.280
Okay.

24:22.280 --> 24:26.200
So it's not about the nose, it's about the, it's about the lip.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.200
Yeah.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.200
It's pushing on the lip.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.520
I don't know why you'd have to do it with your, with a fucking gangster style with your

24:30.520 --> 24:31.520
side of your finger.

24:31.520 --> 24:32.520
I don't know why people don't go like this.

24:32.520 --> 24:38.080
I guess because if people were coming like from behind you or in front of you, is that,

24:38.080 --> 24:39.080
is that you picking his nose?

24:39.080 --> 24:43.980
And you say you want to be like, no dude, I'm like, I'm like, I'm just doing a crazy

24:43.980 --> 24:46.480
mustache game.

24:46.480 --> 24:48.480
And then you can tell them later, sorry about lying to you.

24:48.480 --> 24:49.480
I was trying to stop sneezing.

24:49.480 --> 24:51.200
And they're like, oh cool.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.080
I thought you were trying to mine my mustache.

24:53.080 --> 24:54.080
No dude.

24:54.080 --> 24:57.280
But as, and I was like, well, shit, at least you weren't picking your nose.

24:57.280 --> 24:59.280
Like, no, and it didn't even look like it did it.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.280
No.

25:00.280 --> 25:02.840
Cause you weren't using the tip of your finger.

25:02.840 --> 25:08.560
Conversely, if you're a ninja, what I learned in Ninja magazines in the 80s is that you

25:08.560 --> 25:13.480
want to point your sword directly at your prey because it's invisible from a distance

25:13.480 --> 25:15.080
that way.

25:15.080 --> 25:16.080
Think about it.

25:16.080 --> 25:17.080
You hold your sword like this.

25:17.080 --> 25:18.080
Oh, there's a ninja.

25:18.080 --> 25:19.080
He's got a sword.

25:19.080 --> 25:20.080
Go like this.

25:20.080 --> 25:21.080
What's that ninja doing?

25:21.080 --> 25:22.080
Yeah.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.080
I'm going to kick his ass.

25:23.080 --> 25:24.080
I'm going to charge at him.

25:24.080 --> 25:32.400
I'll tell you right now, if I see a ninja in front of me and I can't tell what he's

25:32.400 --> 25:34.600
doing, I know he's doing something fucking ninja style.

25:34.600 --> 25:39.680
Well, because of the magazines, but I mean, a lot of ninjas were mad at these magazines

25:39.680 --> 25:40.680
in the 80s.

25:40.680 --> 25:45.680
Like, did you have a subscription to Ninja magazine?

25:45.680 --> 25:51.600
It was 1982 and you got one with your locker.

25:51.600 --> 25:52.600
Did I have ninja stars?

25:52.600 --> 25:53.600
I had all the ninja stars.

25:53.600 --> 25:54.600
Yeah.

25:54.600 --> 25:55.600
I mean, you could make them out of paper, right?

25:55.600 --> 25:57.120
You know how to make a ninja star out of paper.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.680
Do you millennials know how to make a ninja star out of paper?

25:59.680 --> 26:03.600
I heard some mixed messages there, but mostly no.

26:03.600 --> 26:06.200
That's something you could learn.

26:06.200 --> 26:09.600
A lethal ninja star when they could break skin?

26:09.600 --> 26:10.600
Well, no.

26:10.600 --> 26:11.600
You hit someone.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.920
As with everything, if you hit someone in the eye with it, I'm sure it could do some

26:13.920 --> 26:14.920
damage.

26:14.920 --> 26:22.280
That goes for socks, pillowcases, ferrets, popcorn, kisses, if you kiss someone in the

26:22.280 --> 26:26.560
eye really hard, you could blind them.

26:26.560 --> 26:33.240
Or you can give them mono, mono-ocleosis, that's what they call it, it's when you get

26:33.240 --> 26:35.240
it in the eye.

26:35.240 --> 26:39.440
That's just science pieces of shit.

26:39.440 --> 26:48.560
That's what the Cyclops had in the Spanish ads, the odyssey.

26:48.560 --> 26:51.200
Spencer, were you ever a weapon enthusiast?

26:51.200 --> 26:52.600
Did you have like throwing stars?

26:52.600 --> 26:53.600
Oh, yeah.

26:53.600 --> 26:54.600
Katanas?

26:54.600 --> 26:55.600
I mean, come on.

26:55.600 --> 26:57.080
Do you even have to ask?

26:57.080 --> 26:58.080
Yeah, of course.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.080
Yeah.

26:59.080 --> 27:00.080
They're just Chinatown.

27:00.080 --> 27:03.120
You could get anything, man.

27:03.120 --> 27:05.280
This guy invented seagull hunting.

27:05.280 --> 27:06.280
Yeah.

27:06.280 --> 27:11.320
Oh, that's right, by burying yourself in the sand and having a bag, what was your weapon

27:11.320 --> 27:12.320
of choice?

27:12.320 --> 27:13.640
That was in a ninja magazine.

27:13.640 --> 27:16.600
I tuned it towards seagulls.

27:16.600 --> 27:22.800
It was like retired ninja quarterly.

27:22.800 --> 27:29.200
Fulfilled your blood oath, kids moved out, try hunting some seagull.

27:29.200 --> 27:39.720
It's a great way to placate your neurotic compulsion to avenge and be invisible without

27:39.720 --> 27:43.360
pinching the pocket.

27:43.360 --> 27:46.080
I can see, Spencer, correct me if I'm wrong.

27:46.080 --> 27:50.000
I can see you as having owned at least one pair of nunchucks in your lifetime.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.080
Not nunchucks, no.

27:52.080 --> 27:53.920
Those are dangerous, man.

27:53.920 --> 27:58.440
You really got to know how to use them before they stop being dangerous to oneself.

27:58.440 --> 28:02.960
Yeah, nunchucks is the weapon that kills you before you kill you.

28:02.960 --> 28:04.960
You learn to kill somebody else with it.

28:04.960 --> 28:10.280
I think that's why in every scene in movies, that's why the person starts off with 10 minutes

28:10.280 --> 28:16.160
of nunchucking because then the person's supposed to think, god damn, that's a long time without

28:16.160 --> 28:18.480
hitting yourself in the nuts.

28:18.480 --> 28:21.680
I better get the fuck out of here.

28:21.680 --> 28:24.920
If this guy decides to hit me in the head, he might succeed.

28:24.920 --> 28:26.440
I'm fucking next.

28:26.440 --> 28:29.160
He has avoided his groin for many, many minutes.

28:29.160 --> 28:30.160
And he keeps going down.

28:30.160 --> 28:34.960
Yeah, no, he's purposely, it's like Houdini asking people to punch him in the face.

28:34.960 --> 28:39.560
He's going between the legs, hard and low trying to shit.

28:39.560 --> 28:44.200
I think we should get our guest prepared.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.200
Is she ready back there?

28:45.200 --> 28:47.400
Do I need to say that and then pause?

28:47.400 --> 28:49.520
I don't know.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.520
There's no feedback.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.280
There's no feedback loop in this show.

28:52.280 --> 28:53.280
We don't know what we're doing.

28:53.280 --> 28:56.200
I'm just flying blind.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.800
Our guest is a new friend.

28:57.800 --> 29:04.120
I met her through, I don't know, kind of strange circumstances, but they're also kind of boring

29:04.120 --> 29:11.560
circumstances because they're kind of work-related, but I was like, well, this is a person that

29:11.560 --> 29:12.560
we should meet.

29:12.560 --> 29:13.560
I don't know.

29:13.560 --> 29:16.200
I'm bad at introductions.

29:16.200 --> 29:17.200
She's a rapper.

29:17.200 --> 29:18.200
She has a bus.

29:18.200 --> 29:22.400
She's just back from Burning Man and boy, her wheels tired.

29:22.400 --> 29:26.920
Boy, her arms burnt, I think.

29:26.920 --> 29:44.560
Let's bring up B-Squid.

29:44.560 --> 29:46.200
That's the music we picked to bring you on.

29:46.200 --> 29:47.200
It's beautiful.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.200
Hello, B-Squid.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.200
Hello.

29:49.200 --> 29:53.000
B-Squid, are you a drinker?

29:53.000 --> 29:56.400
Do you want me to touch your eyes?

29:56.400 --> 29:57.400
You can touch my eyes.

29:57.400 --> 29:58.400
Do you want eyes?

29:58.400 --> 29:59.400
Yeah, I'd love some eyes.

29:59.400 --> 30:00.400
Thank you.

30:00.400 --> 30:01.400
Hey, Dan.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.000
Can I touch your eyes?

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
You want to touch my eyes?

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
I want to touch your eyes.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
You can touch my eyes.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
I'll touch hers.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.400
Let's not touch each other's eyes.

30:10.400 --> 30:11.400
Here.

30:11.400 --> 30:12.400
This is my eyes.

30:12.400 --> 30:13.400
Hand this to Jeff so he can touch it.

30:13.400 --> 30:19.400
She's subject to you guys.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.000
Yeah, you need that right now.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Thank you.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Thank you.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
What's that?

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
How did you guys meet?

30:25.000 --> 30:26.880
What's the origin story of your friendship?

30:26.880 --> 30:33.160
We met in the desert hot springs.

30:33.160 --> 30:37.960
We had both just robbed different banks and we were burying our briefcases under the same

30:37.960 --> 30:38.960
tree.

30:38.960 --> 30:45.880
Me and Cody and our mutual friend Evan were up there.

30:45.880 --> 30:49.800
I was working on this Vonnegut thing that I'm adapting with Evan, Sirens of Titan and

30:49.800 --> 30:52.920
Cody was working on her thing.

30:52.920 --> 30:56.680
We decided let's take a week and I've never tried that.

30:56.680 --> 30:57.680
Cody always does that.

30:57.680 --> 30:58.680
She gets results.

30:58.680 --> 31:02.760
She goes away like a sick cat that goes under the stove.

31:02.760 --> 31:09.320
I was like, where's the cat that comes out and goes, I wrote a draft.

31:09.320 --> 31:13.480
I was like, I want to try that.

31:13.480 --> 31:14.480
It did work.

31:14.480 --> 31:16.480
Evan and I would go out there.

31:16.480 --> 31:25.280
We got two bungalows at this resort and it's at a discount because it was so goddamn hot

31:25.280 --> 31:32.160
and you're going to the desert, they're like, if you come here, we'll give you a dollar.

31:32.160 --> 31:38.160
Then we worked for like a business week and then toward the end of it, you came up in

31:38.160 --> 31:41.400
your bus because you're friends with Evan.

31:41.400 --> 31:44.480
It's not that exciting a story, but it's also kind of like a friend of us.

31:44.480 --> 31:46.560
What kind of bus am I picturing right now?

31:46.560 --> 31:49.160
It's a short bus.

31:49.160 --> 31:50.160
It's painted blue.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.400
It says my name on the side.

31:51.400 --> 31:52.400
It says B-squid.

31:52.400 --> 31:53.400
I used it to tour in.

31:53.400 --> 31:57.080
It's where the country.

31:57.080 --> 31:59.120
You perform rapping?

31:59.120 --> 32:00.120
I rap.

32:00.120 --> 32:01.120
Yes.

32:01.120 --> 32:11.280
You do shows around the coast and inland and anywhere they'll have me.

32:11.280 --> 32:12.960
You do a lot of live performance, right?

32:12.960 --> 32:13.960
Obviously.

32:13.960 --> 32:14.960
Yeah.

32:14.960 --> 32:22.160
Are there live venues that make you more nervous or that you hate doing?

32:22.160 --> 32:23.920
Everyone is like a totally different experience.

32:23.920 --> 32:29.440
There's some that are bigger and sometimes they're fuller than others and sometimes they're

32:29.440 --> 32:34.760
kind of empty for big places and that's kind of weird, but I don't think there's anything

32:34.760 --> 32:39.120
really that makes me more nervous than anything else except for, I guess, sometimes when you're

32:39.120 --> 32:45.320
in that environment where you've got people who you care about watching and then you're

32:45.320 --> 32:47.000
really, it's really on your mind.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.840
Like family or friends or both?

32:48.840 --> 32:52.280
Oh yeah, like family and friends and you're like, oh shit, I can't believe I wrote this

32:52.280 --> 32:56.800
line into the song and then you just kind of jump over it weirdly and that kind of thing.

32:56.800 --> 33:00.680
So when people, how do you explain to your family, does your family kind of bust your

33:00.680 --> 33:07.960
balls like when they're like, so what do you do and you're like, is it hard to say I'm

33:07.960 --> 33:09.960
a rapper?

33:09.960 --> 33:10.960
Sometimes.

33:10.960 --> 33:11.960
They support me generally.

33:11.960 --> 33:13.400
I mean, we're all a little weird, I guess.

33:13.400 --> 33:18.760
My dad is a piano technician and my sister is, she builds MOOCs synthesizers and she's

33:18.760 --> 33:20.560
studying for that.

33:20.560 --> 33:26.560
So they really support me when I decided I was going to take the music route because

33:26.560 --> 33:31.200
I've been working in film all this time and that was like also a little weird for some

33:31.200 --> 33:34.640
of the people who I grew up with, they're like, oh, it's like a creative field and you're

33:34.640 --> 33:38.520
never going to make it in film, but you know, here we are, so.

33:38.520 --> 33:42.360
We have another mutual friend, Open Mike Eagle, who was on the show a couple months ago and

33:42.360 --> 33:43.360
you know him too.

33:43.360 --> 33:49.520
That's what we discovered over dinner and so I just wanted to drop that.

33:49.520 --> 33:51.000
You need to respect me as an interviewer.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
Oh yeah, I do.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
I know Open Mike Eagle.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.520
I will close this mic and turn it into a falcon.

33:55.520 --> 33:56.520
I'm dumb, so dumb.

33:56.520 --> 33:58.920
I'm like, wait, I'll yank a bit now.

33:58.920 --> 33:59.920
But he's fine.

33:59.920 --> 34:01.320
Why am I shitting on him?

34:01.320 --> 34:05.680
All right, so how did you get involved in rap?

34:05.680 --> 34:06.760
How did you get interested in it?

34:06.760 --> 34:07.760
What drew you to it?

34:07.760 --> 34:11.680
You said your primary interest was film, so then take us to the threshold in your biopic

34:11.680 --> 34:13.360
where you're like, I'm a rap.

34:13.360 --> 34:18.200
Well, I've always written poetry since I was a little kid and then I started to go through

34:18.200 --> 34:25.000
this phase in 2010, 2011, where if I would get mad at work, I would just be like, oh

34:25.000 --> 34:30.160
yeah, well, I'm going to write a poem and I would do that.

34:30.160 --> 34:36.160
And I wouldn't share them with anybody, but eventually somebody showed me hip hop music

34:36.160 --> 34:41.400
and then I was able to take these secret poems I was writing and stitch them over beats and

34:41.400 --> 34:44.400
then make something really awesome.

34:44.400 --> 34:49.800
And I put out a music video once and it got a lot of attention kind of right away.

34:49.800 --> 34:55.960
And so someone called me and asked me to come and screen that video at this event that he

34:55.960 --> 34:59.400
was throwing at O'Brien's in Santa Monica.

34:59.400 --> 35:02.320
And I was like, I'm not going to screen that shitty video.

35:02.320 --> 35:05.240
It's not happening, but I'll do a 30 minute set.

35:05.240 --> 35:07.400
And he was like, all right, that's great, cool, booked.

35:07.400 --> 35:11.120
Two months later, I had to write that music because I didn't have any.

35:11.120 --> 35:12.120
But I put it together.

35:12.120 --> 35:13.120
It made it happen.

35:13.120 --> 35:15.200
I think that's how the good people have their friends.

35:15.200 --> 35:18.760
If you know, just like somehow your ego like makes you say you're going to do something

35:18.760 --> 35:25.360
like that's what Channel 101 was for filmmakers when we were starting it in 2003, God, whatever.

35:25.360 --> 35:30.560
It was like Schrab and I knew if we don't have an appointment like where everyone's

35:30.560 --> 35:34.760
going to either know that we suck because we didn't finish something or we have something,

35:34.760 --> 35:35.760
like that's there.

35:35.760 --> 35:36.760
Yeah, whatever.

35:36.760 --> 35:37.760
Why am I explaining this to you?

35:37.760 --> 35:38.760
I totally agree.

35:38.760 --> 35:41.240
Do you make your own beats or do you have people that you work with?

35:41.240 --> 35:42.240
I work with people.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.240
Beat people.

35:43.240 --> 35:44.880
I have beat people.

35:44.880 --> 35:48.440
I have a friend in New Orleans who I met when I was working on a job over there.

35:48.440 --> 35:49.600
His name is Raddy Skirvix.

35:49.600 --> 35:53.040
He produced my full album, my first album which I put out in November.

35:53.040 --> 35:55.000
It's called Cloud Nine.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.480
And then I have another producer who I work with regularly.

35:57.480 --> 36:00.640
His name is DJ Bless One and he lives in El Paso.

36:00.640 --> 36:03.960
So sometimes when I'm crossing the country to tour, I'll like stop with Raddy and we'll

36:03.960 --> 36:07.800
make a song and then I'll stop with Bless and we'll make a song and then, you know, wherever

36:07.800 --> 36:09.280
I can do that.

36:09.280 --> 36:12.760
Who was the first, I know you had like kind of a mentor character you were telling me

36:12.760 --> 36:13.920
about when we were talking.

36:13.920 --> 36:22.840
But then also, like who just popped culturally, like who was the rap artist that kind of,

36:22.840 --> 36:28.800
like I don't know, like you're early, I want to, now I really want to do this because I'm

36:28.800 --> 36:31.880
listening to this all the time or I don't know, early influence, is that what I'm trying

36:31.880 --> 36:32.880
to get around to?

36:32.880 --> 36:38.200
One of my favorite bands growing up was this Screamo band called Glassjaw and I love them

36:38.200 --> 36:40.720
until the day I die.

36:40.720 --> 36:41.720
They're amazing.

36:41.720 --> 36:43.720
But anyway, it's a little intense, very different.

36:43.720 --> 36:44.720
Did you go Screamo?

36:44.720 --> 36:45.720
Screamo, yeah.

36:45.720 --> 36:46.720
I'm not familiar with it.

36:46.720 --> 36:47.720
Oh yeah.

36:47.720 --> 36:49.720
It's like emo where they scream.

36:49.720 --> 36:53.720
It's a surprise to know that I am not familiar with Screamo.

36:53.720 --> 36:54.720
I feel like you might be.

36:54.720 --> 36:58.640
I mean, you may cause it Screamo fan, but you're there, it's there.

36:58.640 --> 36:59.640
I just don't know what it is.

36:59.640 --> 37:01.640
It might be my new favorite thing.

37:01.640 --> 37:04.640
What's a Screamo band?

37:04.640 --> 37:08.800
Well, they'll sing and they'll have their heavy guitars and it's like kind of a, I don't

37:08.800 --> 37:13.600
know, like an indie hardcore music genre, but then they scream at the top of their lungs

37:13.600 --> 37:17.520
like, and it's beautiful.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.520
If I scream once, I lose my voice for a month.

37:19.520 --> 37:20.520
Right, me too.

37:20.520 --> 37:21.520
It's art.

37:21.520 --> 37:22.520
What they do is craft.

37:22.520 --> 37:24.960
The people that can scream, they do that all the time.

37:24.960 --> 37:29.600
Night after night song, like do a two hour set, night after night on a tour, like yeah,

37:29.600 --> 37:30.600
that is a craft.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.000
There is something in there happening.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.080
But are these, is Screamo rapping when Screamo?

37:35.080 --> 37:36.080
No.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.080
So there was a singer.

37:37.080 --> 37:38.080
His singer's name is...

37:38.080 --> 37:40.080
Damn, don't embarrass yourself.

37:40.080 --> 37:44.360
Well, I mean, anybody can rap, you know, like I think probably one of the first raps that

37:44.360 --> 37:50.040
I learned was like in a Rancid song, you know, without even realizing that that was rap.

37:50.040 --> 37:53.800
I just like really like the fast chop of it and I wanted to learn it.

37:53.800 --> 37:58.560
And then, but anyway, the singer of Glassjaw, his name is Darryl Palumbo and he did a hook

37:58.560 --> 38:01.320
for an artist named Cage.

38:01.320 --> 38:06.240
And Cage was out of New York and I listened to that album to hear that hook, like that

38:06.240 --> 38:07.240
part where he sings.

38:07.240 --> 38:10.640
And I heard the whole album and I bought it and now I have it and I grew up with it,

38:10.640 --> 38:11.840
you know, because of that.

38:11.840 --> 38:17.400
So like I kind of let like people who I'm, you know, love and I'm following like to bring

38:17.400 --> 38:22.760
me to my next kind of like bubble to explore in and then to the next thing.

38:22.760 --> 38:23.760
So yeah.

38:23.760 --> 38:28.640
Well, here comes the part where I show you that I'm bad at what I do and I don't mean

38:28.640 --> 38:30.600
rapping, which I will blow your mind with later.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.520
Yes, you will.

38:32.520 --> 38:37.640
But it will blow my mind if we can just do this like willy-nilly, but you did bring

38:37.640 --> 38:39.720
like a thumb drive of Beats, didn't you?

38:39.720 --> 38:44.000
And do we, are we, would you mind like doing like, what would you like most, what would

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
you be following your bliss?

38:45.000 --> 38:48.800
Do you want to just do one of your numbers?

38:48.800 --> 38:51.000
I sound like your dad.

38:51.000 --> 38:58.480
Can you spend some of your wax for us?

38:58.480 --> 38:59.480
Or whatever.

38:59.480 --> 39:02.560
I mean, what's your preference to do like, or?

39:02.560 --> 39:07.600
I mean, I brought four different songs with me to perform, but I don't expect to be able

39:07.600 --> 39:08.800
to have time to do all of them.

39:08.800 --> 39:10.200
So I mean, I can do whatever.

39:10.200 --> 39:11.200
Yeah.

39:11.200 --> 39:12.200
I could like spit one.

39:12.200 --> 39:14.720
No, I think like you should, you should do one that's like, all right.

39:14.720 --> 39:17.400
Well, here, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll dance, explain what you should do then.

39:17.400 --> 39:23.020
What if you, if unless, unless there's something that would make you happier, do one that's

39:23.020 --> 39:25.840
just like your thing that you do.

39:25.840 --> 39:28.560
And then, and then we'll talk a little more because there was like this, you just came

39:28.560 --> 39:33.280
back from Burning Man and I want to talk about that thing, the not Burning Man, but the other

39:33.280 --> 39:34.280
thing.

39:34.280 --> 39:42.760
But, but, and, and then, and then at a certain point, obviously I'm going to get some like

39:42.760 --> 39:46.680
open mic eagle taught me like lessons about my freestyling.

39:46.680 --> 39:47.680
I want those lessons.

39:47.680 --> 39:51.320
Well, I'll give you his lessons, but then I need more from you because I didn't come

39:51.320 --> 39:52.320
here for nothing.

39:52.320 --> 39:54.240
Do I call you B Squid or do I call you by your, your first name?

39:54.240 --> 39:58.080
You can call me B Squid or Squid or Allie because that's also my name.

39:58.080 --> 39:59.080
Yeah.

39:59.080 --> 40:00.080
All right.

40:00.080 --> 40:01.080
So Squid.

40:01.080 --> 40:02.080
What if it was Agnes?

40:02.080 --> 40:03.080
Yes.

40:03.080 --> 40:04.080
Then it would be amazing.

40:04.080 --> 40:06.480
Obviously Agnes would be the greatest name of all time.

40:06.480 --> 40:07.480
I know.

40:07.480 --> 40:08.480
Agnes.

40:08.480 --> 40:09.480
Yeah.

40:09.480 --> 40:10.480
Go Agnes.

40:10.480 --> 40:12.320
Like my, my, my riff of what a, what a, what a sad name would be.

40:12.320 --> 40:15.600
It's like, like, yeah, no, that would be cool because that's, I'm 44.

40:15.600 --> 40:17.960
But Squid, are you, are you a comfortable freestyler?

40:17.960 --> 40:18.960
Do you like that?

40:18.960 --> 40:19.960
Or do you, is that something you enjoy?

40:19.960 --> 40:21.320
Uh, it's something I enjoy.

40:21.320 --> 40:24.160
I actually haven't broken my public freestyling cherry.

40:24.160 --> 40:25.160
So that would be a thing.

40:25.160 --> 40:28.240
Well, the bar is incredibly low here.

40:28.240 --> 40:31.680
You're going to be the Babe Ruth of freestyling here.

40:31.680 --> 40:32.680
Nice.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.920
But I think first let's, you know, like, let's, let's, let's, let's warm up with

40:35.920 --> 40:39.680
just a, like one of your, how do you, how do you tell them what to play though if you

40:39.680 --> 40:41.760
wanted to just do one of your set things?

40:41.760 --> 40:43.680
I want to do a thousand winters.

40:43.680 --> 40:44.680
Fantastic.

40:44.680 --> 40:46.600
It was the one I said I wasn't going to do.

40:46.600 --> 40:48.760
Zach, you up, you up on that, Zach?

40:48.760 --> 40:50.760
All right.

40:50.760 --> 40:58.320
It's, we don't, you know, we don't always do this.

40:58.320 --> 41:01.320
It's worth the wait.

41:01.320 --> 41:04.840
Should I like stand up?

41:04.840 --> 41:05.840
Yeah.

41:05.840 --> 41:06.840
Make it show biz.

41:06.840 --> 41:13.360
What about a lighting, a lighting effect that's a little less butcher shop?

41:13.360 --> 41:20.360
If it takes forever, I will wait for you

41:20.360 --> 41:27.360
For a thousand winters, I will wait for you

41:27.360 --> 41:31.360
Till you're here beside me

41:31.360 --> 41:35.360
Till I'm holding you

41:35.360 --> 41:38.360
Till I hear you sigh

41:38.360 --> 41:43.360
Here in my eyes

41:43.360 --> 41:47.360
Because I know you're weeding too, and all my thoughts involve you

41:47.360 --> 41:51.360
Don't tell me what I cannot do, for in my own good I'll wait for you

41:51.360 --> 41:54.360
I'm searching time and watching close for all the signals, coast to coast

41:54.360 --> 41:58.360
Clouds are painting tentacles, compass pointing where to go

41:58.360 --> 42:01.360
East into the sunrise, cause I try and try to land in time

42:01.360 --> 42:05.360
To sandy a time like paper with some grit, unleash a shine

42:05.360 --> 42:09.360
With blue balloons I float to you, where I will grow out of these boots

42:09.360 --> 42:13.360
And if you leave and travel on, my heart will follow with a song

42:13.360 --> 42:16.360
You can take my magic wand, repeat these spells across the pond

42:16.360 --> 42:20.360
One week flies by like Dumbo did, they thought he'd fall, but he learned to live

42:20.360 --> 42:24.360
Of all the hearts this world will bring, I hope each one enlightens me

42:24.360 --> 42:28.360
So in your presence I am free to gift you with eternity

42:28.360 --> 42:31.360
Lighter than a feather, I am stricken, like a match

42:31.360 --> 42:35.360
You and me expand to fill the space and plug the gaps

42:35.360 --> 42:38.360
I miss you, need you, want you bad, and while we wait we may go mad

42:38.360 --> 42:42.360
But I'll be there when leaves turn brown, and I'll be singing you this song

42:42.360 --> 42:46.360
Dreaming daylight, think of me, I'm always somewhere you could be

42:46.360 --> 42:50.360
Feeding every harmony with hearts of possibility

42:50.360 --> 43:03.360
If it takes forever, I will wait for you

43:03.360 --> 43:10.360
For a thousand winters, I will wait for you

43:10.360 --> 43:18.360
Till you're here beside me, till I'm holding you

43:18.360 --> 43:25.360
Till I hear you sigh, hear in my arms

43:25.360 --> 43:33.360
If it takes forever, I will wait for you

43:33.360 --> 43:40.360
For a thousand winters, I will wait for you

43:40.360 --> 43:48.360
Till you're here beside me, till I'm holding you

43:48.360 --> 43:55.360
Till I hear you sigh, hear in my arms

43:55.360 --> 43:59.360
Anywhere you wonder, anywhere you go

43:59.360 --> 44:03.360
Every day remember, I adore you so

44:03.360 --> 44:09.360
In your heart, believe what in my heart I know that forevermore

44:09.360 --> 44:15.360
I'll wait for you

44:25.360 --> 44:27.360
Hell yeah

44:27.360 --> 44:28.360
B-Squid!

44:28.360 --> 44:30.360
B-Squid.

44:30.360 --> 44:31.360
Thank you guys.

44:31.360 --> 44:37.360
I was mortified in the beginning because there wasn't enough monitor or something.

44:37.360 --> 44:40.360
I couldn't really hear the beat, but then I kind of got it anyway.

44:40.360 --> 44:42.360
Yeah, you had to squat it.

44:42.360 --> 44:45.360
Yeah, if we do more, Zach, can we get more of the sound in the monitor?

44:45.360 --> 44:47.360
When I'm up...

44:47.360 --> 44:49.360
I kind of want to see...

44:49.360 --> 44:50.360
He happens sometimes.

44:50.360 --> 44:52.360
I'll stop the show.

44:52.360 --> 44:58.360
I was kind of thinking maybe we could experiment where either we play that same beat again and Dan tries to...

44:58.360 --> 45:00.360
Well, I think I got it, yeah.

45:00.360 --> 45:02.360
Okay, so let's put...

45:02.360 --> 45:07.360
But I also want to hear that...

45:07.360 --> 45:10.360
I want to hear that singer-songwriter hook stuff, too.

45:10.360 --> 45:11.360
Yes, the song.

45:11.360 --> 45:12.360
No, I think I got it, I got it.

45:12.360 --> 45:13.360
Okay.

45:19.360 --> 45:21.360
Let's give it up for P-Squid.

45:23.360 --> 45:25.360
He pees on squids.

45:25.360 --> 45:33.360
There are a thousand winters

45:33.360 --> 45:37.360
I wait for you

45:37.360 --> 45:41.360
I'll have no splinters

45:41.360 --> 45:45.360
Inside my shoe

45:45.360 --> 45:48.360
A thousand winters

45:48.360 --> 45:52.360
And a half a dozen falls

45:52.360 --> 45:55.360
Went to my friend's house

45:55.360 --> 45:59.360
And I can't take it all

45:59.360 --> 46:01.360
Yo, I'm sick of this shit, I'm sick of society's shit

46:01.360 --> 46:03.360
I'm so sick of it, I'm going to sit on it

46:03.360 --> 46:05.360
I'm going to take my ass and put it down on it

46:05.360 --> 46:08.360
I can't fucking hear it, god damn it

46:08.360 --> 46:10.360
Don't fuck with me

46:10.360 --> 46:12.360
Fuck, fuck, fuck

46:12.360 --> 46:14.360
No one's in the street

46:14.360 --> 46:16.360
I saw everyone's feet

46:16.360 --> 46:18.360
I went up to the sky

46:18.360 --> 46:21.360
I can't fucking hear

46:21.360 --> 46:23.360
The beat

46:23.360 --> 46:25.360
Piece of shit

46:25.360 --> 46:28.360
There are a thousand falls

46:28.360 --> 46:30.360
I'm sick of this shit

46:30.360 --> 46:32.360
I'm going to put it on a hat

46:32.360 --> 46:34.360
I'm going to put it back on my head

46:34.360 --> 46:36.360
Because I've got a zit

46:36.360 --> 46:38.360
Went into my car, went fire

46:38.360 --> 46:40.360
I drove to the moon and ate some tar

46:40.360 --> 46:43.360
It burned me, it burned my ass

46:43.360 --> 46:47.360
I got too fast when you rap too fast

46:47.360 --> 46:50.360
You can't improvise when you rap too fast

46:50.360 --> 46:55.360
There's no such thing as rapping that fast

46:55.360 --> 46:58.360
When you improvise

46:58.360 --> 47:00.360
I saw your mama the other day

47:00.360 --> 47:02.360
She looked at me and asked if I was gay

47:02.360 --> 47:05.360
I said, I don't have that honor, bitch

47:05.360 --> 47:07.360
Mom's closed minded, she's homophobic

47:07.360 --> 47:09.360
I went down the street and got on a telephone

47:09.360 --> 47:12.360
Why is there still a telephone on the street?

47:14.360 --> 47:16.360
Because I'm a time traveler

47:16.360 --> 47:19.360
My dad is Dan Rather

47:19.360 --> 47:22.360
Played by Robert Redford in the movie Truth

47:22.360 --> 47:24.360
Have you heard about that?

47:24.360 --> 47:28.360
It's about the thing about George Bush's military service

47:34.360 --> 47:37.360
For a thousand winters

47:37.360 --> 47:40.360
What, what, what, thousand days

47:40.360 --> 47:45.360
What, what, what, for a thousand million calendars

47:45.360 --> 47:49.360
What, what, what, I've seen a purple hair

47:49.360 --> 47:51.360
Tell you what about that

47:51.360 --> 47:52.360
Fuck, mother cat

47:52.360 --> 47:53.360
Fuck you, darn two

47:53.360 --> 47:54.360
That a rat

47:54.360 --> 47:56.360
Put them all together in a jar

47:56.360 --> 47:57.360
Through the shit, says

47:57.360 --> 47:58.360
Fuck it

48:04.360 --> 48:07.360
For a thirty-five

48:07.360 --> 48:08.360
Springs

48:12.360 --> 48:13.360
I saw you the other day

48:13.360 --> 48:17.560
You had a tattoo? I broke my heart. What about you? I haven't seen you in ten years.

48:17.560 --> 48:22.080
What's the Facebook status? Why is it still single? You know you got you got

48:22.080 --> 48:27.960
into somebody else. Two weeks after we broke up, I sensed overlap. I'm not

48:27.960 --> 48:35.720
stalking. I sensed overlap. I'm not a Facebook stalker. I'm policing overlap.

48:35.720 --> 48:41.880
I'm police overlap. Think about that. With your butt flaps. Wrap it up,

48:41.880 --> 48:47.480
wrap it up, wrap it up. Wrap it up, wrap it up. Think about that.

48:48.320 --> 49:02.200
For a thousand winters, it snows so long. I hope my zombie dragon doesn't go to the

49:02.200 --> 49:09.760
wrong side. I can't. Got you dragging out of ice. You got some chains. Don't know how

49:09.760 --> 49:14.240
I made them. Police dragging out of ice, brought it back to life, made its eyes blue.

49:14.240 --> 49:17.840
Now I'm gonna cut like a knife through the wall. The rubble's gonna fall. Then I'm

49:17.840 --> 49:25.480
gonna walk over it all. I'm gonna go south. Right? I just get that mixed up. South is

49:25.480 --> 49:30.400
bad? South is like the Korean thing. It's like you can never keep track north of

49:30.400 --> 49:40.960
walls, man. Fucking thousand winters. Yo, it's like a thousand winters. Yo, yo. Ain't

49:40.960 --> 49:45.680
no fucking summer in sight, bitch.

49:45.680 --> 49:52.680
I like this game.

49:52.680 --> 49:57.680
I mean, I don't think my version's perfect. We're gonna go to the judges.

49:57.680 --> 50:01.280
It brought tears to my eyes a little.

50:01.280 --> 50:07.600
I don't think mine's perfect, but you had a chance to write yours. I did have the advantage

50:07.600 --> 50:11.440
of watching yours, so it's even. I think we tied.

50:11.440 --> 50:13.840
I'd say so.

50:13.840 --> 50:23.240
But yeah, so Open Mike Eagle, he divested me. If you wanna know how I got to that level.

50:23.240 --> 50:30.480
Open Mike Eagle, he taught me that I don't have to say fuck your mama all the time. Do

50:30.480 --> 50:36.720
you have crutches when you freestyle? The phrases that you lean on when you're killing

50:36.720 --> 50:37.720
time?

50:37.720 --> 50:38.720
Sometimes.

50:38.720 --> 50:41.160
Dude, what are they?

50:41.160 --> 50:47.880
I try not to repeat them, but as an exercise. Right now, I guess if we start freestyling,

50:47.880 --> 50:50.160
I think you'll figure it out.

50:50.160 --> 50:52.240
You don't wanna give them power.

50:52.240 --> 50:55.960
Yeah, because they're changing. They change every time I freestyle.

50:55.960 --> 50:59.720
Oh, so if I drop the fuck your mama's, which as soon as Open Mike left, I was like back

50:59.720 --> 51:00.720
on it.

51:00.720 --> 51:03.600
Yeah, it's like the sauce, you know, you gotta take it.

51:03.600 --> 51:07.120
Everybody was cheering, like he made me not say fuck your mama for like a rap, and it

51:07.120 --> 51:08.120
was like...

51:08.120 --> 51:09.120
You gotta push yourself.

51:09.120 --> 51:12.560
Everybody was like, yay, you're learning and growing, and then he left. He's like, I'm

51:12.560 --> 51:17.360
rich, and I was like, fuck your mama!

51:17.360 --> 51:23.440
But yeah, did any of the beats that you brought for freestyling, are they kind of like a little

51:23.440 --> 51:24.440
slower?

51:24.440 --> 51:30.360
Apparently they're all licensed, but they were slower. So I guess there's other beats

51:30.360 --> 51:31.360
on hand.

51:31.360 --> 51:32.360
Oh, we have some.

51:32.360 --> 51:37.600
Dan, you really push yourself, I mean lyrically, you're pushing yourself to the limit.

51:37.600 --> 51:38.600
You move very quickly there.

51:38.600 --> 51:44.600
Yeah, but the Kiki Baby dance was really, really on point tonight. That was some good

51:44.600 --> 51:48.560
Kiki Baby going on there.

51:48.560 --> 51:54.200
For me, that song is about the cycle of life.

51:54.200 --> 51:56.240
My main takeaway is that you're sick of this shit.

51:56.240 --> 51:57.240
Yeah.

51:57.240 --> 52:04.880
I think that's the main message, kind of a through line.

52:04.880 --> 52:09.800
That's how I perceive, that's like my perception of like a female rapper. Well, she must be

52:09.800 --> 52:10.800
sick of this shit.

52:10.800 --> 52:17.960
Like I'm sick of this shit. If anyone's rapping that fast, what else could it be? I don't

52:17.960 --> 52:18.960
know.

52:18.960 --> 52:21.000
I'm just sharing my obstacles.

52:21.000 --> 52:26.000
Squid, do you think there's any chance, subconsciously, that based on what you just saw, that you

52:26.000 --> 52:28.720
might accidentally bite some of Dan's freestyle right?

52:28.720 --> 52:36.240
I hope I don't. I mean, I would feel really terrible if I did, because I respect you and

52:36.240 --> 52:39.920
your freestyles are sacred to that moment.

52:39.920 --> 52:46.880
Is it lame to use the word lame as a derogatory way, because it's ablest? Okay, starting

52:46.880 --> 52:49.880
over.

52:49.880 --> 52:50.880
Is it bad?

52:50.880 --> 52:59.000
What a boring world we've created. I hope Nazis take it over.

52:59.000 --> 53:05.200
Is it negative to take more than three ibuprofen?

53:05.200 --> 53:09.760
Is it bad that his beats are so retarded?

53:09.760 --> 53:16.480
Is it bad to ask? I feel like this is something that journalism does to the female persuasion

53:16.480 --> 53:22.960
when they're like, you know, like to corner you and say, like, what's the state of women

53:22.960 --> 53:28.400
in rap, like, so that you might, but I don't think anyone's listening to this. So, like,

53:28.400 --> 53:32.280
if, I mean, I don't know, just like, what's your, do you, do you have any opinions about

53:32.280 --> 53:39.880
that, or are you, like, genderblind, like, about rap and go?

53:39.880 --> 53:43.800
In case you hadn't noticed, I'm a lady, no hating, just saying they always underpay me

53:43.800 --> 53:47.720
when new lanes are laid in. I'm a laden, gaze changing, windowpane is prayin', new free

53:47.720 --> 53:52.280
way to playin', escaping, creatin', somethin' missed by education. Labelers are lookin'

53:52.280 --> 53:56.480
for your contribution, if laboring, tailoring, or execution, impaling, failure with the loose

53:56.480 --> 54:00.000
end, goose heads, body running crazy, and a chicken's pen, gotta feel for him, he's for

54:00.000 --> 54:03.080
him, to the lore where we're supposed to get bored, eight to four, with chorns of performance,

54:03.080 --> 54:06.840
stickin' to bird's eye, scored to make the writ, his core, an orb of explorers sentiment,

54:06.840 --> 54:09.880
specially to movers and shakers who can't afford you, hulls are dumped by their players,

54:09.880 --> 54:13.480
the system regrets to inform him, his mission is canceled, and wish in concussion, discussion

54:13.480 --> 54:16.840
of structure that he's been disrupting is kept at a minimum, take this chrysanthemum,

54:16.840 --> 54:20.200
let's all remember him, in member random, the rebel of random reaction is granted, museum

54:20.200 --> 54:23.440
in the hall of all fame, a graveyard of hunger, pink, certain in the name of the young and

54:23.440 --> 54:24.440
ashamed.

54:24.440 --> 54:30.160
So, all right, I think you're avoiding the question.

54:30.160 --> 54:33.040
Answer the fuckin' question.

54:33.040 --> 54:45.440
So, that's my, it's actually, I performed that rap, half way through it, did you stop

54:45.440 --> 54:51.000
listening to the actual, for the first half I was like, god damn, this is like, my brain

54:51.000 --> 54:55.240
is growing, it snaps and then the second half is like, what's the bit that I'm gonna do?

54:55.240 --> 54:59.440
Which is probably, there's probably the second half of that is like, and they're always

54:59.440 --> 55:01.840
just thinkin' about what they're gonna say next to me.

55:01.840 --> 55:07.080
No, I love, I love being a female and I love doing what I do, I think that, you know, it,

55:07.080 --> 55:09.280
it's like, you know, the game of, um,

55:09.280 --> 55:10.280
Thrones.

55:10.280 --> 55:11.280
Guess who?

55:11.280 --> 55:12.280
You remember that game, guess who?

55:12.280 --> 55:13.280
Right?

55:13.280 --> 55:16.560
With all the dude's faces, you're like, oh, this one's got, my guy's got glasses, or my

55:16.560 --> 55:20.880
guy's got a beard, or, my guy's a lady, and you're like, oh, it's one of these

55:20.880 --> 55:21.880
two people.

55:21.880 --> 55:22.880
Okay.

55:22.880 --> 55:26.440
So that's kind of what it feels like, you know, like, not a lot of people get your card,

55:26.440 --> 55:29.240
but when they do get your card, it's like, it stands out, you know?

55:29.240 --> 55:30.240
Right.

55:30.240 --> 55:31.240
So that's a good thing.

55:31.240 --> 55:32.240
Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad, sometimes it's whatever.

55:32.240 --> 55:33.240
Yeah.

55:33.240 --> 55:34.240
It is what it is.

55:34.240 --> 55:35.240
It is what it is.

55:35.240 --> 55:39.080
I'm a strong independent woman, I think, I feel, I try to be anyway, and, uh, and so

55:39.080 --> 55:44.560
I don't like, really let the industry walk all over me, which is why I'm an independent

55:44.560 --> 55:45.560
starring artist.

55:45.560 --> 55:48.960
But hey, you know, you gotta do what you gotta do in this life.

55:48.960 --> 55:53.680
Now you, you rocking that Los Feliz cap, are you a Los Feliz native, or?

55:53.680 --> 55:54.680
Yes, I am.

55:54.680 --> 55:55.680
Well, not a native, but I, I live there.

55:55.680 --> 55:56.680
That's who you live in.

55:56.680 --> 55:57.680
That's where I live.

55:57.680 --> 55:58.680
All right.

55:58.680 --> 55:59.680
That's my hometown.

55:59.680 --> 56:00.680
Yeah.

56:00.680 --> 56:01.680
Dan's hometown.

56:01.680 --> 56:05.200
Just to get grim for a second, because it's kind of just historically grim, like, you

56:05.200 --> 56:10.480
were just a burning man, and I've never been, and, uh, you've been there many, many times

56:10.480 --> 56:11.480
lately.

56:11.480 --> 56:12.480
Seven times.

56:12.480 --> 56:17.880
Uh, this, I, and then we're like, you're talking about the heat, and I was like, and

56:17.880 --> 56:21.720
then the obvious dumb joke is I was like, yeah, it was a literal, literal burning man.

56:21.720 --> 56:25.920
There were burning men there, and then you're like, no, there was one because this fucking

56:25.920 --> 56:26.920
thing happened.

56:26.920 --> 56:32.400
I don't know how many of you heard about this, like, it's probably easy to, to miss

56:32.400 --> 56:33.400
news these days.

56:33.400 --> 56:37.320
Like, like, but, but do you, I mean, should I, should I say what happened and then you

56:37.320 --> 56:38.320
talk about it?

56:38.320 --> 56:40.240
Like, or, or do you want to just take it from there?

56:40.240 --> 56:44.880
Um, well, I was there, uh, and I was sitting kind of like on a, like on the, I want to

56:44.880 --> 56:50.720
say the three o'clock side, maybe, and from where I was, I wasn't able to see occur at

56:50.720 --> 56:51.720
the fire.

56:51.720 --> 56:55.280
But, um, when the man was burning this year on Saturday night, there was a guy, and his

56:55.280 --> 57:00.600
name was Aaron Joel Mitchell, and he ran into the fire, um, and committed suicide.

57:00.600 --> 57:03.520
And that was actually really, like a really sad thing I didn't find out about until the

57:03.520 --> 57:04.520
next morning.

57:04.520 --> 57:07.280
Um, you said he was in there for 30 minutes.

57:07.280 --> 57:08.280
Like 30 seconds.

57:08.280 --> 57:09.280
Oh, 30 seconds.

57:09.280 --> 57:10.280
30 minutes.

57:10.280 --> 57:11.280
Okay.

57:11.280 --> 57:12.280
You know what?

57:12.280 --> 57:13.280
Still too long.

57:13.280 --> 57:14.280
Still too long.

57:14.280 --> 57:15.280
I'm sorry.

57:15.280 --> 57:16.280
I, I know nothing about this.

57:16.280 --> 57:20.840
I was wondering about, there was a guy, a guy just like ran into the fire, but he, to,

57:20.840 --> 57:24.800
to self-emolate and, and, and kill himself by fire at Burning Man.

57:24.800 --> 57:26.760
I mean, nobody knows why he did it.

57:26.760 --> 57:27.760
Oh really?

57:27.760 --> 57:30.960
Nobody knows if he was on drugs or they know he wasn't drunk.

57:30.960 --> 57:36.640
Um, they know that he had been sober previously and that he was like a, a beaming, gentle

57:36.640 --> 57:41.600
soul and, um, and that, you know, you can, nobody can really speak on why he did it.

57:41.600 --> 57:45.840
Cause they think it's a sign of the times that I immediately was like, I don't, I won't

57:45.840 --> 57:49.080
be surprised if I find out this isn't the case, but the first thought in my head is

57:49.080 --> 57:51.840
I wonder if this guy is just like, fuck it.

57:51.840 --> 57:52.840
This is it.

57:52.840 --> 57:59.200
Like, like, like this point in history, like, and it's whether or not it, it often these

57:59.200 --> 58:04.680
things aren't, they're not sometimes a cigar is a cigar and like who knows why he did it.

58:04.680 --> 58:07.840
But like it's, it's already notable that that was the first thought in my head cause it

58:07.840 --> 58:08.840
wouldn't have been last year.

58:08.840 --> 58:14.200
I wouldn't have been like, I bet, I bet he did that because, because the world is ending.

58:14.200 --> 58:22.040
Like, it's, so it's like, but the other crazy thing is that is realizing that you were there

58:22.040 --> 58:28.360
the entire time you were on one side of a fire with a guy that ran into it and basically

58:28.360 --> 58:29.360
never came out.

58:29.360 --> 58:33.320
I mean, they fetched him out and then he died in the hospital, um, but you didn't find out

58:33.320 --> 58:37.640
about it till the next day and I was like, okay, so I need to recalibrate my definition

58:37.640 --> 58:44.520
of what a large fire is because like, I've never been a burning man of like, how many

58:44.520 --> 58:48.000
people are gathered around the actual burning man?

58:48.000 --> 58:52.440
They say there's like, there were like 50,000 people there and so there's like a whole perimeter

58:52.440 --> 58:57.240
of like party buses and art cars that kind of like surrounded and then within that, between

58:57.240 --> 59:03.200
that perimeter and then there's like a perimeter of, um, you know, Rangers like making sure

59:03.200 --> 59:09.000
nobody runs into fucking fire, um, in between that is where everybody sits and stands and

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
you know, it's a beautiful fire show.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.480
There's like this whole procession beforehand.

59:14.480 --> 59:18.000
It's like very ceremonious, you know, they've been doing it, I think like 30 years.

59:18.000 --> 59:24.240
And then there's, um, fireworks, the best damn fire, fireworks show you'll ever see

59:24.240 --> 59:30.840
that burn, um, and then, uh, and then the fire and fire was like insane this year.

59:30.840 --> 59:31.840
Like it was insane.

59:31.840 --> 59:36.400
It was kind of like a structure around the man and the man was like in the center of

59:36.400 --> 59:37.400
it.

59:37.400 --> 59:41.160
Usually he's like up on a post or like up somehow, but this year the theme was radical

59:41.160 --> 59:42.160
rituals.

59:42.160 --> 59:48.000
So what they did was they made the, the man almost looked like the traditional temple

59:48.000 --> 59:49.360
that is at Burning Man as well.

59:49.360 --> 59:54.440
So there was like kind of a secondary, it was, it was a really spiritual year, um, at

59:54.440 --> 59:55.440
Burning Man.

59:55.440 --> 59:57.400
Everything was built like it was a shrine of some kind.

59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.520
So I mean, there's like cynical dots I'm connecting here, what you're describing.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:05.520
So this year they tried something different where they had like an injury way on the fire.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:11.640
I mean, they kind of designed it like a place you could go into.

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:12.640
I guess so.

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:18.600
I mean, it's just, this guy broke through the lines of marshals and people there and

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:25.520
made it, made it through and thrust himself into the fire and they got him out like half

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.520
alive.

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:30.720
They got him out like after 30 seconds and they, you know, flew him to safety, but he

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:31.720
did.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:32.720
Jesus Christ.

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.720
It's really sad.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:34.720
Yeah.

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:38.200
I mean, that's, but we don't know why if, if that was a moment of passion or something

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.280
he'd been planning on or no idea.

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:41.280
Yeah.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.280
Wow.

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:43.280
He apparently didn't leave a note or anything.

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.960
What was the reaction after that happened?

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:48.000
Like did, how much of that crowd, because the whole crowd couldn't possibly have seen

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
all that maybe, right?

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.880
I mean, I remember hearing like sound come from the other side.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:57.880
Like sometimes the, the whole crowd like, you know, sparks up some kind of like chant

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:03.760
or cheer or like wave of howling at the moon or like, or somebody's like calling for their

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.760
friend, Sarah.

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.760
And they're like, Sarah.

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:10.160
And then the whole crowd is screaming Sarah, Sarah's fucking found or something.

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:14.280
But I mean, like you, you could hear something was happening on the other side, but I, I

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:15.280
mean,

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:19.280
And you've done that seven times in a row, like been kind of there at the fire.

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:24.640
And so yeah, and you, you, you look back and go, Oh yeah, something happened, but something's

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.640
always happening.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:33.160
And I mean, that, that is such a, that's such a weird, crazy metaphor for if I end that

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:38.000
sentence with life, I devalue my observation because this sounds dumb, that's such a metaphor

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
for life.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.520
But, but it is, I mean, you can't say that's a metaphor for society.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:44.880
You can't say, that is, that is what life is.

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:49.120
That's great that we're all gathered together and that there is tragedy happening.

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:53.720
That, that from a distance, from the other side of the, of the fire, which is the greatest

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:54.720
thing that's ever happened.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:59.720
And that's like, there can be a person and, and, and, and it can be mistaken from certain

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:06.480
perspectives for just another part of a celebration and then the next day, it's like, yeah, dude,

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:14.040
man, it's like, like, like, unrelated to that because I don't want to follow up that story

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.160
with like, I want to go to Burning Man at this point.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:23.320
I, I, but, but it's like, at this point, yeah, after the, the aftermath of the election

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:27.920
and stuff, it's like, my mind and soul are shambles of, of white fragile shards, like

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:30.040
I bought a gun.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:33.760
I'm like, I'm planning on just doomsday prepping in a desert.

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:37.280
I don't know how I'm going to die of thirst, like digging a hole straight down because

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.280
I play Minecraft.

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:47.120
I, I, like, like, and, and like, I, so it's, it's, it's like, I look back on like, a 10

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:53.120
year history of using the phrase Burning Man as a comedy writer to like, you know, mean

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:58.800
hippie and dippy and whatever, just like, make fun or whatever, like, and, and now it's

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:02.680
like, because of this year, it's like, this is something that I got to go to at some point.

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:07.000
You would definitely obviously recommend it, right, like, like, maybe not to everybody,

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.360
but you, you wouldn't go seven times if you, you weren't getting something out of it.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.160
You're not like monetizing when you go there.

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:16.520
No, I'm not monetizing at all when I go there in Cognito and nobody, you know, like, I'm

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:17.520
not selling anything there.

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.520
Oh, you don't even perform there.

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:19.520
I do perform there.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.520
I do perform there.

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:25.640
I'll perform my songs and my set and, you know, it'll be a lot of fun, but it's not something

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:29.640
that I'm like, banking on or being like, follow my website, you know, it's like, not like

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.640
that.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.560
It's sharing what you've been working on all, like your art for the year, you know, and

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:38.000
bringing that out and making sure that your friends and family and people get to be touched

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.800
by it, like, however they can.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.040
But I definitely recommend going.

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:44.560
I think it's an amazing spiritual journey.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:50.080
And if you need it for, you know, it can really open new windows of perception for anybody

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.800
who goes, really changes the way you see shit.

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:59.120
How do you, I'm sorry, did, how much did that guy's death, like, affect the rest of the proceedings

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:05.200
there or like, did it cast a total pall over it or was, did it kind of move along?

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.800
It was kind of dark.

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:11.320
Just from my experience, which I mean, I'm not like on the inner circles of that, of

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.040
the burn and what's going on in there.

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:17.960
So, you know, it, it, the news came to me in passing and it was just like really strange.

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:22.840
But, and a lot of people knew about it, but we're not talking about it, you know, because

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:27.200
they didn't want that dark dismal, like, black stain on their week, you know, but at the

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:30.400
same time, then you go to the temple burn the next night and there's this like gigantic

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.160
fence and it's like up around it.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:36.720
And I've never seen that before, like a fence and they're like, nobody is jumping in this

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:37.720
damn fire.

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:43.680
What's the, oh, so wait, so just to, so the, is there a fire multiple nights?

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:44.680
Uh-huh.

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:45.680
Okay.

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:46.680
There's lots of fire.

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:49.920
Okay, but there's one, there's, there's the one big burning man that will be where the

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:50.920
man burns.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.840
So like, that's not the end of everything.

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:56.640
Everyone doesn't end that and go like, Jesus Christ, I got a PowerPoint tomorrow.

01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:01.080
Oh, somebody does, I think, because people like leave, people leave, but burning like

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:05.000
that Saturday night, that's like the biggest and best party of the week.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.920
And then Sunday, usually people are like leaving all day and then leaving all night and the

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:12.600
temple burn is like a really quiet and like spiritual experience for people.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:15.200
Like people don't like talk through it, stand up through it.

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:17.440
This is a joke, but also it's probably true.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:22.560
So it's like Comic-Con, like Sundays, like, yeah, exactly.

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:23.560
Just like Comic-Con.

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:26.800
Lots of costumes, lots of weirdos and freaks.

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:31.320
See, like, I'm not a big fan of major crowds and a lot of dirt.

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:33.800
It seems like a lot of dirt and crowds.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:34.800
It's like dust, but yeah.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:35.800
Dust.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:36.800
It's pretty dirty.

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:37.800
Also, what was the temperature?

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:39.320
Because it was bloody hot during that time, right?

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:40.320
Um, yeah, it was hot.

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:41.840
It was really hot.

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:42.840
Like 120?

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:43.840
Like, what was it?

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:44.840
It was crazy.

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:45.840
I don't know.

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:46.840
It was, it was really hot.

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:47.840
It was like.

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:48.840
It's a dry heat.

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:49.840
It was hot at night too.

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:52.640
Like, usually it's like really cold at night, but this year it's like really hot at night.

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:56.000
So, like, you're trying to get dressed to go out at night because at night it's like

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
a different place.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.960
It's like, it's like you're going to, you know, Antarctica for the night or something.

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:02.960
Just hanging out in the snow.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:06.440
And so you're like, I gotta put on my heaviest shit and my brightest things because it's

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.440
like pitch black.

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:11.280
And then, so when the nights would roll around, I'd be like, is it a pants night?

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.760
Should I put a shirt on?

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.720
What do I do here?

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:15.720
Every night's a pants night.

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:16.720
Give me a beat.

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:17.720
Yeah.

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:20.600
Do we have a beat?

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:25.560
Do you guys do like a duet, like maybe kick it back and forth freestyle?

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:28.640
That's why I wanted like kind of a lazy beat, like something that could be a little more

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:29.640
nostalgic.

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:30.640
Something kind of on the mellow tip.

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:31.640
Zach, you got that?

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:32.640
All right.

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:33.640
Yo.

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:39.840
It's one minute away from 9-Eleven, but we're going to wrap right through this.

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:48.760
Every night's a pants night for all you wondering what should be on your legs, if you think

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:49.760
shorts.

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:50.760
Yeah.

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:51.760
Think again.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.760
Oh shit.

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:53.760
Yo.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:07:02.520
I see you walking away from me with your feet.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:09.920
I wonder what's down the street that's for you and not for me that we should separate

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:10.920
like this.

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:13.520
It hurts me.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:25.680
I rhymed me with me and then I took a pee into a jar and drank it.

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:30.680
Why don't you go?

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:31.680
Okay.

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:32.680
Tonight I'm walking with pants on.

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:34.360
I'm doing a little dance.

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:40.000
I'm kicking babies like I was scoutastic and it was romance on the stage with the people

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.520
who were looking at me.

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:46.520
It's nice to meet a love you, my name is Squid, Squiddy B. No, it's not like that.

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:48.400
It's the other way around.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:49.400
Be Squid.

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:55.480
That's my name and I originate in your town, but I've read Miami where my family's rocking

01:07:55.480 --> 01:08:00.320
and they rollin' with the storm, Irma and I not holdin' back.

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.200
I know that they are waitin' for that.

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.200
They're waitin' for that.

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:08.480
They've got their stuff in their cabinets and it's kinda wack that the windstorm of

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:15.920
195 miles per hour, whatever it is, is gonna be a tiny rain shower to the natives of that

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:22.720
place, cause the storm was born in our face and we do it like we in a race.

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:23.720
Extreme weather.

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:24.720
Phenomenon.

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:29.360
Don't be blind to what's goin' on.

01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:32.080
Inconvenient is the facts.

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:36.840
Do you need me to send you a fax about it?

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:46.680
Alright, don't judge my rapping when the earth is crappin' us out of its earthly butthole.

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:51.000
We've been here a while and now we're on the dole.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:57.280
It's a catch-is-catch-can relationship with Mother Gaia and you gotta honor it.

01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:02.920
She's got them polar ice caps and they're chilly but they keep us warm in ironic ways.

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:06.360
You gotta go to school to understand it.

01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:14.840
Yo, put your pants on, put your motherfuckin' pants on, motherfuckin' get your shorts off

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:20.080
your pants on, gonna take the club down the street and keep the dance on.

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:24.880
Doesn't matter if they're big, doesn't matter if they're small, doesn't matter if they're

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:31.360
tight or if they fit at all, doesn't matter if they're gray, if they're black, but not

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:35.640
wearing pants right now is a little wack.

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:36.640
B-Squid, everybody!

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.640
Thank you so much, Ally.

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:45.840
Yeah, well, how do we, to reward you for donating your time?

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:48.400
You were delightful, like what, a plug away?

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:52.240
How can people find you and get into you?

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:53.320
My name is B-Squid.

01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:59.680
You can find me online at bsquidmusic.com, all my socials and stuff, they're there.

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:02.720
And I represent Keep the Feel Entertainment, that's my label.

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:04.720
We're independent, we're out of Los Angeles.

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:08.880
We're producing music, that song that I performed is gonna be on our new sampler, which is coming

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:09.880
up at the...

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:10.880
The first version.

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:11.880
Not the...

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:13.600
I don't want them to get confused.

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:17.960
Like, can we put this bonus track on it, I mean, that would be pretty awesome too.

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.440
We'll do like a novelty vinyl number.

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.440
It'd be great.

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:24.280
That'd be really, really special and sampled for eons to come.

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:29.240
Alright, cool, and you'll come back one day, hopefully, and yeah, maybe you and Mike Eagle

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:32.080
and Logic at the same time, we'll have a rap of Palooza.

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:33.080
Oh yeah.

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:34.080
I love it.

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:37.400
I won't group you all together, maybe I don't see the world through that lens where you're

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:38.400
either a rapper or not.

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.640
I mean, rap parties are fun though, like...

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:41.640
Maybe we're all rappers.

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:44.920
Maybe I'll just pick them all up in my bus and bring them over and we'll be rapping the

01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:46.920
whole way here and the whole way back and it'll be adorable.

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:47.920
And we'll leave in that bus.

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:49.560
Can we outfit your bus for Armageddon?

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:50.560
I can.

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:51.560
Okay.

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:52.560
It's already ready, we're good for that.

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:53.560
Well, you know what you call it?

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:54.560
You call it Armageddon.

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:55.560
Armageddon.

01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:56.560
Armageddon.

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:57.560
Armageddon.

01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:58.560
The Armageddon tour.

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:01.080
We can't talk about that yet, the deal's not fully closed.

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:04.160
All right, well, let's thank you, B-Squid.

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:05.160
B-Squid!

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.160
Thank you very much.

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:07.160
Thank you, Squid.

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:08.160
Well, that was delightful.

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:21.160
I like it when we make new friends randomly.

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.160
Yeah.

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:26.240
You should go to the desert more often for your little vision quests.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.960
I do want to because I got a lot of writing done out there.

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:29.960
Yeah?

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:34.040
Yeah, it's not easy adapting Vonnegut, you know?

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:37.040
I strained one of my pinkies.

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.040
Whoa.

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:44.520
Hitting too many commas or like on the keyboard or what?

01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:46.520
Yeah, it was just like, oh man.

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:47.520
He's comma heavy.

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:48.520
You could spray on a pinkie.

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:49.520
He loves commas.

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.520
I was just like, oh no.

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.520
Yeah.

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:52.520
All right.

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:56.120
Lord knows how many semicolons you're using.

01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:57.520
Let's, should we get Levy up here?

01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:59.200
We should always get a Levy up here.

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.200
Oh.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:01.200
Steve Levy, join us.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:02.200
Where my Levy's at?

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:03.200
Where my Levy's at?

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.200
You're going to love it at Levy.

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.200
What's up, Levy?

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:06.200
Hi.

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:07.200
I forgot to use this.

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.200
What's what?

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:09.200
Oh shit.

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:19.200
Now you were two in the zone, man.

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:21.200
You were doing some of your best work.

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:24.200
A thousand winters.

01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:26.200
And 700.

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:28.200
Oh shit.

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:30.200
Yeah, I can't take it.

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:32.200
Yo, give me a bag of Cheez-Its.

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:34.200
It's just got an endoscopy.

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:36.200
I'm trying to leave it.

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:37.200
Let me call it Uber.

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:39.200
Let me, don't take your limo.

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:48.200
You're trying to make this shit like a, fuck.

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:53.200
I think, I think that's like, you know, you know, patting your head and rubbing your tummy

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:54.200
at the same time.

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:57.200
You got, you got to, you got to just, you know, go with a flow.

01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:58.200
I know.

01:12:58.200 --> 01:12:59.200
It's hard to do both.

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.200
Go with the flow.

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.200
Try and take a limo.

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:05.200
Go with the flow.

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:08.200
No, I got a show to do.

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:10.200
Focus on the O part of limo.

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:13.200
Don't try to rhyme limo.

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.200
Chimo.

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:17.200
That's how I got hung up.

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:20.200
Just say, leave in a limo.

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:23.200
Hey, I got a show to go to.

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.200
To go to.

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:26.200
To go to.

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:31.200
I show to go to.

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:33.200
You had it going.

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.200
You let me know.

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:41.200
You just give me a listen.

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:42.200
Yeah.

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:43.200
I'll let you think about that.

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:45.200
Yo, I kidnapped your cat.

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:51.200
Charging a ransom until you give me some Bob Greenblatt.

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:54.200
Chairman of NBC.

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:59.200
Why you got to cancel me?

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.200
Shots fired on the TV industry.

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:04.200
To the G, to the V, to the what you're going to do with me.

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:07.200
Silicon Valley is taking over so you can drink my pee

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:10.200
because I can produce this shit.

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:12.200
I ain't going to take it no more.

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.200
I'm going to fuck your mama in the front door.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:17.200
Go out the back door and floss her body.

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:22.200
I fucked your mama so hard she's now a hottie.

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:23.200
She's now a hottie?

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:26.200
It didn't make sense and had like your connotations of like

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:27.200
you need to fuck a woman to make her hot.

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.200
I didn't like it.

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:30.200
I backed off because I'm woke.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:32.200
I backed off.

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:34.200
Back off that shit.

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:36.200
Because I'm woke like a bicycle spoke.

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:39.200
I woke up with a baseball card putting to my spokes

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:41.200
and it made a noise that's hard.

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.200
Like a motorcycle.

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:47.200
I'm going to ride to your mama's house with Michael.

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:49.200
Uncle Michael.

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:55.200
Yeah.

01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:57.200
Here's the thing.

01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:00.200
9-Eleven was an inside job.

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:05.200
Hear me out.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:09.200
The melting point of steel is 457.

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:11.200
What happened to building seven?

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:13.200
What don't they want you to know?

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:14.200
What they want you to think?

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:17.200
If you Google it, you'll see in the sink.

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:24.200
Alcada, spelled backwards, is Alcada.

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:26.200
Don't look it up.

01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:28.200
All right.

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:33.200
Okay.

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:35.200
What if that was someone's evidence that 9-Eleven was

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:38.200
an inside job that Alcada spelled backwards as Alcada?

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:42.200
That's neat, but I don't know if it proves anything.

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:44.200
You're not riding the 9-Eleven.

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:46.200
Tower seven.

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:50.200
Yeah.

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:52.200
I'd just say future wraps.

01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:55.200
Just put that in your rhyme bank.

01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:57.200
Remember right after 9-Eleven that email went out

01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:00.200
that was like, hey, listen, you got to type in

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:03.200
these are the flight numbers of the planes

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:06.200
and then type this in and then change your font to Wingdings

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:10.200
and then it was like two buildings and two planes

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:13.200
and then some oil, stuff like black drops

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.200
and I was like, dude, that's oil!

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:19.200
And then we were like, wait a minute, those are the flight numbers.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:26.200
Why would the 9-Eleven people be like, no, here's what we do?

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:28.200
We got to wait until...

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:31.200
You know we should get on the show?

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:33.200
The 9-Eleven people.

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:35.200
Tragically.

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:39.200
Or like the guy who was the inside guy at Microsoft

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:42.200
who manipulated the Wingdings font.

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:44.200
All right.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:45.200
David?

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.200
Yeah.

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:47.200
How you doing?

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:49.200
It's been an interesting week.

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:50.200
Yeah?

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:52.200
Break it down for us.

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:54.200
She's so shocked.

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:56.200
It's been an interesting week.

01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:02.200
Yeah, what happened?

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:06.200
My roommate's car was stolen out of my garage.

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:07.200
Yeah.

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.200
Sounds like an inside job.

01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.200
Yeah.

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:12.200
I think it was an inside job.

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:16.200
What's the point of that car?

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:20.200
It was a real bummer because my car was broken into

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.200
and they found my garage clicker

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:27.200
and his spare key somewhere in my car.

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:30.200
Wait, no, back us up through that.

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:32.200
They didn't break into...

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:35.200
That's how they got into the garage is by breaking into your car.

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:36.200
I think it was an inside job.

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:39.200
I think somebody watched me...

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:42.200
Somebody watched me walk away from my car,

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.200
forget to lock it,

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:45.200
and then...

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:47.200
Outside the...

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:48.200
No, in the garage.

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:50.200
Because I'm in an apartment building.

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:53.200
Okay, so when you say inside job,

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:55.200
literally like someone who lives in the apartment...

01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:56.200
Someone who lives in...

01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:57.200
Yeah.

01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:58.200
I think it was the Russians.

01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:59.200
But that's better than...

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:01.200
I thought you were saying you parked on the street

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.200
and that you'd have to feel guilty about that

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.200
for the rest of your life.

01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:05.200
No, no, no.

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:07.200
I parked on the street because I was just going to run in

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:09.200
and my clicker opened the garage,

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:11.200
went in and had a field day.

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:12.200
No.

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:13.200
But no, you're an innocent too.

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:16.200
You can't control when another human being

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:19.200
that is allowed past all of the security measures

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:22.200
is going to be a crazy car.

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.200
Shouldn't it be easy to investigate then?

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:27.200
I mean, like, it's just one building of suspects.

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:28.200
Right.

01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:29.200
There are cameras.

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:30.200
They called the...

01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:31.200
I don't know.

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:32.200
I would also...

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:33.200
And I'm suspecting, like,

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:36.200
that's a good ten episodes of a Netflix original.

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:37.200
Yeah.

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:39.200
It's called The Building.

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:42.200
Dan, you have enough on your plate right now.

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:44.200
You've already sprained one pinky.

01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:47.200
Ed Harris made one mistake.

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:50.200
It's just because I'm the only one who's lifted his head

01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:51.200
while beating Rodney King.

01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:54.200
Now I'm in charge of apartment building the car thievery.

01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:57.200
But one job was going to change everything.

01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:58.200
Whoa!

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:00.200
This is a crazy job.

01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:02.200
I've got to throw the car.

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:05.200
Netflix presents

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:07.200
a show with a trailer

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:10.200
that follows the 90s trailer trope.

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:14.200
In a world.

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:15.200
Oh, shit.

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:18.200
Yo, 90s trailers.

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:21.200
They got that voice and says,

01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.200
In a world where you stole a car.

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:25.200
Fuckin' man, drink a jar.

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:26.200
All right.

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:27.200
Get back to the...

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:28.200
I'm not that interesting.

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:29.200
Talk.

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:32.200
Uh...

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:36.200
Dan and Spencer shot a fun Harmon Quest commercial this week.

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:37.200
Right.

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.200
That was a highlight.

01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:39.200
Real fun.

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:40.200
Oh, yeah.

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:41.200
Harmon Quest is coming to Verve.

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:43.200
Next week.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:44.200
Verve?

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:45.200
This week.

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:47.200
It's twice as expensive as CISO

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:50.200
and twice as likely to stick around for a year.

01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:55.200
I didn't...

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:58.200
I didn't ask for this new world any more than you did.

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.200
Like, try to look at it this way.

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.200
Like, CISO was a Kickstarter.

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:06.200
And thank you for your $5 commitment to their experiment,

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:10.200
which was noble and gave, like, Cameron and Ria a show

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:14.200
and, like, a bunch of really cool shows on CISO.

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:17.200
And then, like, I don't think this was a controversial statement.

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:19.200
I don't think Universal gave it enough of a chance.

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:20.200
You can't...

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:22.200
That business model needs five years,

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.200
but they had their own reasons and they fucking folded it.

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:25.200
That's not your problem.

01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:26.200
Or...

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:27.200
But it's a little bit mine,

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:29.200
because, like, now we have this world where it's like,

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:31.200
guys like me are like, I got a built-in audience,

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:33.200
and am I going to keep coming to you and going,

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:35.200
here's another person to subscribe to.

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:36.200
I don't want to do that to you.

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:37.200
That's not what Robin Hood does.

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:39.200
He doesn't go,

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:41.200
hey, Merry Men,

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:44.200
I want to introduce you to Gerald of Nottingham.

01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:47.200
He's got a real fun business plan.

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:50.200
For every bottle of shampoo you sell,

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:53.200
three people underneath you sell six bottles,

01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:56.200
and that's not the Robin Hood myth we want.

01:20:56.200 --> 01:21:00.200
Are we finding out that Harmon Quest isn't good enough to make it to, like, an adult swim?

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:02.200
Oh, yeah, for sure.

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:08.200
I mean, it's kind of the fact that we're not already on one of those networks

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:12.200
implies that we did not make it onto one of those networks.

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:13.200
Right.

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.200
Yeah, but now I...

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:18.200
Our show is good enough to be on that, compared to...

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:24.200
I think there's an alternate reality where we did go to adult swim or something similar.

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:26.200
But now adult swim doesn't need us to,

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:28.200
because we're making it for free for two seasons,

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:31.200
and if that becomes so big and with such a success,

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:33.200
adult swim can come along, scoop it up,

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:35.200
and they're going to be like the heroes,

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:36.200
but they didn't do anything.

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:38.200
Yeah, I mean, I don't even know the particulars of the deal,

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:40.200
but we didn't have...

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.200
Among our options wasn't like,

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:44.200
we're going to keep our show and go...

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:46.200
Right, yeah, we don't have the rights.

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:48.200
We would just do it on the internet, sell it for a dollar an episode,

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:49.200
but that's not...

01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:53.200
The business works like we couldn't have produced that level of show

01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:55.200
if CISO didn't exist.

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:59.200
They had the budget to give us to do it dinner for five fucking style

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.200
and have an audience,

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:02.200
and my camera's going wooshy woosh,

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:04.200
and Lizzie Olson's on it,

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:06.200
and fucking it's a good show,

01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:09.200
because it's a little higher production value than if we did it on our own,

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.200
but the upside of that,

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.200
or the downside, or the side side of that is like,

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:16.200
okay, so CISO, they're folded,

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:19.200
they sold all their shit to Verve.

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:21.200
Verve is huge fans, they love the show.

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:23.200
It's one of my favorite bands, too.

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:24.200
Right.

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:26.200
So, you know, and then I go to you guys and I go,

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.200
hey, it's 11.99 a month now.

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:29.200
I go to you guys and they're like,

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:30.200
how is this going to...

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:31.200
How does this end?

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:32.200
Am I just in a bunker with you,

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:35.200
giving you $50 a month for your pee?

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:39.200
That's why this season we're asking you not to watch Harmon Quest.

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:44.200
We're tired of it, we're not being complicit any longer.

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:45.200
But our show...

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:51.200
Let's just be honest, our show is on dialysis and we need your money.

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.200
Yeah, for the first season.

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:53.200
What I also think they...

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:55.200
Well, yeah, they made the first season available.

01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:57.200
You can't like check out the second season, right?

01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:58.200
There might be...

01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:02.200
I would not be surprised if the first episode of the second season is free,

01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:03.200
but I'm not sure.

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:04.200
That sounds right.

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:05.200
It's a good episode, though.

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:07.200
We got Gillian Jacobs and, oh boy,

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:10.200
I don't want to say she was like very Brita-esque,

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:11.200
but it was great.

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:12.200
Why?

01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:14.200
How do you even have that much money?

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:16.200
It's just, these are singles, but...

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:17.200
What are you doing?

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:18.200
I know!

01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:20.200
This is half of the singles in my underwear drawer.

01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:21.200
Oh, okay.

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.200
Are you going to jumbos later?

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:24.200
What's happening?

01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:26.200
Why did you choose to take them out of your drawer?

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:27.200
Because I thought maybe something would come up.

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:28.200
I don't know.

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:29.200
And maybe it has.

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.200
It's like, well, if anybody feels like...

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:32.200
Did you want to make it rain?

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:33.200
Yeah, make it rain.

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:34.200
You want to make it rain.

01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:35.200
You want to make it rain.

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:37.200
If you give everyone here $1, if you give everyone here $1...

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:38.200
I think I might be...

01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:40.200
No, I probably couldn't.

01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:41.200
Try it.

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:44.200
But I could...

01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:45.200
Try it.

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:47.200
I thought he had to stuck her for dollars.

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:51.200
Or you give someone all the money, but they have to answer three riddles.

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.200
Oh, shit.

01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:59.200
Why don't I just do what I do for Trick or Treat, which is I'll put a plate at the foot

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:06.200
of the stage with a sign that says, just take one, and I'll put one of these dollars on

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:10.200
it, and fucking sleep like a baby, because then you see the empty plate, and you're like,

01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:12.200
fuck society.

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:18.200
This nice man left a bunch of money on a plate.

01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:21.200
No one ever appreciates that.

01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:23.200
Did you really do that?

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:25.200
Yeah, like, you know, put up...

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:26.200
This is a Trick or Treat trick.

01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:29.200
Look, if you didn't have time to go buy candy, put an empty bucket outside your door, and

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:37.200
put a sign that says, like, high road the fucking kids, and go, be honest, just take

01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:38.200
one.

01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:40.200
And then the kid gets to...

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:41.200
Here's the thing.

01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:43.200
It's a victimless crime.

01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:50.200
The first kid, the first kid, if there's a kid that goes Trick or Treating at 3.15

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:53.200
p.m., fuck that kid.

01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:55.200
But also, he's like a red pillar.

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:56.200
He knows.

01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:58.200
He's like, this fucking dude's pulling a scam.

01:24:58.200 --> 01:24:59.200
There's nobody here before me.

01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:00.200
Okay, fine.

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:02.200
That kid goes off and gets a serial killer.

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:06.200
Every kid after that, every kid after that goes up to the bucket.

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:11.200
He's an empty bucket and a sign that says, let's try to be nice people, huh?

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:12.200
And an empty bucket.

01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:14.200
And the kid goes like, you know what?

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:17.200
I love that there's a guy here that thought society was worth a shit.

01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:18.200
Too bad it wasn't.

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:20.200
I'm gonna move on through my day.

01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:21.200
Go get some other candy.

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:23.200
Victimless crime.

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:24.200
I got two things.

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:29.200
Okay, so the first one is, isn't it just fine to not have any candy and stuff?

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.200
Like, will people shame you or anything like that?

01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:32.200
Is that something you have to worry about?

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:35.200
Well, I have a lockable gate in the front of my estate now, so that's just not really

01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:36.200
an issue anymore.

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:38.200
Well, it just means, you know, there's a lot of...

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:41.200
I could just hit a button shape like a bat and fucking turrets like pointed.

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:46.200
The kids, you have 10 seconds to expect less.

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:49.200
Did you fear your trees getting tepied?

01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:50.200
Right, yeah.

01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:54.200
Like, what's the downside of just not having candy?

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:55.200
That's pretty standard, right?

01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:04.200
If they're gonna tepee my trees, first of all, they're only hurting my gardener.

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:06.200
Second of all, and I'll put that on the note.

01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:08.200
Dan, what I like about you is their front door.

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:12.200
The more success that you achieve, the more relatable you become.

01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:16.200
I'm not trying to be relatable anymore, man.

01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:19.200
I'm just trying to be honest, brother.

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:21.200
You've become a man of the people.

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:24.200
Yeah, I'm salt of the earth now.

01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:32.200
A big salt of the earth orbiting the earth on a military grade platform, hoarding the

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:35.200
oxygen it steals.

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:40.200
I thought you were saying that you put a bowl out with a $1 bill in it and said,

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:41.200
please just take one.

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:45.200
And then somebody goes, oh, fuck, somebody got all the money.

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:47.200
Right, well, I am saying that.

01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:48.200
I mean, it's an interesting twist.

01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:51.200
You have one piece of candy you put in the bucket and it's the last one left.

01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:52.200
See how long it lasts.

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:55.200
But if you have that kind of time, buy a bag of candy.

01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:57.200
Right, it would be hard to get one piece of candy.

01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:59.200
This is for a guy who didn't have time to buy candy.

01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:02.200
I'm not being cruel, I'm not like a weird monster.

01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:07.200
Yeah, but you have like two full-sized Snickers in there.

01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:08.200
It says, please just take one.

01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:12.200
But you have a camera rig, like the way to take a picture of you when you're going down

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:13.200
Splash Mountain.

01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:18.200
And so the kid walks away with two Snickers and he's got a picture of him.

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:21.200
But he also gets to buy that picture if he wants.

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:23.200
Look, I'll tell you what, man.

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:27.200
Once you get over 30, it's like the pressure gets on, unless you live in a really specific

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:31.200
neighborhood that's designed for people to buy the house because it looks like a house

01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:34.200
where they can't wait to give that candy a trick or treat and designed for the parents

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:36.200
to drop their kids off at that cul-de-sac.

01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:41.200
Like every other place in Los Angeles, it's like, you start to like, it becomes an exercise

01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:47.200
and the fucking primatological anxiety, like you open the door and there's like a 15-year-old

01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:55.200
dude that put like a fucking ski cap on his head because that's his costume and he's

01:27:55.200 --> 01:28:00.200
like holding his shirt out going, give me candy and you're like, Jesus Christ, don't

01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:01.200
kill me.

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.200
Like it's a big city, man.

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:05.200
There's no charm to trick or treat.

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:06.200
Like it's kind of like the purge now.

01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:11.200
I just kind of like, Ethan hawk into my bedroom and watch through a camera.

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:16.200
I say this Halloween, we just break into Steve's roommate's car and put all our candy in there

01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:20.200
and the kids have to go and kind of pretend to break into that car.

01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:27.200
Did I ever share the story of when I was, me and my friend, my best friend Ram Stack,

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:33.200
we were like, I think we were like 11 or 12 and we were like, we were kind of doing that.

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:39.200
We were like, we put some dirt on our face so we had hobo costumes and we were like going

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:41.200
and trick or treating like, free candy.

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:49.200
And then like, here comes Jenny Vote who is like the crush of my life in grade school

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:53.200
and she's like walking and she's got this like little girl with her, like maybe a little

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:57.200
sister is dressed like an astronaut or a princess or something.

01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:02.200
And it's always Jenny Vote and I got like soot on my face and I'm like, hey, what's

01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:03.200
going on?

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:05.200
And she's like, yeah, you trick or treating?

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:06.200
I'm like, yeah, are you?

01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:09.200
And she's like, well, she is.

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:15.200
She was like on fucking like, you know, chaperoning because she was a grown up because she was

01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:16.200
my age.

01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:23.200
That's like one of those big moments where the girls grow up fast and then you're like,

01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:26.200
I'm a fucking worst.

01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:28.200
I was a worst person at that age.

01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:33.200
We would go up to the top of the steep hill and take the pumpkins from people's front

01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:40.200
guards and then spray him like awkward spray paint and light them on fire and roll them

01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:45.200
down hill and it's pretty scary when you see a jack-o-lantern coming at you on fire.

01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:52.200
But then the problem that, you know, the bad part of that is that at the end there's a house

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:59.200
and a flaming incendiary device is going into the juniper tree in their front yard and going

01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:00.200
to kill everybody.

01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:04.200
At the end of it is a whole society that's just like, oh, so you kids just don't give

01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:05.200
a fuck.

01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:07.200
Like I feel so bad about being a kid now.

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:09.200
Like we used to just like throw shit at cars.

01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:10.200
Like we didn't get it.

01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:12.200
We thought we were the goonies.

01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:14.200
Did we talk about windows happen?

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:15.200
Yeah.

01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:16.200
With the penny in the tape.

01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:17.200
Did we ever talk about this?

01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:19.200
Wait, my penny tapping?

01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:20.200
No, window tapping.

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:21.200
Penny tapping.

01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:22.200
We called it penny tapping.

01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.200
Yeah.

01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:24.200
Did you tell me about this?

01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:25.200
Yeah.

01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:26.200
I told you about penny tapping.

01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:27.200
Yeah, that's fucking it.

01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:28.200
That's some sinister shit.

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:29.200
Yeah.

01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:30.200
But that's like the most benign thing of all.

01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:31.200
Yeah, but it's just tortures.

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:32.200
That is beauty shit.

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:33.200
I know.

01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:34.200
But at least, yeah.

01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:35.200
Well, you know what?

01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:36.200
Now that I think about it.

01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:40.200
But it's because you're implying to a person that someone's tapping on their window.

01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:44.200
Like now you look at it through a modern lens, you're like, that's a horrible thing to do

01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:45.200
to somebody.

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:46.200
But we were kids.

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:47.200
It was the 80s.

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:49.200
So we thought, well, they will think it's like Slender Man.

01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:50.200
I didn't.

01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:53.200
I was invented in 2013.

01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:57.200
Shut the fuck up, you fucking uncreative, shitty generation.

01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:00.200
That's been our show.

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:03.200
Thank you very much for coming.

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:05.200
What if a guy had long arms?

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:09.200
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:13.200
You have an entire internet to create mythology.

01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:19.200
You are bad kids.

01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:22.200
All right.

01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:23.200
That's mine.

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:30.200
Simon wanted us to plug his Kickstarter, The Crawling King.

01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:34.200
So I guess Starburns, they're doing a project called The Crawling King.

01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:40.200
It's going to be a hard written horror fantasy with almost 200 pages of incredibly insane

01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:41.200
art.

01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:46.200
Are you available as a publicist?

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:49.200
I can fill that role sometimes.

01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:53.200
I just like, yeah, whatever you're selling, I'm buying.

01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:54.200
All right.

01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:55.200
How do you access it?

01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:59.200
Can I pitch something that is happening here at the Starburns Castle?

01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:01.200
It's something I actually believe in because I went last Wednesday.

01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:04.200
Church, three more weekends?

01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:06.200
How many more weekends is Eddie here?

01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:07.200
Three.

01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:09.200
Eddie Pepitone is one of my favorite comics of all time.

01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:11.200
Was anybody here on Wednesday?

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:13.200
It was absolutely wonderful.

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:15.200
He's a crazy genius, wonderful.

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:21.200
It's partly material, partly just rift, and you just watch a really, really funny guy

01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:24.200
lose his fucking mind in front of your eyes, and it was magical.

01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:29.200
So I'm sad that I'm going to be out of town for the next two Wednesdays, but if you're

01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:33.200
free, come here on Wednesdays to see Eddie Pepitone.

01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:37.200
Look it up at StarburnsIndustries.com, right, Church?

01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:38.200
StarburnsCastle.com.

01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:39.200
StarburnsCastle.com.

01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:41.200
It's really good stuff, and he's a monster.

01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:46.200
If you don't already know him, you must, because he's doing comedy the way, like, stand

01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:48.200
up, ought to aspire to, I think.

01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:49.200
I love him.

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:52.200
Pepitone is the best at tone.

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:54.200
No, no takers?

01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:58.200
Pepitone is the best at tone?

01:32:58.200 --> 01:32:59.200
I know, I tried.

01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:01.200
It's better than him.

01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:03.200
Did you hear that?

01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:06.200
Simon wants you to do that.

01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:07.200
I guess it's a horror series.

01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:10.200
I guess there's a thing someone wants you to do.

01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:11.200
What?

01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:12.200
Yeah.

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:13.200
Well, how do we in?

01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:18.760
I guess they took a dog's blood and extracted the oxygen from it, and it's a new sports

01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:21.200
drink that makes you sad.

01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:29.200
It's called Doggone Energy.

01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:31.000
You sound like an experiment.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Your heart is broken.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.000
You had a heartbreak.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.000
I did, yeah.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Recently?

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Yeah, this last week.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.200
But you opened with a car breaking, but you actually had a real break.

01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:44.200
He's like one of these boy scouts he doesn't want to talk about.

01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:49.200
He's not like me, he's like, get up on stage and go, yeah, girl broke my heart.

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:52.200
I mean, broken hearted?

01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:55.200
I mean, look, I'm numb these days.

01:33:55.200 --> 01:34:01.200
It was like two and a half months ago, that one was like I wasn't eating, I couldn't sleep.

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:03.200
But this one, I was just like, I'm tired.

01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:06.200
But your ad reads last time were amazing.

01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:09.200
Now we can tell that you're hurting yourself.

01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:11.200
I'm making a lot of it.

01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:13.200
Can we talk about it at all?

01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:14.200
If you want.

01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:15.200
I'd love to.

01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:18.200
Oh, geez, okay.

01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:23.200
Like, were you in love and love or falling in love or infatuated?

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:24.200
Which one?

01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:28.200
I mean, that's the question.

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:34.200
That's what multiple choice questions are all about.

01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:39.200
This one we, I don't know, we've loved each other for a long time and we're trying to

01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:40.200
make it work.

01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:49.200
But, you know, it's, she was like, the girl I've been chasing my whole life kind of thing.

01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:53.200
It was like 16 years in the making.

01:34:53.200 --> 01:35:00.200
And I don't think we gave it much of a chance this time around.

01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:03.200
Like, you know, you know, whatever.

01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:06.200
Wait, I'm not, that was a joke, right?

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:07.200
Are you?

01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:09.200
No, no, I mean like.

01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:10.200
I thought it was.

01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:12.200
That's like a note that a writer would write.

01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:13.200
That's a joke.

01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:14.200
No, I know.

01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:15.200
He's one of you.

01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:18.200
This time around, this time around they didn't give it a chance.

01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:19.200
Oh, yeah.

01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:24.200
No, we, it was like, I, it was always like unrequited, but we, our friendship like just got stronger

01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:27.200
and stronger until we were able to finally cross a threshold.

01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:32.200
And then this summer it was like, let's try, let's actually try to have a, a relationship.

01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:33.200
Well, you know what, Steve?

01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:35.200
Let's bring her out.

01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:38.200
Put your hands together.

01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:39.200
Yeah.

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:40.200
Yeah.

01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:41.200
Yeah.

01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:42.200
Yeah.

01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:43.200
That'd be amazing.

01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:50.200
It's a nice show called This Isn't Your Wife.

01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:51.200
What?

01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:52.200
It's hilarious.

01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:53.200
It's hilarious.

01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:54.200
I stand by it.

01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:57.200
I stand by it.

01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:59.200
You laughed through your own grog.

01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:04.200
But yeah, I mean, I, you know, it's nice.

01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:06.200
You're, you're, you're a good guy.

01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:12.200
Like, like, like in my, in my day, like that would, that's, that just goes right into the

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:16.200
misogyny engine because the way to recover from that, like sure is like you get bit by

01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:19.200
a snake, you rub it in dirt or whatever you do.

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:20.200
And that's a bad example.

01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:24.200
I don't know anything, I don't know anything about primal medicine.

01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:25.200
Can we put a pin on that thought?

01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:26.200
All right.

01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:29.200
It's like, you know how, like you burn your thumb and then you shove it in your mouth.

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:33.200
And it's like, probably that's not helping as much as some other counterintuitive thing,

01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:35.200
like you're supposed to pee on it or let a bee lick it.

01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:36.200
I don't know.

01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:40.200
But like you, you millennials, you're a millennial, right?

01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:41.200
You're 40.

01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:42.200
Yeah.

01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:47.200
Like you kids, like you're very, like you're, you're, you don't go to that place.

01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:50.200
Like I've met this young lady, like, like she's cool.

01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:51.200
You're cool.

01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:54.200
Like, like, and so that's, it's, it's like you have a harder thing to deal with because

01:36:54.200 --> 01:37:00.200
you don't get to go to the places that I got to go to when I was an adolescent or even

01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:01.200
in my 30s.

01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:03.200
I was still like fucking, okay.

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.200
Well, that's easy.

01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:05.200
That's easy.

01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:06.200
Bitches is crazy.

01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:10.200
You know, like, like, like I'll leave a shitty comment on her blog and yeah, like, like,

01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:13.200
like, like fuck all women and it's women against men and all that stuff.

01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:17.200
Like you kids are, you kids, my kids, I mean, 35 year olds.

01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:18.200
You're, you're growing.

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:21.200
I'm not 35.

01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:23.200
I want to say good for you.

01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:26.200
You're, you're being a mensch and a gentleman and I know that hurts more.

01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:28.200
You're having to deal with more pain.

01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:30.200
You're having to manage more pain on your own.

01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:32.200
It's, that's like very applaudable.

01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:34.200
You should know people appreciate that.

01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:38.200
It's like, like, like you're not going to a dark place and that that's harder to do.

01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:39.200
That's fucking cool.

01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:40.200
Love you.

01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:41.200
Thanks.

01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:42.200
Thanks.

01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:45.200
And you'll like, like she'll be fine and you'll be fine.

01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:47.200
And like it's like, it's like Tabasco.

01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:48.200
It burns your tongue.

01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:49.200
It's not real pain.

01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:55.200
It's like fucking totally okay to say this fucking burns and totally the only thing you

01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:57.200
don't want to do is go, oh, my tongue's on fire.

01:37:57.200 --> 01:37:59.200
I should, I should cut it off.

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:02.200
You know, like it's just like, oh, it fucking burns.

01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:05.200
And like you feel the, feel the, feel the burns.

01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:14.200
But, but, but yeah, I'm in your corner.

01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:15.200
I know you are.

01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:18.200
You've been an incredible advocate.

01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:23.200
You have.

01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:28.200
Here's how, here's how much of a mensch and a sweetheart you are.

01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:32.200
Is that when you said it's been a crazy week, that was the more painful thing.

01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:36.200
But you, but you chose to speak about something bad happened to your friend.

01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:37.200
Right.

01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:38.200
That his car got broken into.

01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:41.200
That's like, you're, you're such a sweet guy.

01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:42.200
Yeah.

01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:43.200
Thanks.

01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:46.200
Don't, don't let that eat you up.

01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:50.200
You know, like, don't, you know, like it's like, like you're one end of the spectrum.

01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:52.200
I'm the other end where I'm like, my shoe hurts.

01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:53.200
Fuck America.

01:38:53.200 --> 01:39:00.200
Wipe my ass on everyone until I get tired and I'm out of shit from my ass and everyone's

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:02.200
like, there's shit all over me.

01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:04.200
I'm like, good night.

01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:06.200
That's one way of handling things.

01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:09.200
And then there's like this other thing where it's like, don't get, you know, like somewhere

01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:11.200
in the middle is like a rhythm.

01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:13.200
Will you go see my therapist?

01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:15.200
I told you I'd pay for it.

01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:16.200
She's worried about you.

01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:21.200
Just based on her conversations where you, you arranged to pay for my therapy.

01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:22.200
Yeah.

01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:23.200
She's like, how's Steve Levy?

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:25.200
You offered after the last one.

01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:26.200
Yeah.

01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:29.200
I can tell when he, when I invoice him that he's ready to pop.

01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:33.200
Well, you know, sometimes guys, the best therapy is to live out a life of fantasy.

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:35.200
Why don't we play a little bit of D&D?

01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:40.200
Oh yeah.

01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:43.200
Last time.

01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:45.200
What happened?

01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:46.200
All right.

01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:47.200
Who dumped you?

01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:48.200
What?

01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:51.200
People dump me all the time and I don't bring it up.

01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:52.200
Steve?

01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:53.200
Oh shit.

01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:54.200
Oh fuck.

01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:55.200
No, it's a joke.

01:39:55.200 --> 01:40:00.200
You find yourself on a high road.

01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:06.200
It's treacherous goings.

01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:07.200
No, what happened?

01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:09.200
We, we, we found some bandits.

01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:11.200
We left with the, with Patchens.

01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:12.200
Right.

01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:13.200
Leaving the church with Patchens.

01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:16.200
Banditos attacked and they got him.

01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:18.200
The end.

01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:20.200
I'm still unconscious, right?

01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:21.200
Did we, did we lose Patchens?

01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:23.200
Patchens is gone?

01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:28.200
That's a great question to ask in character.

01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:31.200
Well, we, we know that the, that the prior boned out.

01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:32.200
He de-camped.

01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:34.200
He left us cause he wanted to get out.

01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:35.200
Yeah.

01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:36.200
So you're at the campground.

01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:40.200
One of, one of the guys, one of the guys Dan touched with his inflict wounds and he kind

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:41.200
of withered.

01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:42.200
Yeah.

01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:43.200
That guy's kind of hobbling away.

01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:47.200
And then there's another guy who you clubbed his, he clubbed him in the head and he kind

01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:49.200
of just went down coal.

01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:54.200
The rest of the banditos have kind of escaped at this point and they made off with Patchens'

01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:55.200
clothes.

01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:58.200
They took Patchens' clothes but I took some clothes off another dead guy and put them on

01:40:58.200 --> 01:40:59.200
Patchens.

01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:00.200
Right.

01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:01.200
I go up to Patchens.

01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:02.200
Patchens, can you hear me?

01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:03.200
How are you?

01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:04.200
Ugh.

01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:05.200
Ugh.

01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:06.200
Ugh.

01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:07.200
Ugh.

01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:08.200
Oh my God.

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:09.200
Ugh.

01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:10.200
I'm stabbed.

01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:15.200
Patchens, is your character so important to our story that I should heal you?

01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:16.200
These little kinds of-

01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:18.200
Why should you have to ask that?

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:19.200
He's Patchens.

01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:20.200
I'll answer that.

01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:21.200
Okay.

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:24.200
These are the moral questions you've got to decide.

01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:28.200
I have a little PTSD from fighting these, for those banditos.

01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:30.200
That's in real life.

01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:33.200
Where are my clothes?

01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:36.200
Some other guy took them but you're wearing a bandito's outfit right now.

01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:37.200
Jesus Christ.

01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:38.200
Oh my God.

01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:39.200
He starts sobbing inconsolably.

01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:43.200
He's like, he's thrashing around and like clawing at the soil.

01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:44.200
I'm going to fix this.

01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:47.200
I want to follow the hobbling bandito.

01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:48.200
Okay.

01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:49.200
He's slower, right?

01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:50.200
Yeah.

01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:51.200
So I'm going to go grab him.

01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:52.200
All right.

01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:53.200
You're just grabbing him?

01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:54.200
Well, if I can.

01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:55.200
Yeah, yeah.

01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:56.200
Well-

01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:57.200
If I may.

01:41:57.200 --> 01:41:58.200
Yeah.

01:41:58.200 --> 01:41:59.200
No.

01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:00.200
I mean, there's a lot of ways to approach the guy.

01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:01.200
But yeah, that works.

01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:02.200
Okay.

01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:03.200
So I'm sorry.

01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:04.200
You rolled a two.

01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:05.200
You do not grab him.

01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:06.200
Yeah.

01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:07.200
No.

01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:09.200
You definitely don't grab him.

01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:13.200
But he's still just hobbling away so you can essentially try.

01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:14.200
Yeah.

01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:16.200
I walk up to Patchens and I cure light wounds.

01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:17.200
Okay.

01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:18.200
Light wounds.

01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:19.200
That's 1d8.

01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:20.200
All right.

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:22.200
He heals eight damage.

01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:27.200
Most of his wounds are starting to scab over, but he's not like completely healed and he's

01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:33.200
still just, you know, I don't know, insane almost.

01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:35.200
You want to grab him again?

01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:36.200
Do you want to do something?

01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:37.200
I think I'm unconscious.

01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:38.200
Yeah.

01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:39.200
That's true.

01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:40.200
Oh, Steve, you're dreaming.

01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:45.200
You're dreaming about that same door that Rob Schrab's version of you was dreaming about.

01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:46.200
Yeah.

01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:50.200
Carlos, we got a bigger fish to fry here.

01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:55.200
Our friend Diarrhea Jr. here, he's got a demon mist inside him.

01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:56.200
We got to help this guy.

01:42:56.200 --> 01:43:02.200
I don't have time to explain, but a lot of medicine has to do with state of mind and

01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:05.200
he needs to confront his tormentor.

01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:06.200
Who does?

01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:07.200
Huh?

01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:09.200
Who has to confront who?

01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:10.200
Patchens.

01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:11.200
I'll be right there.

01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:12.200
Okay.

01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:13.200
I just, I rolled a two.

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:14.200
Sorry.

01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:15.200
I'll be back already.

01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:16.200
Okay.

01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:17.200
I got you.

01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:18.200
All right.

01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:19.200
You grab him this time.

01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:20.200
All right.

01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:21.200
Can I drag him over?

01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:22.200
All right.

01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:28.280
He is still armed, so, yeah, he doesn't, he doesn't stab you, but he's, if you don't like

01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:31.200
really restrain him, like you're, you're like grappling one of them, you know, but if you

01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:33.200
don't really restrain him, he might keep stabbing you.

01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:38.720
I pull him, I pull him by the hair and I, and I, and I, you know, I say in a, in a very

01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:43.320
convicted voice because the truth is my character in these moments is convicted about these

01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:44.320
kinds of things.

01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:45.320
Okay.

01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:52.640
I say, if you one more time make the wrong decision about, about who you're trying to

01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:59.320
harm, I, I, I will kill you and that will be the beginning of your misery.

01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:00.320
Okay.

01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:05.080
I'm an expert on these things.

01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:10.400
There is a silver flame that guides us and it will make an example of you.

01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:14.600
Do you have, do you have intimidate or diplomacy?

01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:17.200
But isn't it, isn't it more intimidating if I don't have those things?

01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:23.640
I'm like, you know, like how many times are we the victims of a charming bully?

01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:26.560
They usually have like bad grammar and, okay, let me look.

01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:27.560
Sorry.

01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:37.880
There's a whole stack of papers and I, I, the Mrs. and I were recently and, uh, other

01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:48.760
side, uh, looking for intimidate diplomacy, no, that's a zero and, uh, diplomacy.

01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:49.760
There's a check mark.

01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:50.760
Okay.

01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:51.760
Great.

01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:52.760
Um, but no numbers.

01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:53.760
Right.

01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:54.760
Do have it.

01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:55.760
It's just not measurable.

01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:56.760
Well, yeah.

01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:00.060
Same could be true of all of us.

01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:01.560
You definitely scare him.

01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:04.160
He's like, Jesus, oh boy.

01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:05.960
That's a bad, uh, yeah.

01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:06.960
Okay.

01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:08.680
You're at a fork in your life.

01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:10.480
You were a bandito.

01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:13.120
Now you're a hostage.

01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:18.120
Your behavior as a hostage could lead you to the main road of humanity, something you

01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:20.320
departed when you became a bandito.

01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:21.840
Probably your dad's fault.

01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:22.840
Okay.

01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:24.040
I'm your new dad.

01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:25.040
I'm taking you back.

01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:28.880
You don't have to be a hostage forever.

01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:33.160
You could die a hostage or you could spend a time as a hostage proving that you're a

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:34.160
human.

01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:35.160
All right.

01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:37.160
Okay.

01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:43.680
It, it's not checked and then there's a, it says total bonus and there's a three in

01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:44.680
parenthesis.

01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:45.680
Perfect.

01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:50.680
I'm that perceptive.

01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:52.680
All right.

01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:53.680
Okay.

01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:54.680
So now obviously, come on.

01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:55.680
Huh?

01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:57.640
You just asked me what my perception was and now you're saying nothing.

01:45:57.640 --> 01:45:58.640
Right.

01:45:58.640 --> 01:45:59.640
Well, so how is that?

01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:00.640
I'm not, what is this?

01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:02.120
I'm paranoid now.

01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:03.120
Huh?

01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:04.120
What didn't I perceive?

01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:05.120
Yeah.

01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:06.120
What didn't you perceive?

01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:07.120
I grab, I pull his hair.

01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:08.640
I go, what am I not perceiving here?

01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:09.640
What are you talking about?

01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:10.640
What are you doing?

01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:11.640
I look at his hand.

01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:12.640
He swallows hard.

01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:13.640
What?

01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:15.400
You dirty, shitty person.

01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:16.400
I walk over.

01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:17.400
I, I have 11 perception.

01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:18.400
Let me try.

01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:20.840
Hey, Carlos, what are we trying to perceive?

01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:22.340
He swallowed something.

01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:23.340
Open up.

01:46:23.340 --> 01:46:24.340
Drop it.

01:46:24.340 --> 01:46:25.340
Drop it.

01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:26.340
All right.

01:46:26.340 --> 01:46:27.340
He opens his mouth.

01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:28.340
I reach in and pull his jaw open.

01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:29.340
Yeah.

01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:30.340
Yeah.

01:46:30.340 --> 01:46:31.340
Yeah.

01:46:31.340 --> 01:46:32.340
I would pull it, drop it.

01:46:32.340 --> 01:46:33.340
Drop it.

01:46:33.340 --> 01:46:34.340
He didn't have anything in his mouth.

01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:35.940
He just swallowed nervously, I think.

01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:39.140
He wasn't swallowing the microfilm.

01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:45.740
Alternately, if you swallow something, it no longer remains in your mouth.

01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:48.340
I, I, I punch him in the stomach.

01:46:48.340 --> 01:46:49.340
All right.

01:46:49.340 --> 01:46:53.220
I'm trying to, I, I, I, I, I have induced vomit.

01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:58.260
Give him a Heimlich, like, like, like, like, like, hold him upside down, go old school

01:46:58.260 --> 01:46:59.260
on this guy.

01:46:59.260 --> 01:47:00.260
All right.

01:47:00.260 --> 01:47:03.340
Well, you punch him in the stomach, but it doesn't make him throw up.

01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:04.460
He just takes a couple of damage.

01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:05.460
He swallowed some.

01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:06.460
All right.

01:47:06.460 --> 01:47:07.460
Well, it doesn't, you know what?

01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:08.460
It doesn't matter.

01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:09.460
I only brought him over here for one thing.

01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:10.460
It's not like we're on an adventure where we need to know where the treasure is.

01:47:10.460 --> 01:47:11.460
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:12.460
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

01:47:12.460 --> 01:47:31.980
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

01:47:31.980 --> 01:47:36.860
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:41.960
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:47.740
In what's wait. Okay. Are you gonna kill him though? Patches? No, no the guy. No, I'm gonna die

01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:53.440
He's going to die. I want to shake him upside down and make him cough up whatever he had. How is he going?

01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:55.840
Okay, well that doesn't work. Okay. I

01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:59.380
Invent the Heimlich maneuvering him the Heimlich maneuver. All right

01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:02.560
Well, yeah, um

01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:11.400
Yeah, I see it. Yeah, I don't even know. How do you critically fail a non-Heimlich?

01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:22.000
I smash his sternum in. Well, yeah, you can hear ribs cracking as you give him the Heimlich maneuver and after way

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:31.240
Too many attempts he finally starts to choke something up and it gets lodged in his throat and dies. Patches, Patches watch. See Patches? See?

01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:34.680
See the will of the eternal flame?

01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:40.840
Patches is like still for a moment and then he just starts like thrashing an overdrive. It's okay

01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:48.000
I reach in and grab the thing that I kind of perceived with my 11 perception that he choked up. He choked on it

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Looks like a big weird pill. Oh, I

01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:58.800
Examine the pill it looks big and weird and a little bit dissolved, but only a little tiny bit

01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:04.960
Oh, so he was trying to take his own life. He was trying to like Hermann Göring his way out of not standard bandito protocol

01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:10.800
Yeah, what why what do these guys have to hide they want to take their own lives? Perhaps these banditos

01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:18.560
No more than we knows

01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:25.880
Should we search him you can sure Patchens you okay?

01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:33.880
He's he's just screaming. He's saying I can't believe it's God. Oh my god. I have one job. Oh my god

01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:37.600
What is it? Oh my god? He's like he's he's clutching at you

01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:42.280
You know like when someone's like hysterical with with with pain and agony

01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:47.600
You don't know what they're doing like he's doing that and he's like just kind of slapping you like he's I don't know

01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:54.080
And you could at that some point you figure out what he's doing is he's trying to grab like a knife out of your wallet and stuff

01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:57.760
Like he's trying to grab a knife from you. Patches. Why do you want my knife? He?

01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:04.560
He doesn't grab it. He just grabs at it. He's just like I can't handle this

01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:07.320
Patchens you got to tell me what what you lost? I

01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:14.000
Had the game I was sent to her own

01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:19.280
For one read just to keep this thing safe. It's like I don't know what it is

01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:23.720
It's like a treasure sacred treasure. I don't know. I don't know

01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:30.600
What does it look like? It's like a like the it's like a big big gem like the most beautiful jewel you've ever seen

01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:38.600
And all I was supposed to do was just lay low and you know hide and I figured after there was all those boogins

01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:41.220
I should probably relocate but fuck wait

01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:44.080
Did one of the banditos just take that jewel that you had on you?

01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:50.000
Well, my clothes is gone and I'm stamped up. We gotta get those banditos. I thought this was just a

01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:57.320
Pantons, why don't you tell us you had precious jewel treasures on you before the boogins came up because I'm not supposed to tell anybody

01:50:57.320 --> 01:51:03.160
That's part of the whole thing. If I you couldn't steal it. You could be you know agents of shield

01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:12.520
I I grabbed the bandito that's that's that's there just it was he dead that one that was the choking one

01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:17.800
Yeah, he's dead. Yeah, are there any live live banditos? There's one. That's of indeterminate status

01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:20.280
He's he's he's got a caved-in helmet. I

01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:27.480
I search him to see if he's got the jet the jet the other guys ran off of the jet right for sure. Yeah

01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:30.920
So we fucked I search I search that guy anyway

01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:37.880
Yeah, okay, you search him you find what do you find you find under his regular bandito clothes

01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:43.400
He has very finely crafted stuttered leather armor. It's very quiet and stealthy

01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:48.040
It seems like it was meant to be hidden underneath normal clothes. What size is he?

01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:53.000
Uh, he's a human. He's a human. Yeah, a little big for me. Yeah, shit

01:51:53.240 --> 01:52:00.520
And then you also see a dagger. He's got a dagger and a short sword and they both seem of incredibly fine make like

01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:06.200
Like master work weapons. You don't even know who made them, but it was a real real master

01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:11.880
Well, I'm small. I take that dagger and I give this who wants this awesome sword. You guys are sword peoples

01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:18.200
I don't I don't use blades. I'm gonna. I will check the dead guy. I want to see if that's the same thing

01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:22.200
Are these guys all like this? Um, yeah, you search him too and you get the same thing

01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:28.600
So I didn't quite finish so I'll just so there's also a poison pill in the one who didn't take a poison pills

01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:35.720
Pake and then one of them has a little note, but it's it's like with like script and symbols and runes and stuff

01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:41.640
It's it doesn't seem like any written language. It seems like a code except to someone with knowledge arcana

01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:50.200
It's clearly not magical. It's uh, it's just uh, it's just a normal code knowledge history

01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:54.280
Do you how many points do you have a knowledge history?

01:52:55.240 --> 01:52:57.080
It's a check mark, but

01:52:57.080 --> 01:52:58.440
But no points

01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:08.200
Okay, you recognize it is it seems to use a basic a basic standard of symbology used in uh, the guilds for trading purposes

01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:11.560
So it's like a symbology a symbolic language. That's not

01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:18.120
Exactly like for speaking. It's not like the you know, it's not common or anything. It's just like its own language

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:24.360
But that's the only thing you only recognize the symbols like you don't actually know what they mean and you couldn't read it

01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:29.160
If you wanted knowledge, nobility

01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:32.120
All right

01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:33.960
nobility

01:53:33.960 --> 01:53:36.120
Occasionally learns that symbol language

01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:40.440
Knowledge religions

01:53:42.760 --> 01:53:46.120
Some religions disagree with that symbol language

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.680
Linguistics, but I don't think you have knowledge linguistics. I do

01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:53.240
check mark

01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:56.840
Do you have any points in it? No, I don't point to any of this shit

01:53:57.720 --> 01:53:59.720
a fucking second third level

01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:01.640
fucking

01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:03.640
like look it's

01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:05.960
I know this this language

01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:09.400
It's a trading language

01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:11.400
These people aren't banditos

01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:13.400
They're stock brokers

01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:18.600
I I take that dagger I take the symbols written on a note

01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:26.600
Uh, yeah, okay. I take that note and then I take the poison pill and I put it in his mouth

01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:31.000
And then I say where are your friends staying?

01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:34.120
And I won't make you swallow this pill

01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:40.360
Who are you saying that to the guy to the bandito? Which one the one that's not dead. They're both dead. They're both dead

01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:43.720
I take his dagger to stab him eight times

01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:50.200
Oh, man, it's no good. I'm just just testing out the strength of the dagger. It's it slides through easily

01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:53.240
as if it's

01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:58.600
Magically sharp these guys weren't regular banditos and they've got they've got patches precious gem

01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:01.720
Yeah, but we've also got a sick diarrhea on right?

01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:05.000
He's dying over here. He's got that mist

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:10.440
I think the mist went into the keyhole in his heart and he's infected with some sort of horrible demonic business

01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:16.040
Yeah, we got we got to get him to the church. I gotta get him to the church, but no we got to get patches gem back

01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:20.280
But what if at the expense of killing dj?

01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:25.720
What sorry we should go to dj's dream probably is that okay? Yeah

01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:29.080
There's a door

01:55:29.320 --> 01:55:31.480
There's sounds behind it. You don't know what they are

01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:34.280
Can I open the door? Do you want to?

01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:36.920
You don't know until you try

01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:41.240
Okay, I I I put my ear against the door to listen

01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:42.520
What is it?

01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:45.960
What will give me some of those sounds as you're putting your ear to the door?

01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:52.200
Like there's just a big smash on the door like someone's beating against it really spooks you out and then it's followed by like

01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:56.760
Do I have my weapons? Uh, no, you're naked. I'm naked. Yeah, it's a dream

01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:03.160
Ride or die, I guess open the door

01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:05.960
All right as you touch the door

01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:13.400
It opens or the the door kind of disappears and just behind it is blackness and the blackness kind of spreads up your body

01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:16.840
And you become consumed by the darkness and you wake up in a cold sweat

01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:25.000
Like i'm i'm actually awake now. Yeah. Yeah, you're awake awake. Holy shit. What the fuck you've been stabbed multiple times
