WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.360
All right, from Dining with Hypewriter, the Dingleberry Toggle model from MacArthur Park,

00:07.360 --> 00:08.360
Los Angeles.

00:08.360 --> 00:18.680
My name is Jeff Davis, you're Comptroller, Harmontown is now in session.

00:18.680 --> 00:22.840
I see Dave Kline down there, can I get a Upe for the whole audience?

00:22.840 --> 00:29.840
Let's welcome Spencer Crittenden in your Game Master, extraordinaire.

00:29.840 --> 00:39.840
Spencer, there he is.

00:39.840 --> 00:55.440
For good measure, let's welcome the Mayor of Harmontown, the eponymous Dan Harmon.

00:55.440 --> 00:56.440
Thank you.

00:56.440 --> 01:05.120
Yo, yo, yo, yo, emmy night, fight for your life, go down the red carpet and the lime

01:05.120 --> 01:09.800
life, celebrate your director and agent, fuck your mama so hard, she was hatin'

01:09.800 --> 01:17.280
up, Christiansen, use the dark side of the force to get in to your mama's pussy, Sandman.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.800
All right, thank you.

01:19.800 --> 01:26.280
I don't know, I don't know why, sometimes, yeah, I'll make you this deal, every night

01:26.280 --> 01:31.440
I come out, I'll see if I start rapping good, and if I don't, like, just the other side

01:31.440 --> 01:36.280
of the deal is, just let me stop, and I don't think it's gonna be hard.

01:36.280 --> 01:39.320
That sounds like it solves a lot of the problems with the rapping.

01:39.320 --> 01:43.760
I don't hear anybody protesting, no, keep rapping, after it turns out you're gonna

01:43.760 --> 01:50.080
rap badly, keep going, push through it, fake it till you make it, I think this is the easiest

01:50.080 --> 01:51.080
deal we've ever made.

01:51.080 --> 01:55.640
Isn't it true, though, that, I think it's axiomatic that when you win an emmy, your

01:55.640 --> 02:03.160
rapping skills dip for a while?

02:03.160 --> 02:07.840
Did I win another emmy?

02:07.840 --> 02:12.080
Do I have twice as many emmys as I had before the emmys?

02:12.080 --> 02:14.720
Yeah, no, I have a...

02:14.720 --> 02:18.680
How many people got to keep the statute, did you get one?

02:18.680 --> 02:21.720
Jesus Christ, yes.

02:21.720 --> 02:33.920
It is fascinating, though, when you win one, your fantasy of what it would be like is sort

02:33.920 --> 02:42.760
of simultaneously, everything about it is true, and simultaneously, it's so demystifying.

02:42.760 --> 02:50.040
I'm not sure what I mean by that, but it's like you picture yourself going up, and you

02:50.040 --> 02:56.680
hold this thing, and you're like, holy shit, this happened, and it feels like a scratch-off

02:56.680 --> 03:01.240
ticket, it just sort of is random, you just have this weird relationship, is this gonna

03:01.240 --> 03:06.600
happen or not, and then you're walking into a fantasy, and then the really weird thing

03:06.600 --> 03:13.480
is that you're just sort of like directed off stage, and then there's just all this

03:13.480 --> 03:18.400
shit that happens, and none of it, it's like, you know, when you're on ecstasy or mushrooms

03:18.400 --> 03:24.320
or something where life is a joke, and the whole system is geared around people that

03:24.320 --> 03:28.880
are gonna feel that way, so it's very much like a slaughterhouse.

03:28.880 --> 03:37.680
It's like the opposite of a slaughterhouse, it's an immortality house, because they know

03:37.680 --> 03:45.800
that they're working with dazed narcissists who are like, moo, I want an Emmy, and you

03:45.800 --> 03:53.400
just follow robot chicken, and you just go down, and they'll corral you in certain areas,

03:53.400 --> 03:57.760
and now you can eat a sandwich, you haven't had one in four hours, and you're just sort

03:57.760 --> 04:00.880
of like, yeah, I'm so hungry, and then someone's like, that's for press, and you're like, I

04:00.880 --> 04:07.840
don't care, I have an Emmy, but you just sort of become this baby, because I think that

04:07.840 --> 04:14.800
is all of our fantasies, right, like about that idea of getting an award, it really,

04:14.800 --> 04:22.240
I think what we all think, I mean, I'll use my I statements anytime you want, but I want

04:22.240 --> 04:28.760
to connect with you guys, and I just feel like that's the thing that you want to achieve,

04:28.760 --> 04:34.080
is that one brief weightless moment of like, so I'm okay no matter what I do, which is

04:34.080 --> 04:43.600
such an ironic feeling to have to win an award to feel, it makes no sense, it doesn't, because

04:43.600 --> 04:47.360
you're supposed to feel that when you wake up, and then you're absolutely...

04:47.360 --> 04:51.440
Which of the two Emmys that you have on your mantle now, weighs the most?

04:51.440 --> 04:54.320
They're both six pounds, Jeff, and I didn't look it up, and I don't care.

04:54.320 --> 04:55.320
No.

04:55.320 --> 04:56.320
I mean...

04:56.320 --> 05:03.280
I did not look into whether or not the shelf would be able to hold another one.

05:03.280 --> 05:08.200
I don't plan for this shit, I have no ambitions.

05:08.200 --> 05:11.360
Do you feel like you might have to get a new mantle, because if you keep winning all these

05:11.360 --> 05:15.000
Emmys, you have to like, you have to up your mantle game?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.480
I'm all done, buddy.

05:16.480 --> 05:27.640
This one was a huge, like, I absolutely did not expect, I fully, like, I was like, deserve

05:27.640 --> 05:34.280
sure, expect no, no.

05:34.280 --> 05:37.400
It's a very relatable stance.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.400
But I would also...

05:38.400 --> 05:39.400
Did I deserve it?

05:39.400 --> 05:41.160
You better fucking believe I deserve it.

05:41.160 --> 05:45.880
And everybody always, everybody nominated deserves it, because that all represents all of this

05:45.880 --> 05:46.880
work.

05:46.880 --> 05:47.880
I was like, that's what I'm saying.

05:47.880 --> 05:48.880
Who did you beat?

05:48.880 --> 05:50.520
Who are you up against on this one?

05:50.520 --> 05:53.240
Like, Family Guy and shit, or who?

05:53.240 --> 06:00.720
Yeah, South Park, and The Simpsons, and The Muppets, I don't remember.

06:00.720 --> 06:04.680
Look, I can't believe you gotchered me.

06:04.680 --> 06:07.120
I don't know who else was nominated.

06:07.120 --> 06:08.120
I didn't care.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.120
Can we...

06:09.120 --> 06:15.120
I didn't fucking care, because I knew I was...

06:15.120 --> 06:16.280
Because you deserved it.

06:16.280 --> 06:19.400
Because I knew I wasn't going to talk if I won, so I don't need to know their edge of

06:19.400 --> 06:20.400
life.

06:20.400 --> 06:24.280
Wait, so did Rylan get up and talk?

06:24.280 --> 06:26.200
Yeah, we met, like, who's going to talk?

06:26.200 --> 06:28.880
They tell you, you've got to pick a person to talk.

06:28.880 --> 06:32.560
So then, like, Justin and I were like the whole time, we're like, who's going to talk?

06:32.560 --> 06:33.560
You should talk.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.560
No, you should talk.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.560
You should talk.

06:35.560 --> 06:42.400
And they're like, let Jessica talk, that would be badass, you know, but it's like, who's

06:42.400 --> 06:43.400
going up?

06:43.400 --> 06:46.560
And that was the more important thing, it was like, who's going up?

06:46.560 --> 06:51.160
Because it's like, they put this fear of God in you, like, you've got to get up here,

06:51.160 --> 06:53.440
30 seconds for your speech and stuff.

06:53.440 --> 06:57.720
And then you're sitting there through the show, and you're like, there's like 20 people

06:57.720 --> 06:59.480
out here.

06:59.480 --> 07:03.680
If they all get up and go up there, it turns out the answer is yes, it's all fine, like

07:03.680 --> 07:05.320
Path of Least Resistance.

07:05.320 --> 07:09.440
For a production thing, it's like, yeah, everybody get up there, it's an award for everybody.

07:09.440 --> 07:14.680
But we were just like, I'm just like sweating and going like, what do you do, what are you

07:14.680 --> 07:15.680
doing?

07:15.680 --> 07:21.080
Wow, who's, Justin said, I think it should just be me and you, and then so and so and

07:21.080 --> 07:22.080
so and so.

07:22.080 --> 07:27.160
And I was like, okay, Justin, but, and the whole show's going, I just want to clarify,

07:27.160 --> 07:34.200
are you saying that if, and there's like, Cody between us, like it's not just me and

07:34.200 --> 07:35.200
his ear.

07:35.200 --> 07:41.760
What are you saying, and the winner for best some other human being that you're doing this

07:41.760 --> 07:50.080
during is, are you saying, if they call our name and obviously the big asterisk hears we're

07:50.080 --> 07:55.440
not expecting to win, so we shouldn't be having this conversation, let alone behind probably

07:55.440 --> 08:02.160
the other nominees, I'm pretty sure Trey and Matt are sitting in front of us, I don't know.

08:02.160 --> 08:12.560
But if we do win air quotes, are you saying that when we stand up, if anyone else stands

08:12.560 --> 08:19.760
up, should we look at them and go, and just, no, no, I'm not saying, and the winner for

08:19.760 --> 08:24.440
the second award that's human beings that you'll never know, okay, well, I don't want,

08:24.440 --> 08:29.360
I just, I don't know, talking about, we don't know, no one knows, there's no leadership,

08:29.360 --> 08:37.160
we don't know, we don't know who goes up, and I was like, and then I think Mike McMahon

08:37.160 --> 08:42.800
is like, who had the right answer, he's like, it's everyone in the catalog, it's everyone

08:42.800 --> 08:49.040
that's listed, it's like, in the program it'll say, so those are the people that go up, it's

08:49.040 --> 08:51.040
like 11 people for Rick and Morty.

08:51.040 --> 08:52.640
And they all get their own individual trophy.

08:52.640 --> 08:56.680
Yes, those are the people that get statues, they go up, because they have like credit

08:56.680 --> 09:01.480
of some whatever kind on the episode, so all those people, we get herded like cattle into

09:01.480 --> 09:03.720
this back room and stuff.

09:03.720 --> 09:08.560
And then you fill out the thing, I talked about this, right, like the weird thing is

09:08.560 --> 09:14.800
that you go into this back room, and everyone is just like, it's so, you're looking at people

09:14.800 --> 09:23.400
who are, I was like, these are the only people for whom it's not an honor to be nominated,

09:23.400 --> 09:28.360
they have to be the people that just sit there, and they just continually all day, for two

09:28.360 --> 09:33.080
days for the Creative Arts Emmys, they're like, just non-stop chain of people.

09:33.080 --> 09:40.320
For them, it is like a slaughterhouse, but they're like, congratulations, like they have

09:40.320 --> 09:45.560
this look on their face, like a Disneyland employee, like you get fired if someone says

09:45.560 --> 09:49.200
you didn't smile, you know, like I imagine that the pressure is on them, or that they

09:49.200 --> 09:54.040
come to the table with like, they actually wanted to be near that, because they have

09:54.040 --> 09:59.440
to, they're just like, oh my god, congratulations, and you're like, yeah, but we, it's just

09:59.440 --> 10:05.520
like this is like chain of people, it's just this assembly line, and you get handed a statue

10:05.520 --> 10:11.400
from a box, and it has nothing on it, my statue still has nothing on it, because you fill

10:11.400 --> 10:16.080
out a form that goes to a place that makes the plates, and then the plate gets mailed

10:16.080 --> 10:17.160
to you.

10:17.160 --> 10:19.280
So, and the form...

10:19.280 --> 10:21.760
You got it like super glue it back on to the thing, right?

10:21.760 --> 10:25.320
It has little screws on the back, I'm so glad we're getting to the, I mean, I feel like

10:25.320 --> 10:30.240
if there's one thing my podcast can do for people, is prepare you for your Emmy.

10:30.240 --> 10:31.240
Yeah.

10:31.240 --> 10:33.080
We're here to make you...

10:33.080 --> 10:36.840
It has like a little band on it, that you could, but the curious thing about it is that

10:36.840 --> 10:42.200
the form says, what's your name, what's your address, what's the name of your show, what

10:42.200 --> 10:46.320
category did you win, it's not like multiple choice, so I just keep thinking like, so if

10:46.320 --> 10:47.320
I just write like...

10:47.320 --> 10:48.320
Oh, yeah.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.320
That would be so badass.

10:49.320 --> 10:56.320
Like, you could just write Rick and Morty Parentheses' Biggest Dick.

10:56.320 --> 10:57.320
Yeah.

10:57.320 --> 11:02.720
You write, Hitler did nothing wrong, like that's what 4chan would do, like it's just like,

11:02.720 --> 11:07.440
it just feels like, you know, you look and you go like, this is hackable, because I'm

11:07.440 --> 11:11.680
standing next to Justin, and Justin's right, I'm like, what's the name, because the categories

11:11.680 --> 11:12.920
aren't easy to remember.

11:12.920 --> 11:23.680
I was like, outstanding evidence of goodness by a thing on TV that was a cartoon, what did

11:23.680 --> 11:24.680
you put?

11:24.680 --> 11:29.760
It's like, best TV show that's a cartoon, and I'm like, well, that's not the same, I don't

11:29.760 --> 11:34.720
think either of them are right, is the idea that they just put these things in a wood

11:34.720 --> 11:39.120
chipper and then some like gnome goes, I know what these guys mean, they're high.

11:39.120 --> 11:45.680
If you wrote best TV show, that would pass muster, no, they don't make it.

11:45.680 --> 11:49.680
It's like the final chamber of like the Holy Grail, where you have to actually like pick

11:49.680 --> 11:53.680
it out, and you don't get one.

11:53.680 --> 11:58.600
Can we talk about the sandwiches?

11:58.600 --> 12:05.440
This is just, okay, so I'm an outsider, come insider in this whole Hollywood thing, but

12:05.440 --> 12:11.600
there's this thing you encounter as a person in Hollywood, which is all these sandwiches

12:11.600 --> 12:19.640
that you can't eat, it's crazy, we went to Comic-Con and they're like, hey, you're going

12:19.640 --> 12:23.960
to be in this room doing all these interviews, it's going to be great, it's like a big party,

12:23.960 --> 12:29.520
Mike Tyson's there, you got all these sandwiches, you can't eat any of these sandwiches.

12:29.520 --> 12:34.680
The sandwiches will just have this like, and it won't be like a big blinking sign, it's

12:34.680 --> 12:35.680
embarrassing.

12:35.680 --> 12:40.760
It's a sign just big enough for you to be halfway in your mouth, and then it says X-Files.

12:40.760 --> 12:48.280
It says ham and cheese, it says like tomato and chicken and not for you.

12:48.280 --> 12:54.920
These are Jillian Anderson sandwiches, it's so great because you can sit down, and you

12:54.920 --> 13:00.240
can take sandwiches, and those are the two activities to do in those rooms, it's surprising

13:00.240 --> 13:05.680
that even in the Emmy back dungeons and stuff, it's still like you want a sandwich, or you

13:05.680 --> 13:08.840
want an Emmy, but don't get cocky, buddy, these are fucking-

13:08.840 --> 13:17.200
And I did say I was drunk and on vodka and victory, and I did say to my publicist who

13:17.200 --> 13:21.640
was politely saying, those are for press, and I said, here's a headline for you, Dan

13:21.640 --> 13:24.720
Harmon eats your fucking sandwich.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.720
They love that stuff.

13:26.720 --> 13:28.880
I run with it.

13:28.880 --> 13:33.760
To run with everything else, they fucking, that's a story I approve of.

13:33.760 --> 13:38.520
I was hungry, I'll tell you all this item, make it a feature, make it a puff piece, or

13:38.520 --> 13:42.240
a fucking like, oh, come at me, the sandwich eater.

13:42.240 --> 13:43.720
I drink your milkshake.

13:43.720 --> 13:44.720
Sorry.

13:44.720 --> 13:49.160
You come over there and drink the press' milkshake.

13:49.160 --> 13:54.160
Yeah, yeah, I eat your sea in which, yeah, I'm sure they would have been fine with it.

13:54.160 --> 13:58.080
Wait, so why were there segregated sandwiches?

13:58.080 --> 14:04.360
Because the thing is, why do it in the first place other than to humiliate people?

14:04.360 --> 14:07.240
That's not how food is served.

14:07.240 --> 14:09.560
That's how food is served.

14:09.560 --> 14:14.880
I think when you get to the point where food is on a tray, I think that is an important

14:14.880 --> 14:15.880
rule.

14:15.880 --> 14:21.360
I think we're getting to a Christ-like thing here where it's like, maybe ownership, we

14:21.360 --> 14:27.040
don't have to take aim at the concept of ownership in general, you're not allowed to, you should

14:27.040 --> 14:29.080
make a sandwich and then not care who eats it.

14:29.080 --> 14:33.000
I think that person's like, I just made this, it's three in the morning, I'm so hungry,

14:33.000 --> 14:36.720
it's halfway to my mouth, okay, don't test me.

14:36.720 --> 14:42.880
But once sandwiches are mass produced, yeah, going like, you know what, you can't say that

14:42.880 --> 14:43.880
they're someone's.

14:43.880 --> 14:47.480
Well, if you care that much, you don't protect it through norms.

14:47.480 --> 14:48.720
I'll tell you that.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.120
You gotta put it behind plexiglass.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.280
Yeah, you need design work.

14:52.280 --> 14:53.280
Yeah.

14:53.280 --> 14:55.520
You gotta put enough effort.

14:55.520 --> 14:59.360
When your sandwiches are important, pay a security guard to shoot people that eat your

14:59.360 --> 15:00.360
sandwiches.

15:00.360 --> 15:01.360
All right.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.520
Or just increase the size of the sign.

15:03.520 --> 15:04.520
Yeah.

15:04.520 --> 15:11.600
What was the thing that I was like, I was like, yeah, put money in, oh, I don't know, I can't

15:11.600 --> 15:16.360
get into that, that's too, I'm sorry, that got personal, okay, but I'm like, oh yeah,

15:16.360 --> 15:22.880
if you don't care, if you really care about this shit, then you would express it through

15:22.880 --> 15:27.400
risking things, so I'll let that person have it, I'll tell you that.

15:27.400 --> 15:29.400
Speaking of risking things, let's bring out Rob Schrab.

15:29.400 --> 15:52.160
Oh shit.

15:52.160 --> 15:57.800
I hope we talk about you winning an Emmy every week.

15:57.800 --> 16:03.600
I can't wait till next week when we hear, come on, this is another story about you winning

16:03.600 --> 16:05.120
an Emmy.

16:05.120 --> 16:12.960
Like that would be, oh man, people want to know about the statue, people want to know.

16:12.960 --> 16:13.960
No they do.

16:13.960 --> 16:14.960
This is like insider stuff.

16:14.960 --> 16:17.080
No, they do, Spencer.

16:17.080 --> 16:18.080
People want to know.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.080
People want to know.

16:19.080 --> 16:20.080
People want to know, Spencer.

16:20.080 --> 16:26.080
They want to know on a weekly basis, any new, I'm glad we could come on the show and agree.

16:26.080 --> 16:29.400
It's a goddamn Emmy night, it gets goddamn Emmy night.

16:29.400 --> 16:33.080
It's Emmy night every night here, apparently.

16:33.080 --> 16:34.080
What was last week?

16:34.080 --> 16:35.080
Well it was Emmy night two.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.080
They do them two weeks in a row, it's not my fault.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.080
It was Emmy night two.

16:37.080 --> 16:48.080
Oh, you can't fault me, cause the last episode was Emmy night two, and now it's Emmy night.

16:48.080 --> 16:51.080
Why aren't you talking about Bill Hader?

16:51.080 --> 16:53.080
I'm going to get around to that.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.080
I'm not cool.

16:54.080 --> 16:57.080
I'm going to get around to my fellow Emmy winners.

16:57.080 --> 16:59.080
What about Dinklage?

16:59.080 --> 17:00.080
Let's hear it for the Dink.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.080
He won tonight.

17:01.080 --> 17:02.080
Yeah, he did.

17:02.080 --> 17:09.240
All right, a lot of Dinklage haters in the crowd, a lot of silent Dinklage impression.

17:09.240 --> 17:14.480
People not ready to give it up for Dinklage, just out of hand, I was like, look, he can

17:14.480 --> 17:15.480
earn it.

17:15.480 --> 17:16.480
Right, exactly.

17:16.480 --> 17:17.480
I haven't watched the show.

17:17.480 --> 17:21.600
I'm certainly not going to fall into that bullshit.

17:21.600 --> 17:22.600
Haven't seen it.

17:22.600 --> 17:23.800
I'll take a look.

17:23.800 --> 17:26.320
Now that it won an Emmy, that's what I do.

17:26.320 --> 17:27.640
I did it with Nurse Jackie.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.480
I'm doing it with Game of Thrones.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.960
Well, let me know how you think he did.

17:31.960 --> 17:36.040
He's fucking Peter Dinklage, you horrible grinches.

17:36.040 --> 17:42.080
I thought that was the one guy I could say that would get you people, my fans.

17:42.080 --> 17:46.680
Aren't you basically emotional Dinklages?

17:46.680 --> 17:49.960
Isn't that a description of my audience?

17:49.960 --> 17:51.840
Episode title?

17:51.840 --> 17:53.560
Emotional Dinklages.

17:53.560 --> 17:57.160
I am excited for him.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.560
I don't know, but did he win one?

17:58.560 --> 17:59.960
I don't know if I did Dinklage.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.240
He won Best TV.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.800
Whoa.

18:03.800 --> 18:04.960
He's got a great one.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.960
Did you ever see it?

18:06.960 --> 18:10.280
Oh my God, it's like 80 inches.

18:10.280 --> 18:13.960
80 inches.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.960
Did I say that I wanted to thank you guys for showing up on...

18:16.960 --> 18:18.280
Oh, you spelled Dinklages.

18:18.280 --> 18:19.280
Emmy night?

18:19.280 --> 18:20.280
Yeah, on Emmy night.

18:20.280 --> 18:21.280
D-I-N.

18:21.280 --> 18:22.280
This is bad.

18:22.280 --> 18:25.920
Hey, Schrab, what's up with you?

18:25.920 --> 18:30.760
I was looking up stuff.

18:30.760 --> 18:31.760
What's up?

18:31.760 --> 18:33.280
Might as well fill this dead air.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.280
That's what I was trying to do.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.280
I was trying to provide cover.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.280
All right.

18:36.280 --> 18:37.280
Well, you searched the internet.

18:37.280 --> 18:38.280
Well, I was away, Schrab.

18:38.280 --> 18:39.280
Well, I was away.

18:39.280 --> 18:42.000
Did your chair get groovier?

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
You got a better chair.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.320
I'm working on a good group.

18:44.320 --> 18:46.320
Are you happy?

18:46.320 --> 18:48.200
When are we going to know that you're settled into your...

18:48.200 --> 18:49.640
I love it here.

18:49.640 --> 18:50.640
Yeah.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.520
I've been coming every week.

18:52.520 --> 18:55.920
But would you trade this chair in for one of those shitty stools?

18:55.920 --> 18:56.920
No.

18:56.920 --> 18:59.160
You're happy with this.

18:59.160 --> 19:00.160
I'm happy.

19:00.160 --> 19:05.240
I could use an ottoman.

19:05.240 --> 19:09.240
And a nice quilt to keep my knees warm.

19:09.240 --> 19:12.520
Oh, we can get you a quilt.

19:12.520 --> 19:14.760
Jeff is putting the piano thing.

19:14.760 --> 19:16.480
You do it like this.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.480
Like an ottoman.

19:18.480 --> 19:19.480
Yeah, I support it.

19:19.480 --> 19:20.480
You know what?

19:20.480 --> 19:22.920
I think you should have a fucking morphine IV.

19:22.920 --> 19:26.680
I think you should have an electronic bed.

19:26.680 --> 19:29.880
I think you should have like a...

19:29.880 --> 19:31.880
I have a few notes.

19:31.880 --> 19:37.080
He's holding seat music.

19:37.080 --> 19:42.440
I have a couple of notes that I'm going to bring to the next meeting that I have

19:42.440 --> 19:43.440
Oh, yeah.

19:43.440 --> 19:46.440
Well, I have a few notes, too.

19:46.440 --> 19:52.440
Read them at your leisure, Jack Rabke.

19:52.440 --> 19:53.440
Yeah.

19:53.440 --> 19:58.440
He just named a real guy.

19:58.440 --> 20:02.440
That was a guy we worked for 20 years ago at Monster House.

20:02.440 --> 20:03.440
He just...

20:03.440 --> 20:07.360
His name just came out of your brain because we're dying.

20:07.360 --> 20:12.880
We're just like, Ferris wheel, depression, Hitler.

20:12.880 --> 20:13.880
I want to wish...

20:13.880 --> 20:14.880
Say what you will.

20:14.880 --> 20:15.880
I'm happy.

20:15.880 --> 20:18.600
I want to wish a very happy birthday to Caleb.

20:18.600 --> 20:19.600
He's turning 21.

20:19.600 --> 20:25.800
He took a little solo pilgrimage from Portland, ran into him at the drawing room before I

20:25.800 --> 20:26.800
came here.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.800
Is he here tonight?

20:28.800 --> 20:32.400
If he's not, then he's a con artist.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.400
I heard him.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.080
It sounded like he was over there.

20:35.080 --> 20:36.080
He bought me a drink.

20:36.080 --> 20:40.600
Caleb, how's it going, man?

20:40.600 --> 20:45.060
You got good seats.

20:45.060 --> 20:46.840
Damn!

20:46.840 --> 20:51.560
Oh, it's on.

20:51.560 --> 20:52.560
It's on.

20:52.560 --> 20:53.560
What happened?

20:53.560 --> 20:54.560
I missed it.

20:54.560 --> 20:55.560
There's a fight.

20:55.560 --> 20:58.060
Jeff and Dan are fighting.

20:58.060 --> 21:02.480
Absolutely nothing happened.

21:02.480 --> 21:10.440
A fine young man expressed a sincere embrace of his favorite show.

21:10.440 --> 21:13.440
What is it?

21:13.440 --> 21:21.040
Everyone turned it into a thing because people are animals and I have no loyalty to them.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.040
The show has become watching me...

21:23.040 --> 21:26.680
Yeah, where's these fucking Emmy sandwiches, man?

21:26.680 --> 21:27.680
You should have brought some Emmy sandwiches.

21:27.680 --> 21:28.680
I hate them.

21:28.680 --> 21:29.680
I hate them.

21:29.680 --> 21:30.680
I'm gonna shit them out.

21:30.680 --> 21:33.680
I'm gonna shit them out other than the fucking Emmys.

21:33.680 --> 21:34.680
All right.

21:34.680 --> 21:40.080
I don't think Hullabaloo has been made about the fact that I fucking met and hung out with

21:40.080 --> 21:42.280
Ron Perlman on a fucking plane today.

21:42.280 --> 21:43.280
Well, yeah.

21:43.280 --> 21:44.280
Here we go.

21:44.280 --> 21:45.280
That guy has the softest hands.

21:45.280 --> 21:46.280
Oh, no.

21:46.280 --> 21:47.280
Do you want that getting out?

21:47.280 --> 21:48.280
Do you have a favor?

21:48.280 --> 21:49.280
Shake Ron Perlman's hand.

21:49.280 --> 21:50.280
Thank you, Ron.

21:50.280 --> 21:55.280
He's never worked a day in his life.

21:55.280 --> 21:59.720
How do you be a hellboy and have his fucking hands are made of just like...

21:59.720 --> 22:01.840
It's supposed to be famous for having hell hands, right?

22:01.840 --> 22:02.840
Like just have a hell glove or something.

22:02.840 --> 22:05.040
Well, he's got that one giant hand.

22:05.040 --> 22:06.040
All right.

22:06.040 --> 22:07.040
I don't know, man.

22:07.040 --> 22:08.040
Oh, my God.

22:08.040 --> 22:09.040
Ron.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.040
We talked about...

22:10.040 --> 22:11.040
Your hand.

22:11.040 --> 22:12.040
We talked about French film.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.040
He has soft hands.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.600
Like, we're gonna have dinner together.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.760
He's my new best friend, so go...

22:17.760 --> 22:19.280
You can fuck your Emmy.

22:19.280 --> 22:20.280
I'll take...

22:20.280 --> 22:24.840
I'll take Ron Perlman's delicious soft hands.

22:24.840 --> 22:29.640
Look, my winning of an Emmy was not a challenge to anybody here.

22:29.640 --> 22:33.000
I never thought for a second while I was winning it, oh, this proves that other people are

22:33.000 --> 22:34.520
pieces of shit.

22:34.520 --> 22:39.160
I'm too busy trying to rise above the fucking muck and mire, and I'm like, well, this means

22:39.160 --> 22:42.000
I can breathe for six weeks.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.160
So don't fucking get mad at me.

22:44.160 --> 22:47.320
Go ahead, get mad at me, you little pieces of shit.

22:47.320 --> 22:48.320
Sorry.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.840
Now, like, okay, true colors.

22:50.840 --> 22:53.400
I did think for a second you guys are pieces of shit.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.080
I was like, well, this proves you're pieces of shit.

22:55.080 --> 22:56.080
Do you think that's your last Emmy?

22:56.080 --> 22:57.080
Do you think that's the last one?

22:57.080 --> 23:02.680
I hope it is, because I want to, the way I want to go out is like both of those pointed

23:02.680 --> 23:06.960
wings like fucking carotid and jugular.

23:06.960 --> 23:08.960
That's a safe statement.

23:08.960 --> 23:09.960
What?

23:09.960 --> 23:10.960
Oh, Jesus.

23:10.960 --> 23:11.960
Wait, I'll tell you.

23:11.960 --> 23:16.360
Dianne Harmon controversially proposes suicide by Emmy.

23:16.360 --> 23:20.120
No, that's not what I was...

23:20.120 --> 23:23.240
That's so irresponsible because there's so many kids out there that are going to win

23:23.240 --> 23:26.320
an Emmy so they can kill themselves.

23:26.320 --> 23:31.800
I almost, like, if this is where I won't go, I almost want to say, yeah, America, kids,

23:31.800 --> 23:36.720
if you're thinking of ending your life, do it with an Emmy just because it would trick

23:36.720 --> 23:39.760
them into a rock soup thing where they're like, they would get to a point where they're

23:39.760 --> 23:44.600
like 45 and they're like, I don't need to do this.

23:44.600 --> 23:47.400
Schrab's doing something.

23:47.400 --> 23:54.880
The show has just become me, me showing up and, and, and...

23:54.880 --> 23:58.760
I'm not building anything.

23:58.760 --> 24:02.640
It's like it was set up.

24:02.640 --> 24:07.400
I'm trying so hard, I have a list of things to talk about.

24:07.400 --> 24:09.760
Start from the bottom.

24:09.760 --> 24:12.600
I can't, that's a thing I got crossed off.

24:12.600 --> 24:15.840
Mandy, everybody go see Mandy if you haven't.

24:15.840 --> 24:17.840
Love, man.

24:17.840 --> 24:19.920
That's a movie, the Nick Cage movie.

24:19.920 --> 24:20.920
Yeah.

24:20.920 --> 24:21.920
Yeah, it's great.

24:21.920 --> 24:25.680
So, or not because of iTunes, you can, it's, it's out, right?

24:25.680 --> 24:26.680
Yeah.

24:26.680 --> 24:27.680
You can just stream it.

24:27.680 --> 24:28.680
The soundtrack's great too.

24:28.680 --> 24:29.680
I just bought the soundtrack as well.

24:29.680 --> 24:32.680
A real, a real, a real tour de force.

24:32.680 --> 24:33.680
We're a fire burner.

24:33.680 --> 24:37.360
We're really, hopefully we'll start burning up the charts.

24:37.360 --> 24:38.360
Oh, I fucked up.

24:38.360 --> 24:39.360
Yeah, shake it.

24:39.360 --> 24:40.360
I fucked up.

24:40.360 --> 24:41.360
Undo typing.

24:41.360 --> 24:42.360
Undo.

24:42.360 --> 24:43.360
Shaking his phone.

24:43.360 --> 24:44.360
Well, that, as you said, undo.

24:44.360 --> 24:45.360
Like, I accidentally pasted...

24:45.360 --> 24:46.360
Spencer.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.360
Just shaking your phone, help?

24:48.360 --> 24:49.360
Yeah.

24:49.360 --> 24:50.360
For undo, it's, are you undo?

24:50.360 --> 24:51.360
What do you want from me?

24:51.360 --> 24:52.360
Not from me.

24:52.360 --> 24:53.360
God damn it.

24:53.360 --> 24:54.360
They should have a better gesture.

24:54.360 --> 24:55.360
All right.

24:55.360 --> 24:57.000
I'm moving up from the bottom of the list.

24:57.000 --> 25:01.200
Uber, I learned how to do multiple locations.

25:01.200 --> 25:05.720
So I will actually provide more Uber rides now because the truth is, if I've ever been

25:05.720 --> 25:11.560
with you and it's time to get an Uber, if I think that there's going to be some chicanery

25:11.560 --> 25:14.800
with like, oh, we're going to go here and then we're going to drop off someone, so I'll

25:14.800 --> 25:17.600
kind of fade in the background.

25:17.600 --> 25:19.400
But I'll throw my money at anything.

25:19.400 --> 25:22.360
I just don't want to have to talk to people because it seemed to me that you have to get

25:22.360 --> 25:27.560
in the car and then you have to go, oh, thank you for showing up under the auspices of our

25:27.560 --> 25:28.560
original destination.

25:28.560 --> 25:31.760
However, a few things to throw at you.

25:31.760 --> 25:33.520
Would you mind making a brief stop?

25:33.520 --> 25:39.000
And I don't want to have those conversations, but I found a, I didn't find it.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.960
It was shown to me by a friend.

25:40.960 --> 25:45.160
I can't believe this guy went on Emmy.

25:45.160 --> 25:47.000
There's an easy interface.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.640
There's a plus button when you think of it.

25:48.640 --> 25:50.400
You can just add locations.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.360
I picked up this fucking asshole.

25:52.360 --> 25:55.600
What did you think the plus button meant?

25:55.600 --> 26:00.400
I didn't make the destination louder.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.400
Ah, 32.

26:02.400 --> 26:04.400
I don't know.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.400
I mean, whatever.

26:06.400 --> 26:16.440
I'm going to play musical stings every time Schrab scores on you.

26:16.440 --> 26:17.440
Fine.

26:17.440 --> 26:19.960
You just got dunked on, man.

26:19.960 --> 26:20.960
I don't care.

26:20.960 --> 26:23.720
I'm not going to, here's something that won't get a musical score.

26:23.720 --> 26:28.600
I mean not letting it affect me, which is actually a huge, you're fucking like, like

26:28.600 --> 26:29.600
that's me winning.

26:29.600 --> 26:30.840
Like I don't care.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.320
It's me, therapy's working.

26:32.320 --> 26:33.320
I don't care.

26:33.320 --> 26:34.760
I don't fucking care.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.560
Like fucking hit me, dude.

26:36.560 --> 26:39.360
Like you don't, you can't control my feelings.

26:39.360 --> 26:44.400
You don't, you're, you're like, I can, I can fucking put you in an airlock and flush you

26:44.400 --> 26:47.760
into space like a fucking predator.

26:47.760 --> 26:57.720
That was my favorite ending of the predator when, when Danny Glover, that one I deserved.

26:57.720 --> 27:00.040
Danny Glover put the predator.

27:00.040 --> 27:05.560
I will acknowledge that burn I did in the airlock and sent the predator out into space.

27:05.560 --> 27:09.520
But that's how you can always trust me, you know, like, I'm like, oh yeah, I fucked up.

27:09.520 --> 27:10.760
And then you're like, I like Dan.

27:10.760 --> 27:11.760
He knows when he fucks up.

27:11.760 --> 27:14.960
So that means when I say he's not hurting me, he's not hurting me.

27:14.960 --> 27:20.680
I hear the new, the predator movie is getting mixed reviews.

27:20.680 --> 27:23.760
It did not do well this weekend.

27:23.760 --> 27:27.160
Gosh, I wish they would give that and Jay Moore one more shot.

27:27.160 --> 27:28.160
Yeah.

27:28.160 --> 27:33.400
I just, I, I, I, I don't, I don't think we've gotten the predator.

27:33.400 --> 27:34.400
Make him the predator.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.440
Let's just double down on that one.

27:36.440 --> 27:40.800
What about, maybe predator purge, like obviously these are two things that society's just

27:40.800 --> 27:45.880
like, you're flooding it, you're flooding the engine.

27:45.880 --> 27:49.120
It's the ninth purge movie, like, what do people like about it?

27:49.120 --> 27:51.480
I can't figure it out.

27:51.480 --> 27:56.600
It's the title and the promise that you made in the poster, which you obviously can't deliver

27:56.600 --> 27:59.880
on within the budget you're willing to spend.

27:59.880 --> 28:04.520
A proper purge movie would, for instance, be a television show, which it is.

28:04.520 --> 28:08.800
I think I read it in my old friend Anthony Hemingway, I think he's working on that purge

28:08.800 --> 28:10.320
show on Netflix.

28:10.320 --> 28:13.920
I make it an anthological TV show.

28:13.920 --> 28:17.120
People's interest in the purge concept is anthological.

28:17.120 --> 28:20.640
The movies try to be anthological, and then they ruin themselves with this thing.

28:20.640 --> 28:25.040
Like, it's like, oh, I'm supposed to care about, like, the ending of the purge franchise.

28:25.040 --> 28:29.880
No, you're supposed to, and the predator thing is just like, oh, what if there was a thing

28:29.880 --> 28:33.360
hunting us because we hunt things so much?

28:33.360 --> 28:34.360
It's not working.

28:34.360 --> 28:37.520
It's getting, we're getting under our own feet here.

28:37.520 --> 28:43.840
I see a predator poster, I'm 45 years old, I'm like, what, is this a reboot or a sequel?

28:43.840 --> 28:47.280
There was Predators, and then there was a guy from that 70s show, was a serial killer

28:47.280 --> 28:48.280
in it.

28:48.280 --> 28:55.760
And now the movie's just the predator, and it's just, this is year 18, like, don't

28:55.760 --> 28:56.760
Google it.

28:56.760 --> 29:02.880
That's what the slogan for the predator is, predator, don't Google it.

29:02.880 --> 29:10.960
The, from the creators of nothing before, trust us, so we came up with this new idea,

29:10.960 --> 29:15.880
what if you were getting hunted, you like, hey, you like eating a hot dog, what if you

29:15.880 --> 29:21.560
were the hot dog, don't look it up, we've never done it before, like, no one, no, like,

29:21.560 --> 29:26.280
if you're eight years old, you still know, just from that handshake between Carl Weathers

29:26.280 --> 29:31.600
and fucking Schwarzenegger, everyone knows that fucking bicep handshake.

29:31.600 --> 29:34.880
And if you haven't seen the movie, that's like, are you ready for your close-up, Mr.

29:34.880 --> 29:35.880
DeMille?

29:35.880 --> 29:39.520
Remember when that lady said that?

29:39.520 --> 29:40.520
And Sunset Boulevard?

29:40.520 --> 29:41.520
Yeah.

29:41.520 --> 29:42.520
Yeah.

29:42.520 --> 29:43.520
Are you ready for your close-up, Mr. DeMille?

29:43.520 --> 29:46.840
Fuck, here's my pitch, you fucking put a predator in Sunset Boulevard.

29:46.840 --> 29:53.880
Hey, hey, hey, the movie starts, a predator in the pool, and goes like, that's me, I tried

29:53.880 --> 29:55.480
to hunt an old starlet.

29:55.480 --> 29:57.920
But it's all, I'm dead.

29:57.920 --> 30:02.920
It's all a predator-language, it's all a predator-language, it's all a predator-language.

30:02.920 --> 30:03.920
Hollywood is so doggie-doggy.

30:03.920 --> 30:04.920
I just wanted some candy.

30:04.920 --> 30:08.760
Hollywood is so doggie-doggy that it killed the predator.

30:08.760 --> 30:09.760
He couldn't fucking eat it.

30:09.760 --> 30:10.760
Hey, stand up.

30:10.760 --> 30:16.640
I like it that the last three predator movies are expecting us to still be impressed with

30:16.640 --> 30:21.160
thermal dynamic, like, like, oh, wow, I can see the heat.

30:21.160 --> 30:37.560
They cut you off, man, I don't blame them.

30:37.560 --> 30:45.560
We got night vision on our, on our telephones, and we're supposed to go, oh, wow, look at

30:45.560 --> 30:53.560
this orange and yellow and blue splotchy vision, that, he could, he could see anything.

30:53.560 --> 30:58.040
Oh my God, wow, that's really impressive.

30:58.040 --> 31:05.000
But let me get in my drone and fly to the fucking Froyo.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
What the fuck are you talking about?

31:07.000 --> 31:12.000
Wow, oh my God, he could see if I'm hot or cold.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
He could do that.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
Amazing.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Oh my God.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Wow, the predator.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Get out of here, man.

31:18.000 --> 31:29.400
I hope I don't run into an a cumbersome nine-foot dreadlocked spaceman with a harpoon arm in

31:29.400 --> 31:34.720
this world where people can craigslist rape people by the dozens over email.

31:34.720 --> 31:38.160
I like, like, yeah, it's not, the predator is a, it's a real word.

31:38.160 --> 31:42.480
It means it happens like, yeah, it happens like 90 times a day.

31:42.480 --> 31:45.480
You're like, oh yeah, man.

31:45.480 --> 31:47.480
It's an awful world.

31:47.480 --> 31:53.400
It's like, wow, how many people that you could interview from last week, if you could round

31:53.400 --> 31:57.920
up souls that went out in a certain way, like, hey, would you trade the way you went out

31:57.920 --> 32:01.000
for just a run with the predator hunting you?

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
Fuck yeah.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
What the fuck happened to me?

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
I was walking out of a 7-Eleven.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
I got shot because my hat's wrong.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Here's the thing.

32:09.000 --> 32:14.600
It's like, they go, okay, so, the predator, no, no, get ready, though.

32:14.600 --> 32:15.600
Get ready.

32:15.600 --> 32:23.240
So the predator is like, oh, well, you know, he's invisible, and stop there.

32:23.240 --> 32:24.240
He's invisible.

32:24.240 --> 32:25.240
That's all he could do.

32:25.240 --> 32:26.240
It's a huge power.

32:26.240 --> 32:31.120
But he could see you in spotty orange and yellow spotches, and he's got a knife that

32:31.120 --> 32:32.120
goes really fast.

32:32.120 --> 32:33.120
What does he do?

32:33.120 --> 32:34.120
What does he do with the invisible?

32:34.120 --> 32:38.840
When he's not invisible, when predator is just being predator up on a tree, does he

32:38.840 --> 32:42.400
still see you as spotty orange and yellow on blues, or does he see you regular?

32:42.400 --> 32:43.400
He can switch.

32:43.400 --> 32:44.400
He switches.

32:44.400 --> 32:46.120
He can switch between things.

32:46.120 --> 32:49.320
They celebrate that in the movie, end of the video games, and it's like, oh, he can switch.

32:49.320 --> 32:51.520
He could choose to see heat.

32:51.520 --> 32:54.800
He could choose to see, like, fear, I don't know.

32:54.800 --> 32:59.160
But the important thing is, the guy is like, fear would make it make, would be another

32:59.160 --> 33:00.680
layer or something like that.

33:00.680 --> 33:05.720
He just like, thermal dynamics, no shit, my kid's got a toy that can do that.

33:05.720 --> 33:08.560
But give me something, give me, give me ideas, man.

33:08.560 --> 33:12.680
Here's the craziest thing to me, here's the thing that bumps me the most.

33:12.680 --> 33:17.000
I believe you and I saw Predator 2 in the theater, that's how old we are, and how long

33:17.000 --> 33:19.240
this friendship has been failing.

33:19.240 --> 33:27.080
Like, I don't know, let's give it one more decade, when we saw Predator 2, and I was

33:27.080 --> 33:33.960
like, so we were there when Danny Glover looked at him and said, fuck you, pussy face.

33:33.960 --> 33:37.400
And the crowd went, wow, I never thought about that.

33:37.400 --> 33:41.320
It looks like a pussy.

33:41.320 --> 33:45.840
And then, and then, and then, Danny Glover's at number two?

33:45.840 --> 33:48.400
Yeah, and he calls them pussy face?

33:48.400 --> 33:53.320
Yes, and the first Predator, of course we know that in the first Predator, why did you

33:53.320 --> 33:55.600
think the movie was about?

33:55.600 --> 33:59.160
I never saw, I never saw the second one.

33:59.160 --> 34:04.560
I thought at the end of Arnold Schwarzenegger, you are one ugly son of a bitch.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.240
Yeah, that's what happens in the first movie.

34:06.240 --> 34:09.120
So then they made a second one, and then they doubled down on it, and he called them pussy

34:09.120 --> 34:10.120
face.

34:10.120 --> 34:11.120
Pussy face.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.120
Pussy face.

34:12.120 --> 34:13.120
So, so that's the thing is they keep.

34:13.120 --> 34:17.320
Number, Predator 2 is the reason why we have aliens versus Predator, because they go,

34:17.320 --> 34:21.720
Danny Glover goes on the spaceship, and we see, they threw like a, he goes on the spaceship,

34:21.720 --> 34:26.920
and there's more Predators, and they combine this moment of like, like, Danny Glover goes

34:26.920 --> 34:33.960
like, I fucking, I got you, I beat you, and then multiple Predators come out of the fog.

34:33.960 --> 34:35.360
He's on the mothership.

34:35.360 --> 34:41.920
You think, it's just like, oh, I tracked this rich douchebag back to his Lexus, right, like,

34:41.920 --> 34:50.800
but then, no, you tracked this rich douchebag back to his, his dealership, no, no, you're

34:50.800 --> 34:55.480
just connecting dot, you're just trying to be, it doesn't make any sense.

34:55.480 --> 34:59.560
If you were immersed in what I'm saying, you wouldn't be trying to take shots at me by

34:59.560 --> 35:01.280
changing Lexus to Tesla.

35:01.280 --> 35:02.280
That's lateral.

35:02.280 --> 35:04.800
It would be Winnebago would be the answer.

35:04.800 --> 35:09.880
You reactive fuck, you're just trying to affect me, you're just, oh, there's the moon, can

35:09.880 --> 35:10.880
I hit it with a slingshot?

35:10.880 --> 35:15.440
Yes, you can, you can hit anything, you're a human being, now what are you going to do

35:15.440 --> 35:16.440
with that power?

35:16.440 --> 35:21.920
How does it, what, I can't hear you, it's not about you, the show's not about you, that's

35:21.920 --> 35:27.720
why there's no microphone in front of you, there's no, there's nothing, it's not about

35:27.720 --> 35:34.600
the show, can't be about you, it's barely about me, and it's my name, I can't even control

35:34.600 --> 35:43.360
it and I'm up here, these are my friends, look what's happening to me up here, did you

35:43.360 --> 35:51.360
perceive me as not challenged enough, did you want to throw me out of my comfort zone,

35:51.360 --> 35:59.360
oh, he's not having a hard enough time, he doesn't know what to do up there, or he's

35:59.360 --> 36:16.720
too on rails, this is too scripted, I want to see what happened, the lights are changing,

36:16.720 --> 36:22.200
the colors are changing.

36:22.200 --> 36:29.080
All right, so, so, Danny Gleber, tracks again, he thought he tracked the rich juice bag back

36:29.080 --> 36:40.720
to his Lexus, he like impales him, I got him, turns out it's a Winnebago, because the dot

36:40.720 --> 36:44.680
you should have fucking connected is that there's more predators, but you didn't see

36:44.680 --> 36:55.680
predator too, because you're 18, and that's not a strength, CNN makes you feel like that

36:55.680 --> 37:02.480
makes you powerful, all it means is that you're going to die later than me, big deal, just

37:02.480 --> 37:06.400
means you're going to get an iceberg and melt it in your head, when the Emmys don't

37:06.400 --> 37:12.320
give you a sandwich, this is how it all, I'm glad I'm going to die before you, good luck

37:12.320 --> 37:20.720
with your molten planet, good luck trying to figure out how to eat rotten corn, I'm

37:20.720 --> 37:27.920
happy, because you were mean to me, enjoy your hydroponic rotten corn, are you ashamed

37:27.920 --> 37:34.200
of having a Tesla, this is what it sounds like, he said Tesla, and Elon Musk has turned

37:34.200 --> 37:40.440
out to be a fucking, don't finish that sentence, I love him, he's my best friend, he's a great

37:40.440 --> 37:48.840
guy, fuck you, can I finish the goddamn, the podcast should be called, can Dan Harmon

37:48.840 --> 38:01.080
get through a fucking thought, Caleb, 21 years old, this poor guy has officially, because

38:01.080 --> 38:06.080
he said, listen to all the episodes, he's 21, that means he spent 5% of his life listening

38:06.080 --> 38:12.760
to this shit, he had to get through 300 plus episodes of this, he's wasted an actual measurable

38:12.760 --> 38:17.440
percentage of his young life listening to us, Caleb, you don't have to verify this, I don't

38:17.440 --> 38:22.520
want you to get drawn into this, but I think the irony is, and I know you're thinking it

38:22.520 --> 38:27.840
too, this show started as me going, hey, don't let me go off on a tangent, oh, it's so funny

38:27.840 --> 38:31.720
because, oh, Dan Harmon's stream of consciousness, does it for it to evolve to the point where

38:31.720 --> 38:37.960
I'm just like, can I fucking talk for a second without everyone attacking me? It's ironic,

38:37.960 --> 38:38.960
I know you agree.

38:38.960 --> 38:50.040
I think the show does suffer from you not getting a platform, so anyways, he thought

38:50.040 --> 38:57.200
he chased him back to the Lexus, he fucking called it pussyface, he chases him back to

38:57.200 --> 39:03.920
the fucking predator ship, he kills the predator, and then he goes, I killed you pussyface,

39:03.920 --> 39:14.920
and then he looks around and through the fog, seven predators, and you're like, oh, shit,

39:14.920 --> 39:22.640
he's so fucked, he just spent the whole movie dealing with one predator, and the first movie

39:22.640 --> 39:28.280
was one predator, the only thing we changed, we didn't go straight multiple predators at

39:28.280 --> 39:33.800
the top of the second movie, like James Cameron style, it was like, predator changed the location

39:33.800 --> 39:41.560
to near future Los Angeles, so then he's like, I got you, I killed you, and then, wah, wah,

39:41.560 --> 39:46.040
multiple predators, and you're like, fuck, god damn it, we're really fucked, and then

39:46.040 --> 39:51.120
the lead predator walks up to him, and goes, how do you tell which one's the lead predator?

39:51.120 --> 39:56.000
He's in front, he's got choreography as you can tell, like blocking, the director told

39:56.000 --> 40:03.920
him you should talk to your actor, Mr. Glover, Bob Fosse, he's good, yeah, and it basically,

40:03.920 --> 40:18.680
it goes like, Jeff's dancing, they like appraise him, they go, huh, looks like this prey came

40:18.680 --> 40:28.600
on board our ship that we use to be predators, to predate, and it looks like he's gotten

40:28.600 --> 40:37.160
the better of one of our predator colleagues, and they react, of course, because this is

40:37.160 --> 40:43.120
what all of us would do, if you were dolphin hunting, that's what hunters do, you really

40:43.120 --> 40:47.200
hunt because you have so much respect for a deer, that if a deer killed your best friend,

40:47.200 --> 40:51.720
you'd be like, you're gonna come to my wedding.

40:51.720 --> 40:56.520
That's what that means when you see antlers on a wall, it means like, I got him, and like,

40:56.520 --> 41:01.480
if I hadn't gotten him, I would have fucking honored him for the rest of his life, no,

41:01.480 --> 41:06.840
I got him, he's weak, he's on my wall, that's how I, like, but the predators are like, oh,

41:06.840 --> 41:11.520
you killed a predator, he's fucking bodies on the floor of our car, you're a human,

41:11.520 --> 41:18.360
we come here to hunt, by the way, what the fuck are those guys doing that whole weekend?

41:18.360 --> 41:24.320
Is one of them in San Francisco, like, do they split up, like, I'm gonna be in Seattle?

41:24.320 --> 41:29.360
These are all great questions that would have been a really interesting third predator movie.

41:29.360 --> 41:35.880
But instead, in case I'm being obtuse about this, but I think you can predict, like, there's

41:35.880 --> 41:40.280
a mislead of, oh, I'm fucked, and then they like, what do they do, they give them a predator

41:40.280 --> 41:41.280
weapon.

41:41.280 --> 41:45.640
Yeah, they give them, like, an antique, like, American weapon, or whatever, from the Civil

41:45.640 --> 41:46.640
War.

41:46.640 --> 41:50.720
Oh, that's even worse, that's so much worse, saying like, they've been doing this for a

41:50.720 --> 41:51.720
long time.

41:51.720 --> 41:55.600
It's like, you know, the last time we got our asses kicked is when the fucking Confederate

41:55.600 --> 41:57.600
Slag had the balls.

41:57.600 --> 42:00.400
I didn't read it, that is what you're reading, when I preside.

42:00.400 --> 42:03.120
Well, I didn't read it until you said that, because I was like, holy shit.

42:03.120 --> 42:07.400
No, no, no, I'm not reading like him, him like going, hey, we fought a good fight, here's

42:07.400 --> 42:09.000
something for your trouble.

42:09.000 --> 42:13.520
I thought he was like going, yeah, Eric was a dick.

42:13.520 --> 42:21.080
Well, what's the difference between those two, isn't that the same thing?

42:21.080 --> 42:26.800
You're like saying, like, oh, it's an honorable thing, like, you know, even though we're enemies,

42:26.800 --> 42:32.880
I can respect you, here's something for your trouble, thank you for your, it's a sport.

42:32.880 --> 42:35.520
You wouldn't extend to someone if Eric wasn't a dick.

42:35.520 --> 42:38.480
I mean, they clearly hate the fucking predator, I mean, that much is clear, yeah.

42:38.480 --> 42:39.480
And we're both right.

42:39.480 --> 42:45.280
Yeah, but the bottom line is they don't fucking kill them, they're just like, you know what,

42:45.280 --> 42:46.880
we're fucking cool like that.

42:46.880 --> 42:54.840
We come here, we hunt you, we turn invisible, we come here in a spaceship, we hunt you invisibly.

42:54.840 --> 43:00.640
We hang out in the spaceship invisible, that's how much we like being invisible, it's like,

43:00.640 --> 43:10.320
hey, it's your shit, it's your shit, it's your fucking shit, and they're like, they're

43:10.320 --> 43:16.160
like brawl, and they're like just making eggs and watching TV, Danny Glover walks in

43:16.160 --> 43:26.200
and they're like, why are they invisible and they're shit, why, I've never, it's been

43:26.200 --> 43:28.280
25 years, I've never asked that.

43:28.280 --> 43:30.600
Are you seeing this?

43:30.600 --> 43:32.800
I'm not seeing you, who's saying that?

43:32.800 --> 43:38.200
I mean, the explanation that might be that they're in the predator man cave and they're

43:38.200 --> 43:43.040
watching, also I don't want to now give it through a modern lens because predators are

43:43.040 --> 43:47.200
anything if not androgynous, you know, like we don't even know some of these predators,

43:47.200 --> 43:52.920
we shouldn't keep calling them he, but they're solely defined by their love of hunting, like

43:52.920 --> 43:54.960
we don't know if they're sexual or not.

43:54.960 --> 43:59.520
But they're in a, in a, in a, in a person cave and they're watching security cameras

43:59.520 --> 44:03.840
and they say, this is fucking guy, can you believe it, they go, Tony, I told you to close

44:03.840 --> 44:08.840
the fucking predator door on the ship that we parked in this mining tunnel outside of

44:08.840 --> 44:10.840
Los Angeles in 1997.

44:10.840 --> 44:12.320
Well, you don't pick up your shoes.

44:12.320 --> 44:16.320
Yeah, I was like, you told me, you said, is it Cliff's coming back, he's going to hunt

44:16.320 --> 44:22.960
a cast of nine, including Maria Conchino Alonso and Bill Paxton, and then we're going to

44:22.960 --> 44:26.120
fucking take off and you said, because he's a douchebag, I don't want to fucking like

44:26.120 --> 44:27.720
wake up and get the door for him.

44:27.720 --> 44:32.080
I'm like, yeah, but okay, now there's a fucking dude, there's an LA cop in our ship.

44:32.080 --> 44:33.720
He's looking at our trophy room.

44:33.720 --> 44:36.720
All right, well, let's go fucking, and then they turn invisible.

44:36.720 --> 44:41.400
They're like, let's go check it out and they're like, and they all go and then he's like finishing

44:41.400 --> 44:44.080
killing Eric and they're like, this dude's killing Eric.

44:44.080 --> 44:45.080
Yeah.

44:45.080 --> 44:52.320
I was like, all right, let's fucking bring it on and they're like, look, don't speak

44:52.320 --> 44:56.960
English, certainly not going to self-destruct.

44:56.960 --> 44:59.240
Basically we're pussies.

44:59.240 --> 45:03.040
Predators are fucking, they're terrible.

45:03.040 --> 45:14.720
This idea that they're badass is not, they're bullies, and then when they die, they blow

45:14.720 --> 45:19.280
themselves up and then this idea that we were going to get off on watching them fight aliens

45:19.280 --> 45:25.800
was like, I thought was absurd.

45:25.800 --> 45:26.800
You like aliens.

45:26.800 --> 45:29.920
Yeah, I like aliens, but I mean, I don't like aliens.

45:29.920 --> 45:34.320
I like Sigourney Weaver, I like humans, I like humans.

45:34.320 --> 45:35.320
That's why I like aliens.

45:35.320 --> 45:38.480
Yeah, but you like aliens, I mean, movies are the aliens.

45:38.480 --> 45:42.240
Yeah, well, that's the expensive part of the movie you're making, but it's about people.

45:42.240 --> 45:46.800
It's like saying if I read the old man in the sea that I like water, you can't just make

45:46.800 --> 45:51.840
a book about water, I was like, oh, and it sloshed and it slipped and then it was hard

45:51.840 --> 45:54.800
to drink and it gave you diarrhea and I'm like, yeah, get on with it.

45:54.800 --> 45:55.800
Where's the people?

45:55.800 --> 46:01.360
This is about the unknown, like you can't just be like Freddie versus Jason, I don't care.

46:01.360 --> 46:06.280
Oh, Jason had a nightmare, are you fucking kidding me?

46:06.280 --> 46:13.240
Next to LACC, where you guys shot Community, there's a bra, like lingerie shop called Jeanette's

46:13.240 --> 46:18.560
Bras and it's Jeanette, what's her last name in church?

46:18.560 --> 46:29.040
She's Vasquez from Aliens, she's the cool Latino, like hardcore Marine and now she sells

46:29.040 --> 46:32.800
panties and bras and she's fucking awesome.

46:32.800 --> 46:35.960
That's how I'm going out.

46:35.960 --> 46:41.480
Bill Paxton in Predator 2 and Aliens 2.

46:41.480 --> 46:42.480
Right?

46:42.480 --> 46:48.240
It's actually just called Aliens, it's not called Aliens 2.

46:48.240 --> 46:54.640
First one was called Alien, not Aliens 1, second one was called Aliens, not Aliens 2.

46:54.640 --> 47:00.880
So you didn't know what I meant, that's why you're so confused, you didn't know what I

47:00.880 --> 47:01.880
meant.

47:01.880 --> 47:06.720
Fucking Schrabbed, I Schrabbed you.

47:06.720 --> 47:08.480
You fucking put a mirror up.

47:08.480 --> 47:10.440
You've been doing that for 20 years.

47:10.440 --> 47:13.400
I guess you didn't know what I meant.

47:13.400 --> 47:15.760
If you knew how to correct me, then you knew what I meant.

47:15.760 --> 47:16.760
So why correct me?

47:16.760 --> 47:20.840
Because it's a society, trying to stitch it together.

47:20.840 --> 47:23.400
It's just you and me, man.

47:23.400 --> 47:28.960
What circumstances do the predators uncloke in the movie?

47:28.960 --> 47:33.440
Because what if they cloak as clothes, that's just clothes to them, is cloaking because

47:33.440 --> 47:35.600
they can see the color.

47:35.600 --> 47:39.960
I always project into it that it probably is harder for them to see while they're cloaked

47:39.960 --> 47:41.880
because otherwise why would they ever unclove?

47:41.880 --> 47:42.880
You know what it's also harder?

47:42.880 --> 47:44.560
Because clothes, they'll be flashing people.

47:44.560 --> 47:47.200
You know what it's also hard for a predator to do?

47:47.200 --> 47:50.880
Pick up little tiny things with their long, claw-y fingers.

47:50.880 --> 47:57.520
Remember the first one where he's trying to repair his leg, and they do a close-up of

47:57.520 --> 48:04.880
him picking up stuff, and he does that kind of mom picking up a pencil, and he's like,

48:04.880 --> 48:08.520
oh shit, and it looks like you.

48:08.520 --> 48:13.040
It's very hard to see somebody if they get mud on them.

48:13.040 --> 48:17.920
The source-maker gets a little mud on them, and we're supposed to buy that.

48:17.920 --> 48:21.400
You can turn yourself invisible, but yeah, you haven't defeated the mud.

48:21.400 --> 48:22.640
Yeah, they should change that.

48:22.640 --> 48:23.640
Mud technology.

48:23.640 --> 48:24.640
Then they'd be famous.

48:24.640 --> 48:25.640
Then they'd be famous.

48:25.640 --> 48:27.640
Then it'd be a franchise.

48:27.640 --> 48:33.200
Also, it's my understanding, you have to get to the copter or the skin-you-alliance.

48:33.200 --> 48:34.200
Right.

48:34.200 --> 48:35.200
Yeah.

48:35.200 --> 48:36.200
The chopper.

48:36.200 --> 48:39.640
If Jesse the body-venturer was a governor.

48:39.640 --> 48:40.640
Yeah.

48:40.640 --> 48:41.640
Yeah.

48:41.640 --> 48:42.640
All right.

48:42.640 --> 48:43.640
Yeah.

48:43.640 --> 48:44.640
Yeah.

48:44.640 --> 48:45.640
Yeah.

48:45.640 --> 48:46.640
He fucking won.

48:46.640 --> 48:47.640
Two governors.

48:47.640 --> 48:48.640
Two governors in one movie.

48:48.640 --> 48:51.960
That movie has more governors than any other action film of all time.

48:51.960 --> 48:52.960
Never thought about that.

48:52.960 --> 48:58.160
I can't believe you're sitting so close to that fucking asshole.

48:58.160 --> 48:59.480
You're probably friends with him.

48:59.480 --> 49:05.360
You guys probably came in a group on.

49:05.360 --> 49:13.480
Not since Jerry Brown and Dianne Feinstein were in The Expendables 4.

49:13.480 --> 49:14.480
Ladybugs.

49:14.480 --> 49:15.480
Right.

49:15.480 --> 49:16.480
Yeah.

49:16.480 --> 49:17.480
Yeah.

49:17.480 --> 49:18.480
I drive a Tesla.

49:18.480 --> 49:19.480
Yeah.

49:19.480 --> 49:20.480
Yeah.

49:20.480 --> 49:23.480
You're welcome from Earth.

49:23.480 --> 49:29.160
Do you drive it or do you just wreck it?

49:29.160 --> 49:30.640
I barely drive it.

49:30.640 --> 49:33.280
That's how fucking green I am.

49:33.280 --> 49:34.400
I barely drive it.

49:34.400 --> 49:38.120
I drive it back and forth to make an Emmy-winning show for you.

49:38.120 --> 49:39.760
It's completely.

49:39.760 --> 49:40.760
It's all I do.

49:40.760 --> 49:42.480
It's practically powered by the sun.

49:42.480 --> 49:43.480
It's powered by you.

49:43.480 --> 49:44.480
It's elliptical.

49:44.480 --> 49:45.480
Yeah.

49:45.480 --> 49:46.480
Yeah.

49:46.480 --> 49:47.480
That would be amazing.

49:47.480 --> 49:48.480
We gotta get that set up.

49:48.480 --> 49:51.360
As you do the elliptical in the morning it goes into like a big battery in your house

49:51.360 --> 49:54.680
and then the battery is shared by like I'm gonna make some eggs or like if you're rich

49:54.680 --> 49:55.680
you express it through energy.

49:55.680 --> 49:58.840
You go like hey guys it's Thanksgiving come to my house because I have so many people

49:58.840 --> 49:59.840
working for me.

49:59.840 --> 50:00.840
I'm always siphoning energy off of them.

50:00.840 --> 50:05.120
I've got a big like power wall in my house and then you like give the energy away.

50:05.120 --> 50:12.360
You go like here, here, desalinate some ocean water neighbor here like here's a birth control

50:12.360 --> 50:17.240
for you like everything like energy can be turned into anything and then like so rich

50:17.240 --> 50:21.960
people just have these head pieces and they like they have gemstones in them based on

50:21.960 --> 50:28.560
like how much you contribute to society.

50:28.560 --> 50:34.200
Everybody gets a little Thanos gauntlet at birth and then I like you know you know how

50:34.200 --> 50:35.200
it goes.

50:35.200 --> 50:36.560
Like I think we all know it then.

50:36.560 --> 50:39.480
You know how it goes.

50:39.480 --> 50:44.080
At the beginning of the universe you know and this tracks at the beginning of the universe

50:44.080 --> 50:48.160
like everything you know nothing is split into everything you know and then and then

50:48.160 --> 50:49.160
they were like these gems.

50:49.160 --> 51:03.640
You know the list is what you would imagine, power, time, soul, energy, what the fuck?

51:03.640 --> 51:05.840
I was like a third of the way through that list.

51:05.840 --> 51:07.600
They have power and energy.

51:07.600 --> 51:08.600
Yeah.

51:08.600 --> 51:09.600
Oh okay.

51:09.600 --> 51:10.600
And don't forget soul.

51:10.600 --> 51:11.600
What the fuck with these gems?

51:11.600 --> 51:12.600
Jesus Christ.

51:12.600 --> 51:13.600
So there's only four knuckles?

51:13.600 --> 51:14.600
What?

51:14.600 --> 51:15.600
I don't know.

51:15.600 --> 51:18.480
I was really disappointed in Thanos' gauntlet.

51:18.480 --> 51:20.520
I really wanted it to be more comprehensive.

51:20.520 --> 51:23.960
Like you don't have to make each thing part of someone's costume from a previous movie.

51:23.960 --> 51:28.280
I think you could just say, just say gem one, gem two.

51:28.280 --> 51:31.440
But show me that you're 20% more powerful when you get it.

51:31.440 --> 51:34.920
Like you could beat up the Hulk with the first gem.

51:34.920 --> 51:36.480
That just okay.

51:36.480 --> 51:41.440
To me that's what I was defining coming into the movie is like you pretty much you've peaked.

51:41.440 --> 51:44.480
You just you just you just put a put a hurt on the Hulk.

51:44.480 --> 51:50.480
Just beat his ass like he's a fucking like drunk at a bar like you just beat him up through

51:50.480 --> 51:51.480
him into space.

51:51.480 --> 51:56.200
And then he's like I gotta get the rest of those gems why so I can kill exactly half

51:56.200 --> 51:57.200
of the people.

51:57.200 --> 51:59.480
I don't even want to talk about it.

51:59.480 --> 52:00.480
Can't wait.

52:00.480 --> 52:01.480
I can't wait to see the sequel.

52:01.480 --> 52:04.840
You know it'd be a better movie if he's getting the gems but he's just he's just punching

52:04.840 --> 52:07.480
people to death as he goes.

52:07.480 --> 52:11.440
He's just like I'm gonna punch out half of the world.

52:11.440 --> 52:16.880
And they're like we got a study he's like punched out 60,000 people.

52:16.880 --> 52:23.040
He punches a lot for a guy who if he closes his fist can make your grandma into a newspaper.

52:23.040 --> 52:29.720
Like he's like he's doing a lot of fucking Tai Chi considering that I would I guess I'm

52:29.720 --> 52:30.920
a lazy supervillain.

52:30.920 --> 52:37.840
I would just be like so I can okay I got the green one from Dr. Strange.

52:37.840 --> 52:42.640
So now from now on then everything reverse all of it quick save and then redo.

52:42.640 --> 52:43.640
Yeah.

52:43.640 --> 52:49.840
Well that actually is Thanos' main weakness is that he always makes himself lose.

52:49.840 --> 52:54.800
So that's just another one of those things he does.

52:54.800 --> 52:56.000
That's his one weakness.

52:56.000 --> 53:02.080
He's unbeatable except that he makes himself lose.

53:02.080 --> 53:03.080
That's one of his things.

53:03.080 --> 53:04.480
Does it say that on his?

53:04.480 --> 53:05.480
It says it on his card.

53:05.480 --> 53:10.000
Yeah on his baseball card.

53:10.000 --> 53:13.920
I just don't yeah he on his planet he had an idea.

53:13.920 --> 53:16.160
Everyone was like god damn it there's not enough food.

53:16.160 --> 53:17.160
So many people.

53:17.160 --> 53:21.600
And he's like look I've been saying it forever.

53:21.600 --> 53:23.920
She killed half of the people.

53:23.920 --> 53:28.840
Okay Thanos we've heard you the first time like we're brainstorming here.

53:28.840 --> 53:34.800
And while technically that means no wrong answers fucking heard we heard you.

53:34.800 --> 53:37.560
And it's going on the shit list.

53:37.560 --> 53:38.560
We can beat it.

53:38.560 --> 53:39.560
I hope.

53:39.560 --> 53:44.200
Oh you know you're going to regret this one.

53:44.200 --> 53:48.080
What did you where did you go is a way we're having another board meeting where's Thanos.

53:48.080 --> 53:52.640
He laughed he went he joined the cosmos he said he's going to do that thing that he wanted

53:52.640 --> 53:54.240
to do here everywhere.

53:54.240 --> 53:57.240
Well great great.

53:57.240 --> 53:58.240
That really helps.

53:58.240 --> 54:02.280
He said he said you guys don't believe in him I never said I don't believe you could

54:02.280 --> 54:03.280
do that.

54:03.280 --> 54:07.120
He said it's a terrible idea.

54:07.120 --> 54:12.320
Why is he so offended by the idea what someone's saying that that's a bad idea that he's going

54:12.320 --> 54:14.000
to go make it happen.

54:14.000 --> 54:21.200
Put that much energy into making twice as much food how go to snap my fingers and everyone

54:21.200 --> 54:24.560
will have corn on the cob.

54:24.560 --> 54:26.880
It's an equally valid solution.

54:26.880 --> 54:27.880
You haven't seen it.

54:27.880 --> 54:33.200
It's I haven't either what a what a what a you know you know are we what are you talking

54:33.200 --> 54:34.200
about.

54:34.200 --> 54:40.200
It's it's it's Thanos it's this guy Thanos is a real B in my body wars his evil plan

54:40.200 --> 54:44.680
it's just it's hard to access for me.

54:44.680 --> 54:47.880
I'm going to watch I'm going to do this and then I'm going to watch the sunset on the

54:47.880 --> 54:48.880
universe.

54:48.880 --> 54:56.320
What do you do you know anything about the universe or sons or setting I'm getting nervous

54:56.320 --> 54:59.920
because you're saying this stuff and you're wielding this power and you just said you're

54:59.920 --> 55:02.840
going to watch the sunset on a grateful universe.

55:02.840 --> 55:07.120
I want you to understand but it could be the solution could be me explaining to you how

55:07.120 --> 55:09.960
many people are in the universe.

55:09.960 --> 55:14.480
I think you might think it's like Rhode Island and you're like you just wanted to sell more

55:14.480 --> 55:19.160
shoes and like we just it could this could be a matter of perception.

55:19.160 --> 55:25.320
So has anyone tried talking to this guy.

55:25.320 --> 55:27.320
Why are Ron Perman's hands so soft?

55:27.320 --> 55:28.800
This is my question.

55:28.800 --> 55:29.800
Yeah man.

55:29.800 --> 55:30.800
That's yeah.

55:30.800 --> 55:35.440
I think I don't think he wants people to know that I know but there were no one asked him

55:35.440 --> 55:42.680
about it on a man they were disturbingly like like just velvet there was disturbing being

55:42.680 --> 55:44.080
the operating word.

55:44.080 --> 55:45.080
Yeah it was weird.

55:45.080 --> 55:50.320
Hey I'm Ron Perlman I'm starring in a hillboy four coming up ask me anything.

55:50.320 --> 55:56.160
Jeff Davis on Harmontown says your hands are so soft you're a piece of shit.

55:56.160 --> 56:00.640
What the fuck I remember that guy what the fuck happened you seem nice at the time.

Hey this is Ron Perlman.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.440

56:14.440 --> 56:17.320
I didn't mean to talk any shit I was saying that your hand was.

56:17.320 --> 56:21.920

56:21.920 --> 56:30.000
Well okay well since since you got my number somehow why are your hands so soft.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.800

56:55.720 --> 57:01.440

What is my job if not to hear your troubles and help lift you up like let me help you.

57:06.280 --> 57:07.280
All right.

57:07.280 --> 57:16.360
All right let's go to the magic mirror and we have to recite the magic spell.

57:16.360 --> 57:17.360
Take my hand.

57:17.360 --> 57:20.400
Hello I'm the magic mirror.

57:20.400 --> 57:22.280
All right well okay.

57:22.280 --> 57:24.680
Take each other's hands and do the.

57:24.680 --> 57:26.240
Oh my hand again.

57:26.240 --> 57:30.800
So to be clear the mirror does not need to be started up.

57:30.800 --> 57:31.800
Well that's a scary thing.

57:31.800 --> 57:32.800
That's a scary thing.

57:32.800 --> 57:33.800
It's already on.

57:33.800 --> 57:40.080
I just realized I never turned it off.

57:40.080 --> 57:45.600
Stop mirror explaining fucking hold each other's hands and fucking do your job.

57:45.600 --> 57:46.600
All right.

57:46.600 --> 57:47.600
Okay.

57:47.600 --> 57:48.600
Sorry.

57:48.600 --> 57:49.600
I'm not going to just give you free mirror advice.

57:49.600 --> 57:50.600
Yeah.

57:50.600 --> 57:51.600
Okay all right.

57:51.600 --> 57:52.600
Well let's go.

57:52.600 --> 57:53.600
Okay.

57:53.600 --> 57:54.600
All right.

57:54.600 --> 57:55.600
I'm here.

57:55.600 --> 57:56.600
On the shelf.

57:56.600 --> 57:57.600
You fucking.

57:57.600 --> 57:58.600
You guys.

57:58.600 --> 57:59.600
You guys.

57:59.600 --> 58:00.600
You guys.

58:00.600 --> 58:03.160
Like look the pamphlet is right next to me.

58:03.160 --> 58:04.160
You can just read the fucking instructions.

58:04.160 --> 58:05.160
Okay go ahead.

58:05.160 --> 58:06.160
Just do the thing.

58:06.160 --> 58:07.160
Just read it out loud.

58:07.160 --> 58:08.160
Okay.

58:08.160 --> 58:09.160
You wanted to.

58:09.160 --> 58:10.160
All right.

58:10.160 --> 58:26.160
Okay.

58:26.160 --> 58:35.600
All right.

58:35.600 --> 58:39.600
of baptized children.

58:42.220 --> 58:47.220
Lymph nodes of virgin bright.

58:50.100 --> 58:54.600
Genitals of newt.

58:54.600 --> 58:59.600
Skin of trauma ward patients.

59:09.600 --> 59:14.600
These are the things we place

59:14.600 --> 59:19.600
in the cauldron now.

59:19.600 --> 59:23.600
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

59:23.600 --> 59:26.600
Okay, so mirror.

59:26.600 --> 59:29.600
Just full disclosure, I'm just fucking with you guys.

59:29.600 --> 59:31.600
You could just ask me any questions.

59:31.600 --> 59:40.600
But it's fun for a mirror to watch you guys do that.

59:40.600 --> 59:43.600
So what's your Ron Perlman question, Ron Perlman?

59:43.600 --> 59:50.600
Well, my question being Ron Perlman is I'm known as a badass.

59:50.600 --> 59:52.600
I'm known as Hellboy.

59:52.600 --> 59:55.600
I was in Blade 2.

59:55.600 --> 59:58.600
I'm usually a heavy, a gruff guy.

59:58.600 --> 59:59.600
City of Lost Children.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.600
Alien 4.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:03.600
Resurrection.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.600
Thank you, Gildy.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:10.600
I've been cursed with these really soft hands.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:12.600
Why is it a curse?

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:15.600
If I as an American ask a question back at you guys,

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:18.600
why do you even perceive soft hands as a curse?

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:20.600
Well, have you seen Reddit?

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:24.600
There's this person, Jeff Davis.

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.600
He's a fucking douchebag.

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:28.600
Whenever anyone shakes hands with Ron,

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.600
do you mind me speaking for you?

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.600
Whenever anyone shakes hands with him,

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.600
they're so taken aback by the gentleness

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.600
and then they want to go tell it on the mountain

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.600
and it's like it takes on this heat

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.600
that Ron's natural ruggedness doesn't take on

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.600
because that's the mainstay.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.600
So he exists as a creature of pure irony

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.600
and I don't think that's fair to Ron.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:50.600
It's like we skip the meat and potatoes

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:55.600
of him being basically a real-life Paul Bunyan.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:59.600
You're a really good girlfriend.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.600
Look, it's no secret that I'm Gannis Ron's manager.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:03.600
Are you married?

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:06.600
I'm Rhea Perlman.

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.600
You're Rhea Perlman?

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:11.600
She's my ex-girlfriend.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:12.600
Because I married her.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:14.600
Well, this got complicated.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.600
Gildy, Gildy Rhea.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.600
Sorry, you called me Gildy Rhea.

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.600
Gildy, Gildy Rhea.

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:23.600
It's fine, yes.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.600
Gildy Rhea.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.600
Forget the continuity.

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.600
Forget everything.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.600
I didn't realize that Ron was married to Rhea Perlman

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.600
from Cheers.

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:30.600
I didn't know that.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:31.600
Yeah.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.600
I call her Gildy.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.600
Okay, we're past that.

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:37.600
I'm his manager.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.600
Do you guys, like, do you guys...

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.600
Fuck, yeah.

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.600
Dude, do you want to watch?

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:44.600
That's why we got the mirror, right?

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.600
All right.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.600
Let's do it.

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:47.600
Okay.

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.600
Okay.

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:49.600
Here we go.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.600
There's a reason you're on the ceiling.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.600
Why don't you guys fuck in front of me so I can...

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:53.600
Can we put you...

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:58.600
You guys can watch yourselves fuck me.

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.600
You're my reflection.

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:04.600
Okay, well, we've got about 10 minutes before the Grubhub shows up,

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:05.600
so let's do that.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:06.600
Yeah.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:07.600
All right.

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:08.600
Here we go.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:09.600
All right.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.600
Should I initiate?

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:11.600
Yes.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:12.600
Okay.

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:20.600
Although asking that raises the question, who's initiating?

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.600
But yes, you should.

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.600
All right.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:24.600
I'm going to take off my robe.

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:25.600
Check out these.

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.600
Okay.

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.600
Those look great, as always.

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:29.600
Excuse me.

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:30.600
Sorry.

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:31.600
All right.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:32.600
Sorry.

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:35.600
Let's open the window and look out at the fucking tent city that exists

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.600
on the perimeter of our mansion.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:38.600
What?

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:39.600
Who said...

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:40.600
Hey.

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.600
Hey, guys.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.600
Oh, shit.

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:43.600
It's David Duchovny.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:44.600
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:49.600
You're delivering my green leaves?

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:54.600
I'm looking down into this puddle and I can see you through a mirror.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:55.600
It's esoteric.

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:56.600
Oh, my God.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:58.600
Well, that's not supposed to happen, is it?

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:01.600
Not unless time has reversed.

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:05.600
Mirror, did you reverse time and let David Duchovny see us through a puddle?

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.600
I reverse everything.

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:10.600
I guess so.

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:12.600
That's his thing.

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.600
That's what he does.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:15.600
Yeah.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:16.600
Start fucking, Rhea.

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.600
Well, hi, David.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:22.600
It's me, Gilda Rhea, Pearlman.

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:26.600
We have agreed to start having sex in front of the mirror.

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:27.600
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:28.600
Please.

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:31.600
I assume you can look away if you don't want to watch it.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:32.600
Don't record this.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:33.600
Yeah, no, don't acknowledge me.

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:37.600
I don't like that part.

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:42.600
I invited some other mirrors over, so now it's like the end of Enter the Dragon with Bruce Lee.

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.600
You guys are all fucking in the hall of mirrors.

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.600
Did a lot of mirrors just interrupt?

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:47.600
Yeah.

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.600
Did a lot of mirrors just enter?

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.600
Yeah, look around.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:52.600
That's bad.

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:53.600
See that guy?

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:54.600
Yeah.

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.600
That's you five times.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.600
All right, well, here we go.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.600
I'm initiating.

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.600
Or you want to initiate.

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:05.600
I asked you what you thought of these.

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:06.600
Oh, yeah, I think they're great.

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:07.600
What do you think of these?

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:08.600
Take a look at these.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:09.600
What do you think?

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:10.600
Nice.

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:11.600
All right.

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:12.600
Nice.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:13.600
Nice.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.600
What would you give one a kiss?

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.600
Okay.

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:22.600
All right, now let me give a part of you a kiss.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:23.600
Okay.

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:24.600
What you can pick the part.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:25.600
Yeah.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:26.600
In between these.

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:27.600
Okay.

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.600
Oh, these are interesting.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.600
All right.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.600
I'll give you a kiss.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:35.600
Yeah, you can kiss a little more.

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:36.600
All right.

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:40.600
Sounds like you're like a good boy than I am.

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:51.600
Do you want me to, oh, I'm going to move to a different part of you and change the behavior,

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:53.600
but keep it administered with my mouth.

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:54.600
Okay.

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:55.600
All right.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.600
What about here?

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:57.600
What do you think of this?

01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:58.600
That'll be okay.

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:01.600
I'll use some rapid fire kisses right here.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:02.600
Okay.

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:03.600
Whoa, wow.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.600
What do you think about that?

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.600
That's nice.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:08.600
Now, why don't you, you know, like, look, I just came.

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.600
Oh.

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:10.600
Okay.

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:11.600
All right.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.600
Okay.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:13.600
All right.

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:14.600
All right.

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:15.600
All right.

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:16.600
Okay.

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:17.600
All right.

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:18.600
Okay.

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:19.600
Wow, that was sexy.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:20.600
That was hot.

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:33.400
That happens in America, everywhere, once a day.

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.400
When you reverse time.

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:37.400
All right.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.400
So look, it's been great.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.400
Jesus Christ, 909.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.400
Wow.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:46.400
I usually, we could do, start at seven.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.400
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.400
No, we started at eight.

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:51.400
Yeah.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.400
That's what I'm saying.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.240
I'm telling you, there's no escape.

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:58.400
I woke up at like fucking 5 a.m. in St. Paul, Minnesota this morning.

01:05:58.400 --> 01:05:59.400
I'm so tired.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:04.400
Well, then let's, let's, let's get the human alarm clock, Steve Levy, up here.

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:05.400
Steve Levy.

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:06.400
You got it.

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:09.400
Steve Levy in the house.

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.400
All right.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:23.400
Steve Levy, you got, you got, you know, Rhea Perlman's married to Danny DeVito, right?

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:24.400
Yeah.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:25.400
I know that was my joke.

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:26.400
Not anymore.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.400
They're divorced.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:32.400
I said, nobody gets me and everyone railroads me and I'm a victim of everything.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:37.400
And I, you know, I have everything and I'm also a victim of everything.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:41.400
And it's not easy to balance those worlds.

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.400
I think you're killing it.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:44.400
Thank you.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.400
Thank you.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:47.400
I think you're doing fantastic.

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:48.400
What's going on?

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:54.400
Dan, how long do you think like realistically until you're in next scandal?

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:57.400
Don't answer that question.

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:58.400
I mean, does it matter?

01:06:58.400 --> 01:06:59.400
Who cares?

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:00.400
Why would you ask that question?

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:01.400
Come on.

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:03.400
Well, why not ask it?

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:04.400
Who cares?

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.400
Why, why does it matter?

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:07.400
It's 9-11.

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:13.400
See, it was only 10 seconds until your next scandal.

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:14.400
Exactly.

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.400
It's just 9-0-9.

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:17.400
Steve Levy's top five championships.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.400
What?

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:19.400
All these are chaps.

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:20.400
All these are chaps.

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.400
They added taps tonight.

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:22.400
Yeah.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:25.400
I think, well, I think it's a combination of things.

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:29.400
We moved into this theater space so we can't normally hear the people.

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:34.400
So, like, whereas Norm was, we used to have this thing at Meltdown where it's like, you

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.400
could hear everybody if they cleared their throat.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:40.400
And so it'd be like somebody, we'd go like, I'm going to talk about dolphins and then

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.400
somebody would be like, that's not true.

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:43.400
And it'd be like, hey, come up here.

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:47.400
And then it's like, and then we moved here and it's like a theater so it's not designed

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:48.400
for that.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:53.400
I don't know what's happening is like this Darwinian mutation of like, like super asses.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:56.400
Like, like, like, like, God damn it.

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:59.400
I've said shit under my breath like 90 times.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:04.400
It's like, if you don't take all your antibiotics, you create like a fucking flu monster.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:08.400
So now you just have three people going like, God damn it!

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:09.400
Go-Bots!

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:10.400
Go-Bots!

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:13.400
My name is Paul Davidson.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.400
I'm from Minnesota.

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:18.400
Talk about Go-Bots!

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:23.400
I'm happy to come up if you want!

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:27.400
I think it's exactly, I think it's just like Latter Day, Adam Goldberg, because I just

01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:29.400
want to just like barge the way on stage.

01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:31.400
But what's the alternative?

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:33.400
Hey, keep it down.

01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:35.400
There's a show going on up here.

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:36.400
I can't say that.

01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:38.400
I'm on their side.

01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:39.400
This is a fucking shit show.

01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:41.400
I'd heckle it too.

01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:45.400
If I was sitting out there, I'd be like, can I come up?

01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:46.400
It's garbage up here.

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:48.400
A bunch of jackasses.

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:49.400
I've got eyeballs up.

01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:51.400
There's three guys in a row that have the same beard.

01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:55.400
There's like a weird kind of three musketeers thing happening over here.

01:08:55.400 --> 01:09:00.400
That means you can only see three people because our whole audience has the same beard.

01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:02.400
It's these guys.

01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:04.400
We can't understand you!

01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:07.400
We can't understand you!

01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:12.400
You have to take workshops to speak to other people.

01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:14.400
It takes things.

01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:15.400
It takes architecture.

01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:17.400
It takes training.

01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:20.400
You have to project.

01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:23.400
I can't understand you!

01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:25.400
You don't know timing either.

01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:28.400
No one will ever understand what you're saying.

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:30.400
I don't even think understanding is the problem.

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:36.400
I think if we understood him, then there'd just be a whole host of new problems.

01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:39.400
I know that.

01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:42.400
I know that for sure.

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:48.400
But the fact that there's a membrane there where it's just like, I can't even...

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:52.400
No one can even tell what you're saying.

01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.400
Shouldn't that stop you?

01:09:54.400 --> 01:10:00.400
An animal wants to eat more grass over there.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:07.400
And then there's barbed wire that goes into their forehead and they're like...

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:13.400
It doesn't mean the farmer's trying to keep you from being a super cow.

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:16.400
This farm might love you.

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:21.400
It just wants you to be you and make the most milk possible.

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:26.400
Isn't that the superest cow of all?

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:34.400
My dad used to heckle at church.

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.400
So, what's an example?

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:38.400
That's no good.

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.400
He came to Harmontown a couple of times and I would hear him yell out and stuff.

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:44.400
And I'd be like, this is the fucking, this is just church round two.

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.400
It's so bad.

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.400
What would he say in church?

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.400
Do you remember anything like, here we go.

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:51.400
What is a heckling?

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:52.400
Like eight days.

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:55.400
Yeah, exactly like that.

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:59.400
I'd take more of a rest if I mean that world.

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:03.400
Yeah, it's all just like, he'd be all like, oh yeah, Mark would say.

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:05.400
And then he'd be like, you mean Matt?

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:07.400
You know, like just stupid.

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.400
Like literally heckling church.

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:11.400
What would the pastor do when he goes...

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.400
Nothing.

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:13.400
Moving on.

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:14.400
No.

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.400
It never broke any rhythms.

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:18.400
There was never enough speed.

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:21.400
That's what she spake.

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:24.400
Thus so she spake.

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:29.400
When I was 25, if I was a pastor and I had a guy like your dad in the audience,

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:32.400
I would, or congregation would have been called the audience.

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:35.400
That would be my technique.

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.400
I'd be like, hey, come on, get up here.

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:39.400
Come on, what are you doing?

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:41.400
What were you saying?

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.400
And that would take care of me.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.400
That's what you do here.

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:48.400
Yeah, but it's not punitive here.

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:53.400
I've always said from the beginning as Caleb will remind us

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.400
because he's had to listen to every episode.

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:58.400
Like I from the beginning have always been like, I don't want to do that here.

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.400
I don't want to have that relationship with the audience.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:03.400
I want to have like a Paula Poundstone relationship with the audience where it's like

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:07.400
she had her showtime show and she would like, she would just have guests

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:10.400
and she was like a regular person and like they were regular people

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:13.400
and like I would always be like, hey, does anybody want to come up here

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.400
and talk to us and we won't hurt you.

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:16.400
We won't bully you.

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:17.400
It's a safe place.

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:22.400
And that was coinciding with like a kind of like cultural shift in things and stuff.

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.400
And I've always meant that.

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.400
I always just wanted to have that relationship with the audience.

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:27.400
You piece of shit.

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:28.400
You fucker.

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:29.400
I'm kidding.

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:30.400
I'm kidding.

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:31.400
I'm kidding.

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:35.400
I keep making eye contact with you about the Lexus thing and I don't care.

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:36.400
I don't really care.

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:39.400
So and the thing I don't, when I say I don't care,

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:42.400
I mean you're not allowed to come up to me ever and go,

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.400
I was that guy, now let's talk about that.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.400
Don't do that.

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:49.400
This did not make us friends, but I don't hate you.

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:50.400
Who is the guy?

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:51.400
It doesn't matter.

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.400
It doesn't matter.

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:53.400
It's the important thing.

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.400
It's all been a bit.

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:55.400
Is it your instinct?

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.400
Yes, sure.

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:59.400
That was the one thing like always when I was coming up.

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.400
I was blaming the guys behind you, but it was you.

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:02.400
Who cares?

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.400
What are you going to do?

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.400
We don't want to.

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:06.400
This is not information.

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.400
We want to know.

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:08.400
This doesn't.

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:09.400
We don't want to.

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:10.400
Why do we care?

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:11.400
Yeah.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:12.400
What are we doing?

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:13.400
Bring someone up.

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:14.400
No.

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:15.400
No.

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.400
Let's bring up Caleb for his 21st birthday.

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:27.400
Yeah.

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:31.400
Say a guy, I couch out some, some, some, some naïve said,

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:32.400
bring someone up.

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:36.400
And that, that person, you know, who was that?

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:37.400
We keep.

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:43.400
I can't stay mad at you assholes.

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:48.400
Or maybe I can't, I can start to get mad.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:49.400
Like C-A-L-E-B.

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:50.400
That's the one.

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:51.400
Yeah.

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:52.400
How's it going?

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:53.400
21 years old.

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:54.400
This is your 21st birthday.

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:55.400
Not today, but just yeah.

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:56.400
A couple of weeks ago.

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.400
Oh, okay.

01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.400
Security.

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:05.400
Trying to make, trying to, trying to, like they're so.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:06.400
This is my fault.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.400
That's how desperate for entertainment they are.

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:09.400
It's not your fault.

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:11.400
They're like, David Goliath.

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:14.400
I was like, no, nothing's happened.

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.400
Yeah.

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:19.400
But like you said, you took a, it's a solo trip you treated

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:20.400
yourself to for your birthday.

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:21.400
Yeah.

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:23.400
I was broke as fuck for the last year or so.

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:26.400
And then I recently, I worked all summer and I just turned 21

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:27.400
at the end of August.

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.400
And so I decided now that I'm not broke as fuck,

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:33.400
I'm going to make myself broke as fuck by going to LA.

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:36.400
And now don't, don't think that you have to lie to us

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.400
because actually we'd feel better if the answer is no.

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.400
But did you come out here just for this show?

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:43.400
That was like 90% of the reason I came out.

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:44.400
Yeah.

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.400
Yeah.

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:46.400
Absolutely.

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:50.400
So we feel a little bad, but, but I mean,

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.400
that's, that's probably, that's the highest honor that we,

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.400
you know, people make these pilgrimages.

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.400
And especially like, I don't know,

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.400
there's something about doing it alone too.

01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:00.400
Like, I don't know, the people that do it with a,

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.400
with a, with a, with a partner that makes it,

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.400
it's just something, there's something like holy about that.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.400
Like you really are like, just like,

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:08.400
I have a relationship with this show.

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:11.400
I'm getting in my car. I'm driving out here.

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:14.400
What can we learn more about you?

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.400
What do you want to know?

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.400
Are we, I don't know if you work for the government.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:18.400
Are we going to get fired?

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:20.400
I actually was just working for the government.

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.400
No, I'm fine. I'm unemployed right now.

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:26.400
What was this thing you were doing that ended with you being broke as fuck?

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:28.400
I was working a really, really shitty job.

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:31.400
And I, that's when I started listening to this because I knew,

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:33.400
I loved Rick and Morty and community.

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:35.400
And so I was just, hey,

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:37.400
I need to listen to something while I'm working these 12 hour shifts.

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:39.400
I want to listen to this guy who can relate to me.

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:41.400
This guy who,

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:43.400
but what was the,

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:46.400
whatever you're comfortable telling us about the job,

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.400
that what you were doing.

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:51.400
I signed a contract saying I wouldn't say much about it.

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:55.400
Basically, I was just a machinist and it was a really shitty thing.

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:58.400
But I, I was incredibly unhappy.

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:01.400
God, the imagination runs wild.

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.400
Like what are you, it just means,

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:05.400
it means you were making a nuclear bomb.

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.400
It's all that could ever be.

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.400
Caleb, was it like aerospace or?

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.400
No, nobody gives a fuck about me.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.400
I like to think he's building the first whole truck.

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:14.400
Well, don't violate and care.

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:15.400
Steve's here.

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:16.400
No.

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:17.400
Hey Steve, how you doing?

01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.400
Rob, you know, don't.

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:21.400
You came up on stage like what?

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.400
45 minutes ago?

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.400
Just sat here.

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:26.400
Oh my God, that's right.

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:28.400
You came up on stage.

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.400
I can't, thank God, Rob's here.

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:34.400
Or we wouldn't get to the bottom of the fact that the show's not scripted.

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:36.400
And that mistakes are made.

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:40.400
I followed the flow and I thought I wound up somewhere hot.

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:43.400
But here you are with your fucking ice breath.

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:45.400
Cool it down.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:51.400
Let's all stop and notice how it's not as hot as we thought as he was making it.

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.400
I'm fucking heating shit up over here.

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:56.400
You come in with that shit, that Mentos shit.

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:58.400
Who cares about him?

01:16:58.400 --> 01:16:59.400
I pay him.

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:02.400
Caleb came out here, he paid us.

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:05.400
Cool it, brother.

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.400
Now, no pressure.

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.400
Please tell us about...

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:11.400
No, I was just working as a machinist.

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:18.400
I was basically building circuit boards for different like, whether it was Google or other entities that I'm not allowed to talk about.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.400
Probably not, yeah.

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.400
Not after, you know, they bought.

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:24.400
And probably not Bing.

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.400
I mean, they're probably not...

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:29.400
I was working at the Bing campus.

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:33.400
If you don't know where it is, Google it.

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:42.400
But I was just working that really shitty job and I became like...

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:44.400
That was literally the only reason...

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:47.400
This show is the only reason that I made it through their...

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:54.400
Not to sound like melodramatic or to exaggerate, but this is literally the only reason I made it out of there alive.

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:57.400
Like, genuinely. No, I'm not trying to sound stupid.

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:59.400
I take that for what it's worth.

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:10.400
I have a relationship with so many podcasts and I take that exactly, I think, as much of a compliment and as little as I need.

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:12.400
It took me a while to get to that zone.

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:18.400
Like, you want to deflect it or you want to accept it, but it doesn't necessarily denote, like, merit.

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:20.400
It's gratitude, you know?

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:28.400
I feel gratitude when people say, oh, I was going through this or that and then your show was there.

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:31.400
And I grabbed it and I held on to it and it kept me from drowning.

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:37.400
And you go like, oh, man, that's so fucking amazing that I get to make that contact with you.

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:43.400
It has nothing to do, because me at 35, I'd be like, yeah, well, you know, it's basically just a rip off of mash.

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:50.400
Like, I start talking and I'm like, well, I don't know. A person is basically telling you, for instance, not what you're telling.

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:55.400
They're like, oh, yeah, they're sort of dog whistling that maybe they were going to commit suicide.

01:18:55.400 --> 01:19:01.400
You're like, this is not a time for you to be talking someone out of something.

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:09.400
You get caught up in whether what you do makes you a good person or a bad person.

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:13.400
And so this isn't about me.

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:19.400
But I can't believe, yeah, you just listened to all 300 and something episodes.

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:25.400
I asked Nova this, he came up last week or two weeks ago and we talked about it.

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:30.400
And they came up, god damn it, god fucking damn it, Harmon, get your shit together.

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:39.400
Nova came up a couple of weeks ago and we interrogated them and just give us a little bit of what do you want out of the podcast,

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:43.400
what do you get out of it so that we can keep customer satisfaction going.

01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:48.400
Now that I know I can't really talk about what I feel, tell me what I should talk about.

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:51.400
Hot dog prices, what the fuck?

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:55.400
No, honestly, it's just...

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:58.400
These hot dog prices, though.

01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:00.400
They're just outrageous.

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:02.400
Hot dog.

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:08.400
So I get out, I really admire your honesty, everybody on stage.

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:17.400
And as somebody who is extremely lonely in this dead end job, I ended up quitting that because I needed to.

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:18.400
That's why I was broke as fuck.

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:28.400
And anyway, I get out of it a lot of camaraderie and a lot of, while it is interesting hearing about your day-to-day life as a day-to-day life.

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.400
God fuck, I'm so stupid.

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.400
Sorry, it's fine, it's me, you're me, you're me.

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:33.400
It's fine.

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:38.400
Your day-to-day lives as these huge celebrities, these Emmy winners.

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.400
Sorry, Rob.

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:46.400
Oh!

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:49.400
And he looks like the Oscar.

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:51.400
Oh!

01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:53.400
He does look the most like the Oscar out of anybody.

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:56.400
And the Emmy for looking like an Oscar goes too.

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.400
It's family, it's camaraderie.

01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:10.400
It would kill you.

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:12.400
I feel that way about podcasts.

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:16.400
We have October 1st, David Cummings is out here coming out here from the No Sleep podcast.

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:26.400
I don't even know how to feel about that because for the last three months, Cody and I just pressed play on this guy.

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:37.400
You just hear this guy and this whole coterie of people who do this No Sleep podcast and that's what podcast is.

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:40.400
It's about addiction to a family unit.

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.400
Yeah, absolutely.

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:46.400
It's kind of all the way across the fucking continent.

01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:54.400
You can just form a genuine relationship with this person that you've never met, heard of or anything like that just because of things that don't matter.

01:21:54.400 --> 01:22:00.400
And it's a proper, safe, healthy one because it's through a sheet of plexiglass.

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:03.400
Because you can get hurt otherwise.

01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:12.400
It's like visiting humanity through a prison.

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:18.400
You get the phone and then you can go like, the lawyer comes and they make the gesture and you can go,

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:26.400
you can get as intimate as you want them and go like, are you doing in there big sister? Put your hand on the glass and like, yeah.

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:30.400
It seems appropriate to me.

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:34.400
To me, I like that.

01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:35.400
Mind if I have a drink?

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:38.400
Yeah, please, God, where are my manners? I'm so sorry.

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:39.400
I'm very sorry about that.

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:41.400
Sorry, Caleb.

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:48.400
So only because we make new friends up here.

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:50.400
God damn it.

01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:54.400
This is shit. A horrible person. They put a pox on your family.

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:59.400
I don't put a pox on your family. That's a joke.

01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:00.400
I don't have that power.

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.400
Which guy with which beard is doing this?

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:03.400
God damn it.

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:04.400
No, what is that going to help?

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:07.400
Spencer and I both agree that what you're doing there is wrong.

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:12.400
I'm like, what? Just tell me what your purpose is.

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:14.400
I just want eyeballs on who's doing the thing.

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:17.400
And then once that happens, then what?

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:19.400
I'm going to hurt their feelings.

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:22.400
Well, just hurt their feelings in general.

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:24.400
Who's the last one?

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:29.400
All right, shut the fuck up.

01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:32.400
It's a good thing we looked right at him.

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:36.400
We're being loud up here for no reason already.

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.400
But also, especially when there's another person up here,

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:40.400
because they don't have the...

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:43.400
It's like there's a building on fire and they're like,

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:44.400
holy shit, it's hot.

01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:46.400
You don't know how it affects them.

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:47.400
You don't know what it's like.

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:49.400
It just sounds like screaming, me, me, me.

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:50.400
Like, I want to be on stage.

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:51.400
Well, that's what heckling is.

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:53.400
Well, I'm not going to...

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:56.400
Without impugning you guys, I just want to say,

01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:58.400
I just use my eye statements and say,

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:02.400
all of that sound first hits you if you're a decent person.

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:05.400
It first hits you as shame.

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:08.400
Because if somebody's like,

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:10.400
the first thing I hear is like,

01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:12.400
you're fucking up, you're fucking up.

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:14.400
That's the first thing I hear.

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:18.400
I have to reprocess it through a series of palaces.

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:20.400
If you're going to shout something out from the audience,

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:23.400
it has to be fucking cogent or delightful.

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:27.400
The catch-22 is if you're going to shout something out from the audience,

01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:31.400
you have to be the kind of person who doesn't shout something out from the audience.

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:34.400
Which is really important,

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:37.400
because, yeah, that's like...

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:41.400
So if we're digging deep into a topic that we're like, oh my god...

01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:43.400
If the thing is that you're fucking up and I don't enjoy the show,

01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:45.400
then fucking go away.

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:46.400
Just walk out and go.

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:47.400
Well, now we sound defensive.

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:48.400
They are enjoying it.

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:50.400
No one wants to watch a bunch of defensive people on stage.

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:54.400
No, I'm on the offense right now.

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.400
That's what defensive people are.

01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:59.400
I will start actively hurting people's feelings.

01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:03.400
Anyways, Caleb, so what's it like to get a hard-on constantly?

01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:04.400
Oh, it's the best.

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:05.400
Oh, yeah.

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:06.400
It's the best, isn't it?

01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:07.400
It's a double-edged sword, for sure.

01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:11.400
Actually, but that's the one...

01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:14.400
That's the one thing that youth think.

01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:17.400
It's not about me.

01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:20.400
I want to ask you youth questions.

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:22.400
21, 21, 21.

01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:23.400
Just turn 21.

01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:25.400
I'm going to take the way back machine.

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:27.400
I want to ask you a 21 question.

01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:28.400
Knees.

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:29.400
What?

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:30.400
Knees.

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:31.400
You got knees?

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:32.400
How are your knees?

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:37.400
What's it like to have knees that you feel like you could just jump over anything?

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.400
Well, they just exist, right?

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:42.400
Is there anything that you would look at and you'd be like,

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:45.400
I could jump over that if I wanted?

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:48.400
Like barely that cord running on the ground.

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:49.400
He's humble.

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:50.400
I'm a Harmon fan.

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:58.400
I'm not an athlete.

01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:02.400
I think there might be a line of... You might be pointing out a thing.

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:06.400
I think we might be doing some kind of reverse discrimination thing,

01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:09.400
because I'm looking at you for the listeners that aren't subscribers,

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:11.400
that can't see Caleb.

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:13.400
He's got an Ashton Kutcher,

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:16.400
dude wears my car kind of body.

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:19.400
He looks like he could fucking pull you out of a burning car

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:22.400
and your baby and throw you under the...

01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:24.400
I pull babies out of cars all the time.

01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:28.400
And so maybe we're kind of like ganging up, but you could have that body,

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:31.400
especially at 21 and be like, yeah, I like checkers.

01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:34.400
And we're like, yeah, but where's your dick?

01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:35.400
Show us your dick.

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:39.400
How much do you like to fuck with your hard dick and jump over shit?

01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:41.400
And that's not fair.

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:43.400
That's like a weird thing.

01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:45.400
Oh, I actually, I got a question.

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:50.400
How much do you like to fuck stuff with your hard dick and jump over shit?

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:53.400
Spencer, were you listening to anything I just said?

01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:56.400
No, you're just living vicariously through me.

01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:58.400
See, now I'm on the heckler side.

01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:00.400
I'm going to go sit out there with you.

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:01.400
Well, guys, I...

01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.400
See, this is my, that's what I suspected.

01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:07.400
Caleb, what's your fantasy job?

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:11.400
Not job, like, I don't know, like kind of like like Desert Island.

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:15.400
250 of us were on a jet.

01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:17.400
Crashed.

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:19.400
There's luminaries like me at the front.

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:20.400
Yeah, of course.

01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:27.400
So obviously we're, I'm going to have like a begrudgingly administrative position.

01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.400
We thrust upon you.

01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:33.400
It's just going to be like people are going to look to me like even people that weren't familiar with me before

01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:35.400
they're going to be as they are on an airplane.

01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:36.400
It's words going to have spread.

01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:39.400
There's a guy in the fire, Rick and Morty, community.

01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:41.400
I don't know what that is.

01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:44.400
Like, well, yeah, well, that's not going to impress anybody once the wing flies off this fucking plane.

01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:46.400
This guy has two non-televised Emmys.

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:47.400
Yeah.

01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:50.400
So the first one was very televised.

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:51.400
Very televised.

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:55.400
I never bring it up, but my first Emmy was for writing the Oscars.

01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:56.400
Thank you very much.

01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:01.400
All right, so we crash on the island and people are like, I'm just taking myself off the plate

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:03.400
because I don't want you to say, hey, are you on the plane?

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:06.400
Because if so, I want to give you your space.

01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:07.400
I want to leave.

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:12.400
I want to allow you the space to claim things that maybe you think I would do.

01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.400
Do what I want and do what I think would do.

01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:17.400
I would do well.

01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:18.400
It's like a village.

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.400
We're never getting rescued, ever.

01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:24.400
So all that's going to happen is it's 200 people.

01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:25.400
We're starting a village.

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:28.400
Are you self-proclaimed fancy pants guy?

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:30.400
No, it's because he's a figure of import.

01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:32.400
I'm taking myself off the table.

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:39.400
I didn't want him to say, well, Dan, I don't want to say that I would like to do is write amazing things

01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:41.400
that make everyone happy every night.

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:45.400
I don't want him to assume that that's what I'd be doing.

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.400
I'd be so busy managing everyone.

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:49.400
I'd be like, everyone, calm down.

01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:50.400
It's OK.

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:51.400
I'm sure we'll get rescued.

01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:54.400
Because you're a man of the people.

01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:58.400
Yeah, and I have a radio to sabotage because I don't want to get rescued.

01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:00.400
I have 200 people liking me.

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:03.400
My plate is full.

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:05.400
I'm describing my fantasy.

01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:08.400
I'm not going to want to write a lot.

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:11.400
Please, let's find out.

01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:14.400
Caleb, you're in a tribal situation.

01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.400
It's never going to end.

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:21.400
Day by day, you're waking up in the most tribal sense.

01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:24.400
If your archetype was what?

01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:29.400
You can express that in any language you want, whether it's an actual job that exists

01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:33.400
or just be like, I would like to be the guy that blah, blah, blah, whatever.

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:35.400
Go from there.

01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:44.400
Well, in that fantasy land, I would probably want to be some kind of mentor or teacher to this tribe.

01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:50.400
I think education, whether it's like talking about math, science, all that shit, that's bullshit.

01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:55.400
Education should be, in my opinion, mostly about morality.

01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:58.400
And I don't think a lot of teachers or a lot of people realize that,

01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:00.400
especially not enough to put it into play.

01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:05.400
Well, so kind of a priest you're describing then, because you're saying, you want to be a mentor.

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:07.400
Well, don't lie to me, I'm not gotching him.

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:14.400
You're saying, fuck science and math, but hallelujah to guiding and teaching.

01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:17.400
Not that those things aren't important, because they are.

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:25.400
But really, I think a lot of the reason that the US is in a state of shambles right now, in case you haven't noticed.

01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:29.400
I've never heard you talk about it for several long time.

01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:33.400
I kind of unplugged.

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:36.400
Is America still in shambles? I haven't checked in.

01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:45.400
I would like to be the guy that wrangles the monkeys.

01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:50.400
Because they're going to get into our stuff.

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:54.400
And somebody's just got to be on top of that.

01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:57.400
I want to be that. Spencer's going to be...

01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:59.400
I want to build stuff.

01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:04.400
Spencer's going to build, like, a school for the monkeys.

01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:06.400
And I'll, right?

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:08.400
Yeah.

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:13.400
And in this school, you'll teach them how to build more schools.

01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:15.400
Monkey schools.

01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:18.400
I'm going to coach a monkey improv troupe.

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:20.400
Okay.

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:22.400
All right, this is really work.

01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:24.400
Steve! Oh my God, Steve's here!

01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:25.400
Steve Levy!

01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:27.400
The human alarm clock!

01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:29.400
The human alarm clock.

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:32.400
What do you want to do on the island?

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:34.400
I just want to interject there.

01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:37.400
Steve's not allowed to choose that.

01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:43.400
If we're on the same plane, he still has to work for me.

01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:45.400
Okay, Steve, if you want to answer the question...

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:48.400
So, I guess then I would continue being a human alarm clock.

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:50.400
So, in the morning, I wake up and go like,

01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:52.400
cock-a-doodle-doo or something.

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:55.400
I don't know how you want to phrase it.

01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:58.400
Okay, all right, take me out of the picture.

01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:01.400
It's a different island from me.

01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:03.400
He's directionless.

01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:07.400
I either want to be probably like a chef,

01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:10.400
learn how to cook with all the things I have,

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:12.400
which is probably very little.

01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:13.400
Wow!

01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:15.400
Curious, just curious.

01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:18.400
It's amazing that you're crashing an island in here.

01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:21.400
Or a real, I mean, sanitation is going to happen.

01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:22.400
Right?

01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:24.400
Isn't that a big problem?

01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:28.400
He's got a good point.

01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:32.400
You guys don't know Steve has a passion for sanitation.

01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:35.400
This guy fucking loves this shit.

01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:38.400
I just, you know, try to help society waste water.

01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:40.400
You're an anarchist dream,

01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:43.400
because anarchists philosophically need to assert the idea

01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:47.400
philosophically that if we were in a tribal situation,

01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:49.400
there would be someone that would be more than willing

01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:53.400
to handle getting the shit away from the food, you know?

01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:55.400
And that it would all work out.

01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:57.400
Yeah, the dream is that during the day,

01:32:57.400 --> 01:33:00.400
I'm preparing all the food.

01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:01.400
And at night, I'm...

01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:02.400
Uh-oh.

01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:04.400
Get the shit out of here!

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:06.400
This might be kind of doomed.

01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:09.400
All right, I think you're overextending yourself a little bit.

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:11.400
I'm worried about you.

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:13.400
You know what I'm going to do?

01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:15.400
I saved my slot.

01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:17.400
I'll be your therapist.

01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:20.400
Because I think you need to overcome your workaholism.

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:21.400
Okay.

01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:23.400
And I would love to wake up every morning and go,

01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:25.400
if I do nothing else today, and I won't,

01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:29.400
I'm going to help Steve Levyme relax.

01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:31.400
That all tracks for me.

01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:33.400
I would wake up every day if my job was to meet with you

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:36.400
on a beach and be like,

01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:38.400
hey, man, how you doing?

01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:42.400
Every day, I would be willing to have you sit down in front of me

01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:44.400
and go, how did it go today?

01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:47.400
And you tell me stuff and then I would be like,

01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:49.400
you know, you shouldn't let that get you down

01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:51.400
and all this stuff like I just like babbling at you

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:52.400
about how you should feel.

01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:54.400
I'd love that job.

01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:55.400
Thanks, yeah.

01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:59.400
I would love to be a part of that, yeah.

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:01.400
But I think I'm competing with you for that job

01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:04.400
because you and I are both saying the same thing.

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:06.400
Caleb, I'm talking to Caleb.

01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:08.400
You and I both are like,

01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:10.400
you know what I'd love to do is just hang out

01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:13.400
and talk to people about how they should fucking think.

01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:16.400
Can I change my...

01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:19.400
Can I be a talk show host?

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:20.400
That could be good.

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:22.400
This is a fantasy tribe.

01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:28.400
We're not vetting it through what's going to make the tribe survive.

01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:30.400
I'm actually curious about the data we'd get.

01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:36.400
If we asked 200 people, would we get like a certain percentage of people

01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:39.400
that'd be like, you know what, honestly swear to God,

01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:40.400
if you took money off the table,

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:44.400
I took everything off the table and you really told me that nothing was ever going to change.

01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:48.400
So I wasn't going to find out when I was 55 years old

01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:50.400
that no system was going to tell me,

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:51.400
you did what?

01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:55.400
You believed in hairstyling for 30 years?

01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:57.400
You're a dumb piece of shit.

01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:01.400
You were supposed to put that hairstyling money into a Roth IRA.

01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:02.400
You're fucking stupid.

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:05.400
Your kids got AIDS and you can't cure it now.

01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:07.400
You're a fucking piece of shit.

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:08.400
You have poverty.

01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:09.400
You should die.

01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:12.400
That's what we're all reacting to all the time.

01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:17.400
What's the thing if you took all that shit off the table that fear of like,

01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:21.400
oh fuck, I don't want to find out I did it wrong?

01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:24.400
What would you do as a sim all day?

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:33.400
I think the theory is primatologically that there would be enough people that would be like,

01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:35.400
I think I'd want to cut everyone's hair.

01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:37.400
There would be just enough of those people.

01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:40.400
There wouldn't be 40 of those people per 200 people.

01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:41.400
What would you do?

01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:43.400
The most simple thing that would make me happy?

01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:44.400
Me?

01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:46.400
Well, that's where it gets out to this thing.

01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:49.400
I swear to God, I'm saying what Caleb's saying.

01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:54.400
But I swear, I think I would be, let me think about it for a second.

01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:56.400
Can you guys do something else while I really think about it?

01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:58.400
I think that I'd teach you.

01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:03.400
There are people in anarcho-syndicalist societies that they go,

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:07.400
oh, I don't have to sweep floors all day long for no money.

01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:09.400
I can now do what I want.

01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:11.400
And there are people that go, you know what I want to do?

01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:12.400
I want to plant trees.

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:14.400
And I want to make the street pretty.

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:17.400
And I want to just go out and plant trees.

01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:22.400
And that's my life's ambition is to beautify something.

01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:24.400
Or people go, you know what?

01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:29.400
There's exactly the same amount of, oh, it's those assholes.

01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:30.400
Yeah, of course.

01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:32.400
You tricked us!

01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:36.400
You tricked us into believing in a dream!

01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:39.400
So we softened you.

01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:43.400
But there are people, there are also people that work in a factory all day long,

01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:49.400
and they go, if I had time between my commute and doing my day job

01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:53.400
and needing to eat food and feed my children and do all this stuff,

01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:58.400
I would love to make model airplanes because at heart I'm an engineer.

01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.400
I would love to make things.

01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:06.400
And if people had free time to actually do something that made them joyful

01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:13.400
and gave them glee, like for me, I think it'd be as simple as gardening.

01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:16.400
Like I would like to grow things because it's a very satisfying thing.

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:20.400
The idea that people, yeah, you saying that, first of all, I believe it.

01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:25.400
And second of all, it blows my fucking mind so much that I'm like, the dream is real.

01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:30.400
But there's a person that actually wants to garden that I'm like,

01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:35.400
because I'm like, I don't want nothing to do with that.

01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:40.400
So for you to say, if you're being remotely honest about it,

01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:43.400
I want to get down, I hear people express that all the time.

01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:46.400
I want my hands in the dirt and I love nurturing and stuff,

01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:49.400
and I see that passion, otherwise we wouldn't have shit that grows.

01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:52.400
It's obviously reliant to people that feel that way.

01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:57.400
And so, and then that does cast people like me in a little bit, and I think Caleb,

01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:00.400
you know, a little bit of a fraud complex, right?

01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:02.400
Because what are we doing? We're going like,

01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:07.400
I'm a frog, I'm a frog, I'm a frog.

01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:10.400
Does it count as any answer if what you want to do is hang out

01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:16.400
and let people know they're doing a good job?

01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:19.400
You want to be like, no, that makes me a bad person,

01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:22.400
maybe we haven't found like whatever...

01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:24.400
Why is that a frog complex?

01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:27.400
Fraud, you fucking dick!

01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:30.400
You said frog. You said frog.

01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:31.400
I sounded like frog.

01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:35.400
I don't care what I said. English is contextual.

01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:42.400
No one has ever had a frog complex.

01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:45.400
Actually, that sounds kind of, I mean, a frog complex,

01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:47.400
given our history and mythology of like,

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:50.400
frogs turning into princes that's like, I'm an ugly frog.

01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:51.400
That would make sense.

01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:52.400
You yelled at me.

01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:56.400
All right, well, I yelled at you because I'm a frog.

01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:57.400
He's got a frog complex.

01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:58.400
I'm talking to Caleb.

01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:02.400
Dan, do you know what a horny toad says?

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:05.400
Rub it.

01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:07.400
What? What does he say?

01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:08.400
Rub it.

01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:09.400
Rub it.

01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:10.400
Rub it?

01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:11.400
Rub it.

01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:12.400
Rub it.

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:13.400
Rub it.

01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:14.400
Rub it.

01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:17.400
Rub it.

01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:22.400
Yeah.

01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:24.400
Jeff is bowing.

01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:25.400
Curt's seeing.

01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:28.400
That's them saying they wish the show was over.

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:29.400
That's all they're saying.

01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:30.400
Yeah.

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:31.400
And I...

01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:34.400
They're saying that would have made a good closer.

01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:35.400
I don't...

01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:36.400
Yeah.

01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:38.400
I'm just gonna say that would have been a bad closer.

01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:42.400
I was certain that I was not going to follow up any questions.

01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:45.400
I thought you said frog complex, too.

01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:48.400
But I kind of wonder, I really always wonder that,

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:51.400
but I've listened to that Sapien's book and stuff.

01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:53.400
I just wonder about that.

01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:57.400
You scoop 100 people up with a net,

01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:01.400
and you dump them into an aquarium as much as you can.

01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:02.400
Probably drunk.

01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:05.400
If it...

01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:08.400
The aquarium's not...

01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:11.400
Not only is it not filled with water, Caleb,

01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:14.400
he was off-mine, and he said they'd probably drown.

01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:17.400
It's not filled with water, and it's not a real aquarium.

01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:20.400
But that idea of...

01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:22.400
I think that's like...

01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:24.400
I want to get to the bottom.

01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:26.400
It's an idealistic dream.

01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:32.400
I feel like I've spent 30 years belonging to an ideology

01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:35.400
that, even though it doesn't get questioned a lot,

01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:38.400
that underneath everything, what I really believe

01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:43.400
is that if you took 100 people and scooped them up randomly

01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:48.400
and plopped them onto a pile of desert

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:50.400
that they had to fend for themselves,

01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:53.400
that they would have problems,

01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:56.400
and there would be crime, and there would be horrible things happening,

01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:58.400
there would be hatred, there would be all these things.

01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:03.400
But that overall, there would be this order that evolved

01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:06.400
that was actually somehow kind of a little...

01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:10.400
The one thing you could say about that society

01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:12.400
if you came back to visit it in 10 years,

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:18.400
it would be there's a lot less knots in the psychology.

01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:21.400
There's a lot less of these things.

01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:25.400
30% of the people aren't having rape fantasies.

01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:29.400
It wouldn't be as fucking knotted up.

01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:34.400
It would be more natural.

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:36.400
People would just be like,

01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:39.400
here's what I like to do.

01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:41.400
I talked to Cindy about it.

01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:43.400
She said it's fine.

01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:45.400
Everyone would be like, I'm frustrated

01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:48.400
because Mark doesn't do enough of this.

01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:50.400
It would just be a little less knotted.

01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:53.400
You guys don't know what a phone cord is,

01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:56.400
but that's how I always look at society.

01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:59.400
They design society.

01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:03.400
There was this thing in the 90s called the phone cord.

01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:06.400
Engineers had this problem.

01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:08.400
They had to make phones.

01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:11.400
You had to be able to talk on them wherever you went,

01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:14.400
but we couldn't have you do that yet.

01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:16.400
Stick with me.

01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:18.400
So they needed cords,

01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:20.400
but they couldn't just make a fucking string

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:22.400
that was so long that you could walk everywhere

01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:24.400
because then the dog would hang itself

01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:27.400
and you would just step on it and all this shit.

01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:32.400
So they need this intricately curled cord.

01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:34.400
It's like a phone cord.

01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:39.400
If you pull on it, the spiral stretches out,

01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:41.400
and you could play with it when you talk on the phone,

01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:43.400
but overall it was just this attempt to turn something

01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:46.400
that wasn't elastic into something elastic.

01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:49.400
It was this attempt to take something that needed to be connected

01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:52.400
and make it as if it wasn't connected.

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:54.400
And that's how I feel about society,

01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:57.400
is that there's too many fucking...

01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:03.400
That laugh really got to me.

01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:05.400
It was a natural laugh,

01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:08.400
and it's important that it got to me.

01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:12.400
It's true what I'm saying doesn't make a lot of sense.

01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:15.400
But that's the point of explaining something to people.

01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:18.400
You got a real fraud complex.

01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:20.400
I just want to finish my thought,

01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:22.400
and I don't care that it doesn't make...

01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:25.400
If you can bring this train into the station,

01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:27.400
and we all know it's not going to make sense

01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:29.400
when I'm finished saying it.

01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:31.400
That's how I look at society,

01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:33.400
is that it's already fucking coiled.

01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:35.400
It's already designed to do something

01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:37.400
that it's not supposed to do.

01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:39.400
But also, that's noble.

01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:41.400
The idea that it just goes like that.

01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:43.400
When you look at a new phone cord,

01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:45.400
when you buy it at the hardware store,

01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:47.400
and you hold it in your hands,

01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:50.400
you're like, this is an actual marvel of engineering.

01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:52.400
It's kind of beautiful,

01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:55.400
but you want to touch it and put your finger through the...

01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:58.400
You kids don't know what a phone cord is.

01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:01.400
Also, you didn't know that you had to buy them

01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:03.400
at the hardware store.

01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:06.400
You did.

01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:08.400
The hardware store?

01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:11.400
No, there were phone stores.

01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:13.400
Yeah, it's that...

01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:15.400
Honestly, at this point,

01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:18.400
the temptation to take me down is...

01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:21.400
You're increasing my self-esteem.

01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:23.400
Increasing it.

01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:25.400
I'm sorry to inform you.

01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:28.400
Every breath I take without your permission

01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:30.400
raises my self-worth.

01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:33.400
There's a certain point when you force a human being

01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:37.400
to realize that they can't exist with your approval,

01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:39.400
it makes me stronger.

01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:41.400
I'm your worst nightmare.

01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:44.400
I'm the person that you didn't want to live to see today

01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:46.400
that did.

01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:48.400
Now I know you're powerless.

01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:51.400
Okay, don't applaud that.

01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:54.400
That's Hitler stuff.

01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:57.400
We don't want to do with the two hammers and the pink flight.

01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:59.400
What were you going to say?

01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:01.400
The phone cord.

01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:04.400
I just wanted to get to the finish of the phone cord.

01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:10.400
You millennials, the phone cord is notoriously easy to tangle.

01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:13.400
It was simultaneously a thing that was like,

01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:15.400
we solved it, we figured it out.

01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:18.400
This thing needs to connect from one side of your house

01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:21.400
to another or from the cradle of the phone to the handset.

01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:23.400
But who wants to deal with it?

01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:26.400
We want it to be kosher and friendly and nice.

01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:29.400
The result is this thing that stretches

01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:31.400
and it's this amazing feat of engineering.

01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:34.400
But when that thing tangles, when you use it,

01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:36.400
when you put it to the test,

01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:39.400
it is the most fucking knotted ass.

01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:41.400
It gets so fucking tangled.

01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:44.400
What I'm saying is, when we talk about anarchy,

01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:46.400
we're talking about just saying,

01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:48.400
what if we had a straight cord?

01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:52.400
And the answer is, that's not possible

01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:55.400
because we need this fucking thing to reach across the house.

01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:57.400
You can't talk about anarchy anywhere

01:45:57.400 --> 01:45:59.400
because you talk about 100 people.

01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:01.400
But it still is worth keeping in your head.

01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:03.400
You know, if this fucking thing was straight,

01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:06.400
Jesus Christ, we're talking about a phone, do it.

01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:07.400
All right, I'm done.

01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:09.400
Well, wait, okay.

01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:12.400
That's the last little cap.

01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:15.400
It's not like I actually think we should all go live in a cave

01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:16.400
and hurt bison.

01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:17.400
I don't really believe that.

01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:19.400
Well, what if our communities,

01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:21.400
the communities we actually lived and worked in,

01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:24.400
were so functional that we were less reliant

01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:27.400
on all these greater networks for support that we do?

01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:31.400
What if they started with the precept that if any society,

01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:33.400
if there's any single human being that's suffering,

01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:35.400
that the society is failing,

01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:37.400
that it's like that's a light bulb that's out

01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:40.400
from the perspective of a light bulb society.

01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:43.400
It doesn't need to be changed.

01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:45.400
It doesn't need to be disregarded.

01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:47.400
It needs to be, we need to deal with this.

01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:50.400
That we can draw, even if you're crazy,

01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:52.400
even if you're perverted,

01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:54.400
even if you're indigent,

01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:56.400
even if you're like whatever,

01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:59.400
whatever your challenge you're posing to our progress,

01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:01.400
that actually is the whole point of this,

01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:03.400
is that you're on the ground

01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:05.400
and you can't hold yourself up

01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:06.400
and you don't know what's going on

01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:08.400
or you're angry about something that we say to you,

01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:12.400
then okay, we gotta figure this out.

01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:14.400
What if everything was based on that?

01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:17.400
That was the core that went outward.

01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:19.400
It's impossible, is the answer,

01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:22.400
because our societies are obviously based on tribes

01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:25.400
that speared people better.

01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:29.400
There's no argument to be made.

01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:31.400
It's like a TED talk.

01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:34.400
I thought, what if we could feel for a living?

01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:36.400
Yeah, that'd be great.

01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:38.400
I know, I know we can't.

01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:40.400
I know we just had to spear each other.

01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:42.400
I'm talking into a microphone

01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:47.400
made out of the blood of weaker, better people.

01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:50.400
This microphone is made out of people

01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:52.400
that are better than me, that died,

01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:55.400
because they gave someone the benefit of the doubt.

01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:58.400
And someone was like,

01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:01.400
hey, come here for a second.

01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:04.400
Hey, love you, come over here.

01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:06.400
It sounds like he loves me.

01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:08.400
Honey, I don't think we should.

01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:10.400
Do we really want to live in a world

01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:13.400
where we can't respond to someone saying what he's saying?

01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:15.400
This Mad Max wasteland,

01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:18.400
isn't the beginning of making things better?

01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:20.400
You're right, I'm sorry.

01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:23.400
Don't fucking talk back to me ever again.

01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:26.400
Okay, well, I think you're gaslighting me.

01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:28.400
Fuck you, there's no such thing as that.

01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:31.400
You made that up because you're fucking crazy.

01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:34.400
There's no such thing as gaslighting, you fucking made it up

01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:36.400
because you're fucking crazy.

01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:39.400
And I love you, and I'm just going to go talk to this guy.

01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:42.400
I just want to trade you some petrol for some lizard skin.

01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:44.400
Hey, whoa.

01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:49.400
You should have never trusted another fucking human piece of shit.

01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:52.400
I'm going to be the one that writes the history books.

01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:54.400
Fucking piece of shit.

01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:56.400
What the fuck is happening?

01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:58.400
What's going on?

01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:01.400
What is happening right now?

01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:04.400
Native Americans invented gaslighting.

01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:06.400
I thought it was clear.

01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:09.400
You've lost your mind.

01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:12.400
You've gone crazy in front of her very eyes.

01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:15.400
Well, I'll take your word for that, but...

01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:18.400
I have an Emmy, I don't think I can be...

01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:24.400
Maybe I'm testing the limits.

01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:26.400
I think you've proven that.

01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:28.400
Yeah, I love it.

01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:30.400
Come on, how unclear was that really?

01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:32.400
You were following that?

01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:34.400
That's a simple wasteland play.

01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:36.400
There was a couple over here.

01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:38.400
Nobody was following that.

01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:40.400
How many of you followed that?

01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:42.400
Look at all those hands.

01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:44.400
We should have someone interpret it.

01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:46.400
Without help.

01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:48.400
No, I got it.

01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:50.400
I'm glad it wasn't all of your hands.

01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:53.400
Come up here and explain what Dan was talking about, please.

01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:56.400
Okay.

01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:59.400
Caleb just volunteered his microphone for Nova.

01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:01.400
Let's give a hand for Caleb.

01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:09.400
Caleb will live on in nobility.

01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:11.400
He's still...

01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:13.400
He's like...

01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:15.400
He gave you his mic.

01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:17.400
Nova, can you take Rob's mic?

01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:19.400
No.

01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:24.400
It's actually my birthday tomorrow.

01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:26.400
It's your birthday tomorrow at Nova's birthday.

01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:28.400
It's your birthday?

01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:29.400
Yeah, tomorrow.

01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:31.400
Well, happy birthday, almost.

01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:33.400
Thank you.

01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:36.400
Encapsulate what Dan was breaking down for us.

01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:38.400
Well...

01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:40.400
It's like telephone.

01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:42.400
I don't know how much better I am at explaining things than Dan,

01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:44.400
but I got what he was saying.

01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:47.400
I feel like when you're on my side, though, I do better.

01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:49.400
Huh?

01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:51.400
You're a more charismatic person,

01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:53.400
so it just doesn't matter if you understood me or not.

01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:56.400
Just say you do, and then people will respect me.

01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:58.400
Oh, maybe.

01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:00.400
That's all. That's my stake in it.

01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:02.400
Or I just look like a rabid Harmon fan.

01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:04.400
Steve, give Rob your mic.

01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:06.400
He's just kissing at the feet of Harmon.

01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:08.400
Like, no, fuck you.

01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:10.400
Yeah, well...

01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:12.400
Yeah, like...

01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:14.400
Who's the first guy that was saying,

01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:16.400
we love you?

01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:18.400
That was saying,

01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:20.400
at the beginning of the Wasteland sketch with the couple...

01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:22.400
Yeah, there's a guy saying, we love you.

01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:24.400
Come over here. Who was that?

01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:26.400
No, this is the whole exercise

01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:28.400
that is this person.

01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:30.400
I'm kidding. I'm sorry.

01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:32.400
Okay, yeah, there was a couple

01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:34.400
in a cave or whatever,

01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:36.400
and then some dude is trying to come over

01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:38.400
to be like, hey, hey guys, whatever.

01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:40.400
A cave dude?

01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:42.400
A cave dude. In a different cave

01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:44.400
or whatever, from a different tribe or something.

01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:46.400
An outlander, yeah.

01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:48.400
He's coming to the couple's house

01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:50.400
and the wife's just like, oh, I don't know

01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:52.400
if you should trust him. He could be trying to fool us.

01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:54.400
And then the guys are like,

01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:56.400
no, what kind of world,

01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:58.400
you know, what kind of world

01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:00.400
where we can't trust people?

01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:02.400
Like, maybe if I reach out my hand,

01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:04.400
maybe he'll be like, oh, I'm not going to kill this guy

01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:06.400
or something, or maybe we don't want to assume

01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:08.400
that this is a bad guy.

01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:10.400
There's a little aside there which got a lot of applause.

01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:12.400
Yeah, I like it a lot.

01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:14.400
Where I did a little social commentary.

01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:16.400
I liked it a lot because it's like,

01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:18.400
yeah, it's a good commentary on guys being like,

01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:20.400
look, we got to be cordial to each other.

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:22.400
Hey, fuck you, wife.

01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:24.400
And you know where I got that?

01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:26.400
You know where I researched that?

01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:28.400
Looking into my fucking self.

01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:30.400
Which is why people like you are a fan

01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:32.400
of me because no matter what I do,

01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:34.400
at least to god damn I'm going to take inventory.

01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:36.400
Unlike all of my friends

01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:38.400
I'm doing great, I'm doing great.

01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:40.400
Please continue.

01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:44.400
Yeah, that was like a little commentary

01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:46.400
on how we're like, hey, you know what?

01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:48.400
Man's got to be nice to man.

01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:50.400
But then it's just like...

01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:52.400
I'm abusing women. I'm like a misogynist.

01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:54.400
That was me. That character was me.

01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:56.400
I'm willing to say it now.

01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:58.400
It's like, oh, there's a guy over there.

01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:00.400
He's got a gas canister and he's like,

01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:02.400
oh, over here.

01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:04.400
Oh, woe be

01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:06.400
to the poor fucking partner that trusted me enough.

01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:08.400
It's like, oh, you sound like you know what you're doing.

01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:10.400
That's the first person I would abuse.

01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:12.400
And then this person over there,

01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:14.400
I'd be like, woe, hello.

01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:16.400
And I'd be like, look, I'm the man.

01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:18.400
I'm going to make the decision. You know what?

01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:20.400
I'm going to decide for both of us.

01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:22.400
Because otherwise I'm going to be ashamed of myself

01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:24.400
if I don't, yeah.

01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:26.400
That I'm going to reach out a hand

01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:28.400
to this other human being.

01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:30.400
Whereas maybe if both of them collaborated

01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:32.400
and we're like, that guy looks like he's going to...

01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:34.400
Who knows? Let's be safe.

01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:36.400
Oh, yeah, like if a couple teamed up really,

01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:38.400
then maybe things would be okay or something.

01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:40.400
Right, so then he chooses to trust this person.

01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:42.400
Yeah, he chooses to trust the guy.

01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:44.400
He chooses to let him into his house.

01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:46.400
And then you saw what happened, right?

01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:48.400
I don't know if I'm doing better than Dan did.

01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:50.400
No, you're doing great.

01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:52.400
Yeah.

01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:54.400
And then the guy comes into the house

01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:56.400
and the guy's just like,

01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:58.400
I'm going to kill this guy and his wife

01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:00.400
and I'm going to take their shit.

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:02.400
Yeah.

01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:04.400
It's simple to fall out for.

01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:06.400
Yeah, he's like the guy who's just like,

01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:08.400
look, trust no one or whatever.

01:54:08.400 --> 01:54:10.400
Everybody gets the joke.

01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:12.400
Huh?

01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:14.400
We just proved it.

01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:16.400
That was the whole point of...

01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:18.400
I don't know if you guys realize this,

01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:20.400
but my whole point here in this whole exercise

01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:22.400
was to validate that Dan

01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:24.400
successfully explained himself.

01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:26.400
Yeah, stop gaslighting Dan.

01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:28.400
And here we have proof that that has happened.

01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:30.400
So we have a lot of fun.

01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:32.400
This idea we circle

01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:34.400
that I don't know what I'm talking about

01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:36.400
and I don't make any sense,

01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:38.400
while mostly accurate

01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:40.400
is also it's part of a chain of behavior.

01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:42.400
He's the only one I want listening.

01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:44.400
I'm listening.

01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:46.400
All right, you're not listening.

01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:48.400
A chain of behavior.

01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:50.400
You can't just say two words.

01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:52.400
That's the good trick.

01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:54.400
I wasn't saying

01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:56.400
that you weren't making a point.

01:54:56.400 --> 01:54:58.400
I wanted you to, like, expound on it.

01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:00.400
I didn't quite catch it.

01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:02.400
I don't think that's how he expressed it.

01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:04.400
I think he was like, Dan,

01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:06.400
you need to be in an asylum.

01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:08.400
He was like,

01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:10.400
you're fucking nuts right now

01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:12.400
and you need to re-evaluate

01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:14.400
how your brain works,

01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:16.400
because no one knows what you're talking about

01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:18.400
and you're fucking crazy.

01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:20.400
You got that right.

01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:22.400
I thought it was Native Americans

01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:24.400
and conquistadors.

01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:26.400
You were kind of farther back.

01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:28.400
The truth is, I'm not that much of a history buff.

01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:30.400
I've just been playing Fallout 4

01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:32.400
for a while.

01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:34.400
I think about that a lot, like Desert Wasteland.

01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:36.400
What if we were all dropped onto something?

01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:38.400
What would happen? I think about that all the time.

01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:40.400
Are you a gamer? Do you play RPG,

01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:42.400
like, video games?

01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:44.400
What's this?

01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:46.400
Just start heating up for me.

01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:48.400
It's okay if you're not.

01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:50.400
Clearly you're not.

01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:52.400
Or you would have been like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:54.400
I remember last time we talked

01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:56.400
about Sims or whatever,

01:55:56.400 --> 01:55:58.400
but there's other games that I like,

01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:00.400
like Stardew Valley.

01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:02.400
That's the expression on your face.

01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:04.400
He's an alcoholic, he doesn't remember our last conversation.

01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:06.400
I thought it was like,

01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:08.400
no, I'm into football.

01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:10.400
No, you're a drunk dad.

01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:12.400
You were like, what happened last week?

01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:14.400
Last week was the special, right?

01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:16.400
Every one of our cameras,

01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:18.400
we could bond, but this is our relationship,

01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:20.400
is my memory.

01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:22.400
I'm like, yeah, I don't want to make this sled.

01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:24.400
It's going to be a great sled.

01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:26.400
It could be like me remembering things.

01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:28.400
Dan, maybe a bad pitch.

01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:30.400
We have like a couple minutes left.

01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:32.400
What if we do a very brief

01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:34.400
D&D thing where it's you and Nova,

01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:36.400
and you guys are on like a little

01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:38.400
side quest right now.

01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:40.400
Ooh, awesome.

01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:42.400
Did you say you're on board?

01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:44.400
You find yourself on a little raft.

01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:50.400
Okay.

01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:52.400
You're on a little raft.

01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:54.400
You've been sailing for days

01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:56.400
for the shores of mines

01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:00.400
to find the mines of shores.

01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:04.400
You're on a raft?

01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:06.400
You're on a raft.

01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:08.400
Is my character...

01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:10.400
Let's establish that now.

01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:12.400
I am Guffolk,

01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:14.400
a healer

01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:18.400
of folk.

01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:20.400
I'm Tammy,

01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:22.400
flibber of derbs.

01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:24.400
Flibber of derbs?

01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:26.400
I'm flibber of derbs.

01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:28.400
Sorry.

01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:30.400
The sun, it's making my brain heal.

01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:32.400
It's a little hot.

01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:34.400
We should probably get some water,

01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:36.400
or maybe not.

01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:38.400
I'm sorry I talked you into this adventure.

01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:40.400
It's probably not what you expected.

01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:42.400
You know what, I kind of seemed like

01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:44.400
I was letting you talk me into it,

01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:46.400
but really I was on board the whole time.

01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:48.400
I just, you know.

01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:50.400
Yeah, okay, so we're on this raft.

01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:52.400
We gotta make it to shore.

01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:54.400
Oh, you make it to shore.

01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:56.400
I take my apology back.

01:57:56.400 --> 01:57:58.400
I nailed it.

01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:00.400
We're partners in this adventure.

01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:02.400
You don't get to just be like,

01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:04.400
hey, I'm the one leading this.

01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:06.400
Giant crab!

01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:08.400
Oh, shit.

01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:10.400
I don't want to get eaten alive.

01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:12.400
It's bigger than that.

01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:14.400
I think that, by definition,

01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:16.400
the giantness means you can't stomp them.

01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:18.400
I was thinking of a real giant crab.

01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:20.400
You're thinking of a regular crab.

01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:22.400
A stompable crab, they call them.

01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:24.400
I was thinking of a real giant crab,

01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:26.400
which is only kind of big.

01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:28.400
You have real giant crabs like at Albertsons.

01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:30.400
You could still stomp them.

01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:32.400
Do I have any weapons?

01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:34.400
There's actually a whole stompable crab section.

01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:36.400
I don't know why, since there's no non-stompable crabs.

01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:38.400
It's a small, medium, large.

01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:40.400
We have oars for a raft.

01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:42.400
I start stabbing at it with an oar.

01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:44.400
Is it actively trying to attack us?

01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:46.400
Oh, actively.

01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:48.400
Okay, yeah.

01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:50.400
Will you help me out?

01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:52.400
What's your name?

01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:54.400
I know your name, Mr.

01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:56.400
We're in a raft forever.

01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:58.400
This is not the time to high-road me.

01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:02.400
What's your preferred pronoun?

01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:04.400
Kill the crab!

01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:06.400
Don't worry about it.

01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:08.400
We'll figure it out later.

01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:10.400
It doesn't matter.

01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:12.400
You guys want me to come back?

01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:14.400
Wait, I didn't say anything about my preferred pronoun.

01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:16.400
I didn't say anything about that.

01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:18.400
No, I knew you did that.

01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:20.400
No, wait.

01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:22.400
Actually, I need to ask you this.

01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:24.400
Did the crab ever attack us?

01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:26.400
It just said giant crab.

01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:28.400
It seemed like it was attacking.

01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:30.400
It seemed like it was attacking.

01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:32.400
Right, I asked him if it was actively attacking,

01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:34.400
and he said it was.

01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:36.400
Sorry.

01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:38.400
Stop, you need to help me attack you.

01:59:38.400 --> 01:59:40.400
It's attacking us actively.

01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:42.400
I'm going to come back later.

01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:44.400
That's what I'm saying.

01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:46.400
When a crab says that, you...

01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:48.400
Okay, so next time we can just start a little domestic fighting,

01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:50.400
and then whatever it is, we'll leave us alone.

01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:52.400
Because it'll be too awkward for them, and they'll just leave.

01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:54.400
Yeah, I don't know how to...

01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:56.400
Bye, crab. Sorry.

01:59:56.400 --> 01:59:58.400
Yeah.

01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:00.400
Sorry.

02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:02.400
I just didn't know that you could talk.

02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:04.400
The first thing I said was giant crab.

02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:06.400
It was giant crab.

02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:10.400
Why would you say that?

02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:12.400
Fair enough, fair enough.

02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:14.400
I'm going for real now. Fair enough, I'm sorry.

02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:16.400
We fucked up.

02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:18.400
Can we both say we fucked up?

02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:20.400
Okay, I'll say I fucked up.

02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:22.400
If there's one thing I've learned,

02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:24.400
we need to be a team.

02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:26.400
Otherwise, I'm not gaslighting you.

02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:28.400
Sidewalking.

02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:30.400
He's sideways walking. I don't know what that means.

02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:32.400
I don't know if that's like a micro.

02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:34.400
That's why he's leaving.

02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:36.400
Okay, we fucked up.

02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:38.400
I contacted with not enough information,

02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:40.400
and you didn't back me up when I made the decision.

02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:42.400
We both fucked up.

02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:44.400
As your husband's giant crab,

02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:46.400
what are you doing? You were supposed to be home

02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:48.400
like a half hour ago.

02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:50.400
We better get out of here. This is awkward.

02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:52.400
I think he's elsewhere.

02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:54.400
I think if we stay, it's going to be better than if we...

02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:56.400
Oh, so...

02:00:56.400 --> 02:00:58.400
Who are your new friends, Marcia?

02:00:58.400 --> 02:01:00.400
Do you have these friends over here?

02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:02.400
Well, they were kicking me.

02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:04.400
I'm sorry. I apologize.

02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:06.400
This one was stepping on my foot a lot.

02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:08.400
I was thinking he was doing something.

02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:10.400
Why don't we attack them?

02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:12.400
You came at me. I'm sorry.

02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:14.400
I attack.

02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:16.400
I attack.

02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:18.400
I'm a protective crab.

02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:20.400
I attack Dan,

02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:22.400
or whatever his name is,

02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:24.400
over there.

02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:26.400
Sorry about that. We should have left.

02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:28.400
Giant crabs!

02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:30.400
Claw attack.

02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:32.400
Okay, or it's right.

02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:34.400
We're going to do it now.

02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:36.400
If someone attacks me, hit them with an or.

02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:38.400
You know what? Even if they don't,

02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:40.400
partners.

02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:42.400
Fucking or attack.

02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:44.400
No matter what. I don't even care if it makes me evil.

02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:46.400
Let's fucking go down.

02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:48.400
Let's do it. We just got to be a team.

02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:50.400
I'm a crab rogue,

02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:52.400
so I use claw sneak attack.

02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:54.400
I think I have a plus

02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:56.400
2d6.

02:01:56.400 --> 02:01:58.400
I've been with the ors.

02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:00.400
Is it not doing anything?

02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:02.400
There's no real rules right now.

02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:06.400
It's a free-for-all.

02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:08.400
We don't have to take turns.

02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:10.400
Just roll the dice on my crab attack.

02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:12.400
Oh, yeah.

02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:14.400
No, you get a six.

02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:16.400
Do you have your dice?

02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:18.400
Why do you have a five-hour energy?

02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:20.400
This is how parlor games started before

02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:22.400
Louis Pasteur and Marie Curie.

02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:24.400
They were like,

02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:26.400
we need some fucking dice or something.

02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:28.400
It was just rich people in a parlor

02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:30.400
going like, will I do this? Will I do that?

02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:32.400
Fuck you!

02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:34.400
And then someone was like, look.

02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:36.400
Get me a pen and paper.

02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:38.400
You can't just do that.

02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:40.400
You can't just say that I didn't do that.

02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:42.400
Let's roll for it.

02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:44.400
Do I deal six crab damage on Dan?

02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:46.400
They weren't improv trained.

02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:48.400
Yeah, you deal six crab damage.

02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:50.400
On who? On me?

02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:52.400
Spencer checked out a long time ago.

02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:54.400
I'm the only person who understands

02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:56.400
what's happening.

02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:58.400
These are the rules of the game.

02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:00.400
Spencer, Junova, and I have a combined

02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:02.400
as long as we work together perk

02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:04.400
that raises our hit points by 600%.

02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:06.400
Morale boost?

02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:08.400
Team morale boost? Yeah.

02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:10.400
As long as there's no hierarchy

02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:12.400
between us, we double

02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:14.400
our hit points.

02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:16.400
We're individuals who have teamed up.

02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:18.400
I'm going to release the blink dogs.

02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:20.400
Yeah.

02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:22.400
No.

02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:24.400
Everybody keeps looking at me.

02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:26.400
What am I?

02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:28.400
Mastering your game?

02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:30.400
Yeah.

02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:32.400
No, you guys are. You're your own masters.

02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:34.400
All right, we'll keep joining it.

02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:36.400
I kill nobody.

02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:38.400
Mislead.

02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:40.400
You kill her?

02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:42.400
No, I kill nobody.

02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:44.400
Not Nova.

02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:46.400
Sorry.

02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:48.400
What the slur?

02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:50.400
A frog complex?

02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:56.400
I jump up on the nearest

02:03:56.400 --> 02:03:58.400
rock.

02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:00.400
What?

02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:02.400
You corrected jump to leap

02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:04.400
is what I got.

02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:06.400
I swear to God,

02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:08.400
I will never...

02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:10.400
You're going to try to find me.

02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:12.400
You're going to be like, it's me.

02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:14.400
I was the guy.

02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:16.400
I made your show.

02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:18.400
I'm not going to be like, fuck you.

02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:20.400
You're a piece of shit.

02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:22.400
It's not going to happen.

02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:24.400
I'm going to leave here through the chimney.

02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:26.400
Because of you.

02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:28.400
What?

02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:30.400
Because I don't want to interact.

02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:32.400
You're going to make me uncomfortable.

02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:34.400
I can't understand you.

02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:36.400
You're feeding into it.

02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:38.400
It sounds like claws.

02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:40.400
It's just fun to rally.

02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:42.400
Jesus Christ, it's like fucking...

02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:44.400
Are you guys drunk?

02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:46.400
That doesn't matter.

02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:48.400
I'm drunk.

02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:50.400
I don't do this.

02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:52.400
Jesus.

02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:54.400
I kill everyone.

02:04:54.400 --> 02:04:56.400
I kill everyone.

02:04:56.400 --> 02:04:58.400
I don't.

02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:00.400
I kill them with...

02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:02.400
I stand up on a rock and I say...

02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:04.400
Sorry.

02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:06.400
My friend, I forgot your name.

02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:08.400
Tammy?

02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:10.400
We were on our raft and we washed up

02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:12.400
and we fucked up.

02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:14.400
We made a lot of mistakes

02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:16.400
and we feel terrible about them

02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:18.400
and we want

02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:20.400
to become

02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:22.400
a part of this island

02:05:22.400 --> 02:05:24.400
moving forward.

02:05:24.400 --> 02:05:26.400
We want to take our cues from you guys.

02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:28.400
What's in it for us?

02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:30.400
We've come here.

02:05:30.400 --> 02:05:32.400
You are already here. You live here.

02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:34.400
We have sharpened ores with some of your blood on them.

02:05:34.400 --> 02:05:36.400
I don't know if that's a thing.

02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:38.400
No, we got some of those.

02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:40.400
Then we have nothing.

02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:42.400
You have to trust us.

02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:44.400
I mean, it has to be

02:05:44.400 --> 02:05:46.400
like a zero-sum game.

02:05:46.400 --> 02:05:48.400
All right, okay. How about this?

02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:50.400
Return

02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:52.400
the gemstone.

02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:56.400
I need to speak to my partner

02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:58.400
for one second.

02:05:58.400 --> 02:06:00.400
I mean...

02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:02.400
Return it?

02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:04.400
It's like the only reason we're here.

02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:06.400
It's the reason we're here?

02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:08.400
What the fuck have you been withholding from me?

02:06:08.400 --> 02:06:10.400
You forgot because you were drunk.

02:06:10.400 --> 02:06:12.400
I thought we were in a shipwreck. Did I cause the shipwreck?

02:06:12.400 --> 02:06:14.400
No, we were heading towards the mines, remember?

02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:16.400
He said we were heading towards the mines.

02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:18.400
Oh my god, the mines! We were trying to get your gem.

02:06:18.400 --> 02:06:20.400
Oh, I'm so sorry.

02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:22.400
You should never have...

02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:24.400
If it was a problem, then I would just leave.

02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:26.400
I wouldn't be putting up with it.

02:06:26.400 --> 02:06:28.400
You're not codependent, are you?

02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:30.400
No.

02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:32.400
Is everything okay here?

02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:34.400
Just give us a second.

02:06:34.400 --> 02:06:36.400
Okay, leave my house.

02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:38.400
Well, we didn't...

02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:42.400
I'll go to your raft.

02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:44.400
He said return the gem.

02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:46.400
I cast

02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:48.400
Detect Passive Aggression.

02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:52.400
Everyone keeps looking at me.

02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:54.400
Look, these crabs are pretty passive aggressive.

02:06:54.400 --> 02:06:56.400
He said return the gem. We don't have the gem.

02:06:58.400 --> 02:07:00.400
Well, it's not with us.

02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:02.400
Tell me, oh my god.

02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:04.400
It's...

02:07:04.400 --> 02:07:06.400
You know what? I knew you'd forget is the thing.

02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:08.400
Oh my god, we have a gem.

02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:10.400
You know what?

02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:14.400
Well, we don't have it with us.

02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:16.400
We gotta get the fuck out of here.

02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:18.400
We gotta get out of here.

02:07:18.400 --> 02:07:20.400
The raft is deflating, though.

02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:22.400
We're stuck here.

02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:24.400
I crab attack the raft.

02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:26.400
You were the first to run!

02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:28.400
We're running!

02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:30.400
We don't care about the raft.

02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:32.400
We're running.

02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:34.400
We're running up the beach.

02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:36.400
Oh, you guys get there at the same time.

02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:38.400
We're running away from the crabs.

02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:42.400
Our destination is

02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:44.400
away.

02:07:44.400 --> 02:07:46.400
The raft gets destroyed then.

02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:48.400
We run blindly into the forest.

02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:50.400
Yeah, that's great.

02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:52.400
All we have is each other and some oars.

02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:54.400
But what will happen in the forest?

02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:56.400
Cliffhanger!

02:07:56.400 --> 02:07:58.400
Cliffhanger!

02:07:58.400 --> 02:08:00.400
Give it up for Nova.

02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:06.400
Steve Levy.

02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:08.400
Kayla, thank you so much.

02:08:08.400 --> 02:08:10.400
Rob Straub, everybody.

02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:14.400
Spencer Crittenden.

02:08:14.400 --> 02:08:16.400
I'm here returning

02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:18.400
to Comptroller Jeff Davis, your mayor.

02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:20.400
Dan Harmon, thank you all.

02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:22.400
If you guys didn't get him any...

02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:24.400
Can I get him, everybody?

02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:26.400
Can I get a you?

02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:28.400
Church.

02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:30.400
Skulking weapon.

02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:32.400
See you again.

02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:54.400
Drive fast, take chances.

02:08:54.400 --> 02:09:04.400
It's a good show.
