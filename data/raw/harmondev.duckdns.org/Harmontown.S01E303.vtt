{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:07.360\nAll right, from Dining with Hypewriter, the Dingleberry Toggle model from MacArthur Park,\n\n00:07.360 --> 00:08.360\nLos Angeles.\n\n00:08.360 --> 00:18.680\nMy name is Jeff Davis, you're Comptroller, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:18.680 --> 00:22.840\nI see Dave Kline down there, can I get a Upe for the whole audience?\n\n00:22.840 --> 00:29.840\nLet's welcome Spencer Crittenden in your Game Master, extraordinaire.\n\n00:29.840 --> 00:39.840\nSpencer, there he is.\n\n00:39.840 --> 00:55.440\nFor good measure, let's welcome the Mayor of Harmontown, the eponymous Dan Harmon.\n\n00:55.440 --> 00:56.440\nThank you.\n\n00:56.440 --> 01:05.120\nYo, yo, yo, yo, emmy night, fight for your life, go down the red carpet and the lime\n\n01:05.120 --> 01:09.800\nlife, celebrate your director and agent, fuck your mama so hard, she was hatin'\n\n01:09.800 --> 01:17.280\nup, Christiansen, use the dark side of the force to get in to your mama's pussy, Sandman.\n\n01:17.280 --> 01:19.800\nAll right, thank you.\n\n01:19.800 --> 01:26.280\nI don't know, I don't know why, sometimes, yeah, I'll make you this deal, every night\n\n01:26.280 --> 01:31.440\nI come out, I'll see if I start rapping good, and if I don't, like, just the other side\n\n01:31.440 --> 01:36.280\nof the deal is, just let me stop, and I don't think it's gonna be hard.\n\n01:36.280 --> 01:39.320\nThat sounds like it solves a lot of the problems with the rapping.\n\n01:39.320 --> 01:43.760\nI don't hear anybody protesting, no, keep rapping, after it turns out you're gonna\n\n01:43.760 --> 01:50.080\nrap badly, keep going, push through it, fake it till you make it, I think this is the easiest\n\n01:50.080 --> 01:51.080\ndeal we've ever made.\n\n01:51.080 --> 01:55.640\nIsn't it true, though, that, I think it's axiomatic that when you win an emmy, your\n\n01:55.640 --> 02:03.160\nrapping skills dip for a while?\n\n02:03.160 --> 02:07.840\nDid I win another emmy?\n\n02:07.840 --> 02:12.080\nDo I have twice as many emmys as I had before the emmys?\n\n02:12.080 --> 02:14.720\nYeah, no, I have a...\n\n02:14.720 --> 02:18.680\nHow many people got to keep the statute, did you get one?\n\n02:18.680 --> 02:21.720\nJesus Christ, yes.\n\n02:21.720 --> 02:33.920\nIt is fascinating, though, when you win one, your fantasy of what it would be like is sort\n\n02:33.920 --> 02:42.760\nof simultaneously, everything about it is true, and simultaneously, it's so demystifying.\n\n02:42.760 --> 02:50.040\nI'm not sure what I mean by that, but it's like you picture yourself going up, and you\n\n02:50.040 --> 02:56.680\nhold this thing, and you're like, holy shit, this happened, and it feels like a scratch-off\n\n02:56.680 --> 03:01.240\nticket, it just sort of is random, you just have this weird relationship, is this gonna\n\n03:01.240 --> 03:06.600\nhappen or not, and then you're walking into a fantasy, and then the really weird thing\n\n03:06.600 --> 03:13.480\nis that you're just sort of like directed off stage, and then there's just all this\n\n03:13.480 --> 03:18.400\nshit that happens, and none of it, it's like, you know, when you're on ecstasy or mushrooms\n\n03:18.400 --> 03:24.320\nor something where life is a joke, and the whole system is geared around people that\n\n03:24.320 --> 03:28.880\nare gonna feel that way, so it's very much like a slaughterhouse.\n\n03:28.880 --> 03:37.680\nIt's like the opposite of a slaughterhouse, it's an immortality house, because they know\n\n03:37.680 --> 03:45.800\nthat they're working with dazed narcissists who are like, moo, I want an Emmy, and you\n\n03:45.800 --> 03:53.400\njust follow robot chicken, and you just go down, and they'll corral you in certain areas,\n\n03:53.400 --> 03:57.760\nand now you can eat a sandwich, you haven't had one in four hours, and you're just sort\n\n03:57.760 --> 04:00.880\nof like, yeah, I'm so hungry, and then someone's like, that's for press, and you're like, I\n\n04:00.880 --> 04:07.840\ndon't care, I have an Emmy, but you just sort of become this baby, because I think that\n\n04:07.840 --> 04:14.800\nis all of our fantasies, right, like about that idea of getting an award, it really,\n\n04:14.800 --> 04:22.240\nI think what we all think, I mean, I'll use my I statements anytime you want, but I want\n\n04:22.240 --> 04:28.760\nto connect with you guys, and I just feel like that's the thing that you want to achieve,\n\n04:28.760 --> 04:34.080\nis that one brief weightless moment of like, so I'm okay no matter what I do, which is\n\n04:34.080 --> 04:43.600\nsuch an ironic feeling to have to win an award to feel, it makes no sense, it doesn't, because\n\n04:43.600 --> 04:47.360\nyou're supposed to feel that when you wake up, and then you're absolutely...\n\n04:47.360 --> 04:51.440\nWhich of the two Emmys that you have on your mantle now, weighs the most?\n\n04:51.440 --> 04:54.320\nThey're both six pounds, Jeff, and I didn't look it up, and I don't care.\n\n04:54.320 --> 04:55.320\nNo.\n\n04:55.320 --> 04:56.320\nI mean...\n\n04:56.320 --> 05:03.280\nI did not look into whether or not the shelf would be able to hold another one.\n\n05:03.280 --> 05:08.200\nI don't plan for this shit, I have no ambitions.\n\n05:08.200 --> 05:11.360\nDo you feel like you might have to get a new mantle, because if you keep winning all these\n\n05:11.360 --> 05:15.000\nEmmys, you have to like, you have to up your mantle game?\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:16.480\nI'm all done, buddy.\n\n05:16.480 --> 05:27.640\nThis one was a huge, like, I absolutely did not expect, I fully, like, I was like, deserve\n\n05:27.640 --> 05:34.280\nsure, expect no, no.\n\n05:34.280 --> 05:37.400\nIt's a very relatable stance.\n\n05:37.400 --> 05:38.400\nBut I would also...\n\n05:38.400 --> 05:39.400\nDid I deserve it?\n\n05:39.400 --> 05:41.160\nYou better fucking believe I deserve it.\n\n05:41.160 --> 05:45.880\nAnd everybody always, everybody nominated deserves it, because that all represents all of this\n\n05:45.880 --> 05:46.880\nwork.\n\n05:46.880 --> 05:47.880\nI was like, that's what I'm saying.\n\n05:47.880 --> 05:48.880\nWho did you beat?\n\n05:48.880 --> 05:50.520\nWho are you up against on this one?\n\n05:50.520 --> 05:53.240\nLike, Family Guy and shit, or who?\n\n05:53.240 --> 06:00.720\nYeah, South Park, and The Simpsons, and The Muppets, I don't remember.\n\n06:00.720 --> 06:04.680\nLook, I can't believe you gotchered me.\n\n06:04.680 --> 06:07.120\nI don't know who else was nominated.\n\n06:07.120 --> 06:08.120\nI didn't care.\n\n06:08.120 --> 06:09.120\nCan we...\n\n06:09.120 --> 06:15.120\nI didn't fucking care, because I knew I was...\n\n06:15.120 --> 06:16.280\nBecause you deserved it.\n\n06:16.280 --> 06:19.400\nBecause I knew I wasn't going to talk if I won, so I don't need to know their edge of\n\n06:19.400 --> 06:20.400\nlife.\n\n06:20.400 --> 06:24.280\nWait, so did Rylan get up and talk?\n\n06:24.280 --> 06:26.200\nYeah, we met, like, who's going to talk?\n\n06:26.200 --> 06:28.880\nThey tell you, you've got to pick a person to talk.\n\n06:28.880 --> 06:32.560\nSo then, like, Justin and I were like the whole time, we're like, who's going to talk?\n\n06:32.560 --> 06:33.560\nYou should talk.\n\n06:33.560 --> 06:34.560\nNo, you should talk.\n\n06:34.560 --> 06:35.560\nYou should talk.\n\n06:35.560 --> 06:42.400\nAnd they're like, let Jessica talk, that would be badass, you know, but it's like, who's\n\n06:42.400 --> 06:43.400\ngoing up?\n\n06:43.400 --> 06:46.560\nAnd that was the more important thing, it was like, who's going up?\n\n06:46.560 --> 06:51.160\nBecause it's like, they put this fear of God in you, like, you've got to get up here,\n\n06:51.160 --> 06:53.440\n30 seconds for your speech and stuff.\n\n06:53.440 --> 06:57.720\nAnd then you're sitting there through the show, and you're like, there's like 20 people\n\n06:57.720 --> 06:59.480\nout here.\n\n06:59.480 --> 07:03.680\nIf they all get up and go up there, it turns out the answer is yes, it's all fine, like\n\n07:03.680 --> 07:05.320\nPath of Least Resistance.\n\n07:05.320 --> 07:09.440\nFor a production thing, it's like, yeah, everybody get up there, it's an award for everybody.\n\n07:09.440 --> 07:14.680\nBut we were just like, I'm just like sweating and going like, what do you do, what are you\n\n07:14.680 --> 07:15.680\ndoing?\n\n07:15.680 --> 07:21.080\nWow, who's, Justin said, I think it should just be me and you, and then so and so and\n\n07:21.080 --> 07:22.080\nso and so.\n\n07:22.080 --> 07:27.160\nAnd I was like, okay, Justin, but, and the whole show's going, I just want to clarify,\n\n07:27.160 --> 07:34.200\nare you saying that if, and there's like, Cody between us, like it's not just me and\n\n07:34.200 --> 07:35.200\nhis ear.\n\n07:35.200 --> 07:41.760\nWhat are you saying, and the winner for best some other human being that you're doing this\n\n07:41.760 --> 07:50.080\nduring is, are you saying, if they call our name and obviously the big asterisk hears we're\n\n07:50.080 --> 07:55.440\nnot expecting to win, so we shouldn't be having this conversation, let alone behind probably\n\n07:55.440 --> 08:02.160\nthe other nominees, I'm pretty sure Trey and Matt are sitting in front of us, I don't know.\n\n08:02.160 --> 08:12.560\nBut if we do win air quotes, are you saying that when we stand up, if anyone else stands\n\n08:12.560 --> 08:19.760\nup, should we look at them and go, and just, no, no, I'm not saying, and the winner for\n\n08:19.760 --> 08:24.440\nthe second award that's human beings that you'll never know, okay, well, I don't want,\n\n08:24.440 --> 08:29.360\nI just, I don't know, talking about, we don't know, no one knows, there's no leadership,\n\n08:29.360 --> 08:37.160\nwe don't know, we don't know who goes up, and I was like, and then I think Mike McMahon\n\n08:37.160 --> 08:42.800\nis like, who had the right answer, he's like, it's everyone in the catalog, it's everyone\n\n08:42.800 --> 08:49.040\nthat's listed, it's like, in the program it'll say, so those are the people that go up, it's\n\n08:49.040 --> 08:51.040\nlike 11 people for Rick and Morty.\n\n08:51.040 --> 08:52.640\nAnd they all get their own individual trophy.\n\n08:52.640 --> 08:56.680\nYes, those are the people that get statues, they go up, because they have like credit\n\n08:56.680 --> 09:01.480\nof some whatever kind on the episode, so all those people, we get herded like cattle into\n\n09:01.480 --> 09:03.720\nthis back room and stuff.\n\n09:03.720 --> 09:08.560\nAnd then you fill out the thing, I talked about this, right, like the weird thing is\n\n09:08.560 --> 09:14.800\nthat you go into this back room, and everyone is just like, it's so, you're looking at people\n\n09:14.800 --> 09:23.400\nwho are, I was like, these are the only people for whom it's not an honor to be nominated,\n\n09:23.400 --> 09:28.360\nthey have to be the people that just sit there, and they just continually all day, for two\n\n09:28.360 --> 09:33.080\ndays for the Creative Arts Emmys, they're like, just non-stop chain of people.\n\n09:33.080 --> 09:40.320\nFor them, it is like a slaughterhouse, but they're like, congratulations, like they have\n\n09:40.320 --> 09:45.560\nthis look on their face, like a Disneyland employee, like you get fired if someone says\n\n09:45.560 --> 09:49.200\nyou didn't smile, you know, like I imagine that the pressure is on them, or that they\n\n09:49.200 --> 09:54.040\ncome to the table with like, they actually wanted to be near that, because they have\n\n09:54.040 --> 09:59.440\nto, they're just like, oh my god, congratulations, and you're like, yeah, but we, it's just\n\n09:59.440 --> 10:05.520\nlike this is like chain of people, it's just this assembly line, and you get handed a statue\n\n10:05.520 --> 10:11.400\nfrom a box, and it has nothing on it, my statue still has nothing on it, because you fill\n\n10:11.400 --> 10:16.080\nout a form that goes to a place that makes the plates, and then the plate gets mailed\n\n10:16.080 --> 10:17.160\nto you.\n\n10:17.160 --> 10:19.280\nSo, and the form...\n\n10:19.280 --> 10:21.760\nYou got it like super glue it back on to the thing, right?\n\n10:21.760 --> 10:25.320\nIt has little screws on the back, I'm so glad we're getting to the, I mean, I feel like\n\n10:25.320 --> 10:30.240\nif there's one thing my podcast can do for people, is prepare you for your Emmy.\n\n10:30.240 --> 10:31.240\nYeah.\n\n10:31.240 --> 10:33.080\nWe're here to make you...\n\n10:33.080 --> 10:36.840\nIt has like a little band on it, that you could, but the curious thing about it is that\n\n10:36.840 --> 10:42.200\nthe form says, what's your name, what's your address, what's the name of your show, what\n\n10:42.200 --> 10:46.320\ncategory did you win, it's not like multiple choice, so I just keep thinking like, so if\n\n10:46.320 --> 10:47.320\nI just write like...\n\n10:47.320 --> 10:48.320\nOh, yeah.\n\n10:48.320 --> 10:49.320\nThat would be so badass.\n\n10:49.320 --> 10:56.320\nLike, you could just write Rick and Morty Parentheses' Biggest Dick.\n\n10:56.320 --> 10:57.320\nYeah.\n\n10:57.320 --> 11:02.720\nYou write, Hitler did nothing wrong, like that's what 4chan would do, like it's just like,\n\n11:02.720 --> 11:07.440\nit just feels like, you know, you look and you go like, this is hackable, because I'm\n\n11:07.440 --> 11:11.680\nstanding next to Justin, and Justin's right, I'm like, what's the name, because the categories\n\n11:11.680 --> 11:12.920\naren't easy to remember.\n\n11:12.920 --> 11:23.680\nI was like, outstanding evidence of goodness by a thing on TV that was a cartoon, what did\n\n11:23.680 --> 11:24.680\nyou put?\n\n11:24.680 --> 11:29.760\nIt's like, best TV show that's a cartoon, and I'm like, well, that's not the same, I don't\n\n11:29.760 --> 11:34.720\nthink either of them are right, is the idea that they just put these things in a wood\n\n11:34.720 --> 11:39.120\nchipper and then some like gnome goes, I know what these guys mean, they're high.\n\n11:39.120 --> 11:45.680\nIf you wrote best TV show, that would pass muster, no, they don't make it.\n\n11:45.680 --> 11:49.680\nIt's like the final chamber of like the Holy Grail, where you have to actually like pick\n\n11:49.680 --> 11:53.680\nit out, and you don't get one.\n\n11:53.680 --> 11:58.600\nCan we talk about the sandwiches?\n\n11:58.600 --> 12:05.440\nThis is just, okay, so I'm an outsider, come insider in this whole Hollywood thing, but\n\n12:05.440 --> 12:11.600\nthere's this thing you encounter as a person in Hollywood, which is all these sandwiches\n\n12:11.600 --> 12:19.640\nthat you can't eat, it's crazy, we went to Comic-Con and they're like, hey, you're going\n\n12:19.640 --> 12:23.960\nto be in this room doing all these interviews, it's going to be great, it's like a big party,\n\n12:23.960 --> 12:29.520\nMike Tyson's there, you got all these sandwiches, you can't eat any of these sandwiches.\n\n12:29.520 --> 12:34.680\nThe sandwiches will just have this like, and it won't be like a big blinking sign, it's\n\n12:34.680 --> 12:35.680\nembarrassing.\n\n12:35.680 --> 12:40.760\nIt's a sign just big enough for you to be halfway in your mouth, and then it says X-Files.\n\n12:40.760 --> 12:48.280\nIt says ham and cheese, it says like tomato and chicken and not for you.\n\n12:48.280 --> 12:54.920\nThese are Jillian Anderson sandwiches, it's so great because you can sit down, and you\n\n12:54.920 --> 13:00.240\ncan take sandwiches, and those are the two activities to do in those rooms, it's surprising\n\n13:00.240 --> 13:05.680\nthat even in the Emmy back dungeons and stuff, it's still like you want a sandwich, or you\n\n13:05.680 --> 13:08.840\nwant an Emmy, but don't get cocky, buddy, these are fucking-\n\n13:08.840 --> 13:17.200\nAnd I did say I was drunk and on vodka and victory, and I did say to my publicist who\n\n13:17.200 --> 13:21.640\nwas politely saying, those are for press, and I said, here's a headline for you, Dan\n\n13:21.640 --> 13:24.720\nHarmon eats your fucking sandwich.\n\n13:24.720 --> 13:26.720\nThey love that stuff.\n\n13:26.720 --> 13:28.880\nI run with it.\n\n13:28.880 --> 13:33.760\nTo run with everything else, they fucking, that's a story I approve of.\n\n13:33.760 --> 13:38.520\nI was hungry, I'll tell you all this item, make it a feature, make it a puff piece, or\n\n13:38.520 --> 13:42.240\na fucking like, oh, come at me, the sandwich eater.\n\n13:42.240 --> 13:43.720\nI drink your milkshake.\n\n13:43.720 --> 13:44.720\nSorry.\n\n13:44.720 --> 13:49.160\nYou come over there and drink the press' milkshake.\n\n13:49.160 --> 13:54.160\nYeah, yeah, I eat your sea in which, yeah, I'm sure they would have been fine with it.\n\n13:54.160 --> 13:58.080\nWait, so why were there segregated sandwiches?\n\n13:58.080 --> 14:04.360\nBecause the thing is, why do it in the first place other than to humiliate people?\n\n14:04.360 --> 14:07.240\nThat's not how food is served.\n\n14:07.240 --> 14:09.560\nThat's how food is served.\n\n14:09.560 --> 14:14.880\nI think when you get to the point where food is on a tray, I think that is an important\n\n14:14.880 --> 14:15.880\nrule.\n\n14:15.880 --> 14:21.360\nI think we're getting to a Christ-like thing here where it's like, maybe ownership, we\n\n14:21.360 --> 14:27.040\ndon't have to take aim at the concept of ownership in general, you're not allowed to, you should\n\n14:27.040 --> 14:29.080\nmake a sandwich and then not care who eats it.\n\n14:29.080 --> 14:33.000\nI think that person's like, I just made this, it's three in the morning, I'm so hungry,\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:36.720\nit's halfway to my mouth, okay, don't test me.\n\n14:36.720 --> 14:42.880\nBut once sandwiches are mass produced, yeah, going like, you know what, you can't say that\n\n14:42.880 --> 14:43.880\nthey're someone's.\n\n14:43.880 --> 14:47.480\nWell, if you care that much, you don't protect it through norms.\n\n14:47.480 --> 14:48.720\nI'll tell you that.\n\n14:48.720 --> 14:50.120\nYou gotta put it behind plexiglass.\n\n14:50.120 --> 14:52.280\nYeah, you need design work.\n\n14:52.280 --> 14:53.280\nYeah.\n\n14:53.280 --> 14:55.520\nYou gotta put enough effort.\n\n14:55.520 --> 14:59.360\nWhen your sandwiches are important, pay a security guard to shoot people that eat your\n\n14:59.360 --> 15:00.360\nsandwiches.\n\n15:00.360 --> 15:01.360\nAll right.\n\n15:01.360 --> 15:03.520\nOr just increase the size of the sign.\n\n15:03.520 --> 15:04.520\nYeah.\n\n15:04.520 --> 15:11.600\nWhat was the thing that I was like, I was like, yeah, put money in, oh, I don't know, I can't\n\n15:11.600 --> 15:16.360\nget into that, that's too, I'm sorry, that got personal, okay, but I'm like, oh yeah,\n\n15:16.360 --> 15:22.880\nif you don't care, if you really care about this shit, then you would express it through\n\n15:22.880 --> 15:27.400\nrisking things, so I'll let that person have it, I'll tell you that.\n\n15:27.400 --> 15:29.400\nSpeaking of risking things, let's bring out Rob Schrab.\n\n15:29.400 --> 15:52.160\nOh shit.\n\n15:52.160 --> 15:57.800\nI hope we talk about you winning an Emmy every week.\n\n15:57.800 --> 16:03.600\nI can't wait till next week when we hear, come on, this is another story about you winning\n\n16:03.600 --> 16:05.120\nan Emmy.\n\n16:05.120 --> 16:12.960\nLike that would be, oh man, people want to know about the statue, people want to know.\n\n16:12.960 --> 16:13.960\nNo they do.\n\n16:13.960 --> 16:14.960\nThis is like insider stuff.\n\n16:14.960 --> 16:17.080\nNo, they do, Spencer.\n\n16:17.080 --> 16:18.080\nPeople want to know.\n\n16:18.080 --> 16:19.080\nPeople want to know.\n\n16:19.080 --> 16:20.080\nPeople want to know, Spencer.\n\n16:20.080 --> 16:26.080\nThey want to know on a weekly basis, any new, I'm glad we could come on the show and agree.\n\n16:26.080 --> 16:29.400\nIt's a goddamn Emmy night, it gets goddamn Emmy night.\n\n16:29.400 --> 16:33.080\nIt's Emmy night every night here, apparently.\n\n16:33.080 --> 16:34.080\nWhat was last week?\n\n16:34.080 --> 16:35.080\nWell it was Emmy night two.\n\n16:35.080 --> 16:36.080\nThey do them two weeks in a row, it's not my fault.\n\n16:36.080 --> 16:37.080\nIt was Emmy night two.\n\n16:37.080 --> 16:48.080\nOh, you can't fault me, cause the last episode was Emmy night two, and now it's Emmy night.\n\n16:48.080 --> 16:51.080\nWhy aren't you talking about Bill Hader?\n\n16:51.080 --> 16:53.080\nI'm going to get around to that.\n\n16:53.080 --> 16:54.080\nI'm not cool.\n\n16:54.080 --> 16:57.080\nI'm going to get around to my fellow Emmy winners.\n\n16:57.080 --> 16:59.080\nWhat about Dinklage?\n\n16:59.080 --> 17:00.080\nLet's hear it for the Dink.\n\n17:00.080 --> 17:01.080\nHe won tonight.\n\n17:01.080 --> 17:02.080\nYeah, he did.\n\n17:02.080 --> 17:09.240\nAll right, a lot of Dinklage haters in the crowd, a lot of silent Dinklage impression.\n\n17:09.240 --> 17:14.480\nPeople not ready to give it up for Dinklage, just out of hand, I was like, look, he can\n\n17:14.480 --> 17:15.480\nearn it.\n\n17:15.480 --> 17:16.480\nRight, exactly.\n\n17:16.480 --> 17:17.480\nI haven't watched the show.\n\n17:17.480 --> 17:21.600\nI'm certainly not going to fall into that bullshit.\n\n17:21.600 --> 17:22.600\nHaven't seen it.\n\n17:22.600 --> 17:23.800\nI'll take a look.\n\n17:23.800 --> 17:26.320\nNow that it won an Emmy, that's what I do.\n\n17:26.320 --> 17:27.640\nI did it with Nurse Jackie.\n\n17:27.640 --> 17:29.480\nI'm doing it with Game of Thrones.\n\n17:29.480 --> 17:31.960\nWell, let me know how you think he did.\n\n17:31.960 --> 17:36.040\nHe's fucking Peter Dinklage, you horrible grinches.\n\n17:36.040 --> 17:42.080\nI thought that was the one guy I could say that would get you people, my fans.\n\n17:42.080 --> 17:46.680\nAren't you basically emotional Dinklages?\n\n17:46.680 --> 17:49.960\nIsn't that a description of my audience?\n\n17:49.960 --> 17:51.840\nEpisode title?\n\n17:51.840 --> 17:53.560\nEmotional Dinklages.\n\n17:53.560 --> 17:57.160\nI am excited for him.\n\n17:57.160 --> 17:58.560\nI don't know, but did he win one?\n\n17:58.560 --> 17:59.960\nI don't know if I did Dinklage.\n\n17:59.960 --> 18:02.240\nHe won Best TV.\n\n18:02.240 --> 18:03.800\nWhoa.\n\n18:03.800 --> 18:04.960\nHe's got a great one.\n\n18:04.960 --> 18:06.960\nDid you ever see it?\n\n18:06.960 --> 18:10.280\nOh my God, it's like 80 inches.\n\n18:10.280 --> 18:13.960\n80 inches.\n\n18:13.960 --> 18:16.960\nDid I say that I wanted to thank you guys for showing up on...\n\n18:16.960 --> 18:18.280\nOh, you spelled Dinklages.\n\n18:18.280 --> 18:19.280\nEmmy night?\n\n18:19.280 --> 18:20.280\nYeah, on Emmy night.\n\n18:20.280 --> 18:21.280\nD-I-N.\n\n18:21.280 --> 18:22.280\nThis is bad.\n\n18:22.280 --> 18:25.920\nHey, Schrab, what's up with you?\n\n18:25.920 --> 18:30.760\nI was looking up stuff.\n\n18:30.760 --> 18:31.760\nWhat's up?\n\n18:31.760 --> 18:33.280\nMight as well fill this dead air.\n\n18:33.280 --> 18:34.280\nThat's what I was trying to do.\n\n18:34.280 --> 18:35.280\nI was trying to provide cover.\n\n18:35.280 --> 18:36.280\nAll right.\n\n18:36.280 --> 18:37.280\nWell, you searched the internet.\n\n18:37.280 --> 18:38.280\nWell, I was away, Schrab.\n\n18:38.280 --> 18:39.280\nWell, I was away.\n\n18:39.280 --> 18:42.000\nDid your chair get groovier?\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:43.000\nYou got a better chair.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:44.320\nI'm working on a good group.\n\n18:44.320 --> 18:46.320\nAre you happy?\n\n18:46.320 --> 18:48.200\nWhen are we going to know that you're settled into your...\n\n18:48.200 --> 18:49.640\nI love it here.\n\n18:49.640 --> 18:50.640\nYeah.\n\n18:50.640 --> 18:52.520\nI've been coming every week.\n\n18:52.520 --> 18:55.920\nBut would you trade this chair in for one of those shitty stools?\n\n18:55.920 --> 18:56.920\nNo.\n\n18:56.920 --> 18:59.160\nYou're happy with this.\n\n18:59.160 --> 19:00.160\nI'm happy.\n\n19:00.160 --> 19:05.240\nI could use an ottoman.\n\n19:05.240 --> 19:09.240\nAnd a nice quilt to keep my knees warm.\n\n19:09.240 --> 19:12.520\nOh, we can get you a quilt.\n\n19:12.520 --> 19:14.760\nJeff is putting the piano thing.\n\n19:14.760 --> 19:16.480\nYou do it like this.\n\n19:16.480 --> 19:18.480\nLike an ottoman.\n\n19:18.480 --> 19:19.480\nYeah, I support it.\n\n19:19.480 --> 19:20.480\nYou know what?\n\n19:20.480 --> 19:22.920\nI think you should have a fucking morphine IV.\n\n19:22.920 --> 19:26.680\nI think you should have an electronic bed.\n\n19:26.680 --> 19:29.880\nI think you should have like a...\n\n19:29.880 --> 19:31.880\nI have a few notes.\n\n19:31.880 --> 19:37.080\nHe's holding seat music.\n\n19:37.080 --> 19:42.440\nI have a couple of notes that I'm going to bring to the next meeting that I have\n\n19:42.440 --> 19:43.440\nOh, yeah.\n\n19:43.440 --> 19:46.440\nWell, I have a few notes, too.\n\n19:46.440 --> 19:52.440\nRead them at your leisure, Jack Rabke.\n\n19:52.440 --> 19:53.440\nYeah.\n\n19:53.440 --> 19:58.440\nHe just named a real guy.\n\n19:58.440 --> 20:02.440\nThat was a guy we worked for 20 years ago at Monster House.\n\n20:02.440 --> 20:03.440\nHe just...\n\n20:03.440 --> 20:07.360\nHis name just came out of your brain because we're dying.\n\n20:07.360 --> 20:12.880\nWe're just like, Ferris wheel, depression, Hitler.\n\n20:12.880 --> 20:13.880\nI want to wish...\n\n20:13.880 --> 20:14.880\nSay what you will.\n\n20:14.880 --> 20:15.880\nI'm happy.\n\n20:15.880 --> 20:18.600\nI want to wish a very happy birthday to Caleb.\n\n20:18.600 --> 20:19.600\nHe's turning 21.\n\n20:19.600 --> 20:25.800\nHe took a little solo pilgrimage from Portland, ran into him at the drawing room before I\n\n20:25.800 --> 20:26.800\ncame here.\n\n20:26.800 --> 20:28.800\nIs he here tonight?\n\n20:28.800 --> 20:32.400\nIf he's not, then he's a con artist.\n\n20:32.400 --> 20:33.400\nI heard him.\n\n20:33.400 --> 20:35.080\nIt sounded like he was over there.\n\n20:35.080 --> 20:36.080\nHe bought me a drink.\n\n20:36.080 --> 20:40.600\nCaleb, how's it going, man?\n\n20:40.600 --> 20:45.060\nYou got good

it.\n\n20:54.560 --> 20:55.560\nThere's a fight.\n\n20:55.560 --> 20:58.060\nJeff and Dan are fighting.\n\n20:58.060 --> 21:02.480\nAbsolutely nothing happened.\n\n21:02.480 --> 21:10.440\nA fine young man expressed a sincere embrace of his favorite show.\n\n21:10.440 --> 21:13.440\nWhat is it?\n\n21:13.440 --> 21:21.040\nEveryone turned it into a thing because people are animals and I have no loyalty to them.\n\n21:21.040 --> 21:23.040\nThe show has become watching me...\n\n21:23.040 --> 21:26.680\nYeah, where's these fucking Emmy sandwiches, man?\n\n21:26.680 --> 21:27.680\nYou should have brought some Emmy sandwiches.\n\n21:27.680 --> 21:28.680\nI hate them.\n\n21:28.680 --> 21:29.680\nI hate them.\n\n21:29.680 --> 21:30.680\nI'm gonna shit them out.\n\n21:30.680 --> 21:33.680\nI'm gonna shit them out other than the fucking Emmys.\n\n21:33.680 --> 21:34.680\nAll right.\n\n21:34.680 --> 21:40.080\nI don't think Hullabaloo has been made about the fact that I fucking met and hung out with\n\n21:40.080 --> 21:42.280\nRon Perlman on a fucking plane today.\n\n21:42.280 --> 21:43.280\nWell, yeah.\n\n21:43.280 --> 21:44.280\nHere we go.\n\n21:44.280 --> 21:45.280\nThat

21:49.280\nShake Ron Perlman's hand.\n\n21:49.280 --> 21:50.280\nThank you, Ron.\n\n21:50.280 --> 21:55.280\nHe's never worked a day in his life.\n\n21:55.280 --> 21:59.720\nHow do you be a hellboy and have his fucking hands are made of just like...\n\n21:59.720 --> 22:01.840\nIt's supposed to be famous for having hell hands, right?\n\n22:01.840 --> 22:02.840\nLike just have a hell glove or something.\n\n22:02.840 --> 22:05.040\nWell, he's got that one giant hand.\n\n22:05.040 --> 22:06.040\nAll right.\n\n22:06.040 --> 22:07.040\nI don't know, man.\n\n22:07.040 --> 22:08.040\nOh, my God.\n\n22:08.040 --> 22:09.040\nRon.\n\n22:09.040 --> 22:10.040\nWe talked about...\n\n22:10.040 --> 22:11.040\nYour hand.\n\n22:11.040 --> 22:12.040\nWe talked about French film.\n\n22:12.040 --> 22:13.040\nHe has soft hands.\n\n22:13.040 --> 22:15.600\nLike, we're gonna have dinner together.\n\n22:15.600 --> 22:17.760\nHe's my new best friend, so go...\n\n22:17.760 --> 22:19.280\nYou can fuck your Emmy.\n\n22:19.280 --> 22:20.280\nI'll take...\n\n22:20.280 --> 22:24.840\nI'll take Ron Perlman's delicious soft hands.\n\n22:24.840 --> 22:29.640\nLook, my winning of an Emmy was not a challenge to anybody here.\n\n22:29.640 --> 22:33.000\nI never thought for a second while I was winning it, oh, this proves that other people are\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:34.520\npieces of shit.\n\n22:34.520 --> 22:39.160\nI'm too busy trying to rise above the fucking muck and mire, and I'm like, well, this means\n\n22:39.160 --> 22:42.000\nI can breathe for six weeks.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:44.160\nSo don't fucking get mad at me.\n\n22:44.160 --> 22:47.320\nGo ahead, get mad at me, you little pieces of shit.\n\n22:47.320 --> 22:48.320\nSorry.\n\n22:48.320 --> 22:50.840\nNow, like, okay, true colors.\n\n22:50.840 --> 22:53.400\nI did think for a second you guys are pieces of shit.\n\n22:53.400 --> 22:55.080\nI was like, well, this proves you're pieces of shit.\n\n22:55.080 --> 22:56.080\nDo you think that's your last Emmy?\n\n22:56.080 --> 22:57.080\nDo you think that's the last one?\n\n22:57.080 --> 23:02.680\nI hope it is, because I want to, the way I want to go out is like both of those pointed\n\n23:02.680 --> 23:06.960\nwings like fucking carotid and jugular.\n\n23:06.960 --> 23:08.960\nThat's a safe statement.\n\n23:08.960 --> 23:09.960\nWhat?\n\n23:09.960 --> 23:10.960\nOh, Jesus.\n\n23:10.960 --> 23:11.960\nWait, I'll tell you.\n\n23:11.960 --> 23:16.360\nDianne Harmon controversially proposes suicide by Emmy.\n\n23:16.360 --> 23:20.120\nNo, that's not what I was...\n\n23:20.120 --> 23:23.240\nThat's so irresponsible because there's so many kids out there that are going to win\n\n23:23.240 --> 23:26.320\nan Emmy so they can kill themselves.\n\n23:26.320 --> 23:31.800\nI almost, like, if this is where I won't go, I almost want to say, yeah, America, kids,\n\n23:31.800 --> 23:36.720\nif you're thinking of ending your life, do it with an Emmy just because it would trick\n\n23:36.720 --> 23:39.760\nthem into a rock soup thing where they're like, they would get to a point where they're\n\n23:39.760 --> 23:44.600\nlike 45 and they're like, I don't need to do this.\n\n23:44.600 --> 23:47.400\nSchrab's doing something.\n\n23:47.400 --> 23:54.880\nThe show has just become me, me showing up and, and, and...\n\n23:54.880 --> 23:58.760\nI'm not building anything.\n\n23:58.760 --> 24:02.640\nIt's like it was set up.\n\n24:02.640 --> 24:07.400\nI'm trying so hard, I have a list of things to talk about.\n\n24:07.400 --> 24:09.760\nStart from the bottom.\n\n24:09.760 --> 24:12.600\nI can't, that's a thing I got crossed off.\n\n24:12.600 --> 24:15.840\nMandy, everybody go see Mandy if you haven't.\n\n24:15.840 --> 24:17.840\nLove, man.\n\n24:17.840 --> 24:19.920\nThat's a movie, the Nick Cage movie.\n\n24:19.920 --> 24:20.920\nYeah.\n\n24:20.920 --> 24:21.920\nYeah, it's great.\n\n24:21.920 --> 24:25.680\nSo, or not because of iTunes, you can, it's, it's out, right?\n\n24:25.680 --> 24:26.680\nYeah.\n\n24:26.680 --> 24:27.680\nYou can just stream it.\n\n24:27.680 --> 24:28.680\nThe soundtrack's great too.\n\n24:28.680 --> 24:29.680\nI just bought the soundtrack as well.\n\n24:29.680 --> 24:32.680\nA real, a real, a real tour de force.\n\n24:32.680 --> 24:33.680\nWe're a fire burner.\n\n24:33.680 --> 24:37.360\nWe're really, hopefully we'll start burning up the charts.\n\n24:37.360 --> 24:38.360\nOh, I fucked up.\n\n24:38.360 --> 24:39.360\nYeah, shake it.\n\n24:39.360 --> 24:40.360\nI fucked up.\n\n24:40.360 --> 24:41.360\nUndo typing.\n\n24:41.360 --> 24:42.360\nUndo.\n\n24:42.360 --> 24:43.360\nShaking his phone.\n\n24:43.360 --> 24:44.360\nWell, that, as you said, undo.\n\n24:44.360 --> 24:45.360\nLike, I accidentally pasted...\n\n24:45.360 --> 24:46.360\nSpencer.\n\n24:46.360 --> 24:48.360\nJust shaking your phone, help?\n\n24:48.360 --> 24:49.360\nYeah.\n\n24:49.360 --> 24:50.360\nFor undo, it's, are you undo?\n\n24:50.360 --> 24:51.360\nWhat do you want from me?\n\n24:51.360 --> 24:52.360\nNot from me.\n\n24:52.360 --> 24:53.360\nGod damn it.\n\n24:53.360 --> 24:54.360\nThey should have a better gesture.\n\n24:54.360 --> 24:55.360\nAll right.\n\n24:55.360 --> 24:57.000\nI'm moving up from the bottom of the list.\n\n24:57.000 --> 25:01.200\nUber, I learned how to do multiple locations.\n\n25:01.200 --> 25:05.720\nSo I will actually provide more Uber rides now because the truth is, if I've ever been\n\n25:05.720 --> 25:11.560\nwith you and it's time to get an Uber, if I think that there's going to be some chicanery\n\n25:11.560 --> 25:14.800\nwith like, oh, we're going to go here and then we're going to drop off someone, so I'll\n\n25:14.800 --> 25:17.600\nkind of fade in the background.\n\n25:17.600 --> 25:19.400\nBut I'll throw my money at anything.\n\n25:19.400 --> 25:22.360\nI just don't want to have to talk to people because it seemed to me that you have to get\n\n25:22.360 --> 25:27.560\nin the car and then you have to go, oh, thank you for showing up under the auspices of our\n\n25:27.560 --> 25:28.560\noriginal destination.\n\n25:28.560 --> 25:31.760\nHowever, a few things to throw at you.\n\n25:31.760 --> 25:33.520\nWould you mind making a brief stop?\n\n25:33.520 --> 25:39.000\nAnd I don't want to have those conversations, but I found a, I didn't find it.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:40.960\nIt was shown to me by a friend.\n\n25:40.960 --> 25:45.160\nI can't believe this guy went on Emmy.\n\n25:45.160 --> 25:47.000\nThere's an easy interface.\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:48.640\nThere's a plus button when you think of it.\n\n25:48.640 --> 25:50.400\nYou can just add locations.\n\n25:50.400 --> 25:52.360\nI picked up this fucking asshole.\n\n25:52.360 --> 25:55.600\nWhat did you think the plus button meant?\n\n25:55.600 --> 26:00.400\nI didn't make the destination louder.\n\n26:00.400 --> 26:02.400\nAh, 32.\n\n26:02.400 --> 26:04.400\nI don't know.\n\n26:04.400 --> 26:06.400\nI mean, whatever.\n\n26:06.400 --> 26:16.440\nI'm going to play musical stings every time Schrab scores on you.\n\n26:16.440 --> 26:17.440\nFine.\n\n26:17.440 --> 26:19.960\nYou just got dunked on, man.\n\n26:19.960 --> 26:20.960\nI don't care.\n\n26:20.960 --> 26:23.720\nI'm not going to, here's something that won't get a musical score.\n\n26:23.720 --> 26:28.600\nI mean not letting it affect me, which is actually a huge, you're fucking like, like\n\n26:28.600 --> 26:29.600\nthat's me winning.\n\n26:29.600 --> 26:30.840\nLike I don't care.\n\n26:30.840 --> 26:32.320\nIt's me, therapy's working.\n\n26:32.320 --> 26:33.320\nI don't care.\n\n26:33.320 --> 26:34.760\nI don't fucking care.\n\n26:34.760 --> 26:36.560\nLike fucking hit me, dude.\n\n26:36.560 --> 26:39.360\nLike you don't, you can't control my feelings.\n\n26:39.360 --> 26:44.400\nYou don't, you're, you're like, I can, I can fucking put you in an airlock and flush you\n\n26:44.400 --> 26:47.760\ninto space like a fucking predator.\n\n26:47.760 --> 26:57.720\nThat was my favorite ending of the predator when, when Danny Glover, that one I deserved.\n\n26:57.720 --> 27:00.040\nDanny Glover put the predator.\n\n27:00.040 --> 27:05.560\nI will acknowledge that burn I did in the airlock and sent the predator out into space.\n\n27:05.560 --> 27:09.520\nBut that's how you can always trust me, you know, like, I'm like, oh yeah, I fucked up.\n\n27:09.520 --> 27:10.760\nAnd then you're like, I like Dan.\n\n27:10.760 --> 27:11.760\nHe knows when he fucks up.\n\n27:11.760 --> 27:14.960\nSo that means when I say he's not hurting me, he's not hurting me.\n\n27:14.960 --> 27:20.680\nI hear the new, the predator movie is getting mixed reviews.\n\n27:20.680 --> 27:23.760\nIt did not do well this weekend.\n\n27:23.760 --> 27:27.160\nGosh, I wish they would give that and Jay Moore one more shot.\n\n27:27.160 --> 27:28.160\nYeah.\n\n27:28.160 --> 27:33.400\nI just, I, I, I, I don't, I don't think we've gotten the predator.\n\n27:33.400 --> 27:34.400\nMake him the predator.\n\n27:34.400 --> 27:36.440\nLet's just double down on that one.\n\n27:36.440 --> 27:40.800\nWhat about, maybe predator purge, like obviously these are two things that society's just\n\n27:40.800 --> 27:45.880\nlike, you're flooding it, you're flooding the engine.\n\n27:45.880 --> 27:49.120\nIt's the ninth purge movie, like, what do people like about it?\n\n27:49.120 --> 27:51.480\nI can't figure it out.\n\n27:51.480 --> 27:56.600\nIt's the title and the promise that you made in the poster, which you obviously can't deliver\n\n27:56.600 --> 27:59.880\non within the budget you're willing to spend.\n\n27:59.880 --> 28:04.520\nA proper purge movie would, for instance, be a television show, which it is.\n\n28:04.520 --> 28:08.800\nI think I read it in my old friend Anthony Hemingway, I think he's working on that purge\n\n28:08.800 --> 28:10.320\nshow on Netflix.\n\n28:10.320 --> 28:13.920\nI make it an anthological TV show.\n\n28:13.920 --> 28:17.120\nPeople's interest in the purge concept is anthological.\n\n28:17.120 --> 28:20.640\nThe movies try to be anthological, and then they ruin themselves with this thing.\n\n28:20.640 --> 28:25.040\nLike, it's like, oh, I'm supposed to care about, like, the ending of the purge franchise.\n\n28:25.040 --> 28:29.880\nNo, you're supposed to, and the predator thing is just like, oh, what if there was a thing\n\n28:29.880 --> 28:33.360\nhunting us because we hunt things so much?\n\n28:33.360 --> 28:34.360\nIt's not working.\n\n28:34.360 --> 28:37.520\nIt's getting, we're getting under our own feet here.\n\n28:37.520 --> 28:43.840\nI see a predator poster, I'm 45 years old, I'm like, what, is this a reboot or a sequel?\n\n28:43.840 --> 28:47.280\nThere was Predators, and then there was a guy from that 70s show, was a serial killer\n\n28:47.280 --> 28:48.280\nin it.\n\n28:48.280 --> 28:55.760\nAnd now the movie's just the predator, and it's just, this is year 18, like, don't\n\n28:55.760 --> 28:56.760\nGoogle it.\n\n28:56.760 --> 29:02.880\nThat's what the slogan for the predator is, predator, don't Google it.\n\n29:02.880 --> 29:10.960\nThe, from the creators of nothing before, trust us, so we came up with this new idea,\n\n29:10.960 --> 29:15.880\nwhat if you were getting hunted, you like, hey, you like eating a hot dog, what if you\n\n29:15.880 --> 29:21.560\nwere the hot dog, don't look it up, we've never done it before, like, no one, no, like,\n\n29:21.560 --> 29:26.280\nif you're eight years old, you still know, just from that handshake between Carl Weathers\n\n29:26.280 --> 29:31.600\nand fucking Schwarzenegger, everyone knows that fucking bicep handshake.\n\n29:31.600 --> 29:34.880\nAnd if you haven't seen the movie, that's like, are you ready for your close-up, Mr.\n\n29:34.880 --> 29:35.880\nDeMille?\n\n29:35.880 --> 29:39.520\nRemember when that lady said that?\n\n29:39.520 --> 29:40.520\nAnd Sunset Boulevard?\n\n29:40.520 --> 29:41.520\nYeah.\n\n29:41.520 --> 29:42.520\nYeah.\n\n29:42.520 --> 29:43.520\nAre you ready for your close-up, Mr. DeMille?\n\n29:43.520 --> 29:46.840\nFuck, here's my pitch, you fucking put a predator in Sunset Boulevard.\n\n29:46.840 --> 29:53.880\nHey, hey, hey, the movie starts, a predator in the pool, and goes like, that's me, I tried\n\n29:53.880 --> 29:55.480\nto hunt an old starlet.\n\n29:55.480 --> 29:57.920\nBut it's all, I'm dead.\n\n29:57.920 --> 30:02.920\nIt's all a predator-language, it's all a predator-language, it's all a predator-language.\n\n30:02.920 --> 30:03.920\nHollywood is so doggie-doggy.\n\n30:03.920 --> 30:04.920\nI just wanted some candy.\n\n30:04.920 --> 30:08.760\nHollywood is so doggie-doggy that it killed the predator.\n\n30:08.760 --> 30:09.760\nHe couldn't fucking eat it.\n\n30:09.760 --> 30:10.760\nHey, stand up.\n\n30:10.760 --> 30:16.640\nI like it that the last three predator movies are expecting us to still be impressed with\n\n30:16.640 --> 30:21.160\nthermal dynamic, like, like, oh, wow, I can see the heat.\n\n30:21.160 --> 30:37.560\nThey cut you off, man, I don't blame them.\n\n30:37.560 --> 30:45.560\nWe got night vision on our, on our telephones, and we're supposed to go, oh, wow, look at\n\n30:45.560 --> 30:53.560\nthis orange and yellow and blue splotchy vision, that, he could, he could see anything.\n\n30:53.560 --> 30:58.040\nOh my God, wow, that's really impressive.\n\n30:58.040 --> 31:05.000\nBut let me get in my drone and fly to the fucking Froyo.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:07.000\nWhat the fuck are you talking about?\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:12.000\nWow, oh my God, he could see if I'm hot or cold.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:14.000\nHe could do that.\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:15.000\nAmazing.\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:16.000\nOh my God.\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:17.000\nWow, the predator.\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:18.000\nGet out of here, man.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:29.400\nI hope I don't run into an a cumbersome nine-foot dreadlocked spaceman with a harpoon arm in\n\n31:29.400 --> 31:34.720\nthis world where people can craigslist rape people by the dozens over email.\n\n31:34.720 --> 31:38.160\nI like, like, yeah, it's not, the predator is a, it's a real word.\n\n31:38.160 --> 31:42.480\nIt means it happens like, yeah, it happens like 90 times a day.\n\n31:42.480 --> 31:45.480\nYou're like, oh yeah, man.\n\n31:45.480 --> 31:47.480\nIt's an awful world.\n\n31:47.480 --> 31:53.400\nIt's like, wow, how many people that you could interview from last week, if you could round\n\n31:53.400 --> 31:57.920\nup souls that went out in a certain way, like, hey, would you trade the way you went out\n\n31:57.920 --> 32:01.000\nfor just a run with the predator hunting you?\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:02.000\nFuck yeah.\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:03.000\nWhat the fuck happened to me?\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:04.000\nI was walking out of a 7-Eleven.\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:07.000\nI got shot because my hat's wrong.\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:09.000\nHere's the thing.\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:14.600\nIt's like, they go, okay, so, the predator, no, no, get ready, though.\n\n32:14.600 --> 32:15.600\nGet ready.\n\n32:15.600 --> 32:23.240\nSo the predator is like, oh, well, you know, he's invisible, and stop there.\n\n32:23.240 --> 32:24.240\nHe's invisible.\n\n32:24.240 --> 32:25.240\nThat's all he could do.\n\n32:25.240 --> 32:26.240\nIt's a huge power.\n\n32:26.240 --> 32:31.120\nBut he could see you in spotty orange and yellow spotches, and he's got a knife that\n\n32:31.120 --> 32:32.120\ngoes really fast.\n\n32:32.120 --> 32:33.120\nWhat does he do?\n\n32:33.120 --> 32:34.120\nWhat does he do with the invisible?\n\n32:34.120 --> 32:38.840\nWhen he's not invisible, when predator is just being predator up on a tree, does he\n\n32:38.840 --> 32:42.400\nstill see you as spotty orange and yellow on blues, or does he see you regular?\n\n32:42.400 --> 32:43.400\nHe can switch.\n\n32:43.400 --> 32:44.400\nHe switches.\n\n32:44.400 --> 32:46.120\nHe can switch between things.\n\n32:46.120 --> 32:49.320\nThey celebrate that in the movie, end of the video games, and it's like, oh, he can switch.\n\n32:49.320 --> 32:51.520\nHe could choose to see heat.\n\n32:51.520 --> 32:54.800\nHe could choose to see, like, fear, I don't know.\n\n32:54.800 --> 32:59.160\nBut the important thing is, the guy is like, fear would make it make, would be another\n\n32:59.160 --> 33:00.680\nlayer or something like that.\n\n33:00.680 --> 33:05.720\nHe just like, thermal dynamics, no shit, my kid's got a toy that can do that.\n\n33:05.720 --> 33:08.560\nBut give me something, give me, give me ideas, man.\n\n33:08.560 --> 33:12.680\nHere's the craziest thing to me, here's the thing that bumps me the most.\n\n33:12.680 --> 33:17.000\nI believe you and I saw Predator 2 in the theater, that's how old we are, and how long\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:19.240\nthis friendship has been failing.\n\n33:19.240 --> 33:27.080\nLike, I don't know, let's give it one more decade, when we saw Predator 2, and I was\n\n33:27.080 --> 33:33.960\nlike, so we were there when Danny Glover looked at him and said, fuck you, pussy face.\n\n33:33.960 --> 33:37.400\nAnd the crowd went, wow, I never thought about that.\n\n33:37.400 --> 33:41.320\nIt looks like a pussy.\n\n33:41.320 --> 33:45.840\nAnd then, and then, and then, Danny Glover's at number two?\n\n33:45.840 --> 33:48.400\nYeah, and he calls them pussy face?\n\n33:48.400 --> 33:53.320\nYes, and the first Predator, of course we know that in the first Predator, why did you\n\n33:53.320 --> 33:55.600\nthink the movie was about?\n\n33:55.600 --> 33:59.160\nI never saw, I never saw the second one.\n\n33:59.160 --> 34:04.560\nI thought at the end of Arnold Schwarzenegger, you are one ugly son of a bitch.\n\n34:04.560 --> 34:06.240\nYeah, that's what happens in the first movie.\n\n34:06.240 --> 34:09.120\nSo then they made a second one, and then they doubled down on it, and he called them pussy\n\n34:09.120 --> 34:10.120\nface.\n\n34:10.120 --> 34:11.120\nPussy face.\n\n34:11.120 --> 34:12.120\nPussy face.\n\n34:12.120 --> 34:13.120\nSo, so that's the thing is they keep.\n\n34:13.120 --> 34:17.320\nNumber, Predator 2 is the reason why we have aliens versus Predator, because they go,\n\n34:17.320 --> 34:21.720\nDanny Glover goes on the spaceship, and we see, they threw like a, he goes on the spaceship,\n\n34:21.720 --> 34:26.920\nand there's more Predators, and they combine this moment of like, like, Danny Glover goes\n\n34:26.920 --> 34:33.960\nlike, I fucking, I got you, I beat you, and then multiple Predators come out of the fog.\n\n34:33.960 --> 34:35.360\nHe's on the mothership.\n\n34:35.360 --> 34:41.920\nYou think, it's just like, oh, I tracked this rich douchebag back to his Lexus, right, like,\n\n34:41.920 --> 34:50.800\nbut then, no, you tracked this rich douchebag back to his, his dealership, no, no, you're\n\n34:50.800 --> 34:55.480\njust connecting dot, you're just trying to be, it doesn't make any sense.\n\n34:55.480 --> 34:59.560\nIf you were immersed in what I'm saying, you wouldn't be trying to take shots at me by\n\n34:59.560 --> 35:01.280\nchanging Lexus to Tesla.\n\n35:01.280 --> 35:02.280\nThat's lateral.\n\n35:02.280 --> 35:04.800\nIt would be Winnebago would be the answer.\n\n35:04.800 --> 35:09.880\nYou reactive fuck, you're just trying to affect me, you're just, oh, there's the moon, can\n\n35:09.880 --> 35:10.880\nI hit it with a slingshot?\n\n35:10.880 --> 35:15.440\nYes, you can, you can hit anything, you're a human being, now what are you going to do\n\n35:15.440 --> 35:16.440\nwith that power?\n\n35:16.440 --> 35:21.920\nHow does it, what, I can't hear you, it's not about you, the show's not about you, that's\n\n35:21.920 --> 35:27.720\nwhy there's no microphone in front of you, there's no, there's nothing, it's not about\n\n35:27.720 --> 35:34.600\nthe show, can't be about you, it's barely about me, and it's my name, I can't even control\n\n35:34.600 --> 35:43.360\nit and I'm up here, these are my friends, look what's happening to me up here, did you\n\n35:43.360 --> 35:51.360\nperceive me as not challenged enough, did you want to throw me out of my comfort zone,\n\n35:51.360 --> 35:59.360\noh, he's not having a hard enough time, he doesn't know what to do up there, or he's\n\n35:59.360 --> 36:16.720\ntoo on rails, this is too scripted, I want to see what happened, the lights are changing,\n\n36:16.720 --> 36:22.200\nthe colors are changing.\n\n36:22.200 --> 36:29.080\nAll right, so, so, Danny Gleber, tracks again, he thought he tracked the rich juice bag back\n\n36:29.080 --> 36:40.720\nto his Lexus, he like impales him, I got him, turns out it's a Winnebago, because the dot\n\n36:40.720 --> 36:44.680\nyou should have fucking connected is that there's more predators, but you didn't see\n\n36:44.680 --> 36:55.680\npredator too, because you're 18, and that's not a strength, CNN makes you feel like that\n\n36:55.680 --> 37:02.480\nmakes you powerful, all it means is that you're going to die later than me, big deal, just\n\n37:02.480 --> 37:06.400\nmeans you're going to get an iceberg and melt it in your head, when the Emmys don't\n\n37:06.400 --> 37:12.320\ngive you a sandwich, this is how it all, I'm glad I'm going to die before you, good luck\n\n37:12.320 --> 37:20.720\nwith your molten planet, good luck trying to figure out how to eat rotten corn, I'm\n\n37:20.720 --> 37:27.920\nhappy, because you were mean to me, enjoy your hydroponic rotten corn, are you ashamed\n\n37:27.920 --> 37:34.200\nof having a Tesla, this is what it sounds like, he said Tesla, and Elon Musk has turned\n\n37:34.200 --> 37:40.440\nout to be a fucking, don't finish that sentence, I love him, he's my best friend, he's a great\n\n37:40.440 --> 37:48.840\nguy, fuck you, can I finish the goddamn, the podcast should be called, can Dan Harmon\n\n37:48.840 --> 38:01.080\nget through a fucking thought, Caleb, 21 years old, this poor guy has officially, because\n\n38:01.080 --> 38:06.080\nhe said, listen to all the episodes, he's 21, that means he spent 5% of his life listening\n\n38:06.080 --> 38:12.760\nto this shit, he had to get through 300 plus episodes of this, he's wasted an actual measurable\n\n38:12.760 --> 38:17.440\npercentage of his young life listening to us, Caleb, you don't have to verify this, I don't\n\n38:17.440 --> 38:22.520\nwant you to get drawn into this, but I think the irony is, and I know you're thinking it\n\n38:22.520 --> 38:27.840\ntoo, this show started as me going, hey, don't let me go off on a tangent, oh, it's so funny\n\n38:27.840 --> 38:31.720\nbecause, oh, Dan Harmon's stream of consciousness, does it for it to evolve to the point where\n\n38:31.720 --> 38:37.960\nI'm just like, can I fucking talk for a second without everyone attacking me? It's ironic,\n\n38:37.960 --> 38:38.960\nI know you agree.\n\n38:38.960 --> 38:50.040\nI think the show does suffer from you not getting a platform, so anyways, he thought\n\n38:50.040 --> 38:57.200\nhe chased him back to the Lexus, he fucking called it pussyface, he chases him back to\n\n38:57.200 --> 39:03.920\nthe fucking predator ship, he kills the predator, and then he goes, I killed you pussyface,\n\n39:03.920 --> 39:14.920\nand then he looks around and through the fog, seven predators, and you're like, oh, shit,\n\n39:14.920 --> 39:22.640\nhe's so fucked, he just spent the whole movie dealing with one predator, and the first movie\n\n39:22.640 --> 39:28.280\nwas one predator, the only thing we changed, we didn't go straight multiple predators at\n\n39:28.280 --> 39:33.800\nthe top of the second movie, like James Cameron style, it was like, predator changed the location\n\n39:33.800 --> 39:41.560\nto near future Los Angeles, so then he's like, I got you, I killed you, and then, wah, wah,\n\n39:41.560 --> 39:46.040\nmultiple predators, and you're like, fuck, god damn it, we're really fucked, and then\n\n39:46.040 --> 39:51.120\nthe lead predator walks up to him, and goes, how do you tell which one's the lead predator?\n\n39:51.120 --> 39:56.000\nHe's in front, he's got choreography as you can tell, like blocking, the director told\n\n39:56.000 --> 40:03.920\nhim you should talk to your actor, Mr. Glover, Bob Fosse, he's good, yeah, and it basically,\n\n40:03.920 --> 40:18.680\nit goes like, Jeff's dancing, they like appraise him, they go, huh, looks like this prey came\n\n40:18.680 --> 40:28.600\non board our ship that we use to be predators, to predate, and it looks like he's gotten\n\n40:28.600 --> 40:37.160\nthe better of one of our predator colleagues, and they react, of course, because this is\n\n40:37.160 --> 40:43.120\nwhat all of us would do, if you were dolphin hunting, that's what hunters do, you really\n\n40:43.120 --> 40:47.200\nhunt because you have so much respect for a deer, that if a deer killed your best friend,\n\n40:47.200 --> 40:51.720\nyou'd be like, you're gonna come to my wedding.\n\n40:51.720 --> 40:56.520\nThat's what that means when you see antlers on a wall, it means like, I got him, and like,\n\n40:56.520 --> 41:01.480\nif I hadn't gotten him, I would have fucking honored him for the rest of his life, no,\n\n41:01.480 --> 41:06.840\nI got him, he's weak, he's on my wall, that's how I, like, but the predators are like, oh,\n\n41:06.840 --> 41:11.520\nyou killed a predator, he's fucking bodies on the floor of our car, you're a human,\n\n41:11.520 --> 41:18.360\nwe come here to hunt, by the way, what the fuck are those guys doing that whole weekend?\n\n41:18.360 --> 41:24.320\nIs one of them in San Francisco, like, do they split up, like, I'm gonna be in Seattle?\n\n41:24.320 --> 41:29.360\nThese are all great questions that would have been a really interesting third predator movie.\n\n41:29.360 --> 41:35.880\nBut instead, in case I'm being obtuse about this, but I think you can predict, like, there's\n\n41:35.880 --> 41:40.280\na mislead of, oh, I'm fucked, and then they like, what do they do, they give them a predator\n\n41:40.280 --> 41:41.280\nweapon.\n\n41:41.280 --> 41:45.640\nYeah, they give them, like, an antique, like, American weapon, or whatever, from the Civil\n\n41:45.640 --> 41:46.640\nWar.\n\n41:46.640 --> 41:50.720\nOh, that's even worse, that's so much worse, saying like, they've been doing this for a\n\n41:50.720 --> 41:51.720\nlong time.\n\n41:51.720 --> 41:55.600\nIt's like, you know, the last time we got our asses kicked is when the fucking Confederate\n\n41:55.600 --> 41:57.600\nSlag had the balls.\n\n41:57.600 --> 42:00.400\nI didn't read it, that is what you're reading, when I preside.\n\n42:00.400 --> 42:03.120\nWell, I didn't read it until you said that, because I was like, holy shit.\n\n42:03.120 --> 42:07.400\nNo, no, no, I'm not reading like him, him like going, hey, we fought a good fight, here's\n\n42:07.400 --> 42:09.000\nsomething for your trouble.\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:13.520\nI thought he was like going, yeah, Eric was a dick.\n\n42:13.520 --> 42:21.080\nWell, what's the difference between those two, isn't that the same thing?\n\n42:21.080 --> 42:26.800\nYou're like saying, like, oh, it's an honorable thing, like, you know, even though we're enemies,\n\n42:26.800 --> 42:32.880\nI can respect you, here's something for your trouble, thank you for your, it's a sport.\n\n42:32.880 --> 42:35.520\nYou wouldn't extend to someone if Eric wasn't a dick.\n\n42:35.520 --> 42:38.480\nI mean, they clearly hate the fucking predator, I mean, that much is clear, yeah.\n\n42:38.480 --> 42:39.480\nAnd we're both right.\n\n42:39.480 --> 42:45.280\nYeah, but the bottom line is they don't fucking kill them, they're just like, you know what,\n\n42:45.280 --> 42:46.880\nwe're fucking cool like that.\n\n42:46.880 --> 42:54.840\nWe come here, we hunt you, we turn invisible, we come here in a spaceship, we hunt you invisibly.\n\n42:54.840 --> 43:00.640\nWe hang out in the spaceship invisible, that's how much we like being invisible, it's like,\n\n43:00.640 --> 43:10.320\nhey, it's your shit, it's your shit, it's your fucking shit, and they're like, they're\n\n43:10.320 --> 43:16.160\nlike brawl, and they're like just making eggs and watching TV, Danny Glover walks in\n\n43:16.160 --> 43:26.200\nand they're like, why are they invisible and they're shit, why, I've never, it's been\n\n43:26.200 --> 43:28.280\n25 years, I've never asked that.\n\n43:28.280 --> 43:30.600\nAre you seeing this?\n\n43:30.600 --> 43:32.800\nI'm not seeing you, who's saying that?\n\n43:32.800 --> 43:38.200\nI mean, the explanation that might be that they're in the predator man cave and they're\n\n43:38.200 --> 43:43.040\nwatching, also I don't want to now give it through a modern lens because predators are\n\n43:43.040 --> 43:47.200\nanything if not androgynous, you know, like we don't even know some of these predators,\n\n43:47.200 --> 43:52.920\nwe shouldn't keep calling them he, but they're solely defined by their love of hunting, like\n\n43:52.920 --> 43:54.960\nwe don't know if they're sexual or not.\n\n43:54.960 --> 43:59.520\nBut they're in a, in a, in a, in a person cave and they're watching security cameras\n\n43:59.520 --> 44:03.840\nand they say, this is fucking guy, can you believe it, they go, Tony, I told you to close\n\n44:03.840 --> 44:08.840\nthe fucking predator door on the ship that we parked in this mining tunnel outside of\n\n44:08.840 --> 44:10.840\nLos Angeles in 1997.\n\n44:10.840 --> 44:12.320\nWell, you don't pick up your shoes.\n\n44:12.320 --> 44:16.320\nYeah, I was like, you told me, you said, is it Cliff's coming back, he's going to hunt\n\n44:16.320 --> 44:22.960\na cast of nine, including Maria Conchino Alonso and Bill Paxton, and then we're going to\n\n44:22.960 --> 44:26.120\nfucking take off and you said, because he's a douchebag, I don't want to fucking like\n\n44:26.120 --> 44:27.720\nwake up and get the door for him.\n\n44:27.720 --> 44:32.080\nI'm like, yeah, but okay, now there's a fucking dude, there's an LA cop in our ship.\n\n44:32.080 --> 44:33.720\nHe's looking at our trophy room.\n\n44:33.720 --> 44:36.720\nAll right, well, let's go fucking, and then they turn invisible.\n\n44:36.720 --> 44:41.400\nThey're like, let's go check it out and they're like, and they all go and then he's like finishing\n\n44:41.400 --> 44:44.080\nkilling Eric and they're like, this dude's killing Eric.\n\n44:44.080 --> 44:45.080\nYeah.\n\n44:45.080 --> 44:52.320\nI was like, all right, let's fucking bring it on and they're like, look, don't speak\n\n44:52.320 --> 44:56.960\nEnglish, certainly not going to self-destruct.\n\n44:56.960 --> 44:59.240\nBasically we're pussies.\n\n44:59.240 --> 45:03.040\nPredators are fucking, they're terrible.\n\n45:03.040 --> 45:14.720\nThis idea that they're badass is not, they're bullies, and then when they die, they blow\n\n45:14.720 --> 45:19.280\nthemselves up and then this idea that we were going to get off on watching them fight aliens\n\n45:19.280 --> 45:25.800\nwas like, I thought was absurd.\n\n45:25.800 --> 45:26.800\nYou like aliens.\n\n45:26.800 --> 45:29.920\nYeah, I like aliens, but I mean, I don't like aliens.\n\n45:29.920 --> 45:34.320\nI like Sigourney Weaver, I like humans, I like humans.\n\n45:34.320 --> 45:35.320\nThat's why I like aliens.\n\n45:35.320 --> 45:38.480\nYeah, but you like aliens, I mean, movies are the aliens.\n\n45:38.480 --> 45:42.240\nYeah, well, that's the expensive part of the movie you're making, but it's about people.\n\n45:42.240 --> 45:46.800\nIt's like saying if I read the old man in the sea that I like water, you can't just make\n\n45:46.800 --> 45:51.840\na book about water, I was like, oh, and it sloshed and it slipped and then it was hard\n\n45:51.840 --> 45:54.800\nto drink and it gave you diarrhea and I'm like, yeah, get on with it.\n\n45:54.800 --> 45:55.800\nWhere's the people?\n\n45:55.800 --> 46:01.360\nThis is about the unknown, like you can't just be like Freddie versus Jason, I don't care.\n\n46:01.360 --> 46:06.280\nOh, Jason had a nightmare, are you fucking kidding me?\n\n46:06.280 --> 46:13.240\nNext to LACC, where you guys shot Community, there's a bra, like lingerie shop called Jeanette's\n\n46:13.240 --> 46:18.560\nBras and it's Jeanette, what's her last name in church?\n\n46:18.560 --> 46:29.040\nShe's Vasquez from Aliens, she's the cool Latino, like hardcore Marine and now she sells\n\n46:29.040 --> 46:32.800\npanties and bras and she's fucking awesome.\n\n46:32.800 --> 46:35.960\nThat's how I'm going out.\n\n46:35.960 --> 46:41.480\nBill Paxton in Predator 2 and Aliens 2.\n\n46:41.480 --> 46:42.480\nRight?\n\n46:42.480 --> 46:48.240\nIt's actually just called Aliens, it's not called Aliens 2.\n\n46:48.240 --> 46:54.640\nFirst one was called Alien, not Aliens 1, second one was called Aliens, not Aliens 2.\n\n46:54.640 --> 47:00.880\nSo you didn't know what I meant, that's why you're so confused, you didn't know what I\n\n47:00.880 --> 47:01.880\nmeant.\n\n47:01.880 --> 47:06.720\nFucking Schrabbed, I Schrabbed you.\n\n47:06.720 --> 47:08.480\nYou fucking put a mirror up.\n\n47:08.480 --> 47:10.440\nYou've been doing that for 20 years.\n\n47:10.440 --> 47:13.400\nI guess you didn't know what I meant.\n\n47:13.400 --> 47:15.760\nIf you knew how to correct me, then you knew what I meant.\n\n47:15.760 --> 47:16.760\nSo why correct me?\n\n47:16.760 --> 47:20.840\nBecause it's a society, trying to stitch it together.\n\n47:20.840 --> 47:23.400\nIt's just you and me, man.\n\n47:23.400 --> 47:28.960\nWhat circumstances do the predators uncloke in the movie?\n\n47:28.960 --> 47:33.440\nBecause what if they cloak as clothes, that's just clothes to them, is cloaking because\n\n47:33.440 --> 47:35.600\nthey can see the color.\n\n47:35.600 --> 47:39.960\nI always project into it that it probably is harder for them to see while they're cloaked\n\n47:39.960 --> 47:41.880\nbecause otherwise why would they ever unclove?\n\n47:41.880 --> 47:42.880\nYou know what it's also harder?\n\n47:42.880 --> 47:44.560\nBecause clothes, they'll be flashing people.\n\n47:44.560 --> 47:47.200\nYou know what it's also hard for a predator to do?\n\n47:47.200 --> 47:50.880\nPick up little tiny things with their long, claw-y fingers.\n\n47:50.880 --> 47:57.520\nRemember the first one where he's trying to repair his leg, and they do a close-up of\n\n47:57.520 --> 48:04.880\nhim picking up stuff, and he does that kind of mom picking up a pencil, and he's like,\n\n48:04.880 --> 48:08.520\noh shit, and it looks like you.\n\n48:08.520 --> 48:13.040\nIt's very hard to see somebody if they get mud on them.\n\n48:13.040 --> 48:17.920\nThe source-maker gets a little mud on them, and we're supposed to buy that.\n\n48:17.920 --> 48:21.400\nYou can turn yourself invisible, but yeah, you haven't defeated the mud.\n\n48:21.400 --> 48:22.640\nYeah, they should change that.\n\n48:22.640 --> 48:23.640\nMud technology.\n\n48:23.640 --> 48:24.640\nThen they'd be famous.\n\n48:24.640 --> 48:25.640\nThen they'd be famous.\n\n48:25.640 --> 48:27.640\nThen it'd be a franchise.\n\n48:27.640 --> 48:33.200\nAlso, it's my understanding, you have to get to the copter or the skin-you-alliance.\n\n48:33.200 --> 48:34.200\nRight.\n\n48:34.200 --> 48:35.200\nYeah.\n\n48:35.200 --> 48:36.200\nThe chopper.\n\n48:36.200 --> 48:39.640\nIf Jesse the body-venturer was a governor.\n\n48:39.640 --> 48:40.640\nYeah.\n\n48:40.640 --> 48:41.640\nYeah.\n\n48:41.640 --> 48:42.640\nAll right.\n\n48:42.640 --> 48:43.640\nYeah.\n\n48:43.640 --> 48:44.640\nYeah.\n\n48:44.640 --> 48:45.640\nYeah.\n\n48:45.640 --> 48:46.640\nHe fucking won.\n\n48:46.640 --> 48:47.640\nTwo governors.\n\n48:47.640 --> 48:48.640\nTwo governors in one movie.\n\n48:48.640 --> 48:51.960\nThat movie has more governors than any other action film of all time.\n\n48:51.960 --> 48:52.960\nNever thought about that.\n\n48:52.960 --> 48:58.160\nI can't

--> 49:13.480\nNot since Jerry Brown and Dianne Feinstein were in The Expendables 4.\n\n49:13.480 --> 49:14.480\nLadybugs.\n\n49:14.480 --> 49:15.480\nRight.\n\n49:15.480 --> 49:16.480\nYeah.\n\n49:16.480 --> 49:17.480\nYeah.\n\n49:17.480 --> 49:18.480\nI drive a Tesla.\n\n49:18.480 --> 49:19.480\nYeah.\n\n49:19.480 --> 49:20.480\nYeah.\n\n49:20.480 --> 49:23.480\nYou're welcome from Earth.\n\n49:23.480 --> 49:29.160\nDo you drive it or do you just wreck it?\n\n49:29.160 --> 49:30.640\nI barely drive it.\n\n49:30.640 --> 49:33.280\nThat's how fucking green I am.\n\n49:33.280 --> 49:34.400\nI barely drive it.\n\n49:34.400 --> 49:38.120\nI drive it back and forth to make an Emmy-winning show for you.\n\n49:38.120 --> 49:39.760\nIt's completely.\n\n49:39.760 --> 49:40.760\nIt's all I do.\n\n49:40.760 --> 49:42.480\nIt's practically powered by the sun.\n\n49:42.480 --> 49:43.480\nIt's powered by you.\n\n49:43.480 --> 49:44.480\nIt's elliptical.\n\n49:44.480 --> 49:45.480\nYeah.\n\n49:45.480 --> 49:46.480\nYeah.\n\n49:46.480 --> 49:47.480\nThat would be amazing.\n\n49:47.480 --> 49:48.480\nWe gotta get that set up.\n\n49:48.480 --> 49:51.360\nAs you do the elliptical in the morning it goes into like a big battery in your house\n\n49:51.360 --> 49:54.680\nand then the battery is shared by like I'm gonna make some eggs or like if you're rich\n\n49:54.680 --> 49:55.680\nyou express it through energy.\n\n49:55.680 --> 49:58.840\nYou go like hey guys it's Thanksgiving come to my house because I have so many people\n\n49:58.840 --> 49:59.840\nworking for me.\n\n49:59.840 --> 50:00.840\nI'm always siphoning energy off of them.\n\n50:00.840 --> 50:05.120\nI've got a big like power wall in my house and then you like give the energy away.\n\n50:05.120 --> 50:12.360\nYou go like here, here, desalinate some ocean water neighbor here like here's a birth control\n\n50:12.360 --> 50:17.240\nfor you like everything like energy can be turned into anything and then like so rich\n\n50:17.240 --> 50:21.960\npeople just have these head pieces and they like they have gemstones in them based on\n\n50:21.960 --> 50:28.560\nlike how much you contribute to society.\n\n50:28.560 --> 50:34.200\nEverybody gets a little Thanos gauntlet at birth and then I like you know you know how\n\n50:34.200 --> 50:35.200\nit goes.\n\n50:35.200 --> 50:36.560\nLike I think we all know it then.\n\n50:36.560 --> 50:39.480\nYou know how it goes.\n\n50:39.480 --> 50:44.080\nAt the beginning of the universe you know and this tracks at the beginning of the universe\n\n50:44.080 --> 50:48.160\nlike everything you know nothing is split into everything you know and then and then\n\n50:48.160 --> 50:49.160\nthey were like these gems.\n\n50:49.160 --> 51:03.640\nYou know the list is what you would imagine, power, time, soul, energy, what the fuck?\n\n51:03.640 --> 51:05.840\nI was like a third of the way through that list.\n\n51:05.840 --> 51:07.600\nThey have power and energy.\n\n51:07.600 --> 51:08.600\nYeah.\n\n51:08.600 --> 51:09.600\nOh okay.\n\n51:09.600 --> 51:10.600\nAnd don't forget soul.\n\n51:10.600 --> 51:11.600\nWhat the fuck with these gems?\n\n51:11.600 --> 51:12.600\nJesus Christ.\n\n51:12.600 --> 51:13.600\nSo there's only four knuckles?\n\n51:13.600 --> 51:14.600\nWhat?\n\n51:14.600 --> 51:15.600\nI don't know.\n\n51:15.600 --> 51:18.480\nI was really disappointed in Thanos' gauntlet.\n\n51:18.480 --> 51:20.520\nI really wanted it to be more comprehensive.\n\n51:20.520 --> 51:23.960\nLike you don't have to make each thing part of someone's costume from a previous movie.\n\n51:23.960 --> 51:28.280\nI think you could just say, just say gem one, gem two.\n\n51:28.280 --> 51:31.440\nBut show me that you're 20% more powerful when you get it.\n\n51:31.440 --> 51:34.920\nLike you could beat up the Hulk with the first gem.\n\n51:34.920 --> 51:36.480\nThat just okay.\n\n51:36.480 --> 51:41.440\nTo me that's what I was defining coming into the movie is like you pretty much you've peaked.\n\n51:41.440 --> 51:44.480\nYou just you just you just put a put a hurt on the Hulk.\n\n51:44.480 --> 51:50.480\nJust beat his ass like he's a fucking like drunk at a bar like you just beat him up through\n\n51:50.480 --> 51:51.480\nhim into space.\n\n51:51.480 --> 51:56.200\nAnd then he's like I gotta get the rest of those gems why so I can kill exactly half\n\n51:56.200 --> 51:57.200\nof the people.\n\n51:57.200 --> 51:59.480\nI don't even want to talk about it.\n\n51:59.480 --> 52:00.480\nCan't wait.\n\n52:00.480 --> 52:01.480\nI can't wait to see the sequel.\n\n52:01.480 --> 52:04.840\nYou know it'd be a better movie if he's getting the gems but he's just he's just punching\n\n52:04.840 --> 52:07.480\npeople to death as he goes.\n\n52:07.480 --> 52:11.440\nHe's just like I'm gonna punch out half of the world.\n\n52:11.440 --> 52:16.880\nAnd they're like we got a study he's like punched out 60,000 people.\n\n52:16.880 --> 52:23.040\nHe punches a lot for a guy who if he closes his fist can make your grandma into a newspaper.\n\n52:23.040 --> 52:29.720\nLike he's like he's doing a lot of fucking Tai Chi considering that I would I guess I'm\n\n52:29.720 --> 52:30.920\na lazy supervillain.\n\n52:30.920 --> 52:37.840\nI would just be like so I can okay I got the green one from Dr. Strange.\n\n52:37.840 --> 52:42.640\nSo now from now on then everything reverse all of it quick save and then redo.\n\n52:42.640 --> 52:43.640\nYeah.\n\n52:43.640 --> 52:49.840\nWell that actually is Thanos' main weakness is that he always makes himself lose.\n\n52:49.840 --> 52:54.800\nSo that's just another one of those things he does.\n\n52:54.800 --> 52:56.000\nThat's his one weakness.\n\n52:56.000 --> 53:02.080\nHe's unbeatable except that he makes himself lose.\n\n53:02.080 --> 53:03.080\nThat's one of his things.\n\n53:03.080 --> 53:04.480\nDoes it say that on his?\n\n53:04.480 --> 53:05.480\nIt says it on his card.\n\n53:05.480 --> 53:10.000\nYeah on his baseball card.\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:13.920\nI just don't yeah he on his planet he had an idea.\n\n53:13.920 --> 53:16.160\nEveryone was like god damn it there's not enough food.\n\n53:16.160 --> 53:17.160\nSo many people.\n\n53:17.160 --> 53:21.600\nAnd he's like look I've been saying it forever.\n\n53:21.600 --> 53:23.920\nShe killed half of the people.\n\n53:23.920 --> 53:28.840\nOkay Thanos we've heard you the first time like we're brainstorming here.\n\n53:28.840 --> 53:34.800\nAnd while technically that means no wrong answers fucking heard we heard you.\n\n53:34.800 --> 53:37.560\nAnd it's going on the shit list.\n\n53:37.560 --> 53:38.560\nWe can beat it.\n\n53:38.560 --> 53:39.560\nI hope.\n\n53:39.560 --> 53:44.200\nOh you know you're going to regret this one.\n\n53:44.200 --> 53:48.080\nWhat did you where did you go is a way we're having another board meeting where's Thanos.\n\n53:48.080 --> 53:52.640\nHe laughed he went he joined the cosmos he said he's going to do that thing that he wanted\n\n53:52.640 --> 53:54.240\nto do here everywhere.\n\n53:54.240 --> 53:57.240\nWell great great.\n\n53:57.240 --> 53:58.240\nThat really helps.\n\n53:58.240 --> 54:02.280\nHe said he said you guys don't believe in him I never said I don't believe you could\n\n54:02.280 --> 54:03.280\ndo that.\n\n54:03.280 --> 54:07.120\nHe said it's a terrible idea.\n\n54:07.120 --> 54:12.320\nWhy is he so offended by the idea what someone's saying that that's a bad idea that he's going\n\n54:12.320 --> 54:14.000\nto go make it happen.\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:21.200\nPut that much energy into making twice as much food how go to snap my fingers and everyone\n\n54:21.200 --> 54:24.560\nwill have corn on the cob.\n\n54:24.560 --> 54:26.880\nIt's an equally valid solution.\n\n54:26.880 --> 54:27.880\nYou haven't seen it.\n\n54:27.880 --> 54:33.200\nIt's I haven't either what a what a what a you know you know are we what are you talking\n\n54:33.200 --> 54:34.200\nabout.\n\n54:34.200 --> 54:40.200\nIt's it's it's Thanos it's this guy Thanos is a real B in my body wars his evil plan\n\n54:40.200 --> 54:44.680\nit's just it's hard to access for me.\n\n54:44.680 --> 54:47.880\nI'm going to watch I'm going to do this and then I'm going to watch the sunset on the\n\n54:47.880 --> 54:48.880\nuniverse.\n\n54:48.880 --> 54:56.320\nWhat do you do you know anything about the universe or sons or setting I'm getting nervous\n\n54:56.320 --> 54:59.920\nbecause you're saying this stuff and you're wielding this power and you just said you're\n\n54:59.920 --> 55:02.840\ngoing to watch the sunset on a grateful universe.\n\n55:02.840 --> 55:07.120\nI want you to understand but it could be the solution could be me explaining to you how\n\n55:07.120 --> 55:09.960\nmany people are in the universe.\n\n55:09.960 --> 55:14.480\nI think you might think it's like Rhode Island and you're like you just wanted to sell more\n\n55:14.480 --> 55:19.160\nshoes and like we just it could this could be a matter of perception.\n\n55:19.160 --> 55:25.320\nSo has anyone tried talking to this guy.\n\n55:25.320 --> 55:27.320\nWhy are Ron Perman's hands so soft?\n\n55:27.320 --> 55:28.800\nThis is my

Davis.\n\n01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.600\nHe's a fucking douchebag.\n\n01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:28.600\nWhenever anyone shakes hands with Ron,\n\n01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.600\ndo you mind me speaking for you?\n\n01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.600\nWhenever anyone shakes hands with him,\n\n01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.600\nthey're so taken aback by the gentleness\n\n01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.600\nand then they want to go tell it on the mountain\n\n01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.600\nand it's like it takes on this heat\n\n01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.600\nthat Ron's natural ruggedness doesn't take on\n\n01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.600\nbecause that's the mainstay.\n\n01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.600\nSo he exists as a creature of pure irony\n\n01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.600\nand I don't think that's fair to Ron.\n\n01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:50.600\nIt's like we skip the meat and potatoes\n\n01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:55.600\nof him being basically a real-life Paul Bunyan.\n\n01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:59.600\nYou're a really good girlfriend.\n\n01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.600\nLook, it's no secret that I'm Gannis Ron's manager.\n\n01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:03.600\nAre you married?\n\n01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:06.600\nI'm Rhea Perlman.\n\n01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.600\nYou're Rhea Perlman?\n\n01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:11.600\nShe's my ex-girlfriend.\n\n01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:12.600\nBecause I married her.\n\n01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:14.600\nWell, this got complicated.\n\n01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.600\nGildy, Gildy Rhea.\n\n01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.600\nSorry, you called me Gildy Rhea.\n\n01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.600\nGildy, Gildy Rhea.\n\n01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:23.600\nIt's fine, yes.\n\n01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.600\nGildy Rhea.\n\n01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.600\nForget the continuity.\n\n01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.600\nForget everything.\n\n01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.600\nI didn't realize that Ron was married to Rhea Perlman\n\n01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.600\nfrom Cheers.\n\n01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:30.600\nI didn't know that.\n\n01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:31.600\nYeah.\n\n01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.600\nI call her Gildy.\n\n01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.600\nOkay, we're past that.\n\n01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:37.600\nI'm his manager.\n\n01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.600\nDo you guys, like, do you guys...\n\n01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.600\nFuck, yeah.\n\n01:01:40.600 -->

it.\n\n01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:47.600\nOkay.\n\n01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.600\nOkay.\n\n01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:49.600\nHere we go.\n\n01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.600\nThere's a reason you're on the ceiling.\n\n01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.600\nWhy don't you guys fuck in front of me so I can...\n\n01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:53.600\nCan we put you...\n\n01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:58.600\nYou guys can watch yourselves fuck me.\n\n01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.600\nYou're my reflection.\n\n01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:04.600\nOkay, well, we've got about 10 minutes before the Grubhub shows up,\n\n01:02:04.600 -->

the question, who's initiating?\n\n01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.600\nBut yes, you should.\n\n01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.600\nAll right.\n\n01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:24.600\nI'm going to take off my

I'm also a victim of everything.\n\n01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:41.400\nAnd it's not easy to balance those worlds.\n\n01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.400\nI think you're killing it.\n\n01:06:43.400 -->

01:06:58.400\nI mean, does it matter?\n\n01:06:58.400 --> 01:06:59.400\nWho cares?\n\n01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:00.400\nWhy would you ask that question?\n\n01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:01.400\nCome on.\n\n01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:03.400\nWell, why not ask it?\n\n01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:04.400\nWho cares?\n\n01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.400\nWhy, why does it matter?\n\n01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:07.400\nIt's 9-11.\n\n01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:13.400\nSee, it was only 10 seconds until your next scandal.\n\n01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:14.400\nExactly.\n\n01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.400\nIt's just 9-0-9.\n\n01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:17.400\nSteve Levy's top five championships.\n\n01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.400\nWhat?\n\n01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:19.400\nAll these are chaps.\n\n01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:20.400\nAll these are chaps.\n\n01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.400\nThey added taps tonight.\n\n01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:22.400\nYeah.\n\n01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:25.400\nI think, well, I think it's a combination of things.\n\n01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:29.400\nWe moved into this theater space so we can't normally hear the people.\n\n01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:34.400\nSo, like, whereas Norm was, we used to have this thing at Meltdown where it's like, you\n\n01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.400\ncould hear everybody if they cleared their throat.\n\n01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:40.400\nAnd so it'd be like somebody, we'd go like, I'm going to talk about dolphins and then\n\n01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.400\nsomebody would be like, that's not true.\n\n01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:43.400\nAnd it'd be like, hey, come up here.\n\n01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:47.400\nAnd then it's like, and then we moved here and it's like a theater so it's not designed\n\n01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:48.400\nfor that.\n\n01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:53.400\nI don't know what's happening is like this Darwinian mutation of like, like super asses.\n\n01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:56.400\nLike, like, like, like, God damn it.\n\n01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:59.400\nI've said shit under my breath like 90 times.\n\n01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:04.400\nIt's like, if you don't take all your antibiotics, you create like a fucking flu monster.\n\n01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:08.400\nSo now you just have three people going like, God damn it!\n\n01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:09.400\nGo-Bots!\n\n01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:10.400\nGo-Bots!\n\n01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:13.400\nMy name is Paul Davidson.\n\n01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.400\nI'm from Minnesota.\n\n01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:18.400\nTalk about Go-Bots!\n\n01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:23.400\nI'm happy to come up if you want!\n\n01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:27.400\nI think it's exactly, I think it's just like Latter Day, Adam Goldberg, because I just\n\n01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:29.400\nwant to just like barge the way on stage.\n\n01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:31.400\nBut what's the alternative?\n\n01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:33.400\nHey, keep it down.\n\n01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:35.400\nThere's a show going on up here.\n\n01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:36.400\nI can't say that.\n\n01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:38.400\nI'm on their side.\n\n01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:39.400\nThis is a fucking shit show.\n\n01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:41.400\nI'd heckle it too.\n\n01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:45.400\nIf I was sitting out there, I'd be like, can I come up?\n\n01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:46.400\nIt's garbage up here.\n\n01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:48.400\nA bunch of jackasses.\n\n01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:49.400\nI've got eyeballs up.\n\n01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:51.400\nThere's three guys in a row that have the same beard.\n\n01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:55.400\nThere's like a weird kind of three musketeers thing happening over here.\n\n01:08:55.400 --> 01:09:00.400\nThat means you can only see three people because our whole audience has the same beard.\n\n01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:02.400\nIt's these guys.\n\n01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:04.400\nWe can't understand you!\n\n01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:07.400\nWe can't understand you!\n\n01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:12.400\nYou have to take workshops to speak to other people.\n\n01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:14.400\nIt takes things.\n\n01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:15.400\nIt takes architecture.\n\n01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:17.400\nIt takes training.\n\n01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:20.400\nYou have to project.\n\n01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:23.400\nI can't understand you!\n\n01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:25.400\nYou don't know timing either.\n\n01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:28.400\nNo one will ever understand what you're saying.\n\n01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:30.400\nI don't even think understanding is the problem.\n\n01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:36.400\nI think if we understood him, then there'd just be a whole host of new problems.\n\n01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:39.400\nI know that.\n\n01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:42.400\nI know that for sure.\n\n01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:48.400\nBut the fact that there's a membrane there where it's just like, I can't even...\n\n01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:52.400\nNo one can even tell what you're saying.\n\n01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.400\nShouldn't that stop you?\n\n01:09:54.400 --> 01:10:00.400\nAn animal wants to eat more grass over there.\n\n01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:07.400\nAnd then there's barbed wire that goes into their forehead and they're like...\n\n01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:13.400\nIt doesn't mean the farmer's trying to keep you from being a super cow.\n\n01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:16.400\nThis farm might love you.\n\n01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:21.400\nIt just wants you to be you and make the most milk possible.\n\n01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:26.400\nIsn't that the superest cow of all?\n\n01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:34.400\nMy dad used to heckle at church.\n\n01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.400\nSo, what's an example?\n\n01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:38.400\nThat's no good.\n\n01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.400\nHe came to Harmontown a couple of times and I would hear him yell out and stuff.\n\n01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:44.400\nAnd I'd be like, this is the fucking, this is just church round two.\n\n01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.400\nIt's so bad.\n\n01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.400\nWhat would he say in church?\n\n01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.400\nDo you remember anything like, here we go.\n\n01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:51.400\nWhat is a heckling?\n\n01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:52.400\nLike eight days.\n\n01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:55.400\nYeah, exactly like that.\n\n01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:59.400\nI'd take more of a rest if I mean that world.\n\n01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:03.400\nYeah, it's all just like, he'd be all like, oh yeah, Mark would say.\n\n01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:05.400\nAnd then he'd be like, you mean Matt?\n\n01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:07.400\nYou know, like just stupid.\n\n01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.400\nLike literally heckling church.\n\n01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:11.400\nWhat would the pastor do when he goes...\n\n01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.400\nNothing.\n\n01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:13.400\nMoving on.\n\n01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:14.400\nNo.\n\n01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.400\nIt never broke any rhythms.\n\n01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:18.400\nThere was never enough speed.\n\n01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:21.400\nThat's what she spake.\n\n01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:24.400\nThus so she spake.\n\n01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:29.400\nWhen I was 25, if I was a pastor and I had a guy like your dad in the audience,\n\n01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:32.400\nI would, or congregation would have been called the audience.\n\n01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:35.400\nThat would be my technique.\n\n01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.400\nI'd be like, hey, come on, get up here.\n\n01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:39.400\nCome on, what are you doing?\n\n01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:41.400\nWhat were you saying?\n\n01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.400\nAnd that would take care of me.\n\n01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.400\nThat's what you do here.\n\n01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:48.400\nYeah, but it's not punitive here.\n\n01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:53.400\nI've always said from the beginning as Caleb will remind us\n\n01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.400\nbecause he's had to listen to every episode.\n\n01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:58.400\nLike I from the beginning have always been like, I don't want to do that here.\n\n01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.400\nI don't want to have that relationship with the audience.\n\n01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:03.400\nI want to have like a Paula Poundstone relationship with the audience where it's like\n\n01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:07.400\nshe had her showtime show and she would like, she would just have guests\n\n01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:10.400\nand she was like a regular person and like they were regular people\n\n01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:13.400\nand like I would always be like, hey, does anybody want to come up here\n\n01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.400\nand talk to us and we won't hurt you.\n\n01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:16.400\nWe won't bully you.\n\n01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:17.400\nIt's a safe place.\n\n01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:22.400\nAnd that was coinciding with like a kind of like cultural shift in things and stuff.\n\n01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.400\nAnd I've always meant that.\n\n01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.400\nI always just wanted to have that relationship with the audience.\n\n01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:27.400\nYou piece of shit.\n\n01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:28.400\nYou fucker.\n\n01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:29.400\nI'm kidding.\n\n01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:30.400\nI'm kidding.\n\n01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:31.400\nI'm kidding.\n\n01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:35.400\nI keep making eye contact with you about the Lexus thing and I don't care.\n\n01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:36.400\nI don't really care.\n\n01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:39.400\nSo and the thing I don't, when I say I don't care,\n\n01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:42.400\nI mean you're not allowed to come up to me ever and go,\n\n01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.400\nI was that guy, now let's talk about that.\n\n01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.400\nDon't do that.\n\n01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:49.400\nThis did not make us friends, but I don't hate you.\n\n01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:50.400\nWho is the guy?\n\n01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:51.400\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.400\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:53.400\nIt's the important thing.\n\n01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.400\nIt's all been a bit.\n\n01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:55.400\nIs it your instinct?\n\n01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.400\nYes, sure.\n\n01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:59.400\nThat was the one thing like always when I was coming up.\n\n01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.400\nI was blaming the guys behind you, but it was you.\n\n01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:02.400\nWho cares?\n\n01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.400\nWhat are you going to do?\n\n01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.400\nWe don't want to.\n\n01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:06.400\nThis is not information.\n\n01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.400\nWe want to know.\n\n01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:08.400\nThis doesn't.\n\n01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:09.400\nWe don't want to.\n\n01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:10.400\nWhy do we care?\n\n01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:11.400\nYeah.\n\n01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:12.400\nWhat are we doing?\n\n01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:13.400\nBring someone up.\n\n01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:14.400\nNo.\n\n01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:15.400\nNo.\n\n01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.400\nLet's bring up Caleb for his 21st birthday.\n\n01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:27.400\nYeah.\n\n01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:31.400\nSay a guy, I couch out some, some, some, some naïve said,\n\n01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:32.400\nbring someone up.\n\n01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:36.400\nAnd that, that person, you know, who was that?\n\n01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:37.400\nWe keep.\n\n01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:43.400\nI can't stay mad at you assholes.\n\n01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:48.400\nOr maybe I can't, I can start to get mad.\n\n01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:49.400\nLike C-A-L-E-B.\n\n01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:50.400\nThat's the one.\n\n01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:51.400\nYeah.\n\n01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:52.400\nHow's it going?\n\n01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:53.400\n21 years old.\n\n01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:54.400\nThis is your 21st birthday.\n\n01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:55.400\nNot today, but just yeah.\n\n01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:56.400\nA couple of weeks ago.\n\n01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.400\nOh, okay.\n\n01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.400\nSecurity.\n\n01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:05.400\nTrying to make, trying to, trying to, like they're so.\n\n01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:06.400\nThis is my fault.\n\n01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.400\nThat's how desperate for entertainment they are.\n\n01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:09.400\nIt's not your fault.\n\n01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:11.400\nThey're like, David Goliath.\n\n01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:14.400\nI was like, no, nothing's happened.\n\n01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.400\nYeah.\n\n01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:19.400\nBut like you said, you took a, it's a solo trip you treated\n\n01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:20.400\nyourself to for your birthday.\n\n01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:21.400\nYeah.\n\n01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:23.400\nI was broke as fuck for the last year or so.\n\n01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:26.400\nAnd then I recently, I worked all summer and I just turned 21\n\n01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:27.400\nat the end of August.\n\n01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.400\nAnd so I decided now that I'm not broke as fuck,\n\n01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:33.400\nI'm going to make myself broke as fuck by going to LA.\n\n01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:36.400\nAnd now don't, don't think that you have to lie to us\n\n01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.400\nbecause actually we'd feel better if the answer is no.\n\n01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.400\nBut did you come out here just for this show?\n\n01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:43.400\nThat was like 90% of the reason I came out.\n\n01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:44.400\nYeah.\n\n01:14:44.400 -->

body,\n\n01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:31.400\nespecially at 21 and be like, yeah, I like checkers.\n\n01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:34.400\nAnd we're like, yeah, but where's your dick?\n\n01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:35.400\nShow us your dick.\n\n01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:39.400\nHow much do you like to fuck with your hard dick and jump over shit?\n\n01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:41.400\nAnd that's not fair.\n\n01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:43.400\nThat's like a weird thing.\n\n01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:45.400\nOh, I actually, I got a question.\n\n01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:50.400\nHow much do you like to fuck

vicariously through me.\n\n01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:58.400\nSee, now I'm on the heckler side.\n\n01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:00.400\nI'm going to go sit out there with you.\n\n01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:01.400\nWell, guys, I...\n\n01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.400\nSee, this is my, that's what I suspected.\n\n01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:07.400\nCaleb, what's your fantasy job?\n\n01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:11.400\nNot job, like, I don't know, like kind of like like Desert Island.\n\n01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:15.400\n250 of us were on a jet.\n\n01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:17.400\nCrashed.\n\n01:27:17.400

begrudgingly administrative position.\n\n01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.400\nWe thrust upon you.\n\n01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:33.400\nIt's just going to be like people are going to look to me like even people that weren't familiar with me before\n\n01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:35.400\nthey're going to be as they are on an airplane.\n\n01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:36.400\nIt's words going to have spread.\n\n01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:39.400\nThere's a guy in the fire, Rick and Morty, community.\n\n01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:41.400\nI don't know what that is.\n\n01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:44.400\nLike, well, yeah, well, that's not going to impress anybody once the wing flies off this fucking plane.\n\n01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:46.400\nThis guy has two non-televised Emmys.\n\n01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:47.400\nYeah.\n\n01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:50.400\nSo the first one was very televised.\n\n01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:51.400\nVery televised.\n\n01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:55.400\nI never bring it up, but my first Emmy was for writing the Oscars.\n\n01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:56.400\nThank you very much.\n\n01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:01.400\nAll right, so we crash on the island and people are like, I'm just taking myself off the plate\n\n01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:03.400\nbecause I don't want you to say, hey, are you on the plane?\n\n01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:06.400\nBecause if so, I want to give you your space.\n\n01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:07.400\nI want to leave.\n\n01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:12.400\nI want to allow you the space to claim things that maybe you think I would do.\n\n01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.400\nDo what I want and do what I think would do.\n\n01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:17.400\nI would do well.\n\n01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:18.400\nIt's like a village.\n\n01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.400\nWe're never getting rescued, ever.\n\n01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:24.400\nSo all that's going to happen is it's 200 people.\n\n01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:25.400\nWe're starting a village.\n\n01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:28.400\nAre you self-proclaimed fancy pants guy?\n\n01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:30.400\nNo, it's because he's a figure of import.\n\n01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:32.400\nI'm taking myself off the table.\n\n01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:39.400\nI didn't want him to say, well, Dan, I don't want to say that I would like to do is write amazing things\n\n01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:41.400\nthat make everyone happy every night.\n\n01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:45.400\nI don't want him to assume that that's what I'd be doing.\n\n01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.400\nI'd be so busy managing everyone.\n\n01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:49.400\nI'd be like, everyone, calm down.\n\n01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:50.400\nIt's OK.\n\n01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:51.400\nI'm sure we'll get rescued.\n\n01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:54.400\nBecause you're a man of the people.\n\n01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:58.400\nYeah, and I have a radio to sabotage because I don't want to get rescued.\n\n01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:00.400\nI have 200 people liking me.\n\n01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:03.400\nMy plate is full.\n\n01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:05.400\nI'm describing my fantasy.\n\n01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:08.400\nI'm not going to want to write a lot.\n\n01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:11.400\nPlease, let's find out.\n\n01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:14.400\nCaleb, you're in a tribal situation.\n\n01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.400\nIt's never going to end.\n\n01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:21.400\nDay by day, you're waking up in the most tribal sense.\n\n01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:24.400\nIf your archetype was what?\n\n01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:29.400\nYou can express that in any language you want, whether it's an actual job that exists\n\n01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:33.400\nor just be like, I would like to be the guy that blah, blah, blah, whatever.\n\n01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:35.400\nGo from there.\n\n01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:44.400\nWell, in that fantasy land, I would probably want to be some kind of mentor or teacher to this tribe.\n\n01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:50.400\nI think education, whether it's like talking about math, science, all that shit, that's bullshit.\n\n01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:55.400\nEducation should be, in my opinion, mostly about morality.\n\n01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:58.400\nAnd I don't think a lot of teachers or a lot of people realize that,\n\n01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:00.400\nespecially not enough to put it into play.\n\n01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:05.400\nWell, so kind of a priest you're describing then, because you're saying, you want to be a mentor.\n\n01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:07.400\nWell, don't lie to me, I'm not gotching him.\n\n01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:14.400\nYou're saying, fuck science and math, but hallelujah to guiding and teaching.\n\n01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:17.400\nNot that those things aren't important, because they are.\n\n01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:25.400\nBut really, I think a lot of the reason that the US is in a state of shambles right now, in case you haven't noticed.\n\n01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:29.400\nI've never heard you talk about it for several long time.\n\n01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:33.400\nI kind of unplugged.\n\n01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:36.400\nIs America still in shambles? I haven't checked in.\n\n01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:45.400\nI would like to be the guy that wrangles the monkeys.\n\n01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:50.400\nBecause they're going to get into our stuff.\n\n01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:54.400\nAnd somebody's just got to be on top of that.\n\n01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:57.400\nI want to be that. Spencer's going to be...\n\n01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:59.400\nI want to build stuff.\n\n01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:04.400\nSpencer's going to build, like, a school for the monkeys.\n\n01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:06.400\nAnd I'll, right?\n\n01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:08.400\nYeah.\n\n01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:13.400\nAnd in this school, you'll teach them how to build more schools.\n\n01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:15.400\nMonkey schools.\n\n01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:18.400\nI'm going to coach a monkey improv troupe.\n\n01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:20.400\nOkay.\n\n01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:22.400\nAll right, this is really work.\n\n01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:24.400\nSteve! Oh my God, Steve's here!\n\n01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:25.400\nSteve Levy!\n\n01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:27.400\nThe human alarm clock!\n\n01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:29.400\nThe human alarm clock.\n\n01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:32.400\nWhat do you want to do on the island?\n\n01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:34.400\nI just want to interject there.\n\n01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:37.400\nSteve's not allowed to choose that.\n\n01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:43.400\nIf we're on the same plane, he still has to work for me.\n\n01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:45.400\nOkay, Steve, if you want to answer the question...\n\n01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:48.400\nSo, I guess then I would continue being a human alarm clock.\n\n01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:50.400\nSo, in the morning, I wake up and go like,\n\n01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:52.400\ncock-a-doodle-doo or something.\n\n01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:55.400\nI don't know how you want to phrase it.\n\n01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:58.400\nOkay, all right, take me out of the picture.\n\n01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:01.400\nIt's a different island from me.\n\n01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:03.400\nHe's directionless.\n\n01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:07.400\nI either want to be probably like a chef,\n\n01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:10.400\nlearn how to cook with all the things I have,\n\n01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:12.400\nwhich is probably very little.\n\n01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:13.400\nWow!\n\n01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:15.400\nCurious, just curious.\n\n01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:18.400\nIt's amazing that you're crashing an island in here.\n\n01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:21.400\nOr a real, I mean, sanitation is going to happen.\n\n01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:22.400\nRight?\n\n01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:24.400\nIsn't that a big problem?\n\n01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:28.400\nHe's got a good point.\n\n01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:32.400\nYou guys don't know Steve has a passion for sanitation.\n\n01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:35.400\nThis guy fucking loves this shit.\n\n01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:38.400\nI just, you know, try to help society waste water.\n\n01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:40.400\nYou're an anarchist dream,\n\n01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:43.400\nbecause anarchists philosophically need to assert the idea\n\n01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:47.400\nphilosophically that if we were in a tribal situation,\n\n01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:49.400\nthere would be someone that would be more than willing\n\n01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:53.400\nto handle getting the shit away from the food, you know?\n\n01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:55.400\nAnd that it would all work out.\n\n01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:57.400\nYeah, the dream is that during the day,\n\n01:32:57.400 --> 01:33:00.400\nI'm preparing all the food.\n\n01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:01.400\nAnd at night, I'm...\n\n01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:02.400\nUh-oh.\n\n01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:04.400\nGet the shit out of here!\n\n01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:06.400\nThis might be kind of doomed.\n\n01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:09.400\nAll right, I think you're overextending yourself a little bit.\n\n01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:11.400\nI'm worried about you.\n\n01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:13.400\nYou know what I'm going to do?\n\n01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:15.400\nI saved my slot.\n\n01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:17.400\nI'll be your therapist.\n\n01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:20.400\nBecause I think you need to overcome your workaholism.\n\n01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:21.400\nOkay.\n\n01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:23.400\nAnd I would love to wake up every morning and go,\n\n01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:25.400\nif I do nothing else today, and I won't,\n\n01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:29.400\nI'm going to help Steve Levyme relax.\n\n01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:31.400\nThat all tracks for me.\n\n01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:33.400\nI would wake up every day if my job was to meet with you\n\n01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:36.400\non a beach and be like,\n\n01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:38.400\nhey, man, how you doing?\n\n01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:42.400\nEvery day, I would be willing to have you sit down in front of me\n\n01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:44.400\nand go, how did it go today?\n\n01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:47.400\nAnd you tell me stuff and then I would be like,\n\n01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:49.400\nyou know, you shouldn't let that get you down\n\n01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:51.400\nand all this stuff like I just like babbling at you\n\n01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:52.400\nabout how you should feel.\n\n01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:54.400\nI'd love that job.\n\n01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:55.400\nThanks, yeah.\n\n01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:59.400\nI would love to be a part of that, yeah.\n\n01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:01.400\nBut I think I'm competing with you for that job\n\n01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:04.400\nbecause you and I are both saying the same thing.\n\n01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:06.400\nCaleb, I'm talking to Caleb.\n\n01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:08.400\nYou and I both are like,\n\n01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:10.400\nyou know what I'd love to do is just hang out\n\n01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:13.400\nand talk to people about how they should fucking think.\n\n01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:16.400\nCan I change my...\n\n01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:19.400\nCan I be a talk show host?\n\n01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:20.400\nThat could be good.\n\n01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:22.400\nThis is a fantasy tribe.\n\n01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:28.400\nWe're not vetting it through what's going to make the tribe survive.\n\n01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:30.400\nI'm actually curious about the data we'd get.\n\n01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:36.400\nIf we asked 200 people, would we get like a certain percentage of people\n\n01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:39.400\nthat'd be like, you know what, honestly swear to God,\n\n01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:40.400\nif you took money off the table,\n\n01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:44.400\nI took everything off the table and you really told me that nothing was ever going to change.\n\n01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:48.400\nSo I wasn't going to find out when I was 55 years old\n\n01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:50.400\nthat no system was going to tell me,\n\n01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:51.400\nyou did what?\n\n01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:55.400\nYou believed in hairstyling for 30 years?\n\n01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:57.400\nYou're a dumb piece of shit.\n\n01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:01.400\nYou were supposed to put that hairstyling money into a Roth IRA.\n\n01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:02.400\nYou're fucking stupid.\n\n01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:05.400\nYour kids got AIDS and you can't cure it now.\n\n01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:07.400\nYou're a fucking piece of shit.\n\n01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:08.400\nYou have poverty.\n\n01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:09.400\nYou should die.\n\n01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:12.400\nThat's what we're all reacting to all the time.\n\n01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:17.400\nWhat's the thing if you took all that shit off the table that fear of like,\n\n01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:21.400\noh fuck, I don't want to find out I did it wrong?\n\n01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:24.400\nWhat would you do as a sim all day?\n\n01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:33.400\nI think the theory is primatologically that there would be enough people that would be like,\n\n01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:35.400\nI think I'd want to cut everyone's hair.\n\n01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:37.400\nThere would be just enough of those people.\n\n01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:40.400\nThere wouldn't be 40 of those people per 200 people.\n\n01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:41.400\nWhat would you do?\n\n01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:43.400\nThe most simple thing that would make me happy?\n\n01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:44.400\nMe?\n\n01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:46.400\nWell, that's where it gets out to this thing.\n\n01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:49.400\nI swear to God, I'm saying what Caleb's saying.\n\n01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:54.400\nBut I swear, I think I would be, let me think about it for a second.\n\n01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:56.400\nCan you guys do something else while I really think about it?\n\n01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:58.400\nI think that I'd teach you.\n\n01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:03.400\nThere are people in anarcho-syndicalist societies that they go,\n\n01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:07.400\noh, I don't have to sweep floors all day long for no money.\n\n01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:09.400\nI can now do what I want.\n\n01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:11.400\nAnd there are people that go, you know what I want to do?\n\n01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:12.400\nI want to plant trees.\n\n01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:14.400\nAnd I want to make the street pretty.\n\n01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:17.400\nAnd I want to just go out and plant trees.\n\n01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:22.400\nAnd that's my life's ambition is to beautify something.\n\n01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:24.400\nOr people go, you know what?\n\n01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:29.400\nThere's exactly the same amount of, oh, it's those assholes.\n\n01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:30.400\nYeah, of course.\n\n01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:32.400\nYou tricked us!\n\n01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:36.400\nYou tricked us into believing in a dream!\n\n01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:39.400\nSo we softened you.\n\n01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:43.400\nBut there are people, there are also people that work in a factory all day long,\n\n01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:49.400\nand they go, if I had time between my commute and doing my day job\n\n01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:53.400\nand needing to eat food and feed my children and do all this stuff,\n\n01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:58.400\nI would love to make model airplanes because at heart I'm an engineer.\n\n01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.400\nI would love to make things.\n\n01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:06.400\nAnd if people had free time to actually do something that made them joyful\n\n01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:13.400\nand gave them glee, like for me, I think it'd be as simple as gardening.\n\n01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:16.400\nLike I would like to grow things because it's a very satisfying thing.\n\n01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:20.400\nThe idea that people, yeah, you saying that, first of all, I believe it.\n\n01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:25.400\nAnd second of all, it blows my fucking mind so much that I'm like, the dream is real.\n\n01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:30.400\nBut there's a person that actually wants to garden that I'm like,\n\n01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:35.400\nbecause I'm like, I don't want nothing to do with that.\n\n01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:40.400\nSo for you to say, if you're being remotely honest about it,\n\n01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:43.400\nI want to get down, I hear people express that all the time.\n\n01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:46.400\nI want my hands in the dirt and I love nurturing and stuff,\n\n01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:49.400\nand I see that passion, otherwise we wouldn't have shit that grows.\n\n01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:52.400\nIt's obviously reliant to people that feel that way.\n\n01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:57.400\nAnd so, and then that does cast people like me in a little bit, and I think Caleb,\n\n01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:00.400\nyou know, a little bit of a fraud complex, right?\n\n01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:02.400\nBecause what are we doing? We're going like,\n\n01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:07.400\nI'm a frog, I'm a frog, I'm a frog.\n\n01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:10.400\nDoes it count as any answer if what you want to do is hang out\n\n01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:16.400\nand let people know they're doing a good job?\n\n01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:19.400\nYou want to be like, no, that makes me a bad person,\n\n01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:22.400\nmaybe we haven't found like whatever...\n\n01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:24.400\nWhy is that a frog complex?\n\n01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:27.400\nFraud, you fucking dick!\n\n01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:30.400\nYou said frog. You said frog.\n\n01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:31.400\nI sounded like frog.\n\n01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:35.400\nI don't care what I said. English is contextual.\n\n01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:42.400\nNo one has ever had a frog complex.\n\n01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:45.400\nActually, that sounds kind of, I mean, a frog complex,\n\n01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:47.400\ngiven our history and mythology of like,\n\n01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:50.400\nfrogs turning into princes that's like, I'm an ugly frog.\n\n01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:51.400\nThat would make sense.\n\n01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:52.400\nYou yelled at me.\n\n01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:56.400\nAll right, well, I yelled at you because I'm a frog.\n\n01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:57.400\nHe's got a frog complex.\n\n01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:58.400\nI'm talking to Caleb.\n\n01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:02.400\nDan, do you know what a horny toad says?\n\n01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:05.400\nRub it.\n\n01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:07.400\nWhat? What does he say?\n\n01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:08.400\nRub it.\n\n01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:09.400\nRub it.\n\n01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:10.400\nRub it?\n\n01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:11.400\nRub it.\n\n01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:12.400\nRub it.\n\n01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:13.400\nRub it.\n\n01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:14.400\nRub it.\n\n01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:17.400\nRub it.\n\n01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:22.400\nYeah.\n\n01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:24.400\nJeff is bowing.\n\n01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:25.400\nCurt's seeing.\n\n01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:28.400\nThat's them saying they wish the show was over.\n\n01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:29.400\nThat's all they're saying.\n\n01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:30.400\nYeah.\n\n01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:31.400\nAnd I...\n\n01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:34.400\nThey're saying that would have made a good closer.\n\n01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:35.400\nI don't...\n\n01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:36.400\nYeah.\n\n01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:38.400\nI'm just gonna say that would have been a bad closer.\n\n01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:42.400\nI was certain that I was not going to follow up any questions.\n\n01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:45.400\nI thought you said frog complex, too.\n\n01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:48.400\nBut I kind of wonder, I really always wonder that,\n\n01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:51.400\nbut I've listened to that Sapien's book and stuff.\n\n01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:53.400\nI just wonder about that.\n\n01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:57.400\nYou scoop 100 people up with a net,\n\n01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:01.400\nand you dump them into an aquarium as much as you can.\n\n01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:02.400\nProbably drunk.\n\n01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:05.400\nIf it...\n\n01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:08.400\nThe aquarium's not...\n\n01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:11.400\nNot only is it not filled with water, Caleb,\n\n01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:14.400\nhe was off-mine, and he said they'd probably drown.\n\n01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:17.400\nIt's not filled with water, and it's not a real aquarium.\n\n01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:20.400\nBut that idea of...\n\n01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:22.400\nI think that's like...\n\n01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:24.400\nI want to get to the bottom.\n\n01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:26.400\nIt's an idealistic dream.\n\n01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:32.400\nI feel like I've spent 30 years belonging to an ideology\n\n01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:35.400\nthat, even though it doesn't get questioned a lot,\n\n01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:38.400\nthat underneath everything, what I really believe\n\n01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:43.400\nis that if you took 100 people and scooped them up randomly\n\n01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:48.400\nand plopped them onto a pile of desert\n\n01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:50.400\nthat they had to fend for themselves,\n\n01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:53.400\nthat they would have problems,\n\n01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:56.400\nand there would be crime, and there would be horrible things happening,\n\n01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:58.400\nthere would be hatred, there would be all these things.\n\n01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:03.400\nBut that overall, there would be this order that evolved\n\n01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:06.400\nthat was actually somehow kind of a little...\n\n01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:10.400\nThe one thing you could say about that society\n\n01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:12.400\nif you came back to visit it in 10 years,\n\n01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:18.400\nit would be there's a lot less knots in the psychology.\n\n01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:21.400\nThere's a lot less of these things.\n\n01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:25.400\n30% of the people aren't having rape fantasies.\n\n01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:29.400\nIt wouldn't be as fucking knotted up.\n\n01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:34.400\nIt would be more natural.\n\n01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:36.400\nPeople would just be like,\n\n01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:39.400\nhere's what I like to do.\n\n01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:41.400\nI talked to Cindy about it.\n\n01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:43.400\nShe said it's fine.\n\n01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:45.400\nEveryone would be like, I'm frustrated\n\n01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:48.400\nbecause Mark doesn't do enough of this.\n\n01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:50.400\nIt would just be a little less knotted.\n\n01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:53.400\nYou guys don't know what a phone cord is,\n\n01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:56.400\nbut that's how I always look at society.\n\n01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:59.400\nThey design society.\n\n01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:03.400\nThere was this thing in the 90s called the phone cord.\n\n01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:06.400\nEngineers had this problem.\n\n01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:08.400\nThey had to make phones.\n\n01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:11.400\nYou had to be able to talk on them wherever you went,\n\n01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:14.400\nbut we couldn't have you do that yet.\n\n01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:16.400\nStick with me.\n\n01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:18.400\nSo they needed cords,\n\n01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:20.400\nbut they couldn't just make a fucking string\n\n01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:22.400\nthat was so long that you could walk everywhere\n\n01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:24.400\nbecause then the dog would hang itself\n\n01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:27.400\nand you would just step on it and all this shit.\n\n01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:32.400\nSo they need this intricately curled cord.\n\n01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:34.400\nIt's like a phone cord.\n\n01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:39.400\nIf you pull on it, the spiral stretches out,\n\n01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:41.400\nand you could play with it when you talk on the phone,\n\n01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:43.400\nbut overall it was just this attempt to turn something\n\n01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:46.400\nthat wasn't elastic into something elastic.\n\n01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:49.400\nIt was this attempt to take something that needed to be connected\n\n01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:52.400\nand make it as if it wasn't connected.\n\n01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:54.400\nAnd that's how I feel about society,\n\n01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:57.400\nis that there's too many fucking...\n\n01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:03.400\nThat laugh really got to me.\n\n01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:05.400\nIt was a natural laugh,\n\n01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:08.400\nand it's important that it got to me.\n\n01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:12.400\nIt's true what I'm saying doesn't make a lot of sense.\n\n01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:15.400\nBut that's the point of explaining something to people.\n\n01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:18.400\nYou got a real fraud complex.\n\n01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:20.400\nI just want to finish my thought,\n\n01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:22.400\nand I don't care that it doesn't make...\n\n01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:25.400\nIf you can bring this train into the station,\n\n01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:27.400\nand we all know it's not going to make sense\n\n01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:29.400\nwhen I'm finished saying it.\n\n01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:31.400\nThat's how I look at society,\n\n01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:33.400\nis that it's already fucking coiled.\n\n01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:35.400\nIt's already designed to do something\n\n01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:37.400\nthat it's not supposed to do.\n\n01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:39.400\nBut also, that's noble.\n\n01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:41.400\nThe idea that it just goes like that.\n\n01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:43.400\nWhen you look at a new phone cord,\n\n01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:45.400\nwhen you buy it at the hardware store,\n\n01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:47.400\nand you hold it in your hands,\n\n01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:50.400\nyou're like, this is an actual marvel of engineering.\n\n01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:52.400\nIt's kind of beautiful,\n\n01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:55.400\nbut you want to touch it and put your finger through the...\n\n01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:58.400\nYou kids don't know what a phone cord is.\n\n01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:01.400\nAlso, you didn't know that you had to buy them\n\n01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:03.400\nat the hardware store.\n\n01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:06.400\nYou did.\n\n01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:08.400\nThe hardware store?\n\n01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:11.400\nNo, there were phone stores.\n\n01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:13.400\nYeah, it's that...\n\n01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:15.400\nHonestly, at this point,\n\n01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:18.400\nthe temptation to take me down is...\n\n01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:21.400\nYou're increasing my self-esteem.\n\n01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:23.400\nIncreasing it.\n\n01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:25.400\nI'm sorry to inform you.\n\n01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:28.400\nEvery breath I take without your permission\n\n01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:30.400\nraises my self-worth.\n\n01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:33.400\nThere's a certain point when you force a human being\n\n01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:37.400\nto realize that they can't exist with your approval,\n\n01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:39.400\nit makes me stronger.\n\n01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:41.400\nI'm your worst nightmare.\n\n01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:44.400\nI'm the person that you didn't want to live to see today\n\n01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:46.400\nthat did.\n\n01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:48.400\nNow I know you're powerless.\n\n01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:51.400\nOkay, don't applaud that.\n\n01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:54.400\nThat's Hitler stuff.\n\n01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:57.400\nWe don't want to do with the two hammers and the pink flight.\n\n01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:59.400\nWhat were you going to say?\n\n01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:01.400\nThe phone cord.\n\n01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:04.400\nI just wanted to get to the finish of the phone cord.\n\n01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:10.400\nYou millennials, the phone cord is notoriously easy to tangle.\n\n01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:13.400\nIt was simultaneously a thing that was like,\n\n01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:15.400\nwe solved it, we figured it out.\n\n01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:18.400\nThis thing needs to connect from one side of your house\n\n01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:21.400\nto another or from the cradle of the phone to the handset.\n\n01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:23.400\nBut who wants to deal with it?\n\n01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:26.400\nWe want it to be kosher and friendly and nice.\n\n01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:29.400\nThe result is this thing that stretches\n\n01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:31.400\nand it's this amazing feat of engineering.\n\n01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:34.400\nBut when that thing tangles, when you use it,\n\n01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:36.400\nwhen you put it to the test,\n\n01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:39.400\nit is the most fucking knotted ass.\n\n01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:41.400\nIt gets so fucking tangled.\n\n01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:44.400\nWhat I'm saying is, when we talk about anarchy,\n\n01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:46.400\nwe're talking about just saying,\n\n01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:48.400\nwhat if we had a straight cord?\n\n01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:52.400\nAnd the answer is, that's not possible\n\n01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:55.400\nbecause we need this fucking thing to reach across the house.\n\n01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:57.400\nYou can't talk about anarchy anywhere\n\n01:45:57.400 --> 01:45:59.400\nbecause you talk about 100 people.\n\n01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:01.400\nBut it still is worth keeping in your head.\n\n01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:03.400\nYou know, if this fucking thing was straight,\n\n01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:06.400\nJesus Christ, we're talking about a phone, do it.\n\n01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:07.400\nAll right, I'm done.\n\n01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:09.400\nWell, wait, okay.\n\n01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:12.400\nThat's the last little cap.\n\n01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:15.400\nIt's not like I actually think we should all go live in a cave\n\n01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:16.400\nand hurt bison.\n\n01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:17.400\nI don't really believe that.\n\n01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:19.400\nWell, what if our communities,\n\n01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:21.400\nthe communities we actually lived and worked in,\n\n01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:24.400\nwere so functional that we were less reliant\n\n01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:27.400\non all these greater networks for support that we do?\n\n01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:31.400\nWhat if they started with the precept that if any society,\n\n01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:33.400\nif there's any single human being that's suffering,\n\n01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:35.400\nthat the society is failing,\n\n01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:37.400\nthat it's like that's a light bulb that's out\n\n01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:40.400\nfrom the perspective of a light bulb society.\n\n01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:43.400\nIt doesn't need to be changed.\n\n01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:45.400\nIt doesn't need to be disregarded.\n\n01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:47.400\nIt needs to be, we need to deal with this.\n\n01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:50.400\nThat we can draw, even if you're crazy,\n\n01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:52.400\neven if you're perverted,\n\n01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:54.400\neven if you're indigent,\n\n01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:56.400\neven if you're like whatever,\n\n01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:59.400\nwhatever your challenge you're posing to our progress,\n\n01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:01.400\nthat actually is the whole point of this,\n\n01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:03.400\nis that you're on the ground\n\n01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:05.400\nand you can't hold yourself up\n\n01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:06.400\nand you don't know what's going on\n\n01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:08.400\nor you're angry about something that we say to you,\n\n01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:12.400\nthen okay, we gotta figure this out.\n\n01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:14.400\nWhat if everything was based on that?\n\n01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:17.400\nThat was the core that went outward.\n\n01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:19.400\nIt's impossible, is the answer,\n\n01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:22.400\nbecause our societies are obviously based on tribes\n\n01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:25.400\nthat speared people better.\n\n01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:29.400\nThere's no argument to be made.\n\n01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:31.400\nIt's like a TED talk.\n\n01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:34.400\nI thought, what if we could feel for a living?\n\n01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:36.400\nYeah, that'd be great.\n\n01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:38.400\nI know, I know we can't.\n\n01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:40.400\nI know we just had to spear each other.\n\n01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:42.400\nI'm talking into a microphone\n\n01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:47.400\nmade out of the blood of weaker, better people.\n\n01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:50.400\nThis microphone is made out of people\n\n01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:52.400\nthat are better than me, that died,\n\n01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:55.400\nbecause they gave someone the benefit of the doubt.\n\n01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:58.400\nAnd someone was like,\n\n01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:01.400\nhey, come here for a second.\n\n01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:04.400\nHey, love you, come over here.\n\n01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:06.400\nIt sounds like he loves me.\n\n01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:08.400\nHoney, I don't think we should.\n\n01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:10.400\nDo we really want to live in a world\n\n01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:13.400\nwhere we can't respond to someone saying what he's saying?\n\n01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:15.400\nThis Mad Max wasteland,\n\n01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:18.400\nisn't the beginning of making things better?\n\n01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:20.400\nYou're right, I'm sorry.\n\n01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:23.400\nDon't fucking talk back to me ever again.\n\n01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:26.400\nOkay, well, I think you're gaslighting me.\n\n01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:28.400\nFuck you, there's no such thing as that.\n\n01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:31.400\nYou made that up because you're fucking crazy.\n\n01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:34.400\nThere's no such thing as gaslighting, you fucking made it up\n\n01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:36.400\nbecause you're fucking crazy.\n\n01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:39.400\nAnd I love you, and I'm just going to go talk to this guy.\n\n01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:42.400\nI just want to trade you some petrol for some lizard skin.\n\n01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:44.400\nHey, whoa.\n\n01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:49.400\nYou should have never trusted another fucking human piece of shit.\n\n01:48:49.400 -->

conversation.\n\n01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:06.400\nI thought it was like,\n\n01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:08.400\nno, I'm into football.\n\n01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:10.400\nNo, you're a drunk dad.\n\n01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:12.400\nYou were like, what happened last week?\n\n01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:14.400\nLast week was the special, right?\n\n01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:16.400\nEvery one of our cameras,\n\n01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:18.400\nwe could bond, but this is our relationship,\n\n01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:20.400\nis my memory.\n\n01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:22.400\nI'm like, yeah, I don't want to make this sled.\n\n01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:24.400\nIt's going to be a great sled.\n\n01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:26.400\nIt could be like me remembering things.\n\n01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:28.400\nDan, maybe a bad pitch.\n\n01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:30.400\nWe have like a couple minutes left.\n\n01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:32.400\nWhat if we do a very brief\n\n01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:34.400\nD&D thing where it's you and Nova,\n\n01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:36.400\nand you guys are on like a little\n\n01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:38.400\nside quest right now.\n\n01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:40.400\nOoh, awesome.\n\n01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:42.400\nDid you say you're on board?\n\n01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:44.400\nYou find yourself on a little raft.\n\n01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:50.400\nOkay.\n\n01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:52.400\nYou're on a little raft.\n\n01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:54.400\nYou've been sailing for days\n\n01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:56.400\nfor the shores of mines\n\n01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:00.400\nto find the mines of shores.\n\n01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:04.400\nYou're on a raft?\n\n01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:06.400\nYou're on a raft.\n\n01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:08.400\nIs my character...\n\n01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:10.400\nLet's establish that now.\n\n01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:12.400\nI am Guffolk,\n\n01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:14.400\na healer\n\n01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:18.400\nof folk.\n\n01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:20.400\nI'm Tammy,\n\n01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:22.400\nflibber of derbs.\n\n01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:24.400\nFlibber of derbs?\n\n01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:26.400\nI'm flibber of derbs.\n\n01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:28.400\nSorry.\n\n01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:30.400\nThe sun, it's making my brain heal.\n\n01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:32.400\nIt's a little hot.\n\n01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:34.400\nWe should probably get some water,\n\n01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:36.400\nor maybe not.\n\n01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:38.400\nI'm sorry I talked you into this adventure.\n\n01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:40.400\nIt's probably not what you expected.\n\n01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:42.400\nYou know what, I kind of seemed like\n\n01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:44.400\nI was letting you talk me into it,\n\n01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:46.400\nbut really I was on board the whole time.\n\n01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:48.400\nI just, you know.\n\n01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:50.400\nYeah, okay, so we're on this raft.\n\n01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:52.400\nWe gotta make it to shore.\n\n01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:54.400\nOh, you make it to shore.\n\n01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:56.400\nI take my apology back.\n\n01:57:56.400 --> 01:57:58.400\nI nailed it.\n\n01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:00.400\nWe're partners in this adventure.\n\n01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:02.400\nYou don't get to just be like,\n\n01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:04.400\nhey, I'm the one leading this.\n\n01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:06.400\nGiant crab!\n\n01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:08.400\nOh, shit.\n\n01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:10.400\nI don't want to get eaten alive.\n\n01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:12.400\nIt's bigger than that.\n\n01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:14.400\nI think that, by definition,\n\n01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:16.400\nthe giantness means you can't stomp them.\n\n01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:18.400\nI was thinking of a real giant crab.\n\n01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:20.400\nYou're thinking of a regular crab.\n\n01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:22.400\nA stompable crab, they call them.\n\n01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:24.400\nI was thinking of a real giant crab,\n\n01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:26.400\nwhich is only kind of big.\n\n01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:28.400\nYou have real giant crabs like at Albertsons.\n\n01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:30.400\nYou could still stomp them.\n\n01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:32.400\nDo I have any weapons?\n\n01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:34.400\nThere's actually a whole stompable crab section.\n\n01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:36.400\nI don't know why, since there's no non-stompable crabs.\n\n01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:38.400\nIt's a small, medium, large.\n\n01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:40.400\nWe have oars for a raft.\n\n01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:42.400\nI start stabbing at it with an oar.\n\n01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:44.400\nIs it actively trying to attack us?\n\n01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:46.400\nOh, actively.\n\n01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:48.400\nOkay, yeah.\n\n01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:50.400\nWill you help me out?\n\n01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:52.400\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:54.400\nI know your name, Mr.\n\n01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:56.400\nWe're in a raft forever.\n\n01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:58.400\nThis is not the time to high-road me.\n\n01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:02.400\nWhat's your preferred pronoun?\n\n01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:04.400\nKill the crab!\n\n01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:06.400\nDon't worry about it.\n\n01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:08.400\nWe'll figure it out later.\n\n01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:10.400\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:12.400\nYou guys want me to come back?\n\n01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:14.400\nWait, I didn't say anything about my preferred pronoun.\n\n01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:16.400\nI didn't say anything about that.\n\n01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:18.400\nNo, I knew you did that.\n\n01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:20.400\nNo, wait.\n\n01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:22.400\nActually, I need to ask you this.\n\n01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:24.400\nDid the crab ever attack us?\n\n01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:26.400\nIt just said giant crab.\n\n01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:28.400\nIt seemed like it was attacking.\n\n01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:30.400\nIt seemed like it was attacking.\n\n01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:32.400\nRight, I asked him if it was actively attacking,\n\n01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:34.400\nand he said it was.\n\n01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:36.400\nSorry.\n\n01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:38.400\nStop, you need to help me attack you.\n\n01:59:38.400 --> 01:59:40.400\nIt's attacking us actively.\n\n01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:42.400\nI'm going to come back later.\n\n01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:44.400\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:46.400\nWhen a crab says that, you...\n\n01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:48.400\nOkay, so next time we can just start a little domestic fighting,\n\n01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:50.400\nand then whatever it is, we'll leave us alone.\n\n01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:52.400\nBecause it'll be too awkward for them, and they'll just leave.\n\n01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:54.400\nYeah, I don't know how to...\n\n01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:56.400\nBye, crab. Sorry.\n\n01:59:56.400 --> 01:59:58.400\nYeah.\n\n01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:00.400\nSorry.\n\n02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:02.400\nI just didn't know that you could talk.\n\n02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:04.400\nThe first thing I said was giant crab.\n\n02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:06.400\nIt was giant crab.\n\n02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:10.400\nWhy would you say that?\n\n02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:12.400\nFair enough, fair enough.\n\n02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:14.400\nI'm going for real now. Fair enough, I'm sorry.\n\n02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:16.400\nWe fucked up.\n\n02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:18.400\nCan we both say we fucked up?\n\n02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:20.400\nOkay, I'll say I fucked up.\n\n02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:22.400\nIf there's one thing I've learned,\n\n02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:24.400\nwe need to be a team.\n\n02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:26.400\nOtherwise, I'm not gaslighting you.\n\n02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:28.400\nSidewalking.\n\n02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:30.400\nHe's sideways walking. I don't know what that means.\n\n02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:32.400\nI don't know if that's like a micro.\n\n02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:34.400\nThat's why he's leaving.\n\n02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:36.400\nOkay, we fucked up.\n\n02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:38.400\nI contacted with not enough information,\n\n02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:40.400\nand you didn't back me up when I made the decision.\n\n02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:42.400\nWe both fucked up.\n\n02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:44.400\nAs your husband's giant crab,\n\n02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:46.400\nwhat are you doing? You were supposed to be home\n\n02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:48.400\nlike a half hour ago.\n\n02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:50.400\nWe better get out of here. This is awkward.\n\n02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:52.400\nI think he's elsewhere.\n\n02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:54.400\nI think if we stay, it's going to be better than if we...\n\n02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:56.400\nOh, so...\n\n02:00:56.400 --> 02:00:58.400\nWho are your new friends, Marcia?\n\n02:00:58.400 --> 02:01:00.400\nDo you have these friends over here?\n\n02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:02.400\nWell, they were kicking me.\n\n02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:04.400\nI'm sorry. I apologize.\n\n02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:06.400\nThis one was stepping on my foot a lot.\n\n02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:08.400\nI was thinking he was doing something.\n\n02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:10.400\nWhy don't we attack them?\n\n02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:12.400\nYou came at me. I'm sorry.\n\n02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:14.400\nI attack.\n\n02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:16.400\nI attack.\n\n02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:18.400\nI'm a protective crab.\n\n02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:20.400\nI attack Dan,\n\n02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:22.400\nor whatever his name is,\n\n02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:24.400\nover there.\n\n02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:26.400\nSorry about that. We should have left.\n\n02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:28.400\nGiant crabs!\n\n02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:30.400\nClaw attack.\n\n02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:32.400\nOkay, or it's right.\n\n02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:34.400\nWe're going to do it now.\n\n02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:36.400\nIf someone attacks me, hit them with an or.\n\n02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:38.400\nYou know what? Even if they don't,\n\n02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:40.400\npartners.\n\n02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:42.400\nFucking or attack.\n\n02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:44.400\nNo matter what. I don't even care if it makes me evil.\n\n02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:46.400\nLet's fucking go down.\n\n02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:48.400\nLet's do it.
