Jeff statistically women get more UTIs\n\n02:06.120 --> 02:10.720\nthan men I knew that their pee holes are closer to their butt holes that's not\n\n02:10.720 --> 02:15.120\nwhy Dan that's not why also the other side of the gender spectrum is a\n\n02:15.120 --> 02:19.520\nhorrendous filthy animal that always plunges yeah okay there's a million\n\n02:19.520 --> 02:25.680\nreasons but they get more UTIs and I too if you had described to me on paper like\n\n02:25.680 --> 02:32.360\noh there's a thing where you feel like you have to take a pee really bad but\n\n02:32.360 --> 02:38.200\nall the time forever no matter how much you pee you keep feeling like you have\n\n02:38.200 --> 02:46.680\nto pee I'd be like grow up that's not even a disease that sounds fun I'd pay\n\n02:46.680 --> 02:51.720\nmoney to experience that at like a theme park that sounds like an escape room to\n\n02:51.720 --> 02:57.840\nme bring it on I'd love to feel what it feels like to have to pee all the time I\n\n02:57.840 --> 03:01.800\nexperienced it for three hours this morning and I was like Rick and word\n\n03:01.800 --> 03:09.000\nhe's canceled I can't I'm gonna kill myself and I'm gonna take the gun that I\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:12.840\nreassembled after I bought it and I'm gonna just I don't even have to point it\n\n03:12.840 --> 03:17.080\nat my head to kill myself because as we established it's probably poorly\n\n03:17.080 --> 03:22.440\nreassembled by a liberal and I it'll just blow up in my hand and I'll bleed\n\n03:22.440 --> 03:26.760\nout because I don't know how to do anything at least of all handle a UTI and\n\n03:26.760 --> 03:32.320\nmy intrepid assistant Steve Levy did exactly what I commanded him to do which\n\n03:32.320 --> 03:37.160\nis I don't care what you have to do find me a doctor that will look at my dick\n\n03:37.160 --> 03:43.760\ntoday immediately and he found one I know a couple and God bless this guy's\n\n03:43.760 --> 03:49.120\nheart I mean it's like if you're gonna see a doctor same day you're not you're\n\n03:49.120 --> 03:58.360\nnot seeing like the same doctor that they're not sending their best the\n\n03:58.360 --> 04:03.000\nmedical community

me\n\n15:24.400 --> 15:29.600\nwith that thought I don't care how good a dentist I think this guy saw that I was\n\n15:29.600 --> 15:35.120\nover 40 and right know who Lorenzo Lamas is I mean I guess he's also seen a\n\n15:35.120 --> 15:39.400\nbunch of helicopters that didn't go down so he's comfortable just being like hey\n\n15:39.400 --> 15:47.440\nhere's a trivial thing your pilot not his first calling but it is later but my\n\n15:47.440 --> 15:51.920\nmind's tightening seat belts and doing trivia bye famous people famous people\n\n15:51.920 --> 15:57.960\nlove being pilots for some reason I read up on it today he loves flying\n\n15:57.960 --> 16:03.000\nchoppers he flies through the Grand Canyon to fly over New York City but\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:06.120\nhe's decided even supposed to fly through the Grand Canyon he sounds like a\n\n16:06.120 --> 16:11.000\nterrible pilot he was the lowest altitude it's lower than the ground he's\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:14.160\ntechnically crashing he found the only place he can do that without crashing\n\n16:14.160 --> 16:18.040\nbecause he's fucking throwing what's called a helicopter tantrum so we\n\n16:18.040 --> 16:21.480\nlearning through the Grand Canyon what you're technically doing is crashing and\n\n16:21.480 --> 16:26.920\nliving we hop on board and we get in the thing and I'm in the backseat with\n\n16:26.920 --> 16:30.520\ntwo others Jesse is in the frenzy and you get the headset with the with the\n\n16:30.520 --> 16:35.080\nmicrophone and and he's and he's getting things talking to the tower you can hear\n\n16:35.080 --> 16:38.200\nall the chatter and on your on your headset all the radio communication and\n\n16:38.200 --> 16:41.640\nwe can all hear each other I coughed into it by accident and you can everybody\n\n16:41.640 --> 16:48.120\ncould hear me cough so we get up in the air and I go are you are you captain\n\n16:48.120 --> 16:53.840\nLamas and and and he goes yes I am I go it's nice to meet you asking it's nice\n\n16:53.840 --> 16:59.320\nto meet you sort he's got shorts on he's tan and he's fucking beautiful he's\n\n16:59.320 --> 17:04.160\nabsolutely beautiful and I was just hoping that Jesse would just give him\n\n17:04.160 --> 17:08.680\nlike a handy like something like make it make this count and he's flying and all\n\n17:08.680 --> 17:15.560\nI want to do is ask Fernando Lamas questions and I got the calm on and\n\n17:15.560 --> 17:20.000\nwhat's that guy what what what kind of aircraft would fly in here captain and\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:23.720\nhe's like it's a death star and I don't know something like that a star it's a\n\n17:23.720 --> 17:27.040\ndeath star it's a death star and we're going and you're right over the deck\n\n17:27.040 --> 17:30.200\nit's Jurassic Park with the thing without the pelicans flying alongside and\n\n17:30.200 --> 17:35.720\nwe're going along and I just I'm dying I got to talk to him and the only thing I\n\n17:35.720 --> 17:42.800\nsaid to him the whole flight was said oh hey captain yeah answer that what's our\n\n17:42.800 --> 17:51.160\naltitude and he goes 500 and that was it that was it and then we landed and I\n\n17:51.160 --> 17:55.200\nthought maybe get a fucking picture with Fernando Fernando Lorenzo Lamas and he\n\n17:55.200 --> 17:58.560\nwill come out and like he knows that we all want to photo with him because he's\n\n17:58.560 --> 18:02.360\nclearly aware that I'm a fan or at least I just want to interrupt with one\n\n18:02.360 --> 18:07.280\nthing because it's important you can enter your recovery that's Jeff just\n\n18:07.280 --> 18:11.080\ntold a celebrity story that didn't end with the celebrity thanking him for\n\n18:11.080 --> 18:15.080\ntalking to him yeah that was the exact that was so brave for you the exact oh\n\n18:15.080 --> 18:19.200\nyeah this is just an unremarkable encounter with a celebrity and you just\n\n18:19.200 --> 18:24.520\ntook the L I don't this is not easy for me he we land he does a beautiful land\n\n18:24.520 --> 18:30.400\nand he landed on a dime and gave you some change and then that's a that is a\n\n18:30.400 --> 18:36.120\nreally accurate helicopter landed that and then we get out and they go you got\n\n18:36.120 --> 18:39.280\nto run off and then take off your safety a harness thing you get like a little\n\n18:39.280 --> 18:46.800\nsafety pack around you in case you die and he instantly just right out it's\n\n18:46.800 --> 18:50.440\nlike I'm sorry Angie Harmon's on the set of resilient yeah but also he has to go\n\n18:50.440 --> 18:55.240\nsolve the murder that he was framed for like yeah yeah yeah you don't know that\n\n18:55.240 --> 19:01.880\nit's just good shit and I'm still not over it Lorenzo Lamas flew me to to\n\n19:01.880 --> 19:06.160\nCatalina Islands I mean I would be talking about that for a long time\n\n19:06.160 --> 19:10.440\nthese kids seem to agree let's bring up Brandon Johnson everybody Brandon\n\n19:10.440 --> 19:23.680\nJohnson yeah and let's escalate things but first Brandon how's it going how's\n\n19:23.680 --> 19:29.920\nyour what's it like doing a voice on the

20:08.360\nbeloved actor that probably all right anyway it's funny you say that because I\n\n20:08.360 --> 20:11.920\ndid the exact same joke as someone said no he's dead I did the same joke really\n\n20:11.920 --> 20:15.680\nis it is just like in our iCloud I guess that's the guy that would be piloted\n\n20:15.680 --> 20:22.000\nPatrick Swayze I think I meant Patrick Stewart I was we should have gone with\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:26.360\nlike like Morgan Freeman anybody like no he's to a he's to a level where you need\n\n20:26.360 --> 20:31.320\nthat B ish level anyway Brandon how's it

going to affect my behavior like for instance I'm gonna\n\n20:44.440 --> 20:49.000\nI'm not gonna get shitfaced before the show and then fumble everything but I am\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:54.360\nI'm I'm look I this is a this is the story of a person who was being made fun\n\n20:54.360 --> 21:03.040\nof from childhood for her voice and then through no seeking of her own ended up\n\n21:03.040 --> 21:07.360\nbeing coming incredibly famous for that exact same voice and I would imagine\n\n21:07.360 --> 21:11.920\nalthough we haven't asked her yet I almost think that that voice like may\n\n21:11.920 --> 21:16.400\nprohibit her from being in like your average like movies now that are all\n\n21:16.400 --> 21:20.440\nmade from CG maybe that's one thing we'll ask her about but gotta be one of\n\n21:20.440 --> 21:26.720\nthe most famous voices we you'll ever hear but also an incredible person\n\n21:26.720 --> 21:31.880\nhappens to be the the connection here is that she makes like this incredibly\n\n21:31.880 --> 21:35.960\ngourmet true crime podcast Dan we hate true crime we hate that you're into it\n\n21:35.960 --> 21:40.760\nfuck off it's actually it's actually a show you'd

good Wikipedia page it's the kind you'd want\n\n21:52.680 --> 21:59.280\nif a safe fell on your head and you had her Wikipedia page you'd love it but\n\n21:59.280 --> 22:03.480\nall I'm gonna do is ask her questions about Maximum Overdrive please welcome\n\n22:03.480 --> 22:11.520\nactress writer performer the activist stateswoman hopefully new friend Yardley\n\n22:11.520 --> 22:31.400\nSmith\n\n22:31.400 --> 22:42.200\nanywhere you like yeah yeah oh yeah yeah you can move my the metaphor for my\n\n22:42.200 --> 22:49.800\nis there any room for this table to have function no there's not in its place\n\n22:49.800 --> 22:59.520\nmy awareness so let's I want to start with your upbringing because I did go\n\n22:59.520 --> 23:02.560\nthrough your Wikipedia page a little bit first of all thank you for coming\n\n23:02.560 --> 23:07.920\nthose I don't know who writes them collectively a swarm a swarm it's so\n\n23:07.920 --> 23:13.400\nweird and it's weird that you can't go in and edit them yourself I bet you could\n\n23:13.400 --> 23:17.960\nif you really wanted to you can't you can't I've tried actually I've tried to\n\n23:17.960 --> 23:22.680\nget some stuff off there for a really no it I don't know how it's run there's\n\n23:22.680 --> 23:26.600\nthere's things on there that just really shouldn't be there it's a hundred percent\n\n23:26.600 --> 23:33.680\ntrue because you used to be the Sultan of Brunei I did yes and I tried to say\n\n23:33.680 --> 23:40.280\nit's no longer relevant like fuck off we're keeping it like what is that but\n\n23:40.280 --> 23:45.240\nis it do you ever look at yours I haven't in a very long time I haven't I\n\n23:45.240 --> 23:49.880\nactually you know it's funny I was reading an article in Vanity Fair or\n\n23:49.880 --> 23:56.920\nsomething and it was an old archived article and it said that I think it was\n\n23:56.920 --> 24:00.480\nactually about Jennifer Lopez and it was and Jennifer Lopez was saying oh I\n\n24:00.480 --> 24:03.640\nnever read interviews about myself and the interviewer was saying in\n\n24:03.640 --> 24:08.960\nparentheses PS celebrities always say that and they always read interviews\n\n24:08.960 --> 24:14.560\nabout themselves that's actually not true it's not true I like I don't read\n\n24:14.560 --> 24:18.960\ninterviews about myself I rarely rarely listened to interviews I give I never\n\n24:18.960 --> 24:22.680\nread reviews anymore I don't read the good or the bad it just doesn't help me\n\n24:22.680 --> 24:27.520\nno it's very odd it's odd to be objectified in that way and it can really\n\n24:27.520 --> 24:32.640\nwell the prophet wears off it can only get you so high yes and then if you're\n\n24:32.640 --> 24:36.640\na responsible person you're like oh I can only go down I think if the if you're\n\n24:36.640 --> 24:40.680\nhealthy and you're privileged enough to be famous for a certain amount of time I\n\n24:40.680 --> 24:44.840\nwould expect it to top off where you're like I'm not looking at any of it but\n\n24:44.840 --> 24:49.960\nit has the weird effect of like oh I hate my own name I can't I can't like oh I\n\n24:49.960 --> 24:53.320\ngo to YouTube and I'm like I wish I knew how to build a model airplane I'm like\n\n24:53.320 --> 24:55.920\nyeah but you're Dan Harmon don't you want to read why Rick and Morty sucked in\n\n24:55.920 --> 25:01.520\nseason three like no I don't anything about anything that I was anything to\n\n25:01.520 --> 25:05.680\ndo with my name and my my sorry I shouldn't do all the talking I'm a bad\n\n25:05.680 --> 25:10.320\ninterviewer you I do actually want to know how you came up with Rick and\n\n25:10.320 --> 25:20.320\nMorty you've made a grave error here you know God did well how we did because\n\n25:20.320 --> 25:28.880\nyou know the show you work on rips it off every week I want to say to you\n\n25:28.880 --> 25:32.080\nthough because as I was reading your Wikipedia page at the bar before the\n\n25:32.080 --> 25:37.280\nshow I'm like I want I bet this person doesn't look at her Wikipedia page\n\n25:37.280 --> 25:42.280\nbecause I bet she's very healthy and I bet she deserves to know this is an\n\n25:42.280 --> 25:48.000\nimmaculate Wikipedia page oh you it it like just when you think what a nice\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:54.520\nperson what a good solid person right at the end it's like it's like no right at\n\n25:54.520 --> 25:59.680\nthe end it's like oh by the way huge LGBTQ fucking like benefactor and it's\n\n25:59.680 --> 26:07.800\nlike like snow in the camera like like like like didn't ask for it didn't come\n\n26:07.800 --> 26:12.960\nhat in hand you're just like oh yeah by the way gay people do like fucking nailed\n\n26:12.960 --> 26:19.680\nit that's true yes you did a one-woman show about where you're like you know\n\n26:19.680 --> 26:24.760\nbearing all and being honest about this this very I would say strange career\n\n26:24.760 --> 26:30.200\nyou've had yes so let's talk about that now for Brandon you're okay you got a\n\n26:30.200 --> 26:38.320\ndrink settle in let's go some of the striking stuff that I that about your\n\n26:38.320 --> 26:48.520\nearly career is this is the alienation because you didn't you you I you express\n\n26:48.520 --> 26:54.640\nto interviewers in the past about coming out here and let's set the stage it's\n\n26:54.640 --> 27:03.880\nlike what 80 when do you came out here in like 80s 86 early 86 and and and as\n\n27:03.880 --> 27:07.520\nyou described it and as someone described your description in Wikipedia it\n\n27:07.520 --> 27:12.280\nwas like on a half-promise of something which I think is everyone's story that\n\n27:12.280 --> 27:16.920\ncomes from somewhere to LA I'd gotten an LA agent had a New York agent I'd done\n\n27:16.920 --> 27:24.520\nincredibly well in New York I had I'd been there for literally six weeks I had\n\n27:24.520 --> 27:28.640\nauditioned for Mike Nichols who was directing a Tom Stopper play on Broadway\n\n27:28.640 --> 27:39.880\nI got that job what that's that's crazy yeah hey I just I'm new in town before\n\n27:39.880 --> 27:43.920\nyou can put your suitcase down you're working with geniuses I was but the\n\n27:43.920 --> 27:48.280\nfunny thing was is that I didn't know the part I was auditioning for was\n\n27:48.280 --> 27:53.800\nactually to understudy Cynthia Nixon I thought it was to play Jeremy Irons'\n\n27:53.800 --> 27:57.720\ndaughter but it was in fact to understudy to the Nixon who was playing Jeremy\n\n27:57.720 --> 28:02.600\nIrons' daughter and I was like fuck that fuck that noise I am not doing that and\n\n28:02.600 --> 28:07.560\nmy agent was like who are you and also to be clear you are already East Coast\n\n28:07.560 --> 28:11.840\nlike who comes to the West Coast to do a Tom Stopper play with my no no that was\n\n28:11.840 --> 28:16.120\nin New York okay so this is still wait so where were you what did you come out\n\n28:16.120 --> 28:23.240\nI remember wait wait don't tell me it was Paris I was born in Paris because my\n\n28:23.240 --> 28:29.600\nfather was a foreign correspondent and so my and he was actually in Poland when\n\n28:29.600 --> 28:34.160\nmy mother was pregnant with me and he was my mother I have an older brother\n\n28:34.160 --> 28:38.280\nwho was born in London and she was in Poland when she was pregnant with him\n\n28:38.280 --> 28:43.760\nas well and the Polish doctors said to my mother you don't you don't speak the\n\n28:43.760 --> 28:47.600\nlanguage very well and if something goes wrong we probably can't accommodate you\n\n28:47.600 --> 28:53.720\nas well as we you can in a Western country so go somewhere else so she went\n\n28:53.720 --> 28:59.080\nto London for my brother that was 1963 she went to Paris for me that was 1964\n\n28:59.080 --> 29:03.560\nand people think by the way that the phrase Polish medicine is racist it's\n\n29:03.560 --> 29:07.600\ntotally how they practice they're just like hey you don't talk great get out of\n\n29:07.600 --> 29:12.920\nhere we can't you don't understand us please go and she had an aunt and uncle\n\n29:12.920 --> 29:21.240\nsummering in Paris so she went there so you so now it says French-born American\n\n29:21.240 --> 29:26.880\nactress which makes me sound like you know like I'm Juliet Benoche but it's\n\n29:26.880 --> 29:32.240\nnothing like that it's not at all like that it's so overstated and you described\n\n29:32.240 --> 29:38.440\nlike being teased for your voice yeah yeah by friends and family alike it's I\n\n29:38.440 --> 29:43.040\nthink your quote was it's basically been the same since I was six yes there it\n\n29:43.040 --> 29:48.520\njust didn't change like to what extent was that I mean what was that really like\n\n29:48.520 --> 29:54.080\ndid you have moments of like whatever the vocal equivalent of looking in a\n\n29:54.080 --> 29:58.600\nmirror was and like wishing like like like like what's the vocal equivalent of\n\n29:58.600 --> 30:02.040\npatting the bra what's the vocal equivalent of like god damn it changed\n\n30:02.040 --> 30:10.280\nmy voice or were you like fuck this I can't be ashamed of this I think I think\n\n30:10.280 --> 30:15.000\nI just didn't really excuse me I didn't really think that there was anything that\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:22.920\nwould stop me from ruling the world I just but I also didn't think that I my\n\n30:22.920 --> 30:27.600\nvoice would ever be my fortune so voiceover was never on the menu in terms\n\n30:27.600 --> 30:32.440\nof how I was going to rule the world so when people say when you got the\n\n30:32.440 --> 30:35.640\nSimpsons that must have been fantastic I was like I don't really care about\n\n30:35.640 --> 30:39.840\nvoiceover it just I didn't like it just didn't even register and didn't\n\n30:39.840 --> 30:44.960\nregister for a really long time because I think I it just it had never I never\n\n30:44.960 --> 30:50.040\nconsidered it an asset and I so I didn't have a voiceover agent it just was like\n\n30:50.040 --> 30:55.800\nthat's not how it's good that's not how I'm gonna win so whatever nobody ever\n\n30:55.800 --> 31:00.000\ncame up to you said you should be in voiceover with a no really what do you\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:04.800\nattribute this like the negative word would be narcissism although I don't\n\n31:04.800 --> 31:09.480\ncall it negative like the idea that you're assuming like that your parents\n\n31:09.480 --> 31:12.720\nweren't actors they weren't directors they weren't I think your dad was a\n\n31:12.720 --> 31:18.480\ncorrespondent or yes he was a newspaper man and like these people weren't telling\n\n31:18.480 --> 31:23.040\nyou oh Yardley you got to be an actor no but you're thinking your head one way\n\n31:23.040 --> 31:28.240\nor another I'm gonna dominate yes what do you ever have you thought does that\n\n31:28.240 --> 31:32.160\ncome from nature or nurture is what we all want to know what the fuck is wrong\n\n31:32.160 --> 31:37.520\nwith you no are you kidding we want to know how do I how do I manufacture this\n\n31:37.520 --> 31:43.600\ndo I have to be born right or do I have to just think it and fucking do it it's\n\n31:43.600 --> 31:52.880\na good question I don't remember a time well I think there it's two sides of\n\n31:52.880 --> 32:01.880\nthe same coin so I remember being afraid of everything and so it wasn't that I\n\n32:01.880 --> 32:08.200\nwas fearless it was that I had this overabundance of courage and if I did\n\n32:08.200 --> 32:13.000\ninsurmountable in the face of extraordinary insecurity yeah because\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:18.880\nyou're not gonna you're not gonna punch somebody no and I was small I mean I\n\n32:18.880 --> 32:28.000\nwas just I was a little kid and I had this tiny tiny voice and and I and yet\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:34.200\nI had if there was a ferocity to me and so but I also and I always felt a little\n\n32:34.200 --> 32:40.520\nbit like I didn't belong and I remember being about five years old and there was\n\n32:40.520 --> 32:43.640\na woman in my neighborhood in Washington DC where I grew up and she used to\n\n32:43.640 --> 32:48.320\nhave this theater in the summers she had a one-car garage and she would get all\n\n32:48.320 --> 32:52.940\nthe kids together and and she would make us lip-sync to musicals like the\n\n32:52.940 --> 32:56.680\nSound of Music and Fiddler on the Roof and she would dress us up and she would\n\n32:56.680 --> 33:01.200\nalso do these things like living portraits right and so I was a portrait\n\n33:01.200 --> 33:06.040\nof Mary that Mary Cassatt did this American artist and I was this it was\n\n33:06.040 --> 33:10.760\nlittle girl in straw hat so music was playing I remember my knees were knocking\n\n33:10.760 --> 33:16.480\nand there was a curtain and the curtain drew back and as soon as the light hit\n\n33:16.480 --> 33:25.360\nme my knees stopped knocking and I thought like oh okay I think I'll be\n\n33:25.360 --> 33:31.080\nalright here and and I just sort of I think I just felt like I belong and\n\n33:31.080 --> 33:35.120\nthen after that I started to do plays and the great thing about doing a play\n\n33:35.120 --> 33:40.600\nwas even if it had a sad ending I knew how it ended and I could prepare for it\n\n33:40.600 --> 33:46.480\nit was like predicting the future yeah and so that and managing your\n\n33:46.480 --> 33:51.200\nrelationship with yes other people and it can either be your tormentor yes they\n\n33:51.200 --> 33:55.000\ncan sit the fuck down and watch you you knew it was gonna happen and did you\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:58.880\nhave the same because I did theaters a kid and stuff and I've always felt very\n\n33:58.880 --> 34:02.480\ncomfortable in theater did you did you get the same comfort backstage with the\n\n34:02.480 --> 34:06.760\ncast and the you know the crew and all that did you get the same kind of there's\n\n34:06.760 --> 34:11.320\nthat is that kind of familial very yes and I loved the relationship with the\n\n34:11.320 --> 34:18.320\naudience that exchange of energy was was extraordinary and it was really\n\n34:18.320 --> 34:24.160\npowerful and I remember my first play in my first like real play we did I\n\n34:24.160 --> 34:27.840\nremember mama and I played the youngest daughter and my very first line I got\n\n34:27.840 --> 34:32.520\nthis huge laugh and I remember how powerful that was and I just thought all\n\n34:32.520 --> 34:35.880\nright do you remember it changing the dynamic in your social structure was\n\n34:35.880 --> 34:40.160\nthere a moment when you were because I remember being a dork and stinky and\n\n34:40.160 --> 34:46.920\nboy did that change but but there was there was a certain there was a shift I\n\n34:46.920 --> 34:51.120\ndon't I don't have a dramatic moment of it but I was very much not gonna stop\n\n34:51.120 --> 34:56.960\ndoing drama club and improv classes because of do you remember did it change\n\n34:56.960 --> 35:01.480\nthe dynamic of your whole world did you go up on stage and do a thing and then\n\n35:01.480 --> 35:05.160\nthe next day at school because I'm trying to place you in like a hallway or\n\n35:05.160 --> 35:14.520\nsomething yes you know I my theory is my experience was for the most part people\n\n35:14.520 --> 35:24.040\nwere really happy and excited that I had clearly sort of I'd done really well and\n\n35:24.040 --> 35:30.600\nfor lack of a better word I had sort of cast a spell to the extent that even\n\n35:30.600 --> 35:34.880\ntheir own parents had come up and been like what that was amazing right but\n\n35:34.880 --> 35:40.120\nalso there were always kids who were not happy for you and I feel like any time\n\n35:40.120 --> 35:45.320\nas a young person and even as a grown-up I suppose but particularly hard when\n\n35:45.320 --> 35:49.920\nyou're a kid you do something really well it sets you sets you apart from your\n\n35:49.920 --> 35:55.200\npeer group so if you're good at math or sports or drama or anything it sets you\n\n35:55.200 --> 35:59.560\napart and that can be really isolating and actually I and so I don't know if\n\n35:59.560 --> 36:04.560\nI'm reading into this but it it sets you apart actually more profoundly from the\n\n36:04.560 --> 36:07.920\npeople that were might have been closer to you had you stayed in your shell\n\n36:07.920 --> 36:11.840\nsure then it does the quarterback of the football team and the head cheerleader\n\n36:11.840 --> 36:15.960\nwho are who are very content to go hey how about that yardly I had no problem\n\n36:15.960 --> 36:19.800\nwith her before totally ignored her now very happy to give her the high school\n\n36:19.800 --> 36:24.520\nequivalent of best supporting actor like they become your biggest fan right they\n\n36:24.520 --> 36:28.840\ncan they can comfortably make that shift and somebody that maybe you bonded\n\n36:28.840 --> 36:34.600\nwith in the bathroom and cried with about how hard it feels to be alienated\n\n36:34.600 --> 36:39.560\nthat may become a person that you actually hurt they they can feel left\n\n36:39.560 --> 36:45.200\nbehind even though you had no intention of leaving them behind you only got an\n\n36:45.200 --> 36:50.640\nintention of dominating the world you got no time to think about come be in my\n\n36:50.640 --> 37:01.120\nworld okay so let me dominate you I am a kind ruler I am a good kind ruler are\n\n37:01.120 --> 37:06.520\nyou are you really we don't know this yet we get we'll fast forward in a second\n\n37:06.520 --> 37:11.320\nto like I mean but but I do want to dwell here for a second and just ask like\n\n37:11.320 --> 37:16.360\nwhat was the dynamic with the family because they weren't actors they weren't\n\n37:16.360 --> 37:20.760\nfilmmakers they weren't did they have expectations of you were you letting them\n\n37:20.760 --> 37:32.680\ndown when they suddenly realized that I want to perform I don't know that I well\n\n37:32.680 --> 37:39.760\nI think I think they were probably a bit worried that you were gonna live at home\n\n37:39.760 --> 37:45.160\nfor a longer time than a doctor forever that it might not work out the way I\n\n37:45.160 --> 37:48.880\nhad planned because they didn't really have a plan what's your plan Yardley I'm\n\n37:48.880 --> 37:52.200\njust gonna I'm gonna rule the world that's great the medical industry like\n\n37:52.200 --> 37:56.600\nlaid it out in a brochure exactly your daughter will in six years be a\n\n37:56.600 --> 38:00.880\nregistered blue baby blue right there there was no you know how are you gonna\n\n38:00.880 --> 38:21.960\nget there but you know in our family I feel like compliments were implied\n\n38:21.960 --> 38:29.640\nexcellence was expected because it's a fucking beautiful way of describing the\n\n38:29.640 --> 38:35.480\nMidwest I was like wow I wish I could be that gracious let it going like me\n\n38:35.480 --> 38:43.160\nfucking beard suck bro compliments are implied yeah it was just you know there\n\n38:43.160 --> 38:48.640\nwasn't it wasn't well I would say other kind of person needs a compliment the\n\n38:48.640 --> 38:53.800\nanswer is someone who doesn't deserve one that's the Midwestern philosophy you\n\n38:53.800 --> 38:58.280\ndon't you don't plug an air hose into a person with a hole in their air supply\n\n38:58.280 --> 39:07.200\nit's not healthy yeah it was um it which is I think part of the you know the flip\n\n39:07.200 --> 39:12.200\nside of the coin and part of the insecurity of wanting to sort of get a\n\n39:12.200 --> 39:20.040\nkind of global love global recognition excuse me to make up for this kind of\n\n39:20.040 --> 39:25.800\nfor this hole and I have spoken people say like oh Yardley you know I joke\n\n39:25.800 --> 39:29.880\nsometimes like if I was more like this I would be more successful and they're\n\n39:29.880 --> 39:34.560\nlike shut the fuck up you're so you are so successful and how can you say that\n\n39:34.560 --> 39:38.440\nand there is this feeling inside if you really really want to get granular about\n\n39:38.440 --> 39:48.080\nit that if I if I felt truly successful then this this kind of forever hole\n\n39:48.080 --> 39:53.760\ninside would feel filled but the truth of the matter is is that you can't fill\n\n39:53.760 --> 39:57.840\nup the inside from the outside and that's what my one-woman show was about\n\n39:57.840 --> 40:09.120\nshe's talking to black woman shit tonight very impressive I think it's\n\n40:09.120 --> 40:13.080\nimportant to note here for cynics and things because I mean I think the when\n\n40:13.080 --> 40:17.800\nyou take a deep dive and you really bother to think about it and the Simpsons\n\n40:17.800 --> 40:25.360\nwhich has been on the air longer than the Bible it and we'll go I mean well\n\n40:25.360 --> 40:29.760\nobviously it's like we should talk about like those first moments of\n\n40:29.760 --> 40:34.920\nauditioning and things but like I it's it's important to note that like\n\n40:34.920 --> 40:39.200\neverybody who knows anything about that show and why it's successful why you\n\n40:39.200 --> 40:45.200\nhave an Emmy which you I saw on the internet you you don't believe is real\n\n40:45.200 --> 40:51.840\nI do now but it didn't closet for nine years but like it that that show in\n\n40:51.840 --> 40:55.320\ngeneral every performer on that show I kind of collectively everybody that\n\n40:55.320 --> 41:01.920\nworked on that show I mean it was it was an animated show that it I think your\n\n41:01.920 --> 41:08.600\nyour your portrayal like a it exemplifies the fact like there's a\n\n41:08.600 --> 41:13.160\nlot of quotes from grain egg and from editors and directors casting directors\n\n41:13.160 --> 41:18.280\nfriends of yours and things that are kind of like yeah she didn't like it who\n\n41:18.280 --> 41:23.040\nknows flukeity fluke who knows how you end up being the voice of a cartoon but\n\n41:23.040 --> 41:27.080\nlike the important thing about that cartoon and the reason why it's now in\n\n41:27.080 --> 41:34.480\nits 60th season is because of this weird blend of grounded dramatic\n\n41:34.480 --> 41:42.800\nperformance and cartoonishly accessible voices I got I mean you're being drawn\n\n41:42.800 --> 41:50.120\nand so it's like yeah so I just wanted to take that detour for a second in case\n\n41:50.120 --> 41:54.520\nanybody like in the audience is like listening to our our path through your\n\n41:54.520 --> 41:59.000\ncareer and going like what the fuck man whatever you show up for an audition you\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:02.400\ngot a squeaky voice you end up like the voice of a thing it's like no this is\n\n42:02.400 --> 42:06.280\nnot like this there are there are no flukes here and in fact what you're\n\n42:06.280 --> 42:10.760\ndescribing is actually kind of like something that you're not allowed to own\n\n42:10.760 --> 42:16.040\nas a person which is this what if of like yeah but what if I mean I was\n\n42:16.040 --> 42:19.840\ndesigned for world domination and I fucking dominated it through the most\n\n42:19.840 --> 42:25.960\nrandom channel what if what if that channel hadn't been there I might have\n\n42:25.960 --> 42:30.000\nbeen a senator I might have been I don't know like like and I won't put you on\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:35.200\nthe spot with that but I just wanted to drunkenly disrupt everything\n\n42:35.200 --> 42:40.720\nearly Dan and I were friends with Sam Simon and I was talking about the early\n\n42:40.720 --> 42:45.120\ndays of that and he was talking about how he didn't like the way it changed\n\n42:45.120 --> 42:50.720\nafter so many seasons and you know because he's Sam and he you know he left\n\n42:50.720 --> 42:54.920\nafter what two seasons or something like that three or four I guess but he was\n\n42:54.920 --> 42:59.680\ntalking about it and I remember him saying that like going down the list of\n\n42:59.680 --> 43:03.840\nthe cast of characters what Bart is what Homer is what Marge is and he said Lisa\n\n43:03.840 --> 43:07.800\nis the conscience of the show yes and that's why Lisa is the one that makes\n\n43:07.800 --> 43:11.760\nyou cry yeah yeah that's great well these amazing episodes the Homer's\n\n43:11.760 --> 43:16.240\ncrayon one I mean I'm I'm not gonna pretend I've watched all 700,000\n\n43:16.240 --> 43:22.040\nepisodes of The Simpsons but I I mean the I understand why your performance got\n\n43:22.040 --> 43:26.960\na voice over Emmy I died you you said you accept it now you definitely need to\n\n43:26.960 --> 43:30.640\naccept it I'm taking my two Emmys I got one for writing the Oscars that's\n\n43:30.640 --> 43:38.880\ncheating it's the most watched thing and ever of course you got an Emmy you\n\n43:38.880 --> 43:46.300\nwrote the Oscars that's right bitch and now I got a statue that says I'm\n\n43:46.300 --> 43:55.760\ntalented so now I am you however earned it so so let's I mean so you go to New\n\n43:55.760 --> 43:59.200\nYork you do the Mike Nichols thing there's a I think one of your first jobs\n\n43:59.200 --> 44:04.640\nis maximum overdrive I like you you said something amazing about it in your\n\n44:04.640 --> 44:13.320\nWikipedia page good don't don't sustain your applause like you had a quote in\n\n44:13.320 --> 44:17.600\nthe quote trickled down to your Wikipedia which is those exactly what those\n\n44:17.600 --> 44:22.920\npeople are thinking which was something like truly dreadful movie but a\n\n44:22.920 --> 44:29.640\nfantastic role it was it was a bomb when it came out I've been in several of\n\n44:29.640 --> 44:35.960\nthose but the great thing about the early 80s so I think I so I also did a\n\n44:35.960 --> 44:40.720\nmovie called the legend of Billy Jean right yes Queen I think the kids say\n\n44:40.720 --> 44:45.920\nnow yes that's what they say so I my first movie was a movie called heaven\n\n44:45.920 --> 44:52.440\nhelp us that was in 1984 would know what heaven help us everybody was in that\n\n44:52.440 --> 44:59.800\nmovie Andrew McCarthy Patrick Dempsey Kevin Dillon Mary Stuart Masterson\n\n44:59.800 --> 45:03.680\nokay but what was Donald Sutherland what was the plot it was about a Catholic\n\n45:03.680 --> 45:08.280\nboys school in the 1960s it was sort of about it originally it was actually a\n\n45:08.280 --> 45:12.760\nquite serious script about the corporal punishment that goes on in a boys school\n\n45:12.760 --> 45:16.600\nin Catholic boys school in the 60s and then by the time they were done with it\n\n45:16.600 --> 45:20.320\nit was more like porkies goes to Catholic school I know I've seen this for\n\n45:20.320 --> 45:24.560\nsure so that wasn't and it was directed by Michael dinner who then went on to\n\n45:24.560 --> 45:28.840\nmake a dinner sorry just a fun name\n\n45:28.840 --> 45:42.200\nhe went on to create the wonder you can call him Ray I actively sabotage\n\n45:42.200 --> 45:46.120\nmyself as a podcast like it's a great episode you're on it keep talking\n\n45:46.120 --> 45:54.360\nplease I'm so sorry no it's fine it's all good so so after that I did the\n\n45:54.360 --> 45:59.840\nlegend of Billy Jean Helen Slater was yes and Christian Slater not related\n\n45:59.840 --> 46:05.760\nalthough they play brother and sister so weird I know it's super weird they look\n\n46:05.760 --> 46:10.400\nkind of alike because they both you know they dyed his hair blonde and but any\n\n46:10.400 --> 46:15.280\nwho not related and that movie was such a bomb was barely out long enough to run\n\n46:15.280 --> 46:22.800\nthe end credits but what was great was was 1985 and cable television had just\n\n46:22.800 --> 46:27.360\ncome on the scene and they didn't have anything so they ran that fucking thing\n\n46:27.360 --> 46:33.720\nad nauseam I was 24-7 and it is now this huge cult classic which I was just\n\n46:33.720 --> 46:39.680\ngonna say like same as a drive oh but they then the same and when the WGA\n\n46:39.680 --> 46:44.080\nnegotiates with the PGA the the professional professional golfers\n\n46:44.080 --> 46:49.920\nassociation like they talk about these windows and things like and it's like it\n\n46:49.920 --> 46:55.240\nall has to do with like when we were kids and I was like why do I think up the\n\n46:55.240 --> 47:00.960\ncreek was such a classic well because you saw it 75 thousand times I watched\n\n47:00.960 --> 47:08.640\ncrawl for like two years that was all that was the only thing that was on but\n\n47:08.640 --> 47:13.800\nthat's also like the original Star Trek series yes similar paradigm like they\n\n47:13.800 --> 47:18.320\ndidn't they got canceled right out of the gate yes and then it was just such a\n\n47:18.320 --> 47:23.800\nsuccess in syndication it's like I think that's always a TV writer producers\n\n47:23.800 --> 47:28.680\nlike you you early on you have that conflict where you see your numbers or\n\n47:28.680 --> 47:33.120\nwhatever someone tells you you failed on Thursday night you fucked up you didn't\n\n47:33.120 --> 47:37.920\ndo good what do you mean it into good well the hammer you hit the things slid\n\n47:37.920 --> 47:42.560\nup and it didn't hit the bell that says you're a muscle man and which means\n\n47:42.560 --> 47:48.200\nretaining the offices numbers by 90% or higher and you're like I always I mean I\n\n47:48.200 --> 47:53.760\nit was it was such a late motif back then where it was like oh give me a break if\n\n47:53.760 --> 47:57.080\nyou just mark at the show better or give us a better time slot these people only\n\n47:57.080 --> 48:01.880\nlike what you tell them to kind of catch yourself in that moment going like\n\n48:01.880 --> 48:07.280\nwait what do I believe in at all right I do do I believe in like making a thing\n\n48:07.280 --> 48:10.440\nthis is what this is not what this interview should be about let's let's\n\n48:10.440 --> 48:13.720\nlet's go back to the legend of Billie Jean which is a fantastic fucking movie\n\n48:13.720 --> 48:19.400\nthat is inspired so many no it's terrible it's awful and so is Goonies and\n\n48:19.400 --> 48:23.120\nsuddenly like there's so many fucking movies that people think are good they\n\n48:23.120 --> 48:28.800\njust fucking suck but what is it what is a good movies job it's to be there but\n\n48:28.800 --> 48:34.840\nI okay it's to be there when you're going through puberty you're just like\n\n48:34.840 --> 48:41.360\ndrinking up and you're like I'm coming looking at talking trucks transformers are amazing\n\n48:41.360 --> 48:48.640\nfair enough I mean people really did for whatever reason it was it was a movie\n\n48:48.640 --> 48:51.640\nthat people really loved and I get recognized for it about once a week\n\n48:51.640 --> 48:56.240\nBillie Jean legend and maximum overdrive but mostly I think because I look\n\n48:56.240 --> 49:00.200\nexactly the same I am one of those people if you saw a picture of me when I\n\n49:00.200 --> 49:05.400\nwas four you'd go hardly that's you you are super memorable and I sound the same\n\n49:05.400 --> 49:11.440\nyeah pretty much and this is me and this is Lisa Simpson she raises her voice\n\n49:11.440 --> 49:18.240\na little bit sorry one thing about that though because that's important\n\n49:18.240 --> 49:21.840\nbecause one one very sage thing that you said I don't know when you learned it\n\n49:21.840 --> 49:27.600\nwhen you look back here I think around that time you said so much better tip to\n\n49:27.600 --> 49:34.960\nhave a tiny role in a in a giant movie than to wait for the lead role in\n\n49:34.960 --> 49:39.800\nsomething that yeah like like like it's you can occupy that real estate by being\n\n49:39.800 --> 49:46.320\nyourself not yourself you're not those characters but being check you know is I\n\n49:46.320 --> 49:50.400\nmean it is there is that old saying you know it's not the size of the role it is\n\n49:50.400 --> 49:57.720\nit's this size and skill of the actor right but I do believe that for the most\n\n49:57.720 --> 50:03.200\npart with very few exceptions you can do a lot with not very much on the page\n\n50:03.200 --> 50:10.280\nright and so I was pretty much game for anything I have to ask like so because\n\n50:10.280 --> 50:14.920\nyour director on maximum overdrive was literally Stephen King yes who was\n\n50:14.920 --> 50:20.600\ncoming off of I believe as legend have it has it he's like he hated Kubrick's\n\n50:20.600 --> 50:27.040\nthe shining yeah he's like god damn it what a shitty version of the shining if\n\n50:27.040 --> 50:33.280\nI Stephen King who wrote all these books if they just let me run the camera I'd\n\n50:33.280 --> 50:41.280\ngive them what for yeah I'm not I mean I he's a fucking hero and I don't mean to\n\n50:41.280 --> 50:47.520\npiss but but like I I also watching that movie you're like well Kubrick also is\n\n50:47.520 --> 50:53.400\nan important person maybe it's an honor that you know maximum overdrive also was\n\n50:53.400 --> 51:05.000\na 12-page short story it's just like I mean age 11 I was born in Maine I'm gonna\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:09.040\ndie there I fucking have in the time of my life and my typewriter lost its\n\n51:09.040 --> 51:15.160\nbackspace key amen amen sorry I'm a little jealous but but but how was he\n\n51:15.160 --> 51:18.880\nas a director on set like as a person like as a supporter he was lovely as pie\n\n51:18.880 --> 51:23.080\nas a person but apparently was also at the height of his alcoholism and drug\n\n51:23.080 --> 51:30.080\naddiction I love him so much oh my god so it was absolute chaos and we had so\n\n51:30.080 --> 51:35.200\nDina De Laurentis was the was the production company so we had a pretty\n\n51:35.200 --> 51:40.840\nmuch all Italian crew who literally didn't speak English so we had Stephen\n\n51:40.840 --> 51:45.480\nwho doesn't speak Italian and we had a translator I'm not even kidding we must\n\n51:45.480 --> 51:50.400\nhave added I don't know two weeks in translation alone as he would say this\n\n51:50.400 --> 51:55.160\nis what I'd like to do in the translator labor to Italians the Italians would\n\n51:55.160 --> 51:58.320\nlet him talk to the guy and the guy would then talk to Steve I'm like oh my\n\n51:58.320 --> 52:02.760\nfucking god and it just went on back and forth like that and he you know to his\n\n52:02.760 --> 52:08.240\nenormous credit he was very humble and said I I don't know what I'm doing and\n\n52:08.240 --> 52:13.200\nso they positioned people around him who did know what they were doing but they\n\n52:13.200 --> 52:17.640\nalso didn't speak the language so it was quite cumbersome and Dino De Laurentis\n\n52:17.640 --> 52:22.240\nyou know it was at the time when we and Canon films also was of the same sort of\n\n52:22.240 --> 52:27.600\nilk where they just did everything on the cheap and when the you know the the\n\n52:27.600 --> 52:33.160\ntail hit five million that was the budget all right the truck put the people\n\n52:33.160 --> 52:40.080\nout calling AC DC yes done thanks for coming so it was an adventure and I\n\n52:40.080 --> 52:44.760\nactually remember there's a scene where the truck drives through the diner side\n\n52:44.760 --> 52:50.360\nwall the window picture window they had one opportunity to do that they built\n\n52:50.360 --> 52:55.080\nthat truck stop and they they didn't have a stunt double for me and they said\n\n52:55.080 --> 53:00.680\nYardley you're gonna stand there and the car this Cadillac is gonna drive through\n\n53:00.680 --> 53:05.280\nthe wall don't worry it's gonna go super slow and it's gonna be so easy and safe\n\n53:05.280 --> 53:09.760\nand don't move until we tell you because we only have one shot at this and I'm\n\n53:09.760 --> 53:17.320\nlike okay so you know I'm like okay so I do that and I'm not kidding you that\n\n53:17.320 --> 53:24.400\nfucking thing was going like 20 miles an hour it went so fast and it just plows\n\n53:24.400 --> 53:36.280\nthrough this wall and I am and finally I'm just like why don't you put someone in\n\n53:36.280 --> 53:43.000\na way the shot is from behind me or it's no good or it's a shot of a car coming\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:49.080\ntoward me shoot the fucking car I had so much hair you can't even see my face so\n\n53:49.080 --> 53:53.200\nyeah glass everywhere in my hair the whole thing yeah it was an adventure\n\n53:53.200 --> 53:57.800\nwas it a CDC who made who was it did they write that for the movie or is that\n\n53:57.800 --> 54:02.440\none of their songs I was hoping you'd know I don't know I bet you I bet they\n\n54:02.440 --> 54:05.120\nwrote it for the movie I'm sure they would I'm always so curious about that\n\n54:05.120 --> 54:10.560\nwhen there's like an 80s movie and it's like goblin dicks nine there's like a\n\n54:10.560 --> 54:15.120\nkind of a pseudo famous like band but it's like but this title of the song\n\n54:15.120 --> 54:21.240\nisn't goblin dicks it's like like my heart's like a goblin and you're kind of\n\n54:21.240 --> 54:26.400\nlike are you just being classy or did they like how does this conversation\n\n54:26.400 --> 54:31.440\nwith all the nightmare and elm street docking like good yeah well nightmare\n\n54:31.440 --> 54:36.840\non elm street franchise I is has sucked in some of our world's greatest talent\n\n54:36.840 --> 54:44.920\nwill smith will never escape like like the fat boys were got got drawn in do\n\n54:44.920 --> 54:48.840\nyou know they wrote the they wrote the ghostbusters theme song before the movie\n\n54:48.840 --> 54:54.600\nthe fat boys really Ray Parker Jr. Oh wait they had the ghostbusters song and\n\n54:54.600 --> 54:57.760\nthen they were like we got to write a movie around this song\n\n54:57.760 --> 55:03.120\nis that true I don't know what your joke is I'm too drunk to follow your joke I\n\n55:03.120 --> 55:11.280\njust wanted to be included sorry so I told her Ray Parker Jr. lie by the way\n\n55:11.280 --> 55:16.120\nBrandon's been been a voice on the Simpsons for the last 35 years we wanted\n\n55:16.120 --> 55:26.800\nto find out if you knew I'm a stand-in for Hibbert who does dr. Hibbert who\n\n55:26.800 --> 55:37.200\nis the Harry that's the Harry Shira yes I take it this is a unexpected\n\n55:37.200 --> 55:46.040\npregnancy characters fantastic that's such a when I moved to LA we would watch\n\n55:46.040 --> 55:49.000\nit and sit occasion with God damn you don't get funnier than this this is\n\n55:49.000 --> 55:54.200\ncrazy when you guys all right when you were doing the start of on the Tracy\n\n55:54.200 --> 55:57.840\nAlmond show yes and you guys do the little kind of in and out of commercials\n\n55:57.840 --> 56:02.760\nand stuff like that when you were doing that like how serious to that obviously\n\n56:02.760 --> 56:05.760\nyou could have no idea what the future would be hold would hold for that show\n\n56:05.760 --> 56:09.960\nbut I what was that like doing those little those little bits it was I\n\n56:09.960 --> 56:18.000\nremember so I got the job because I had done a play at the Fountain Theater here\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:25.320\nin LA that I think literally 17 people saw but one of those people a year later\n\n56:25.320 --> 56:30.800\nwould cast the Simpsons on the Tracy Almond show so when people ask me how\n\n56:30.800 --> 56:34.720\ndo I get into voiceover I'm like you're it's like asking me to solve your\n\n56:34.720 --> 56:40.040\ncalculus program you know problem with an abacus I don't know because it I did\n\n56:40.040 --> 56:44.440\nit so it just was so odd for me it just didn't happen the way it usually happens\n\n56:44.440 --> 56:49.360\nso I went in to read and I originally read for Bart but that really lasted\n\n56:49.360 --> 56:54.760\nmere seconds and then and Nancy was there that day as well and she read for\n\n56:54.760 --> 57:00.200\nLisa but she always wanted to read for Bart and she she did voiceover already\n\n57:00.200 --> 57:05.480\nlike she was already an expert she was already doing cartoons and so I then\n\n57:05.480 --> 57:10.720\nread for Lisa had you not done a cartoon before oh no yeah no I again like\n\n57:10.720 --> 57:15.040\nvoiceover I was like who I don't I don't care about voiceover but I was not an\n\n57:15.040 --> 57:20.680\nactor who ever said no to an audition so I you know I was like alright fine I'll\n\n57:20.680 --> 57:25.880\ngo as long as it doesn't get in my way of world domination I'm good let's do this\n\n57:25.880 --> 57:30.320\nbecause it's a choice gig if you can do it there's no coming your pajamas you can\n\n57:30.320 --> 57:36.200\nlike right but you know that thing people people do ask me that they're like\n\n57:36.200 --> 57:44.600\ndo you gotta work in your pajamas like do you oh sorry well I do I but I got\n\n57:44.600 --> 57:50.080\nfired shortly after I did I did eventually the minute I thought it was\n\n57:50.080 --> 57:57.680\npossible I started doing it and then I got fired you know it it poses it raises\n\n57:57.680 --> 58:03.760\nmore questions than it's a good point it's a very good point how close to to\n\n58:03.760 --> 58:10.360\nLisa as we know it was your audition was it I think actually I I sounded more\n\n58:10.360 --> 58:16.520\nlike myself in the beginning and then as as the characters got cuter as the\n\n58:16.520 --> 58:21.800\nanimation got cuter her voice got a little bit cuter you know it got it\n\n58:21.800 --> 58:25.640\nmorphed a little bit but not that much and what's interesting and a little bit\n\n58:25.640 --> 58:31.760\nsad and I'll let you in on a on a heartbreak a little bit so they finally\n\n58:31.760 --> 58:40.120\nfinally I I I stumped for one of our phenomenal actresses Tress McNeil who\n\n58:40.120 --> 58:47.560\ndoes Crazy Cat Lady and Mrs. Skinner and Cookie Kwan and like any number of this\n\n58:47.560 --> 58:51.040\nshe doesn't she's not doesn't do one of the family members but she does any\n\n58:51.040 --> 58:57.560\nnumber of the cast in Springfield and she does Shauna the the girlfriend of one\n\n58:57.560 --> 59:03.240\nof the bullies who talks like this you know she's this valley girl and so\n\n59:03.240 --> 59:08.200\nTress wasn't at the read-through one day and I they said hardly why don't you do\n\n59:08.200 --> 59:12.320\nit so I said oh great I'll do it so it was really strong and they really loved\n\n59:12.320 --> 59:18.120\nit so the next couple of weeks they wrote a valley girl kind of friend for\n\n59:18.120 --> 59:26.320\nLisa Simpson and the problem was is that if you ask me to do another character\n\n59:26.320 --> 59:31.880\nwho's the same age as Lisa Simpson I don't have the ability to make the voice\n\n59:31.880 --> 59:37.320\ndifferent enough to make it not sound like Lisa Simpson the difference in\n\n59:37.320 --> 59:43.560\ndoing Lisa Simpson and Shauna is that Shauna is like 16 so that worked and so\n\n59:43.560 --> 59:47.760\nwe recorded it and then I got an email from the producer saying I'm sorry\n\n59:47.760 --> 59:54.680\nhardly it's not different enough we're cutting it I'm like fuck dude I mean it's\n\n59:54.680 --> 01:00:01.320\nterrible so I really am a one-trick pony there you go who's the rangiest Harry\n\n01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:06.080\nprobably or oh I don't know Hank Dan and Harry I would say all three of them\n\n01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:09.880\nreally neck and neck to watch those guys go from voice to voice to voice it\n\n01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:15.480\nnever gets old like we me so Hank lives in New York Harry lives all over the\n\n01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:20.560\nworld so Dan Julie me and Nancy all record all together and Tress is there\n\n01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:26.720\noften as well and to watch those guys go all of them do multiple voices and I\n\n01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:30.920\njust I stand between them I stand between Nancy and Dan oh is that true yeah\n\n01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:33.880\nand never gets old you guys all you if you're doing a scene you're all\n\n01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:37.040\nphysically in the room like an old radio play even if even if Harry or\n\n01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:42.400\nwhoever is out yeah he'll actually somebody will tempt for him and then\n\n01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:46.880\nhe'll do his stuff on his own but I've always wondered are you physically in\n\n01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:51.280\nthe room together is it all just wild stuff alone no we're all together in\n\n01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:55.160\nthe room that's gotta be important that's gotta make it gives it a really\n\n01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:58.440\ndifferent texture I mean because obviously the way you say something is\n\n01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:03.120\ngoing to inform the way I answer and I think you know Jim Brooks James L. Brooks\n\n01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:09.760\nour executive producer he comes from sitcoms and so when we first started\n\n01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:13.600\ndoing the bumpers as you were asking I think he was like I don't know why this\n\n01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:17.480\nwould be any different it doesn't matter to me that nobody can see you it's\n\n01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:21.720\nstill a conversation of course you'll all be together right and so while most\n\n01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:26.360\ncartoons do do it separately like when we did that crossover with Family Guy I\n\n01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:31.200\nwent and did all my stuff by myself I didn't meet Mila Kunis even though my\n\n01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:35.760\nscenes were with Meg I just they did all my stuff wild with which I can do of\n\n01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:38.640\ncourse I know the character well enough you thought maybe when you're watching it\n\n01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.840\nlike it's not as fun you know I'd much rather do my stuff with the person I never\n\n01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.640\nwould have thought to ask you that question that's how much I would have\n\n01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:49.640\nassumed yes I think everybody does I would have thought I've been high I\n\n01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.480\nwould be high-roading you to be like well you guys aren't in the room together\n\n01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:57.760\nit's it's it's exciting to me that that's how they do it after all this year\n\n01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:01.600\nall these years it's still that way yes because it's pretty yeah from a\n\n01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:07.080\nproduction standpoint it is needlessly extravagant you're talking about actors\n\n01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:10.720\nschedules it's much easier to treat human beings like cattle shuffle them in\n\n01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:14.880\none at a time isolate all of them way less chance of anything uncontrollable\n\n01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:20.320\nhappening it's the way I just feel like you know it's my job and so you own me\n\n01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:26.240\nso all right I'll show up but the way we did anomalies the way we did the\n\n01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:29.880\nobids uncontrollable Christmas because we were doing like special things we were\n\n01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:35.120\nabsolutely like nope soundstage entire cast everyone's like well this is gonna\n\n01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:39.400\nbe terribly problematic if this person interrupts that person over like yeah but\n\n01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:46.320\nI so I I think that's tremendously commendable I I wasn't I was a Simpson I\n\n01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:51.640\nhad a little part I did a little cameo and I went into the place where you guys\n\n01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:58.880\nrecord and I saw multiple microphones we do we do you know sadly our guest stars\n\n01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:03.040\ndon't usually come and record with us mostly because their schedules don't\n\n01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:08.360\npermit it it would have made me puke blood I would have been able to hand I\n\n01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:16.600\nwas it was just perfect I think I think it's that's the way you want to thank\n\n01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.840\nyou for coming and not true treat you like the most important person you don't\n\n01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:23.200\nwant to I know I'm telling you it's true the customer is always right I did not\n\n01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:34.600\nwant to be there with you I would have freaked out no I don't know okay so like\n\n01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.800\na banana peels and stoplights you end up in the longest running sitcom in\n\n01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:43.440\ntelevision fucking history yes along the way also though in the 90s like like\n\n01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:51.160\nyou like like like Herman's head what else was there don't hold your Herman's\n\n01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:57.560\nhead applause were you were you I was a devotee of Herman's head however I'm\n\n01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:00.680\nalso an alcoholic so I can't remember if you were actually inside Herman's head\n\n01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:05.720\nor not no I was in the office you were the you were the the boof to Herman's\n\n01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:11.000\nTeen Wolf you were that you were the boof well okay that's my language for you\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:17.360\nwere the best friend yeah you were the the will they won't they I was yes in a\n\n01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:21.040\nlong term the Winnie Cooper the are not the Winnie Cooper it was so dumb I was\n\n01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:25.280\nlike yes it was like like like like like we were supposed to if that show\n\n01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:28.760\nlasted more than eight episodes we were supposed to I think eventually be like\n\n01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:34.080\ngo to her right and then he did right I so Louie my character's name was Louise\n\n01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:40.400\nshe was really great fun and I was this sort of breakout character and they\n\n01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:44.960\nwrote so I was like got some in each show I got always a really good funny joke\n\n01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:50.920\nwhich I very much enjoyed and but then for some peculiar reason which didn't\n\n01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:56.040\nactually make sense to me and no slag on virgins but they made my character a\n\n01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:01.200\nvirgin and I was like but why what is what like why what's the point what's\n\n01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:06.120\nyour point any who they did it and then they decided that she would lose her\n\n01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:12.640\nvirginity to Herman and so she did that thus thus justifying the changing the\n\n01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:18.640\nmeaning of the title entirely you know there was a porn video that came out\n\n01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:25.080\ncalled Herman's other head oh my god yeah there was a community porno no\n\n01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:31.400\nwait the community porno I was so disappointed with initially because it\n\n01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:37.160\nwas like unreleased and he came around but that's when I realized it was like\n\n01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:42.280\nof course the community porno should be this like like disaster it's it's\n\n01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:46.480\nperfect this way it's like these guys are misfits at a community college it's\n\n01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:51.520\ngood that Abbot's being played by that guy\n\n01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:58.520\nanyways but but well maybe to backtrack just for a second I because I am\n\n01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:07.120\ncurious because what was all the the the respect that you are paid by the people\n\n01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:11.600\nthat have worked with you it does include the idea that when you're doing\n\n01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:16.680\nLisa which you've done for multiple decades now that there's a there might\n\n01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:22.680\nbe a little bit of curation there which you know guys like me might bristle at\n\n01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:29.520\nthe idea of like what the actor got a script and looked at it and said no she\n\n01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:33.560\nwouldn't say that like how often does that really happen it doesn't happen\n\n01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:39.560\nvery often they but I will say when when on the very rare occasion that the\n\n01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:44.160\nwriters they are there write something that I don't think Lisa Simpson would\n\n01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:49.480\nsay or they write they write somebody being really mean to Lisa and she\n\n01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:55.920\ndoesn't have a response to that then I will always fight that fight I have to\n\n01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:59.800\nstick up for my girl and I might not win it but I have to fight it\n\n01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:09.080\nit's a and it's important to I think it's important for it's like in those\n\n01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:15.880\nmoments what phraseology would you use because I don't think she would say\n\n01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:24.040\nthat you strike a balance between like I think that this is kind of a cultural\n\n01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:29.720\nhot button like in the workplace to be like I think things should be different\n\n01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:35.200\naround here some of the most conscientious people might be terrified of\n\n01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:39.560\nmaking too many waves like if I'm if I'm a cool person then I'm not gonna be one\n\n01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:45.080\nof those people etc etc like I think it's a it's an ongoing thing of like is\n\n01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:50.160\nthere a certain parlance especially with actors like is there a is there a\n\n01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:56.600\nmagical way to present your your difference of opinion with the material\n\n01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:01.320\nyou're reading and you're about to shoot that in a world where actors other\n\n01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:05.360\nactors younger actors might say are you fucking kidding me yeah you can be as\n\n01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:08.040\nconscientious as you want but it's fucking either be eaten out here I'm\n\n01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:12.560\ngonna do whatever or even more extreme like I'm not taking that job because\n\n01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:18.120\nfrom the get-go it's these things like do you have any advice about that for\n\n01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:25.880\nlike when you're you're adjusting to a role that you're already cast in I well\n\n01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:31.200\nit's a dumb question it's a stupid question it's not a stupid question you\n\n01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:38.000\nknow I I always so it's a smart question so I'm like a good interviewer I'm not\n\n01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.440\nmaybe I'm not sure I understand the question I guess I'm kind of like I it's\n\n01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:45.000\nit's it's actually a sequel to a question that I've asked Kumail Kumail\n\n01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.480\nNanjiani who's an old friend of the podcast that all these people miss fuck\n\n01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:59.440\noff he's a person of color for instance like like it's like they're in this day\n\n01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:03.840\nand age where it's like we're beyond the point of like the Hollywood shuffle\n\n01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:08.080\nconcept of like well you got to do what you got to do it's it's it's it's\n\n01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:13.280\neveryone's trying to find their way and I'm all I'm endlessly curious about how\n\n01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:16.960\nthese dialogues are supposed to get struck up in a creative environment\n\n01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:21.120\nwhere there's such a hierarchy established a hierarchy which I frankly\n\n01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:27.400\nI'm not I'm not in a hurry to let go not because I'm an egomaniac but because I'm\n\n01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:32.080\na chaos a phobe and I don't necessarily want to just be like here's the\n\n01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:37.600\nsuggestion box let's have everybody start having an open dialogue and it like\n\n01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:43.920\nI'm just curious on the on the actor side like if there's a if there's a kind\n\n01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:48.520\nof code for an actor who's like 25 years old and they're on the set of their\n\n01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:51.800\nfucking thing and they're like god damn it just get through this and don't get\n\n01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:55.360\nfired but then they see something and let's say that they were like I don't\n\n01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:59.320\nthink either this character would say this or maybe in a larger sense this is\n\n01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:05.320\na little fucking iffy sketchy well I have a couple of things I mean always I\n\n01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:12.000\nfeel like you get more you get further with honey than with vinegar obviously\n\n01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:17.240\nand so if you have the ability to be tactful that will always serve you I\n\n01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:22.840\ndon't think that you have to be I don't I don't think you have to pussy foot\n\n01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:28.600\naround your point so much that you can't get your point across two things like if\n\n01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:36.160\nyou're an actor who is struggling with a line I always feel like I'm the sort of\n\n01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:41.520\nperson who will always give you a hundred percent so if I'm at this point if\n\n01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:46.600\nI'm having trouble with a line then I'm like really trouble with a line like I\n\n01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:54.600\ncan't remember it then I'm gonna say it's possible that the line doesn't\n\n01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:59.600\nactually make sense like there is a problem with the logic of the line so\n\n01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:04.360\nare you willing and hopefully the person on the other side the director if\n\n01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:07.520\nthat's who the person that you're speaking to or the writer if that person\n\n01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:12.360\nis also present is willing to have the conversation with you to say can you\n\n01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:16.280\ntell me what's the overall intent of what we're trying to get across here\n\n01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:21.240\nbecause maybe what you wrote is it actually what you mean and if we can\n\n01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:26.240\nactually get to that then I bet you I can remember that line and that motherfucker\n\n01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:30.400\ncomes out so well everybody's happy that's what I think so yeah I mean like\n\n01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:36.480\nit's yeah but find a positive way to say it which is like I want to help your\n\n01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:41.120\nshow be good I mean we're all on the same side we want the same win right and in\n\n01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:47.160\nterms of Lisa Simpson if there is a line that really really bumps for me you\n\n01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:54.840\nknow I that's always pretty easy but but I I never I'm not I don't have no desire\n\n01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:59.200\nto excoriate you and say this is the stupidest fucking thing I've ever seen\n\n01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:03.440\neven if that's what I feel inside you nor would you I'm getting the\n\n01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:07.440\nimplication like because you said look at the end of the day I'm gonna do it like\n\n01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:12.760\nyou wouldn't probably wouldn't do a standoff which is all the more the fact\n\n01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:16.600\nthat a good actor just a good writer writes what they're hired to write a\n\n01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:20.520\ngood actor act what they're hired to act so we have this kind of Jedi code of\n\n01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:25.720\nlike I'm not gonna be a bad craftsman but then there's this like holy like\n\n01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:30.160\nthing that should unite all of us where like if you in the commission of\n\n01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:34.320\nwriting this amazing thing and you wanting the best actor that like like we\n\n01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:38.800\ncould like connect and you could go look at the end of the day I'll say this\n\n01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:46.840\nshitty-ass line I'm about to do it before I do you want to make it better I\n\n01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:52.280\nmean that's the point did you have an energy about I think Humphrey Bogart I\n\n01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:57.440\nthink said like when you look at a line and a page that is just impossible to\n\n01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:01.360\nsay with a straight face like it's just such a bad line and you fought your\n\n01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:04.160\nfight but this is just how it's gonna be because the director is so big or the\n\n01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:09.640\nwriter whatever and his thing was if a line is impossible to deliver well just\n\n01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:14.720\nsay it out loud don't give it don't give it anything just say it and it often\n\n01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:19.360\nturns out to be great it can sometimes be a very memorable line he just says it\n\n01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:25.480\nout loud that's how like half of the people yeah it's like okay like like\n\n01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:30.600\nguess what you're charming and then they go god damn it I was trying to torpedo\n\n01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:38.400\nthat role I became Judge Reinhold the alright so like let now let's go to like\n\n01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:42.760\nbecause I think we can so this incredible thing happens to you but in\n\n01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:47.360\ntandem you're you're because you were doing Herman's head Simpsons is going on\n\n01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:53.880\nyes so I'm not sure what the best organic way to get into there's there's two\n\n01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:58.320\nplaces to go here they're both related I mean you're here because I'm a huge true\n\n01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:07.000\ncrime fan my fiancee and I listened to you and this like it's truly worth like\n\n01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:13.000\naccolades I mean of all due respect to all of our guests that have true crime\n\n01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.960\npodcasts and things I mean this is truly like a gourmet true crime experience\n\n01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:23.560\nthe so there's that but it's entwined with the fact that one of the most\n\n01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:28.240\nimpressive things about it is that in the midst of this getting down to the\n\n01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:31.720\nnitty-gritty in this true crime show that you do so well that you're a\n\n01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:38.200\nproducer on not in your face way but just eventually you just you share your\n\n01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:50.040\nstory as a victim and so does Libby Zibi Zibi she's now twice a victim just\n\n01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:58.440\nforgot her name we'll edit it the the it their harrowing tales it's insane it's\n\n01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:04.080\nnot a it so I don't know where to go because I want to talk about the nuts\n\n01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:08.320\nand bolts of your podcast because I think it's so admirable and it's so\n\n01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:13.480\ndisconnected from this other thing that I'm really fascinated with you as a\n\n01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:23.080\nhuman being an actor who has experienced crime I don't know what I'm\n\n01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:28.360\nwiping it on you my indecision because I don't know I if we go down the true\n\n01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:33.040\ncrime podcast path I'm gonna have endless questions about how you produce\n\n01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:38.680\nthat show and stuff I just also want to talk to you about this this story that\n\n01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:42.560\nyou told and I don't want you to recount it because I truly believe I mean it\n\n01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:47.680\nwas but like people need to go listen to small-town dicks what's the episode\n\n01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:55.360\ntitle stalked stalked where I mean you believe me regardless of whatever your\n\n01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:59.960\nposition in this cosmos might be it's a fascinating story there's no way it's\n\n01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:05.960\ngoing to piss you off offend you trigger you it is just harrowing and\n\n01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:09.480\ninteresting I think the most interesting thing about it from my perspective\n\n01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:20.880\nthat is as a narcissist how you ended up in this situation where this person was\n\n01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:24.840\na guy who worked on our house and was like and he just started crossing\n\n01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:31.680\nboundaries it was very quote-unquote organic and as I described on this\n\n01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:36.680\npodcast before like there's a point where you describing the story and there's\n\n01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:40.760\nthis theme running under it which is the which has come up here in this\n\n01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:46.120\nconversation which is about you you you've you've got to not accept anybody's\n\n01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:52.240\nhelp you're not gonna go tell anybody right the police the guy that works on\n\n01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.320\nHerman's head whose job is to keep people who work on Herman's head from\n\n01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:59.480\ngetting stalked right which is a huge expense shout out to the producers of\n\n01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:03.040\nHerman's head for putting them the budget right I thought that would get a\n\n01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:10.360\nbigger laugh but a lot of showrunners in the audience but the like like a you\n\n01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:15.520\nchoke up not at any point where I would expect any human being to choke up and\n\n01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:18.880\ntelling that story the exact point that you choke up when you're telling the\n\n01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:26.360\nstory is the point in the story where you go to get help because you are not to\n\n01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:31.640\nput words in your mouth that's the point where you really get victimized it's not\n\n01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:40.360\nthe point where this orangutan is abusing you stalking you predating you\n\n01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:50.040\nit's the point where you go to another orangutan and say I need you to keep\n\n01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:57.560\nthis guy like you hate yourself at that point I want the thing that is the most\n\n01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:02.880\nimportant to talk about to me is that that's the dark side of this other\n\n01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:07.760\nstory that you're this plucky but I'm gonna dominate the world without\n\n01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:14.200\nanyone's help right right because there is you know part of again that duality\n\n01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:20.840\nthat that insecurity underlying that this far from the surface is is this is\n\n01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:29.560\nthis fathoms deep well of vulnerability and this is what they're waiting for this\n\n01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:36.000\nis six-year-old voice she's gonna is that like was that what's going on in the\n\n01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.200\nback there oh everyone's gonna be so fucking stoked if I say oh it's it's\n\n01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:46.600\nrough out here my contractor like feels creepy I'm sorry I'm okay I'm way off\n\n01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:51.520\nmark like I was trying to I was like is the fear there that like you're like I\n\n01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:58.680\njust was I you know in my family we don't you don't you know you don't air\n\n01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:03.680\nyour dirty laundry I was rubber a really waspy right white Anglo-Saxon\n\n01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:08.200\nProtestant so you pull up your socks and you get on with it you just sort of\n\n01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:14.520\nkeep it all together and so you don't show your vulnerability and I and I am a\n\n01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:19.840\nperson of extremes I think in many ways and so when I set the bar high I said\n\n01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:23.480\nit's so high that it's not like I said it high and I can stand on my toes and\n\n01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:28.160\ntouch it I gotta like get on a fucking trampoline and jump so high like whoa you\n\n01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:34.480\nknow it's just almost out of reach but when I touch it that is it's not even as\n\n01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:40.680\nmuch an accomplishment it's there's just a sort of this tiny bit of relief which\n\n01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:45.280\nis kind of fucked up there's very little celebration when you live with that\n\n01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:51.120\nkind of vulnerability and you attach your and I don't do it so much anymore\n\n01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:57.200\nthank God because it's a zero-sum game but when you attach your value to what\n\n01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:04.520\nyou do and to that external validation you're in big big trouble and so if you\n\n01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:08.840\nthen find yourself in a situation like that now you've painted yourself into a\n\n01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:14.520\ncorner and so when I break down in that episode there is realization that I\n\n01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:20.280\ncan't do it all myself that feels like extraordinary failure because now I have\n\n01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:24.320\nto unzip and you get to see all my insides yeah and that was never the plan\n\n01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:30.920\nand but and I tell me to back off because I'm clumsy and drunk but like I\n\n01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:36.920\nwant I'm so fascinated by the control hatch on that interaction at that moment\n\n01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:42.400\nwhen you you're going to the to the man that said to you I'm paid for you to\n\n01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:46.840\ntell me if anyone gets out of line and then you're it's the moment where you're\n\n01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:54.240\ngoing to him and like I'm kind I just I'm I want to know like what is the beating\n\n01:20:54.240 --> 01:21:00.880\nheart behind the the shame like like the idea that moment when you you go to him\n\n01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:07.800\nand you say I got a I got an issue here and I need help like is there is there\n\n01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:12.760\nlanguage you can access about like so that we can mark it and go like if I\n\n01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:18.360\nhear this in my head that's not worth dying for like like that where you were\n\n01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:22.920\nwhat I got let me try to phrase this in a way that you can answer I'm setting you\n\n01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:30.000\nup to fail the like what's what was your in your primal crazy head not you're not\n\n01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:37.200\ncrazy I mean you're I'm the crazy part of your prime what would be the worst if\n\n01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:45.120\nno matter how not realistic what would be the nightmare response when you went\n\n01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:51.520\nto someone and said I've been having this guy is basically stalking me it's\n\n01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:55.400\ngotten way out of control and I'm overwhelmed and I need help what would\n\n01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:59.000\nbe the nightmare response from the other person it sort of was the nightmare\n\n01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.480\nresponse when he said Yardley why didn't you tell me when he showed up at your\n\n01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:08.120\nhouse and said my wife threw me out of the house right right like why didn't\n\n01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:14.960\nyou tell me weeks ago why didn't you as though you knew long ago why did you\n\n01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:18.800\nwait so long it's very familiar to the kids you know you're it's sort of your\n\n01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:23.480\nfault right you got yourself into this why didn't you know why were you\n\n01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:30.680\ndrinking exactly like you you you waited too long it's no surprise that you find\n\n01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:35.960\nyourself in this situation and and you can't handle it on your own like all\n\n01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:39.720\nthe things that when you get to that point and you have to ask for help but\n\n01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:43.760\nyou realize okay I can't handle it on my own yes I probably waited too long no I\n\n01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:48.480\ncan't do it all myself yes it's okay to ask for help all of the things that in\n\n01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:52.520\nmy life I had just learned I'm never gonna hope I never have to go to those\n\n01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:57.720\nthings I hope I never have to tick those boxes and then I did and when you say it\n\n01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:01.400\nout loud it's really no big deal by the way now I'm doing it again because I'm\n\n01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:06.400\nlike tell me just tell me about the point I'm like it but that that I get\n\n01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:13.880\nthat now like I it's like god damn it I was almost fucking home like how much\n\n01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:17.640\ndo I have to do to prove I'm strong and then and then it's like somebody's like\n\n01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:22.080\nno I'm gonna fucking literally I'm gonna build a spider web in your attic and\n\n01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:26.040\nlike and you're like are you serious I have to like call customer service on\n\n01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:33.880\nthis I bought I went Linux for a reason I'm a fucking I it that's what I I don't\n\n01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:38.400\nwant to say that's what I thought I it's not so complicated you know but in\n\n01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:44.840\nyour in your head I think or if you're the sort of person who who spends a lot\n\n01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:51.000\nof energy trying to make sure that nobody sees your vulnerability then the\n\n01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:56.800\nmoment that there is a crack in that facade it feels catastrophic and that I\n\n01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:02.880\nthink and it's it's not true because one thing is true about me then what if\n\n01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:07.440\neverything is right everything could be untrue about me and so it's it's I don't\n\n01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:12.280\nthink anybody else feels that way about my vulnerability but in that moment you\n\n01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:17.080\nit does feel like this massive failure because all your life you've been told\n\n01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:20.560\nlike don't ever let anybody see that well your friend you're really good\n\n01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:23.480\nfriend I assume she's a really good friend your co-host in the podcast with\n\n01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:30.760\nher I think in general you guys are so good at interviewing she is like piping\n\n01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:34.680\nin just the right amount she's probably heard the story a thousand times and\n\n01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:40.880\nshe's sort of like yeah but stop here for a second Yardley because she knows\n\n01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:47.600\npeople listening to the story want you to explain right just for a second are\n\n01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:52.400\nyou seriously putting up with this at this point and it's a it is a it's a\n\n01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:56.360\ntruly therapeutic exercise you guys please listen to the episode it's\n\n01:24:56.360 --> 01:25:02.040\nincredible I is that the first episode is that no God no because they would never\n\n01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:07.320\ntrade in that it's no I think it's in the second season okay somewhere buried\n\n01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:12.520\nin the middle there she also so at some point during this true crime podcast\n\n01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:15.480\nthis thing that's happened to you which which were kind of vaguely referring to\n\n01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:19.440\nthat began to happen or is it something that happened no long ago happened in\n\n01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:25.000\nthe early 90s so at some point in second season of your small-town dicks you\n\n01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.840\njust just you started talking about that on the show we actually all of our\n\n01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:34.640\ncases are told by the detectives who investigated them oh well except for two\n\n01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:40.000\nepisodes one incident that happened to Zibi where she was mugged and then that\n\n01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.880\nwas in season one and we did it because the detectives Dan and Dave we have two\n\n01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:49.600\nidentical twin detectives on the show who co-host with us talked about this\n\n01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:56.800\nthing they call the goofy loop where you like a yeah so a cop will be like on a\n\n01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:01.120\ntraffic stop and be like get out of the car get out of the car get out and you're\n\n01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:04.160\nalready out of the car and they just keep telling you get out of the car get\n\n01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:08.240\nout of the car and they're just sort of like so wound up and that's called the\n\n01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:13.840\ngoofy loop and so Zibi was then we were at lunch and she was talking about this\n\n01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:18.800\nthing that happened to her and they're like you were in the goofy loop so we\n\n01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:22.960\ndid this episode where is the only one that wasn't actually told by detective\n\n01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:27.360\nobviously and then so the next time in the second season and a season doesn't\n\n01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:31.880\nactually correspond to a calendar year we just were actually only two years old\n\n01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:37.960\nbut we do about two seasons a year in the second season we did this episode\n\n01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:42.960\nwhere I was stalked by this guy who'd worked on my house yeah and you had\n\n01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:48.240\nanother story before that too of a guy was leaving yes yes on my front door I\n\n01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:53.240\nmean it's it's it's it reminds me of the story it was it Rebecca Schaefer yes\n\n01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:56.880\nwhich is right around the same time you were I actually auditioned for that part\n\n01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:04.800\nI went to the network for that role you kids yeah it's like there was this\n\n01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:12.240\nyoung actress who she her murder kind of changed the landscape of stalking\n\n01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:18.360\nrules here in our great state of California like where it was like all\n\n01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:24.640\nright enough is enough this woman was absolutely stalked and murdered in like\n\n01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:29.360\nplain sight like this guy just decided he wanted to kill her and there was no\n\n01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:34.880\nway there were it changed it changed a lot of stuff and it's a it's a really\n\n01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:42.080\ntragic story and it was happening at the exact same time when I'm just\n\n01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:46.280\nmorbidly curious was it happening at the exact same time in the in-sense they\n\n01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:54.120\nwere you had Rebecca been killed when you were enduring some when did she my\n\n01:27:54.120 --> 01:28:01.320\nthing happened I think hers happened after mine because mine happened in like\n\n01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:09.880\n93 or it happened around the same time roughly I'm so bad with dates I'm sorry\n\n01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:18.840\nI don't know I measure things by Emmys after my third Emmy at 9-11 9-11 I\n\n01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:25.240\nthat's before 9-11 those after 9-11 so like my 37th birthday was halfway\n\n01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:34.200\nbetween 9-11 and my second Emmy Dan you're not relatable I don't care I don't\n\n01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:42.000\nneed to be relatable I'm a living God I may also be super drunk so let's get\n\n01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.800\ninto the true crime of it I really think because it's like I guys I hear the\n\n01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:52.360\naudience are like I hate true crime I hate your crime go ahead a lot of it\n\n01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:56.680\nwell they're just saying that because they love you and that's one of the\n\n01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:01.440\nthings like you you and your partner have like created the show so here's the\n\n01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:06.200\nhere's the reason why this is an amazing show so true crime what you might be\n\n01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:11.440\nused to and I think this is a great art form is total amateurs in an arm chair\n\n01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:15.000\nhanging out going like hey well here's what I think about JonBenét Ramsey\n\n01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:23.200\nthat's fucking great and I live by it but you are also a fan of that art form\n\n01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:30.560\nbut you inexplicably have created a truly responsible and professional show\n\n01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:34.560\nthat I would truly recommend to anybody I would I wouldn't bother to preface it\n\n01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:40.160\nby going do you love true crime because I'd be like you must love film noir or\n\n01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:44.960\nyou must love like just the idea of anything I mean I think it's the only\n\n01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:48.760\ntrue crime show I've ever heard that I think cops could listen to next to\n\n01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:56.160\nvictims for instance we get a lot of messages emails reviews from cops saying\n\n01:29:56.160 --> 01:30:01.200\nthis is amazing thanks so much thanks for telling it from our point of view so\n\n01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:04.960\nlike I said all of our cases are told by the detectives who investigated them\n\n01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:10.360\nand it started because I'm friends with Dan and Dave these identical twin\n\n01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:16.920\ndetectives and they are one investigated violent crimes and one\n\n01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:23.280\ninvestigated sex crimes and child abuse and to just hear them talk about their\n\n01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:32.640\nday was the most harrowing extraordinary mind-blowing like Tuesday is so much\n\n01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:38.040\nmore incredible than my any ever day like I imagine being interrogated in\n\n01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:44.640\nstereo by twin detectives the first questions you asked them like to have\n\n01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:48.960\nyou guys ever done a dead ringer they actually have what's funny is when\n\n01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:55.040\nbecause they live obviously in the same town so they have had criminals say fuck\n\n01:30:55.040 --> 01:31:02.520\nyou to one of them and like you don't mean you know you mean my brother me as\n\n01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:07.080\na criminal how do I know which is the good cop which is the better right these\n\n01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:12.600\nguys though it is remarkable and also all of your guests but most like like these\n\n01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:20.080\ntwo guys these anonymous detectives they it to put it in D&D terms these guys are\n\n01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:32.040\nlike I try I try to their paladins the paladin class is like it's not the one\n\n01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:36.160\neveryone chooses I don't want to ride around in a suit of armor on a white\n\n01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:41.680\nhorse and like go and it already sounds like I'm trivializing it because the\n\n01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:47.720\nmore important thing is in the sort of dragnet archetypal sense god it's so\n\n01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:53.840\nit I'm all over the place here's where I'm gonna start with this as an American\n\n01:31:53.840 --> 01:32:00.120\ncitizen I think my worst fear about cops including homicide detectives was\n\n01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:04.600\nrealized by Mark Furman like even from Wisconsin it was sort of like didn't we\n\n01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:10.640\nall think that that's how it worked that and worse than thinking that this is\n\n01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:14.720\nwhat detectives are it's actually more about this is what we think of the world\n\n01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:20.880\nbecause we would assume I don't want to do that job and so if this guy does that\n\n01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:27.200\njob and he's racist then maybe that job makes you racist and it toxifies\n\n01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:33.720\neverything and and it's so different and from from to hear these guys who are\n\n01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:37.120\nlike I have no idea what they look like they're anonymous you guys keep their\n\n01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:45.160\nidentity secret which is adds to the charm they're there they you can't be\n\n01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:49.280\nthat by the book and that can did they they sit there with you guys and they\n\n01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:57.320\ninterview other detectives couldn't I just Google identical detectives\n\n01:32:57.320 --> 01:33:02.560\nyou could but we actually say in our opening while some of our listeners may\n\n01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:06.360\nrecognize some of these cases we hope that you'll join us in keeping their\n\n01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:11.920\nidentities secret to protect the victims and what they've been through and so are\n\n01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:15.680\nall the cases that cases that these two have worked on themselves so they're\n\n01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:21.800\njust giving their insight on cases that that no what sorry so we do cases that\n\n01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:27.000\nDan and Dave have investigated we also have guests from other small towns who\n\n01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.720\ncome and tell us cases that they have investigated and Dan and Dave because\n\n01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:36.640\nthey are they are of the brotherhood are there to comment and sort of weigh in as\n\n01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:42.840\nwell gotcha what's incredible is the is I mean you guys are so restrained but\n\n01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:45.320\nthen it's like it's like listening over the seasons you guys like learned\n\n01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:49.600\nphrases and then yes two seasons later you're like wouldn't that be a quibble\n\n01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:55.120\ndibbley that's a very good point but in this case in our district you're not\n\n01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:59.880\nallowed to do a quibbley-dibbley okay fine just checking but it's more\n\n01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:04.280\nimportantly like it's Dan and Dave who are like it's like you could never get\n\n01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:11.040\ncops to host a podcast right it would be a terrible podcast because they'd be\n\n01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:17.400\nlike hey I'm Dan I'm Dave we're hanging out I don't know I'm sure it'd be great\n\n01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:23.040\nbut you know what's interesting so originally the concept of the podcast\n\n01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:27.600\nwas Dan and Dave would just talk to each other over a glass of scotch which\n\n01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:34.240\nwould be fine and it wasn't fine because they were they first of all\n\n01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:37.160\nsometimes you put a microphone in front of somebody and they sort of freeze up\n\n01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:42.160\nand they don't know quite what to do and suddenly with scotch it got all a bit\n\n01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:46.600\nslurry in about you know 40 minutes so that wasn't a podcast I won't tolerate\n\n01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:52.840\nthat and so that is a podcast killer yeah where's the professionalism so\n\n01:34:52.840 --> 01:35:01.960\nanyways give me one second I have to go solve the crime of Jeff has to pee I\n\n01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:07.720\nalready know who done it and it it's me and it was in the master bedroom of my\n\n01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:15.760\npants continue please I'm sorry so then they said we need you and Zibi to ask us\n\n01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:21.680\nquestions wait wait sorry sorry sorry they they tried it by themselves yes well\n\n01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:26.840\nwe were there no we were all there Zibi and I because we we were like okay we'll\n\n01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:31.840\nproduce it and you guys you should have a podcast we should not be talking\n\n01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:35.080\ncorrect because I'm the voice of Lisa Simpson it'll only fuck things up yes\n\n01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:40.080\nand and then they like press record and they're like okay so yes what about that\n\n01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:46.280\nperp yes and you guys are like okay how do I put anyway they were actually the\n\n01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:50.000\nones who were like this doesn't work of course because they're paladins they're\n\n01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:55.000\ngood guys they're wonderful guys they're great guys and I will say and to your\n\n01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.560\npoint about Mark Furman you know one of the things that I love about our\n\n01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:03.560\npodcast and it's been a sort of unexpected treasure about it is that\n\n01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:08.360\nwhile there is certainly a really worthy conversation about the really about\n\n01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:13.400\nthe horrible things happening in law enforcement in this country I would say\n\n01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:17.680\n99% of them are actually trying to do their very best and if we have an\n\n01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:22.200\nopportunity to shine a light on those people as well that's also part of the\n\n01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:28.000\nconversation and these guys all say and the women that it's a calling it's not a\n\n01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:36.200\njob and so you know I really they really really really are going the distance to\n\n01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:41.000\ndo it right and do it well and we have cases about we have a really fantastic\n\n01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.520\nfour-part series called the sociopath and the whistleblower about a bad cop who\n\n01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:52.200\nwas a bad cop for 10 years that's fucking credible rocked this town is Dan or\n\n01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:58.360\nDave isn't there the protagonist of that or no no that's a guy named Lieutenant\n\n01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:02.640\nScott who investigated that we did we have a great have you listen to the\n\n01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:07.160\ninterview so we have a another great two-part case called presumed guilty and\n\n01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:13.960\nthen that's in season two about two guys who were sent to prison for a crime they\n\n01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:19.200\nended up not committing and then we did an interview with one of those guys who\n\n01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:24.960\nhad been in prison for eight years this season but not on the phone right no he's\n\n01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:30.760\nhe said he's sitting with us thank God I mean I know people's lives are important\n\n01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:35.880\nyeah the audio quality I know I know I feel God with the true crime with the\n\n01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:50.840\nit's high so what you like to be the mother of Jeffrey timers 12th victim I\n\n01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:55.600\nlove it in the booth Zach is adjusting you right now like well maybe if you're\n\n01:37:55.600 --> 01:38:00.760\nnice to the sound engineers you get better sound mother fucker it is such a\n\n01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:05.680\nprofound thing though to hear these guys and they all strike a similar silhouette\n\n01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:09.040\nbut they're some of them are so different there's like the guy who's like well I'm\n\n01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:13.320\nthe guy that shows up when there's an arson but also I like more about skin\n\n01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:18.600\nburns but some of them are crass some of them are polite some of them are afraid\n\n01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:25.000\nto be profane some of them are what what really comes across is that if any of\n\n01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:30.120\nthese guys in spite of how kind of maybe stoic the job demands that their\n\n01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:37.080\npersonalities be I am socially conditioned to believe that if a barrel\n\n01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:42.960\nchested as I picture all of them a man with a notepad and a gun on his hip\n\n01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:46.560\nthat he's allowed to kill anyone he wants with that when that guy's being\n\n01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:53.320\nstoic that he's hiding the fact that he's racist homophobic misogynistic that\n\n01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:58.560\nhe wishes that the filth in the street could blah blah blah it be rained out\n\n01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:05.160\nand it it is so therapeutic to listen to just the simple dragnet reality these\n\n01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:09.680\nguys often refer to dragnet moments because what they do is so clerical\n\n01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:16.160\nthey they move from address to address and they keep careful notes and their I\n\n01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:20.120\nlove the rule of law being the protagonist in these stories yes they're\n\n01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:25.600\nvery methodical and we actually always also try to get into the like who are\n\n01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:32.160\nyou as a person why do you do what you do and then how do you if you are the\n\n01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:36.280\nperson who goes toward all of the stuff that the rest of us run from where does\n\n01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:44.320\nthat live inside of you yeah always always ask because you're how do you do\n\n01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:48.640\nit it's it's debugging I think I got from this guy that we call Asperger\n\n01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:52.000\ndetective on this show because he has a true crime podcast it's just him and a\n\n01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:57.480\nmicrophone and his crazy brain like doing an awesome job of talking about\n\n01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:04.520\nfamous murder cases but he he really woke me up to like the healthy reason why\n\n01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:08.880\nI think that maybe true crime is a fascination which is sort of a debugging\n\n01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:15.200\nof of our experiment with being a society like because you've got a you've\n\n01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:19.480\ngot a couple different leads coming in you've got the cops that are showing up\n\n01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:23.120\nyou've got the victims that are showing up you've got the perpetrators that are\n\n01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:27.120\nshowing up and you're looking at it with your little ghostbusters lens and going\n\n01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:32.160\nokay did which of these things went wrong and we tend to get drawn to the\n\n01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:36.880\nfamous things okay so let's all talk about JonBenét Ramsey for a million\n\n01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:42.160\nyears because it's endlessly fascinating but your podcast is like there are a\n\n01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:46.320\nmillion small towns in America all of them have big crimes constantly\n\n01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:50.720\nhappening in them and then all of them have a homicide detective who shows up\n\n01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:57.120\nwho is like this is like and you guys do a really good job you're good\n\n01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:04.600\ninterviewers I wish you were doing this podcast like it just like it takes the\n\n01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:08.480\neffect of like this VR experience because these guys they're they're like\n\n01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:12.120\nyou're like so what happened first they're like okay so I got a call from\n\n01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:17.960\nthird and Lincoln and I saw the door a minute first thing I noticed doors got\n\n01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:23.400\nwater damage and it just goes from there so I mean I can't if you don't like it\n\n01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:29.840\nyou're a piece of shit even if even if you hate crime or love it I don't know\n\n01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:34.560\nwhat kind it really is a good podcast thank you how did you produce it are you\n\n01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:39.360\npart of a network I'm not no actually we do it we're a tiny team\n\n01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:43.920\nZibi and I edit on paper and then we pass it off to two editors who put it\n\n01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:49.160\ninto Pro Tools it's an incredibly edit heavy podcast because we're not dealing\n\n01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:53.680\nwith professional storytellers okay you guys aren't that amazing people like\n\n01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:57.240\nand they're that thoughtful because that would be too intimidating because I was\n\n01:41:57.240 --> 01:42:01.200\ngonna ask that what do you mean you guys are so he thought you were doing it in\n\n01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:05.640\none take you're not editing your your questions are so thoughtful and you're\n\n01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:09.720\nnever interrupting and being a big drunken idiot and you're just editing it all\n\n01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:16.200\nout we actually have now learned to the thing about interrupting what's\n\n01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:21.040\ninteresting is we used to interrupt no we used to interrupt more let me stop\n\n01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:26.640\nyou right there this isn't this is a pro interrupting show that's right go\n\n01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:33.520\nahead and Dan and Dave said to us they pulled us aside literally and said when\n\n01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:37.120\nthese detectives are telling these stories it's often like they're\n\n01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:42.400\ntestifying on the stand and it's much better just to let them go and if you\n\n01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:46.720\nhave questions write them down and then come back to them afterward if there's a\n\n01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:52.360\nnatural break you can ask the question but it's it's less good to sort of try\n\n01:42:52.360 --> 01:43:03.720\nto get one in it doesn't their brain it's just not like that I love hearing\n\n01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:08.400\nthat for several reasons one is that I love the idea that the the men and\n\n01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:12.320\nwomen that we put in charge and nine binaries that you're welcome that we\n\n01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:16.840\nthat we put in charge of that really specific tier of law enforcement where\n\n01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:21.920\nthe crimes already happened now they got a the paper trail begins and they got to\n\n01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:27.400\nfind the perp I think they're called perps I love I love I'm so much more\n\n01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:32.800\ncomfortable with the idea of them being not natural performers I would really\n\n01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:36.800\nlike them to have Asperger's I would really like them to be like no I'm more\n\n01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:40.640\nof a detail oriented they really are very detail aren't they're very organized\n\n01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:48.880\nthat way and they so yes to your point we're very edit heavy they you know we\n\n01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:54.680\nit's just there's repetition you we my here's my thing the most important\n\n01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:59.080\nminute is the next minute and so you don't want your audience to turn away\n\n01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:03.480\nyou don't want them to turn you off and go and do something else and so I really\n\n01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:09.080\nhave tremendous respect for our listeners and I want my podcast podcast to\n\n01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:14.480\nbe clean I mean if you don't listen to it now you're a piece of shit she just\n\n01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:18.840\nsaid the most important minute is the next minute that means every minute\n\n01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:23.760\nmore important than the next fuck you people you don't get it I hope you\n\n01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:28.960\ndon't listen to it because it sounds like it'll make you better and you\n\n01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:35.280\ndeserve to be worse thanks for coming here I'm so sorry about the audience\n\n01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:41.200\nthere I think they're drunk frankly beefing with about people that don't\n\n01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:46.360\nlike people getting I don't know the ghost of my dad who isn't even dead\n\n01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:52.480\nthat's how drunk I am but you're just you're just imagining that people are\n\n01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:56.760\nmad at you for loving crime called shame I I was just talking around functions\n\n01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:01.400\nabout this on his better podcast today because he was doing a better job of\n\n01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:06.800\ninterviewing me no no compare and despair don't do it compare and

shrumped\n\n01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:39.320\ntis an honor what's the coolest thing that your job has allowed you to be able\n\n01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:48.920\nto do the the coolest thing that my job is has allowed me to do it has given me\n\n01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:55.000\nfreedom of choice and I really and I said that it's and now actually I I used\n\n01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:58.440\nto always say that and I said that to Matt Salman who's one of our executive\n\n01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:03.400\nproducer writers the other day I know Matt and he's so funny and shut the fuck\n\n01:46:03.400 -->

here's the\n\n01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:29.880\nstory about freedom of choice three years ago I broke my neck terrible choice\n\n01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:36.680\njust be quiet for a second sorry I'm so sorry I'm so sorry it was funny though it\n\n01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:41.360\nwas funny it was funny it was funny not worth interrupting but it was funny\n\n01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:48.880\ntechnically so it was a really really really bad break and I came within a\n\n01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:53.240\nmillimeter of being paralyzed from the neck down we can ask how it happened I\n\n01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:59.000\nfell down a flight of stairs in a parking garage and I separated C5 and C6 and\n\n01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.600\nstretched my spinal cord to within a millimeter of snapping so that would have\n\n01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:09.000\nmeant paralysis for probably my friend oh yes or death or death so we're a\n\n01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:16.160\nsuperhero damn origin damn I'm trying to put a point okay okay okay it'll be\n\n01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:24.720\nshort all right so I want the show to be good so it took me a full year to\n\n01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:30.680\nrecover now I'm lucky cuz I have good health insurance but what I really had\n\n01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:40.080\nwas time and I had time because I have this amazing job and what I realized is\n\n01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:51.240\nthat even the thing that nobody has the thing that nobody it was time that I\n\n01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:56.040\ncould go to physical therapy five days a week and it wasn't about the money it\n\n01:47:56.040 --> 01:48:01.400\nwas that I could go because I didn't have to be anywhere else and so that is\n\n01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:06.800\nabout the freedom of choice and what I oh the other thing I always say is you\n\n01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:11.160\nknow if I have this extraordinary opportunity that this job has given me if\n\n01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:14.960\nI don't have the wherewithal to do something with that then that's on me\n\n01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:22.360\nthen I'm the asshole so right that's the best thing yeah the idea of waking up\n\n01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:26.320\nin the morning and knowing that the reason you're getting out of bed has is\n\n01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:31.280\nsomehow intersecting with you wanting to yes instead of having that fallback that\n\n01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:35.240\nwe're all too familiar with which is like well I got a quit smoking well I'm\n\n01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:39.760\na smoker but I got a quit smoking and you like fall into that trap of like okay\n\n01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:43.800\nso I'm living in two totally different realities like I'm getting out of bed\n\n01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:47.480\nbecause my alarm clock rung and I'm a dishwasher so I'm gonna go wash dishes\n\n01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:53.040\nit's not it's absolutely not what I want to do that's how 99% of us live and we\n\n01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:57.480\ncall that work and we call that paying the rent and stuff and so that's 1% of\n\n01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:02.200\nus have this privilege it's an enormous privilege to if you're gonna spend so\n\n01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:06.760\nmuch of your time at work then hopefully it's something that you enjoy\n\n01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:10.920\nbecause and hopefully you'd be able to like come down from that Mount Sinai and\n\n01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:15.720\nbe like hey everybody that had to wash dishes otherwise they'd lose their house\n\n01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:22.920\nright I'm I'm I I get to jump out of bed in the morning knowing that I'm stoked\n\n01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:26.040\nabout what I do and I just want to let you know it's not that great it also\n\n01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:34.240\nsucks fuck off and that would still be an uplifting message okay I didn't guys\n\n01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:39.920\ndidn't receive that I mean it doesn't have to be like oh I'm staying I love\n\n01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:47.360\ndoing what I love like I think it can be really simple you know what I I got a\n\n01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:52.000\nmillion dollars for taking a shit on a paper plate I feel bad about myself I\n\n01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:59.120\nthink that can be really uplifting for poor people and then that second\n\n01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:06.600\nquestion was about activism let's move on to that yeah what is what's the LGBTQ\n\n01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:11.480\nactivist stuff that you well Jeff it's it's part of the gay thing oh sorry you're\n\n01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:18.040\nasking her okay my answer was gonna be stupid for a really long time I so when\n\n01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:26.600\nCalifornia voted against gay marriage I was I had just actually produced a movie\n\n01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:32.560\nthat Dustin Lance Black had directed called Virginia that Jennifer Connelly\n\n01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:39.120\nand Ed Harris had starred in and he introduced me to Chad Griffin who at the\n\n01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:45.400\ntime had just teamed up with Rob Reiner and they started the American\n\n01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:49.480\nFoundation for Equal Rights to overturn Proposition 8 and they came to me and\n\n01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:55.840\nsaid yardly we need to fight this fight and we need money and I said I'm in so\n\n01:50:55.840 --> 01:51:04.520\nthat was most sort of my first really really big push and I was one of the\n\n01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:11.000\nmajor donors for that and then Chad got poached from once we did that the\n\n01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:17.560\nAmerican Foundation for Equal Rights went away and Chad got poached to the\n\n01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:23.120\nhuman rights campaign and then I sort of followed him there and supported them\n\n01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:28.840\nthere and I actually was just honored there this last spring at their gala as\n\n01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:36.200\ngot the National Leadership Award for supporting the LGBTQ community wow now\n\n01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:41.320\nthere's something that there's another one of them I'm sure your hundred answers\n\n01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:46.400\nfor what your job is afforded you to be able to do is to become like a donor to\n\n01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:50.920\nthese things and a philanthropist yes you know I'm a quiet donor I actually I\n\n01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:56.360\ndon't I rarely I'm not a flashy donor I give quite generously but I never need\n\n01:51:56.360 --> 01:52:02.080\nto be I don't never need my name and lights about that it's and it's funny\n\n01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:06.760\nso when I had to give this speech about being recognized by the human rights\n\n01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:12.080\ncampaign I was I got a big laugh when I said so I've been agonizing for months\n\n01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:18.320\nabout how to thank you for thanking me properly for doing this I'm like thanks\n\n01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:23.440\nbecause now I've not slept since Christmas I mean it was really I mean I\n\n01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:28.680\nwas incredibly gratified but I also felt like I really don't I don't need you to\n\n01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:33.800\nI don't need it I'm good like they personally are always so gracious towards\n\n01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:38.480\nme but they really really really wanted to do it publicly and so I recognized\n\n01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:46.240\nthat part of being gracious is allowing people to say thank you and so\n\n01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:48.480\nthey should give you that they should be like obviously they're not gonna just\n\n01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:52.080\nnever thank you and never want to honor you but they should have a like they\n\n01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:55.040\nshould come to you and say hey we're they're gonna throw you this big event\n\n01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:59.680\nwhere you get to get up and agonize over a speech or we'll just you get to know\n\n01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:04.640\nthat we want to do that for you and you can flip that coin and go whichever way\n\n01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:11.440\nyou wish but they were not giving me that option I think it's important\n\n01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:16.920\nactually whether you like it or not that they're the strategic benefit of\n\n01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:22.000\nbecause someone like me who would do it for the wrong reasons is like hey I want\n\n01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.000\nI want that I think it's important I think you would donate to these great\n\n01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:30.560\ncauses just I would have a little great causes for very wrong reasons no but I\n\n01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:37.360\nI do think that I that that idea of deflecting compliments being like I\n\n01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:42.200\nthink that like if somebody's saying thank you and then how you react to that\n\n01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:48.720\nit's like like your instinct being to be like almost like fuck you it's right\n\n01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:54.920\nbecause you're because if if you did something nice for any other reason than\n\n01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:59.560\nto be nice then that person that's actually thanking you is arguably an\n\n01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:05.800\nenemy in your in your pineal gland you're like and then like I had to I had a\n\n01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:10.080\ntherapist had to explain to me like no it's part of it you have to telling you\n\n01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:15.280\nthat that they're happy that you and you part of it is you have to receive it so\n\n01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:21.560\nget over it and receive it it's part of the deal I'm gonna help you are you good\n\n01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:28.160\nlike in a smaller way are you good are you good are you comfortable with small\n\n01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:32.760\nlike small compliments in general like I do do you accept them easily or is it\n\n01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:36.440\ndifficult to even accept little compliments let's test it let's test it\n\n01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:44.920\ndon't even answer what shut up Jeff you're a piece of shit thank you okay\n\n01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:53.640\nhe's pretty good I feel like I am whatever happens internally you know if\n\n01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:59.520\nI'm and it really can be sort of day-to-day if I if I like I was almost\n\n01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:04.160\nlate today tonight because I couldn't get out of my closet because I changed\n\n01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:08.160\nclothes like five times you chose well this butterfly dress is rocking thank\n\n01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:15.040\nyou and it's see she did it thank you we got it but you kind of took it you\n\n01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:23.000\nkind of bowed your head I did you did part of you think in your head fuck you\n\n01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:29.120\nthis butter did no did you have to translate it to the second language of no I\n\n01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:35.240\ndon't think so I just but it's I'm you know I'm just sort of I'm a I'm a\n\n01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:42.840\ncomplicated little critter in there sometimes I recognize now I like it's\n\n01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:49.560\ncompliments are fine I'm good with it I really am good I just honestly knew that\n\n01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:57.760\nI I just really didn't need that big big recognition I was really okay with Chad\n\n01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:04.080\nand Chris Sparen who runs the foundation under him they're always like I said so\n\n01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:09.440\npersonally gracious I was like that is so enough for me I'm good but they were\n\n01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:12.800\ninsistent so I there is specific turn of phrase and I'm not seeing this go blue\n\n01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:16.400\nlike because it's like I think I like like like so is there something that\n\n01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:22.440\nsomeone can say like there's something that performers people that want\n\n01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:28.160\nattention like did you hear something from them that made that through that\n\n01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:32.120\ngear and you're like oh that's what I wanted to hear and I don't actually need\n\n01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:36.920\nto hear it from 250 million people on Twitter I actually need to hear from two\n\n01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:42.800\npeople who are like running this charity drive that's a good question I don't know\n\n01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:46.920\nthere's a that's a dumb question don't even do you have one Dan that you want\n\n01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:50.600\nto hear you know I think it's like it's fucking like you're a good person but\n\n01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:54.040\nit's like if someone said that to me I'd be like well you're a liar and you're a\n\n01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:58.120\npiece of shit never trust you I'm gonna hit you in the head I you know it's\n\n01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:03.000\nfunny I often joke that I I'm I work for biscuits and I'm sort of like a dog I\n\n01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:09.520\nrespond to biscuits so I do like to know that I did a good job I like
