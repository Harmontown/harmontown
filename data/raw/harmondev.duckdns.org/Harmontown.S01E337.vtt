WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:22.680

00:22.680 --> 00:34.160
you Harmontown is now in session we've got guests we've got there's a dog act

00:34.160 --> 00:38.000
coming out we've got all sorts of stuff but let's start with the important

00:38.000 --> 00:43.320
ingredients your game master your friend your mentor and guru Spencer

00:43.320 --> 01:00.240
Christendon when I sense it why indeed how about let's bring out a mayor it

01:00.240 --> 01:18.960
ain't a town without a mayor we have a mayor's name is Dan Harmon hello I'm so

01:18.960 --> 01:22.800
excited about our guest I was like dog do I have to go do the show I want to keep

01:22.800 --> 01:27.480
talking to my guest but I'll talk to her out here it's been a while thanks you

01:27.480 --> 01:31.920
guys are for it for coming we've been apart for a while I missed you yeah I

01:31.920 --> 01:37.000
heard you had heard you've been having pee pee trouble yeah I got I got I got I

01:37.000 --> 01:41.720
got what appears to be some kind of bladder infection it's alright it's

01:41.720 --> 01:47.560
alright I did what I had to do to get the meds today like I this it was this

01:47.560 --> 01:53.000
morning I was like this is it you know I would you ladies know I was already a

01:53.000 --> 02:00.800
feminist but boy golly these UTIs like I now what I now is if I needed more

02:00.800 --> 02:06.120
reason to respect what you go through Jeff statistically women get more UTIs

02:06.120 --> 02:10.720
than men I knew that their pee holes are closer to their butt holes that's not

02:10.720 --> 02:15.120
why Dan that's not why also the other side of the gender spectrum is a

02:15.120 --> 02:19.520
horrendous filthy animal that always plunges yeah okay there's a million

02:19.520 --> 02:25.680
reasons but they get more UTIs and I too if you had described to me on paper like

02:25.680 --> 02:32.360
oh there's a thing where you feel like you have to take a pee really bad but

02:32.360 --> 02:38.200
all the time forever no matter how much you pee you keep feeling like you have

02:38.200 --> 02:46.680
to pee I'd be like grow up that's not even a disease that sounds fun I'd pay

02:46.680 --> 02:51.720
money to experience that at like a theme park that sounds like an escape room to

02:51.720 --> 02:57.840
me bring it on I'd love to feel what it feels like to have to pee all the time I

02:57.840 --> 03:01.800
experienced it for three hours this morning and I was like Rick and word

03:01.800 --> 03:09.000
he's canceled I can't I'm gonna kill myself and I'm gonna take the gun that I

03:09.000 --> 03:12.840
reassembled after I bought it and I'm gonna just I don't even have to point it

03:12.840 --> 03:17.080
at my head to kill myself because as we established it's probably poorly

03:17.080 --> 03:22.440
reassembled by a liberal and I it'll just blow up in my hand and I'll bleed

03:22.440 --> 03:26.760
out because I don't know how to do anything at least of all handle a UTI and

03:26.760 --> 03:32.320
my intrepid assistant Steve Levy did exactly what I commanded him to do which

03:32.320 --> 03:37.160
is I don't care what you have to do find me a doctor that will look at my dick

03:37.160 --> 03:43.760
today immediately and he found one I know a couple and God bless this guy's

03:43.760 --> 03:49.120
heart I mean it's like if you're gonna see a doctor same day you're not you're

03:49.120 --> 03:58.360
not seeing like the same doctor that they're not sending their best the

03:58.360 --> 04:03.000
medical community is sending their best in the in the sort of like Katrina sandbag

04:03.000 --> 04:07.240
sense of like like like whether they're like I mean it's it's like they're

04:07.240 --> 04:11.760
there it's like you're gonna you're gonna end up in an office with somebody

04:11.760 --> 04:16.280
that's like like this guy gave me a whole speech after he asked me about my

04:16.280 --> 04:19.640
dick for a bunch of times it's like it was really heartwarming it was like by

04:19.640 --> 04:22.880
the way I know you have another doctor and you're here because you know I was

04:22.880 --> 04:26.120
the one that could see right away but the thing is if you did want to be you know

04:26.120 --> 04:31.200
it's sort of like a courtship like thing or is like but not because he wasn't

04:31.200 --> 04:35.720
like trying to swindle me into being his patient he was more telling me in a

04:35.720 --> 04:40.120
really sweet way he's like look if it's a Monday a Wednesday or a Friday and

04:40.120 --> 04:43.640
it's between these hours you can walk in here ask any of my other patients if

04:43.640 --> 04:48.520
you're the first one in you the first one I'll see those other three days I'm

04:48.520 --> 04:52.120
working in urgent care I do this all I say is like you're a little sweetheart

04:52.120 --> 04:57.680
you're a little sweetheart but you don't care about my dick right not in the way

04:57.680 --> 05:02.280
that I a guy who like spent three hours in discomfort and who webmd it I know

05:02.280 --> 05:09.800
exactly what I want I'm like bitch I gave you a cup of pee here's what you're

05:09.800 --> 05:15.920
gonna do you're gonna analyze it tell me what beasties are in it he dipped a

05:15.920 --> 05:19.560
thing in it he's like there's blood in your ear and I'm like visibly to the

05:19.560 --> 05:25.120
naked eye is like no I put a thing in it I'm like okay so talk to me get blood

05:25.120 --> 05:29.080
in the pee pee that is blood in the pee pee but only detectable by a litmus strip

05:29.080 --> 05:33.600
not not you know that visible blood yeah I'm not blood urine shaming anyone out

05:33.600 --> 05:40.840
there who has visible blood in their urine like I'm down with everyone I went

05:40.840 --> 05:46.440
in and I'm like she has gotten off to a zooming start I just I told the guy I'm

05:46.440 --> 05:52.800
like the guy goes look how old are you I'm like I don't know a million years

05:52.800 --> 05:56.760
old I'm a million years old like I know what questions are coming next by the

05:56.760 --> 06:00.760
way they ask you you fill the forms I don't want to complain I don't think

06:00.760 --> 06:06.280
they look at the forms look at the forms not only don't they look at the

06:06.280 --> 06:10.920
forms even the people that don't look at the forms they don't even talk to the

06:10.920 --> 06:15.880
people that haven't yet looked at the forms and they and even though they ask

06:15.880 --> 06:21.120
you the same fucking questions they're not I don't even think they're writing

06:21.120 --> 06:24.960
them down it seems like it would be a great step to look at those forms before

06:24.960 --> 06:30.120
it comes in God damn forms like my address is on your fucking clipboard a

06:30.120 --> 06:35.600
thousand times right I like two orderlies came in and we're like yeah

06:35.600 --> 06:39.600
like is your dad divorced does he have a fungus in his foot I'm like I'm like I'm

06:39.600 --> 06:43.560
like there was I watched the data get shuffled there was like like the doctor

06:43.560 --> 06:47.480
eventually it's like and when did your dad die I'm like he never died like you

06:47.480 --> 06:51.080
guys just keep asking the same questions I'm trying to answer them as fast as

06:51.080 --> 06:56.400
possible I got two parents I got some brothers and sisters I don't smoke

06:56.400 --> 07:02.480
anymore I drink a lot I never hydrate I'm a fucking walking time bomb my dick

07:02.480 --> 07:10.720
burns I read on the internet it probably means I got so UTI all right it's true

07:10.720 --> 07:14.520
so so the guy was like but the guy was like he's like he's like yeah you know

07:14.520 --> 07:18.680
hey you know what do you it sounds like you drink a lot more coffee than you used

07:18.680 --> 07:25.800
to and you never had any water since like Clinton and like you know he's got

07:25.800 --> 07:30.720
you know he's a good guy and he's like if we were in a world of socialized

07:30.720 --> 07:34.320
medicine this is the guy you want because he's not gonna immediately prescribe

07:34.320 --> 07:39.240
me something right I want the prescription my dick hurts but he's

07:39.240 --> 07:45.680
like you know come on you're 46 you know that's so much coffee you know sometimes

07:45.680 --> 07:50.960
you irritate your bladder is he is your doctor but it's your daughter yeah so I

07:50.960 --> 07:54.720
go I go okay all right that sounds great doctor but what it is there an

07:54.720 --> 08:02.000
antibiotic that like if I took it and I didn't have a bacterial infection in my

08:02.000 --> 08:09.240
dick hole would it kill me no do you want you want that yes I do yeah yeah it

08:09.240 --> 08:14.440
is there anything how many tests can you run on the cup of pee I gave you with my

08:14.440 --> 08:19.400
broken dick well we could do this and do it do them all I'm not gonna know them

08:19.400 --> 08:22.880
by name do them all do all that is there a lab yes there's a lab upstairs I'll

08:22.880 --> 08:26.520
send it to the lab well that's gonna say yeah I don't get sent it don't send the

08:26.520 --> 08:32.400
pee to everything give me all the shit and then I as I was walking out I'm like

08:32.400 --> 08:36.960
by the way is this the shit you scribbled on a fucking magic thing that's

08:36.960 --> 08:41.960
gonna make the thing downstairs make give me a bottle of pills is that the thing

08:41.960 --> 08:44.760
that makes your pee orange that also makes you not feel like you have to be

08:44.760 --> 08:51.800
oh no no that's just a painkiller do you want that too yes yes okay can I be a

08:51.800 --> 08:59.160
doctor now I did so much today I did so much diagnosis I sent so many things to

08:59.160 --> 09:03.920
so many labs I diagnosed myself I prescribed myself I gave myself a

09:03.920 --> 09:09.360
prognosis by the way I've got like five years left to live like I did all I can

09:09.360 --> 09:14.400
I can I just can I have more money that's like a lot of people have that

09:14.400 --> 09:18.440
unfortunate experience they call it like you got to be your own health advocate

09:18.440 --> 09:22.840
or some such which just means like the doctor don't give a fuck yeah but I do

09:22.840 --> 09:26.200
think I mean I walked out of there thinking like I wanted to be outraged

09:26.200 --> 09:29.760
but then I gave it a second thought and I was like well wait a minute you'd be

09:29.760 --> 09:36.440
you'd be more outraged if you're Beverly Hills doctor like if you went in

09:36.440 --> 09:40.520
with an itchy dick and he was like well just to be careful we should do all

09:40.520 --> 09:44.840
these eight million things right you'd be outraged for that reason yeah it's a

09:44.840 --> 09:48.760
I have a doctor who's pretty good about like just being like hey I think I think

09:48.760 --> 09:52.920
I need a cough syrup and it'll be like oh okay if you say so it feels great

09:52.920 --> 09:56.680
because I just like I just go in it's like a store it didn't feel like a

09:56.680 --> 10:01.640
gateway it was like like like when you realize in in Stardew Valley that you

10:01.640 --> 10:05.520
can build the greenhouse you know it's like oh shit I can grow like cantaloupe

10:05.520 --> 10:11.480
in the winter can I tell you something that happened to me about three days

10:11.480 --> 10:15.480
ago that's pretty important to me all right okay I mean you're going through

10:15.480 --> 10:18.960
some medical woes right now yeah well before I go on are you feeling better

10:18.960 --> 10:22.440
are you recovering I feel great I'm on some weird pill that makes your piss

10:22.440 --> 10:26.280
orange and like makes you never feel like you have to pee I might be pissing

10:26.280 --> 10:31.920
my pants right now with orange piss yes well you should always wear blue pants

10:31.920 --> 10:36.000

10:36.000 --> 10:40.800

doesn't want to know if I'd saw it like off-broadway as a helicopter pilot he's

12:18.480 --> 12:23.000
aware he's the geographic ambiguities as well have you ever seen Greece who

12:23.000 --> 12:27.200

12:27.200 --> 12:31.560

12:35.000 --> 12:40.480

proud of being a celebrity wedding I want I want to have a celebrity wedding

12:53.120 --> 12:58.960
oh wait I did and then I got divorced all right don't don't have a celebrity

12:58.960 --> 13:02.000

13:02.000 --> 13:04.760
that at least so we're gonna go out there fancy pants down now here's this

13:04.760 --> 13:09.920
beautiful like f-star or four-star or something star chopper and the guy goes

13:09.920 --> 13:15.480
have you ever seen Greece the movie like yeah and he goes your pilot is Lorenzo

13:15.480 --> 13:24.600
Lamas wait what the fuck that's what I said and so I freak out because I don't

13:24.600 --> 13:29.640
know if any beauty school dropout no no he has he has no lines he has a jock

13:29.640 --> 13:33.600
in it at the end of it but he's also renegade the TV show in the 90s yeah

13:33.600 --> 13:38.200
he's a Golden Globe winner from Falcon crest I guess most importantly he's the

13:38.200 --> 13:41.560
guy that Billy Crystal's doing an impression of when he says you look

13:41.560 --> 13:46.200
marvelous that's Fernando Lamas that oh okay who's his dad Lorenzo Lamas no he

13:46.200 --> 13:52.360
was okay okay he was that he he he yeah he was in like weird like renegade yeah

13:52.360 --> 13:56.160
where he was that you like had a talking he was a he was never talking

13:56.160 --> 13:59.520
spaceship but I'm sure he did but he but he a lot of people back then did and

13:59.520 --> 14:05.240
you know it I believe renegade turned in crooked cops and they framed him for

14:05.240 --> 14:09.040
murder so he and a Native American and a woman go off just to kind of set the

14:09.040 --> 14:13.960
record straight my favorite show favorite show you never saw renegade I want

14:13.960 --> 14:18.160
to know nothing more about it I wore I I just love that it's three people instead

14:18.160 --> 14:22.200
of either two or five that's probably fine he and a Native American and a woman

14:22.200 --> 14:26.920
okay I'm already like in show you I'm gonna show you because it's three people

14:26.920 --> 14:30.840
so it's always gonna be kind of weird I did a screen grab what we took the lift

14:30.840 --> 14:35.880
here I have a screen grab of the poster or like the ad the billboard ad for

14:35.880 --> 14:40.000
renegade and this is gonna ring some bells for you Dan this is important yeah

14:40.000 --> 14:45.320
I'm remembering now I realized the llamas that's yeah oh yeah he was man that

14:45.320 --> 14:55.600
is we'll put it on the social media okay so he you were hanging out with him so

14:55.600 --> 14:59.480
no so wait he flew yeah he flew the fucking captain so we get on the we get

14:59.480 --> 15:03.280
in the chopper there's three in the back I'm one and it's and two other yet like

15:03.280 --> 15:07.360
another young couple that's a weird thing but I'm sorry to cut you up I will

15:07.360 --> 15:10.680
talk about this for the first time on a helicopter yeah so here's the thing like

15:10.680 --> 15:13.560
keep your head down when you get in because there's a thing on top that'll

15:13.560 --> 15:17.200
cut your head off I'm gonna tighten your seatbelt real quick hey by the way do

15:17.200 --> 15:24.400
you like dentistry yeah I do your pilot's a dentist bye like don't leave me

15:24.400 --> 15:29.600
with that thought I don't care how good a dentist I think this guy saw that I was

15:29.600 --> 15:35.120
over 40 and right know who Lorenzo Lamas is I mean I guess he's also seen a

15:35.120 --> 15:39.400
bunch of helicopters that didn't go down so he's comfortable just being like hey

15:39.400 --> 15:47.440
here's a trivial thing your pilot not his first calling but it is later but my

15:47.440 --> 15:51.920
mind's tightening seat belts and doing trivia bye famous people famous people

15:51.920 --> 15:57.960
love being pilots for some reason I read up on it today he loves flying

15:57.960 --> 16:03.000
choppers he flies through the Grand Canyon to fly over New York City but

16:03.000 --> 16:06.120
he's decided even supposed to fly through the Grand Canyon he sounds like a

16:06.120 --> 16:11.000
terrible pilot he was the lowest altitude it's lower than the ground he's

16:11.000 --> 16:14.160
technically crashing he found the only place he can do that without crashing

16:14.160 --> 16:18.040
because he's fucking throwing what's called a helicopter tantrum so we

16:18.040 --> 16:21.480
learning through the Grand Canyon what you're technically doing is crashing and

16:21.480 --> 16:26.920
living we hop on board and we get in the thing and I'm in the backseat with

16:26.920 --> 16:30.520
two others Jesse is in the frenzy and you get the headset with the with the

16:30.520 --> 16:35.080
microphone and and he's and he's getting things talking to the tower you can hear

16:35.080 --> 16:38.200
all the chatter and on your on your headset all the radio communication and

16:38.200 --> 16:41.640
we can all hear each other I coughed into it by accident and you can everybody

16:41.640 --> 16:48.120
could hear me cough so we get up in the air and I go are you are you captain

16:48.120 --> 16:53.840
Lamas and and and he goes yes I am I go it's nice to meet you asking it's nice

16:53.840 --> 16:59.320
to meet you sort he's got shorts on he's tan and he's fucking beautiful he's

16:59.320 --> 17:04.160
absolutely beautiful and I was just hoping that Jesse would just give him

17:04.160 --> 17:08.680
like a handy like something like make it make this count and he's flying and all

17:08.680 --> 17:15.560
I want to do is ask Fernando Lamas questions and I got the calm on and

17:15.560 --> 17:20.000
what's that guy what what what kind of aircraft would fly in here captain and

17:20.000 --> 17:23.720
he's like it's a death star and I don't know something like that a star it's a

17:23.720 --> 17:27.040
death star it's a death star and we're going and you're right over the deck

17:27.040 --> 17:30.200
it's Jurassic Park with the thing without the pelicans flying alongside and

17:30.200 --> 17:35.720
we're going along and I just I'm dying I got to talk to him and the only thing I

17:35.720 --> 17:42.800
said to him the whole flight was said oh hey captain yeah answer that what's our

17:42.800 --> 17:51.160
altitude and he goes 500 and that was it that was it and then we landed and I

17:51.160 --> 17:55.200
thought maybe get a fucking picture with Fernando Fernando Lorenzo Lamas and he

17:55.200 --> 17:58.560
will come out and like he knows that we all want to photo with him because he's

17:58.560 --> 18:02.360
clearly aware that I'm a fan or at least I just want to interrupt with one

18:02.360 --> 18:07.280
thing because it's important you can enter your recovery that's Jeff just

18:07.280 --> 18:11.080
told a celebrity story that didn't end with the celebrity thanking him for

18:11.080 --> 18:15.080
talking to him yeah that was the exact that was so brave for you the exact oh

18:15.080 --> 18:19.200
yeah this is just an unremarkable encounter with a celebrity and you just

18:19.200 --> 18:24.520
took the L I don't this is not easy for me he we land he does a beautiful land

18:24.520 --> 18:30.400
and he landed on a dime and gave you some change and then that's a that is a

18:30.400 --> 18:36.120
really accurate helicopter landed that and then we get out and they go you got

18:36.120 --> 18:39.280
to run off and then take off your safety a harness thing you get like a little

18:39.280 --> 18:46.800
safety pack around you in case you die and he instantly just right out it's

18:46.800 --> 18:50.440
like I'm sorry Angie Harmon's on the set of resilient yeah but also he has to go

18:50.440 --> 18:55.240
solve the murder that he was framed for like yeah yeah yeah you don't know that

18:55.240 --> 19:01.880
it's just good shit and I'm still not over it Lorenzo Lamas flew me to to

19:01.880 --> 19:06.160
Catalina Islands I mean I would be talking about that for a long time

19:06.160 --> 19:10.440
these kids seem to agree let's bring up Brandon Johnson everybody Brandon

19:10.440 --> 19:23.680
Johnson yeah and let's escalate things but first Brandon how's it going how's

19:23.680 --> 19:29.920
your what's it like doing a voice on the Simpsons for like 40 years you know

19:29.920 --> 19:33.440
they they decided let's just let's blow it out with a little Brandon Johnson

19:33.440 --> 19:40.040
talent guess who's disappointed how is it going it's good to have you back it's

19:40.040 --> 19:43.080
good to be here I just stopped by to see what you guys were up to there was a

19:43.080 --> 19:46.920
chance Jeff was gonna be late so I stood there's always stood on the circle I

19:46.920 --> 19:52.400
stood on deck just in case because I was taking the boat back and Patrick

19:52.400 --> 20:00.560
Swayze is dead he's dead hey look man dead men tell no tales that's that's the

20:00.560 --> 20:04.360
problem he was on a ghost ship I'm sorry that's it's import taste he's a

20:04.360 --> 20:08.360
beloved actor that probably all right anyway it's funny you say that because I

20:08.360 --> 20:11.920
did the exact same joke as someone said no he's dead I did the same joke really

20:11.920 --> 20:15.680
is it is just like in our iCloud I guess that's the guy that would be piloted

20:15.680 --> 20:22.000
Patrick Swayze I think I meant Patrick Stewart I was we should have gone with

20:22.000 --> 20:26.360
like like Morgan Freeman anybody like no he's to a he's to a level where you need

20:26.360 --> 20:31.320
that B ish level anyway Brandon how's it going it's so good but let's you I know

20:31.320 --> 20:34.200
what you're saying let's get to it right let's just get to it I was here

20:34.200 --> 20:38.240
just in case y'all know me it's good to see you but yeah let's get to it I really

20:38.240 --> 20:42.040
am enamored with our guest I want her to remember this is a powerful time but

20:42.040 --> 20:44.440
that's also not going to affect my behavior like for instance I'm gonna

20:44.440 --> 20:49.000
I'm not gonna get shitfaced before the show and then fumble everything but I am

20:49.000 --> 20:54.360
I'm I'm look I this is a this is the story of a person who was being made fun

20:54.360 --> 21:03.040
of from childhood for her voice and then through no seeking of her own ended up

21:03.040 --> 21:07.360
being coming incredibly famous for that exact same voice and I would imagine

21:07.360 --> 21:11.920
although we haven't asked her yet I almost think that that voice like may

21:11.920 --> 21:16.400
prohibit her from being in like your average like movies now that are all

21:16.400 --> 21:20.440
made from CG maybe that's one thing we'll ask her about but gotta be one of

21:20.440 --> 21:26.720
the most famous voices we you'll ever hear but also an incredible person

21:26.720 --> 21:31.880
happens to be the the connection here is that she makes like this incredibly

21:31.880 --> 21:35.960
gourmet true crime podcast Dan we hate true crime we hate that you're into it

21:35.960 --> 21:40.760
fuck off it's actually it's actually a show you'd love if you weren't into true

21:40.760 --> 21:45.640
crime also she's she's she's her look let me put it this way her Wikipedia page

21:45.640 --> 21:52.680
I'd trade it in a second it's a good Wikipedia page it's the kind you'd want

21:52.680 --> 21:59.280
if a safe fell on your head and you had her Wikipedia page you'd love it but

21:59.280 --> 22:03.480
all I'm gonna do is ask her questions about Maximum Overdrive please welcome

22:03.480 --> 22:11.520
actress writer performer the activist stateswoman hopefully new friend Yardley

22:11.520 --> 22:31.400
Smith

22:31.400 --> 22:42.200
anywhere you like yeah yeah oh yeah yeah you can move my the metaphor for my

22:42.200 --> 22:49.800
is there any room for this table to have function no there's not in its place

22:49.800 --> 22:59.520
my awareness so let's I want to start with your upbringing because I did go

22:59.520 --> 23:02.560
through your Wikipedia page a little bit first of all thank you for coming

23:02.560 --> 23:07.920
those I don't know who writes them collectively a swarm a swarm it's so

23:07.920 --> 23:13.400
weird and it's weird that you can't go in and edit them yourself I bet you could

23:13.400 --> 23:17.960
if you really wanted to you can't you can't I've tried actually I've tried to

23:17.960 --> 23:22.680
get some stuff off there for a really no it I don't know how it's run there's

23:22.680 --> 23:26.600
there's things on there that just really shouldn't be there it's a hundred percent

23:26.600 --> 23:33.680
true because you used to be the Sultan of Brunei I did yes and I tried to say

23:33.680 --> 23:40.280
it's no longer relevant like fuck off we're keeping it like what is that but

23:40.280 --> 23:45.240
is it do you ever look at yours I haven't in a very long time I haven't I

23:45.240 --> 23:49.880
actually you know it's funny I was reading an article in Vanity Fair or

23:49.880 --> 23:56.920
something and it was an old archived article and it said that I think it was

23:56.920 --> 24:00.480
actually about Jennifer Lopez and it was and Jennifer Lopez was saying oh I

24:00.480 --> 24:03.640
never read interviews about myself and the interviewer was saying in

24:03.640 --> 24:08.960
parentheses PS celebrities always say that and they always read interviews

24:08.960 --> 24:14.560
about themselves that's actually not true it's not true I like I don't read

24:14.560 --> 24:18.960
interviews about myself I rarely rarely listened to interviews I give I never

24:18.960 --> 24:22.680
read reviews anymore I don't read the good or the bad it just doesn't help me

24:22.680 --> 24:27.520
no it's very odd it's odd to be objectified in that way and it can really

24:27.520 --> 24:32.640
well the prophet wears off it can only get you so high yes and then if you're

24:32.640 --> 24:36.640
a responsible person you're like oh I can only go down I think if the if you're

24:36.640 --> 24:40.680
healthy and you're privileged enough to be famous for a certain amount of time I

24:40.680 --> 24:44.840
would expect it to top off where you're like I'm not looking at any of it but

24:44.840 --> 24:49.960
it has the weird effect of like oh I hate my own name I can't I can't like oh I

24:49.960 --> 24:53.320
go to YouTube and I'm like I wish I knew how to build a model airplane I'm like

24:53.320 --> 24:55.920
yeah but you're Dan Harmon don't you want to read why Rick and Morty sucked in

24:55.920 --> 25:01.520
season three like no I don't anything about anything that I was anything to

25:01.520 --> 25:05.680
do with my name and my my sorry I shouldn't do all the talking I'm a bad

25:05.680 --> 25:10.320
interviewer you I do actually want to know how you came up with Rick and

25:10.320 --> 25:20.320
Morty you've made a grave error here you know God did well how we did because

25:20.320 --> 25:28.880
you know the show you work on rips it off every week I want to say to you

25:28.880 --> 25:32.080
though because as I was reading your Wikipedia page at the bar before the

25:32.080 --> 25:37.280
show I'm like I want I bet this person doesn't look at her Wikipedia page

25:37.280 --> 25:42.280
because I bet she's very healthy and I bet she deserves to know this is an

25:42.280 --> 25:48.000
immaculate Wikipedia page oh you it it like just when you think what a nice

25:48.000 --> 25:54.520
person what a good solid person right at the end it's like it's like no right at

25:54.520 --> 25:59.680
the end it's like oh by the way huge LGBTQ fucking like benefactor and it's

25:59.680 --> 26:07.800
like like snow in the camera like like like like didn't ask for it didn't come

26:07.800 --> 26:12.960
hat in hand you're just like oh yeah by the way gay people do like fucking nailed

26:12.960 --> 26:19.680
it that's true yes you did a one-woman show about where you're like you know

26:19.680 --> 26:24.760
bearing all and being honest about this this very I would say strange career

26:24.760 --> 26:30.200
you've had yes so let's talk about that now for Brandon you're okay you got a

26:30.200 --> 26:38.320
drink settle in let's go some of the striking stuff that I that about your

26:38.320 --> 26:48.520
early career is this is the alienation because you didn't you you I you express

26:48.520 --> 26:54.640
to interviewers in the past about coming out here and let's set the stage it's

26:54.640 --> 27:03.880
like what 80 when do you came out here in like 80s 86 early 86 and and and as

27:03.880 --> 27:07.520
you described it and as someone described your description in Wikipedia it

27:07.520 --> 27:12.280
was like on a half-promise of something which I think is everyone's story that

27:12.280 --> 27:16.920
comes from somewhere to LA I'd gotten an LA agent had a New York agent I'd done

27:16.920 --> 27:24.520
incredibly well in New York I had I'd been there for literally six weeks I had

27:24.520 --> 27:28.640
auditioned for Mike Nichols who was directing a Tom Stopper play on Broadway

27:28.640 --> 27:39.880
I got that job what that's that's crazy yeah hey I just I'm new in town before

27:39.880 --> 27:43.920
you can put your suitcase down you're working with geniuses I was but the

27:43.920 --> 27:48.280
funny thing was is that I didn't know the part I was auditioning for was

27:48.280 --> 27:53.800
actually to understudy Cynthia Nixon I thought it was to play Jeremy Irons'

27:53.800 --> 27:57.720
daughter but it was in fact to understudy to the Nixon who was playing Jeremy

27:57.720 --> 28:02.600
Irons' daughter and I was like fuck that fuck that noise I am not doing that and

28:02.600 --> 28:07.560
my agent was like who are you and also to be clear you are already East Coast

28:07.560 --> 28:11.840
like who comes to the West Coast to do a Tom Stopper play with my no no that was

28:11.840 --> 28:16.120
in New York okay so this is still wait so where were you what did you come out

28:16.120 --> 28:23.240
I remember wait wait don't tell me it was Paris I was born in Paris because my

28:23.240 --> 28:29.600
father was a foreign correspondent and so my and he was actually in Poland when

28:29.600 --> 28:34.160
my mother was pregnant with me and he was my mother I have an older brother

28:34.160 --> 28:38.280
who was born in London and she was in Poland when she was pregnant with him

28:38.280 --> 28:43.760
as well and the Polish doctors said to my mother you don't you don't speak the

28:43.760 --> 28:47.600
language very well and if something goes wrong we probably can't accommodate you

28:47.600 --> 28:53.720
as well as we you can in a Western country so go somewhere else so she went

28:53.720 --> 28:59.080
to London for my brother that was 1963 she went to Paris for me that was 1964

28:59.080 --> 29:03.560
and people think by the way that the phrase Polish medicine is racist it's

29:03.560 --> 29:07.600
totally how they practice they're just like hey you don't talk great get out of

29:07.600 --> 29:12.920
here we can't you don't understand us please go and she had an aunt and uncle

29:12.920 --> 29:21.240
summering in Paris so she went there so you so now it says French-born American

29:21.240 --> 29:26.880
actress which makes me sound like you know like I'm Juliet Benoche but it's

29:26.880 --> 29:32.240
nothing like that it's not at all like that it's so overstated and you described

29:32.240 --> 29:38.440
like being teased for your voice yeah yeah by friends and family alike it's I

29:38.440 --> 29:43.040
think your quote was it's basically been the same since I was six yes there it

29:43.040 --> 29:48.520
just didn't change like to what extent was that I mean what was that really like

29:48.520 --> 29:54.080
did you have moments of like whatever the vocal equivalent of looking in a

29:54.080 --> 29:58.600
mirror was and like wishing like like like like what's the vocal equivalent of

29:58.600 --> 30:02.040
patting the bra what's the vocal equivalent of like god damn it changed

30:02.040 --> 30:10.280
my voice or were you like fuck this I can't be ashamed of this I think I think

30:10.280 --> 30:15.000
I just didn't really excuse me I didn't really think that there was anything that

30:15.000 --> 30:22.920
would stop me from ruling the world I just but I also didn't think that I my

30:22.920 --> 30:27.600
voice would ever be my fortune so voiceover was never on the menu in terms

30:27.600 --> 30:32.440
of how I was going to rule the world so when people say when you got the

30:32.440 --> 30:35.640
Simpsons that must have been fantastic I was like I don't really care about

30:35.640 --> 30:39.840
voiceover it just I didn't like it just didn't even register and didn't

30:39.840 --> 30:44.960
register for a really long time because I think I it just it had never I never

30:44.960 --> 30:50.040
considered it an asset and I so I didn't have a voiceover agent it just was like

30:50.040 --> 30:55.800
that's not how it's good that's not how I'm gonna win so whatever nobody ever

30:55.800 --> 31:00.000
came up to you said you should be in voiceover with a no really what do you

31:00.000 --> 31:04.800
attribute this like the negative word would be narcissism although I don't

31:04.800 --> 31:09.480
call it negative like the idea that you're assuming like that your parents

31:09.480 --> 31:12.720
weren't actors they weren't directors they weren't I think your dad was a

31:12.720 --> 31:18.480
correspondent or yes he was a newspaper man and like these people weren't telling

31:18.480 --> 31:23.040
you oh Yardley you got to be an actor no but you're thinking your head one way

31:23.040 --> 31:28.240
or another I'm gonna dominate yes what do you ever have you thought does that

31:28.240 --> 31:32.160
come from nature or nurture is what we all want to know what the fuck is wrong

31:32.160 --> 31:37.520
with you no are you kidding we want to know how do I how do I manufacture this

31:37.520 --> 31:43.600
do I have to be born right or do I have to just think it and fucking do it it's

31:43.600 --> 31:52.880
a good question I don't remember a time well I think there it's two sides of

31:52.880 --> 32:01.880
the same coin so I remember being afraid of everything and so it wasn't that I

32:01.880 --> 32:08.200
was fearless it was that I had this overabundance of courage and if I did

32:08.200 --> 32:13.000
insurmountable in the face of extraordinary insecurity yeah because

32:13.000 --> 32:18.880
you're not gonna you're not gonna punch somebody no and I was small I mean I

32:18.880 --> 32:28.000
was just I was a little kid and I had this tiny tiny voice and and I and yet

32:28.000 --> 32:34.200
I had if there was a ferocity to me and so but I also and I always felt a little

32:34.200 --> 32:40.520
bit like I didn't belong and I remember being about five years old and there was

32:40.520 --> 32:43.640
a woman in my neighborhood in Washington DC where I grew up and she used to

32:43.640 --> 32:48.320
have this theater in the summers she had a one-car garage and she would get all

32:48.320 --> 32:52.940
the kids together and and she would make us lip-sync to musicals like the

32:52.940 --> 32:56.680
Sound of Music and Fiddler on the Roof and she would dress us up and she would

32:56.680 --> 33:01.200
also do these things like living portraits right and so I was a portrait

33:01.200 --> 33:06.040
of Mary that Mary Cassatt did this American artist and I was this it was

33:06.040 --> 33:10.760
little girl in straw hat so music was playing I remember my knees were knocking

33:10.760 --> 33:16.480
and there was a curtain and the curtain drew back and as soon as the light hit

33:16.480 --> 33:25.360
me my knees stopped knocking and I thought like oh okay I think I'll be

33:25.360 --> 33:31.080
alright here and and I just sort of I think I just felt like I belong and

33:31.080 --> 33:35.120
then after that I started to do plays and the great thing about doing a play

33:35.120 --> 33:40.600
was even if it had a sad ending I knew how it ended and I could prepare for it

33:40.600 --> 33:46.480
it was like predicting the future yeah and so that and managing your

33:46.480 --> 33:51.200
relationship with yes other people and it can either be your tormentor yes they

33:51.200 --> 33:55.000
can sit the fuck down and watch you you knew it was gonna happen and did you

33:55.000 --> 33:58.880
have the same because I did theaters a kid and stuff and I've always felt very

33:58.880 --> 34:02.480
comfortable in theater did you did you get the same comfort backstage with the

34:02.480 --> 34:06.760
cast and the you know the crew and all that did you get the same kind of there's

34:06.760 --> 34:11.320
that is that kind of familial very yes and I loved the relationship with the

34:11.320 --> 34:18.320
audience that exchange of energy was was extraordinary and it was really

34:18.320 --> 34:24.160
powerful and I remember my first play in my first like real play we did I

34:24.160 --> 34:27.840
remember mama and I played the youngest daughter and my very first line I got

34:27.840 --> 34:32.520
this huge laugh and I remember how powerful that was and I just thought all

34:32.520 --> 34:35.880
right do you remember it changing the dynamic in your social structure was

34:35.880 --> 34:40.160
there a moment when you were because I remember being a dork and stinky and

34:40.160 --> 34:46.920
boy did that change but but there was there was a certain there was a shift I

34:46.920 --> 34:51.120
don't I don't have a dramatic moment of it but I was very much not gonna stop

34:51.120 --> 34:56.960
doing drama club and improv classes because of do you remember did it change

34:56.960 --> 35:01.480
the dynamic of your whole world did you go up on stage and do a thing and then

35:01.480 --> 35:05.160
the next day at school because I'm trying to place you in like a hallway or

35:05.160 --> 35:14.520
something yes you know I my theory is my experience was for the most part people

35:14.520 --> 35:24.040
were really happy and excited that I had clearly sort of I'd done really well and

35:24.040 --> 35:30.600
for lack of a better word I had sort of cast a spell to the extent that even

35:30.600 --> 35:34.880
their own parents had come up and been like what that was amazing right but

35:34.880 --> 35:40.120
also there were always kids who were not happy for you and I feel like any time

35:40.120 --> 35:45.320
as a young person and even as a grown-up I suppose but particularly hard when

35:45.320 --> 35:49.920
you're a kid you do something really well it sets you sets you apart from your

35:49.920 --> 35:55.200
peer group so if you're good at math or sports or drama or anything it sets you

35:55.200 --> 35:59.560
apart and that can be really isolating and actually I and so I don't know if

35:59.560 --> 36:04.560
I'm reading into this but it it sets you apart actually more profoundly from the

36:04.560 --> 36:07.920
people that were might have been closer to you had you stayed in your shell

36:07.920 --> 36:11.840
sure then it does the quarterback of the football team and the head cheerleader

36:11.840 --> 36:15.960
who are who are very content to go hey how about that yardly I had no problem

36:15.960 --> 36:19.800
with her before totally ignored her now very happy to give her the high school

36:19.800 --> 36:24.520
equivalent of best supporting actor like they become your biggest fan right they

36:24.520 --> 36:28.840
can they can comfortably make that shift and somebody that maybe you bonded

36:28.840 --> 36:34.600
with in the bathroom and cried with about how hard it feels to be alienated

36:34.600 --> 36:39.560
that may become a person that you actually hurt they they can feel left

36:39.560 --> 36:45.200
behind even though you had no intention of leaving them behind you only got an

36:45.200 --> 36:50.640
intention of dominating the world you got no time to think about come be in my

36:50.640 --> 37:01.120
world okay so let me dominate you I am a kind ruler I am a good kind ruler are

37:01.120 --> 37:06.520
you are you really we don't know this yet we get we'll fast forward in a second

37:06.520 --> 37:11.320
to like I mean but but I do want to dwell here for a second and just ask like

37:11.320 --> 37:16.360
what was the dynamic with the family because they weren't actors they weren't

37:16.360 --> 37:20.760
filmmakers they weren't did they have expectations of you were you letting them

37:20.760 --> 37:32.680
down when they suddenly realized that I want to perform I don't know that I well

37:32.680 --> 37:39.760
I think I think they were probably a bit worried that you were gonna live at home

37:39.760 --> 37:45.160
for a longer time than a doctor forever that it might not work out the way I

37:45.160 --> 37:48.880
had planned because they didn't really have a plan what's your plan Yardley I'm

37:48.880 --> 37:52.200
just gonna I'm gonna rule the world that's great the medical industry like

37:52.200 --> 37:56.600
laid it out in a brochure exactly your daughter will in six years be a

37:56.600 --> 38:00.880
registered blue baby blue right there there was no you know how are you gonna

38:00.880 --> 38:21.960
get there but you know in our family I feel like compliments were implied

38:21.960 --> 38:29.640
excellence was expected because it's a fucking beautiful way of describing the

38:29.640 --> 38:35.480
Midwest I was like wow I wish I could be that gracious let it going like me

38:35.480 --> 38:43.160
fucking beard suck bro compliments are implied yeah it was just you know there

38:43.160 --> 38:48.640
wasn't it wasn't well I would say other kind of person needs a compliment the

38:48.640 --> 38:53.800
answer is someone who doesn't deserve one that's the Midwestern philosophy you

38:53.800 --> 38:58.280
don't you don't plug an air hose into a person with a hole in their air supply

38:58.280 --> 39:07.200
it's not healthy yeah it was um it which is I think part of the you know the flip

39:07.200 --> 39:12.200
side of the coin and part of the insecurity of wanting to sort of get a

39:12.200 --> 39:20.040
kind of global love global recognition excuse me to make up for this kind of

39:20.040 --> 39:25.800
for this hole and I have spoken people say like oh Yardley you know I joke

39:25.800 --> 39:29.880
sometimes like if I was more like this I would be more successful and they're

39:29.880 --> 39:34.560
like shut the fuck up you're so you are so successful and how can you say that

39:34.560 --> 39:38.440
and there is this feeling inside if you really really want to get granular about

39:38.440 --> 39:48.080
it that if I if I felt truly successful then this this kind of forever hole

39:48.080 --> 39:53.760
inside would feel filled but the truth of the matter is is that you can't fill

39:53.760 --> 39:57.840
up the inside from the outside and that's what my one-woman show was about

39:57.840 --> 40:09.120
she's talking to black woman shit tonight very impressive I think it's

40:09.120 --> 40:13.080
important to note here for cynics and things because I mean I think the when

40:13.080 --> 40:17.800
you take a deep dive and you really bother to think about it and the Simpsons

40:17.800 --> 40:25.360
which has been on the air longer than the Bible it and we'll go I mean well

40:25.360 --> 40:29.760
obviously it's like we should talk about like those first moments of

40:29.760 --> 40:34.920
auditioning and things but like I it's it's important to note that like

40:34.920 --> 40:39.200
everybody who knows anything about that show and why it's successful why you

40:39.200 --> 40:45.200
have an Emmy which you I saw on the internet you you don't believe is real

40:45.200 --> 40:51.840
I do now but it didn't closet for nine years but like it that that show in

40:51.840 --> 40:55.320
general every performer on that show I kind of collectively everybody that

40:55.320 --> 41:01.920
worked on that show I mean it was it was an animated show that it I think your

41:01.920 --> 41:08.600
your your portrayal like a it exemplifies the fact like there's a

41:08.600 --> 41:13.160
lot of quotes from grain egg and from editors and directors casting directors

41:13.160 --> 41:18.280
friends of yours and things that are kind of like yeah she didn't like it who

41:18.280 --> 41:23.040
knows flukeity fluke who knows how you end up being the voice of a cartoon but

41:23.040 --> 41:27.080
like the important thing about that cartoon and the reason why it's now in

41:27.080 --> 41:34.480
its 60th season is because of this weird blend of grounded dramatic

41:34.480 --> 41:42.800
performance and cartoonishly accessible voices I got I mean you're being drawn

41:42.800 --> 41:50.120
and so it's like yeah so I just wanted to take that detour for a second in case

41:50.120 --> 41:54.520
anybody like in the audience is like listening to our our path through your

41:54.520 --> 41:59.000
career and going like what the fuck man whatever you show up for an audition you

41:59.000 --> 42:02.400
got a squeaky voice you end up like the voice of a thing it's like no this is

42:02.400 --> 42:06.280
not like this there are there are no flukes here and in fact what you're

42:06.280 --> 42:10.760
describing is actually kind of like something that you're not allowed to own

42:10.760 --> 42:16.040
as a person which is this what if of like yeah but what if I mean I was

42:16.040 --> 42:19.840
designed for world domination and I fucking dominated it through the most

42:19.840 --> 42:25.960
random channel what if what if that channel hadn't been there I might have

42:25.960 --> 42:30.000
been a senator I might have been I don't know like like and I won't put you on

42:30.000 --> 42:35.200
the spot with that but I just wanted to drunkenly disrupt everything

42:35.200 --> 42:40.720
early Dan and I were friends with Sam Simon and I was talking about the early

42:40.720 --> 42:45.120
days of that and he was talking about how he didn't like the way it changed

42:45.120 --> 42:50.720
after so many seasons and you know because he's Sam and he you know he left

42:50.720 --> 42:54.920
after what two seasons or something like that three or four I guess but he was

42:54.920 --> 42:59.680
talking about it and I remember him saying that like going down the list of

42:59.680 --> 43:03.840
the cast of characters what Bart is what Homer is what Marge is and he said Lisa

43:03.840 --> 43:07.800
is the conscience of the show yes and that's why Lisa is the one that makes

43:07.800 --> 43:11.760
you cry yeah yeah that's great well these amazing episodes the Homer's

43:11.760 --> 43:16.240
crayon one I mean I'm I'm not gonna pretend I've watched all 700,000

43:16.240 --> 43:22.040
episodes of The Simpsons but I I mean the I understand why your performance got

43:22.040 --> 43:26.960
a voice over Emmy I died you you said you accept it now you definitely need to

43:26.960 --> 43:30.640
accept it I'm taking my two Emmys I got one for writing the Oscars that's

43:30.640 --> 43:38.880
cheating it's the most watched thing and ever of course you got an Emmy you

43:38.880 --> 43:46.300
wrote the Oscars that's right bitch and now I got a statue that says I'm

43:46.300 --> 43:55.760
talented so now I am you however earned it so so let's I mean so you go to New

43:55.760 --> 43:59.200
York you do the Mike Nichols thing there's a I think one of your first jobs

43:59.200 --> 44:04.640
is maximum overdrive I like you you said something amazing about it in your

44:04.640 --> 44:13.320
Wikipedia page good don't don't sustain your applause like you had a quote in

44:13.320 --> 44:17.600
the quote trickled down to your Wikipedia which is those exactly what those

44:17.600 --> 44:22.920
people are thinking which was something like truly dreadful movie but a

44:22.920 --> 44:29.640
fantastic role it was it was a bomb when it came out I've been in several of

44:29.640 --> 44:35.960
those but the great thing about the early 80s so I think I so I also did a

44:35.960 --> 44:40.720
movie called the legend of Billy Jean right yes Queen I think the kids say

44:40.720 --> 44:45.920
now yes that's what they say so I my first movie was a movie called heaven

44:45.920 --> 44:52.440
help us that was in 1984 would know what heaven help us everybody was in that

44:52.440 --> 44:59.800
movie Andrew McCarthy Patrick Dempsey Kevin Dillon Mary Stuart Masterson

44:59.800 --> 45:03.680
okay but what was Donald Sutherland what was the plot it was about a Catholic

45:03.680 --> 45:08.280
boys school in the 1960s it was sort of about it originally it was actually a

45:08.280 --> 45:12.760
quite serious script about the corporal punishment that goes on in a boys school

45:12.760 --> 45:16.600
in Catholic boys school in the 60s and then by the time they were done with it

45:16.600 --> 45:20.320
it was more like porkies goes to Catholic school I know I've seen this for

45:20.320 --> 45:24.560
sure so that wasn't and it was directed by Michael dinner who then went on to

45:24.560 --> 45:28.840
make a dinner sorry just a fun name

45:28.840 --> 45:42.200
he went on to create the wonder you can call him Ray I actively sabotage

45:42.200 --> 45:46.120
myself as a podcast like it's a great episode you're on it keep talking

45:46.120 --> 45:54.360
please I'm so sorry no it's fine it's all good so so after that I did the

45:54.360 --> 45:59.840
legend of Billy Jean Helen Slater was yes and Christian Slater not related

45:59.840 --> 46:05.760
although they play brother and sister so weird I know it's super weird they look

46:05.760 --> 46:10.400
kind of alike because they both you know they dyed his hair blonde and but any

46:10.400 --> 46:15.280
who not related and that movie was such a bomb was barely out long enough to run

46:15.280 --> 46:22.800
the end credits but what was great was was 1985 and cable television had just

46:22.800 --> 46:27.360
come on the scene and they didn't have anything so they ran that fucking thing

46:27.360 --> 46:33.720
ad nauseam I was 24-7 and it is now this huge cult classic which I was just

46:33.720 --> 46:39.680
gonna say like same as a drive oh but they then the same and when the WGA

46:39.680 --> 46:44.080
negotiates with the PGA the the professional professional golfers

46:44.080 --> 46:49.920
association like they talk about these windows and things like and it's like it

46:49.920 --> 46:55.240
all has to do with like when we were kids and I was like why do I think up the

46:55.240 --> 47:00.960
creek was such a classic well because you saw it 75 thousand times I watched

47:00.960 --> 47:08.640
crawl for like two years that was all that was the only thing that was on but

47:08.640 --> 47:13.800
that's also like the original Star Trek series yes similar paradigm like they

47:13.800 --> 47:18.320
didn't they got canceled right out of the gate yes and then it was just such a

47:18.320 --> 47:23.800
success in syndication it's like I think that's always a TV writer producers

47:23.800 --> 47:28.680
like you you early on you have that conflict where you see your numbers or

47:28.680 --> 47:33.120
whatever someone tells you you failed on Thursday night you fucked up you didn't

47:33.120 --> 47:37.920
do good what do you mean it into good well the hammer you hit the things slid

47:37.920 --> 47:42.560
up and it didn't hit the bell that says you're a muscle man and which means

47:42.560 --> 47:48.200
retaining the offices numbers by 90% or higher and you're like I always I mean I

47:48.200 --> 47:53.760
it was it was such a late motif back then where it was like oh give me a break if

47:53.760 --> 47:57.080
you just mark at the show better or give us a better time slot these people only

47:57.080 --> 48:01.880
like what you tell them to kind of catch yourself in that moment going like

48:01.880 --> 48:07.280
wait what do I believe in at all right I do do I believe in like making a thing

48:07.280 --> 48:10.440
this is what this is not what this interview should be about let's let's

48:10.440 --> 48:13.720
let's go back to the legend of Billie Jean which is a fantastic fucking movie

48:13.720 --> 48:19.400
that is inspired so many no it's terrible it's awful and so is Goonies and

48:19.400 --> 48:23.120
suddenly like there's so many fucking movies that people think are good they

48:23.120 --> 48:28.800
just fucking suck but what is it what is a good movies job it's to be there but

48:28.800 --> 48:34.840
I okay it's to be there when you're going through puberty you're just like

48:34.840 --> 48:41.360
drinking up and you're like I'm coming looking at talking trucks transformers are amazing

48:41.360 --> 48:48.640
fair enough I mean people really did for whatever reason it was it was a movie

48:48.640 --> 48:51.640
that people really loved and I get recognized for it about once a week

48:51.640 --> 48:56.240
Billie Jean legend and maximum overdrive but mostly I think because I look

48:56.240 --> 49:00.200
exactly the same I am one of those people if you saw a picture of me when I

49:00.200 --> 49:05.400
was four you'd go hardly that's you you are super memorable and I sound the same

49:05.400 --> 49:11.440
yeah pretty much and this is me and this is Lisa Simpson she raises her voice

49:11.440 --> 49:18.240
a little bit sorry one thing about that though because that's important

49:18.240 --> 49:21.840
because one one very sage thing that you said I don't know when you learned it

49:21.840 --> 49:27.600
when you look back here I think around that time you said so much better tip to

49:27.600 --> 49:34.960
have a tiny role in a in a giant movie than to wait for the lead role in

49:34.960 --> 49:39.800
something that yeah like like like it's you can occupy that real estate by being

49:39.800 --> 49:46.320
yourself not yourself you're not those characters but being check you know is I

49:46.320 --> 49:50.400
mean it is there is that old saying you know it's not the size of the role it is

49:50.400 --> 49:57.720
it's this size and skill of the actor right but I do believe that for the most

49:57.720 --> 50:03.200
part with very few exceptions you can do a lot with not very much on the page

50:03.200 --> 50:10.280
right and so I was pretty much game for anything I have to ask like so because

50:10.280 --> 50:14.920
your director on maximum overdrive was literally Stephen King yes who was

50:14.920 --> 50:20.600
coming off of I believe as legend have it has it he's like he hated Kubrick's

50:20.600 --> 50:27.040
the shining yeah he's like god damn it what a shitty version of the shining if

50:27.040 --> 50:33.280
I Stephen King who wrote all these books if they just let me run the camera I'd

50:33.280 --> 50:41.280
give them what for yeah I'm not I mean I he's a fucking hero and I don't mean to

50:41.280 --> 50:47.520
piss but but like I I also watching that movie you're like well Kubrick also is

50:47.520 --> 50:53.400
an important person maybe it's an honor that you know maximum overdrive also was

50:53.400 --> 51:05.000
a 12-page short story it's just like I mean age 11 I was born in Maine I'm gonna

51:05.000 --> 51:09.040
die there I fucking have in the time of my life and my typewriter lost its

51:09.040 --> 51:15.160
backspace key amen amen sorry I'm a little jealous but but but how was he

51:15.160 --> 51:18.880
as a director on set like as a person like as a supporter he was lovely as pie

51:18.880 --> 51:23.080
as a person but apparently was also at the height of his alcoholism and drug

51:23.080 --> 51:30.080
addiction I love him so much oh my god so it was absolute chaos and we had so

51:30.080 --> 51:35.200
Dina De Laurentis was the was the production company so we had a pretty

51:35.200 --> 51:40.840
much all Italian crew who literally didn't speak English so we had Stephen

51:40.840 --> 51:45.480
who doesn't speak Italian and we had a translator I'm not even kidding we must

51:45.480 --> 51:50.400
have added I don't know two weeks in translation alone as he would say this

51:50.400 --> 51:55.160
is what I'd like to do in the translator labor to Italians the Italians would

51:55.160 --> 51:58.320
let him talk to the guy and the guy would then talk to Steve I'm like oh my

51:58.320 --> 52:02.760
fucking god and it just went on back and forth like that and he you know to his

52:02.760 --> 52:08.240
enormous credit he was very humble and said I I don't know what I'm doing and

52:08.240 --> 52:13.200
so they positioned people around him who did know what they were doing but they

52:13.200 --> 52:17.640
also didn't speak the language so it was quite cumbersome and Dino De Laurentis

52:17.640 --> 52:22.240
you know it was at the time when we and Canon films also was of the same sort of

52:22.240 --> 52:27.600
ilk where they just did everything on the cheap and when the you know the the

52:27.600 --> 52:33.160
tail hit five million that was the budget all right the truck put the people

52:33.160 --> 52:40.080
out calling AC DC yes done thanks for coming so it was an adventure and I

52:40.080 --> 52:44.760
actually remember there's a scene where the truck drives through the diner side

52:44.760 --> 52:50.360
wall the window picture window they had one opportunity to do that they built

52:50.360 --> 52:55.080
that truck stop and they they didn't have a stunt double for me and they said

52:55.080 --> 53:00.680
Yardley you're gonna stand there and the car this Cadillac is gonna drive through

53:00.680 --> 53:05.280
the wall don't worry it's gonna go super slow and it's gonna be so easy and safe

53:05.280 --> 53:09.760
and don't move until we tell you because we only have one shot at this and I'm

53:09.760 --> 53:17.320
like okay so you know I'm like okay so I do that and I'm not kidding you that

53:17.320 --> 53:24.400
fucking thing was going like 20 miles an hour it went so fast and it just plows

53:24.400 --> 53:36.280
through this wall and I am and finally I'm just like why don't you put someone in

53:36.280 --> 53:43.000
a way the shot is from behind me or it's no good or it's a shot of a car coming

53:43.000 --> 53:49.080
toward me shoot the fucking car I had so much hair you can't even see my face so

53:49.080 --> 53:53.200
yeah glass everywhere in my hair the whole thing yeah it was an adventure

53:53.200 --> 53:57.800
was it a CDC who made who was it did they write that for the movie or is that

53:57.800 --> 54:02.440
one of their songs I was hoping you'd know I don't know I bet you I bet they

54:02.440 --> 54:05.120
wrote it for the movie I'm sure they would I'm always so curious about that

54:05.120 --> 54:10.560
when there's like an 80s movie and it's like goblin dicks nine there's like a

54:10.560 --> 54:15.120
kind of a pseudo famous like band but it's like but this title of the song

54:15.120 --> 54:21.240
isn't goblin dicks it's like like my heart's like a goblin and you're kind of

54:21.240 --> 54:26.400
like are you just being classy or did they like how does this conversation

54:26.400 --> 54:31.440
with all the nightmare and elm street docking like good yeah well nightmare

54:31.440 --> 54:36.840
on elm street franchise I is has sucked in some of our world's greatest talent

54:36.840 --> 54:44.920
will smith will never escape like like the fat boys were got got drawn in do

54:44.920 --> 54:48.840
you know they wrote the they wrote the ghostbusters theme song before the movie

54:48.840 --> 54:54.600
the fat boys really Ray Parker Jr. Oh wait they had the ghostbusters song and

54:54.600 --> 54:57.760
then they were like we got to write a movie around this song

54:57.760 --> 55:03.120
is that true I don't know what your joke is I'm too drunk to follow your joke I

55:03.120 --> 55:11.280
just wanted to be included sorry so I told her Ray Parker Jr. lie by the way

55:11.280 --> 55:16.120
Brandon's been been a voice on the Simpsons for the last 35 years we wanted

55:16.120 --> 55:26.800
to find out if you knew I'm a stand-in for Hibbert who does dr. Hibbert who

55:26.800 --> 55:37.200
is the Harry that's the Harry Shira yes I take it this is a unexpected

55:37.200 --> 55:46.040
pregnancy characters fantastic that's such a when I moved to LA we would watch

55:46.040 --> 55:49.000
it and sit occasion with God damn you don't get funnier than this this is

55:49.000 --> 55:54.200
crazy when you guys all right when you were doing the start of on the Tracy

55:54.200 --> 55:57.840
Almond show yes and you guys do the little kind of in and out of commercials

55:57.840 --> 56:02.760
and stuff like that when you were doing that like how serious to that obviously

56:02.760 --> 56:05.760
you could have no idea what the future would be hold would hold for that show

56:05.760 --> 56:09.960
but I what was that like doing those little those little bits it was I

56:09.960 --> 56:18.000
remember so I got the job because I had done a play at the Fountain Theater here

56:18.000 --> 56:25.320
in LA that I think literally 17 people saw but one of those people a year later

56:25.320 --> 56:30.800
would cast the Simpsons on the Tracy Almond show so when people ask me how

56:30.800 --> 56:34.720
do I get into voiceover I'm like you're it's like asking me to solve your

56:34.720 --> 56:40.040
calculus program you know problem with an abacus I don't know because it I did

56:40.040 --> 56:44.440
it so it just was so odd for me it just didn't happen the way it usually happens

56:44.440 --> 56:49.360
so I went in to read and I originally read for Bart but that really lasted

56:49.360 --> 56:54.760
mere seconds and then and Nancy was there that day as well and she read for

56:54.760 --> 57:00.200
Lisa but she always wanted to read for Bart and she she did voiceover already

57:00.200 --> 57:05.480
like she was already an expert she was already doing cartoons and so I then

57:05.480 --> 57:10.720
read for Lisa had you not done a cartoon before oh no yeah no I again like

57:10.720 --> 57:15.040
voiceover I was like who I don't I don't care about voiceover but I was not an

57:15.040 --> 57:20.680
actor who ever said no to an audition so I you know I was like alright fine I'll

57:20.680 --> 57:25.880
go as long as it doesn't get in my way of world domination I'm good let's do this

57:25.880 --> 57:30.320
because it's a choice gig if you can do it there's no coming your pajamas you can

57:30.320 --> 57:36.200
like right but you know that thing people people do ask me that they're like

57:36.200 --> 57:44.600
do you gotta work in your pajamas like do you oh sorry well I do I but I got

57:44.600 --> 57:50.080
fired shortly after I did I did eventually the minute I thought it was

57:50.080 --> 57:57.680
possible I started doing it and then I got fired you know it it poses it raises

57:57.680 --> 58:03.760
more questions than it's a good point it's a very good point how close to to

58:03.760 --> 58:10.360
Lisa as we know it was your audition was it I think actually I I sounded more

58:10.360 --> 58:16.520
like myself in the beginning and then as as the characters got cuter as the

58:16.520 --> 58:21.800
animation got cuter her voice got a little bit cuter you know it got it

58:21.800 --> 58:25.640
morphed a little bit but not that much and what's interesting and a little bit

58:25.640 --> 58:31.760
sad and I'll let you in on a on a heartbreak a little bit so they finally

58:31.760 --> 58:40.120
finally I I I stumped for one of our phenomenal actresses Tress McNeil who

58:40.120 --> 58:47.560
does Crazy Cat Lady and Mrs. Skinner and Cookie Kwan and like any number of this

58:47.560 --> 58:51.040
she doesn't she's not doesn't do one of the family members but she does any

58:51.040 --> 58:57.560
number of the cast in Springfield and she does Shauna the the girlfriend of one

58:57.560 --> 59:03.240
of the bullies who talks like this you know she's this valley girl and so

59:03.240 --> 59:08.200
Tress wasn't at the read-through one day and I they said hardly why don't you do

59:08.200 --> 59:12.320
it so I said oh great I'll do it so it was really strong and they really loved

59:12.320 --> 59:18.120
it so the next couple of weeks they wrote a valley girl kind of friend for

59:18.120 --> 59:26.320
Lisa Simpson and the problem was is that if you ask me to do another character

59:26.320 --> 59:31.880
who's the same age as Lisa Simpson I don't have the ability to make the voice

59:31.880 --> 59:37.320
different enough to make it not sound like Lisa Simpson the difference in

59:37.320 --> 59:43.560
doing Lisa Simpson and Shauna is that Shauna is like 16 so that worked and so

59:43.560 --> 59:47.760
we recorded it and then I got an email from the producer saying I'm sorry

59:47.760 --> 59:54.680
hardly it's not different enough we're cutting it I'm like fuck dude I mean it's

59:54.680 --> 01:00:01.320
terrible so I really am a one-trick pony there you go who's the rangiest Harry

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:06.080
probably or oh I don't know Hank Dan and Harry I would say all three of them

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:09.880
really neck and neck to watch those guys go from voice to voice to voice it

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:15.480
never gets old like we me so Hank lives in New York Harry lives all over the

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:20.560
world so Dan Julie me and Nancy all record all together and Tress is there

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:26.720
often as well and to watch those guys go all of them do multiple voices and I

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:30.920
just I stand between them I stand between Nancy and Dan oh is that true yeah

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:33.880
and never gets old you guys all you if you're doing a scene you're all

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:37.040
physically in the room like an old radio play even if even if Harry or

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:42.400
whoever is out yeah he'll actually somebody will tempt for him and then

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:46.880
he'll do his stuff on his own but I've always wondered are you physically in

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:51.280
the room together is it all just wild stuff alone no we're all together in

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:55.160
the room that's gotta be important that's gotta make it gives it a really

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:58.440
different texture I mean because obviously the way you say something is

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:03.120
going to inform the way I answer and I think you know Jim Brooks James L. Brooks

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:09.760
our executive producer he comes from sitcoms and so when we first started

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:13.600
doing the bumpers as you were asking I think he was like I don't know why this

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:17.480
would be any different it doesn't matter to me that nobody can see you it's

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:21.720
still a conversation of course you'll all be together right and so while most

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:26.360
cartoons do do it separately like when we did that crossover with Family Guy I

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:31.200
went and did all my stuff by myself I didn't meet Mila Kunis even though my

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:35.760
scenes were with Meg I just they did all my stuff wild with which I can do of

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:38.640
course I know the character well enough you thought maybe when you're watching it

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.840
like it's not as fun you know I'd much rather do my stuff with the person I never

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.640
would have thought to ask you that question that's how much I would have

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:49.640
assumed yes I think everybody does I would have thought I've been high I

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.480
would be high-roading you to be like well you guys aren't in the room together

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:57.760
it's it's it's exciting to me that that's how they do it after all this year

01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:01.600
all these years it's still that way yes because it's pretty yeah from a

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:07.080
production standpoint it is needlessly extravagant you're talking about actors

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:10.720
schedules it's much easier to treat human beings like cattle shuffle them in

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:14.880
one at a time isolate all of them way less chance of anything uncontrollable

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:20.320
happening it's the way I just feel like you know it's my job and so you own me

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:26.240
so all right I'll show up but the way we did anomalies the way we did the

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:29.880
obids uncontrollable Christmas because we were doing like special things we were

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:35.120
absolutely like nope soundstage entire cast everyone's like well this is gonna

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:39.400
be terribly problematic if this person interrupts that person over like yeah but

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:46.320
I so I I think that's tremendously commendable I I wasn't I was a Simpson I

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:51.640
had a little part I did a little cameo and I went into the place where you guys

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:58.880
record and I saw multiple microphones we do we do you know sadly our guest stars

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:03.040
don't usually come and record with us mostly because their schedules don't

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:08.360
permit it it would have made me puke blood I would have been able to hand I

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:16.600
was it was just perfect I think I think it's that's the way you want to thank

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.840
you for coming and not true treat you like the most important person you don't

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:23.200
want to I know I'm telling you it's true the customer is always right I did not

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:34.600
want to be there with you I would have freaked out no I don't know okay so like

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.800
a banana peels and stoplights you end up in the longest running sitcom in

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:43.440
television fucking history yes along the way also though in the 90s like like

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:51.160
you like like like Herman's head what else was there don't hold your Herman's

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:57.560
head applause were you were you I was a devotee of Herman's head however I'm

01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:00.680
also an alcoholic so I can't remember if you were actually inside Herman's head

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:05.720
or not no I was in the office you were the you were the the boof to Herman's

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:11.000
Teen Wolf you were that you were the boof well okay that's my language for you

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:17.360
were the best friend yeah you were the the will they won't they I was yes in a

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:21.040
long term the Winnie Cooper the are not the Winnie Cooper it was so dumb I was

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:25.280
like yes it was like like like like like we were supposed to if that show

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:28.760
lasted more than eight episodes we were supposed to I think eventually be like

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:34.080
go to her right and then he did right I so Louie my character's name was Louise

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:40.400
she was really great fun and I was this sort of breakout character and they

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:44.960
wrote so I was like got some in each show I got always a really good funny joke

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:50.920
which I very much enjoyed and but then for some peculiar reason which didn't

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:56.040
actually make sense to me and no slag on virgins but they made my character a

01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:01.200
virgin and I was like but why what is what like why what's the point what's

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:06.120
your point any who they did it and then they decided that she would lose her

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:12.640
virginity to Herman and so she did that thus thus justifying the changing the

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:18.640
meaning of the title entirely you know there was a porn video that came out

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:25.080
called Herman's other head oh my god yeah there was a community porno no

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:31.400
wait the community porno I was so disappointed with initially because it

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:37.160
was like unreleased and he came around but that's when I realized it was like

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:42.280
of course the community porno should be this like like disaster it's it's

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:46.480
perfect this way it's like these guys are misfits at a community college it's

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:51.520
good that Abbot's being played by that guy

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:58.520
anyways but but well maybe to backtrack just for a second I because I am

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:07.120
curious because what was all the the the respect that you are paid by the people

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:11.600
that have worked with you it does include the idea that when you're doing

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:16.680
Lisa which you've done for multiple decades now that there's a there might

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:22.680
be a little bit of curation there which you know guys like me might bristle at

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:29.520
the idea of like what the actor got a script and looked at it and said no she

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:33.560
wouldn't say that like how often does that really happen it doesn't happen

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:39.560
very often they but I will say when when on the very rare occasion that the

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:44.160
writers they are there write something that I don't think Lisa Simpson would

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:49.480
say or they write they write somebody being really mean to Lisa and she

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:55.920
doesn't have a response to that then I will always fight that fight I have to

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:59.800
stick up for my girl and I might not win it but I have to fight it

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:09.080
it's a and it's important to I think it's important for it's like in those

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:15.880
moments what phraseology would you use because I don't think she would say

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:24.040
that you strike a balance between like I think that this is kind of a cultural

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:29.720
hot button like in the workplace to be like I think things should be different

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:35.200
around here some of the most conscientious people might be terrified of

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:39.560
making too many waves like if I'm if I'm a cool person then I'm not gonna be one

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:45.080
of those people etc etc like I think it's a it's an ongoing thing of like is

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:50.160
there a certain parlance especially with actors like is there a is there a

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:56.600
magical way to present your your difference of opinion with the material

01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:01.320
you're reading and you're about to shoot that in a world where actors other

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:05.360
actors younger actors might say are you fucking kidding me yeah you can be as

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:08.040
conscientious as you want but it's fucking either be eaten out here I'm

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:12.560
gonna do whatever or even more extreme like I'm not taking that job because

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:18.120
from the get-go it's these things like do you have any advice about that for

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:25.880
like when you're you're adjusting to a role that you're already cast in I well

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:31.200
it's a dumb question it's a stupid question it's not a stupid question you

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:38.000
know I I always so it's a smart question so I'm like a good interviewer I'm not

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.440
maybe I'm not sure I understand the question I guess I'm kind of like I it's

01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:45.000
it's it's actually a sequel to a question that I've asked Kumail Kumail

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.480
Nanjiani who's an old friend of the podcast that all these people miss fuck

01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:59.440
off he's a person of color for instance like like it's like they're in this day

01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:03.840
and age where it's like we're beyond the point of like the Hollywood shuffle

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:08.080
concept of like well you got to do what you got to do it's it's it's it's

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:13.280
everyone's trying to find their way and I'm all I'm endlessly curious about how

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:16.960
these dialogues are supposed to get struck up in a creative environment

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:21.120
where there's such a hierarchy established a hierarchy which I frankly

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:27.400
I'm not I'm not in a hurry to let go not because I'm an egomaniac but because I'm

01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:32.080
a chaos a phobe and I don't necessarily want to just be like here's the

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:37.600
suggestion box let's have everybody start having an open dialogue and it like

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:43.920
I'm just curious on the on the actor side like if there's a if there's a kind

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:48.520
of code for an actor who's like 25 years old and they're on the set of their

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:51.800
fucking thing and they're like god damn it just get through this and don't get

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:55.360
fired but then they see something and let's say that they were like I don't

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:59.320
think either this character would say this or maybe in a larger sense this is

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:05.320
a little fucking iffy sketchy well I have a couple of things I mean always I

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:12.000
feel like you get more you get further with honey than with vinegar obviously

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:17.240
and so if you have the ability to be tactful that will always serve you I

01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:22.840
don't think that you have to be I don't I don't think you have to pussy foot

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:28.600
around your point so much that you can't get your point across two things like if

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:36.160
you're an actor who is struggling with a line I always feel like I'm the sort of

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:41.520
person who will always give you a hundred percent so if I'm at this point if

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:46.600
I'm having trouble with a line then I'm like really trouble with a line like I

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:54.600
can't remember it then I'm gonna say it's possible that the line doesn't

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:59.600
actually make sense like there is a problem with the logic of the line so

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:04.360
are you willing and hopefully the person on the other side the director if

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:07.520
that's who the person that you're speaking to or the writer if that person

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:12.360
is also present is willing to have the conversation with you to say can you

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:16.280
tell me what's the overall intent of what we're trying to get across here

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:21.240
because maybe what you wrote is it actually what you mean and if we can

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:26.240
actually get to that then I bet you I can remember that line and that motherfucker

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:30.400
comes out so well everybody's happy that's what I think so yeah I mean like

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:36.480
it's yeah but find a positive way to say it which is like I want to help your

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:41.120
show be good I mean we're all on the same side we want the same win right and in

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:47.160
terms of Lisa Simpson if there is a line that really really bumps for me you

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:54.840
know I that's always pretty easy but but I I never I'm not I don't have no desire

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:59.200
to excoriate you and say this is the stupidest fucking thing I've ever seen

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:03.440
even if that's what I feel inside you nor would you I'm getting the

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:07.440
implication like because you said look at the end of the day I'm gonna do it like

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:12.760
you wouldn't probably wouldn't do a standoff which is all the more the fact

01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:16.600
that a good actor just a good writer writes what they're hired to write a

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:20.520
good actor act what they're hired to act so we have this kind of Jedi code of

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:25.720
like I'm not gonna be a bad craftsman but then there's this like holy like

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:30.160
thing that should unite all of us where like if you in the commission of

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:34.320
writing this amazing thing and you wanting the best actor that like like we

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:38.800
could like connect and you could go look at the end of the day I'll say this

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:46.840
shitty-ass line I'm about to do it before I do you want to make it better I

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:52.280
mean that's the point did you have an energy about I think Humphrey Bogart I

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:57.440
think said like when you look at a line and a page that is just impossible to

01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:01.360
say with a straight face like it's just such a bad line and you fought your

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:04.160
fight but this is just how it's gonna be because the director is so big or the

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:09.640
writer whatever and his thing was if a line is impossible to deliver well just

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:14.720
say it out loud don't give it don't give it anything just say it and it often

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:19.360
turns out to be great it can sometimes be a very memorable line he just says it

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:25.480
out loud that's how like half of the people yeah it's like okay like like

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:30.600
guess what you're charming and then they go god damn it I was trying to torpedo

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:38.400
that role I became Judge Reinhold the alright so like let now let's go to like

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:42.760
because I think we can so this incredible thing happens to you but in

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:47.360
tandem you're you're because you were doing Herman's head Simpsons is going on

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:53.880
yes so I'm not sure what the best organic way to get into there's there's two

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:58.320
places to go here they're both related I mean you're here because I'm a huge true

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:07.000
crime fan my fiancee and I listened to you and this like it's truly worth like

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:13.000
accolades I mean of all due respect to all of our guests that have true crime

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.960
podcasts and things I mean this is truly like a gourmet true crime experience

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:23.560
the so there's that but it's entwined with the fact that one of the most

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:28.240
impressive things about it is that in the midst of this getting down to the

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:31.720
nitty-gritty in this true crime show that you do so well that you're a

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:38.200
producer on not in your face way but just eventually you just you share your

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:50.040
story as a victim and so does Libby Zibi Zibi she's now twice a victim just

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:58.440
forgot her name we'll edit it the the it their harrowing tales it's insane it's

01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:04.080
not a it so I don't know where to go because I want to talk about the nuts

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:08.320
and bolts of your podcast because I think it's so admirable and it's so

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:13.480
disconnected from this other thing that I'm really fascinated with you as a

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:23.080
human being an actor who has experienced crime I don't know what I'm

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:28.360
wiping it on you my indecision because I don't know I if we go down the true

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:33.040
crime podcast path I'm gonna have endless questions about how you produce

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:38.680
that show and stuff I just also want to talk to you about this this story that

01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:42.560
you told and I don't want you to recount it because I truly believe I mean it

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:47.680
was but like people need to go listen to small-town dicks what's the episode

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:55.360
title stalked stalked where I mean you believe me regardless of whatever your

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:59.960
position in this cosmos might be it's a fascinating story there's no way it's

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:05.960
going to piss you off offend you trigger you it is just harrowing and

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:09.480
interesting I think the most interesting thing about it from my perspective

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:20.880
that is as a narcissist how you ended up in this situation where this person was

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:24.840
a guy who worked on our house and was like and he just started crossing

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:31.680
boundaries it was very quote-unquote organic and as I described on this

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:36.680
podcast before like there's a point where you describing the story and there's

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:40.760
this theme running under it which is the which has come up here in this

01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:46.120
conversation which is about you you you've you've got to not accept anybody's

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:52.240
help you're not gonna go tell anybody right the police the guy that works on

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.320
Herman's head whose job is to keep people who work on Herman's head from

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:59.480
getting stalked right which is a huge expense shout out to the producers of

01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:03.040
Herman's head for putting them the budget right I thought that would get a

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:10.360
bigger laugh but a lot of showrunners in the audience but the like like a you

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:15.520
choke up not at any point where I would expect any human being to choke up and

01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:18.880
telling that story the exact point that you choke up when you're telling the

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:26.360
story is the point in the story where you go to get help because you are not to

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:31.640
put words in your mouth that's the point where you really get victimized it's not

01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:40.360
the point where this orangutan is abusing you stalking you predating you

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:50.040
it's the point where you go to another orangutan and say I need you to keep

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:57.560
this guy like you hate yourself at that point I want the thing that is the most

01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:02.880
important to talk about to me is that that's the dark side of this other

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:07.760
story that you're this plucky but I'm gonna dominate the world without

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:14.200
anyone's help right right because there is you know part of again that duality

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:20.840
that that insecurity underlying that this far from the surface is is this is

01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:29.560
this fathoms deep well of vulnerability and this is what they're waiting for this

01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:36.000
is six-year-old voice she's gonna is that like was that what's going on in the

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.200
back there oh everyone's gonna be so fucking stoked if I say oh it's it's

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:46.600
rough out here my contractor like feels creepy I'm sorry I'm okay I'm way off

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:51.520
mark like I was trying to I was like is the fear there that like you're like I

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:58.680
just was I you know in my family we don't you don't you know you don't air

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:03.680
your dirty laundry I was rubber a really waspy right white Anglo-Saxon

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:08.200
Protestant so you pull up your socks and you get on with it you just sort of

01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:14.520
keep it all together and so you don't show your vulnerability and I and I am a

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:19.840
person of extremes I think in many ways and so when I set the bar high I said

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:23.480
it's so high that it's not like I said it high and I can stand on my toes and

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:28.160
touch it I gotta like get on a fucking trampoline and jump so high like whoa you

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:34.480
know it's just almost out of reach but when I touch it that is it's not even as

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:40.680
much an accomplishment it's there's just a sort of this tiny bit of relief which

01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:45.280
is kind of fucked up there's very little celebration when you live with that

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:51.120
kind of vulnerability and you attach your and I don't do it so much anymore

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:57.200
thank God because it's a zero-sum game but when you attach your value to what

01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:04.520
you do and to that external validation you're in big big trouble and so if you

01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:08.840
then find yourself in a situation like that now you've painted yourself into a

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:14.520
corner and so when I break down in that episode there is realization that I

01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:20.280
can't do it all myself that feels like extraordinary failure because now I have

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:24.320
to unzip and you get to see all my insides yeah and that was never the plan

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:30.920
and but and I tell me to back off because I'm clumsy and drunk but like I

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:36.920
want I'm so fascinated by the control hatch on that interaction at that moment

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:42.400
when you you're going to the to the man that said to you I'm paid for you to

01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:46.840
tell me if anyone gets out of line and then you're it's the moment where you're

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:54.240
going to him and like I'm kind I just I'm I want to know like what is the beating

01:20:54.240 --> 01:21:00.880
heart behind the the shame like like the idea that moment when you you go to him

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:07.800
and you say I got a I got an issue here and I need help like is there is there

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:12.760
language you can access about like so that we can mark it and go like if I

01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:18.360
hear this in my head that's not worth dying for like like that where you were

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:22.920
what I got let me try to phrase this in a way that you can answer I'm setting you

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:30.000
up to fail the like what's what was your in your primal crazy head not you're not

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:37.200
crazy I mean you're I'm the crazy part of your prime what would be the worst if

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:45.120
no matter how not realistic what would be the nightmare response when you went

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:51.520
to someone and said I've been having this guy is basically stalking me it's

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:55.400
gotten way out of control and I'm overwhelmed and I need help what would

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:59.000
be the nightmare response from the other person it sort of was the nightmare

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.480
response when he said Yardley why didn't you tell me when he showed up at your

01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:08.120
house and said my wife threw me out of the house right right like why didn't

01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:14.960
you tell me weeks ago why didn't you as though you knew long ago why did you

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:18.800
wait so long it's very familiar to the kids you know you're it's sort of your

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:23.480
fault right you got yourself into this why didn't you know why were you

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:30.680
drinking exactly like you you you waited too long it's no surprise that you find

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:35.960
yourself in this situation and and you can't handle it on your own like all

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:39.720
the things that when you get to that point and you have to ask for help but

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:43.760
you realize okay I can't handle it on my own yes I probably waited too long no I

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:48.480
can't do it all myself yes it's okay to ask for help all of the things that in

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:52.520
my life I had just learned I'm never gonna hope I never have to go to those

01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:57.720
things I hope I never have to tick those boxes and then I did and when you say it

01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:01.400
out loud it's really no big deal by the way now I'm doing it again because I'm

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:06.400
like tell me just tell me about the point I'm like it but that that I get

01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:13.880
that now like I it's like god damn it I was almost fucking home like how much

01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:17.640
do I have to do to prove I'm strong and then and then it's like somebody's like

01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:22.080
no I'm gonna fucking literally I'm gonna build a spider web in your attic and

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:26.040
like and you're like are you serious I have to like call customer service on

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:33.880
this I bought I went Linux for a reason I'm a fucking I it that's what I I don't

01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:38.400
want to say that's what I thought I it's not so complicated you know but in

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:44.840
your in your head I think or if you're the sort of person who who spends a lot

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:51.000
of energy trying to make sure that nobody sees your vulnerability then the

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:56.800
moment that there is a crack in that facade it feels catastrophic and that I

01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:02.880
think and it's it's not true because one thing is true about me then what if

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:07.440
everything is right everything could be untrue about me and so it's it's I don't

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:12.280
think anybody else feels that way about my vulnerability but in that moment you

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:17.080
it does feel like this massive failure because all your life you've been told

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:20.560
like don't ever let anybody see that well your friend you're really good

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:23.480
friend I assume she's a really good friend your co-host in the podcast with

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:30.760
her I think in general you guys are so good at interviewing she is like piping

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:34.680
in just the right amount she's probably heard the story a thousand times and

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:40.880
she's sort of like yeah but stop here for a second Yardley because she knows

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:47.600
people listening to the story want you to explain right just for a second are

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:52.400
you seriously putting up with this at this point and it's a it is a it's a

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:56.360
truly therapeutic exercise you guys please listen to the episode it's

01:24:56.360 --> 01:25:02.040
incredible I is that the first episode is that no God no because they would never

01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:07.320
trade in that it's no I think it's in the second season okay somewhere buried

01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:12.520
in the middle there she also so at some point during this true crime podcast

01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:15.480
this thing that's happened to you which which were kind of vaguely referring to

01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:19.440
that began to happen or is it something that happened no long ago happened in

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:25.000
the early 90s so at some point in second season of your small-town dicks you

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.840
just just you started talking about that on the show we actually all of our

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:34.640
cases are told by the detectives who investigated them oh well except for two

01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:40.000
episodes one incident that happened to Zibi where she was mugged and then that

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.880
was in season one and we did it because the detectives Dan and Dave we have two

01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:49.600
identical twin detectives on the show who co-host with us talked about this

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:56.800
thing they call the goofy loop where you like a yeah so a cop will be like on a

01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:01.120
traffic stop and be like get out of the car get out of the car get out and you're

01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:04.160
already out of the car and they just keep telling you get out of the car get

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:08.240
out of the car and they're just sort of like so wound up and that's called the

01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:13.840
goofy loop and so Zibi was then we were at lunch and she was talking about this

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:18.800
thing that happened to her and they're like you were in the goofy loop so we

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:22.960
did this episode where is the only one that wasn't actually told by detective

01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:27.360
obviously and then so the next time in the second season and a season doesn't

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:31.880
actually correspond to a calendar year we just were actually only two years old

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:37.960
but we do about two seasons a year in the second season we did this episode

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:42.960
where I was stalked by this guy who'd worked on my house yeah and you had

01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:48.240
another story before that too of a guy was leaving yes yes on my front door I

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:53.240
mean it's it's it's it reminds me of the story it was it Rebecca Schaefer yes

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:56.880
which is right around the same time you were I actually auditioned for that part

01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:04.800
I went to the network for that role you kids yeah it's like there was this

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:12.240
young actress who she her murder kind of changed the landscape of stalking

01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:18.360
rules here in our great state of California like where it was like all

01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:24.640
right enough is enough this woman was absolutely stalked and murdered in like

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:29.360
plain sight like this guy just decided he wanted to kill her and there was no

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:34.880
way there were it changed it changed a lot of stuff and it's a it's a really

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:42.080
tragic story and it was happening at the exact same time when I'm just

01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:46.280
morbidly curious was it happening at the exact same time in the in-sense they

01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:54.120
were you had Rebecca been killed when you were enduring some when did she my

01:27:54.120 --> 01:28:01.320
thing happened I think hers happened after mine because mine happened in like

01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:09.880
93 or it happened around the same time roughly I'm so bad with dates I'm sorry

01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:18.840
I don't know I measure things by Emmys after my third Emmy at 9-11 9-11 I

01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:25.240
that's before 9-11 those after 9-11 so like my 37th birthday was halfway

01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:34.200
between 9-11 and my second Emmy Dan you're not relatable I don't care I don't

01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:42.000
need to be relatable I'm a living God I may also be super drunk so let's get

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.800
into the true crime of it I really think because it's like I guys I hear the

01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:52.360
audience are like I hate true crime I hate your crime go ahead a lot of it

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:56.680
well they're just saying that because they love you and that's one of the

01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:01.440
things like you you and your partner have like created the show so here's the

01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:06.200
here's the reason why this is an amazing show so true crime what you might be

01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:11.440
used to and I think this is a great art form is total amateurs in an arm chair

01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:15.000
hanging out going like hey well here's what I think about JonBenét Ramsey

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:23.200
that's fucking great and I live by it but you are also a fan of that art form

01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:30.560
but you inexplicably have created a truly responsible and professional show

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:34.560
that I would truly recommend to anybody I would I wouldn't bother to preface it

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:40.160
by going do you love true crime because I'd be like you must love film noir or

01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:44.960
you must love like just the idea of anything I mean I think it's the only

01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:48.760
true crime show I've ever heard that I think cops could listen to next to

01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:56.160
victims for instance we get a lot of messages emails reviews from cops saying

01:29:56.160 --> 01:30:01.200
this is amazing thanks so much thanks for telling it from our point of view so

01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:04.960
like I said all of our cases are told by the detectives who investigated them

01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:10.360
and it started because I'm friends with Dan and Dave these identical twin

01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:16.920
detectives and they are one investigated violent crimes and one

01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:23.280
investigated sex crimes and child abuse and to just hear them talk about their

01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:32.640
day was the most harrowing extraordinary mind-blowing like Tuesday is so much

01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:38.040
more incredible than my any ever day like I imagine being interrogated in

01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:44.640
stereo by twin detectives the first questions you asked them like to have

01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:48.960
you guys ever done a dead ringer they actually have what's funny is when

01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:55.040
because they live obviously in the same town so they have had criminals say fuck

01:30:55.040 --> 01:31:02.520
you to one of them and like you don't mean you know you mean my brother me as

01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:07.080
a criminal how do I know which is the good cop which is the better right these

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:12.600
guys though it is remarkable and also all of your guests but most like like these

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:20.080
two guys these anonymous detectives they it to put it in D&D terms these guys are

01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:32.040
like I try I try to their paladins the paladin class is like it's not the one

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:36.160
everyone chooses I don't want to ride around in a suit of armor on a white

01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:41.680
horse and like go and it already sounds like I'm trivializing it because the

01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:47.720
more important thing is in the sort of dragnet archetypal sense god it's so

01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:53.840
it I'm all over the place here's where I'm gonna start with this as an American

01:31:53.840 --> 01:32:00.120
citizen I think my worst fear about cops including homicide detectives was

01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:04.600
realized by Mark Furman like even from Wisconsin it was sort of like didn't we

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:10.640
all think that that's how it worked that and worse than thinking that this is

01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:14.720
what detectives are it's actually more about this is what we think of the world

01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:20.880
because we would assume I don't want to do that job and so if this guy does that

01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:27.200
job and he's racist then maybe that job makes you racist and it toxifies

01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:33.720
everything and and it's so different and from from to hear these guys who are

01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:37.120
like I have no idea what they look like they're anonymous you guys keep their

01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:45.160
identity secret which is adds to the charm they're there they you can't be

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:49.280
that by the book and that can did they they sit there with you guys and they

01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:57.320
interview other detectives couldn't I just Google identical detectives

01:32:57.320 --> 01:33:02.560
you could but we actually say in our opening while some of our listeners may

01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:06.360
recognize some of these cases we hope that you'll join us in keeping their

01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:11.920
identities secret to protect the victims and what they've been through and so are

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:15.680
all the cases that cases that these two have worked on themselves so they're

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:21.800
just giving their insight on cases that that no what sorry so we do cases that

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:27.000
Dan and Dave have investigated we also have guests from other small towns who

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.720
come and tell us cases that they have investigated and Dan and Dave because

01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:36.640
they are they are of the brotherhood are there to comment and sort of weigh in as

01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:42.840
well gotcha what's incredible is the is I mean you guys are so restrained but

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:45.320
then it's like it's like listening over the seasons you guys like learned

01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:49.600
phrases and then yes two seasons later you're like wouldn't that be a quibble

01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:55.120
dibbley that's a very good point but in this case in our district you're not

01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:59.880
allowed to do a quibbley-dibbley okay fine just checking but it's more

01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:04.280
importantly like it's Dan and Dave who are like it's like you could never get

01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:11.040
cops to host a podcast right it would be a terrible podcast because they'd be

01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:17.400
like hey I'm Dan I'm Dave we're hanging out I don't know I'm sure it'd be great

01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:23.040
but you know what's interesting so originally the concept of the podcast

01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:27.600
was Dan and Dave would just talk to each other over a glass of scotch which

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:34.240
would be fine and it wasn't fine because they were they first of all

01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:37.160
sometimes you put a microphone in front of somebody and they sort of freeze up

01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:42.160
and they don't know quite what to do and suddenly with scotch it got all a bit

01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:46.600
slurry in about you know 40 minutes so that wasn't a podcast I won't tolerate

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:52.840
that and so that is a podcast killer yeah where's the professionalism so

01:34:52.840 --> 01:35:01.960
anyways give me one second I have to go solve the crime of Jeff has to pee I

01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:07.720
already know who done it and it it's me and it was in the master bedroom of my

01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:15.760
pants continue please I'm sorry so then they said we need you and Zibi to ask us

01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:21.680
questions wait wait sorry sorry sorry they they tried it by themselves yes well

01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:26.840
we were there no we were all there Zibi and I because we we were like okay we'll

01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:31.840
produce it and you guys you should have a podcast we should not be talking

01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:35.080
correct because I'm the voice of Lisa Simpson it'll only fuck things up yes

01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:40.080
and and then they like press record and they're like okay so yes what about that

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:46.280
perp yes and you guys are like okay how do I put anyway they were actually the

01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:50.000
ones who were like this doesn't work of course because they're paladins they're

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:55.000
good guys they're wonderful guys they're great guys and I will say and to your

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.560
point about Mark Furman you know one of the things that I love about our

01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:03.560
podcast and it's been a sort of unexpected treasure about it is that

01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:08.360
while there is certainly a really worthy conversation about the really about

01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:13.400
the horrible things happening in law enforcement in this country I would say

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:17.680
99% of them are actually trying to do their very best and if we have an

01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:22.200
opportunity to shine a light on those people as well that's also part of the

01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:28.000
conversation and these guys all say and the women that it's a calling it's not a

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:36.200
job and so you know I really they really really really are going the distance to

01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:41.000
do it right and do it well and we have cases about we have a really fantastic

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.520
four-part series called the sociopath and the whistleblower about a bad cop who

01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:52.200
was a bad cop for 10 years that's fucking credible rocked this town is Dan or

01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:58.360
Dave isn't there the protagonist of that or no no that's a guy named Lieutenant

01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:02.640
Scott who investigated that we did we have a great have you listen to the

01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:07.160
interview so we have a another great two-part case called presumed guilty and

01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:13.960
then that's in season two about two guys who were sent to prison for a crime they

01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:19.200
ended up not committing and then we did an interview with one of those guys who

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:24.960
had been in prison for eight years this season but not on the phone right no he's

01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:30.760
he said he's sitting with us thank God I mean I know people's lives are important

01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:35.880
yeah the audio quality I know I know I feel God with the true crime with the

01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:50.840
it's high so what you like to be the mother of Jeffrey timers 12th victim I

01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:55.600
love it in the booth Zach is adjusting you right now like well maybe if you're

01:37:55.600 --> 01:38:00.760
nice to the sound engineers you get better sound mother fucker it is such a

01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:05.680
profound thing though to hear these guys and they all strike a similar silhouette

01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:09.040
but they're some of them are so different there's like the guy who's like well I'm

01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:13.320
the guy that shows up when there's an arson but also I like more about skin

01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:18.600
burns but some of them are crass some of them are polite some of them are afraid

01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:25.000
to be profane some of them are what what really comes across is that if any of

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:30.120
these guys in spite of how kind of maybe stoic the job demands that their

01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:37.080
personalities be I am socially conditioned to believe that if a barrel

01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:42.960
chested as I picture all of them a man with a notepad and a gun on his hip

01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:46.560
that he's allowed to kill anyone he wants with that when that guy's being

01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:53.320
stoic that he's hiding the fact that he's racist homophobic misogynistic that

01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:58.560
he wishes that the filth in the street could blah blah blah it be rained out

01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:05.160
and it it is so therapeutic to listen to just the simple dragnet reality these

01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:09.680
guys often refer to dragnet moments because what they do is so clerical

01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:16.160
they they move from address to address and they keep careful notes and their I

01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:20.120
love the rule of law being the protagonist in these stories yes they're

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:25.600
very methodical and we actually always also try to get into the like who are

01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:32.160
you as a person why do you do what you do and then how do you if you are the

01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:36.280
person who goes toward all of the stuff that the rest of us run from where does

01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:44.320
that live inside of you yeah always always ask because you're how do you do

01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:48.640
it it's it's debugging I think I got from this guy that we call Asperger

01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:52.000
detective on this show because he has a true crime podcast it's just him and a

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:57.480
microphone and his crazy brain like doing an awesome job of talking about

01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:04.520
famous murder cases but he he really woke me up to like the healthy reason why

01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:08.880
I think that maybe true crime is a fascination which is sort of a debugging

01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:15.200
of of our experiment with being a society like because you've got a you've

01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:19.480
got a couple different leads coming in you've got the cops that are showing up

01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:23.120
you've got the victims that are showing up you've got the perpetrators that are

01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:27.120
showing up and you're looking at it with your little ghostbusters lens and going

01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:32.160
okay did which of these things went wrong and we tend to get drawn to the

01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:36.880
famous things okay so let's all talk about JonBenét Ramsey for a million

01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:42.160
years because it's endlessly fascinating but your podcast is like there are a

01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:46.320
million small towns in America all of them have big crimes constantly

01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:50.720
happening in them and then all of them have a homicide detective who shows up

01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:57.120
who is like this is like and you guys do a really good job you're good

01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:04.600
interviewers I wish you were doing this podcast like it just like it takes the

01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:08.480
effect of like this VR experience because these guys they're they're like

01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:12.120
you're like so what happened first they're like okay so I got a call from

01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:17.960
third and Lincoln and I saw the door a minute first thing I noticed doors got

01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:23.400
water damage and it just goes from there so I mean I can't if you don't like it

01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:29.840
you're a piece of shit even if even if you hate crime or love it I don't know

01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:34.560
what kind it really is a good podcast thank you how did you produce it are you

01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:39.360
part of a network I'm not no actually we do it we're a tiny team

01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:43.920
Zibi and I edit on paper and then we pass it off to two editors who put it

01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:49.160
into Pro Tools it's an incredibly edit heavy podcast because we're not dealing

01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:53.680
with professional storytellers okay you guys aren't that amazing people like

01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:57.240
and they're that thoughtful because that would be too intimidating because I was

01:41:57.240 --> 01:42:01.200
gonna ask that what do you mean you guys are so he thought you were doing it in

01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:05.640
one take you're not editing your your questions are so thoughtful and you're

01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:09.720
never interrupting and being a big drunken idiot and you're just editing it all

01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:16.200
out we actually have now learned to the thing about interrupting what's

01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:21.040
interesting is we used to interrupt no we used to interrupt more let me stop

01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:26.640
you right there this isn't this is a pro interrupting show that's right go

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:33.520
ahead and Dan and Dave said to us they pulled us aside literally and said when

01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:37.120
these detectives are telling these stories it's often like they're

01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:42.400
testifying on the stand and it's much better just to let them go and if you

01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:46.720
have questions write them down and then come back to them afterward if there's a

01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:52.360
natural break you can ask the question but it's it's less good to sort of try

01:42:52.360 --> 01:43:03.720
to get one in it doesn't their brain it's just not like that I love hearing

01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:08.400
that for several reasons one is that I love the idea that the the men and

01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:12.320
women that we put in charge and nine binaries that you're welcome that we

01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:16.840
that we put in charge of that really specific tier of law enforcement where

01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:21.920
the crimes already happened now they got a the paper trail begins and they got to

01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:27.400
find the perp I think they're called perps I love I love I'm so much more

01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:32.800
comfortable with the idea of them being not natural performers I would really

01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:36.800
like them to have Asperger's I would really like them to be like no I'm more

01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:40.640
of a detail oriented they really are very detail aren't they're very organized

01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:48.880
that way and they so yes to your point we're very edit heavy they you know we

01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:54.680
it's just there's repetition you we my here's my thing the most important

01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:59.080
minute is the next minute and so you don't want your audience to turn away

01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:03.480
you don't want them to turn you off and go and do something else and so I really

01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:09.080
have tremendous respect for our listeners and I want my podcast podcast to

01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:14.480
be clean I mean if you don't listen to it now you're a piece of shit she just

01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:18.840
said the most important minute is the next minute that means every minute

01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:23.760
more important than the next fuck you people you don't get it I hope you

01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:28.960
don't listen to it because it sounds like it'll make you better and you

01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:35.280
deserve to be worse thanks for coming here I'm so sorry about the audience

01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:41.200
there I think they're drunk frankly beefing with about people that don't

01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:46.360
like people getting I don't know the ghost of my dad who isn't even dead

01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:52.480
that's how drunk I am but you're just you're just imagining that people are

01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:56.760
mad at you for loving crime called shame I I was just talking around functions

01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:01.400
about this on his better podcast today because he was doing a better job of

01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:06.800
interviewing me no no compare and despair don't do it compare and despair

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:11.000
yeah god damn it Brandon how are you doing I'm trying to tell you she she

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:18.200
dropped it you know you should listen how do we oh we should ask about

01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:23.880
activist was one of the ways that you just I guess I do want to know yeah but

01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:31.800
can I ask one quick yeah I'm being shrumped

01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:39.320
tis an honor what's the coolest thing that your job has allowed you to be able

01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:48.920
to do the the coolest thing that my job is has allowed me to do it has given me

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:55.000
freedom of choice and I really and I said that it's and now actually I I used

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:58.440
to always say that and I said that to Matt Salman who's one of our executive

01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:03.400
producer writers the other day I know Matt and he's so funny and shut the fuck

01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:15.480
up I was a Simpson and he said oh so you mean you have money and I'm like yes

01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:21.240
money is a part of it but it is so much bigger than that and then so here's the

01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:29.880
story about freedom of choice three years ago I broke my neck terrible choice

01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:36.680
just be quiet for a second sorry I'm so sorry I'm so sorry it was funny though it

01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:41.360
was funny it was funny it was funny not worth interrupting but it was funny

01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:48.880
technically so it was a really really really bad break and I came within a

01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:53.240
millimeter of being paralyzed from the neck down we can ask how it happened I

01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:59.000
fell down a flight of stairs in a parking garage and I separated C5 and C6 and

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.600
stretched my spinal cord to within a millimeter of snapping so that would have

01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:09.000
meant paralysis for probably my friend oh yes or death or death so we're a

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:16.160
superhero damn origin damn I'm trying to put a point okay okay okay it'll be

01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:24.720
short all right so I want the show to be good so it took me a full year to

01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:30.680
recover now I'm lucky cuz I have good health insurance but what I really had

01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:40.080
was time and I had time because I have this amazing job and what I realized is

01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:51.240
that even the thing that nobody has the thing that nobody it was time that I

01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:56.040
could go to physical therapy five days a week and it wasn't about the money it

01:47:56.040 --> 01:48:01.400
was that I could go because I didn't have to be anywhere else and so that is

01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:06.800
about the freedom of choice and what I oh the other thing I always say is you

01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:11.160
know if I have this extraordinary opportunity that this job has given me if

01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:14.960
I don't have the wherewithal to do something with that then that's on me

01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:22.360
then I'm the asshole so right that's the best thing yeah the idea of waking up

01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:26.320
in the morning and knowing that the reason you're getting out of bed has is

01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:31.280
somehow intersecting with you wanting to yes instead of having that fallback that

01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:35.240
we're all too familiar with which is like well I got a quit smoking well I'm

01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:39.760
a smoker but I got a quit smoking and you like fall into that trap of like okay

01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:43.800
so I'm living in two totally different realities like I'm getting out of bed

01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:47.480
because my alarm clock rung and I'm a dishwasher so I'm gonna go wash dishes

01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:53.040
it's not it's absolutely not what I want to do that's how 99% of us live and we

01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:57.480
call that work and we call that paying the rent and stuff and so that's 1% of

01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:02.200
us have this privilege it's an enormous privilege to if you're gonna spend so

01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:06.760
much of your time at work then hopefully it's something that you enjoy

01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:10.920
because and hopefully you'd be able to like come down from that Mount Sinai and

01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:15.720
be like hey everybody that had to wash dishes otherwise they'd lose their house

01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:22.920
right I'm I'm I I get to jump out of bed in the morning knowing that I'm stoked

01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:26.040
about what I do and I just want to let you know it's not that great it also

01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:34.240
sucks fuck off and that would still be an uplifting message okay I didn't guys

01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:39.920
didn't receive that I mean it doesn't have to be like oh I'm staying I love

01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:47.360
doing what I love like I think it can be really simple you know what I I got a

01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:52.000
million dollars for taking a shit on a paper plate I feel bad about myself I

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:59.120
think that can be really uplifting for poor people and then that second

01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:06.600
question was about activism let's move on to that yeah what is what's the LGBTQ

01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:11.480
activist stuff that you well Jeff it's it's part of the gay thing oh sorry you're

01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:18.040
asking her okay my answer was gonna be stupid for a really long time I so when

01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:26.600
California voted against gay marriage I was I had just actually produced a movie

01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:32.560
that Dustin Lance Black had directed called Virginia that Jennifer Connelly

01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:39.120
and Ed Harris had starred in and he introduced me to Chad Griffin who at the

01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:45.400
time had just teamed up with Rob Reiner and they started the American

01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:49.480
Foundation for Equal Rights to overturn Proposition 8 and they came to me and

01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:55.840
said yardly we need to fight this fight and we need money and I said I'm in so

01:50:55.840 --> 01:51:04.520
that was most sort of my first really really big push and I was one of the

01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:11.000
major donors for that and then Chad got poached from once we did that the

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:17.560
American Foundation for Equal Rights went away and Chad got poached to the

01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:23.120
human rights campaign and then I sort of followed him there and supported them

01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:28.840
there and I actually was just honored there this last spring at their gala as

01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:36.200
got the National Leadership Award for supporting the LGBTQ community wow now

01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:41.320
there's something that there's another one of them I'm sure your hundred answers

01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:46.400
for what your job is afforded you to be able to do is to become like a donor to

01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:50.920
these things and a philanthropist yes you know I'm a quiet donor I actually I

01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:56.360
don't I rarely I'm not a flashy donor I give quite generously but I never need

01:51:56.360 --> 01:52:02.080
to be I don't never need my name and lights about that it's and it's funny

01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:06.760
so when I had to give this speech about being recognized by the human rights

01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:12.080
campaign I was I got a big laugh when I said so I've been agonizing for months

01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:18.320
about how to thank you for thanking me properly for doing this I'm like thanks

01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:23.440
because now I've not slept since Christmas I mean it was really I mean I

01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:28.680
was incredibly gratified but I also felt like I really don't I don't need you to

01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:33.800
I don't need it I'm good like they personally are always so gracious towards

01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:38.480
me but they really really really wanted to do it publicly and so I recognized

01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:46.240
that part of being gracious is allowing people to say thank you and so

01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:48.480
they should give you that they should be like obviously they're not gonna just

01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:52.080
never thank you and never want to honor you but they should have a like they

01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:55.040
should come to you and say hey we're they're gonna throw you this big event

01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:59.680
where you get to get up and agonize over a speech or we'll just you get to know

01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:04.640
that we want to do that for you and you can flip that coin and go whichever way

01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:11.440
you wish but they were not giving me that option I think it's important

01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:16.920
actually whether you like it or not that they're the strategic benefit of

01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:22.000
because someone like me who would do it for the wrong reasons is like hey I want

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.000
I want that I think it's important I think you would donate to these great

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:30.560
causes just I would have a little great causes for very wrong reasons no but I

01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:37.360
I do think that I that that idea of deflecting compliments being like I

01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:42.200
think that like if somebody's saying thank you and then how you react to that

01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:48.720
it's like like your instinct being to be like almost like fuck you it's right

01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:54.920
because you're because if if you did something nice for any other reason than

01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:59.560
to be nice then that person that's actually thanking you is arguably an

01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:05.800
enemy in your in your pineal gland you're like and then like I had to I had a

01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:10.080
therapist had to explain to me like no it's part of it you have to telling you

01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:15.280
that that they're happy that you and you part of it is you have to receive it so

01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:21.560
get over it and receive it it's part of the deal I'm gonna help you are you good

01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:28.160
like in a smaller way are you good are you good are you comfortable with small

01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:32.760
like small compliments in general like I do do you accept them easily or is it

01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:36.440
difficult to even accept little compliments let's test it let's test it

01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:44.920
don't even answer what shut up Jeff you're a piece of shit thank you okay

01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:53.640
he's pretty good I feel like I am whatever happens internally you know if

01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:59.520
I'm and it really can be sort of day-to-day if I if I like I was almost

01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:04.160
late today tonight because I couldn't get out of my closet because I changed

01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:08.160
clothes like five times you chose well this butterfly dress is rocking thank

01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:15.040
you and it's see she did it thank you we got it but you kind of took it you

01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:23.000
kind of bowed your head I did you did part of you think in your head fuck you

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:29.120
this butter did no did you have to translate it to the second language of no I

01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:35.240
don't think so I just but it's I'm you know I'm just sort of I'm a I'm a

01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:42.840
complicated little critter in there sometimes I recognize now I like it's

01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:49.560
compliments are fine I'm good with it I really am good I just honestly knew that

01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:57.760
I I just really didn't need that big big recognition I was really okay with Chad

01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:04.080
and Chris Sparen who runs the foundation under him they're always like I said so

01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:09.440
personally gracious I was like that is so enough for me I'm good but they were

01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:12.800
insistent so I there is specific turn of phrase and I'm not seeing this go blue

01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:16.400
like because it's like I think I like like like so is there something that

01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:22.440
someone can say like there's something that performers people that want

01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:28.160
attention like did you hear something from them that made that through that

01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:32.120
gear and you're like oh that's what I wanted to hear and I don't actually need

01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:36.920
to hear it from 250 million people on Twitter I actually need to hear from two

01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:42.800
people who are like running this charity drive that's a good question I don't know

01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:46.920
there's a that's a dumb question don't even do you have one Dan that you want

01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:50.600
to hear you know I think it's like it's fucking like you're a good person but

01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:54.040
it's like if someone said that to me I'd be like well you're a liar and you're a

01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:58.120
piece of shit never trust you I'm gonna hit you in the head I you know it's

01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:03.000
funny I often joke that I I'm I work for biscuits and I'm sort of like a dog I

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:09.520
respond to biscuits so I do like to know that I did a good job I like that I

01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:13.840
really do I work very hard I like to know that I set the bar high I touch the

01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:18.360
bar and that you recognize that I'm glad you were here that's my thing thank you

01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:23.120
oh no no no that's what I want to hear I'm saying it to you too I'm glad you

01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:29.080
were here thank you that's what it is I'm happy to be here it's kind of cocky
