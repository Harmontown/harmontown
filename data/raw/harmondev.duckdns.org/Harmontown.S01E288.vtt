{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:07.000\nI love you, that's why I'm here today.\n\n00:07.000 --> 00:10.000\nThe beautiful uptown Burbank.\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:11.000\nHarmontowns.\n\n00:11.000 --> 00:12.000\nSession.\n\n00:12.000 --> 00:13.000\nMay 28, 2018.\n\n00:13.000 --> 00:14.000\nIt doesn't have shingles.\n\n00:14.000 --> 00:15.000\nIt's still sweet.\n\n00:15.000 --> 00:16.000\nIt ain't come clean.\n\n00:16.000 --> 00:17.000\nAnd there's nothing love adjusts.\n\n00:17.000 --> 00:18.000\nAnd you'll tell me you say I don't feel so good.\n\n00:18.000 --> 00:19.000\nYou know you be like, oh, lie down.\n\n00:19.000 --> 00:20.000\nI'm from Snuggletown, USA.\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:21.000\nThe mayor.\n\n00:21.000 --> 00:35.000\nHarmontowns, and I'm a hip hop, a room to the mob.\n\n00:35.000 --> 00:41.000\nSo clean your mother's pussy until I hit the top of the engineering industry.\n\n00:41.000 --> 00:42.000\nI'm a custodian.\n\n00:42.000 --> 00:43.000\nDon't cause me misery.\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:44.000\nI started at the bottom.\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:48.000\nNow I'm going to the top because of the aforementioned mob.\n\n00:48.000 --> 00:53.000\nI'm going to fuck your mama and rap.\n\n00:53.000 --> 00:56.000\nAll right.\n\n00:56.000 --> 00:57.000\nYeah.\n\n00:57.000 --> 00:58.000\nIt's good.\n\n00:58.000 --> 00:59.000\nAll right.\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:00.000\nStop it.\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:02.000\nStop the goddamn music.\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:04.000\nIt's already got someone rapping on it.\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:06.000\nThat's Rob Tanchum, everybody.\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:11.000\nOur friend Rob with background vocals by our own church.\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:12.000\nWhoa.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:13.000\nYeah.\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:15.000\nWhen's that coming out, that album?\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:16.000\nSoon, right?\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:17.000\nChurch, you know?\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:18.000\nTonight.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:23.000\nGet it at Best Buy.\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:24.000\nThat's something to look forward to.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:25.000\nIt's good stuff.\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:29.000\nIt's about his own maniac, high anxieties, and weird catechesis.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:33.000\nAnd it's beautifully written and wonderfully done.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:35.000\nI watched you record a piece on it.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:36.000\nIt was very good.\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:37.000\nYeah.\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:38.000\nThat's fun.\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:39.000\nHe worked very hard on that.\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:40.000\nI guess you're not probably not.\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:44.000\nNo, you are supposed to tell people you worked hard on your rap album.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:46.000\nRappers work hard on their albums.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:47.000\nYeah.\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:49.000\nYeah, he worked very hard on it.\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:51.000\nHe took it very seriously.\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:54.000\nAnd I think it's very impressive.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:57.000\nHe had to kind of be talked into doing it because he's like,\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:00.000\nI don't want to do a white guy comedy rap album.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:02.000\nHe's right to have those anxieties.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:04.000\nBut the truth is, he's so good.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:06.000\nLike, I was like, just do it.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:09.000\nLike, yeah, you're right.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:11.000\nIt's objectively on paper.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:19.000\nIt's a corny concept, but so is jumping over a high pole at the Olympics.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:21.000\nIt's like, oh, I'm going to do that again.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:23.000\nLike, yeah, just do it.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:25.000\nHow do you pick pole vaults?\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:27.000\nHow do you go like, that's my shit.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:29.000\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:30.000\nIt's weird, isn't it?\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:34.000\nBecause they're jumping, but they're doing it with a big stick.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:35.000\nSometimes it snaps in half.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:40.000\nAnd what you have is a giant knife, like two fiberglass knives in your hand\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:43.000\nthat can just impale you through your abdomen.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:44.000\nComing and going.\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:45.000\nI mean, let's face it, really.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:49.000\nWhat Olympic activities do we even approve of?\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:51.000\nLike, maybe like running.\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:53.000\nRunning's good.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:55.000\nSwimming, I guess.\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:56.000\nNo, swimming.\n\n02:56.000 --> 03:00.000\nYou don't have, there's never a cause in life to swim fast.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:01.000\nYeah, let's not compete.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:02.000\nYou're not going to have to swim a shark.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:04.000\nIf you're swimming, we should do it as a team.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:05.000\nLike, not competitive.\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:07.000\nWhat causes in life, or is it about this idea?\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:08.000\nThis is what I could never figure out.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:11.000\nThis is the Olympic rhetoric that I never understood.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:14.000\nIt's this idea of like, oh, it's about nations coming together,\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:17.000\nbut then it's also at the exact same times,\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:18.000\nit's about nations coming together.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:24.000\nIt's about proving which country can be better,\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:29.000\nand about the potential of the human potential.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:33.000\nIt's kind of how quickly you can bankrupt a city or a country\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:36.000\nby building a bunch of stadia that are never going to be used again.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:41.000\nI just, I mean, what if you drafted your team in the Olympics?\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:44.000\nLike, you got all the skiers, and then like,\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:47.000\nyou had to like, you know, each country got to like,\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:49.000\nget like everyone else's.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:51.000\nYou know, I love is the biathlon in the Winter Olympics,\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:54.000\nwhere they ski and shoot, because that's some real shit.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:57.000\nWell, that's what calls into question the whole endeavor\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:00.000\nof Olympics, because it's like, why not fucking chess\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:03.000\nif you can ski and shoot as like a sport?\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:08.000\nIf you were a Scandinavian, like, homeless person with a gun,\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:11.000\nlike, you need to be able to ski around, not die,\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:15.000\nand then kill your food and carry your gun on your back,\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:18.000\nlike, that's like some hunting.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:20.000\nYeah, I mean, I think the Olympics are a little silly\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:21.000\nat this point, right?\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:24.000\nI think the only sport that really comes in handy in day-to-day life\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:26.000\nis water polo.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:29.000\nWater polo is fun, because you try to kill other people\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:30.000\nfor most of the game.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:34.000\nI keep finding myself in situations where I'm in my\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:37.000\nunderwear with a little cap on my head.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:38.000\nRight.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:40.000\nAnd you want to hold a ball up your head?\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:44.000\nI want to throw a ball through a small net,\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:47.000\nbut there's never anybody else there to pass it to.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:48.000\nRight.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:50.000\nThat's what satisfies me about water polo.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:54.000\nMy driver, not tonight's driver, but that's whoever\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:56.000\nmy previous driver was, because it brings up the thing,\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:58.000\nit says, what did you think about so-and-so?\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:02.000\nI believe my last driver's, because I just clicked through,\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:08.000\nbut I think my last driver's name was Usola.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:09.000\nHow do you spell that?\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:13.000\nU-S-H-O-L-A, Usola.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:19.000\nI tipped him $20, because I was like, this guy's life is a mess.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:22.000\nYou can be a famous baseball player named Poo-Holes,\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:23.000\nand you're fine.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:24.000\nYeah.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:25.000\nYou've got to get good at something.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:28.000\nYep, yep.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:29.000\nHe's using his name.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:35.000\nI went to the, I went to the, I'll talk about that later\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:36.000\nprobably.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:39.000\nThat's too, that's too, too, too thick.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:42.000\nToo thick, too thick a cut of beef for the beginning.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:43.000\nNot for the uninitiated.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:44.000\nNeed something lighter.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:46.000\nI was walking down the road today and I saw a guy that\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:47.000\nlooked so much like Spencer.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:49.000\nI was, I almost went up to him and said, are you trying?\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:50.000\nLike, are you a big fan?\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:54.000\nBecause it looked like somebody who had dedicated efforts\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:55.000\nto look like Spencer.\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:56.000\nWhere was he?\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:58.000\nHe was walking into like a juice place.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:00.000\nOh, yeah, that's not me.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:01.000\nYeah, that's not you.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:02.000\nYou should have set him straight.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:04.000\nIf he wants to really pull off the Spencer thing,\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:05.000\nhe don't walk into the juice place.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:06.000\nNo.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:13.000\nI started watching this new true crime show called Cold Justice,\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:16.000\nand it's like a very unusual show because it's,\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:18.000\nwe're all familiar with cold cases now,\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:19.000\nthe appeal of those.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nWell, this crime hasn't been solved yet.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:28.000\nIt's these two women and they go from town to town.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:33.000\nThe whole thing has this very uplifting mood to it because\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:39.000\nthese women come to your town and solve your cold case for you.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:40.000\nSure.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:46.000\nSo the way it's edited, it's just like, it's just on this side\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:50.000\nof like, it just feels more like a home improvement show.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:53.000\nLike the music and the editing of it are like,\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:56.000\nso they roll in and they're like, they're like,\n\n06:56.000 --> 07:02.000\nso Tiffany Johnson got sexually assaulted and murdered 10 years\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:04.000\nago and they can't figure out how it is.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:06.000\nHere's the police that couldn't figure out how it was.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:07.000\nHi, how are you?\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:12.000\nAnd then they go to the family who have been unable to have\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:15.000\nclosure for 10 years and they chat with them,\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:17.000\nbut they're very upbeat and they're like,\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:20.000\nthey're doing bits not in front of the family,\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:23.000\nbut it's like, the family's going to watch the show.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.000\nSo then there's like, it has like this,\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:28.000\nthey try to create this little feeling of camaraderie because\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:30.000\nthey're working with the cops and they're like,\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:32.000\nhey, we're driving to the penitentiary.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:34.000\nWe're going to talk to Ringo.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:37.000\nAnything you guys wanted to say to us?\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:38.000\nYeah.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:39.000\nThat's a big 10-4.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:42.000\nIf you could just get him to say that he killed Tiffany Johnson,\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:43.000\nthat would be great.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:45.000\nGet him to say he murdered and raped her.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:49.000\nI mean, that's what we want.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:51.000\nAnd they're like, yeah, I wish.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:53.000\nDo they always get their man?\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:54.000\nYeah, they do.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:55.000\nThey apparently do.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:58.000\nSo then they go to the, and then the music kind of gets\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nkind of lilting and they come back, you know,\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:01.000\nthey structure it.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:06.000\nSo it's like you check in with the grieved family members.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nAnd so then at the end, it's like, it just feels very much\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:11.000\nlike one of those shows where we remodel your kitchen.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:14.000\nThey keep coming back and going, guess who murdered your\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:15.000\ndaughter 10 years ago?\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:16.000\nIt was the mailman.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:17.000\nYou were right.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:18.000\nYou were right.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:19.000\nNo, I knew it.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:20.000\nI knew it.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:23.000\nYou know how the criminal justice system said it wasn't the\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:24.000\nmailman, but you did?\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:25.000\nWell, you were right.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:28.000\nYou know, I thought it was amazing.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:31.000\nI mean, it's a good show, but it really was tasteless when\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:34.000\nthey were like, you know, we're about to reveal the killer,\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:35.000\nmove that truck.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:38.000\nAnd then he's like, the killer's behind a truck.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:39.000\nWhich show is that?\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:40.000\nIs it called Move That Truck?\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:43.000\nNo, it's a great joke and everyone loved it.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:47.000\nI watched a new show called, it's about cold cases too,\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:50.000\nbut they make it look real sexy by the end of it.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:52.000\nIt's called Pimp My Cold Case.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:55.000\nThey put an aquarium in someone's coffin.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:56.000\nYeah.\n\n08:56.000 --> 09:01.000\nAnd at the end of it, you're the boss of Cupcakes.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:04.000\nWait a second, Harmon.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:05.000\nEvery time.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:07.000\nI'll wait an hour and a half.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:10.000\nEvery time they come on the show, they solve a case.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:12.000\nWhy aren't they the most famous detectives in the world?\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:15.000\nI don't think these cases are all that cold.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:18.000\nI think it feels to me like, basically, they're just taking\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:22.000\nthe budget and time that a television show affords\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:27.000\nthat a municipal government doesn't afford its victims\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:34.000\nbecause it costs $500,000 and 48 hours to detect semen\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:37.000\na little better, like, you know, act like you give a fuck.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nWell, that's very depressing.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:42.000\nWell, if you think about it, you know there's a dollar cost to this stuff.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nYou know that black people get murdered and, like,\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:49.000\nthey don't fucking send David Caruso into a fucking, you know, black light lab.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:52.000\nNo, but it's depressing that it's so easy to impact justice\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nthat you could be like, we got a TV show.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:56.000\nWe're going to come in and fund the government.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:58.000\nI truly think that's what it is.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:01.000\nI mean, we know that that's essentially what the Innocence Project is,\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.000\nis that they're, you know, it's like, holy shit,\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:06.000\nif you just bothered to take the time,\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:11.000\neveryone turns out to be innocent, but holy crap, like, like, it's like, it's like, you know,\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:13.000\nyou're up on your knees and you're better.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:16.000\nYou're either about to make yourself a cocktail or a jerk.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:19.000\nShould I rub your nipple or do you need to handle this?\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:20.000\nEither way you should.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:22.000\nWhy can't it be both?\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:23.000\nRight.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:24.000\nAll right.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:29.000\nSpeaking of perfect worlds, a special guest tonight.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nI did tell, I told you guys this a thousand times, right,\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:35.000\nthat I went to the doctor and he was, I was worried about my testicles\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:36.000\ngetting to that age.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:37.000\nI thought maybe I felt something.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:38.000\nYeah.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:41.000\nAnd then the doctor, doctor's like, well, do you want me to,\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:42.000\ndo you want me to feel them?\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:43.000\nYeah.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:44.000\nWell, I'd make me feel better.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:45.000\nIt came here.\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:47.000\nAnd then he, like, he just started feeling,\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:50.000\nI don't know if I caught myself, like I started touching my nipple.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:51.000\nAgain?\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:52.000\nI reached up.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:53.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:54.000\nI was just making sure.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:55.000\nIt's a story.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:56.000\nI was just making sure I had talked about that.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:57.000\nOh, God damn it.\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:00.000\nIf that's a recurring thing, then we have to talk about that.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:04.000\nOur next guest has been seen in all media,\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:09.000\njust like everyone else, because the world is now a hive mind in\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:19.000\nwhich everyone has an equal chance to cause a riot in Tunisia or\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:20.000\ndie in obscurity.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:21.000\nIt really doesn't matter.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:23.000\nFame means nothing.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:29.000\nBut if you're, if you like nice, interesting, good kids with hearts\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:35.000\nof gold and minds like a labyrinth, and you like our friend Duncan\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:39.000\nTrussell, this guy rules in that crew, you know?\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:41.000\nI call him the Pembertunes.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:44.000\nPlease welcome Johnny Pemberton to my bed.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:45.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:51.000\nJohnny Pemberton to the stage.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:52.000\nYeah.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:53.000\nYeah.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:54.000\nSorry.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:56.000\nWe didn't really explain anything to you, because we don't.\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:57.000\nHi, guys.\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:00.000\nWe've been working with the format a little bit since we lost our audience.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:01.000\nIt's great.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:02.000\nIt's a great new format.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:03.000\nA lot of new changes and stuff.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:04.000\nIt's really good.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:06.000\nThis could be big what's happening right now.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nUsing all the mics he's about to.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:10.000\nWell, as a specify, I don't want to make a mistake.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:12.000\nWell, Johnny, Johnny, three mic Pembertunes.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:15.000\nThis is good, because we only had one guest lined up,\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:18.000\nbut you could actually fill in for three guests right now.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:19.000\nI'll do three.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:20.000\nWhat do you want me to do?\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:21.000\nIs it three?\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:22.000\nYou might already be.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:24.000\nDid you bring some clips from your new show Pembertunes?\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:25.000\nYeah.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:26.000\nDid we have those clips?\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:27.000\nWhat are the Pembertunes?\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:28.000\nPembertunes episode.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:30.000\nPembertunes episode two is the best.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:32.000\nIt's got a lot of new.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:34.000\nWe've got Neil Patrick Harris and David Allen Greer.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:35.000\nYeah.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:36.000\nYou guys go skiing, right?\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:39.000\nWe go skiing on the summertime.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:40.000\nIt's a mountain.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:43.000\nIt's like a thing with wheels, like wheel skiing type thing.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:44.000\nIt's crazy.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:45.000\nAll right.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:46.000\nWell, let's let's check that out.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:47.000\nClick click.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:50.000\nWhat's going on out here?\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:52.000\nI'm David Allen Greer.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:55.000\nI shouldn't have been skiing in the first place.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nNot on mud.\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:01.000\nI'm Neil Patrick Harris.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:04.000\nI'm a special guest, Neil deGrasse Tyson.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:08.000\nHey, Neil.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:09.000\nTimber.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:11.000\nOh, shit.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:14.000\nHow does all this work, Neil deGrasse Tyson?\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:15.000\nI just got killed by a tree.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:20.000\nDon't ask me to space and beyond.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:21.000\nWow.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:24.000\nSo is it kind of, is it a half hour or is it?\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:26.000\nSo that was all live action.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:27.000\nYeah.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:28.000\nIt's all live action.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:29.000\nThen you go back and flash animated.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:30.000\nYeah.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:33.000\nEverything is done in a, it's reverse flash with live action.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:34.000\nEverything is comped in.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:37.000\nThey do it like a thing where they, it's all composite shots.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:42.000\nIt's like drunk history meets Caroline goes to the city.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:43.000\nCaroline goes to the city.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:44.000\nYeah.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:46.000\nIt's drunk history meets Caroline goes to the city except this time we're taking the\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:50.000\ndrawings that Caroline made you never saw and we're showing them.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:55.000\nAnd Caroline goes to the city is like a young Sheldon to Caroline in the city.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:56.000\nRight.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:58.000\nIt's about her getting there.\n\n13:58.000 --> 13:59.000\nYeah.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:00.000\nBefore she got there.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:02.000\nWhat's the angle on young Sheldon?\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:03.000\nGive me the log line.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\nElevator pitch on young Sheldon.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nI think that, I think the title is the elevator pitch.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:10.000\nIt's like he's a, it's a single camera Chuck Glory show.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:11.000\nRight.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:12.000\nThat's the real pitch.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:13.000\nOh, it's a single camera, huh?\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:14.000\nYeah.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:15.000\nI think so.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:16.000\nRight.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:17.000\nWow.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:18.000\nI didn't know that.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:19.000\nReally get intimate.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:22.000\nI said, I met young Sheldon or you met Chuck.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:23.000\nThey're the same person.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:24.000\nI met Chuck.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:26.000\nLori at a, that's some thing.\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:27.000\nOh, I think I met him.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:35.000\nI think I met him at Caroline's and at that thing that Eric Idol did the dick, the dick\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:36.000\nshow.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:38.000\nI think he was there.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:39.000\nAll about dick.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:40.000\nYeah.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:41.000\nAnyways.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:42.000\nYeah.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:43.000\nYeah.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:44.000\nI was like, oh, that's Chuck.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:45.000\nLori.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:46.000\nYeah.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:47.000\nWe met at the after party there.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:48.000\nAnd, and then I, and then I asked him.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:52.000\nLike, is there something you, what is it that you want?\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:53.000\nWhat is it?\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:54.000\nRight.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:55.000\nLike, what do you want?\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:56.000\nWhat do you want?\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:57.000\nWhy did you get out of bed today?\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:00.000\nBut the way, but the way you said it was, what the fuck dude?\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:01.000\nYeah.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:02.000\nWhat did he say?\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:05.000\nHe said, he said, well, actually I want what you, what you have.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:07.000\nI want to do, I'd love to do a single camera show.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:10.000\nThat's a, you know, that's it.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:13.000\nI was waiting for him to say that is a critical darling.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:17.000\nAnd it's very well crafted, but he really just was talking about medium.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:18.000\nI'd like to do what you do.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:20.000\nI'd like to just work less cameras.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:21.000\nYeah.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.000\nJust less cameras and have more time to edit.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:25.000\nThat does sound nice.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:27.000\nNobody wants to do single cameras.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:30.000\nIf you can do a multi camera thing, the hours are way better.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:31.000\nIt's cheaper.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:32.000\nI think, yeah.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:36.000\nBut I guess if you, I mean, well, I would imply maybe he has a creative ambition that's\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:42.000\nnot being, maybe, maybe that's, maybe that's all it's left once you've conquered the,\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:46.000\nthe medium, you know, you go like, okay, but what, what would I, what can't I do?\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:47.000\nI'm going to do that.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:49.000\nI guess I would retire.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:51.000\nI would start, I would start pole vaulting.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:52.000\nYeah.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:54.000\nI wouldn't, I would not do it.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:56.000\nI'm not going to, I did, I did think for a little bit.\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nLike maybe I'll do multi cam, but then I tried it.\n\n15:58.000 --> 15:59.000\nI sucked at it.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:04.000\nAnd I wasn't like, Oh, that means it's important to do.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:06.000\nI was like, I'll do it again.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:09.000\nI can't watch it or make it.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:15.000\nNow I have to figure out a different way to get the fuck out of this business.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\nWhat about supplements?\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:21.000\nI don't think those earn you money.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:26.000\nAlthough if you go to forehims.com, you can get supplements.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:32.000\nYou can help us make money by putting in the, the code erection.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\nWe could prevent you from going bald.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:35.000\nRight.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:38.000\nAnd that'll make you money because the world loves hair.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:39.000\nYeah.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:42.000\nAnd they're willing to pay for it in India.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:45.000\nDon't we get it from there?\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:48.000\nOh, we get it from, if we get it from India.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:49.000\nRight.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:51.000\nWe're going bald and they're, they're giving us their hair.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:54.000\nThey've got hair and hair like hair.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:58.000\nWell, what's been new, Pemberton?\n\n16:58.000 --> 16:59.000\nAnything?\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:00.000\nI don't know, man.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:03.000\nJust been moving through physical space on a daily basis.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nWould you think about that royal wedding?\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nI know that you're a big royal watcher.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:08.000\nYeah.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:09.000\nI did.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:11.000\nI had a fun time looking at the front page of CNN because sometimes I will click\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nat CNN just as a default.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:18.000\nLike as a time waster kind of, like I just click CNN to look at it.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:22.000\nAnd the entire front page of CNN was royal wedding news.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:23.000\nYeah.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:27.000\nThe entire page, even above the full was all nothing but CNN, nothing but royal wedding.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:28.000\nIt is a big deal.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:31.000\nDoesn't it feel, you're maybe, you're too young for this, but it's like, I was like probably,\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:35.000\nI was 10-ish or something like that when the princess die thing was happening.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:36.000\nI was alive for that.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:38.000\nNot her dying, but her getting married.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:42.000\nLike it was a royal wedding that everyone really cared about because she was, that was the\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:47.000\n80s version of being black was that she was just like from fucking chutney or something.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nPeople think they use that.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.000\nShe was from Warwickshire.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:52.000\nShe was from chutney.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nShe was from Stoke on Trent.\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:56.000\nThat was unacceptable back then.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:58.000\nShe was from Elephant and Castle, which is my favorite place.\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:01.000\nI think that's where Michael Cain is from.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:07.000\nIt's called Elephant and Castle because it was originally called the, some Spanish princess\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:12.000\nbanging one of the royals and she was the Infante de Castile.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:15.000\nLike the child of Castile, Castile.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:19.000\nAnd nobody that lived there wanted to say, like, we're not calling that fucking Infante\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:22.000\nde Castile, Elephant and Castle.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:25.000\nYou know, they were like, we're not calling it fucking Infante.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:28.000\nWe're not speaking Spanish under any circumstances.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:29.000\nThat's smart.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nThere's a place called Blubber Houses in Britain.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:32.000\nBlubber Houses?\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:33.000\nBlubber.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:34.000\nHow are the Brits?\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:35.000\nI'm sure the answer is bad.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:36.000\nI mean, whatever.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:37.000\nIs it, is it bad?\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:38.000\nI hear they're Brexitting.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:39.000\nHave you heard about this?\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:40.000\nThey're Brexitting.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:41.000\nHave you seen this?\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:42.000\nHave you heard about this?\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:43.000\nHave you heard about this?\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:44.000\nDouble Brexiting?\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:45.000\nDouble Brexiting.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:46.000\nNow there's a boy, a racial princess.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:47.000\nHey, hey, hey.\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:48.000\nDouble Brexit.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:49.000\nYeah.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:55.000\nThat makes me want to frame Roger Rabbit.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:57.000\nBut you're supposed to be helping him.\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:58.000\nI know.\n\n18:58.000 --> 18:59.000\nThat's why I'm so bloody mad.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:03.000\nThe double Brexit is when you poop on an Englishman's chest, right?\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:04.000\nYeah.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:07.000\nBut yeah, I don't know anything about her.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:08.000\nI know.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:09.000\nI just, I heard, I heard like a.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:10.000\nShe was on suits.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:12.000\nShe was a co-worker of Jeff.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:15.000\nI was in, I was on a show that she was in.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:16.000\nIt's crazy that she's American.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:17.000\nYeah.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:21.000\nI mean, it's almost like it's being kind of overshadowed by the fact that she's, because\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:22.000\nthe people keep saying biracial.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:23.000\nShe's biracial.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:25.000\nThat's like, well, fuck that.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:26.000\nShe's from, she's from America.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:28.000\nI heard she was also outspoken.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:29.000\nYeah.\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:30.000\nProbably.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:31.000\nI heard she's outspoken.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:33.000\nI heard she doesn't go there.\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:34.000\nReally?\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:35.000\nWait, no.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:36.000\nAre you sure?\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:41.000\nWell, she, she'll go there, but she'll make sure that.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:43.000\nWell, she doesn't play that.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:44.000\nShe doesn't play that.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:46.000\nShe won't certainly not play that.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:47.000\nNo.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:48.000\nBut she, she will.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:49.000\nShe won't do that.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:51.000\nI mean, she may do that.\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:53.000\nI couldn't say.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:56.000\nI can't understand getting excited about royalty.\n\n19:56.000 --> 20:00.000\nHowever, I guess the one thing to get excited about it would be, I guess it's like NASCAR.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:04.000\nLike you're, you could say all you, you're watching all you want, but you're waiting\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:05.000\nfor someone to die.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:06.000\nRight.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:08.000\nOtherwise you're saying you like to watch cars driving a circle.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:13.000\nSo like you're, you're watching the royal, we get, we get royal fever when there's a\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:15.000\nwreck, when there's something that's happening.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:16.000\nLike who is the Fergie lady?\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:19.000\nDid she, what did she sleep with a plumber or something?\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:20.000\nShe did coke too.\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:21.000\nWhoa.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:25.000\nSo the royals, the royals were so into the royals because they're, it's, it's being\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:30.000\nturbulized and what was the king that slept with?\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:31.000\nThat was a big thing here.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:33.000\nThey abdicate the throne and whatnot.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:34.000\nThey lived in a boat.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:36.000\nThey're not really allowed to do anything.\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:37.000\nRight.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:40.000\nLike you can go visit their hat under plexiglass.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:46.000\nI went to London and the line to see their fucking hat.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:50.000\nThey call it a crown was like, I'm American.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:54.000\nIt's a, it's a hat and the line was longer than the Indiana Jones ride.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:56.000\nIt was like unacceptable.\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:58.000\nDid you see him?\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:04.000\nLike, like, like, yeah, I walked up and it was like, it was a hat under glass with like,\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:07.000\nI can't tell the difference between real jewels and like, like,\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:08.000\nThey're not the real jewels.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:09.000\nThe real jewels.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:10.000\nI keep getting took.\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:13.000\nSo now they have, you go up and you want to see the Kohi Noor, the mountain of light,\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\nspeaking of Indian things that we stole.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:16.000\nAnd you go there.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:20.000\nIt's not even the fucking real flimflam because that keeps getting taken.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:21.000\nSo that's how you go.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:24.000\nSo you stand in line and go look at the crown jewels and you're looking at a bunch of bullshit.\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:28.000\nAnd since the world is ending and there's no reward for being cultured anymore,\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:35.000\nlike, can we just say as Americans, can we even access, I was touring that place,\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:40.000\nthat castle, whatever you call it, the, the, the, the English castle.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nAnd, and they're just like back and tail.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:51.000\nTo your left is the Bloody Tower. It's said that Queen Belinda every night always scratches her arse\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:58.000\nbecause in 1216, an affair with the Duke of Kensington caused quite a stir in their bodies.\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:03.000\nWell, it's like, this shit happened like so long ago that it's not even,\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:04.000\nthey didn't even have paper.\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:06.000\nLike, like, like you're just saying some shit.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:07.000\nLike it's a ghost story.\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:09.000\nThey used to call hats crowns.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:12.000\nIt's just kind of like, I can't access that stuff.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:18.000\nI'm like, I'm like, I don't know what anything older than 200 years could possibly be like,\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:23.000\nbecause if we believed, if we valued that stuff in America, then we'd have to cop to slavery.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:25.000\nWe'd be like, oh, yeah.\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:30.000\nAll of our awesome ancient history is about slavery or genocide.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:37.000\nWe owe it to ourselves and each other to be always looking forward in this country.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:40.000\nI just said a tourist to the south with the who's live guys and like this,\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:45.000\nnot a lot of upbeat southern tourist attractions.\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:48.000\nLike unless you're talking about blues museums or like, you know, like,\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:49.000\nAlligators.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:50.000\nAlligator museums.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:52.000\nWhat was downbeat?\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:58.000\nThe Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:01.000\nBecause aside from Bobby Jones and Margaret Mitchell,\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:07.000\nwho was the slavery movie gone with the wind.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:09.000\nThe slavery movie?\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:11.000\nShe makes it romantic.\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:15.000\nNo, there's just there's just a thousand dead Confederate soldiers and a lot of them,\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:17.000\nyou know, have my name.\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:19.000\nIt's pretty rough.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:20.000\nYeah.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:22.000\nI can't, I can't tour anything.\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:25.000\nI went to the went to the Anne Frank house.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:26.000\nThat's it.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:27.000\nThat's a kick in the pants.\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:28.000\nIs it?\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:29.000\nIt's a lot of laughs.\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:31.000\nI was there.\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:34.000\nYeah, but it's like the furniture is all gone.\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:35.000\nWhat?\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:36.000\nThey you go.\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:37.000\nSee, I would have only gone.\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:42.000\nYou go up these steep stairs and then there's like there's shit printed out on Wikipedia\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:46.000\nand taped to the walls that you can read as you move through the.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:48.000\nIt's just taped to the walls.\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:49.000\nYeah.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:50.000\nThat seems like pretty low.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:51.000\nPretty like.\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:52.000\nYeah.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:53.000\nThat's not good.\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:59.000\nWhere did you go to your house and where was that Philadelphia Boston?\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:01.000\nIt was kind of cool because they had to do that.\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:03.000\nThat's what a fireplace looked like when polar fear.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:05.000\nIt was tiny like this, this big.\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:08.000\nIt was low and it looked like a hobbit might be hanging out there.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:11.000\nIt all looks very talky and that was the one thing that I thought that was the one tour.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:15.000\nWe went to Al Capone's hideout somewhere in northern Wisconsin, me and my family.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:18.000\nAnd I was like, oh, all the hallways were tiny.\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:23.000\nI always thought that museums when they showed like the recreations of the places in museums\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:27.000\nthat they were just saving money, like they were making it like 0.8 scale or something\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:28.000\nto like use less lumber.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:31.000\nBut like, I guess people, they didn't have vitamins.\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:33.000\nSo they were just like little hobbits back then.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:34.000\nHe was like 5'2\".\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:39.000\nAl Capone was just like, he just looked big compared to all the other little tiny people\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:43.000\nand they had little, their planes were small and their beer bottles were small.\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:49.000\nWe do like, when I go out into comedy shows, we play in a lot of old theaters and they're all built by tiny people.\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:51.000\nLike you can bump your head on everything.\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:52.000\nIt's crazy.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:53.000\nSpencer, you know things.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:54.000\nOh yeah.\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:59.000\nIs there a name for a disorder where I can't hold a brand new pen without breaking off the clip?\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:03.000\nLike the lapel clip or whatever you call it, pocket clip.\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.000\nLack of object permanence.\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:08.000\nI just, I can't, I break them immediately.\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:11.000\nWhy don't you get the pens without those things on them?\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:13.000\nWhat am I going to break?\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:14.000\nSo it is weird.\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:20.000\nLike I feel like there's a lot of American whole culture that's wrapped up in like a historicalness or whatever,\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:23.000\nlike an intentional misreading or misunderstanding of history.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:24.000\nIt's really weird.\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:26.000\nI mean, I don't know.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:31.000\nIt's just like, because America started in 1776, it's like we've been, we've barely been around.\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:35.000\nAnd most of that time, like civil rights haven't existed.\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:39.000\nBut we go like, oh yeah, it was so long ago, this stuff happened.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:42.000\nIt's like, no, it happened when my mom was alive.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:44.000\nLike there's a before and after.\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:45.000\nIt's like really crazy.\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:47.000\nYeah, we don't like dealing with that shit.\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:51.000\nBut like, I just was listening to a podcast that's like about lore and it talked about the Golem.\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:52.000\nYou know the Golem?\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:56.000\nLike this mythical Golem, like a homunculus or a chimera.\n\n25:56.000 --> 26:00.000\nThe Golem legend only goes back to like late 1700s.\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:02.000\nWhat was the city that the Golem was supposed to be in?\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:05.000\nLike was it like an, I think it was in some Spanish city or maybe.\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:06.000\nIt's like a giant.\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:13.000\nIt was a clay monster made by Jewish people to protect the city.\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:23.000\nYeah, or not the city, the people, because apparently it was a huge thing back then to pretend that Jewish people were behind blood sacrifices.\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:30.000\nAnd so you'd kill a body, you'd kill a child and then hide it in someone's like a Jewish person's basement and call the police and go like,\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:36.000\nI think this Jewish person just sucked all the blood out of this child and then they'd go and they'd be like, well, clearly this happened.\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:40.000\nAnd if they could, they could be like, we were all over here.\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:42.000\nProg, Golem, Prog, Prog.\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:48.000\nIn Shul and we have like, we have a thousand witnesses in a tight knit community and we're peaceful people.\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:51.000\nAnd then we go like, well, you probably used one of them Golems.\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:52.000\nNo, it was the other way.\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:57.000\nSo they're like, the Golems were to like tell people not to like, don't hide a body here.\n\n26:57.000 --> 27:00.000\nWell, yeah, he like, please don't hide a body here.\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:02.000\nHe put the body back where it came from.\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:03.000\nHe put the body back.\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:04.000\nWas that really what the Golem did?\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:05.000\nDid he put the body back?\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:07.000\nHe did one of the things he did.\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:11.000\nIt's like throwing a tear gas canister back at the cops.\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:14.000\nBut the second he touches that body, he becomes a necessary.\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:16.000\nSo he made a clay, he can just dissolve.\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:17.000\nYeah, he's a Golem.\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:18.000\nHe just turns back in the clay.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:20.000\nThat's what the priests said.\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:21.000\nIt was the Golem.\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:22.000\nThe Golem did it.\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:23.000\nWhat about state lines though?\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:25.000\nI don't know how that works in New York.\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:27.000\nThe Golems were made out of state lines.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:32.000\nSo they crossed themselves and they become a federal crime just by existing?\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:33.000\nYeah.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:35.000\nRemember how important the county line was in Dukes of Hazard?\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:36.000\nOh, man.\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:39.000\nThey just drive up and down that road and then it was like, every time it happened for the\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:43.000\nfirst time, they'd be like, yeah, they're Duke boys across the county line and go, go, go.\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:45.000\nYeah, because Roscoe Peacoltre would lose all jurisdiction.\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:46.000\nYeah, he can't.\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:47.000\nI can't.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:48.000\nI mean...\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:49.000\nHis name was Roscoe Peacoltre?\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:50.000\nYeah.\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:51.000\nRoscoe Peacoltre.\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:52.000\nNo, was it?\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:53.000\nIt was at Chickasaw County, right?\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.000\nIt was Chickasaw County.\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:57.000\nThey would go into the other county and then, yeah, then all hell broke loose.\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:59.000\nWell, I thought you forgot the name of Hazard County.\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:01.000\nHis name was Roscoe.\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:03.000\nBut they were crossing the Chickasaw County, didn't they?\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:04.000\nI don't know.\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:06.000\nChickabay, Tain the Wayne.\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:09.000\nRoscoe Peacoltre was the name of the...\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:10.000\nAnd J.D....\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:12.000\nIt was Jefferson Davis Hogg.\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:17.000\nSo if you don't think, I got T's in elementary school.\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:23.000\nSo I went to the Turner Upfronts because I'm part of the Turner family.\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:29.000\nAnd it was really funny because I was there a couple of years ago.\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:32.000\nI was there for the one that was before the elections.\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:37.000\nAnd I remember at that one, because I remember we had...\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:41.000\nAllie, a shock hat on shortly after that.\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:44.000\nAnd we had both just seen each other in New York, which is why she was on the show.\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:48.000\nWe were at the Turner Upfronts and we were talking about how weird it was,\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:52.000\nhow much they were selling that the election was going to be a squeaker,\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:56.000\nwhich made it extra funny this year because they were like...\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:59.000\nWolf Blitzer couldn't be found in the building.\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:05.000\nLast time he was front and center and was promising these sponsors.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:11.000\nFolks, the barely unspoken but practically spoken message was,\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:16.000\nhey, Colgate, Nike, Heinz, whatever, whoever's here.\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:19.000\nDon't be thinking that Hillary's got this in the bag.\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:22.000\nThis is going to be a fucking barn burner.\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:23.000\nThat's what a squeaker means?\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:24.000\nYeah.\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:26.000\nThey kept using that phrase.\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:28.000\nAnd all of our research shows, it's going to be a squeaker.\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:33.000\nBecause they're selling a television show called The News that hasn't happened yet.\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:35.000\nA squeaker is one of advertisers.\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:36.000\nYeah, very close.\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:37.000\nAlmost too close to tell ourselves.\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:42.000\nAnd so then this year, they come out, I missed a year probably,\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:48.000\nbut then they come out and it's like, they barely mentioned CNN,\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:53.000\nexcept towards the end and then they run this thing that's like this poetry piece\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:59.000\nthat's about what if everyone started calling Apple's bananas\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:04.000\nand then there's one girl who knows an Apple as an Apple or something like that.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:09.000\nBut it's mostly just like visual stuff and then there's like an understated title\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:13.000\nthat says like, the truth is more important than ever right now.\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:15.000\nI was like, yeah, I wonder why?\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:17.000\nHow'd that happen?\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:20.000\nWho created that fucking marketplace?\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:23.000\nYeah, the truth is pretty valuable right now.\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:26.000\nIt's crazy how foggy it got there for a while.\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:28.000\nRemember the squeaker?\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:29.000\nYou cocks?\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:32.000\nIt's crazy how they keep paying people to come on their own channel\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:35.000\nand say, these are oranges, these are oranges, these are oranges.\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:36.000\nGive me money.\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:39.000\nThe company saying they're not supposed to say that.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:44.000\nPlease pay us $500,000 for 30 seconds during Kellyanne Conway\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:50.000\nlike spitting saliva into the camera and saying that the president's dick is big\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:52.000\nso that Anderson Cooper can roll his eyes at it\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:55.000\nbecause the truth is more important than ever right now.\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:57.000\nHe has a big dick?\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:59.000\nIt's pretty big.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\nI haven't watched it in a while.\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:03.000\nThat's canon on the news.\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:05.000\nIt's really wide, it's super wide.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:06.000\nIt's not very long.\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:07.000\nSo it's wider than it is long?\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:09.000\nIn high school they called him trash cantalids.\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:10.000\nTrash cantalids.\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:15.000\nBecause his dick is like 14 inches wide but it's only about 2 inches long.\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:20.000\nHe can please 11 school kids by spinning it.\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:22.000\nAnd it's not even against the law\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:25.000\nbecause it's technically zonable as playground equipment.\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:27.000\nOh, it's one of those little things you sit on.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:29.000\nIt's called sim spin, right?\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:31.000\nIt's called sim spin but don't let that...\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:34.000\nI mean that's been co-opted by the porn industry as being like...\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:36.000\nThat was a spinner.\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:37.000\nThat's a squeaker.\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:39.000\nA squeaker and a spinner and that's the same.\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:40.000\nIt's going to be a spinner.\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:41.000\nIt's a squeak and spin.\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:42.000\nA snapper.\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:43.000\nA squeak and a squeak.\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nIt's red snapper, squeak and spin all the way until the end.\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:47.000\nIt's a snapper, squeak and spin.\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:49.000\nThat's just a great fish.\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:50.000\nYeah.\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:55.000\nI got a huge dent in my head where I hit my head in New York.\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:56.000\nI thought that was a shingles.\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:59.000\nYeah, so you don't hit that shingles anymore?\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:00.000\nNo, it wasn't shingles.\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:01.000\nIt was a wound.\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:02.000\nAnd then the...\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:03.000\nStill there?\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:04.000\nAnd then the...\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:05.000\nI hate to...\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:06.000\nI don't...\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:09.000\nI'm not a big fan of using the word scab but like...\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:10.000\nYou're getting strong!\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:11.000\nThe scab...\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:12.000\nThe scab...\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:13.000\nBecause I...\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:16.000\nDifferent people are squeamish about different stuff and to me scabs are kind of gross when\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:18.000\npeople talk about them a lot.\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:20.000\nBut there's no way around it this time.\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:23.000\nI had a big scab on my head and it came away.\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nWhat do you mean it came away?\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nBut even though there wasn't a...\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:29.000\nI'm trying not to say...\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:32.000\nHere's the gross words for like a scab coming off.\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:33.000\nIt's sloughed off.\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:34.000\nDetached?\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:36.000\nIt's like as if the scab was like...\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:42.000\nEven though when I got the head wound it wasn't actively bleeding but then it turned\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:49.000\ninto this big scab and then when the scab came away there's a divot now where the scab\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:50.000\nwas.\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:56.000\nThe scab was like gonna like heal my head but then just collapsed my scalp like where\n\n32:56.000 --> 33:01.000\nthe wound was and started working on knitting the flesh back up and then maybe I picked\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:03.000\nthe scab too much and then they were like fuck it!\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:04.000\nYou want to fucking...\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:06.000\nThere's no flesh up there though to move.\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:08.000\nIt's like a very thin layer of skin.\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:09.000\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:13.000\nIf you felt my head right now you'd think there was bone damage because there's nothing\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:14.000\nup there but skull.\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:17.000\nI was feeling my head but I'm thinking I feel it.\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:19.000\nIt might be more Gellin's disease.\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:20.000\nMore Gellin's disease?\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:21.000\nMore Gellin's disease?\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:22.000\nMore Gellin's?\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:23.000\nMore Gellin's?\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:24.000\nMore Gellin's?\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:25.000\nMore M-O-R-G-E-L-L-O-N-S?\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:26.000\nI thought it was more Gellin's.\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:27.000\nIs it more Gellin's?\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:31.000\nI think if you have more Gellin's you can say it however you want.\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:32.000\nIt's sort of like gangstocking.\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:33.000\nGangstocking?\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:37.000\nIt's like gangstocking the disease.\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:38.000\nMore Gellin's disease.\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:39.000\nWhat is it?\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:40.000\nWhat's gangstocking?\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:45.000\nGangstocking is when you think a bunch of people are stalking you all the time and then\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:48.000\nyou go on coast to coast A.M. and talk about it every night.\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:49.000\nOkay.\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:50.000\nYeah, you're right.\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:51.000\nThat's gangstocking.\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:54.320\nAnd more Gellin's disease is when you think the aliens have put fibers in your body and\n\n33:54.320 --> 33:58.120\nthey're growing out of your skin, colorful fibers because you've been experimented by\n\n33:58.120 --> 34:02.400\nthe government and the gangstocks, they stalk you because the government is trying to keep\n\n34:02.400 --> 34:06.000\ntrack of you so you don't report it to CNN or coast to coast A.M.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:07.000\nOh.\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:08.000\nYeah.\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:11.200\nI thought, I don't know if we talked about this on this show but I know Duncan was talking\n\n34:11.200 --> 34:16.440\nabout this at one point where it's like the people that, now that we live in this world\n\n34:16.440 --> 34:24.480\nwhere we're, like there's people who are using the woke language to defend basically what\n\n34:24.480 --> 34:30.920\n10 years ago we all just recognized it's like you need help, like in terms of like mental\n\n34:30.920 --> 34:31.920\nillness.\n\n34:31.920 --> 34:36.880\nPeople are saying, people are using phrases like I identify as a person who has radio\n\n34:36.880 --> 34:40.320\nsignals coming through his teeth fillings.\n\n34:40.320 --> 34:45.120\nSo you can't tell me that I don't.\n\n34:45.120 --> 34:46.600\nYou can't call me crazy.\n\n34:46.600 --> 34:47.600\nThat's offensive.\n\n34:47.600 --> 34:48.600\nYeah.\n\n34:48.600 --> 34:49.600\nMy crazy is not your prom dress.\n\n34:49.600 --> 34:52.160\nWhich is, which is very interesting because it's like, yep, you got us.\n\n34:52.160 --> 34:53.840\nYou fucking got us.\n\n34:53.840 --> 34:56.000\nI think that's, George Norris were doing that forever though.\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:58.680\nIt kind of got, I think it's great that he does that.\n\n34:58.680 --> 35:02.920\nI love that Art Bell would do that, I mean I, it's like, Art Bell was like, he would\n\n35:02.920 --> 35:07.560\njust open the lines and go like, I want to hear from Time Travelers, now I want to hear\n\n35:07.560 --> 35:08.560\nit.\n\n35:08.560 --> 35:09.560\nYeah.\n\n35:09.560 --> 35:10.560\nYou're the Antichrist, call in.\n\n35:10.560 --> 35:11.560\nYeah.\n\n35:11.560 --> 35:13.440\nAnd he always does stuff where he, when someone says something super crazy and you think\n\n35:13.440 --> 35:17.160\nhe's about to call him on it, he goes, what color was the spaceship?\n\n35:17.160 --> 35:24.120\nThere's these guys, there's a podcast called Expanded Perspectives, I think that's what\n\n35:24.120 --> 35:25.120\nit's called.\n\n35:25.120 --> 35:26.640\nAnd it's two like Southern guys.\n\n35:26.640 --> 35:31.880\nI picture them both as looking like Charlie Daniels or like, like Johnny Paycheck.\n\n35:31.880 --> 35:32.880\nYeah.\n\n35:32.880 --> 35:38.360\nAnd they, because they talk like this and they're both, they're both, they're both fine Southern\n\n35:38.360 --> 35:44.560\nsounded gentlemen, they razz each other about whether or not their wife has got them whipped\n\n35:44.560 --> 35:49.960\nor how they're remodeling their kitchen and they're not, they're not all the way like,\n\n35:49.960 --> 35:56.120\nyou know, they're not, they're like into like Bigfoot and like Dog Man and like all this\n\n35:56.120 --> 35:57.120\nweird shit.\n\n35:57.120 --> 36:01.040\nAnd then like anybody who writes to them, they'll just read, if you just write to them\n\n36:01.040 --> 36:07.280\nand say, like the one guy, like, all right, we got to get to some of these letters.\n\n36:07.280 --> 36:12.320\nHere Expanded Perspectives, I'm a truck driver that was going down highway five and I have\n\n36:12.320 --> 36:14.120\na story to tell you.\n\n36:14.120 --> 36:15.640\nOh boy, this sounds good.\n\n36:15.640 --> 36:21.600\nLike they like vocalize on something like, I was driving when it suddenly my eyes picked\n\n36:21.600 --> 36:27.080\nup the sight of a giant lizard man on the side of the road.\n\n36:27.080 --> 36:28.080\nWhat?\n\n36:28.080 --> 36:29.080\nNo.\n\n36:29.080 --> 36:37.240\nThey often like like the guy like, and I was standing face to face with a human face\n\n36:37.240 --> 36:39.360\nin dinosaur hybrid.\n\n36:39.360 --> 36:40.360\nWhat?\n\n36:40.360 --> 36:41.360\nHoly shit.\n\n36:41.360 --> 36:43.160\nWhat episode was that?\n\n36:43.160 --> 36:44.160\nIt's all of them.\n\n36:44.160 --> 36:47.720\nThey, they, are they doing a bit or are they really yes and I think they're kind of, because\n\n36:47.720 --> 36:51.320\nbecause then I kept listening to it, I was like, wait, did they just, did you just yes\n\n36:51.320 --> 36:56.680\nand everybody who writes in, but then then sometimes they're kind of inexplicably skeptical.\n\n36:56.680 --> 37:00.720\nThey're like, well, I don't know if that really happened, but that's quite a story.\n\n37:00.720 --> 37:02.880\nMaybe it's the writing style to get some sometimes.\n\n37:02.880 --> 37:03.880\nYeah.\n\n37:03.880 --> 37:07.800\nLike a brainstorm versus a green needle shit.\n\n37:07.800 --> 37:09.120\nI heard it.\n\n37:09.120 --> 37:12.880\nSomeone explained it to me too in a way that was like, oh, that's not fun.\n\n37:12.880 --> 37:17.680\nWell, here's another way that's not fun that like, you see that commercial that were the\n\n37:17.680 --> 37:23.640\nguys like, stop the cash box and then it's like it's rock the cat box or something and\n\n37:23.640 --> 37:27.000\nit's like, yeah, they're doing rock the Casba and they're all getting the lyrics wrong.\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:32.120\nIt's like, people have been hearing the wrong sounds forever.\n\n37:32.120 --> 37:34.520\nI thought Michael Stipe had a list for 12 years.\n\n37:34.520 --> 37:35.520\nRight.\n\n37:35.520 --> 37:36.520\nDan, do you know this thing?\n\n37:36.520 --> 37:37.520\nHave you heard this?\n\n37:37.520 --> 37:39.720\nLet's see if it works up to the phone here.\n\n37:39.720 --> 37:41.200\nAre you talking about the Laurel Yanny thing?\n\n37:41.200 --> 37:42.200\nYeah.\n\n37:42.200 --> 37:43.200\nIt's like an extension.\n\n37:43.200 --> 37:44.200\nThis is a new one, but it's the same thing.\n\n37:44.200 --> 37:45.200\nIt's on a loop.\n\n37:45.200 --> 37:50.920\nYou either think in your head, think the word brainstorm or think the word, or it's green\n\n37:50.920 --> 37:51.920\nneedle.\n\n37:51.920 --> 37:52.920\nOkay.\n\n37:52.920 --> 37:55.920\nAnd there's one right answer.\n\n37:55.920 --> 37:56.920\nCome on.\n\n37:56.920 --> 37:57.920\nGo away.\n\n37:57.920 --> 38:03.400\nI just don't like all these people trying to act like they hear a Yanny going fucking\n\n38:03.400 --> 38:05.400\nhere's the Yanny.\n\n38:05.400 --> 38:06.400\nOkay.\n\n38:06.400 --> 38:11.040\nWell, that's I'm proud to say I hear neither.\n\n38:11.040 --> 38:13.200\nThat sounds like a laser.\n\n38:13.200 --> 38:14.360\nI hear what I think, man.\n\n38:14.360 --> 38:16.480\nI totally hear what I think you've not looking at.\n\n38:16.480 --> 38:17.480\nThat's crazy.\n\n38:17.480 --> 38:18.480\nI just don't.\n\n38:18.480 --> 38:20.440\nI don't think I think the acoustics aren't ideal for this.\n\n38:20.440 --> 38:21.440\nThat's the point.\n\n38:21.440 --> 38:25.200\nThat's part of it is that you just parse it because you're given incomplete information\n\n38:25.200 --> 38:30.520\nand your brain puts a perception on it is broken up into like very low frequencies and\n\n38:30.520 --> 38:31.520\nvery high frequencies.\n\n38:31.520 --> 38:34.880\nSo you, when you pick one, you're telling your brain, I want to hear the high frequency,\n\n38:34.880 --> 38:39.280\nwhich is green needles, a higher register sound than brainstorm.\n\n38:39.280 --> 38:43.760\nI will say I watched a video clip, as most of us probably did of a guy like using his\n\n38:43.760 --> 38:50.040\nlittle sound app to like move the frequencies and demonstrate, but he was only demonstrating\n\n38:50.040 --> 38:53.080\nfor me that all I ever hear is Laurel.\n\n38:53.080 --> 38:54.080\nYeah.\n\n38:54.080 --> 38:59.200\nLike he's like, look, look, look, look, yeah, look, let's round up these Yanny people and\n\n38:59.200 --> 39:02.200\nfucking put an end to this because they're psychos.\n\n39:02.200 --> 39:03.200\nI agree.\n\n39:03.200 --> 39:09.000\nBut isn't it probably like people hearing different, I mean, but they're being weird.\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:10.080\nThey're not being right.\n\n39:10.080 --> 39:11.480\nThey're being aberrant.\n\n39:11.480 --> 39:14.520\nLike they might have bad phones, right, but that's, that's aberrant.\n\n39:14.520 --> 39:16.680\nLike that's all not because that's the thing.\n\n39:16.680 --> 39:18.080\nThe fact is it did say Laurel.\n\n39:18.080 --> 39:19.760\nThe fact is that did say brainstorm.\n\n39:19.760 --> 39:24.200\nIt does in certain circumstances say sound green needle and that's, and that's an accurate\n\n39:24.200 --> 39:26.920\nperception, but it's an accurate aberrant perception of reality.\n\n39:26.920 --> 39:27.920\nYou know, that's the thing.\n\n39:27.920 --> 39:31.400\nThat's what our brains are is simply making snap, quick decisions, right?\n\n39:31.400 --> 39:33.720\nJust like people simply are wrong about stuff.\n\n39:33.720 --> 39:36.240\nThey're wrong about it being Yanny.\n\n39:36.240 --> 39:40.080\nThere's always been people that are convinced of something wrong.\n\n39:40.080 --> 39:43.360\nLike we shouldn't pretend that they're right just because they feel like they're right.\n\n39:43.360 --> 39:44.480\nNo, they're wrong.\n\n39:44.480 --> 39:45.800\nThat blue dress, gold dress shit.\n\n39:45.800 --> 39:46.800\nI never understood it.\n\n39:46.800 --> 39:47.800\nSame thing.\n\n39:47.800 --> 39:52.360\nIt's like your monitor settings and how much your brightness is that it's the same thing.\n\n39:52.360 --> 39:53.360\nYeah, it doesn't matter.\n\n39:53.360 --> 39:58.880\nIt's not like a, well, it's also is an empirical color of the actual dress in the world, but\n\n39:58.880 --> 40:01.920\nthe picture is subject to context.\n\n40:01.920 --> 40:06.760\nI went to the most boring thing in Atlanta and I'm vegetarian and I wanted vegetarian\n\n40:06.760 --> 40:12.120\nbiscuits and gravy and they're like all of our gravies vegetarian, but they don't kind\n\n40:12.120 --> 40:13.120\nof want that out there.\n\n40:13.120 --> 40:14.120\nWhy would you get vegetarian?\n\n40:14.120 --> 40:17.280\nWe can't make biscuits and gravy without, but you can't do that.\n\n40:17.280 --> 40:18.280\nYes, you can.\n\n40:18.280 --> 40:19.280\nWell, listen up.\n\n40:19.280 --> 40:22.560\nI'll say you can't do that, Mr. Jeff.\n\n40:22.560 --> 40:28.760\nI saw a true crime show where the guy, everything came down to what was in the guy's stomach\n\n40:28.760 --> 40:34.440\nbecause if he, if he, if he had gone anywhere else since the restaurant where he supposedly\n\n40:34.440 --> 40:39.920\nhad breakfast, uh, uh, then I don't know, it's someone else killed a mother than his\n\n40:39.920 --> 40:40.920\nex-wife or whatever.\n\n40:40.920 --> 40:46.520\nBut it became very important like where he had eaten because he had onions in his stomach\n\n40:46.520 --> 40:51.640\nand he was like, he always orders that the hash browns with no onions and we don't put\n\n40:51.640 --> 40:56.440\nhash browns in our onions at the diner and like, and like the case goes cold and like,\n\n40:56.440 --> 41:01.000\nbecause, because it doesn't say onions on the menu and the hash browns and the guy said,\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:02.240\nI've been working here 10 years.\n\n41:02.240 --> 41:05.440\nI've never put onions in the hash browns and then, and then the whole thing gets resolved\n\n41:05.440 --> 41:09.400\nand what the cop is like, you know what, I'm just going to go over there and watch him\n\n41:09.400 --> 41:10.400\nmake the hash brown.\n\n41:10.400 --> 41:12.840\nSo this is like a regular kitchen at a diner.\n\n41:12.840 --> 41:16.600\nThe guy is like mixing all the fucking food together, there's onions everywhere.\n\n41:16.600 --> 41:18.560\nThere's onions on the fucking spatula.\n\n41:18.560 --> 41:19.560\nYeah.\n\n41:19.560 --> 41:20.560\nSo there was an onion in his stomach.\n\n41:20.560 --> 41:22.760\n10 years, the fucking forensic files.\n\n41:22.760 --> 41:24.040\nI don't know what it was.\n\n41:24.040 --> 41:31.040\nAll I know is that justice is, is, uh, not, it's, it's doesn't, it's, it's not, uh, helping.\n\n41:31.040 --> 41:33.960\nWell it's blind in a bad way, it turns out.\n\n41:33.960 --> 41:37.040\nThe bad guys, the bad guys get away with a lot.\n\n41:37.040 --> 41:42.480\nAnd yet I know that if I tried to commit a crime tomorrow, the same, for the same reason\n\n41:42.480 --> 41:44.520\nthat I never would, I would fail.\n\n41:44.520 --> 41:46.320\nI would get caught immediately.\n\n41:46.320 --> 41:48.320\nThat's all about dog hair.\n\n41:48.320 --> 41:51.080\nYou want to speak on that?\n\n41:51.080 --> 41:52.080\nThese days.\n\n41:52.080 --> 41:57.040\nWell, that's the thing is like, I have dog hair over, all over me all the time.\n\n41:57.040 --> 41:59.160\nI constantly have covered in dog hair.\n\n41:59.160 --> 42:00.160\nDo you have a dog?\n\n42:00.160 --> 42:01.160\nDo you have a dog?\n\n42:01.160 --> 42:02.160\nOkay.\n\n42:02.160 --> 42:03.160\nGood.\n\n42:03.160 --> 42:04.160\nAnd I don't know, most people have a dog.\n\n42:04.160 --> 42:07.760\nLike a lot of people have dogs or a cat and that seems to be like never factors in.\n\n42:07.760 --> 42:12.000\nLike if you're covered, I can't get away, I can't get the dog hair off your face.\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:15.280\nYou're wondering why you're getting it worse than, then how come everybody doesn't always\n\n42:15.280 --> 42:16.520\nhave dog hair all over them?\n\n42:16.520 --> 42:21.000\nHow come like people aren't constantly caught doing things in forensic files or cold case\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:24.760\nshows because well, this is clearly your dog's hair on you.\n\n42:24.760 --> 42:25.760\nYeah.\n\n42:25.760 --> 42:28.800\nThere's this orange dog hair found on the scene of crime and you have this orange dog\n\n42:28.800 --> 42:29.800\nor whatever.\n\n42:29.800 --> 42:30.800\nNot even, even the color.\n\n42:30.800 --> 42:32.440\nI don't know if they do DNA for dogs.\n\n42:32.440 --> 42:36.200\nIt isn't a weird, like forensic files, it's always like, and then he stepped on a hamburger\n\n42:36.200 --> 42:39.440\nbun after using his bare feet because he didn't want to get fair.\n\n42:39.440 --> 42:42.120\nThese people almost get away with it all the time.\n\n42:42.120 --> 42:43.120\nThey're the craziest people.\n\n42:43.120 --> 42:47.520\nThey're like, well, I really want to like sexually assault this person, but I didn't\n\n42:47.520 --> 42:48.520\nbring any gloves.\n\n42:48.520 --> 42:51.760\nSo I'm going to put my shoe on my head and use it as a hat and it's like, they almost\n\n42:51.760 --> 42:55.900\nget away with it, but then they like slip on a hamburger bun and then like a hamburger\n\n42:55.900 --> 43:04.120\nbun expert spends $6 million, like reconstructing his toe with an anthropologist or something.\n\n43:04.120 --> 43:08.040\nThose guys almost get away with it, which means a bunch of them do.\n\n43:08.040 --> 43:11.760\nThese forensic files are about the unlucky criminals.\n\n43:11.760 --> 43:19.120\nIf I would never commit a crime ever, like I would maybe commit the crime of elitism\n\n43:19.120 --> 43:24.880\nand like, like, like hating the poor or something, you know, like an ethical crime of like thinking\n\n43:24.880 --> 43:29.180\nI'm above other people and then I'm allowed to like, maybe I, maybe I would like dress\n\n43:29.180 --> 43:31.520\nas a woman to escape the Titanic, that kind of thing.\n\n43:31.520 --> 43:34.720\nLike I could see myself like doing something incredibly cowardly.\n\n43:34.720 --> 43:40.240\nLike, like, like if I was a soldier at war, I could see myself maybe like digging a tunnel\n\n43:40.240 --> 43:41.240\nand hiding.\n\n43:41.240 --> 43:42.240\nDeserting.\n\n43:42.240 --> 43:43.240\nYeah.\n\n43:43.240 --> 43:48.560\nLike growing a potato farm underneath the ground and waiting for the war to be over something\n\n43:48.560 --> 43:49.560\nlike that.\n\n43:49.560 --> 43:50.560\nLike a crime, like crime like that.\n\n43:50.560 --> 43:52.640\nYou would have been an instant Nazi collaborator.\n\n43:52.640 --> 43:55.680\nNo, that's not, just don't say that.\n\n43:55.680 --> 43:56.680\nThat's that.\n\n43:56.680 --> 43:58.400\nYou would have rolled over right off, right off the bat.\n\n43:58.400 --> 44:02.600\nNo, because I do, there's only, not because I'm a hero, but because there's lines I got,\n\n44:02.600 --> 44:05.880\nit's just like, I wouldn't, I would, the lazier it's hard to be.\n\n44:05.880 --> 44:10.400\nIt's like, I wouldn't, I would be like fucking kill me and kill me fast.\n\n44:10.400 --> 44:16.280\nI'm not going to fucking live a life as a fucking background actor and, uh, uh, uh,\n\n44:16.280 --> 44:17.280\nSchindler's list.\n\n44:17.280 --> 44:20.960\nLike, like, like, like, I was in Boy Scouts for six weeks and I was like, there's no\n\n44:20.960 --> 44:22.200\nbicycle rodeos here.\n\n44:22.200 --> 44:23.600\nCharlie Brown lied in that commercial.\n\n44:23.600 --> 44:26.880\nIt's fucking, that was too fascist for me.\n\n44:26.880 --> 44:28.640\nI can't fucking tow that line.\n\n44:28.640 --> 44:30.160\nI am saying you're a fascist.\n\n44:30.160 --> 44:32.880\nI'm saying that you, they would, they would have your number right off the bat.\n\n44:32.880 --> 44:33.880\nYeah.\n\n44:33.880 --> 44:34.880\nThey would kill me.\n\n44:34.880 --> 44:35.880\nLike, I would be like, just kill me.\n\n44:35.880 --> 44:37.880\nYou're Nazis and I'm never going to, I'll fuck it all up for you.\n\n44:37.880 --> 44:39.080\nThat's not how the Nazis do it.\n\n44:39.080 --> 44:41.480\nI know, but they're not going to give me anything that I'm going to want.\n\n44:41.480 --> 44:44.000\nThey might flatter you and get you to work for them.\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:45.640\nI can't imagine that happening.\n\n44:45.640 --> 44:47.440\nYou're going to get them something that they want.\n\n44:47.440 --> 44:48.440\nThey don't, they don't need any.\n\n44:48.440 --> 44:51.680\nOh, you mean I might turn in the Jews under my floorboards?\n\n44:51.680 --> 44:52.680\nCertainly.\n\n44:52.680 --> 44:59.000\nI, I, I'm not going to sit here and say, I wouldn't do that because it's tacky to assign\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:01.520\nyourself that, that, like, hero to me.\n\n45:01.520 --> 45:04.800\nI would do that, but I'd never do that, but I'm not afraid to say it.\n\n45:04.800 --> 45:09.800\nI'll, I'll, I'll tell you, I mean, that's why I was experiencing so much stress after\n\n45:09.800 --> 45:15.200\nthe election is because I do feel that in my heart of hearts that push, if push does\n\n45:15.200 --> 45:21.560\ncome to that kind of shove, some fucking like thing in me is going to take it to that place\n\n45:21.560 --> 45:26.400\nand I'm not going to, I'm going to die for those people under my floorboards because\n\n45:26.400 --> 45:30.640\nI'm, because it won't be because I'm like a good person as much as it'll be because\n\n45:30.640 --> 45:36.040\nI'm like, like, I'm just driven by anxiety and guilt and shame and like, I'll just like\n\n45:36.040 --> 45:40.400\nfucking take it all the way and I don't, I don't want to do that.\n\n45:40.400 --> 45:45.360\nSo please can we unelect this Nazi before shit gets dramatic?\n\n45:45.360 --> 45:51.080\nBut, but I also recognize that I can't say that I would have courage in the face of anything\n\n45:51.080 --> 45:52.080\nlike that.\n\n45:52.080 --> 46:00.160\nI'm a coward and because I'm a coward, like I think that I would rather die than allow\n\n46:00.160 --> 46:05.400\na Nazi to have their way, like because I'm a, I'm a chicken shit.\n\n46:05.400 --> 46:07.240\nSo I'd be like, isn't that brave?\n\n46:07.240 --> 46:09.120\nIt's, it's, it's, it's nuanced.\n\n46:09.120 --> 46:13.080\nI just think I'm so dedicated to cowardice that I'm like, we can't have, we can't have\n\n46:13.080 --> 46:14.440\nthis Nazi business going on.\n\n46:14.440 --> 46:15.440\nYou got it.\n\n46:15.440 --> 46:17.520\nYeah, I'm going to have to poison you with my tea and then I'm going to blow my brains\n\n46:17.520 --> 46:18.520\nout.\n\n46:18.520 --> 46:19.520\nThank you.\n\n46:19.520 --> 46:20.520\nMaybe if I could get close to Hitler, I'm going to eat a grenade.\n\n46:20.520 --> 46:25.360\nI think a lot of bravery is fear based as well.\n\n46:25.360 --> 46:26.360\nDifferent people.\n\n46:26.360 --> 46:28.200\nI think, I think, I think bravery is like intelligence.\n\n46:28.200 --> 46:29.320\nLike there's different kinds of it.\n\n46:29.320 --> 46:33.880\nI think there are some people who are like, well, I would never, ever, ever do what you\n\n46:33.880 --> 46:34.880\ndid.\n\n46:34.880 --> 46:40.400\nAnd it's like this thing that you consider dumb, you know, like, like, I mean, you know,\n\n46:40.400 --> 46:42.400\na lot of people have stage fright.\n\n46:42.400 --> 46:46.520\nThat's a stupid example, but I'm reading all these spy novels recently, like, like John\n\n46:46.520 --> 46:51.040\nMcCarray and stuff, and there's all this stuff that they call them, like talent spotters\n\n46:51.040 --> 46:56.160\nor like they go out and they like, oh, like I heard your podcast or I overheard you at\n\n46:56.160 --> 46:57.160\nthe bar.\n\n46:57.160 --> 47:03.880\nYou're somebody that we absolutely could use to be a mole or defect from your home country\n\n47:03.880 --> 47:05.640\nand work for us.\n\n47:05.640 --> 47:06.640\nI'm in.\n\n47:06.640 --> 47:07.640\nSure.\n\n47:07.640 --> 47:08.640\nCall life a tape.\n\n47:08.640 --> 47:12.560\nI think, I think I would have been like a good kind of low level spy.\n\n47:12.560 --> 47:16.280\nWell, I'm glad to hear you admitting that you would, yeah, they would come at you through\n\n47:16.280 --> 47:17.360\nyour fashion sense.\n\n47:17.360 --> 47:21.440\nThey would be like, because you'd be like these Nazis, they, they got pretty uniforms\n\n47:21.440 --> 47:27.160\nlike you, they value a nice shoehorn or whatever you people think about that might be how they\n\n47:27.160 --> 47:28.160\ngot you.\n\n47:28.160 --> 47:36.200\nThey'd be like, Mr. Davis, don't you do you'll not agree that these mud people have no sense\n\n47:36.200 --> 47:37.200\nof style?\n\n47:37.200 --> 47:41.520\nI'm not going to work for the Nazis because they're well dressed.\n\n47:41.520 --> 47:46.600\nBut the British or the Americans could have hired me to go infiltrate the Nazis because\n\n47:46.600 --> 47:51.560\nI could, I could pull up, obviously we would all opt to be a British spy in the, in the\n\n47:51.560 --> 47:55.720\nevent of the French spy personally, but probably easier work, right?\n\n47:55.720 --> 48:00.120\nWell, you get to be underground, you know, you get to hide and there's a lot of napping.\n\n48:00.120 --> 48:05.880\nThe reasons don't mostly Yelp reviews, that's how we took them out undermining German restaurant.\n\n48:05.880 --> 48:15.680\nSo like, I don't know if I would call this bully a base, um, stupid, acting like I know\n\n48:15.680 --> 48:18.640\nanything about it, but, but no, but I'm sorry.\n\n48:18.640 --> 48:23.720\nYeah, here's what you're saying, Jeff, because you're not conceded, just convinced you're\n\n48:23.720 --> 48:29.880\nlike, Oh, in this special episode, like, like, you know, they'll do an X files where it's\n\n48:29.880 --> 48:33.200\nlike it's a black and white episode and it's aboard the Titanic and there's Nazis and stuff\n\n48:33.200 --> 48:40.080\nlike in this special episode of our lives where there's a Nazi takeover, like you're\n\n48:40.080 --> 48:45.080\nlike, Oh, I just end up being a double agent because I'd be really, I'd be really suited\n\n48:45.080 --> 48:46.080\nto that task.\n\n48:46.080 --> 48:52.480\nLike, yeah, okay, like, it's a nice work if you can get it, but like, most of us are\n\n48:52.480 --> 48:56.800\ngoing to end up being that guy in the beginning of Inglourious Bastards, where it's like,\n\n48:56.800 --> 49:02.840\nyou have, you have your daughters and your pile of firewood and a glass of milk and you\n\n49:02.840 --> 49:04.640\ngot a fucking choice to make.\n\n49:04.640 --> 49:06.200\nAnd what was the slip up in that?\n\n49:06.200 --> 49:07.200\nI forget.\n\n49:07.200 --> 49:08.200\nHe just, he caves.\n\n49:08.200 --> 49:09.800\nHe, what do you mean?\n\n49:09.800 --> 49:10.800\nWhat's the slip up?\n\n49:10.800 --> 49:11.800\nHow did they find?\n\n49:11.800 --> 49:16.040\nHe doesn't like the Jew hunter, whatever he calls himself is like, it's, it's, it's establishing\n\n49:16.040 --> 49:22.680\nthat this guy is so, so he's so intense that, that he doesn't even need to do the shit from\n\n49:22.680 --> 49:29.080\nSchindler's list in order to get you to like his Nazism is like, so it's like a fucking\n\n49:29.080 --> 49:35.880\nDarth Vader power that like, like, like this guy that he just like insidiously and intimately\n\n49:35.880 --> 49:39.640\nlike, like weaves his brain into this guy.\n\n49:39.640 --> 49:44.200\nAnd then it's just like, just, just all you have to do is just, just move your eyes differently\n\n49:44.200 --> 49:45.640\nand we'll take care of everything.\n\n49:45.640 --> 49:46.640\nAnd the guy did that.\n\n49:46.640 --> 49:47.640\nYeah.\n\n49:47.640 --> 49:52.200\nI think I must have just gone to the bathroom or something at that part.\n\n49:52.200 --> 49:54.680\nI missed the eye movement.\n\n49:54.680 --> 50:03.000\nYeah, they say when they, from my zero knowledge of spy craft and all that jazz, when they,\n\n50:03.000 --> 50:07.640\nwhen they find timid people, like, like, if there's a spy that knows something about this.\n\n50:07.640 --> 50:09.640\nPeople who work for Disney.\n\n50:09.640 --> 50:11.640\nPeople who work for Disney are that way.\n\n50:11.640 --> 50:12.640\nShy?\n\n50:12.640 --> 50:15.040\nPeople who work for Disney, the company Disney.\n\n50:15.040 --> 50:16.240\nYeah, they find timid people.\n\n50:16.240 --> 50:20.240\nWell, yeah, pretty much everyone, if you ever go to Disneyland, everyone you'll talk to\n\n50:20.240 --> 50:22.840\nwill be very nice, but also very meek.\n\n50:22.840 --> 50:28.000\nI think it's a thing that actively seek out people who are like very like timid and meek\n\n50:28.000 --> 50:31.720\nand they make, they make great Disneyland employees.\n\n50:31.720 --> 50:32.720\nI worked there for a while.\n\n50:32.720 --> 50:33.720\nI guess you're right.\n\n50:33.720 --> 50:34.720\nYou did?\n\n50:34.720 --> 50:35.720\nYeah.\n\n50:35.720 --> 50:36.720\nBut you're hard, Jeff.\n\n50:36.720 --> 50:37.720\nHuh?\n\n50:37.720 --> 50:38.720\nYou're hard.\n\n50:38.720 --> 50:39.720\nThat was too hard.\n\n50:39.720 --> 50:40.720\nIt couldn't, it couldn't fucking do it.\n\n50:40.720 --> 50:41.720\nYeah.\n\n50:41.720 --> 50:42.720\nI mean, they had, they had a cowboy show.\n\n50:42.720 --> 50:43.920\nSo they hired you for a little bit because they're like, we need a fucking swing and\n\n50:43.920 --> 50:44.920\ndick.\n\n50:44.920 --> 50:45.920\nBut, but.\n\n50:45.920 --> 50:46.920\nDid you really work there?\n\n50:46.920 --> 50:47.920\nYeah, I did.\n\n50:47.920 --> 50:48.920\nWhen?\n\n50:48.920 --> 50:49.920\nOh, fuck.\n\n50:49.920 --> 50:50.920\nI don't know.\n\n50:50.920 --> 50:51.920\nLate nineties.\n\n50:51.920 --> 50:55.360\nWhen they were getting rid of the electric, of the main street electric parade.\n\n50:55.360 --> 50:56.360\nThey brought it back.\n\n50:56.360 --> 50:57.360\nYeah.\n\n50:57.360 --> 50:58.360\nYeah.\n\n50:58.360 --> 50:59.360\nBecause the second one sucked.\n\n50:59.360 --> 51:00.360\nThe solar parade?\n\n51:00.360 --> 51:01.360\nI mean, come on.\n\n51:01.360 --> 51:02.360\nYeah.\n\n51:02.360 --> 51:03.360\nFake news.\n\n51:03.360 --> 51:04.360\nWeek lights.\n\n51:04.360 --> 51:05.360\nYeah.\n\n51:05.360 --> 51:07.360\nI mean, what is a parade without a little bit of a footprint?\n\n51:07.360 --> 51:08.360\nYeah.\n\n51:08.360 --> 51:09.360\nIt's all feet.\n\n51:09.360 --> 51:13.760\nYou can't stand there and just photo synthesize, that's not a parade.\n\n51:13.760 --> 51:15.920\nI didn't improv on stuff on the parade route.\n\n51:15.920 --> 51:16.920\nAnd then.\n\n51:16.920 --> 51:17.920\nDid you do milk bubble throw?\n\n51:17.920 --> 51:22.920\nAnd I wrote these sketches that were on Frontierland for like a decade, but I was there for like\n\n51:22.920 --> 51:23.920\ntwo years.\n\n51:23.920 --> 51:24.920\nIt was fun.\n\n51:24.920 --> 51:25.920\nCalled him on his bubble throw.\n\n51:25.920 --> 51:26.920\nHell yeah.\n\n51:26.920 --> 51:27.920\nBubble throw.\n\n51:27.920 --> 51:28.920\nI actually.\n\n51:28.920 --> 51:29.920\nFucking roasted.\n\n51:29.920 --> 51:30.920\nI have polyps.\n\n51:30.920 --> 51:31.920\nI have a, I have a, I actually have a bubble in my throat.\n\n51:31.920 --> 51:32.920\nAll right.\n\n51:32.920 --> 51:33.920\nI wrote it.\n\n51:33.920 --> 51:34.920\nThat was different.\n\n51:34.920 --> 51:35.920\nYou had that.\n\n51:35.920 --> 51:36.920\nAnd then it stopped.\n\n51:36.920 --> 51:37.920\nThen you went back to polyp.\n\n51:37.920 --> 51:38.920\nIt was, it's, I have a polyp on my vocal fold.\n\n51:38.920 --> 51:39.920\nI agree.\n\n51:39.920 --> 51:40.920\nIt's pretty gross.\n\n51:40.920 --> 51:41.920\nI'll post a photo of it.\n\n51:41.920 --> 51:42.920\nYou're still talking and stuff.\n\n51:42.920 --> 51:43.920\nI can talk, but it's.\n\n51:43.920 --> 51:44.920\nYou're not supposed to.\n\n51:44.920 --> 51:45.920\nI can feel like a marble in me.\n\n51:45.920 --> 51:46.920\nYeah.\n\n51:46.920 --> 51:47.920\nYou don't want to.\n\n51:47.920 --> 51:51.920\nSurgery on that is very, very dangerous.\n\n51:51.920 --> 51:54.920\nCause if you, if it scars, then you never talk or sing again.\n\n51:54.920 --> 51:58.920\nI'll tell you who I'm not going to be this fucking March violets that you told me about.\n\n51:58.920 --> 52:03.920\nLike you could see shades of that happening with the, the, when Kanye lost his grip a\n\n52:03.920 --> 52:04.920\nlittle bit.\n\n52:04.920 --> 52:08.920\nAnd then, but it wasn't him that was disturbing cause he's Kanye.\n\n52:08.920 --> 52:16.640\nHe, it was, it was, it was his wife, Mrs. Kardashian, who, as she was defending her husband, rather\n\n52:16.640 --> 52:23.280\ngallantly, like she, she, part of her defense of him was like a little thematically arranged\n\n52:23.280 --> 52:30.600\naround this idea that like, um, this is, I'm paraphrasing, but I got the message from\n\n52:30.600 --> 52:34.280\nher that like, you know, a year from now, you're all going to be into this.\n\n52:34.280 --> 52:38.640\nYou know, it was like, I was like, that's exactly what we're bummed out about.\n\n52:38.640 --> 52:40.640\nLike, like, like, yeah, no shit.\n\n52:40.640 --> 52:44.640\nLike, like it's called fucking, it's called a fucking coup.\n\n52:44.640 --> 52:48.480\nLike, I, yeah, that's why we don't, we're not enjoying it.\n\n52:48.480 --> 52:50.120\nCan we have your permission to not enjoy it?\n\n52:50.120 --> 52:54.320\nLike, like, like, it's not all like, this is like the fucking cerulean blue.\n\n52:54.320 --> 52:59.280\nYeah, it's going to come down like our version of March violence would be like, like, like,\n\n52:59.280 --> 53:00.280\nyou know what that is.\n\n53:00.280 --> 53:01.520\nYou're saying violence or violence?\n\n53:01.520 --> 53:02.920\nViolence, like a flower.\n\n53:02.920 --> 53:03.920\nOkay.\n\n53:03.920 --> 53:07.080\nIt's like, it's a late blooming flower and it was what we called Nazis that joined the\n\n53:07.080 --> 53:08.080\nparty later.\n\n53:08.080 --> 53:13.920\nSo if you had a really low, people who tweeted, uh, all about get this fucking guy out of\n\n53:13.920 --> 53:19.920\nhere, they were given a little bit of a amnesty, especially the rich people, you know, a coveted\n\n53:19.920 --> 53:24.160\nthing was a very low, like early Nazi party number.\n\n53:24.160 --> 53:27.920\nAnd if you were like, had a really long, like late, later day number, you joined in the\n\n53:27.920 --> 53:28.920\nforties.\n\n53:28.920 --> 53:29.920\nIt took you long enough.\n\n53:29.920 --> 53:34.680\nHow many, how many fucking camps did we have to build before you realized that it was then\n\n53:34.680 --> 53:35.680\npeople would die.\n\n53:35.680 --> 53:39.160\nAnd there was a lot of like, like black market trading is like, can I get your like, let's\n\n53:39.160 --> 53:41.280\nkill this guy and I'm going to take his party number.\n\n53:41.280 --> 53:45.040\nSo it'll look like I joined in 1938 and not in 1944.\n\n53:45.040 --> 53:46.040\nAbsolutely.\n\n53:46.040 --> 53:47.240\nThat's exactly what's going to happen.\n\n53:47.240 --> 53:50.320\nLike it's going to, except it's going to be like services that wipe out your Twitter\n\n53:50.320 --> 53:51.320\nfeed.\n\n53:51.320 --> 53:54.640\nIt's going to be like, it's going to be like the serial number on your, on your MAGA hat.\n\n53:54.640 --> 53:56.000\nLike I got this MAGA hat.\n\n53:56.000 --> 54:00.880\nWell, the dot I was getting Johnny was that when she, when Kim Kardashian was, uh, was\n\n54:00.880 --> 54:07.080\ndefending Kanye, which I want to be sympathetic to her because obviously I think, I mean,\n\n54:07.080 --> 54:12.360\nlike, I like humanity, I think if you love your husband and blah, blah, blah, like, I\n\n54:12.360 --> 54:15.480\nknow there's a lot of, there's a lot of well intended controversy about this stuff because\n\n54:15.480 --> 54:20.000\nit comes down to, to issues that I find actually appealingly human because there are some people\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:22.880\nwho are like, Oh, is it mental health issues and all this stuff.\n\n54:22.880 --> 54:23.880\nLike it's good.\n\n54:23.880 --> 54:24.880\nLet's all have that conversation.\n\n54:24.880 --> 54:26.480\nLet's all go round and round.\n\n54:26.480 --> 54:31.920\nBut so I'm not bagging on anybody for like, for, for, for, for shouting at a throng of\n\n54:31.920 --> 54:34.640\npeasants, you know, stop judging my husband.\n\n54:34.640 --> 54:36.600\nUm, that's just bad.\n\n54:36.600 --> 54:38.120\nThat's just an expression of love.\n\n54:38.120 --> 54:41.760\nI'm not judging anybody for that.\n\n54:41.760 --> 54:46.480\nAnd nor is it like, I'm just saying that while she was doing that, there were a couple of\n\n54:46.480 --> 54:53.240\nthings that she said that kind of just like, like part of her defense of him was like,\n\n54:53.240 --> 54:56.080\nyou know, he's always been ahead of the curve.\n\n54:56.080 --> 54:59.800\nYou know that you, it's like, like, like people always make fun of him for it.\n\n54:59.800 --> 55:02.520\nYou know, it wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't all the way that, but it was like, there was\n\n55:02.520 --> 55:06.880\njust this, enough of a taste of it that it was just like, Oh, that's exactly, that's\n\n55:06.880 --> 55:10.120\nexactly what you're, what I'm afraid you're right about.\n\n55:10.120 --> 55:11.120\nShe might be right.\n\n55:11.120 --> 55:12.120\nShe might be right.\n\n55:12.120 --> 55:13.120\nOf course she might be.\n\n55:13.120 --> 55:19.560\nI mean, this is the thing you can't trust rich fucking people to lead the charge against\n\n55:19.560 --> 55:20.560\na fascist coup.\n\n55:20.560 --> 55:24.920\nThey're going to fucking flip as soon as the front stops holding, they're going to be\n\n55:24.920 --> 55:27.320\nlike, okay, how do I keep my house?\n\n55:27.320 --> 55:28.320\nYeah.\n\n55:28.320 --> 55:32.120\nI love, I love his line where he said, uh, Puppeteer, Scoopeteer.\n\n55:32.120 --> 55:33.120\nPuppeteer, Scoopeteer.\n\n55:33.120 --> 55:34.120\nYeah.\n\n55:34.120 --> 55:36.120\nWhen he said that Puppeteer, Scoopeteer, that was a dog whistle.\n\n55:36.120 --> 55:37.120\nI thought, you know what?\n\n55:37.120 --> 55:39.160\nHe makes a good point.\n\n55:39.160 --> 55:41.440\nI hadn't considered that angle.\n\n55:41.440 --> 55:44.600\nWhat he's trying to say is you should, when you see poop, you should joyfully pick it\n\n55:44.600 --> 55:45.600\nup.\n\n55:45.600 --> 55:46.600\nYou should Puppeteer, Scoopeteer.\n\n55:46.600 --> 55:47.600\nYou shouldn't be like, I have to pick up the shit.\n\n55:47.600 --> 55:50.600\nIs this something that he said in a song or is it in a recent song?\n\n55:50.600 --> 55:51.600\nYeah.\n\n55:51.600 --> 55:52.600\nHe's laid a single.\n\n55:52.600 --> 55:57.280\nThe court, this is why I think the whole Kanye thing, I think it's all sort of a publicity\n\n55:57.280 --> 55:58.280\nsmoke screen.\n\n55:58.280 --> 56:02.720\nThe smoke screen that he's trying to obfuscate the fact that he used Puppeteer, Scoopeteer\n\n56:02.720 --> 56:03.720\nin a song.\n\n56:03.720 --> 56:06.160\nI don't think that he gives a shit about Trump at all.\n\n56:06.160 --> 56:08.800\nWell, I certainly will agree with you there.\n\n56:08.800 --> 56:12.520\nI mean, there's no, there's absolutely no question that he has not a single thought\n\n56:12.520 --> 56:15.400\nin his head about, uh, foreign policy.\n\n56:15.400 --> 56:16.400\nRight.\n\n56:16.400 --> 56:20.680\nI mean, he's not, yeah, but, but that's a little different from saying that he's fucking,\n\n56:20.680 --> 56:22.560\nhe does have a, Jackman in the prestige.\n\n56:22.560 --> 56:25.720\nHe has a beef with Obama and Obama.\n\n56:25.720 --> 56:26.720\nKanye does?\n\n56:26.720 --> 56:32.000\nI mean, Trump is anti-Obama because Obama came out, it was this Obama's super West Coast.\n\n56:32.000 --> 56:33.000\nYeah.\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:38.640\nHe's like this old Scott style Chicago though, man, that's the third coast.\n\n56:38.640 --> 56:43.480\nNo, but like Obama got caught on tape by like Buzzfeed or something, like calling Kanye\n\n56:43.480 --> 56:44.560\na jackass.\n\n56:44.560 --> 56:48.640\nAnd so like, I think Kanye took it really personally being a jackass.\n\n56:48.640 --> 56:50.800\nAnd so he's like, you know, fuck you.\n\n56:50.800 --> 56:54.120\nAnd then, then he comes about saying like, what did Obama do for Chicago?\n\n56:54.120 --> 56:56.520\nAnd that's just, you know, he's just trying to be a douche.\n\n56:56.520 --> 56:57.520\nYeah.\n\n56:57.520 --> 57:00.840\nAnd so Trump is saying the same thing and he's like, yeah, this is what I'm talking about.\n\n57:00.840 --> 57:01.840\nWe hate this guy.\n\n57:01.840 --> 57:02.840\nIn his defense.\n\n57:02.840 --> 57:06.320\nIf you're ever going to take anything the president says personally, it should be him\n\n57:06.320 --> 57:07.320\ncalling you a jackass.\n\n57:07.320 --> 57:08.320\nYeah.\n\n57:08.320 --> 57:09.320\nYeah.\n\n57:09.320 --> 57:10.320\nYou should take it so personally.\n\n57:10.320 --> 57:11.320\nYou change your life.\n\n57:11.320 --> 57:13.720\nNot, you should be like the president.\n\n57:13.720 --> 57:14.720\nHe's the one that's wrong.\n\n57:14.720 --> 57:15.720\nI don't know.\n\n57:15.720 --> 57:21.200\nBut in Trump's defense, black billionaire rapper employment is way up.\n\n57:21.200 --> 57:22.200\nRight.\n\n57:22.200 --> 57:23.200\nUm, yeah.\n\n57:23.200 --> 57:24.200\nUh, anyways.\n\n57:24.200 --> 57:25.200\nNo.\n\n57:25.200 --> 57:27.240\nThat's what I was talking about.\n\n57:27.240 --> 57:33.120\nI just, I just pictured, it was like, it was like, yeah, like we're going to get desensitized\n\n57:33.120 --> 57:34.120\nthat concept too.\n\n57:34.120 --> 57:39.920\nIt's like, oh, did you hear Bruce Willis like, uh, he fucking flipped and whatever.\n\n57:39.920 --> 57:45.520\nIt's like, yeah, of course the rich people are going to flip before the people that are\n\n57:45.520 --> 57:47.560\ngoing to die in pain.\n\n57:47.560 --> 57:49.880\nI was like, Kanye said like, I don't think of America's racist.\n\n57:49.880 --> 57:54.000\nIf I thought America's racist, I'd move somewhere else, which is easy to say if you can afford\n\n57:54.000 --> 57:56.040\nto pick up and go anywhere you want.\n\n57:56.040 --> 57:58.040\nA little way into the same thing.\n\n57:58.040 --> 58:01.680\nHe left the interview with Katie Kirk years ago saying the same thing.\n\n58:01.680 --> 58:06.240\nHe's basically like, he basically said, I'm a very wealthy man and I wouldn't be wealthy\n\n58:06.240 --> 58:09.600\nif racism was that big a deal in America.\n\n58:09.600 --> 58:15.680\nAnd he, uh, says it in a way, he was like kind of calling out the black lives matter movement.\n\n58:15.680 --> 58:19.360\nHe doesn't really support it because she asked him about that.\n\n58:19.360 --> 58:21.360\nAnd, um, it's kind of a compliment.\n\n58:21.360 --> 58:22.360\nYeah.\n\n58:22.360 --> 58:27.360\nI mean, it's like, to Jeff's point, like, like, yeah, but there aren't that many jobs.\n\n58:27.360 --> 58:31.680\nI mean, yeah, it's like, it's like, I, like, I think that's part of the problem is that\n\n58:31.680 --> 58:36.240\nwe, isn't that kind of like a, yeah, it's like a, that's like a Senator John coming in\n\n58:36.240 --> 58:39.960\nfrom jogging and going like, Oh, it seems pretty cold out there today, global warming\n\n58:39.960 --> 58:40.960\nmy foot.\n\n58:40.960 --> 58:44.040\nYou know, like, yeah, it's like a, well, it's a response scale.\n\n58:44.040 --> 58:45.920\nIt's a response to experiencing racism.\n\n58:45.920 --> 58:49.760\nYou have to, you have, you experience racism or you see it somewhere and you have to make\n\n58:49.760 --> 58:56.520\ndecision either this is wrong and unjust or somehow I'm doing my thing right and other\n\n58:56.520 --> 59:00.360\npeople have just messed up and that's why I haven't failed is because it's not because\n\n59:00.360 --> 59:01.560\nI got lucky.\n\n59:01.560 --> 59:03.240\nIt was because I did something right.\n\n59:03.240 --> 59:04.240\nYeah.\n\n59:04.240 --> 59:05.240\nI think that's really important.\n\n59:05.240 --> 59:06.240\nWhite people do that too.\n\n59:06.240 --> 59:08.840\nI think that's, but I think that's important for Americans to recognize and forgive is\n\n59:08.840 --> 59:13.880\nthat because they think that's a, that's a, that's a, we don't want that to be different\n\n59:13.880 --> 59:19.360\nabout us that we, that we mythologize the idea of individual choice and that we believe\n\n59:19.360 --> 59:25.040\nin the mythology of like you, you have that your choices make you who you are.\n\n59:25.040 --> 59:27.120\nWe certainly don't want to abandon that.\n\n59:27.120 --> 59:31.320\nGod knows it's sometimes kind of relaxing to, to just, to abandon it.\n\n59:31.320 --> 59:38.000\nAnd God knows it, it does not apply so much that you, that, that your unhappiness is your\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:39.000\nown fault.\n\n59:39.000 --> 59:46.240\nBut it is nice that we go that it's like, yeah, it's like, it's like, like, like, unlike\n\n59:46.240 --> 59:52.960\nthe global warming example, if you're a rich rapper and you go, uh, well, I must have done\n\n59:52.960 --> 59:53.960\nsomething right.\n\n59:53.960 --> 59:54.960\nRight.\n\n59:54.960 --> 59:59.080\nLike, like, like, like you want that person thinking that way because you don't want them\n\n59:59.080 --> 01:00:01.720\nthinking, well, I won the lottery.\n\n01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:03.080\nI'm not talented at all.\n\n01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:05.360\nI didn't do any, I didn't make good choices.\n\n01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.360\nI shouldn't know.\n\n01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:08.600\nI'm just hanging out and doing nothing.\n\n01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:12.040\nLike we don't want, we don't want us thinking that way.\n\n01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:18.080\nWe want us to think, you know, I, I, I, I got out of bed and I did something and because\n\n01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.840\nI did it this way instead of that way.\n\n01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:20.920\nNow I'm a billionaire.\n\n01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:22.280\nWe like that mythology.\n\n01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.280\nYeah.\n\n01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:28.440\nI mean, it's nice if we fucking supported it with a middle class economy that didn't\n\n01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:33.600\nreward you for being born rich more than people get rewarded for earning money.\n\n01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.600\nRight.\n\n01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.600\nExactly.\n\n01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.600\nCause that's the thing.\n\n01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.600\nIt's like, it's not like that's not true.\n\n01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:41.040\nIt's, there's also this layer that obscures everything and makes it a bit more complicated.\n\n01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:45.920\nSo you can't say, no, that's an entirely false premise that does not exist on planet earth.\n\n01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:47.160\nIt's like, there's that.\n\n01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:51.040\nAnd there's also this thing that I was talking about, you know, that's still a factor.\n\n01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.040\nI don't know.\n\n01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.040\nIt's, it's, it's a shame because like that's an example of like somebody saying something\n\n01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.800\nincredibly provocative that's going to put them in this crossfire.\n\n01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:02.280\nBut really what they're doing is, is a little bit healthier than, than a lot of stuff because\n\n01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:04.240\nat least they're using their I statements.\n\n01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:09.040\nLike they're, they're, they're saying, well, all I know is this, you know, this is, this\n\n01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.040\nis my experience.\n\n01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:14.040\nIt gets kind of insidious because it gets into what they call, I think, respectability\n\n01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:19.080\npolitics, which is basically you have to shut up and deal with black on black crime or anything\n\n01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:23.440\nbefore you're allowed to make any political complaint, which is just a preconceived decision\n\n01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:26.280\non political argument that doesn't exist for any of the race.\n\n01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:29.960\nLike no one has ever been like, you have to solve all your problems before you can say\n\n01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.280\ntaxes should be different.\n\n01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:35.160\nYou know, it's like, it's fundamentally this thing that says you're not allowed to talk\n\n01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.160\nabout this.\n\n01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:39.440\nAnd that's what's kind of, what's insidious it was when it builds into that narrative.\n\n01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.440\nOh man.\n\n01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:41.440\nIt doesn't have to, you know.\n\n01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:42.440\nYeah.\n\n01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:43.440\nThat's so fucked up.\n\n01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:44.440\nRight.\n\n01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.440\nYeah.\n\n01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.640\nWe go, we go like, oh, if, if somebody talks about the wealth distribution and they're\n\n01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:51.440\nrich and you go like, oh, you're rich, so you can't talk about it.\n\n01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.440\nYeah.\n\n01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:53.440\nDon't you, why not?\n\n01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:54.440\nYou should give all your money away then.\n\n01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:55.440\nIsn't that a logical fallacy though?\n\n01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:58.880\nWhat's that called when you talk about the straw man thing?\n\n01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:03.040\nWhat's the call when you talk about like, oh, this is so bad, but, you know, but this\n\n01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.040\nis worse.\n\n01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.040\nFalse equivalence.\n\n01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.040\nFalse equivalence.\n\n01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:07.040\nI could add.\n\n01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.040\nHow many of them?\n\n01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.040\nThat's a personal attack.\n\n01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.040\nIt's kind of like a straw man.\n\n01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:12.040\nYou're a hawk, proper hawk.\n\n01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:13.040\nYeah.\n\n01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.040\nIf this, therefore that or something.\n\n01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:16.240\nWell, that's cause it doesn't fall.\n\n01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.240\nI mean, I don't know.\n\n01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:19.120\nIt's one of them.\n\n01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:23.040\nBecause it's like saying, it's saying you're wrong because you're not adhering to this,\n\n01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.360\nmy heightened version of it that you never said.\n\n01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.840\nSo it's kind of straw manning.\n\n01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:31.480\nWell, as they see it, they see it play out because like if a, if a, if an oligarch says\n\n01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:36.840\nsomething like, I don't see why we're spending tax money repairing these potholes on Martin\n\n01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:41.200\nLuther King Boulevard, then somebody might shame them by going, you don't live in that\n\n01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:45.960\nneighborhood or I'm running for senator of this district and they got like, you've never,\n\n01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:50.040\nyou were born in this place and it's like that, that gets successfully and rightfully\n\n01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.560\nused against like the bad guys sometimes.\n\n01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:56.960\nAnd then, but then someone goes, I think prison reform should be a thing.\n\n01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:59.440\nAnd then someone goes like, you haven't been to prison.\n\n01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.440\nRight.\n\n01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:03.200\nWell, yeah, I don't want to wait until I get there.\n\n01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.200\nYou fuck.\n\n01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.200\nYeah.\n\n01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.200\nExactly.\n\n01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:10.680\nAnd the thing is like so much that's precedent at our politics is like trying to entertain\n\n01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:16.160\nthese bad faith like obstacles to even being allowed to talk politically.\n\n01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.680\nIt's like, you have to clear all these hurdles before they'll even let you speak.\n\n01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:23.520\nAnd it's like, well, no, that's not, that's not how it works, but you have to choose to\n\n01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:26.280\nlike cut through it rather than like play by those rules.\n\n01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.080\nAnd so it gets all fucked up.\n\n01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:32.520\nI think then it would be more Greyhound stations and rich neighborhoods.\n\n01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:33.520\nThat could be big.\n\n01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.520\nThat'd be great.\n\n01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:35.520\nYeah.\n\n01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:36.520\nI would agree with that.\n\n01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:39.000\nAnd Bel Air, because that's how that fire started.\n\n01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.400\nFire started from a homeless encampment.\n\n01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.400\nYeah.\n\n01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.400\nI saw this.\n\n01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.400\nMore of that.\n\n01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:49.320\nI saw this guy, this story about this guy who like, he was this judge, this New York\n\n01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:56.320\nchief judge who spent like half his lifetime like haranguing this woman who he was the,\n\n01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:00.960\nhe was in charge of her trust and because he, and he was like, he's doing this whole fucked\n\n01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:01.960\nup weird thing.\n\n01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.760\nHe was like stalking her and fucking with her and all that stuff.\n\n01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.280\nAnd then he got busted doing it.\n\n01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:10.960\nAnd then he went to prison, but he wrote a book while he was in prison about how crazy\n\n01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:14.400\nit is to be a judge that gets caught being a fucking criminal.\n\n01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:19.720\nAnd then, so then when he got out of prison, he was the best selling author and then they,\n\n01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:25.680\nthey welcomed him back into the, the, the, you know, whatever the fuck he could still\n\n01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:29.320\nhang out at the country club and all this stuff and he, and the, the woman's life was\n\n01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:33.800\nruined and stuff, but like, and then they played a clip of him being on Larry King or\n\n01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:34.800\nsomething.\n\n01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:35.800\nAnd he, uh, after prison.\n\n01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:36.800\nYeah.\n\n01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:37.800\nAfter all of this.\n\n01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.480\nAnd now he was, he's on his victory lap, like, like making his millions on his book about\n\n01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:45.800\nhow, how much he's, you know, learned about how not to get killed in prison or it's,\n\n01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:49.840\nor it's like, you know, meditations on how, how nutty it is to be a judge and then be in\n\n01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:54.840\nprison and then be a best selling author, like by me and, and, uh, I wrote a book called\n\n01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:57.480\nhow to, uh, learn how to make a prison belt.\n\n01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:01.920\nAnd Larry, Larry King goes like, it's in the clip, Larry King's guy and like, now you,\n\n01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:06.960\nuh, I can't do a Larry King impression, but you know, so you, but you, you did, you did\n\n01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:07.960\nterrible things.\n\n01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:12.880\nYou, you, you did them, you, you, you, you, you ruined this woman's life and they guys,\n\n01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:13.880\noh yeah.\n\n01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:14.880\nNo, absolutely.\n\n01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.640\nI mean, it's what I did.\n\n01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.840\nThere's no, there's no excuse for it.\n\n01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:24.880\nYou know, you, you find yourself, um, doing this thing and you, you, you, you, you do\n\n01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:26.160\nthis and then you do that.\n\n01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.160\nYou do that.\n\n01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:30.840\nAnd like, because I've been in therapy, I'm like, ah, he's a fucking, like, like, like\n\n01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:36.320\nthat, that you thing, no, that royal you, it's, it's like, it's like, I do that all\n\n01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:37.320\nthe time.\n\n01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:38.320\nHe's taken it away from himself.\n\n01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:39.320\nYeah.\n\n01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:42.400\nIt's, it's, it's like, it's like compulsive and I know that seems like a non sequitur,\n\n01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:45.960\nbut it's like, it's kind of like what we're doing when we talk about politics.\n\n01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:52.760\nLike we, we're constantly like tap dancing between like, we don't want intimacy.\n\n01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:54.240\nWe don't want to just be vulnerable.\n\n01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.240\nRight.\n\n01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:59.880\nAnd we end up saying something that's, that's not very fashionable and actually gets tomatoes\n\n01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:00.880\nthrown at us.\n\n01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.960\nLike, well, I'm a rich black baseball player.\n\n01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.000\nSo America been very good to me.\n\n01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:11.160\nYou know, like Bill Garrett Morris bit or whatever, like Sammy, so Sammy, so the, the, the, like,\n\n01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:19.000\nthe, like you don't, so we have to like you, like we, like we're constantly like as, as\n\n01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:24.280\nprimates, like we, we, we feel like we can't just go through life actually just expressing\n\n01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:30.800\nourselves because we'll, we'll then we'll get, we'll get beaten up for being like just\n\n01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:36.240\nkind of like, I don't know what we'll call that narcissism or tunnel vision or selfishness.\n\n01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:41.400\nBut like, so you, you get rewarded over time for like talking about how the world should\n\n01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:44.560\nbe or what the world's feeling or because that's empathy.\n\n01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:48.400\nOh, I know how that person feels about stuff, but then that turns into this whole different\n\n01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:51.840\nkind of like a total pandering.\n\n01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:52.840\nYeah.\n\n01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:56.760\nIt's just association, like you're still a sociopath because now you're talking about\n\n01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:59.120\neveryone but yourself.\n\n01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:00.960\nYou're not selfless by doing that.\n\n01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:06.920\nYou can be a fucking horrible like person that's just like, Oh, I'm certainly I'm not\n\n01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:10.000\ngoing to sit in my own skin during this conversation.\n\n01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.080\nI'm going to be everyone else in the world, which is what politicians are really good\n\n01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:15.080\nat.\n\n01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.080\nLike that's all they do.\n\n01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:19.560\nMan, what do you need?\n\n01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:20.560\nHoly shit.\n\n01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.560\nOh shut up.\n\n01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.920\nWhy don't you make a golem?\n\n01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:24.920\nIt's crazy, man.\n\n01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:30.040\nI wanted to learn about it because it is this weird quintessentially Jewish mythology that's\n\n01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.480\nalso like a dragon.\n\n01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:36.320\nIt's like, what if like there was like this famous Muslim Pegasus or like, you know, a\n\n01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.720\nfamous Sphinx or something.\n\n01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:38.720\nIt's just really weird.\n\n01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:41.000\nThe famous Catholic leprechaun.\n\n01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.160\nA Catholic leprechaun.\n\n01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.160\nYeah.\n\n01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:48.560\nThe Catholic, the giant leprechaun of, of, of Saint James Cathedral.\n\n01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:49.560\nThere are Catholic giants.\n\n01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:52.560\nThere's a giant dick in Catholic zombies.\n\n01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:53.560\nNow, what?\n\n01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:54.560\nThey're famed.\n\n01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:58.560\nI'm going to send an Irish golem after them.\n\n01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:05.560\nI am at your command, begosh and begora.\n\n01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:06.560\nWhat do you need, man?\n\n01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:08.760\nGo slay my enemies.\n\n01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:14.320\nI will do that big top of the morning.\n\n01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:19.520\nI find it, I find the only racist part of the great Irish leprechaun is that you're\n\n01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:25.160\nin Saint James Cathedral is that he's famous for sucking his own dick, but not famous for\n\n01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.640\nbeing a giant leprechaun.\n\n01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:30.320\nWell, a lot of people say he's a normal person.\n\n01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:31.320\nRight.\n\n01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:32.320\nOkay.\n\n01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:33.320\nYeah.\n\n01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:34.320\nOh, so he's the, he's the world's tallest giant.\n\n01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:35.320\nA lot of people accuse him of being a five foot 11.\n\n01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:37.080\nSo he might just be a guy that sucks his own dick.\n\n01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:40.320\nHe's five 11, but so is his dick.\n\n01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:41.880\nIt's a big old ripping rope.\n\n01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:47.200\nYou know, by the way, as far as Jewish mythology, the listeners to our podcast will know that\n\n01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:53.720\nthe Jewish community created another, a modern myth called Superman, two Jewish kids created\n\n01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:54.720\nSuperman.\n\n01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:55.720\nOh yeah.\n\n01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:56.720\nThey're always making stuff.\n\n01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:03.520\nThose Jews, they pronounced it Superman, Superman, Superman was the original pronunciation\n\n01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:09.640\nwith Superman, Spider-man, Superman, Clark, it's so it's, I think it's a follow-up, Tom\n\n01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:10.640\ncan spit.\n\n01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:11.640\nI know, but it's still so funny.\n\n01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:16.680\nI mean, it's also probably beyond that, but it's like, it really is funny to say Superman.\n\n01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:21.280\nAnytime you have like a man word that you can say like with the men instead, it's always\n\n01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:22.280\nfun.\n\n01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:29.600\nLike that was the one there, the, the Goy editor at DC Comics was like, boys, look, I love\n\n01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:30.600\nSuperman.\n\n01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:31.600\nCan we make it two words?\n\n01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:37.480\nCan we, but could we just, I, you know, could we just, I don't want to, it was a very touchy\n\n01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:38.480\ntime.\n\n01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.480\nIt's the 1930s.\n\n01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:40.480\nI don't want to go there.\n\n01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:42.400\nI don't want to compromise you.\n\n01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.680\nCould we just pronounce it different?\n\n01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:45.680\nSuperman.\n\n01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.680\nSuperman.\n\n01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:51.160\nOh, and then the two brothers are like out in the sidewalk cause like they're, it divides\n\n01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:52.160\nthem down the middle.\n\n01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:58.160\nIt's like, this is for our fucking uncle, you don't call it Iceberg.\n\n01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.160\nYeah.\n\n01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:00.160\nSuperman.\n\n01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.160\nIt's a burger.\n\n01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:02.160\nIt's for our uncle.\n\n01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:09.560\nAnd the other brother is like, we take this one thing and then we have the first Jewish\n\n01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:12.360\ncharacter in popular culture.\n\n01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.360\nPick your battles.\n\n01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.360\nPick your battles.\n\n01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:15.360\nIt's a Trojan horse.\n\n01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:17.080\nHe, he wears a Jewish cape.\n\n01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:19.040\nHe has Jewish X-ray vision.\n\n01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:22.360\nHe's from, he's from space Israel.\n\n01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:27.720\nThe only way you can beat him is by digging up a chunk of it and he's got, he's got to\n\n01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:28.720\nput him.\n\n01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:31.120\nHe's got, he's got to put him.\n\n01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:32.120\nHe's got those.\n\n01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:33.120\nHe come from the planet.\n\n01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.120\nPut him.\n\n01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:35.120\nRight.\n\n01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.120\nWhat was it?\n\n01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:37.120\nWhat was his planet?\n\n01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:38.120\nKrypton.\n\n01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:39.120\nWhat was it?\n\n01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.120\nYou forgot.\n\n01:10:40.120 -->

01:10:58.480\nIt sounds very Hebrew.\n\n01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.480\nKlarkin.\n\n01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.480\nOh yeah?\n\n01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:04.040\nAnd he has a weakness to Afi-Koeman.\n\n01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.400\nYou know what Kal-El means in Hebrew?\n\n01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:08.000\nUh, check please.\n\n01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:14.640\nHe's just doing jokes that sound like Jewish jokes.\n\n01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:18.560\nlike I don't even know they're probably incredibly means I get enough I get\n\n01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:23.380\nenough aggravation it means

have a dog when I was in New York as a kid that dog loved to eat\n\n01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:51.940\nhorseshit just we just eat it like it was just dogs love horseshit you know eat\n\n01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:55.540\njust just couldn't get enough horseshit my dog grew up on horseshit yeah yeah\n\n01:15:55.540 --> 01:16:00.980\nthat's why his coat was so shiny she grew up on a horseshit farm that's the\n\n01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:06.540\nsecret that you know dogs have a secret and that's redefined success yeah like\n\n01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:11.260\nthey horseshit they're like fuck yeah I'm nailing it there's grass in here he\n\n01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:16.060\ndidn't finish this elephants and like a lot of herbivores go back and eat their\n\n01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:19.940\nown poop because like we kind of digested none of that right my stomachs\n\n01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:25.700\naren't made to really well cellulose hard to break down vegetative soul wall is\n\n01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:30.860\neating almost impossible to digest animals that have developed to graze\n\n01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:35.540\nhave intensely crazy labyrinthine digestive systems that are capable of\n\n01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:39.220\nsomewhat breaking down grass because they're like imagine that's like being\n\n01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:44.060\nable to desalinate ocean water it'd be like if you could do it all of our\n\n01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:47.580\nproblems are over but it's really fucking hard to do it and meanwhile tigers\n\n01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:51.300\nare like why don't you just grow claws and eat you well because we can all eat\n\n01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:54.220\nme you can drink a little of your own pee if you're really thirsty and it doesn't\n\n01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:59.020\nfuck you up but then they shit bricks of hay basically because you can even if\n\n01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:05.460\nyou're a fucking elephant with all of the good if we eat grass we would probably\n\n01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:09.900\nwe would poop just grass it would just be grass and like whatever we should try\n\n01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:13.060\nit like a Philly cheesesteak physical challenge what would that look like if\n\n01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:17.940\nhumans just ate that much grass you'd be I think we would just we would do we\n\n01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:22.300\nwould we would starve to death because we would be like we can't even break down\n\n01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:29.460\nthe cellulose cellulose in grass like like like like grazing plants like we\n\n01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:35.860\ncan eat a carrot but we can't eat grass because it's just it grass is just made\n\n01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:40.420\nout of fucking Kevlar like like like like the amount of like shit that it takes\n\n01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:46.660\nto turn that into food it's not worth it yeah and so when they poop it's like it's\n\n01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:50.740\na bunch of grass and that's why and then the elephant next to you goes like what\n\n01:17:50.740 --> 01:17:54.940\ndo you what are you doing yeah and I was like well I'm shitting it because I have\n\n01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:58.020\nto I was

giraffes drink piss you'll find this is also true there's at least seven\n\n01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:34.980\nvideos of people freaking the fuck out because they think that they're the\n\n01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:38.060\nfirst and last person to ever see an elephant reach its trunk up another\n\n01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:42.940\nelephant's asshole pull a turd out and eat it they're they're justifiably very\n\n01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:47.700\nexcited they're like the word Bob Saget has never been exclaimed so many times\n\n01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:52.260\nbut but but the jokes on them because they're

is the last time we're not gonna be in front of people yeah man this is the\n\n01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:05.660\nend of our isolation yeah come back when it's in front of people yeah it'll be\n\n01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:09.700\nbetter but more importantly what should we do before that we can't do in front\n\n01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:14.620\nof people oh shit um I should have brought my Minecraft laptop let's sew\n\n01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:23.940\nourselves ass to mouth oh wow we'll see that's significant what is it like who\n\n01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:31.300\nif we're all gonna do that who sews what's the workflow on us sewing\n\n01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:35.820\nourselves ass to mouth with each other well you're you're you're a centipede\n\n01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:39.780\nsyndicalist you believe that that it should be worked into the centipede I\n\n01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:47.780\ndon't believe in mutual I mean yeah I'm more of a reciprocity based how about\n\n01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:51.980\nmagnets no I but I believe that there should always be a doctor in order for\n\n01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:56.180\nthere to be a centipede you could do it as a lot you could put electromagnets in\n\n01:31:56.180 --> 01:32:01.220\nour mouths and then the other side of the electromagnetic on a butt and then\n\n01:32:01.220 --> 01:32:04.660\nyou could then you just have everyone has control of the switch so if you want\n\n01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:10.740\nto a lot of people would say Jeff that if it's not sewn it's not a centipede\n\n01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:14.420\nbecause it's like we aren't we already don't we already have the option of\n\n01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:17.500\nputting our lips on each other's but holes and eating all the poop from each\n\n01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:21.940\nother's butts I'm saying the control of the switch like it switches around I\n\n01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:29.020\nlike you can have control for like eight hours it's a liberal fantasy you know\n\n01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:40.260\nyou got to choose do you want my lips in your ass full okay I'm listening\n\n01:32:40.260 --> 01:32:47.140\nhave I got your attention I'm all I'm all ears and then it's my turn to have\n\n01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:52.580\nyour mouth sewn to my butt I can't sew that so yeah that's I'm saying you need\n\n01:32:52.580 --> 01:33:00.020\na doctor Pemberton so is my your mouth to my butt we got Spencer's left right\n\n01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:05.020\nbut now we have you know we got both of you left I don't think that the doctors\n\n01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:10.340\nSpencer shows Pemberton's mouth to my butt mm-hmm at the very end when it's\n\n01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:15.420\ntime for Spencer's mouth to be sewn to a butt and mouth and butt to a mouth we're\n\n01:33:15.420 --> 01:33:19.820\ngonna have to all get into kind of like circle the wagons yeah and so we're\n\n01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:24.900\ngonna they're gonna get into a circle and that's because at that point we'll\n\n01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:29.140\nbe able to form a human wheel and roll at high speeds that's where the term\n\n01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:33.020\nsewing circle comes from right I you do raise an interesting point about the\n\n01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:37.420\nhuman centipede mythos I've watched all three of those movies and I and I cannot\n\n01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:45.540\npin the characters or the director down and whether or not he thinks that having\n\n01:33:45.540 --> 01:33:50.300\nyour lips sewn to another person's butt is a good thing or a bad I don't I don't\n\n01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:54.940\nunderstand how it works they what you don't you understand because I mean you\n\n01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:59.140\nwould just do the question that poop is not food is that your problem no no no\n\n01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:02.460\nit's not that at all it's more like imagine your lips being sewed to someone\n\n01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:07.100\nelse's asshole right yeah right you're gonna lose the ability to use your\n\n01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:11.460\nyour mandible right so it's like if someone shits like a giant log you're\n\n01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:18.140\nfucking in soft your nose well you gotta hope you're gonna have to you\n\n01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:22.820\ngotta start furiously furiously swallowing that poop well I thought

the truth yeah you\n\n01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:33.940\nwill just ask me that's the important question what's more important to you\n\n01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:37.060\nripping off the front of your face or eating some of that delicious I suspended\n\n01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:40.980\nmy disbelief on the lip stuff but if someone's taking a giant turd in your\n\n01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:46.980\nmouth you can't

there's gonna be a fucking audience because we just burnt\n\n01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:47.140\nup our last delicious taste of no audience I think he is born in front of\n\n01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:51.020\nan audience I think he's a born performer what do we do what's the\n\n01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:56.460\nlab we're never gonna be in total silence in a dark empty warehouse ever\n\n01:40:56.460 --> 01:41:00.060\nagain what what's the thing you always wanted to do Spencer already pitched\n\n01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:04.700\nasked a man centipede yeah Dan you should say all those things that you don't\n\n01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:08.260\nlike saying in front of an audience because they'll make weird sounds right\n\n01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:21.980\nokay race oh wait no I'm making the sounds 85% of everyone is stupid and\n\n01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:28.700\nthat actually does include 85% of whatever group you belong to believe me\n\n01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:45.020\nI've met you I'm stupid oh maybe 85 chance four of us are I don't like okay\n\n01:41:45.020 --> 01:41:50.060\nhere's a good one I just get to get this out before we have an audience I\n\n01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:55.180\nrecognize it as a well-executed movie compared to the Sony versions I think\n\n01:41:55.180 --> 01:42:01.140\nit's a waste of Spider-Man to just turn him into a AI suit with Tony Stark just\n\n01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:08.860\nproviding him with a Spider-Man suit what's this yeah the new Spider-Man is\n\n01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:13.700\nthat it's like I have he gets a new suit from Tony Stark and it's like this suit\n\n01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:19.380\nis like talking to him like Jarvis and I like that I get the complaints the thing\n\n01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:24.420\nis like in the story of like Civil War and everything that did happen but it's\n\n01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:28.420\nlike that's not like a quintessential Spider-Man story it's not like a reboot\n\n01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:32.660\nSpider-Man story it's like this very like that's like the seventh Spider-Man\n\n01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:36.380\nmovie can be about oh now he has a Spider-Man AI suit it's kind of an\n\n01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:40.380\ninteresting choice for you know for what's essentially like a reboot like\n\n01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:46.540\nsetting off the it's weird yeah did you like that in a quiet place did we talk\n\n01:42:46.540 --> 01:42:51.420\nabout this I haven't seen it and I won't watch it and here's why I don't like\n\n01:42:51.420 --> 01:42:58.260\ndeaf people movies now I'm kidding I I'm just trying to think of like the things\n\n01:42:58.260 --> 01:43:05.460\nto say before an audience comes back I can't talk about Atlanta I haven't\n\n01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:12.740\nwatched Atlanta how about dead cool that's that's that's all I keep saying\n\n01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:20.780\nis having watched Atlanta devil to his very meta it's enjoyable meta how

that's a normally healthy\n\n01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:58.460\nthing that's a normally healthy thing but but for me it's like you know carbs\n\n01:49:58.460 --> 01:50:02.100\nare normally healthy for some people but like I have to be on a diet that like\n\n01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:10.940\nyeah well you don't have to know okay I have to know yeah yeah you what you know\n\n01:50:10.940 -->

happy\n\n01:50:20.420 --> 01:50:26.180\nthere won't be negative repercussions because I was satisfied with myself or\n\n01:50:26.180 --> 01:50:31.900\nmy work or my life or anything was good enough like there is no punishment from\n\n01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:36.940\nthe universe for me being okay with the way the day is going and there there's\n\n01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:42.180\nno there's no reason for me to check in and make sure that's okay with you\n\n01:50:42.180 --> 01:50:45.460\nthat's something that everybody else needs to do because they're fucking\n\n01:50:45.460 --> 01:50:51.140\nstupid and they need to grow and be better people I have become God where\n\n01:50:51.140 --> 01:50:55.100\ndoes poverty come into the story you're more mad about because my money is a\n\n01:50:55.100 --> 01:50:58.780\ndirect measure of my worth as a person my accomplice I don't know what are you\n\n01:50:58.780 --> 01:51:02.660\ntalking about you're more mad at stupid people than than whether they have money\n\n01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:07.660\nin the bank I right I don't I don't know what what you just did a giant rant\n\n01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:11.220\nabout your poor people poor people or animals I don't know if I did a giant\n\n01:51:11.220 --> 01:51:16.460\nrant about anything for that's your subjective what I what I said was if\n\n01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:20.420\nyou're an Instagram and I tell you to go fuck yourself and one of the things I\n\n01:51:20.420 --> 01:51:24.980\ntell you that is a reason why you shouldn't be telling me what to do is\n\n01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:29.420\nbecause your dumb ass is broke in addition to you being anonymous living\n\n01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:33.340\nwith your parents having accomplished nothing having a life half the length\n\n01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:38.460\nof mine not making anyone happy and not following me and you're following me\n\n01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:42.140\ninstead of I'm following you there's a million reasons why if you really think\n\n01:51:42.140 --> 01:51:47.060\nabout it it's fucking dumb for you to ever open your mouth around me like like\n\n01:51:47.060 --> 01:51:52.340\nyou don't have to then you're not gonna get away with saying to me oh that makes\n\n01:51:52.340 --> 01:51:59.700\nyou a lannister because it doesn't like like you're a you're a fucking idiot and\n\n01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:06.620\na gross little dirty filthy piglet and being broke as a part of that because\n\n01:52:06.620 --> 01:52:10.780\nbecause because there's not a lot of rich people doing it like like getting\n\n01:52:10.780 --> 01:52:14.100\nit watching me take a shower and my Instagram feed and telling me that I\n\n01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:21.020\nneed to get my shoulders like to do the hair or whatever there's not a lot of\n\n01:52:21.020 --> 01:52:24.340\nrich people doing that maybe maybe that's the connection I don't know James\n\n01:52:24.340 --> 01:52:30.500\nWoods James Woods is in my Instagram telling me to get hair removal he's a\n\n01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:37.700\ntroll oh he's a big-time troll you're 15 you're poor your parents are they\n\n01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:45.780\nfucked up
