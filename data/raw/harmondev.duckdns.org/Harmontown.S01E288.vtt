WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I love you, that's why I'm here today.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
The beautiful uptown Burbank.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
Harmontowns.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
Session.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
May 28, 2018.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
It doesn't have shingles.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
It's still sweet.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
It ain't come clean.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
And there's nothing love adjusts.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
And you'll tell me you say I don't feel so good.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
You know you be like, oh, lie down.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
I'm from Snuggletown, USA.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
The mayor.

00:21.000 --> 00:35.000
Harmontowns, and I'm a hip hop, a room to the mob.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
So clean your mother's pussy until I hit the top of the engineering industry.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
I'm a custodian.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Don't cause me misery.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
I started at the bottom.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
Now I'm going to the top because of the aforementioned mob.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
I'm going to fuck your mama and rap.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
All right.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Yeah.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
It's good.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
All right.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Stop it.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Stop the goddamn music.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
It's already got someone rapping on it.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
That's Rob Tanchum, everybody.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
Our friend Rob with background vocals by our own church.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Whoa.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Yeah.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
When's that coming out, that album?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Soon, right?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Church, you know?

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Tonight.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
Get it at Best Buy.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
That's something to look forward to.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
It's good stuff.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
It's about his own maniac, high anxieties, and weird catechesis.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
And it's beautifully written and wonderfully done.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I watched you record a piece on it.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
It was very good.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Yeah.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
That's fun.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
He worked very hard on that.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
I guess you're not probably not.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
No, you are supposed to tell people you worked hard on your rap album.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Rappers work hard on their albums.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Yeah.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Yeah, he worked very hard on it.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
He took it very seriously.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
And I think it's very impressive.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
He had to kind of be talked into doing it because he's like,

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
I don't want to do a white guy comedy rap album.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
He's right to have those anxieties.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
But the truth is, he's so good.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Like, I was like, just do it.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Like, yeah, you're right.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
It's objectively on paper.

02:11.000 --> 02:19.000
It's a corny concept, but so is jumping over a high pole at the Olympics.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
It's like, oh, I'm going to do that again.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Like, yeah, just do it.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
How do you pick pole vaults?

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
How do you go like, that's my shit.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Yeah, I don't know.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
It's weird, isn't it?

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
Because they're jumping, but they're doing it with a big stick.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Sometimes it snaps in half.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
And what you have is a giant knife, like two fiberglass knives in your hand

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
that can just impale you through your abdomen.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Coming and going.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
I mean, let's face it, really.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
What Olympic activities do we even approve of?

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Like, maybe like running.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Running's good.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Swimming, I guess.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
No, swimming.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
You don't have, there's never a cause in life to swim fast.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Yeah, let's not compete.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
You're not going to have to swim a shark.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
If you're swimming, we should do it as a team.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Like, not competitive.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
What causes in life, or is it about this idea?

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
This is what I could never figure out.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
This is the Olympic rhetoric that I never understood.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
It's this idea of like, oh, it's about nations coming together,

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
but then it's also at the exact same times,

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
it's about nations coming together.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
It's about proving which country can be better,

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
and about the potential of the human potential.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
It's kind of how quickly you can bankrupt a city or a country

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
by building a bunch of stadia that are never going to be used again.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
I just, I mean, what if you drafted your team in the Olympics?

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Like, you got all the skiers, and then like,

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
you had to like, you know, each country got to like,

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
get like everyone else's.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
You know, I love is the biathlon in the Winter Olympics,

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
where they ski and shoot, because that's some real shit.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
Well, that's what calls into question the whole endeavor

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
of Olympics, because it's like, why not fucking chess

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
if you can ski and shoot as like a sport?

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
If you were a Scandinavian, like, homeless person with a gun,

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
like, you need to be able to ski around, not die,

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
and then kill your food and carry your gun on your back,

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
like, that's like some hunting.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Yeah, I mean, I think the Olympics are a little silly

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
at this point, right?

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
I think the only sport that really comes in handy in day-to-day life

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
is water polo.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Water polo is fun, because you try to kill other people

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
for most of the game.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
I keep finding myself in situations where I'm in my

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
underwear with a little cap on my head.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Right.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
And you want to hold a ball up your head?

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
I want to throw a ball through a small net,

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
but there's never anybody else there to pass it to.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Right.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
That's what satisfies me about water polo.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
My driver, not tonight's driver, but that's whoever

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
my previous driver was, because it brings up the thing,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
it says, what did you think about so-and-so?

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
I believe my last driver's, because I just clicked through,

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
but I think my last driver's name was Usola.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
How do you spell that?

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
U-S-H-O-L-A, Usola.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
I tipped him $20, because I was like, this guy's life is a mess.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
You can be a famous baseball player named Poo-Holes,

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
and you're fine.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Yeah.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
You've got to get good at something.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Yep, yep.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
He's using his name.

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
I went to the, I went to the, I'll talk about that later

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
probably.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
That's too, that's too, too, too thick.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Too thick, too thick a cut of beef for the beginning.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Not for the uninitiated.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Need something lighter.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
I was walking down the road today and I saw a guy that

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
looked so much like Spencer.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
I was, I almost went up to him and said, are you trying?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Like, are you a big fan?

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
Because it looked like somebody who had dedicated efforts

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
to look like Spencer.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Where was he?

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
He was walking into like a juice place.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Oh, yeah, that's not me.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Yeah, that's not you.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
You should have set him straight.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
If he wants to really pull off the Spencer thing,

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
he don't walk into the juice place.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
No.

06:06.000 --> 06:13.000
I started watching this new true crime show called Cold Justice,

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
and it's like a very unusual show because it's,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
we're all familiar with cold cases now,

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
the appeal of those.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Well, this crime hasn't been solved yet.

06:21.000 --> 06:28.000
It's these two women and they go from town to town.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
The whole thing has this very uplifting mood to it because

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
these women come to your town and solve your cold case for you.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Sure.

06:40.000 --> 06:46.000
So the way it's edited, it's just like, it's just on this side

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
of like, it just feels more like a home improvement show.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Like the music and the editing of it are like,

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
so they roll in and they're like, they're like,

06:56.000 --> 07:02.000
so Tiffany Johnson got sexually assaulted and murdered 10 years

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
ago and they can't figure out how it is.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Here's the police that couldn't figure out how it was.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Hi, how are you?

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
And then they go to the family who have been unable to have

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
closure for 10 years and they chat with them,

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
but they're very upbeat and they're like,

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
they're doing bits not in front of the family,

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
but it's like, the family's going to watch the show.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
So then there's like, it has like this,

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
they try to create this little feeling of camaraderie because

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
they're working with the cops and they're like,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
hey, we're driving to the penitentiary.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
We're going to talk to Ringo.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Anything you guys wanted to say to us?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Yeah.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
That's a big 10-4.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
If you could just get him to say that he killed Tiffany Johnson,

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
that would be great.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Get him to say he murdered and raped her.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
I mean, that's what we want.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
And they're like, yeah, I wish.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Do they always get their man?

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Yeah, they do.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
They apparently do.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
So then they go to the, and then the music kind of gets

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
kind of lilting and they come back, you know,

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
they structure it.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
So it's like you check in with the grieved family members.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
And so then at the end, it's like, it just feels very much

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
like one of those shows where we remodel your kitchen.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
They keep coming back and going, guess who murdered your

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
daughter 10 years ago?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
It was the mailman.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
You were right.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
You were right.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
No, I knew it.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
I knew it.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
You know how the criminal justice system said it wasn't the

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
mailman, but you did?

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Well, you were right.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
You know, I thought it was amazing.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
I mean, it's a good show, but it really was tasteless when

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
they were like, you know, we're about to reveal the killer,

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
move that truck.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
And then he's like, the killer's behind a truck.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Which show is that?

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Is it called Move That Truck?

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
No, it's a great joke and everyone loved it.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
I watched a new show called, it's about cold cases too,

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
but they make it look real sexy by the end of it.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
It's called Pimp My Cold Case.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
They put an aquarium in someone's coffin.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Yeah.

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
And at the end of it, you're the boss of Cupcakes.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
Wait a second, Harmon.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Every time.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
I'll wait an hour and a half.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Every time they come on the show, they solve a case.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Why aren't they the most famous detectives in the world?

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
I don't think these cases are all that cold.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
I think it feels to me like, basically, they're just taking

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
the budget and time that a television show affords

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
that a municipal government doesn't afford its victims

09:27.000 --> 09:34.000
because it costs $500,000 and 48 hours to detect semen

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
a little better, like, you know, act like you give a fuck.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Well, that's very depressing.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
Well, if you think about it, you know there's a dollar cost to this stuff.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
You know that black people get murdered and, like,

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
they don't fucking send David Caruso into a fucking, you know, black light lab.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
No, but it's depressing that it's so easy to impact justice

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
that you could be like, we got a TV show.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
We're going to come in and fund the government.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I truly think that's what it is.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
I mean, we know that that's essentially what the Innocence Project is,

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
is that they're, you know, it's like, holy shit,

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
if you just bothered to take the time,

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
everyone turns out to be innocent, but holy crap, like, like, it's like, it's like, you know,

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
you're up on your knees and you're better.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
You're either about to make yourself a cocktail or a jerk.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
Should I rub your nipple or do you need to handle this?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Either way you should.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Why can't it be both?

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Right.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
All right.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
Speaking of perfect worlds, a special guest tonight.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I did tell, I told you guys this a thousand times, right,

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
that I went to the doctor and he was, I was worried about my testicles

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
getting to that age.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
I thought maybe I felt something.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Yeah.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
And then the doctor, doctor's like, well, do you want me to,

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
do you want me to feel them?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Yeah.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Well, I'd make me feel better.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
It came here.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
And then he, like, he just started feeling,

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
I don't know if I caught myself, like I started touching my nipple.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Again?

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
I reached up.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
No, no, no.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
I was just making sure.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
It's a story.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
I was just making sure I had talked about that.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Oh, God damn it.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
If that's a recurring thing, then we have to talk about that.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
Our next guest has been seen in all media,

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
just like everyone else, because the world is now a hive mind in

11:09.000 --> 11:19.000
which everyone has an equal chance to cause a riot in Tunisia or

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
die in obscurity.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
It really doesn't matter.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Fame means nothing.

11:23.000 --> 11:29.000
But if you're, if you like nice, interesting, good kids with hearts

11:29.000 --> 11:35.000
of gold and minds like a labyrinth, and you like our friend Duncan

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
Trussell, this guy rules in that crew, you know?

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
I call him the Pembertunes.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Please welcome Johnny Pemberton to my bed.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Oh, yeah.

11:45.000 --> 11:51.000
Johnny Pemberton to the stage.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Yeah.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Yeah.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Sorry.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
We didn't really explain anything to you, because we don't.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Hi, guys.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
We've been working with the format a little bit since we lost our audience.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
It's great.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
It's a great new format.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
A lot of new changes and stuff.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
It's really good.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
This could be big what's happening right now.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Using all the mics he's about to.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Well, as a specify, I don't want to make a mistake.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Well, Johnny, Johnny, three mic Pembertunes.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
This is good, because we only had one guest lined up,

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
but you could actually fill in for three guests right now.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
I'll do three.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
What do you want me to do?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Is it three?

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
You might already be.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Did you bring some clips from your new show Pembertunes?

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Yeah.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Did we have those clips?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
What are the Pembertunes?

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Pembertunes episode.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Pembertunes episode two is the best.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
It's got a lot of new.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
We've got Neil Patrick Harris and David Allen Greer.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Yeah.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
You guys go skiing, right?

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
We go skiing on the summertime.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
It's a mountain.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
It's like a thing with wheels, like wheel skiing type thing.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
It's crazy.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
All right.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Well, let's let's check that out.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Click click.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
What's going on out here?

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
I'm David Allen Greer.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
I shouldn't have been skiing in the first place.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Not on mud.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
I'm Neil Patrick Harris.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
I'm a special guest, Neil deGrasse Tyson.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
Hey, Neil.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Timber.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Oh, shit.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
How does all this work, Neil deGrasse Tyson?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
I just got killed by a tree.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
Don't ask me to space and beyond.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Wow.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
So is it kind of, is it a half hour or is it?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
So that was all live action.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Yeah.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
It's all live action.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Then you go back and flash animated.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Yeah.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
Everything is done in a, it's reverse flash with live action.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Everything is comped in.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
They do it like a thing where they, it's all composite shots.

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
It's like drunk history meets Caroline goes to the city.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Caroline goes to the city.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Yeah.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
It's drunk history meets Caroline goes to the city except this time we're taking the

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
drawings that Caroline made you never saw and we're showing them.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
And Caroline goes to the city is like a young Sheldon to Caroline in the city.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Right.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
It's about her getting there.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Yeah.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Before she got there.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
What's the angle on young Sheldon?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Give me the log line.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Elevator pitch on young Sheldon.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
I think that, I think the title is the elevator pitch.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
It's like he's a, it's a single camera Chuck Glory show.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Right.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
That's the real pitch.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Oh, it's a single camera, huh?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Yeah.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
I think so.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Right.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Wow.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
I didn't know that.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Really get intimate.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
I said, I met young Sheldon or you met Chuck.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
They're the same person.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
I met Chuck.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Lori at a, that's some thing.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
Oh, I think I met him.

14:27.000 --> 14:35.000
I think I met him at Caroline's and at that thing that Eric Idol did the dick, the dick

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
show.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
I think he was there.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
All about dick.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Yeah.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Anyways.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Yeah.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Yeah.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
I was like, oh, that's Chuck.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Lori.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Yeah.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
We met at the after party there.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
And, and then I, and then I asked him.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
Like, is there something you, what is it that you want?

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
What is it?

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Right.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Like, what do you want?

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
What do you want?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Why did you get out of bed today?

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
But the way, but the way you said it was, what the fuck dude?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Yeah.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
What did he say?

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
He said, he said, well, actually I want what you, what you have.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
I want to do, I'd love to do a single camera show.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
That's a, you know, that's it.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
I was waiting for him to say that is a critical darling.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
And it's very well crafted, but he really just was talking about medium.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
I'd like to do what you do.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
I'd like to just work less cameras.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Yeah.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Just less cameras and have more time to edit.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
That does sound nice.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Nobody wants to do single cameras.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
If you can do a multi camera thing, the hours are way better.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
It's cheaper.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
I think, yeah.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
But I guess if you, I mean, well, I would imply maybe he has a creative ambition that's

15:36.000 --> 15:42.000
not being, maybe, maybe that's, maybe that's all it's left once you've conquered the,

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
the medium, you know, you go like, okay, but what, what would I, what can't I do?

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
I'm going to do that.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
I guess I would retire.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
I would start, I would start pole vaulting.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Yeah.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
I wouldn't, I would not do it.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
I'm not going to, I did, I did think for a little bit.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Like maybe I'll do multi cam, but then I tried it.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
I sucked at it.

15:59.000 --> 16:04.000
And I wasn't like, Oh, that means it's important to do.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
I was like, I'll do it again.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
I can't watch it or make it.

16:09.000 --> 16:15.000
Now I have to figure out a different way to get the fuck out of this business.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
What about supplements?

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
I don't think those earn you money.

16:21.000 --> 16:26.000
Although if you go to forehims.com, you can get supplements.

16:26.000 --> 16:32.000
You can help us make money by putting in the, the code erection.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
We could prevent you from going bald.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Right.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
And that'll make you money because the world loves hair.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Yeah.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
And they're willing to pay for it in India.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
Don't we get it from there?

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
Oh, we get it from, if we get it from India.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Right.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
We're going bald and they're, they're giving us their hair.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
They've got hair and hair like hair.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
Well, what's been new, Pemberton?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Anything?

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
I don't know, man.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
Just been moving through physical space on a daily basis.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Would you think about that royal wedding?

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I know that you're a big royal watcher.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Yeah.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
I did.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
I had a fun time looking at the front page of CNN because sometimes I will click

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
at CNN just as a default.

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
Like as a time waster kind of, like I just click CNN to look at it.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
And the entire front page of CNN was royal wedding news.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Yeah.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
The entire page, even above the full was all nothing but CNN, nothing but royal wedding.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
It is a big deal.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Doesn't it feel, you're maybe, you're too young for this, but it's like, I was like probably,

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
I was 10-ish or something like that when the princess die thing was happening.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
I was alive for that.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Not her dying, but her getting married.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
Like it was a royal wedding that everyone really cared about because she was, that was the

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
80s version of being black was that she was just like from fucking chutney or something.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
People think they use that.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
She was from Warwickshire.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
She was from chutney.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
She was from Stoke on Trent.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
That was unacceptable back then.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
She was from Elephant and Castle, which is my favorite place.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
I think that's where Michael Cain is from.

18:01.000 --> 18:07.000
It's called Elephant and Castle because it was originally called the, some Spanish princess

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
banging one of the royals and she was the Infante de Castile.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
Like the child of Castile, Castile.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
And nobody that lived there wanted to say, like, we're not calling that fucking Infante

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
de Castile, Elephant and Castle.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
You know, they were like, we're not calling it fucking Infante.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
We're not speaking Spanish under any circumstances.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
That's smart.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
There's a place called Blubber Houses in Britain.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Blubber Houses?

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Blubber.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
How are the Brits?

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
I'm sure the answer is bad.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
I mean, whatever.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Is it, is it bad?

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
I hear they're Brexitting.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Have you heard about this?

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
They're Brexitting.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Have you seen this?

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Have you heard about this?

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Have you heard about this?

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Double Brexiting?

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Double Brexiting.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Now there's a boy, a racial princess.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Hey, hey, hey.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Double Brexit.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Yeah.

18:49.000 --> 18:55.000
That makes me want to frame Roger Rabbit.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
But you're supposed to be helping him.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
I know.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
That's why I'm so bloody mad.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
The double Brexit is when you poop on an Englishman's chest, right?

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Yeah.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
But yeah, I don't know anything about her.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
I know.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
I just, I heard, I heard like a.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
She was on suits.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
She was a co-worker of Jeff.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
I was in, I was on a show that she was in.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
It's crazy that she's American.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Yeah.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
I mean, it's almost like it's being kind of overshadowed by the fact that she's, because

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
the people keep saying biracial.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
She's biracial.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
That's like, well, fuck that.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
She's from, she's from America.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I heard she was also outspoken.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Yeah.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Probably.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
I heard she's outspoken.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
I heard she doesn't go there.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Really?

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Wait, no.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Are you sure?

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
Well, she, she'll go there, but she'll make sure that.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Well, she doesn't play that.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
She doesn't play that.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
She won't certainly not play that.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
No.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
But she, she will.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
She won't do that.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I mean, she may do that.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
I couldn't say.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
I can't understand getting excited about royalty.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
However, I guess the one thing to get excited about it would be, I guess it's like NASCAR.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
Like you're, you could say all you, you're watching all you want, but you're waiting

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
for someone to die.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Right.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Otherwise you're saying you like to watch cars driving a circle.

20:08.000 --> 20:13.000
So like you're, you're watching the royal, we get, we get royal fever when there's a

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
wreck, when there's something that's happening.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Like who is the Fergie lady?

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
Did she, what did she sleep with a plumber or something?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
She did coke too.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Whoa.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
So the royals, the royals were so into the royals because they're, it's, it's being

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
turbulized and what was the king that slept with?

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
That was a big thing here.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
They abdicate the throne and whatnot.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
They lived in a boat.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
They're not really allowed to do anything.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Right.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
Like you can go visit their hat under plexiglass.

20:40.000 --> 20:46.000
I went to London and the line to see their fucking hat.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
They call it a crown was like, I'm American.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
It's a, it's a hat and the line was longer than the Indiana Jones ride.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
It was like unacceptable.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Did you see him?

20:58.000 --> 21:04.000
Like, like, like, yeah, I walked up and it was like, it was a hat under glass with like,

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
I can't tell the difference between real jewels and like, like,

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
They're not the real jewels.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
The real jewels.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
I keep getting took.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
So now they have, you go up and you want to see the Kohi Noor, the mountain of light,

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
speaking of Indian things that we stole.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
And you go there.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
It's not even the fucking real flimflam because that keeps getting taken.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
So that's how you go.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
So you stand in line and go look at the crown jewels and you're looking at a bunch of bullshit.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
And since the world is ending and there's no reward for being cultured anymore,

21:28.000 --> 21:35.000
like, can we just say as Americans, can we even access, I was touring that place,

21:35.000 --> 21:40.000
that castle, whatever you call it, the, the, the, the English castle.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
And, and they're just like back and tail.

21:42.000 --> 21:51.000
To your left is the Bloody Tower. It's said that Queen Belinda every night always scratches her arse

21:51.000 --> 21:58.000
because in 1216, an affair with the Duke of Kensington caused quite a stir in their bodies.

21:58.000 --> 22:03.000
Well, it's like, this shit happened like so long ago that it's not even,

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
they didn't even have paper.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Like, like, like you're just saying some shit.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Like it's a ghost story.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
They used to call hats crowns.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
It's just kind of like, I can't access that stuff.

22:12.000 --> 22:18.000
I'm like, I'm like, I don't know what anything older than 200 years could possibly be like,

22:18.000 --> 22:23.000
because if we believed, if we valued that stuff in America, then we'd have to cop to slavery.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
We'd be like, oh, yeah.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
All of our awesome ancient history is about slavery or genocide.

22:30.000 --> 22:37.000
We owe it to ourselves and each other to be always looking forward in this country.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
I just said a tourist to the south with the who's live guys and like this,

22:40.000 --> 22:45.000
not a lot of upbeat southern tourist attractions.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
Like unless you're talking about blues museums or like, you know, like,

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Alligators.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Alligator museums.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
What was downbeat?

22:52.000 --> 22:58.000
The Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta, Georgia.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
Because aside from Bobby Jones and Margaret Mitchell,

23:01.000 --> 23:07.000
who was the slavery movie gone with the wind.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
The slavery movie?

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
She makes it romantic.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
No, there's just there's just a thousand dead Confederate soldiers and a lot of them,

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
you know, have my name.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
It's pretty rough.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
Yeah.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I can't, I can't tour anything.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
I went to the went to the Anne Frank house.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
That's it.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
That's a kick in the pants.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Is it?

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
It's a lot of laughs.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
I was there.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
Yeah, but it's like the furniture is all gone.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
What?

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
They you go.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
See, I would have only gone.

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000
You go up these steep stairs and then there's like there's shit printed out on Wikipedia

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
and taped to the walls that you can read as you move through the.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
It's just taped to the walls.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Yeah.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
That seems like pretty low.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Pretty like.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Yeah.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
That's not good.

23:53.000 --> 23:59.000
Where did you go to your house and where was that Philadelphia Boston?

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
It was kind of cool because they had to do that.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
That's what a fireplace looked like when polar fear.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
It was tiny like this, this big.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
It was low and it looked like a hobbit might be hanging out there.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
It all looks very talky and that was the one thing that I thought that was the one tour.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
We went to Al Capone's hideout somewhere in northern Wisconsin, me and my family.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
And I was like, oh, all the hallways were tiny.

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
I always thought that museums when they showed like the recreations of the places in museums

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
that they were just saving money, like they were making it like 0.8 scale or something

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
to like use less lumber.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
But like, I guess people, they didn't have vitamins.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
So they were just like little hobbits back then.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
He was like 5'2".

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
Al Capone was just like, he just looked big compared to all the other little tiny people

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
and they had little, their planes were small and their beer bottles were small.

24:43.000 --> 24:49.000
We do like, when I go out into comedy shows, we play in a lot of old theaters and they're all built by tiny people.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Like you can bump your head on everything.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
It's crazy.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Spencer, you know things.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Oh yeah.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
Is there a name for a disorder where I can't hold a brand new pen without breaking off the clip?

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
Like the lapel clip or whatever you call it, pocket clip.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Lack of object permanence.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
I just, I can't, I break them immediately.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
Why don't you get the pens without those things on them?

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
What am I going to break?

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
So it is weird.

25:14.000 --> 25:20.000
Like I feel like there's a lot of American whole culture that's wrapped up in like a historicalness or whatever,

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
like an intentional misreading or misunderstanding of history.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
It's really weird.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
I mean, I don't know.

25:26.000 --> 25:31.000
It's just like, because America started in 1776, it's like we've been, we've barely been around.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
And most of that time, like civil rights haven't existed.

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
But we go like, oh yeah, it was so long ago, this stuff happened.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
It's like, no, it happened when my mom was alive.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Like there's a before and after.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
It's like really crazy.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Yeah, we don't like dealing with that shit.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
But like, I just was listening to a podcast that's like about lore and it talked about the Golem.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
You know the Golem?

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
Like this mythical Golem, like a homunculus or a chimera.

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
The Golem legend only goes back to like late 1700s.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
What was the city that the Golem was supposed to be in?

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
Like was it like an, I think it was in some Spanish city or maybe.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
It's like a giant.

26:06.000 --> 26:13.000
It was a clay monster made by Jewish people to protect the city.

26:13.000 --> 26:23.000
Yeah, or not the city, the people, because apparently it was a huge thing back then to pretend that Jewish people were behind blood sacrifices.

26:23.000 --> 26:30.000
And so you'd kill a body, you'd kill a child and then hide it in someone's like a Jewish person's basement and call the police and go like,

26:30.000 --> 26:36.000
I think this Jewish person just sucked all the blood out of this child and then they'd go and they'd be like, well, clearly this happened.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
And if they could, they could be like, we were all over here.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Prog, Golem, Prog, Prog.

26:42.000 --> 26:48.000
In Shul and we have like, we have a thousand witnesses in a tight knit community and we're peaceful people.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
And then we go like, well, you probably used one of them Golems.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
No, it was the other way.

26:52.000 --> 26:57.000
So they're like, the Golems were to like tell people not to like, don't hide a body here.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
Well, yeah, he like, please don't hide a body here.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
He put the body back where it came from.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
He put the body back.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Was that really what the Golem did?

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
Did he put the body back?

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
He did one of the things he did.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
It's like throwing a tear gas canister back at the cops.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
But the second he touches that body, he becomes a necessary.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
So he made a clay, he can just dissolve.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Yeah, he's a Golem.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
He just turns back in the clay.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
That's what the priests said.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
It was the Golem.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
The Golem did it.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
What about state lines though?

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
I don't know how that works in New York.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
The Golems were made out of state lines.

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000
So they crossed themselves and they become a federal crime just by existing?

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Yeah.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Remember how important the county line was in Dukes of Hazard?

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Oh, man.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
They just drive up and down that road and then it was like, every time it happened for the

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
first time, they'd be like, yeah, they're Duke boys across the county line and go, go, go.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Yeah, because Roscoe Peacoltre would lose all jurisdiction.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
Yeah, he can't.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
I can't.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
I mean...

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
His name was Roscoe Peacoltre?

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
Yeah.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Roscoe Peacoltre.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
No, was it?

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
It was at Chickasaw County, right?

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
It was Chickasaw County.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
They would go into the other county and then, yeah, then all hell broke loose.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Well, I thought you forgot the name of Hazard County.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
His name was Roscoe.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
But they were crossing the Chickasaw County, didn't they?

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
I don't know.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Chickabay, Tain the Wayne.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
Roscoe Peacoltre was the name of the...

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
And J.D....

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
It was Jefferson Davis Hogg.

28:12.000 --> 28:17.000
So if you don't think, I got T's in elementary school.

28:17.000 --> 28:23.000
So I went to the Turner Upfronts because I'm part of the Turner family.

28:23.000 --> 28:29.000
And it was really funny because I was there a couple of years ago.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
I was there for the one that was before the elections.

28:32.000 --> 28:37.000
And I remember at that one, because I remember we had...

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
Allie, a shock hat on shortly after that.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
And we had both just seen each other in New York, which is why she was on the show.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
We were at the Turner Upfronts and we were talking about how weird it was,

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
how much they were selling that the election was going to be a squeaker,

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
which made it extra funny this year because they were like...

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
Wolf Blitzer couldn't be found in the building.

28:59.000 --> 29:05.000
Last time he was front and center and was promising these sponsors.

29:05.000 --> 29:11.000
Folks, the barely unspoken but practically spoken message was,

29:11.000 --> 29:16.000
hey, Colgate, Nike, Heinz, whatever, whoever's here.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
Don't be thinking that Hillary's got this in the bag.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
This is going to be a fucking barn burner.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
That's what a squeaker means?

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
Yeah.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
They kept using that phrase.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
And all of our research shows, it's going to be a squeaker.

29:28.000 --> 29:33.000
Because they're selling a television show called The News that hasn't happened yet.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
A squeaker is one of advertisers.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Yeah, very close.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Almost too close to tell ourselves.

29:37.000 --> 29:42.000
And so then this year, they come out, I missed a year probably,

29:42.000 --> 29:48.000
but then they come out and it's like, they barely mentioned CNN,

29:48.000 --> 29:53.000
except towards the end and then they run this thing that's like this poetry piece

29:53.000 --> 29:59.000
that's about what if everyone started calling Apple's bananas

29:59.000 --> 30:04.000
and then there's one girl who knows an Apple as an Apple or something like that.

30:04.000 --> 30:09.000
But it's mostly just like visual stuff and then there's like an understated title

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
that says like, the truth is more important than ever right now.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
I was like, yeah, I wonder why?

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
How'd that happen?

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
Who created that fucking marketplace?

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
Yeah, the truth is pretty valuable right now.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
It's crazy how foggy it got there for a while.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Remember the squeaker?

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
You cocks?

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
It's crazy how they keep paying people to come on their own channel

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
and say, these are oranges, these are oranges, these are oranges.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Give me money.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
The company saying they're not supposed to say that.

30:39.000 --> 30:44.000
Please pay us $500,000 for 30 seconds during Kellyanne Conway

30:44.000 --> 30:50.000
like spitting saliva into the camera and saying that the president's dick is big

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
so that Anderson Cooper can roll his eyes at it

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
because the truth is more important than ever right now.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
He has a big dick?

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
It's pretty big.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
I haven't watched it in a while.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
That's canon on the news.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
It's really wide, it's super wide.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
It's not very long.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
So it's wider than it is long?

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
In high school they called him trash cantalids.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Trash cantalids.

31:10.000 --> 31:15.000
Because his dick is like 14 inches wide but it's only about 2 inches long.

31:15.000 --> 31:20.000
He can please 11 school kids by spinning it.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
And it's not even against the law

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
because it's technically zonable as playground equipment.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Oh, it's one of those little things you sit on.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
It's called sim spin, right?

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
It's called sim spin but don't let that...

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
I mean that's been co-opted by the porn industry as being like...

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
That was a spinner.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
That's a squeaker.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
A squeaker and a spinner and that's the same.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
It's going to be a spinner.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
It's a squeak and spin.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
A snapper.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
A squeak and a squeak.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
It's red snapper, squeak and spin all the way until the end.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
It's a snapper, squeak and spin.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
That's just a great fish.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Yeah.

31:50.000 --> 31:55.000
I got a huge dent in my head where I hit my head in New York.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
I thought that was a shingles.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
Yeah, so you don't hit that shingles anymore?

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
No, it wasn't shingles.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
It was a wound.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
And then the...

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Still there?

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
And then the...

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
I hate to...

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
I don't...

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
I'm not a big fan of using the word scab but like...

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
You're getting strong!

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
The scab...

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
The scab...

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Because I...

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
Different people are squeamish about different stuff and to me scabs are kind of gross when

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
people talk about them a lot.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
But there's no way around it this time.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
I had a big scab on my head and it came away.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
What do you mean it came away?

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
But even though there wasn't a...

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
I'm trying not to say...

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
Here's the gross words for like a scab coming off.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
It's sloughed off.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
Detached?

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
It's like as if the scab was like...

32:36.000 --> 32:42.000
Even though when I got the head wound it wasn't actively bleeding but then it turned

32:42.000 --> 32:49.000
into this big scab and then when the scab came away there's a divot now where the scab

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
was.

32:50.000 --> 32:56.000
The scab was like gonna like heal my head but then just collapsed my scalp like where

32:56.000 --> 33:01.000
the wound was and started working on knitting the flesh back up and then maybe I picked

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
the scab too much and then they were like fuck it!

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
You want to fucking...

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
There's no flesh up there though to move.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
It's like a very thin layer of skin.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
That's what I'm saying.

33:09.000 --> 33:13.000
If you felt my head right now you'd think there was bone damage because there's nothing

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
up there but skull.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
I was feeling my head but I'm thinking I feel it.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
It might be more Gellin's disease.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
More Gellin's disease?

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
More Gellin's disease?

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
More Gellin's?

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
More Gellin's?

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
More Gellin's?

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
More M-O-R-G-E-L-L-O-N-S?

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
I thought it was more Gellin's.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
Is it more Gellin's?

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
I think if you have more Gellin's you can say it however you want.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
It's sort of like gangstocking.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
Gangstocking?

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
It's like gangstocking the disease.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
More Gellin's disease.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
What is it?

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
What's gangstocking?

33:40.000 --> 33:45.000
Gangstocking is when you think a bunch of people are stalking you all the time and then

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
you go on coast to coast A.M. and talk about it every night.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Okay.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
Yeah, you're right.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
That's gangstocking.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.320
And more Gellin's disease is when you think the aliens have put fibers in your body and

33:54.320 --> 33:58.120
they're growing out of your skin, colorful fibers because you've been experimented by

33:58.120 --> 34:02.400
the government and the gangstocks, they stalk you because the government is trying to keep

34:02.400 --> 34:06.000
track of you so you don't report it to CNN or coast to coast A.M.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
Oh.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Yeah.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.200
I thought, I don't know if we talked about this on this show but I know Duncan was talking

34:11.200 --> 34:16.440
about this at one point where it's like the people that, now that we live in this world

34:16.440 --> 34:24.480
where we're, like there's people who are using the woke language to defend basically what

34:24.480 --> 34:30.920
10 years ago we all just recognized it's like you need help, like in terms of like mental

34:30.920 --> 34:31.920
illness.

34:31.920 --> 34:36.880
People are saying, people are using phrases like I identify as a person who has radio

34:36.880 --> 34:40.320
signals coming through his teeth fillings.

34:40.320 --> 34:45.120
So you can't tell me that I don't.

34:45.120 --> 34:46.600
You can't call me crazy.

34:46.600 --> 34:47.600
That's offensive.

34:47.600 --> 34:48.600
Yeah.

34:48.600 --> 34:49.600
My crazy is not your prom dress.

34:49.600 --> 34:52.160
Which is, which is very interesting because it's like, yep, you got us.

34:52.160 --> 34:53.840
You fucking got us.

34:53.840 --> 34:56.000
I think that's, George Norris were doing that forever though.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.680
It kind of got, I think it's great that he does that.

34:58.680 --> 35:02.920
I love that Art Bell would do that, I mean I, it's like, Art Bell was like, he would

35:02.920 --> 35:07.560
just open the lines and go like, I want to hear from Time Travelers, now I want to hear

35:07.560 --> 35:08.560
it.

35:08.560 --> 35:09.560
Yeah.

35:09.560 --> 35:10.560
You're the Antichrist, call in.

35:10.560 --> 35:11.560
Yeah.

35:11.560 --> 35:13.440
And he always does stuff where he, when someone says something super crazy and you think

35:13.440 --> 35:17.160
he's about to call him on it, he goes, what color was the spaceship?

35:17.160 --> 35:24.120
There's these guys, there's a podcast called Expanded Perspectives, I think that's what

35:24.120 --> 35:25.120
it's called.

35:25.120 --> 35:26.640
And it's two like Southern guys.

35:26.640 --> 35:31.880
I picture them both as looking like Charlie Daniels or like, like Johnny Paycheck.

35:31.880 --> 35:32.880
Yeah.

35:32.880 --> 35:38.360
And they, because they talk like this and they're both, they're both, they're both fine Southern

35:38.360 --> 35:44.560
sounded gentlemen, they razz each other about whether or not their wife has got them whipped

35:44.560 --> 35:49.960
or how they're remodeling their kitchen and they're not, they're not all the way like,

35:49.960 --> 35:56.120
you know, they're not, they're like into like Bigfoot and like Dog Man and like all this

35:56.120 --> 35:57.120
weird shit.

35:57.120 --> 36:01.040
And then like anybody who writes to them, they'll just read, if you just write to them

36:01.040 --> 36:07.280
and say, like the one guy, like, all right, we got to get to some of these letters.

36:07.280 --> 36:12.320
Here Expanded Perspectives, I'm a truck driver that was going down highway five and I have

36:12.320 --> 36:14.120
a story to tell you.

36:14.120 --> 36:15.640
Oh boy, this sounds good.

36:15.640 --> 36:21.600
Like they like vocalize on something like, I was driving when it suddenly my eyes picked

36:21.600 --> 36:27.080
up the sight of a giant lizard man on the side of the road.

36:27.080 --> 36:28.080
What?

36:28.080 --> 36:29.080
No.

36:29.080 --> 36:37.240
They often like like the guy like, and I was standing face to face with a human face

36:37.240 --> 36:39.360
in dinosaur hybrid.

36:39.360 --> 36:40.360
What?

36:40.360 --> 36:41.360
Holy shit.

36:41.360 --> 36:43.160
What episode was that?

36:43.160 --> 36:44.160
It's all of them.

36:44.160 --> 36:47.720
They, they, are they doing a bit or are they really yes and I think they're kind of, because

36:47.720 --> 36:51.320
because then I kept listening to it, I was like, wait, did they just, did you just yes

36:51.320 --> 36:56.680
and everybody who writes in, but then then sometimes they're kind of inexplicably skeptical.

36:56.680 --> 37:00.720
They're like, well, I don't know if that really happened, but that's quite a story.

37:00.720 --> 37:02.880
Maybe it's the writing style to get some sometimes.

37:02.880 --> 37:03.880
Yeah.

37:03.880 --> 37:07.800
Like a brainstorm versus a green needle shit.

37:07.800 --> 37:09.120
I heard it.

37:09.120 --> 37:12.880
Someone explained it to me too in a way that was like, oh, that's not fun.

37:12.880 --> 37:17.680
Well, here's another way that's not fun that like, you see that commercial that were the

37:17.680 --> 37:23.640
guys like, stop the cash box and then it's like it's rock the cat box or something and

37:23.640 --> 37:27.000
it's like, yeah, they're doing rock the Casba and they're all getting the lyrics wrong.

37:27.000 --> 37:32.120
It's like, people have been hearing the wrong sounds forever.

37:32.120 --> 37:34.520
I thought Michael Stipe had a list for 12 years.

37:34.520 --> 37:35.520
Right.

37:35.520 --> 37:36.520
Dan, do you know this thing?

37:36.520 --> 37:37.520
Have you heard this?

37:37.520 --> 37:39.720
Let's see if it works up to the phone here.

37:39.720 --> 37:41.200
Are you talking about the Laurel Yanny thing?

37:41.200 --> 37:42.200
Yeah.

37:42.200 --> 37:43.200
It's like an extension.

37:43.200 --> 37:44.200
This is a new one, but it's the same thing.

37:44.200 --> 37:45.200
It's on a loop.

37:45.200 --> 37:50.920
You either think in your head, think the word brainstorm or think the word, or it's green

37:50.920 --> 37:51.920
needle.

37:51.920 --> 37:52.920
Okay.

37:52.920 --> 37:55.920
And there's one right answer.

37:55.920 --> 37:56.920
Come on.

37:56.920 --> 37:57.920
Go away.

37:57.920 --> 38:03.400
I just don't like all these people trying to act like they hear a Yanny going fucking

38:03.400 --> 38:05.400
here's the Yanny.

38:05.400 --> 38:06.400
Okay.

38:06.400 --> 38:11.040
Well, that's I'm proud to say I hear neither.

38:11.040 --> 38:13.200
That sounds like a laser.

38:13.200 --> 38:14.360
I hear what I think, man.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.480
I totally hear what I think you've not looking at.

38:16.480 --> 38:17.480
That's crazy.

38:17.480 --> 38:18.480
I just don't.

38:18.480 --> 38:20.440
I don't think I think the acoustics aren't ideal for this.

38:20.440 --> 38:21.440
That's the point.

38:21.440 --> 38:25.200
That's part of it is that you just parse it because you're given incomplete information

38:25.200 --> 38:30.520
and your brain puts a perception on it is broken up into like very low frequencies and

38:30.520 --> 38:31.520
very high frequencies.

38:31.520 --> 38:34.880
So you, when you pick one, you're telling your brain, I want to hear the high frequency,

38:34.880 --> 38:39.280
which is green needles, a higher register sound than brainstorm.

38:39.280 --> 38:43.760
I will say I watched a video clip, as most of us probably did of a guy like using his

38:43.760 --> 38:50.040
little sound app to like move the frequencies and demonstrate, but he was only demonstrating

38:50.040 --> 38:53.080
for me that all I ever hear is Laurel.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.080
Yeah.

38:54.080 --> 38:59.200
Like he's like, look, look, look, look, yeah, look, let's round up these Yanny people and

38:59.200 --> 39:02.200
fucking put an end to this because they're psychos.

39:02.200 --> 39:03.200
I agree.

39:03.200 --> 39:09.000
But isn't it probably like people hearing different, I mean, but they're being weird.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.080
They're not being right.

39:10.080 --> 39:11.480
They're being aberrant.

39:11.480 --> 39:14.520
Like they might have bad phones, right, but that's, that's aberrant.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.680
Like that's all not because that's the thing.

39:16.680 --> 39:18.080
The fact is it did say Laurel.

39:18.080 --> 39:19.760
The fact is that did say brainstorm.

39:19.760 --> 39:24.200
It does in certain circumstances say sound green needle and that's, and that's an accurate

39:24.200 --> 39:26.920
perception, but it's an accurate aberrant perception of reality.

39:26.920 --> 39:27.920
You know, that's the thing.

39:27.920 --> 39:31.400
That's what our brains are is simply making snap, quick decisions, right?

39:31.400 --> 39:33.720
Just like people simply are wrong about stuff.

39:33.720 --> 39:36.240
They're wrong about it being Yanny.

39:36.240 --> 39:40.080
There's always been people that are convinced of something wrong.

39:40.080 --> 39:43.360
Like we shouldn't pretend that they're right just because they feel like they're right.

39:43.360 --> 39:44.480
No, they're wrong.

39:44.480 --> 39:45.800
That blue dress, gold dress shit.

39:45.800 --> 39:46.800
I never understood it.

39:46.800 --> 39:47.800
Same thing.

39:47.800 --> 39:52.360
It's like your monitor settings and how much your brightness is that it's the same thing.

39:52.360 --> 39:53.360
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

39:53.360 --> 39:58.880
It's not like a, well, it's also is an empirical color of the actual dress in the world, but

39:58.880 --> 40:01.920
the picture is subject to context.

40:01.920 --> 40:06.760
I went to the most boring thing in Atlanta and I'm vegetarian and I wanted vegetarian

40:06.760 --> 40:12.120
biscuits and gravy and they're like all of our gravies vegetarian, but they don't kind

40:12.120 --> 40:13.120
of want that out there.

40:13.120 --> 40:14.120
Why would you get vegetarian?

40:14.120 --> 40:17.280
We can't make biscuits and gravy without, but you can't do that.

40:17.280 --> 40:18.280
Yes, you can.

40:18.280 --> 40:19.280
Well, listen up.

40:19.280 --> 40:22.560
I'll say you can't do that, Mr. Jeff.

40:22.560 --> 40:28.760
I saw a true crime show where the guy, everything came down to what was in the guy's stomach

40:28.760 --> 40:34.440
because if he, if he, if he had gone anywhere else since the restaurant where he supposedly

40:34.440 --> 40:39.920
had breakfast, uh, uh, then I don't know, it's someone else killed a mother than his

40:39.920 --> 40:40.920
ex-wife or whatever.

40:40.920 --> 40:46.520
But it became very important like where he had eaten because he had onions in his stomach

40:46.520 --> 40:51.640
and he was like, he always orders that the hash browns with no onions and we don't put

40:51.640 --> 40:56.440
hash browns in our onions at the diner and like, and like the case goes cold and like,

40:56.440 --> 41:01.000
because, because it doesn't say onions on the menu and the hash browns and the guy said,

41:01.000 --> 41:02.240
I've been working here 10 years.

41:02.240 --> 41:05.440
I've never put onions in the hash browns and then, and then the whole thing gets resolved

41:05.440 --> 41:09.400
and what the cop is like, you know what, I'm just going to go over there and watch him

41:09.400 --> 41:10.400
make the hash brown.

41:10.400 --> 41:12.840
So this is like a regular kitchen at a diner.

41:12.840 --> 41:16.600
The guy is like mixing all the fucking food together, there's onions everywhere.

41:16.600 --> 41:18.560
There's onions on the fucking spatula.

41:18.560 --> 41:19.560
Yeah.

41:19.560 --> 41:20.560
So there was an onion in his stomach.

41:20.560 --> 41:22.760
10 years, the fucking forensic files.

41:22.760 --> 41:24.040
I don't know what it was.

41:24.040 --> 41:31.040
All I know is that justice is, is, uh, not, it's, it's doesn't, it's, it's not, uh, helping.

41:31.040 --> 41:33.960
Well it's blind in a bad way, it turns out.

41:33.960 --> 41:37.040
The bad guys, the bad guys get away with a lot.

41:37.040 --> 41:42.480
And yet I know that if I tried to commit a crime tomorrow, the same, for the same reason

41:42.480 --> 41:44.520
that I never would, I would fail.

41:44.520 --> 41:46.320
I would get caught immediately.

41:46.320 --> 41:48.320
That's all about dog hair.

41:48.320 --> 41:51.080
You want to speak on that?

41:51.080 --> 41:52.080
These days.

41:52.080 --> 41:57.040
Well, that's the thing is like, I have dog hair over, all over me all the time.

41:57.040 --> 41:59.160
I constantly have covered in dog hair.

41:59.160 --> 42:00.160
Do you have a dog?

42:00.160 --> 42:01.160
Do you have a dog?

42:01.160 --> 42:02.160
Okay.

42:02.160 --> 42:03.160
Good.

42:03.160 --> 42:04.160
And I don't know, most people have a dog.

42:04.160 --> 42:07.760
Like a lot of people have dogs or a cat and that seems to be like never factors in.

42:07.760 --> 42:12.000
Like if you're covered, I can't get away, I can't get the dog hair off your face.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.280
You're wondering why you're getting it worse than, then how come everybody doesn't always

42:15.280 --> 42:16.520
have dog hair all over them?

42:16.520 --> 42:21.000
How come like people aren't constantly caught doing things in forensic files or cold case

42:21.000 --> 42:24.760
shows because well, this is clearly your dog's hair on you.

42:24.760 --> 42:25.760
Yeah.

42:25.760 --> 42:28.800
There's this orange dog hair found on the scene of crime and you have this orange dog

42:28.800 --> 42:29.800
or whatever.

42:29.800 --> 42:30.800
Not even, even the color.

42:30.800 --> 42:32.440
I don't know if they do DNA for dogs.

42:32.440 --> 42:36.200
It isn't a weird, like forensic files, it's always like, and then he stepped on a hamburger

42:36.200 --> 42:39.440
bun after using his bare feet because he didn't want to get fair.

42:39.440 --> 42:42.120
These people almost get away with it all the time.

42:42.120 --> 42:43.120
They're the craziest people.

42:43.120 --> 42:47.520
They're like, well, I really want to like sexually assault this person, but I didn't

42:47.520 --> 42:48.520
bring any gloves.

42:48.520 --> 42:51.760
So I'm going to put my shoe on my head and use it as a hat and it's like, they almost

42:51.760 --> 42:55.900
get away with it, but then they like slip on a hamburger bun and then like a hamburger

42:55.900 --> 43:04.120
bun expert spends $6 million, like reconstructing his toe with an anthropologist or something.

43:04.120 --> 43:08.040
Those guys almost get away with it, which means a bunch of them do.

43:08.040 --> 43:11.760
These forensic files are about the unlucky criminals.

43:11.760 --> 43:19.120
If I would never commit a crime ever, like I would maybe commit the crime of elitism

43:19.120 --> 43:24.880
and like, like, like hating the poor or something, you know, like an ethical crime of like thinking

43:24.880 --> 43:29.180
I'm above other people and then I'm allowed to like, maybe I, maybe I would like dress

43:29.180 --> 43:31.520
as a woman to escape the Titanic, that kind of thing.

43:31.520 --> 43:34.720
Like I could see myself like doing something incredibly cowardly.

43:34.720 --> 43:40.240
Like, like, like if I was a soldier at war, I could see myself maybe like digging a tunnel

43:40.240 --> 43:41.240
and hiding.

43:41.240 --> 43:42.240
Deserting.

43:42.240 --> 43:43.240
Yeah.

43:43.240 --> 43:48.560
Like growing a potato farm underneath the ground and waiting for the war to be over something

43:48.560 --> 43:49.560
like that.

43:49.560 --> 43:50.560
Like a crime, like crime like that.

43:50.560 --> 43:52.640
You would have been an instant Nazi collaborator.

43:52.640 --> 43:55.680
No, that's not, just don't say that.

43:55.680 --> 43:56.680
That's that.

43:56.680 --> 43:58.400
You would have rolled over right off, right off the bat.

43:58.400 --> 44:02.600
No, because I do, there's only, not because I'm a hero, but because there's lines I got,

44:02.600 --> 44:05.880
it's just like, I wouldn't, I would, the lazier it's hard to be.

44:05.880 --> 44:10.400
It's like, I wouldn't, I would be like fucking kill me and kill me fast.

44:10.400 --> 44:16.280
I'm not going to fucking live a life as a fucking background actor and, uh, uh, uh,

44:16.280 --> 44:17.280
Schindler's list.

44:17.280 --> 44:20.960
Like, like, like, like, I was in Boy Scouts for six weeks and I was like, there's no

44:20.960 --> 44:22.200
bicycle rodeos here.

44:22.200 --> 44:23.600
Charlie Brown lied in that commercial.

44:23.600 --> 44:26.880
It's fucking, that was too fascist for me.

44:26.880 --> 44:28.640
I can't fucking tow that line.

44:28.640 --> 44:30.160
I am saying you're a fascist.

44:30.160 --> 44:32.880
I'm saying that you, they would, they would have your number right off the bat.

44:32.880 --> 44:33.880
Yeah.

44:33.880 --> 44:34.880
They would kill me.

44:34.880 --> 44:35.880
Like, I would be like, just kill me.

44:35.880 --> 44:37.880
You're Nazis and I'm never going to, I'll fuck it all up for you.

44:37.880 --> 44:39.080
That's not how the Nazis do it.

44:39.080 --> 44:41.480
I know, but they're not going to give me anything that I'm going to want.

44:41.480 --> 44:44.000
They might flatter you and get you to work for them.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.640
I can't imagine that happening.

44:45.640 --> 44:47.440
You're going to get them something that they want.

44:47.440 --> 44:48.440
They don't, they don't need any.

44:48.440 --> 44:51.680
Oh, you mean I might turn in the Jews under my floorboards?

44:51.680 --> 44:52.680
Certainly.

44:52.680 --> 44:59.000
I, I, I'm not going to sit here and say, I wouldn't do that because it's tacky to assign

44:59.000 --> 45:01.520
yourself that, that, like, hero to me.

45:01.520 --> 45:04.800
I would do that, but I'd never do that, but I'm not afraid to say it.

45:04.800 --> 45:09.800
I'll, I'll, I'll tell you, I mean, that's why I was experiencing so much stress after

45:09.800 --> 45:15.200
the election is because I do feel that in my heart of hearts that push, if push does

45:15.200 --> 45:21.560
come to that kind of shove, some fucking like thing in me is going to take it to that place

45:21.560 --> 45:26.400
and I'm not going to, I'm going to die for those people under my floorboards because

45:26.400 --> 45:30.640
I'm, because it won't be because I'm like a good person as much as it'll be because

45:30.640 --> 45:36.040
I'm like, like, I'm just driven by anxiety and guilt and shame and like, I'll just like

45:36.040 --> 45:40.400
fucking take it all the way and I don't, I don't want to do that.

45:40.400 --> 45:45.360
So please can we unelect this Nazi before shit gets dramatic?

45:45.360 --> 45:51.080
But, but I also recognize that I can't say that I would have courage in the face of anything

45:51.080 --> 45:52.080
like that.

45:52.080 --> 46:00.160
I'm a coward and because I'm a coward, like I think that I would rather die than allow

46:00.160 --> 46:05.400
a Nazi to have their way, like because I'm a, I'm a chicken shit.

46:05.400 --> 46:07.240
So I'd be like, isn't that brave?

46:07.240 --> 46:09.120
It's, it's, it's, it's nuanced.

46:09.120 --> 46:13.080
I just think I'm so dedicated to cowardice that I'm like, we can't have, we can't have

46:13.080 --> 46:14.440
this Nazi business going on.

46:14.440 --> 46:15.440
You got it.

46:15.440 --> 46:17.520
Yeah, I'm going to have to poison you with my tea and then I'm going to blow my brains

46:17.520 --> 46:18.520
out.

46:18.520 --> 46:19.520
Thank you.

46:19.520 --> 46:20.520
Maybe if I could get close to Hitler, I'm going to eat a grenade.

46:20.520 --> 46:25.360
I think a lot of bravery is fear based as well.

46:25.360 --> 46:26.360
Different people.

46:26.360 --> 46:28.200
I think, I think, I think bravery is like intelligence.

46:28.200 --> 46:29.320
Like there's different kinds of it.

46:29.320 --> 46:33.880
I think there are some people who are like, well, I would never, ever, ever do what you

46:33.880 --> 46:34.880
did.

46:34.880 --> 46:40.400
And it's like this thing that you consider dumb, you know, like, like, I mean, you know,

46:40.400 --> 46:42.400
a lot of people have stage fright.

46:42.400 --> 46:46.520
That's a stupid example, but I'm reading all these spy novels recently, like, like John

46:46.520 --> 46:51.040
McCarray and stuff, and there's all this stuff that they call them, like talent spotters

46:51.040 --> 46:56.160
or like they go out and they like, oh, like I heard your podcast or I overheard you at

46:56.160 --> 46:57.160
the bar.

46:57.160 --> 47:03.880
You're somebody that we absolutely could use to be a mole or defect from your home country

47:03.880 --> 47:05.640
and work for us.

47:05.640 --> 47:06.640
I'm in.

47:06.640 --> 47:07.640
Sure.

47:07.640 --> 47:08.640
Call life a tape.

47:08.640 --> 47:12.560
I think, I think I would have been like a good kind of low level spy.

47:12.560 --> 47:16.280
Well, I'm glad to hear you admitting that you would, yeah, they would come at you through

47:16.280 --> 47:17.360
your fashion sense.

47:17.360 --> 47:21.440
They would be like, because you'd be like these Nazis, they, they got pretty uniforms

47:21.440 --> 47:27.160
like you, they value a nice shoehorn or whatever you people think about that might be how they

47:27.160 --> 47:28.160
got you.

47:28.160 --> 47:36.200
They'd be like, Mr. Davis, don't you do you'll not agree that these mud people have no sense

47:36.200 --> 47:37.200
of style?

47:37.200 --> 47:41.520
I'm not going to work for the Nazis because they're well dressed.

47:41.520 --> 47:46.600
But the British or the Americans could have hired me to go infiltrate the Nazis because

47:46.600 --> 47:51.560
I could, I could pull up, obviously we would all opt to be a British spy in the, in the

47:51.560 --> 47:55.720
event of the French spy personally, but probably easier work, right?

47:55.720 --> 48:00.120
Well, you get to be underground, you know, you get to hide and there's a lot of napping.

48:00.120 --> 48:05.880
The reasons don't mostly Yelp reviews, that's how we took them out undermining German restaurant.

48:05.880 --> 48:15.680
So like, I don't know if I would call this bully a base, um, stupid, acting like I know

48:15.680 --> 48:18.640
anything about it, but, but no, but I'm sorry.

48:18.640 --> 48:23.720
Yeah, here's what you're saying, Jeff, because you're not conceded, just convinced you're

48:23.720 --> 48:29.880
like, Oh, in this special episode, like, like, you know, they'll do an X files where it's

48:29.880 --> 48:33.200
like it's a black and white episode and it's aboard the Titanic and there's Nazis and stuff

48:33.200 --> 48:40.080
like in this special episode of our lives where there's a Nazi takeover, like you're

48:40.080 --> 48:45.080
like, Oh, I just end up being a double agent because I'd be really, I'd be really suited

48:45.080 --> 48:46.080
to that task.

48:46.080 --> 48:52.480
Like, yeah, okay, like, it's a nice work if you can get it, but like, most of us are

48:52.480 --> 48:56.800
going to end up being that guy in the beginning of Inglourious Bastards, where it's like,

48:56.800 --> 49:02.840
you have, you have your daughters and your pile of firewood and a glass of milk and you

49:02.840 --> 49:04.640
got a fucking choice to make.

49:04.640 --> 49:06.200
And what was the slip up in that?

49:06.200 --> 49:07.200
I forget.

49:07.200 --> 49:08.200
He just, he caves.

49:08.200 --> 49:09.800
He, what do you mean?

49:09.800 --> 49:10.800
What's the slip up?

49:10.800 --> 49:11.800
How did they find?

49:11.800 --> 49:16.040
He doesn't like the Jew hunter, whatever he calls himself is like, it's, it's, it's establishing

49:16.040 --> 49:22.680
that this guy is so, so he's so intense that, that he doesn't even need to do the shit from

49:22.680 --> 49:29.080
Schindler's list in order to get you to like his Nazism is like, so it's like a fucking

49:29.080 --> 49:35.880
Darth Vader power that like, like, like this guy that he just like insidiously and intimately

49:35.880 --> 49:39.640
like, like weaves his brain into this guy.

49:39.640 --> 49:44.200
And then it's just like, just, just all you have to do is just, just move your eyes differently

49:44.200 --> 49:45.640
and we'll take care of everything.

49:45.640 --> 49:46.640
And the guy did that.

49:46.640 --> 49:47.640
Yeah.

49:47.640 --> 49:52.200
I think I must have just gone to the bathroom or something at that part.

49:52.200 --> 49:54.680
I missed the eye movement.

49:54.680 --> 50:03.000
Yeah, they say when they, from my zero knowledge of spy craft and all that jazz, when they,

50:03.000 --> 50:07.640
when they find timid people, like, like, if there's a spy that knows something about this.

50:07.640 --> 50:09.640
People who work for Disney.

50:09.640 --> 50:11.640
People who work for Disney are that way.

50:11.640 --> 50:12.640
Shy?

50:12.640 --> 50:15.040
People who work for Disney, the company Disney.

50:15.040 --> 50:16.240
Yeah, they find timid people.

50:16.240 --> 50:20.240
Well, yeah, pretty much everyone, if you ever go to Disneyland, everyone you'll talk to

50:20.240 --> 50:22.840
will be very nice, but also very meek.

50:22.840 --> 50:28.000
I think it's a thing that actively seek out people who are like very like timid and meek

50:28.000 --> 50:31.720
and they make, they make great Disneyland employees.

50:31.720 --> 50:32.720
I worked there for a while.

50:32.720 --> 50:33.720
I guess you're right.

50:33.720 --> 50:34.720
You did?

50:34.720 --> 50:35.720
Yeah.

50:35.720 --> 50:36.720
But you're hard, Jeff.

50:36.720 --> 50:37.720
Huh?

50:37.720 --> 50:38.720
You're hard.

50:38.720 --> 50:39.720
That was too hard.

50:39.720 --> 50:40.720
It couldn't, it couldn't fucking do it.

50:40.720 --> 50:41.720
Yeah.

50:41.720 --> 50:42.720
I mean, they had, they had a cowboy show.

50:42.720 --> 50:43.920
So they hired you for a little bit because they're like, we need a fucking swing and

50:43.920 --> 50:44.920
dick.

50:44.920 --> 50:45.920
But, but.

50:45.920 --> 50:46.920
Did you really work there?

50:46.920 --> 50:47.920
Yeah, I did.

50:47.920 --> 50:48.920
When?

50:48.920 --> 50:49.920
Oh, fuck.

50:49.920 --> 50:50.920
I don't know.

50:50.920 --> 50:51.920
Late nineties.

50:51.920 --> 50:55.360
When they were getting rid of the electric, of the main street electric parade.

50:55.360 --> 50:56.360
They brought it back.

50:56.360 --> 50:57.360
Yeah.

50:57.360 --> 50:58.360
Yeah.

50:58.360 --> 50:59.360
Because the second one sucked.

50:59.360 --> 51:00.360
The solar parade?

51:00.360 --> 51:01.360
I mean, come on.

51:01.360 --> 51:02.360
Yeah.

51:02.360 --> 51:03.360
Fake news.

51:03.360 --> 51:04.360
Week lights.

51:04.360 --> 51:05.360
Yeah.

51:05.360 --> 51:07.360
I mean, what is a parade without a little bit of a footprint?

51:07.360 --> 51:08.360
Yeah.

51:08.360 --> 51:09.360
It's all feet.

51:09.360 --> 51:13.760
You can't stand there and just photo synthesize, that's not a parade.

51:13.760 --> 51:15.920
I didn't improv on stuff on the parade route.

51:15.920 --> 51:16.920
And then.

51:16.920 --> 51:17.920
Did you do milk bubble throw?

51:17.920 --> 51:22.920
And I wrote these sketches that were on Frontierland for like a decade, but I was there for like

51:22.920 --> 51:23.920
two years.

51:23.920 --> 51:24.920
It was fun.

51:24.920 --> 51:25.920
Called him on his bubble throw.

51:25.920 --> 51:26.920
Hell yeah.

51:26.920 --> 51:27.920
Bubble throw.

51:27.920 --> 51:28.920
I actually.

51:28.920 --> 51:29.920
Fucking roasted.

51:29.920 --> 51:30.920
I have polyps.

51:30.920 --> 51:31.920
I have a, I have a, I actually have a bubble in my throat.

51:31.920 --> 51:32.920
All right.

51:32.920 --> 51:33.920
I wrote it.

51:33.920 --> 51:34.920
That was different.

51:34.920 --> 51:35.920
You had that.

51:35.920 --> 51:36.920
And then it stopped.

51:36.920 --> 51:37.920
Then you went back to polyp.

51:37.920 --> 51:38.920
It was, it's, I have a polyp on my vocal fold.

51:38.920 --> 51:39.920
I agree.

51:39.920 --> 51:40.920
It's pretty gross.

51:40.920 --> 51:41.920
I'll post a photo of it.

51:41.920 --> 51:42.920
You're still talking and stuff.

51:42.920 --> 51:43.920
I can talk, but it's.

51:43.920 --> 51:44.920
You're not supposed to.

51:44.920 --> 51:45.920
I can feel like a marble in me.

51:45.920 --> 51:46.920
Yeah.

51:46.920 --> 51:47.920
You don't want to.

51:47.920 --> 51:51.920
Surgery on that is very, very dangerous.

51:51.920 --> 51:54.920
Cause if you, if it scars, then you never talk or sing again.

51:54.920 --> 51:58.920
I'll tell you who I'm not going to be this fucking March violets that you told me about.

51:58.920 --> 52:03.920
Like you could see shades of that happening with the, the, when Kanye lost his grip a

52:03.920 --> 52:04.920
little bit.

52:04.920 --> 52:08.920
And then, but it wasn't him that was disturbing cause he's Kanye.

52:08.920 --> 52:16.640
He, it was, it was, it was his wife, Mrs. Kardashian, who, as she was defending her husband, rather

52:16.640 --> 52:23.280
gallantly, like she, she, part of her defense of him was like a little thematically arranged

52:23.280 --> 52:30.600
around this idea that like, um, this is, I'm paraphrasing, but I got the message from

52:30.600 --> 52:34.280
her that like, you know, a year from now, you're all going to be into this.

52:34.280 --> 52:38.640
You know, it was like, I was like, that's exactly what we're bummed out about.

52:38.640 --> 52:40.640
Like, like, like, yeah, no shit.

52:40.640 --> 52:44.640
Like, like it's called fucking, it's called a fucking coup.

52:44.640 --> 52:48.480
Like, I, yeah, that's why we don't, we're not enjoying it.

52:48.480 --> 52:50.120
Can we have your permission to not enjoy it?

52:50.120 --> 52:54.320
Like, like, like, it's not all like, this is like the fucking cerulean blue.

52:54.320 --> 52:59.280
Yeah, it's going to come down like our version of March violence would be like, like, like,

52:59.280 --> 53:00.280
you know what that is.

53:00.280 --> 53:01.520
You're saying violence or violence?

53:01.520 --> 53:02.920
Violence, like a flower.

53:02.920 --> 53:03.920
Okay.

53:03.920 --> 53:07.080
It's like, it's a late blooming flower and it was what we called Nazis that joined the

53:07.080 --> 53:08.080
party later.

53:08.080 --> 53:13.920
So if you had a really low, people who tweeted, uh, all about get this fucking guy out of

53:13.920 --> 53:19.920
here, they were given a little bit of a amnesty, especially the rich people, you know, a coveted

53:19.920 --> 53:24.160
thing was a very low, like early Nazi party number.

53:24.160 --> 53:27.920
And if you were like, had a really long, like late, later day number, you joined in the

53:27.920 --> 53:28.920
forties.

53:28.920 --> 53:29.920
It took you long enough.

53:29.920 --> 53:34.680
How many, how many fucking camps did we have to build before you realized that it was then

53:34.680 --> 53:35.680
people would die.

53:35.680 --> 53:39.160
And there was a lot of like, like black market trading is like, can I get your like, let's

53:39.160 --> 53:41.280
kill this guy and I'm going to take his party number.

53:41.280 --> 53:45.040
So it'll look like I joined in 1938 and not in 1944.

53:45.040 --> 53:46.040
Absolutely.

53:46.040 --> 53:47.240
That's exactly what's going to happen.

53:47.240 --> 53:50.320
Like it's going to, except it's going to be like services that wipe out your Twitter

53:50.320 --> 53:51.320
feed.

53:51.320 --> 53:54.640
It's going to be like, it's going to be like the serial number on your, on your MAGA hat.

53:54.640 --> 53:56.000
Like I got this MAGA hat.

53:56.000 --> 54:00.880
Well, the dot I was getting Johnny was that when she, when Kim Kardashian was, uh, was

54:00.880 --> 54:07.080
defending Kanye, which I want to be sympathetic to her because obviously I think, I mean,

54:07.080 --> 54:12.360
like, I like humanity, I think if you love your husband and blah, blah, blah, like, I

54:12.360 --> 54:15.480
know there's a lot of, there's a lot of well intended controversy about this stuff because

54:15.480 --> 54:20.000
it comes down to, to issues that I find actually appealingly human because there are some people

54:20.000 --> 54:22.880
who are like, Oh, is it mental health issues and all this stuff.

54:22.880 --> 54:23.880
Like it's good.

54:23.880 --> 54:24.880
Let's all have that conversation.

54:24.880 --> 54:26.480
Let's all go round and round.

54:26.480 --> 54:31.920
But so I'm not bagging on anybody for like, for, for, for, for shouting at a throng of

54:31.920 --> 54:34.640
peasants, you know, stop judging my husband.

54:34.640 --> 54:36.600
Um, that's just bad.

54:36.600 --> 54:38.120
That's just an expression of love.

54:38.120 --> 54:41.760
I'm not judging anybody for that.

54:41.760 --> 54:46.480
And nor is it like, I'm just saying that while she was doing that, there were a couple of

54:46.480 --> 54:53.240
things that she said that kind of just like, like part of her defense of him was like,

54:53.240 --> 54:56.080
you know, he's always been ahead of the curve.

54:56.080 --> 54:59.800
You know that you, it's like, like, like people always make fun of him for it.

54:59.800 --> 55:02.520
You know, it wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't all the way that, but it was like, there was

55:02.520 --> 55:06.880
just this, enough of a taste of it that it was just like, Oh, that's exactly, that's

55:06.880 --> 55:10.120
exactly what you're, what I'm afraid you're right about.

55:10.120 --> 55:11.120
She might be right.

55:11.120 --> 55:12.120
She might be right.

55:12.120 --> 55:13.120
Of course she might be.

55:13.120 --> 55:19.560
I mean, this is the thing you can't trust rich fucking people to lead the charge against

55:19.560 --> 55:20.560
a fascist coup.

55:20.560 --> 55:24.920
They're going to fucking flip as soon as the front stops holding, they're going to be

55:24.920 --> 55:27.320
like, okay, how do I keep my house?

55:27.320 --> 55:28.320
Yeah.

55:28.320 --> 55:32.120
I love, I love his line where he said, uh, Puppeteer, Scoopeteer.

55:32.120 --> 55:33.120
Puppeteer, Scoopeteer.

55:33.120 --> 55:34.120
Yeah.

55:34.120 --> 55:36.120
When he said that Puppeteer, Scoopeteer, that was a dog whistle.

55:36.120 --> 55:37.120
I thought, you know what?

55:37.120 --> 55:39.160
He makes a good point.

55:39.160 --> 55:41.440
I hadn't considered that angle.

55:41.440 --> 55:44.600
What he's trying to say is you should, when you see poop, you should joyfully pick it

55:44.600 --> 55:45.600
up.

55:45.600 --> 55:46.600
You should Puppeteer, Scoopeteer.

55:46.600 --> 55:47.600
You shouldn't be like, I have to pick up the shit.

55:47.600 --> 55:50.600
Is this something that he said in a song or is it in a recent song?

55:50.600 --> 55:51.600
Yeah.

55:51.600 --> 55:52.600
He's laid a single.

55:52.600 --> 55:57.280
The court, this is why I think the whole Kanye thing, I think it's all sort of a publicity

55:57.280 --> 55:58.280
smoke screen.

55:58.280 --> 56:02.720
The smoke screen that he's trying to obfuscate the fact that he used Puppeteer, Scoopeteer

56:02.720 --> 56:03.720
in a song.

56:03.720 --> 56:06.160
I don't think that he gives a shit about Trump at all.

56:06.160 --> 56:08.800
Well, I certainly will agree with you there.

56:08.800 --> 56:12.520
I mean, there's no, there's absolutely no question that he has not a single thought

56:12.520 --> 56:15.400
in his head about, uh, foreign policy.

56:15.400 --> 56:16.400
Right.

56:16.400 --> 56:20.680
I mean, he's not, yeah, but, but that's a little different from saying that he's fucking,

56:20.680 --> 56:22.560
he does have a, Jackman in the prestige.

56:22.560 --> 56:25.720
He has a beef with Obama and Obama.

56:25.720 --> 56:26.720
Kanye does?

56:26.720 --> 56:32.000
I mean, Trump is anti-Obama because Obama came out, it was this Obama's super West Coast.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
Yeah.

56:33.000 --> 56:38.640
He's like this old Scott style Chicago though, man, that's the third coast.

56:38.640 --> 56:43.480
No, but like Obama got caught on tape by like Buzzfeed or something, like calling Kanye

56:43.480 --> 56:44.560
a jackass.

56:44.560 --> 56:48.640
And so like, I think Kanye took it really personally being a jackass.

56:48.640 --> 56:50.800
And so he's like, you know, fuck you.

56:50.800 --> 56:54.120
And then, then he comes about saying like, what did Obama do for Chicago?

56:54.120 --> 56:56.520
And that's just, you know, he's just trying to be a douche.

56:56.520 --> 56:57.520
Yeah.

56:57.520 --> 57:00.840
And so Trump is saying the same thing and he's like, yeah, this is what I'm talking about.

57:00.840 --> 57:01.840
We hate this guy.

57:01.840 --> 57:02.840
In his defense.

57:02.840 --> 57:06.320
If you're ever going to take anything the president says personally, it should be him

57:06.320 --> 57:07.320
calling you a jackass.

57:07.320 --> 57:08.320
Yeah.

57:08.320 --> 57:09.320
Yeah.

57:09.320 --> 57:10.320
You should take it so personally.

57:10.320 --> 57:11.320
You change your life.

57:11.320 --> 57:13.720
Not, you should be like the president.

57:13.720 --> 57:14.720
He's the one that's wrong.

57:14.720 --> 57:15.720
I don't know.

57:15.720 --> 57:21.200
But in Trump's defense, black billionaire rapper employment is way up.

57:21.200 --> 57:22.200
Right.

57:22.200 --> 57:23.200
Um, yeah.

57:23.200 --> 57:24.200
Uh, anyways.

57:24.200 --> 57:25.200
No.

57:25.200 --> 57:27.240
That's what I was talking about.

57:27.240 --> 57:33.120
I just, I just pictured, it was like, it was like, yeah, like we're going to get desensitized

57:33.120 --> 57:34.120
that concept too.

57:34.120 --> 57:39.920
It's like, oh, did you hear Bruce Willis like, uh, he fucking flipped and whatever.

57:39.920 --> 57:45.520
It's like, yeah, of course the rich people are going to flip before the people that are

57:45.520 --> 57:47.560
going to die in pain.

57:47.560 --> 57:49.880
I was like, Kanye said like, I don't think of America's racist.

57:49.880 --> 57:54.000
If I thought America's racist, I'd move somewhere else, which is easy to say if you can afford

57:54.000 --> 57:56.040
to pick up and go anywhere you want.

57:56.040 --> 57:58.040
A little way into the same thing.

57:58.040 --> 58:01.680
He left the interview with Katie Kirk years ago saying the same thing.

58:01.680 --> 58:06.240
He's basically like, he basically said, I'm a very wealthy man and I wouldn't be wealthy

58:06.240 --> 58:09.600
if racism was that big a deal in America.

58:09.600 --> 58:15.680
And he, uh, says it in a way, he was like kind of calling out the black lives matter movement.

58:15.680 --> 58:19.360
He doesn't really support it because she asked him about that.

58:19.360 --> 58:21.360
And, um, it's kind of a compliment.

58:21.360 --> 58:22.360
Yeah.

58:22.360 --> 58:27.360
I mean, it's like, to Jeff's point, like, like, yeah, but there aren't that many jobs.

58:27.360 --> 58:31.680
I mean, yeah, it's like, it's like, I, like, I think that's part of the problem is that

58:31.680 --> 58:36.240
we, isn't that kind of like a, yeah, it's like a, that's like a Senator John coming in

58:36.240 --> 58:39.960
from jogging and going like, Oh, it seems pretty cold out there today, global warming

58:39.960 --> 58:40.960
my foot.

58:40.960 --> 58:44.040
You know, like, yeah, it's like a, well, it's a response scale.

58:44.040 --> 58:45.920
It's a response to experiencing racism.

58:45.920 --> 58:49.760
You have to, you have, you experience racism or you see it somewhere and you have to make

58:49.760 --> 58:56.520
decision either this is wrong and unjust or somehow I'm doing my thing right and other

58:56.520 --> 59:00.360
people have just messed up and that's why I haven't failed is because it's not because

59:00.360 --> 59:01.560
I got lucky.

59:01.560 --> 59:03.240
It was because I did something right.

59:03.240 --> 59:04.240
Yeah.

59:04.240 --> 59:05.240
I think that's really important.

59:05.240 --> 59:06.240
White people do that too.

59:06.240 --> 59:08.840
I think that's, but I think that's important for Americans to recognize and forgive is

59:08.840 --> 59:13.880
that because they think that's a, that's a, that's a, we don't want that to be different

59:13.880 --> 59:19.360
about us that we, that we mythologize the idea of individual choice and that we believe

59:19.360 --> 59:25.040
in the mythology of like you, you have that your choices make you who you are.

59:25.040 --> 59:27.120
We certainly don't want to abandon that.

59:27.120 --> 59:31.320
God knows it's sometimes kind of relaxing to, to just, to abandon it.

59:31.320 --> 59:38.000
And God knows it, it does not apply so much that you, that, that your unhappiness is your

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
own fault.

59:39.000 --> 59:46.240
But it is nice that we go that it's like, yeah, it's like, it's like, like, like, unlike

59:46.240 --> 59:52.960
the global warming example, if you're a rich rapper and you go, uh, well, I must have done

59:52.960 --> 59:53.960
something right.

59:53.960 --> 59:54.960
Right.

59:54.960 --> 59:59.080
Like, like, like, like you want that person thinking that way because you don't want them

59:59.080 --> 01:00:01.720
thinking, well, I won the lottery.

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:03.080
I'm not talented at all.

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:05.360
I didn't do any, I didn't make good choices.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.360
I shouldn't know.

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:08.600
I'm just hanging out and doing nothing.

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:12.040
Like we don't want, we don't want us thinking that way.

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:18.080
We want us to think, you know, I, I, I, I got out of bed and I did something and because

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.840
I did it this way instead of that way.

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:20.920
Now I'm a billionaire.

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:22.280
We like that mythology.

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.280
Yeah.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:28.440
I mean, it's nice if we fucking supported it with a middle class economy that didn't

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:33.600
reward you for being born rich more than people get rewarded for earning money.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.600
Right.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.600
Exactly.

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.600
Cause that's the thing.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.600
It's like, it's not like that's not true.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:41.040
It's, there's also this layer that obscures everything and makes it a bit more complicated.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:45.920
So you can't say, no, that's an entirely false premise that does not exist on planet earth.

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:47.160
It's like, there's that.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:51.040
And there's also this thing that I was talking about, you know, that's still a factor.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.040
I don't know.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.040
It's, it's, it's a shame because like that's an example of like somebody saying something

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.800
incredibly provocative that's going to put them in this crossfire.

01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:02.280
But really what they're doing is, is a little bit healthier than, than a lot of stuff because

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:04.240
at least they're using their I statements.

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:09.040
Like they're, they're, they're saying, well, all I know is this, you know, this is, this

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.040
is my experience.

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:14.040
It gets kind of insidious because it gets into what they call, I think, respectability

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:19.080
politics, which is basically you have to shut up and deal with black on black crime or anything

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:23.440
before you're allowed to make any political complaint, which is just a preconceived decision

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:26.280
on political argument that doesn't exist for any of the race.

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:29.960
Like no one has ever been like, you have to solve all your problems before you can say

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.280
taxes should be different.

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:35.160
You know, it's like, it's fundamentally this thing that says you're not allowed to talk

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.160
about this.

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:39.440
And that's what's kind of, what's insidious it was when it builds into that narrative.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.440
Oh man.

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:41.440
It doesn't have to, you know.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:42.440
Yeah.

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:43.440
That's so fucked up.

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:44.440
Right.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.440
Yeah.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.640
We go, we go like, oh, if, if somebody talks about the wealth distribution and they're

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:51.440
rich and you go like, oh, you're rich, so you can't talk about it.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.440
Yeah.

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:53.440
Don't you, why not?

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:54.440
You should give all your money away then.

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:55.440
Isn't that a logical fallacy though?

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:58.880
What's that called when you talk about the straw man thing?

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:03.040
What's the call when you talk about like, oh, this is so bad, but, you know, but this

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.040
is worse.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.040
False equivalence.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.040
False equivalence.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:07.040
I could add.

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.040
How many of them?

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.040
That's a personal attack.

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.040
It's kind of like a straw man.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:12.040
You're a hawk, proper hawk.

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:13.040
Yeah.

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.040
If this, therefore that or something.

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:16.240
Well, that's cause it doesn't fall.

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.240
I mean, I don't know.

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:19.120
It's one of them.

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:23.040
Because it's like saying, it's saying you're wrong because you're not adhering to this,

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.360
my heightened version of it that you never said.

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.840
So it's kind of straw manning.

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:31.480
Well, as they see it, they see it play out because like if a, if a, if an oligarch says

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:36.840
something like, I don't see why we're spending tax money repairing these potholes on Martin

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:41.200
Luther King Boulevard, then somebody might shame them by going, you don't live in that

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:45.960
neighborhood or I'm running for senator of this district and they got like, you've never,

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:50.040
you were born in this place and it's like that, that gets successfully and rightfully

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.560
used against like the bad guys sometimes.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:56.960
And then, but then someone goes, I think prison reform should be a thing.

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:59.440
And then someone goes like, you haven't been to prison.

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.440
Right.

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:03.200
Well, yeah, I don't want to wait until I get there.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.200
You fuck.

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.200
Yeah.

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.200
Exactly.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:10.680
And the thing is like so much that's precedent at our politics is like trying to entertain

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:16.160
these bad faith like obstacles to even being allowed to talk politically.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.680
It's like, you have to clear all these hurdles before they'll even let you speak.

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:23.520
And it's like, well, no, that's not, that's not how it works, but you have to choose to

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:26.280
like cut through it rather than like play by those rules.

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.080
And so it gets all fucked up.

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:32.520
I think then it would be more Greyhound stations and rich neighborhoods.

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:33.520
That could be big.

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.520
That'd be great.

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:35.520
Yeah.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:36.520
I would agree with that.

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:39.000
And Bel Air, because that's how that fire started.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.400
Fire started from a homeless encampment.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.400
Yeah.

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.400
I saw this.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.400
More of that.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:49.320
I saw this guy, this story about this guy who like, he was this judge, this New York

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:56.320
chief judge who spent like half his lifetime like haranguing this woman who he was the,

01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:00.960
he was in charge of her trust and because he, and he was like, he's doing this whole fucked

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:01.960
up weird thing.

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.760
He was like stalking her and fucking with her and all that stuff.

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.280
And then he got busted doing it.

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:10.960
And then he went to prison, but he wrote a book while he was in prison about how crazy

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:14.400
it is to be a judge that gets caught being a fucking criminal.

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:19.720
And then, so then when he got out of prison, he was the best selling author and then they,

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:25.680
they welcomed him back into the, the, the, you know, whatever the fuck he could still

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:29.320
hang out at the country club and all this stuff and he, and the, the woman's life was

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:33.800
ruined and stuff, but like, and then they played a clip of him being on Larry King or

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:34.800
something.

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:35.800
And he, uh, after prison.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:36.800
Yeah.

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:37.800
After all of this.

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.480
And now he was, he's on his victory lap, like, like making his millions on his book about

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:45.800
how, how much he's, you know, learned about how not to get killed in prison or it's,

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:49.840
or it's like, you know, meditations on how, how nutty it is to be a judge and then be in

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:54.840
prison and then be a best selling author, like by me and, and, uh, I wrote a book called

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:57.480
how to, uh, learn how to make a prison belt.

01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:01.920
And Larry, Larry King goes like, it's in the clip, Larry King's guy and like, now you,

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:06.960
uh, I can't do a Larry King impression, but you know, so you, but you, you did, you did

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:07.960
terrible things.

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:12.880
You, you, you did them, you, you, you, you, you ruined this woman's life and they guys,

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:13.880
oh yeah.

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:14.880
No, absolutely.

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.640
I mean, it's what I did.

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.840
There's no, there's no excuse for it.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:24.880
You know, you, you find yourself, um, doing this thing and you, you, you, you, you do

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:26.160
this and then you do that.

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.160
You do that.

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:30.840
And like, because I've been in therapy, I'm like, ah, he's a fucking, like, like, like

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:36.320
that, that you thing, no, that royal you, it's, it's like, it's like, I do that all

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:37.320
the time.

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:38.320
He's taken it away from himself.

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:39.320
Yeah.

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:42.400
It's, it's, it's like, it's like compulsive and I know that seems like a non sequitur,

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:45.960
but it's like, it's kind of like what we're doing when we talk about politics.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:52.760
Like we, we're constantly like tap dancing between like, we don't want intimacy.

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:54.240
We don't want to just be vulnerable.

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.240
Right.

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:59.880
And we end up saying something that's, that's not very fashionable and actually gets tomatoes

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:00.880
thrown at us.

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.960
Like, well, I'm a rich black baseball player.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.000
So America been very good to me.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:11.160
You know, like Bill Garrett Morris bit or whatever, like Sammy, so Sammy, so the, the, the, like,

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:19.000
the, like you don't, so we have to like you, like we, like we're constantly like as, as

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:24.280
primates, like we, we, we feel like we can't just go through life actually just expressing

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:30.800
ourselves because we'll, we'll then we'll get, we'll get beaten up for being like just

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:36.240
kind of like, I don't know what we'll call that narcissism or tunnel vision or selfishness.

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:41.400
But like, so you, you get rewarded over time for like talking about how the world should

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:44.560
be or what the world's feeling or because that's empathy.

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:48.400
Oh, I know how that person feels about stuff, but then that turns into this whole different

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:51.840
kind of like a total pandering.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:52.840
Yeah.

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:56.760
It's just association, like you're still a sociopath because now you're talking about

01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:59.120
everyone but yourself.

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:00.960
You're not selfless by doing that.

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:06.920
You can be a fucking horrible like person that's just like, Oh, I'm certainly I'm not

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:10.000
going to sit in my own skin during this conversation.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.080
I'm going to be everyone else in the world, which is what politicians are really good

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:15.080
at.

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.080
Like that's all they do.

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:19.560
Man, what do you need?

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:20.560
Holy shit.

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.560
Oh shut up.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.920
Why don't you make a golem?

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:24.920
It's crazy, man.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:30.040
I wanted to learn about it because it is this weird quintessentially Jewish mythology that's

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.480
also like a dragon.

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:36.320
It's like, what if like there was like this famous Muslim Pegasus or like, you know, a

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.720
famous Sphinx or something.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:38.720
It's just really weird.

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:41.000
The famous Catholic leprechaun.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.160
A Catholic leprechaun.

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.160
Yeah.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:48.560
The Catholic, the giant leprechaun of, of, of Saint James Cathedral.

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:49.560
There are Catholic giants.

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:52.560
There's a giant dick in Catholic zombies.

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:53.560
Now, what?

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:54.560
They're famed.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:58.560
I'm going to send an Irish golem after them.

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:05.560
I am at your command, begosh and begora.

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:06.560
What do you need, man?

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:08.760
Go slay my enemies.

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:14.320
I will do that big top of the morning.

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:19.520
I find it, I find the only racist part of the great Irish leprechaun is that you're

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:25.160
in Saint James Cathedral is that he's famous for sucking his own dick, but not famous for

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.640
being a giant leprechaun.

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:30.320
Well, a lot of people say he's a normal person.

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:31.320
Right.

01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:32.320
Okay.

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:33.320
Yeah.

01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:34.320
Oh, so he's the, he's the world's tallest giant.

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:35.320
A lot of people accuse him of being a five foot 11.

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:37.080
So he might just be a guy that sucks his own dick.

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:40.320
He's five 11, but so is his dick.

01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:41.880
It's a big old ripping rope.

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:47.200
You know, by the way, as far as Jewish mythology, the listeners to our podcast will know that

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:53.720
the Jewish community created another, a modern myth called Superman, two Jewish kids created

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:54.720
Superman.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:55.720
Oh yeah.

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:56.720
They're always making stuff.

01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:03.520
Those Jews, they pronounced it Superman, Superman, Superman was the original pronunciation

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:09.640
with Superman, Spider-man, Superman, Clark, it's so it's, I think it's a follow-up, Tom

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:10.640
can spit.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:11.640
I know, but it's still so funny.

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:16.680
I mean, it's also probably beyond that, but it's like, it really is funny to say Superman.

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:21.280
Anytime you have like a man word that you can say like with the men instead, it's always

01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:22.280
fun.

01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:29.600
Like that was the one there, the, the Goy editor at DC Comics was like, boys, look, I love

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:30.600
Superman.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:31.600
Can we make it two words?

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:37.480
Can we, but could we just, I, you know, could we just, I don't want to, it was a very touchy

01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:38.480
time.

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.480
It's the 1930s.

01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:40.480
I don't want to go there.

01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:42.400
I don't want to compromise you.

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.680
Could we just pronounce it different?

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:45.680
Superman.

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.680
Superman.

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:51.160
Oh, and then the two brothers are like out in the sidewalk cause like they're, it divides

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:52.160
them down the middle.

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:58.160
It's like, this is for our fucking uncle, you don't call it Iceberg.

01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.160
Yeah.

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:00.160
Superman.

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.160
It's a burger.

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:02.160
It's for our uncle.

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:09.560
And the other brother is like, we take this one thing and then we have the first Jewish

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:12.360
character in popular culture.

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.360
Pick your battles.

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.360
Pick your battles.

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:15.360
It's a Trojan horse.

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:17.080
He, he wears a Jewish cape.

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:19.040
He has Jewish X-ray vision.

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:22.360
He's from, he's from space Israel.

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:27.720
The only way you can beat him is by digging up a chunk of it and he's got, he's got to

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:28.720
put him.

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:31.120
He's got, he's got to put him.

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:32.120
He's got those.

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:33.120
He come from the planet.

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.120
Put him.

01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:35.120

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:37.120
What was his planet?

01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:38.120

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:39.120
What was it?

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.120

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:45.120
Put him.

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.560

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:51.560

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:54.120
Is it Jor-El and what's the, Jor-Jor?

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:55.480
What is Superman's actual name?

01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:56.480
Klarkin.

01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:57.480
Klark-Kal-El.

01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:58.480
It sounds very Hebrew.

01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.480
Klarkin.

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.480
Oh yeah?

You know what Kal-El means in Hebrew?

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:08.000
Uh, check please.

collecting people in the factory in the warehouse and he's dumping them all in

01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:29.220
there and then there's and then there's a plot point where one of the 30 people

01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:32.660
that are all like bound and gagged that are like trying to figure out what the

01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:35.460

01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:30.860
eating almost impossible to digest animals that have developed to graze

01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:35.540
have intensely crazy labyrinthine digestive systems that are capable of

01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:39.220
somewhat breaking down grass because they're like imagine that's like being

01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:44.060
able to desalinate ocean water it'd be like if you could do it all of our

01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:47.580
problems are over but it's really fucking hard to do it and meanwhile tigers

01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:51.300
are like why don't you just grow claws and eat you well because we can all eat

01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:54.220
me you can drink a little of your own pee if you're really thirsty and it doesn't

01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:59.020
fuck you up but then they shit bricks of hay basically because you can even if

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:05.460
you're a fucking elephant with all of the good if we eat grass we would probably

01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:09.900
we would poop just grass it would just be grass and like whatever we should try

01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:13.060
it like a Philly cheesesteak physical challenge what would that look like if

01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:17.940
humans just ate that much grass you'd be I think we would just we would do we

01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:22.300
would we would starve to death because we would be like we can't even break down

01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:29.460
the cellulose cellulose in grass like like like like grazing plants like we

01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:35.860
can eat a carrot but we can't eat grass because it's just it grass is just made

01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:40.420
out of fucking Kevlar like like like like the amount of like shit that it takes

01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:46.660
to turn that into food it's not worth it yeah and so when they poop it's like it's

01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:50.740
a bunch of grass and that's why and then the elephant next to you goes like what

01:17:50.740 --> 01:17:54.940
do you what are you doing yeah and I was like well I'm shitting it because I have

01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:58.020
to I was gonna take it for another spin he's like well can I do you mind you

01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:01.020
you're already you're already facing that way are you mind no go ahead knock

01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:04.140
yourself out when they get right up in there eat the poop out the butt sometimes

01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:08.900
yeah they put the trunk everybody elephants yeah you can see right up

01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:12.980
another elephant's ass a trunk up an ass it's great pull out a brick but you

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:16.460
don't eat from their trunk leave from their mouth no they pull it grab it in

01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:20.420
the trunk like a hand yeah pull a brick of this has got to be like a thing they

01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:24.620
do once in a while as a joke or like a terrible captain youtube videos of it

01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:27.220
I'm telling you it's gotta be a thing like different angles of the same thing

01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:31.740
and giraffes drink piss you'll find this is also true there's at least seven

01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:34.980
videos of people freaking the fuck out because they think that they're the

01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:38.060
first and last person to ever see an elephant reach its trunk up another

01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:42.940
elephant's asshole pull a turd out and eat it they're they're justifiably very

01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:47.700
excited they're like the word Bob Saget has never been exclaimed so many times

01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:52.260
but but but the jokes on them because they're part of a playlist the club like

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:56.060
bunch of people at the Brooklyn Zoo seeing an elephant eat its own shit for

01:18:56.060 --> 01:19:00.860
the first time what if this is a captivity thing I don't well it could

01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:04.340
it could very well be something that gets I'm calling captivity on this you

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:07.580
know about the chimpanzee frog thing I mean we don't need to rehash too many we

01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:10.460
gotta retire the podcast cuz we're just saying the same I don't know about the

01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:15.300
chimpanzee just go Google when you go home today Google chimpanzee frog there's

01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:19.020
nothing to jump on to chipman's he'll put a frog on the deck and just kill it

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:22.500
and throw it away like a like a used condom they'll they'll though worse than

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:27.740
kill it like we'll kill a buffalo and then not use all of it a chimpanzee

01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:34.020
won't bother killing the frog it'll just it just uses it humiliated it'll

01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:39.220
just load it and then and then just throws it like a loofa in a public

01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:45.140
shower and and the frog you have you you that's never gonna walk the same it

01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:50.380
takes a lot to watch a video about a fucking primate that has 99.5% of your

01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:56.580
DNA and identify with a reptile like there's a serious crime happening when

01:19:56.580 --> 01:20:03.380
you're like I'm the frog you just did something horrible like you don't think

01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:06.220
you don't feel that way about the termites when it dips the stick in but

01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:13.100
like these things will fuck up if you wouldn't use the stick the frogs gotta

01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:15.980
have some sort of special shape it's like a you know it's it's probably

01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:21.420
evolution actually basically like all chimpanzees are what we like all

01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:25.540
chimpanzees are sociopaths like they're they're like we're fascinated by serial

01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:29.700
killers and mafia hit men and things like that we go like oh it's like they

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:33.780
don't even they don't have an empathic response like that's all chimps are just

01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:36.580
like there's like look at the frog and they're like what's this thing look at

01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:41.020
this look at this mouth looks like a chip pussy

01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:52.780
frogs like I have a face can't you see that yeah no I saw it I'm but they're

01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:59.660
kind of asking for it because they're always out there going rub it just give me a break that's all the

01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:07.020
time we have for tonight rub it that's not even oh that's what a horny toad says

01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:11.740
it's not a horny toad says rub it I mean they say Budweiser because they're drunk

01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:14.620
and they asked for it because they've been drinking all this Budweiser they're

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:17.140
asking again you're telling me if you didn't think of that joke you would have

01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:27.340
kept it to yourself I don't know man I've yeah I don't know and that's why

01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:30.500
that you would be turned by the Nazis in one day like you think that's how now I

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:33.260
feel like that's more evidence that I wouldn't be because I would be I was like

01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:38.580
as like well I needed to rhyme with ribbit you can't you can't change a

01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:44.260
whole vowel but different cultures say cockadoodle dude yeah well okay so a

01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:49.180
French dog supposedly says yeah yeah yeah or whatever I was this is what it

01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:55.100
says oof oof yeah it's OEUF I love that section of your foreign language in

01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:58.420
high school that's with a whole fucking chapter of ant well let's learn what a

01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:02.860
cow says in front of your mind cow says yonnie in French

01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:10.820
Spiegel in German yeah yeah check us a lock in cats say green needle and the

01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:17.780
Yugoslavian ones say they say show they say dead I don't know they say we needed

01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:22.100
to form a new country that doesn't have the croats Dan do you know why French

01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:29.900
chefs only use one egg to make an omelet wait hold on I know I got it why

01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:34.100
are they always you want you already know are you my buzz in yeah no no it's

01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:39.340
better when you tell I know what it is because I know I took two semesters of

01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:48.340
French how you're gonna nail it because it because because it's an OEUF one egg

01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:54.540
is enough yeah one egg is enough there's your French lesson for today do you

01:22:54.540 --> 01:23:03.300
know what no that was too dumb we should add those like animated speech like

01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:07.420
thought bubbles to our heads like for the live feed like in those dating shows

01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:11.700
on MTV I'm just thinking about stuff I wanted to plug an hour ago what do you

01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:17.860
plug right yeah does anyone seen a cassette tape anywhere I didn't bring

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:22.660
one speaking of cassette tapes isn't isn't there something involving that

01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:26.580
happening I heard there is I put one out on this label called star burns

01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:33.740
industries press hmm and it's it's really fun and cool and you can get a

01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:39.260
digitally what's it called it's called recorder for quality assurance so what

01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:44.460
is that there's like a tape club yeah this is tape club you sign up for it and

01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:48.500
you get one a month and you can even get a cassette player if you don't have one

they'll send one to you you went a little Christopher walking on that that was

01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:55.460

what was this cassette thing is that a bit or whatever it's you go to Starbucks

01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:09.860
audience church what do we call it SBI press I would say just Google it yeah

01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:15.660
Google it on drip drip web address is impossible to use it's like a bad web

01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:19.060
address it's like an old web address where I'm just looking right in the

01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:22.620
camera saying this just for because I I know I'm just acknowledging the

01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:30.100
convention of the recording right now SBI press on drip right it's a website

01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:34.180
it's like Kickstarter but or it's like patreon I guess it's like everything

01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:38.940
that everything is everything it's like Donnie Hathaway eating a giant dick

01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:42.980
thousand years ago and halfway Donnie Hathaway the guy wrote everything is

01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:47.620
everything that soul singer from Chicago 75 greatest song ever everything is

01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:52.780
everything you know the truth about life I'm not familiar song by Donnie

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:56.460
Hathaway called everything is everything he wrote it and like some year but it

01:25:56.460 --> 01:26:00.940
came out 1975 that's one of the greatest songs of all time and that song pretty

01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:05.900
much is right about everything that's also a really good song hmm I've got a

01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:09.540
text from Zach it's his girlfriend's birthday Zac McKeever who couldn't be

01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:13.860
here tonight he's with his girlfriend in Seattle let's give him a shout out

01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:20.940
Zach and Ann I hope you go I hope you're both ass to mouth right now I think

01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:25.620
that's very sporting so an ass to mouth I hope that what if you're both ass to

01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:32.020
mouth that's that's can you do that yeah you can I realize our policy of not

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:36.340
shouting out the people who are actively working for us probably makes them

01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:40.300
feel like it's okay to go out of town for for a show but last thing we want to

01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:43.940
do is reward them when they do that right it's like that's like that's like

01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:47.320
the state that's like the principle and the morning announcements going like

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:50.500
let's go let's let's talk about who's playing hooky today who's in detention

01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:57.700
today who's missing here today one of our tech guys what happened at that

01:26:57.700 --> 01:27:02.620
what would they do he well did you notice that things seemed a little

01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:07.820
shoddy I don't know like they're like the format was a little wobbly at the top

01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:11.100
of the show Zach kind of usually brings it makes it sound you know it's kind of

01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:15.780
maybe this the person operating the scissor lift I love to hear that sound

01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:21.620
right now we have no audience but we have we have 500 teamsters that are

01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:27.060
required to be here but they have to be absolutely quiet they're all they have

01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:31.900
six scissor lifts if you if you turn these cameras around it looks like Lord

01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:37.140
of the Rings like outside the castle that work army there's just like there's

01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:42.660
there's there's so there's Ali fonts and there's like blue ghosts but they're

01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:46.460
all being incredibly respectful because we're not allowed to have an audience do

01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:51.180
we go to the audience thing next Sunday I don't know it gets complicated week

01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:55.700

01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:43.740
of your hat in solidarity because we were skewing anti-semitic so you wanted

01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:46.220
to balance it was a coincidence it was just sort of one of those things that

01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:52.860
happened that will never know why sometimes like as a goi goi him I don't

01:29:52.860 --> 01:30:00.620
know how that works Steve either is on the in in Yiddish is Yiddish or Hebrew

01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:05.300
I also don't know that Yiddish is like slang right it's like it is a Eastern

01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:10.340
European language that was spoken by Jewish people and so words that end with

01:30:10.340 --> 01:30:16.460
um is that like plural in yeah it's like there's a goi and then there's a bunch

01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:22.700
of goi um is that yeah all right it's a flock of goi him and it's a murder of

01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:31.940
latkes that's what the golem oh it's golem gellum all right Steve break us

01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:38.780
down from the perspective of the person that that keeps that keeps caring what

01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:42.300
we're doing about time I mean like I don't know someone says next Saturday to

done something are we bringing the bed with us as a bed stand now that is

01:30:54.140 --> 01:30:58.820
coming along and it's gonna play the piano where no we're gonna be in for

01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:01.820
this is the last time we're not gonna be in front of people yeah man this is the

01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:05.660
end of our isolation yeah come back when it's in front of people yeah it'll be

01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:09.700
better but more importantly what should we do before that we can't do in front

01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:14.620
of people oh shit um I should have brought my Minecraft laptop let's sew

01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:23.940
ourselves ass to mouth oh wow we'll see that's significant what is it like who

01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:31.300
if we're all gonna do that who sews what's the workflow on us sewing

01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:35.820
ourselves ass to mouth with each other well you're you're you're a centipede

01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:39.780
syndicalist you believe that that it should be worked into the centipede I

01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:47.780
don't believe in mutual I mean yeah I'm more of a reciprocity based how about

01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:51.980
magnets no I but I believe that there should always be a doctor in order for

01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:56.180
there to be a centipede you could do it as a lot you could put electromagnets in

01:31:56.180 --> 01:32:01.220
our mouths and then the other side of the electromagnetic on a butt and then

01:32:01.220 --> 01:32:04.660
you could then you just have everyone has control of the switch so if you want

01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:10.740
to a lot of people would say Jeff that if it's not sewn it's not a centipede

01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:14.420
because it's like we aren't we already don't we already have the option of

01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:17.500
putting our lips on each other's but holes and eating all the poop from each

01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:21.940
other's butts I'm saying the control of the switch like it switches around I

01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:29.020
like you can have control for like eight hours it's a liberal fantasy you know

01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:40.260
you got to choose do you want my lips in your ass full okay I'm listening

01:32:40.260 --> 01:32:47.140
have I got your attention I'm all I'm all ears and then it's my turn to have

01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:52.580
your mouth sewn to my butt I can't sew that so yeah that's I'm saying you need

01:32:52.580 --> 01:33:00.020
a doctor Pemberton so is my your mouth to my butt we got Spencer's left right

01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:05.020
but now we have you know we got both of you left I don't think that the doctors

01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:10.340
Spencer shows Pemberton's mouth to my butt mm-hmm at the very end when it's

01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:15.420
time for Spencer's mouth to be sewn to a butt and mouth and butt to a mouth we're

01:33:15.420 --> 01:33:19.820
gonna have to all get into kind of like circle the wagons yeah and so we're

01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:24.900
gonna they're gonna get into a circle and that's because at that point we'll

01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:29.140
be able to form a human wheel and roll at high speeds that's where the term

01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:33.020
sewing circle comes from right I you do raise an interesting point about the

01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:37.420
human centipede mythos I've watched all three of those movies and I and I cannot

01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:45.540
pin the characters or the director down and whether or not he thinks that having

01:33:45.540 --> 01:33:50.300
your lips sewn to another person's butt is a good thing or a bad I don't I don't

01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:54.940
understand how it works they what you don't you understand because I mean you

01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:59.140
would just do the question that poop is not food is that your problem no no no

01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:02.460
it's not that at all it's more like imagine your lips being sewed to someone

01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:07.100
else's asshole right yeah right you're gonna lose the ability to use your

01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:11.460
your mandible right so it's like if someone shits like a giant log you're

01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:18.140
fucking in soft your nose well you gotta hope you're gonna have to you

01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:22.820
gotta start furiously furiously swallowing that poop well I thought you

01:34:22.820 --> 01:34:26.540
were going is like this isn't how skin works it's not like welding you're

01:34:26.540 --> 01:34:30.500
gonna rip your fucking lips off somebody's yeah that's the truth yeah you

01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:33.940
will just ask me that's the important question what's more important to you

01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:37.060
ripping off the front of your face or eating some of that delicious I suspended

01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:40.980
my disbelief on the lip stuff but if someone's taking a giant turd in your

01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:46.980
mouth you can't you can't suspend your you but he also he feeds them special

01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:50.420
food you haven't watched these movies no no he doesn't feed him like fucking

01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:55.380
broccoli and chicken okay like he makes him eat like fucking protein broth and

01:34:55.380 --> 01:35:00.660
stuff like he wants him to have diarrhea it's it's all very it's like the guy

01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:04.140

01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:48.580

01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:55.260
a that's not necessarily your fault it's it's his fault yeah I'm just saying it's

01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:59.340
okay to go away Memorial Day is bigger than me and my needs it's about our

01:36:59.340 --> 01:37:07.540
nation's soldiers about 9-11 it's about 9-11 it's about war and yellow ribbons

01:37:07.540 --> 01:37:16.140
and supporting things David get a memory it's about dear hunter it's about it's

01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:27.420
about Michael man transformers it's about the dead it's about Independence Day

01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:31.140
the movie even though it's a different holiday right it's more about it's more

01:37:31.140 --> 01:37:36.380
of a Memorial Day movie for me yeah it's about our arm services yeah well I

01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:39.860
think you know there's not a heavy Thanksgiving element to Wizard of Oz but

01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:44.820
people have come to why I think you're right Independence Day is a great

01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:50.460
Memorial Day movie it's for me it's the only one which is why IFC plays it on

01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:59.460
loop for 24 hours huh oh for Christ's sake all right Pemberton plugged he's got

01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:02.620
a cassette tape that's part of this giant subscription that you can get where

01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:08.540
you get a tape every week yeah kiss my asses every month the satellite for

01:38:08.540 --> 01:38:12.420
Sunday the month but this this on June it's gonna be we're doing it in Denver

01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:16.820
do you know that Anna of Zac McKeever fame who is currently asked to mouth in

01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:24.740
Seattle with our Zach uh-huh produces that show and Hosni yeah true she

01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:30.020
produces it it's true I know her when she's not eagerly gobbling poop out of

01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:36.740
Zach's but well a German scientist who we will never be able to pin down on his

01:38:36.740 --> 01:38:45.900
feelings about it keep keep saying yes yes well it's the next stage in human

01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:51.220
evolution I mean he says that but right I just I don't I don't but he doesn't

01:38:51.220 --> 01:38:54.620
understand that you can't eat poop and then like when it turns out you can't

01:38:54.620 --> 01:38:58.620
he's like wait what but also he's like stoked about how it's uncomfortable for

01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:01.820
them right like he's like yeah I love making you do it because you hate it

01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:05.700
survival of fitness so you don't like it like you don't think a human should be

01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:09.580
eating shit because you you actually are just a regular guy that's just like

01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:14.460
hates like hitchhikers or whoever these people are that came to your German lair

01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:17.180
right that's just a masochist right

01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:21.660
status status I think I think he's doling out what he considers the

01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:26.940
ultimate punishment he's not he's not into it he's he's into making people

01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:33.420
bummed out in the original movie the original movie he he that's the TV that's

01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:38.940
the Chuck Lorre's human centipede jump bummed out that's actually what the

01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:44.060
singularity is the Canadian Dave Foley's in it that's the singularity is when

01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:51.460
they remake the human centipede every once in a while you gotta take what

01:39:51.460 --> 01:39:59.300
you're giving for my new friends in a circle of friends bummed out sometimes

01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:05.180
life throws stuff at you and sometimes you throw stuff at life be friends with

01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:10.580
the person behind you giving as good as you get to giving it back paying it

01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:19.740
forward taking it back I'm with you and we're on the right track bummed out

01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:27.820
Dave Foley is the bumbling sadistic German scientists I was on the road with

01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:31.420
Dave Foley for a couple weeks and he's a fucking joy he's absolutely a sweetheart

01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:38.500
and fuck is he funny so funny well I hope he is okay with the fact that when

01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:42.380
he comes on the show there's gonna be a fucking audience because we just burnt

01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:47.140
up our last delicious taste of no audience I think he is born in front of

01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:51.020
an audience I think he's a born performer what do we do what's the

01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:56.460
lab we're never gonna be in total silence in a dark empty warehouse ever

01:40:56.460 --> 01:41:00.060
again what what's the thing you always wanted to do Spencer already pitched

01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:04.700
asked a man centipede yeah Dan you should say all those things that you don't

01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:08.260
like saying in front of an audience because they'll make weird sounds right

01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:21.980
okay race oh wait no I'm making the sounds 85% of everyone is stupid and

01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:28.700
that actually does include 85% of whatever group you belong to believe me

01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:45.020
I've met you I'm stupid oh maybe 85 chance four of us are I don't like okay

01:41:45.020 --> 01:41:50.060
here's a good one I just get to get this out before we have an audience I

01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:55.180
recognize it as a well-executed movie compared to the Sony versions I think

01:41:55.180 --> 01:42:01.140
it's a waste of Spider-Man to just turn him into a AI suit with Tony Stark just

01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:08.860
providing him with a Spider-Man suit what's this yeah the new Spider-Man is

01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:13.700
that it's like I have he gets a new suit from Tony Stark and it's like this suit

01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:19.380
is like talking to him like Jarvis and I like that I get the complaints the thing

01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:24.420
is like in the story of like Civil War and everything that did happen but it's

01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:28.420
like that's not like a quintessential Spider-Man story it's not like a reboot

01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:32.660
Spider-Man story it's like this very like that's like the seventh Spider-Man

01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:36.380
movie can be about oh now he has a Spider-Man AI suit it's kind of an

01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:40.380
interesting choice for you know for what's essentially like a reboot like

01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:46.540
setting off the it's weird yeah did you like that in a quiet place did we talk

01:42:46.540 --> 01:42:51.420
about this I haven't seen it and I won't watch it and here's why I don't like

01:42:51.420 --> 01:42:58.260
deaf people movies now I'm kidding I I'm just trying to think of like the things

01:42:58.260 --> 01:43:05.460
to say before an audience comes back I can't talk about Atlanta I haven't

01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:12.740
watched Atlanta how about dead cool that's that's that's all I keep saying

01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:20.780
is having watched Atlanta devil to his very meta it's enjoyable meta how meta

01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:27.900
it's way up its own ass I never way I never met a set and watch themselves

01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:34.700
filming it pretty much it's like the first one like like like yeah it references

01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:43.900
everything it's references the Avengers video assist almost actually yeah the

01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:49.980
whole movie takes place in video village yeah there's an element of rewind

01:43:49.980 --> 01:43:54.460
play fast forward in there how many how many people is our theater than the new

01:43:54.460 --> 01:44:03.940
venue hold 500 yeah for real no I think it's 150 but it's a good amount it's

01:44:03.940 --> 01:44:08.500
really really nice seats right sprays great sound and we're looking at it in

01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:12.980
the prestigious stabbing district downtown Los Angeles right that you will

01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:17.580
want to bring pepper spray usually can get it on clearance of fries yes run

01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:21.980
don't walk from your car to the theater to see Harmontown well you will have

01:44:21.980 --> 01:44:25.060
to run from your car because you have to park so fucking far away that you'll

01:44:25.060 --> 01:44:32.580
have to be late just left or uber or carpool yeah pull up pull up pull pull

01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:38.060
right up to the front we'll have a paparazzi out there for you that could

01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:41.580
be cool we should do that for our big opening we should hire a red carpet

01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:45.900
should we do a hand bone like like paparazzi red carpet thing as long as

01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:52.300
I don't have to do anything I have to commit but yeah yeah I just pictured you

01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:57.820
out there crack it down rolling up some carpet staple gun in hand hot glue in

01:44:57.820 --> 01:45:02.700
some some do some appliques onto a thing you want to do some step-and-turns

01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:08.500
step-and-turns yeah repeat is it really trying to think I'm trying to think of

01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:12.580
the thing oh one more thing it's before we before we're back in front of an

01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:17.740
audience I don't like poor people and I don't have to because I what I grew up

01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:23.740
poor enough that I know that you there's nothing magical about being poor you

01:45:23.740 --> 01:45:27.940
you can be poor and be a fucking dumb asshole just as easily as you can be

01:45:27.940 --> 01:45:36.300
born rich and be a dumb asshole so when you say to me on Instagram hey

01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:40.940
why don't you stop doing what you're currently doing and do what I tell you

01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:45.620
to do and I tell you to go fuck your mother you dumb broke hillbilly fuck

01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:49.940
face and stop giving me advice about the hair on my shoulders in my shower

01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:55.420
because your life sucks because you're a fucking loser and you try to play the

01:45:55.420 --> 01:46:01.180
class system fucking card with me you can double fuck yourself with a hundred

01:46:01.180 --> 01:46:05.660
poor dicks because I made myself out of dirt without permission and that's

01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:10.900
exactly why you can go fuck yourself because I'm 45 years old so I'm better

01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:19.540
than you I made myself rich so I'm better than you I'm I'm I have I have a

01:46:19.540 --> 01:46:24.140
differently shaped brain than yours and that doesn't make me better than you but

01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:27.700
it makes me luckier than you which makes me better than you because

01:46:27.700 --> 01:46:33.540
capitalism so stop telling me what to do because by every rule you hold important

01:46:33.540 --> 01:46:38.100
you have to shut the fuck up forever all the time whenever you're in my

01:46:38.100 --> 01:46:43.020
presence because you're a lower person than me you're and you're and you're

01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:49.180
you're an animal so I just wanted to get that off my chest but I say I say we

01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:56.580
delete this from this and you save this for the audience no no I'm getting

01:46:56.580 --> 01:47:00.860
open with it we open with it it's a it's like a rom-com it's like we broke up

01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:05.660
like I do we I don't like I've had a I've had a good time in my bachelor pad

01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:10.980
without the audience like rolling around in my own farts I can't wait to be back

01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:14.460
in front of the audience with flowers and candy what if you got Bernie made

01:47:14.460 --> 01:47:17.140
off and some horrible shit happened and you couldn't make money and you lost

01:47:17.140 --> 01:47:21.460
everything and you were a poor guy again I'd be a poor guy who proved he was

01:47:21.460 --> 01:47:25.780
better than other people by having made myself rich and then I'd be twice as

01:47:25.780 --> 01:47:28.320
angry about being poor what I don't even know where you're going all those

01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:34.620
people they're still doing fine are they yeah also you can't make me poor Jeff

01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:38.460
people have been trying for 40 years dude don't fucking issue that sort of

01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:42.460
fucking challenge no I'm making you poor and fucking 48 hours no I will

01:47:42.460 --> 01:47:45.780
reverse Brewster's million you this is part of our great new road movie that

01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:50.060
we're doing for Netflix there's no back-end but Davis makes you poor and

01:47:50.060 --> 01:47:55.580
48 hours to two friends I bet I could make you poor and 48 hours well yeah

01:47:55.580 --> 01:48:03.740
we're gonna spread my dad's ashes okay Adam Sandler is Jeff Davis in Neil

01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:10.020
Patrick Harris as David Allen Greer I but but wait what was I I was just about

01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:14.220
to say you're you're hating on the poor yeah yeah but that's not helping cuz I

01:48:14.220 --> 01:48:22.900
knew that part but shit I had it on the tip of my tongue fuck lost it lost it

01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:26.660
what if you if something about you say like what if you could make me what if

01:48:26.660 --> 01:48:32.220
you what if you made me poor what if you lost everything oh I know what it is

01:48:32.220 --> 01:48:35.820
because you and you implied that if I say oh people have been trying to make me

01:48:35.820 --> 01:48:39.700
poor and they can't beat me and all this stuff here's the thing another thing

01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:43.620
you got my chest before before we make up with the audience and we entertain

01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:46.540
them because they're gonna buy tickets and we're gonna be like you're good

01:48:46.540 --> 01:48:49.780
people like like some of your bad people but we're gonna like pretend you're

01:48:49.780 --> 01:48:54.940
good people this this little anti poor monologous ticket sales gold right it

01:48:54.940 --> 01:49:00.820
doesn't also we don't hear one person shows up for the show that we did

01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:05.620
doubled our zero audience I'm invincible we're also charging ticket master

01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:10.820
prices as I think I think yeah it's $800 for the first for the first 20 rows is

01:49:10.820 --> 01:49:14.660
$800 but and ironically those are the seats that are the worst because when I

01:49:14.660 --> 01:49:19.340
do my wire fly you're gonna get kicked in the face I actually I'm gonna be

01:49:19.340 --> 01:49:36.220
controlling no my therapist and I are working on I have to get over this idea

01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:41.900
that if you say I'm a great person you can't beat me I'm wonderful I'm having

01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:45.420
a good life that that means that an anvil is gonna fall on your head like

01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:50.340
that's a that's a that's a that's a normally healthy thing because you're

01:49:50.340 --> 01:49:54.420
not supposed to be a pompous cock and like right that's a normally healthy

01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:58.460
thing that's a normally healthy thing but but for me it's like you know carbs

01:49:58.460 --> 01:50:02.100
are normally healthy for some people but like I have to be on a diet that like

01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:10.940
yeah well you don't have to know okay I have to know yeah yeah you what you know

01:50:10.940 --> 01:50:15.380
doesn't matter and that won't and won't have negative repercussions on me

01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:20.420
because it's okay for me to be confident and certain about what makes me happy

01:50:20.420 --> 01:50:26.180
there won't be negative repercussions because I was satisfied with myself or

01:50:26.180 --> 01:50:31.900
my work or my life or anything was good enough like there is no punishment from

01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:36.940
the universe for me being okay with the way the day is going and there there's

01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:42.180
no there's no reason for me to check in and make sure that's okay with you

01:50:42.180 --> 01:50:45.460
that's something that everybody else needs to do because they're fucking

01:50:45.460 --> 01:50:51.140
stupid and they need to grow and be better people I have become God where

01:50:51.140 --> 01:50:55.100
does poverty come into the story you're more mad about because my money is a

01:50:55.100 --> 01:50:58.780
direct measure of my worth as a person my accomplice I don't know what are you

01:50:58.780 --> 01:51:02.660
talking about you're more mad at stupid people than than whether they have money

01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:07.660
in the bank I right I don't I don't know what what you just did a giant rant

01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:11.220
about your poor people poor people or animals I don't know if I did a giant

01:51:11.220 --> 01:51:16.460
rant about anything for that's your subjective what I what I said was if

01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:20.420
you're an Instagram and I tell you to go fuck yourself and one of the things I

01:51:20.420 --> 01:51:24.980
tell you that is a reason why you shouldn't be telling me what to do is

01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:29.420
because your dumb ass is broke in addition to you being anonymous living

01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:33.340
with your parents having accomplished nothing having a life half the length

01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:38.460
of mine not making anyone happy and not following me and you're following me

01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:42.140
instead of I'm following you there's a million reasons why if you really think

01:51:42.140 --> 01:51:47.060
about it it's fucking dumb for you to ever open your mouth around me like like

01:51:47.060 --> 01:51:52.340
you don't have to then you're not gonna get away with saying to me oh that makes

01:51:52.340 --> 01:51:59.700
you a lannister because it doesn't like like you're a you're a fucking idiot and

01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:06.620
a gross little dirty filthy piglet and being broke as a part of that because

01:52:06.620 --> 01:52:10.780
because because there's not a lot of rich people doing it like like getting

01:52:10.780 --> 01:52:14.100
it watching me take a shower and my Instagram feed and telling me that I

01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:21.020
need to get my shoulders like to do the hair or whatever there's not a lot of

01:52:21.020 --> 01:52:24.340
rich people doing that maybe maybe that's the connection I don't know James

01:52:24.340 --> 01:52:30.500
Woods James Woods is in my Instagram telling me to get hair removal he's a

01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:37.700
troll oh he's a big-time troll you're 15 you're poor your parents are they

01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:45.780
fucked up you you you you you're a failure you're gonna die miserable and

01:52:45.780 --> 01:52:48.420
you won't even know it you'll think you're happy that's how miserable and

01:52:48.420 --> 01:52:51.660
dumb you are you can't even you can't even detect misery as much as I can I

01:52:51.660 --> 01:52:56.540
have more emotional taste buds than you it's probably a bad time to announce

01:52:56.540 --> 01:53:02.780
your run for Congress yeah all right I think it's all I think it's all out so

01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:09.580
then we'll next time you see me this is definitely been worked out

01:53:09.580 --> 01:53:15.120
certainly done it's all done well I think you're being sarcastic and you're

01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:18.540
suggesting that something bad happened well no I'm not I'm just like it seems

01:53:18.540 --> 01:53:25.540
like I don't think this is a difficult for you to sit and listen to me say a

01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:29.740
bunch of stuff and then go ah that's great is that a tough choice for you as

01:53:29.740 --> 01:53:35.820
a performer are you yeah yeah okay I like let's switch roles like like like say a

01:53:35.820 --> 01:53:45.500

I gotta say goodbye to the no people this is giving you flashbacks to forcing

01:55:31.940 --> 01:55:35.060
myself to do this at the end of every show for a year while we were on the

01:55:35.060 --> 01:55:44.700
road though I did a movie about myself I produced a movie about myself and we did

01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:54.500
30 shows about me and we sang this song cuz we couldn't pay for our music and we

01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:59.780
couldn't put music in our movie so we made Ryan elder make us music we could

01:55:59.780 --> 01:56:08.620
keep using and we got sick of it so we made everyone sing this song and then

01:56:08.620 --> 01:56:16.700
we had to keep going on to 25 shows in 20 days and keep pretending to learn

01:56:16.700 --> 01:56:25.060
things but when you drink too much and the director is sober he'll make the

01:56:25.060 --> 01:56:34.340
