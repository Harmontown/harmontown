WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:21.320
Sorry for the delay. It's my fault. I don't know. There might be a word for this. It's

00:21.320 --> 00:27.620
an Uber thing. I filled out the Uber thing, but I didn't hit the request button. I put

00:27.620 --> 00:33.760
it back in my pocket. I hate to advertise for Uber, but it's become such a big part

00:33.760 --> 00:37.680
of my life, and it's so convenient that I didn't notice that I didn't do it all the

00:37.680 --> 00:44.520
way. Then I looked at 7.45. It was like I pulled out the phone, and it's like, yeah,

00:44.520 --> 00:50.120
anytime you want to say that you want someone to start thinking about picking you up, it's

00:50.120 --> 00:57.840
fine, and I was like, Harmon, not a good way to start the show, especially when you're

00:57.840 --> 01:03.840
going to start it late. You don't come out with a dumb, boring story of why you're late.

01:03.840 --> 01:16.160
Don't do that. Carol will turn on you. He'll turn on you. Thank you, thank you. Said he

01:16.160 --> 01:23.400
loved me. Choking. Why are we ashamed to do it? We've talked about that. You start choking

01:23.400 --> 01:25.720
up food, your first instinct. I'm going to get out of here. I'm going to get out of

01:25.720 --> 01:30.520
this restaurant. People are going to see me choking. When did we talk about this? I just

01:30.520 --> 01:36.800
imagine we did, because it seems like we would have. I mean, it is embarrassing to choke,

01:36.800 --> 01:40.560
because you're saying, look at me failing at the only thing we're designed to do as

01:40.560 --> 01:46.140
humans. That was Cody's theory, but I wanted to add to that. I think it's also like, our

01:46.140 --> 01:54.840
throats are reverse buttholes. They're private to us. It's glottal and gooey. That's the

01:54.840 --> 02:02.440
threshold before we consider this to be stinky, gross factory of violence and everything we're

02:02.440 --> 02:09.360
ashamed of. On a deep level, we have body shame. We all worry about, I mean, there's a couple

02:09.360 --> 02:14.280
of us that don't worry about it, but getting our clothes suddenly ripped off and our body

02:14.280 --> 02:20.360
being laid bare. We think about that as being shame, but we don't even have a word for the

02:20.360 --> 02:25.760
level of shame we have about our actual intestines, like saving Private Ryan when the people are

02:25.760 --> 02:31.160
walking around and they're like, oh, God. I'm so embarrassed about this, because they don't

02:31.160 --> 02:37.880
feel the pain yet. The pain is not an issue. Right then, they're feeling like, my arm is

02:37.880 --> 02:44.240
off and they're going, I look like a dick to myself. No one else is going, what a dick.

02:44.240 --> 02:50.880
But it's what we feel, and so when you're choking, I mean, I swear to God. Do you think

02:50.880 --> 02:57.120
there's something about sphincters that make us shameful like inherently? Wait, about what?

02:57.120 --> 03:01.440
Sphincters. Oh, sphincters. You're saying we're embarrassed of our throat buttholes. Yeah,

03:01.440 --> 03:06.680
we, I think that if you present a human being or any biological organism with an image of

03:06.680 --> 03:16.720
a thing that has a sphincter on it, which is a spot in a membrane or a case where things

03:16.720 --> 03:27.680
come to an elastic but snug airtight. It sure is, Dan. I think we side with everything

03:27.680 --> 03:36.320
inside the sphincter, but we also, we are ashamed of it. Like the inside of anything

03:36.320 --> 03:42.680
that's sealed off from the outside world represents us shamefully. When push comes to shove, we

03:42.680 --> 03:49.200
side with the sphincter. Yeah. Well, sphincters are threshold. We side with the dark side

03:49.200 --> 04:01.720
of the sphincter. Right. With all the shits, sir, yes. Jesus, this audience. All right.

04:01.720 --> 04:06.440
So Andy Dick has rescheduled. Yeah, yeah. And I only mentioned it because of the appropriateness

04:06.440 --> 04:18.080
of it. He and Dina will be back on September 11th. And I think it's okay to say this, but

04:18.080 --> 04:22.200
I don't even know which week, so you'll just have to keep coming to the show. We got some

04:22.200 --> 04:27.560
of those Duffer brothers coming today. Yeah, yeah. But we only got, yeah, a lot of people

04:27.560 --> 04:33.280
don't know this. There's nine Duff brothers. There's three Duffer, three of the Duffer

04:33.280 --> 04:39.240
ones of the nine are the ones that make the show that you like. But there's two Duffist

04:39.240 --> 04:46.480
brothers that they're so Duff they don't even work in entertainment. Like they're just relaxed.

04:46.480 --> 04:54.120
Those are the people you want on your show. But we got some Duffer brothers. There's weed

04:54.120 --> 05:12.880
oil lube. I don't know. I guess you can put it on your privates. All right. We'll just

05:12.880 --> 05:22.880
talk about Trump all night. Who ironically hates children. He hates children. All right.

05:22.880 --> 05:35.160
So Obama, he's going to visit the flood zone. Oh shit. Didn't they tell him not to? Oh shit.

05:35.160 --> 05:40.040
Thank you. It's funny when you're the president, you have to visit the disasters. It's kind

05:40.040 --> 05:46.920
of, I'd realize what would happen if you didn't. And sometimes they don't. But it's funny,

05:46.920 --> 05:51.400
just the idea of being a president and visiting a disaster is funny. It's hilarious. Because

05:51.400 --> 05:56.800
it's like, because he's like show, I mean, you know, we need, no, you know, what's he

05:56.800 --> 06:03.880
going to do? He's just like, I mean, I understand it's a symbolic thing. It's like, you do

06:03.880 --> 06:07.960
want it to happen, but it is also still funny from a logical perspective. It's like, it's

06:07.960 --> 06:13.800
very silly. He's just like, here he is. It's like, here it is. So all the water, from where

06:13.800 --> 06:18.800
it was to where it shouldn't be. He gets off the plane and is like, whoa. Yeah. This is

06:18.800 --> 06:23.640
fucked up. You guys are fucked up. Yeah, that's fucked up. And then I'll make a speech and

06:23.640 --> 06:31.640
I'll go, I talked to Carl, whose house was inundated with water. And Carl will be like,

06:31.640 --> 06:39.920
thank you for mentioning it. This is, yeah, this is like, you can't make those up in a

06:39.920 --> 06:43.800
flood, in a flood speech. No, you got to, you got to, he's doing research. He's going

06:43.800 --> 06:50.880
to get the personal stories. Hello. Did you get flooded? Yes, Mr. President. Okay. Great.

06:50.880 --> 07:03.560
What's your name? Tara. T-A-R-A. Yep. Okay. Flooding for you was bad. Yes. You owned

07:03.560 --> 07:18.240
a lot of dry things. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Do, do, do, do, do. Oh, give me the high sign

07:18.240 --> 07:23.040
when our first guests get here, just so I know, because I'll bring them up. It's a good

07:23.040 --> 07:28.440
idea. Cool. Oh, Spencer, that, I'm interpreting that as you thinking the show is going poorly.

07:28.440 --> 07:32.600
Oh, it is. It's terrible. Okay. It's going to be a bad show. It's good to be on the same

07:32.600 --> 07:43.520
page. Sorry, guys. I'm going to face over here for the next five minutes. Okay. Well,

07:43.520 --> 07:48.960
you just, at least just come, can she sit up here, at least? That's weirder, isn't it?

07:48.960 --> 08:00.640
That's why I follow the weirdness. Let's make children uncomfortable. See, this is bad,

08:00.640 --> 08:08.880
right? We're having a fun time. Do you want to, do you want to hold a microphone and make

08:08.880 --> 08:16.280
her voice real loud? She knows that. Do you, do you want to tell us your name? You can,

08:16.280 --> 08:23.520
it can be a... My name's Madeline. Madeline? Is it Marilyn or Madeline? Madeline. What,

08:23.520 --> 08:29.720
you're going to say? You're going to say something? It's okay. I'm, I'm, I've been uncomfortable

08:29.720 --> 08:37.320
for 43 years. It's not going to stop. She was telling you something. Did she, do you

08:37.320 --> 08:42.560
know what she wanted you to... She was saying her name. It's true. She was. The thing that

08:42.560 --> 08:48.320
she was answering was her name. Yeah. Madeline, I guess, I guess you're probably sick of answering

08:48.320 --> 08:53.240
this question, but how old are you? Four. Four. You get that all the time, right? That's

08:53.240 --> 08:57.000
where the interview stops. You're like, if another, if another person asks how old I

08:57.000 --> 09:01.360
am, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to smash a, I can't even do

09:01.360 --> 09:11.760
any bits of it. Yeah. Don't worry about it. Madeline, so four years, you were born of

09:11.760 --> 09:20.080
like when I, I weighed five less pounds. Nothing has really happened in my life since, in the

09:20.080 --> 09:25.520
last four years, but for you, it's been a real roller coaster ride. Do you, do you, do you,

09:25.520 --> 09:29.560
you don't, you can't, you don't, you don't have prenatal memories, do you? Do you know

09:29.560 --> 09:38.120
what, do you, do you have any idea of, do you remember your birth at all? No. It's probably

09:38.120 --> 09:48.160
traumatic. I think it's. This is probably traumatic. I'm sure, I think being born probably

09:48.160 --> 09:57.480
makes Vietnam look like a jimboree. We're on vacation, so. Oh, really? So it's a family

09:57.480 --> 10:02.040
vacation? Okay. Just me and her. So you're saying, but I want you to tell, let these

10:02.040 --> 10:08.760
people know at, at home, you're saying I, I don't have to filter my show through four

10:08.760 --> 10:19.720
year old ears. No, go for it. Okay. It's your show. All right. Madeline, do you, do you,

10:19.720 --> 10:23.960
do you have anything that you're, you're super into, like trains or polar bears or dinosaurs

10:23.960 --> 10:28.240
or, I mean, you don't have to pick a thing. I don't want to limit my little pony. Like,

10:28.240 --> 10:34.800
you know, I don't, I'm not going to pigeonhole you, but, you know, like, maybe a frozen character.

10:34.800 --> 10:47.800
Rick. Oh. She loves, she loves Rick. Rick is her Elsa. It's a, it's a new, it's a, it's,

10:47.800 --> 11:00.600
it's a new generation. So do, do your parents are, do you admire them or do you ever think

11:00.600 --> 11:06.600
I act like, like these guys, they don't, they don't know what they're talking about. I asked

11:06.600 --> 11:14.360
them who invented peanut butter and jelly and they said they didn't know. Yeah. Yeah. Is

11:14.360 --> 11:19.480
the world a happy place? Is it, by and large, is it stress free or is it a stressful place?

11:19.480 --> 11:23.720
Like when you wake up in the morning or you stressed out, do you feel anxiety? Do you

11:23.720 --> 11:32.600
know what anxiety is? I'm sure. Must be nice. Do you get dressed by yourself or do you still

11:32.600 --> 11:42.160
get dressed? Does everybody need to help you put dress, your dress? I can do it myself.

11:42.160 --> 11:57.480
It's great. That's great. How's, are you going to school yet? Do you? I only go to Flamenco.

11:57.480 --> 12:01.440
You only go, wait, wait, to, to Flamenco? She, she takes Flamenco classes. Flamenco, she

12:01.440 --> 12:06.560
only goes to Flamenco class. She's, she's starting school when you get back, but. You

12:06.560 --> 12:09.960
don't know, you know, that's a, that's a dance. You don't know any steps yet. Do you just

12:09.960 --> 12:21.080
start it? You don't want to show us a Flamenco dance? That's all right. Privacy is a, is

12:21.080 --> 12:26.680
a scarce thing in this post millennial age. You're, you're part of the new generation

12:26.680 --> 12:37.520
that's going to like crave silence and bicycles. She actually has her own YouTube channel.

12:37.520 --> 12:43.280
That's why she passed a thousand subscribers. Well, you, we, we should plug it probably.

12:43.280 --> 12:52.040
What's, what's the, what's the YouTube channel? Can we go there? Do you want to do the intro

12:52.040 --> 13:04.680
for that? I, I'm daddy. It's, I show my daughter trailers. All right. Well, we, we, we won't

13:04.680 --> 13:08.440
go there and freak you out. You can keep, keep practicing and you can come back on the show

13:08.440 --> 13:13.200
and let us know when you're ready to, ready to share your Flamenco with the public. All

13:13.200 --> 13:18.960
right, Madeline, you want to go back and, and, and silently wonder what is happening

13:18.960 --> 13:32.720
on this. Oh, she does that. Okay, we'll stick around. All right, fine. I'm really setting

13:32.720 --> 13:40.560
myself up for this. Do you think the show is going okay so far? Thank you.

13:40.560 --> 14:03.880
Didn't matter. Oh my God. Okay. So, oh, do we have, are we, it looks like we have, okay,

14:03.880 --> 14:17.280
let's bring out our, our old friends Cameron and Rhea, Cameron Esposito and Rhea Butcher.

14:17.280 --> 14:22.800
It's just me right now, Dan. I'm sorry. It's just me right now. I'm so sorry you guys.

14:22.800 --> 14:27.960
I know that, thank you. I know that people are either fans of Cameron or fans of me.

14:27.960 --> 14:31.360
So the people who are only fans of Cameron, I apologize.

14:31.360 --> 14:35.880
Oh man. Well, that means, I'm going to, I'm going to come over there. Great. Dan's coming

14:35.880 --> 14:40.480
over here. I got to move my chapstick and my shit. Sorry. I have to take my chapstick

14:40.480 --> 14:46.080
out of my pocket because these jeans are tight. So hello, Dan. All right. Well, so you guys

14:46.080 --> 14:51.240
have a heart out. Hello. We have, this is Madeline. Madeline, nice to meet you. Oh, you don't

14:51.240 --> 14:59.600
know what this is. I get it. She's four. Right. Yeah. Yeah. But she has a, she has a YouTube

14:59.600 --> 15:03.640
channel and she does flamenco. She's taking flamenco lessons. Amazing. All I know about

15:03.640 --> 15:08.920
her. She's probably a Republican. She's got great shoes. I love your shoes. Fantastic

15:08.920 --> 15:20.920
shoes. Great. She's adorable. So, okay. So, take my wife. I just, I just, I just watched

15:20.920 --> 15:29.640
her and she said, Oh, thank you, Dan. It's Cameron and Ria. And you guys, it's very nuanced

15:29.640 --> 15:34.320
and touching. And it's like, I like, it's, and it's also shot really well. Oh, thank you.

15:34.320 --> 15:39.120
And I like, I like the, the, like, there's a lot of text and tweeting, like, like digital

15:39.120 --> 15:43.240
stuff. Like, like, that's been a challenge for all of us, like, like, like getting that

15:43.240 --> 15:47.160
into our narratives on screen. Yeah. How much of it do you do without feeling like bye-bye

15:47.160 --> 15:51.800
birdie bubbles? Absolutely. But, but it works really well. Oh, thank you very much. Cameron

15:51.800 --> 15:58.160
throughout the, it works as like a Greek chorus is what, is what, is what. Yeah, because Cameron

15:58.160 --> 16:02.680
throughout the thing is like, just like checking in and it just says like, you're like, we

16:02.680 --> 16:06.440
get it. You're gay. Do you know what's funny about that, Dan? And she'll probably tell

16:06.440 --> 16:11.280
this exact same story. So pretend like I didn't tell it once she gets here is that when we

16:11.280 --> 16:18.640
were filming that part of that episode, her, an episode of her appearance on Comedy Bang

16:18.640 --> 16:25.960
Bang came out while we were filming it. And she got those exact responses on Twitter in

16:25.960 --> 16:31.280
actual real life. Right. Even though she had previously written them as kind of an amalgam

16:31.280 --> 16:34.120
of what she had already gotten. Absolutely. Of everything that it already had, like it

16:34.120 --> 16:38.120
had already happened before, but that day, it happened again. So it was perfect. We were

16:38.120 --> 16:43.760
like, yeah, this episode is accurate. I'm not stretching. I mean, it is like, I mean,

16:43.760 --> 16:48.000
if there's any subversion to it, it's subversion is simply in the fact that it's just a nice

16:48.000 --> 16:52.840
single camera sitcom and it's not necessarily driven by any kind of us versus them energy

16:52.840 --> 16:57.640
in spite of the fact that wait for it. These are two women and they're married. All right,

16:57.640 --> 17:02.120
just calm down. Will you calm down? I didn't know about that part. I just, I watched, I'm

17:02.120 --> 17:06.080
not done watching the whole thing. Maybe there's a mask involved at the end. It would certainly

17:06.080 --> 17:13.120
make me more comfortable. Dan, there's a snow globe at the end. But it's not, the world

17:13.120 --> 17:20.560
is absurd, but it's not absurdly like, it's not like, everyone doesn't understand and

17:20.560 --> 17:24.840
like, you know what I mean? Like there's a world of straw dogs, which are like, it's

17:24.840 --> 17:28.760
just the pretty much normal world, but there's a little bit of mystical realism, just like

17:28.760 --> 17:36.440
a touch to it. I just, I really like the tone. And it's not a spoiler driven thing,

17:36.440 --> 17:40.680
but like, because it's just the story, the first episode is the story of you overcoming

17:40.680 --> 17:45.840
your fear of committing to this job so much that you would actually quit your real job.

17:45.840 --> 17:51.080
And meanwhile, while she's like, having these like, struggles with whether or not she wants

17:51.080 --> 17:58.040
to be a comic that mentions you on stage ever. And then she's like, the triumphant return

17:58.040 --> 18:03.000
threshold moment is her, you know, like turning sideways to the wings and do it and talking

18:03.000 --> 18:06.160
to you instead of the audience. And it's really, it's a really nice moment. It's not overly

18:06.160 --> 18:09.200
cloying or anything. I don't know why you don't need my approval.

18:09.200 --> 18:14.800
No, no, Dan, actually, I do. Yeah, yeah, this is like the best moment of my life right

18:14.800 --> 18:15.800
here.

18:15.800 --> 18:23.320
Yeah, I don't know if it's that or I'm like, I watched it, I watched it. But it is cool.

18:23.320 --> 18:28.080
I like that's great. Congratulations. Thank you so much. And CISO is obviously, we're

18:28.080 --> 18:35.600
all, we're all in the same boat here. Yeah. I got to be a female sword. Yeah. Oh, yeah,

18:35.600 --> 18:45.320
your episode of watch Harmon Quest. The most amazing wordplay ever in the history, but

18:45.320 --> 18:50.120
it's that it's because the guy's name is Sinex, but he gets his snout cut off and Rhea goes

18:50.120 --> 18:58.840
Sinex infection. I think it was like in real time. Now that's Sinex infection. Yeah. That's

18:58.840 --> 19:04.360
the thing from the show. It's from the show. Yeah. Oh man, that was great. You know, Spencer.

19:04.360 --> 19:07.800
Hey, Spencer. How are you doing? I have a question about Take My Wife. Can I ask a

19:07.800 --> 19:14.400
question about Take My Wife? Please. How did you decide your characterizations of a married

19:14.400 --> 19:19.680
couple? Because obviously you could do, oh, it's just going to be us, but then maybe you

19:19.680 --> 19:23.000
want to make things more arch, but then also you might have been like, well, let's write

19:23.000 --> 19:26.480
these characters and they'll be based on us, but they'll be characters for the point of

19:26.480 --> 19:31.480
plots and stuff. And then obviously, you know, you're being a married couple on television.

19:31.480 --> 19:35.320
So that comes into play too. So I'm wondering like, what was your thinking there? Well,

19:35.320 --> 19:41.960
I mean, the way we wrote it was we wrote all the, like basically that season is all stuff

19:41.960 --> 19:47.880
that happened. And then some of it is fictionalized so that people aren't like, Hey, that was

19:47.880 --> 19:53.520
me. You know, so like it's all, some people are like amalgams of experiences and stuff

19:53.520 --> 19:57.960
like that. But it's, I think Cameron calls it like, I don't even remember, like fictionally

19:57.960 --> 20:03.360
autobiographical or something like that. Yeah. Like everything actually happens. So I mean,

20:03.360 --> 20:07.440
the thing about the show is it's kind of the lead up to us being married. So we're not

20:07.440 --> 20:12.920
married yet. And it's really us figuring ourselves out within a relationship. And I mean, we

20:12.920 --> 20:17.320
just sort of wrote out all the stories that we wanted to cover. And in doing that, we

20:17.320 --> 20:21.840
sort of found the characters of Cameron and Rhea there. So it wasn't ever anything where

20:21.840 --> 20:25.280
we're like, okay, well, this, like Rhea is going to be this and Cameron is going to be

20:25.280 --> 20:30.360
this. It just sort of organically happened through all that stuff out there. And you

20:30.360 --> 20:36.240
know, I just, I just didn't have this conversation, but this thing came up because I didn't know

20:36.240 --> 20:44.800
how it, what, what was, what to think about it. But it's a person I know is, is finishing

20:44.800 --> 20:52.040
a pilot and I'm a character in it. The, the, the, and it's like, it, it's like these days,

20:52.040 --> 20:56.520
I mean, it's like there's a confessional kind of mandate, the golden age of TV or post golden

20:56.520 --> 21:01.160
age or sacking of TV, whatever's going on right now. The, the, it's kind of like incumbent

21:01.160 --> 21:06.480
upon people for our audiences of a maximum of a million people that it actually does

21:06.480 --> 21:11.080
need to be a little bit, what needs to be passionate, it needs to be personal, it needs

21:11.080 --> 21:14.440
to be sincere. That doesn't automatically mean it needs to be autobiographical. But then

21:14.440 --> 21:18.200
again, it's like kind of the easiest thing to do right now. And TV's never been about

21:18.200 --> 21:22.040
fighting like and struggling and in terms of the idea. So the easiest thing to do right

21:22.040 --> 21:26.240
now is to go, this is me. This is like my world. And this is, this is, that's been a

21:26.240 --> 21:31.360
main staple of TV anyway. This has been going through the Carsey Warner filter of like, oh,

21:31.360 --> 21:35.520
your standup says you like to use tools. Here's your fictional wife. Here's your set.

21:35.520 --> 21:39.880
But, but, but, so we're still at the core of the demand is for, in television is for

21:39.880 --> 21:42.160
real people. Why did you just explain that, Dan?

21:42.160 --> 21:46.360
I would just be like a jacket saleswoman or something, you know what I mean?

21:46.360 --> 21:51.080
But the funny thing is the person knows it. So I'm a character in this person's script.

21:51.080 --> 21:56.280
And it's important that I'm 43. It's important that I, I'm at a kind of a more comfortable

21:56.280 --> 22:03.440
place in my career than this person is. It's, there's so many details about, about it being

22:03.440 --> 22:08.960
me that make it, that are important to where that, to the situation this person is in,

22:08.960 --> 22:14.600
but it's kind of dumb to go through it and go, make it flan farman. And, but, but, but,

22:14.600 --> 22:18.560
but the one, but the thing is then there's a shot where the person is looking at a wall

22:18.560 --> 22:24.000
of my house and there's like a community poster and all the things like just the things like

22:24.000 --> 22:30.960
community and whatever else I've done. The, the, there's an Emmy, I guess, I don't know.

22:30.960 --> 22:38.840
As far as Oscars, Hugh Jackman hosted, won an Emmy for writing the Oscars. I try not

22:38.840 --> 22:45.160
to bring it up, but, but, but I was like, I read the thing and I was like, oh, you should

22:45.160 --> 22:53.920
change like community to like crazy community college show. I don't know what it was. I

22:53.920 --> 22:59.960
just think that's an interesting concept when we're doing these like weird, like meta things

22:59.960 --> 23:02.920
like what is the rule there? It's kind of like why you ask the question, right? Like,

23:02.920 --> 23:06.680
what do you, what do you, you know, we were in great minds, obviously. And also, I don't

23:06.680 --> 23:11.520
think great care was taken in our characterizations beforehand. They just kind of grew out of the

23:11.520 --> 23:14.960
storyline. So I was just curious. I don't know. Yeah. It's interesting because it's

23:14.960 --> 23:18.320
like, you start with a dynamic like, like, so it's like, oh, it was important that you

23:18.320 --> 23:21.800
were working for me and everything kind of bloomed out of that. Yeah. So you get me as

23:21.800 --> 23:31.000
like this weird Jack Donaghy to your Liz Lemon. But yeah, it's, it's, it's funny. But boy,

23:31.000 --> 23:37.000
boy, writing about myself is fascinating. Oh yeah. I got Madeline, don't you think it's

23:37.000 --> 23:46.040
fascinating? solid no on that one. That makes it when she lets you know things are going

23:46.040 --> 23:50.640
good and you feel it. Oh yeah. No, I because she's not, she hasn't developed a moral conscience

23:50.640 --> 23:56.800
yet. She won't even know what a handshake is. No, she has no reason. She will not smoke

23:56.800 --> 24:05.480
up your ass. She's like, I like it. I didn't like it. I mean, it's like, like, like, there's

24:05.480 --> 24:09.000
certain demographic things that make me go like, well, who cares? It's like, you're not,

24:09.000 --> 24:16.040
you know, I'm not going to do a show about the times tables. I don't care. I don't care

24:16.040 --> 24:26.120
what these people find entertaining. I have to express myself. Absolutely. So anyways,

24:26.120 --> 24:46.480
you guys hear about these itsy bitsy spiders? She's doing it. She's doing it with her fingers.

24:46.480 --> 24:56.800
Well now I want one. If they're going to get 20 bucks, then 20 bucks. 20 bucks. Oh man.

24:56.800 --> 25:01.640
All right. Well, oh, oh, oh, oh, hey. Oh yeah, we could, yeah, let's, let's do that. I like

25:01.640 --> 25:17.080
it because I'm, I'm in my wife, Cameron Esposito. Your wife. She's here. Here, you check this

25:17.080 --> 25:21.960
one. Hey, hi. Hello, the audience. This is Madeline. Hey, Madeline. This is Madeline. Yeah. She

25:21.960 --> 25:26.520
was just doing a real cool itsy bitsy spider a second ago. You know what? I saw it and

25:26.520 --> 25:37.280
you are legit very good at that. It was my idea. It's my idea. I brought it. I came

25:37.280 --> 25:42.280
up with it. I didn't create it, but I, story by, I adapted it. Definitely like a story by

25:42.280 --> 25:49.200
story by for sure. Have you ever gone on a bear hunt, Madeline? Like in, in, yeah, because

25:49.200 --> 25:51.760
you haven't been, they don't do it. They don't do that stuff in flamenco school. They're

25:51.760 --> 25:57.680
like, you warm up. This isn't kindergarten. Start flamenco. What if she had though, Dan?

25:57.680 --> 26:01.600
What if she had, what does she have on an actual bear hunt and was like, oh, a real one? Oh,

26:01.600 --> 26:04.600
no, but I was talking about that. You, did you, you know, I probably missed this. You

26:04.600 --> 26:08.560
guys never like in kindergarten or nursery school, like there was like this. I don't know.

26:08.560 --> 26:12.520
There was this thing. I don't think they could still do this. The kids would. You think the

26:12.520 --> 26:18.320
internet replaced this? Well, this was before my time, I think. I mean, it seemed very problematic.

26:18.320 --> 26:22.200
The teacher, we go, we're going on a bear hunt, bear hunt, bear hunt. I don't know if there

26:22.200 --> 26:25.520
was like a chant to it or not, but they would, there was a lot of call and response and they

26:25.520 --> 26:29.200
would, so the kids would all go like this. And then they go like, oh, we got to go across

26:29.200 --> 26:30.760
the stream. There's a stream.

26:30.760 --> 26:35.080
That's true.

26:35.080 --> 26:38.000
Isn't everything.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.800
I mean, you know, everything's an exercise of conformity.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.680
Especially public school.

26:42.680 --> 26:51.480
Keep, keep in mind, sir, a bear gets hunted and becomes the hunter, not to spoil it, but

26:51.480 --> 26:54.720
you go on the whole bear hunt and you see the bear and the bear comes after you and

26:54.720 --> 26:58.480
you run and you do all the other stuff. I think, I think it's more an exercise in like

26:58.480 --> 27:02.840
story structure because it's like, makes you go backward and forward through a thing. You,

27:02.840 --> 27:06.880
you take note of the things you do while you get to the bear. You meet with the goddess

27:06.880 --> 27:12.040
of seeing the bear. You atone with the father of realizing the bear found you. You recharge

27:12.040 --> 27:16.840
back across the return threshold and you go home having changed into a kid that, that

27:16.840 --> 27:20.520
didn't set fire to the gymnasium.

27:20.520 --> 27:26.120
Definitely, definitely storytelling's primary function is to keep young people from burning

27:26.120 --> 27:29.760
down whatever white houses are in the vicinity.

27:29.760 --> 27:30.760
Absolutely.

27:30.760 --> 27:34.600
Ideally directing your energy towards a cultural other. Like that's what Campbell says, like

27:34.600 --> 27:40.280
especially like adolescent boys need to be like told. The reason why you not only think

27:40.280 --> 27:45.200
you could destroy everything right now, but probably could is because of a great thunder

27:45.200 --> 27:52.600
god that the neighbors really don't want you to achieve. So hate them and, and, and go

27:52.600 --> 28:02.240
to, go to math class and register for selective service to the draft, Madeline. If you, if

28:02.240 --> 28:07.000
you get drafted, it'll be against cool space bugs.

28:07.000 --> 28:11.200
You're going to get a jet pack when you get drafted.

28:11.200 --> 28:19.360
It's all right. It's okay. Look, this is going to happen. It's live podcasting. People are

28:19.360 --> 28:23.800
going to, people, there's going to, there's going to be contention.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.800
Whoa.

28:25.800 --> 28:31.360
Oh no.

28:31.360 --> 28:35.960
We don't have security here. By the way, we have like a kid that works in the Alan Moore

28:35.960 --> 28:42.600
section. That's just, he's scary, but he's doesn't, he's not, he's doesn't do anything.

28:42.600 --> 28:44.600
Usually he just watches the watch.

28:44.600 --> 28:45.600
Yeah.

28:45.600 --> 28:48.600
Oh, that's who does it.

28:48.600 --> 28:49.600
I don't know.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.640
That's who does that.

28:51.640 --> 28:55.440
He watches the watch, but in a typical Alan Moore fashion, he doesn't really enjoy it

28:55.440 --> 28:56.440
very much.

28:56.440 --> 28:58.760
It's like, this could have been better.

28:58.760 --> 29:04.840
All right. Madeline's, she's, she's usually dance the one that gets bulletproof.

29:04.840 --> 29:07.840
Now she's warmed up.

29:07.840 --> 29:14.280
So Madeline, all right. What's the scariest thing? I'm asking not just because I want

29:14.280 --> 29:16.480
to scare a child.

29:16.480 --> 29:23.120
I have other guests coming soon and there's a fear of, a theme of fear. So I'm just wondering,

29:23.120 --> 29:29.000
is there something that scares you? Like, I could, I could, I'll tell you, spiders scare

29:29.000 --> 29:45.200
me a lot and clowns and, and, and I guess, I guess like leaving the house, getting into

29:45.200 --> 29:49.320
a shower when, and not knowing that the water is going to get like really hot after I get

29:49.320 --> 29:50.320
into it.

29:50.320 --> 29:56.680
I like this person who's trying to put words in a child's mouth.

29:56.680 --> 30:07.960
Is that the same person who was like conformity? Failure. I do whatever. Listen kids, say failure.

30:07.960 --> 30:12.280
It's Donald Trump's political advisor.

30:12.280 --> 30:16.360
I saw a thing on a TV ad and the volume was down. So I don't even know, and it's kind

30:16.360 --> 30:20.960
of cool to not know whether this was a Democratic ad or like a splinter Republican ad, but it

30:20.960 --> 30:24.560
was just like, I just saw a bunch of images of Donald Trump and then it was, and then

30:24.560 --> 30:30.000
it was a negative ad and it said like, Donald Trump, dangerous. And I was like, I liked

30:30.000 --> 30:33.880
the fact that I didn't know, that could have been like some weird like group of like Republicans

30:33.880 --> 30:38.520
that was like, not weird, like, I guess more normal than the rest like going like, but

30:38.520 --> 30:45.520
I like that. I like this car. It made me happy because, because I feel like if, if we can

30:45.520 --> 30:50.680
admit that we don't like a guy because dangerous, like that's actually, there's a little like

30:50.680 --> 30:54.240
lobe in my head that goes like, wait, you should be dangerous. And then I go, wait a

30:54.240 --> 30:57.440
minute. No, we want to be comfortable and we need to admit that more. We need to be

30:57.440 --> 31:02.960
less hyperbolic about our politics and more like practical and go like, look, look at

31:02.960 --> 31:09.120
this guy. He's a turd. Like that's scary. Vote for not scary. Like you always do anyway,

31:09.120 --> 31:12.520
except you pat yourself on the back afterwards and put on a cape and say, I did something

31:12.520 --> 31:17.520
heroic today by voting for comfort. Like, I think it, you know, like, we're, we're right.

31:17.520 --> 31:21.520
There's like good dangerous and bad dangerous. Like when people talk about Hillary and I

31:21.520 --> 31:27.400
know people are going to be shocked to find out that I like her. Um, when people talk

31:27.400 --> 31:30.520
about Hillary, they talk about her being dangerous, but it's because people will be

31:30.520 --> 31:34.840
like, cause she's done like backdoor deals with everybody and she's probably responsible

31:34.840 --> 31:42.800
for a lot of murders and she has single handedly met and done every, and I'm like, yeah, sounds

31:42.800 --> 31:50.480
like a president. Like sounds like a person that runs this country since the first time

31:50.480 --> 31:56.120
that somebody was like, you, you should run this country. Hey, old wooden tooth. Yeah.

31:56.120 --> 32:02.520
Hey, you own people. Do you want to run this place? I mean, like that's, and then, but

32:02.520 --> 32:08.720
then it's funny cause now, so there, I feel like that's like dangerous in the way that

32:08.720 --> 32:13.480
our country has always, that's us. I'm not saying we're great. We have a lot of stuff

32:13.480 --> 32:18.280
we can improve on, but that's definitely us. Like that's for sure us. We're terrible.

32:18.280 --> 32:23.720
We are, we're the worst. We don't own this place. We stole this place. This blocks the

32:23.720 --> 32:28.320
meltdown. Um, no, like we don't know this. We stole this place. We're, we've always

32:28.320 --> 32:34.320
been dangerous. Then it, then he is dangerous in relief to that because his thing is like,

32:34.320 --> 32:45.360
haha, I could upload it up, right? Why wouldn't I use the nuclear weapons? Yeah, like, like,

32:45.360 --> 32:53.480
why can't I, why can't we got them? They've just spent a lot of money. Yeah. I mean,

32:53.480 --> 32:57.980
it is, it is a time in which we've, uh, yeah, I, I, I shamefully find myself just craving

32:57.980 --> 33:01.520
status quo, which I've done a level that I never have. Cause it's like, you're looking

33:01.520 --> 33:06.680
down the gaping ma of actual historical like things where you go like, Oh, this is, as

33:06.680 --> 33:12.160
I've said, and I really again, unashamed, like it's fine. Hitler comparisons are fine.

33:12.160 --> 33:16.040
The earlier, the better. That's the point of them. Hitler, the healthy version of a

33:16.040 --> 33:20.680
Hitler comparison is the earliest one in the world, the most premature one. Imagine if

33:20.680 --> 33:24.680
the Hitler comparison had happened early on in Hitler's career. If someone had gone,

33:24.680 --> 33:30.120
this guy's Hitler, uh, uh, then, you know, they, they, I don't know. Well, there's also

33:30.120 --> 33:33.040
like two different types of dangerous. There's like, so there's like, there's like Hitler

33:33.040 --> 33:45.320
dangerous. And then there's also like, like if you think about a spot. Oh shit. Madeline

33:45.320 --> 33:50.040
came down. She said it. Sorry. She said like three minutes ago. I want to talk now. I was

33:50.040 --> 33:54.080
like, you can talk if you want to. And then all right, Madeline, let's, let's, let's hear

33:54.080 --> 33:59.280
it. I mean, I guess what I'm saying is women are the future clearly. What were you going

33:59.280 --> 34:06.120
to say, Madeline? Oh, you just said it. You just said blah, blah, blah. You just, I mean,

34:06.120 --> 34:09.200
I can't tell you your four or so. I don't know if that's mocking us or if that's actually

34:09.200 --> 34:14.920
like half of what you know how to say. Oh no, it's mocking us. I feel like for the podcast,

34:14.920 --> 34:21.560
she's going to sound even younger, like an actual baby was up here. Uh, well, maybe that

34:21.560 --> 34:31.560
will be next week. Oh yeah. Uh, hey, Madeline, uh, I heard that you are a fart head. Oh

34:31.560 --> 34:40.840
boy. I don't know that this is healthy. It's actually okay. There are adult men mouth a

34:40.840 --> 34:52.080
gape at that. I just, I looked at this dude specifically and he went like, it's actually

34:52.080 --> 34:53.800
right. Tudes fired. It's actually right up our alley. Do you want to tell them our nickname

34:53.800 --> 35:00.080
for each other? Okay. Well, then I'll tell them cause you're a butt head. Oh boy. I call

35:00.080 --> 35:04.920
each other butt heads and stuff. All right. Well, we have to make room for my, my neighbors

35:04.920 --> 35:11.920
are coming up and they have a special, uh, you guys remember Beth Bootson, right? Oh

35:11.920 --> 35:19.000
no. Oh, this is the dark side of show business. No, Madeline, you're still going to be, you're

35:19.000 --> 35:30.600
going to be right there. Oh God. Oh, Spencer gets to be proven right again. Yeah man. But

35:30.600 --> 35:35.640
think about this Spencer, if we hadn't gone through all of that, no show. It's not that

35:35.640 --> 35:40.720
I'm happy about being right all the time. It's just that I see it when it's going to

35:40.720 --> 35:45.120
happen. Yeah. Yeah. But what if I saw it too? What was I supposed to do? I did the, the

35:45.120 --> 35:50.600
spot. What was I supposed to do? No, it's great. This is a great show. Let's, how, how

35:50.600 --> 35:57.040
is it? How about that? Take my wife? Uh, don't you guys have a hard out not that long. Yeah.

35:57.040 --> 36:00.960
I can't. Cameron, there's a, there's a, there's a scene in Take My Wife where you're out at

36:00.960 --> 36:06.280
lunch and you're in like an outdoor, uh, restaurant. Oh, I can't. I'm sorry, Madeline. Here, you'll

36:06.280 --> 36:11.000
be okay. She did great. I just, I just don't know. I didn't like the sound of my own voice

36:11.000 --> 36:15.040
talking at the same time as a, as a person that was like sobbing and I'm like, like I'm

36:15.040 --> 36:22.760
ignoring it. Like it's some Orwellian thing. I'm sort of a get that baby out of here. Oh

36:22.760 --> 36:27.160
man. That's what, that's why I'm like, I'm like, I can't let anybody know. Now I know why. Let's not do

36:27.160 --> 36:35.480
that. Yeah. When we say we're okay with this, we don't change our stance. I've, I've, I love it.

36:35.480 --> 36:41.040
This is what America is all about. Uh, I learned from a hit Pixar movie, uh, that, that feeling

36:41.040 --> 36:49.000
sad is just as much a part of life as feeling good. Yeah. And I, and I, and I, and I learned

36:49.000 --> 36:57.600
that while losing my Oscar. And I thought, that's fine. That's what that movie that took

36:57.600 --> 37:06.720
my Oscar, uh, said. This is fine. And I cried and I loved it. The mom, the mom was controlled

37:06.720 --> 37:17.800
by sadness. Great film. So there's a scene where your, uh, Cameron's out on a, uh, she's

37:17.800 --> 37:23.240
eating lunch at an outdoor, uh, cafe, but there's like, it's, and, and Ria's blowing up in the,

37:23.240 --> 37:26.360
and then there's like, there's one shot of you and it's like pushing on you and you're

37:26.360 --> 37:29.640
like, or I don't think it's pushing on you. It's just like the static. There's no music

37:29.640 --> 37:35.240
and it's just you by yourself at a restaurant. Like, do you, do you, do you, do you like

37:35.240 --> 37:39.600
the, do you, do you know the, like expression I'm thinking of? Like when you're like, you're

37:39.600 --> 37:45.120
kind of like, is it just you? Like, are you, are you going through like, like, is it, is

37:45.120 --> 37:51.680
it, is it like, it's like a, it's like a, cause we're, cause we're, cause we're not specifically

37:51.680 --> 37:55.240
tracking in that moment that it's, it's like, are you just uncomfortable in your own skin?

37:55.240 --> 37:56.240
Like you're, cause you're alone.

37:56.240 --> 37:57.240
Yes. Yeah.

37:57.240 --> 38:04.920
Right. No. That I actually know exactly what you're asking. Um, yeah, it's supposed to

38:04.920 --> 38:10.160
be not knowing where to focus energy, right? So like, I'm just sitting by myself alone

38:10.160 --> 38:15.160
at a cafe and thinking, maybe I see somebody that I know, right? Like awkwardly waving

38:15.160 --> 38:20.920
there and then I kind of like hide and, uh, crawl inside of myself and right after you

38:20.920 --> 38:24.800
do that, you like wave and you go, no, like that. And then a leaf falls in the background.

38:24.800 --> 38:29.160
I guess I obviously wasn't planned, but I love it so much. Why do you think that wasn't

38:29.160 --> 38:35.280
planned? Like dead leaf, just fault the last, I was, I told it to do that. We had a serious

38:35.280 --> 38:41.280
rig and they were like, let the leaf go. Get the one leaf. Get the leaf. Get the leaf.

38:41.280 --> 38:42.280
It's like 10. Okay.

38:42.280 --> 38:43.280
Okay.

38:43.280 --> 38:45.280
Leave to one and bring the leaf to one.

38:45.280 --> 38:49.280
Bring the leaf to one and leaf it.

38:49.280 --> 38:54.280
Leave it. Action.

38:54.280 --> 39:00.280
The leaf industry doesn't have more precise language than this thing. And leaf it. Well,

39:00.280 --> 39:06.280
that could mean 5,000 things. I'm a union employee who solely focuses on leaves and you

39:06.280 --> 39:12.280
just say leaf it. Do you want to blow across a detective's driveway?

39:12.280 --> 39:19.280
I would love to see the leaf person on like every show, just like leaf blowers attached

39:19.280 --> 39:20.280
to the belt.

39:20.280 --> 39:24.280
It seems like the leaf person on a set is one of those jobs that has a name that doesn't

39:24.280 --> 39:27.280
have leaf or a Latin like root of leaf.

39:27.280 --> 39:28.280
Rare.

39:28.280 --> 39:33.280
Something like a squibbler. And you find out it's the leaf wrangler. And if you ever

39:33.280 --> 39:34.280
call him that.

39:34.280 --> 39:35.280
Or her.

39:35.280 --> 39:40.280
Absolutely. Thank you, Dan. Great point. Great point. That's a great point.

39:40.280 --> 39:46.280
That's amazing. That's amazing. You know, you didn't have to use that second pronoun.

39:46.280 --> 39:49.280
You did. And that shows you here.

39:49.280 --> 39:50.280
Not bad.

39:50.280 --> 39:51.280
That's amazing.

39:51.280 --> 39:52.280
That's really what we mean.

39:52.280 --> 39:54.280
The acknowledgement of women.

39:54.280 --> 39:55.280
Right.

39:55.280 --> 39:58.280
There sure are women.

39:58.280 --> 40:05.280
Do you know what is right next year? Dan, did you see our not appointing this way?

40:05.280 --> 40:08.280
There's a billboard with our dumb faces on it.

40:08.280 --> 40:09.280
Oh yeah.

40:09.280 --> 40:12.280
Actually, I didn't know there was one here in this neighborhood, but I saw it.

40:12.280 --> 40:14.280
Oh yeah, right by the Chipotle.

40:14.280 --> 40:20.280
You guys took me off. You replaced me. That's great. That's what it should be.

40:20.280 --> 40:24.280
That's what television should be, I think, right?

40:24.280 --> 40:33.280
Replacing you with me a white male. Yeah, that's what we need.

40:33.280 --> 40:38.280
I think. Thank you. Thank you.

40:38.280 --> 40:43.280
I just want to acknowledge that two dudes are being applauded for their bravery.

40:43.280 --> 40:45.280
Oh, no, we are very brave.

40:45.280 --> 40:53.280
In acknowledging that women are cool and you guys are pretty light on the claps for Rhea and I.

40:53.280 --> 40:58.280
No, we went and we asked a stranger to take a picture.

40:58.280 --> 41:02.280
We just stopped a stranger and we went over to the billboard and we were standing in front of it.

41:02.280 --> 41:06.280
And we asked a woman who was passing by, we were like, hey, do you mind taking a picture of us?

41:06.280 --> 41:11.280
And she was like, oh sure, like just what, like in front of what?

41:11.280 --> 41:16.280
Because we were like just on the street and then we were like, um.

41:16.280 --> 41:20.280
And it was actually so cute because she goes, oh my god, you guys!

41:20.280 --> 41:27.280
She gave us a giant hug and like, this is a stranger. We did not know this person.

41:27.280 --> 41:33.280
Was it, was it, oh my god, you guys, I didn't recognize you and I actually knew you from before?

41:33.280 --> 41:36.280
Or is it, oh my god, you're two other human beings and you're on that billboard?

41:36.280 --> 41:40.280
Yeah, she was like, I'm so proud of you! You're making it!

41:40.280 --> 41:46.280
I'm so proud of you! Who are you?

41:46.280 --> 41:50.280
It was very cute. It was like a cute moment. She took a bunch of pictures.

41:50.280 --> 41:53.280
She was like, check them, make sure you check them.

41:53.280 --> 41:57.280
I don't want to be the one to mess this up for you!

41:57.280 --> 42:03.280
And then a guy was like running headphones came by and he went, hey, that's you!

42:03.280 --> 42:08.280
Because he had his headphones in and he was like this close and I was like, yeah, yeah, thank you.

42:08.280 --> 42:10.280
He yelled it so loud.

42:10.280 --> 42:12.280
It was really horrible. It was fun.

42:12.280 --> 42:13.280
But also loud.

42:13.280 --> 42:16.280
It was super fun. It was a fun time.

42:16.280 --> 42:18.280
I don't know, I don't think, except maybe in cartoon form, there was a Harmon Quest billboard.

42:18.280 --> 42:22.280
I don't think I've ever, that's a feeling I don't know.

42:22.280 --> 42:26.280
I don't know, like, look, there's your bed's all big.

42:26.280 --> 42:29.280
It feels pretty good.

42:29.280 --> 42:33.280
Okay, I don't even know. Do you pull over the car?

42:33.280 --> 42:35.280
Oh yeah, we parked and got Chipotle.

42:35.280 --> 42:41.280
We literally did eat that at the Chipotle that's directly under the thing of us, which is like shameful.

42:41.280 --> 42:45.280
Were you able to just look at it while you ate?

42:45.280 --> 42:51.280
We went around the corner so that we were not near there, but there definitely were people who were eating at Chipotle that were like...

42:51.280 --> 42:57.280
There's something very familiar about all this.

42:57.280 --> 43:03.280
I have to get a quote in for Back to the Future at some point.

43:03.280 --> 43:11.280
Alright, so you guys, I heard a rumor that you guys needed to get out of here at 9.

43:11.280 --> 43:14.280
I do, you can stay, yeah?

43:14.280 --> 43:16.280
I can stay, yeah.

43:16.280 --> 43:18.280
I mean, I didn't mean to put you on this one.

43:18.280 --> 43:20.280
No, yeah, you can, I'll meet you at home.

43:20.280 --> 43:22.280
We live together.

43:22.280 --> 43:24.280
We live together.

43:24.280 --> 43:32.280
I'm ready to teach Donald Trump a thing or two about being dangerous.

43:36.280 --> 43:39.280
Yes, I live with my wife.

43:39.280 --> 43:40.280
Yeah.

43:40.280 --> 43:42.280
So dangerous.

43:42.280 --> 43:46.280
You missed me proving that I've seen the first episode of the show before you got here.

43:46.280 --> 43:47.280
He did prove it.

43:47.280 --> 43:48.280
And then I liked it very much.

43:48.280 --> 43:49.280
He liked it very much.

43:49.280 --> 43:54.280
We are so stoked because it got, like, a bunch of people cared about it.

43:54.280 --> 43:57.280
And I mean, honestly, you know what this is like.

43:57.280 --> 44:02.280
This was the first time for me, you spent a lot of time and space in television,

44:02.280 --> 44:06.280
and you know that a lot of things nobody, a bunch of people were like, cool.

44:06.280 --> 44:08.280
And then we were like, awesome.

44:08.280 --> 44:10.280
Thank you guys.

44:10.280 --> 44:18.280
Yeah, and there may be a time when that nightmare that you were maybe dreading,

44:18.280 --> 44:20.280
that'll have to happen too.

44:20.280 --> 44:24.280
But both of them will be like, you'll wake up the next morning alive.

44:24.280 --> 44:26.280
It's like a bingo card.

44:26.280 --> 44:31.280
I remember this thing that we did, this pilot in the 90s.

44:31.280 --> 44:33.280
And it was just like, no, we don't want that.

44:33.280 --> 44:35.280
And like, I don't want that.

44:35.280 --> 44:40.280
It just went to the car.

44:40.280 --> 44:45.280
It was a really, it was a good thing because it was like my salty hot tears.

44:45.280 --> 44:47.280
I was like, I'm not crying because I'm a spoiled baby.

44:47.280 --> 44:50.280
I am a spoiled baby, but that's not why I'm crying.

44:50.280 --> 44:53.280
I'm crying because I really, really care.

44:53.280 --> 44:54.280
And that's a good thing.

44:54.280 --> 44:58.280
And it's like, there is, you're not receptive to it in that moment.

44:58.280 --> 45:02.280
It does nothing feels like you're getting good or better.

45:02.280 --> 45:07.280
But what is happening in that moment is like the germination of some kind of seed where you're like,

45:07.280 --> 45:09.280
well, one thing's for sure, I belong here.

45:09.280 --> 45:16.280
Because this is like, I don't like people not watching me.

45:16.280 --> 45:20.280
There's no romantic or charismatic way to put it.

45:20.280 --> 45:24.280
I actually think maybe this was the first experience I've had in my career that wasn't that.

45:24.280 --> 45:28.280
And I don't mean that like, of course, it's been bit by bit.

45:28.280 --> 45:32.280
And success by success, it's not like I've been toiling in obscurity.

45:32.280 --> 45:36.280
But for 15 years, I feel like there have been very loud noises,

45:36.280 --> 45:38.280
very loud voices that really liked what I was doing,

45:38.280 --> 45:41.280
and very loud voices that wanted me to stop talking about being gay.

45:41.280 --> 45:45.280
And that that was like a thing that I heard just so many times,

45:45.280 --> 45:48.280
just like, this person is not funny, stop talking about being gay.

45:48.280 --> 45:49.280
We don't care about this.

45:49.280 --> 45:50.280
And then-

45:50.280 --> 45:51.280
We get it.

45:51.280 --> 45:52.280
Yeah, we get it.

45:52.280 --> 45:53.280
You're gay.

45:53.280 --> 45:54.280
We get it.

45:54.280 --> 45:55.280
You're gay.

45:55.280 --> 45:56.280
We get it.

45:56.280 --> 45:58.280
You guys will be my epitaph, like for sure.

45:58.280 --> 45:59.280
It should be your-

45:59.280 --> 46:00.280
No, it should be-

46:00.280 --> 46:01.280
We got it.

46:01.280 --> 46:02.280
She was gay.

46:02.280 --> 46:03.280
Yeah.

46:03.280 --> 46:04.280
No, I know.

46:04.280 --> 46:06.280
I have tweeted.

46:06.280 --> 46:09.280
No, I mean, that will be my epitaph.

46:09.280 --> 46:10.280
Butch-tag dead.

46:10.280 --> 46:11.280
But you know.

46:14.280 --> 46:17.280
But this was really like a huge weight off the shoulders,

46:17.280 --> 46:21.280
because like the New York Times and Vulture and Indie Wire and Navy Club were just like,

46:21.280 --> 46:22.280
we get it.

46:22.280 --> 46:23.280
She's gay.

46:23.280 --> 46:24.280
But they were like, we get it.

46:24.280 --> 46:25.280
She's gay.

46:25.280 --> 46:27.280
And I was like, so it was really nuts.

46:27.280 --> 46:28.280
So was the other one.

46:28.280 --> 46:29.280
Yeah.

46:31.280 --> 46:33.280
I'm just talking about my experience.

46:33.280 --> 46:34.280
Oh, I know.

46:34.280 --> 46:35.280
I'm just riffing.

46:35.280 --> 46:36.280
That's all.

46:36.280 --> 46:37.280
Yeah.

46:37.280 --> 46:38.280
I don't think-

46:38.280 --> 46:41.280
I'm not Dr. Phil, but I don't think Rhea was saying that you were trans-

46:41.280 --> 46:42.280
I thought-

46:42.280 --> 46:43.280
Anyways, alright.

46:44.280 --> 46:45.280
Well, you-

46:45.280 --> 46:46.280
We'll deal with this later.

46:46.280 --> 46:47.280
You know.

46:48.280 --> 46:49.280
Somebody-

46:49.280 --> 46:52.280
People are also really stoked about Rhea in this show, which is really cool.

46:52.280 --> 46:55.280
It's like a real breakout moment for her, and it's really awesome.

46:58.280 --> 47:01.280
Well, I assume that's going to be a theme of the-

47:04.280 --> 47:06.280
Is that going to be the theme of the show?

47:06.280 --> 47:09.280
Because I've seen one episode, but is that a thing?

47:09.280 --> 47:16.280
I mean, regardless of gender persuasion, what are the other things?

47:16.280 --> 47:22.280
Prismatology, cosmological shiftage.

47:22.280 --> 47:26.280
Continuum of repus-

47:30.280 --> 47:34.280
Regardless of two people doing the same thing at the same time,

47:34.280 --> 47:38.280
automatically, is there a story coming up?

47:38.280 --> 47:40.280
And if not, is there-

47:40.280 --> 47:42.280
Well, is there-

47:42.280 --> 47:46.280
People want to drive a wedge between those things.

47:46.280 --> 47:49.280
We eat lobster by breaking it open.

47:49.280 --> 47:52.280
If you guys are delicious as a couple,

47:52.280 --> 47:58.280
inevitably, the consuming of you as a couple is going to involve people

47:58.280 --> 48:04.280
testing the hinges of the claw, putting pressure on the-

48:04.280 --> 48:06.280
Have you experienced that?

48:06.280 --> 48:08.280
Do you know that's coming?

48:08.280 --> 48:09.280
Yeah.

48:09.280 --> 48:11.280
I mean, I think it's been there the whole time.

48:11.280 --> 48:14.280
People will ask us if we're competitive with each other,

48:14.280 --> 48:17.280
which is the funniest thing to ask to stand-up comics,

48:17.280 --> 48:20.280
because you wouldn't do this job

48:20.280 --> 48:26.280
if you didn't think you were the best stand-up comic to ever exist, period.

48:26.280 --> 48:30.280
Like, there's no other reason you would do this to yourself,

48:30.280 --> 48:32.280
and also it's a total privilege in what a ridiculous thing say,

48:32.280 --> 48:35.280
but I just mean, you wouldn't get up on stage and fail this much

48:35.280 --> 48:37.280
if you weren't like, I'll show them.

48:37.280 --> 48:42.280
So, Ria, do you think you're a better stand-up comic than me?

48:42.280 --> 48:44.280
Absolutely.

48:44.280 --> 48:45.280
Yeah.

48:45.280 --> 48:47.280
No, but like you do, right?

48:47.280 --> 48:48.280
Yeah, of course.

48:48.280 --> 48:52.280
Like, you want what's best for me and you love me so much.

48:52.280 --> 48:54.280
Yeah, yeah, I want you to totally succeed,

48:54.280 --> 48:56.280
but I am going to succeed more than you.

48:56.280 --> 48:57.280
Right.

48:57.280 --> 49:00.280
So what I want to do is, I want to lift you up,

49:00.280 --> 49:02.280
and I want people to see how great you are

49:02.280 --> 49:05.280
and to see you through my eyes and just like to love you,

49:05.280 --> 49:07.280
you want to, you know, put a foot on your face

49:07.280 --> 49:10.280
and kick you back down.

49:10.280 --> 49:13.280
She's like a grappling hook or a fire ladder.

49:13.280 --> 49:14.280
Yeah.

49:14.280 --> 49:17.280
I lift you up, I hook you into something above me

49:17.280 --> 49:20.280
that is soft enough to secure anchor.

49:20.280 --> 49:21.280
I climb over you.

49:21.280 --> 49:23.280
That's exactly right.

49:23.280 --> 49:24.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:24.280 --> 49:25.280
Yeah, but I think what you're,

49:25.280 --> 49:27.280
I thought maybe where you were going was that,

49:27.280 --> 49:29.280
oh, it's actually easier in such a,

49:29.280 --> 49:32.280
when you combine a naturally,

49:32.280 --> 49:36.280
the universe will seek to find Crevice's thing

49:36.280 --> 49:38.280
like being a couple,

49:38.280 --> 49:41.280
that that's entropy and the outside world will do its work

49:41.280 --> 49:43.280
as sure as water does,

49:43.280 --> 49:45.280
you drop anything into a glass of it and the water,

49:45.280 --> 49:46.280
it may look pretty,

49:46.280 --> 49:48.280
but the water is silently going like,

49:48.280 --> 49:50.280
is there a way to pick this apart, you know?

49:50.280 --> 49:52.280
Anyways, that's a tangent,

49:52.280 --> 49:55.280
but I'll tell it to my chemist.

49:55.280 --> 50:01.280
Dan's actually incorrect about the properties of water.

50:01.280 --> 50:03.280
Subreddit.

50:07.280 --> 50:11.280
But I thought maybe what you were getting at was that,

50:11.280 --> 50:14.280
because stand-ups are so ridiculously solipsistic,

50:14.280 --> 50:17.280
so narcissistic, so like,

50:17.280 --> 50:21.280
that actually it is an easy thing to just put two of them

50:21.280 --> 50:24.280
in a house together and let them both try to be stand-ups

50:24.280 --> 50:28.280
and there's a kind of select few situations

50:28.280 --> 50:33.280
in which that Ernie and Burt partnership could be turned

50:33.280 --> 50:36.280
into like enmity or jealousy,

50:36.280 --> 50:39.280
but those things would be offset if Ernie and Burt were like also,

50:39.280 --> 50:43.280
then they're, okay, we're actually living together

50:43.280 --> 50:45.280
because we love each other.

50:45.280 --> 50:46.280
Like they do.

50:46.280 --> 50:47.280
Yeah, no, right.

50:47.280 --> 50:48.280
They're totally a couple.

50:48.280 --> 50:50.280
But actually, yeah, I think you are right.

50:50.280 --> 50:54.280
I mean, I will say I don't feel a ton of jealousy.

50:54.280 --> 50:56.280
I feel competition in our relationship

50:56.280 --> 50:59.280
and I feel, but I don't feel jealous.

50:59.280 --> 51:00.280
Here's what I worry about.

51:00.280 --> 51:02.280
My girlfriend, here's what I worry about.

51:02.280 --> 51:04.280
I'm not trying to bend it back to me.

51:04.280 --> 51:05.280
Bend it like it.

51:05.280 --> 51:07.280
But if I did, it would go something like this.

51:07.280 --> 51:10.280
The ghost of Jeff is everywhere.

51:10.280 --> 51:13.280
I worry about with Cody,

51:13.280 --> 51:15.280
who's 11, 12 years younger than me,

51:15.280 --> 51:17.280
and who I want, I'm so tired.

51:17.280 --> 51:18.280
I don't want to work.

51:18.280 --> 51:19.280
I swear, I think of that.

51:19.280 --> 51:20.280
I don't want to work anymore.

51:20.280 --> 51:22.280
And I'm like, so I have fantasies about her,

51:22.280 --> 51:23.280
you know, Celine Dionning,

51:23.280 --> 51:25.280
and I can be that guy with the beard

51:25.280 --> 51:28.280
that could just be like, I love Celine Dion.

51:28.280 --> 51:30.280
I'm so old and lucky.

51:30.280 --> 51:32.280
Well, then you should have got to her younger, honestly.

51:32.280 --> 51:35.280
That is a really specific Celine Dion joke.

51:35.280 --> 51:38.280
If you understood Celine like I did,

51:38.280 --> 51:39.280
that would be so funny.

51:39.280 --> 51:41.280
It's okay, we can move on.

51:41.280 --> 51:43.280
But I have a weird feeling.

51:43.280 --> 51:46.280
Could you stop talking about Celine Dion on podcasts?

51:46.280 --> 51:50.280
That's just a joke for anyone that's watched the show.

51:50.280 --> 51:52.280
But yes, go ahead.

51:52.280 --> 51:55.280
I have a weird feeling that I would get,

51:55.280 --> 51:58.280
as soon as it wouldn't be about achievement,

51:58.280 --> 52:00.280
I wouldn't want anybody,

52:00.280 --> 52:02.280
it's not that I don't, wait,

52:02.280 --> 52:04.280
I'm just trying to stack these negatives

52:04.280 --> 52:05.280
like a Jenga tower here.

52:05.280 --> 52:08.280
It's not that I don't want my partner

52:08.280 --> 52:10.280
to be successful, far from it.

52:10.280 --> 52:14.280
I want, like, I consider that such an ironic concept

52:14.280 --> 52:16.280
for anyone to be, as you were talking about,

52:16.280 --> 52:17.280
that same thing.

52:17.280 --> 52:21.280
It's like, that's such a hilarious idea.

52:21.280 --> 52:24.280
I am so behind it.

52:24.280 --> 52:27.280
But at the same time, that feels like sincerity.

52:27.280 --> 52:29.280
Like, oh my God, my fantasy would be

52:29.280 --> 52:34.280
that you would be like, just like,

52:34.280 --> 52:37.280
the idea of me being jealous of someone's success.

52:37.280 --> 52:39.280
Like, I would love that, I would love that.

52:39.280 --> 52:42.280
But I do, and I think the thing that I would screw up

52:42.280 --> 52:45.280
is that I would, it would just be regular jealousy

52:45.280 --> 52:48.280
because I would think, I would turn it into a thing

52:48.280 --> 52:51.280
where I was like, oh, she's out there with people.

52:51.280 --> 52:54.280
It would be a sexual thing.

52:54.280 --> 52:59.280
It wouldn't be, I wouldn't have career jealousy,

52:59.280 --> 53:02.280
but it would quickly turn into a gateway

53:02.280 --> 53:04.280
to something I still haven't figured out,

53:04.280 --> 53:06.280
which is like, how to not be.

53:06.280 --> 53:09.280
Like, I don't trust myself to not be like,

53:09.280 --> 53:11.280
oh, that guy is so cuter.

53:11.280 --> 53:13.280
Like, what, just be with him.

53:13.280 --> 53:15.280
And then it just drives me nuts.

53:15.280 --> 53:17.280
I'm just gonna sit home and play Minecraft

53:17.280 --> 53:19.280
and take care of our baby.

53:19.280 --> 53:21.280
And then I'm just gonna be like,

53:21.280 --> 53:25.280
obviously she would be in love with anybody but me right now.

53:25.280 --> 53:29.280
But don't awe it because that's horrible serial killer stuff

53:29.280 --> 53:31.280
with a support system.

53:31.280 --> 53:32.280
Like, it's not, you shouldn't,

53:32.280 --> 53:34.280
because that's jealousy and it's toxic and it's gross.

53:34.280 --> 53:36.280
I don't mean to tell you that lesbians are awesome,

53:36.280 --> 53:39.280
but you know what's a cool thing about being

53:39.280 --> 53:41.280
in the same sex couple is that...

53:41.280 --> 53:42.280
The scissor thing.

53:42.280 --> 53:43.280
Yeah.

53:43.280 --> 53:47.280
I say no more.

53:47.280 --> 53:48.280
That's number one.

53:48.280 --> 53:49.280
I've seen the movie.

53:49.280 --> 53:51.280
No, that's not real.

53:51.280 --> 53:53.280
That's not real.

53:53.280 --> 53:55.280
That's not a real thing.

53:55.280 --> 53:59.280
Looked real to me.

53:59.280 --> 54:04.280
Riley Reed, ain't no, she didn't...

54:04.280 --> 54:06.280
No, those women are not having good time.

54:06.280 --> 54:09.280
That's not how that works.

54:09.280 --> 54:12.280
I'll tell you about it later, but...

54:12.280 --> 54:14.280
Oh, I think...

54:14.280 --> 54:15.280
I mean, I don't know.

54:15.280 --> 54:17.280
Do you have partner jealousy towards me?

54:17.280 --> 54:18.280
I don't really...

54:18.280 --> 54:20.280
I find that a cool part of it is like...

54:20.280 --> 54:23.280
Well, number one, we are both...

54:23.280 --> 54:26.280
We are both moderately recognizable.

54:26.280 --> 54:28.280
I don't mean we're super famous,

54:28.280 --> 54:30.280
but I mean, most of the time when we meet people,

54:30.280 --> 54:31.280
it's like after a show.

54:31.280 --> 54:33.280
And so that's a situation where there's already

54:33.280 --> 54:35.280
a weird power dynamic and so it's not like a...

54:35.280 --> 54:39.280
It's not actually super fun to go and talk.

54:39.280 --> 54:41.280
Nothing's gonna happen.

54:41.280 --> 54:42.280
It's gonna be really weird.

54:42.280 --> 54:43.280
I don't...

54:43.280 --> 54:45.280
That feels gross and not fun to...

54:45.280 --> 54:46.280
Because that person doesn't know you.

54:46.280 --> 54:48.280
They're a stranger, but they do know you

54:48.280 --> 54:49.280
because they know you from podcasts.

54:49.280 --> 54:50.280
Anyway, it's weird.

54:50.280 --> 54:52.280
You don't know them at all and they might eat you,

54:52.280 --> 54:53.280
so it's the whole thing.

54:53.280 --> 54:55.280
They're not in the good way.

54:55.280 --> 54:57.280
My point is there's that,

54:57.280 --> 55:00.280
and then I think the other thing is like...

55:00.280 --> 55:01.280
We share...

55:01.280 --> 55:04.280
You know, we're both into the same thing.

55:04.280 --> 55:05.280
Which is when people...

55:05.280 --> 55:07.280
Oh, yeah.

55:07.280 --> 55:08.280
That's a cool thing.

55:08.280 --> 55:11.280
Is that we can both be like, hey...

55:11.280 --> 55:12.280
Nice.

55:12.280 --> 55:13.280
She's cute.

55:13.280 --> 55:14.280
Yeah, exactly.

55:14.280 --> 55:15.280
Hey, nice.

55:15.280 --> 55:17.280
And then we go like high five.

55:17.280 --> 55:18.280
I get it.

55:18.280 --> 55:19.280
Okay.

55:19.280 --> 55:20.280
That's a...

55:20.280 --> 55:21.280
There are so many things that are not great,

55:21.280 --> 55:22.280
but that's a good part.

55:22.280 --> 55:23.280
Yeah.

55:23.280 --> 55:24.280
That makes sense.

55:24.280 --> 55:26.280
It's being like, oh, I'm not jealous of you.

55:26.280 --> 55:28.280
About that interaction, like, hey,

55:28.280 --> 55:29.280
I get it.

55:29.280 --> 55:30.280
Keep going.

55:30.280 --> 55:31.280
She's cute.

55:31.280 --> 55:33.280
Allow me to watch you talk to her.

55:33.280 --> 55:35.280
You'd be able to file it in the same place.

55:35.280 --> 55:37.280
I don't know how to file it if a guy...

55:37.280 --> 55:40.280
There's like a combination of like...

55:40.280 --> 55:41.280
I don't know.

55:41.280 --> 55:44.280
It's like, if he's everything that I'm not...

55:44.280 --> 55:47.280
I don't know where to file it if I see my girlfriend

55:47.280 --> 55:49.280
having a good time talking to him.

55:49.280 --> 55:51.280
Can I pose this to you, Dan?

55:51.280 --> 55:52.280
Can I just pose this?

55:52.280 --> 55:54.280
If he's everything that you're not,

55:54.280 --> 55:56.280
then she wants nothing to do with him.

55:56.280 --> 55:58.280
Because she likes you.

55:58.280 --> 56:01.280
Oh.

56:04.280 --> 56:08.280
That was such a, like, daytime talk show.

56:08.280 --> 56:10.280
Not sentenced from Rhea,

56:10.280 --> 56:13.280
but your guy's reaction.

56:13.280 --> 56:15.280
The...

56:15.280 --> 56:17.280
The time that it took.

56:17.280 --> 56:19.280
Like, I don't know if you guys had...

56:19.280 --> 56:21.280
I don't know if you could hear you,

56:21.280 --> 56:23.280
but it was like, you all waited for Rhea to say

56:23.280 --> 56:26.280
the full sentence, and then you thought about it.

56:26.280 --> 56:29.280
And then you were like...

56:29.280 --> 56:31.280
All right.

56:31.280 --> 56:34.280
I've been rude to our second guest.

56:34.280 --> 56:36.280
I have to go.

56:36.280 --> 56:37.280
Oh, shit, you have to go.

56:37.280 --> 56:38.280
Yeah, yeah, I do have to go,

56:38.280 --> 56:39.280
but I'm just gonna say this one thing.

56:39.280 --> 56:41.280
I also just put out an album on Friday.

56:41.280 --> 56:43.280
That's why I'm wearing this shirt.

56:43.280 --> 56:44.280
It's number one.

56:44.280 --> 56:46.280
Number one album.

56:46.280 --> 56:47.280
Number one.

56:47.280 --> 56:49.280
Thanks, you guys.

56:49.280 --> 56:50.280
And thank you, Dan.

56:50.280 --> 56:51.280
You bet.

56:51.280 --> 56:52.280
You're the best.

56:52.280 --> 56:53.280
I have keys in my hand.

56:53.280 --> 56:54.280
This is weird.

56:54.280 --> 56:56.280
I don't know what you're about on iTunes.

56:56.280 --> 56:57.280
You're like, Kill Rock Stories.

56:57.280 --> 56:58.280
Thanks for...

56:58.280 --> 56:59.280
Come on.

56:59.280 --> 57:00.280
Sorry.

57:00.280 --> 57:01.280
I'm just picking up what you...

57:01.280 --> 57:02.280
Listen, go, my wife.

57:02.280 --> 57:03.280
I got it.

57:03.280 --> 57:05.280
Rhea Butcher, everybody.

57:05.280 --> 57:10.280
So there's gonna be two more guests.

57:10.280 --> 57:11.280
Yeah.

57:11.280 --> 57:13.280
I think them coming right in between us

57:13.280 --> 57:14.280
will be a good thing.

57:14.280 --> 57:15.280
Yeah, I might...

57:15.280 --> 57:16.280
It was 9-11.

57:16.280 --> 57:17.280
It was 9-11.

57:17.280 --> 57:18.280
It is.

57:18.280 --> 57:19.280
You're right.

57:19.280 --> 57:20.280
Never forget.

57:20.280 --> 57:21.280
You're right.

57:21.280 --> 57:22.280
Never forget that.

57:22.280 --> 57:23.280
Andy Dick, 9-11.

57:23.280 --> 57:25.280
The September 11th, Andy Dick's coming to the show.

57:25.280 --> 57:27.280
Rudy Giuliani forgot.

57:27.280 --> 57:28.280
I know.

57:28.280 --> 57:30.280
He did forget.

57:30.280 --> 57:31.280
He did forget.

57:31.280 --> 57:32.280
It's pretty fun.

57:32.280 --> 57:34.280
I mean, of all people...

57:34.280 --> 57:37.280
I'm not saying 9-11 should be more memorable to anybody,

57:37.280 --> 57:39.280
but, you know, he really...

57:39.280 --> 57:42.280
It was his favorite national tragedy.

57:42.280 --> 57:45.280
Like, he really loved that thing.

57:45.280 --> 57:47.280
He loved it more than it was like...

57:47.280 --> 57:50.280
Jesus wakes up on December 25th.

57:50.280 --> 57:51.280
What is this?

57:51.280 --> 57:52.280
What's all this stuff?

57:52.280 --> 57:54.280
When I think of...

57:54.280 --> 57:55.280
What's Easter about?

57:55.280 --> 57:57.280
Does anyone know what this is?

57:57.280 --> 58:00.280
I think Rudy Giuliani's theme song

58:00.280 --> 58:02.280
for his relationship between him and 9-11

58:02.280 --> 58:04.280
is Lady in Red.

58:04.280 --> 58:06.280
It's like a ballad.

58:06.280 --> 58:07.280
It's like a beautiful, like...

58:07.280 --> 58:09.280
You're over a cross, new thing.

58:09.280 --> 58:12.280
And you're like, I met you and it was crazy.

58:12.280 --> 58:13.280
Nixon wakes up.

58:13.280 --> 58:15.280
I don't know how I feel about crooks.

58:15.280 --> 58:16.280
Like, it just feels like...

58:16.280 --> 58:17.280
Yeah.

58:17.280 --> 58:18.280
You remember that thing.

58:18.280 --> 58:20.280
That was important to you, right?

58:20.280 --> 58:22.280
Yeah, maybe time to check him out,

58:22.280 --> 58:24.280
put a little popsicle stick in his mouth,

58:24.280 --> 58:25.280
see if he remembers, you know,

58:25.280 --> 58:26.280
see if he's still Alice.

58:26.280 --> 58:28.280
You know what I'm saying?

58:28.280 --> 58:29.280
Yep.

58:29.280 --> 58:32.280
Don't I ever know what you're saying.

58:32.280 --> 58:33.280
All right.

58:33.280 --> 58:34.280
That didn't land.

58:34.280 --> 58:35.280
I thought it was...

58:35.280 --> 58:36.280
Oh, CF.

58:36.280 --> 58:37.280
Jack, sorry.

58:37.280 --> 58:38.280
Do you have your keys?

58:38.280 --> 58:39.280
You're...

58:39.280 --> 58:40.280
There's a card behind me.

58:40.280 --> 58:41.280
Oh.

58:41.280 --> 58:43.280
Oh, man, I wish you could just drive my car home

58:43.280 --> 58:45.280
when I can't drive your car.

58:45.280 --> 58:47.280
Because I drive stick.

58:47.280 --> 58:49.280
They love stick.

58:49.280 --> 58:50.280
Stick.

58:50.280 --> 58:55.280
Oh, we get it.

58:55.280 --> 58:56.280
Okay.

58:56.280 --> 58:57.280
Yeah.

58:57.280 --> 58:58.280
Whoa.

58:58.280 --> 58:59.280
And they caught it.

58:59.280 --> 59:01.280
God damn it.

59:01.280 --> 59:06.280
You guys ever notice lesbians always have each other's keys?

59:06.280 --> 59:07.280
New stereotype.

59:07.280 --> 59:09.280
Cointre stereotype.

59:09.280 --> 59:11.280
Talk about dangerous.

59:11.280 --> 59:13.280
This is a momentous occasion.

59:13.280 --> 59:14.280
I'm dangerous.

59:14.280 --> 59:18.280
It's a competition between me, you and Donald Trump.

59:18.280 --> 59:22.280
Someone's going to emerge as the most dangerous tonight.

59:22.280 --> 59:26.280
Speaking of danger and fear and things that scare you.

59:26.280 --> 59:31.280
Oh, an oaky spooky Halloween's just around the corner.

59:31.280 --> 59:36.280
Actually, no, it's not, which is why I think it's a good idea.

59:36.280 --> 59:37.280
Don't just say anything.

59:37.280 --> 59:38.280
Vincent Price.

59:38.280 --> 59:39.280
It's, you know...

59:39.280 --> 59:41.280
Vincent Price is here.

59:41.280 --> 59:42.280
Is he alive?

59:42.280 --> 59:49.280
It's like when people at a Torrey Amos concert, they yell out like...

59:49.280 --> 59:52.280
I'm dating myself.

59:52.280 --> 59:54.280
Which you can do.

59:54.280 --> 59:56.280
Look it up.

59:56.280 --> 01:00:01.280
Three states allow it.

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:09.280
You guys remember my neighbor, Beth Bootson, of the Eucalyptus tree?

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:16.280
So I'm just going to bring her and her son Timor up.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:23.280
If I try to introduce what we're talking about, I'll ruin it because I'm not a good show host.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.280
Welcome to the stage.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:28.280
Here's Beth Bootson and Timor.

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:34.280
Beth and Timor.

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:42.280
Alright, so the, I mean, the, the, the, the, this is the Cameron by the way.

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:45.280
Beth, Cameron.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.280
Whoa.

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:47.280
You have met, okay.

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.280
We just met now.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.280
We met just now.

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.280
Nice.

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.280
Okay, I'm just worried about that mic, man.

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.280
Worryed about that mic.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.280
It'll be fine.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:56.280
Okay, so you guys are my neighbors.

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.280
Hello, hello.

01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.280
Can you hear me?

01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.280
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.280
Timor, you want to get a level?

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:01.280
Testing, testing.

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.280
Oh, yeah.

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:03.280
Okay.

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:04.280
I'm going to use a mic.

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:05.280
Okay.

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:06.280
So it's what?

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:07.280
It's August?

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.280
Yeah.

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:09.280
It started in May.

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.280
It started in May.

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.280
Okay.

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.280
It started in May.

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:13.280
The, the, okay.

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.280
But it started years ago.

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:15.280
What are you guys talking about?

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.280
Oh my God.

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:18.280
It's like a lifetime movie.

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:20.280
Like, like, like, like Cold Open Crawl.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.280
What's, what's happening?

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:24.280
Now I know what this looks like.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:27.280
But before I was here, you gotta go, this is bad.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:28.280
Right, right.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:29.280
I'm bailing.

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.280
Freeze frame.

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.280
This is me.

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:32.280
I bet you're wondering how I got here.

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:33.280
You know what you were trying to say?

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:34.280
That's the good version of what I was saying.

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:35.280
Okay.

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.280
Yeah.

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.280
This is why you're a professional.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.280
I got you.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.280
That's amazing.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.280
Yeah.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:41.280
This is why you took over my billboard.

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:45.280
She deserves more television than you.

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:47.280
No, that's what I said.

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.280
I got great applause.

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:51.280
It was great.

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:55.280
Timor, Tim, Timor.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.280
Timor.

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.280
Timor.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.280
Yeah.

01:01:58.280 --> 01:01:59.280
It's T-I-M-U-R.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.280
Correct.

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:01.280
Timor.

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.280
Some people get it so wrong.

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.280
T-U-M-O-R.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.280
Two more?

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.280
Two more?

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:06.280
Two more?

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.280
People call you?

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:13.280
Someone spelled my name like T-I-M-E-O-U-R.

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.280
Like what?

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:15.280
Timur.

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.280
Timur.

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.280
Yeah.

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.280
Yeah.

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.280
Come on.

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.280
Pronounce it.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.280
So more.

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.280
T-I-M-U-R.

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:26.280
But if we just, if we're just in a rush, we can just go Timur and it's fine, right?

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.280
Timur.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:29.280
If it's fine by you, I guess.

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.280
So no.

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.280
Not a yes, yeah.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.280
I think it's, is it, is it like it's Jamal but it's Timur?

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.280
Is it like that?

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.280
What?

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:40.160
Is it like the emphasis has to be on the second syllable for it to be right?

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.160
You know what?

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:44.280
I think technically it is Timur, but since he was little...

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.280
Well, everyone calls me Timur, so, Timur.

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.280
So we've just gone with that.

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:49.280
All right.

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.280
Like Jamal.

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:51.280
I was right.

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:52.280
You're welcome.

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:53.280
All right.

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.520
We'll get through this one step at a time.

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:56.520
No, we're doing it.

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:59.280
I'm taking ass.

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:00.280
I'm so good.

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:06.280
One of our early conversations that we had as neighbors, I think was like, oh, my, one

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:10.280
of my sons, he has a haunted house every how, you know, and he's making it in the backyard.

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:11.280
Is that going to be a problem?

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.280
There's going to be people late.

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:17.280
I don't, I've never, ever, once, ever, I don't think, complained to a neighbor about

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.280
anything.

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:23.280
I either, I'm either forcing myself to stay awake and play Minecraft and tuning everything

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:30.360
out, or I'm just unconscious because I fell asleep against my will for the three hours

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:35.640
between Adderall's that it takes for me to recharge my brain and get out there and just

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:36.920
damage myself more.

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:40.400
So you're fine.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:45.680
But I could hear, so I hear your haunted house going on at haunted house time.

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:49.280
And there's a thing playing on a loop that I've become familiar with.

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.280
There's like a looped thing.

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:52.280
And I kind of get into it.

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:58.560
I'm like, but you've been doing this for years and you're steadily, you're, you're becoming

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.000
one of these Halloween people.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.480
You're becoming a haunted house person.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.640
I don't want to categorize you.

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.720
You thought you were special.

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:09.840
I'm saying, you know, it is, it's weird what you're, that's why you're here.

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:10.840
You were going to talk.

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:11.840
I'm sorry.

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:17.280
So you're, you're, you've been getting more and more into your haunted house every passing

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.280
year.

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:19.280
When did you start what year?

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:23.520
I started four, five years ago.

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:28.760
And so, and that, at that time, like how, how much before Halloween did you start making

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:29.760
your haunted house?

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.480
I started about the first, first time I started was like a week before.

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:35.480
All right.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.280
So, and then the next year, well, I would disagree with that.

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:41.000
Oh, controversy.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Mom's always wins.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
So go ahead.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Yeah.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Not on Harmontown.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Give up.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.240
You know, this is going to be the worst possible thing I'm going to say, but Rhea has a super

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:52.240
early call time.

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:55.880
And I feel like I'm going to be useless in this haunted house conversation.

01:04:55.880 --> 01:05:02.040
I'm going to go to my house so that my wife can go to bed at some point and I'm going

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:08.280
to leave you guys, but Dan, you have to take notes and tell me about it because I am neighbor

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:11.200
just trying to avoid the argument, aren't you?

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:12.200
The haunted house.

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:13.200
What argument?

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.760
I was not expecting an argument to happen.

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:18.160
I thought you were going to lay out all your plans and that we're going to hear about it

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.600
and that you were going to tell me your address so that I could come to your haunted house.

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:25.040
But we'll figure that out later because I also live in the neighborhood, so I'll see

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:26.040
you guys there.

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.040
All right.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.040
Watch Take My Wife on CISO.

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:29.040
Karen Esposito.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.040
Thank you so much.

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:32.040
Thank you so much.

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:36.720
I'm not a bad host.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:41.800
I gave them, I said they had an out before and the, yeah, that's not my fault.

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:43.400
You were so good at hosting.

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:44.400
I'm so good at everything.

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:45.400
Yeah.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.400
No, it's great.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:47.960
I'm good at sleeping next to a haunted house.

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:48.960
Yeah.

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:49.960
All right.

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:53.280
So you, so the first year, a week before a haunted house, you threw up a haunted house.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.680
You obviously had a good time.

01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:56.240
Next year, you want to make another haunted house.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.320
You started probably a little earlier, right?

01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:59.320
Yeah.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.320
How much earlier?

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.320
A month and a half.

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.320
Okay.

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:09.440
So now it's 2016, it's August, and you got your haunted house, it's like in construction

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:10.440
right now, right?

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:11.440
Yeah.

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:15.640
So there's a tag here that is like, these are your haunted house plans, right?

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:25.840
Well, one of the things that I would say is that Timur started his official haunted maze,

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:29.200
and it wasn't even a maze at that point because he was 11 years old.

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:32.440
But when I had my brain tumor.

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:33.720
Your brain Timur.

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:36.280
My brain Timur.

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:37.680
Is that what you did?

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:38.680
Yeah.

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:39.680
No.

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:40.680
Oh, wait.

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:41.680
Yeah.

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:47.520
Dan was going to work, and I was sleeping all day, and we were very worried about Timur

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.720
and what he was going to do all day.

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:55.800
And this was in the summertime, and you started building your first haunted maze.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.720
And it was, it went straight.

01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:03.520
It was, there wasn't much to it, but it was probably because he was only 11 years old.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:07.040
It probably went from here to that wall.

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:13.960
And I remember that it went right up our sidewalk, and everybody that was coming to visit me

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:16.840
had to go through that little tunnel.

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:21.880
So whether it was a pizza delivery man or people delivering food or relatives, they

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.880
all had to go through that.

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:25.680
And that was the first year.

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:31.600
And when you start it, when you do a haunted maze, I've been calling in a house, but it's

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:37.600
like, do you, do you go to the front door of your house?

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.160
Is that where the customer goes?

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:42.080
Do they go to the front door of your house and enter your home, or do they go around

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:44.520
the house?

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:50.440
So my house is like a regular house right here, and then there's a yard around it and

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:52.440
leading up to it or some stairs.

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.840
So then down there, people wait to get up.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:01.040
Well the first year, the first year, it went right up to our door.

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:06.240
But then after that, the next year, he said, I'm going to build it around the house.

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:13.480
And we were saying, tomorrow, that's crazy, because we live in a house that's on a hill.

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:17.560
And to go around it, there's so, I mean, just to get up to our house, there's a lot of steps.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.680
Our garage is at ground level.

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.160
And then you have to go up a lot of steps.

01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:24.840
Well see, now you're scaring me already.

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:27.080
Just know you'll burn calories if you go.

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.080
Yes.

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:31.920
And then to go around the house, which is where he wanted to build the whole haunted

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:36.680
maze, is there are steps all over, because it's on a hill.

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:38.080
So it's actually quite dangerous.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.480
So you never go through the boots in the home.

01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:41.480
No.

01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:45.080
You're not opening your home to strangers, because you'd have to have people just like

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.520
with knives to protect you against.

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:54.560
That's funny you say, because last year, with all the chaotic, I'm walking through my house,

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:59.080
and all of a sudden there's a little old grandma standing there like, where's the restroom?

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.080
Like right there.

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.080
Do I know you?

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:04.640
And then I'm waiting there for her to finish, and then I'm like waiting there for like ten

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:08.440
minutes, because there's a random old grandma in my house, and I'm like, the exit's this

01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:09.440
way.

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:10.440
So here, I'll escort you out.

01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:11.440
And then this way.

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:12.440
In my house.

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:13.440
And she went, no, sonny.

01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:14.440
I'll escort you to hell!

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:15.440
And you're like, no!

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:16.440
My hubris!

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:17.440
I had fun imitating horror, and now I'm in it!

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:18.440
And then she went, no, sonny!

01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:19.440
I'll escort you to hell!

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:20.440
And you're like, no!

01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:21.440
My hubris!

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:26.440
I had fun imitating horror, and now I'm in it!

01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:31.560
I mocked death, and I am now its plaything!

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:33.280
I should have known!

01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:35.560
This is my creep show!

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:37.440
You know what a creep show is?

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:38.440
It's a vignette.

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:39.440
It's a horror vignette.

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:40.440
All right.

01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:41.440
So, all right.

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:45.680
Well, so I just want to show, I don't even know, because you started bringing this out,

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:49.840
and I was like, save it for the stage, because I just want the, I mean, this to me is...

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:53.280
And mind you, Dan, this is stuff that he did when he was 11 and 12 years old.

01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:57.560
This is his horror house, his haunted house file.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:58.560
So you're, okay.

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.480
This is when he was 11 and 12 years old.

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.480
So...

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:04.720
Well, maybe 12 or 13.

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:06.600
That one's from 2014.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:09.560
So I see, what's in here is like, there's waivers.

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:11.360
So those are workers that apply?

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.360
Right.

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.360
Interests.

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.360
Interns, I would call them.

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:15.360
Well, they're his friends.

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.360
Yeah.

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:17.360
They're his friends.

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:18.360
And I think we all know the difference.

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:24.400
Chichong, that's a cash register not opening.

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:25.400
Yes.

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:26.400
Let's face it.

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.400
All right.

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:28.400
Let's talk about that.

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:29.400
Okay.

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:30.400
Let's talk about that.

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:31.400
Are people pay...

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.400
What are they giving you?

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:33.400
A buck at the door?

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:34.400
What are they...

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:35.400
What's the...

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:36.400
Where's the wheels getting greased here?

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:37.560
We actually go by donations at the end.

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:43.120
So if they liked it or got scared, we have a donation booth at the bottom of the stairs

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:46.760
that says donations, and that's actually a booth.

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:52.000
So like on some nights we'll have a person waiting in the booth, like last year we had

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.960
a clown theme.

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:59.120
So we'd have like a clown in there, a person that looked fake, and then after someone put

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:01.280
a donation in, they'd move.

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.280
So...

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:03.280
All right.

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:04.280
Well, that's...

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.280
Yeah.

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:06.280
So, okay.

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:07.280
So it's all on donations.

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.280
So then you take that and you what?

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:09.280
Do you put it all into the haunted house?

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:10.280
Yeah.

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.440
It actually goes back to all the money we spent on the house.

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.240
I see a map here.

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:15.240
Yeah.

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:17.600
There's a bunch of quadrants and it says plastic everywhere.

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:18.600
Well, the...

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:23.000
And there's a drawing of dismembered arms.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:28.280
The thing I wanted to point out were these were all things that he had...

01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:29.280
Just ideas.

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:30.280
Are these boobs?

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:31.400
Are these boobs or pencils?

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:34.600
But these are things that he did when he was 11 and 12 years old.

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:35.600
Right.

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.920
Those are teeth, but in your perspective I could see how those look like boobs.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:39.920
Yeah.

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.920
Well, it's called misogyny.

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:45.360
Yes, it's misogyny.

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:47.920
She uses that to consume me.

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:49.920
Whoa.

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:52.920
It's myth.

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:53.920
It's myth.

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:54.920
Deep man.

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:55.920
All right.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:56.920
I just want...

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:57.920
I don't know.

01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:58.920
It's a stack of things.

01:11:58.920 --> 01:11:59.920
So, Timora is 16 years old now.

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:02.240
That was one of the things I wanted to point out.

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.920
And he started this when he was 11.

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:04.920
Right.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:05.920
So, and I...

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:08.320
This is the thing that I like about it.

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:09.320
Because you need my approval.

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:13.720
But I like that you said, you said, oh, my son's going to do a haunted house, you know?

01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:15.840
And I'm like, okay.

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:16.840
And I like it.

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:17.840
I mean, it's neat.

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:21.880
It's cool that you're like, you're into it and you keep putting more and more energy

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:22.880
into it.

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:23.880
And you might get...

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:27.440
Next year might be the year that you're like, oh, haunted houses are dumb.

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:28.440
Or...

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:32.560
But more than likely, some kind of weird morph is going to happen where you're like, oh,

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:35.120
you know what I really like about haunted houses?

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.120
You know what I'm doing?

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:41.000
You know, there may be some weird offshoot of that, or you may be one of the lucky people

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000
that's like...

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
And I found out...

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000
I love...

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:51.480
It'll be 2048 and you'll be like, I'm the master of haunted houses, or just this one.

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:53.920
I want to ask you, like, what do you think...

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:55.680
And there's no wrong answer to it.

01:12:55.680 --> 01:13:01.080
It's like the most dumb, like, childish caveman answer that you want to give.

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:02.080
Like, what...

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:03.080
What do you...

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:04.080
What's the pleasure?

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:06.040
What draws you back to it?

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:09.720
How do you really get out of the whole experience of making a haunted house and having people

01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:10.720
come through it?

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:14.880
Well, it's a community thing that happens.

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:20.320
So all the neighbors come, and then from actually 6 to 7 p.m. is the less scary version

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:23.280
for little kids like her age to go through.

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:24.280
Oh, there's...

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:26.600
See, I think you guys invited me to that one, right?

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:27.600
Because you know...

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.600
Most likely.

01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:36.960
But, you know, all the neighbors do get involved, and there is a lot of generations.

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:45.080
So we have little kids like you that are working the haunted maze, and Timor's got his friends.

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:49.400
Probably, like, 4-year-old girls are the easiest, like, haunted house worker in the world.

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:54.880
They could just put an Easter dress on them and have them just stand and stare, as long

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:57.400
as they could just hold still for, like, an hour.

01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:01.240
That's probably the most terrifying thing.

01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:09.080
They beckon with a lace glove, holding something random, not like a bloody knife, because it's

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:10.080
over the top.

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:19.080
They're just holding, like, an apple or, like, a gerbil or a football with, like, a pentagram

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:20.080
on it.

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:22.440
I don't know.

01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:27.640
They're not far from the...or, like, a piece of...no, okay, scariest thing in the world.

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:33.880
4-year-old girl in a nightgown holding an O-ring from a space shuttle.

01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:38.000
Oh, shit.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.160
Think about it.

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:47.720
And just with a look of confusion on her face.

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:51.000
The face I have right now, because I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:56.600
It's just, yeah, it's like a...or just a...let me re-pitch that.

01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:01.000
That's what I would project onto it, if it was a girl holding a piece of...it was clearly

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.160
like a piece of, like, a crucial aeronautic equipment.

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:07.160
You know what I'm saying?

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.160
It's like some dark, dark shit.

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:11.680
The idea is that a bunch of people are going to die because of this child.

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:12.680
Just something specific.

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:15.840
It's like, that girl's not supposed to be holding that, and they're like, what is that?

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:20.680
It's like a big nut, you know, like an industrial-sized washer.

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:21.680
That's like rusty or something.

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:26.520
And she's just holding it up and going like...and you're like, where did you get that?

01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:32.680
And then you just hear, and there's huge crash.

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:33.680
That's terror.

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:37.080
Like, you should...you can use that.

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:40.680
I'll take that into consideration.

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:45.520
But aside from it being...because if you just wanted to do community stuff, then that's

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:46.520
great.

01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:50.840
But you're very...you know, that's a good answer, and I'm not saying it's an insincere

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:51.840
one.

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:58.280
It's part...you like contributing, like the feeling of the neighborhood is like, there's

01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:02.560
a tradition, and they're coming over, and you're like, you're doing this thing that

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:03.560
people know.

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:04.560
Oh, there's Timmer.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:07.440
He's the guy that does that haunted house thing every year, and it's like consistency

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:08.440
and tradition.

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:14.240
And you have this role, like, I'm the shoemaker, I'm the barber, I'm the guy that saves your

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:15.240
life.

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:23.600
You know, like whatever, you have this role, and...but now just a subset of that, the terror

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:27.440
thing, the horror thing, the idea, because you could do that with Christmas, you could

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:31.320
do that with, you know, you could do that with Easter, you could do that with No Holiday

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:34.800
at All, you could do that with like a bicycle race around here, you could organize like

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:39.720
a marathon where everyone walked on their hands and the proceeds went to the next year's

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:40.720
marathon.

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:48.920
But you, people being scared, does that, like, do you like that?

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:53.440
That's the first question I've ever got asked by someone.

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:56.080
Your guides counselor should have been the first.

01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:01.600
He should have said, do you like scaring people, Timmer?

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:02.600
No comment.

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:06.880
Well, do you like a good night's sleep?

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:08.880
Who doesn't?

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:12.160
Yeah, no, who doesn't is right.

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:16.760
Let me tell you something about Casper Mattressers.

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:22.200
Casper is an obsessively engineered mattress at a shockingly low price.

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:28.440
Now as a cool kid, does that appeal to you in any way?

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:29.440
Not really.

01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:31.960
No, you're right.

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:36.000
It's not appealing to kids, this is engineer stuff, but what about the fact that it combines

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:41.040
spring latex and supportive memory foam to create an award-winning sleep surface with

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:43.280
just the right sink and just the right bounce?

01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:45.400
It has a 100-day guarantee.

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:47.480
Yeah, a 100-day guarantee.

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:50.520
You can try it out for 100 nights if you don't like it.

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:51.520
Bring it back for free.

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:52.520
We don't care.

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:55.800
Wait a minute, are you telling me, and I know this is what people say in a commercial,

01:17:55.800 --> 01:18:04.320
but I really am, are you telling me, Crazy King Spencer, that there's a mattress company

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:11.760
that lets you try a mattress for 100 days and at the end of 100 days, which is a mattress's

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:12.760
life?

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:17.720
I mean, I'm like, wait, that's like the best years of a mattress or the first 100 days.

01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:22.240
Well, I mean, 100 days is like, that's like, if you try a mattress for 100 days and then

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:29.000
go, eh, I didn't like it, you have a right to, but you're lying, because if you laid

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:34.300
on something for 100 days, you can't tell me you didn't like it, but maybe you're busy.

01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:38.480
But I mean, maybe you're just, you know, hoodwinked by the fact that Time Magazine named it the

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:40.920
best invention of 2015.

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.560
The best invention in general?

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:46.200
Yeah, it's a mattress that won't disappoint.

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:51.520
Now in a world where we've landed on the moon, I guess the idea is like a slow invention

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:52.520
year.

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:55.520
Yeah, well, no, it's exactly the opposite.

01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:02.480
It's actually the biggest invention year of 2015, self-driving cars, artificial intelligence.

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:08.080
No, Casper mattress, Dan, they ship anywhere in U.S. and Canada.

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:12.160
I got one, it came in the box, the size of a mini fridge.

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:18.080
I accidentally cut it open, it was full of gold coins, it's a $2,000 value, just hidden

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:19.080
away in a mattress.

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:21.920
All right, wait a minute, is that, is that allowed?

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:26.720
I mean, I'm not saying that's normal, but that's just my experience.

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:36.240
Oh, okay, yeah, I got a Casper mattress and all of our immigration problems were solved.

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:38.920
Whoa, now we can't say that's connected.

01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:45.160
No, no, but it did happen, it did happen, sorry Timmery, we can't have a donation box

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:47.040
at the end of it.

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:48.760
Here's the upshot, Timmer.

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:54.960
If you use the promo code Harmon at checkout at Casper mattress.com, you can get $50 off,

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:55.960
yeah.

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:58.960
You can get $50 off of a 100 day guarantee of a free mattress.

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:03.320
Now that's a good night's sleep, that's also the best invention of 2015.

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:13.720
Wow, Casper, the first name in softness now in ghosts and mattresses.

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:19.360
Yeah, that's Casper.com slash Harmon, Casper.com slash Harmon, over, okay, we're done.

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:20.920
Now, slash Harmon, not Harmon.

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:24.320
So what's your favorite ghosty, Timmer?

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:31.320
Do you like goblins, you like grim reapers, I'm partial to gnolls.

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:35.840
Once again, no comment.

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:43.160
Okay, I mean, it's weird to plead the fifth in an interview, but I don't know which footage

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:45.240
you watched before you came here.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:47.920
These PR lawyers these days, they're getting in early.

01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:50.640
But okay, here's a question for you.

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:58.040
Right, so you're like the pit boss at these things, like at a casino, like you're running

01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:04.480
the whole thing, like it's a Timmer production, like you're top dog, right?

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:06.520
No, no, my parents are.

01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:07.520
So millennial.

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:08.520
All right.

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:13.080
Well, let me tell you a story about that.

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:17.960
I gave birth to him, so animal, and couldn't get away with killing him, so I dominate

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:18.960
his life.

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:26.400
So this is his thing, and of course we have the ultimate say, but it's like when he invited

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:33.600
all of his school friends to help out, and he was probably like what, 13 or 14, and his

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:37.040
friends, it was supposed to be something that they were, it's going to be something

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:41.800
cool and fun that they do together, but then at a certain point, because Timmer takes his

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:48.840
haunted maze so seriously, they started accusing him of being really bossy.

01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:51.000
And you know.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.440
Heavy lies the crown, my friend.

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:57.680
This is why he's no commenting, his enemies are looking for a weakness.

01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:06.920
At one point, they started to revolt, and they said they weren't going to put up with

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:13.120
it anymore, and they started to have a skateboard party down in the cul-de-sac.

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:14.120
Season four.

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:20.600
And he came up to me, extremely frustrated, because he wanted his friends to be there

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:25.360
helping him, and they weren't going to have any more of it.

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:27.560
So at that point.

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:30.320
Did they do a Muppet episode?

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.320
Yeah.

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:36.320
You don't know how much I share this.

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:37.320
Yes.

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.320
Yeah.

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.320
I'll bet.

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:46.920
So at that point, I went down there and, you know, called them up, and they were looking

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:49.840
at me like, you know, what are you going to do about it?

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:50.840
Holy shit.

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:55.760
This is crazy, because it's like, that's a haunted house, and then it's like, this is

01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:56.760
really scary.

01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:57.760
Yes.

01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:58.760
Yes.

01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:00.400
It's scary how not scary they're being.

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:03.400
Yeah, they're like, this is like purge anarchy.

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:04.400
Yes.

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:06.400
You got like skulls on their heads, and they're like skateboarding.

01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:09.840
Anarchy, they're not doing things to alarm people.

01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:14.520
And then Timor said that he wanted to fire them, and they said, you can't fire us, we're

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:16.280
working for free.

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:17.640
Whoa.

01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:21.080
And so he said that he would pay them so he could fire them.

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:22.080
Nice.

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:28.720
I can't, this is just, like humanity thinks we have so many levels of sophistication,

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:33.400
and that is just, that's global politics played out, just like, that's it.

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:34.400
Exactly.

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:38.640
Oh, okay, you're a territory.

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:43.240
So at that point, I mean, I kind of asked the guys, I said, let me ask you something.

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:48.680
I said, do you guys want to be a part of something that's really cool, or something that's just

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:50.320
really, really lame?

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:54.200
I said, because you're going to go back to your friends, and they're going to ask you,

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:57.880
they're going to say, man, that haunted maze was really lame.

01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:01.480
Or they're going to say, that was really cool.

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:04.400
I didn't understand at first, I thought you were going a different direction, but that's

01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:06.000
a lot more encouraging.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Yeah.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000
It's positive.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.200
You know, and so at that point, they said, we want to be a part of something that's really

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:13.400
cool.

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:16.600
And I said, you know, well, Timor's getting really frustrated, because he's trying to

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:20.160
make this really cool, and he's not getting any help from you.

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:26.000
So then at that point, they all kind of rallied around, and they, you know, started helping

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:32.120
Timor, but so that's, you know, a typical teenage thing.

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:39.480
But it sounds like mainly you went through it, like, you mean, well, he was, he was practically

01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:40.480
in tears.

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:41.480
Why?

01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:42.480
So.

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:46.800
I doubt that, I'm sure it was fine.

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:47.800
He's probably used to that.

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:52.600
He's watching this all with a cocktail, watching a little window, like Bruce Wayne, yes, let

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:53.600
her have it, mother.

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:57.520
Well, these are all, these are all his best friends.

01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:03.600
Well, there's Morgan Freeman comes in and goes, sir, we found a new way to scare people.

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.520
Let's take a look, Lucius.

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:06.520
Where's your mother?

01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:08.920
She's out talking to the riffraff.

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:12.440
Well, here's what I was going to ask you.

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:19.040
So you're the boss, and I get it now, like saying yes to that is like, yeah, of course,

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:23.560
you got to, you got to, you got to say, well, you know, creator is a myth, really.

01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:30.080
It's a collaboration, I get it.

01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:36.200
But the, God damn it, I'm always distracting myself.

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:40.360
When the show is actually going, when the thing is running full swing, what do you prefer

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:41.360
to do?

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:45.560
Do you walk around like Robert De Niro in Casino, like observing, or do you actually immerse

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:47.640
yourself in like one jack-o'-lantern?

01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:54.160
Well, well, I'll stand in the front in the beginning, and then I'll wait there until

01:25:54.160 --> 01:26:00.560
my ADHD kicks in, and then I'll go back and start scaring people.

01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:08.840
That's what Dan does, except I give myself ADHD with a drug called Adderall because I

01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:15.280
don't have ADHD, except don't tell my doctor that.

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:19.440
But yeah, so you say, wait, so you go scare people, but what do you do, or do you just

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:24.360
grab a dull machete and just wander, or is there like a spot you like?

01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:30.160
I just go to whatever spots open, so depending on the night, how many actors, if we're short

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:35.480
on actors, I'll just stay and like help scare, but for good on actors, I usually stay down

01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.320
until I get bored.

01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:38.320
Stay down like in front.

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:42.080
I like help out, like, oh, you go ahead, wait here, or go.

01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:46.240
So surely there's been like, okay, there's been some mishaps, right?

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:50.920
Somebody, has there been complaints, or somebody went through, they're dissatisfied?

01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:58.280
Yeah, there's been a few of those that I actually remember the first, maybe like the third year

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:04.080
we were into it, there were like maybe five or six of us actors, and then I remember there

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:07.880
were these little kids that came up and they came down, and then we didn't establish at

01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:11.760
the time where we could stop scaring people, like, so.

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:15.160
They didn't establish what the safety zone is, yes.

01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:21.720
So a couple of my actors, a couple of my actors start scaring these little girls, and then

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:25.400
they start running down the street, and we're in a cul-de-sac, so it's like we're out, and

01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:30.600
I assume like right after you exit, that's it, but then they start chasing them all the

01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:35.560
way down the street and I'm like, and come on, these are little girls, six and seven,

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:36.560
come on.

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:41.160
Well, you know, I was going to say the other thing about running to Haun and Mays is, you

01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:46.200
know, when he was younger, like eleven or twelve years old, you know, it was actually

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:52.080
quite cute, and people would say, oh, you know, this is really good, but then at a certain

01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:59.120
point when he got older, it started getting really scary, and we actually had one parent

01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:05.800
who was throwing a party and brought his whole party of kids to the Haun and Mays, and because

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:11.440
that was a year where it was kind of the turning point, and things had gotten really scary,

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:16.560
and a couple of his actors chased this party all the way down the street, and the kids

01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:21.800
got really scared, and the parent came back and said, he goes, you know what?

01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:27.480
He says, I have a couple of girls crying here, he says they're going to go back home, terrorized,

01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:34.200
he says, and you guys, you need to establish a safety zone, but he was right, he was right.

01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:35.920
I guess he's right, but I hate him.

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:36.920
No, he's right.

01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:37.920
We all hate him right now.

01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:40.240
He was right, unless it was one of your kids.

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:44.280
If we were him, if he was humanized, we would be back.

01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:45.680
If it was one of his kids.

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:47.960
Yes, if he had a kid, and it came out.

01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:48.960
Oh, well it was.

01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:56.120
Yeah, and you know what, he was right, and so at that point, we had to establish some

01:28:56.120 --> 01:29:03.440
rules for the actors, like you don't go down the steps, and, you know, so, I mean, it's

01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:09.520
interesting because as Timor's gotten older, you know, and things getting scarier, there's

01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:15.040
a lot of things that a person doesn't have to, you never consider when a kid is younger,

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:17.880
and it's kind of cute, you know?

01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:22.560
It's a whole area I'd never go into, because when I go to haunted houses, it's usually,

01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:27.680
it's like, it's a whole game of like, I don't want to, who I'm with, I don't want to miss

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:32.960
out on stuff, and then, so everyone's going to do this thing, but I genuinely like, I

01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:40.480
have a really low threshold, and I, you know, my therapist says, I startle easily for various

01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:46.680
reasons, she gave me a license to be easily startled, like, you know, and I get scared

01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:51.480
like, if my girlfriend's in the bathroom and she's brushing her teeth, and I go, are you

01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:52.480
almost ready?

01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:56.560
Yeah, I'm just brushing my teeth, and then I'll like, go and pick up a sock, and if I

01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:01.520
turn around, and then she's not in the bathroom, but she's in the living room, and I hear her

01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:08.280
voice from the wrong room, I'll go, it's not even seeing anybody, I'll just like, if someone

01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:11.920
passes the salt, and then it's where it's not supposed to be, yeah, like I have this

01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:19.200
like visceral reaction, so what I'm saying is, because of that, knowing that people are

01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:23.120
coming through, they have all these different relationships with being scared, some people

01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:27.040
are like, I have, in my wildest dreams, I've lived this punk rock haunted house where people

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:32.320
chased me all the way down the street, because fuck this, like, marching dimes, bullshit,

01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:35.400
you know, like, you know, like, this is, but you're an adult.

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:39.480
This is like, mon-pop punk rock, and sometimes you pay to get scared, yeah, and it's like

01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:43.040
Tabasco sauce, it's like, I want to burn my tongue, I know it's not real, I want to feel

01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:47.840
like it's on fire, exactly, and then it's like, my little girl got scared, you need

01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:52.600
a highway cone to establish, and then everyone's like, well, you know what's interesting is

01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:59.560
we have little kids that are so brave, and we have adults that are crying, so, you know,

01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:00.560
there is, there is that.

01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:05.720
That's gonna be neat, I just, here's what I do, I just, I'll just like, I yelp at like

01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:09.600
a high-pitched scream, like, when anyone scares me, like, anything that's not supposed to

01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:15.600
be where it is, I go, and it'll scare other people, and then I feel, and then they scare

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:20.360
me, because they're screaming, like, I stay away from haunted houses, so I'm gonna, but

01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:24.960
I think it's a smart thing to have, like, the kiddie time, where, like, what do you do

01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:29.080
when you scare a little kid, what are the, what's the difference between scaring a kid

01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:33.600
and scaring a, when you, you do it, you have little kid, what, what, what, what, give us

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:36.280
some examples of how to choke up on the scaring bat?

01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:42.320
A year or two back, we tried to do this thing called the pumpkins in the goblin, so if there's

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:46.200
a little kid going through, we'd call them the pumpkins, so that would mean you don't

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:50.360
scare them as much, but if we say goblins, then the actors know to step up their game,

01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:51.360
but...

01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:54.040
So you're, you're calling that a head, we got two pumpkins coming, yeah, yeah, yeah,

01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:57.920
it was, it was a nightmare trying to get it all figured out, but we stopped that, and

01:31:57.920 --> 01:31:59.600
we figured out the six to seven...

01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:03.200
Yeah, that makes more sense, because pumpkins are gonna come with goblins, you know, and

01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:08.480
so what are you supposed to do, two pumpkins, three goblins, three, said three goblins,

01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:17.480
The one pumpkin is, like, yeah, it has PTSD, you know what I'm saying.

01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:35.280
Boy, all right, so commitment is a theme, terror, hierarchy, a weird, fun blend of these

01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:40.560
phrases, helicopter, mothering, and also, but you're turning them loose, like you're

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:46.960
letting them explore his inner Ted Bundy, like you're, you're, you're going like, okay,

01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:50.920
so you love, you love this, this haunted house thing, but then you're like down there doing

01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:52.920
labor relations with, for him.

01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:56.680
No, the only time I show up is actually on Halloween.

01:32:56.680 --> 01:33:04.120
Do you got, do you and Dan, your, your husband, do you, do you, do you guys, actually, do

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:08.640
you go check into a hotel while he does the haunted house because the, the sound or?

01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:14.400
No, we actually are there because a lot of times I'll take our dog down for all the little

01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:19.640
kids that get scared and I dress up our dog in a costume and, you know, people show up

01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:26.480
with their little kids and then sometimes I'll run the booth and play the scary clown

01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:32.240
in the booth, but and Dan helps him build it sometimes, but really Timor and his friends

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:37.880
are the ones that build all of it and what are the, what are the, what are the, what

01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:44.600
are the do's and don'ts, okay, creatively, haunted house craftsmanship, what's hack,

01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:51.480
you know what hack means, like explain, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, uh, uh,

01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:57.720
catch penny, pure isle, 2000 and late, like, like, it's what, it's what the amateurs do.

01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:02.720
That's like Bush League, like, like, easy shortcut, like, like, like, even if it does

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:07.200
get a reaction, it's like, oh, but that's like, not, that's not like what a good haunted

01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:08.200
house guy does.

01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:13.080
Well, one of my main things is I make sure, since I don't know how all my actors are acting

01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:15.040
wise, I make sure they all have a mask on there.

01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:26.360
I'm not letting them try to explore their acting skills here, no offense to my actors.

01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:31.960
So everyone is dehumanized and controllable, an opportunity for body work.

01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:32.960
Yeah.

01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:33.960
Well, yeah.

01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:34.960
Well, it keeps them interchangeable.

01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:39.600
No one can make an argument that's like, look, I'm Damien, you know, they're coming

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:43.120
for me the way I scare them with my eyebrows.

01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:49.160
Well, you know, what's funny too is that, um, tomorrow would get really, really frustrated

01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:55.400
because he would, when a cute girl would come through the haunted maze, he would get mad

01:34:55.400 --> 01:35:00.400
because his actors, which are his friends, would not stay in character.

01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:01.400
Yeah.

01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:02.400
One of my friends like, you're hot.

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:03.400
It's like, come on, bro.

01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:04.400
Yes.

01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:07.400
Well, no, that is just another form of terror.

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:08.400
Yeah.

01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:11.400
That's the haunted house she's trying to escape.

01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:12.400
Right.

01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:15.280
A haunted house with a glass ceiling.

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:18.840
Oh, well, I mean, they're 16 there.

01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:22.680
I mean, yeah, I mean, I learned to visit 42.

01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:26.600
And it was only to try to not get booed on my podcast.

01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:28.400
I wasn't because I was a evolved person.

01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:32.680
I just figured out that women have a hard time.

01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:36.840
Um, uh, the, uh, so, all right, so, so that's, well, that's interesting.

01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:41.760
So that's a, that's a note like, don't, don't, don't, you know, it's a selfless job scaring

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:43.120
people at a haunted house.

01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:47.840
You don't get to like, same would go for, uh, uh, someone writing a parking ticket or

01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:49.720
a judge or anything else.

01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:53.560
You're an impersonal cosmic force, if you're not a hack, you're going to, you're going

01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:58.400
to stick to your role and rev your prop, uh, chainsaw.

01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:02.040
And it doesn't matter if like a redhead comes through, you're not going to try to impress

01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:03.040
her.

01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:04.040
Yeah.

01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:07.680
Well, I feel like if, if you're wearing a mask, you don't have to be self-conscious

01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:10.000
that someone will identify you or something.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.000
So you have a mask on.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:18.720
So you hear that kids that just, just words to live by.

01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:27.680
Um, but, uh, yeah, yeah, so, uh, uh, okay, so what, what, what, what are, what are your

01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:28.680
rules on touching?

01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:35.240
Uh, well, I have a sign outside that says actors won't touch you and you don't touch

01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:36.240
them.

01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:37.240
Okay.

01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:40.800
So here's the thing, such a relief, like, I, I, like, like when I see that I'm like,

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:44.920
yeah, well good, I guess, but at the same time, something in the back of my brain is

01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:47.000
like, well, but now.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.040
Like, like, do you, did you ever struggle with that?

01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:55.160
Did, did you, in your career from 12 to 16, was there a time when that sign had to go

01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:58.880
up or did you, did your philosophy change where people like grabbing people's shirts

01:36:58.880 --> 01:36:59.880
or anything?

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:00.880
Well, I was never a fan.

01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:05.320
I know there's those haunted houses that grab me or like feet or ankles or whatever

01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:06.320
they touch you.

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:07.640
I'm not a big fan of that.

01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:08.640
It's New York shit.

01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:09.640
Yeah.

01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:16.000
Sort of Dino goes, like you grab their feet.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Dungeons.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Yeah.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.160
But so you, you are never a fan.

01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:24.720
You're like, you're like, I like, like, but so what's your favorite, like, like, I don't

01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:29.440
know, I'm trying to think like, like, like, is it like, is your bag of tricks primarily

01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:33.000
based on like, I'm walking and I can't see everything.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.680
And then just a dude jumps out, like from behind something.

01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:41.800
I hate to sound like a demeaning your profession, like, like I'm from boiling it down to something.

01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:46.240
But there's, because there's also like, I don't know, like, hands reaching through things.

01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:48.280
Why am I pretending I'm an expert in what you do?

01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:49.800
You'll have to come through, Dan.

01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:54.560
I'm going to come through, but with the, during the kitty hour, and I'm going to, I'm going

01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:58.920
to periscope the whole time so that it is so that if I, if I, if I, if I shriek, I can

01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:05.040
sell it, I can sell it, but, but, but, but is it like, you don't want to answer that

01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:08.040
because then you'll be like, that'll be giving away your recipe.

01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:14.720
So, wait, are you asking me, eat the mic, tell, he'll tell us the secrets?

01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:18.360
Well, if the darker it is, the better.

01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:28.360
So, um, if someone's not wearing a mask and it's dark, it's better and like, um, okay,

01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:32.480
let's, okay, never, never mind, never mind.

01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:33.480
It's all good.

01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:34.480
All right.

01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:35.480
Hey, it's hard.

01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:36.480
It's hard to be up here.

01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:37.480
He's doing a great job.

01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:38.480
He's all doing a great job.

01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:39.480
Thank you.

01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:40.480
Thank you so much.

01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:50.240
Well, also, also it can be kind of hard trying to get people, uh, to come because we live

01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:55.240
at a, on the end of a very, uh, at the end of a cul-de-sac.

01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:56.240
And tell, tell me how you did it.

01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:59.960
This year, we've got it, something that will catch your attention for sure.

01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:00.960
For sure.

01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:01.960
Shit.

01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:02.960
I don't know.

01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:04.960
Are you guys really hurting for traffic?

01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:06.600
I mean, how, like, that's the other thing.

01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:07.600
What about bandwidth?

01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:11.480
Oh, if there's two cars on the, on the cul-de-sac, you have traffic already.

01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:12.480
Yeah.

01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:13.480
Right.

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:15.520
But I'm saying, I'm saying like foot traffic going through your haunted house, like, are

01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:16.520
you really craving?

01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:18.800
Do you, how, how much do you think you can handle?

01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:26.840
Uh, well, we have, um, like, security guards slash, like, they help, like, when the people

01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:27.840
come through.

01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:28.920
You can scare people.

01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:31.600
You can turn around a lot of scaring people per minute.

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:33.320
Yeah, I think so.

01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:36.920
Because if we're plugging your haunted house, we're plugging my house because of my neighbor.

01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:38.160
I just realized that.

01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:43.200
That's the scariest thing of all, is that I'm going to have just people in my kitchen.

01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:45.280
Uh, uh, but that's fine.

01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:47.320
There'll be fans and that'll be fine.

01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:52.120
Uh, but, but, but, we thought, we thought you could dress up as the psycho woman and

01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:54.240
from your window.

01:39:54.240 --> 01:40:00.280
We, well, that's something, you know, I never even, like, dress up like a granny or your

01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:01.280
mom.

01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:06.280
Well, that can help me, that can help me, like, uh, like cope with my, like, if I just

01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:11.000
played a part at the haunted house, if I just, or is that cheating, that's cheating.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.120
Look up at you and you'd be in your window doing this.

01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:16.560
I need to, oh, oh, like, play it from my house.

01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:21.560
I could just, like, I could just do weird things like, like, like, I thought that's

01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:23.560
what you were responding positively to.

01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:24.560
Yeah.

01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:27.880
I was thinking about being down there and just being like a mummy that goes like, no, you

01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:31.800
can stay in your house, and I just keep, I just keep going like, I can't figure out

01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:47.000
my third act, bang, over and over, like, fade in on the, bang, daddy, why, why, no, shut

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:53.360
up, it's for you, uh, like, it's just like weird shit going on, like, silhouettes and

01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:54.360
like, yeah.

01:40:54.360 --> 01:41:00.200
To more, tell them how you would get people over to your haunted maze.

01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:07.360
Uh, I had an idea one year to make cards, business cards, so we make them, design them,

01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:11.720
then hand them out to people at school, and then I give a bunch, so I have a bunch of friends

01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:15.840
that come to work in the haunted house that don't go to my school, so I have friends from

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:19.960
all these different schools, so I give them cards, and they hand them out to all the people

01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:22.600
at their school, and then the work travels.

01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:27.680
And then you had flyers, and where would all, you and all your friends go?

01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:33.520
Stores, and more people, and then elementary schools, and then the other thing they would

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:37.280
do is they would go door knocking, inviting people to come.

01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:40.240
So listening, you're knocking on the door going like, would you like to have a shit

01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:41.240
scared out of you?

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:42.240
Yes, yes.

01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:43.240
I'm thinking Thursday.

01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:48.240
Uh, yeah, well, I mean, well, we can, it's early, the point was to bring you in early

01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:51.680
because I wanted to showcase, because if it was October, and I was like, this guy's working

01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:53.440
on a haunted house, it'd be like, who cares?

01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:58.840
It's weird, in a good way, to be 16 and be in your fourth year of this level of commitment

01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:03.480
to haunted house-ery, you're supposed to be so distracted by some of those people walking

01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:07.960
through there that you spend the next five to eight years living in an existential vacuum

01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:13.200
and thinking everyone's robots, and just going like this on a typewriter, doing derivative

01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:18.520
things, but really just fantasizing about, like, this asphyxiation.

01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:23.120
That would be normal, and listening to a lot of inexassed Phil Collins, Jane's Addiction,

01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:26.640
and, uh, uh, Shanaid O'Connor, like, like, sprinkled in there.

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:30.640
Well, you know, one of the things that we thought, because he starts in May, it's basically,

01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:33.440
he starts when school lets out.

01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:36.880
And so he would always, you know, I would tell him, I said, Timor, I said, you know

01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:41.800
what, I want my yard for barbecues, and he would always say, Mom, I'm already behind

01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:42.800
schedule!

01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:49.320
So, you know, while other people are going to pool parties and barbecues, Timor is working

01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:50.320
on his haunted maze.

01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:53.520
Well, people are living a normal life, I'm working on the haunted house.

01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:54.760
When does business start?

01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:55.760
When does it go up?

01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:59.400
Um, I'm always bad with times, though.

01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:00.400
Me too.

01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:04.360
Maybe that's part of the appeal, because you're like, I know what time it is now, it's Halloween

01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:05.360
time.

01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:10.280
It starts the second Friday of October.

01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:11.280
Second Friday of October.

01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:12.280
And then Friday, Saturday.

01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:13.280
Second Friday of October.

01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:14.280
Second Friday of October.

01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:15.280
Second Friday of October.

01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:16.280
Second Friday of October.

01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:17.280
Who's going to forget that?

01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:21.080
You know, we got some more, we got some more bookkeeping to take care of.

01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:23.040
Steve wants us to plug something.

01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:24.040
Can we do that?

01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:25.040
Is that okay?

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:26.040
Yeah, that's...

01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:27.040
Steve, you plug it.

01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:28.040
Come out here, Steve.

01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:30.040
Come out here.

01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:37.280
Steve texted me like 10 minutes ago, we got to plug this thing.

01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:39.280
You fucking do it.

01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:40.280
I don't...

01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:45.880
All right, well, because we had Michael Christian on the show in San Francisco.

01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:46.880
The lost episode.

01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:52.440
It's a lost episode, and he was plugging an event, and I told him that we would plug

01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:53.440
it.

01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:54.440
Of course.

01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:55.440
Well, yeah.

01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:56.440
Michael Christian does...

01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:57.440
It's friendsforbenefits.org.

01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:58.440
That's it.

01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:03.600
And what's the event that they're doing?

01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:08.080
In November, they're doing an Avatar the Last Airbender and Legend of Korra event in San

01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:12.000
Francisco at the JCC.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.800
The tickets are on sale at friendsforbenefits.org.

01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:18.840
They're going to have Janet Varney, who's the voice of Korra, Mindy Sterling, who's

01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:25.280
Lynn Bayfong, Dante Bosco, who's Zuko, and John Michael Higgins, who is Varick.

01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:26.280
Yeah, man.

01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:27.280
And they're going to do...

01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:28.280
If you got a...

01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:29.280
Yeah, friendsforbenefits.org.

01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:30.280
Michael Christian.

01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:31.280
That's a good cause.

01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:32.280
Like, he...

01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:36.040
Yeah, it's such a goddamn crime, my French man, Lindy.

01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:37.040
Inspiring.

01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:39.280
And then to the Bay area, I mean, he has...

01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:43.720
I think it's a relative of ALS, or if it's not...

01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:50.400
It's complicated, but it's that debilitating, but for him, way more congenital.

01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:54.800
Stephen Hawking got to hang out and party in college, and then one day started to find

01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:56.960
out he had this thing that was like...

01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:03.880
Michael's wheelchair bound and has this fancy super villain wheelchair, and his whole life

01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:09.920
is like doing this foundation, this thing where he's coordinating, connecting people

01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:18.040
that affect people with charities that can use that attention to benefit people that

01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:20.600
need benefits.

01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:22.440
And he was there at the...

01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:23.760
I know it's kind of meta.

01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:28.080
He runs a charity for charities, basically, but it's actually well needed.

01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:29.080
We did a show in San Francisco.

01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:30.360
It was an amazing interview.

01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:35.720
We dragged him all the way out into the woods, and he has this crazy electric wheelchair,

01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:41.400
and it was a real nightmare to get him there, and then we lost his episode, and it was terrible.

01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:42.600
We really fucked up.

01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:43.600
We're sorry, Michael.

01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:44.600
We're making it right.

01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:45.600
Avatar's great.

01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:46.600
We're not making it right, but we're...

01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:47.920
No, we're making it right.

01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:48.920
It's great.

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:49.920
I did a great job.

01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:50.920
It's a great show.

01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:51.920
Everybody clap.

01:45:51.920 --> 01:46:02.000
I was just going to say, I wanted to check in this early because you guys should come

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:08.520
back sometime in October because I want to follow the Howard Hughes journey of this pursuit

01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:11.680
of haunted house perfection.

01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:14.720
We're going to check back in with you guys in October, right, before the haunted house

01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:16.200
goes up.

01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:20.040
Preferably, if there's a show before the lights go on, before...

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:24.320
I don't want to talk to you...I'll take anything, but I don't want to...I'd like to not talk

01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:26.200
to you after it's in full swing.

01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:27.440
You'll be busy then anyway.

01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:31.960
I would like to...it would be nice if there's a show right before the big, like...

01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:32.960
Absolutely.

01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:33.960
That would be nice.

01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:38.160
I want you at your highest level of anxiety, like where you're like, I don't have time for

01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:39.160
this.

01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:44.440
I'm going to ask you what's going through your head right now, man.

01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:49.360
How do you like your haunted house now, man?

01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:55.360
And Dan, there's something I want to give you before we end this.

01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:58.840
At what time is it?

01:46:58.840 --> 01:46:59.840
Oh, it's time to end this.

01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:00.840
This is a great time for this.

01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:01.840
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:02.840
Okay.

01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:03.840
Let me go get it.

01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:04.840
Did you want to do it on...

01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:05.840
Okay, all right, yeah.

01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:06.840
We'll do a good ending.

01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:07.840
Hold on.

01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:08.840
Oh, this will be great.

01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:09.840
I don't do good endings.

01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:12.360
Well, we're about to do a good ending.

01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:15.280
I had told Beth I had the gift for her.

01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:18.600
Somebody had cross-stitched the thing that said it was a quote from the show.

01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:25.320
The Eucalyptus Tree Show, it said, now I can't remember the exact quote.

01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:26.320
To be honest, Beth...

01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:29.320
This is like cutting.

01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:32.840
Let's see here.

01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:35.120
We had to remove four Eucalyptus trees.

01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:40.840
They were four 100-year-old Eucalyptus trees, and they were right on the border between

01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:44.080
Dan's and my house.

01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:48.320
We have four young little trees there now.

01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:51.880
And this is a cutting from one of the trees that's growing.

01:47:51.880 --> 01:48:02.640
And it's a little branch, but I wanted to share it with you, and it's an evergreen.

01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:08.040
So I just thought, you know, the four Eucalyptus trees, he was going through his divorce at

01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:09.440
the time.

01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:15.000
And the trees were kind of an analogy.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Did you know...

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Don't be rude.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:29.360
Did you know some six-billion-year-old organism has been drinking this already?

01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:33.760
Did you know Rob Corddry stayed in the Airbnb that's near our place, and he's a fan of the

01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:36.400
podcast, and he is therefore a fan of yours.

01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:42.120
I don't know if you know who Rob Corddry is, but I'm saying you should be excited.

01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:44.120
You don't have to value that.

01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:49.120
But it's cool, he's cool and funny and famous, and he was staying at that Airbnb.

01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:55.360
And he was listening to those episodes, and he was looking at his Wi-Fi, and it said Harmon

01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:59.600
Wi-Fi, because he could see, and then he's like, wait a minute, and then he looked out

01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:04.040
the window and there's Eucalyptus tree stumps, and the one that you were referring to that's

01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:05.040
in my yard?

01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:06.040
Yes.

01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:07.040
Anyways, that was exciting.

01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:10.520
He's on ballers, HBO's ballers.

01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:11.520
There he is.

01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:12.520
That's a picture of Rob Corddry.

01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:14.520
I remember a daily show.

01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:20.880
Well, you know what's funny is on those four Eucalyptus trees, we had stumps that were

01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:24.160
really, really big, because they were big trees.

01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:33.680
And at one point, like I actually stood on this stump to give you some brownies or pancakes

01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:34.680
or something.

01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:35.680
Yeah, muffins or something.

01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:36.680
Some hot shit.

01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:37.680
I ate it.

01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:38.680
Yes.

01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:39.680
It was good.

01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:45.560
So now, then we had the stumps ground, and we were able to plant four little young trees.

01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:48.360
And within the stumps, or what, I don't know, sorry?

01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:51.520
No, they were able to dig down like two feet down below the ground.

01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:54.240
So you got little Eucalyptus babies coming up.

01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:58.800
We had a little baby tree that was probably about this big, and now it's probably about

01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:00.640
four times the size.

01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:06.520
I got to figure, I got to, it's like a joke that I don't care about my other tree.

01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:14.920
I got to get this well-respected arborist's number from you to examine my tree.

01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:16.400
My therapist calls it self-care.

01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:17.400
Oh, okay.

01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:20.040
Like she said, why is your right eye red?

01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:22.800
And I go, I stayed up all night playing Minecraft.

01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:25.400
And she's like, it sounds like you're not happy.

01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:27.000
And I said, no, I love Minecraft.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.240
And she said, but what did you do last night in Minecraft?

01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:30.240
I said, I don't know.

01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:31.240
I was asleep.

01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:34.240
So you're playing Minecraft in your sleep.

01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:37.760
I'll save it for next episode.

01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:44.920
I'm self-destructing, but very happy that Cameron and Ria have their show and that

01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:51.880
it's doing well and that it's good and that you're finding your passion.

01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:52.880
And you don't have to.

01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:53.880
Don't get tricked into it.

01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:56.160
You know, some kids, it's like, oh, I love trains.

01:50:56.160 --> 01:50:57.160
I'm six years old.

01:50:57.160 --> 01:50:58.160
Everybody keeps giving me trains.

01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:00.600
And it's like you're locked into this train thing.

01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:02.400
Like I always worry about those kids.

01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:05.280
Like somebody give this kid a turtle.

01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:07.240
Just give him an out.

01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:09.280
He's boxed in.

01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:10.840
You're 16.

01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:12.720
So this could be, we don't know.

01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:17.080
It could be your big ass haunted mansion thing where you're like, I've done it.

01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:18.080
This is it.

01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:19.680
This is my Burt Reynolds boogie nights.

01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:23.640
This is the one, let the death of this industry begin.

01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:32.080
And you move on to something called hospitality houses, hotels, where when you walk in, you

01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:39.320
don't get scared to the point where you're willing to pay $1,000 for a bay view.

01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:40.320
That's an idea.

01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:45.200
He has no idea what you're talking about when you say Burt Reynolds and boogie nights.

01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:52.200
I do well good because, yeah, a certain amount of clarity makes me a criminal, right?

01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:56.400
I mean, I didn't say, and I'd never said anyone could bring children to the show.

01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:57.400
All right.

01:51:57.400 --> 01:51:58.400
All right.

01:51:58.400 --> 01:51:59.400
Well, so, all right.

01:51:59.400 --> 01:52:03.280
So Steve, oh, it's just Steve got this.

01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:05.280
All right.

01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:06.280
Are you good?

01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:07.280
All right.

01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:08.280
Rap, rap, rap.

01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:09.280
What?

01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:10.280
You want a rap?

01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:11.280
Yeah.

01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:12.280
Yeah.

01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:13.280
Let's get a rap.

01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:14.280
Oh boy.

01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:19.040
And while we queue up the beat, come to some of us this Saturday.

01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:20.040
It'll be great.

01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:21.040
It's a great party.

01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:22.040
The meltdown does.

01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:23.040
It'll be great.

01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:24.040
Pull up the beat.

01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:25.040
Let's do it.

01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:26.040
Thank you.

01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:29.640
Oh, yeah, do some hype, man.

01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:30.640
Yeah.

01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:31.640
Yeah.

01:52:31.640 --> 01:52:32.640
Hype.

01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:33.640
Hype.

01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:34.640
MC Harmon at the house, everybody.

01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:35.640
Hype it.

01:52:35.640 --> 01:52:36.640
Hype it.

01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:37.640
Hype it.

01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:38.640
Hype it.
