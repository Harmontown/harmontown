{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:21.320\nSorry for the delay. It's my fault. I don't know. There might be a word for this. It's\n\n00:21.320 --> 00:27.620\nan Uber thing. I filled out the Uber thing, but I didn't hit the request button. I put\n\n00:27.620 --> 00:33.760\nit back in my pocket. I hate to advertise for Uber, but it's become such a big part\n\n00:33.760 --> 00:37.680\nof my life, and it's so convenient that I didn't notice that I didn't do it all the\n\n00:37.680 --> 00:44.520\nway. Then I looked at 7.45. It was like I pulled out the phone, and it's like, yeah,\n\n00:44.520 --> 00:50.120\nanytime you want to say that you want someone to start thinking about picking you up, it's\n\n00:50.120 --> 00:57.840\nfine, and I was like, Harmon, not a good way to start the show, especially when you're\n\n00:57.840 --> 01:03.840\ngoing to start it late. You don't come out with a dumb, boring story of why you're late.\n\n01:03.840 --> 01:16.160\nDon't do that. Carol will turn on you. He'll turn on you. Thank you, thank you. Said he\n\n01:16.160 --> 01:23.400\nloved me. Choking. Why are we ashamed to do it? We've talked about that. You start choking\n\n01:23.400 --> 01:25.720\nup food, your first instinct. I'm going to get out of here. I'm going to get out of\n\n01:25.720 --> 01:30.520\nthis restaurant. People are going to see me choking. When did we talk about this? I just\n\n01:30.520 --> 01:36.800\nimagine we did, because it seems like we would have. I mean, it is embarrassing to choke,\n\n01:36.800 --> 01:40.560\nbecause you're saying, look at me failing at the only thing we're designed to do as\n\n01:40.560 --> 01:46.140\nhumans. That was Cody's theory, but I wanted to add to that. I think it's also like, our\n\n01:46.140 --> 01:54.840\nthroats are reverse buttholes. They're private to us. It's glottal and gooey. That's the\n\n01:54.840 --> 02:02.440\nthreshold before we consider this to be stinky, gross factory of violence and everything we're\n\n02:02.440 --> 02:09.360\nashamed of. On a deep level, we have body shame. We all worry about, I mean, there's a couple\n\n02:09.360 --> 02:14.280\nof us that don't worry about it, but getting our clothes suddenly ripped off and our body\n\n02:14.280 --> 02:20.360\nbeing laid bare. We think about that as being shame, but we don't even have a word for the\n\n02:20.360 --> 02:25.760\nlevel of shame we have about our actual intestines, like saving Private Ryan when the people are\n\n02:25.760 --> 02:31.160\nwalking around and they're like, oh, God. I'm so embarrassed about this, because they don't\n\n02:31.160 --> 02:37.880\nfeel the pain yet. The pain is not an issue. Right then, they're feeling like, my arm is\n\n02:37.880 --> 02:44.240\noff and they're going, I look like a dick to myself. No one else is going, what a dick.\n\n02:44.240 --> 02:50.880\nBut it's what we feel, and so when you're choking, I mean, I swear to God. Do you think\n\n02:50.880 --> 02:57.120\nthere's something about sphincters that make us shameful like inherently? Wait, about what?\n\n02:57.120 --> 03:01.440\nSphincters. Oh, sphincters. You're saying we're embarrassed of our throat buttholes. Yeah,\n\n03:01.440 --> 03:06.680\nwe, I think that if you present a human being or any biological organism with an image of\n\n03:06.680 --> 03:16.720\na thing that has a sphincter on it, which is a spot in a membrane or a case where things\n\n03:16.720 --> 03:27.680\ncome to an elastic but snug airtight. It sure is, Dan. I think we side with everything\n\n03:27.680 --> 03:36.320\ninside the sphincter, but we also, we are ashamed of it. Like the inside of anything\n\n03:36.320 --> 03:42.680\nthat's sealed off from the outside world represents us shamefully. When push comes to shove, we\n\n03:42.680 --> 03:49.200\nside with the sphincter. Yeah. Well, sphincters are threshold. We side with the dark side\n\n03:49.200 --> 04:01.720\nof the sphincter. Right. With all the shits, sir, yes. Jesus, this audience. All right.\n\n04:01.720 --> 04:06.440\nSo Andy Dick has rescheduled. Yeah, yeah. And I only mentioned it because of the appropriateness\n\n04:06.440 --> 04:18.080\nof it. He and Dina will be back on September 11th. And I think it's okay to say this, but\n\n04:18.080 --> 04:22.200\nI don't even know which week, so you'll just have to keep coming to the show. We got some\n\n04:22.200 --> 04:27.560\nof those Duffer brothers coming today. Yeah, yeah. But we only got, yeah, a lot of people\n\n04:27.560 --> 04:33.280\ndon't know this. There's nine Duff brothers. There's three Duffer, three of the Duffer\n\n04:33.280 --> 04:39.240\nones of the nine are the ones that make the show that you like. But there's two Duffist\n\n04:39.240 --> 04:46.480\nbrothers that they're so Duff they don't even work in entertainment. Like they're just relaxed.\n\n04:46.480 --> 04:54.120\nThose are the people you want on your show. But we got some Duffer brothers. There's weed\n\n04:54.120 --> 05:12.880\noil lube. I don't know. I guess you can put it on your privates. All right. We'll just\n\n05:12.880 --> 05:22.880\ntalk about Trump all night. Who ironically hates children. He hates children. All right.\n\n05:22.880 --> 05:35.160\nSo Obama, he's going to visit the flood zone. Oh shit. Didn't they tell him not to? Oh shit.\n\n05:35.160 --> 05:40.040\nThank you. It's funny when you're the president, you have to visit the disasters. It's kind\n\n05:40.040 --> 05:46.920\nof, I'd realize what would happen if you didn't. And sometimes they don't. But it's funny,\n\n05:46.920 --> 05:51.400\njust the idea of being a president and visiting a disaster is funny. It's hilarious. Because\n\n05:51.400 --> 05:56.800\nit's like, because he's like show, I mean, you know, we need, no, you know, what's he\n\n05:56.800 --> 06:03.880\ngoing to do? He's just like, I mean, I understand it's a symbolic thing. It's like, you do\n\n06:03.880 --> 06:07.960\nwant it to happen, but it is also still funny from a logical perspective. It's like, it's\n\n06:07.960 --> 06:13.800\nvery silly. He's just like, here he is. It's like, here it is. So all the water, from where\n\n06:13.800 --> 06:18.800\nit was to where it shouldn't be. He gets off the plane and is like, whoa. Yeah. This is\n\n06:18.800 --> 06:23.640\nfucked up. You guys are fucked up. Yeah, that's fucked up. And then I'll make a speech and\n\n06:23.640 --> 06:31.640\nI'll go, I talked to Carl, whose house was inundated with water. And Carl will be like,\n\n06:31.640 --> 06:39.920\nthank you for mentioning it. This is, yeah, this is like, you can't make those up in a\n\n06:39.920 --> 06:43.800\nflood, in a flood speech. No, you got to, you got to, he's doing research. He's going\n\n06:43.800 --> 06:50.880\nto get the personal stories. Hello. Did you get flooded? Yes, Mr. President. Okay. Great.\n\n06:50.880 --> 07:03.560\nWhat's your name? Tara. T-A-R-A. Yep. Okay. Flooding for you was bad. Yes. You owned\n\n07:03.560 --> 07:18.240\na lot of dry things. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Do, do, do, do, do. Oh, give me the high sign\n\n07:18.240 --> 07:23.040\nwhen our first guests get here, just so I know, because I'll bring them up. It's a good\n\n07:23.040 --> 07:28.440\nidea. Cool. Oh, Spencer, that, I'm interpreting that as you thinking the show is going poorly.\n\n07:28.440 --> 07:32.600\nOh, it is. It's terrible. Okay. It's going to be a bad show. It's good to be on the same\n\n07:32.600 --> 07:43.520\npage. Sorry, guys. I'm going to face over here for the next five minutes. Okay. Well,\n\n07:43.520 --> 07:48.960\nyou just, at least just come, can she sit up here, at least? That's weirder, isn't it?\n\n07:48.960 --> 08:00.640\nThat's why I follow the weirdness. Let's make children uncomfortable. See, this is bad,\n\n08:00.640 --> 08:08.880\nright? We're having a fun time. Do you want to, do you want to hold a microphone and make\n\n08:08.880 --> 08:16.280\nher voice real loud? She knows that. Do you, do you want to tell us your name? You can,\n\n08:16.280 --> 08:23.520\nit can be a... My name's Madeline. Madeline? Is it Marilyn or Madeline? Madeline. What,\n\n08:23.520 --> 08:29.720\nyou're going to say? You're going to say something? It's okay. I'm, I'm, I've been uncomfortable\n\n08:29.720 --> 08:37.320\nfor 43 years. It's not going to stop. She was telling you something. Did she, do you\n\n08:37.320 --> 08:42.560\nknow what she wanted you to... She was saying her name. It's true. She was. The thing that\n\n08:42.560 --> 08:48.320\nshe was answering was her name. Yeah. Madeline, I guess, I guess you're probably sick of answering\n\n08:48.320 --> 08:53.240\nthis question, but how old are you? Four. Four. You get that all the time, right? That's\n\n08:53.240 --> 08:57.000\nwhere the interview stops. You're like, if another, if another person asks how old I\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:01.360\nam, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to smash a, I can't even do\n\n09:01.360 --> 09:11.760\nany bits of it. Yeah. Don't worry about it. Madeline, so four years, you were born of\n\n09:11.760 --> 09:20.080\nlike when I, I weighed five less pounds. Nothing has really happened in my life since, in the\n\n09:20.080 --> 09:25.520\nlast four years, but for you, it's been a real roller coaster ride. Do you, do you, do you,\n\n09:25.520 --> 09:29.560\nyou don't, you can't, you don't, you don't have prenatal memories, do you? Do you know\n\n09:29.560 --> 09:38.120\nwhat, do you, do you have any idea of, do you remember your birth at all? No. It's probably\n\n09:38.120 --> 09:48.160\ntraumatic. I think it's. This is probably traumatic. I'm sure, I think being born probably\n\n09:48.160 --> 09:57.480\nmakes Vietnam look like a jimboree. We're on vacation, so. Oh, really? So it's a family\n\n09:57.480 --> 10:02.040\nvacation? Okay. Just me and her. So you're saying, but I want you to tell, let these\n\n10:02.040 --> 10:08.760\npeople know at, at home, you're saying I, I don't have to filter my show through four\n\n10:08.760 --> 10:19.720\nyear old ears. No, go for it. Okay. It's your show. All right. Madeline, do you, do you,\n\n10:19.720 --> 10:23.960\ndo you have anything that you're, you're super into, like trains or polar bears or dinosaurs\n\n10:23.960 --> 10:28.240\nor, I mean, you don't have to pick a thing. I don't want to limit my little pony. Like,\n\n10:28.240 --> 10:34.800\nyou know, I don't, I'm not going to pigeonhole you, but, you know, like, maybe a frozen character.\n\n10:34.800 --> 10:47.800\nRick. Oh. She loves, she loves Rick. Rick is her Elsa. It's a, it's a new, it's a, it's,\n\n10:47.800 --> 11:00.600\nit's a new generation. So do, do your parents are, do you admire them or do you ever think\n\n11:00.600 --> 11:06.600\nI act like, like these guys, they don't, they don't know what they're talking about. I asked\n\n11:06.600 --> 11:14.360\nthem who invented peanut butter and jelly and they said they didn't know. Yeah. Yeah. Is\n\n11:14.360 --> 11:19.480\nthe world a happy place? Is it, by and large, is it stress free or is it a stressful place?\n\n11:19.480 --> 11:23.720\nLike when you wake up in the morning or you stressed out, do you feel anxiety? Do you\n\n11:23.720 --> 11:32.600\nknow what anxiety is? I'm sure. Must be nice. Do you get dressed by yourself or do you still\n\n11:32.600 --> 11:42.160\nget dressed? Does everybody need to help you put dress, your dress? I can do it myself.\n\n11:42.160 --> 11:57.480\nIt's great. That's great. How's, are you going to school yet? Do you? I only go to Flamenco.\n\n11:57.480 --> 12:01.440\nYou only go, wait, wait, to, to Flamenco? She, she takes Flamenco classes. Flamenco, she\n\n12:01.440 --> 12:06.560\nonly goes to Flamenco class. She's, she's starting school when you get back, but. You\n\n12:06.560 --> 12:09.960\ndon't know, you know, that's a, that's a dance. You don't know any steps yet. Do you just\n\n12:09.960 --> 12:21.080\nstart it? You don't want to show us a Flamenco dance? That's all right. Privacy is a, is\n\n12:21.080 --> 12:26.680\na scarce thing in this post millennial age. You're, you're part of the new generation\n\n12:26.680 --> 12:37.520\nthat's going to like crave silence and bicycles. She actually has her own YouTube channel.\n\n12:37.520 --> 12:43.280\nThat's why she passed a thousand subscribers. Well, you, we, we should plug it probably.\n\n12:43.280 --> 12:52.040\nWhat's, what's the, what's the YouTube channel? Can we go there? Do you want to do the intro\n\n12:52.040 --> 13:04.680\nfor that? I, I'm daddy. It's, I show my daughter trailers. All right. Well, we, we, we won't\n\n13:04.680 --> 13:08.440\ngo there and freak you out. You can keep, keep practicing and you can come back on the show\n\n13:08.440 --> 13:13.200\nand let us know when you're ready to, ready to share your Flamenco with the public. All\n\n13:13.200 --> 13:18.960\nright, Madeline, you want to go back and, and, and silently wonder what is happening\n\n13:18.960 --> 13:32.720\non this. Oh, she does that. Okay, we'll stick around. All right, fine. I'm really setting\n\n13:32.720 --> 13:40.560\nmyself up for this. Do you think the show is going okay so far? Thank you.\n\n13:40.560 --> 14:03.880\nDidn't matter. Oh my God. Okay. So, oh, do we have, are we, it looks like we have, okay,\n\n14:03.880 --> 14:17.280\nlet's bring out our, our old friends Cameron and Rhea, Cameron Esposito and Rhea Butcher.\n\n14:17.280 --> 14:22.800\nIt's just me right now, Dan. I'm sorry. It's just me right now. I'm so sorry you guys.\n\n14:22.800 --> 14:27.960\nI know that, thank you. I know that people are either fans of Cameron or fans of me.\n\n14:27.960 --> 14:31.360\nSo the people who are only fans of Cameron, I apologize.\n\n14:31.360 --> 14:35.880\nOh man. Well, that means, I'm going to, I'm going to come over there. Great. Dan's coming\n\n14:35.880 --> 14:40.480\nover here. I got to move my chapstick and my shit. Sorry. I have to take my chapstick\n\n14:40.480 --> 14:46.080\nout of my pocket because these jeans are tight. So hello, Dan. All right. Well, so you guys\n\n14:46.080 --> 14:51.240\nhave a heart out. Hello. We have, this is Madeline. Madeline, nice to meet you. Oh, you don't\n\n14:51.240 --> 14:59.600\nknow what this is. I get it. She's four. Right. Yeah. Yeah. But she has a, she has a YouTube\n\n14:59.600 --> 15:03.640\nchannel and she does flamenco. She's taking flamenco lessons. Amazing. All I know about\n\n15:03.640 --> 15:08.920\nher. She's probably a Republican. She's got great shoes. I love your shoes. Fantastic\n\n15:08.920 --> 15:20.920\nshoes. Great. She's adorable. So, okay. So, take my wife. I just, I just, I just watched\n\n15:20.920 --> 15:29.640\nher and she said, Oh, thank you, Dan. It's Cameron and Ria. And you guys, it's very nuanced\n\n15:29.640 --> 15:34.320\nand touching. And it's like, I like, it's, and it's also shot really well. Oh, thank you.\n\n15:34.320 --> 15:39.120\nAnd I like, I like the, the, like, there's a lot of text and tweeting, like, like digital\n\n15:39.120 --> 15:43.240\nstuff. Like, like, that's been a challenge for all of us, like, like, like getting that\n\n15:43.240 --> 15:47.160\ninto our narratives on screen. Yeah. How much of it do you do without feeling like bye-bye\n\n15:47.160 --> 15:51.800\nbirdie bubbles? Absolutely. But, but it works really well. Oh, thank you very much. Cameron\n\n15:51.800 --> 15:58.160\nthroughout the, it works as like a Greek chorus is what, is what, is what. Yeah, because Cameron\n\n15:58.160 --> 16:02.680\nthroughout the thing is like, just like checking in and it just says like, you're like, we\n\n16:02.680 --> 16:06.440\nget it. You're gay. Do you know what's funny about that, Dan? And she'll probably tell\n\n16:06.440 --> 16:11.280\nthis exact same story. So pretend like I didn't tell it once she gets here is that when we\n\n16:11.280 --> 16:18.640\nwere filming that part of that episode, her, an episode of her appearance on Comedy Bang\n\n16:18.640 --> 16:25.960\nBang came out while we were filming it. And she got those exact responses on Twitter in\n\n16:25.960 --> 16:31.280\nactual real life. Right. Even though she had previously written them as kind of an amalgam\n\n16:31.280 --> 16:34.120\nof what she had already gotten. Absolutely. Of everything that it already had, like it\n\n16:34.120 --> 16:38.120\nhad already happened before, but that day, it happened again. So it was perfect. We were\n\n16:38.120 --> 16:43.760\nlike, yeah, this episode is accurate. I'm not stretching. I mean, it is like, I mean,\n\n16:43.760 --> 16:48.000\nif there's any subversion to it, it's subversion is simply in the fact that it's just a nice\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:52.840\nsingle camera sitcom and it's not necessarily driven by any kind of us versus them energy\n\n16:52.840 --> 16:57.640\nin spite of the fact that wait for it. These are two women and they're married. All right,\n\n16:57.640 --> 17:02.120\njust calm down. Will you calm down? I didn't know about that part. I just, I watched, I'm\n\n17:02.120 --> 17:06.080\nnot done watching the whole thing. Maybe there's a mask involved at the end. It would certainly\n\n17:06.080 --> 17:13.120\nmake me more comfortable. Dan, there's a snow globe at the end. But it's not, the world\n\n17:13.120 --> 17:20.560\nis absurd, but it's not absurdly like, it's not like, everyone doesn't understand and\n\n17:20.560 --> 17:24.840\nlike, you know what I mean? Like there's a world of straw dogs, which are like, it's\n\n17:24.840 --> 17:28.760\njust the pretty much normal world, but there's a little bit of mystical realism, just like\n\n17:28.760 --> 17:36.440\na touch to it. I just, I really like the tone. And it's not a spoiler driven thing,\n\n17:36.440 --> 17:40.680\nbut like, because it's just the story, the first episode is the story of you overcoming\n\n17:40.680 --> 17:45.840\nyour fear of committing to this job so much that you would actually quit your real job.\n\n17:45.840 --> 17:51.080\nAnd meanwhile, while she's like, having these like, struggles with whether or not she wants\n\n17:51.080 --> 17:58.040\nto be a comic that mentions you on stage ever. And then she's like, the triumphant return\n\n17:58.040 --> 18:03.000\nthreshold moment is her, you know, like turning sideways to the wings and do it and talking\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:06.160\nto you instead of the audience. And it's really, it's a really nice moment. It's not overly\n\n18:06.160 --> 18:09.200\ncloying or anything. I don't know why you don't need my approval.\n\n18:09.200 --> 18:14.800\nNo, no, Dan, actually, I do. Yeah, yeah, this is like the best moment of my life right\n\n18:14.800 --> 18:15.800\nhere.\n\n18:15.800 --> 18:23.320\nYeah, I don't know if it's that or I'm like, I watched it, I watched it. But it is cool.\n\n18:23.320 --> 18:28.080\nI like that's great. Congratulations. Thank you so much. And CISO is obviously, we're\n\n18:28.080 --> 18:35.600\nall, we're all in the same boat here. Yeah. I got to be a female sword. Yeah. Oh, yeah,\n\n18:35.600 --> 18:45.320\nyour episode of watch Harmon Quest. The most amazing wordplay ever in the history, but\n\n18:45.320 --> 18:50.120\nit's that it's because the guy's name is Sinex, but he gets his snout cut off and Rhea goes\n\n18:50.120 --> 18:58.840\nSinex infection. I think it was like in real time. Now that's Sinex infection. Yeah. That's\n\n18:58.840 --> 19:04.360\nthe thing from the show. It's from the show. Yeah. Oh man, that was great. You know, Spencer.\n\n19:04.360 --> 19:07.800\nHey, Spencer. How are you doing? I have a question about Take My Wife. Can I ask a\n\n19:07.800 --> 19:14.400\nquestion about Take My Wife? Please. How did you decide your characterizations of a married\n\n19:14.400 --> 19:19.680\ncouple? Because obviously you could do, oh, it's just going to be us, but then maybe you\n\n19:19.680 --> 19:23.000\nwant to make things more arch, but then also you might have been like, well, let's write\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:26.480\nthese characters and they'll be based on us, but they'll be characters for the point of\n\n19:26.480 --> 19:31.480\nplots and stuff. And then obviously, you know, you're being a married couple on television.\n\n19:31.480 --> 19:35.320\nSo that comes into play too. So I'm wondering like, what was your thinking there? Well,\n\n19:35.320 --> 19:41.960\nI mean, the way we wrote it was we wrote all the, like basically that season is all stuff\n\n19:41.960 --> 19:47.880\nthat happened. And then some of it is fictionalized so that people aren't like, Hey, that was\n\n19:47.880 --> 19:53.520\nme. You know, so like it's all, some people are like amalgams of experiences and stuff\n\n19:53.520 --> 19:57.960\nlike that. But it's, I think Cameron calls it like, I don't even remember, like fictionally\n\n19:57.960 --> 20:03.360\nautobiographical or something like that. Yeah. Like everything actually happens. So I mean,\n\n20:03.360 --> 20:07.440\nthe thing about the show is it's kind of the lead up to us being married. So we're not\n\n20:07.440 --> 20:12.920\nmarried yet. And it's really us figuring ourselves out within a relationship. And I mean, we\n\n20:12.920 --> 20:17.320\njust sort of wrote out all the stories that we wanted to cover. And in doing that, we\n\n20:17.320 --> 20:21.840\nsort of found the characters of Cameron and Rhea there. So it wasn't ever anything where\n\n20:21.840 --> 20:25.280\nwe're like, okay, well, this, like Rhea is going to be this and Cameron is going to be\n\n20:25.280 --> 20:30.360\nthis. It just sort of organically happened through all that stuff out there. And you\n\n20:30.360 --> 20:36.240\nknow, I just, I just didn't have this conversation, but this thing came up because I didn't know\n\n20:36.240 --> 20:44.800\nhow it, what, what was, what to think about it. But it's a person I know is, is finishing\n\n20:44.800 --> 20:52.040\na pilot and I'm a character in it. The, the, the, and it's like, it, it's like these days,\n\n20:52.040 --> 20:56.520\nI mean, it's like there's a confessional kind of mandate, the golden age of TV or post golden\n\n20:56.520 --> 21:01.160\nage or sacking of TV, whatever's going on right now. The, the, it's kind of like incumbent\n\n21:01.160 --> 21:06.480\nupon people for our audiences of a maximum of a million people that it actually does\n\n21:06.480 --> 21:11.080\nneed to be a little bit, what needs to be passionate, it needs to be personal, it needs\n\n21:11.080 --> 21:14.440\nto be sincere. That doesn't automatically mean it needs to be autobiographical. But then\n\n21:14.440 --> 21:18.200\nagain, it's like kind of the easiest thing to do right now. And TV's never been about\n\n21:18.200 --> 21:22.040\nfighting like and struggling and in terms of the idea. So the easiest thing to do right\n\n21:22.040 --> 21:26.240\nnow is to go, this is me. This is like my world. And this is, this is, that's been a\n\n21:26.240 --> 21:31.360\nmain staple of TV anyway. This has been going through the Carsey Warner filter of like, oh,\n\n21:31.360 --> 21:35.520\nyour standup says you like to use tools. Here's your fictional wife. Here's your set.\n\n21:35.520 --> 21:39.880\nBut, but, but, so we're still at the core of the demand is for, in television is for\n\n21:39.880 --> 21:42.160\nreal people. Why did you just explain that, Dan?\n\n21:42.160 --> 21:46.360\nI would just be like a jacket saleswoman or something, you know what I mean?\n\n21:46.360 --> 21:51.080\nBut the funny thing is the person knows it. So I'm a character in this person's script.\n\n21:51.080 --> 21:56.280\nAnd it's important that I'm 43. It's important that I, I'm at a kind of a more comfortable\n\n21:56.280 --> 22:03.440\nplace in my career than this person is. It's, there's so many details about, about it being\n\n22:03.440 --> 22:08.960\nme that make it, that are important to where that, to the situation this person is in,\n\n22:08.960 --> 22:14.600\nbut it's kind of dumb to go through it and go, make it flan farman. And, but, but, but,\n\n22:14.600 --> 22:18.560\nbut the one, but the thing is then there's a shot where the person is looking at a wall\n\n22:18.560 --> 22:24.000\nof my house and there's like a community poster and all the things like just the things like\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:30.960\ncommunity and whatever else I've done. The, the, there's an Emmy, I guess, I don't know.\n\n22:30.960 --> 22:38.840\nAs far as Oscars, Hugh Jackman hosted, won an Emmy for writing the Oscars. I try not\n\n22:38.840 --> 22:45.160\nto bring it up, but, but, but I was like, I read the thing and I was like, oh, you should\n\n22:45.160 --> 22:53.920\nchange like community to like crazy community college show. I don't know what it was. I\n\n22:53.920 --> 22:59.960\njust think that's an interesting concept when we're doing these like weird, like meta things\n\n22:59.960 --> 23:02.920\nlike what is the rule there? It's kind of like why you ask the question, right? Like,\n\n23:02.920 --> 23:06.680\nwhat do you, what do you, you know, we were in great minds, obviously. And also, I don't\n\n23:06.680 --> 23:11.520\nthink great care was taken in our characterizations beforehand. They just kind of grew out of the\n\n23:11.520 --> 23:14.960\nstoryline. So I was just curious. I don't know. Yeah. It's interesting because it's\n\n23:14.960 --> 23:18.320\nlike, you start with a dynamic like, like, so it's like, oh, it was important that you\n\n23:18.320 --> 23:21.800\nwere working for me and everything kind of bloomed out of that. Yeah. So you get me as\n\n23:21.800 --> 23:31.000\nlike this weird Jack Donaghy to your Liz Lemon. But yeah, it's, it's, it's funny. But boy,\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:37.000\nboy, writing about myself is fascinating. Oh yeah. I got Madeline, don't you think it's\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:46.040\nfascinating? solid no on that one. That makes it when she lets you know things are going\n\n23:46.040 --> 23:50.640\ngood and you feel it. Oh yeah. No, I because she's not, she hasn't developed a moral conscience\n\n23:50.640 --> 23:56.800\nyet. She won't even know what a handshake is. No, she has no reason. She will not smoke\n\n23:56.800 --> 24:05.480\nup your ass. She's like, I like it. I didn't like it. I mean, it's like, like, like, there's\n\n24:05.480 --> 24:09.000\ncertain demographic things that make me go like, well, who cares? It's like, you're not,\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:16.040\nyou know, I'm not going to do a show about the times tables. I don't care. I don't care\n\n24:16.040 --> 24:26.120\nwhat these people find entertaining. I have to express myself. Absolutely. So anyways,\n\n24:26.120 --> 24:46.480\nyou guys hear about these itsy bitsy spiders? She's doing it. She's doing it with her fingers.\n\n24:46.480 --> 24:56.800\nWell now I want one. If they're going to get 20 bucks, then 20 bucks. 20 bucks. Oh man.\n\n24:56.800 --> 25:01.640\nAll right. Well, oh, oh, oh, oh, hey. Oh yeah, we could, yeah, let's, let's do that. I like\n\n25:01.640 --> 25:17.080\nit because I'm, I'm in my wife, Cameron Esposito. Your wife. She's here. Here, you check this\n\n25:17.080 --> 25:21.960\none. Hey, hi. Hello, the audience. This is Madeline. Hey, Madeline. This is Madeline. Yeah. She\n\n25:21.960 --> 25:26.520\nwas just doing a real cool itsy bitsy spider a second ago. You know what? I saw it and\n\n25:26.520 --> 25:37.280\nyou are legit very good at that. It was my idea. It's my idea. I brought it. I came\n\n25:37.280 --> 25:42.280\nup with it. I didn't create it, but I, story by, I adapted it. Definitely like a story by\n\n25:42.280 --> 25:49.200\nstory by for sure. Have you ever gone on a bear hunt, Madeline? Like in, in, yeah, because\n\n25:49.200 --> 25:51.760\nyou haven't been, they don't do it. They don't do that stuff in flamenco school. They're\n\n25:51.760 --> 25:57.680\nlike, you warm up. This isn't kindergarten. Start flamenco. What if she had though, Dan?\n\n25:57.680 --> 26:01.600\nWhat if she had, what does she have on an actual bear hunt and was like, oh, a real one? Oh,\n\n26:01.600 --> 26:04.600\nno, but I was talking about that. You, did you, you know, I probably missed this. You\n\n26:04.600 --> 26:08.560\nguys never like in kindergarten or nursery school, like there was like this. I don't know.\n\n26:08.560 --> 26:12.520\nThere was this thing. I don't think they could still do this. The kids would. You think the\n\n26:12.520 --> 26:18.320\ninternet replaced this? Well, this was before my time, I think. I mean, it seemed very problematic.\n\n26:18.320 --> 26:22.200\nThe teacher, we go, we're going on a bear hunt, bear hunt, bear hunt. I don't know if there\n\n26:22.200 --> 26:25.520\nwas like a chant to it or not, but they would, there was a lot of call and response and they\n\n26:25.520 --> 26:29.200\nwould, so the kids would all go like this. And then they go like, oh, we got to go across\n\n26:29.200 --> 26:30.760\nthe stream. There's a stream.\n\n26:30.760 --> 26:35.080\nThat's true.\n\n26:35.080 --> 26:38.000\nIsn't everything.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:40.800\nI mean, you know, everything's an exercise of conformity.\n\n26:40.800 --> 26:42.680\nEspecially public school.\n\n26:42.680 --> 26:51.480\nKeep, keep in mind, sir, a bear gets hunted and becomes the hunter, not to spoil it, but\n\n26:51.480 --> 26:54.720\nyou go on the whole bear hunt and you see the bear and the bear comes after you and\n\n26:54.720 --> 26:58.480\nyou run and you do all the other stuff. I think, I think it's more an exercise in like\n\n26:58.480 --> 27:02.840\nstory structure because it's like, makes you go backward and forward through a thing. You,\n\n27:02.840 --> 27:06.880\nyou take note of the things you do while you get to the bear. You meet with the goddess\n\n27:06.880 --> 27:12.040\nof seeing the bear. You atone with the father of realizing the bear found you. You recharge\n\n27:12.040 --> 27:16.840\nback across the return threshold and you go home having changed into a kid that, that\n\n27:16.840 --> 27:20.520\ndidn't set fire to the gymnasium.\n\n27:20.520 --> 27:26.120\nDefinitely, definitely storytelling's primary function is to keep young people from burning\n\n27:26.120 --> 27:29.760\ndown whatever white houses are in the vicinity.\n\n27:29.760 --> 27:30.760\nAbsolutely.\n\n27:30.760 --> 27:34.600\nIdeally directing your energy towards a cultural other. Like that's what Campbell says, like\n\n27:34.600 --> 27:40.280\nespecially like adolescent boys need to be like told. The reason why you not only think\n\n27:40.280 --> 27:45.200\nyou could destroy everything right now, but probably could is because of a great thunder\n\n27:45.200 --> 27:52.600\ngod that the neighbors really don't want you to achieve. So hate them and, and, and go\n\n27:52.600 --> 28:02.240\nto, go to math class and register for selective service to the draft, Madeline. If you, if\n\n28:02.240 --> 28:07.000\nyou get drafted, it'll be against cool space bugs.\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:11.200\nYou're going to get a jet pack when you get drafted.\n\n28:11.200 --> 28:19.360\nIt's all right. It's okay. Look, this is going to happen. It's live podcasting. People are\n\n28:19.360 --> 28:23.800\ngoing to, people, there's going to, there's going to be contention.\n\n28:23.800 --> 28:25.800\nWhoa.\n\n28:25.800 --> 28:31.360\nOh no.\n\n28:31.360 --> 28:35.960\nWe don't have security here. By the way, we have like a kid that works in the Alan Moore\n\n28:35.960 --> 28:42.600\nsection. That's just, he's scary, but he's doesn't, he's not, he's doesn't do anything.\n\n28:42.600 --> 28:44.600\nUsually he just watches the watch.\n\n28:44.600 --> 28:45.600\nYeah.\n\n28:45.600 --> 28:48.600\nOh, that's who does it.\n\n28:48.600 --> 28:49.600\nI don't know.\n\n28:49.600 --> 28:51.640\nThat's who does that.\n\n28:51.640 --> 28:55.440\nHe watches the watch, but in a typical Alan Moore fashion, he doesn't really enjoy it\n\n28:55.440 --> 28:56.440\nvery much.\n\n28:56.440 --> 28:58.760\nIt's like, this could have been better.\n\n28:58.760 --> 29:04.840\nAll right. Madeline's, she's, she's usually dance the one that gets bulletproof.\n\n29:04.840 --> 29:07.840\nNow she's warmed up.\n\n29:07.840 --> 29:14.280\nSo Madeline, all right. What's the scariest thing? I'm asking not just because I want\n\n29:14.280 --> 29:16.480\nto scare a child.\n\n29:16.480 --> 29:23.120\nI have other guests coming soon and there's a fear of, a theme of fear. So I'm just wondering,\n\n29:23.120 --> 29:29.000\nis there something that scares you? Like, I could, I could, I'll tell you, spiders scare\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:45.200\nme a lot and clowns and, and, and I guess, I guess like leaving the house, getting into\n\n29:45.200 --> 29:49.320\na shower when, and not knowing that the water is going to get like really hot after I get\n\n29:49.320 --> 29:50.320\ninto it.\n\n29:50.320 --> 29:56.680\nI like this person who's trying to put words in a child's mouth.\n\n29:56.680 --> 30:07.960\nIs that the same person who was like conformity? Failure. I do whatever. Listen kids, say failure.\n\n30:07.960 --> 30:12.280\nIt's Donald Trump's political advisor.\n\n30:12.280 --> 30:16.360\nI saw a thing on a TV ad and the volume was down. So I don't even know, and it's kind\n\n30:16.360 --> 30:20.960\nof cool to not know whether this was a Democratic ad or like a splinter Republican ad, but it\n\n30:20.960 --> 30:24.560\nwas just like, I just saw a bunch of images of Donald Trump and then it was, and then\n\n30:24.560 --> 30:30.000\nit was a negative ad and it said like, Donald Trump, dangerous. And I was like, I liked\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:33.880\nthe fact that I didn't know, that could have been like some weird like group of like Republicans\n\n30:33.880 --> 30:38.520\nthat was like, not weird, like, I guess more normal than the rest like going like, but\n\n30:38.520 --> 30:45.520\nI like that. I like this car. It made me happy because, because I feel like if, if we can\n\n30:45.520 --> 30:50.680\nadmit that we don't like a guy because dangerous, like that's actually, there's a little like\n\n30:50.680 --> 30:54.240\nlobe in my head that goes like, wait, you should be dangerous. And then I go, wait a\n\n30:54.240 --> 30:57.440\nminute. No, we want to be comfortable and we need to admit that more. We need to be\n\n30:57.440 --> 31:02.960\nless hyperbolic about our politics and more like practical and go like, look, look at\n\n31:02.960 --> 31:09.120\nthis guy. He's a turd. Like that's scary. Vote for not scary. Like you always do anyway,\n\n31:09.120 --> 31:12.520\nexcept you pat yourself on the back afterwards and put on a cape and say, I did something\n\n31:12.520 --> 31:17.520\nheroic today by voting for comfort. Like, I think it, you know, like, we're, we're right.\n\n31:17.520 --> 31:21.520\nThere's like good dangerous and bad dangerous. Like when people talk about Hillary and I\n\n31:21.520 --> 31:27.400\nknow people are going to be shocked to find out that I like her. Um, when people talk\n\n31:27.400 --> 31:30.520\nabout Hillary, they talk about her being dangerous, but it's because people will be\n\n31:30.520 --> 31:34.840\nlike, cause she's done like backdoor deals with everybody and she's probably responsible\n\n31:34.840 --> 31:42.800\nfor a lot of murders and she has single handedly met and done every, and I'm like, yeah, sounds\n\n31:42.800 --> 31:50.480\nlike a president. Like sounds like a person that runs this country since the first time\n\n31:50.480 --> 31:56.120\nthat somebody was like, you, you should run this country. Hey, old wooden tooth. Yeah.\n\n31:56.120 --> 32:02.520\nHey, you own people. Do you want to run this place? I mean, like that's, and then, but\n\n32:02.520 --> 32:08.720\nthen it's funny cause now, so there, I feel like that's like dangerous in the way that\n\n32:08.720 --> 32:13.480\nour country has always, that's us. I'm not saying we're great. We have a lot of stuff\n\n32:13.480 --> 32:18.280\nwe can improve on, but that's definitely us. Like that's for sure us. We're terrible.\n\n32:18.280 --> 32:23.720\nWe are, we're the worst. We don't own this place. We stole this place. This blocks the\n\n32:23.720 --> 32:28.320\nmeltdown. Um, no, like we don't know this. We stole this place. We're, we've always\n\n32:28.320 --> 32:34.320\nbeen dangerous. Then it, then he is dangerous in relief to that because his thing is like,\n\n32:34.320 --> 32:45.360\nhaha, I could upload it up, right? Why wouldn't I use the nuclear weapons? Yeah, like, like,\n\n32:45.360 --> 32:53.480\nwhy can't I, why can't we got them? They've just spent a lot of money. Yeah. I mean,\n\n32:53.480 --> 32:57.980\nit is, it is a time in which we've, uh, yeah, I, I, I shamefully find myself just craving\n\n32:57.980 --> 33:01.520\nstatus quo, which I've done a level that I never have. Cause it's like, you're looking\n\n33:01.520 --> 33:06.680\ndown the gaping ma of actual historical like things where you go like, Oh, this is, as\n\n33:06.680 --> 33:12.160\nI've said, and I really again, unashamed, like it's fine. Hitler comparisons are fine.\n\n33:12.160 --> 33:16.040\nThe earlier, the better. That's the point of them. Hitler, the healthy version of a\n\n33:16.040 --> 33:20.680\nHitler comparison is the earliest one in the world, the most premature one. Imagine if\n\n33:20.680 --> 33:24.680\nthe Hitler comparison had happened early on in Hitler's career. If someone had gone,\n\n33:24.680 --> 33:30.120\nthis guy's Hitler, uh, uh, then, you know, they, they, I don't know. Well, there's also\n\n33:30.120 --> 33:33.040\nlike two different types of dangerous. There's like, so there's like, there's like Hitler\n\n33:33.040 --> 33:45.320\ndangerous. And then there's also like, like if you think about a spot. Oh shit. Madeline\n\n33:45.320 --> 33:50.040\ncame down. She said it. Sorry. She said like three minutes ago. I want to talk now. I was\n\n33:50.040 --> 33:54.080\nlike, you can talk if you want to. And then all right, Madeline, let's, let's, let's hear\n\n33:54.080 --> 33:59.280\nit. I mean, I guess what I'm saying is women are the future clearly. What were you going\n\n33:59.280 --> 34:06.120\nto say, Madeline? Oh, you just said it. You just said blah, blah, blah. You just, I mean,\n\n34:06.120 --> 34:09.200\nI can't tell you your four or so. I don't know if that's mocking us or if that's actually\n\n34:09.200 --> 34:14.920\nlike half of what you know how to say. Oh no, it's mocking us. I feel like for the podcast,\n\n34:14.920 --> 34:21.560\nshe's going to sound even younger, like an actual baby was up here. Uh, well, maybe that\n\n34:21.560 --> 34:31.560\nwill be next week. Oh yeah. Uh, hey, Madeline, uh, I heard that you are a fart head. Oh\n\n34:31.560 --> 34:40.840\nboy. I don't know that this is healthy. It's actually okay. There are adult men mouth a\n\n34:40.840 --> 34:52.080\ngape at that. I just, I looked at this dude specifically and he went like, it's actually\n\n34:52.080 --> 34:53.800\nright. Tudes fired. It's actually right up our alley. Do you want to tell them our nickname\n\n34:53.800 --> 35:00.080\nfor each other? Okay. Well, then I'll tell them cause you're a butt head. Oh boy. I call\n\n35:00.080 --> 35:04.920\neach other butt heads and stuff. All right. Well, we have to make room for my, my neighbors\n\n35:04.920 --> 35:11.920\nare coming up and they have a special, uh, you guys remember Beth Bootson, right? Oh\n\n35:11.920 --> 35:19.000\nno. Oh, this is the dark side of show business. No, Madeline, you're still going to be, you're\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:30.600\ngoing to be right there. Oh God. Oh, Spencer gets to be proven right again. Yeah man. But\n\n35:30.600 --> 35:35.640\nthink about this Spencer, if we hadn't gone through all of that, no show. It's not that\n\n35:35.640 --> 35:40.720\nI'm happy about being right all the time. It's just that I see it when it's going to\n\n35:40.720 --> 35:45.120\nhappen. Yeah. Yeah. But what if I saw it too? What was I supposed to do? I did the, the\n\n35:45.120 --> 35:50.600\nspot. What was I supposed to do? No, it's great. This is a great show. Let's, how, how\n\n35:50.600 --> 35:57.040\nis it? How about that? Take my wife? Uh, don't you guys have a hard out not that long. Yeah.\n\n35:57.040 --> 36:00.960\nI can't. Cameron, there's a, there's a, there's a scene in Take My Wife where you're out at\n\n36:00.960 --> 36:06.280\nlunch and you're in like an outdoor, uh, restaurant. Oh, I can't. I'm sorry, Madeline. Here, you'll\n\n36:06.280 --> 36:11.000\nbe okay. She did great. I just, I just don't know. I didn't like the sound of my own voice\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:15.040\ntalking at the same time as a, as a person that was like sobbing and I'm like, like I'm\n\n36:15.040 --> 36:22.760\nignoring it. Like it's some Orwellian thing. I'm sort of a get that baby out of here. Oh\n\n36:22.760 --> 36:27.160\nman. That's what, that's why I'm like, I'm like, I can't let anybody know. Now I know why. Let's not do\n\n36:27.160 --> 36:35.480\nthat. Yeah. When we say we're okay with this, we don't change our stance. I've, I've, I love it.\n\n36:35.480 --> 36:41.040\nThis is what America is all about. Uh, I learned from a hit Pixar movie, uh, that, that feeling\n\n36:41.040 --> 36:49.000\nsad is just as much a part of life as feeling good. Yeah. And I, and I, and I, and I learned\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:57.600\nthat while losing my Oscar. And I thought, that's fine. That's what that movie that took\n\n36:57.600 --> 37:06.720\nmy Oscar, uh, said. This is fine. And I cried and I loved it. The mom, the mom was controlled\n\n37:06.720 --> 37:17.800\nby sadness. Great film. So there's a scene where your, uh, Cameron's out on a, uh, she's\n\n37:17.800 --> 37:23.240\neating lunch at an outdoor, uh, cafe, but there's like, it's, and, and Ria's blowing up in the,\n\n37:23.240 --> 37:26.360\nand then there's like, there's one shot of you and it's like pushing on you and you're\n\n37:26.360 --> 37:29.640\nlike, or I don't think it's pushing on you. It's just like the static. There's no music\n\n37:29.640 --> 37:35.240\nand it's just you by yourself at a restaurant. Like, do you, do you, do you, do you like\n\n37:35.240 --> 37:39.600\nthe, do you, do you know the, like expression I'm thinking of? Like when you're like, you're\n\n37:39.600 --> 37:45.120\nkind of like, is it just you? Like, are you, are you going through like, like, is it, is\n\n37:45.120 --> 37:51.680\nit, is it like, it's like a, it's like a, cause we're, cause we're, cause we're not specifically\n\n37:51.680 --> 37:55.240\ntracking in that moment that it's, it's like, are you just uncomfortable in your own skin?\n\n37:55.240 --> 37:56.240\nLike you're, cause you're alone.\n\n37:56.240 --> 37:57.240\nYes. Yeah.\n\n37:57.240 --> 38:04.920\nRight. No. That I actually know exactly what you're asking. Um, yeah, it's supposed to\n\n38:04.920 --> 38:10.160\nbe not knowing where to focus energy, right? So like, I'm just sitting by myself alone\n\n38:10.160 --> 38:15.160\nat a cafe and thinking, maybe I see somebody that I know, right? Like awkwardly waving\n\n38:15.160 --> 38:20.920\nthere and then I kind of like hide and, uh, crawl inside of myself and right after you\n\n38:20.920 --> 38:24.800\ndo that, you like wave and you go, no, like that. And then a leaf falls in the background.\n\n38:24.800 --> 38:29.160\nI guess I obviously wasn't planned, but I love it so much. Why do you think that wasn't\n\n38:29.160 --> 38:35.280\nplanned? Like dead leaf, just fault the last, I was, I told it to do that. We had a serious\n\n38:35.280 --> 38:41.280\nrig and they were like, let the leaf go. Get the one leaf. Get the leaf. Get the leaf.\n\n38:41.280 --> 38:42.280\nIt's like 10. Okay.\n\n38:42.280 --> 38:43.280\nOkay.\n\n38:43.280 --> 38:45.280\nLeave to one and bring the leaf to one.\n\n38:45.280 --> 38:49.280\nBring the leaf to one and leaf it.\n\n38:49.280 --> 38:54.280\nLeave it. Action.\n\n38:54.280 --> 39:00.280\nThe leaf industry doesn't have more precise language than this thing. And leaf it. Well,\n\n39:00.280 --> 39:06.280\nthat could mean 5,000 things. I'm a union employee who solely focuses on leaves and you\n\n39:06.280 --> 39:12.280\njust say leaf it. Do you want to blow across a detective's driveway?\n\n39:12.280 --> 39:19.280\nI would love to see the leaf person on like every show, just like leaf blowers attached\n\n39:19.280 --> 39:20.280\nto the belt.\n\n39:20.280 --> 39:24.280\nIt seems like the leaf person on a set is one of those jobs that has a name that doesn't\n\n39:24.280 --> 39:27.280\nhave leaf or a Latin like root of leaf.\n\n39:27.280 --> 39:28.280\nRare.\n\n39:28.280 --> 39:33.280\nSomething like a squibbler. And you find out it's the leaf wrangler. And if you ever\n\n39:33.280 --> 39:34.280\ncall him that.\n\n39:34.280 --> 39:35.280\nOr her.\n\n39:35.280 --> 39:40.280\nAbsolutely. Thank you, Dan. Great point. Great point. That's a great point.\n\n39:40.280 --> 39:46.280\nThat's amazing. That's amazing. You know, you didn't have to use that second pronoun.\n\n39:46.280 --> 39:49.280\nYou did. And that shows you here.\n\n39:49.280 --> 39:50.280\nNot bad.\n\n39:50.280 --> 39:51.280\nThat's amazing.\n\n39:51.280 --> 39:52.280\nThat's really what we mean.\n\n39:52.280 --> 39:54.280\nThe acknowledgement of women.\n\n39:54.280 --> 39:55.280\nRight.\n\n39:55.280 --> 39:58.280\nThere sure are women.\n\n39:58.280 --> 40:05.280\nDo you know what is right next year? Dan, did you see our not appointing this way?\n\n40:05.280 --> 40:08.280\nThere's a billboard with our dumb faces on it.\n\n40:08.280 --> 40:09.280\nOh yeah.\n\n40:09.280 --> 40:12.280\nActually, I didn't know there was one here in this neighborhood, but I saw it.\n\n40:12.280 --> 40:14.280\nOh yeah, right by the Chipotle.\n\n40:14.280 --> 40:20.280\nYou guys took me off. You replaced me. That's great. That's what it should be.\n\n40:20.280 --> 40:24.280\nThat's what television should be, I think, right?\n\n40:24.280 --> 40:33.280\nReplacing you with me a white male. Yeah, that's what we need.\n\n40:33.280 --> 40:38.280\nI think. Thank you. Thank you.\n\n40:38.280 --> 40:43.280\nI just want to acknowledge that two dudes are being applauded for their bravery.\n\n40:43.280 --> 40:45.280\nOh, no, we are very brave.\n\n40:45.280 --> 40:53.280\nIn acknowledging that women are cool and you guys are pretty light on the claps for Rhea and I.\n\n40:53.280 --> 40:58.280\nNo, we went and we asked a stranger to take a picture.\n\n40:58.280 --> 41:02.280\nWe just stopped a stranger and we went over to the billboard and we were standing in front of it.\n\n41:02.280 --> 41:06.280\nAnd we asked a woman who was passing by, we were like, hey, do you mind taking a picture of us?\n\n41:06.280 --> 41:11.280\nAnd she was like, oh sure, like just what, like in front of what?\n\n41:11.280 --> 41:16.280\nBecause we were like just on the street and then we were like, um.\n\n41:16.280 --> 41:20.280\nAnd it was actually so cute because she goes, oh my god, you guys!\n\n41:20.280 --> 41:27.280\nShe gave us a giant hug and like, this is a stranger. We did not know this person.\n\n41:27.280 --> 41:33.280\nWas it, was it, oh my god, you guys, I didn't recognize you and I actually knew you from before?\n\n41:33.280 --> 41:36.280\nOr is it, oh my god, you're two other human beings and you're on that billboard?\n\n41:36.280 --> 41:40.280\nYeah, she was like, I'm so proud of you! You're making it!\n\n41:40.280 --> 41:46.280\nI'm so proud of you! Who are you?\n\n41:46.280 --> 41:50.280\nIt was very cute. It was like a cute moment. She took a bunch of pictures.\n\n41:50.280 --> 41:53.280\nShe was like, check them, make sure you check them.\n\n41:53.280 --> 41:57.280\nI don't want to be the one to mess this up for you!\n\n41:57.280 --> 42:03.280\nAnd then a guy was like running headphones came by and he went, hey, that's you!\n\n42:03.280 --> 42:08.280\nBecause he had his headphones in and he was like this close and I was like, yeah, yeah, thank you.\n\n42:08.280 --> 42:10.280\nHe yelled it so loud.\n\n42:10.280 --> 42:12.280\nIt was really horrible. It was fun.\n\n42:12.280 --> 42:13.280\nBut also loud.\n\n42:13.280 --> 42:16.280\nIt was super fun. It was a fun time.\n\n42:16.280 --> 42:18.280\nI don't know, I don't think, except maybe in cartoon form, there was a Harmon Quest billboard.\n\n42:18.280 --> 42:22.280\nI don't think I've ever, that's a feeling I don't know.\n\n42:22.280 --> 42:26.280\nI don't know, like, look, there's your bed's all big.\n\n42:26.280 --> 42:29.280\nIt feels pretty good.\n\n42:29.280 --> 42:33.280\nOkay, I don't even know. Do you pull over the car?\n\n42:33.280 --> 42:35.280\nOh yeah, we parked and got Chipotle.\n\n42:35.280 --> 42:41.280\nWe literally did eat that at the Chipotle that's directly under the thing of us, which is like shameful.\n\n42:41.280 --> 42:45.280\nWere you able to just look at it while you ate?\n\n42:45.280 --> 42:51.280\nWe went around the corner so that we were not near there, but there definitely were people who were eating at Chipotle that were like...\n\n42:51.280 --> 42:57.280\nThere's something very familiar about all this.\n\n42:57.280 --> 43:03.280\nI have to get a quote in for Back to the Future at some point.\n\n43:03.280 --> 43:11.280\nAlright, so you guys, I heard a rumor that you guys needed to get out of here at 9.\n\n43:11.280 --> 43:14.280\nI do, you can stay, yeah?\n\n43:14.280 --> 43:16.280\nI can stay, yeah.\n\n43:16.280 --> 43:18.280\nI mean, I didn't mean to put you on this one.\n\n43:18.280 --> 43:20.280\nNo, yeah, you can, I'll meet you at home.\n\n43:20.280 --> 43:22.280\nWe live together.\n\n43:22.280 --> 43:24.280\nWe live together.\n\n43:24.280 --> 43:32.280\nI'm ready to teach Donald Trump a thing or two about being dangerous.\n\n43:36.280 --> 43:39.280\nYes, I live with my wife.\n\n43:39.280 --> 43:40.280\nYeah.\n\n43:40.280 --> 43:42.280\nSo dangerous.\n\n43:42.280 --> 43:46.280\nYou missed me proving that I've seen the first episode of the show before you got here.\n\n43:46.280 --> 43:47.280\nHe did prove it.\n\n43:47.280 --> 43:48.280\nAnd then I liked it very much.\n\n43:48.280 --> 43:49.280\nHe liked it very much.\n\n43:49.280 --> 43:54.280\nWe are so stoked because it got, like, a bunch of people cared about it.\n\n43:54.280 --> 43:57.280\nAnd I mean, honestly, you know what this is like.\n\n43:57.280 --> 44:02.280\nThis was the first time for me, you spent a lot of time and space in television,\n\n44:02.280 --> 44:06.280\nand you know that a lot of things nobody, a bunch of people were like, cool.\n\n44:06.280 --> 44:08.280\nAnd then we were like, awesome.\n\n44:08.280 --> 44:10.280\nThank you guys.\n\n44:10.280 --> 44:18.280\nYeah, and there may be a time when that nightmare that you were maybe dreading,\n\n44:18.280 --> 44:20.280\nthat'll have to happen too.\n\n44:20.280 --> 44:24.280\nBut both of them will be like, you'll wake up the next morning alive.\n\n44:24.280 --> 44:26.280\nIt's like a bingo card.\n\n44:26.280 --> 44:31.280\nI remember this thing that we did, this pilot in the 90s.\n\n44:31.280 --> 44:33.280\nAnd it was just like, no, we don't want that.\n\n44:33.280 --> 44:35.280\nAnd like, I don't want that.\n\n44:35.280 --> 44:40.280\nIt just went to the car.\n\n44:40.280 --> 44:45.280\nIt was a really, it was a good thing because it was like my salty hot tears.\n\n44:45.280 --> 44:47.280\nI was like, I'm not crying because I'm a spoiled baby.\n\n44:47.280 --> 44:50.280\nI am a spoiled baby, but that's not why I'm crying.\n\n44:50.280 --> 44:53.280\nI'm crying because I really, really care.\n\n44:53.280 --> 44:54.280\nAnd that's a good thing.\n\n44:54.280 --> 44:58.280\nAnd it's like, there is, you're not receptive to it in that moment.\n\n44:58.280 --> 45:02.280\nIt does nothing feels like you're getting good or better.\n\n45:02.280 --> 45:07.280\nBut what is happening in that moment is like the germination of some kind of seed where you're like,\n\n45:07.280 --> 45:09.280\nwell, one thing's for sure, I belong here.\n\n45:09.280 --> 45:16.280\nBecause this is like, I don't like people not watching me.\n\n45:16.280 --> 45:20.280\nThere's no romantic or charismatic way to put it.\n\n45:20.280 --> 45:24.280\nI actually think maybe this was the first experience I've had in my career that wasn't that.\n\n45:24.280 --> 45:28.280\nAnd I don't mean that like, of course, it's been bit by bit.\n\n45:28.280 --> 45:32.280\nAnd success by success, it's not like I've been toiling in obscurity.\n\n45:32.280 --> 45:36.280\nBut for 15 years, I feel like there have been very loud noises,\n\n45:36.280 --> 45:38.280\nvery loud voices that really liked what I was doing,\n\n45:38.280 --> 45:41.280\nand very loud voices that wanted me to stop talking about being gay.\n\n45:41.280 --> 45:45.280\nAnd that that was like a thing that I heard just so many times,\n\n45:45.280 --> 45:48.280\njust like, this person is not funny, stop talking about being gay.\n\n45:48.280 --> 45:49.280\nWe don't care about this.\n\n45:49.280 --> 45:50.280\nAnd then-\n\n45:50.280 --> 45:51.280\nWe get it.\n\n45:51.280 --> 45:52.280\nYeah, we get it.\n\n45:52.280 --> 45:53.280\nYou're gay.\n\n45:53.280 --> 45:54.280\nWe get it.\n\n45:54.280 --> 45:55.280\nYou're gay.\n\n45:55.280 --> 45:56.280\nWe get it.\n\n45:56.280 --> 45:58.280\nYou guys will be my epitaph, like for sure.\n\n45:58.280 --> 45:59.280\nIt should be your-\n\n45:59.280 --> 46:00.280\nNo, it should be-\n\n46:00.280 --> 46:01.280\nWe got it.\n\n46:01.280 --> 46:02.280\nShe was gay.\n\n46:02.280 --> 46:03.280\nYeah.\n\n46:03.280 --> 46:04.280\nNo, I know.\n\n46:04.280 --> 46:06.280\nI have tweeted.\n\n46:06.280 --> 46:09.280\nNo, I mean, that will be my epitaph.\n\n46:09.280 --> 46:10.280\nButch-tag dead.\n\n46:10.280 --> 46:11.280\nBut you know.\n\n46:14.280 --> 46:17.280\nBut this was really like a huge weight off the shoulders,\n\n46:17.280 --> 46:21.280\nbecause like the New York Times and Vulture and Indie Wire and Navy Club were just like,\n\n46:21.280 --> 46:22.280\nwe get it.\n\n46:22.280 --> 46:23.280\nShe's gay.\n\n46:23.280 --> 46:24.280\nBut they were like, we get it.\n\n46:24.280 --> 46:25.280\nShe's gay.\n\n46:25.280 --> 46:27.280\nAnd I was like, so it was really nuts.\n\n46:27.280 --> 46:28.280\nSo was the other one.\n\n46:28.280 --> 46:29.280\nYeah.\n\n46:31.280 --> 46:33.280\nI'm just talking about my experience.\n\n46:33.280 --> 46:34.280\nOh, I know.\n\n46:34.280 --> 46:35.280\nI'm just riffing.\n\n46:35.280 --> 46:36.280\nThat's all.\n\n46:36.280 --> 46:37.280\nYeah.\n\n46:37.280 --> 46:38.280\nI don't think-\n\n46:38.280 --> 46:41.280\nI'm not Dr. Phil, but I don't think Rhea was saying that you were trans-\n\n46:41.280 --> 46:42.280\nI thought-\n\n46:42.280 --> 46:43.280\nAnyways, alright.\n\n46:44.280 --> 46:45.280\nWell, you-\n\n46:45.280 --> 46:46.280\nWe'll deal with this later.\n\n46:46.280 --> 46:47.280\nYou know.\n\n46:48.280 --> 46:49.280\nSomebody-\n\n46:49.280 --> 46:52.280\nPeople are also really stoked about Rhea in this show, which is really cool.\n\n46:52.280 --> 46:55.280\nIt's like a real breakout moment for her, and it's really awesome.\n\n46:58.280 --> 47:01.280\nWell, I assume that's going to be a theme of the-\n\n47:04.280 --> 47:06.280\nIs that going to be the theme of the show?\n\n47:06.280 --> 47:09.280\nBecause I've seen one episode, but is that a thing?\n\n47:09.280 --> 47:16.280\nI mean, regardless of gender persuasion, what are the other things?\n\n47:16.280 --> 47:22.280\nPrismatology, cosmological shiftage.\n\n47:22.280 --> 47:26.280\nContinuum of repus-\n\n47:30.280 --> 47:34.280\nRegardless of two people doing the same thing at the same time,\n\n47:34.280 --> 47:38.280\nautomatically, is there a story coming up?\n\n47:38.280 --> 47:40.280\nAnd if not, is there-\n\n47:40.280 --> 47:42.280\nWell, is there-\n\n47:42.280 --> 47:46.280\nPeople want to drive a wedge between those things.\n\n47:46.280 --> 47:49.280\nWe eat lobster by breaking it open.\n\n47:49.280 --> 47:52.280\nIf you guys are delicious as a couple,\n\n47:52.280 --> 47:58.280\ninevitably, the consuming of you as a couple is going to involve people\n\n47:58.280 --> 48:04.280\ntesting the hinges of the claw, putting pressure on the-\n\n48:04.280 --> 48:06.280\nHave you experienced that?\n\n48:06.280 --> 48:08.280\nDo you know that's coming?\n\n48:08.280 --> 48:09.280\nYeah.\n\n48:09.280 --> 48:11.280\nI mean, I think it's been there the whole time.\n\n48:11.280 --> 48:14.280\nPeople will ask us if we're competitive with each other,\n\n48:14.280 --> 48:17.280\nwhich is the funniest thing to ask to stand-up comics,\n\n48:17.280 --> 48:20.280\nbecause you wouldn't do this job\n\n48:20.280 --> 48:26.280\nif you didn't think you were the best stand-up comic to ever exist, period.\n\n48:26.280 --> 48:30.280\nLike, there's no other reason you would do this to yourself,\n\n48:30.280 --> 48:32.280\nand also it's a total privilege in what a ridiculous thing say,\n\n48:32.280 --> 48:35.280\nbut I just mean, you wouldn't get up on stage and fail this much\n\n48:35.280 --> 48:37.280\nif you weren't like, I'll show them.\n\n48:37.280 --> 48:42.280\nSo, Ria, do you think you're a better stand-up comic than me?\n\n48:42.280 --> 48:44.280\nAbsolutely.\n\n48:44.280 --> 48:45.280\nYeah.\n\n48:45.280 --> 48:47.280\nNo, but like you do, right?\n\n48:47.280 --> 48:48.280\nYeah, of course.\n\n48:48.280 --> 48:52.280\nLike, you want what's best for me and you love me so much.\n\n48:52.280 --> 48:54.280\nYeah, yeah, I want you to totally succeed,\n\n48:54.280 --> 48:56.280\nbut I am going to succeed more than you.\n\n48:56.280 --> 48:57.280\nRight.\n\n48:57.280 --> 49:00.280\nSo what I want to do is, I want to lift you up,\n\n49:00.280 --> 49:02.280\nand I want people to see how great you are\n\n49:02.280 --> 49:05.280\nand to see you through my eyes and just like to love you,\n\n49:05.280 --> 49:07.280\nyou want to, you know, put a foot on your face\n\n49:07.280 --> 49:10.280\nand kick you back down.\n\n49:10.280 --> 49:13.280\nShe's like a grappling hook or a fire ladder.\n\n49:13.280 --> 49:14.280\nYeah.\n\n49:14.280 --> 49:17.280\nI lift you up, I hook you into something above me\n\n49:17.280 --> 49:20.280\nthat is soft enough to secure anchor.\n\n49:20.280 --> 49:21.280\nI climb over you.\n\n49:21.280 --> 49:23.280\nThat's exactly right.\n\n49:23.280 --> 49:24.280\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n49:24.280 --> 49:25.280\nYeah, but I think what you're,\n\n49:25.280 --> 49:27.280\nI thought maybe where you were going was that,\n\n49:27.280 --> 49:29.280\noh, it's actually easier in such a,\n\n49:29.280 --> 49:32.280\nwhen you combine a naturally,\n\n49:32.280 --> 49:36.280\nthe universe will seek to find Crevice's thing\n\n49:36.280 --> 49:38.280\nlike being a couple,\n\n49:38.280 --> 49:41.280\nthat that's entropy and the outside world will do its work\n\n49:41.280 --> 49:43.280\nas sure as water does,\n\n49:43.280 --> 49:45.280\nyou drop anything into a glass of it and the water,\n\n49:45.280 --> 49:46.280\nit may look pretty,\n\n49:46.280 --> 49:48.280\nbut the water is silently going like,\n\n49:48.280 --> 49:50.280\nis there a way to pick this apart, you know?\n\n49:50.280 --> 49:52.280\nAnyways, that's a tangent,\n\n49:52.280 --> 49:55.280\nbut I'll tell it to my chemist.\n\n49:55.280 --> 50:01.280\nDan's actually incorrect about the properties of water.\n\n50:01.280 --> 50:03.280\nSubreddit.\n\n50:07.280 --> 50:11.280\nBut I thought maybe what you were getting at was that,\n\n50:11.280 --> 50:14.280\nbecause stand-ups are so ridiculously solipsistic,\n\n50:14.280 --> 50:17.280\nso narcissistic, so like,\n\n50:17.280 --> 50:21.280\nthat actually it is an easy thing to just put two of them\n\n50:21.280 --> 50:24.280\nin a house together and let them both try to be stand-ups\n\n50:24.280 --> 50:28.280\nand there's a kind of select few situations\n\n50:28.280 --> 50:33.280\nin which that Ernie and Burt partnership could be turned\n\n50:33.280 --> 50:36.280\ninto like enmity or jealousy,\n\n50:36.280 --> 50:39.280\nbut those things would be offset if Ernie and Burt were like also,\n\n50:39.280 --> 50:43.280\nthen they're, okay, we're actually living together\n\n50:43.280 --> 50:45.280\nbecause we love each other.\n\n50:45.280 --> 50:46.280\nLike they do.\n\n50:46.280 --> 50:47.280\nYeah, no, right.\n\n50:47.280 --> 50:48.280\nThey're totally a couple.\n\n50:48.280 --> 50:50.280\nBut actually, yeah, I think you are right.\n\n50:50.280 --> 50:54.280\nI mean, I will say I don't feel a ton of jealousy.\n\n50:54.280 --> 50:56.280\nI feel competition in our relationship\n\n50:56.280 --> 50:59.280\nand I feel, but I don't feel jealous.\n\n50:59.280 --> 51:00.280\nHere's what I worry about.\n\n51:00.280 --> 51:02.280\nMy girlfriend, here's what I worry about.\n\n51:02.280 --> 51:04.280\nI'm not trying to bend it back to me.\n\n51:04.280 --> 51:05.280\nBend it like it.\n\n51:05.280 --> 51:07.280\nBut if I did, it would go something like this.\n\n51:07.280 --> 51:10.280\nThe ghost of Jeff is everywhere.\n\n51:10.280 --> 51:13.280\nI worry about with Cody,\n\n51:13.280 --> 51:15.280\nwho's 11, 12 years younger than me,\n\n51:15.280 --> 51:17.280\nand who I want, I'm so tired.\n\n51:17.280 --> 51:18.280\nI don't want to work.\n\n51:18.280 --> 51:19.280\nI swear, I think of that.\n\n51:19.280 --> 51:20.280\nI don't want to work anymore.\n\n51:20.280 --> 51:22.280\nAnd I'm like, so I have fantasies about her,\n\n51:22.280 --> 51:23.280\nyou know, Celine Dionning,\n\n51:23.280 --> 51:25.280\nand I can be that guy with the beard\n\n51:25.280 --> 51:28.280\nthat could just be like, I love Celine Dion.\n\n51:28.280 --> 51:30.280\nI'm so old and lucky.\n\n51:30.280 --> 51:32.280\nWell, then you should have got to her younger, honestly.\n\n51:32.280 --> 51:35.280\nThat is a really specific Celine Dion joke.\n\n51:35.280 --> 51:38.280\nIf you understood Celine like I did,\n\n51:38.280 --> 51:39.280\nthat would be so funny.\n\n51:39.280 --> 51:41.280\nIt's okay, we can move on.\n\n51:41.280 --> 51:43.280\nBut I have a weird feeling.\n\n51:43.280 --> 51:46.280\nCould you stop talking about Celine Dion on podcasts?\n\n51:46.280 --> 51:50.280\nThat's just a joke for anyone that's watched the show.\n\n51:50.280 --> 51:52.280\nBut yes, go ahead.\n\n51:52.280 --> 51:55.280\nI have a weird feeling that I would get,\n\n51:55.280 --> 51:58.280\nas soon as it wouldn't be about achievement,\n\n51:58.280 --> 52:00.280\nI wouldn't want anybody,\n\n52:00.280 --> 52:02.280\nit's not that I don't, wait,\n\n52:02.280 --> 52:04.280\nI'm just trying to stack these negatives\n\n52:04.280 --> 52:05.280\nlike a Jenga tower here.\n\n52:05.280 --> 52:08.280\nIt's not that I don't want my partner\n\n52:08.280 --> 52:10.280\nto be successful, far from it.\n\n52:10.280 --> 52:14.280\nI want, like, I consider that such an ironic concept\n\n52:14.280 --> 52:16.280\nfor anyone to be, as you were talking about,\n\n52:16.280 --> 52:17.280\nthat same thing.\n\n52:17.280 --> 52:21.280\nIt's like, that's such a hilarious idea.\n\n52:21.280 --> 52:24.280\nI am so behind it.\n\n52:24.280 --> 52:27.280\nBut at the same time, that feels like sincerity.\n\n52:27.280 --> 52:29.280\nLike, oh my God, my fantasy would be\n\n52:29.280 --> 52:34.280\nthat you would be like, just like,\n\n52:34.280 --> 52:37.280\nthe idea of me being jealous of someone's success.\n\n52:37.280 --> 52:39.280\nLike, I would love that, I would love that.\n\n52:39.280 --> 52:42.280\nBut I do, and I think the thing that I would screw up\n\n52:42.280 --> 52:45.280\nis that I would, it would just be regular jealousy\n\n52:45.280 --> 52:48.280\nbecause I would think, I would turn it into a thing\n\n52:48.280 --> 52:51.280\nwhere I was like, oh, she's out there with people.\n\n52:51.280 --> 52:54.280\nIt would be a sexual thing.\n\n52:54.280 --> 52:59.280\nIt wouldn't be, I wouldn't have career jealousy,\n\n52:59.280 --> 53:02.280\nbut it would quickly turn into a gateway\n\n53:02.280 --> 53:04.280\nto something I still haven't figured out,\n\n53:04.280 --> 53:06.280\nwhich is like, how to not be.\n\n53:06.280 --> 53:09.280\nLike, I don't trust myself to not be like,\n\n53:09.280 --> 53:11.280\noh, that guy is so cuter.\n\n53:11.280 --> 53:13.280\nLike, what, just be with him.\n\n53:13.280 --> 53:15.280\nAnd then it just drives me nuts.\n\n53:15.280 --> 53:17.280\nI'm just gonna sit home and play Minecraft\n\n53:17.280 --> 53:19.280\nand take care of our baby.\n\n53:19.280 --> 53:21.280\nAnd then I'm just gonna be like,\n\n53:21.280 --> 53:25.280\nobviously she would be in love with anybody but me right now.\n\n53:25.280 --> 53:29.280\nBut don't awe it because that's horrible serial killer stuff\n\n53:29.280 --> 53:31.280\nwith a support system.\n\n53:31.280 --> 53:32.280\nLike, it's not, you shouldn't,\n\n53:32.280 --> 53:34.280\nbecause that's jealousy and it's toxic and it's gross.\n\n53:34.280 --> 53:36.280\nI don't mean to tell you that lesbians are awesome,\n\n53:36.280 --> 53:39.280\nbut you know what's a cool thing about being\n\n53:39.280 --> 53:41.280\nin the same sex couple is that...\n\n53:41.280 --> 53:42.280\nThe scissor thing.\n\n53:42.280 --> 53:43.280\nYeah.\n\n53:43.280 --> 53:47.280\nI say no more.\n\n53:47.280 --> 53:48.280\nThat's number one.\n\n53:48.280 --> 53:49.280\nI've seen the movie.\n\n53:49.280 --> 53:51.280\nNo, that's not real.\n\n53:51.280 --> 53:53.280\nThat's not real.\n\n53:53.280 --> 53:55.280\nThat's not a real thing.\n\n53:55.280 --> 53:59.280\nLooked real to me.\n\n53:59.280 --> 54:04.280\nRiley Reed, ain't no, she didn't...\n\n54:04.280 --> 54:06.280\nNo, those women are not having good time.\n\n54:06.280 --> 54:09.280\nThat's not how that works.\n\n54:09.280 --> 54:12.280\nI'll tell you about it later, but...\n\n54:12.280 --> 54:14.280\nOh, I think...\n\n54:14.280 --> 54:15.280\nI mean, I don't know.\n\n54:15.280 --> 54:17.280\nDo you have partner jealousy towards me?\n\n54:17.280 --> 54:18.280\nI don't really...\n\n54:18.280 --> 54:20.280\nI find that a cool part of it is like...\n\n54:20.280 --> 54:23.280\nWell, number one, we are both...\n\n54:23.280 --> 54:26.280\nWe are both moderately recognizable.\n\n54:26.280 --> 54:28.280\nI don't mean we're super famous,\n\n54:28.280 --> 54:30.280\nbut I mean, most of the time when we meet people,\n\n54:30.280 --> 54:31.280\nit's like after a show.\n\n54:31.280 --> 54:33.280\nAnd so that's a situation where there's already\n\n54:33.280 --> 54:35.280\na weird power dynamic and so it's not like a...\n\n54:35.280 --> 54:39.280\nIt's not actually super fun to go and talk.\n\n54:39.280 --> 54:41.280\nNothing's gonna happen.\n\n54:41.280 --> 54:42.280\nIt's gonna be really weird.\n\n54:42.280 --> 54:43.280\nI don't...\n\n54:43.280 --> 54:45.280\nThat feels gross and not fun to...\n\n54:45.280 --> 54:46.280\nBecause that person doesn't know you.\n\n54:46.280 --> 54:48.280\nThey're a stranger, but they do know you\n\n54:48.280 --> 54:49.280\nbecause they know you from podcasts.\n\n54:49.280 --> 54:50.280\nAnyway, it's weird.\n\n54:50.280 --> 54:52.280\nYou don't know them at all and they might eat you,\n\n54:52.280 --> 54:53.280\nso it's the whole thing.\n\n54:53.280 --> 54:55.280\nThey're not in the good way.\n\n54:55.280 --> 54:57.280\nMy point is there's that,\n\n54:57.280 --> 55:00.280\nand then I think the other thing is like...\n\n55:00.280 --> 55:01.280\nWe share...\n\n55:01.280 --> 55:04.280\nYou know, we're both into the same thing.\n\n55:04.280 --> 55:05.280\nWhich is when people...\n\n55:05.280 --> 55:07.280\nOh, yeah.\n\n55:07.280 --> 55:08.280\nThat's a cool thing.\n\n55:08.280 --> 55:11.280\nIs that we can both be like, hey...\n\n55:11.280 --> 55:12.280\nNice.\n\n55:12.280 --> 55:13.280\nShe's cute.\n\n55:13.280 --> 55:14.280\nYeah, exactly.\n\n55:14.280 --> 55:15.280\nHey, nice.\n\n55:15.280 --> 55:17.280\nAnd

not great,\n\n55:21.280 --> 55:22.280\nbut that's a good part.\n\n55:22.280 --> 55:23.280\nYeah.\n\n55:23.280 --> 55:24.280\nThat makes sense.\n\n55:24.280 --> 55:26.280\nIt's being like, oh, I'm not jealous of you.\n\n55:26.280 --> 55:28.280\nAbout that interaction, like, hey,\n\n55:28.280 --> 55:29.280\nI get it.\n\n55:29.280 --> 55:30.280\nKeep going.\n\n55:30.280 --> 55:31.280\nShe's cute.\n\n55:31.280 --> 55:33.280\nAllow me to watch you talk to her.\n\n55:33.280 --> 55:35.280\nYou'd be able to file it in the same place.\n\n55:35.280 --> 55:37.280\nI don't know how to file it if a guy...\n\n55:37.280 --> 55:40.280\nThere's like a combination of like...\n\n55:40.280 --> 55:41.280\nI don't know.\n\n55:41.280 --> 55:44.280\nIt's like, if he's everything that I'm not...\n\n55:44.280 --> 55:47.280\nI don't know where to file it if I see my girlfriend\n\n55:47.280 --> 55:49.280\nhaving a good time talking to him.\n\n55:49.280 --> 55:51.280\nCan I pose this to you, Dan?\n\n55:51.280 --> 55:52.280\nCan I just pose this?\n\n55:52.280 --> 55:54.280\nIf he's everything that you're not,\n\n55:54.280 --> 55:56.280\nthen she wants nothing to do with him.\n\n55:56.280 --> 55:58.280\nBecause she likes you.\n\n55:58.280 --> 56:01.280\nOh.\n\n56:04.280 --> 56:08.280\nThat was such a, like, daytime talk show.\n\n56:08.280 --> 56:10.280\nNot sentenced from Rhea,\n\n56:10.280 --> 56:13.280\nbut your guy's reaction.\n\n56:13.280 --> 56:15.280\nThe...\n\n56:15.280 --> 56:17.280\nThe time that it took.\n\n56:17.280 --> 56:19.280\nLike, I don't know if

people...\n\n57:34.280 --> 57:37.280\nI'm not saying 9-11 should be more memorable to anybody,\n\n57:37.280 --> 57:39.280\nbut, you know, he really...\n\n57:39.280 --> 57:42.280\nIt was his favorite national tragedy.\n\n57:42.280 --> 57:45.280\nLike, he really loved that thing.\n\n57:45.280 --> 57:47.280\nHe loved it more than it was like...\n\n57:47.280 --> 57:50.280\nJesus wakes up on December

about?\n\n57:55.280 --> 57:57.280\nDoes anyone know what this is?\n\n57:57.280 --> 58:00.280\nI think Rudy Giuliani's theme song\n\n58:00.280 --> 58:02.280\nfor his relationship between him and 9-11\n\n58:02.280 --> 58:04.280\nis Lady in Red.\n\n58:04.280 --> 58:06.280\nIt's like a ballad.\n\n58:06.280 --> 58:07.280\nIt's like a beautiful, like...\n\n58:07.280 --> 58:09.280\nYou're over a

01:02:05.280\nTwo more?\n\n01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:06.280\nTwo more?\n\n01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.280\nPeople call you?\n\n01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:13.280\nSomeone spelled my name like T-I-M-E-O-U-R.\n\n01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.280\nLike what?\n\n01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:15.280\nTimur.\n\n01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.280\nTimur.\n\n01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.280\nYeah.\n\n01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.280\nYeah.\n\n01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.280\nCome on.\n\n01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.280\nPronounce it.\n\n01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.280\nSo more.\n\n01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.280\nT-I-M-U-R.\n\n01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:26.280\nBut if we just, if we're just in a rush, we can just go Timur and it's fine, right?\n\n01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.280\nTimur.\n\n01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:29.280\nIf it's fine by you, I guess.\n\n01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.280\nSo no.\n\n01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.280\nNot a yes, yeah.\n\n01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.280\nI think it's, is it, is it like it's Jamal but it's Timur?\n\n01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.280\nIs it like that?\n\n01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.280\nWhat?\n\n01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:40.160\nIs it like the emphasis has to be on the second syllable for it to be right?\n\n01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.160\nYou know what?\n\n01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:44.280\nI think technically it is Timur, but since he was little...\n\n01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.280\nWell, everyone calls me Timur, so, Timur.\n\n01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.280\nSo we've just gone with that.\n\n01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:49.280\nAll right.\n\n01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.280\nLike Jamal.\n\n01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:51.280\nI was right.\n\n01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:52.280\nYou're welcome.\n\n01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:53.280\nAll right.\n\n01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.520\nWe'll get through this one step at a time.\n\n01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:56.520\nNo, we're doing it.\n\n01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:59.280\nI'm taking ass.\n\n01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:00.280\nI'm so good.\n\n01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:06.280\nOne of our early conversations that we had as neighbors, I think was like, oh, my, one\n\n01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:10.280\nof my sons, he has a haunted house every how, you know, and he's making it in the backyard.\n\n01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:11.280\nIs that going to be a problem?\n\n01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.280\nThere's going to be people late.\n\n01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:17.280\nI don't, I've never, ever, once, ever, I don't think, complained to a neighbor about\n\n01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.280\nanything.\n\n01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:23.280\nI either, I'm either forcing myself to stay awake and play Minecraft and tuning everything\n\n01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:30.360\nout, or I'm just unconscious because I fell asleep against my will for the three hours\n\n01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:35.640\nbetween Adderall's that it takes for me to recharge my brain and get out there and just\n\n01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:36.920\ndamage myself more.\n\n01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:40.400\nSo you're fine.\n\n01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:45.680\nBut I could hear, so I hear your haunted house going on at haunted house time.\n\n01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:49.280\nAnd there's a thing playing on a loop that I've become familiar with.\n\n01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.280\nThere's like a looped thing.\n\n01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:52.280\nAnd I kind of get into it.\n\n01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:58.560\nI'm like, but you've been doing this for years and you're steadily, you're, you're becoming\n\n01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.000\none of these Halloween people.\n\n01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.480\nYou're becoming a haunted house person.\n\n01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.640\nI don't want to categorize you.\n\n01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.720\nYou thought you were special.\n\n01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:09.840\nI'm saying, you know, it is, it's weird what you're, that's why you're here.\n\n01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:10.840\nYou were going to talk.\n\n01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:11.840\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:17.280\nSo you're, you're, you've been getting more and more into your haunted house every passing\n\n01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.280\nyear.\n\n01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:19.280\nWhen did you start what year?\n\n01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:23.520\nI started four, five years ago.\n\n01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:28.760\nAnd so, and that, at that time, like how, how much before Halloween did you start making\n\n01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:29.760\nyour haunted house?\n\n01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.480\nI started about the first, first time I started was like a week before.\n\n01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:35.480\nAll right.\n\n01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.280\nSo, and then the next year, well, I would disagree with that.\n\n01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:41.000\nOh, controversy.\n\n01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000\nMom's always wins.\n\n01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000\nSo go ahead.\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000\nYeah.\n\n01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000\nNot on Harmontown.\n\n01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000\nGive up.\n\n01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.240\nYou know, this is going to be the worst possible thing I'm going to say, but Rhea has a super\n\n01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:52.240\nearly call time.\n\n01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:55.880\nAnd I feel like I'm going to be useless in this haunted house conversation.\n\n01:04:55.880 --> 01:05:02.040\nI'm going to go to my house so that my wife can go to bed at some point and I'm going\n\n01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:08.280\nto leave you guys, but Dan, you have to take notes and tell me about it because I am neighbor\n\n01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:11.200\njust trying to avoid the argument, aren't you?\n\n01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:12.200\nThe haunted house.\n\n01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:13.200\nWhat argument?\n\n01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.760\nI was not expecting an argument to happen.\n\n01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:18.160\nI thought you were going to lay out all your plans and that we're going to hear about it\n\n01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.600\nand that you were going to tell me your address so that I could come to your haunted house.\n\n01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:25.040\nBut we'll figure that out later because I also live in the neighborhood, so I'll see\n\n01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:26.040\nyou guys there.\n\n01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.040\nAll right.\n\n01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.040\nWatch Take My Wife on CISO.\n\n01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:29.040\nKaren Esposito.\n\n01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.040\nThank you so much.\n\n01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:32.040\nThank you so much.\n\n01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:36.720\nI'm not a bad host.\n\n01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:41.800\nI gave them, I said they had an out before and the, yeah, that's not my fault.\n\n01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:43.400\nYou were so good at hosting.\n\n01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:44.400\nI'm so good at everything.\n\n01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:45.400\nYeah.\n\n01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.400\nNo, it's great.\n\n01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:47.960\nI'm good at sleeping next to a haunted house.\n\n01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:48.960\nYeah.\n\n01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:49.960\nAll right.\n\n01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:53.280\nSo you, so the first year, a week before a haunted house, you threw up a haunted house.\n\n01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.680\nYou obviously had a good time.\n\n01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:56.240\nNext year, you want to make another haunted house.\n\n01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.320\nYou started probably a little earlier, right?\n\n01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:59.320\nYeah.\n\n01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.320\nHow much earlier?\n\n01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.320\nA month and a half.\n\n01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.320\nOkay.\n\n01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:09.440\nSo now it's 2016, it's August, and you got your haunted house, it's like in construction\n\n01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:10.440\nright now, right?\n\n01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:11.440\nYeah.\n\n01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:15.640\nSo there's a tag here that is like, these are your haunted house plans, right?\n\n01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:25.840\nWell, one of the things that I would say is that Timur started his official haunted maze,\n\n01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:29.200\nand it wasn't even a maze at that point because he was 11 years old.\n\n01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:32.440\nBut when I had my brain tumor.\n\n01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:33.720\nYour brain Timur.\n\n01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:36.280\nMy brain Timur.\n\n01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:37.680\nIs that what you did?\n\n01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:38.680\nYeah.\n\n01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:39.680\nNo.\n\n01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:40.680\nOh, wait.\n\n01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:41.680\nYeah.\n\n01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:47.520\nDan was going to work, and I was sleeping all day, and we were very worried about Timur\n\n01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.720\nand what he was going to do all day.\n\n01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:55.800\nAnd this was in the summertime, and you started building your first haunted maze.\n\n01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.720\nAnd it was, it went straight.\n\n01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:03.520\nIt was, there wasn't much to it, but it was probably because he was only 11 years old.\n\n01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:07.040\nIt probably went from here to that wall.\n\n01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:13.960\nAnd I remember that it went right up our sidewalk, and everybody that was coming to visit me\n\n01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:16.840\nhad to go through that little tunnel.\n\n01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:21.880\nSo whether it was a pizza delivery man or people delivering food or relatives, they\n\n01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.880\nall had to go through that.\n\n01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:25.680\nAnd that was the first year.\n\n01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:31.600\nAnd when you start it, when you do a haunted maze, I've been calling in a house, but it's\n\n01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:37.600\nlike, do you, do you go to the front door of your house?\n\n01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.160\nIs that where the customer goes?\n\n01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:42.080\nDo they go to the front door of your house and enter your home, or do they go around\n\n01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:44.520\nthe house?\n\n01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:50.440\nSo my house is like a regular house right here, and then there's a yard around it and\n\n01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:52.440\nleading up to it or some stairs.\n\n01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.840\nSo then down there, people wait to get up.\n\n01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:01.040\nWell the first year, the first year, it went right up to our door.\n\n01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:06.240\nBut then after that, the next year, he said, I'm going to build it around the house.\n\n01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:13.480\nAnd we were saying, tomorrow, that's crazy, because we live in a house that's on a hill.\n\n01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:17.560\nAnd to go around it, there's so, I mean, just to get up to our house, there's a lot of steps.\n\n01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.680\nOur garage is at ground level.\n\n01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.160\nAnd then you have to go up a lot of steps.\n\n01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:24.840\nWell see, now you're scaring me already.\n\n01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:27.080\nJust know you'll burn calories if you go.\n\n01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.080\nYes.\n\n01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:31.920\nAnd then to go around the house, which is where he wanted to build the whole haunted\n\n01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:36.680\nmaze, is there are steps all over, because it's on a hill.\n\n01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:38.080\nSo it's actually quite dangerous.\n\n01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.480\nSo you never go through the boots in the home.\n\n01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:41.480\nNo.\n\n01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:45.080\nYou're not opening your home to strangers, because you'd have to have people just like\n\n01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.520\nwith knives to protect you against.\n\n01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:54.560\nThat's funny you say, because last year, with all the chaotic, I'm walking through my house,\n\n01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:59.080\nand all of a sudden there's a little old grandma standing there like, where's the restroom?\n\n01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.080\nLike right there.\n\n01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.080\nDo I know you?\n\n01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:04.640\nAnd then I'm waiting there for her to finish, and then I'm like waiting there for like ten\n\n01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:08.440\nminutes, because there's a random old grandma in my house, and I'm like, the exit's this\n\n01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:09.440\nway.\n\n01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:10.440\nSo here, I'll escort you out.\n\n01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:11.440\nAnd then this way.\n\n01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:12.440\nIn my house.\n\n01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:13.440\nAnd she went, no, sonny.\n\n01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:14.440\nI'll escort you to hell!\n\n01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:15.440\nAnd you're like, no!\n\n01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:16.440\nMy hubris!\n\n01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:17.440\nI had fun imitating horror, and now I'm in it!\n\n01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:18.440\nAnd then she went, no, sonny!\n\n01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:19.440\nI'll escort you to hell!\n\n01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:20.440\nAnd you're like, no!\n\n01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:21.440\nMy hubris!\n\n01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:26.440\nI had fun imitating horror, and now I'm in it!\n\n01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:31.560\nI mocked death, and I am now its plaything!\n\n01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:33.280\nI should have known!\n\n01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:35.560\nThis is my creep show!\n\n01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:37.440\nYou know what a creep show is?\n\n01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:38.440\nIt's a vignette.\n\n01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:39.440\nIt's a horror vignette.\n\n01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:40.440\nAll right.\n\n01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:41.440\nSo, all right.\n\n01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:45.680\nWell, so I just want to show, I don't even know, because you started bringing this out,\n\n01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:49.840\nand I was like, save it for the stage, because I just want the, I mean, this to me is...\n\n01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:53.280\nAnd mind you, Dan, this is stuff that he did when he was 11 and 12 years old.\n\n01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:57.560\nThis is his horror house, his haunted house file.\n\n01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:58.560\nSo you're, okay.\n\n01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.480\nThis is when he was 11 and 12 years old.\n\n01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.480\nSo...\n\n01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:04.720\nWell, maybe 12 or 13.\n\n01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:06.600\nThat one's from 2014.\n\n01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:09.560\nSo I see, what's in here is like, there's waivers.\n\n01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:11.360\nSo those are workers that apply?\n\n01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.360\nRight.\n\n01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.360\nInterests.\n\n01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.360\nInterns, I would call them.\n\n01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:15.360\nWell, they're his friends.\n\n01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.360\nYeah.\n\n01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:17.360\nThey're his friends.\n\n01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:18.360\nAnd I think we all know the difference.\n\n01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:24.400\nChichong, that's a cash register not opening.\n\n01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:25.400\nYes.\n\n01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:26.400\nLet's face it.\n\n01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.400\nAll right.\n\n01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:28.400\nLet's talk about that.\n\n01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:29.400\nOkay.\n\n01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:30.400\nLet's talk about that.\n\n01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:31.400\nAre people pay...\n\n01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.400\nWhat are they giving you?\n\n01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:33.400\nA buck at the door?\n\n01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:34.400\nWhat are they...\n\n01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:35.400\nWhat's the...\n\n01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:36.400\nWhere's the wheels getting greased here?\n\n01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:37.560\nWe actually go by donations at the end.\n\n01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:43.120\nSo if they liked it or got scared, we have a donation booth at the bottom of the stairs\n\n01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:46.760\nthat says donations, and that's actually a booth.\n\n01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:52.000\nSo like on some nights we'll have a person waiting in the booth, like last year we had\n\n01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.960\na clown theme.\n\n01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:59.120\nSo we'd have like a clown in there, a person that looked fake, and then after someone put\n\n01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:01.280\na donation in, they'd move.\n\n01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.280\nSo...\n\n01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:03.280\nAll right.\n\n01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:04.280\nWell, that's...\n\n01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.280\nYeah.\n\n01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:06.280\nSo, okay.\n\n01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:07.280\nSo it's all on donations.\n\n01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.280\nSo then you take that and you what?\n\n01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:09.280\nDo you put it all into the haunted house?\n\n01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:10.280\nYeah.\n\n01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.440\nIt actually goes back to all the money we spent on the house.\n\n01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.240\nI see a map here.\n\n01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:15.240\nYeah.\n\n01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:17.600\nThere's a bunch of quadrants and it says plastic everywhere.\n\n01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:18.600\nWell, the...\n\n01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:23.000\nAnd there's a drawing of dismembered arms.\n\n01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:28.280\nThe thing I wanted to point out were these were all things that he had...\n\n01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:29.280\nJust ideas.\n\n01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:30.280\nAre these boobs?\n\n01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:31.400\nAre these boobs or pencils?\n\n01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:34.600\nBut these are things that he did when he was 11 and 12 years old.\n\n01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:35.600\nRight.\n\n01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.920\nThose are teeth, but in your perspective I could see how those look like boobs.\n\n01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:39.920\nYeah.\n\n01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.920\nWell, it's called misogyny.\n\n01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:45.360\nYes, it's misogyny.\n\n01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:47.920\nShe uses that to consume me.\n\n01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:49.920\nWhoa.\n\n01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:52.920\nIt's myth.\n\n01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:53.920\nIt's myth.\n\n01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:54.920\nDeep man.\n\n01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:55.920\nAll right.\n\n01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:56.920\nI just want...\n\n01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:57.920\nI don't know.\n\n01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:58.920\nIt's a stack of things.\n\n01:11:58.920 --> 01:11:59.920\nSo, Timora is 16 years old now.\n\n01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:02.240\nThat was one of the things I wanted to point out.\n\n01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.920\nAnd he started this when he was 11.\n\n01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:04.920\nRight.\n\n01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:05.920\nSo, and I...\n\n01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:08.320\nThis is the thing that I like about it.\n\n01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:09.320\nBecause you need my approval.\n\n01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:13.720\nBut I like that you said, you said, oh, my son's going to do a haunted house, you know?\n\n01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:15.840\nAnd I'm like, okay.\n\n01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:16.840\nAnd I like it.\n\n01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:17.840\nI mean, it's neat.\n\n01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:21.880\nIt's cool that you're like, you're into it and you keep putting more and more energy\n\n01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:22.880\ninto it.\n\n01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:23.880\nAnd you might get...\n\n01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:27.440\nNext year might be the year that you're like, oh, haunted houses are dumb.\n\n01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:28.440\nOr...\n\n01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:32.560\nBut more than likely, some kind of weird morph is going to happen where you're like, oh,\n\n01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:35.120\nyou know what I really like about haunted houses?\n\n01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.120\nYou know what I'm doing?\n\n01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:41.000\nYou know, there may be some weird offshoot of that, or you may be one of the lucky people\n\n01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000\nthat's like...\n\n01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000\nAnd I found out...\n\n01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000\nI love...\n\n01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:51.480\nIt'll be 2048 and you'll be like, I'm the master of haunted houses, or just this one.\n\n01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:53.920\nI want to ask you, like, what do you think...\n\n01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:55.680\nAnd there's no wrong answer to it.\n\n01:12:55.680 --> 01:13:01.080\nIt's like the most dumb, like, childish caveman answer that you want to give.\n\n01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:02.080\nLike, what...\n\n01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:03.080\nWhat do you...\n\n01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:04.080\nWhat's the pleasure?\n\n01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:06.040\nWhat draws you back to it?\n\n01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:09.720\nHow do you really get out of the whole experience of making a haunted house and having people\n\n01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:10.720\ncome through it?\n\n01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:14.880\nWell, it's a community thing that happens.\n\n01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:20.320\nSo all the neighbors come, and then from actually 6 to 7 p.m. is the less scary version\n\n01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:23.280\nfor little kids like her age to go through.\n\n01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:24.280\nOh, there's...\n\n01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:26.600\nSee, I think you guys invited me to that one, right?\n\n01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:27.600\nBecause you know...\n\n01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.600\nMost likely.\n\n01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:36.960\nBut, you know, all the neighbors do get involved, and there is a lot of generations.\n\n01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:45.080\nSo we have little kids like you that are working the haunted maze, and Timor's got his friends.\n\n01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:49.400\nProbably, like, 4-year-old girls are the easiest, like, haunted house worker in the world.\n\n01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:54.880\nThey could just put an Easter dress on them and have them just stand and stare, as long\n\n01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:57.400\nas they could just hold still for, like, an hour.\n\n01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:01.240\nThat's probably the most terrifying thing.\n\n01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:09.080\nThey beckon with a lace glove, holding something random, not like a bloody knife, because it's\n\n01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:10.080\nover the top.\n\n01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:19.080\nThey're just holding, like, an apple or, like, a gerbil or a football with, like, a pentagram\n\n01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:20.080\non it.\n\n01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:22.440\nI don't know.\n\n01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:27.640\nThey're not far from the...or, like, a piece of...no, okay, scariest thing in the world.\n\n01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:33.880\n4-year-old girl in a nightgown holding an O-ring from a space shuttle.\n\n01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:38.000\nOh, shit.\n\n01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.160\nThink about it.\n\n01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:47.720\nAnd just with a look of confusion on her face.\n\n01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:51.000\nThe face I have right now, because I have no idea what you're talking about.\n\n01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:56.600\nIt's just, yeah, it's like a...or just a...let me re-pitch that.\n\n01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:01.000\nThat's what I would project onto it, if it was a girl holding a piece of...it was clearly\n\n01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.160\nlike a piece of, like, a crucial aeronautic equipment.\n\n01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:07.160\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.160\nIt's like some dark, dark shit.\n\n01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:11.680\nThe idea is that a bunch of people are going to die because of this child.\n\n01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:12.680\nJust something specific.\n\n01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:15.840\nIt's like, that girl's not supposed to be holding that, and they're like, what is that?\n\n01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:20.680\nIt's like a big nut, you know, like an industrial-sized washer.\n\n01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:21.680\nThat's like rusty or something.\n\n01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:26.520\nAnd she's just holding it up and going like...and you're like, where did you get that?\n\n01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:32.680\nAnd then you just hear, and there's huge crash.\n\n01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:33.680\nThat's terror.\n\n01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:37.080\nLike, you should...you can use that.\n\n01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:40.680\nI'll take that into consideration.\n\n01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:45.520\nBut aside from it being...because if you just wanted to do community stuff, then that's\n\n01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:46.520\ngreat.\n\n01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:50.840\nBut you're very...you know, that's a good answer, and I'm not saying it's an insincere\n\n01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:51.840\none.\n\n01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:58.280\nIt's part...you like contributing, like the feeling of the neighborhood is like, there's\n\n01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:02.560\na tradition, and they're coming over, and you're like, you're doing this thing that\n\n01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:03.560\npeople know.\n\n01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:04.560\nOh, there's Timmer.\n\n01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:07.440\nHe's the guy that does that haunted house thing every year, and it's like consistency\n\n01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:08.440\nand tradition.\n\n01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:14.240\nAnd you have this role, like, I'm the shoemaker, I'm the barber, I'm the guy that saves your\n\n01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:15.240\nlife.\n\n01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:23.600\nYou know, like whatever, you have this role, and...but now just a subset of that, the terror\n\n01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:27.440\nthing, the horror thing, the idea, because you could do that with Christmas, you could\n\n01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:31.320\ndo that with, you know, you could do that with Easter, you could do that with No Holiday\n\n01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:34.800\nat All, you could do that with like a bicycle race around here, you could organize like\n\n01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:39.720\na marathon where everyone walked on their hands and the proceeds went to the next year's\n\n01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:40.720\nmarathon.\n\n01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:48.920\nBut you, people being scared, does that, like, do you like that?\n\n01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:53.440\nThat's the first question I've ever got asked by someone.\n\n01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:56.080\nYour guides counselor should have been the first.\n\n01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:01.600\nHe should have said, do you like scaring people, Timmer?\n\n01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:02.600\nNo comment.\n\n01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:06.880\nWell, do you like a good night's sleep?\n\n01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:08.880\nWho doesn't?\n\n01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:12.160\nYeah, no, who doesn't is right.\n\n01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:16.760\nLet me tell you something about Casper Mattressers.\n\n01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:22.200\nCasper is an obsessively engineered mattress at a shockingly low price.\n\n01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:28.440\nNow as a cool kid, does that appeal to you in any way?\n\n01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:29.440\nNot really.\n\n01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:31.960\nNo, you're right.\n\n01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:36.000\nIt's not appealing to kids, this is engineer stuff, but what about the fact that it combines\n\n01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:41.040\nspring latex and supportive memory foam to create an award-winning sleep surface with\n\n01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:43.280\njust the right sink and just the right bounce?\n\n01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:45.400\nIt has a 100-day guarantee.\n\n01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:47.480\nYeah, a 100-day guarantee.\n\n01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:50.520\nYou can try it out for 100 nights if you don't like it.\n\n01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:51.520\nBring it back for free.\n\n01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:52.520\nWe don't care.\n\n01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:55.800\nWait a minute, are you telling me, and I know this is what people say in a commercial,\n\n01:17:55.800 --> 01:18:04.320\nbut I really am, are you telling me, Crazy King Spencer, that there's a mattress company\n\n01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:11.760\nthat lets you try a mattress for 100 days and at the end of 100 days, which is a mattress's\n\n01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:12.760\nlife?\n\n01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:17.720\nI mean, I'm like, wait, that's like the best years of a mattress or the first 100 days.\n\n01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:22.240\nWell, I mean, 100 days is like, that's like, if you try a mattress for 100 days and then\n\n01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:29.000\ngo, eh, I didn't like it, you have a right to, but you're lying, because if you laid\n\n01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:34.300\non something for 100 days, you can't tell me you didn't like it, but maybe you're busy.\n\n01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:38.480\nBut I mean, maybe you're just, you know, hoodwinked by the fact that Time Magazine named it the\n\n01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:40.920\nbest invention of 2015.\n\n01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.560\nThe best invention in general?\n\n01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:46.200\nYeah, it's a mattress that won't disappoint.\n\n01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:51.520\nNow in a world where we've landed on the moon, I guess the idea is like a slow invention\n\n01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:52.520\nyear.\n\n01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:55.520\nYeah, well, no, it's exactly the opposite.\n\n01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:02.480\nIt's actually the biggest invention year of 2015, self-driving cars, artificial intelligence.\n\n01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:08.080\nNo, Casper mattress, Dan, they ship anywhere in U.S. and Canada.\n\n01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:12.160\nI got one, it came in the box, the size of a mini fridge.\n\n01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:18.080\nI accidentally cut it open, it was full of gold coins, it's a $2,000 value, just hidden\n\n01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:19.080\naway in a mattress.\n\n01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:21.920\nAll right, wait a minute, is that, is that allowed?\n\n01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:26.720\nI mean, I'm not saying that's normal, but that's just my experience.\n\n01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:36.240\nOh, okay, yeah, I got a Casper mattress and all of our immigration problems were solved.\n\n01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:38.920\nWhoa, now we can't say that's connected.\n\n01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:45.160\nNo, no, but it did happen, it did happen, sorry Timmery, we can't have a donation box\n\n01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:47.040\nat the end of it.\n\n01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:48.760\nHere's the upshot, Timmer.\n\n01:19:48.760 -->

partial to gnolls.\n\n01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:35.840\nOnce again, no comment.\n\n01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:43.160\nOkay, I mean, it's weird to plead the fifth in an interview, but I don't know which footage\n\n01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:45.240\nyou watched before you came here.\n\n01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:47.920\nThese PR lawyers these days, they're getting in early.\n\n01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:50.640\nBut okay, here's a question for you.\n\n01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:58.040\nRight, so you're like the pit boss at these things, like at a casino, like you're running\n\n01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:04.480\nthe whole thing, like it's a Timmer production, like you're top dog, right?\n\n01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:06.520\nNo, no, my parents are.\n\n01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:07.520\nSo millennial.\n\n01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:08.520\nAll right.\n\n01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:13.080\nWell, let me tell you a story about that.\n\n01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:17.960\nI gave birth to him, so animal, and couldn't get away with killing him, so I dominate\n\n01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:18.960\nhis life.\n\n01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:26.400\nSo this is his thing, and of course we have the ultimate say, but it's like when he invited\n\n01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:33.600\nall of his school friends to help out, and he was probably like what, 13 or 14, and his\n\n01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:37.040\nfriends, it was supposed to be something that they were, it's going to be something\n\n01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:41.800\ncool and fun that they do together, but then at a certain point, because Timmer takes his\n\n01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:48.840\nhaunted maze so seriously, they started accusing him of being really bossy.\n\n01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:51.000\nAnd you know.\n\n01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.440\nHeavy lies the crown, my friend.\n\n01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:57.680\nThis is why he's no commenting, his enemies are looking for a weakness.\n\n01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:06.920\nAt one point, they started to revolt, and they said they weren't going to put up with\n\n01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:13.120\nit anymore, and they started to have a skateboard party down in the cul-de-sac.\n\n01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:14.120\nSeason four.\n\n01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:20.600\nAnd he came up to me, extremely frustrated, because he wanted his friends to be there\n\n01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:25.360\nhelping him, and they weren't going to have any more of it.\n\n01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:27.560\nSo at that point.\n\n01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:30.320\nDid they do a Muppet episode?\n\n01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.320\nYeah.\n\n01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:36.320\nYou don't know how much I share this.\n\n01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:37.320\nYes.\n\n01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.320\nYeah.\n\n01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.320\nI'll bet.\n\n01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:46.920\nSo at that point, I went down there and, you know, called them up, and they were looking\n\n01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:49.840\nat me like, you know, what are you going to do about it?\n\n01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:50.840\nHoly shit.\n\n01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:55.760\nThis is crazy, because it's like, that's a haunted house, and then it's like, this is\n\n01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:56.760\nreally scary.\n\n01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:57.760\nYes.\n\n01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:58.760\nYes.\n\n01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:00.400\nIt's scary how not scary they're being.\n\n01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:03.400\nYeah, they're like, this is like purge anarchy.\n\n01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:04.400\nYes.\n\n01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:06.400\nYou got like skulls on their heads, and they're like skateboarding.\n\n01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:09.840\nAnarchy, they're not doing things to alarm people.\n\n01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:14.520\nAnd then Timor said that he wanted to fire them, and they said, you can't fire us, we're\n\n01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:16.280\nworking for free.\n\n01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:17.640\nWhoa.\n\n01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:21.080\nAnd so he said that he would pay them so he could fire them.\n\n01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:22.080\nNice.\n\n01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:28.720\nI can't, this is just, like humanity thinks we have so many levels of sophistication,\n\n01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:33.400\nand that is just, that's global politics played out, just like, that's it.\n\n01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:34.400\nExactly.\n\n01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:38.640\nOh, okay, you're a territory.\n\n01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:43.240\nSo at that point, I mean, I kind of asked the guys, I said, let me ask you something.\n\n01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:48.680\nI said, do you guys want to be a part of something that's really cool, or something that's just\n\n01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:50.320\nreally, really lame?\n\n01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:54.200\nI said, because you're going to go back to your friends, and they're going to ask you,\n\n01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:57.880\nthey're going to say, man, that haunted maze was really lame.\n\n01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:01.480\nOr they're going to say, that was really cool.\n\n01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:04.400\nI didn't understand at first, I thought you were going a different direction, but that's\n\n01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:06.000\na lot more encouraging.\n\n01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000\nYeah.\n\n01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000\nIt's positive.\n\n01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.200\nYou know, and so at that point, they said, we want to be a part of something that's really\n\n01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:13.400\ncool.\n\n01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:16.600\nAnd I said, you know, well, Timor's getting really frustrated, because he's trying to\n\n01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:20.160\nmake this really cool, and he's not getting any help from you.\n\n01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:26.000\nSo then at that point, they all kind of rallied around, and they, you know, started helping\n\n01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:32.120\nTimor, but so that's, you know, a typical teenage thing.\n\n01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:39.480\nBut it sounds like mainly you went through it, like, you mean, well, he was, he was practically\n\n01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:40.480\nin tears.\n\n01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:41.480\nWhy?\n\n01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:42.480\nSo.\n\n01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:46.800\nI doubt that, I'm sure it was fine.\n\n01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:47.800\nHe's probably used to that.\n\n01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:52.600\nHe's watching this all with a cocktail, watching a little window, like Bruce Wayne, yes, let\n\n01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:53.600\nher have it, mother.\n\n01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:57.520\nWell, these are all, these are all his best friends.\n\n01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:03.600\nWell, there's Morgan Freeman comes in and goes, sir, we found a new way to scare people.\n\n01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.520\nLet's take a look, Lucius.\n\n01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:06.520\nWhere's your mother?\n\n01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:08.920\nShe's out talking to the riffraff.\n\n01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:12.440\nWell, here's what I was going to ask you.\n\n01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:19.040\nSo you're the boss, and I get it now, like saying yes to that is like, yeah, of course,\n\n01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:23.560\nyou got to, you got to, you got to say, well, you know, creator is a myth, really.\n\n01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:30.080\nIt's a collaboration, I get it.\n\n01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:36.200\nBut the, God damn it, I'm always distracting myself.\n\n01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:40.360\nWhen the show is actually going, when the thing is running full swing, what do you prefer\n\n01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:41.360\nto do?\n\n01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:45.560\nDo you walk around like Robert De Niro in Casino, like observing, or do you actually immerse\n\n01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:47.640\nyourself in like one jack-o'-lantern?\n\n01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:54.160\nWell, well, I'll stand in the front in the beginning, and then I'll wait there until\n\n01:25:54.160 --> 01:26:00.560\nmy ADHD kicks in, and then I'll go back and start scaring people.\n\n01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:08.840\nThat's what Dan does, except I give myself ADHD with a drug called Adderall because I\n\n01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:15.280\ndon't have ADHD, except don't tell my doctor that.\n\n01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:19.440\nBut yeah, so you say, wait, so you go scare people, but what do you do, or do you just\n\n01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:24.360\ngrab a dull machete and just wander, or is there like a spot you like?\n\n01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:30.160\nI just go to whatever spots open, so depending on the night, how many actors, if we're short\n\n01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:35.480\non actors, I'll just stay and like help scare, but for good on actors, I usually stay down\n\n01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.320\nuntil I get bored.\n\n01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:38.320\nStay down like in front.\n\n01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:42.080\nI like help out, like, oh, you go ahead, wait here, or go.\n\n01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:46.240\nSo surely there's been like, okay, there's been some mishaps, right?\n\n01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:50.920\nSomebody, has there been complaints, or somebody went through, they're dissatisfied?\n\n01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:58.280\nYeah, there's been a few of those that I actually remember the first, maybe like the third year\n\n01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:04.080\nwe were into it, there were like maybe five or six of us actors, and then I remember there\n\n01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:07.880\nwere these little kids that came up and they came down, and then we didn't establish at\n\n01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:11.760\nthe time where we could stop scaring people, like, so.\n\n01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:15.160\nThey didn't establish what the safety zone is, yes.\n\n01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:21.720\nSo a couple of my actors, a couple of my actors start scaring these little girls, and then\n\n01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:25.400\nthey start running down the street, and we're in a cul-de-sac, so it's like we're out, and\n\n01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:30.600\nI assume like right after you exit, that's it, but then they start chasing them all the\n\n01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:35.560\nway down the street and I'm like, and come on, these are little girls, six and seven,\n\n01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:36.560\ncome on.\n\n01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:41.160\nWell, you know, I was going to say the other thing about running to Haun and Mays is, you\n\n01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:46.200\nknow, when he was younger, like eleven or twelve years old, you know, it was actually\n\n01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:52.080\nquite cute, and people would say, oh, you know, this is really good, but then at a certain\n\n01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:59.120\npoint when he got older, it started getting really scary, and we actually had one parent\n\n01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:05.800\nwho was throwing a party and brought his whole party of kids to the Haun and Mays, and because\n\n01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:11.440\nthat was a year where it was kind of the turning point, and things had gotten really scary,\n\n01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:16.560\nand a couple of his actors chased this party all the way down the street, and the kids\n\n01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:21.800\ngot really scared, and the parent came back and said, he goes, you know what?\n\n01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:27.480\nHe says, I have a couple of girls crying here, he says they're going to go back home, terrorized,\n\n01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:34.200\nhe says, and you guys, you need to establish a safety zone, but he was right, he was right.\n\n01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:35.920\nI guess he's right, but I hate him.\n\n01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:36.920\nNo, he's right.\n\n01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:37.920\nWe all hate him right now.\n\n01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:40.240\nHe was right, unless it was one of your kids.\n\n01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:44.280\nIf we were him, if he was humanized, we would be back.\n\n01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:45.680\nIf it was one of his kids.\n\n01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:47.960\nYes, if he had a kid, and it came out.\n\n01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:48.960\nOh, well it was.\n\n01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:56.120\nYeah, and you know what, he was right, and so at that point, we had to establish some\n\n01:28:56.120 --> 01:29:03.440\nrules for the actors, like you don't go down the steps, and, you know, so, I mean, it's\n\n01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:09.520\ninteresting because as Timor's gotten older, you know, and things getting scarier, there's\n\n01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:15.040\na lot of things that a person doesn't have to, you never consider when a kid is younger,\n\n01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:17.880\nand it's kind of cute, you know?\n\n01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:22.560\nIt's a whole area I'd never go into, because when I go to haunted houses, it's usually,\n\n01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:27.680\nit's like, it's a whole game of like, I don't want to, who I'm with, I don't want to miss\n\n01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:32.960\nout on stuff, and then, so everyone's going to do this thing, but I genuinely like, I\n\n01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:40.480\nhave a really low threshold, and I, you know, my therapist says, I startle easily for various\n\n01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:46.680\nreasons, she gave me a license to be easily startled, like, you know, and I get scared\n\n01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:51.480\nlike, if my girlfriend's in the bathroom and she's brushing her teeth, and I go, are you\n\n01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:52.480\nalmost ready?\n\n01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:56.560\nYeah, I'm just brushing my teeth, and then I'll like, go and pick up a sock, and if I\n\n01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:01.520\nturn around, and then she's not in the bathroom, but she's in the living room, and I hear her\n\n01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:08.280\nvoice from the wrong room, I'll go, it's not even seeing anybody, I'll just like, if someone\n\n01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:11.920\npasses the salt, and then it's where it's not supposed to be, yeah, like I have this\n\n01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:19.200\nlike visceral reaction, so what I'm saying is, because of that, knowing that people are\n\n01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:23.120\ncoming through, they have all these different relationships with being scared, some people\n\n01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:27.040\nare like, I have, in my wildest dreams, I've lived this punk rock haunted house where people\n\n01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:32.320\nchased me all the way down the street, because fuck this, like, marching dimes, bullshit,\n\n01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:35.400\nyou know, like, you know, like, this is, but you're an adult.\n\n01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:39.480\nThis is like, mon-pop punk rock, and sometimes you pay to get scared, yeah, and it's like\n\n01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:43.040\nTabasco sauce, it's like, I want to burn my tongue, I know it's not real, I want to feel\n\n01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:47.840\nlike it's on fire, exactly, and then it's like, my little girl got scared, you need\n\n01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:52.600\na highway cone to establish, and then everyone's like, well, you know what's interesting is\n\n01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:59.560\nwe have little kids that are so brave, and we have adults that are crying, so, you know,\n\n01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:00.560\nthere is, there is that.\n\n01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:05.720\nThat's gonna be neat, I just, here's what I do, I just, I'll just like, I yelp at like\n\n01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:09.600\na high-pitched scream, like, when anyone scares me, like, anything that's not supposed to\n\n01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:15.600\nbe where it is, I go, and it'll scare other people, and then I feel, and then they scare\n\n01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:20.360\nme, because they're screaming, like, I stay away from haunted houses, so I'm gonna, but\n\n01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:24.960\nI think it's a smart thing to have, like, the kiddie time, where, like, what do you do\n\n01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:29.080\nwhen you scare a little kid, what are the, what's the difference between scaring a kid\n\n01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:33.600\nand scaring a, when you, you do it, you have little kid, what, what, what, what, give us\n\n01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:36.280\nsome examples of how to choke up on the scaring bat?\n\n01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:42.320\nA year or two back, we tried to do this thing called the pumpkins in the goblin, so if there's\n\n01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:46.200\na little kid going through, we'd call them the pumpkins, so that would mean you don't\n\n01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:50.360\nscare them as much, but if we say goblins, then the actors know to step up their game,\n\n01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:51.360\nbut...\n\n01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:54.040\nSo you're, you're calling that a head, we got two pumpkins coming, yeah, yeah, yeah,\n\n01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:57.920\nit was, it was a nightmare trying to get it all figured out, but we stopped that, and\n\n01:31:57.920 --> 01:31:59.600\nwe figured out the six to seven...\n\n01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:03.200\nYeah, that makes more sense, because pumpkins are gonna come with goblins, you know, and\n\n01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:08.480\nso what are you supposed to do, two pumpkins, three goblins, three, said three goblins,\n\n01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:17.480\nThe one pumpkin is, like, yeah, it has PTSD, you know what I'm saying.\n\n01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:35.280\nBoy, all right, so commitment is a theme, terror, hierarchy, a weird, fun blend of these\n\n01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:40.560\nphrases, helicopter, mothering, and also, but you're turning them loose, like you're\n\n01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:46.960\nletting them explore his inner Ted Bundy, like you're, you're, you're going like, okay,\n\n01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:50.920\nso you love, you love this, this haunted house thing, but then you're like down there doing\n\n01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:52.920\nlabor relations with, for him.\n\n01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:56.680\nNo, the only time I show up is actually on Halloween.\n\n01:32:56.680 --> 01:33:04.120\nDo you got, do you and Dan, your, your husband, do you, do you, do you guys, actually, do\n\n01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:08.640\nyou go check into a hotel while he does the haunted house because the, the sound or?\n\n01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:14.400\nNo, we actually are there because a lot of times I'll take our dog down for all the little\n\n01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:19.640\nkids that get scared and I dress up our dog in a costume and, you know, people show up\n\n01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:26.480\nwith their little kids and then sometimes I'll run the booth and play the scary clown\n\n01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:32.240\nin the booth, but and Dan helps him build it sometimes, but really Timor and his friends\n\n01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:37.880\nare the ones that build all of it and what are the, what are the, what are the, what\n\n01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:44.600\nare the do's and don'ts, okay, creatively, haunted house craftsmanship, what's hack,\n\n01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:51.480\nyou know what hack means, like explain, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, uh, uh,\n\n01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:57.720\ncatch penny, pure isle, 2000 and late, like, like, it's what, it's what the amateurs do.\n\n01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:02.720\nThat's like Bush League, like, like, easy shortcut, like, like, like, even if it does\n\n01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:07.200\nget a reaction, it's like, oh, but that's like, not, that's not like what a good haunted\n\n01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:08.200\nhouse guy does.\n\n01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:13.080\nWell, one of my main things is I make sure, since I don't know how all my actors are acting\n\n01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:15.040\nwise, I make sure they all have a mask on there.\n\n01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:26.360\nI'm not letting them try to explore their acting skills here, no offense to my actors.\n\n01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:31.960\nSo everyone is dehumanized and controllable, an opportunity for body work.\n\n01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:32.960\nYeah.\n\n01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:33.960\nWell, yeah.\n\n01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:34.960\nWell, it keeps them interchangeable.\n\n01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:39.600\nNo one can make an argument that's like, look, I'm Damien, you know, they're coming\n\n01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:43.120\nfor me the way I scare them with my eyebrows.\n\n01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:49.160\nWell, you know, what's funny too is that, um, tomorrow would get really, really frustrated\n\n01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:55.400\nbecause he would, when a cute girl would come through the haunted maze, he would get mad\n\n01:34:55.400 --> 01:35:00.400\nbecause his actors, which are his friends, would not stay in character.\n\n01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:01.400\nYeah.\n\n01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:02.400\nOne of my friends like, you're hot.\n\n01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:03.400\nIt's like, come on, bro.\n\n01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:04.400\nYes.\n\n01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:07.400\nWell, no, that is just another form of terror.\n\n01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:08.400\nYeah.\n\n01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:11.400\nThat's the haunted house she's trying to escape.\n\n01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:12.400\nRight.\n\n01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:15.280\nA haunted house with a glass ceiling.\n\n01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:18.840\nOh, well, I mean, they're 16 there.\n\n01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:22.680\nI mean, yeah, I mean, I learned to visit 42.\n\n01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:26.600\nAnd it was only to try to not get booed on my podcast.\n\n01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:28.400\nI wasn't because I was a evolved person.\n\n01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:32.680\nI just figured out that women have a hard time.\n\n01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:36.840\nUm, uh, the, uh, so, all right, so, so that's, well, that's interesting.\n\n01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:41.760\nSo that's a, that's a note like, don't, don't, don't, you know, it's a selfless job scaring\n\n01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:43.120\npeople at a haunted house.\n\n01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:47.840\nYou don't get to like, same would go for, uh, uh, someone writing a parking ticket or\n\n01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:49.720\na judge or anything else.\n\n01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:53.560\nYou're an impersonal cosmic force, if you're not a hack, you're going to, you're going\n\n01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:58.400\nto stick to your role and rev your prop, uh, chainsaw.\n\n01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:02.040\nAnd it doesn't matter if like a redhead comes through, you're not going to try to impress\n\n01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:03.040\nher.\n\n01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:04.040\nYeah.\n\n01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:07.680\nWell, I feel like if, if you're wearing a mask, you don't have to be self-conscious\n\n01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:10.000\nthat someone will identify you or something.\n\n01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.000\nSo you have a mask on.\n\n01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:18.720\nSo you hear that kids that just, just words to live by.\n\n01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:27.680\nUm, but, uh, yeah, yeah, so, uh, uh, okay, so what, what, what, what are, what are your\n\n01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:28.680\nrules on touching?\n\n01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:35.240\nUh, well, I have a sign outside that says actors won't touch you and you don't touch\n\n01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:36.240\nthem.\n\n01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:37.240\nOkay.\n\n01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:40.800\nSo here's the thing, such a relief, like, I, I, like, like when I see that I'm like,\n\n01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:44.920\nyeah, well good, I guess, but at the same time, something in the back of my brain is\n\n01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:47.000\nlike, well, but now.\n\n01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.040\nLike, like, do you, did you ever struggle with that?\n\n01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:55.160\nDid, did you, in your career from 12 to 16, was there a time when that sign had to go\n\n01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:58.880\nup or did you, did your philosophy change where people like grabbing people's shirts\n\n01:36:58.880 --> 01:36:59.880\nor anything?\n\n01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:00.880\nWell, I was never a fan.\n\n01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:05.320\nI know there's those haunted houses that grab me or like feet or ankles or whatever\n\n01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:06.320\nthey touch you.\n\n01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:07.640\nI'm not a big fan of that.\n\n01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:08.640\nIt's New York shit.\n\n01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:09.640\nYeah.\n\n01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:16.000\nSort of Dino goes, like you grab their feet.\n\n01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.000\nDungeons.\n\n01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000\nYeah.\n\n01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.160\nBut so you, you are never a fan.\n\n01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:24.720\nYou're like, you're like, I like, like, but so what's your favorite, like, like, I don't\n\n01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:29.440\nknow, I'm trying to think like, like, like, is it like, is your bag of tricks primarily\n\n01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:33.000\nbased on like, I'm walking and I can't see everything.\n\n01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.680\nAnd then just a dude jumps out, like from behind something.\n\n01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:41.800\nI hate to sound like a demeaning your profession, like, like I'm from boiling it down to something.\n\n01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:46.240\nBut there's, because there's also like, I don't know, like, hands reaching through things.\n\n01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:48.280\nWhy am I pretending I'm an expert in what you do?\n\n01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:49.800\nYou'll have to come through, Dan.\n\n01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:54.560\nI'm going to come through, but with the, during the kitty hour, and I'm going to, I'm going\n\n01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:58.920\nto periscope the whole time so that it is so that if I, if I, if I, if I shriek, I can\n\n01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:05.040\nsell it, I can sell it, but, but, but, but is it like, you don't want to answer that\n\n01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:08.040\nbecause then you'll be like, that'll be giving away your recipe.\n\n01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:14.720\nSo, wait, are you asking me, eat the mic, tell, he'll tell us the secrets?\n\n01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:18.360\nWell, if the darker it is, the better.\n\n01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:28.360\nSo, um, if someone's not wearing a mask and it's dark, it's better and like, um, okay,\n\n01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:32.480\nlet's, okay, never, never mind, never mind.\n\n01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:33.480\nIt's all good.\n\n01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:34.480\nAll right.\n\n01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:35.480\nHey, it's hard.\n\n01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:36.480\nIt's hard to be up here.\n\n01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:37.480\nHe's doing a great job.\n\n01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:38.480\nHe's all doing a great job.\n\n01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:39.480\nThank you.\n\n01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:40.480\nThank you so much.\n\n01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:50.240\nWell, also, also it can be kind of hard trying to get people, uh, to come because we live\n\n01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:55.240\nat a, on the end of a very, uh, at the end of a cul-de-sac.\n\n01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:56.240\nAnd tell, tell me how you did it.\n\n01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:59.960\nThis year, we've got it, something that will catch your attention for sure.\n\n01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:00.960\nFor sure.\n\n01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:01.960\nShit.\n\n01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:02.960\nI don't know.\n\n01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:04.960\nAre you guys really hurting for traffic?\n\n01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:06.600\nI mean, how, like, that's the other thing.\n\n01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:07.600\nWhat about bandwidth?\n\n01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:11.480\nOh, if there's two cars on the, on the cul-de-sac, you have traffic already.\n\n01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:12.480\nYeah.\n\n01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:13.480\nRight.\n\n01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:15.520\nBut I'm saying, I'm saying like foot traffic going through your haunted house, like, are\n\n01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:16.520\nyou really craving?\n\n01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:18.800\nDo you, how, how much do you think you can handle?\n\n01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:26.840\nUh, well, we have, um, like, security guards slash, like, they help, like, when the people\n\n01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:27.840\ncome through.\n\n01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:28.920\nYou can scare people.\n\n01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:31.600\nYou can turn around a lot of scaring people per minute.\n\n01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:33.320\nYeah, I think so.\n\n01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:36.920\nBecause if we're plugging your haunted house, we're plugging my house because of my neighbor.\n\n01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:38.160\nI just realized that.\n\n01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:43.200\nThat's the scariest thing of all, is that I'm going to have just people in my kitchen.\n\n01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:45.280\nUh, uh, but that's fine.\n\n01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:47.320\nThere'll be fans and that'll be fine.\n\n01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:52.120\nUh, but, but, but, we thought, we thought you could dress up as the psycho woman and\n\n01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:54.240\nfrom your window.\n\n01:39:54.240 --> 01:40:00.280\nWe, well, that's something, you know, I never even, like, dress up like a granny or your\n\n01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:01.280\nmom.\n\n01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:06.280\nWell, that can help me, that can help me, like, uh, like cope with my, like, if I just\n\n01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:11.000\nplayed a part at the haunted house, if I just, or is that cheating, that's cheating.\n\n01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.120\nLook up at you and you'd be in your window doing this.\n\n01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:16.560\nI need to, oh, oh, like, play it from my house.\n\n01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:21.560\nI could just, like, I could just do weird things like, like, like, I thought that's\n\n01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:23.560\nwhat you were responding positively to.\n\n01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:24.560\nYeah.\n\n01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:27.880\nI was thinking about being down there and just being like a mummy that goes like, no, you\n\n01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:31.800\ncan stay in your house, and I just keep, I just keep going like, I can't figure out\n\n01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:47.000\nmy third act, bang, over and over, like, fade in on the, bang, daddy, why, why, no, shut\n\n01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:53.360\nup, it's for you, uh, like, it's just like weird shit going on, like, silhouettes and\n\n01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:54.360\nlike, yeah.\n\n01:40:54.360 --> 01:41:00.200\nTo more, tell them how you would get people over to your haunted maze.\n\n01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:07.360\nUh, I had an idea one year to make cards, business cards, so we make them, design them,\n\n01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:11.720\nthen hand them out to people at school, and then I give a bunch, so I have a bunch of friends\n\n01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:15.840\nthat come to work in the haunted house that don't go to my school, so I have friends from\n\n01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:19.960\nall these different schools, so I give them cards, and they hand them out to all the people\n\n01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:22.600\nat their school, and then the work travels.\n\n01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:27.680\nAnd then you had flyers, and where would all, you and all your friends go?\n\n01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:33.520\nStores, and more people, and then elementary schools, and then the other thing they would\n\n01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:37.280\ndo is they would go door knocking, inviting people to come.\n\n01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:40.240\nSo listening, you're knocking on the door going like, would you like to have a shit\n\n01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:41.240\nscared out of you?\n\n01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:42.240\nYes, yes.\n\n01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:43.240\nI'm thinking Thursday.\n\n01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:48.240\nUh, yeah, well, I mean, well, we can, it's early, the point was to bring you in early\n\n01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:51.680\nbecause I wanted to showcase, because if it was October, and I was like, this guy's working\n\n01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:53.440\non a haunted house, it'd be like, who cares?\n\n01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:58.840\nIt's weird, in a good way, to be 16 and be in your fourth year of this level of commitment\n\n01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:03.480\nto haunted house-ery, you're supposed to be so distracted by some of those people walking\n\n01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:07.960\nthrough there that you spend the next five to eight years living in an existential vacuum\n\n01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:13.200\nand thinking everyone's robots, and just going like this on a typewriter, doing derivative\n\n01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:18.520\nthings, but really just fantasizing about, like, this asphyxiation.\n\n01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:23.120\nThat would be normal, and listening to a lot of inexassed Phil Collins, Jane's Addiction,\n\n01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:26.640\nand, uh, uh, Shanaid O'Connor, like, like, sprinkled in there.\n\n01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:30.640\nWell, you know, one of the things that we thought, because he starts in May, it's basically,\n\n01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:33.440\nhe starts when school lets out.\n\n01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:36.880\nAnd so he would always, you know, I would tell him, I said, Timor, I said, you know\n\n01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:41.800\nwhat, I want my yard for barbecues, and he would always say, Mom, I'm already behind\n\n01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:42.800\nschedule!\n\n01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:49.320\nSo, you know, while other people are going to pool parties and barbecues, Timor is working\n\n01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:50.320\non his haunted maze.\n\n01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:53.520\nWell, people are living a normal life, I'm working on the haunted house.\n\n01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:54.760\nWhen does business start?\n\n01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:55.760\nWhen does it go up?\n\n01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:59.400\nUm, I'm always bad with times, though.\n\n01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:00.400\nMe too.\n\n01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:04.360\nMaybe that's part of the appeal, because you're like, I know what time it is now, it's Halloween\n\n01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:05.360\ntime.\n\n01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:10.280\nIt starts the second Friday of October.\n\n01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:11.280\nSecond Friday of October.\n\n01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:12.280\nAnd then Friday, Saturday.\n\n01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:13.280\nSecond Friday of October.\n\n01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:14.280\nSecond Friday of October.\n\n01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:15.280\nSecond Friday of October.\n\n01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:16.280\nSecond Friday of October.\n\n01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:17.280\nWho's going to forget that?\n\n01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:21.080\nYou know, we got some more, we got some more bookkeeping to take care of.\n\n01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:23.040\nSteve wants us to plug something.\n\n01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:24.040\nCan we do that?\n\n01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:25.040\nIs that okay?\n\n01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:26.040\nYeah, that's...\n\n01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:27.040\nSteve, you plug it.\n\n01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:28.040\nCome out here, Steve.\n\n01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:30.040\nCome out here.\n\n01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:37.280\nSteve texted me like 10 minutes ago, we got to plug this thing.\n\n01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:39.280\nYou fucking do it.\n\n01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:40.280\nI don't...\n\n01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:45.880\nAll right, well, because we had Michael Christian on the show in San Francisco.\n\n01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:46.880\nThe lost episode.\n\n01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:52.440\nIt's a lost episode, and he was plugging an event, and I told him that we would plug\n\n01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:53.440\nit.\n\n01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:54.440\nOf course.\n\n01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:55.440\nWell, yeah.\n\n01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:56.440\nMichael Christian does...\n\n01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:57.440\nIt's friendsforbenefits.org.\n\n01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:58.440\nThat's it.\n\n01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:03.600\nAnd what's the event that they're doing?\n\n01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:08.080\nIn November, they're doing an Avatar the Last Airbender and Legend of Korra event in San\n\n01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:12.000\nFrancisco at the JCC.\n\n01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.800\nThe tickets are on sale at friendsforbenefits.org.\n\n01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:18.840\nThey're going to have Janet Varney, who's the voice of Korra, Mindy Sterling, who's\n\n01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:25.280\nLynn Bayfong, Dante Bosco, who's Zuko, and John Michael Higgins, who is Varick.\n\n01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:26.280\nYeah, man.\n\n01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:27.280\nAnd they're going to do...\n\n01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:28.280\nIf you got a...\n\n01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:29.280\nYeah, friendsforbenefits.org.\n\n01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:30.280\nMichael Christian.\n\n01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:31.280\nThat's a good cause.\n\n01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:32.280\nLike, he...\n\n01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:36.040\nYeah, it's such a goddamn crime, my French man, Lindy.\n\n01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:37.040\nInspiring.\n\n01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:39.280\nAnd then to the Bay area, I mean, he has...\n\n01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:43.720\nI think it's a relative of ALS, or if it's not...\n\n01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:50.400\nIt's complicated, but it's that debilitating, but for him, way more congenital.\n\n01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:54.800\nStephen Hawking got to hang out and party in college, and then one day started to find\n\n01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:56.960\nout he had this thing that was like...\n\n01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:03.880\nMichael's wheelchair bound and has this fancy super villain wheelchair, and his whole life\n\n01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:09.920\nis like doing this foundation, this thing where he's coordinating, connecting people\n\n01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:18.040\nthat affect people with charities that can use that attention to benefit people that\n\n01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:20.600\nneed benefits.\n\n01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:22.440\nAnd he was there at the...\n\n01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:23.760\nI know it's kind of meta.\n\n01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:28.080\nHe runs a charity for charities, basically, but it's actually well needed.\n\n01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:29.080\nWe did a show in San Francisco.\n\n01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:30.360\nIt was an amazing interview.\n\n01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:35.720\nWe dragged him all the way out into the woods, and he has this crazy electric wheelchair,\n\n01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:41.400\nand it was a real nightmare to get him there, and then we lost his episode, and it was terrible.\n\n01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:42.600\nWe really fucked up.\n\n01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:43.600\nWe're sorry, Michael.\n\n01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:44.600\nWe're making it right.\n\n01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:45.600\nAvatar's great.\n\n01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:46.600\nWe're not making it right, but we're...\n\n01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:47.920\nNo, we're making it right.\n\n01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:48.920\nIt's great.\n\n01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:49.920\nI did a great job.\n\n01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:50.920\nIt's a great show.\n\n01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:51.920\nEverybody clap.\n\n01:45:51.920 --> 01:46:02.000\nI was just going to say, I wanted to check in this early because you guys should come\n\n01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:08.520\nback sometime in October because I want to follow the Howard Hughes journey of this pursuit\n\n01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:11.680\nof haunted house perfection.\n\n01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:14.720\nWe're going to check back in with you guys in October, right, before the haunted house\n\n01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:16.200\ngoes up.\n\n01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:20.040\nPreferably, if there's a show before the lights go on, before...\n\n01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:24.320\nI don't want to talk to you...I'll take anything, but I don't want to...I'd like to not talk\n\n01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:26.200\nto you after it's in full swing.\n\n01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:27.440\nYou'll be busy then anyway.\n\n01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:31.960\nI would like to...it would be nice if there's a show right before the big, like...\n\n01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:32.960\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:33.960\nThat would be nice.\n\n01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:38.160\nI want you at your highest level of anxiety, like where you're like, I don't have time for\n\n01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:39.160\nthis.\n\n01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:44.440\nI'm going to ask you what's going through your head right now, man.\n\n01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:49.360\nHow do you like your haunted house now, man?\n\n01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:55.360\nAnd Dan, there's something I want to give you before we end this.\n\n01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:58.840\nAt what time is it?\n\n01:46:58.840 --> 01:46:59.840\nOh, it's time to end this.\n\n01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:00.840\nThis is a great time for this.\n\n01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:01.840\nOh, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:02.840\nOkay.\n\n01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:03.840\nLet me go get it.\n\n01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:04.840\nDid you want to do it on...\n\n01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:05.840\nOkay, all right, yeah.\n\n01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:06.840\nWe'll do a good ending.\n\n01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:07.840\nHold on.\n\n01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:08.840\nOh, this will be great.\n\n01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:09.840\nI don't do good endings.\n\n01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:12.360\nWell, we're about to do a good ending.\n\n01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:15.280\nI had told Beth I had the gift for her.\n\n01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:18.600\nSomebody had cross-stitched the thing that said it was a quote from the show.\n\n01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:25.320\nThe Eucalyptus Tree Show, it said, now I can't remember the exact quote.\n\n01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:26.320\nTo be honest, Beth...\n\n01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:29.320\nThis is like cutting.\n\n01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:32.840\nLet's see here.\n\n01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:35.120\nWe had to remove four Eucalyptus trees.\n\n01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:40.840\nThey were four 100-year-old Eucalyptus trees, and they were right on the border between\n\n01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:44.080\nDan's and my house.\n\n01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:48.320\nWe have four young little trees there now.\n\n01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:51.880\nAnd this is a cutting from one of the trees that's growing.\n\n01:47:51.880 --> 01:48:02.640\nAnd it's a little branch, but I wanted to share it with you, and it's an evergreen.\n\n01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:08.040\nSo I just thought, you know, the four Eucalyptus trees, he was going through his divorce at\n\n01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:09.440\nthe time.\n\n01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:15.000\nAnd the trees were kind of an analogy.\n\n01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:16.000\nDid you know...\n\n01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.000\nDon't be rude.\n\n01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:29.360\nDid you know some six-billion-year-old organism has been drinking this already?\n\n01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:33.760\nDid you know Rob Corddry stayed in the Airbnb that's near our place, and he's a fan of the\n\n01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:36.400\npodcast, and he is therefore a fan of yours.\n\n01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:42.120\nI don't know if you know who Rob Corddry is, but I'm saying you should be excited.\n\n01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:44.120\nYou don't have to value that.\n\n01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:49.120\nBut it's cool, he's cool and funny and famous, and he was staying at that Airbnb.\n\n01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:55.360\nAnd he was listening to those episodes, and he was looking at his Wi-Fi, and it said Harmon\n\n01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:59.600\nWi-Fi, because he could see, and then he's like, wait a minute, and then he looked out\n\n01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:04.040\nthe window and there's Eucalyptus tree stumps, and the one that you were referring to that's\n\n01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:05.040\nin my yard?\n\n01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:06.040\nYes.\n\n01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:07.040\nAnyways, that was exciting.\n\n01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:10.520\nHe's on ballers, HBO's ballers.\n\n01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:11.520\nThere he is.\n\n01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:12.520\nThat's a picture of Rob Corddry.\n\n01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:14.520\nI remember a daily show.\n\n01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:20.880\nWell, you know what's funny is on those four Eucalyptus trees, we had stumps that were\n\n01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:24.160\nreally, really big, because they were big trees.\n\n01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:33.680\nAnd at one point, like I actually stood on this stump to give you some brownies or pancakes\n\n01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:34.680\nor something.\n\n01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:35.680\nYeah, muffins or something.\n\n01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:36.680\nSome hot shit.\n\n01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:37.680\nI ate it.\n\n01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:38.680\nYes.\n\n01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:39.680\nIt was good.\n\n01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:45.560\nSo now, then we had the stumps ground, and we were able to plant four little young trees.\n\n01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:48.360\nAnd within the stumps, or what, I don't know, sorry?\n\n01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:51.520\nNo, they were able to dig down like two feet down below the ground.\n\n01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:54.240\nSo you got little Eucalyptus babies coming up.\n\n01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:58.800\nWe had a little baby tree that was probably about this big, and now it's probably about\n\n01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:00.640\nfour times the size.\n\n01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:06.520\nI got to figure, I got to, it's like a joke that I don't care about my other tree.\n\n01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:14.920\nI got to get this well-respected arborist's number from you to examine my tree.\n\n01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:16.400\nMy therapist calls it self-care.\n\n01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:17.400\nOh, okay.\n\n01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:20.040\nLike she said, why is your right eye red?\n\n01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:22.800\nAnd I go, I stayed up all night playing Minecraft.\n\n01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:25.400\nAnd she's like, it sounds like you're not happy.\n\n01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:27.000\nAnd I said, no, I love Minecraft.\n\n01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.240\nAnd she said, but what did you do last night in Minecraft?\n\n01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:30.240\nI said, I don't know.\n\n01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:31.240\nI was asleep.\n\n01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:34.240\nSo you're playing Minecraft in your sleep.\n\n01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:37.760\nI'll save it for next episode.\n\n01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:44.920\nI'm self-destructing, but very happy that Cameron and Ria have their show and that\n\n01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:51.880\nit's doing well and that it's good and that you're finding your passion.\n\n01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:52.880\nAnd you don't have to.\n\n01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:53.880\nDon't get tricked into it.\n\n01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:56.160\nYou know, some kids, it's like, oh, I love trains.\n\n01:50:56.160 --> 01:50:57.160\nI'm six years old.\n\n01:50:57.160 --> 01:50:58.160\nEverybody keeps giving me trains.\n\n01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:00.600\nAnd it's like you're locked into this train thing.\n\n01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:02.400\nLike I always worry about those kids.\n\n01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:05.280\nLike somebody give this kid a turtle.\n\n01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:07.240\nJust give him an out.\n\n01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:09.280\nHe's boxed in.\n\n01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:10.840\nYou're 16.\n\n01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:12.720\nSo this could be, we don't know.\n\n01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:17.080\nIt could be your big ass haunted mansion thing where you're like, I've done it.\n\n01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:18.080\nThis is it.\n\n01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:19.680\nThis is my Burt Reynolds boogie nights.\n\n01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:23.640\nThis is the one, let the death of this industry begin.\n\n01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:32.080\nAnd you move on to something called hospitality houses, hotels, where when you walk in, you\n\n01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:39.320\ndon't get scared to the point where you're willing to pay $1,000 for a bay view.\n\n01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:40.320\nThat's an idea.\n\n01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:45.200\nHe has no idea what you're talking about when you say Burt Reynolds and boogie nights.\n\n01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:52.200\nI do well good because, yeah, a certain amount of clarity makes me a criminal, right?\n\n01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:56.400\nI mean, I didn't say, and I'd never said anyone could bring children to the show.\n\n01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:57.400\nAll right.\n\n01:51:57.400 --> 01:51:58.400\nAll right.\n\n01:51:58.400 --> 01:51:59.400\nWell, so, all right.\n\n01:51:59.400 --> 01:52:03.280\nSo Steve, oh, it's just Steve got this.\n\n01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:05.280\nAll
