00:00.000 --> 00:07.400
Ladies and gentlemen, put your digital hands together.

00:07.400 --> 00:08.520
So awful.

00:08.520 --> 00:10.480
Ladies and gentlemen, Harmontown.

00:10.480 --> 00:11.880
It's now in session.

00:11.880 --> 00:15.720
Please welcome to the stage Spencer Crittenden.

00:15.720 --> 00:17.520
Oh, you can make more noise than that.

00:17.520 --> 00:18.360
Yeah.

00:18.360 --> 00:20.320
Thank you so much.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.600
He's worked so hard for you.

00:21.600 --> 00:22.400
How are you, man?

00:22.400 --> 00:24.400
Welcome back.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.840
Good to see you always.

00:25.840 --> 00:29.080
Always good, comfortable to see you.

00:29.080 --> 00:30.200
Puts me at ease.

00:30.200 --> 00:31.640
We're ready to have a good show.

00:31.640 --> 00:32.560
I know, full show.

00:32.560 --> 00:33.560
Good show tonight.

00:33.560 --> 00:37.240
With Jeff, it's like, what is he about to pull, you know?

00:37.240 --> 00:38.680
I'm too dumb to be evil.

00:38.680 --> 00:39.560
No, no.

00:39.560 --> 00:40.480
You just are.

00:40.480 --> 00:43.000
You're on the side of good.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.760
I'm coming out and saying Jeff is not.

00:45.760 --> 00:48.360
It's about time somebody really fucking pulled Jeff's strings.

00:48.360 --> 00:48.860
Yeah.

00:48.860 --> 00:50.880
He's not a good dude.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.000
I do know a really good dude, though.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.640
And he is the mayor of Harmontown.

00:56.640 --> 00:57.520
Put your hands together.

00:57.520 --> 00:58.200
Make some noise.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.200
Don't slap your dog.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.080
Ladies and gentlemen, Dan Harmon.

01:01.080 --> 01:03.720
Don't slap your dog.

01:03.720 --> 01:04.880
Yo.

01:04.880 --> 01:05.560
Yo.

01:05.560 --> 01:06.200
Yo.

01:06.200 --> 01:06.880
Beep.

01:06.880 --> 01:07.440
Rap.

01:07.440 --> 01:08.080
Beat.

01:08.080 --> 01:08.720
Rap.

01:08.720 --> 01:11.080
Rap and rap to the beat.

01:11.080 --> 01:13.120
My name is MC Rap Beat.

01:13.120 --> 01:15.560
I like to rap to the beat when I rap in the street.

01:15.560 --> 01:18.080
I like to rap with my hands and also my feet.

01:18.080 --> 01:19.720
I like to rap with a Tweety Bird.

01:19.720 --> 01:21.320
Tweet, tweet, tweet.

01:21.320 --> 01:23.360
I like the snow in the sleep.

01:23.360 --> 01:25.000
Don't let it stop me, because I'm

01:25.000 --> 01:29.520
mailing the sheet to you through a rap shoe that I put on my foot

01:29.520 --> 01:30.760
when I bring it to you.

01:30.760 --> 01:33.360
I'm Mr. MC rapping a lot.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.800
I changed my name.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.120
My name's MC Snot.

01:36.120 --> 01:38.960
My name's MC Glapsalot.

01:38.960 --> 01:40.960
My name is Polkadot.

01:40.960 --> 01:43.600
I'm a rapper, rapper, rapper, roo.

01:43.600 --> 01:46.600
I'm getting my energy up before the shoe starts.

01:46.600 --> 01:47.400
OK, all right, good.

01:47.400 --> 01:47.760
Where we go?

01:47.760 --> 01:49.600
Yeah.

01:49.600 --> 01:52.320
Oh, boy.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.760
It's important to have me off guard, flat-footed.

01:54.760 --> 01:56.040
Yeah.

01:56.040 --> 01:56.560
Hi, Brandon.

01:56.560 --> 01:58.160
Thanks for guest-controlling, Brandon Johnson.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.400
So happy to be here.

01:59.400 --> 02:00.920
I'm so sorry, Jeff Davis is gone.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.200
Oh, where is he?

02:02.200 --> 02:02.840
I don't know.

02:02.840 --> 02:04.640
He's going to India.

02:04.640 --> 02:05.200
Never mind.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.080
I don't know if he's there yet?

02:06.080 --> 02:07.360
Yeah, I don't think he's there yet.

02:07.360 --> 02:07.920
Too baller.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.560
Too baller, man.

02:09.560 --> 02:10.360
Here's the never mind.

02:10.360 --> 02:11.680
He's flying Emirates.

02:11.680 --> 02:12.160
Wow.

02:12.160 --> 02:13.280
Yeah, never mind.

02:13.280 --> 02:14.160
That dude.

02:14.160 --> 02:18.880
Like he said he has a petting zoo in his section of the plane.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.440
But I bet it's like two turtles.

02:20.440 --> 02:23.320
Yeah, his life is what my life would be like if my parents

02:23.320 --> 02:26.520
would love me.

02:26.520 --> 02:30.800
I don't know if that's how he got there.

02:30.800 --> 02:33.320
Maybe like the indirect result of Drew Carey's parents

02:33.320 --> 02:36.120
really not loving him a lot and trickled down.

02:36.120 --> 02:36.600
Who know?

02:36.600 --> 02:40.760
We have no idea who to thank or let's just thank.

02:40.760 --> 02:43.840
Let's just thank the god of privilege, privilege.

02:43.840 --> 02:44.520
That's the name.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.960
Whatever.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.080
How have you been?

02:53.080 --> 02:54.040
I never ask about you.

02:54.040 --> 02:54.760
I've been good.

02:54.760 --> 02:55.320
I've been good.

02:55.320 --> 02:56.680
There's not much to tell.

02:56.680 --> 02:57.720
Seven dry cleaners.

02:57.720 --> 03:00.160
I keep everything legit.

03:00.160 --> 03:01.840
My maid won't seem to do her work.

03:01.840 --> 03:04.800
But other than that, life is good.

03:04.800 --> 03:07.240
If those are the only jigsaw pieces you have a Brandon's

03:07.240 --> 03:10.160
life, that could be anything.

03:10.160 --> 03:12.520
Seven dry cleaners are made that won't.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.760
We don't know if he's in a giant mansion

03:14.760 --> 03:18.120
or a tiny William Gibson techno coffin.

03:18.120 --> 03:21.920
Pretty sure it's a deluxe apartment in the sky.

03:21.920 --> 03:22.960
Moving on up.

03:22.960 --> 03:25.480
What was the thing in the Jefferson's theme?

03:25.480 --> 03:28.320
It was that beans don't burn in the kitchen?

03:28.320 --> 03:28.880
That's right.

03:28.880 --> 03:31.680
And what doesn't burn on a grill?

03:31.680 --> 03:34.760
I think it's something else doesn't burn on the grill.

03:34.760 --> 03:36.720
Something else doesn't burn on a grill.

03:36.720 --> 03:37.600
I have to get the whole thing out of my head.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.040
Are you offended that I'm coming to you for the answer to this?

03:40.040 --> 03:40.280
No, no.

03:40.280 --> 03:41.400
It's a mystery to all people.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.160
Right.

03:42.160 --> 03:45.040
This is a, I've been asking Brandon as a representative

03:45.040 --> 03:47.640
of the 70s, not anything else.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.880
This is going to be, I feel so bad because so many people

03:49.880 --> 03:52.680
are on Reddit are going to be like, oh!

03:52.680 --> 03:53.800
What's this?

03:53.800 --> 03:54.880
They need that though.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.480
They need that more than we do.

03:56.480 --> 03:59.120
I think they might be calming down now though.

03:59.120 --> 03:59.840
I don't know.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.200
Nah.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.960
It's funny how we have moods and our moods

04:02.960 --> 04:04.160
affect our perception of the world.

04:04.160 --> 04:07.240
Like right now I feel like the world is more comfortable

04:07.240 --> 04:07.840
with racism.

04:07.840 --> 04:09.400
Where did I get that?

04:09.400 --> 04:10.480
Why did I decide that?

04:10.480 --> 04:12.520
What did I, it's nothing, it's the answer

04:12.520 --> 04:13.560
is it's something I ate.

04:13.560 --> 04:15.200
It's like not, it's not something I saw.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.040
I didn't see somebody come out with a report on Reddit

04:17.040 --> 04:18.920
that said we're going to be less sensitive now.

04:18.920 --> 04:20.800
I think it's because of an epiphany I had.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.640
I was eating breakfast with my girlfriend and her dad.

04:23.640 --> 04:27.480
And I don't know, I don't know what got my mind on to it.

04:27.480 --> 04:30.200
But then I just started realizing this thing about

04:30.200 --> 04:32.680
epiphanies about like how you really,

04:32.680 --> 04:35.320
I don't know, the good ones are just like dodoys.

04:35.320 --> 04:37.680
They're not, when you explain them they're like, yeah,

04:37.680 --> 04:39.960
I had that epiphany when I was 13.

04:39.960 --> 04:43.160
But and I've had this one I feel several times.

04:43.160 --> 04:45.240
But I really, there's a difference between that

04:45.240 --> 04:45.880
and feeling it.

04:45.880 --> 04:48.840
I really started to feel at breakfast

04:48.840 --> 04:51.360
because I pulled out my phone and I wrote it down.

04:51.360 --> 04:54.280
It was a hashtag epiphany in my bear notes app.

04:54.280 --> 04:58.960
Like I got to remember this epiphany, which was just that.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.800
Wait, what's bear notes app?

05:00.800 --> 05:03.440
It's my latest app I'm trying.

05:03.440 --> 05:04.320
Sorry, continue.

05:04.320 --> 05:07.040
Bear, you can look it up in the App Store.

05:07.040 --> 05:11.440
It's based on tags, tag clouds instead of, it's weird.

05:11.440 --> 05:12.320
It's weird at first.

05:12.320 --> 05:14.440
But if you get used to it, it could be good.

05:14.440 --> 05:15.120
I don't know.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.480
Why did I keel on that?

05:16.480 --> 05:18.880
I don't know.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.120
Here's my epiphany.

05:20.120 --> 05:24.720
So if you are a machine or let's say an organism,

05:24.720 --> 05:25.760
it really doesn't matter.

05:25.760 --> 05:26.720
Organisms are machines.

05:30.880 --> 05:32.000
You're a structure.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.800
You have internal mechanisms.

05:33.800 --> 05:34.680
You are capable.

05:34.680 --> 05:36.160
You take things in.

05:36.160 --> 05:37.760
And you put things out.

05:37.760 --> 05:40.320
And so flowers do that.

05:40.320 --> 05:41.400
Whales do that.

05:41.400 --> 05:42.720
The earth does that.

05:42.720 --> 05:43.880
Every system does that.

05:43.880 --> 05:45.120
Every device does that.

05:45.120 --> 05:48.480
We're all just systems, each of us individually.

05:48.480 --> 05:51.560
So we take in good shit.

05:51.560 --> 05:52.920
We take in bad shit.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.760
And we're all different.

05:54.760 --> 05:58.920
So there's different shit that's bad to every person.

05:58.920 --> 06:02.840
If somebody says the N word on the freeway at me,

06:02.840 --> 06:05.120
it makes me confused.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.040
It made something different to you.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.760
It's both bad things coming out of that person.

06:09.760 --> 06:15.600
But I go for there's a lot of weird confusion

06:15.600 --> 06:16.560
at the top of that.

06:16.560 --> 06:19.360
My process is I'm like, is there lighting weird in my car?

06:19.360 --> 06:20.800
What's with this person?

06:20.800 --> 06:22.440
Are they blind?

06:22.440 --> 06:24.160
I don't know.

06:24.160 --> 06:25.520
Are they on my side?

06:25.520 --> 06:26.840
And are they black?

06:26.840 --> 06:30.440
And they're like high-fiving me for my awesome driving.

06:33.480 --> 06:39.160
So the definition of what a bad thing is is subjective.

06:39.160 --> 06:42.360
It's not about like, oh, some people

06:42.360 --> 06:45.960
are in such a good mood that I listen to podcasts

06:45.960 --> 06:48.120
where there's people that they have problems

06:48.120 --> 06:50.400
and there's people that want to help them with their problems.

06:50.400 --> 06:53.960
So for those people, what you and I would consider toxic,

06:53.960 --> 06:57.040
that person considers an episode of a podcast.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.720
So not to get too derailed with that,

06:59.720 --> 07:03.840
but the larger point being you have all this shit that

07:03.840 --> 07:05.080
comes at you.

07:05.080 --> 07:08.280
And it's all good and bad mixed up shit.

07:08.280 --> 07:12.880
And then we all have the ability as systems to, first of all,

07:12.880 --> 07:15.160
we're constantly growing and reprogramming ourselves,

07:15.160 --> 07:18.680
restructuring ourselves, just as cells and plants

07:18.680 --> 07:21.200
and factories and us.

07:21.200 --> 07:24.600
And this stuff comes in.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.720
So we, first of all, the miracles

07:26.720 --> 07:30.520
that we do have the ability to take in diarrhea,

07:30.520 --> 07:34.480
not literally, but verbal diarrhea,

07:34.480 --> 07:35.720
such as I'm spouting right now.

07:35.720 --> 07:38.360
Or really horrible toxic, horrible shit,

07:38.360 --> 07:40.880
like what you see on Facebook or Twitter.

07:40.880 --> 07:41.600
Toxicity.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.400
Or someone attacking you in a comment section

07:43.400 --> 07:48.640
because you said something wrong or bad shit.

07:48.640 --> 07:54.840
We have the ability to turn it into good shit,

07:54.840 --> 07:57.720
the classic example being that if I have a terrible life,

07:57.720 --> 08:02.000
if everybody picks on me, if I feel awful,

08:02.000 --> 08:04.360
if I have feelings of anxiety and depression and things,

08:04.360 --> 08:06.480
because of the shit that's happening to me in my life,

08:06.480 --> 08:08.240
but then I write a play about it.

08:08.240 --> 08:10.360
And then everyone goes and sees the play

08:10.360 --> 08:13.120
and walks out feeling really good.

08:13.120 --> 08:14.880
Not because it's a feel good play,

08:14.880 --> 08:16.680
but because they saw a good play.

08:16.680 --> 08:19.240
Like there's catharsis, like you can see a depressing play

08:19.240 --> 08:21.040
and be like, wow, he fucking nailed it.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.480
He knows exactly how depressed I am.

08:22.480 --> 08:24.600
And then some of your depression comes out.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.000
The bottom line being, as we all know,

08:27.000 --> 08:29.280
you can take in bad stuff and you can put out good stuff.

08:29.280 --> 08:32.880
And in fact, that's kind of what we try to do all the time.

08:32.880 --> 08:38.200
So now that times have gotten, for most of us,

08:38.200 --> 08:42.120
very challenging, there's a lot of shit in the air.

08:42.120 --> 08:44.200
There's a lot of bad stuff coming at us.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.640
It's just sort of sitting at breakfast

08:46.640 --> 08:49.200
and just thinking about all these podcasts I've

08:49.200 --> 08:51.360
been listening to where people do like they just,

08:51.360 --> 08:53.000
I don't have this shit that rolls off their back

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
that I find amazing.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.680
I was like, how come you don't just tell that person

08:55.680 --> 08:56.560
to go fuck themselves?

08:56.560 --> 09:00.520
Like why are you trying to still understand this person

09:00.520 --> 09:03.040
and help them with their in-laws for your little podcast?

09:03.040 --> 09:04.200
It's not just greed.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.080
It's like you're Canadian or something.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.680
Like, I don't know what it is.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.880
I guess I should promote the podcast I'm describing.

09:10.880 --> 09:14.880
It's on the Gimlet network.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.960
It's called Heavyweight.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.880
It's this guy, John, something.

09:19.880 --> 09:23.480
And he just makes his friends and family's business,

09:23.480 --> 09:24.400
all his business.

09:24.400 --> 09:25.880
And he's like a really friendly guy.

09:25.880 --> 09:31.240
He tries to resolve long, unresolved issues,

09:31.240 --> 09:33.840
family members that aren't speaking to each other for decades.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.120
Are they on the show?

09:35.120 --> 09:38.360
Yeah, the person, a friend or a relative or someone

09:38.360 --> 09:40.880
that he knows will come to him with something

09:40.880 --> 09:42.040
that's been weighing on them.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.440
I think that's why it's called Heavyweight.

09:43.440 --> 09:46.000
And then he'll just get up all in there shit

09:46.000 --> 09:48.440
and make phone calls and arrange meetings.

09:48.440 --> 09:52.480
And I was just kind of marveling at the guys.

09:52.480 --> 09:53.800
Because there's people that attack him.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.400
There's people that criticize him.

09:55.400 --> 09:59.680
There's people that are engaged in vampiric toxicity

09:59.680 --> 10:00.600
towards him or shit.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.600
Like, his famous episode is the one

10:02.600 --> 10:08.400
where a friend of his who is a guy who gave Moby all

10:08.400 --> 10:12.760
of those black people LPs that Moby used to launch us

10:12.760 --> 10:15.840
and to become a billionaire.

10:15.840 --> 10:21.800
Like, oh, I don't got a fish bone on my plate.

10:21.800 --> 10:25.000
And then Moby, the guy that gave

10:25.000 --> 10:29.960
that disc set to him or whatever, is also a musician.

10:29.960 --> 10:33.680
But he's not Moby, and he's not actively.

10:33.680 --> 10:36.720
So there's a whole episode about him wanting to just basically

10:36.720 --> 10:39.280
get near, talk to Moby again.

10:39.280 --> 10:47.040
And it was weird, and it was awkward, and this guy that

10:47.040 --> 10:51.360
gets involved in this shit, he actively gallops into shit

10:51.360 --> 10:53.640
that I would be like, no, fuck that.

10:53.640 --> 10:56.640
Nope, nope, nope.

10:56.640 --> 10:58.760
And so I was sitting at breakfast kind of like digesting,

10:58.760 --> 11:00.800
having binge listened to this guy's podcast.

11:00.800 --> 11:04.880
And I just like, I am a bad person.

11:04.880 --> 11:07.640
I should be after all I have gotten after all.

11:07.640 --> 11:08.880
It's like, why am I still fucking?

11:08.880 --> 11:12.280
Why am I so sensitive if this guy isn't?

11:12.280 --> 11:16.240
And I was like, wait, well, sensitivity, he's sensitive too.

11:16.240 --> 11:19.640
And I was like, ah, sensitivity is different

11:19.640 --> 11:22.720
from fucking systemic shutdown.

11:22.720 --> 11:27.680
You can be sensitive to garbage.

11:27.680 --> 11:30.880
You can be like, that guy's lying, that guy's racist,

11:30.880 --> 11:33.400
that guy's full of shit, that guy's kind of full of shit,

11:33.400 --> 11:35.640
but trying to convince himself he's not full of shit.

11:35.640 --> 11:39.960
So you can have a really laser resolution of bullshit

11:39.960 --> 11:42.960
detection, and that person wants something from me,

11:42.960 --> 11:47.200
that person's a drag, that person's an energy drain.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.000
But you don't need to.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.920
It's not a superior machine that recognizes that shit,

11:51.920 --> 11:54.840
and then in response to anything less than perfect,

11:54.840 --> 11:57.080
it goes, pew.

11:57.080 --> 12:00.320
And that's kind of what we're doing probably a little too

12:00.320 --> 12:03.760
much of, is going like, oh, no, no, no.

12:03.760 --> 12:05.600
You just said that, and nope.

12:08.720 --> 12:12.000
That either makes me blow a whistle that shrieks

12:12.000 --> 12:14.680
at the top at 1,000 decibels.

12:14.680 --> 12:20.880
Is that, if that's your function, that's good.

12:20.880 --> 12:22.920
You should stay that sensitive, and you should then

12:22.920 --> 12:25.440
be the alarm person.

12:25.440 --> 12:29.680
But if you're not that person, if that's not

12:29.680 --> 12:31.840
your full function, if you're not helping things

12:31.840 --> 12:35.040
by blowing that alarm, or if it's not making you personally

12:35.040 --> 12:37.680
happy too, use the other shit you could do with all that stuff

12:37.680 --> 12:39.080
coming into you too.

12:39.080 --> 12:39.560
I don't know.

12:39.560 --> 12:43.080
There's this thing, the Jerusalem, the Trump

12:43.080 --> 12:44.160
announcement that he's going to make.

12:44.160 --> 12:49.280
See, he took a bad thing, and he made a wonderful, go on.

12:49.280 --> 12:51.320
Where he announced that he's going to move the US Embassy

12:51.320 --> 12:54.000
to Jerusalem and make a big hubbub.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.360
And the world has freaked out about it.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.080
This is to your point.

12:59.080 --> 13:01.520
But the truth is, it takes years for that to occur.

13:01.520 --> 13:03.720
He has to get funding, architects have to draw up plans.

13:03.720 --> 13:06.160
But people are acting like he's going to do this within the next

13:06.160 --> 13:06.880
week.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.720
And that's sort of how we've gotten.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.920
We've gotten to this place where he says something.

13:10.920 --> 13:11.760
Somebody said something.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.640
We hear something, and we automatically

13:13.640 --> 13:16.800
freak out, not really looking back and being like,

13:16.800 --> 13:20.560
well, no girl scout is going to join the Boy Scouts.

13:20.560 --> 13:23.600
The Boy Scouts just said girls could join.

13:23.600 --> 13:26.120
And it's because we started off the year

13:26.120 --> 13:29.920
so hypersensitive, which is a reaction to any trauma,

13:29.920 --> 13:31.840
that now when we hear it's raining,

13:31.840 --> 13:33.800
we legitimately are like, well, it's probably

13:33.800 --> 13:35.000
going to be one of those rains.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.400
So you're exactly right.

13:36.400 --> 13:39.800
I think to our credit, if we are on the left,

13:39.800 --> 13:44.120
I don't think we're actually, I think a lot of that is like,

13:44.120 --> 13:49.000
we're just so frustrated waiting for a referee

13:49.000 --> 13:51.120
to blow a whistle that we're just like,

13:51.120 --> 13:56.560
our booze are getting louder, and we're just incredulous.

13:56.560 --> 13:59.680
And we just want, we want at any moment, we're like, well,

13:59.680 --> 14:03.000
maybe this is the thing, because this is like holy land.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.960
This is none of his business.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.000
I remember in the beginning, there was a whole buffet set

14:08.000 --> 14:08.400
out there.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.600
I would sit there on Twitter and write these threads,

14:10.600 --> 14:14.480
because I was trying to make my religious relatives

14:14.480 --> 14:16.320
or people that were Christian.

14:16.320 --> 14:20.000
I was trying to go like, he missed that prayer breakfast

14:20.000 --> 14:20.440
or whatever.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.040
Remember when that was a big deal?

14:22.040 --> 14:24.400
And I was like, aha, so he missed a prayer breakfast.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.880
Now, I ask you this, is this man a Christian?

14:26.880 --> 14:31.960
But I was really just like, all we've been doing ever since

14:31.960 --> 14:34.720
is we're just trying to find his off switch.

14:34.720 --> 14:37.000
Now, our trying to find his off switch

14:37.000 --> 14:38.960
is really making us flail a lot.

14:38.960 --> 14:42.160
And I think we should continue to try to find his off switch.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.280
But I think we should explore more sides of him

14:44.280 --> 14:46.440
than, obviously, the front-facing side,

14:46.440 --> 14:48.480
because I don't think Donald Trump puts his off switch

14:48.480 --> 14:51.160
on his front-facing side.

14:51.160 --> 14:54.760
I think he, but more importantly, I mean,

14:54.760 --> 14:56.600
going back to my mechanism metaphor,

14:56.600 --> 15:00.120
clearly this is a man running on our tears.

15:00.120 --> 15:07.840
I mean, we are putting out terror and sadness and outrage.

15:07.840 --> 15:11.680
And it is fueling him.

15:11.680 --> 15:12.440
And that's fine.

15:12.440 --> 15:15.200
That doesn't mean to stop being outraged,

15:15.200 --> 15:16.000
stop crying.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
That doesn't mean go numb.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.120
It just means we know that he's already playing the game

15:20.120 --> 15:20.880
I'm describing.

15:20.880 --> 15:25.240
He's a long time ago, either by virtue of sociopathology

15:25.240 --> 15:27.560
or some epiphany of his own he had.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.920
He was like, well, why should I keep on?

15:30.920 --> 15:34.400
What am I supposed to shut down every time my mom yells at me?

15:34.400 --> 15:36.520
Am I supposed to shut down every time my dad punches

15:36.520 --> 15:38.640
my mom in front of me and looks at me and says,

15:38.640 --> 15:40.480
if you cry, then you're a woman like her?

15:40.480 --> 15:42.600
Yeah, I'm just speculating the kind of childhood he probably

15:42.600 --> 15:44.160
had given his current pathology.

15:44.160 --> 15:47.640
I took a little bit of psych in high school.

15:47.640 --> 15:48.880
I think something blue.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.560
College prep?

15:50.560 --> 15:51.440
What's that?

15:51.440 --> 15:53.000
College prep psychology?

15:53.000 --> 15:55.480
Yeah, I think it was worth a college credit, possibly.

15:55.480 --> 15:56.120
Yeah.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.400
Yeah, but I mean, this is Milwaukee Public Schools.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.560
I don't think that, or no, it's Brown Deer.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.520
All right, look, don't write letters.

16:04.520 --> 16:05.160
I'm not a fraud.

16:05.160 --> 16:06.720
Look into my transcripts.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.120
No, you had a class in high school.

16:08.120 --> 16:09.080
I took a psych class.

16:09.080 --> 16:10.640
Yeah, in high school.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.960
I believe it was probably worth a college credit.

16:12.960 --> 16:13.800
No.

16:13.800 --> 16:14.640
OK, it probably wasn't.

16:14.640 --> 16:18.320
OK, they showed us many, many slideshows about things

16:18.320 --> 16:20.040
like gestalt.

16:20.040 --> 16:20.540
Right.

16:24.040 --> 16:26.160
I took that class, too.

16:26.160 --> 16:30.520
So anyways, this guy, either because he's a monster

16:30.520 --> 16:33.360
or because he's not even going to say the words, I guess I am,

16:33.360 --> 16:40.560
that he's like more evolved, like in that respect,

16:40.560 --> 16:42.960
that he's like, well, what are you supposed to do?

16:42.960 --> 16:45.400
Are you supposed to shut down when someone

16:45.400 --> 16:47.120
says you're a racist douchebag?

16:47.120 --> 16:48.920
Are you supposed to take that information in

16:48.920 --> 16:50.960
and through a elaborate system of mirror turn it

16:50.960 --> 16:53.640
into fucking Trump food and eat it?

16:53.640 --> 16:54.640
And that's what he's done.

16:54.640 --> 16:57.520
He's like, yes, I'm hearing I'm racist again.

16:57.520 --> 17:00.080
I call that a victory.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.040
He's generating victory for himself.

17:02.040 --> 17:03.280
I don't want to comment.

17:03.280 --> 17:04.880
I don't want to be his life coach.

17:04.880 --> 17:08.880
But most of us aren't dealing with him personally

17:08.880 --> 17:09.720
on a day-to-day basis.

17:09.720 --> 17:12.320
And what we are dealing with is mostly for better or for worse,

17:12.320 --> 17:14.160
we're dealing with people digitally.

17:14.160 --> 17:17.520
And so I just have this epiphany in my head

17:17.520 --> 17:22.320
where I'm like, I have been too defensive, too fucking like,

17:22.320 --> 17:24.800
it's like if someone is feeding into you,

17:24.800 --> 17:26.560
they're going like, hey, you're fat.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.000
Season six of Community Sucked.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.240
Season three of Rick and Morty Sucked.

17:30.240 --> 17:34.880
You're a cuck, you're, again, with the fat.

17:34.880 --> 17:39.840
I can't, people aren't really that, I don't know.

17:39.840 --> 17:44.120
They give you chemicals and a little line

17:44.120 --> 17:45.560
that they've stuck into you.

17:45.560 --> 17:46.720
You're receiving it.

17:46.720 --> 17:48.360
And then you just take it in.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.120
You process it.

17:49.120 --> 17:56.880
There is like, if somebody says, we should make America great

17:56.880 --> 18:01.120
again by getting rid of all the brown people,

18:01.120 --> 18:04.600
you could process that and go, I think it's great

18:04.600 --> 18:05.720
that you think America's great.

18:05.720 --> 18:06.720
I love America, too.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.720
Oh.

18:08.720 --> 18:11.280
Ha ha ha ha.

18:11.280 --> 18:11.840
Now.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.600
I'm pretty sure you're talking to a person

18:13.600 --> 18:16.440
with a mental disability.

18:16.440 --> 18:19.000
And at which point, to continue to take what they're saying

18:19.000 --> 18:19.800
seriously.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.640
Well, no, we're not, we're not, we're not trying.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.160
We're not wasting time on this person.

18:24.160 --> 18:25.960
You're correct to correct me on that.

18:25.960 --> 18:28.760
Once someone calls people brown people,

18:28.760 --> 18:29.560
I'm pretty much like, oh, no.

18:29.560 --> 18:30.840
I didn't know those were my words.

18:30.840 --> 18:33.040
I don't know this person, but.

18:33.040 --> 18:34.480
This motherfucker hates math.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.080
You first and foremost, you're correct about that.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.680
We're not going to get in arguments with these people.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.200
We're not going to try to change them.

18:39.200 --> 18:42.080
But, but, but, you know, what we're finding, I think,

18:42.080 --> 18:45.800
is that these people, when we do the other thing besides

18:45.800 --> 18:49.640
try to change them, which is like, like, just kind of like,

18:49.640 --> 18:51.640
fucking like, I don't know, whatever you call it.

18:51.640 --> 18:54.200
Like, sometimes, a lot of times, I just block them.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.360
I don't know, they might be getting energy from that.

18:56.360 --> 18:57.200
They are.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.040
Yeah, you should mute them instead.

18:59.040 --> 18:59.880
They don't know.

18:59.880 --> 19:02.520
Yeah, but if you mute them and they directly tweet you,

19:02.520 --> 19:04.080
the mute is not, not function.

19:04.080 --> 19:05.800
Not anymore.

19:05.800 --> 19:06.840
They upgraded the mute button?

19:06.840 --> 19:09.040
As far as I understand, I've never seen anything

19:09.040 --> 19:11.480
from a muted person unless I saw it out.

19:11.480 --> 19:12.840
But it used to be like that.

19:12.840 --> 19:13.680
That's what I do now.

19:13.680 --> 19:16.720
Now I have like 1,000 muted people.

19:16.720 --> 19:20.680
At one point, I had 9-11 muted people.

19:20.680 --> 19:24.720
I would just mute, I would go through and mute everyone

19:24.720 --> 19:29.680
and then unmute you, Elon Musk.

19:29.680 --> 19:30.400
People do that.

19:30.400 --> 19:33.960
And yeah, like my girlfriend or whatever, you know,

19:33.960 --> 19:35.920
like, and that would be called, I guess, Facebook?

19:35.920 --> 19:38.960
Or like, yeah, pretty much.

19:38.960 --> 19:39.680
All right, well.

19:39.680 --> 19:43.240
There is a little bit, you're correct about the overload.

19:43.240 --> 19:45.680
There's a bit of an overload and we are reacting now

19:45.680 --> 19:48.160
instinctually without really, you know.

19:48.160 --> 19:49.840
I think we're getting more signals.

19:49.840 --> 19:52.840
And if, in general, and if more signals are bad

19:52.840 --> 19:54.720
and we're used to less signals and now we're

19:54.720 --> 19:56.880
getting more bad signals, we're going to kind of

19:56.880 --> 19:57.920
frazzle to some extent, right?

19:57.920 --> 20:00.080
Yeah, it's tough because you start,

20:00.080 --> 20:02.800
you want to, the accurate language you use now

20:02.800 --> 20:04.360
all has all these horrible connotations.

20:04.360 --> 20:05.760
Because I want to use a word like trigger.

20:05.760 --> 20:08.200
And I want to say like, in other words, kids,

20:08.200 --> 20:12.760
if a stranger has the ability to trigger you

20:12.760 --> 20:19.760
into negative behavior, are you a superior machine?

20:19.760 --> 20:22.760
Are you a superior machine to the triggering machine?

20:22.760 --> 20:25.760
Or are you losing a fucking AI battle?

20:25.760 --> 20:29.760
You know, if someone has the ability to shut you down,

20:29.760 --> 20:35.760
to make you numb, to make you simply scream at the top

20:35.760 --> 20:38.760
of your lungs and point at the thing and say,

20:38.760 --> 20:40.760
bad thing, bad thing.

20:40.760 --> 20:42.760
There's gray areas here.

20:42.760 --> 20:44.760
I don't want to say that any of those things are

20:44.760 --> 20:46.760
necessarily inappropriate responses.

20:46.760 --> 20:51.760
But I'm going to start asking myself the question like,

20:51.760 --> 20:54.760
well, do I want to be a superior machine or not?

20:54.760 --> 20:56.760
A superior machine is like, I'm taking in a little bit

20:56.760 --> 20:58.760
of nitrogen, a little bit of oxygen,

20:58.760 --> 21:00.760
a little bit of carbon dioxide, a little bit of carbon monoxide,

21:00.760 --> 21:02.760
a little bit of aluminum.

21:02.760 --> 21:06.760
It's all this person just saying some random fucking

21:06.760 --> 21:09.760
second amendment, like a justifying thing,

21:09.760 --> 21:11.760
or he's a flat earth or he just doesn't like me

21:11.760 --> 21:12.760
because I'm fatter.

21:12.760 --> 21:15.760
I said something bad about Jim Henson once.

21:15.760 --> 21:17.760
And they're just trolling me or they're just like

21:17.760 --> 21:18.760
barfing up on me.

21:18.760 --> 21:22.760
It's like, the barf, if I'm a superior machine,

21:22.760 --> 21:24.760
there's, even if it's one part per billion,

21:24.760 --> 21:26.760
there's like nutrition in the barf.

21:26.760 --> 21:29.760
And I just put it in my little barf processing stomachs.

21:29.760 --> 21:30.760
Yeah, like dogs.

21:30.760 --> 21:32.760
And then the rest passes through me.

21:32.760 --> 21:34.760
Well, no-ish.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.760
So you don't want the, if it's a white suit,

21:37.760 --> 21:39.760
everybody's born with a beautiful white suit.

21:39.760 --> 21:40.760
We all get our white suits.

21:40.760 --> 21:41.760
It's three-piece, it's gorgeous.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.760
You want to try and keep it clean?

21:43.760 --> 21:45.760
You want to try and take care of it,

21:45.760 --> 21:46.760
dry clean it when it needs to get dry clean.

21:46.760 --> 21:48.760
And if somebody's flinging mud at you,

21:48.760 --> 21:50.760
you don't want to keep visiting that joint

21:50.760 --> 21:52.760
because it's about keeping the suit clean.

21:52.760 --> 21:54.760
The same thing goes for your mind and your spirit.

21:54.760 --> 21:57.760
Yeah, well, you move, you move the mechanism that you are

21:57.760 --> 21:58.760
if you're in a place where you're,

21:58.760 --> 22:01.760
where all the cords connecting to you are 99% barf

22:01.760 --> 22:02.760
and 1% nutrition.

22:02.760 --> 22:05.760
Yeah, you probably like, you've probably picked,

22:05.760 --> 22:08.760
unless you figure out how to now take on a new organ

22:08.760 --> 22:12.760
or something that actually turns barf into sunshine

22:12.760 --> 22:13.760
or...

22:13.760 --> 22:15.760
Say that once you have barf,

22:15.760 --> 22:18.760
you identify that it's barf and you step around it.

22:18.760 --> 22:20.760
You don't even try and get the nutrients from barf.

22:20.760 --> 22:23.760
Or if you figure out how to turn barf into dramamine.

22:23.760 --> 22:24.760
I don't know, I think...

22:24.760 --> 22:25.760
And then you put dramamine out

22:25.760 --> 22:27.760
and it goes back around the people

22:27.760 --> 22:29.760
and they don't, and then they start barfing less.

22:29.760 --> 22:31.760
And then it's like, if that is your job,

22:31.760 --> 22:34.760
you know, like that's a thing that you are good at

22:34.760 --> 22:35.760
and you enjoy doing.

22:35.760 --> 22:37.760
You go stand in that place and you collect barf

22:37.760 --> 22:39.760
and then you like, you put out this other chemical

22:39.760 --> 22:41.760
and then the barf recedes

22:41.760 --> 22:43.760
and people that are passing by go,

22:43.760 --> 22:44.760
why are you doing that?

22:44.760 --> 22:45.760
Don't feed the trolls and you go,

22:45.760 --> 22:46.760
I'm not, I'm reducing barf.

22:46.760 --> 22:47.760
You'll thank me later.

22:47.760 --> 22:49.760
Or it's just something I enjoy doing.

22:49.760 --> 22:50.760
If you don't enjoy doing it,

22:50.760 --> 22:51.760
I think most importantly,

22:51.760 --> 22:53.760
like yeah, you fucking like...

22:53.760 --> 22:56.760
You know, you move that factory to a place

22:56.760 --> 23:00.760
where the compositions are better enabling you

23:00.760 --> 23:01.760
to put out good things.

23:01.760 --> 23:02.760
Yes.

23:02.760 --> 23:03.760
For sure.

23:03.760 --> 23:04.760
We can both agree on that.

23:04.760 --> 23:06.760
I just think there are some people out there,

23:06.760 --> 23:08.760
I think we could have some of these trolls on our side

23:08.760 --> 23:10.760
if they could start to understand that there's like a way.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.760
People like...

23:12.760 --> 23:14.760
There are people that troll

23:14.760 --> 23:17.760
because they don't trust...

23:17.760 --> 23:19.760
They don't trust dichotomy.

23:19.760 --> 23:21.760
They don't trust systems that tell them

23:21.760 --> 23:22.760
there's a difference between good and bad

23:22.760 --> 23:24.760
and that there's only good and or bad.

23:24.760 --> 23:26.760
And that those people,

23:26.760 --> 23:30.760
they are able to be hypnotized by the bad guys

23:30.760 --> 23:33.760
faster than they're able to be yelled at enough

23:33.760 --> 23:36.760
by the good guys to pick a side.

23:36.760 --> 23:39.760
I think that people who troll are speaking a language

23:39.760 --> 23:41.760
that they are used to speaking

23:41.760 --> 23:43.760
because they come from negative situations.

23:43.760 --> 23:46.760
They don't even know that they're necessarily being negative.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.760
I think that if you are a machine,

23:48.760 --> 23:50.760
maybe you want to operate efficiently

23:50.760 --> 23:53.760
and that fucking with these trolls is inefficient

23:53.760 --> 23:55.760
and takes the energy from your machine, you know?

23:55.760 --> 23:58.760
Because I think that you don't...

23:58.760 --> 24:01.760
I'm not trying to save souls necessarily.

24:01.760 --> 24:04.760
There's a bunch of people that are worth saving.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.760
So I take that level of compassion

24:06.760 --> 24:08.760
that you're expressing for these trolls

24:08.760 --> 24:10.760
and I give it to people who are actually fighting for good.

24:10.760 --> 24:11.760
Yeah, yeah.

24:11.760 --> 24:13.760
Well, in that example, then it's like you're...

24:13.760 --> 24:15.760
Yeah, so you're saying,

24:15.760 --> 24:17.760
I, Brandon Johnson, my philosophy

24:17.760 --> 24:19.760
represented like a 2D overhead map

24:19.760 --> 24:21.760
where there's like lichen over here

24:21.760 --> 24:23.760
and trolls over here and like...

24:23.760 --> 24:24.760
There's a bridge.

24:24.760 --> 24:25.760
Sunflowers over here.

24:25.760 --> 24:28.760
It's like you're in a really specific position

24:28.760 --> 24:30.760
where you put yourself

24:30.760 --> 24:33.760
where you're able to expose yourself

24:33.760 --> 24:35.760
to the ingredients you need

24:35.760 --> 24:38.760
and then you're pumping help

24:38.760 --> 24:41.760
to the people that you are saying deserve it,

24:41.760 --> 24:42.760
you know, that need it.

24:42.760 --> 24:44.760
They're like, oh, that person needs...

24:44.760 --> 24:45.760
Like me, for instance,

24:45.760 --> 24:47.760
if I don't have you in my life,

24:47.760 --> 24:49.760
my altitude would be lower.

24:49.760 --> 24:52.760
You pump me with levity chemicals.

24:52.760 --> 24:54.760
Trying to make me cry, Harmon.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.760
Trying to make me be a bitch up here.

24:56.760 --> 24:58.760
I see you. It's not gonna work.

24:58.760 --> 25:02.760
I mean, this epiphany is useless to you.

25:02.760 --> 25:03.760
I knew that coming in.

25:03.760 --> 25:05.760
This is the epiphany that I needed.

25:05.760 --> 25:06.760
No, no, no.

25:06.760 --> 25:08.760
I mean, I'm saying you're not somebody

25:08.760 --> 25:09.760
that's functioning at a low enough level

25:09.760 --> 25:11.760
to need this epiphany.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.760
The things that you've said in the past

25:13.760 --> 25:15.760
on the show when we've gotten to this area,

25:15.760 --> 25:19.760
I know you get this.

25:19.760 --> 25:22.760
I'm getting there now

25:22.760 --> 25:26.760
because I've been to...

25:26.760 --> 25:29.760
It's like, why am I letting so many things

25:29.760 --> 25:32.760
in an uncontrollable world control me?

25:32.760 --> 25:33.760
Well, this is the thing.

25:33.760 --> 25:34.760
I think as we get there,

25:34.760 --> 25:36.760
because we're always getting there,

25:36.760 --> 25:37.760
regardless of what level,

25:37.760 --> 25:39.760
one of the things that we pass on is the information.

25:39.760 --> 25:41.760
So I'll make this real quick,

25:41.760 --> 25:43.760
is that we've had to all mobilize,

25:43.760 --> 25:45.760
but the older people have had to talk to the younger people

25:45.760 --> 25:46.760
about how to do it

25:46.760 --> 25:48.760
because they've been fighting for 40, 50 years, right?

25:48.760 --> 25:50.760
So anybody who's 30 and under

25:50.760 --> 25:52.760
didn't know how to get together and rally

25:52.760 --> 25:53.760
and do all this shit.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.760
So I kind of feel like it's everybody's duty to say,

25:56.760 --> 25:58.760
this is the part of the journey that I would do like this,

25:58.760 --> 26:00.760
so that you can continue to fight,

26:00.760 --> 26:02.760
because you get this thing called oppression fatigue,

26:02.760 --> 26:05.760
where you're really tired of taking in all the bad shit

26:05.760 --> 26:07.760
and listening and trying to save puppies and people

26:07.760 --> 26:08.760
at the same time,

26:08.760 --> 26:10.760
and you get this roadmap that says,

26:10.760 --> 26:12.760
okay, so this is how you do this.

26:12.760 --> 26:14.760
And one of the ways that I always think you do it,

26:14.760 --> 26:17.760
just my two cents, having fought for a long time,

26:17.760 --> 26:20.760
is you really don't spend time on the people

26:20.760 --> 26:22.760
who have very clearly executed

26:22.760 --> 26:24.760
that they're not gonna come around,

26:24.760 --> 26:26.760
and you really spend more time on the people

26:26.760 --> 26:29.760
that are working hard in the streets to do what they do.

26:29.760 --> 26:32.760
It's like you take that compassion for a troll,

26:32.760 --> 26:34.760
like I said, and you give it to a mother of three

26:34.760 --> 26:36.760
who's taking a bus every day,

26:36.760 --> 26:38.760
and then you really do see it go farther.

26:38.760 --> 26:40.760
Like if I save a troll,

26:40.760 --> 26:41.760
I don't know that I'm helping anybody.

26:41.760 --> 26:43.760
That motherfucker might still be selfish.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.760
You aren't even engaging with the troll.

26:45.760 --> 26:47.760
You're engaging with the shark fin

26:47.760 --> 26:49.760
that the troll is putting above the water,

26:49.760 --> 26:51.760
and they're only putting it above the water

26:51.760 --> 26:54.760
because the rest of them is safe tucked away

26:54.760 --> 26:56.760
and is not being engaged with.

26:56.760 --> 27:01.760
That's what they come for is just to do this kind of shark thing.

27:01.760 --> 27:03.760
If we look at them as machines,

27:03.760 --> 27:05.760
because it'll make the metaphor easier for me,

27:05.760 --> 27:12.760
like the bad guys are one of their techniques

27:12.760 --> 27:15.760
is to just spray gas into the air

27:15.760 --> 27:18.760
where no interaction with them whatsoever,

27:18.760 --> 27:20.760
and no relationship with them,

27:20.760 --> 27:22.760
and no desire for them to be one thing or another.

27:22.760 --> 27:25.760
You're just breathing farts everywhere you go.

27:25.760 --> 27:28.760
You go to Albertsons and everyone's in a bad mood

27:28.760 --> 27:32.760
because just collectively everybody is convinced

27:32.760 --> 27:36.760
that everyone hates each other in general.

27:36.760 --> 27:42.760
I mean, this is just a function of the new thought wars

27:42.760 --> 27:44.760
that we're having, the meme wars.

27:44.760 --> 27:47.760
This is the former Soviet Union

27:47.760 --> 27:50.760
tested this and demonstrated it

27:50.760 --> 27:52.760
on all their little satellite states

27:52.760 --> 27:53.760
that tried to break ranks.

27:53.760 --> 27:57.760
We watched them hack and fucking troll them

27:57.760 --> 27:59.760
and say, you're having a civil war down the street.

27:59.760 --> 28:01.760
You're black people. Don't like your white people.

28:01.760 --> 28:02.760
It's happening down the street from you

28:02.760 --> 28:04.760
and the people in their homes going like,

28:04.760 --> 28:07.760
I don't hear any mortar fire.

28:07.760 --> 28:10.760
It's a massive confusion.

28:10.760 --> 28:12.760
Gas, it's just gas.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.760
You didn't have to ask for,

28:14.760 --> 28:17.760
and so I guess part of my epiphany is like,

28:17.760 --> 28:19.760
okay, so the air has changed.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.760
It's changed.

28:21.760 --> 28:25.760
So am I a person who's going to go buy a gun?

28:25.760 --> 28:27.760
Yep.

28:27.760 --> 28:29.760
But now that I'm thinking about it,

28:29.760 --> 28:34.760
that was my reaction to worrying that people were going to die,

28:34.760 --> 28:36.760
worrying that my family was going to be safe,

28:36.760 --> 28:38.760
worrying that I couldn't take care of my dogs,

28:38.760 --> 28:41.760
my housekeeper, my neighborhood, myself.

28:41.760 --> 28:44.760
I let that fear make me go put money

28:44.760 --> 28:47.760
into a mechanism of hatred and violence.

28:47.760 --> 28:52.760
And it's because my gauges and pistons and things

28:52.760 --> 28:55.760
were poorly designed for this change

28:55.760 --> 28:58.760
in chemical compounds in the atmosphere.

28:58.760 --> 29:01.760
Not poorly designed. They just needed upgrading.

29:01.760 --> 29:04.760
We need to add some filters.

29:04.760 --> 29:06.760
It feels like, I don't like the word filter

29:06.760 --> 29:09.760
because it's part of what the bad guys are doing.

29:09.760 --> 29:11.760
It's more like, take it all fucking in.

29:11.760 --> 29:13.760
Take it in.

29:13.760 --> 29:15.760
Michael, it's me, Kit.

29:15.760 --> 29:17.760
This is the Knight Rider reference.

29:17.760 --> 29:19.760
It was a show.

29:19.760 --> 29:21.760
Michael, Kit says,

29:21.760 --> 29:25.760
I'm detecting a change in the atmosphere.

29:25.760 --> 29:28.760
Take it in and fucking study it.

29:28.760 --> 29:31.760
Oh, there's a 10% increase in nitrogen

29:31.760 --> 29:33.760
and a decrease in oxygen.

29:33.760 --> 29:36.760
Okay, I'll work on a schematic for a part of my engine

29:36.760 --> 29:39.760
that will be nitrogen-powered

29:39.760 --> 29:41.760
that will generate more oxygen.

29:41.760 --> 29:46.760
I don't know what that just means.

29:46.760 --> 29:51.760
It starts with self-examination

29:51.760 --> 29:53.760
and then it's awareness.

29:53.760 --> 29:55.760
It's like, be aware of what's happening to you.

29:55.760 --> 29:57.760
It's time to check in with yourself

29:57.760 --> 29:59.760
about how you're feeling when you're feeling it.

29:59.760 --> 30:01.760
And don't be afraid to say,

30:01.760 --> 30:03.760
I feel sad. I feel like I want to give up.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.760
I feel so angry. I feel like I want to smash somebody's face in.

30:06.760 --> 30:09.760
But then you don't have to do any of that stuff to feel it.

30:09.760 --> 30:12.760
You just examine those feelings and then you have a board meeting

30:12.760 --> 30:14.760
inside your heart and go,

30:14.760 --> 30:18.760
okay, so we're taking stuff in through our intake valves

30:18.760 --> 30:22.760
that are making us violent and fearful and numb.

30:22.760 --> 30:28.760
Let's figure out, let's just be aware of that for a week.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.760
I wish there were somebody in the room

30:30.760 --> 30:32.760
who knew a little bit about what we were talking about.

30:32.760 --> 30:34.760
Do you think there is?

30:34.760 --> 30:38.760
Well, I think you're recommending a guest order swap.

30:38.760 --> 30:40.760
Let's get down with Ben Nelson.

30:40.760 --> 30:41.760
Let's see what's going on.

30:41.760 --> 30:44.760
All right, well, let's have our first guest come up, Ben Nelson.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.760
And I'll tell you what he's doing in a second.

30:46.760 --> 30:48.760
Oh, yeah.

30:54.760 --> 30:57.760
I guess the reason I thought Brandon was recommending a guest swap

30:57.760 --> 31:00.760
was because I don't know that Ben Nelson is...

31:00.760 --> 31:02.760
I only know what Ben Nelson's objective is

31:02.760 --> 31:05.760
in a very, very overview fashion.

31:05.760 --> 31:09.760
Your project is a thing called Project Minerva?

31:09.760 --> 31:11.760
The Minerva project, yeah.

31:11.760 --> 31:15.760
And give us the fucking Wikipedia paragraph that I read.

31:15.760 --> 31:17.760
Or I will.

31:17.760 --> 31:22.760
So Minerva is effectively a way to create a university,

31:22.760 --> 31:24.760
the way it's supposed to be.

31:24.760 --> 31:26.760
So basically, everything that universities say they do,

31:26.760 --> 31:28.760
teach people how to think critically,

31:28.760 --> 31:30.760
teach people how to problem solve,

31:30.760 --> 31:32.760
teach people how to understand other people,

31:32.760 --> 31:34.760
interact effectively, communicate effectively,

31:34.760 --> 31:36.760
communicate effectively.

31:36.760 --> 31:38.760
Turns out they don't do any of those things.

31:38.760 --> 31:42.760
The idea of like college, class shopping carts and stuff,

31:42.760 --> 31:44.760
isn't that like related to the decline?

31:44.760 --> 31:47.760
Because it's like not about a curriculum anymore,

31:47.760 --> 31:49.760
it's about selling these digital products

31:49.760 --> 31:52.760
that are actually supposedly pieces of an education?

31:52.760 --> 31:53.760
Yeah, exactly.

31:53.760 --> 31:55.760
Well, and you know, it's not even that anymore,

31:55.760 --> 31:58.760
because what they're really selling isn't education, right?

31:58.760 --> 32:01.760
I mean, if you think that universities are actually about education,

32:01.760 --> 32:03.760
if you think that people choose universities

32:03.760 --> 32:06.760
based on education, why are they spending so much money

32:06.760 --> 32:09.760
on lazy rivers and campuses and tanning beds and sports teams?

32:09.760 --> 32:11.760
They are, in fact, selling you first of all.

32:11.760 --> 32:13.760
They're approaching you as a family.

32:13.760 --> 32:14.760
They need the kid engaged.

32:14.760 --> 32:15.760
They need the kid to say,

32:15.760 --> 32:17.760
I want to go to that school because I might get late

32:17.760 --> 32:18.760
and I might have fun.

32:18.760 --> 32:19.760
I might not kill myself.

32:19.760 --> 32:22.760
But simultaneously, the more important part of the family,

32:22.760 --> 32:25.760
the parents need to go, oh, and after that, job placement.

32:25.760 --> 32:27.760
Yeah, job placement and...

32:27.760 --> 32:28.760
I think I was wrong.

32:28.760 --> 32:29.760
I think I was wrong from your reaction.

32:29.760 --> 32:30.760
Yeah, yeah.

32:30.760 --> 32:33.760
I think there's one other thing which is, you know,

32:33.760 --> 32:38.760
that colleges sell different packages to different students.

32:38.760 --> 32:40.760
And one of the things that colleges don't talk about,

32:40.760 --> 32:43.760
especially the Ivy League, the highly selective schools

32:43.760 --> 32:46.760
that claim that they're need-blind, claim that,

32:46.760 --> 32:48.760
oh, we don't really look at how wealthy you are,

32:48.760 --> 32:50.760
which is a total lie,

32:50.760 --> 32:52.760
they sell a very different package to rich kids

32:52.760 --> 32:54.760
than they do to everyone else.

32:54.760 --> 32:56.760
And the problem is rich kids, the top 1%,

32:56.760 --> 32:59.760
are 50% of the students going to these schools.

32:59.760 --> 33:00.760
50%.

33:00.760 --> 33:01.760
Right?

33:01.760 --> 33:03.760
And you can't do that if you really need blind.

33:03.760 --> 33:06.760
So for them, the pitch is very, very different.

33:06.760 --> 33:10.760
The pitch is, look at the theme park that you're going to be going to.

33:10.760 --> 33:12.760
And yeah, you know, you got courses and this and that,

33:12.760 --> 33:13.760
and you can choose whatever you want.

33:13.760 --> 33:16.760
But look, between you and me, slash, between everyone,

33:16.760 --> 33:19.760
once you get in, there are no Fs.

33:19.760 --> 33:20.760
You take whatever courses you want.

33:20.760 --> 33:22.760
There's no curriculum.

33:22.760 --> 33:23.760
You're guaranteed a diploma.

33:23.760 --> 33:25.760
Is that really a thing that's able to be transmitted,

33:25.760 --> 33:27.760
dog whistled, if you will, to families?

33:27.760 --> 33:33.760
Like, for instance, if someone was absolutely 100%

33:33.760 --> 33:35.760
observably dyslexic, which is not a crime,

33:35.760 --> 33:40.760
geniuses are dyslexic, but someone who has not treated it at all

33:40.760 --> 33:43.760
and is therefore functionally illiterate,

33:43.760 --> 33:46.760
cannot read a piece of paper publicly

33:46.760 --> 33:48.760
without fucking up the words,

33:48.760 --> 33:51.760
cannot form sentences without confusing us.

33:51.760 --> 33:55.760
And then, like, but I still want to be president.

33:55.760 --> 33:57.760
Like, there are, you're saying that,

33:57.760 --> 33:59.760
because this is what boggles my mind.

33:59.760 --> 34:01.760
I thought that there were, I mean, you said no Fs.

34:01.760 --> 34:06.760
That's actually somehow broadcast out to the families.

34:06.760 --> 34:08.760
Like, your kid won't get an F here.

34:08.760 --> 34:13.760
Yeah, so one shockingly underreported story

34:13.760 --> 34:16.760
from a couple of years ago was happening

34:16.760 --> 34:18.760
at the University of North Carolina.

34:18.760 --> 34:20.760
University of North Carolina,

34:20.760 --> 34:22.760
the oldest public university in the United States.

34:22.760 --> 34:24.760
Old Miss Daisy.

34:24.760 --> 34:26.760
Yeah, there you go.

34:26.760 --> 34:29.760
My alma mater.

34:29.760 --> 34:32.760
So University of North Carolina

34:32.760 --> 34:35.760
discovered shockingly three years ago

34:35.760 --> 34:39.760
to nobody's knowledge that for the previous 18 years

34:39.760 --> 34:41.760
they invented classes that didn't exist,

34:41.760 --> 34:43.760
put them in a course catalog,

34:43.760 --> 34:45.760
didn't bother assigning a room to them

34:45.760 --> 34:47.760
because they never met,

34:47.760 --> 34:51.760
and they were specifically in place

34:51.760 --> 34:54.760
to enable several of their athletes

34:54.760 --> 34:56.760
to get Phantom A's.

34:56.760 --> 34:58.760
Now when this was discovered,

34:58.760 --> 35:01.760
it was some secretary deep in the bowels

35:01.760 --> 35:04.760
of the organization that took all the blame,

35:04.760 --> 35:07.760
and everyone else, the head of the sports department,

35:07.760 --> 35:09.760
the provost, the president, no one knew.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.760
No one knew.

35:11.760 --> 35:14.760
And when it was investigated by the accreditors

35:14.760 --> 35:16.760
that people were supposed to actually be

35:16.760 --> 35:18.760
watchdogging these folks, they said,

35:18.760 --> 35:20.760
eh, you shouldn't do this again.

35:20.760 --> 35:22.760
They gave way fake degrees.

35:22.760 --> 35:24.760
Now people look at this and say, oh my god,

35:24.760 --> 35:26.760
that's like flat out fraud.

35:26.760 --> 35:27.760
And was that all athletes?

35:27.760 --> 35:29.760
Because I feel like, I saw Johnny B. Good

35:29.760 --> 35:31.760
with what's his name?

35:31.760 --> 35:33.760
From whatever?

35:33.760 --> 35:34.760
Anthony Michael Hall.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.760
Sorry, Anthony.

35:36.760 --> 35:38.760
You did great in season two.

35:41.760 --> 35:43.760
I feel like that's been like,

35:43.760 --> 35:45.760
since I was a kid,

35:45.760 --> 35:48.760
that has always been an athlete thing.

35:48.760 --> 35:50.760
It's much more pervasive.

35:50.760 --> 35:52.760
And that's the real problem.

35:52.760 --> 35:54.760
So the problem is that other universities

35:54.760 --> 35:56.760
who looked at UNC and just passed judgment

35:56.760 --> 35:59.760
and said, oh my god, the horror of that,

35:59.760 --> 36:01.760
what they've done internally,

36:01.760 --> 36:03.760
if you look at some of the most selective universities

36:03.760 --> 36:05.760
in the country, what they do,

36:05.760 --> 36:07.760
they just don't issue Fs to anybody.

36:07.760 --> 36:09.760
So I'll give you the story.

36:09.760 --> 36:11.760
A very, very, very selective university.

36:11.760 --> 36:13.760
You've all heard the name.

36:13.760 --> 36:16.760
I will protect the guilty by leaving out their name.

36:16.760 --> 36:19.760
I had a friend who was a teaching assistant there.

36:19.760 --> 36:20.760
Harvard.

36:20.760 --> 36:22.760
And I'm not going to say exactly where.

36:22.760 --> 36:24.760
It rhymes with Garver.

36:24.760 --> 36:26.760
It rhymes with Mayo.

36:26.760 --> 36:29.760
So the very short version is that

36:29.760 --> 36:31.760
their rule was that you basically,

36:31.760 --> 36:33.760
you only got grades based on tests,

36:33.760 --> 36:35.760
and if you missed two of the tests,

36:35.760 --> 36:36.760
it's 100% the final.

36:36.760 --> 36:39.760
And there was a girl who missed both the midterms

36:39.760 --> 36:42.760
and then skipped the final.

36:42.760 --> 36:44.760
They didn't take any of the tests.

36:44.760 --> 36:46.760
And when it was time to give her grades,

36:46.760 --> 36:48.760
the TA gave her an F.

36:48.760 --> 36:50.760
And the professor, when he looked at the F,

36:50.760 --> 36:52.760
he said, who got an F?

36:52.760 --> 36:54.760
He said, this girl didn't take a single test.

36:54.760 --> 36:57.760
And he said, yeah, that's a C plus.

36:57.760 --> 36:59.760
C plus.

36:59.760 --> 37:01.760
Now, is this a, so...

37:01.760 --> 37:05.760
That happened to me, I think, in astrology.

37:05.760 --> 37:08.760
I definitely got an F on a test,

37:08.760 --> 37:10.760
and I was like, C, and it was like, well,

37:10.760 --> 37:12.760
that didn't happen.

37:12.760 --> 37:15.760
Okay, so in that example,

37:15.760 --> 37:17.760
that's a real life example,

37:17.760 --> 37:19.760
but it's an anecdotal example.

37:19.760 --> 37:23.760
So now, just tell us, like, why?

37:23.760 --> 37:24.760
Who is that girl?

37:24.760 --> 37:26.760
Why is that professor doing that?

37:26.760 --> 37:28.760
Well, he did that because, actually,

37:28.760 --> 37:30.760
the rules of the university,

37:30.760 --> 37:32.760
so in elite institutions,

37:32.760 --> 37:34.760
when you want to have half of your students to be rich,

37:34.760 --> 37:37.760
you're going to have to make a lot of exceptions,

37:37.760 --> 37:39.760
even at the very best universities.

37:39.760 --> 37:40.760
That makes sense.

37:40.760 --> 37:42.760
Damn it, I went to fucking Marquette,

37:42.760 --> 37:43.760
and I had to drop out.

37:43.760 --> 37:45.760
I got an F in English because they busted my balls.

37:45.760 --> 37:46.760
You didn't go to a,

37:46.760 --> 37:48.760
you didn't go to a leading math university math.

37:48.760 --> 37:49.760
Every time I class, my grade went down a thing.

37:49.760 --> 37:51.760
I was like, this is harder than high school.

37:51.760 --> 37:53.760
So actually, that's the sad part,

37:53.760 --> 37:54.760
because the higher you climb,

37:54.760 --> 37:56.760
the more this grade inflation is occurring.

37:56.760 --> 37:59.760
Oh, my, always knew it,

37:59.760 --> 38:01.760
never heard it from a qualified individual.

38:01.760 --> 38:04.760
Now, does this have anything to do with loans?

38:04.760 --> 38:06.760
Well, not so much because these schools

38:06.760 --> 38:08.760
don't really give out loans, right?

38:08.760 --> 38:10.760
Because, and especially to the students that,

38:10.760 --> 38:13.760
you know, can afford to pay $70,000 a year.

38:13.760 --> 38:14.760
Who can do that?

38:14.760 --> 38:15.760
Half of their students.

38:15.760 --> 38:16.760
Wow.

38:16.760 --> 38:17.760
That's how bad it is.

38:17.760 --> 38:18.760
That's how bad it is.

38:18.760 --> 38:21.760
Fucking idiots, we've raised a nation of rich idiots.

38:21.760 --> 38:22.760
Wow.

38:22.760 --> 38:23.760
Privileged rich idiots.

38:23.760 --> 38:24.760
Privileged.

38:24.760 --> 38:26.760
And not necessarily smarter or better equipped

38:26.760 --> 38:27.760
to go into the workforce?

38:27.760 --> 38:28.760
No, not at all.

38:28.760 --> 38:32.760
I mean, in fact, if you look at how employers rate

38:32.760 --> 38:34.760
the quality of graduates from universities,

38:34.760 --> 38:36.760
it's abysmal, abysmal.

38:36.760 --> 38:39.760
96% of chief academic officers at universities

38:39.760 --> 38:41.760
say that they prepare their students well for the job.

38:41.760 --> 38:42.760
Right?

38:42.760 --> 38:43.760
The job force.

38:43.760 --> 38:44.760
This is what parents really care about.

38:44.760 --> 38:46.760
11% of employers agree.

38:46.760 --> 38:47.760
Right.

38:47.760 --> 38:48.760
11%.

38:48.760 --> 38:49.760
Yeah, I mean, I think that's been,

38:49.760 --> 38:51.760
that's been like the last 10 years or so.

38:51.760 --> 38:53.760
It's like that bubble burst where somebody bothered,

38:53.760 --> 38:55.760
as with Enron, somebody finally said,

38:55.760 --> 38:57.760
come on, we need to see a ledger.

38:57.760 --> 38:58.760
Right.

38:58.760 --> 38:59.760
And then after a lot of hemming and high,

38:59.760 --> 39:02.760
it's like, yeah, no, no one gets a job that went to college.

39:02.760 --> 39:05.760
Basically, you, but however,

39:05.760 --> 39:07.760
there's a meta channel to that,

39:07.760 --> 39:10.760
which is if you can afford to send your kid to Harvard,

39:10.760 --> 39:11.760
correct me if I'm wrong,

39:11.760 --> 39:13.760
I'm going to get a little classist here

39:13.760 --> 39:15.760
in the opposite direction.

39:15.760 --> 39:18.760
If you can afford to send your kid to Harvard,

39:18.760 --> 39:23.760
you, and you don't send your kid to Harvard,

39:23.760 --> 39:26.760
you're kneecapping your kid

39:26.760 --> 39:28.760
because your kid's a member of the 1%.

39:28.760 --> 39:30.760
He's garbage larva.

39:30.760 --> 39:34.760
He's blue blood, Mayflower, fucking, parasitic.

39:34.760 --> 39:36.760
Parasitic DNA.

39:36.760 --> 39:39.760
And he needs his Harvard UV ray

39:39.760 --> 39:41.760
that is tanning booth to pass through

39:41.760 --> 39:44.760
so he can be a baked in Harvard fucking moron

39:44.760 --> 39:47.760
and go get his oil wells and his fucking fucking shit back.

39:47.760 --> 39:49.760
So I got good news for you.

39:49.760 --> 39:50.760
I got good news for you.

39:50.760 --> 39:51.760
That's a myth.

39:51.760 --> 39:52.760
Okay.

39:52.760 --> 39:54.760
So they actually, somebody did that study.

39:54.760 --> 39:57.760
They looked at people accepted by Harvard,

39:57.760 --> 39:59.760
all the people accepted by Harvard,

39:59.760 --> 40:01.760
and they looked at the people who chose not to go

40:01.760 --> 40:03.760
and compared them to people who went.

40:03.760 --> 40:06.760
Turns out that if you are from the top four

40:06.760 --> 40:09.760
of the five socioeconomic strata, right,

40:09.760 --> 40:11.760
so basically the top 80%, right,

40:11.760 --> 40:14.760
it makes zero difference whether or not

40:14.760 --> 40:16.760
you chose to go to Harvard or to state school.

40:16.760 --> 40:18.760
Where it does help, and it does help,

40:18.760 --> 40:21.760
is if you come from the 20% poorest households in the country,

40:21.760 --> 40:24.760
which make up a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction

40:24.760 --> 40:26.760
of Harvard students,

40:26.760 --> 40:29.760
those students actually do have some better

40:29.760 --> 40:31.760
future earnings, et cetera,

40:31.760 --> 40:33.760
if they went to Harvard path versus not,

40:33.760 --> 40:34.760
but it's not that much.

40:34.760 --> 40:35.760
Yeah.

40:35.760 --> 40:37.760
It's usually because they started out at zero.

40:37.760 --> 40:38.760
Correct.

40:38.760 --> 40:40.760
Because they started with a huge, huge, huge amount

40:40.760 --> 40:42.760
of downside, and they do meet some people

40:42.760 --> 40:43.760
that will help them out.

40:43.760 --> 40:44.760
So that does help.

40:44.760 --> 40:46.760
But guess what?

40:46.760 --> 40:49.760
What makes you successful in life?

40:49.760 --> 40:51.760
And this is actually a damnation of universities

40:51.760 --> 40:53.760
because I don't think it should be this way.

40:53.760 --> 40:55.760
But what makes you successful in life is just

40:55.760 --> 40:56.760
how good you are, right?

40:56.760 --> 40:58.760
But what universities should be doing

40:58.760 --> 41:00.760
is they should actually be adding value.

41:00.760 --> 41:02.760
They should actually be teaching to do those things.

41:02.760 --> 41:03.760
There should be places where you go and you go,

41:03.760 --> 41:05.760
I don't know, I play a little bit of piano,

41:05.760 --> 41:07.760
but I've always liked English class.

41:07.760 --> 41:09.760
I came here to be a journalist major,

41:09.760 --> 41:11.760
and they go, wrong, you're Billy Joel.

41:11.760 --> 41:13.760
You know, and they funnel, and they make you into Billy Joel.

41:13.760 --> 41:15.760
That's what any school should be.

41:15.760 --> 41:17.760
That's what any household should be.

41:17.760 --> 41:19.760
Your kids should be born with proclivities

41:19.760 --> 41:21.760
that are natural, interests that are natural.

41:21.760 --> 41:23.760
Sometimes those are contrasting.

41:23.760 --> 41:25.760
You put a piano in front of your kid.

41:25.760 --> 41:27.760
You put a football in front of your kid.

41:27.760 --> 41:31.760
You put a lockpick in front of your kid.

41:31.760 --> 41:33.760
It's just in D&D terms.

41:33.760 --> 41:35.760
Maybe they're going to be an expert thief.

41:35.760 --> 41:38.760
And they respond to stuff, and they don't respond to stuff.

41:38.760 --> 41:40.760
You know, and you break all, by the way,

41:40.760 --> 41:41.760
as a subset of that.

41:41.760 --> 41:43.760
You know, you break all gender norms and all that stuff

41:43.760 --> 41:46.760
because regardless of what we think about this stuff anyways.

41:46.760 --> 41:48.760
But who cares?

41:48.760 --> 41:51.760
I'm patting myself on the back for what am I barfing you at?

41:51.760 --> 41:53.760
I'm very curious about one thing,

41:53.760 --> 41:55.760
because I just want to make sure I got the picture here.

41:55.760 --> 41:57.760
Because that girl in that example,

41:57.760 --> 42:00.760
when that professor says that F is actually a C+,

42:00.760 --> 42:02.760
is he saying that because of that girl's background?

42:02.760 --> 42:04.760
No, he's saying it because it doesn't.

42:04.760 --> 42:07.760
So the poor kids are benefiting from the no F process.

42:07.760 --> 42:08.760
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:08.760 --> 42:09.760
Everybody goes to C school.

42:09.760 --> 42:10.760
Because they're customers.

42:10.760 --> 42:11.760
They're customers, right?

42:11.760 --> 42:12.760
So nobody wants to get on a cold happy meal.

42:12.760 --> 42:15.760
Well, the teachers, they get rated on how good their students do.

42:15.760 --> 42:16.760
Bingo.

42:16.760 --> 42:17.760
Right?

42:17.760 --> 42:18.760
And so in order to give the girl an F,

42:18.760 --> 42:19.760
there is a way to give her an F.

42:19.760 --> 42:21.760
After she missed the first midterm,

42:21.760 --> 42:24.760
they have to call her into a teacher-student conference

42:24.760 --> 42:27.760
and have a written down corrective action plan.

42:27.760 --> 42:30.760
Even though, in the rules, she could have missed the midterm.

42:30.760 --> 42:32.760
Then after she missed the second midterm,

42:32.760 --> 42:35.760
they had to bring her back in and have her sign

42:35.760 --> 42:37.760
on a different corrective action plan,

42:37.760 --> 42:38.760
because the first one clearly didn't work.

42:38.760 --> 42:42.760
And then, and only then, if she then misses the final,

42:42.760 --> 42:45.760
just doesn't show up, then they can give her an F.

42:45.760 --> 42:47.760
People don't bother doing it.

42:47.760 --> 42:48.760
Wow.

42:48.760 --> 42:49.760
Right?

42:49.760 --> 42:51.760
And so, but there's one other thing that the university should be doing,

42:51.760 --> 42:53.760
which is what you were talking about at the beginning of the show,

42:53.760 --> 42:55.760
which is those filters, right?

42:55.760 --> 43:00.760
The ways to train your mind to deal with what comes at you.

43:00.760 --> 43:02.760
That is the job of universities.

43:02.760 --> 43:05.760
That is the definition of higher education.

43:05.760 --> 43:07.760
Universities don't do that.

43:07.760 --> 43:10.760
And instead, we're giving C pluses to absolute morons

43:10.760 --> 43:12.760
that can go on to become legislators.

43:12.760 --> 43:15.760
And we're giving also, look, I'll say it,

43:15.760 --> 43:17.760
I'm going to sound like one of the bad guys.

43:17.760 --> 43:19.760
We're giving safe spaces to kids that complain that catcher and their ride

43:19.760 --> 43:22.760
made them uncomfortable because it has the word fag in it.

43:22.760 --> 43:23.760
Absolutely.

43:23.760 --> 43:25.760
Well, this seems all pretty terrible.

43:25.760 --> 43:29.760
I wish there was someone here that had a plan

43:29.760 --> 43:31.760
because we're good at complaining,

43:31.760 --> 43:34.760
but if only there was someone, help me.

43:34.760 --> 43:36.760
There's got to be a better way.

43:36.760 --> 43:41.760
I want to know how we got here and where we're going.

43:41.760 --> 43:43.760
So where are we going?

43:43.760 --> 43:46.760
So we believe that we've sketched out something that works.

43:46.760 --> 43:48.760
You and your improv troupe.

43:48.760 --> 43:49.760
Exactly.

43:49.760 --> 43:51.760
You know, we have a whole group of people though.

43:51.760 --> 43:53.760
So we actually started a new university.

43:53.760 --> 43:56.760
We started a university program that's actually part of the KGI,

43:56.760 --> 44:00.760
which is one of the Claremont colleges here in Southern California.

44:00.760 --> 44:07.760
And our students go through a completely reimagined four-year

44:07.760 --> 44:08.760
undergraduate curriculum.

44:08.760 --> 44:09.760
It's accredited.

44:09.760 --> 44:12.760
It's very, very selective, very hard to get in.

44:12.760 --> 44:16.760
But unlike the traditional profile of other universities,

44:16.760 --> 44:18.760
we just choose not to discriminate.

44:18.760 --> 44:20.760
It was an odd choice.

44:20.760 --> 44:26.760
And so we charge across the board.

44:26.760 --> 44:29.760
You don't discriminate among the different kinds of black people

44:29.760 --> 44:31.760
for the black people program.

44:31.760 --> 44:33.760
There's no black person program.

44:33.760 --> 44:35.760
Well, how do you tell the black students from the...

44:35.760 --> 44:36.760
We don't.

44:36.760 --> 44:39.760
So here's the crazy thing about what we do.

44:39.760 --> 44:41.760
We have no quotas.

44:41.760 --> 44:42.760
We have no buckets.

44:42.760 --> 44:43.760
We have no slots.

44:43.760 --> 44:46.760
We don't say, oh, you have to compete for this position.

44:46.760 --> 44:49.760
If you qualify for a program, it's very hard to qualify.

44:49.760 --> 44:52.760
But if you qualify, you get in.

44:52.760 --> 44:55.760
And we charge for tuition fees, room and board,

44:55.760 --> 44:57.760
the whole thing less than $30,000 a year.

44:57.760 --> 44:59.760
So less than half of what the Ivy League charge,

44:59.760 --> 45:02.760
which is $60,000 to $70,000 now.

45:02.760 --> 45:04.760
And despite the fact that we charge less than half,

45:04.760 --> 45:06.760
80% of our students can't afford it.

45:06.760 --> 45:08.760
What's a state school cost?

45:08.760 --> 45:09.760
About the same.

45:09.760 --> 45:11.760
And that's subsidized by the government.

45:11.760 --> 45:12.760
We're not.

45:12.760 --> 45:13.760
I'm sorry.

45:13.760 --> 45:14.760
I'm going to pick my nose right on camera

45:14.760 --> 45:15.760
because there's a trapdoor bugger.

45:15.760 --> 45:18.760
And look, I can either live with it or I can fucking confront it.

45:18.760 --> 45:19.760
There's something about it.

45:19.760 --> 45:20.760
Now it's gone.

45:20.760 --> 45:23.760
I'll let Reddit show that in replay.

45:23.760 --> 45:24.760
I picked my nose.

45:24.760 --> 45:25.760
I do it with my thumb.

45:25.760 --> 45:30.760
That's why my nose looks like Harrison Ford's at 44.

45:30.760 --> 45:35.760
Now, would a guy like me make it into your program?

45:35.760 --> 45:40.760
So I want to try to, I'm going to try to recap what you said

45:40.760 --> 45:41.760
so that we can try.

45:41.760 --> 45:43.760
Because I'm dumb and drunk.

45:43.760 --> 45:48.760
You're saying that you, because first of all,

45:48.760 --> 45:51.760
you haven't built a brick and mortar building yet.

45:51.760 --> 45:53.760
You're saying you're using existing universities,

45:53.760 --> 45:55.760
but you started a program.

45:55.760 --> 45:56.760
We started an undergraduate program.

45:56.760 --> 45:57.760
Yeah.

45:57.760 --> 45:59.760
And what we do is rather than using kind of a campus-based

45:59.760 --> 46:01.760
philosophy, we use a city-based philosophy.

46:01.760 --> 46:03.760
So our students, they actually spend their first year,

46:03.760 --> 46:05.760
not in Southern California, but in San Francisco.

46:05.760 --> 46:07.760
And they live in a residence hall in the middle of the city.

46:07.760 --> 46:10.760
And then the next three years, they travel as a group.

46:10.760 --> 46:12.760
They live in six different countries all over the world.

46:12.760 --> 46:13.760
What?

46:13.760 --> 46:14.760
So they go from San Francisco.

46:14.760 --> 46:17.760
They go to Seoul, Hyderabad, Berlin, Buenos Aires,

46:17.760 --> 46:18.760
London, Taipei.

46:18.760 --> 46:20.760
And they come back to San Francisco to graduate.

46:20.760 --> 46:21.760
Are you a Bond villain?

46:21.760 --> 46:22.760
Well, I'm not.

46:22.760 --> 46:25.760
But perhaps our students will be Bond heroes.

46:25.760 --> 46:27.760
Finally, they're placed in a pit in a broken pool queues

46:27.760 --> 46:29.760
between them.

46:29.760 --> 46:32.760
The one super student that emerges from that pit

46:32.760 --> 46:35.760
goes to the moon.

46:35.760 --> 46:37.760
Actually, it's to go to Harvard.

46:37.760 --> 46:41.760
No, but I just, please forgive me.

46:41.760 --> 46:44.760
So you're saying it's a program.

46:44.760 --> 46:45.760
It's not a school.

46:45.760 --> 46:47.760
It's not a geographically located thing.

46:47.760 --> 46:48.760
It's a program.

46:48.760 --> 46:49.760
It's geographically located.

46:49.760 --> 46:50.760
It's just not located on a campus.

46:50.760 --> 46:52.760
It's located in the cities.

46:52.760 --> 46:53.760
OK.

46:53.760 --> 46:57.760
But everywhere these people are going, the faculty,

46:57.760 --> 47:01.760
you're not invading existing schools and saying,

47:01.760 --> 47:03.760
let's piggyback on your infrastructure.

47:03.760 --> 47:05.760
You have your own teachers, your own curriculum.

47:05.760 --> 47:07.760
We have our own professors, our own curriculum.

47:07.760 --> 47:09.760
And the curriculum, the way it's structured is,

47:09.760 --> 47:12.760
in the first year, they spend the entire first year

47:12.760 --> 47:14.760
training their minds.

47:14.760 --> 47:16.760
They learn four systems of thought.

47:16.760 --> 47:18.760
We're talking about complex systems, basically.

47:18.760 --> 47:21.760
We're talking about, at the beginning, how we are all

47:21.760 --> 47:22.760
complex systems, right?

47:22.760 --> 47:25.760
Anywhere from people to animals to...

47:25.760 --> 47:27.760
The first year is how to think.

47:27.760 --> 47:29.760
The first year is systems of thinking, right?

47:29.760 --> 47:32.760
So how to use logic and reasoning and statistics.

47:32.760 --> 47:34.760
How to look at the world around you

47:34.760 --> 47:37.760
and understand how things work when data isn't clear.

47:37.760 --> 47:39.760
How to think about unintended consequences

47:39.760 --> 47:40.760
and effective interactions.

47:40.760 --> 47:42.760
How to think about how to communicate effectively.

47:42.760 --> 47:44.760
So one of the things that you were talking about

47:44.760 --> 47:46.760
is one of the things we actually teach.

47:46.760 --> 47:47.760
It's called audience, right?

47:47.760 --> 47:50.760
Hashtag audience, which is a habit of mind

47:50.760 --> 47:53.760
to understand who it is that you're talking to

47:53.760 --> 47:55.760
before you start talking, right?

47:55.760 --> 47:58.760
To actually understand how are they going to receive

47:58.760 --> 47:59.760
what I'm saying?

47:59.760 --> 48:02.760
And by the way, there's the corollary to that,

48:02.760 --> 48:05.760
which is, why are they saying those things to me?

48:05.760 --> 48:07.760
What are they actually...

48:07.760 --> 48:09.760
What is the question behind the question

48:09.760 --> 48:11.760
or the statement behind the statement?

48:11.760 --> 48:12.760
So that's like communication theory.

48:12.760 --> 48:13.760
So that's part of...

48:13.760 --> 48:14.760
Effective communication.

48:14.760 --> 48:16.760
Well, that seems like that's compatible

48:16.760 --> 48:19.760
with modern problematization.

48:19.760 --> 48:20.760
Yes.

48:20.760 --> 48:25.760
To pronounce it in the original French.

48:25.760 --> 48:28.760
Problematization, which can be...

48:28.760 --> 48:31.760
Which I heard a student explaining to me about

48:31.760 --> 48:33.760
that you're picking apart things and then I looked it up.

48:33.760 --> 48:34.760
Like, what is this?

48:34.760 --> 48:36.760
It's like a sort of digestive process

48:36.760 --> 48:37.760
of any piece of information.

48:37.760 --> 48:39.760
You can just look around your world

48:39.760 --> 48:40.760
and start corroding it.

48:40.760 --> 48:41.760
Correct.

48:41.760 --> 48:42.760
Which...

48:42.760 --> 48:43.760
And you don't like the word filter, which is right.

48:43.760 --> 48:45.760
I think about it as lenses.

48:45.760 --> 48:47.760
We give you a hundred different lenses

48:47.760 --> 48:49.760
to sharpen your view of the world.

48:49.760 --> 48:51.760
Don't lens this filter light?

48:51.760 --> 48:52.760
Okay.

48:52.760 --> 48:53.760
That's true.

48:53.760 --> 48:55.760
They focus, they focus, they focus light, right?

48:55.760 --> 48:56.760
Okay, I'm just saying.

48:56.760 --> 48:58.760
But it is fantastic to...

48:58.760 --> 49:01.760
Yeah, because I feel like if there's one thing

49:01.760 --> 49:03.760
off of it, I'm Generation X.

49:03.760 --> 49:05.760
I'm the David Cross, Jeanine Garofalo,

49:05.760 --> 49:07.760
Brandon Johnson generation.

49:07.760 --> 49:14.760
I floated my boat for the longest time.

49:14.760 --> 49:15.760
Brandon and I have talked about this,

49:15.760 --> 49:17.760
how our generation kind of...

49:17.760 --> 49:22.760
We weren't like millennials, however, we were...

49:22.760 --> 49:24.760
You know, lazy is lazy.

49:24.760 --> 49:26.760
Like, we learned how to be anti-corporate

49:26.760 --> 49:27.760
when we were 25.

49:27.760 --> 49:31.760
We learned how Jamba Juice is just fucking bullshit.

49:31.760 --> 49:32.760
It's all sugar.

49:32.760 --> 49:34.760
Everything with a little C in a circle

49:34.760 --> 49:35.760
or a TM on it is bullshit.

49:35.760 --> 49:36.760
And everything in the corporate is bullshit.

49:36.760 --> 49:38.760
Money is bullshit and all this stuff.

49:38.760 --> 49:39.760
We didn't...

49:39.760 --> 49:41.760
And then the millennials started rubbing us

49:41.760 --> 49:42.760
the wrong way because they're like,

49:42.760 --> 49:43.760
I don't know, I love recycling.

49:43.760 --> 49:44.760
But if the president tells me to do it,

49:44.760 --> 49:45.760
my mom's my best friend.

49:45.760 --> 49:47.760
And they're like, these people are going to be fascists

49:47.760 --> 49:49.760
if they intersect with the right president.

49:49.760 --> 49:51.760
And I am on record in this podcast of saying that

49:51.760 --> 49:53.760
if you can bear it, scroll back through this

49:53.760 --> 49:54.760
horrible fucking podcast.

49:54.760 --> 49:56.760
However, I also went and bought a gun

49:56.760 --> 49:57.760
and some things didn't go my way.

49:57.760 --> 49:59.760
I've also said horrible things and made rape jokes.

49:59.760 --> 50:00.760
All right.

50:00.760 --> 50:01.760
So don't go back.

50:01.760 --> 50:02.760
Don't go back.

50:05.760 --> 50:07.760
The place where we intersect is I think

50:07.760 --> 50:12.760
like our generation, my generation is like...

50:12.760 --> 50:15.760
That's like a little bit of paprika, a little pepper.

50:15.760 --> 50:17.760
It's like, could we please just change lenses

50:17.760 --> 50:19.760
constantly and always look at everything

50:19.760 --> 50:20.760
and see who's gaining and who's losing

50:20.760 --> 50:22.760
and question everything and kind of like

50:22.760 --> 50:24.760
be jaded about it a little bit?

50:24.760 --> 50:25.760
Absolutely.

50:25.760 --> 50:26.760
But you don't need to be jaded.

50:26.760 --> 50:28.760
You just have to actually just look at it.

50:28.760 --> 50:30.760
You actually have to get down to the core

50:30.760 --> 50:32.760
of what the issues are, right?

50:32.760 --> 50:34.760
And I think that's actually where our generation...

50:34.760 --> 50:35.760
We were primed.

50:35.760 --> 50:37.760
I think probably this is why, you know,

50:37.760 --> 50:39.760
I came up with this concept, which is

50:39.760 --> 50:41.760
when I went to college, that's what I was primed for.

50:41.760 --> 50:43.760
I was primed for exactly that.

50:43.760 --> 50:44.760
I wanted to go to college.

50:44.760 --> 50:46.760
Well, in movies and TV, that's what it always is.

50:46.760 --> 50:48.760
It's always like these crazy thematic

50:48.760 --> 50:50.760
John Hausmann's at the front going,

50:50.760 --> 50:53.760
I expect you to work so much harder than you ever...

50:53.760 --> 50:55.760
And then the people turn their papers in

50:55.760 --> 50:57.760
and it's like, look, I'm sorry,

50:57.760 --> 50:59.760
professor, I just didn't agree with you on this one.

50:59.760 --> 51:02.760
And that's why you call me.

51:02.760 --> 51:06.760
Everything like colleges as depicted in our culture

51:06.760 --> 51:08.760
are these places where you're fucking...

51:08.760 --> 51:11.760
The bullshit starts off campus.

51:11.760 --> 51:12.760
That's why I can't state.

51:12.760 --> 51:13.760
That's why they...

51:13.760 --> 51:15.760
That's why I can't state tip top.

51:15.760 --> 51:18.760
It's like they fucking invaded the goddamn

51:18.760 --> 51:21.760
Pentagon of culture.

51:21.760 --> 51:22.760
Our children, our youth.

51:22.760 --> 51:24.760
You're allowed to protest.

51:24.760 --> 51:25.760
You're allowed to...

51:25.760 --> 51:27.760
They sent the National Guard onto a campus

51:27.760 --> 51:29.760
and someone got shot and it was like,

51:29.760 --> 51:30.760
this is over now.

51:30.760 --> 51:31.760
You fucked up.

51:31.760 --> 51:33.760
Just as when a journalist getting shot

51:33.760 --> 51:35.760
in the roaring 20s is the reason organized crime

51:35.760 --> 51:36.760
got shut the fuck down.

51:36.760 --> 51:37.760
You shut a journalist.

51:37.760 --> 51:39.760
It was like, always there was this respect

51:39.760 --> 51:43.760
for these things that should have kept me safe.

51:43.760 --> 51:47.760
This is a heavy podcast.

51:47.760 --> 51:48.760
No, it's a selfish one.

51:48.760 --> 51:51.760
It's where I come to just plea with the cameras.

51:51.760 --> 51:53.760
I go, can you hear the shelling?

51:53.760 --> 51:55.760
Someone send me blood.

51:55.760 --> 51:58.760
Please, someone send us blood.

51:58.760 --> 51:59.760
What are you, Dan?

51:59.760 --> 52:00.760
I'm an O-positive.

52:00.760 --> 52:01.760
You know what?

52:01.760 --> 52:04.760
I think you should be a little more O-negative sometimes.

52:04.760 --> 52:08.760
That's the problem with your generation.

52:08.760 --> 52:12.760
So, okay.

52:12.760 --> 52:14.760
I want to continue to talk to you.

52:14.760 --> 52:15.760
We have a full show tonight.

52:15.760 --> 52:16.760
We've also got...

52:16.760 --> 52:17.760
I think somebody that's going to blend very well with you,

52:17.760 --> 52:18.760
I think.

52:18.760 --> 52:19.760
That or we're going to get...

52:19.760 --> 52:20.760
The tanks are going to roll through the building

52:20.760 --> 52:22.760
once the two of you are together.

52:22.760 --> 52:26.760
But I just want to...

52:26.760 --> 52:28.760
Just a little personal background.

52:28.760 --> 52:29.760
Come on, Ben Nelson.

52:29.760 --> 52:31.760
Stop avoiding intimacy.

52:31.760 --> 52:32.760
Who are you?

52:32.760 --> 52:35.760
How'd you end up on this warpath?

52:35.760 --> 52:37.760
How'd I end up on the warpath?

52:37.760 --> 52:38.760
It was pretty simple.

52:38.760 --> 52:42.760
I went to college, idealistic, 18-year-old,

52:42.760 --> 52:45.760
assuming John Hausman will be teaching me all of my classes.

52:45.760 --> 52:49.760
But also that you'd be allowed to be John Kuzak in a sure thing.

52:49.760 --> 52:51.760
That was the other half of the college dream,

52:51.760 --> 52:53.760
was that you could go,

52:53.760 --> 52:54.760
you know what?

52:54.760 --> 52:56.760
I'm a fucking whiz English major.

52:56.760 --> 52:59.760
I'm going to skip the midterm,

52:59.760 --> 53:01.760
but I'm going to make it up on the...

53:01.760 --> 53:03.760
You know, it's like you cut classes.

53:03.760 --> 53:04.760
That was part...

53:04.760 --> 53:05.760
You're grown up now.

53:05.760 --> 53:06.760
You're not a high school student anymore.

53:06.760 --> 53:07.760
You're an adult.

53:07.760 --> 53:08.760
You make your choices.

53:08.760 --> 53:11.760
And a lot of college dramas would feature that moment

53:11.760 --> 53:13.760
where the kid would have to come to terms.

53:13.760 --> 53:14.760
It's like, yeah, but you're scheduling your time

53:14.760 --> 53:16.760
and you're picking your priorities.

53:16.760 --> 53:19.760
Yeah, and in fact, I found that I could schedule my time completely

53:19.760 --> 53:20.760
because I never needed to go to class

53:20.760 --> 53:21.760
because the classes were...

53:21.760 --> 53:23.760
I mean, they just read books out loud to you

53:23.760 --> 53:24.760
and I could read them on my own.

53:24.760 --> 53:27.760
Yeah, that's what my college experience was like.

53:27.760 --> 53:28.760
Yeah, and I didn't like that.

53:28.760 --> 53:30.760
I actually wanted to learn something.

53:30.760 --> 53:31.760
I could just buy a textbook.

53:31.760 --> 53:32.760
Exactly, right?

53:32.760 --> 53:34.760
And so I thought that, you know,

53:34.760 --> 53:39.760
choice in college should be made when I was ready for it.

53:39.760 --> 53:40.760
Right?

53:40.760 --> 53:42.760
I'm actually not a big fan of choice right at the beginning

53:42.760 --> 53:44.760
because I'm still a kid.

53:44.760 --> 53:47.760
I have no idea what I'm doing at that point.

53:47.760 --> 53:49.760
High school's over, you piece of shit.

53:49.760 --> 53:54.760
And part of that should be like the mama cat

53:54.760 --> 53:57.760
drops a crippled mouse, like not a dead one.

53:57.760 --> 53:58.760
Yeah.

53:58.760 --> 54:03.760
Meaning you can go do stand-up Wednesday nights.

54:03.760 --> 54:04.760
Right, right.

54:04.760 --> 54:07.760
And then your grade's going to lower it down just a little bit.

54:07.760 --> 54:08.760
You're going to get enough free agency.

54:08.760 --> 54:10.760
You can make those choices, exactly.

54:10.760 --> 54:15.760
I'm just saying I should have had better grades at Marquette

54:15.760 --> 54:17.760
if there's one thing we can establish.

54:17.760 --> 54:19.760
I should not have gotten an F in English.

54:19.760 --> 54:20.760
It is.

54:20.760 --> 54:21.760
I've been walking around that.

54:21.760 --> 54:25.760
I need to go to Gimlet Media with my heavyweight episode

54:25.760 --> 54:28.760
about how I need to confront my college TA.

54:28.760 --> 54:30.760
Why did you get an F?

54:30.760 --> 54:31.760
It was a systemic thing.

54:31.760 --> 54:33.760
Were you not taking the drafts?

54:33.760 --> 54:36.760
Literally, they tell you your grade drops a grade level

54:36.760 --> 54:38.760
if you skip a class.

54:38.760 --> 54:39.760
Okay.

54:39.760 --> 54:40.760
I'm dead.

54:40.760 --> 54:41.760
Wow.

54:41.760 --> 54:42.760
That's amazing.

54:42.760 --> 54:43.760
I never had that.

54:43.760 --> 54:44.760
So it wasn't about skill.

54:44.760 --> 54:47.760
They were also starting a new thing called cooperative education,

54:47.760 --> 54:49.760
which is where the class shows up.

54:49.760 --> 54:50.760
There's a TA.

54:50.760 --> 54:52.760
The TA breaks everybody into groups.

54:52.760 --> 54:53.760
Boom.

54:53.760 --> 54:54.760
And the group gets a grade.

54:54.760 --> 54:55.760
Shares a grade.

54:55.760 --> 54:56.760
Oh, yeah.

54:56.760 --> 54:57.760
Right, sure.

54:57.760 --> 55:00.760
So that was very offensive to my young, like,

55:00.760 --> 55:05.760
if you had transplanted me into today, like I was, you know,

55:05.760 --> 55:09.760
I was at risk of alt-right indoctrination.

55:09.760 --> 55:11.760
But see, here's what I would make the argument.

55:11.760 --> 55:14.760
I would make the argument that if your university did its job,

55:14.760 --> 55:16.760
you wouldn't have missed any classes.

55:16.760 --> 55:19.760
You would have gone to class because it would have actually,

55:19.760 --> 55:21.760
you would have seen your mind develop.

55:21.760 --> 55:25.760
You'd say, oh my God, I am smarter this week than I was last week,

55:25.760 --> 55:27.760
and I'm not going to miss out on that opportunity.

55:27.760 --> 55:29.760
And sometimes you do have to put in some structure.

55:29.760 --> 55:31.760
The problem is when you put in structure,

55:31.760 --> 55:33.760
and then the university doesn't deliver.

55:33.760 --> 55:35.760
You got to show up, and then you show up, and you're like,

55:35.760 --> 55:36.760
why don't I show up?

55:36.760 --> 55:38.760
You show up, and then your TA is reading Ray Bradbury

55:38.760 --> 55:42.760
and texting while you sit in a circle of desks

55:42.760 --> 55:44.760
with all your fellow freshmen going,

55:44.760 --> 55:45.760
I don't know what you want to do.

55:45.760 --> 55:46.760
I don't know what you want to do.

55:46.760 --> 55:47.760
Exactly.

55:47.760 --> 55:48.760
Exactly.

55:48.760 --> 55:49.760
What if we wrote a paper about licorice?

55:49.760 --> 55:53.760
Oh, so, OK.

55:53.760 --> 55:57.760
So not to avoid intimacy, I came up with this idea

55:57.760 --> 55:59.760
when I was a freshman, basically how to fix the curriculum

55:59.760 --> 56:01.760
of my university.

56:01.760 --> 56:04.760
And I spent four years trying to argue for people to listen.

56:04.760 --> 56:05.760
Nobody cared.

56:05.760 --> 56:07.760
Oh, they must have loved you.

56:07.760 --> 56:08.760
They didn't even care.

56:08.760 --> 56:09.760
They didn't even care.

56:09.760 --> 56:15.760
And now that I'm here, I'd like to put up some wallpaper.

56:15.760 --> 56:19.760
So, you know, I tried for four years, and I gave up.

56:19.760 --> 56:20.760
Wow.

56:20.760 --> 56:21.760
And I said, what can I do?

56:21.760 --> 56:22.760
I couldn't do anything.

56:22.760 --> 56:24.760
I was on all these committees and all the rest.

56:24.760 --> 56:25.760
Nothing could happen.

56:25.760 --> 56:27.760
So I gave up, and I said, you know,

56:27.760 --> 56:30.760
I think education is kind of important.

56:30.760 --> 56:32.760
I think it's kind of important for universities

56:32.760 --> 56:33.760
to actually educate students.

56:33.760 --> 56:36.760
And my guess is this is going to have some bad effects

56:36.760 --> 56:39.760
in the real world, but who knows, right?

56:39.760 --> 56:40.760
Who do I know?

56:40.760 --> 56:43.760
I'm an, you know, uneducated 21-year-old.

56:43.760 --> 56:45.760
I just have a university degree.

56:45.760 --> 56:47.760
So I went out into the real world,

56:47.760 --> 56:49.760
and then I encountered human beings.

56:49.760 --> 56:51.760
And I encountered human beings in positions

56:51.760 --> 56:55.760
of pretty dramatic levels of decision-making.

56:55.760 --> 56:58.760
And they were intelligent, high IQ.

56:58.760 --> 56:59.760
They were well-meaning.

56:59.760 --> 57:00.760
They wanted to do good things.

57:00.760 --> 57:04.760
And they were making awful, awful decisions

57:04.760 --> 57:07.760
that impacted a lot of people's lives, right?

57:07.760 --> 57:10.760
I saw it in the working world, corporate world.

57:10.760 --> 57:11.760
People were like making decisions,

57:11.760 --> 57:13.760
and companies were going out of business

57:13.760 --> 57:15.760
and making bone-headed moves.

57:15.760 --> 57:17.760
I saw it obviously in politics.

57:17.760 --> 57:18.760
I saw it everywhere.

57:18.760 --> 57:22.760
And it just got worse and worse and worse.

57:22.760 --> 57:28.760
And by the way, it wasn't even a partisan thing, right?

57:28.760 --> 57:32.760
I could even track when, you know,

57:32.760 --> 57:36.760
an era has gone by when you look fondly back at any,

57:36.760 --> 57:40.760
any, you know, government that we had over the past 20-some years.

57:40.760 --> 57:42.760
And you say, well, look, you know,

57:42.760 --> 57:45.760
you had Congress controlled on the right, on the left, et cetera.

57:45.760 --> 57:47.760
You never look back and say, oh, my God, boy,

57:47.760 --> 57:49.760
wasn't that like a look at what, you know,

57:49.760 --> 57:52.760
the House of Representatives was able to do in 1996

57:52.760 --> 57:55.760
or what did the Senate were able to do in 2002 or 2007?

57:55.760 --> 58:00.760
These were generally not well-functioning organizations, right?

58:00.760 --> 58:05.760
And they've just gotten progressively worse over time.

58:05.760 --> 58:07.760
You are an educational activist.

58:07.760 --> 58:09.760
Yeah, absolutely.

58:09.760 --> 58:10.760
You're a disruptor.

58:10.760 --> 58:11.760
No.

58:11.760 --> 58:13.760
You're an obstructionist.

58:13.760 --> 58:14.760
We don't believe in disruption.

58:14.760 --> 58:15.760
We want to reform.

58:15.760 --> 58:16.760
We want to reform.

58:16.760 --> 58:20.760
Yeah, that's super interesting because nobody is standing up

58:20.760 --> 58:24.760
for the rest of us in terms of getting educated.

58:24.760 --> 58:27.760
And it does seem as though universities have gotten more about

58:27.760 --> 58:31.760
can we do business in terms of agriculture?

58:31.760 --> 58:34.760
Can we do medicine?

58:34.760 --> 58:36.760
Can we do law?

58:36.760 --> 58:38.760
Can we do business?

58:38.760 --> 58:39.760
They don't do architecture.

58:39.760 --> 58:40.760
They don't do dance.

58:40.760 --> 58:42.760
They don't do art anymore.

58:42.760 --> 58:45.760
They don't do any of the things that really fuel those three things

58:45.760 --> 58:46.760
that I listed initially.

58:46.760 --> 58:49.760
And again, from our perspective, totally right.

58:49.760 --> 58:53.760
And the most tragic, they no longer do general education.

58:53.760 --> 58:59.760
General education is the most important role of an undergraduate degree.

58:59.760 --> 59:02.760
That's why it's called an undergraduate degree.

59:02.760 --> 59:06.760
It's supposed to train the mind so that when you then figure out

59:06.760 --> 59:08.760
what you want to do, you go to get a graduate degree

59:08.760 --> 59:10.760
or you go into the workforce or what have you

59:10.760 --> 59:15.760
and then use the general systemic thinking, those general ideas.

59:15.760 --> 59:18.760
This all goes back to capitalism.

59:18.760 --> 59:21.760
Well, that's an easy thing to say.

59:21.760 --> 59:27.760
Because it goes back to when I'm 15 years old in 1989

59:27.760 --> 59:31.760
in Brown, Deer, Wisconsin, it's happening around me.

59:31.760 --> 59:32.760
I'm not aware of it yet.

59:32.760 --> 59:36.760
But looking back on it, I'm aware that programs are being lifted and pulled.

59:36.760 --> 59:39.760
Now, some of them are...

59:39.760 --> 59:41.760
Well, actually at that time, all the programs that were being lifted

59:41.760 --> 59:43.760
and pulled were like trade programs.

59:43.760 --> 59:47.760
My best friend Dave Friedel, who's been on the podcast and stuff,

59:47.760 --> 59:52.760
he was a huge beneficiary of the...

59:52.760 --> 59:55.760
There was a program at my high school where,

59:55.760 --> 59:58.760
if you were really interested in food service,

59:58.760 --> 01:00:02.760
you could take classes at our high school and then there was an internship

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:03.760
and there was all these things.

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.760
And he was like one of the last people through that chute

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.760
and was able to...

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.760
He's not now Wolfgang Puck.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:11.760
He's now a fucking coder.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:16.760
He's got a digital job.

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:22.760
But he was able to not slip through the cracks and fall into fucking hell

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:26.760
because he wasn't a guy...

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:28.760
He had a different kind of...

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:31.760
He didn't excel on tests or in geometry or whatever,

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:35.760
but he was fucking nailing it in these food service classes.

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.760
There was programs in every public high school.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.760
There would be like tendrils going into...

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.760
You're a dirt ball.

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.760
That's what I affectionately call them.

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:47.760
We have a fucking auto shop at our high school

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.760
and then also we have paths for you.

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:53.760
They are not like in the old world European class system

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.760
like, oh, you were born in this tax bracket,

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.760
so you're going to be a mechanic.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:02.760
It's more like, hey, you can't stop making horrible jokes to the teacher after class

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:06.760
and you don't also care about isosceles triangles.

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.760
But there are opportunities.

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:13.760
There's fingers everywhere for all of our kids.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:18.760
You could end up being a genius, proving that you were a genius

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:22.760
in something that wasn't necessarily testing well in this or that area.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:27.760
That's what was happening when I was 15 going on all around me.

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:32.760
Then the follow-up to that is really that they started caving in on the other side.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.760
The school papers started shutting down.

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:38.760
The first time after I went to visit my school paper editor,

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.760
he's like, no, no more school paper.

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:43.760
You were one of the last ones.

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:46.760
We don't train kids to be creative anymore.

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:48.760
We train them to pass English tests.

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.760
Now, the obvious answer to all of this,

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:53.760
and we've all watched everyone in my audience have probably seen these documentaries,

01:01:53.760 --> 01:02:01.760
it's because of the government agencies who are, I guess, accountable to their voters

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:07.760
that say to the school districts, oh, you've got to make your kids smarter.

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:11.760
They're terrible people now. They're rapists and murderers and carjackers.

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:12.760
Make them smarter.

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:16.760
Then the schools go, okay, we're going to, and then this weird thing happens

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:20.760
where the tests become, everyone's just being trained to pass tests.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:23.760
Otherwise, the schools lose their funding and all this stuff.

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:29.760
Then meanwhile, on the 1% side, all of these campuses used to be the places where,

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:32.760
fuck society, fuck your parents even.

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:36.760
Yeah, they paid for tuition, but they paid tuition because, you know what,

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:40.760
this is a burgeoning industry, this idea of shaping your young adult mind.

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:45.760
Your parents are going to pay 50 grand and they're going to get a hippie spit out of this chute,

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:48.760
and they're going to be like, what the fuck did I pay for him?

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:50.760
We're going to be like a genius.

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:54.760
There was leeway there, but then from all sides,

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:56.760
you've been telling me about this.

01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:02.760
There was this shift in the 80s, 90s, where it was basically, in general,

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:10.760
financial institutions started hanging out at the bars where government hung out at

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:13.760
and started going, hey, you want a pack of cigarettes?

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:14.760
Follow me to my van.

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:20.760
And then all government became slowly, like it metastasized this entire thing.

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:27.760
The separation of government and business just disappeared,

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.760
and now government has just taken it up the butt,

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:33.760
and they're not using that derogatorily, because they're enjoying it,

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:36.760
and they have a right to do it.

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.760
Really, we need new colloquialism.

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:44.760
We need new ways of stating, like, we need a new word for pussy,

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:45.760
and we need to do it.

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:46.760
I've been thinking that.

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.760
You can't be David Mamet anymore.

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:52.760
You're going to swallow my cum, you fucking faggot pussy.

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.760
We need all curse words.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:58.760
You might have an important point about dynamics.

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:01.760
So I don't know if this was a nefarious plan,

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:03.760
but it certainly evolved this way.

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.760
And again, I think it's a lot because of unintended consequences.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:13.760
So give me an example of, at least from my perspective, a lot of these things changed.

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:18.760
In the early 1980s, U.S. News and World Report came out with ranking of colleges.

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:26.760
And I would argue that that event actually accelerated all of these previous inclinations

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.760
that the institutions had, but never really acted upon,

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.760
because it was never really in their interest.

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:34.760
All of a sudden, they're in their interest to do stupid things,

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:37.760
like restrict the number of students that come to the university,

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.760
because they wanted to have low acceptance rates,

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:42.760
and then have a lot of professors for every student.

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.760
But if you don't actually want the professor to teach the students,

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.760
you want them to be in the lab doing research,

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:50.760
and then you want them to spend as much money as possible on that professor to do research

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.760
so that you would go up in the rankings.

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:54.760
And if you did that, guess what?

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:59.760
You need a lot of rich kids to support this constricted number of seats.

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.760
And the reverse would be a party school.

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.760
You would show pictures of the football team.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:07.760
You'd show pictures of great fans and people spring breaking it up.

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:08.760
Exactly.

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:12.760
Both of those have in common, and all of that has in common with, meanwhile,

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:16.760
in the inner cities of kids being pushed through that can pass tests.

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:22.760
All of that goes back to the hydra of capitalism, which isn't a bad thing,

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.760
unless, well, maybe it is a bad thing.

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:31.760
Well, it's bad because what happens in the outcome is that if the school,

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:34.760
and this is kind of where it comes back to the banks and everybody else,

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:37.760
those institutions want to hire, ultimately,

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:41.760
and wind up hiring the sons and daughters of rich people.

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:47.760
If you trust the US dollar to measure everything,

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:51.760
if you trust it to give equivalence,

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.760
everything is going to have a price.

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.760
Human life is going to have a price.

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:56.760
We know this.

01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:57.760
It's right under our nose.

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.760
We know that medicine doesn't work privately.

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:03.760
We know that education is not working privately.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:08.760
Well, but it can if you had people think systemically.

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.760
So if the government, rather than saying,

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:14.760
we're just going to subsidize universities and take a blind eye,

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:18.760
if in 1965, when federal financial aid got implemented,

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:23.760
and all they said would be, any university is eligible for federal financial aid,

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:28.760
if and only if the cost of time that university rise at the rate of inflation or lower.

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:32.760
If they just did that, you know how much every university would cost now?

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:35.760
What we cost, what we cost in tuition and fees.

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.760
I wasn't listening to that because I was thinking about,

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.760
because I've been trying to bring up our second guest,

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:42.760
because I want to plug this keymaster into this gatekeeper.

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:47.760
I don't know if you guys are going to fight or blow up New York.

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:50.760
But let's bring up our old friend, Josh Andraski.

01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:58.760
Oh, yeah.

01:06:58.760 --> 01:06:59.760
Looking fresh.

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.760
Looking fresh.

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:03.760
Hi, hello.

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:06.760
So socialists are dressing differently now since the last time we talked.

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:09.760
Yeah, I figured I wouldn't wear a flannel.

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:14.760
And I'm instead wearing a Shannon and the Clam shirt with two Barts kissing.

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:16.760
That white jacket, though, is dope.

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:17.760
Thank you.

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:18.760
It's luxury socialist.

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:20.760
Have you been taking any of this stuff in, Josh?

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.760
Yes.

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:24.760
So I'm a little...

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:27.760
I'm conflicted personally with my ideology.

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:32.760
I agree that I think schools should be public institutions.

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:36.760
I think that as a society, we should value education

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:40.760
and we should put people in our government that value education.

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:46.760
And again, the tendrils of capitalism have infected education, healthcare, blah, blah, blah, all that shit.

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:51.760
But I am also very intrigued at you destroying Harvard.

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:54.760
Reforming, reforming. We want to reform.

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.760
I'm an accelerationist.

01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:59.760
I think that Harvard is the Isis of comedy.

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.760
And I think that they deserve to go down.

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:04.760
The Isis of comedy.

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:05.760
Yes.

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.760
I mean, just look at SNL.

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:10.760
But the...

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:15.760
For those who don't know, there's a huge rivalry in the comedy community between Harvard and working guys.

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:18.760
Guys who fucking actually tell jokes and love it.

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:19.760
Yeah, it's crazy.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:23.760
But it's the exact thing where it's like you get into Harvard

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.760
because you have the same last name as someone who got into Harvard

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:27.760
and then, oh my God, look at you.

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:30.760
You're writing on the show that used to be good and is now bad.

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:33.760
It's so weird that there's more Harvard people.

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:36.760
The best Harvard alum is the Unabomber.

01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:38.760
Anyway.

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:40.760
As a word for the other, I don't know,

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:44.760
as a showrunner who has therefore accidentally hired Ivy League guys,

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:47.760
like, you know, I'm looking back now,

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:49.760
actually, since the election is like...

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:53.760
In the room, I used to like mock all my Ivy League guys

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:55.760
because I have class issues because I'm like...

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.760
And I'm like, they teach you that at Harvard.

01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.760
They teach you that, yeah.

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:01.760
They don't teach them anything there.

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:03.760
There is some kind of co-relation.

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.760
I just probably not cause effect, but there's a co-relation.

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.760
Yeah, they keep the lights on.

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:09.760
I mean, you've got to have people who actually show up to work.

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:11.760
And that's the Harvard guys.

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:14.760
Comedy writing requires a support system.

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:20.760
So if you're from the streets and you want to be a comedy writer,

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:24.760
you're at this huge disadvantage,

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.760
which at the same time means that,

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:30.760
okay, so if you want the veal cutlets,

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:33.760
like, go with the people that had the support system

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:36.760
because if at 13, if you were Harvard bound

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:38.760
and you decided you wanted to be a Harvard writer,

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:42.760
you can then split that assembly line into hacks and geniuses.

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:46.760
And so there are people that come out of the Ivy League

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:49.760
that knew that they wanted to quit there knowing

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:51.760
I don't want to be a comedy writer.

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:55.760
And I've worked with these guys and like, yeah, it's whatever.

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:59.760
I didn't mean to piss on your fun parade

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.760
and go like, well, not everybody's everything.

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:03.760
Hashtag not all Harvard's.

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:05.760
And it is a fun rivalry.

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.760
It's not a real rivalry.

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:10.760
No, because if it was, they would destroy us.

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.760
They're so rich.

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:15.760
They could get a drone, it'd be over.

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.760
But yeah.

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:21.760
Why isn't education, so if we tomorrow,

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:24.760
if we created a utopian base on the moon and we said,

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:30.760
okay, nobody up here would privatize any aspect of education,

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:32.760
would we ever?

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:34.760
What do you mean by privatize?

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.760
Well, I mean, charge money for it.

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:38.760
I would absolutely.

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:40.760
I'll tell you why.

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:43.760
Non-profit private universities are still private.

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:45.760
Berkeley is public.

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:47.760
Harvard is private.

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:49.760
Stanford is private.

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.760
SUNY is public.

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:54.760
I'm actually opposed to the idea of free college.

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:57.760
And I'll tell you why, because it's a regressive policy.

01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.760
Think about it.

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:02.760
So if you think about college,

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:05.760
let's say not higher education, but just college.

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:09.760
Like Louis is playing and people are checking beer's college.

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:11.760
Yes, that college.

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.760
Who goes to college?

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.760
Rich people.

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:21.760
And people who are eventually going to be relatively wealthy.

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:23.760
Who is the tax base of this country?

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:25.760
100% of Americans.

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.760
One way shape or form,

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:30.760
you pay in taxes into this government.

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:35.760
And so if you say I'm going to take 100% of people's money

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:40.760
and effectively give it to rich people who don't need it,

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:42.760
and people who will be rich,

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:44.760
maybe some of them do need a leg up,

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.760
but eventually will be able to actually pay back.

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.760
I think you're distorting the numbers like crazy.

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:51.760
There's way less rich people than poor people,

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:53.760
or there's fewer rich people

01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:56.760
than there are people that could use college for free.

01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:00.760
The problem is that rich people are overwhelmingly going to college,

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:02.760
whereas poor people in proportion do not.

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:03.760
Because they can't afford it,

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.760
and if they could, then they would overwhelmingly go to college.

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:06.760
Even if they can't afford it.

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:08.760
The problem goes much earlier.

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:10.760
Well, I think that's why I want to decide.

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:13.760
I simplified it by saying if we were on the moon,

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:18.760
if all we had was a disaster,

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:21.760
all we have is a couple cans of air,

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:25.760
and some tents, and we got 100 people.

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:28.760
And we're designing a society now,

01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:32.760
so we want to pick which parts of our society

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:35.760
are driven by the moon dollar,

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:38.760
if anything is going to be,

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:41.760
if there is going to be a moon dollar, I should say.

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.760
That's what I meant.

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.760
If we're starting from scratch,

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:48.760
because it sounds like more like you're being more pragmatic.

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:49.760
I'm going to be more pragmatic.

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:50.760
You're saying like,

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.760
oh, if you change this light bulb and plug in this Christmas ornament,

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:56.760
I think ideologically,

01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:00.760
it's like, why would education ever be purchasable?

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:04.760
Why would any child,

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:09.760
whether they're one years old, 25 years old,

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:10.760
48 years old,

01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:13.760
why would any student be,

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:17.760
if that wants to learn anything,

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:20.760
why does it benefit your society

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:23.760
if the moon is going to go to war with Mars,

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:26.760
and the moon has decided to charge money for education,

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:27.760
and Mars hasn't,

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:30.760
I feel like Mars is going to win in the long run.

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.760
Now, we have a different problem here,

01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:34.760
because we can also say legalize everything,

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:37.760
but if we legalize all drugs tomorrow here in our situation,

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:39.760
we're going to have blood on our hands.

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:41.760
Except what's illegal?

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.760
What drugs are illegal?

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.760
Well, I'm just saying that,

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.760
there's a difference between having these conversations

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:49.760
when there's an existing infrastructure.

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:51.760
How do we move?

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:52.760
There are no silver bullets.

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.760
But within the existing infrastructure,

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:58.760
I still think that you're being a little tricky with numbers

01:13:58.760 --> 01:13:59.760
and with statistics,

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:02.760
because you say that poor people,

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:06.760
regardless of how affordable college is, wouldn't go.

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:10.760
No, I'm all for the why is it regressive.

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:15.760
It's regressive because if you can afford $70,000 a year,

01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:17.760
and somebody says,

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:20.760
I'll let that person go for free on the taxpayer's dollar,

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:21.760
that's insane.

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:22.760
I'm totally fine.

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:23.760
That's not insane.

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:24.760
I think that's insane.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:27.760
I'm fine giving the six rich people the money

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:29.760
if the 94 out of the 100.

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:32.760
We don't know what social class is going to yield

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.760
the doctor that produces the cure for cancer.

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:36.760
But they're going to college anyway.

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:37.760
No, they're not.

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:38.760
They don't need,

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:39.760
a bunch of them are going to jail.

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:40.760
They do need.

01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:44.760
No, the kids that can afford it,

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:46.760
mommy and daddy are writing that check.

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:47.760
Right.

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:49.760
But the kids who can afford it might be the ones to cure

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.760
the disease that we don't even know we're going to get yet.

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:52.760
Correct.

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:54.760
So we need to focus on them.

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:57.760
But why would you not means test access to college

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:58.760
doesn't make any sense.

01:14:58.760 --> 01:14:59.760
If you have the means.

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.760
Means test is interesting,

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:04.760
but denying access will never yield the result.

01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:05.760
No, no, no.

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:06.760
That's all I'm saying.

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:07.760
I'm saying the opposite.

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.760
It was what got us into this problem in the first place

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:11.760
where if you look throughout the history of America,

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:14.760
sweeping programs, you know, for example,

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:17.760
you look at like the golden age of comedy, right?

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:18.760
The golden age of comedy,

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:21.760
you had all these public works, theaters,

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:23.760
and places where people could do music.

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:26.760
And all of these things were funded by a class trader

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:27.760
in the White House.

01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:28.760
Right.

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:29.760
And so without that,

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:32.760
these broke Jew immigrants that like my come from,

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:33.760
you know,

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.760
wouldn't be able to go learn to play the trombone

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:36.760
and then become Sid Caesar.

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:37.760
Sure.

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:38.760
You know.

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:39.760
And so if it was means tested,

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:40.760
it would be like,

01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:43.760
if you make $14,999,

01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:44.760
you get to go to college.

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:46.760
If you make $15,001,

01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:47.760
you don't get to go to college.

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.760
Well, it's just a badly designed program, right?

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:52.760
I mean, but I think it goes beyond that where the idea,

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:54.760
and for those that don't understand,

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:58.760
the idea of means testing is to put a sort of line in the sand

01:15:58.760 --> 01:15:59.760
where you go,

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:00.760
if you're more poor than this,

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:01.760
you get this,

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:03.760
if you're not, you don't.

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:07.760
And certainly there will be absolutely people

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:10.760
that are rich or who don't need the program,

01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:12.760
who will benefit from it.

01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:15.760
But if you look, I mean, realistically,

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:16.760
at the numbers,

01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:18.760
there's far more people who deserve something

01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:19.760
that will be getting it.

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:22.760
That's why I believe that health care should be,

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:23.760
you know,

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:26.760
totally free and public and public universities.

01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:28.760
And I actually do think that there is a place

01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:29.760
for private universities,

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:32.760
for-profit private universities within the system,

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:33.760
optionally,

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:36.760
because I don't believe in like a stolen thing.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.760
To me, educational, I guess,

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:42.760
privatization would be analogous with elective surgery.

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:45.760
Like, I want to look like Mel Brooks.

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:48.760
But then, okay, then you have to pay for that.

01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:49.760
The government doesn't pay for that.

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:50.760
But that's not good.

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:51.760
That's not good,

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:53.760
because then all of the rich people,

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:54.760
this is what you have today.

01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:57.760
You have the poor people going to the poor university,

01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.760
and you have the rich people going to the rich university.

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.760
Where's Goldman Sachs going to go higher?

01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:03.760
I mean, hopefully, nowhere near my friends.

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:05.760
Okay, well, the point is,

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:07.760
when it comes to sciences, though,

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.760
it doesn't matter which university you go to,

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:11.760
it's the results that you yield.

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:12.760
It's the skills that you learn.

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:13.760
Correct.

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:15.760
But then you have to resource those universities

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.760
to provide those results.

01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:18.760
But that's what happens.

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:19.760
Rich companies come in,

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:21.760
and they buy half of the University of Wisconsin

01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:23.760
to develop something for their company.

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:25.760
But when you limit access,

01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:28.760
you guarantee that you are not going to get the best of it.

01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:29.760
Oh, no, exactly.

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:31.760
So what you have to do is you have to change.

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:32.760
So again, this is a good way.

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:35.760
So I'll give you a solution that I would implement

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:36.760
if I were like magic wand.

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:38.760
So my magic wand would be

01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:40.760
the government makes a declaration

01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:42.760
which is if you want to be a non-profit,

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:45.760
if you want to have any federal dollars,

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:48.760
any kind, you know, access to all grants,

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:50.760
not pay taxes and all the rest,

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:54.760
very simply, your student body needs to roughly align

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:57.760
to the socioeconomic spectrum in the United States.

01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:58.760
Right?

01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:01.760
You get 10% of your students from the top 10%,

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.760
10% of the bottom 10%, and throughout.

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:04.760
If you do not do that,

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:07.760
all of your federal funding gone.

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:08.760
Deal.

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:09.760
Right?

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.760
At that point, you have solved the access problem overnight.

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:12.760
Yeah.

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:14.760
I mean, or you don't have to do anything for free, right?

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:16.760
You just have to actually get those units.

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:18.760
So Harvard won't be 10, 10, 10, 10, 10.

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.760
It would be 10% and 90% from the bottom.

01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:22.760
It would take no chances.

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:23.760
Right?

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:25.760
So this to me is something that you could do.

01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:28.760
I feel like that system sounds better for Congress

01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:31.760
if like Congress had to have like a representative,

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:34.760
like spectrum of wealth as like America.

01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:37.760
But if we talk about how you need a college education

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:40.760
for a job, if we talk about how,

01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:42.760
for me personally and for a lot of people,

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.760
I think education is a human right,

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:49.760
then anything that you do to get rid of access,

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:54.760
to limit access to all people is bad.

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:56.760
And that's not to say that like,

01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:59.760
if you go to the poor school or whatever,

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:03.760
it would be in a situation where because of the taxes,

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:04.760
because of the money coming in,

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:08.760
there would be all this new money coming into public universities.

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:10.760
So those schools would become better, right?

01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:12.760
If there's more people, if there's more perspectives,

01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:14.760
there's more money coming in,

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:17.760
then people who go to those schools who luck out

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:19.760
and become people who can hire people,

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:22.760
they'll go, I'm not going to hire from Harvard.

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:24.760
You know, like this hypothetical is just as realistic as your hypothetical.

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:25.760
Correct.

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:30.760
If you actually create a much, much more well-resourced,

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:32.760
education-focused public university

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:34.760
that actually teaches people how to think,

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:36.760
and you have the privates keeping doing whatever they're doing,

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.760
then you're definitely right, right?

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:39.760
Yeah, I think...

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:41.760
Then the shift, the tide will shift.

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:42.760
I think with my drunken brain,

01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:45.760
I think I'm just dumb enough to perceive

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:46.760
the two smart people are agreeing,

01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:50.760
but that you guys are different distances from the problem.

01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:51.760
Yeah.

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:54.760
Not distances from the problem being a project.

01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:59.760
You were born from it and have a fucking...

01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:03.760
You want to dig in and plug this wire into that wire

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:05.760
and hot wire this car,

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:08.760
and Josh is going like, why fucking cars, man?

01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:12.760
And I think both of you are agreeing,

01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:14.760
or I'm dumb and drunk,

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:16.760
and that's at least half true.

01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:19.760
I think absolutely that your system has a place

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:21.760
within the system that I'm imagining.

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:24.760
I think that they're absolutely...

01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:29.760
It's absurd that the IVs run the way they do

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:31.760
with legacy bullshit and all of that,

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:33.760
and that absolutely needs to be reformed,

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:36.760
and that there absolutely is a place in the world

01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:39.760
for those who choose, electively,

01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:45.760
to join a for-profit specialized private institution.

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:48.760
Like DeVry, or ITT,

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:50.760
or several places you could go to.

01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:52.760
We'll leave links.

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:54.760
Yeah, if you use the promo code, whoops,

01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:56.760
you can join University of Phoenix right now.

01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:00.760
Well, if I don't play the bad guy and cut people off,

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:02.760
then no one is.

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:04.760
That's my role,

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.760
because as you know,

01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:09.760
if you're new to this podcast, it's time to play Balderdash.

01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:17.760
And so Spencer, are you prepared to...

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:19.760
You're not DMing Balderdash,

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:21.760
because the part of the game is that

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:24.760
we're going to rotate through dealers, I think.

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:26.760
Yeah, I think that's part of the game.

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:28.760
The game of Balderdash is simple.

01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:30.760
Have you guys played Balderdash?

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:31.760
No.

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:37.760
Each participant will make up an answer to the question.

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.760
You explain it, you're better.

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:41.760
I'm bad at explaining games.

01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:44.760
Why don't I dash for the first round?

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:49.760
And then I think by playing around, it'll become...

01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:50.760
Learn by doing.

01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:52.760
Yeah, it's pretty simple.

01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:54.760
It's basically like,

01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:56.760
I'm going to give you guys a piece of paper.

01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:00.760
I'm going to give you a...

01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:02.760
A box.

01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:04.760
I'm going to give you a box.

01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:06.760
Depending on the category,

01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:09.760
I'm going to give you an acronym, a movie title,

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:12.760
a human name, something like that.

01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:16.760
That thing has a sort of explanation.

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:18.760
If it's a movie, the movie has a synopsis.

01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:21.760
If it's an acronym,

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:23.760
then the letters I'm going to give you

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:25.760
stand for something in real life somewhere.

01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:27.760
I'm going to know the answer to that.

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.760
You guys are going to take two minutes.

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:32.760
I've got a special surprise for you during that two minutes

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:38.760
to write an attempt at a convincing answer

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:41.760
to what that thing is.

01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:43.760
And then I'm going to read them all aloud,

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:46.760
including the real answer.

01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:49.760
And...

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:50.760
Cards?

01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:51.760
Yes.

01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:53.760
And then here's your answer card.

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:57.760
I'll explain more in a second.

01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:59.760
Spencer, you're going to do one too, right?

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:00.760
Yeah.

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:02.760
Okay, so players...

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:04.760
These are for far away.

01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:06.760
So he's going to read the name,

01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:09.760
and then we're going to invent...

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:10.760
Yeah.

01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:12.760
...fake answers.

01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:15.760
All right, so I'm going to...

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:18.760
I'm going to start with a really simple example,

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:22.760
because I think one of my least favorite categories

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:24.760
will actually make the best practice round.

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:27.760
It's called Laughable Laws.

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:28.760
Okay.

01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:29.760
Laughable Laws.

01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:31.760
All right, so I say to you guys,

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:34.760
in Garfield County, Montana,

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:38.760
it is illegal to draw...

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:43.760
And you just have two minutes to write an answer to that.

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:48.760
Please remember to write your name down in the lower right,

01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:52.760
and just write your answer in the other spot.

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:54.760
And then for this two minutes,

01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:56.760
Andy Dick is just going to...

01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:59.760
We're going to have two minutes of Andy Dick while you...

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:01.760
Andy Dick, we have a microphone for you if you need us.

01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:02.760
Yes, it's over there.

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:03.760
Sorry.

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.760
Okay, is anyone keeping time though?

01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:06.760
I forgot that part.

01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:08.760
It's on, but talk into it together.

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:09.760
Hello?

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:10.760
Oh, okay.

01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:12.760
Can I get my new intern up to hold this?

01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:15.760
They don't have a stand.

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:17.760
We must be 35 seconds into it.

01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:18.760
Well, that's okay though.

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:19.760
They're already writing the answer.

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:20.760
If they have longer, it's just...

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:22.760
Can you come up?

01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:27.760
You're done already?

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:29.760
I didn't even do my thing.

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:31.760
Okay, I'll do it on the next one.

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:34.760
We got two whole minutes.

01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:35.760
What minute are we on?

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:37.760
We're on like 30 seconds in.

01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:39.760
Are you doing Whippets?

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:40.760
No.

01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:41.760
I wish.

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:42.760
Me too.

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:44.760
Maybe if you blow in this...

01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:46.760
Do we have some Andy Dick music?

01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:47.760
Just...

01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:49.760
Do the D&D music.

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:54.760
Why don't you hold on to him?

01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:56.760
No, I'm sorry, I'm not talking to you, Andy.

01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:57.760
Sorry, we're...

01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.760
I thought you were saying hold on to him.

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:00.760
Just hold on to me.

01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:01.760
Because I'm going to write...

01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:03.760
You keep going.

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.760
No!

01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:09.760
Thank you, Zach.

01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:15.760
Oh, for the podcast, Andy's blowing up a glove.

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:16.760
I couldn't find the Michael Williams.

01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:17.760
That's right.

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:18.760
Okay, Andy is blowing up a glove.

01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:19.760
Yeah, thank you, Spencer.

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:21.760
No, I mean, that about covers it.

01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:22.760
You guys done?

01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:23.760
No.

01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:24.760
Keep going.

01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:26.760
We got about a minute.

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:29.760
Okay, you can hand me your card.

01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:32.760
I think I haven't made this work yet.

01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:40.760
You didn't put your name.

01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:41.760
You gotta...

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:43.760
Oh, okay.

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.760
Somebody else is making that.

01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:51.760
We have a live ADR team here that is amazing.

01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:53.760
I don't know which one is yours.

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:55.760
We could do it after, right?

01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:56.760
No, I...

01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:58.760
Oh, I got...

01:25:58.760 --> 01:25:59.760
Yeah, you...

01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:00.760
Okay, I know which one is yours,

01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:02.760
because it's the one without the name on it.

01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:03.760
Okay.

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:06.760
It was me doing it, wasn't it?

01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:07.760
I don't think...

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:10.760
It sounded like it was coming from over there, didn't it?

01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:12.760
Dude, let me look at your answer.

01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:15.760
Okay, all right.

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:18.760
This is going pretty good, I think.

01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:19.760
All right.

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:21.760
No, with me.

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:23.760
Okay, that's the two-minute.

01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:25.760
All right, thank you, Andy Dick.

01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:27.760
He'll be back in a moment.

01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:29.760
All right, it'll be good.

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:30.760
Thank you.

01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:31.760
We're all learning.

01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:32.760
That's...

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:33.760
Thank you, thank you.

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:34.760
Okay, I get it.

01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:35.760
I'm...

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:36.760
Okay.

01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:37.760
Okay.

01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:38.760
Those nitrile gloves are harder.

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:39.760
Let's strike that.

01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:40.760
Can we strike that?

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:41.760
Can we strike that?

01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:42.760
All right.

01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:43.760
Let's strike that.

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:44.760
Can you point it right into the monitor?

01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:45.760
The longest strike ever.

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:46.760
That was...

01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:47.760
Still on camera.

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:48.760
Human timer, Andy Dick.

01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:49.760
All right.

01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:52.760
As we go...

01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:53.760
Okay.

01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:54.760
This is a growth opportunity.

01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:55.760
I'm worried about...

01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:57.760
I had so much trouble with that,

01:26:57.760 --> 01:26:58.760
and I'm like the Balderdash expert.

01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.760
I'm worried about sicking that on other people.

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:01.760
Right.

01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:03.760
I think maybe I should just be the permanent Balderdash dealer.

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:05.760
Yeah, I was kind of thinking about just having one dealer

01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:06.760
when we were...

01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:07.760
Yeah.

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:08.760
I'm pretty sure we all learned that tonight

01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:10.760
no one can get an F.

01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:11.760
Right.

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:12.760
All right.

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:16.760
So, now, you at home, and you guys,

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:21.760
it's your job to try to guess which one is the real one.

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:25.760
And then each person that guesses the real one, if any,

01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:28.760
those people get a certain number of points.

01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:30.760
It's either one or two.

01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:31.760
I think it's one.

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:32.760
All right.

01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:37.760
Anybody whose answer accrues guesses.

01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:39.760
I think that guy gets two points.

01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:41.760
See, this is means testing in action.

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:45.760
I got the points here.

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:46.760
Is it one...

01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:47.760
If you get a vote,

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:49.760
if you get your answer voted for, you get a point.

01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:50.760
Okay.

01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:51.760
You get the right...

01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:52.760
If you guess the right answer, you get two points.

01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:53.760
Okay, you get two points.

01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:54.760
And if I...

01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:57.760
I get three points if none of you guessed the real one.

01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:58.760
Just as a...

01:27:58.760 --> 01:27:59.760
Right.

01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:00.760
And if someone accidentally gets a right...

01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:01.760
It keeps me honest.

01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:02.760
Okay.

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:03.760
You also get three points.

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:04.760
All right.

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:12.760
So, in Garfield County, Montana, it is illegal to draw...

01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:13.760
Shuffling these up.

01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:14.760
I wrote the real answer on one of these pieces of paper

01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:15.760
so you're not getting any clues.

01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:17.760
Are we allowed to use Google?

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:18.760
No.

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:19.760
Okay.

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:21.760
It's not called Balder Cheat.

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:25.760
Well, it wouldn't be cheating if you were allowed to use it.

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:31.760
In Garfield County, Montana, it is illegal to draw funny faces on the outside of your

01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:32.760
window shades.

01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:33.760
Interesting.

01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:37.760
Is this in Montana?

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:38.760
Yep.

01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:39.760
Okay.

01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:43.760
A male phallus on an overpass.

01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:45.760
Also interesting.

01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:56.760
A man enjoying himself to the Isley Brothers Live album moments after his divorce.

01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:57.760
Sharon.

01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:02.760
Is final Sharon?

01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:05.760
You're not supposed to tip your hat if you didn't answer.

01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:06.760
To those listening.

01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:07.760
I mean, you can.

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:08.760
It's fun.

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:09.760
He is nodding.

01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:10.760
Yeah, that didn't work out.

01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:11.760
I wasn't going to vote for that one.

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:13.760
I didn't know how this was going to pay off.

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:14.760
No, it's cool.

01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:17.760
You made the right choice.

01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:24.760
A commissioned mural on a Monday, bitch.

01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:25.760
Okay.

01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:27.760
So those answers again.

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:32.760
In Garfield County, Montana, it is illegal to draw funny faces on the outside of your

01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:33.760
window shades.

01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:36.760
A male phallus on an overpass.

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:40.760
A man enjoying himself to the Isley Brothers Live album moments after his divorce.

01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:44.760
Is final Sharon.

01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:45.760
Sorry.

01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:49.760
That's a crime in a lot of states, Sharon.

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:54.760
A commissioned mural on a Monday, bitch.

01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:56.760
All right.

01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:57.760
Whose guesses are hooms?

01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:59.760
Wait, aren't we supposed to guess?

01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:00.760
Yes.

01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:02.760
That's why I said whose guesses are hooms.

01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:03.760
The funny faces is my guess.

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:05.760
Funny faces is your guess.

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:06.760
So let's see.

01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:11.760
I'll put a little S there and then Ben, what's your guess?

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:13.760
I'm going to go with you overpass.

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.760
Overpass phallus.

01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:19.760
So I'll put a B in there and then Josh.

01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:21.760
I'm going to go funny faces.

01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:22.760
It's Montana.

01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:23.760
It's weird.

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:24.760
Funny faces.

01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:25.760
Okay.

01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:28.760
So in the game of Balderdash, what would happen here?

01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:29.760
Wait.

01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:30.760
Oh, wait.

01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:31.760
I'm sorry.

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:32.760
Brandon, wait.

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:33.760
You don't have to ask me.

01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:36.760
No, what's your guess?

01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:38.760
Josh, you're picking funny faces, right?

01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:39.760
Yes.

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:40.760
Okay.

01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:42.760
What do you think the real answer is?

01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:43.760
What do you think is the real one?

01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:45.760
I was going to say penises.

01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:46.760
On the overpass.

01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:47.760
Typical.

01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:48.760
Okay.

01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:50.760
So that's, okay.

01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:54.760
So I don't get any points because some of you guessed the real one.

01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:57.760
The real one is funny faces on the outside.

01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:00.760
Spencer, therefore, gets a point.

01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:01.760
Is that correct?

01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:03.760
That's for getting the right answer.

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:06.760
And I get two points because two people voted for my answer.

01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:09.760
No, you get one point for guessing the right answer.

01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:12.760
No, I get two points who guessed the real answer.

01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:17.760
Two points to players who guessed the real answer.

01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:19.760
I'm learning that right off the thing.

01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:22.760
So you only get a point for everyone who guesses yours.

01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:23.760
So two people guessed yours.

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:24.760
Right.

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:25.760
So you're getting a total of three points.

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:28.760
Because I did the fallacies on the overpass.

01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:31.760
Oh.

01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:34.760
Oh.

01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:35.760
Spencer just left.

01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:36.760
It's it.

01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:37.760
Ran off stage.

01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:38.760
He's lost his mind.

01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:39.760
He's back on stage.

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:40.760
Rolled on stage.

01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:42.760
Fire rolled on stage.

01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:43.760
And he's back to the chair.

01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:45.760
Which did not roll away.

01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:46.760
He stuck the land.

01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:47.760
I hope I went now.

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:51.760
So that's, that's a, that's a total of, yeah, I can't remember.

01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:52.760
Four points.

01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:53.760
Okay.

01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:55.760
Did anyone else win points?

01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:56.760
Yes.

01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:58.760
Other people won some points because.

01:31:58.760 --> 01:31:59.760
Yeah.

01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:01.760
You got two points for getting the right answer.

01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:02.760
Right.

01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:03.760
God damn it.

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:04.760
It's too hard.

01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:05.760
Points are fun.

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:08.760
I mean, we could just do the rounds without keeping score.

01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:10.760
Well, yeah, but what's, yeah, it's not fun.

01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:11.760
Right.

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:12.760
I mean, it's.

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:13.760
Well, it's funer than this.

01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:14.760
Relative.

01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:18.760
We could eat bowls of shit and be further.

01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:19.760
And that's not, wait a minute.

01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:22.760
I'm a, I'm a fun stickler.

01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:25.760
Wait, wake up.

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:28.760
I don't know how Doug Benson does it on his show.

01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:29.760
Yeah.

01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:32.760
I guess I was just thinking like if we did like, if we did enough rounds, but then I

01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:35.760
was, but it's just like, I wouldn't wish this job on anyone.

01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:37.760
Like this is awful.

01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:38.760
It's, it's really hard to do.

01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:39.760
Yeah.

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:41.760
This job is boulder dash.

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:43.760
Oh, that's why it's the dasher.

01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:44.760
I just got that.

01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:45.760
All right.

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:48.760
So someone, Spencer won and somebody else got points.

01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:51.760
So the, I should have ran around.

01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:53.760
We could do another round.

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:56.760
I mean, you don't seem to want to.

01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:57.760
So that's fine.

01:32:57.760 --> 01:32:59.760
I'm just worried about, I have, I have two hats on.

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:03.760
Do you want one is a terrible Balderdash dealer and then the other is a terrible podcast

01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:04.760
host.

01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:05.760
Yeah.

01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:06.760
Yeah.

01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:12.760
I feel like I'm making my, the two of them are, are losing to each other.

01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:15.760
And yeah, and we're all losing to Doug Benson.

01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:20.760
It feels like choosing a holiday game that ends in arguments might not have been the

01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:22.760
best, but talking about politics was going so well.

01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:29.760
Can we, can we give you, we stall just a little bit and maybe ask them where we're going in

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:30.760
terms of education.

01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:36.760
You mean while Andy Dick does two minutes or while you, while you get your cards together

01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:41.760
because we, we don't know what that, what's the uptick on the way of getting out of this

01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:42.760
conversation that we had with you earlier.

01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:45.760
That's sort of like, what should we expect?

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:46.760
Yeah.

01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:53.760
That ain't, that ain't nearly as good, Andy Dick.

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:54.760
Is there a camera?

01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:55.760
I thought I heard my name.

01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:56.760
No, you did.

01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:57.760
I'm late.

01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:58.760
I mean early.

01:33:58.760 --> 01:33:59.760
Am I early or late?

01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:00.760
You're just a little early.

01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:01.760
You're just a little early.

01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:02.760
But you have all the instruments.

01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:03.760
You did have the right instruments.

01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:06.760
I could have sworn we said two hangers, Andy Dick.

01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:07.760
One hanger.

01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:09.760
Andy Dick is who we're working with right now.

01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:10.760
Geez.

01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:11.760
I'm sorry.

01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:16.760
Two hangers, Andy Dick, one hanger, Andy Dick is who we're working with right now.

01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:17.760
Jesus.

01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:18.760
Okay.

01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:19.760
Yeah.

01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:20.760
Tell us, tell us, tell us.

01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:21.760
Give us a little future.

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:23.760
So, so, you know, so do you have an example?

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:26.760
So whenever it's now on our third class of undergrads.

01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:28.760
So it started this past September.

01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:31.760
And where, where are the first one and two classes?

01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:32.760
This semester they're in Seoul.

01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:34.760
Next semester they're going to Hyderabad.

01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:35.760
Awesome.

01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:42.760
And for this third class, we received more applications, third class ever than Dartmouth

01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:43.760
or MIT did.

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:45.760
So give me, what's the ballpark on that?

01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:48.760
20,400 applications from 179 countries.

01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:50.760
And how many people are you going to take?

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:57.760
We took last year just under 2%, which actually shows that you can be the most selective university

01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:02.760
in the country and the most economically diverse without trying.

01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:03.760
It's not, that wasn't the goal.

01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:05.760
It was just we stopped discriminating.

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:06.760
Do you have scholarships?

01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:07.760
Yeah.

01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:09.760
80% of our students are in some form financially.

01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:10.760
That's pretty amazing.

01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:11.760
Yeah.

01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:12.760
It's pretty amazing.

01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:13.760
So what do you hope?

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:15.760
What is your biggest dream with all of this?

01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:17.760
Would you, would you want a brick and mortar one day?

01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:18.760
No, no.

01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:23.760
My, my, my biggest dream is that other universities are forced to follow.

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:28.760
Because what we've, we've shown third party assessed our students and showed that what

01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:33.760
our students have been able to accomplish in eight months, no university has been able

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:36.760
to demonstrate that they can get their students to accomplish in four years.

01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:40.760
And that's on critical thinking, problem solving, reasoning, and communication skills.

01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:43.760
Do you have any sort of endowment program?

01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:50.760
We, we have endowment, but it, it will take a long time to realize.

01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:55.760
So right now we're doing a lot of fundraising to enable all those scholarships.

01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:58.760
And it's, it's hard work.

01:35:58.760 --> 01:35:59.760
Yeah.

01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:00.760
Thanks for doing that.

01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:01.760
Hard work.

01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:02.760
Well, that sounds like...

01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:03.760
Andy Dick.

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:04.760
Where are you?

01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:05.760
No, no, no, no, no.

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:06.760
Wait, hold on to Andy Dick.

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:07.760
Hold on to Andy.

01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:08.760
Hold on to Andy Dick.

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:09.760
Hold your Andy Dick.

01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:11.760
Stroke it, but hold it.

01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:12.760
Love it.

01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:13.760
It's our fault.

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:18.760
It sounds a lot to me like the narrative is subjective as it is in the category of

01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:25.760
Marvelous Movies in Balderdash.

01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:29.760
So I'd like you to each take, take one of these empty Balderdash cards.

01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:37.760
And I'd like you to try to convince each other what the plot synopsis would be for a

01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:44.760
Marvelous movie entitled San Diego I Love You.

01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:48.760
Two minutes of Andy Dick will happen during your writing.

01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:49.760
Yeah.

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:56.760
Yeah, I saw this in Germany once.

01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:02.760
It was amazing.

01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:04.760
Yeah.

01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:07.760
Oh, don't hurt yourself.

01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:13.760
Well, we'll get, we'll get, we'll get somebody to help you next time.

01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:20.760
When does the time start?

01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:21.760
It starts now.

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:22.760
It started, yeah.

01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:23.760
Tell me when we're at 30.

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:24.760
You got it.

01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:26.760
Then tell me when we're at, you know, 130.

01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:27.760
I got it.

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:28.760
Well, okay.

01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:29.760
We're at 30.

01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:30.760
No, I'll do that.

01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:31.760
He needs to write an answer.

01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:32.760
Okay.

01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:33.760
We're at 30.

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:34.760
No, no, no.

01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:42.760
Two hanger, two hanger, two hanger, Andy Dick in the house.

01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:47.760
Two hanger, two hanger, two hanger, Andy Dick in the house.

01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:55.760
Brandon, write your answer.

01:37:55.760 --> 01:38:09.760
This should be about the bridge, like the midpoint.

01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:12.760
Yeah.

01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:14.760
Well, don't, he's writing.

01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:23.760
Don't get, he's, he's in the competition and you're looking at him and banging a thing.

01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:27.760
Look at, I'll, I can talk to you about it.

01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:29.760
They're, they're all writing.

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:30.760
Yeah.

01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:32.760
I'll, I'll ask, I'll interview you.

01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:35.760
Now, Andy, I don't want to get you in legal trouble, but this is stomp based.

01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:45.760
Maybe this is stomp based.

01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:46.760
Is that a setup?

01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:48.760
Am I supposed to?

01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:53.760
Well, how did they, how did they know?

01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:55.760
Oh, sponsor banks.

01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:56.760
Okay.

01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:57.760
All right.

01:38:57.760 --> 01:38:58.760
That was my timer.

01:38:58.760 --> 01:38:59.760
That's been two minutes.

01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:00.760
Yeah.

01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:01.760
Ladies and gentlemen, Andy Dick.

01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:02.760
Thank you so much.

01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:05.760
Andy Dick, ladies and gentlemen, Andy Dick.

01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:06.760
Andy Dick.

01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:07.760
This is not his first time.

01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:08.760
Andy Dick.

01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:09.760
Don't take those.

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:11.760
We could, we could do that.

01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:14.760
You got your, do I have everybody's card over here?

01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:16.760
I got, I got people forgetting to write their names.

01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:20.760
That's a normal Balderdash thing.

01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:21.760
Okay.

01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:26.760
I got, I think if I can, and that's okay.

01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:31.760
And so I know the person that didn't write their name then.

01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:34.760
Why, why are you so mean to me?

01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:35.760
I don't think you wrote your name.

01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:36.760
Oh, you did.

01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:37.760
Bottom right.

01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:38.760
Bottom right.

01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:39.760
Yeah.

01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:40.760
Wait, who didn't?

01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:42.760
No, thank you though.

01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:43.760
God bless.

01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:44.760
All right.

01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:45.760
That's okay.

01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:46.760
Oh boy.

01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:47.760
I'm sorry.

01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:49.760
No, no, I didn't, that wasn't it.

01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:54.760
I know how that sounded here again, but it was just like, yeah, this is.

01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:55.760
Yeah.

01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:56.760
I mean, we can't afford that.

01:39:56.760 --> 01:40:00.760
Look, you, you, it's obviously it's not going to, it's not going to take out D.

01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:01.760
You're safe.

01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:02.760
No, this isn't what I'm saying.

01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:10.260
This is all, it's just like, I, this has been a, I mean, gauntlet is negative, but smorgasbord

01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:11.260
to be sure.

01:40:11.260 --> 01:40:16.760
Just keep on your toes, you know, if D&T ever, ever falls before this level of entertainment.

01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:18.760
I'm just saying, I'm not complaining.

01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:19.760
I like this.

01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:20.760
Okay.

01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:21.760
I like bad podcasts.

01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:22.760
No, no.

01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:23.760
I really do.

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:25.760
I think this is a lot of fun.

01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:28.760
I feel like this is very unique.

01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:31.760
It's very unique, like the listeners should be doing what they do right now.

01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:32.760
Okay.

01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:34.760
They should be entertaining themselves for a second.

01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:35.760
Yes.

01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:36.760
You know, listeners.

01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:37.760
You're bored right now.

01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:41.760
It's because you as a listener, if not, you didn't get up to make a cheese sandwich.

01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:42.760
Personal responsibility.

01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:43.760
You've been sitting here for hours.

01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:44.760
46 minutes.

01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:45.760
You were commercials.

01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:46.760
Yeah.

01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:47.760
Yeah.

01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:48.760
Are you back from the bathroom?

01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:49.760
Good.

01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:50.760
Cause we're ready for you now.

01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:51.760
Listener.

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:52.760
Thanks for doing your part.

01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:53.760
All right.

01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:58.760
San Diego, I love you is a movie.

01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:05.760
And the following possible synopses include the real one and your job is to guess.

01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:06.760
Okay.

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:07.760
Got a little shit face.

01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:10.760
No, that was exactly the explanation of the game.

01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:11.760
San Diego, I love you.

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:19.760
A daughter tries to keep her family together with while promoting her father's inventions.

01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:20.760
I mean that.

01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:22.760
Try not to laugh.

01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:28.760
San Diego, I love you.

01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:35.760
San Diego is taken over by ocean side gamers.

01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:36.760
San Diego.

01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:37.760
What happened?

01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:38.760
I love you.

01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:41.760
It's just the Godfather, but everyone's name is Skyler.

01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:46.760
Everybody's name is what?

01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:47.760
Skype.

01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:48.760
Skyler.

01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:49.760
Skyler.

01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:50.760
San Diego, I love you.

01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:59.560
Two paths collide in this 1980s culture crash between a hip comic book artist and a fastidious

01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:03.760
marine drill sergeant.

01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:04.760
Interesting.

01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:13.240
A romantic comedy musical about former high school sweethearts who fall in love with each

01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:16.960
other and their hometown.

01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:18.480
So those synopses again.

01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:21.480
Other names, San and Diego in the last one.

01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:23.480
It could be any of those.

01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:24.480
San Diego, I love you.

01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:30.480
A daughter tries to keep her family together while promoting her father's inventions.

01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:31.480
San Diego, I love you.

01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:33.480
San Diego is taken over by ocean side gamers.

01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:35.480
San Diego, I love you.

01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:39.480
It's just the Godfather, but everyone's name is Skyler.

01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:41.480
San Diego, I love you.

01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:48.360
Two paths collide in this 1980s culture crash between a hip comic book artist and a fastidious

01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:50.360
marine drill sergeant.

01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:51.720
San Diego, I love you.

01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:57.360
A romantic comedy musical about former high school sweethearts who fall in love with each

01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:59.360
other and their hometown.

01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:01.360
Okay.

01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:03.360
Okay.

01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:10.360
We'll start the guessing with Ben Nelson, noted educational activist.

01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:12.360
Turned Balderdash.

01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:14.360
Turned Balderdash.

01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:15.360
Midler.

01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:16.360
Very, very bad player.

01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:21.360
I'll go with the culture crash, the 1980s.

01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:22.360
Culture.

01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:23.360
Culture.

01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:24.360
Clash.

01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:25.360
Culture clash.

01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:26.360
Clash.

01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:27.360
1980s culture.

01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:28.360
Clash.

01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:29.360
Clash.

01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:30.360
Yeah.

01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:31.360
Clash.

01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:32.360
All right.

01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:33.360
We got to be in on that one.

01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:34.360
Shut up, too.

01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:35.360
Culture clash.

01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:36.360
All right.

01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:37.360
Wonderful comedy show.

01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:38.360
And Josh Andraski.

01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:39.360
Culture club.

01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:41.360
I'm a guy.

01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:46.360
Social activist in self-imposed exile.

01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:47.360
Sure.

01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:52.560
I'm going to go with the culture clash one because it sounds like something you'd read

01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:54.360
on the back of a VHS.

01:43:54.360 --> 01:44:00.360
And it reminds me of, like, you know, Lily Tomlin and Mel Brooks are the couple of the

01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:02.360
90s in this wacky.

01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:04.360
Yeah, it's that one.

01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:05.360
We got that.

01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:06.360
Brandon.

01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:08.360
I'm going to go with the daughter.

01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:10.360
Trying to hustle her dad's old products.

01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:11.360
All right.

01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:12.360
Well, Brandon has made.

01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:13.360
I got to go.

01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:14.360
Oh, you got to go.

01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:20.360
Well, it sounds like you said he had the right answer, but I was going to guess the last answer,

01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:25.360
the fifth one, whatever the musical.

01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:32.360
Are you just, you're not trying to give it to me, are you?

01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:35.360
No, it sounded like he was about to say that you had the right answer.

01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:38.360
And I didn't want to then use that knowledge to cheat.

01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:40.360
All right, so Spencer guessed Ben's.

01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:41.360
Damn it.

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:43.360
Which means Ben gets a point.

01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:44.360
Yeah.

01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:45.360
All right.

01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:49.360
Brandon guessed the right one, which means Brandon gets two points.

01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:50.360
Right.

01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:55.360
San Diego, I love you was in fact a daughter tries to keep her family together with promoting

01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:57.360
father's inventions.

01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:59.360
What were his inventions?

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:00.360
Drones.

01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:01.360
Drones.

01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:02.360
Great.

01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:03.360
That sounded like Jurassic.

01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:04.360
Weaponized.

01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:05.360
Weaponized drones.

01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:13.360
And then both once again drawn in by Spencer's perverse ability to emulate a board game.

01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:14.360
Wow.

01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:15.360
I mean, that really does.

01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:17.360
When you, when you look at it, it makes a lot of sense.

01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:19.360
He's like a Balderdash ringer.

01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:20.360
Part person.

01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:21.360
Part dash.

01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:22.360
Yeah.

01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:23.360
All right.

01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:25.360
Are you still keeping score?

01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:27.360
I think I'm at six.

01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:29.360
I think I'm at six to maybe someone as two.

01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:30.360
I think you have two.

01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:31.360
I got two from the first round.

01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:32.360
One.

01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:34.360
Yeah, you got one this round.

01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:36.360
This last one for a thousand points.

01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:38.360
Sounds great.

01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:40.360
All right.

01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:45.360
Now, Andy, I want you on deck, but you're not going yet.

01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:47.360
We're going to get better at this.

01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:51.360
But this third round, we're going to show you how this fucking, this is going to go good.

01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:53.360
It's been going good.

01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:56.360
Yeah, we are.

01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:58.360
They're bringing CISO back just for this.

01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:00.360
Oh, great.

01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:03.360
Brought to you by Balderdash and CISO.

01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:08.360
We spent too much money on you guys.

01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:09.360
CISO.

01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:12.360
You saw it coming.

01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:13.360
CISO.

01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:14.360
Nothing left to see.

01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:20.360
So check out Hulu.

01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:25.360
I guess I'll do a category of peculiar people.

01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:27.360
So this is just a name.

01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:28.360
Here, pass these blank ones down.

01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:29.360
So it's like a historical figure.

01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:30.360
Benito.

01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:32.360
It's not necessarily true.

01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:34.360
It's just a name.

01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:40.360
So you just have to, here, I'll pick an example one so that we can get the tone.

01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:45.360
Like, peculiar people example would be, oh, Shay Jackson.

01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:50.360
And then the answer is the real name of Raptor, actor Ice Cube.

01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:53.360
Well, geez, well, that was a bad thing for them to include.

01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:56.360
What happens when somebody writes the real answer?

01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:58.360
If you get the, if you know the real one.

01:46:58.360 --> 01:46:59.360
You get some points.

01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:00.360
You might get three points.

01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:01.360
Yeah.

01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:02.360
So you would get 1,000.

01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:05.360
So you would get, well, we're not, I was kidding.

01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:07.360
I don't want to fuck that up.

01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:08.360
So Christmas is ruined.

01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:09.360
Excellent.

01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:10.360
Oh, right.

01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:11.360
That means I'm almost certainly going to win.

01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:12.360
Yeah.

01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:14.360
I need those points to feed my family, Dan.

01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:15.360
Yeah.

01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:16.360
We could do double points maybe.

01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:22.360
Or we could say you have to win by 10 and just keep playing until that we could do.

01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:23.360
All right.

01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:24.360
This is a name.

01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:33.360
The name is Jeremy Bentham, B-E-N-T-H-A-M.

01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:34.360
And what are we supposed to do?

01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:38.360
You're supposed to just say who that person is.

01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:39.360
Okay.

01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:40.360
Like why they're notable.

01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:41.360
Yes.

01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:42.360
What their deal is.

01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:43.360
Okay.

01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:44.360
They might be the inventor of peanut butter.

01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:45.360
They're right.

01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:48.360
And I give you two minutes of Andy Dick.

01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:49.360
Oh.

01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:57.360
Okay.

01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:02.360
If you love Christmas Nativity at the Crystal Cathedral, you'll love this next act.

01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:11.360
Andy Dick at Harmontown.

01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:12.360
Okay.

01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:13.360
Two hangers.

01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:14.360
A mallet.

01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:18.360
It looks like a one by six.

01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:23.360
We're at about 20 seconds in.

01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:26.360
Andy has a one by four.

01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:27.360
I don't know.

01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:29.360
It's a long, thin piece of lumber.

01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:31.360
It looks like a one by six.

01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:33.360
It's better if I'm on deck.

01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:34.360
Right.

01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:35.360
Yeah.

01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:43.360
We're at 35.

01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:48.360
Whoa.

01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:53.360
This isn't just stump.

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:56.360
It's my off Broadway show called Knock.

01:48:56.360 --> 01:48:57.360
Knock.

01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:59.360
It's Andy's off Broadway show called Knock.

01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:01.360
I forgot to write my name again.

01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:03.360
Put it on Broadway if you're doing it.

01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:07.360
Oh goodness.

01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:12.360
Please don't.

01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:14.360
For everybody listening with headphones.

01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:16.360
God bless you.

01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:18.360
14 people just died in car.

01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:20.360
Correct.

01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:23.360
We're at one minute and 30 seconds.

01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:25.360
So we have 30 more seconds.

01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:26.360
Right.

01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:27.360
Yeah.

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:28.360
30 more seconds.

01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:29.360
30 more seconds.

01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:35.360
So if you could just do the two verses, first two verses.

01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:37.360
Oh, a remix.

01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:45.360
Okay.

01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:46.360
It's been.

01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:47.360
Ben didn't put his name.

01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:48.360
Okay.

01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:49.360
I did.

01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:50.360
Oh, you did.

01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:51.360
Wait.

01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:52.360
I didn't.

01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:53.360
Josh didn't.

01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:54.360
No, I didn't.

01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:55.360
I keep forgetting.

01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:56.360
I'm watching.

01:49:56.360 --> 01:49:57.360
You know, I'm watching Lion King.

01:49:57.360 --> 01:49:58.360
Yeah.

01:49:58.360 --> 01:49:59.360
No, you're wearing a lot of hats.

01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:00.360
Okay.

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:01.360
Thank you.

01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:03.360
That was two minutes of Andy Dick.

01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:05.360
Two minutes of Andy Dick.

01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:06.360
The show.

01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:07.360
Yeah.

01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:10.360
We could get that.

01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:12.360
Did you want to do something on the back of the album?

01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:13.360
I don't know.

01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:17.360
Well, I don't think there will be.

01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:20.360
Yeah, just for the people that are listening.

01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:22.360
Why don't you just tell them something, Andy Dickish?

01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:24.360
Because anyone can bang on a board.

01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:31.360
Tell everybody about being unexpectedly bisexual

01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:36.360
and some point in your life or...

01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:37.360
Fine, fine, fine.

01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:42.360
I think my last instrument that you never did.

01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:44.360
Well, you could just tell us how you're doing.

01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:46.360
How are you?

01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:50.360
Well, that was certainly an action.

01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:51.360
So...

01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:52.360
He's angry.

01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:53.360
He's angry at me.

01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:55.360
There's nothing better than...

01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:59.360
A scruffy figure tossed to traffic going on to the stage.

01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:04.360
Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.

01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:05.360
Hey.

01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:10.360
Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.

01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:11.360
Hey.

01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:13.360
How are you?

01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:16.360
Like, so let people know how you are.

01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:18.360
Listeners are my podcast.

01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:19.360
Right.

01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:22.360
You wanted me to stay on for the blind listeners?

01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:25.360
What are you doing for the holiday season, Andy Dick?

01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:26.360
Anything?

01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:27.360
Any kids that are all here right now.

01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:30.360
Because you just, you told a great dream tale about the Christmas.

01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:32.360
That one on VICE.

01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:34.360
This year you've got to have something different planned.

01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:36.360
Or are you going to revisit that shit?

01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:37.360
No, no, no, no, no.

01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:38.360
Something else?

01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:39.360
No.

01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:42.360
Well, it's probably going to be, you know, the Yule Tide log.

01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:43.360
Something low-key.

01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:44.360
Yeah, very low-key.

01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:45.360
You're invited.

01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:46.360
Thank you so much.

01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:49.360
I'm always invited to your stuff.

01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:51.360
And it's like I come 50-50.

01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:52.360
Right?

01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:54.360
Do you do Dino's Christmas?

01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:55.360
It's 50-50.

01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:56.360
Yeah.

01:51:56.360 --> 01:52:00.360
I usually go out of town, but I'm staying in town.

01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:02.360
Andy's always invited.

01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:04.360
He's had a standing invite.

01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:06.360
He just doesn't know where you're going.

01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:07.360
You heard him.

01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:08.360
You heard him.

01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:12.360
You went to Santa Barbara last week and you were caught in the fires.

01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:13.360
Yeah.

01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:14.360
Have you talked about that?

01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:15.360
No, I didn't think.

01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:17.360
He was caught, I'm going to talk about it.

01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:21.360
He was caught in the fires, like trapped.

01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:22.360
Tell him.

01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:25.360
Don't forget, Dan, tell us about the Paul McCartney song when you get a chance.

01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:26.360
Oh, shit.

01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:29.360
No, we'll talk about that next week.

01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:31.360
Next week will be our Christmas episode.

01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:33.360
We'll talk about the Paul McCartney Christmas song.

01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:34.360
Excellent.

01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:35.360
Which one?

01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:37.360
Which is a very polarizing song.

01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:39.360
That piece of shit, horrible.

01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:41.360
You don't like the McCartney?

01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:43.360
It's the worst fucking Christmas song.

01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:44.360
Why have you met him?

01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:47.360
I don't hate Paul McCartney, I hate his Christmas song.

01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:49.360
Okay, that's probably shitty.

01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:50.360
And he hates a...

01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:51.360
Correct.

01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:57.360
Generous word because that song doesn't deserve my activation.

01:52:57.360 --> 01:52:58.360
Anyways.

01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:04.360
Anybody who starts a sentence with the word simply can fuck off.

01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:09.360
Oh, do they know it's Christmas after all is kind of the shittiest one for me.

01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:10.360
Is that the one?

01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:11.360
Yeah.

01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:13.360
The snow is white.

01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:14.360
The lights are on.

01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:16.360
The gifts are out.

01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:17.360
That's enough.

01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:18.360
Fuck it.

01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:19.360
Simply half.

01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:22.360
It's like the laziest fucking Christmas song.

01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:24.360
The Santa's here.

01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:26.360
The deer can fly.

01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:28.360
The fucking snow is falling.

01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:30.360
What else do you want?

01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:32.360
I'm a beetle.

01:53:32.360 --> 01:53:35.360
I think you can feel his fucking muscles atrophy.

01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:40.360
And then for it to be in every jukebox and for everyone to fall for that.

01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:44.360
We need better education, better critical thinking skills.

01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:47.360
We need kids to be out there going, I'm not going to play this on the jukebox.

01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:48.360
This is ridiculous.

01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:50.360
It has four notes.

01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:55.360
Darling love.

01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:59.360
Let's wrap this up with the results of this last round of all.

01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:00.360
All right.

01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:01.360
Well, thank you.

01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:02.360
Andy Dick.

01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:05.360
Go to Andy's Periscope if you want to give me money.

01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:07.360
Periscope has changed.

01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:08.360
I'm gray listed.

01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:09.360
Did we get into that?

01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:11.360
Where do I put this microphone?

01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:12.360
Yeah.

01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:13.360
Or you can.

01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:15.360
I can't work again for three months.

01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:17.360
That's what gray means.

01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:18.360
No, that's his estimate.

01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:21.360
Andy's using the phrase gray listed to refer to him.

01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:22.360
I would.

01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:25.360
Using an algorithm that I came up with in my face.

01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:27.360
It's like he has a base.

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:28.360
I need a base.

01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:31.360
There's a lot of people that are rooting for Andy.

01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:32.360
Andy's yeah.

01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:33.360
Andy says gray listed.

01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:36.360
I think what he means not to put words in his mouth, but I am.

01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:37.360
Everybody loves Andy.

01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:41.360
But yeah, he can't get work because it's like, like, so he's not blacklisted

01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:44.360
because it's not like, oh, you're, there's some reason.

01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:47.360
That you're, you're, you're banned.

01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:50.360
It's like, oh, there's no, there's no denial of it or whatever.

01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:54.360
It's like, we'll keep track of Andy and his, and his travails.

01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:58.360
He's, he was, he was, he was a periscoping from here.

01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:00.360
And now Periscope has some tip feature.

01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:04.360
I believe Andy is 100% subsisting on Periscope right now.

01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:05.360
Wow.

01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:06.360
Please give.

01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:08.360
It's a, it's a new business model.

01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:10.360
You don't have to wait for Periscope.

01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:12.360
You can, you can give anyway.

01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:15.360
We're going to be doing an Andy Dick telephone later on.

01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:16.360
All right.

01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:17.360
Operators are standing by.

01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:18.360
Yeah.

01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:19.360
I like that.

01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:20.360
I do like that.

01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:24.360
Like what, what the post Weinstein, like the sex scandal, all this stuff.

01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:28.360
And I was like, no, Andy's going to survive this fine because he's a human

01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:31.360
hurricane because like the one headline about Andy Dick that,

01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:36.360
that came out during that whole purge was like the headline was so

01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:37.360
complicated.

01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:38.360
It tripped over itself.

01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:44.360
Like Andy Dick confesses to sexual assault, asks the cameraman if he's

01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:49.360
married falls down, eats a trash bag and like, like ends up marrying somebody.

01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:52.360
It was like the headline is like, like, leave this guy alone.

01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:53.360
Yeah.

01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:56.360
Like he's not, you're not knocking anyone down a peg if you're, if you're

01:55:56.360 --> 01:55:57.360
going for Andy Dick.

01:55:57.360 --> 01:56:00.360
He's, he's, he's, he's, he's on his own journey.

01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:02.360
Very honest, very open.

01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:05.360
He may be the one, he may be the last man standing.

01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:07.360
All right.

01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:10.360
I hope you didn't mind me speaking about him like that while he's standing

01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:11.360
offstage.

01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:12.360
That's nice.

01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:14.360
No, he's, he's in the back.

01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:15.360
All right.

01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:20.360
So your, your, your question was who is this?

01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:26.360
Wait, the name was, I didn't write it down.

01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:29.360
The name is Jeremy Bentham.

01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:36.360
Jeremy Bentham, the possibilities of Jeremy Bentham are he is assuming he

01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:41.360
is, you're welcome.

01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:44.360
He is one of seven genders or two sexes.

01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:45.360
All right.

01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:49.360
He is musician, Adam Ant.

01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:54.360
A noted moral philosopher.

01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:59.360
His preserved body is on display at a London university.

01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:02.360
The boy who ate the most spaghetti.

01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:05.360
Dammit.

01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:06.360
I think that's a good answer.

01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:07.360
That's a good answer.

01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:08.360
I've been getting stoned on stage.

01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:09.360
I think that's a good answer.

01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:10.360
Yeah.

01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:11.360
Yeah.

01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:14.360
Fuck that dude.

01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:16.360
The first, I'm sorry, I'm drunk.

01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:19.360
The first Puerto Rican shortstop for the Padres.

01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:21.360
Oh, Los Yalami, Bentham.

01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:22.360
Yeah.

01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:23.360
Those answers again.

01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:29.360
Jeremy Bentham is either musician, Adam Ant, a noted moral philosopher.

01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:33.360
His preserved body is on display at a London university.

01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:35.360
The boy who ate the most spaghetti.

01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:40.360
Or the first Puerto Rican shortstop for the Padres.

01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:42.360
Puerto Rican.

01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:45.360
Puerto.

01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:48.360
Puerto Rican.

01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:50.360
Who should go first?

01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:51.360
Spencer, you guess first.

01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:52.360
Sorry.

01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:54.360
It's okay.

01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:55.360
The first answer.

01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:56.360
The, what was it?

01:57:56.360 --> 01:57:57.360
Adam Ant.

01:57:57.360 --> 01:57:58.360
Adam Ant, yeah.

01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:01.360
That's a Spencer guess for Adam Ant.

01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:02.360
All right.

01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:03.360
Ben Nelson.

01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:07.360
I'm going to go with the body in the university.

01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:08.360
All right.

01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:11.360
Josh.

01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:14.360
Although I want to say the boy who ate the most spaghetti.

01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:16.360
Because it's a great answer.

01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:20.360
I'm going to have to go with Adam Ant because I'm just going to follow whatever Spencer

01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:21.360
does in a board game.

01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:22.360
All right.

01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:25.360
I'm going to go with philosopher.

01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:26.360
All right.

01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:29.360
Well, this is a complicated round.

01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:35.360
It's notably because Josh Andraski high-fived his own answer.

01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:37.360
Someone was going to take it.

01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:39.360
Like someone was going to guess it.

01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:40.360
He's just trying.

01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:41.360
He's just thought maybe he could psych Brandon out.

01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:45.360
He's like, well, I'd love to say the boy's spaghetti.

01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:47.360
I'm on my last limb here, man.

01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:49.360
I didn't come here to make podcast friends.

01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:53.360
By the way, it's kind of complicated because there are two right answers.

01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:58.360
Oh, look at the drama.

01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:02.360
Oh, because you knew.

01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:03.360
Oh, of course.

01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:09.360
Well, the college master knows everything that goes out into college, including if a

01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:12.360
body is preserved at a university in London.

01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:16.360
If you killed a guy and put him in your university and his name happened to be Jeremy Bentham,

01:59:16.360 --> 01:59:19.360
I don't think that should count for points.

01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:21.360
Wait, so Ben, was that your guess?

01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:24.360
No, he's a noted moral philosopher as well.

01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:29.360
Oh, wait, but you knew both were correct, but you decided to...

01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:33.360
I didn't know which feature of Jeremy Bentham was the answer, but I knew who he was.

01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:38.360
Well, you must have known that no one was going to just riff that his body was preserved

01:59:38.360 --> 01:59:40.360
in a, I don't know, why am I yelling at you?

01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:42.360
We could dance at the college, dude.

01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:43.360
I didn't write that answer.

01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:44.360
That's the fault.

01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:45.360
Of course.

01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:47.360
He's the smartest person up here, man.

01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:49.360
He redesigns colleges, man.

01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:50.360
I know.

01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:53.360
Well, that's why it complicates Balderdash because if we didn't have him up there,

01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:56.360
we wouldn't know he was a noted moral philosopher,

01:59:56.360 --> 02:00:02.360
in which case Brandon and Ben both would have technically guessed right,

02:00:02.360 --> 02:00:06.360
but because Ben's up here, we know that Ben guessed right along with Brandon.

02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:07.360
I don't know how to score this.

02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:09.360
Well, who gave the right answer?

02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:10.360
Exactly.

02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:11.360
Who wrote it?

02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:13.360
You wrote spaghetti, right?

02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:14.360
Oh, oh, oh.

02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:16.360
I wrote the noted moral philosopher.

02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:19.360
So you get three points for having wrote written that answer.

02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:20.360
He was buried in the...

02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:23.360
And then you get two points for that, I think.

02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:24.360
Oh, I think we're tied.

02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:25.360
Right.

02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:27.360
So you were so familiar with Jeremy Bentham that you were like...

02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:30.360
But he chose my answer also.

02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:31.360
Oh, yeah.

02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:32.360
So I think you win.

02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:33.360
Oh, right.

02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:34.360
Okay.

02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:35.360
And that's how we treat guests anyway.

02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:36.360
Yeah.

02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:37.360
Yeah.

02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:38.360
You know what?

02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:39.360
Give him 900 points.

02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:40.360
Well, yeah.

02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:41.360
I think he gets seven points for the game.

02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:44.360
Ben Nelson has won Balderdash and America.

02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:46.360
That's going to go on my tombstone, I'm sure.

02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:48.360
Now, Ben, your prizes, you get to tell us.

02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:51.360
You get to spend the end of this podcast telling kids out there.

02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:53.360
And like, how do they...

02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:54.360
If they want to...

02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:57.360
If they're interested in what you've been talking about,

02:00:57.360 --> 02:00:59.360
like, where do they go?

02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:02.360
Dot com wise, geography wise.

02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:05.360
What do they do to get sucked into your...

02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:09.360
To your black hole of advancement?

02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:14.360
So if you are so inclined, you can just type Minerva into Google.

02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:15.360
It'll come up.

02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:17.360
But you can go to Minerva.

02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:18.360
M-I-N-E-R-V-A.

02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:19.360
M-I-N-E-R-V-A.

02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:20.360
That's how dumb we've become.

02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:21.360
M-I-N-E-R-V-A.

02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:24.360
Is that if you type the name of this Roman goddess into Google,

02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:28.360
the first thing that will come up is the guy who's using it for his educational program.

02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:31.360
Sometimes Wikipedia will outrank us.

02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:33.360
But we're one or two.

02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:34.360
She's Athena.

02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:36.360
She's the Roman version of Athena, right?

02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:39.360
She's the Roman version of Athena and the inspiration for our Constitution.

02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:41.360
So, and the goddess of wisdom.

02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:42.360
But so that...

02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:44.360
Yeah, just start Googling Minerva and the...

02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:46.360
Or go to MinervaProject.com.

02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:49.360
M-This is for people in particular who are like,

02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:51.360
like, look, man, I've had it.

02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:54.360
I want to participate in this moon raker project educationally.

02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:56.360
I want to become a super, super thinker.

02:01:56.360 --> 02:02:00.360
And, like, I don't trust the current system.

02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:02.360
Even whether or not I can afford it,

02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:08.360
it fucking is going to end with me in a drip pan of society or president.

02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:09.360
Yeah.

02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:14.360
These are people who believe that training your mind is as important as,

02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:17.360
you know, athletes think training their bodies are.

02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:19.360
So if you think that training your mind is important,

02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:20.360
Minerva's where you should be.

02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:21.360
Excellent.

02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:22.360
And Josh Andraski, we just brought back,

02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:24.360
because he was an awesome guest last time,

02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:27.360
and we actually, I want to have Josh back regularly just to tell us about shit

02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:29.360
that, like, would normally make us sad,

02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:31.360
but we're going to turn it into little games and things.

02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:33.360
But we didn't have a chance to do that this time.

02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:34.360
I'll be back.

02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:35.360
Thank you.

02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:36.360
I appreciate you coming back.

02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:39.360
And I appreciate you guys tangling and not dismissing each other,

02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:41.360
even though you had some disagreements.

02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:43.360
It was interesting to hear you guys talk.

02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:50.360
I felt like I might be an award worthy cable access host.

02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:57.360
I hear there's a certain PBS interview show that's now as a vacancy, so.

02:02:57.360 --> 02:02:58.360
Yeah.

02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:01.360
Thank you both for coming by and everybody out there.

02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:02.360
What did we learn this week?

02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:06.360
Give Andy Dick two minutes and.

02:03:06.360 --> 02:03:07.360
And he will break your heart.

02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:09.360
And he could change your life.

02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:12.360
At least add some lyrics.

02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:25.360
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:31.360
Thanks, come home on time, thanks for coming to see Dan down.

02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:35.360
So you guys laugh, but once Moby gets a hold of these recordings,

02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:38.360
he's going to add a beat, and this is going to,

02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:40.360
and Andy is going to be suing him.

02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:41.360
All right.

02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:42.880
Uh, well, thank you.

02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:44.880
John, literally, he pops his pimple.

02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:46.380
Joe.

02:03:46.380 --> 02:03:46.880
Shit.

02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:49.120
All right.

02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:51.040
Are we going out on, uh, we're going on a beat?

02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:54.520
Yeah, well, or, oh, well, I think we're, I mean, we're so done.

02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:55.640
We could just thank people.

02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:56.920
Do you have a list of people to thank?

02:03:56.920 --> 02:03:57.760
Do you have a written or any?

02:03:57.760 --> 02:03:59.000
I don't have a list of people to thank.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.320
I think you, I think you pretty much want to thank people, Dan.

02:04:00.320 --> 02:04:02.080
Off the top of my head, I would say,

02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:03.720
thank Kris Boruff for being the director.

02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:04.440
I love you, Kris Boruff.

02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:07.160
Thanks, Zac McKeever, for directing all the audio.

02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:10.440
Thanks, Sarah Hill, for doing a bunch of shit

02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:12.760
that we should probably have her up here and explain everything

02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:13.920
that she does.

02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:16.400
I keep, I keep, I keep dismissively saying she's the person

02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:17.720
that hands me all the titles.

02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:18.360
What about Steve Levy?

02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:20.640
Steve Levy's wandering around out there.

02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:22.800
Zach, the audio maniac.

02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:25.680
I do want to thank, we already thank Zach.

02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:29.240
I do want to thank Nolan, who continues

02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:31.600
to try to permit the, the castle so that we can have

02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:35.200
an audience back in every one day while, while wrangling everything.

02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:39.360
And, uh, and, and, and, and special thanks to Brian Baldinger.

02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:39.760
Yes.

02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:42.080
Or Baldinger, depending on whether you're from

02:04:42.080 --> 02:04:46.000
Norwegian or not, uh, for putting us in touch with Ben,

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.400
and, uh, um, uh, I don't know, who else?

02:04:49.400 --> 02:04:51.240
There's probably some interns that are, like,

02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:55.960
going to sue us later, and, oh, Andy Dick.

02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:57.920
Thank you, Andy Dick, for, thank you.

02:04:57.920 --> 02:05:06.080
I didn't think that's it, but, he's hitting a wood with a hammer

02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:08.320
for God's sake.

02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:10.560
Thank you, Andy Dick.

02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:12.040
Uh, we'll, we'll see you next week.

02:05:12.040 --> 02:05:13.480
It's going to be our Christmas episode.

02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:14.800
It's going to be amazing.

02:05:14.800 --> 02:05:15.960
I promise.

02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:19.240
We're going to simply have a wonderful Christmas time.

02:05:19.240 --> 02:05:19.760
Thank you.

02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:20.560
Good night.

02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:21.880
This is the end of Harmontown.

02:05:21.880 --> 02:05:23.000
I've been Brandon Johnson.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:24.080
We'll see you next week.

02:05:24.080 --> 02:05:26.280
Drive slow and don't take chances.

02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:44.760
Don't.

02:05:44.760 --> 02:05:47.240
Did you get any of that?

02:05:47.240 --> 02:05:48.560
It's a good show.

02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:55.560
Oh.
