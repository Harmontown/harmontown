00:43.000\nYou're on the side of good.\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:45.760\nI'm coming out and saying Jeff is not.\n\n00:45.760 --> 00:48.360\nIt's about time somebody really fucking pulled Jeff's strings.\n\n00:48.360 --> 00:48.860\nYeah.\n\n00:48.860 --> 00:50.880\nHe's not a good dude.\n\n00:50.880 --> 00:53.000\nI do know a really good dude, though.\n\n00:53.000 --> 00:56.640\nAnd he is the mayor of Harmontown.\n\n00:56.640 --> 00:57.520\nPut your hands together.\n\n00:57.520 --> 00:58.200\nMake some noise.\n\n00:58.200 --> 00:59.200\nDon't slap your dog.\n\n00:59.200 -->

beat.\n\n01:11.080 --> 01:13.120\nMy name is MC Rap Beat.\n\n01:13.120 --> 01:15.560\nI like to rap to the beat when I rap in the street.\n\n01:15.560 --> 01:18.080\nI like to rap with my hands and also my feet.\n\n01:18.080 --> 01:19.720\nI like to rap with a Tweety Bird.\n\n01:19.720 --> 01:21.320\nTweet, tweet, tweet.\n\n01:21.320 --> 01:23.360\nI like the snow in the sleep.\n\n01:23.360 --> 01:25.000\nDon't let it stop me, because I'm\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:29.520\nmailing the sheet to you through a rap shoe that I put on my foot\n\n01:29.520 --> 01:30.760\nwhen I bring it to you.\n\n01:30.760 --> 01:33.360\nI'm Mr. MC rapping a lot.\n\n01:33.360 --> 01:34.800\nI changed my name.\n\n01:34.800 --> 01:36.120\nMy name's MC Snot.\n\n01:36.120 --> 01:38.960\nMy name's MC Glapsalot.\n\n01:38.960 --> 01:40.960\nMy name is Polkadot.\n\n01:40.960 --> 01:43.600\nI'm a rapper, rapper, rapper, roo.\n\n01:43.600 --> 01:46.600\nI'm getting my energy up before the shoe starts.\n\n01:46.600 --> 01:47.400\nOK, all right, good.\n\n01:47.400 --> 01:47.760\nWhere we go?\n\n01:47.760 --> 01:49.600\nYeah.\n\n01:49.600 --> 01:52.320\nOh, boy.\n\n01:52.320 --> 01:54.760\nIt's important to have me off guard, flat-footed.\n\n01:54.760 --> 01:56.040\nYeah.\n\n01:56.040 --> 01:56.560\nHi, Brandon.\n\n01:56.560 --> 01:58.160\nThanks for guest-controlling, Brandon Johnson.\n\n01:58.160 --> 01:59.400\nSo happy to be here.\n\n01:59.400 --> 02:00.920\nI'm so sorry, Jeff Davis is gone.\n\n02:00.920 --> 02:02.200\nOh, where is he?\n\n02:02.200 --> 02:02.840\nI don't know.\n\n02:02.840 --> 02:04.640\nHe's going to India.\n\n02:04.640 --> 02:05.200\nNever mind.\n\n02:05.200 --> 02:06.080\nI don't know if he's there yet?\n\n02:06.080 --> 02:07.360\nYeah, I don't think he's there yet.\n\n02:07.360 --> 02:07.920\nToo baller.\n\n02:07.920 --> 02:09.560\nToo baller, man.\n\n02:09.560 --> 02:10.360\nHere's the never mind.\n\n02:10.360 --> 02:11.680\nHe's flying Emirates.\n\n02:11.680 --> 02:12.160\nWow.\n\n02:12.160 --> 02:13.280\nYeah, never mind.\n\n02:13.280 --> 02:14.160\nThat dude.\n\n02:14.160 --> 02:18.880\nLike he said he has a petting zoo in his section of the plane.\n\n02:18.880 --> 02:20.440\nBut I bet it's like two turtles.\n\n02:20.440 --> 02:23.320\nYeah, his life is what my life would be like if my parents\n\n02:23.320 --> 02:26.520\nwould love me.\n\n02:26.520 --> 02:30.800\nI don't know if that's how he got there.\n\n02:30.800 --> 02:33.320\nMaybe like the indirect result of Drew Carey's parents\n\n02:33.320 --> 02:36.120\nreally not loving him a lot and trickled down.\n\n02:36.120 --> 02:36.600\nWho know?\n\n02:36.600 --> 02:40.760\nWe have no idea who to thank or let's just thank.\n\n02:40.760 --> 02:43.840\nLet's just thank the god of privilege, privilege.\n\n02:43.840 --> 02:44.520\nThat's the name.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:51.960\nWhatever.\n\n02:51.960 --> 02:53.080\nHow have you been?\n\n02:53.080 --> 02:54.040\nI never ask about you.\n\n02:54.040 --> 02:54.760\nI've been good.\n\n02:54.760 --> 02:55.320\nI've been good.\n\n02:55.320 --> 02:56.680\nThere's not much to tell.\n\n02:56.680 --> 02:57.720\nSeven dry cleaners.\n\n02:57.720 --> 03:00.160\nI keep everything legit.\n\n03:00.160 --> 03:01.840\nMy maid won't seem to do her work.\n\n03:01.840 --> 03:04.800\nBut other than that, life is good.\n\n03:04.800 --> 03:07.240\nIf those are the only jigsaw pieces you have a Brandon's\n\n03:07.240 --> 03:10.160\nlife, that could be anything.\n\n03:10.160 --> 03:12.520\nSeven dry cleaners are made that won't.\n\n03:12.520 --> 03:14.760\nWe don't know if he's in a giant mansion\n\n03:14.760 --> 03:18.120\nor a tiny William Gibson techno coffin.\n\n03:18.120 --> 03:21.920\nPretty sure it's a deluxe apartment in the sky.\n\n03:21.920 --> 03:22.960\nMoving on up.\n\n03:22.960 --> 03:25.480\nWhat was the thing in the Jefferson's theme?\n\n03:25.480 --> 03:28.320\nIt was that beans don't burn in the kitchen?\n\n03:28.320 --> 03:28.880\nThat's right.\n\n03:28.880 --> 03:31.680\nAnd what doesn't burn on a grill?\n\n03:31.680 --> 03:34.760\nI think it's something else doesn't burn on the grill.\n\n03:34.760 --> 03:36.720\nSomething else doesn't burn on a grill.\n\n03:36.720 --> 03:37.600\nI have to get the whole thing out of my head.\n\n03:37.600 --> 03:40.040\nAre you offended that I'm coming to you for the answer to this?\n\n03:40.040 --> 03:40.280\nNo, no.\n\n03:40.280 --> 03:41.400\nIt's a mystery to all people.\n\n03:41.400 --> 03:42.160\nRight.\n\n03:42.160 --> 03:45.040\nThis is a, I've been asking Brandon as a representative\n\n03:45.040 --> 03:47.640\nof the 70s, not anything else.\n\n03:47.640 --> 03:49.880\nThis is going to be, I feel so bad because so many people\n\n03:49.880 --> 03:52.680\nare on Reddit are going to be like, oh!\n\n03:52.680 --> 03:53.800\nWhat's this?\n\n03:53.800 --> 03:54.880\nThey need that though.\n\n03:54.880 --> 03:56.480\nThey need that more than we do.\n\n03:56.480 --> 03:59.120\nI think they might be calming down now though.\n\n03:59.120 --> 03:59.840\nI don't know.\n\n03:59.840 --> 04:01.200\nNah.\n\n04:01.200 --> 04:02.960\nIt's funny how we have moods and our moods\n\n04:02.960 --> 04:04.160\naffect our perception of the world.\n\n04:04.160 --> 04:07.240\nLike right now I feel like the world is more comfortable\n\n04:07.240 --> 04:07.840\nwith racism.\n\n04:07.840 --> 04:09.400\nWhere did I get that?\n\n04:09.400 --> 04:10.480\nWhy did I decide that?\n\n04:10.480 --> 04:12.520\nWhat did I, it's nothing, it's the answer\n\n04:12.520 --> 04:13.560\nis it's something I ate.\n\n04:13.560 --> 04:15.200\nIt's like not, it's not something I saw.\n\n04:15.200 --> 04:17.040\nI didn't see somebody come out with a report on Reddit\n\n04:17.040 --> 04:18.920\nthat said we're going to be less sensitive now.\n\n04:18.920 --> 04:20.800\nI think it's because of an epiphany I had.\n\n04:20.800 --> 04:23.640\nI was eating breakfast with my girlfriend and her dad.\n\n04:23.640 --> 04:27.480\nAnd I don't know, I don't know what got my mind on to it.\n\n04:27.480 --> 04:30.200\nBut then I just started realizing this thing about\n\n04:30.200 --> 04:32.680\nepiphanies about like how you really,\n\n04:32.680 --> 04:35.320\nI don't know, the good ones are just like dodoys.\n\n04:35.320 --> 04:37.680\nThey're not, when you explain them they're like, yeah,\n\n04:37.680 --> 04:39.960\nI had that epiphany when I was 13.\n\n04:39.960 --> 04:43.160\nBut and I've had this one I feel several times.\n\n04:43.160 --> 04:45.240\nBut I really, there's a difference between that\n\n04:45.240 --> 04:45.880\nand feeling it.\n\n04:45.880 --> 04:48.840\nI really started to feel at breakfast\n\n04:48.840 --> 04:51.360\nbecause I pulled out my phone and I wrote it down.\n\n04:51.360 --> 04:54.280\nIt was a hashtag epiphany in my bear notes app.\n\n04:54.280 --> 04:58.960\nLike I got to remember this epiphany, which was just that.\n\n04:58.960 --> 05:00.800\nWait, what's bear notes app?\n\n05:00.800 --> 05:03.440\nIt's my latest app I'm trying.\n\n05:03.440 --> 05:04.320\nSorry, continue.\n\n05:04.320 --> 05:07.040\nBear, you can look it up in the App Store.\n\n05:07.040 --> 05:11.440\nIt's based on tags, tag clouds instead of, it's weird.\n\n05:11.440 --> 05:12.320\nIt's weird at first.\n\n05:12.320 --> 05:14.440\nBut if you get used to it, it could be good.\n\n05:14.440 --> 05:15.120\nI don't know.\n\n05:15.120 --> 05:16.480\nWhy did I keel on that?\n\n05:16.480 --> 05:18.880\nI don't know.\n\n05:18.880 --> 05:20.120\nHere's my epiphany.\n\n05:20.120 --> 05:24.720\nSo if you are a machine or let's say an organism,\n\n05:24.720 --> 05:25.760\nit really doesn't matter.\n\n05:25.760 --> 05:26.720\nOrganisms are machines.\n\n05:30.880 --> 05:32.000\nYou're a structure.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:33.800\nYou have internal mechanisms.\n\n05:33.800 --> 05:34.680\nYou are capable.\n\n05:34.680 --> 05:36.160\nYou take things in.\n\n05:36.160 --> 05:37.760\nAnd you put things out.\n\n05:37.760 --> 05:40.320\nAnd so flowers do that.\n\n05:40.320 --> 05:41.400\nWhales do that.\n\n05:41.400 --> 05:42.720\nThe earth does that.\n\n05:42.720 --> 05:43.880\nEvery system does that.\n\n05:43.880 --> 05:45.120\nEvery device does that.\n\n05:45.120 --> 05:48.480\nWe're all just systems, each of us individually.\n\n05:48.480 --> 05:51.560\nSo we take in good shit.\n\n05:51.560 --> 05:52.920\nWe take in bad shit.\n\n05:52.920 --> 05:54.760\nAnd we're all different.\n\n05:54.760 --> 05:58.920\nSo there's different shit that's bad to every person.\n\n05:58.920 --> 06:02.840\nIf somebody says the N word on the freeway at me,\n\n06:02.840 --> 06:05.120\nit makes me confused.\n\n06:05.120 --> 06:07.040\nIt made something different to you.\n\n06:07.040 --> 06:09.760\nIt's both bad things coming out of that person.\n\n06:09.760 --> 06:15.600\nBut I go for there's a lot of weird confusion\n\n06:15.600 --> 06:16.560\nat the top of that.\n\n06:16.560 --> 06:19.360\nMy process is I'm like, is there lighting weird in my car?\n\n06:19.360 --> 06:20.800\nWhat's with this person?\n\n06:20.800 --> 06:22.440\nAre they blind?\n\n06:22.440 --> 06:24.160\nI don't know.\n\n06:24.160 --> 06:25.520\nAre they on my side?\n\n06:25.520 --> 06:26.840\nAnd are they black?\n\n06:26.840 --> 06:30.440\nAnd they're like high-fiving me for my awesome driving.\n\n06:33.480 --> 06:39.160\nSo the definition of what a bad thing is is subjective.\n\n06:39.160 --> 06:42.360\nIt's not about like, oh, some people\n\n06:42.360 --> 06:45.960\nare in such a good mood that I listen to podcasts\n\n06:45.960 --> 06:48.120\nwhere there's people that they have problems\n\n06:48.120 --> 06:50.400\nand there's people that want to help them with their problems.\n\n06:50.400 --> 06:53.960\nSo for those people, what you and I would consider toxic,\n\n06:53.960 --> 06:57.040\nthat person considers an episode of a podcast.\n\n06:57.040 --> 06:59.720\nSo not to get too derailed with that,\n\n06:59.720 --> 07:03.840\nbut the larger point being you have all this shit that\n\n07:03.840 --> 07:05.080\ncomes at you.\n\n07:05.080 --> 07:08.280\nAnd it's all good and bad mixed up shit.\n\n07:08.280 --> 07:12.880\nAnd then we all have the ability as systems to, first of all,\n\n07:12.880 --> 07:15.160\nwe're constantly growing and reprogramming ourselves,\n\n07:15.160 --> 07:18.680\nrestructuring ourselves, just as cells and plants\n\n07:18.680 --> 07:21.200\nand factories and us.\n\n07:21.200 --> 07:24.600\nAnd this stuff comes in.\n\n07:24.600 --> 07:26.720\nSo we, first of all, the miracles\n\n07:26.720 --> 07:30.520\nthat we do have the ability to take in diarrhea,\n\n07:30.520 --> 07:34.480\nnot literally, but verbal diarrhea,\n\n07:34.480 --> 07:35.720\nsuch as I'm spouting right now.\n\n07:35.720 --> 07:38.360\nOr really horrible toxic, horrible shit,\n\n07:38.360 --> 07:40.880\nlike what you see on Facebook or Twitter.\n\n07:40.880 --> 07:41.600\nToxicity.\n\n07:41.600 --> 07:43.400\nOr someone attacking you in a comment section\n\n07:43.400 --> 07:48.640\nbecause you said something wrong or bad shit.\n\n07:48.640 --> 07:54.840\nWe have the ability to turn it into good shit,\n\n07:54.840 --> 07:57.720\nthe classic example being that if I have a terrible life,\n\n07:57.720 --> 08:02.000\nif everybody picks on me, if I feel awful,\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:04.360\nif I have feelings of anxiety and depression and things,\n\n08:04.360 --> 08:06.480\nbecause of the shit that's happening to me in my life,\n\n08:06.480 --> 08:08.240\nbut then I write a play about it.\n\n08:08.240 --> 08:10.360\nAnd then everyone goes and sees the play\n\n08:10.360 --> 08:13.120\nand walks out feeling really good.\n\n08:13.120 --> 08:14.880\nNot because it's a feel good play,\n\n08:14.880 --> 08:16.680\nbut because they saw a good play.\n\n08:16.680 --> 08:19.240\nLike there's catharsis, like you can see a depressing play\n\n08:19.240 --> 08:21.040\nand be like, wow, he fucking nailed it.\n\n08:21.040 --> 08:22.480\nHe knows exactly how depressed I am.\n\n08:22.480 --> 08:24.600\nAnd then some of your depression comes out.\n\n08:24.600 --> 08:27.000\nThe bottom line being, as we all know,\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:29.280\nyou can take in bad stuff and you can put out good stuff.\n\n08:29.280 --> 08:32.880\nAnd in fact, that's kind of what we try to do all the time.\n\n08:32.880 --> 08:38.200\nSo now that times have gotten, for most of us,\n\n08:38.200 --> 08:42.120\nvery challenging, there's a lot of shit in the air.\n\n08:42.120 --> 08:44.200\nThere's a lot of bad stuff coming at us.\n\n08:44.200 --> 08:46.640\nIt's just sort of sitting at breakfast\n\n08:46.640 --> 08:49.200\nand just thinking about all these podcasts I've\n\n08:49.200 --> 08:51.360\nbeen listening to where people do like they just,\n\n08:51.360 --> 08:53.000\nI don't have this shit that rolls off their back\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:54.000\nthat I find amazing.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:55.680\nI was like, how come you don't just tell that person\n\n08:55.680 --> 08:56.560\nto go fuck themselves?\n\n08:56.560 --> 09:00.520\nLike why are you trying to still understand this person\n\n09:00.520 --> 09:03.040\nand help them with their in-laws for your little podcast?\n\n09:03.040 --> 09:04.200\nIt's not just greed.\n\n09:04.200 --> 09:06.080\nIt's like you're Canadian or something.\n\n09:06.080 --> 09:07.680\nLike, I don't know what it is.\n\n09:07.680 --> 09:10.880\nI guess I should promote the podcast I'm describing.\n\n09:10.880 --> 09:14.880\nIt's on the Gimlet network.\n\n09:14.880 --> 09:16.960\nIt's called Heavyweight.\n\n09:16.960 --> 09:19.880\nIt's this guy, John, something.\n\n09:19.880 --> 09:23.480\nAnd he just makes his friends and family's business,\n\n09:23.480 --> 09:24.400\nall his business.\n\n09:24.400 --> 09:25.880\nAnd he's like a really friendly guy.\n\n09:25.880 --> 09:31.240\nHe tries to resolve long, unresolved issues,\n\n09:31.240 --> 09:33.840\nfamily members that aren't speaking to each other for decades.\n\n09:33.840 --> 09:35.120\nAre they on the show?\n\n09:35.120 --> 09:38.360\nYeah, the person, a friend or a relative or someone\n\n09:38.360 --> 09:40.880\nthat he knows will come to him with something\n\n09:40.880 --> 09:42.040\nthat's been weighing on them.\n\n09:42.040 --> 09:43.440\nI think that's why it's called Heavyweight.\n\n09:43.440 --> 09:46.000\nAnd then he'll just get up all in there shit\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.440\nand make phone calls and arrange meetings.\n\n09:48.440 --> 09:52.480\nAnd I was just kind of marveling at the guys.\n\n09:52.480 --> 09:53.800\nBecause there's people that attack him.\n\n09:53.800 --> 09:55.400\nThere's people that criticize him.\n\n09:55.400 --> 09:59.680\nThere's people that are engaged in vampiric toxicity\n\n09:59.680 --> 10:00.600\ntowards him or shit.\n\n10:00.600 --> 10:02.600\nLike, his famous episode is the one\n\n10:02.600 --> 10:08.400\nwhere a friend of his who is a guy who gave Moby all\n\n10:08.400 --> 10:12.760\nof those black people LPs that Moby used to launch us\n\n10:12.760 --> 10:15.840\nand to become a billionaire.\n\n10:15.840 --> 10:21.800\nLike, oh, I don't got a fish bone on my plate.\n\n10:21.800 --> 10:25.000\nAnd then Moby, the guy that gave\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:29.960\nthat disc set to him or whatever, is also a musician.\n\n10:29.960 --> 10:33.680\nBut he's not Moby, and he's not actively.\n\n10:33.680 --> 10:36.720\nSo there's a whole episode about him wanting to just basically\n\n10:36.720 --> 10:39.280\nget near, talk to Moby again.\n\n10:39.280 --> 10:47.040\nAnd it was weird, and it was awkward, and this guy that\n\n10:47.040 --> 10:51.360\ngets involved in this shit, he actively gallops into shit\n\n10:51.360 --> 10:53.640\nthat I would be like, no, fuck that.\n\n10:53.640 --> 10:56.640\nNope, nope, nope.\n\n10:56.640 --> 10:58.760\nAnd so I was sitting at breakfast kind of like digesting,\n\n10:58.760 --> 11:00.800\nhaving binge listened to this guy's podcast.\n\n11:00.800 --> 11:04.880\nAnd I just like, I am a bad person.\n\n11:04.880 --> 11:07.640\nI should be after all I have gotten after all.\n\n11:07.640 --> 11:08.880\nIt's like, why am I still fucking?\n\n11:08.880 --> 11:12.280\nWhy am I so sensitive if this guy isn't?\n\n11:12.280 --> 11:16.240\nAnd I was like, wait, well, sensitivity, he's sensitive too.\n\n11:16.240 --> 11:19.640\nAnd I was like, ah, sensitivity is different\n\n11:19.640 --> 11:22.720\nfrom fucking systemic shutdown.\n\n11:22.720 --> 11:27.680\nYou can be sensitive to garbage.\n\n11:27.680 --> 11:30.880\nYou can be like, that guy's lying, that guy's racist,\n\n11:30.880 --> 11:33.400\nthat guy's full of shit, that guy's kind of full of shit,\n\n11:33.400 --> 11:35.640\nbut trying to convince himself he's not full of shit.\n\n11:35.640 --> 11:39.960\nSo you can have a really laser resolution of bullshit\n\n11:39.960 --> 11:42.960\ndetection, and that person wants something from me,\n\n11:42.960 --> 11:47.200\nthat person's a drag, that person's an energy drain.\n\n11:47.200 --> 11:49.000\nBut you don't need to.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:51.920\nIt's not a superior machine that recognizes that shit,\n\n11:51.920 --> 11:54.840\nand then in response to anything less than perfect,\n\n11:54.840 --> 11:57.080\nit goes, pew.\n\n11:57.080 --> 12:00.320\nAnd that's kind of what we're doing probably a little too\n\n12:00.320 --> 12:03.760\nmuch of, is going like, oh, no, no, no.\n\n12:03.760 --> 12:05.600\nYou just said that, and nope.\n\n12:08.720 --> 12:12.000\nThat either makes me blow a whistle that shrieks\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:14.680\nat the top at 1,000 decibels.\n\n12:14.680 --> 12:20.880\nIs that, if that's your function, that's good.\n\n12:20.880 --> 12:22.920\nYou should stay that sensitive, and you should then\n\n12:22.920 --> 12:25.440\nbe the alarm person.\n\n12:25.440 --> 12:29.680\nBut if you're not that person, if that's not\n\n12:29.680 --> 12:31.840\nyour full function, if you're not helping things\n\n12:31.840 --> 12:35.040\nby blowing that alarm, or if it's not making you personally\n\n12:35.040 --> 12:37.680\nhappy too, use the other shit you could do with all that stuff\n\n12:37.680 --> 12:39.080\ncoming into you too.\n\n12:39.080 --> 12:39.560\nI don't know.\n\n12:39.560 --> 12:43.080\nThere's this thing, the Jerusalem, the Trump\n\n12:43.080 --> 12:44.160\nannouncement that he's going to make.\n\n12:44.160 --> 12:49.280\nSee, he took a bad thing, and he made a wonderful, go on.\n\n12:49.280 --> 12:51.320\nWhere he announced that he's going to move the US Embassy\n\n12:51.320 --> 12:54.000\nto Jerusalem and make a big hubbub.\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:57.360\nAnd the world has freaked out about it.\n\n12:57.360 --> 12:59.080\nThis is to your point.\n\n12:59.080 --> 13:01.520\nBut the truth is, it takes years for that to occur.\n\n13:01.520 --> 13:03.720\nHe has to get funding, architects have to draw up plans.\n\n13:03.720 --> 13:06.160\nBut people are acting like he's going to do this within the next\n\n13:06.160 --> 13:06.880\nweek.\n\n13:06.880 --> 13:08.720\nAnd that's sort of how we've gotten.\n\n13:08.720 --> 13:10.920\nWe've gotten to this place where he says something.\n\n13:10.920 --> 13:11.760\nSomebody said something.\n\n13:11.760 --> 13:13.640\nWe hear something, and we automatically\n\n13:13.640 --> 13:16.800\nfreak out, not really looking back and being like,\n\n13:16.800 --> 13:20.560\nwell, no girl scout is going to join the Boy Scouts.\n\n13:20.560 --> 13:23.600\nThe Boy Scouts just said girls could join.\n\n13:23.600 --> 13:26.120\nAnd it's because we started off the year\n\n13:26.120 --> 13:29.920\nso hypersensitive, which is a reaction to any trauma,\n\n13:29.920 --> 13:31.840\nthat now when we hear it's raining,\n\n13:31.840 --> 13:33.800\nwe legitimately are like, well, it's probably\n\n13:33.800 --> 13:35.000\ngoing to be one of those rains.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:36.400\nSo you're exactly right.\n\n13:36.400 --> 13:39.800\nI think to our credit, if we are on the left,\n\n13:39.800 --> 13:44.120\nI don't think we're actually, I think a lot of that is like,\n\n13:44.120 --> 13:49.000\nwe're just so frustrated waiting for a referee\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:51.120\nto blow a whistle that we're just like,\n\n13:51.120 --> 13:56.560\nour booze are getting louder, and we're just incredulous.\n\n13:56.560 --> 13:59.680\nAnd we just want, we want at any moment, we're like, well,\n\n13:59.680 --> 14:03.000\nmaybe this is the thing, because this is like holy land.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.960\nThis is none of his business.\n\n14:05.960 --> 14:08.000\nI remember in the beginning, there was a whole buffet set\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:08.400\nout there.\n\n14:08.400 --> 14:10.600\nI would sit there on Twitter and write these threads,\n\n14:10.600 --> 14:14.480\nbecause I was trying to make my religious relatives\n\n14:14.480 --> 14:16.320\nor people that were Christian.\n\n14:16.320 --> 14:20.000\nI was trying to go like, he missed that prayer breakfast\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:20.440\nor whatever.\n\n14:20.440 --> 14:22.040\nRemember when that was a big deal?\n\n14:22.040 --> 14:24.400\nAnd I was like, aha, so he missed a prayer breakfast.\n\n14:24.400 --> 14:26.880\nNow, I ask you this, is this man a Christian?\n\n14:26.880 --> 14:31.960\nBut I was really just like, all we've been doing ever since\n\n14:31.960 --> 14:34.720\nis we're just trying to find his off switch.\n\n14:34.720 --> 14:37.000\nNow, our trying to find his off switch\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:38.960\nis really making us flail a lot.\n\n14:38.960 --> 14:42.160\nAnd I think we should continue to try to find his off switch.\n\n14:42.160 --> 14:44.280\nBut I think we should explore more sides of him\n\n14:44.280 --> 14:46.440\nthan, obviously, the front-facing side,\n\n14:46.440 --> 14:48.480\nbecause I don't think Donald Trump puts his off switch\n\n14:48.480 --> 14:51.160\non his front-facing side.\n\n14:51.160 --> 14:54.760\nI think he, but more importantly, I mean,\n\n14:54.760 --> 14:56.600\ngoing back to my mechanism metaphor,\n\n14:56.600 --> 15:00.120\nclearly this is a man running on our tears.\n\n15:00.120 --> 15:07.840\nI mean, we are putting out terror and sadness and outrage.\n\n15:07.840 --> 15:11.680\nAnd it is fueling him.\n\n15:11.680 --> 15:12.440\nAnd that's fine.\n\n15:12.440 --> 15:15.200\nThat doesn't mean to stop being outraged,\n\n15:15.200 --> 15:16.000\nstop crying.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:17.000\nThat doesn't mean go numb.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:20.120\nIt just means we know that he's already playing the game\n\n15:20.120 --> 15:20.880\nI'm describing.\n\n15:20.880 --> 15:25.240\nHe's a long time ago, either by virtue of sociopathology\n\n15:25.240 --> 15:27.560\nor some epiphany of his own he had.\n\n15:27.560 --> 15:30.920\nHe was like, well, why should I keep on?\n\n15:30.920 --> 15:34.400\nWhat am I supposed to shut down every time my mom yells at me?\n\n15:34.400 --> 15:36.520\nAm I supposed to shut down every time my dad punches\n\n15:36.520 --> 15:38.640\nmy mom in front of me and looks at me and says,\n\n15:38.640 --> 15:40.480\nif you cry, then you're a woman like her?\n\n15:40.480 --> 15:42.600\nYeah, I'm just speculating the kind of childhood he probably\n\n15:42.600 --> 15:44.160\nhad given his current pathology.\n\n15:44.160 --> 15:47.640\nI took a little bit of psych in high school.\n\n15:47.640 --> 15:48.880\nI think something blue.\n\n15:48.880 --> 15:50.560\nCollege prep?\n\n15:50.560 --> 15:51.440\nWhat's that?\n\n15:51.440 --> 15:53.000\nCollege prep psychology?\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:55.480\nYeah, I think it was worth a college credit, possibly.\n\n15:55.480 --> 15:56.120\nYeah.\n\n15:56.120 --> 15:58.400\nYeah, but I mean, this is Milwaukee Public Schools.\n\n15:58.400 --> 16:01.560\nI don't think that, or no, it's Brown Deer.\n\n16:01.560 --> 16:04.520\nAll right, look, don't write letters.\n\n16:04.520 --> 16:05.160\nI'm not a fraud.\n\n16:05.160 --> 16:06.720\nLook into my transcripts.\n\n16:06.720 --> 16:08.120\nNo, you had a class in high school.\n\n16:08.120 --> 16:09.080\nI took a psych class.\n\n16:09.080 --> 16:10.640\nYeah, in high school.\n\n16:10.640 --> 16:12.960\nI believe it was probably worth a college credit.\n\n16:12.960 --> 16:13.800\nNo.\n\n16:13.800 --> 16:14.640\nOK, it probably wasn't.\n\n16:14.640 --> 16:18.320\nOK, they showed us many, many slideshows about things\n\n16:18.320 --> 16:20.040\nlike gestalt.\n\n16:20.040 --> 16:20.540\nRight.\n\n16:24.040 --> 16:26.160\nI took that class, too.\n\n16:26.160 --> 16:30.520\nSo anyways, this guy, either because he's a monster\n\n16:30.520 --> 16:33.360\nor because he's not even going to say the words, I guess I am,\n\n16:33.360 --> 16:40.560\nthat he's like more evolved, like in that respect,\n\n16:40.560 --> 16:42.960\nthat he's like, well, what are you supposed to do?\n\n16:42.960 --> 16:45.400\nAre you supposed to shut down when someone\n\n16:45.400 --> 16:47.120\nsays you're a racist douchebag?\n\n16:47.120 --> 16:48.920\nAre you supposed to take that information in\n\n16:48.920 --> 16:50.960\nand through a elaborate system of mirror turn it\n\n16:50.960 --> 16:53.640\ninto fucking Trump food and eat it?\n\n16:53.640 --> 16:54.640\nAnd that's what he's done.\n\n16:54.640 --> 16:57.520\nHe's like, yes, I'm hearing I'm racist again.\n\n16:57.520 --> 17:00.080\nI call that a victory.\n\n17:00.080 --> 17:02.040\nHe's generating victory for himself.\n\n17:02.040 --> 17:03.280\nI don't want to comment.\n\n17:03.280 --> 17:04.880\nI don't want to be his life coach.\n\n17:04.880 --> 17:08.880\nBut most of us aren't dealing with him personally\n\n17:08.880 --> 17:09.720\non a day-to-day basis.\n\n17:09.720 --> 17:12.320\nAnd what we are dealing with is mostly for better or for worse,\n\n17:12.320 --> 17:14.160\nwe're dealing with people digitally.\n\n17:14.160 --> 17:17.520\nAnd so I just have this epiphany in my head\n\n17:17.520 --> 17:22.320\nwhere I'm like, I have been too defensive, too fucking like,\n\n17:22.320 --> 17:24.800\nit's like if someone is feeding into you,\n\n17:24.800 --> 17:26.560\nthey're going like, hey, you're fat.\n\n17:26.560 --> 17:28.000\nSeason six of Community Sucked.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:30.240\nSeason three of Rick and Morty Sucked.\n\n17:30.240 --> 17:34.880\nYou're a cuck, you're, again, with the fat.\n\n17:34.880 --> 17:39.840\nI can't, people aren't really that, I don't know.\n\n17:39.840 --> 17:44.120\nThey give you chemicals and a little line\n\n17:44.120 --> 17:45.560\nthat they've stuck into you.\n\n17:45.560 --> 17:46.720\nYou're receiving it.\n\n17:46.720 --> 17:48.360\nAnd then you just take it in.\n\n17:48.360 --> 17:49.120\nYou process it.\n\n17:49.120 --> 17:56.880\nThere is like, if somebody says, we should make America great\n\n17:56.880 --> 18:01.120\nagain by getting rid of all the brown people,\n\n18:01.120 --> 18:04.600\nyou could process that and go, I think it's great\n\n18:04.600 --> 18:05.720\nthat you think America's great.\n\n18:05.720 --> 18:06.720\nI love America, too.\n\n18:06.720 --> 18:08.720\nOh.\n\n18:08.720 --> 18:11.280\nHa ha ha ha.\n\n18:11.280 --> 18:11.840\nNow.\n\n18:11.840 --> 18:13.600\nI'm pretty sure you're talking to a person\n\n18:13.600 --> 18:16.440\nwith a mental disability.\n\n18:16.440 --> 18:19.000\nAnd at which point, to continue to take what they're saying\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:19.800\nseriously.\n\n18:19.800 --> 18:22.640\nWell, no, we're not, we're not, we're not trying.\n\n18:22.640 --> 18:24.160\nWe're not wasting time on this person.\n\n18:24.160 --> 18:25.960\nYou're correct to correct me on that.\n\n18:25.960 --> 18:28.760\nOnce someone calls people brown people,\n\n18:28.760 --> 18:29.560\nI'm pretty much like, oh, no.\n\n18:29.560 --> 18:30.840\nI didn't know those were my words.\n\n18:30.840 --> 18:33.040\nI don't know this person, but.\n\n18:33.040 --> 18:34.480\nThis motherfucker hates math.\n\n18:34.480 --> 18:36.080\nYou first and foremost, you're correct about that.\n\n18:36.080 --> 18:37.680\nWe're not going to get in arguments with these people.\n\n18:37.680 --> 18:39.200\nWe're not going to try to change them.\n\n18:39.200 --> 18:42.080\nBut, but, but, you know, what we're finding, I think,\n\n18:42.080 --> 18:45.800\nis that these people, when we do the other thing besides\n\n18:45.800 --> 18:49.640\ntry to change them, which is like, like, just kind of like,\n\n18:49.640 --> 18:51.640\nfucking like, I don't know, whatever you call it.\n\n18:51.640 --> 18:54.200\nLike, sometimes, a lot of times, I just block them.\n\n18:54.200 --> 18:56.360\nI don't know, they might be getting energy from that.\n\n18:56.360 --> 18:57.200\nThey are.\n\n18:57.200 --> 18:59.040\nYeah, you should mute them instead.\n\n18:59.040 --> 18:59.880\nThey don't know.\n\n18:59.880 --> 19:02.520\nYeah, but if you mute them and they directly tweet you,\n\n19:02.520 --> 19:04.080\nthe mute is not, not function.\n\n19:04.080 --> 19:05.800\nNot anymore.\n\n19:05.800 --> 19:06.840\nThey upgraded the mute button?\n\n19:06.840 --> 19:09.040\nAs far as I understand, I've never seen anything\n\n19:09.040 --> 19:11.480\nfrom a muted person unless I saw it out.\n\n19:11.480 --> 19:12.840\nBut it used to be like that.\n\n19:12.840 --> 19:13.680\nThat's what I do now.\n\n19:13.680 --> 19:16.720\nNow I have like 1,000 muted people.\n\n19:16.720 --> 19:20.680\nAt one point, I had 9-11 muted people.\n\n19:20.680 --> 19:24.720\nI would just mute, I would go through and mute everyone\n\n19:24.720 --> 19:29.680\nand then unmute you, Elon Musk.\n\n19:29.680 --> 19:30.400\nPeople do that.\n\n19:30.400 --> 19:33.960\nAnd yeah, like my girlfriend or whatever, you know,\n\n19:33.960 --> 19:35.920\nlike, and that would be called, I guess, Facebook?\n\n19:35.920 --> 19:38.960\nOr like, yeah, pretty much.\n\n19:38.960 --> 19:39.680\nAll right, well.\n\n19:39.680 --> 19:43.240\nThere is a little bit, you're correct about the overload.\n\n19:43.240 --> 19:45.680\nThere's a bit of an overload and we are reacting now\n\n19:45.680 --> 19:48.160\ninstinctually without really, you know.\n\n19:48.160 --> 19:49.840\nI think we're getting more signals.\n\n19:49.840 --> 19:52.840\nAnd if, in general, and if more signals are bad\n\n19:52.840 --> 19:54.720\nand we're used to less signals and now we're\n\n19:54.720 --> 19:56.880\ngetting more bad signals, we're going to kind of\n\n19:56.880 --> 19:57.920\nfrazzle to some extent, right?\n\n19:57.920 --> 20:00.080\nYeah, it's tough because you start,\n\n20:00.080 --> 20:02.800\nyou want to, the accurate language you use now\n\n20:02.800 --> 20:04.360\nall has all these horrible connotations.\n\n20:04.360 --> 20:05.760\nBecause I want to use a word like trigger.\n\n20:05.760 --> 20:08.200\nAnd I want to say like, in other words, kids,\n\n20:08.200 --> 20:12.760\nif a stranger has the ability to trigger you\n\n20:12.760 --> 20:19.760\ninto negative behavior, are you a superior machine?\n\n20:19.760 --> 20:22.760\nAre you a superior machine to the triggering machine?\n\n20:22.760 --> 20:25.760\nOr are you losing a fucking AI battle?\n\n20:25.760 --> 20:29.760\nYou know, if someone has the ability to shut you down,\n\n20:29.760 --> 20:35.760\nto make you numb, to make you simply scream at the top\n\n20:35.760 --> 20:38.760\nof your lungs and point at the thing and say,\n\n20:38.760 --> 20:40.760\nbad thing, bad thing.\n\n20:40.760 --> 20:42.760\nThere's gray areas here.\n\n20:42.760 --> 20:44.760\nI don't want to say that any of those things are\n\n20:44.760 --> 20:46.760\nnecessarily inappropriate responses.\n\n20:46.760 --> 20:51.760\nBut I'm going to start asking myself the question like,\n\n20:51.760 --> 20:54.760\nwell, do I want to be a superior machine or not?\n\n20:54.760 --> 20:56.760\nA superior machine is like, I'm taking in a little bit\n\n20:56.760 --> 20:58.760\nof nitrogen, a little bit of oxygen,\n\n20:58.760 --> 21:00.760\na little bit of carbon dioxide, a little bit of carbon monoxide,\n\n21:00.760 --> 21:02.760\na little bit of aluminum.\n\n21:02.760 --> 21:06.760\nIt's all this person just saying some random fucking\n\n21:06.760 --> 21:09.760\nsecond amendment, like a justifying thing,\n\n21:09.760 --> 21:11.760\nor he's a flat earth or he just doesn't like me\n\n21:11.760 --> 21:12.760\nbecause I'm fatter.\n\n21:12.760 --> 21:15.760\nI said something bad about Jim Henson once.\n\n21:15.760 --> 21:17.760\nAnd they're just trolling me or they're just like\n\n21:17.760 --> 21:18.760\nbarfing up on me.\n\n21:18.760 --> 21:22.760\nIt's like, the barf, if I'm a superior machine,\n\n21:22.760 --> 21:24.760\nthere's, even if it's one part per billion,\n\n21:24.760 --> 21:26.760\nthere's like nutrition in the barf.\n\n21:26.760 --> 21:29.760\nAnd I just put it in my little barf processing stomachs.\n\n21:29.760 --> 21:30.760\nYeah, like dogs.\n\n21:30.760 --> 21:32.760\nAnd then the rest passes through me.\n\n21:32.760 --> 21:34.760\nWell, no-ish.\n\n21:34.760 --> 21:37.760\nSo you don't want the, if it's a white suit,\n\n21:37.760 --> 21:39.760\neverybody's born with a beautiful white suit.\n\n21:39.760 --> 21:40.760\nWe all get our white suits.\n\n21:40.760 --> 21:41.760\nIt's three-piece, it's gorgeous.\n\n21:41.760 --> 21:43.760\nYou want to try and keep it clean?\n\n21:43.760 --> 21:45.760\nYou want to try and take care of it,\n\n21:45.760 --> 21:46.760\ndry clean it when it needs to get dry clean.\n\n21:46.760 --> 21:48.760\nAnd if somebody's flinging mud at you,\n\n21:48.760 --> 21:50.760\nyou don't want to keep visiting that joint\n\n21:50.760 --> 21:52.760\nbecause it's about keeping the suit clean.\n\n21:52.760 --> 21:54.760\nThe same thing goes for your mind and your spirit.\n\n21:54.760 --> 21:57.760\nYeah, well, you move, you move the mechanism that you are\n\n21:57.760 --> 21:58.760\nif you're in a place where you're,\n\n21:58.760 --> 22:01.760\nwhere all the cords connecting to you are 99% barf\n\n22:01.760 --> 22:02.760\nand 1% nutrition.\n\n22:02.760 --> 22:05.760\nYeah, you probably like, you've probably picked,\n\n22:05.760 --> 22:08.760\nunless you figure out how to now take on a new organ\n\n22:08.760 --> 22:12.760\nor something that actually turns barf into sunshine\n\n22:12.760 --> 22:13.760\nor...\n\n22:13.760 --> 22:15.760\nSay that once you have barf,\n\n22:15.760 --> 22:18.760\nyou identify that it's barf and you step around it.\n\n22:18.760 --> 22:20.760\nYou don't even try and get the nutrients from barf.\n\n22:20.760 --> 22:23.760\nOr if you figure out how to turn barf into dramamine.\n\n22:23.760 --> 22:24.760\nI don't know, I think...\n\n22:24.760 --> 22:25.760\nAnd then you put dramamine out\n\n22:25.760 --> 22:27.760\nand it goes back around the people\n\n22:27.760 --> 22:29.760\nand they don't, and then they start barfing less.\n\n22:29.760 --> 22:31.760\nAnd then it's like, if that is your job,\n\n22:31.760 --> 22:34.760\nyou know, like that's a thing that you are good at\n\n22:34.760 --> 22:35.760\nand you enjoy doing.\n\n22:35.760 --> 22:37.760\nYou go stand in that place and you collect barf\n\n22:37.760 --> 22:39.760\nand then you like, you put out this other chemical\n\n22:39.760 --> 22:41.760\nand then the barf recedes\n\n22:41.760 --> 22:43.760\nand people that are passing by go,\n\n22:43.760 --> 22:44.760\nwhy are you doing that?\n\n22:44.760 --> 22:45.760\nDon't feed the trolls and you go,\n\n22:45.760 --> 22:46.760\nI'm not, I'm reducing barf.\n\n22:46.760 --> 22:47.760\nYou'll thank me later.\n\n22:47.760 --> 22:49.760\nOr it's just something I enjoy doing.\n\n22:49.760 --> 22:50.760\nIf you don't enjoy doing it,\n\n22:50.760 --> 22:51.760\nI think most importantly,\n\n22:51.760 --> 22:53.760\nlike yeah, you fucking like...\n\n22:53.760 --> 22:56.760\nYou know, you move that factory to a place\n\n22:56.760 --> 23:00.760\nwhere the compositions are better enabling you\n\n23:00.760 --> 23:01.760\nto put out good things.\n\n23:01.760 --> 23:02.760\nYes.\n\n23:02.760 --> 23:03.760\nFor sure.\n\n23:03.760 --> 23:04.760\nWe can both agree on that.\n\n23:04.760 --> 23:06.760\nI just think there are some people out there,\n\n23:06.760 --> 23:08.760\nI think we could have some of these trolls on our side\n\n23:08.760 --> 23:10.760\nif they could start to understand that there's like a way.\n\n23:10.760 --> 23:12.760\nPeople like...\n\n23:12.760 --> 23:14.760\nThere are people that troll\n\n23:14.760 --> 23:17.760\nbecause they don't trust...\n\n23:17.760 --> 23:19.760\nThey don't trust dichotomy.\n\n23:19.760 --> 23:21.760\nThey don't trust systems that tell them\n\n23:21.760 --> 23:22.760\nthere's a difference between good and bad\n\n23:22.760 --> 23:24.760\nand that there's only good and or bad.\n\n23:24.760 --> 23:26.760\nAnd that those people,\n\n23:26.760 --> 23:30.760\nthey are able to be hypnotized by the bad guys\n\n23:30.760 --> 23:33.760\nfaster than they're able to be yelled at enough\n\n23:33.760 --> 23:36.760\nby the good guys to pick a side.\n\n23:36.760 --> 23:39.760\nI think that people who troll are speaking a language\n\n23:39.760 --> 23:41.760\nthat they are used to speaking\n\n23:41.760 --> 23:43.760\nbecause they come from negative situations.\n\n23:43.760 --> 23:46.760\nThey don't even know that they're necessarily being negative.\n\n23:46.760 --> 23:48.760\nI think that if you are a machine,\n\n23:48.760 --> 23:50.760\nmaybe you want to operate efficiently\n\n23:50.760 --> 23:53.760\nand that fucking with these trolls is inefficient\n\n23:53.760 --> 23:55.760\nand takes the energy from your machine, you know?\n\n23:55.760 --> 23:58.760\nBecause I think that you don't...\n\n23:58.760 --> 24:01.760\nI'm not trying to save souls necessarily.\n\n24:01.760 --> 24:04.760\nThere's a bunch of people that are worth saving.\n\n24:04.760 --> 24:06.760\nSo I take that level of compassion\n\n24:06.760 --> 24:08.760\nthat you're expressing for these trolls\n\n24:08.760 --> 24:10.760\nand I give it to people who are actually fighting for good.\n\n24:10.760 --> 24:11.760\nYeah, yeah.\n\n24:11.760 --> 24:13.760\nWell, in that example, then it's like you're...\n\n24:13.760 --> 24:15.760\nYeah, so you're saying,\n\n24:15.760 --> 24:17.760\nI, Brandon Johnson, my philosophy\n\n24:17.760 --> 24:19.760\nrepresented like a 2D overhead map\n\n24:19.760 --> 24:21.760\nwhere there's like lichen over here\n\n24:21.760 --> 24:23.760\nand trolls over here and like...\n\n24:23.760 --> 24:24.760\nThere's a bridge.\n\n24:24.760 --> 24:25.760\nSunflowers over here.\n\n24:25.760 --> 24:28.760\nIt's like you're in a really specific position\n\n24:28.760 --> 24:30.760\nwhere you put yourself\n\n24:30.760 --> 24:33.760\nwhere you're able to expose yourself\n\n24:33.760 --> 24:35.760\nto the ingredients you need\n\n24:35.760 --> 24:38.760\nand then you're pumping help\n\n24:38.760 --> 24:41.760\nto the people that you are saying deserve it,\n\n24:41.760 --> 24:42.760\nyou know, that need it.\n\n24:42.760 --> 24:44.760\nThey're like, oh, that person needs...\n\n24:44.760 --> 24:45.760\nLike me, for instance,\n\n24:45.760 --> 24:47.760\nif I don't have you in my life,\n\n24:47.760 --> 24:49.760\nmy altitude would be lower.\n\n24:49.760 --> 24:52.760\nYou pump me with levity chemicals.\n\n24:52.760 --> 24:54.760\nTrying to make me cry, Harmon.\n\n24:54.760 --> 24:56.760\nTrying to make me be a bitch up here.\n\n24:56.760 --> 24:58.760\nI see you. It's not gonna work.\n\n24:58.760 --> 25:02.760\nI mean, this epiphany is useless to you.\n\n25:02.760 --> 25:03.760\nI knew that coming in.\n\n25:03.760 --> 25:05.760\nThis is the epiphany that I needed.\n\n25:05.760 --> 25:06.760\nNo, no, no.\n\n25:06.760 --> 25:08.760\nI mean, I'm saying you're not somebody\n\n25:08.760 --> 25:09.760\nthat's functioning at a low enough level\n\n25:09.760 --> 25:11.760\nto need this epiphany.\n\n25:11.760 --> 25:13.760\nThe things that you've said in the past\n\n25:13.760 --> 25:15.760\non the show when we've gotten to this area,\n\n25:15.760 --> 25:19.760\nI know you get this.\n\n25:19.760 --> 25:22.760\nI'm getting there now\n\n25:22.760 --> 25:26.760\nbecause I've been to...\n\n25:26.760 --> 25:29.760\nIt's like, why am I letting so many things\n\n25:29.760 --> 25:32.760\nin an uncontrollable world control me?\n\n25:32.760 --> 25:33.760\nWell, this is the thing.\n\n25:33.760 --> 25:34.760\nI think as we get there,\n\n25:34.760 --> 25:36.760\nbecause we're always getting there,\n\n25:36.760 --> 25:37.760\nregardless of what level,\n\n25:37.760 --> 25:39.760\none of the things that we pass on is the information.\n\n25:39.760 --> 25:41.760\nSo I'll make this real quick,\n\n25:41.760 --> 25:43.760\nis that we've had to all mobilize,\n\n25:43.760 --> 25:45.760\nbut the older people have had to talk to the younger people\n\n25:45.760 --> 25:46.760\nabout how to do it\n\n25:46.760 --> 25:48.760\nbecause they've been fighting for 40, 50 years, right?\n\n25:48.760 --> 25:50.760\nSo anybody who's 30 and under\n\n25:50.760 --> 25:52.760\ndidn't know how to get together and rally\n\n25:52.760 --> 25:53.760\nand do all this shit.\n\n25:53.760 --> 25:56.760\nSo I kind of feel like it's everybody's duty to say,\n\n25:56.760 --> 25:58.760\nthis is the part of the journey that I would do like this,\n\n25:58.760 --> 26:00.760\nso that you can continue to fight,\n\n26:00.760 --> 26:02.760\nbecause you get this thing called oppression fatigue,\n\n26:02.760 --> 26:05.760\nwhere you're really tired of taking in all the bad shit\n\n26:05.760 --> 26:07.760\nand listening and trying to save puppies and people\n\n26:07.760 --> 26:08.760\nat the same time,\n\n26:08.760 --> 26:10.760\nand you get this roadmap that says,\n\n26:10.760 --> 26:12.760\nokay, so this is how you do this.\n\n26:12.760 --> 26:14.760\nAnd one of the ways that I always think you do it,\n\n26:14.760 --> 26:17.760\njust my two cents, having fought for a long time,\n\n26:17.760 --> 26:20.760\nis you really don't spend time on the people\n\n26:20.760 --> 26:22.760\nwho have very clearly executed\n\n26:22.760 --> 26:24.760\nthat they're not gonna come around,\n\n26:24.760 --> 26:26.760\nand you really spend more time on the people\n\n26:26.760 --> 26:29.760\nthat are working hard in the streets to do what they do.\n\n26:29.760 --> 26:32.760\nIt's like you take that compassion for a troll,\n\n26:32.760 --> 26:34.760\nlike I said, and you give it to a mother of three\n\n26:34.760 --> 26:36.760\nwho's taking a bus every day,\n\n26:36.760 --> 26:38.760\nand then you really do see it go farther.\n\n26:38.760 --> 26:40.760\nLike if I save a troll,\n\n26:40.760 --> 26:41.760\nI don't know that I'm helping anybody.\n\n26:41.760 --> 26:43.760\nThat motherfucker might still be selfish.\n\n26:43.760 --> 26:45.760\nYou aren't even engaging with the troll.\n\n26:45.760 --> 26:47.760\nYou're engaging with the shark fin\n\n26:47.760 --> 26:49.760\nthat the troll is putting above the water,\n\n26:49.760 --> 26:51.760\nand they're only putting it above the water\n\n26:51.760 --> 26:54.760\nbecause the rest of them is safe tucked away\n\n26:54.760 --> 26:56.760\nand is not being engaged with.\n\n26:56.760 --> 27:01.760\nThat's what they come for is just to do this kind of shark thing.\n\n27:01.760 --> 27:03.760\nIf we look at them as machines,\n\n27:03.760 --> 27:05.760\nbecause it'll make the metaphor easier for me,\n\n27:05.760 --> 27:12.760\nlike the bad guys are one of their techniques\n\n27:12.760 --> 27:15.760\nis to just spray gas into the air\n\n27:15.760 --> 27:18.760\nwhere no interaction with them whatsoever,\n\n27:18.760 --> 27:20.760\nand no relationship with them,\n\n27:20.760 --> 27:22.760\nand no desire for them to be one thing or another.\n\n27:22.760 --> 27:25.760\nYou're just breathing farts everywhere you go.\n\n27:25.760 --> 27:28.760\nYou go to Albertsons and everyone's in a bad mood\n\n27:28.760 --> 27:32.760\nbecause just collectively everybody is convinced\n\n27:32.760 --> 27:36.760\nthat everyone hates each other in general.\n\n27:36.760 --> 27:42.760\nI mean, this is just a function of the new thought wars\n\n27:42.760 --> 27:44.760\nthat we're having, the meme wars.\n\n27:44.760 --> 27:47.760\nThis is the former Soviet Union\n\n27:47.760 --> 27:50.760\ntested this and demonstrated it\n\n27:50.760 --> 27:52.760\non all their little satellite states\n\n27:52.760 --> 27:53.760\nthat tried to break ranks.\n\n27:53.760 --> 27:57.760\nWe watched them hack and fucking troll them\n\n27:57.760 --> 27:59.760\nand say, you're having a civil war down the street.\n\n27:59.760 --> 28:01.760\nYou're black people. Don't like your white people.\n\n28:01.760 --> 28:02.760\nIt's happening down the street from you\n\n28:02.760 --> 28:04.760\nand the people in their homes going like,\n\n28:04.760 --> 28:07.760\nI don't hear any mortar fire.\n\n28:07.760 --> 28:10.760\nIt's a massive confusion.\n\n28:10.760 --> 28:12.760\nGas, it's just gas.\n\n28:12.760 --> 28:14.760\nYou didn't have to ask for,\n\n28:14.760 --> 28:17.760\nand so I guess part of my epiphany is like,\n\n28:17.760 --> 28:19.760\nokay, so the air has changed.\n\n28:19.760 --> 28:21.760\nIt's changed.\n\n28:21.760 --> 28:25.760\nSo am I a person who's going to go buy a gun?\n\n28:25.760 --> 28:27.760\nYep.\n\n28:27.760 --> 28:29.760\nBut now that I'm thinking about it,\n\n28:29.760 --> 28:34.760\nthat was my reaction to worrying that people were going to die,\n\n28:34.760 --> 28:36.760\nworrying that my family was going to be safe,\n\n28:36.760 --> 28:38.760\nworrying that I couldn't take care of my dogs,\n\n28:38.760 --> 28:41.760\nmy housekeeper, my neighborhood, myself.\n\n28:41.760 --> 28:44.760\nI let that fear make me go put money\n\n28:44.760 --> 28:47.760\ninto a mechanism of hatred and violence.\n\n28:47.760 --> 28:52.760\nAnd it's because my gauges and pistons and things\n\n28:52.760 --> 28:55.760\nwere poorly designed for this change\n\n28:55.760 --> 28:58.760\nin chemical compounds in the atmosphere.\n\n28:58.760 --> 29:01.760\nNot poorly designed. They just needed upgrading.\n\n29:01.760 --> 29:04.760\nWe need to add some filters.\n\n29:04.760 --> 29:06.760\nIt feels like, I don't like the word filter\n\n29:06.760 --> 29:09.760\nbecause it's part of what the bad guys are doing.\n\n29:09.760 --> 29:11.760\nIt's more like, take it all fucking in.\n\n29:11.760 --> 29:13.760\nTake it in.\n\n29:13.760 --> 29:15.760\nMichael, it's me, Kit.\n\n29:15.760 --> 29:17.760\nThis is the Knight Rider reference.\n\n29:17.760 --> 29:19.760\nIt was a show.\n\n29:19.760 --> 29:21.760\nMichael, Kit says,\n\n29:21.760 --> 29:25.760\nI'm detecting a change in the atmosphere.\n\n29:25.760 --> 29:28.760\nTake it in and fucking study it.\n\n29:28.760 --> 29:31.760\nOh, there's a 10% increase in nitrogen\n\n29:31.760 --> 29:33.760\nand a decrease in oxygen.\n\n29:33.760 --> 29:36.760\nOkay, I'll work on a schematic for a part of my engine\n\n29:36.760 --> 29:39.760\nthat will be nitrogen-powered\n\n29:39.760 --> 29:41.760\nthat will generate more oxygen.\n\n29:41.760 --> 29:46.760\nI don't know what that just means.\n\n29:46.760 --> 29:51.760\nIt starts with self-examination\n\n29:51.760 --> 29:53.760\nand then it's awareness.\n\n29:53.760 --> 29:55.760\nIt's like, be aware of what's happening to you.\n\n29:55.760 --> 29:57.760\nIt's time to check in with yourself\n\n29:57.760 --> 29:59.760\nabout how you're feeling when you're feeling it.\n\n29:59.760 --> 30:01.760\nAnd don't be afraid to say,\n\n30:01.760 --> 30:03.760\nI feel sad. I feel like I want to give up.\n\n30:03.760 --> 30:06.760\nI feel so angry. I feel like I want to smash somebody's face in.\n\n30:06.760 --> 30:09.760\nBut then you don't have to do any of that stuff to feel it.\n\n30:09.760 --> 30:12.760\nYou just examine those feelings and then you have a board meeting\n\n30:12.760 --> 30:14.760\ninside your heart and go,\n\n30:14.760 --> 30:18.760\nokay, so we're taking stuff in through our intake valves\n\n30:18.760 --> 30:22.760\nthat are making us violent and fearful and numb.\n\n30:22.760 --> 30:28.760\nLet's figure out, let's just be aware of that for a week.\n\n30:28.760 --> 30:30.760\nI wish there were somebody in the room\n\n30:30.760 --> 30:32.760\nwho knew a little bit about what we were talking about.\n\n30:32.760 --> 30:34.760\nDo you think there is?\n\n30:34.760 --> 30:38.760\nWell, I think you're recommending a guest order swap.\n\n30:38.760 --> 30:40.760\nLet's get down with Ben Nelson.\n\n30:40.760 --> 30:41.760\nLet's see what's going on.\n\n30:41.760 --> 30:44.760\nAll right, well, let's have our first guest come up, Ben Nelson.\n\n30:44.760 --> 30:46.760\nAnd I'll tell you what he's doing in a second.\n\n30:46.760 --> 30:48.760\nOh, yeah.\n\n30:54.760 --> 30:57.760\nI guess the reason I thought Brandon was recommending a guest swap\n\n30:57.760 --> 31:00.760\nwas because I don't know that Ben Nelson is...\n\n31:00.760 --> 31:02.760\nI only know what Ben Nelson's objective is\n\n31:02.760 --> 31:05.760\nin a very, very overview fashion.\n\n31:05.760 --> 31:09.760\nYour project is a thing called Project Minerva?\n\n31:09.760 --> 31:11.760\nThe Minerva project, yeah.\n\n31:11.760 --> 31:15.760\nAnd give us the fucking Wikipedia paragraph that I read.\n\n31:15.760 --> 31:17.760\nOr I will.\n\n31:17.760 --> 31:22.760\nSo Minerva is effectively a way to create a university,\n\n31:22.760 --> 31:24.760\nthe way it's supposed to be.\n\n31:24.760 --> 31:26.760\nSo basically, everything that universities say they do,\n\n31:26.760 --> 31:28.760\nteach people how to think critically,\n\n31:28.760 --> 31:30.760\nteach people how to problem solve,\n\n31:30.760 --> 31:32.760\nteach people how to understand other people,\n\n31:32.760 --> 31:34.760\ninteract effectively, communicate effectively,\n\n31:34.760 --> 31:36.760\ncommunicate effectively.\n\n31:36.760 --> 31:38.760\nTurns out they don't do any of those things.\n\n31:38.760 --> 31:42.760\nThe idea of like college, class shopping carts and stuff,\n\n31:42.760 --> 31:44.760\nisn't that like related to the decline?\n\n31:44.760 --> 31:47.760\nBecause it's like not about a curriculum anymore,\n\n31:47.760 --> 31:49.760\nit's about selling these digital products\n\n31:49.760 --> 31:52.760\nthat are actually supposedly pieces of an education?\n\n31:52.760 --> 31:53.760\nYeah, exactly.\n\n31:53.760 --> 31:55.760\nWell, and you know, it's not even that anymore,\n\n31:55.760 --> 31:58.760\nbecause what they're really selling isn't education, right?\n\n31:58.760 --> 32:01.760\nI mean, if you think that universities are actually about education,\n\n32:01.760 --> 32:03.760\nif you think that people choose universities\n\n32:03.760 --> 32:06.760\nbased on education, why are they spending so much money\n\n32:06.760 --> 32:09.760\non lazy rivers and campuses and tanning beds and sports teams?\n\n32:09.760 --> 32:11.760\nThey are, in fact, selling you first of all.\n\n32:11.760 --> 32:13.760\nThey're approaching you as a family.\n\n32:13.760 --> 32:14.760\nThey need the kid engaged.\n\n32:14.760 --> 32:15.760\nThey need the kid to say,\n\n32:15.760 --> 32:17.760\nI want to go to that school because I might get late\n\n32:17.760 --> 32:18.760\nand I might have fun.\n\n32:18.760 --> 32:19.760\nI might not kill myself.\n\n32:19.760 --> 32:22.760\nBut simultaneously, the more important part of the family,\n\n32:22.760 --> 32:25.760\nthe parents need to go, oh, and after that, job placement.\n\n32:25.760 --> 32:27.760\nYeah, job placement and...\n\n32:27.760 --> 32:28.760\nI think I was wrong.\n\n32:28.760 --> 32:29.760\nI think I was wrong from your reaction.\n\n32:29.760 --> 32:30.760\nYeah, yeah.\n\n32:30.760 --> 32:33.760\nI think there's one other thing which is, you know,\n\n32:33.760 --> 32:38.760\nthat colleges sell different packages to different students.\n\n32:38.760 --> 32:40.760\nAnd one of the things that colleges don't talk about,\n\n32:40.760 --> 32:43.760\nespecially the Ivy League, the highly selective schools\n\n32:43.760 --> 32:46.760\nthat claim that they're need-blind, claim that,\n\n32:46.760 --> 32:48.760\noh, we don't really look at how wealthy you are,\n\n32:48.760 --> 32:50.760\nwhich is a total lie,\n\n32:50.760 --> 32:52.760\nthey sell a very different package to rich kids\n\n32:52.760 --> 32:54.760\nthan they do to everyone else.\n\n32:54.760 --> 32:56.760\nAnd the problem is rich kids, the top 1%,\n\n32:56.760 --> 32:59.760\nare 50% of the students going to these schools.\n\n32:59.760 --> 33:00.760\n50%.\n\n33:00.760 --> 33:01.760\nRight?\n\n33:01.760 --> 33:03.760\nAnd you can't do that if you really need blind.\n\n33:03.760 --> 33:06.760\nSo for them, the pitch is very, very different.\n\n33:06.760 --> 33:10.760\nThe pitch is, look at the theme park that you're going to be going to.\n\n33:10.760 --> 33:12.760\nAnd yeah, you know, you got courses and this and that,\n\n33:12.760 --> 33:13.760\nand you can choose whatever you want.\n\n33:13.760 --> 33:16.760\nBut look, between you and me, slash, between everyone,\n\n33:16.760 --> 33:19.760\nonce you get in, there are no Fs.\n\n33:19.760 --> 33:20.760\nYou take whatever courses you want.\n\n33:20.760 --> 33:22.760\nThere's no curriculum.\n\n33:22.760 --> 33:23.760\nYou're guaranteed a diploma.\n\n33:23.760 --> 33:25.760\nIs that really a thing that's able to be transmitted,\n\n33:25.760 --> 33:27.760\ndog whistled, if you will, to families?\n\n33:27.760 --> 33:33.760\nLike, for instance, if someone was absolutely 100%\n\n33:33.760 --> 33:35.760\nobservably dyslexic, which is not a crime,\n\n33:35.760 --> 33:40.760\ngeniuses are dyslexic, but someone who has not treated it at all\n\n33:40.760 --> 33:43.760\nand is therefore functionally illiterate,\n\n33:43.760 --> 33:46.760\ncannot read a piece of paper publicly\n\n33:46.760 --> 33:48.760\nwithout fucking up the words,\n\n33:48.760 --> 33:51.760\ncannot form sentences without confusing us.\n\n33:51.760 --> 33:55.760\nAnd then, like, but I still want to be president.\n\n33:55.760 --> 33:57.760\nLike, there are, you're saying that,\n\n33:57.760 --> 33:59.760\nbecause this is what boggles my mind.\n\n33:59.760 --> 34:01.760\nI thought that there were, I mean, you said no Fs.\n\n34:01.760 --> 34:06.760\nThat's actually somehow broadcast out to the families.\n\n34:06.760 --> 34:08.760\nLike, your kid won't get an F here.\n\n34:08.760 --> 34:13.760\nYeah, so one shockingly underreported story\n\n34:13.760 --> 34:16.760\nfrom a couple of years ago was happening\n\n34:16.760 --> 34:18.760\nat the University of North Carolina.\n\n34:18.760 --> 34:20.760\nUniversity of North Carolina,\n\n34:20.760 --> 34:22.760\nthe oldest public university in the United States.\n\n34:22.760 --> 34:24.760\nOld Miss Daisy.\n\n34:24.760 --> 34:26.760\nYeah, there you go.\n\n34:26.760 --> 34:29.760\nMy alma mater.\n\n34:29.760 --> 34:32.760\nSo University of North Carolina\n\n34:32.760 --> 34:35.760\ndiscovered shockingly three years ago\n\n34:35.760 --> 34:39.760\nto nobody's knowledge that for the previous 18 years\n\n34:39.760 --> 34:41.760\nthey invented classes that didn't exist,\n\n34:41.760 --> 34:43.760\nput them in a course catalog,\n\n34:43.760 --> 34:45.760\ndidn't bother assigning a room to them\n\n34:45.760 --> 34:47.760\nbecause they never met,\n\n34:47.760 --> 34:51.760\nand they were specifically in place\n\n34:51.760 --> 34:54.760\nto enable several of their athletes\n\n34:54.760 --> 34:56.760\nto get Phantom A's.\n\n34:56.760 --> 34:58.760\nNow when this was discovered,\n\n34:58.760 --> 35:01.760\nit was some secretary deep in the bowels\n\n35:01.760 --> 35:04.760\nof the organization that took all the blame,\n\n35:04.760 --> 35:07.760\nand everyone else, the head of the sports department,\n\n35:07.760 --> 35:09.760\nthe provost, the president, no one knew.\n\n35:09.760 --> 35:11.760\nNo one knew.\n\n35:11.760 --> 35:14.760\nAnd when it was investigated by the accreditors\n\n35:14.760 --> 35:16.760\nthat people were supposed to actually be\n\n35:16.760 --> 35:18.760\nwatchdogging these folks, they said,\n\n35:18.760 --> 35:20.760\neh, you shouldn't do this again.\n\n35:20.760 --> 35:22.760\nThey gave way fake degrees.\n\n35:22.760 --> 35:24.760\nNow people look at this and say, oh my god,\n\n35:24.760 --> 35:26.760\nthat's like flat out fraud.\n\n35:26.760 --> 35:27.760\nAnd was that all athletes?\n\n35:27.760 --> 35:29.760\nBecause I feel like, I saw Johnny B. Good\n\n35:29.760 --> 35:31.760\nwith what's his name?\n\n35:31.760 --> 35:33.760\nFrom whatever?\n\n35:33.760 --> 35:34.760\nAnthony Michael Hall.\n\n35:34.760 --> 35:36.760\nSorry, Anthony.\n\n35:36.760 --> 35:38.760\nYou did great in season two.\n\n35:41.760 --> 35:43.760\nI feel like that's been like,\n\n35:43.760 --> 35:45.760\nsince I was a kid,\n\n35:45.760 --> 35:48.760\nthat has always been an athlete thing.\n\n35:48.760 --> 35:50.760\nIt's much more pervasive.\n\n35:50.760 --> 35:52.760\nAnd that's the real problem.\n\n35:52.760 --> 35:54.760\nSo the problem is that other universities\n\n35:54.760 --> 35:56.760\nwho looked at UNC and just passed judgment\n\n35:56.760 --> 35:59.760\nand said, oh my god, the horror of that,\n\n35:59.760 --> 36:01.760\nwhat they've done internally,\n\n36:01.760 --> 36:03.760\nif you look at some of the most selective universities\n\n36:03.760 --> 36:05.760\nin the country, what they do,\n\n36:05.760 --> 36:07.760\nthey just don't issue Fs to anybody.\n\n36:07.760 --> 36:09.760\nSo I'll give you the story.\n\n36:09.760 --> 36:11.760\nA very, very, very selective university.\n\n36:11.760 --> 36:13.760\nYou've all heard the name.\n\n36:13.760 --> 36:16.760\nI will protect the guilty by leaving out their name.\n\n36:16.760 --> 36:19.760\nI had a friend who was a teaching assistant there.\n\n36:19.760 --> 36:20.760\nHarvard.\n\n36:20.760 --> 36:22.760\nAnd I'm not going to say exactly where.\n\n36:22.760 --> 36:24.760\nIt rhymes with Garver.\n\n36:24.760 --> 36:26.760\nIt rhymes with Mayo.\n\n36:26.760 --> 36:29.760\nSo the very short version is that\n\n36:29.760 --> 36:31.760\ntheir rule was that you basically,\n\n36:31.760 --> 36:33.760\nyou only got grades based on tests,\n\n36:33.760 --> 36:35.760\nand if you missed two of the tests,\n\n36:35.760 --> 36:36.760\nit's 100% the final.\n\n36:36.760 --> 36:39.760\nAnd there was a girl who missed both the midterms\n\n36:39.760 --> 36:42.760\nand then skipped the final.\n\n36:42.760 --> 36:44.760\nThey didn't take any of the tests.\n\n36:44.760 --> 36:46.760\nAnd when it was time to give her grades,\n\n36:46.760 --> 36:48.760\nthe TA gave her an F.\n\n36:48.760 --> 36:50.760\nAnd the professor, when he looked at the F,\n\n36:50.760 --> 36:52.760\nhe said, who got an F?\n\n36:52.760 --> 36:54.760\nHe said, this girl didn't take a single test.\n\n36:54.760 --> 36:57.760\nAnd he said, yeah, that's a C plus.\n\n36:57.760 --> 36:59.760\nC plus.\n\n36:59.760 --> 37:01.760\nNow, is this a, so...\n\n37:01.760 --> 37:05.760\nThat happened to me, I think, in astrology.\n\n37:05.760 --> 37:08.760\nI definitely got an F on a test,\n\n37:08.760 --> 37:10.760\nand I was like, C, and it was like, well,\n\n37:10.760 --> 37:12.760\nthat didn't happen.\n\n37:12.760 --> 37:15.760\nOkay, so in that example,\n\n37:15.760 --> 37:17.760\nthat's a real life example,\n\n37:17.760 --> 37:19.760\nbut it's an anecdotal example.\n\n37:19.760 --> 37:23.760\nSo now, just tell us, like, why?\n\n37:23.760 --> 37:24.760\nWho is that girl?\n\n37:24.760 --> 37:26.760\nWhy is that professor doing that?\n\n37:26.760 --> 37:28.760\nWell, he did that because, actually,\n\n37:28.760 --> 37:30.760\nthe rules of the university,\n\n37:30.760 --> 37:32.760\nso in elite institutions,\n\n37:32.760 --> 37:34.760\nwhen you want to have half of your students to be rich,\n\n37:34.760 --> 37:37.760\nyou're going to have to make a lot of exceptions,\n\n37:37.760 --> 37:39.760\neven at the very best universities.\n\n37:39.760 --> 37:40.760\nThat makes sense.\n\n37:40.760 --> 37:42.760\nDamn it, I went to fucking Marquette,\n\n37:42.760 --> 37:43.760\nand I had to drop out.\n\n37:43.760 --> 37:45.760\nI got an F in English because they busted my balls.\n\n37:45.760 --> 37:46.760\nYou didn't go to a,\n\n37:46.760 --> 37:48.760\nyou didn't go to a leading math university math.\n\n37:48.760 --> 37:49.760\nEvery time I class, my grade went down a thing.\n\n37:49.760 --> 37:51.760\nI was like, this is harder than high school.\n\n37:51.760 --> 37:53.760\nSo actually, that's the sad part,\n\n37:53.760 --> 37:54.760\nbecause the higher you climb,\n\n37:54.760 --> 37:56.760\nthe more this grade inflation is occurring.\n\n37:56.760 --> 37:59.760\nOh, my, always knew it,\n\n37:59.760 --> 38:01.760\nnever heard it from a qualified individual.\n\n38:01.760 --> 38:04.760\nNow, does this have anything to do with loans?\n\n38:04.760 --> 38:06.760\nWell, not so much because these schools\n\n38:06.760 --> 38:08.760\ndon't really give out loans, right?\n\n38:08.760 --> 38:10.760\nBecause, and especially to the students that,\n\n38:10.760 --> 38:13.760\nyou know, can afford to pay $70,000 a year.\n\n38:13.760 --> 38:14.760\nWho can do that?\n\n38:14.760 --> 38:15.760\nHalf of their students.\n\n38:15.760 --> 38:16.760\nWow.\n\n38:16.760 --> 38:17.760\nThat's how bad it is.\n\n38:17.760 --> 38:18.760\nThat's how bad it is.\n\n38:18.760 --> 38:21.760\nFucking idiots, we've raised a nation of rich idiots.\n\n38:21.760 --> 38:22.760\nWow.\n\n38:22.760 --> 38:23.760\nPrivileged rich idiots.\n\n38:23.760 --> 38:24.760\nPrivileged.\n\n38:24.760 --> 38:26.760\nAnd not necessarily smarter or better equipped\n\n38:26.760 --> 38:27.760\nto go into the workforce?\n\n38:27.760 --> 38:28.760\nNo, not at all.\n\n38:28.760 --> 38:32.760\nI mean, in fact, if you look at how employers rate\n\n38:32.760 --> 38:34.760\nthe quality of graduates from universities,\n\n38:34.760 --> 38:36.760\nit's abysmal, abysmal.\n\n38:36.760 --> 38:39.760\n96% of chief academic officers at universities\n\n38:39.760 --> 38:41.760\nsay that they prepare their students well for the job.\n\n38:41.760 --> 38:42.760\nRight?\n\n38:42.760 --> 38:43.760\nThe job force.\n\n38:43.760 --> 38:44.760\nThis is what parents really care about.\n\n38:44.760 --> 38:46.760\n11% of employers agree.\n\n38:46.760 --> 38:47.760\nRight.\n\n38:47.760 --> 38:48.760\n11%.\n\n38:48.760 --> 38:49.760\nYeah, I mean, I think that's been,\n\n38:49.760 --> 38:51.760\nthat's been like the last 10 years or so.\n\n38:51.760 --> 38:53.760\nIt's like that bubble burst where somebody bothered,\n\n38:53.760 --> 38:55.760\nas with Enron, somebody finally said,\n\n38:55.760 --> 38:57.760\ncome on, we need to see a ledger.\n\n38:57.760 --> 38:58.760\nRight.\n\n38:58.760 --> 38:59.760\nAnd then after a lot of hemming and high,\n\n38:59.760 --> 39:02.760\nit's like, yeah, no, no one gets a job that went to college.\n\n39:02.760 --> 39:05.760\nBasically, you, but however,\n\n39:05.760 --> 39:07.760\nthere's a meta channel to that,\n\n39:07.760 --> 39:10.760\nwhich is if you can afford to send your kid to Harvard,\n\n39:10.760 --> 39:11.760\ncorrect me if I'm wrong,\n\n39:11.760 --> 39:13.760\nI'm going to get a little classist here\n\n39:13.760 --> 39:15.760\nin the opposite direction.\n\n39:15.760 --> 39:18.760\nIf you can afford to send your kid to Harvard,\n\n39:18.760 --> 39:23.760\nyou, and you don't send your kid to Harvard,\n\n39:23.760 --> 39:26.760\nyou're kneecapping your kid\n\n39:26.760 --> 39:28.760\nbecause your kid's a member of the 1%.\n\n39:28.760 --> 39:30.760\nHe's garbage larva.\n\n39:30.760 --> 39:34.760\nHe's blue blood, Mayflower, fucking, parasitic.\n\n39:34.760 --> 39:36.760\nParasitic DNA.\n\n39:36.760 --> 39:39.760\nAnd he needs his Harvard UV ray\n\n39:39.760 --> 39:41.760\nthat is tanning booth to pass through\n\n39:41.760 --> 39:44.760\nso he can be a baked in Harvard fucking moron\n\n39:44.760 --> 39:47.760\nand go get his oil wells and his fucking fucking shit back.\n\n39:47.760 --> 39:49.760\nSo I got good news for you.\n\n39:49.760 --> 39:50.760\nI got good news for you.\n\n39:50.760 --> 39:51.760\nThat's a myth.\n\n39:51.760 --> 39:52.760\nOkay.\n\n39:52.760 --> 39:54.760\nSo they actually, somebody did that study.\n\n39:54.760 --> 39:57.760\nThey looked at people accepted by Harvard,\n\n39:57.760 --> 39:59.760\nall the people accepted by Harvard,\n\n39:59.760 --> 40:01.760\nand they looked at the people who chose not to go\n\n40:01.760 --> 40:03.760\nand compared them to people who went.\n\n40:03.760 --> 40:06.760\nTurns out that if you are from the top four\n\n40:06.760 --> 40:09.760\nof the five socioeconomic strata, right,\n\n40:09.760 --> 40:11.760\nso basically the top 80%, right,\n\n40:11.760 --> 40:14.760\nit makes zero difference whether or not\n\n40:14.760 --> 40:16.760\nyou chose to go to Harvard or to state school.\n\n40:16.760 --> 40:18.760\nWhere it does help, and it does help,\n\n40:18.760 --> 40:21.760\nis if you come from the 20% poorest households in the country,\n\n40:21.760 --> 40:24.760\nwhich make up a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction\n\n40:24.760 --> 40:26.760\nof Harvard students,\n\n40:26.760 --> 40:29.760\nthose students actually do have some better\n\n40:29.760 --> 40:31.760\nfuture earnings, et cetera,\n\n40:31.760 --> 40:33.760\nif they went to Harvard path versus not,\n\n40:33.760 --> 40:34.760\nbut it's not that much.\n\n40:34.760 --> 40:35.760\nYeah.\n\n40:35.760 --> 40:37.760\nIt's usually because they started out at zero.\n\n40:37.760 --> 40:38.760\nCorrect.\n\n40:38.760 --> 40:40.760\nBecause they started with a huge, huge, huge amount\n\n40:40.760 --> 40:42.760\nof downside, and they do meet some people\n\n40:42.760 --> 40:43.760\nthat will help them out.\n\n40:43.760 --> 40:44.760\nSo that does help.\n\n40:44.760 --> 40:46.760\nBut guess what?\n\n40:46.760 --> 40:49.760\nWhat makes you successful in life?\n\n40:49.760 --> 40:51.760\nAnd this is actually a damnation of universities\n\n40:51.760 --> 40:53.760\nbecause I don't think it should be this way.\n\n40:53.760 --> 40:55.760\nBut what makes you successful in life is just\n\n40:55.760 --> 40:56.760\nhow good you are, right?\n\n40:56.760 --> 40:58.760\nBut what universities should be doing\n\n40:58.760 --> 41:00.760\nis they should actually be adding value.\n\n41:00.760 --> 41:02.760\nThey should actually be teaching to do those things.\n\n41:02.760 --> 41:03.760\nThere should be places where you go and you go,\n\n41:03.760 --> 41:05.760\nI don't know, I play a little bit of piano,\n\n41:05.760 --> 41:07.760\nbut I've always liked English class.\n\n41:07.760 --> 41:09.760\nI came here to be a journalist major,\n\n41:09.760 --> 41:11.760\nand they go, wrong, you're Billy Joel.\n\n41:11.760 --> 41:13.760\nYou know, and they funnel, and they make you into Billy Joel.\n\n41:13.760 --> 41:15.760\nThat's what any school should be.\n\n41:15.760 --> 41:17.760\nThat's what any household should be.\n\n41:17.760 --> 41:19.760\nYour kids should be born with proclivities\n\n41:19.760 --> 41:21.760\nthat are natural, interests that are natural.\n\n41:21.760 --> 41:23.760\nSometimes those are contrasting.\n\n41:23.760 --> 41:25.760\nYou put a piano in front of your kid.\n\n41:25.760 --> 41:27.760\nYou put a football in front of your kid.\n\n41:27.760 --> 41:31.760\nYou put a lockpick in front of your kid.\n\n41:31.760 --> 41:33.760\nIt's just in D&D terms.\n\n41:33.760 --> 41:35.760\nMaybe they're going to be an expert thief.\n\n41:35.760 --> 41:38.760\nAnd they respond to stuff, and they don't respond to stuff.\n\n41:38.760 --> 41:40.760\nYou know, and you break all, by the way,\n\n41:40.760 --> 41:41.760\nas a subset of that.\n\n41:41.760 --> 41:43.760\nYou know, you break all gender norms and all that stuff\n\n41:43.760 --> 41:46.760\nbecause regardless of what we think about this stuff anyways.\n\n41:46.760 --> 41:48.760\nBut who cares?\n\n41:48.760 --> 41:51.760\nI'm patting myself on the back for what am I barfing you at?\n\n41:51.760 --> 41:53.760\nI'm very curious about one thing,\n\n41:53.760 --> 41:55.760\nbecause I just want to make sure I got the picture here.\n\n41:55.760 --> 41:57.760\nBecause that girl in that example,\n\n41:57.760 --> 42:00.760\nwhen that professor says that F is actually a C+,\n\n42:00.760 --> 42:02.760\nis he saying that because of that girl's background?\n\n42:02.760 --> 42:04.760\nNo, he's saying it because it doesn't.\n\n42:04.760 --> 42:07.760\nSo the poor kids are benefiting from the no F process.\n\n42:07.760 --> 42:08.760\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n42:08.760 --> 42:09.760\nEverybody goes to C school.\n\n42:09.760 --> 42:10.760\nBecause they're customers.\n\n42:10.760 --> 42:11.760\nThey're customers, right?\n\n42:11.760 --> 42:12.760\nSo nobody wants to get on a cold happy meal.\n\n42:12.760 --> 42:15.760\nWell, the teachers, they get rated on how good their students do.\n\n42:15.760 --> 42:16.760\nBingo.\n\n42:16.760 --> 42:17.760\nRight?\n\n42:17.760 --> 42:18.760\nAnd so in order to give the girl an F,\n\n42:18.760 --> 42:19.760\nthere is a way to give her an F.\n\n42:19.760 --> 42:21.760\nAfter she missed the first midterm,\n\n42:21.760 --> 42:24.760\nthey have to call her into a teacher-student conference\n\n42:24.760 --> 42:27.760\nand have a written down corrective action plan.\n\n42:27.760 --> 42:30.760\nEven though, in the rules, she could have missed the midterm.\n\n42:30.760 --> 42:32.760\nThen after she missed the second midterm,\n\n42:32.760 --> 42:35.760\nthey had to bring her back in and have her sign\n\n42:35.760 --> 42:37.760\non a different corrective action plan,\n\n42:37.760 --> 42:38.760\nbecause the first one clearly didn't work.\n\n42:38.760 --> 42:42.760\nAnd then, and only then, if she then misses the final,\n\n42:42.760 --> 42:45.760\njust doesn't show up, then they can give her an F.\n\n42:45.760 --> 42:47.760\nPeople don't bother doing it.\n\n42:47.760 --> 42:48.760\nWow.\n\n42:48.760 --> 42:49.760\nRight?\n\n42:49.760 --> 42:51.760\nAnd so, but there's one other thing that the university should be doing,\n\n42:51.760 --> 42:53.760\nwhich is what you were talking about at the beginning of the show,\n\n42:53.760 --> 42:55.760\nwhich is those filters, right?\n\n42:55.760 --> 43:00.760\nThe ways to train your mind to deal with what comes at you.\n\n43:00.760 --> 43:02.760\nThat is the job of universities.\n\n43:02.760 --> 43:05.760\nThat is the definition of higher education.\n\n43:05.760 --> 43:07.760\nUniversities don't do that.\n\n43:07.760 --> 43:10.760\nAnd instead, we're giving C pluses to absolute morons\n\n43:10.760 --> 43:12.760\nthat can go on to become legislators.\n\n43:12.760 --> 43:15.760\nAnd we're giving also, look, I'll say it,\n\n43:15.760 --> 43:17.760\nI'm going to sound like one of the bad guys.\n\n43:17.760 --> 43:19.760\nWe're giving safe spaces to kids that complain that catcher and their ride\n\n43:19.760 --> 43:22.760\nmade them uncomfortable because it has the word fag in it.\n\n43:22.760 --> 43:23.760\nAbsolutely.\n\n43:23.760 --> 43:25.760\nWell, this seems all pretty terrible.\n\n43:25.760 --> 43:29.760\nI wish there was someone here that had a plan\n\n43:29.760 --> 43:31.760\nbecause we're good at complaining,\n\n43:31.760 --> 43:34.760\nbut if only there was someone, help me.\n\n43:34.760 --> 43:36.760\nThere's got to be a better way.\n\n43:36.760 --> 43:41.760\nI want to know how we got here and where we're going.\n\n43:41.760 --> 43:43.760\nSo where are we going?\n\n43:43.760 --> 43:46.760\nSo we believe that we've sketched out something that works.\n\n43:46.760 --> 43:48.760\nYou and your improv troupe.\n\n43:48.760 --> 43:49.760\nExactly.\n\n43:49.760 --> 43:51.760\nYou know, we have a whole group of people though.\n\n43:51.760 --> 43:53.760\nSo we actually started a new university.\n\n43:53.760 --> 43:56.760\nWe started a university program that's actually part of the KGI,\n\n43:56.760 --> 44:00.760\nwhich is one of the Claremont colleges here in Southern California.\n\n44:00.760 --> 44:07.760\nAnd our students go through a completely reimagined four-year\n\n44:07.760 --> 44:08.760\nundergraduate curriculum.\n\n44:08.760 --> 44:09.760\nIt's accredited.\n\n44:09.760 --> 44:12.760\nIt's very, very selective, very hard to get in.\n\n44:12.760 --> 44:16.760\nBut unlike the traditional profile of other universities,\n\n44:16.760 --> 44:18.760\nwe just choose not to discriminate.\n\n44:18.760 --> 44:20.760\nIt was an odd choice.\n\n44:20.760 --> 44:26.760\nAnd so we charge across the board.\n\n44:26.760 --> 44:29.760\nYou don't discriminate among the different kinds of black people\n\n44:29.760 --> 44:31.760\nfor the black people program.\n\n44:31.760 --> 44:33.760\nThere's no black person program.\n\n44:33.760 --> 44:35.760\nWell, how do you tell the black students from the...\n\n44:35.760 --> 44:36.760\nWe don't.\n\n44:36.760 --> 44:39.760\nSo here's the crazy thing about what we do.\n\n44:39.760 --> 44:41.760\nWe have no quotas.\n\n44:41.760 --> 44:42.760\nWe have no buckets.\n\n44:42.760 --> 44:43.760\nWe have no slots.\n\n44:43.760 --> 44:46.760\nWe don't say, oh, you have to compete for this position.\n\n44:46.760 --> 44:49.760\nIf you qualify for a program, it's very hard to qualify.\n\n44:49.760 --> 44:52.760\nBut if you qualify, you get in.\n\n44:52.760 --> 44:55.760\nAnd we charge for tuition fees, room and board,\n\n44:55.760 --> 44:57.760\nthe whole thing less than $30,000 a year.\n\n44:57.760 --> 44:59.760\nSo less than half of what the Ivy League charge,\n\n44:59.760 --> 45:02.760\nwhich is $60,000 to $70,000 now.\n\n45:02.760 --> 45:04.760\nAnd despite the fact that we charge less than half,\n\n45:04.760 --> 45:06.760\n80% of our students can't afford it.\n\n45:06.760 --> 45:08.760\nWhat's a state school cost?\n\n45:08.760 --> 45:09.760\nAbout the same.\n\n45:09.760 --> 45:11.760\nAnd that's subsidized by the government.\n\n45:11.760 --> 45:12.760\nWe're not.\n\n45:12.760 --> 45:13.760\nI'm sorry.\n\n45:13.760 --> 45:14.760\nI'm going to pick my nose right on camera\n\n45:14.760 --> 45:15.760\nbecause there's a trapdoor bugger.\n\n45:15.760 --> 45:18.760\nAnd look, I can either live with it or I can fucking confront it.\n\n45:18.760 --> 45:19.760\nThere's something about it.\n\n45:19.760 --> 45:20.760\nNow it's gone.\n\n45:20.760 --> 45:23.760\nI'll let Reddit show that in replay.\n\n45:23.760 --> 45:24.760\nI picked my nose.\n\n45:24.760 --> 45:25.760\nI do it with my thumb.\n\n45:25.760 --> 45:30.760\nThat's why my nose looks like Harrison Ford's at 44.\n\n45:30.760 --> 45:35.760\nNow, would a guy like me make it into your program?\n\n45:35.760 --> 45:40.760\nSo I want to try to, I'm going to try to recap what you said\n\n45:40.760 --> 45:41.760\nso that we can try.\n\n45:41.760 --> 45:43.760\nBecause I'm dumb and drunk.\n\n45:43.760 --> 45:48.760\nYou're saying that you, because first of all,\n\n45:48.760 --> 45:51.760\nyou haven't built a brick and mortar building yet.\n\n45:51.760 --> 45:53.760\nYou're saying you're using existing universities,\n\n45:53.760 --> 45:55.760\nbut you started a program.\n\n45:55.760 --> 45:56.760\nWe started an undergraduate program.\n\n45:56.760 --> 45:57.760\nYeah.\n\n45:57.760 --> 45:59.760\nAnd what we do is rather than using kind of a campus-based\n\n45:59.760 --> 46:01.760\nphilosophy, we use a city-based philosophy.\n\n46:01.760 --> 46:03.760\nSo our students, they actually spend their first year,\n\n46:03.760 --> 46:05.760\nnot in Southern California, but in San Francisco.\n\n46:05.760 --> 46:07.760\nAnd they live in a residence hall in the middle of the city.\n\n46:07.760 --> 46:10.760\nAnd then the next three years, they travel as a group.\n\n46:10.760 --> 46:12.760\nThey live in six different countries all over the world.\n\n46:12.760 --> 46:13.760\nWhat?\n\n46:13.760 --> 46:14.760\nSo they go from San Francisco.\n\n46:14.760 --> 46:17.760\nThey go to Seoul, Hyderabad, Berlin, Buenos Aires,\n\n46:17.760 --> 46:18.760\nLondon, Taipei.\n\n46:18.760 --> 46:20.760\nAnd they come back to San Francisco to graduate.\n\n46:20.760 --> 46:21.760\nAre you a Bond villain?\n\n46:21.760 --> 46:22.760\nWell, I'm not.\n\n46:22.760 --> 46:25.760\nBut perhaps our students will be Bond heroes.\n\n46:25.760 --> 46:27.760\nFinally, they're placed in a pit in a broken pool queues\n\n46:27.760 --> 46:29.760\nbetween them.\n\n46:29.760 --> 46:32.760\nThe one super student that emerges from that pit\n\n46:32.760 --> 46:35.760\ngoes to the moon.\n\n46:35.760 --> 46:37.760\nActually, it's to go to Harvard.\n\n46:37.760 --> 46:41.760\nNo, but I just, please forgive me.\n\n46:41.760 --> 46:44.760\nSo you're saying it's a program.\n\n46:44.760 --> 46:45.760\nIt's not a school.\n\n46:45.760 --> 46:47.760\nIt's not a geographically located thing.\n\n46:47.760 --> 46:48.760\nIt's a program.\n\n46:48.760 --> 46:49.760\nIt's geographically located.\n\n46:49.760 --> 46:50.760\nIt's just not located on a campus.\n\n46:50.760 --> 46:52.760\nIt's located in the cities.\n\n46:52.760 --> 46:53.760\nOK.\n\n46:53.760 --> 46:57.760\nBut everywhere these people are going, the faculty,\n\n46:57.760 --> 47:01.760\nyou're not invading existing schools and saying,\n\n47:01.760 --> 47:03.760\nlet's piggyback on your infrastructure.\n\n47:03.760 --> 47:05.760\nYou have your own teachers, your own curriculum.\n\n47:05.760 --> 47:07.760\nWe have our own professors, our own curriculum.\n\n47:07.760 --> 47:09.760\nAnd the curriculum, the way it's structured is,\n\n47:09.760 --> 47:12.760\nin the first year, they spend the entire first year\n\n47:12.760 --> 47:14.760\ntraining their minds.\n\n47:14.760 --> 47:16.760\nThey learn four systems of thought.\n\n47:16.760 --> 47:18.760\nWe're talking about complex systems, basically.\n\n47:18.760 --> 47:21.760\nWe're talking about, at the beginning, how we are all\n\n47:21.760 --> 47:22.760\ncomplex systems, right?\n\n47:22.760 --> 47:25.760\nAnywhere from people to animals to...\n\n47:25.760 --> 47:27.760\nThe first year is how to think.\n\n47:27.760 --> 47:29.760\nThe first year is systems of thinking, right?\n\n47:29.760 --> 47:32.760\nSo how to use logic and reasoning and statistics.\n\n47:32.760 --> 47:34.760\nHow to look at the world around you\n\n47:34.760 --> 47:37.760\nand understand how things work when data isn't clear.\n\n47:37.760 --> 47:39.760\nHow to think about unintended consequences\n\n47:39.760 --> 47:40.760\nand effective interactions.\n\n47:40.760 --> 47:42.760\nHow to think about how to communicate effectively.\n\n47:42.760 --> 47:44.760\nSo one of the things that you were talking about\n\n47:44.760 --> 47:46.760\nis one of the things we actually teach.\n\n47:46.760 --> 47:47.760\nIt's called audience, right?\n\n47:47.760 --> 47:50.760\nHashtag audience, which is a habit of mind\n\n47:50.760 --> 47:53.760\nto understand who it is that you're talking to\n\n47:53.760 --> 47:55.760\nbefore you start talking, right?\n\n47:55.760 --> 47:58.760\nTo actually understand how are they going to receive\n\n47:58.760 --> 47:59.760\nwhat I'm saying?\n\n47:59.760 --> 48:02.760\nAnd by the way, there's the corollary to that,\n\n48:02.760 --> 48:05.760\nwhich is, why are they saying those things to me?\n\n48:05.760 --> 48:07.760\nWhat are they actually...\n\n48:07.760 --> 48:09.760\nWhat is the question behind the question\n\n48:09.760 --> 48:11.760\nor the statement behind the statement?\n\n48:11.760 --> 48:12.760\nSo that's like communication theory.\n\n48:12.760 --> 48:13.760\nSo that's part of...\n\n48:13.760 --> 48:14.760\nEffective communication.\n\n48:14.760 --> 48:16.760\nWell, that seems like that's compatible\n\n48:16.760 --> 48:19.760\nwith modern problematization.\n\n48:19.760 --> 48:20.760\nYes.\n\n48:20.760 --> 48:25.760\nTo pronounce it in the original French.\n\n48:25.760 --> 48:28.760\nProblematization, which can be...\n\n48:28.760 --> 48:31.760\nWhich I heard a student explaining to me about\n\n48:31.760 --> 48:33.760\nthat you're picking apart things and then I looked it up.\n\n48:33.760 --> 48:34.760\nLike, what is this?\n\n48:34.760 --> 48:36.760\nIt's like a sort of digestive process\n\n48:36.760 --> 48:37.760\nof any piece of information.\n\n48:37.760 --> 48:39.760\nYou can just look around your world\n\n48:39.760 --> 48:40.760\nand start corroding it.\n\n48:40.760 --> 48:41.760\nCorrect.\n\n48:41.760 --> 48:42.760\nWhich...\n\n48:42.760 --> 48:43.760\nAnd you don't like the word filter, which is right.\n\n48:43.760 --> 48:45.760\nI think about it as lenses.\n\n48:45.760 --> 48:47.760\nWe give you a hundred different lenses\n\n48:47.760 --> 48:49.760\nto sharpen your view of the world.\n\n48:49.760 --> 48:51.760\nDon't lens this filter light?\n\n48:51.760 --> 48:52.760\nOkay.\n\n48:52.760 --> 48:53.760\nThat's true.\n\n48:53.760 --> 48:55.760\nThey focus, they focus, they focus light, right?\n\n48:55.760 --> 48:56.760\nOkay, I'm just saying.\n\n48:56.760 --> 48:58.760\nBut it is fantastic to...\n\n48:58.760 --> 49:01.760\nYeah, because I feel like if there's one thing\n\n49:01.760 --> 49:03.760\noff of it, I'm Generation X.\n\n49:03.760 --> 49:05.760\nI'm the David Cross, Jeanine Garofalo,\n\n49:05.760 --> 49:07.760\nBrandon Johnson generation.\n\n49:07.760 --> 49:14.760\nI floated my boat for the longest time.\n\n49:14.760 --> 49:15.760\nBrandon and I have talked about this,\n\n49:15.760 --> 49:17.760\nhow our generation kind of...\n\n49:17.760 --> 49:22.760\nWe weren't like millennials, however, we were...\n\n49:22.760 --> 49:24.760\nYou know, lazy is lazy.\n\n49:24.760 --> 49:26.760\nLike, we learned how to be anti-corporate\n\n49:26.760 --> 49:27.760\nwhen we were 25.\n\n49:27.760 --> 49:31.760\nWe learned how Jamba Juice is just fucking bullshit.\n\n49:31.760 --> 49:32.760\nIt's all sugar.\n\n49:32.760 --> 49:34.760\nEverything with a little C in a circle\n\n49:34.760 --> 49:35.760\nor a TM on it is bullshit.\n\n49:35.760 --> 49:36.760\nAnd everything in the corporate is bullshit.\n\n49:36.760 --> 49:38.760\nMoney is bullshit and all this stuff.\n\n49:38.760 --> 49:39.760\nWe didn't...\n\n49:39.760 --> 49:41.760\nAnd then the millennials started rubbing us\n\n49:41.760 --> 49:42.760\nthe wrong way because they're like,\n\n49:42.760 --> 49:43.760\nI don't know, I love recycling.\n\n49:43.760 --> 49:44.760\nBut if the president tells me to do it,\n\n49:44.760 --> 49:45.760\nmy mom's my best friend.\n\n49:45.760 --> 49:47.760\nAnd they're like, these people are going to be fascists\n\n49:47.760 --> 49:49.760\nif they intersect with the right president.\n\n49:49.760 --> 49:51.760\nAnd I am on record in this podcast of saying that\n\n49:51.760 --> 49:53.760\nif you can bear it, scroll back through this\n\n49:53.760 --> 49:54.760\nhorrible fucking podcast.\n\n49:54.760 --> 49:56.760\nHowever, I also went and bought a gun\n\n49:56.760 --> 49:57.760\nand some things didn't go my way.\n\n49:57.760 --> 49:59.760\nI've also said horrible things and made rape jokes.\n\n49:59.760 --> 50:00.760\nAll right.\n\n50:00.760 --> 50:01.760\nSo don't go back.\n\n50:01.760 --> 50:02.760\nDon't go back.\n\n50:05.760 --> 50:07.760\nThe place where we intersect is I think\n\n50:07.760 --> 50:12.760\nlike our generation, my generation is like...\n\n50:12.760 --> 50:15.760\nThat's like a little bit of paprika, a little pepper.\n\n50:15.760 --> 50:17.760\nIt's like, could we please just change lenses\n\n50:17.760 --> 50:19.760\nconstantly and always look at everything\n\n50:19.760 --> 50:20.760\nand see who's gaining and who's losing\n\n50:20.760 --> 50:22.760\nand question everything and kind of like\n\n50:22.760 --> 50:24.760\nbe jaded about it a little bit?\n\n50:24.760 --> 50:25.760\nAbsolutely.\n\n50:25.760 --> 50:26.760\nBut you don't need to be jaded.\n\n50:26.760 --> 50:28.760\nYou just have to actually just look at it.\n\n50:28.760 --> 50:30.760\nYou actually have to get down to the core\n\n50:30.760 --> 50:32.760\nof what the issues are, right?\n\n50:32.760 --> 50:34.760\nAnd I think that's actually where our generation...\n\n50:34.760 --> 50:35.760\nWe were primed.\n\n50:35.760 --> 50:37.760\nI think probably this is why, you know,\n\n50:37.760 --> 50:39.760\nI came up with this concept, which is\n\n50:39.760 --> 50:41.760\nwhen I went to college, that's what I was primed for.\n\n50:41.760 --> 50:43.760\nI was primed for exactly that.\n\n50:43.760 --> 50:44.760\nI wanted to go to college.\n\n50:44.760 --> 50:46.760\nWell, in movies and TV, that's what it always is.\n\n50:46.760 --> 50:48.760\nIt's always like these crazy thematic\n\n50:48.760 --> 50:50.760\nJohn Hausmann's at the front going,\n\n50:50.760 --> 50:53.760\nI expect you to work so much harder than you ever...\n\n50:53.760 --> 50:55.760\nAnd then the people turn their papers in\n\n50:55.760 --> 50:57.760\nand it's like, look, I'm sorry,\n\n50:57.760 --> 50:59.760\nprofessor, I just didn't agree with you on this one.\n\n50:59.760 --> 51:02.760\nAnd that's why you call me.\n\n51:02.760 --> 51:06.760\nEverything like colleges as depicted in our culture\n\n51:06.760 --> 51:08.760\nare these places where you're fucking...\n\n51:08.760 --> 51:11.760\nThe bullshit starts off campus.\n\n51:11.760 --> 51:12.760\nThat's why I can't state.\n\n51:12.760 --> 51:13.760\nThat's why they...\n\n51:13.760 --> 51:15.760\nThat's why I can't state tip top.\n\n51:15.760 --> 51:18.760\nIt's like they fucking invaded the goddamn\n\n51:18.760 --> 51:21.760\nPentagon of culture.\n\n51:21.760 --> 51:22.760\nOur children, our youth.\n\n51:22.760 --> 51:24.760\nYou're allowed to protest.\n\n51:24.760 --> 51:25.760\nYou're allowed to...\n\n51:25.760 --> 51:27.760\nThey sent the National Guard onto a campus\n\n51:27.760 --> 51:29.760\nand someone got shot and it was like,\n\n51:29.760 --> 51:30.760\nthis is over now.\n\n51:30.760 --> 51:31.760\nYou fucked up.\n\n51:31.760 --> 51:33.760\nJust as when a journalist getting shot\n\n51:33.760 --> 51:35.760\nin the roaring 20s is the reason organized crime\n\n51:35.760 --> 51:36.760\ngot shut the fuck down.\n\n51:36.760 --> 51:37.760\nYou shut a journalist.\n\n51:37.760 --> 51:39.760\nIt was like, always there was this respect\n\n51:39.760 --> 51:43.760\nfor these things that should have kept me safe.\n\n51:43.760 --> 51:47.760\nThis is a heavy podcast.\n\n51:47.760 --> 51:48.760\nNo, it's a selfish one.\n\n51:48.760 --> 51:51.760\nIt's where I come to just plea with the cameras.\n\n51:51.760 --> 51:53.760\nI go, can you hear the shelling?\n\n51:53.760 --> 51:55.760\nSomeone send me blood.\n\n51:55.760 --> 51:58.760\nPlease, someone send us blood.\n\n51:58.760 --> 51:59.760\nWhat are you, Dan?\n\n51:59.760 --> 52:00.760\nI'm an O-positive.\n\n52:00.760 --> 52:01.760\nYou know what?\n\n52:01.760 --> 52:04.760\nI think you should be a little more O-negative sometimes.\n\n52:04.760 --> 52:08.760\nThat's the problem with your generation.\n\n52:08.760 --> 52:12.760\nSo, okay.\n\n52:12.760 --> 52:14.760\nI want to continue to talk to you.\n\n52:14.760 --> 52:15.760\nWe have a full show tonight.\n\n52:15.760 --> 52:16.760\nWe've also got...\n\n52:16.760 --> 52:17.760\nI think somebody that's going to blend very well with you,\n\n52:17.760 --> 52:18.760\nI think.\n\n52:18.760 --> 52:19.760\nThat or we're going to get...\n\n52:19.760 --> 52:20.760\nThe tanks are going to roll through the building\n\n52:20.760 --> 52:22.760\nonce the two of you are together.\n\n52:22.760 --> 52:26.760\nBut I just want to...\n\n52:26.760 --> 52:28.760\nJust a little personal background.\n\n52:28.760 --> 52:29.760\nCome on, Ben Nelson.\n\n52:29.760 --> 52:31.760\nStop avoiding intimacy.\n\n52:31.760 --> 52:32.760\nWho are you?\n\n52:32.760 --> 52:35.760\nHow'd you end up on this warpath?\n\n52:35.760 --> 52:37.760\nHow'd I end up on the warpath?\n\n52:37.760 --> 52:38.760\nIt was pretty simple.\n\n52:38.760 --> 52:42.760\nI went to college, idealistic, 18-year-old,\n\n52:42.760 --> 52:45.760\nassuming John Hausman will be teaching me all of my classes.\n\n52:45.760 --> 52:49.760\nBut also that you'd be allowed to be John Kuzak in a sure thing.\n\n52:49.760 --> 52:51.760\nThat was the other half of the college dream,\n\n52:51.760 --> 52:53.760\nwas that you could go,\n\n52:53.760 --> 52:54.760\nyou know what?\n\n52:54.760 --> 52:56.760\nI'm a fucking whiz English major.\n\n52:56.760 --> 52:59.760\nI'm going to skip the midterm,\n\n52:59.760 --> 53:01.760\nbut I'm going to make it up on the...\n\n53:01.760 --> 53:03.760\nYou know, it's like you cut classes.\n\n53:03.760 --> 53:04.760\nThat was part...\n\n53:04.760 --> 53:05.760\nYou're grown up now.\n\n53:05.760 --> 53:06.760\nYou're not a high school student anymore.\n\n53:06.760 --> 53:07.760\nYou're an adult.\n\n53:07.760 --> 53:08.760\nYou make your choices.\n\n53:08.760 --> 53:11.760\nAnd a lot of college dramas would feature that moment\n\n53:11.760 --> 53:13.760\nwhere the kid would have to come to terms.\n\n53:13.760 --> 53:14.760\nIt's like, yeah, but you're scheduling your time\n\n53:14.760 --> 53:16.760\nand you're picking your priorities.\n\n53:16.760 --> 53:19.760\nYeah, and in fact, I found that I could schedule my time completely\n\n53:19.760 --> 53:20.760\nbecause I never needed to go to class\n\n53:20.760 --> 53:21.760\nbecause the classes were...\n\n53:21.760 --> 53:23.760\nI mean, they just read books out loud to you\n\n53:23.760 --> 53:24.760\nand I could read them on my own.\n\n53:24.760 --> 53:27.760\nYeah, that's what my college experience was like.\n\n53:27.760 --> 53:28.760\nYeah, and I didn't like that.\n\n53:28.760 --> 53:30.760\nI actually wanted to learn something.\n\n53:30.760 --> 53:31.760\nI could just buy a textbook.\n\n53:31.760 --> 53:32.760\nExactly, right?\n\n53:32.760 --> 53:34.760\nAnd so I thought that, you know,\n\n53:34.760 --> 53:39.760\nchoice in college should be made when I was ready for it.\n\n53:39.760 --> 53:40.760\nRight?\n\n53:40.760 --> 53:42.760\nI'm actually not a big fan of choice right at the beginning\n\n53:42.760 --> 53:44.760\nbecause I'm still a kid.\n\n53:44.760 --> 53:47.760\nI have no idea what I'm doing at that point.\n\n53:47.760 --> 53:49.760\nHigh school's over, you piece of shit.\n\n53:49.760 --> 53:54.760\nAnd part of that should be like the mama cat\n\n53:54.760 --> 53:57.760\ndrops a crippled mouse, like not a dead one.\n\n53:57.760 --> 53:58.760\nYeah.\n\n53:58.760 --> 54:03.760\nMeaning you can go do stand-up Wednesday nights.\n\n54:03.760 --> 54:04.760\nRight, right.\n\n54:04.760 --> 54:07.760\nAnd then your grade's going to lower it down just a little bit.\n\n54:07.760 --> 54:08.760\nYou're going to get enough free agency.\n\n54:08.760 --> 54:10.760\nYou can make those choices, exactly.\n\n54:10.760 --> 54:15.760\nI'm just saying I should have had better grades at Marquette\n\n54:15.760 --> 54:17.760\nif there's one thing we can establish.\n\n54:17.760 --> 54:19.760\nI should not have gotten an F in English.\n\n54:19.760 --> 54:20.760\nIt is.\n\n54:20.760 --> 54:21.760\nI've been walking around that.\n\n54:21.760 --> 54:25.760\nI need to go to Gimlet Media with my heavyweight episode\n\n54:25.760 --> 54:28.760\nabout how I need to confront my college TA.\n\n54:28.760 --> 54:30.760\nWhy did you get an F?\n\n54:30.760 --> 54:31.760\nIt was a systemic thing.\n\n54:31.760 --> 54:33.760\nWere you not taking the drafts?\n\n54:33.760 --> 54:36.760\nLiterally, they tell you your grade drops a grade level\n\n54:36.760 --> 54:38.760\nif you skip a class.\n\n54:38.760 --> 54:39.760\nOkay.\n\n54:39.760 --> 54:40.760\nI'm dead.\n\n54:40.760 --> 54:41.760\nWow.\n\n54:41.760 --> 54:42.760\nThat's amazing.\n\n54:42.760 --> 54:43.760\nI never had that.\n\n54:43.760 --> 54:44.760\nSo it wasn't about skill.\n\n54:44.760 --> 54:47.760\nThey were also starting a new thing called cooperative education,\n\n54:47.760 --> 54:49.760\nwhich is where the class shows up.\n\n54:49.760 --> 54:50.760\nThere's a TA.\n\n54:50.760 --> 54:52.760\nThe TA breaks everybody into groups.\n\n54:52.760 --> 54:53.760\nBoom.\n\n54:53.760 --> 54:54.760\nAnd the group gets a grade.\n\n54:54.760 --> 54:55.760\nShares a grade.\n\n54:55.760 --> 54:56.760\nOh, yeah.\n\n54:56.760 --> 54:57.760\nRight, sure.\n\n54:57.760 --> 55:00.760\nSo that was very offensive to my young, like,\n\n55:00.760 --> 55:05.760\nif you had transplanted me into today, like I was, you know,\n\n55:05.760 --> 55:09.760\nI was at risk of alt-right indoctrination.\n\n55:09.760 --> 55:11.760\nBut see, here's what I would make the argument.\n\n55:11.760 --> 55:14.760\nI would make the argument that if your university did its job,\n\n55:14.760 --> 55:16.760\nyou wouldn't have missed any classes.\n\n55:16.760 --> 55:19.760\nYou would have gone to class because it would have actually,\n\n55:19.760 --> 55:21.760\nyou would have seen your mind develop.\n\n55:21.760 --> 55:25.760\nYou'd say, oh my God, I am smarter this week than I was last week,\n\n55:25.760 --> 55:27.760\nand I'm not going to miss out on that opportunity.\n\n55:27.760 --> 55:29.760\nAnd sometimes you do have to put in some structure.\n\n55:29.760 --> 55:31.760\nThe problem is when you put in structure,\n\n55:31.760 --> 55:33.760\nand then the university doesn't deliver.\n\n55:33.760 --> 55:35.760\nYou got to show up, and then you show up, and you're like,\n\n55:35.760 --> 55:36.760\nwhy don't I show up?\n\n55:36.760 --> 55:38.760\nYou show up, and then your TA is reading Ray Bradbury\n\n55:38.760 --> 55:42.760\nand texting while you sit in a circle of desks\n\n55:42.760 --> 55:44.760\nwith all your fellow freshmen going,\n\n55:44.760 --> 55:45.760\nI don't know what you want to do.\n\n55:45.760 --> 55:46.760\nI don't know what you want to do.\n\n55:46.760 --> 55:47.760\nExactly.\n\n55:47.760 --> 55:48.760\nExactly.\n\n55:48.760 --> 55:49.760\nWhat if we wrote a paper about licorice?\n\n55:49.760 --> 55:53.760\nOh, so, OK.\n\n55:53.760 --> 55:57.760\nSo not to avoid intimacy, I came up with this idea\n\n55:57.760 --> 55:59.760\nwhen I was a freshman, basically how to fix the curriculum\n\n55:59.760 --> 56:01.760\nof my university.\n\n56:01.760 --> 56:04.760\nAnd I spent four years trying to argue for people to listen.\n\n56:04.760 --> 56:05.760\nNobody cared.\n\n56:05.760 --> 56:07.760\nOh, they must have loved you.\n\n56:07.760 --> 56:08.760\nThey didn't even care.\n\n56:08.760 --> 56:09.760\nThey didn't even care.\n\n56:09.760 --> 56:15.760\nAnd now that I'm here, I'd like to put up some wallpaper.\n\n56:15.760 --> 56:19.760\nSo, you know, I tried for four years, and I gave up.\n\n56:19.760 --> 56:20.760\nWow.\n\n56:20.760 --> 56:21.760\nAnd I said, what can I do?\n\n56:21.760 --> 56:22.760\nI couldn't do anything.\n\n56:22.760 --> 56:24.760\nI was on all these committees and all the rest.\n\n56:24.760 --> 56:25.760\nNothing could happen.\n\n56:25.760 --> 56:27.760\nSo I gave up, and I said, you know,\n\n56:27.760 --> 56:30.760\nI think education is kind of important.\n\n56:30.760 --> 56:32.760\nI think it's kind of important for universities\n\n56:32.760 --> 56:33.760\nto actually educate students.\n\n56:33.760 --> 56:36.760\nAnd my guess is this is going to have some bad effects\n\n56:36.760 --> 56:39.760\nin the real world, but who knows, right?\n\n56:39.760 --> 56:40.760\nWho do I know?\n\n56:40.760 --> 56:43.760\nI'm an, you know, uneducated 21-year-old.\n\n56:43.760 --> 56:45.760\nI just have a university degree.\n\n56:45.760 --> 56:47.760\nSo I went out into the real world,\n\n56:47.760 --> 56:49.760\nand then I encountered human beings.\n\n56:49.760 --> 56:51.760\nAnd I encountered human beings in positions\n\n56:51.760 --> 56:55.760\nof pretty dramatic levels of decision-making.\n\n56:55.760 --> 56:58.760\nAnd they were intelligent, high IQ.\n\n56:58.760 --> 56:59.760\nThey were well-meaning.\n\n56:59.760 --> 57:00.760\nThey wanted to do good things.\n\n57:00.760 --> 57:04.760\nAnd they were making awful, awful decisions\n\n57:04.760 --> 57:07.760\nthat impacted a lot of people's lives, right?\n\n57:07.760 --> 57:10.760\nI saw it in the working world, corporate world.\n\n57:10.760 --> 57:11.760\nPeople were like making decisions,\n\n57:11.760 --> 57:13.760\nand companies were going out of business\n\n57:13.760 --> 57:15.760\nand making bone-headed moves.\n\n57:15.760 --> 57:17.760\nI saw it obviously in politics.\n\n57:17.760 --> 57:18.760\nI saw it everywhere.\n\n57:18.760 --> 57:22.760\nAnd it just got worse and worse and worse.\n\n57:22.760 --> 57:28.760\nAnd by the way, it wasn't even a partisan thing, right?\n\n57:28.760 --> 57:32.760\nI could even track when, you know,\n\n57:32.760 --> 57:36.760\nan era has gone by when you look fondly back at any,\n\n57:36.760 --> 57:40.760\nany, you know, government that we had over the past 20-some years.\n\n57:40.760 --> 57:42.760\nAnd you say, well, look, you know,\n\n57:42.760 --> 57:45.760\nyou had Congress controlled on the right, on the left, et cetera.\n\n57:45.760 --> 57:47.760\nYou never look back and say, oh, my God, boy,\n\n57:47.760 --> 57:49.760\nwasn't that like a look at what, you know,\n\n57:49.760 --> 57:52.760\nthe House of Representatives was able to do in 1996\n\n57:52.760 --> 57:55.760\nor what did the Senate were able to do in 2002 or 2007?\n\n57:55.760 --> 58:00.760\nThese were generally not well-functioning organizations, right?\n\n58:00.760 --> 58:05.760\nAnd they've just gotten progressively worse over time.\n\n58:05.760 --> 58:07.760\nYou are an educational activist.\n\n58:07.760 --> 58:09.760\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n58:09.760 --> 58:10.760\nYou're a disruptor.\n\n58:10.760 --> 58:11.760\nNo.\n\n58:11.760 --> 58:13.760\nYou're an obstructionist.\n\n58:13.760 --> 58:14.760\nWe don't believe in disruption.\n\n58:14.760 --> 58:15.760\nWe want to reform.\n\n58:15.760 --> 58:16.760\nWe want to reform.\n\n58:16.760 --> 58:20.760\nYeah, that's super interesting because nobody is standing up\n\n58:20.760 --> 58:24.760\nfor the rest of us in terms of getting educated.\n\n58:24.760 --> 58:27.760\nAnd it does seem as though universities have gotten more about\n\n58:27.760 --> 58:31.760\ncan we do business in terms of agriculture?\n\n58:31.760 --> 58:34.760\nCan we do medicine?\n\n58:34.760 --> 58:36.760\nCan we do law?\n\n58:36.760 --> 58:38.760\nCan we do business?\n\n58:38.760 --> 58:39.760\nThey don't do architecture.\n\n58:39.760 --> 58:40.760\nThey don't do dance.\n\n58:40.760 --> 58:42.760\nThey don't do art anymore.\n\n58:42.760 --> 58:45.760\nThey don't do any of the things that really fuel those three things\n\n58:45.760 --> 58:46.760\nthat I listed initially.\n\n58:46.760 --> 58:49.760\nAnd again, from our perspective, totally right.\n\n58:49.760 --> 58:53.760\nAnd the most tragic, they no longer do general education.\n\n58:53.760 --> 58:59.760\nGeneral education is the most important role of an undergraduate degree.\n\n58:59.760 --> 59:02.760\nThat's why it's called an undergraduate degree.\n\n59:02.760 --> 59:06.760\nIt's supposed to train the mind so that when you then figure out\n\n59:06.760 --> 59:08.760\nwhat you want to do, you go to get a graduate degree\n\n59:08.760 --> 59:10.760\nor you go into the workforce or what have you\n\n59:10.760 --> 59:15.760\nand then use the general systemic thinking, those general ideas.\n\n59:15.760 --> 59:18.760\nThis all goes back to capitalism.\n\n59:18.760 --> 59:21.760\nWell, that's an easy thing to say.\n\n59:21.760 --> 59:27.760\nBecause it goes back to when I'm 15 years old in 1989\n\n59:27.760 --> 59:31.760\nin Brown, Deer, Wisconsin, it's happening around me.\n\n59:31.760 --> 59:32.760\nI'm not aware of it yet.\n\n59:32.760 --> 59:36.760\nBut looking back on it, I'm aware that programs are being lifted and pulled.\n\n59:36.760 --> 59:39.760\nNow, some of them are...\n\n59:39.760 --> 59:41.760\nWell, actually at that time, all the programs that were being lifted\n\n59:41.760 --> 59:43.760\nand pulled were like trade programs.\n\n59:43.760 --> 59:47.760\nMy best friend Dave Friedel, who's been on the podcast and stuff,\n\n59:47.760 --> 59:52.760\nhe was a huge beneficiary of the...\n\n59:52.760 --> 59:55.760\nThere was a program at my high school where,\n\n59:55.760 --> 59:58.760\nif you were really interested in food service,\n\n59:58.760 --> 01:00:02.760\nyou could take classes at our high school and then there was an internship\n\n01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:03.760\nand there was all these things.\n\n01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.760\nAnd he was like one of the last people through that chute\n\n01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.760\nand was able to...\n\n01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.760\nHe's not now Wolfgang Puck.\n\n01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:11.760\nHe's now a fucking coder.\n\n01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:16.760\nHe's got a digital job.\n\n01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:22.760\nBut he was able to not slip through the cracks and fall into fucking hell\n\n01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:26.760\nbecause he wasn't a guy...\n\n01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:28.760\nHe had a different kind of...\n\n01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:31.760\nHe didn't excel on tests or in geometry or whatever,\n\n01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:35.760\nbut he was fucking nailing it in these food service classes.\n\n01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.760\nThere was programs in every public high school.\n\n01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.760\nThere would be like tendrils going into...\n\n01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.760\nYou're a dirt ball.\n\n01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.760\nThat's what I affectionately call them.\n\n01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:47.760\nWe have a fucking auto shop at our high school\n\n01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.760\nand then also we have paths for you.\n\n01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:53.760\nThey are not like in the old world European class system\n\n01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.760\nlike, oh, you were born in this tax bracket,\n\n01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.760\nso you're going to be a mechanic.\n\n01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:02.760\nIt's more like, hey, you can't stop making horrible jokes to the teacher after class\n\n01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:06.760\nand you don't also care about isosceles triangles.\n\n01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.760\nBut there are opportunities.\n\n01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:13.760\nThere's fingers everywhere for all of our kids.\n\n01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:18.760\nYou could end up being a genius, proving that you were a genius\n\n01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:22.760\nin something that wasn't necessarily testing well in this or that area.\n\n01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:27.760\nThat's what was happening when I was 15 going on all around me.\n\n01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:32.760\nThen the follow-up to that is really that they started caving in on the other side.\n\n01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.760\nThe school papers started shutting down.\n\n01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:38.760\nThe first time after I went to visit my school paper editor,\n\n01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.760\nhe's like, no, no more school paper.\n\n01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:43.760\nYou were one of the last ones.\n\n01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:46.760\nWe don't train kids to be creative anymore.\n\n01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:48.760\nWe train them to pass English tests.\n\n01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.760\nNow, the obvious answer to all of this,\n\n01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:53.760\nand we've all watched everyone in my audience have probably seen these documentaries,\n\n01:01:53.760 --> 01:02:01.760\nit's because of the government agencies who are, I guess, accountable to their voters\n\n01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:07.760\nthat say to the school districts, oh, you've got to make your kids smarter.\n\n01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:11.760\nThey're terrible people now. They're rapists and murderers and carjackers.\n\n01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:12.760\nMake them smarter.\n\n01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:16.760\nThen the schools go, okay, we're going to, and then this weird thing happens\n\n01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:20.760\nwhere the tests become, everyone's just being trained to pass tests.\n\n01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:23.760\nOtherwise, the schools lose their funding and all this stuff.\n\n01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:29.760\nThen meanwhile, on the 1% side, all of these campuses used to be the places where,\n\n01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:32.760\nfuck society, fuck your parents even.\n\n01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:36.760\nYeah, they paid for tuition, but they paid tuition because, you know what,\n\n01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:40.760\nthis is a burgeoning industry, this idea of shaping your young adult mind.\n\n01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:45.760\nYour parents are going to pay 50 grand and they're going to get a hippie spit out of this chute,\n\n01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:48.760\nand they're going to be like, what the fuck did I pay for him?\n\n01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:50.760\nWe're going to be like a genius.\n\n01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:54.760\nThere was leeway there, but then from all sides,\n\n01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:56.760\nyou've been telling me about this.\n\n01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:02.760\nThere was this shift in the 80s, 90s, where it was basically, in general,\n\n01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:10.760\nfinancial institutions started hanging out at the bars where government hung out at\n\n01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:13.760\nand started going, hey, you want a pack of cigarettes?\n\n01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:14.760\nFollow me to my van.\n\n01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:20.760\nAnd then all government became slowly, like it metastasized this entire thing.\n\n01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:27.760\nThe separation of government and business just disappeared,\n\n01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.760\nand now government has just taken it up the butt,\n\n01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:33.760\nand they're not using that derogatorily, because they're enjoying it,\n\n01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:36.760\nand they have a right to do it.\n\n01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.760\nReally, we need new colloquialism.\n\n01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:44.760\nWe need new ways of stating, like, we need a new word for pussy,\n\n01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:45.760\nand we need to do it.\n\n01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:46.760\nI've been thinking that.\n\n01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.760\nYou can't be David Mamet anymore.\n\n01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:52.760\nYou're going to swallow my cum, you fucking faggot pussy.\n\n01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.760\nWe need all curse words.\n\n01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:58.760\nYou might have an important point about dynamics.\n\n01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:01.760\nSo I don't know if this was a nefarious plan,\n\n01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:03.760\nbut it certainly evolved this way.\n\n01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.760\nAnd again, I think it's a lot because of unintended consequences.\n\n01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:13.760\nSo give me an example of, at least from my perspective, a lot of these things changed.\n\n01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:18.760\nIn the early 1980s, U.S. News and World Report came out with ranking of colleges.\n\n01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:26.760\nAnd I would argue that that event actually accelerated all of these previous inclinations\n\n01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.760\nthat the institutions had, but never really acted upon,\n\n01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.760\nbecause it was never really in their interest.\n\n01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:34.760\nAll of a sudden, they're in their interest to do stupid things,\n\n01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:37.760\nlike restrict the number of students that come to the university,\n\n01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.760\nbecause they wanted to have low acceptance rates,\n\n01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:42.760\nand then have a lot of professors for every student.\n\n01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.760\nBut if you don't actually want the professor to teach the students,\n\n01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.760\nyou want them to be in the lab doing research,\n\n01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:50.760\nand then you want them to spend as much money as possible on that professor to do research\n\n01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.760\nso that you would go up in the rankings.\n\n01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:54.760\nAnd if you did that, guess what?\n\n01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:59.760\nYou need a lot of rich kids to support this constricted number of seats.\n\n01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.760\nAnd the reverse would be a party school.\n\n01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.760\nYou would show pictures of the football team.\n\n01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:07.760\nYou'd show pictures of great fans and people spring breaking it up.\n\n01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:08.760\nExactly.\n\n01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:12.760\nBoth of those have in common, and all of that has in common with, meanwhile,\n\n01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:16.760\nin the inner cities of kids being pushed through that can pass tests.\n\n01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:22.760\nAll of that goes back to the hydra of capitalism, which isn't a bad thing,\n\n01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.760\nunless, well, maybe it is a bad thing.\n\n01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:31.760\nWell, it's bad because what happens in the outcome is that if the school,\n\n01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:34.760\nand this is kind of where it comes back to the banks and everybody else,\n\n01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:37.760\nthose institutions want to hire, ultimately,\n\n01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:41.760\nand wind up hiring the sons and daughters of rich people.\n\n01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:47.760\nIf you trust the US dollar to measure everything,\n\n01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:51.760\nif you trust it to give equivalence,\n\n01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.760\neverything is going to have a price.\n\n01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.760\nHuman life is going to have a price.\n\n01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:56.760\nWe know this.\n\n01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:57.760\nIt's right under our nose.\n\n01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.760\nWe know that medicine doesn't work privately.\n\n01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:03.760\nWe know that education is not working privately.\n\n01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:08.760\nWell, but it can if you had people think systemically.\n\n01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.760\nSo if the government, rather than saying,\n\n01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:14.760\nwe're just going to subsidize universities and take a blind eye,\n\n01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:18.760\nif in 1965, when federal financial aid got implemented,\n\n01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:23.760\nand all they said would be, any university is eligible for federal financial aid,\n\n01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:28.760\nif and only if the cost of time that university rise at the rate of inflation or lower.\n\n01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:32.760\nIf they just did that, you know how much every university would cost now?\n\n01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:35.760\nWhat we cost, what we cost in tuition and fees.\n\n01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.760\nI wasn't listening to that because I was thinking about,\n\n01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.760\nbecause I've been trying to bring up our second guest,\n\n01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:42.760\nbecause I want to plug this keymaster into this gatekeeper.\n\n01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:47.760\nI don't know if you guys are going to fight or blow up New York.\n\n01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:50.760\nBut let's bring up our old friend, Josh Andraski.\n\n01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:58.760\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:06:58.760 --> 01:06:59.760\nLooking fresh.\n\n01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.760\nLooking fresh.\n\n01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:03.760\nHi, hello.\n\n01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:06.760\nSo socialists are dressing differently now since the last time we talked.\n\n01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:09.760\nYeah, I figured I wouldn't wear a flannel.\n\n01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:14.760\nAnd I'm instead wearing a Shannon and the Clam shirt with two Barts kissing.\n\n01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:16.760\nThat white jacket, though, is dope.\n\n01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:17.760\nThank you.\n\n01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:18.760\nIt's luxury socialist.\n\n01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:20.760\nHave you been taking any of this stuff in, Josh?\n\n01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.760\nYes.\n\n01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:24.760\nSo I'm a little...\n\n01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:27.760\nI'm conflicted personally with my ideology.\n\n01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:32.760\nI agree that I think schools should be public institutions.\n\n01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:36.760\nI think that as a society, we should value education\n\n01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:40.760\nand we should put people in our government that value education.\n\n01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:46.760\nAnd again, the tendrils of capitalism have infected education, healthcare, blah, blah, blah, all that shit.\n\n01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:51.760\nBut I am also very intrigued at you destroying Harvard.\n\n01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:54.760\nReforming, reforming. We want to reform.\n\n01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.760\nI'm an accelerationist.\n\n01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:59.760\nI think that Harvard is the Isis of comedy.\n\n01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.760\nAnd I think that they deserve to go down.\n\n01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:04.760\nThe Isis of comedy.\n\n01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:05.760\nYes.\n\n01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.760\nI mean, just look at SNL.\n\n01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:10.760\nBut the...\n\n01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:15.760\nFor those who don't know, there's a huge rivalry in the comedy community between Harvard and working guys.\n\n01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:18.760\nGuys who fucking actually tell jokes and love it.\n\n01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:19.760\nYeah, it's crazy.\n\n01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:23.760\nBut it's the exact thing where it's like you get into Harvard\n\n01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.760\nbecause you have the same last name as someone who got into Harvard\n\n01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:27.760\nand then, oh my God, look at you.\n\n01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:30.760\nYou're writing on the show that used to be good and is now bad.\n\n01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:33.760\nIt's so weird that there's more Harvard people.\n\n01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:36.760\nThe best Harvard alum is the Unabomber.\n\n01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:38.760\nAnyway.\n\n01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:40.760\nAs a word for the other, I don't know,\n\n01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:44.760\nas a showrunner who has therefore accidentally hired Ivy League guys,\n\n01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:47.760\nlike, you know, I'm looking back now,\n\n01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:49.760\nactually, since the election is like...\n\n01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:53.760\nIn the room, I used to like mock all my Ivy League guys\n\n01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:55.760\nbecause I have class issues because I'm like...\n\n01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.760\nAnd I'm like, they teach you that at Harvard.\n\n01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.760\nThey teach you that, yeah.\n\n01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:01.760\nThey don't teach them anything there.\n\n01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:03.760\nThere is some kind of co-relation.\n\n01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.760\nI just probably not cause effect, but there's a co-relation.\n\n01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.760\nYeah, they keep the lights on.\n\n01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:09.760\nI mean, you've got to have people who actually show up to work.\n\n01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:11.760\nAnd that's the Harvard guys.\n\n01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:14.760\nComedy writing requires a support system.\n\n01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:20.760\nSo if you're from the streets and you want to be a comedy writer,\n\n01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:24.760\nyou're at this huge disadvantage,\n\n01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.760\nwhich at the same time means that,\n\n01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:30.760\nokay, so if you want the veal cutlets,\n\n01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:33.760\nlike, go with the people that had the support system\n\n01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:36.760\nbecause if at 13, if you were Harvard bound\n\n01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:38.760\nand you decided you wanted to be a Harvard writer,\n\n01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:42.760\nyou can then split that assembly line into hacks and geniuses.\n\n01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:46.760\nAnd so there are people that come out of the Ivy League\n\n01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:49.760\nthat knew that they wanted to quit there knowing\n\n01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:51.760\nI don't want to be a comedy writer.\n\n01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:55.760\nAnd I've worked with these guys and like, yeah, it's whatever.\n\n01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:59.760\nI didn't mean to piss on your fun parade\n\n01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.760\nand go like, well, not everybody's everything.\n\n01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:03.760\nHashtag not all Harvard's.\n\n01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:05.760\nAnd it is a fun rivalry.\n\n01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.760\nIt's not a real rivalry.\n\n01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:10.760\nNo, because if it was, they would destroy us.\n\n01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.760\nThey're so rich.\n\n01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:15.760\nThey could get a drone, it'd be over.\n\n01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.760\nBut yeah.\n\n01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:21.760\nWhy isn't education, so if we tomorrow,\n\n01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:24.760\nif we created a utopian base on the moon and we said,\n\n01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:30.760\nokay, nobody up here would privatize any aspect of education,\n\n01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:32.760\nwould we ever?\n\n01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:34.760\nWhat do you mean by privatize?\n\n01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.760\nWell, I mean, charge money for it.\n\n01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:38.760\nI would absolutely.\n\n01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:40.760\nI'll tell you why.\n\n01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:43.760\nNon-profit private universities are still private.\n\n01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:45.760\nBerkeley is public.\n\n01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:47.760\nHarvard is private.\n\n01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:49.760\nStanford is private.\n\n01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.760\nSUNY is public.\n\n01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:54.760\nI'm actually opposed to the idea of free college.\n\n01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:57.760\nAnd I'll tell you why, because it's a regressive policy.\n\n01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.760\nThink about it.\n\n01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:02.760\nSo if you think about college,\n\n01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:05.760\nlet's say not higher education, but just college.\n\n01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:09.760\nLike Louis is playing and people are checking beer's college.\n\n01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:11.760\nYes, that college.\n\n01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.760\nWho goes to college?\n\n01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.760\nRich people.\n\n01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:21.760\nAnd people who are eventually going to be relatively wealthy.\n\n01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:23.760\nWho is the tax base of this country?\n\n01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:25.760\n100% of Americans.\n\n01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.760\nOne way shape or form,\n\n01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:30.760\nyou pay in taxes into this government.\n\n01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:35.760\nAnd so if you say I'm going to take 100% of people's money\n\n01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:40.760\nand effectively give it to rich people who don't need it,\n\n01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:42.760\nand people who will be rich,\n\n01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:44.760\nmaybe some of them do need a leg up,\n\n01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.760\nbut eventually will be able to actually pay back.\n\n01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.760\nI think you're distorting the numbers like crazy.\n\n01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:51.760\nThere's way less rich people than poor people,\n\n01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:53.760\nor there's fewer rich people\n\n01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:56.760\nthan there are people that could use college for free.\n\n01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:00.760\nThe problem is that rich people are overwhelmingly going to college,\n\n01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:02.760\nwhereas poor people in proportion do not.\n\n01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:03.760\nBecause they can't afford it,\n\n01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.760\nand if they could, then they would overwhelmingly go to college.\n\n01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:06.760\nEven if they can't afford it.\n\n01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:08.760\nThe problem goes much earlier.\n\n01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:10.760\nWell, I think that's why I want to decide.\n\n01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:13.760\nI simplified it by saying if we were on the moon,\n\n01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:18.760\nif all we had was a disaster,\n\n01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:21.760\nall we have is a couple cans of air,\n\n01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:25.760\nand some tents, and we got 100 people.\n\n01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:28.760\nAnd we're designing a society now,\n\n01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:32.760\nso we want to pick which parts of our society\n\n01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:35.760\nare driven by the moon dollar,\n\n01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:38.760\nif anything is going to be,\n\n01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:41.760\nif there is going to be a moon dollar, I should say.\n\n01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.760\nThat's what I meant.\n\n01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.760\nIf we're starting from scratch,\n\n01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:48.760\nbecause it sounds like more like you're being more pragmatic.\n\n01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:49.760\nI'm going to be more pragmatic.\n\n01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:50.760\nYou're saying like,\n\n01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.760\noh, if you change this light bulb and plug in this Christmas ornament,\n\n01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:56.760\nI think ideologically,\n\n01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:00.760\nit's like, why would education ever be purchasable?\n\n01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:04.760\nWhy would any child,\n\n01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:09.760\nwhether they're one years old, 25 years old,\n\n01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:10.760\n48 years old,\n\n01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:13.760\nwhy would any student be,\n\n01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:17.760\nif that wants to learn anything,\n\n01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:20.760\nwhy does it benefit your society\n\n01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:23.760\nif the moon is going to go to war with Mars,\n\n01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:26.760\nand the moon has decided to charge money for education,\n\n01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:27.760\nand Mars hasn't,\n\n01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:30.760\nI feel like Mars is going to win in the long run.\n\n01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.760\nNow, we have a different problem here,\n\n01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:34.760\nbecause we can also say legalize everything,\n\n01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:37.760\nbut if we legalize all drugs tomorrow here in our situation,\n\n01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:39.760\nwe're going to have blood on our hands.\n\n01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:41.760\nExcept what's illegal?\n\n01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.760\nWhat drugs are illegal?\n\n01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.760\nWell, I'm just saying that,\n\n01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.760\nthere's a difference between having these conversations\n\n01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:49.760\nwhen there's an existing infrastructure.\n\n01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:51.760\nHow do we move?\n\n01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:52.760\nThere are no silver bullets.\n\n01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.760\nBut within the existing infrastructure,\n\n01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:58.760\nI still think that you're being a little tricky with numbers\n\n01:13:58.760 --> 01:13:59.760\nand with statistics,\n\n01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:02.760\nbecause you say that poor people,\n\n01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:06.760\nregardless of how affordable college is, wouldn't go.\n\n01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:10.760\nNo, I'm all for the why is it regressive.\n\n01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:15.760\nIt's regressive because if you can afford $70,000 a year,\n\n01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:17.760\nand somebody says,\n\n01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:20.760\nI'll let that person go for free on the taxpayer's dollar,\n\n01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:21.760\nthat's insane.\n\n01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:22.760\nI'm totally fine.\n\n01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:23.760\nThat's not insane.\n\n01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:24.760\nI think that's insane.\n\n01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:27.760\nI'm fine giving the six rich people the money\n\n01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:29.760\nif the 94 out of the 100.\n\n01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:32.760\nWe don't know what social class is going to yield\n\n01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.760\nthe doctor that produces the cure for cancer.\n\n01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:36.760\nBut they're going to college anyway.\n\n01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:37.760\nNo, they're not.\n\n01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:38.760\nThey don't need,\n\n01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:39.760\na bunch of them are going to jail.\n\n01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:40.760\nThey do need.\n\n01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:44.760\nNo, the kids that can afford it,\n\n01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:46.760\nmommy and daddy are writing that check.\n\n01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:47.760\nRight.\n\n01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:49.760\nBut the kids who can afford it might be the ones to cure\n\n01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.760\nthe disease that we don't even know we're going to get yet.\n\n01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:52.760\nCorrect.\n\n01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:54.760\nSo we need to focus on them.\n\n01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:57.760\nBut why would you not means test access to college\n\n01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:58.760\ndoesn't make any sense.\n\n01:14:58.760 --> 01:14:59.760\nIf you have the means.\n\n01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.760\nMeans test is interesting,\n\n01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:04.760\nbut denying access will never yield the result.\n\n01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:05.760\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:06.760\nThat's all I'm saying.\n\n01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:07.760\nI'm saying the opposite.\n\n01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.760\nIt was what got us into this problem in the first place\n\n01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:11.760\nwhere if you look throughout the history of America,\n\n01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:14.760\nsweeping programs, you know, for example,\n\n01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:17.760\nyou look at like the golden age of comedy, right?\n\n01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:18.760\nThe golden age of comedy,\n\n01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:21.760\nyou had all these public works, theaters,\n\n01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:23.760\nand places where people could do music.\n\n01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:26.760\nAnd all of these things were funded by a class trader\n\n01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:27.760\nin the White House.\n\n01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:28.760\nRight.\n\n01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:29.760\nAnd so without that,\n\n01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:32.760\nthese broke Jew immigrants that like my come from,\n\n01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:33.760\nyou know,\n\n01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.760\nwouldn't be able to go learn to play the trombone\n\n01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:36.760\nand then become Sid Caesar.\n\n01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:37.760\nSure.\n\n01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:38.760\nYou know.\n\n01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:39.760\nAnd so if it was means tested,\n\n01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:40.760\nit would be like,\n\n01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:43.760\nif you make $14,999,\n\n01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:44.760\nyou get to go to college.\n\n01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:46.760\nIf you make $15,001,\n\n01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:47.760\nyou don't get to go to college.\n\n01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.760\nWell, it's just a badly designed program, right?\n\n01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:52.760\nI mean, but I think it goes beyond that where the idea,\n\n01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:54.760\nand for those that don't understand,\n\n01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:58.760\nthe idea of means testing is to put a sort of line in the sand\n\n01:15:58.760 --> 01:15:59.760\nwhere you go,\n\n01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:00.760\nif you're more poor than this,\n\n01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:01.760\nyou get this,\n\n01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:03.760\nif you're not, you don't.\n\n01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:07.760\nAnd certainly there will be absolutely people\n\n01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:10.760\nthat are rich or who don't need the program,\n\n01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:12.760\nwho will benefit from it.\n\n01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:15.760\nBut if you look, I mean, realistically,\n\n01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:16.760\nat the numbers,\n\n01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:18.760\nthere's far more people who deserve something\n\n01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:19.760\nthat will be getting it.\n\n01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:22.760\nThat's why I believe that health care should be,\n\n01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:23.760\nyou know,\n\n01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:26.760\ntotally free and public and public universities.\n\n01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:28.760\nAnd I actually do think that there is a place\n\n01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:29.760\nfor private universities,\n\n01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:32.760\nfor-profit private universities within the system,\n\n01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:33.760\noptionally,\n\n01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:36.760\nbecause I don't believe in like a stolen thing.\n\n01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.760\nTo me, educational, I guess,\n\n01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:42.760\nprivatization would be analogous with elective surgery.\n\n01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:45.760\nLike, I want to look like Mel Brooks.\n\n01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:48.760\nBut then, okay, then you have to pay for that.\n\n01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:49.760\nThe government doesn't pay for that.\n\n01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:50.760\nBut that's not good.\n\n01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:51.760\nThat's not good,\n\n01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:53.760\nbecause then all of the rich people,\n\n01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:54.760\nthis is what you have today.\n\n01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:57.760\nYou have the poor people going to the poor university,\n\n01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.760\nand you have the rich people going to the rich university.\n\n01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.760\nWhere's Goldman Sachs going to go higher?\n\n01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:03.760\nI mean, hopefully, nowhere near my friends.\n\n01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:05.760\nOkay, well, the point is,\n\n01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:07.760\nwhen it comes to sciences, though,\n\n01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.760\nit doesn't matter which university you go to,\n\n01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:11.760\nit's the results that you yield.\n\n01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:12.760\nIt's the skills that you learn.\n\n01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:13.760\nCorrect.\n\n01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:15.760\nBut then you have to resource those universities\n\n01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.760\nto provide those results.\n\n01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:18.760\nBut that's what happens.\n\n01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:19.760\nRich companies come in,\n\n01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:21.760\nand they buy half of the University of Wisconsin\n\n01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:23.760\nto develop something for their company.\n\n01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:25.760\nBut when you limit access,\n\n01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:28.760\nyou guarantee that you are not going to get the best of it.\n\n01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:29.760\nOh, no, exactly.\n\n01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:31.760\nSo what you have to do is you have to change.\n\n01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:32.760\nSo again, this is a good way.\n\n01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:35.760\nSo I'll give you a solution that I would implement\n\n01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:36.760\nif I were like magic wand.\n\n01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:38.760\nSo my magic wand would be\n\n01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:40.760\nthe government makes a declaration\n\n01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:42.760\nwhich is if you want to be a non-profit,\n\n01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:45.760\nif you want to have any federal dollars,\n\n01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:48.760\nany kind, you know, access to all grants,\n\n01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:50.760\nnot pay taxes and all the rest,\n\n01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:54.760\nvery simply, your student body needs to roughly align\n\n01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:57.760\nto the socioeconomic spectrum in the United States.\n\n01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:58.760\nRight?\n\n01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:01.760\nYou get 10% of your students from the top 10%,\n\n01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.760\n10% of the bottom 10%, and throughout.\n\n01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:04.760\nIf you do not do that,\n\n01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:07.760\nall of your federal funding gone.\n\n01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:08.760\nDeal.\n\n01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:09.760\nRight?\n\n01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.760\nAt that point, you have solved the access problem overnight.\n\n01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:12.760\nYeah.\n\n01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:14.760\nI mean, or you don't have to do anything for free, right?\n\n01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:16.760\nYou just have to actually get those units.\n\n01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:18.760\nSo Harvard won't be 10, 10, 10, 10, 10.\n\n01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.760\nIt would be 10% and 90% from the bottom.\n\n01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:22.760\nIt would take no chances.\n\n01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:23.760\nRight?\n\n01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:25.760\nSo this to me is something that you could do.\n\n01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:28.760\nI feel like that system sounds better for Congress\n\n01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:31.760\nif like Congress had to have like a representative,\n\n01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:34.760\nlike spectrum of wealth as like America.\n\n01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:37.760\nBut if we talk about how you need a college education\n\n01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:40.760\nfor a job, if we talk about how,\n\n01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:42.760\nfor me personally and for a lot of people,\n\n01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.760\nI think education is a human right,\n\n01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:49.760\nthen anything that you do to get rid of access,\n\n01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:54.760\nto limit access to all people is bad.\n\n01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:56.760\nAnd that's not to say that like,\n\n01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:59.760\nif you go to the poor school or whatever,\n\n01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:03.760\nit would be in a situation where because of the taxes,\n\n01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:04.760\nbecause of the money coming in,\n\n01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:08.760\nthere would be all this new money coming into public universities.\n\n01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:10.760\nSo those schools would become better, right?\n\n01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:12.760\nIf there's more people, if there's more perspectives,\n\n01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:14.760\nthere's more money coming in,\n\n01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:17.760\nthen people who go to those schools who luck out\n\n01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:19.760\nand become people who can hire people,\n\n01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:22.760\nthey'll go, I'm not going to hire from Harvard.\n\n01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:24.760\nYou know, like this hypothetical is just as realistic as your hypothetical.\n\n01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:25.760\nCorrect.\n\n01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:30.760\nIf you actually create a much, much more well-resourced,\n\n01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:32.760\neducation-focused public university\n\n01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:34.760\nthat actually teaches people how to think,\n\n01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:36.760\nand you have the privates keeping doing whatever they're doing,\n\n01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.760\nthen you're definitely right, right?\n\n01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:39.760\nYeah, I think...\n\n01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:41.760\nThen the shift, the tide will shift.\n\n01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:42.760\nI think with my drunken brain,\n\n01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:45.760\nI think I'm just dumb enough to perceive\n\n01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:46.760\nthe two smart people are agreeing,\n\n01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:50.760\nbut that you guys are different distances from the problem.\n\n01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:51.760\nYeah.\n\n01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:54.760\nNot distances from the problem being a project.\n\n01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:59.760\nYou were born from it and have a fucking...\n\n01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:03.760\nYou want to dig in and plug this wire into that wire\n\n01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:05.760\nand hot wire this car,\n\n01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:08.760\nand Josh is going like, why fucking cars, man?\n\n01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:12.760\nAnd I think both of you are agreeing,\n\n01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:14.760\nor I'm dumb and drunk,\n\n01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:16.760\nand that's at least half true.\n\n01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:19.760\nI think absolutely that your system has a place\n\n01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:21.760\nwithin the system that I'm imagining.\n\n01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:24.760\nI think that they're absolutely...\n\n01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:29.760\nIt's absurd that the IVs run the way they do\n\n01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:31.760\nwith legacy bullshit and all of that,\n\n01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:33.760\nand that absolutely needs to be reformed,\n\n01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:36.760\nand that there absolutely is a place in the world\n\n01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:39.760\nfor those who choose, electively,\n\n01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:45.760\nto join a for-profit specialized private institution.\n\n01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:48.760\nLike DeVry, or ITT,\n\n01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:50.760\nor several places you could go to.\n\n01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:52.760\nWe'll leave links.\n\n01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:54.760\nYeah, if you use the promo code, whoops,\n\n01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:56.760\nyou can join University of Phoenix right now.\n\n01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:00.760\nWell, if I don't play the bad guy and cut people off,\n\n01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:02.760\nthen no one is.\n\n01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:04.760\nThat's my role,\n\n01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.760\nbecause as you know,\n\n01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:09.760\nif you're new to this podcast, it's time to play Balderdash.\n\n01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:17.760\nAnd so Spencer, are you prepared to...\n\n01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:19.760\nYou're not DMing Balderdash,\n\n01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:21.760\nbecause the part of the game is that\n\n01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:24.760\nwe're going to rotate through dealers, I think.\n\n01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:26.760\nYeah, I think that's part of the game.\n\n01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:28.760\nThe game of Balderdash is simple.\n\n01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:30.760\nHave you guys played Balderdash?\n\n01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:31.760\nNo.\n\n01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:37.760\nEach participant will make up an answer to the question.\n\n01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.760\nYou explain it, you're better.\n\n01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:41.760\nI'm bad at explaining games.\n\n01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:44.760\nWhy don't I dash for the first round?\n\n01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:49.760\nAnd then I think by playing around, it'll become...\n\n01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:50.760\nLearn by doing.\n\n01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:52.760\nYeah, it's pretty simple.\n\n01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:54.760\nIt's basically like,\n\n01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:56.760\nI'm going to give you guys a piece of paper.\n\n01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:00.760\nI'm going to give you a...\n\n01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:02.760\nA box.\n\n01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:04.760\nI'm going to give you a box.\n\n01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:06.760\nDepending on the category,\n\n01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:09.760\nI'm going to give you an acronym, a movie title,\n\n01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:12.760\na human name, something like that.\n\n01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:16.760\nThat thing has a sort of explanation.\n\n01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:18.760\nIf it's a movie, the movie has a synopsis.\n\n01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:21.760\nIf it's an acronym,\n\n01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:23.760\nthen the letters I'm going to give you\n\n01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:25.760\nstand for something in real life somewhere.\n\n01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:27.760\nI'm going to know the answer to that.\n\n01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.760\nYou guys are going to take two minutes.\n\n01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:32.760\nI've got a special surprise for you during that two minutes\n\n01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:38.760\nto write an attempt at a convincing answer\n\n01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:41.760\nto what that thing is.\n\n01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:43.760\nAnd then I'm going to read them all aloud,\n\n01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:46.760\nincluding the real answer.\n\n01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:49.760\nAnd...\n\n01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:50.760\nCards?\n\n01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:51.760\nYes.\n\n01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:53.760\nAnd then here's your answer card.\n\n01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:57.760\nI'll explain more in a second.\n\n01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:59.760\nSpencer, you're going to do one too, right?\n\n01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:00.760\nYeah.\n\n01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:02.760\nOkay, so players...\n\n01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:04.760\nThese are for far away.\n\n01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:06.760\nSo he's going to read the name,\n\n01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:09.760\nand then we're going to invent...\n\n01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:10.760\nYeah.\n\n01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:12.760\n...fake answers.\n\n01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:15.760\nAll right, so I'm going to...\n\n01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:18.760\nI'm going to start with a really simple example,\n\n01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:22.760\nbecause I think one of my least favorite categories\n\n01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:24.760\nwill actually make the best practice round.\n\n01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:27.760\nIt's called Laughable Laws.\n\n01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:28.760\nOkay.\n\n01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:29.760\nLaughable Laws.\n\n01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:31.760\nAll right, so I say to you guys,\n\n01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:34.760\nin Garfield County, Montana,\n\n01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:38.760\nit is illegal to draw...\n\n01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:43.760\nAnd you just have two minutes to write an answer to that.\n\n01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:48.760\nPlease remember to write your name down in the lower right,\n\n01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:52.760\nand just write your answer in the other spot.\n\n01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:54.760\nAnd then for this two minutes,\n\n01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:56.760\nAndy Dick is just going to...\n\n01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:59.760\nWe're going to have two minutes of Andy Dick while you...\n\n01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:01.760\nAndy Dick, we have a microphone for you if you need us.\n\n01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:02.760\nYes, it's over there.\n\n01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:03.760\nSorry.\n\n01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.760\nOkay, is anyone keeping time though?\n\n01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:06.760\nI forgot that part.\n\n01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:08.760\nIt's on, but talk into it together.\n\n01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:09.760\nHello?\n\n01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:10.760\nOh, okay.\n\n01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:12.760\nCan I get my new intern up to hold this?\n\n01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:15.760\nThey don't have a stand.\n\n01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:17.760\nWe must be 35 seconds into it.\n\n01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:18.760\nWell, that's okay though.\n\n01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:19.760\nThey're already writing the answer.\n\n01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:20.760\nIf they have longer, it's just...\n\n01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:22.760\nCan you come up?\n\n01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:27.760\nYou're done already?\n\n01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:29.760\nI didn't even do my thing.\n\n01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:31.760\nOkay, I'll do it on the next one.\n\n01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:34.760\nWe got two whole minutes.\n\n01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:35.760\nWhat minute are we on?\n\n01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:37.760\nWe're on like 30 seconds in.\n\n01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:39.760\nAre you doing Whippets?\n\n01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:40.760\nNo.\n\n01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:41.760\nI wish.\n\n01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:42.760\nMe too.\n\n01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:44.760\nMaybe if you blow in this...\n\n01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:46.760\nDo we have some Andy Dick music?\n\n01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:47.760\nJust...\n\n01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:49.760\nDo the D&D music.\n\n01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:54.760\nWhy don't you hold on to him?\n\n01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:56.760\nNo, I'm sorry, I'm not talking to you, Andy.\n\n01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:57.760\nSorry, we're...\n\n01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.760\nI thought you were saying hold on to him.\n\n01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:00.760\nJust hold on to me.\n\n01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:01.760\nBecause I'm going to write...\n\n01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:03.760\nYou keep going.\n\n01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.760\nNo!\n\n01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:09.760\nThank you, Zach.\n\n01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:15.760\nOh, for the podcast, Andy's blowing up a glove.\n\n01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:16.760\nI couldn't find the Michael Williams.\n\n01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:17.760\nThat's right.\n\n01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:18.760\nOkay, Andy is blowing up a glove.\n\n01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:19.760\nYeah, thank you, Spencer.\n\n01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:21.760\nNo, I mean, that about covers it.\n\n01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:22.760\nYou guys done?\n\n01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:23.760\nNo.\n\n01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:24.760\nKeep going.\n\n01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:26.760\nWe got about a minute.\n\n01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:29.760\nOkay, you can hand me your card.\n\n01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:32.760\nI think I haven't made this work yet.\n\n01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:40.760\nYou didn't put your name.\n\n01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:41.760\nYou gotta...\n\n01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:43.760\nOh, okay.\n\n01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.760\nSomebody else is making that.\n\n01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:51.760\nWe have a live ADR team here that is amazing.\n\n01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:53.760\nI don't know which one is yours.\n\n01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:55.760\nWe could do it after, right?\n\n01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:56.760\nNo, I...\n\n01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:58.760\nOh, I got...\n\n01:25:58.760 --> 01:25:59.760\nYeah,

01:26:03.760\nOkay.\n\n01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:06.760\nIt was me doing it, wasn't it?\n\n01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:07.760\nI don't think...\n\n01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:10.760\nIt sounded like it was coming from over there, didn't it?\n\n01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:12.760\nDude, let me look at your answer.\n\n01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:15.760\nOkay, all right.\n\n01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:18.760\nThis is going pretty good, I think.\n\n01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:19.760\nAll right.\n\n01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:21.760\nNo, with me.\n\n01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:23.760\nOkay, that's the two-minute.\n\n01:26:23.760 -->

gloves are harder.\n\n01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:39.760\nLet's strike that.\n\n01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:40.760\nCan we strike that?\n\n01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:41.760\nCan we strike that?\n\n01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:42.760\nAll right.\n\n01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:43.760\nLet's strike that.\n\n01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:44.760\nCan you point it right into the monitor?\n\n01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:45.760\nThe longest strike ever.\n\n01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:46.760\nThat was...\n\n01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:47.760\nStill on camera.\n\n01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:48.760\nHuman timer, Andy Dick.\n\n01:26:48.760 -->

01:26:55.760\nI'm worried about...\n\n01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:57.760\nI had so much trouble with that,\n\n01:26:57.760 --> 01:26:58.760\nand I'm like the Balderdash expert.\n\n01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.760\nI'm worried about sicking that on other people.\n\n01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:01.760\nRight.\n\n01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:03.760\nI think maybe I should just be the permanent Balderdash dealer.\n\n01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:05.760\nYeah, I was kind of thinking about just having one dealer\n\n01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:06.760\nwhen we were...\n\n01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:07.760\nYeah.\n\n01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:08.760\nI'm pretty sure we all learned that tonight\n\n01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:10.760\nno one can get an F.\n\n01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:11.760\nRight.\n\n01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:12.760\nAll right.\n\n01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:16.760\nSo, now, you at home, and you guys,\n\n01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:21.760\nit's your job to try to guess which one is the real one.\n\n01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:25.760\nAnd then each person that guesses the real one, if any,\n\n01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:28.760\nthose people get a certain number of points.\n\n01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:30.760\nIt's either one or two.\n\n01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:31.760\nI think it's one.\n\n01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:32.760\nAll right.\n\n01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:37.760\nAnybody whose answer accrues guesses.\n\n01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:39.760\nI think that guy gets two points.\n\n01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:41.760\nSee, this is means testing in action.\n\n01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:45.760\nI got the points here.\n\n01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:46.760\nIs it one...\n\n01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:47.760\nIf you get a vote,\n\n01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:49.760\nif you get your answer voted for, you get a point.\n\n01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:50.760\nOkay.\n\n01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:51.760\nYou get the right...\n\n01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:52.760\nIf you guess the right answer, you get two points.\n\n01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:53.760\nOkay, you get two points.\n\n01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:54.760\nAnd if I...\n\n01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:57.760\nI get three points if none of you guessed the real one.\n\n01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:58.760\nJust as a...\n\n01:27:58.760 --> 01:27:59.760\nRight.\n\n01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:00.760\nAnd if someone accidentally gets a right...\n\n01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:01.760\nIt keeps me honest.\n\n01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:02.760\nOkay.\n\n01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:03.760\nYou also get three points.\n\n01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:04.760\nAll right.\n\n01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:12.760\nSo, in Garfield County, Montana, it is illegal to draw...\n\n01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:13.760\nShuffling these up.\n\n01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:14.760\nI wrote the real answer on one of these pieces of paper\n\n01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:15.760\nso you're not getting any clues.\n\n01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:17.760\nAre we allowed to use Google?\n\n01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:18.760\nNo.\n\n01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:19.760\nOkay.\n\n01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:21.760\nIt's not called Balder Cheat.\n\n01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:25.760\nWell, it wouldn't be cheating if you were allowed to use it.\n\n01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:31.760\nIn Garfield County, Montana, it is illegal to draw funny faces on the outside of your\n\n01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:32.760\nwindow shades.\n\n01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:33.760\nInteresting.\n\n01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:37.760\nIs this in Montana?\n\n01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:38.760\nYep.\n\n01:28:38.760 -->

to tip your hat if you didn't answer.\n\n01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:06.760\nTo those listening.\n\n01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:07.760\nI mean, you can.\n\n01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:08.760\nIt's fun.\n\n01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:09.760\nHe is nodding.\n\n01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:10.760\nYeah, that didn't work out.\n\n01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:11.760\nI wasn't going to vote for that one.\n\n01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:13.760\nI didn't know how this was going to pay off.\n\n01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:14.760\nNo, it's cool.\n\n01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:17.760\nYou made the right

an overpass.\n\n01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:40.760\nA man enjoying himself to the Isley Brothers Live album moments after his divorce.\n\n01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:44.760\nIs final Sharon.\n\n01:29:44.760 -->

01:29:56.760\nAll right.\n\n01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:57.760\nWhose guesses are hooms?\n\n01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:59.760\nWait, aren't we supposed to guess?\n\n01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:00.760\nYes.\n\n01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:02.760\nThat's why I said whose guesses are hooms.\n\n01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:03.760\nThe funny faces is my guess.\n\n01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:05.760\nFunny faces is your guess.\n\n01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:06.760\nSo let's see.\n\n01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:11.760\nI'll put a little S there and then Ben, what's your guess?\n\n01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:13.760\nI'm going to go with you overpass.\n\n01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.760\nOverpass phallus.\n\n01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:19.760\nSo I'll put a B in there and then Josh.\n\n01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:21.760\nI'm going to go funny faces.\n\n01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:22.760\nIt's Montana.\n\n01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:23.760\nIt's weird.\n\n01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:24.760\nFunny faces.\n\n01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:25.760\nOkay.\n\n01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:28.760\nSo in the game of Balderdash, what would happen here?\n\n01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:29.760\nWait.\n\n01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:30.760\nOh, wait.\n\n01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:31.760\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:32.760\nBrandon, wait.\n\n01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:33.760\nYou don't have to ask me.\n\n01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:36.760\nNo, what's your guess?\n\n01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:38.760\nJosh, you're picking funny faces, right?\n\n01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:39.760\nYes.\n\n01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:40.760\nOkay.\n\n01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:42.760\nWhat do you think the real answer is?\n\n01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:43.760\nWhat do you think is the real one?\n\n01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:45.760\nI was going to say penises.\n\n01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:46.760\nOn the overpass.\n\n01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:47.760\nTypical.\n\n01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:48.760\nOkay.\n\n01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:50.760\nSo that's, okay.\n\n01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:54.760\nSo I don't get any points because some of you guessed the real one.\n\n01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:57.760\nThe real one is funny faces on the outside.\n\n01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:00.760\nSpencer, therefore, gets a point.\n\n01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:01.760\nIs that correct?\n\n01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:03.760\nThat's for getting the right answer.\n\n01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:06.760\nAnd I get two points because two people voted for my answer.\n\n01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:09.760\nNo, you get one point for guessing the right answer.\n\n01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:12.760\nNo, I get two points who guessed the real answer.\n\n01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:17.760\nTwo points to players who guessed the real answer.\n\n01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:19.760\nI'm learning that right off the thing.\n\n01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:22.760\nSo you only get a point for everyone who guesses yours.\n\n01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:23.760\nSo two people guessed yours.\n\n01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:24.760\nRight.\n\n01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:25.760\nSo you're getting a total of three points.\n\n01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:28.760\nBecause I did the fallacies on the overpass.\n\n01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:31.760\nOh.\n\n01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:34.760\nOh.\n\n01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:35.760\nSpencer just left.\n\n01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:36.760\nIt's it.\n\n01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:37.760\nRan off stage.\n\n01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:38.760\nHe's lost his mind.\n\n01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:39.760\nHe's back on stage.\n\n01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:40.760\nRolled on stage.\n\n01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:42.760\nFire rolled on stage.\n\n01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:43.760\nAnd he's back to the chair.\n\n01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:45.760\nWhich did not roll away.\n\n01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:46.760\nHe stuck the land.\n\n01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:47.760\nI hope I went now.\n\n01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:51.760\nSo that's, that's a, that's a total of, yeah, I can't remember.\n\n01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:52.760\nFour points.\n\n01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:53.760\nOkay.\n\n01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:55.760\nDid anyone else win points?\n\n01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:56.760\nYes.\n\n01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:58.760\nOther people won some points because.\n\n01:31:58.760 --> 01:31:59.760\nYeah.\n\n01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:01.760\nYou got two points for getting the right answer.\n\n01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:02.760\nRight.\n\n01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:03.760\nGod damn it.\n\n01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:04.760\nIt's too hard.\n\n01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:05.760\nPoints are fun.\n\n01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:08.760\nI mean, we could just do the rounds without keeping score.\n\n01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:10.760\nWell, yeah, but what's, yeah, it's not fun.\n\n01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:11.760\nRight.\n\n01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:12.760\nI mean, it's.\n\n01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:13.760\nWell, it's funer than this.\n\n01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:14.760\nRelative.\n\n01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:18.760\nWe could eat bowls of shit and be further.\n\n01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:19.760\nAnd that's not, wait a minute.\n\n01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:22.760\nI'm a, I'm a fun stickler.\n\n01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:25.760\nWait, wake up.\n\n01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:28.760\nI don't know how Doug Benson does it on his show.\n\n01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:29.760\nYeah.\n\n01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:32.760\nI guess I was just thinking like if we did like, if we did enough rounds, but then I\n\n01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:35.760\nwas, but it's just like, I wouldn't wish this job on anyone.\n\n01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:37.760\nLike this is awful.\n\n01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:38.760\nIt's, it's really hard to do.\n\n01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:39.760\nYeah.\n\n01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:41.760\nThis job is boulder dash.\n\n01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:43.760\nOh, that's why it's the dasher.\n\n01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:44.760\nI just got that.\n\n01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:45.760\nAll right.\n\n01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:48.760\nSo someone, Spencer won and somebody else got points.\n\n01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:51.760\nSo the, I should have ran around.\n\n01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:53.760\nWe could do another round.\n\n01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:56.760\nI mean, you don't seem to want to.\n\n01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:57.760\nSo that's fine.\n\n01:32:57.760 --> 01:32:59.760\nI'm just worried about, I have, I have two hats on.\n\n01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:03.760\nDo you want one is a terrible Balderdash dealer and then the other is a terrible podcast\n\n01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:04.760\nhost.\n\n01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:05.760\nYeah.\n\n01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:06.760\nYeah.\n\n01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:12.760\nI feel like I'm making my, the two of them are, are losing to each other.\n\n01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:15.760\nAnd yeah, and we're all losing to Doug Benson.\n\n01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:20.760\nIt feels like choosing a holiday game that ends in arguments might not have been the\n\n01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:22.760\nbest, but talking about politics was going so well.\n\n01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:29.760\nCan we, can we give you, we stall just a little bit and maybe ask them where we're going in\n\n01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:30.760\nterms of education.\n\n01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:36.760\nYou mean while Andy Dick does two minutes or while you, while you get your cards together\n\n01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:41.760\nbecause we, we don't know what that, what's the uptick on the way of getting out of this\n\n01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:42.760\nconversation that we had with you earlier.\n\n01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:45.760\nThat's sort of like, what should we expect?\n\n01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:46.760\nYeah.\n\n01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:53.760\nThat ain't, that ain't nearly as good, Andy Dick.\n\n01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:54.760\nIs there a camera?\n\n01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:55.760\nI thought I heard my name.\n\n01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:56.760\nNo, you did.\n\n01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:57.760\nI'm late.\n\n01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:58.760\nI mean early.\n\n01:33:58.760 --> 01:33:59.760\nAm I early or late?\n\n01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:00.760\nYou're just a little early.\n\n01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:01.760\nYou're just a little early.\n\n01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:02.760\nBut you have all the instruments.\n\n01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:03.760\nYou did have the right instruments.\n\n01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:06.760\nI could have sworn we said two hangers, Andy Dick.\n\n01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:07.760\nOne hanger.\n\n01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:09.760\nAndy Dick is who we're working with right now.\n\n01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:10.760\nGeez.\n\n01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:11.760\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:16.760\nTwo hangers, Andy Dick, one hanger, Andy Dick is who we're working with right now.\n\n01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:17.760\nJesus.\n\n01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:18.760\nOkay.\n\n01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:19.760\nYeah.\n\n01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:20.760\nTell us, tell us, tell us.\n\n01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:21.760\nGive us a little future.\n\n01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:23.760\nSo, so, you know, so do you have an example?\n\n01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:26.760\nSo whenever it's now on our third class of undergrads.\n\n01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:28.760\nSo it started this past September.\n\n01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:31.760\nAnd where, where are the first one and two classes?\n\n01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:32.760\nThis semester they're in Seoul.\n\n01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:34.760\nNext semester they're going to Hyderabad.\n\n01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:35.760\nAwesome.\n\n01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:42.760\nAnd for this third class, we received more applications, third class ever than Dartmouth\n\n01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:43.760\nor MIT did.\n\n01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:45.760\nSo give me, what's the ballpark on that?\n\n01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:48.760\n20,400 applications from 179 countries.\n\n01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:50.760\nAnd how many people are you going to take?\n\n01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:57.760\nWe took last year just under 2%, which actually shows that you can be the most selective university\n\n01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:02.760\nin the country and the most economically diverse without trying.\n\n01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:03.760\nIt's not, that wasn't the goal.\n\n01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:05.760\nIt was just we stopped discriminating.\n\n01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:06.760\nDo you have scholarships?\n\n01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:07.760\nYeah.\n\n01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:09.760\n80% of our students are in some form financially.\n\n01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:10.760\nThat's pretty amazing.\n\n01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:11.760\nYeah.\n\n01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:12.760\nIt's pretty amazing.\n\n01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:13.760\nSo what do you hope?\n\n01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:15.760\nWhat is your biggest dream with all of this?\n\n01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:17.760\nWould you, would you want a brick and mortar one day?\n\n01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:18.760\nNo, no.\n\n01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:23.760\nMy, my, my biggest dream is that other universities are forced to follow.\n\n01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:28.760\nBecause what we've, we've shown third party assessed our students and showed that what\n\n01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:33.760\nour students have been able to accomplish in eight months, no university has been able\n\n01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:36.760\nto demonstrate that they can get their students to accomplish in four years.\n\n01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:40.760\nAnd that's on critical thinking, problem solving, reasoning, and communication skills.\n\n01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:43.760\nDo you have any sort of endowment program?\n\n01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:50.760\nWe, we have endowment, but it, it will take a long time to realize.\n\n01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:55.760\nSo right now we're doing a lot of fundraising to enable all those scholarships.\n\n01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:58.760\nAnd it's, it's hard work.\n\n01:35:58.760 --> 01:35:59.760\nYeah.\n\n01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:00.760\nThanks for doing that.\n\n01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:01.760\nHard work.\n\n01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:02.760\nWell, that sounds like...\n\n01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:03.760\nAndy Dick.\n\n01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:04.760\nWhere are you?\n\n01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:05.760\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:06.760\nWait, hold on to Andy Dick.\n\n01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:07.760\nHold on to Andy.\n\n01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:08.760\nHold on to Andy Dick.\n\n01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:09.760\nHold your Andy Dick.\n\n01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:11.760\nStroke it, but hold it.\n\n01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:12.760\nLove it.\n\n01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:13.760\nIt's our fault.\n\n01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:18.760\nIt sounds a lot to me like the narrative is subjective as it is in the category of\n\n01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:25.760\nMarvelous Movies in Balderdash.\n\n01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:29.760\nSo I'd like you to each take, take one of these empty Balderdash cards.\n\n01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:37.760\nAnd I'd like you to try to convince each other what the plot synopsis would be for a\n\n01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:44.760\nMarvelous movie entitled San Diego I Love You.\n\n01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:48.760\nTwo minutes of Andy Dick will happen during your writing.\n\n01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:49.760\nYeah.\n\n01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:56.760\nYeah, I saw this in Germany once.\n\n01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:02.760\nIt was amazing.\n\n01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:04.760\nYeah.\n\n01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:07.760\nOh, don't hurt yourself.\n\n01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:13.760\nWell, we'll get, we'll get, we'll get somebody to help you next time.\n\n01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:20.760\nWhen does the time start?\n\n01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:21.760\nIt starts now.\n\n01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:22.760\nIt started, yeah.\n\n01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:23.760\nTell me when we're at 30.\n\n01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:24.760\nYou got it.\n\n01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:26.760\nThen tell me when we're at, you know, 130.\n\n01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:27.760\nI got it.\n\n01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:28.760\nWell, okay.\n\n01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:29.760\nWe're at 30.\n\n01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:30.760\nNo, I'll do that.\n\n01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:31.760\nHe needs to write an answer.\n\n01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:32.760\nOkay.\n\n01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:33.760\nWe're at 30.\n\n01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:34.760\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:42.760\nTwo hanger, two hanger, two hanger, Andy Dick in the house.\n\n01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:47.760\nTwo hanger, two hanger, two hanger, Andy Dick in the house.\n\n01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:55.760\nBrandon, write your answer.\n\n01:37:55.760 --> 01:38:09.760\nThis should be about the bridge, like the midpoint.\n\n01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:12.760\nYeah.\n\n01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:14.760\nWell, don't, he's writing.\n\n01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:23.760\nDon't get, he's, he's in the competition and you're looking at him and banging a thing.\n\n01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:27.760\nLook at, I'll, I can talk to you about it.\n\n01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:29.760\nThey're, they're all writing.\n\n01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:30.760\nYeah.\n\n01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:32.760\nI'll, I'll ask, I'll interview you.\n\n01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:35.760\nNow, Andy, I don't want to get you in legal trouble, but this is stomp based.\n\n01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:45.760\nMaybe this is stomp based.\n\n01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:46.760\nIs that a setup?\n\n01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:48.760\nAm I supposed to?\n\n01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:53.760\nWell, how did they, how did they know?\n\n01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:55.760\nOh, sponsor banks.\n\n01:38:55.760

gentlemen, Andy Dick.\n\n01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:06.760\nAndy Dick.\n\n01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:07.760\nThis is not his first time.\n\n01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:08.760\nAndy Dick.\n\n01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:09.760\nDon't take those.\n\n01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:11.760\nWe could, we could do that.\n\n01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:14.760\nYou got your, do I have everybody's card over here?\n\n01:39:14.760 -->

01:39:43.760\nGod bless.\n\n01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:44.760\nAll right.\n\n01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:45.760\nThat's okay.\n\n01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:46.760\nOh boy.\n\n01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:47.760\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:49.760\nNo, no, I didn't, that wasn't it.\n\n01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:54.760\nI know how that sounded here again, but it was just like, yeah, this is.\n\n01:39:54.760

D.\n\n01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:01.760\nYou're safe.\n\n01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:02.760\nNo, this isn't what I'm saying.\n\n01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:10.260\nThis is all, it's just like, I, this has been a, I mean, gauntlet is negative, but smorgasbord\n\n01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:11.260\nto be sure.\n\n01:40:11.260 --> 01:40:16.760\nJust keep on your toes, you know, if D&T ever, ever falls before this level

you got to go.\n\n01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:20.360\nWell, it sounds like you said he had the right answer, but I was going to guess the last answer,\n\n01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:25.360\nthe fifth one, whatever the musical.\n\n01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:32.360\nAre you just, you're not trying to give it to me, are you?\n\n01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:35.360\nNo, it sounded like he was about to say that you had the right answer.\n\n01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:38.360\nAnd I didn't want to then use that knowledge to cheat.\n\n01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:40.360\nAll right, so Spencer guessed Ben's.\n\n01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:41.360\nDamn it.\n\n01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:43.360\nWhich means Ben gets a point.\n\n01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:44.360\nYeah.\n\n01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:45.360\nAll right.\n\n01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:49.360\nBrandon guessed the right one, which means Brandon gets two points.\n\n01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:50.360\nRight.\n\n01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:55.360\nSan Diego, I love you was in fact a daughter tries to keep her family together with promoting\n\n01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:57.360\nfather's inventions.\n\n01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:59.360\nWhat were his inventions?\n\n01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:00.360\nDrones.\n\n01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:01.360\nDrones.\n\n01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:02.360\nGreat.\n\n01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:03.360\nThat sounded like Jurassic.\n\n01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:04.360\nWeaponized.\n\n01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:05.360\nWeaponized drones.\n\n01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:13.360\nAnd then both once again drawn in by Spencer's perverse ability to emulate a board game.\n\n01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:14.360\nWow.\n\n01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:15.360\nI mean, that really does.\n\n01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:17.360\nWhen you, when you look at it, it makes a lot of sense.\n\n01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:19.360\nHe's like a Balderdash ringer.\n\n01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:20.360\nPart person.\n\n01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:21.360\nPart dash.\n\n01:45:21.360 -->

--> 01:45:29.360\nI think I'm at six to maybe someone as two.\n\n01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:30.360\nI think you have two.\n\n01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:31.360\nI got two from the first round.\n\n01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:32.360\nOne.\n\n01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:34.360\nYeah, you got one this round.\n\n01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:36.360\nThis last one for a thousand points.\n\n01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:38.360\nSounds great.\n\n01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:40.360\nAll right.\n\n01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:45.360\nNow, Andy, I want you on deck, but you're not going yet.\n\n01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:47.360\nWe're going to get better at this.\n\n01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:51.360\nBut this third round, we're going to show you how this fucking, this is going to go good.\n\n01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:53.360\nIt's been going good.\n\n01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:56.360\nYeah, we are.\n\n01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:58.360\nThey're bringing CISO back just for this.\n\n01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:00.360\nOh, great.\n\n01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:03.360\nBrought to you by Balderdash and CISO.\n\n01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:08.360\nWe spent too much money on you guys.\n\n01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:09.360\nCISO.\n\n01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:12.360\nYou saw it coming.\n\n01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:13.360\nCISO.\n\n01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:14.360\nNothing left to see.\n\n01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:20.360\nSo check out Hulu.\n\n01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:25.360\nI guess I'll do a category of peculiar people.\n\n01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:27.360\nSo this is just a name.\n\n01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:28.360\nHere, pass these blank ones down.\n\n01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:29.360\nSo it's like a historical figure.\n\n01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:30.360\nBenito.\n\n01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:32.360\nIt's not necessarily true.\n\n01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:34.360\nIt's just a name.\n\n01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:40.360\nSo you just have to, here, I'll pick an example one so that we can get the tone.\n\n01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:45.360\nLike, peculiar people example would be, oh, Shay Jackson.\n\n01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:50.360\nAnd then the answer is the real name of Raptor, actor Ice Cube.\n\n01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:53.360\nWell, geez, well, that was a bad thing for them to include.\n\n01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:56.360\nWhat happens when somebody writes the real answer?\n\n01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:58.360\nIf you get the, if you know the real one.\n\n01:46:58.360 --> 01:46:59.360\nYou get some points.\n\n01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:00.360\nYou might get three points.\n\n01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:01.360\nYeah.\n\n01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:02.360\nSo you would get 1,000.\n\n01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:05.360\nSo you would get, well, we're not, I was kidding.\n\n01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:07.360\nI don't want to fuck that up.\n\n01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:08.360\nSo Christmas is ruined.\n\n01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:09.360\nExcellent.\n\n01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:10.360\nOh, right.\n\n01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:11.360\nThat means I'm almost certainly going to win.\n\n01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:12.360\nYeah.\n\n01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:14.360\nI need those points to feed my family, Dan.\n\n01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:15.360\nYeah.\n\n01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:16.360\nWe could do double points maybe.\n\n01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:22.360\nOr we could say you have to win by 10 and just keep playing until that we could do.\n\n01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:23.360\nAll right.\n\n01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:24.360\nThis is a name.\n\n01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:33.360\nThe name is Jeremy Bentham, B-E-N-T-H-A-M.\n\n01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:34.360\nAnd what are we supposed to do?\n\n01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:38.360\nYou're supposed to just say who that person is.\n\n01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:39.360\nOkay.\n\n01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:40.360\nLike why they're notable.\n\n01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:41.360\nYes.\n\n01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:42.360\nWhat their deal is.\n\n01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:43.360\nOkay.\n\n01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:44.360\nThey might be the inventor of peanut butter.\n\n01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:45.360\nThey're right.\n\n01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:48.360\nAnd I give you two minutes of Andy Dick.\n\n01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:49.360\nOh.\n\n01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:57.360\nOkay.\n\n01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:02.360\nIf you love Christmas Nativity at the Crystal Cathedral, you'll love this next act.\n\n01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:11.360\nAndy Dick at Harmontown.\n\n01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:12.360\nOkay.\n\n01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:13.360\nTwo hangers.\n\n01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:14.360\nA mallet.\n\n01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:18.360\nIt looks like a one by six.\n\n01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:23.360\nWe're at about 20 seconds in.\n\n01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:26.360\nAndy has a one by four.\n\n01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:27.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:29.360\nIt's a long, thin piece of lumber.\n\n01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:31.360\nIt looks like a one by six.\n\n01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:33.360\nIt's better if I'm on deck.\n\n01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:34.360\nRight.\n\n01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:35.360\nYeah.\n\n01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:43.360\nWe're at 35.\n\n01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:48.360\nWhoa.\n\n01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:53.360\nThis isn't just stump.\n\n01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:56.360\nIt's my off Broadway show called Knock.\n\n01:48:56.360 --> 01:48:57.360\nKnock.\n\n01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:59.360\nIt's Andy's off Broadway show called Knock.\n\n01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:01.360\nI forgot to write my name again.\n\n01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:03.360\nPut it on Broadway if you're doing it.\n\n01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:07.360\nOh goodness.\n\n01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:12.360\nPlease don't.\n\n01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:14.360\nFor everybody listening with headphones.\n\n01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:16.360\nGod bless you.\n\n01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:18.360\n14 people just died in car.\n\n01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:20.360\nCorrect.\n\n01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:23.360\nWe're at one minute and 30 seconds.\n\n01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:25.360\nSo we have 30 more seconds.\n\n01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:26.360\nRight.\n\n01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:27.360\nYeah.\n\n01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:28.360\n30 more seconds.\n\n01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:29.360\n30 more seconds.\n\n01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:35.360\nSo if you could just do the two verses, first two verses.\n\n01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:37.360\nOh, a remix.\n\n01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:45.360\nOkay.\n\n01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:46.360\nIt's been.\n\n01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:47.360\nBen didn't put his name.\n\n01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:48.360\nOkay.\n\n01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:49.360\nI did.\n\n01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:50.360\nOh, you did.\n\n01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:51.360\nWait.\n\n01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:52.360\nI didn't.\n\n01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:53.360\nJosh didn't.\n\n01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:54.360\nNo, I didn't.\n\n01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:55.360\nI keep forgetting.\n\n01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:56.360\nI'm watching.\n\n01:49:56.360 --> 01:49:57.360\nYou know, I'm watching Lion King.\n\n01:49:57.360 --> 01:49:58.360\nYeah.\n\n01:49:58.360 --> 01:49:59.360\nNo, you're wearing a lot of hats.\n\n01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:00.360\nOkay.\n\n01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:01.360\nThank you.\n\n01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:03.360\nThat was two minutes of Andy Dick.\n\n01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:05.360\nTwo minutes of Andy Dick.\n\n01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:06.360\nThe show.\n\n01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:07.360\nYeah.\n\n01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:10.360\nWe could get that.\n\n01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:12.360\nDid you want to do something on the back of the album?\n\n01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:13.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:17.360\nWell, I don't think there will be.\n\n01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:20.360\nYeah, just for the people that are listening.\n\n01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:22.360\nWhy don't you just tell them something, Andy Dickish?\n\n01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:24.360\nBecause anyone can bang on a board.\n\n01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:31.360\nTell everybody about being unexpectedly bisexual\n\n01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:36.360\nand some point in your life or...\n\n01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:37.360\nFine, fine, fine.\n\n01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:42.360\nI think my last instrument that you never did.\n\n01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:44.360\nWell, you could just tell us how you're doing.\n\n01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:46.360\nHow are you?\n\n01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:50.360\nWell, that was certainly an action.\n\n01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:51.360\nSo...\n\n01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:52.360\nHe's angry.\n\n01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:53.360\nHe's angry at me.\n\n01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:55.360\nThere's nothing better than...\n\n01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:59.360\nA scruffy figure tossed to traffic going on to the stage.\n\n01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:04.360\nDuh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.\n\n01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:05.360\nHey.\n\n01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:10.360\nDuh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.\n\n01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:11.360\nHey.\n\n01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:13.360\nHow are you?\n\n01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:16.360\nLike, so let people know how you are.\n\n01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:18.360\nListeners are my podcast.\n\n01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:19.360\nRight.\n\n01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:22.360\nYou wanted me to stay on for the blind listeners?\n\n01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:25.360\nWhat are you doing for the holiday season, Andy Dick?\n\n01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:26.360\nAnything?\n\n01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:27.360\nAny kids that are all here right now.\n\n01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:30.360\nBecause you just, you told a great dream tale about the Christmas.\n\n01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:32.360\nThat one on VICE.\n\n01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:34.360\nThis year you've got to have something different planned.\n\n01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:36.360\nOr are you going to revisit that shit?\n\n01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:37.360\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:38.360\nSomething else?\n\n01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:39.360\nNo.\n\n01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:42.360\nWell, it's probably going to be, you know, the Yule Tide log.\n\n01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:43.360\nSomething low-key.\n\n01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:44.360\nYeah, very low-key.\n\n01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:45.360\nYou're invited.\n\n01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:46.360\nThank you so much.\n\n01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:49.360\nI'm always invited to your stuff.\n\n01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:51.360\nAnd it's like I come 50-50.\n\n01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:52.360\nRight?\n\n01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:54.360\nDo you do Dino's Christmas?\n\n01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:55.360\nIt's 50-50.\n\n01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:56.360\nYeah.\n\n01:51:56.360 --> 01:52:00.360\nI usually go out of town, but I'm staying in town.\n\n01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:02.360\nAndy's always invited.\n\n01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:04.360\nHe's had a standing invite.\n\n01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:06.360\nHe just doesn't know where you're going.\n\n01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:07.360\nYou heard him.\n\n01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:08.360\nYou heard him.\n\n01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:12.360\nYou went to Santa Barbara last week and you were caught in the fires.\n\n01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:13.360\nYeah.\n\n01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:14.360\nHave you talked about that?\n\n01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:15.360\nNo, I didn't think.\n\n01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:17.360\nHe was caught, I'm going to talk about it.\n\n01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:21.360\nHe was caught in the fires, like trapped.\n\n01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:22.360\nTell him.\n\n01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:25.360\nDon't forget, Dan, tell us about the Paul McCartney song when you get a chance.\n\n01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:26.360\nOh, shit.\n\n01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:29.360\nNo, we'll talk about that next week.\n\n01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:31.360\nNext week will be our Christmas episode.\n\n01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:33.360\nWe'll talk about the Paul McCartney Christmas song.\n\n01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:34.360\nExcellent.\n\n01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:35.360\nWhich one?\n\n01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:37.360\nWhich is a very polarizing song.\n\n01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:39.360\nThat piece of shit, horrible.\n\n01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:41.360\nYou don't like the McCartney?\n\n01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:43.360\nIt's the worst fucking Christmas song.\n\n01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:44.360\nWhy have you met him?\n\n01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:47.360\nI don't hate Paul McCartney, I hate his Christmas song.\n\n01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:49.360\nOkay, that's probably shitty.\n\n01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:50.360\nAnd he hates a...\n\n01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:51.360\nCorrect.\n\n01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:57.360\nGenerous word because that song doesn't deserve my activation.\n\n01:52:57.360 --> 01:52:58.360\nAnyways.\n\n01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:04.360\nAnybody who starts a sentence with the word simply can fuck off.\n\n01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:09.360\nOh, do they know it's Christmas after all is kind of the shittiest one for me.\n\n01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:10.360\nIs that the one?\n\n01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:11.360\nYeah.\n\n01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:13.360\nThe snow is white.\n\n01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:14.360\nThe lights are on.\n\n01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:16.360\nThe gifts are out.\n\n01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:17.360\nThat's enough.\n\n01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:18.360\nFuck it.\n\n01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:19.360\nSimply half.\n\n01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:22.360\nIt's like the laziest fucking Christmas song.\n\n01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:24.360\nThe Santa's here.\n\n01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:26.360\nThe deer can fly.\n\n01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:28.360\nThe fucking snow is falling.\n\n01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:30.360\nWhat else do you want?\n\n01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:32.360\nI'm a beetle.\n\n01:53:32.360 --> 01:53:35.360\nI think you can feel his fucking muscles atrophy.\n\n01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:40.360\nAnd then for it to be in every jukebox and for everyone to fall for that.\n\n01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:44.360\nWe need better education, better critical thinking skills.\n\n01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:47.360\nWe need kids to be out there going, I'm not going to play this on the jukebox.\n\n01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:48.360\nThis is ridiculous.\n\n01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:50.360\nIt has four notes.\n\n01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:55.360\nDarling love.\n\n01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:59.360\nLet's wrap this up with the results of this last round of all.\n\n01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:00.360\nAll right.\n\n01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:01.360\nWell, thank you.\n\n01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:02.360\nAndy Dick.\n\n01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:05.360\nGo to Andy's Periscope if you want to give me money.\n\n01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:07.360\nPeriscope has changed.\n\n01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:08.360\nI'm gray listed.\n\n01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:09.360\nDid we get into that?\n\n01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:11.360\nWhere do I put this microphone?\n\n01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:12.360\nYeah.\n\n01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:13.360\nOr you can.\n\n01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:15.360\nI can't work again for three months.\n\n01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:17.360\nThat's what gray means.\n\n01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:18.360\nNo, that's his estimate.\n\n01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:21.360\nAndy's using the phrase gray listed to refer to him.\n\n01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:22.360\nI would.\n\n01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:25.360\nUsing an algorithm that I came up with in my face.\n\n01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:27.360\nIt's like he has a base.\n\n01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:28.360\nI need a base.\n\n01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:31.360\nThere's a lot of people that are rooting for Andy.\n\n01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:32.360\nAndy's yeah.\n\n01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:33.360\nAndy says gray listed.\n\n01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:36.360\nI think what he means not to put words in his mouth, but I am.\n\n01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:37.360\nEverybody loves Andy.\n\n01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:41.360\nBut yeah, he can't get work because it's like, like, so he's not blacklisted\n\n01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:44.360\nbecause it's not like, oh, you're, there's some reason.\n\n01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:47.360\nThat you're, you're, you're banned.\n\n01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:50.360\nIt's like, oh, there's no, there's no denial of it or whatever.\n\n01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:54.360\nIt's like, we'll keep track of Andy and his, and his travails.\n\n01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:58.360\nHe's, he was, he was, he was a periscoping from here.\n\n01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:00.360\nAnd now Periscope has some tip feature.\n\n01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:04.360\nI believe Andy is 100% subsisting on Periscope right now.\n\n01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:05.360\nWow.\n\n01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:06.360\nPlease give.\n\n01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:08.360\nIt's a, it's a new business model.\n\n01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:10.360\nYou don't have to wait for Periscope.\n\n01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:12.360\nYou can, you can give anyway.\n\n01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:15.360\nWe're going to be doing an Andy Dick telephone later on.\n\n01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:16.360\nAll right.\n\n01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:17.360\nOperators are standing by.\n\n01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:18.360\nYeah.\n\n01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:19.360\nI like that.\n\n01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:20.360\nI do like that.\n\n01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:24.360\nLike what, what the post Weinstein, like the sex scandal, all this stuff.\n\n01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:28.360\nAnd I was like, no, Andy's going to survive this fine because he's a human\n\n01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:31.360\nhurricane because like the one headline about Andy Dick that,\n\n01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:36.360\nthat came out during that whole purge was like the headline was so\n\n01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:37.360\ncomplicated.\n\n01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:38.360\nIt tripped over itself.\n\n01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:44.360\nLike Andy Dick confesses to sexual assault, asks the cameraman if he's\n\n01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:49.360\nmarried falls down, eats a trash bag and like, like ends up marrying somebody.\n\n01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:52.360\nIt was like the headline is like, like, leave this guy alone.\n\n01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:53.360\nYeah.\n\n01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:56.360\nLike he's not, you're not knocking anyone down a peg if you're, if you're\n\n01:55:56.360 --> 01:55:57.360\ngoing for Andy Dick.\n\n01:55:57.360 --> 01:56:00.360\nHe's, he's, he's, he's, he's on his own journey.\n\n01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:02.360\nVery honest, very open.\n\n01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:05.360\nHe may be the one, he may be the last man standing.\n\n01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:07.360\nAll right.\n\n01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:10.360\nI hope you didn't mind me speaking about him like that while he's standing\n\n01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:11.360\noffstage.\n\n01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:12.360\nThat's nice.\n\n01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:14.360\nNo, he's, he's in the back.\n\n01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:15.360\nAll right.\n\n01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:20.360\nSo your, your, your question was who is this?\n\n01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:26.360\nWait, the name was, I didn't write it down.\n\n01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:29.360\nThe name is Jeremy Bentham.\n\n01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:36.360\nJeremy Bentham, the possibilities of Jeremy Bentham are he is assuming he\n\n01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:41.360\nis, you're welcome.\n\n01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:44.360\nHe is one of seven genders or two sexes.\n\n01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:45.360\nAll right.\n\n01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:49.360\nHe is musician, Adam Ant.\n\n01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:54.360\nA noted moral philosopher.\n\n01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:59.360\nHis preserved body is on display at a London university.\n\n01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:02.360\nThe boy who ate the most spaghetti.\n\n01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:05.360\nDammit.\n\n01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:06.360\nI think that's a good answer.\n\n01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:07.360\nThat's a good answer.\n\n01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:08.360\nI've been getting stoned on stage.\n\n01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:09.360\nI think that's a good answer.\n\n01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:10.360\nYeah.\n\n01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:11.360\nYeah.\n\n01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:14.360\nFuck that dude.\n\n01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:16.360\nThe first, I'm sorry, I'm drunk.\n\n01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:19.360\nThe first Puerto Rican shortstop for the Padres.\n\n01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:21.360\nOh, Los Yalami, Bentham.\n\n01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:22.360\nYeah.\n\n01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:23.360\nThose answers again.\n\n01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:29.360\nJeremy Bentham is either musician, Adam Ant, a noted moral philosopher.\n\n01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:33.360\nHis preserved body is on display at a London university.\n\n01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:35.360\nThe boy who ate the most spaghetti.\n\n01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:40.360\nOr the first Puerto Rican shortstop for the Padres.\n\n01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:42.360\nPuerto Rican.\n\n01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:45.360\nPuerto.\n\n01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:48.360\nPuerto Rican.\n\n01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:50.360\nWho should go first?\n\n01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:51.360\nSpencer, you guess first.\n\n01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:52.360\nSorry.\n\n01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:54.360\nIt's okay.\n\n01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:55.360\nThe first answer.\n\n01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:56.360\nThe, what was it?\n\n01:57:56.360 --> 01:57:57.360\nAdam Ant.\n\n01:57:57.360 --> 01:57:58.360\nAdam Ant, yeah.\n\n01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:01.360\nThat's a Spencer guess for Adam Ant.\n\n01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:02.360\nAll right.\n\n01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:03.360\nBen Nelson.\n\n01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:07.360\nI'm going to go with the body in the university.\n\n01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:08.360\nAll right.\n\n01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:11.360\nJosh.\n\n01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:14.360\nAlthough I want to say the boy who ate the most spaghetti.\n\n01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:16.360\nBecause it's a great answer.\n\n01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:20.360\nI'm going to have to go with Adam Ant because I'm just going to follow whatever Spencer\n\n01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:21.360\ndoes in a board game.\n\n01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:22.360\nAll right.\n\n01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:25.360\nI'm going to go with philosopher.\n\n01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:26.360\nAll right.\n\n01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:29.360\nWell, this is a complicated round.\n\n01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:35.360\nIt's notably because Josh Andraski high-fived his own answer.\n\n01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:37.360\nSomeone was going to take it.\n\n01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:39.360\nLike someone was going to guess it.\n\n01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:40.360\nHe's just trying.\n\n01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:41.360\nHe's just thought maybe he could psych Brandon out.\n\n01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:45.360\nHe's like, well, I'd love to say the boy's spaghetti.\n\n01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:47.360\nI'm on my last limb here, man.\n\n01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:49.360\nI didn't come here to make podcast friends.\n\n01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:53.360\nBy the way, it's kind of complicated because there are two right answers.\n\n01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:58.360\nOh, look at the drama.\n\n01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:02.360\nOh, because you knew.\n\n01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:03.360\nOh, of course.\n\n01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:09.360\nWell, the college master knows everything that goes out into college, including if a\n\n01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:12.360\nbody is preserved at a university in London.\n\n01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:16.360\nIf you killed a guy and put him in your university and his name happened to be Jeremy Bentham,\n\n01:59:16.360 --> 01:59:19.360\nI don't think that should count for points.\n\n01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:21.360\nWait, so Ben, was that your guess?\n\n01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:24.360\nNo, he's a noted moral philosopher as well.\n\n01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:29.360\nOh, wait, but you knew both were correct, but you decided to...\n\n01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:33.360\nI didn't know which feature of Jeremy Bentham was the answer, but I knew who he was.\n\n01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:38.360\nWell, you must have known that no one was going to just riff that his body was preserved\n\n01:59:38.360 --> 01:59:40.360\nin a, I don't know, why am I yelling at you?\n\n01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:42.360\nWe could dance at the college, dude.\n\n01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:43.360\nI didn't write that answer.\n\n01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:44.360\nThat's the fault.\n\n01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:45.360\nOf course.\n\n01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:47.360\nHe's the smartest person up here, man.\n\n01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:49.360\nHe redesigns colleges, man.\n\n01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:50.360\nI know.\n\n01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:53.360\nWell, that's why it complicates Balderdash because if we didn't have him up there,\n\n01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:56.360\nwe wouldn't know he was a noted moral philosopher,\n\n01:59:56.360 --> 02:00:02.360\nin which case Brandon and Ben both would have technically guessed right,\n\n02:00:02.360 --> 02:00:06.360\nbut because Ben's up here, we know that Ben guessed right along with Brandon.\n\n02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:07.360\nI don't know how to score this.\n\n02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:09.360\nWell, who gave the right answer?\n\n02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:10.360\nExactly.\n\n02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:11.360\nWho wrote it?\n\n02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:13.360\nYou wrote spaghetti, right?\n\n02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:14.360\nOh, oh, oh.\n\n02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:16.360\nI wrote the noted moral philosopher.\n\n02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:19.360\nSo you get three points for having wrote written that answer.\n\n02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:20.360\nHe was buried in the...\n\n02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:23.360\nAnd then you get two points for that, I think.\n\n02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:24.360\nOh, I think we're tied.\n\n02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:25.360\nRight.\n\n02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:27.360\nSo you were so familiar with Jeremy Bentham that you were like...\n\n02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:30.360\nBut he chose my answer also.\n\n02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:31.360\nOh, yeah.\n\n02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:32.360\nSo I think you win.\n\n02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:33.360\nOh, right.\n\n02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:34.360\nOkay.\n\n02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:35.360\nAnd that's how we treat guests anyway.\n\n02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:36.360\nYeah.\n\n02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:37.360\nYeah.\n\n02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:38.360\nYou know what?\n\n02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:39.360\nGive him 900 points.\n\n02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:40.360\nWell, yeah.\n\n02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:41.360\nI think he gets seven points for the game.\n\n02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:44.360\nBen Nelson has won Balderdash and America.\n\n02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:46.360\nThat's going to go on my tombstone, I'm sure.\n\n02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:48.360\nNow, Ben, your prizes, you get to tell us.\n\n02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:51.360\nYou get to spend the end of this podcast telling kids out there.\n\n02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:53.360\nAnd like, how do they...\n\n02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:54.360\nIf they want to...\n\n02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:57.360\nIf they're interested in what you've been talking about,\n\n02:00:57.360 --> 02:00:59.360\nlike, where do they go?\n\n02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:02.360\nDot com wise, geography wise.\n\n02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:05.360\nWhat do they do to get sucked into your...\n\n02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:09.360\nTo your black hole of advancement?\n\n02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:14.360\nSo if you are so inclined, you can just type Minerva into Google.\n\n02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:15.360\nIt'll come up.\n\n02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:17.360\nBut you can go to Minerva.\n\n02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:18.360\nM-I-N-E-R-V-A.\n\n02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:19.360\nM-I-N-E-R-V-A.\n\n02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:20.360\nThat's how dumb we've become.\n\n02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:21.360\nM-I-N-E-R-V-A.\n\n02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:24.360\nIs that if you type the name of this Roman goddess into Google,\n\n02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:28.360\nthe first thing that will come up is the guy who's using it for his educational program.\n\n02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:31.360\nSometimes Wikipedia will outrank us.\n\n02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:33.360\nBut we're one or two.\n\n02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:34.360\nShe's Athena.\n\n02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:36.360\nShe's the Roman version of Athena, right?\n\n02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:39.360\nShe's the Roman version of Athena and the inspiration for our Constitution.\n\n02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:41.360\nSo, and the goddess of wisdom.\n\n02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:42.360\nBut so that...\n\n02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:44.360\nYeah, just start Googling Minerva and the...\n\n02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:46.360\nOr go to MinervaProject.com.\n\n02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:49.360\nM-This is for people in particular who are like,\n\n02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:51.360\nlike, look, man, I've had it.\n\n02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:54.360\nI want to participate in this moon raker project educationally.\n\n02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:56.360\nI want to become a super, super thinker.\n\n02:01:56.360 --> 02:02:00.360\nAnd, like, I don't trust the current system.\n\n02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:02.360\nEven whether or not I can afford it,\n\n02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:08.360\nit fucking is going to end with me in a drip pan of society or president.\n\n02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:09.360\nYeah.\n\n02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:14.360\nThese are people who believe that training your mind is as important as,\n\n02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:17.360\nyou know, athletes think training their bodies are.\n\n02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:19.360\nSo if you think that training your mind is important,\n\n02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:20.360\nMinerva's where you should be.\n\n02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:21.360\nExcellent.\n\n02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:22.360\nAnd Josh Andraski, we just brought back,\n\n02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:24.360\nbecause he was an awesome guest last time,\n\n02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:27.360\nand we actually, I want to have Josh back regularly just to tell us about shit\n\n02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:29.360\nthat, like, would normally make us sad,\n\n02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:31.360\nbut we're going to turn it into little games and things.\n\n02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:33.360\nBut we didn't have a chance to do that this time.\n\n02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:34.360\nI'll be back.\n\n02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:35.360\nThank you.\n\n02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:36.360\nI appreciate you coming back.\n\n02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:39.360\nAnd I appreciate you guys tangling and not dismissing each other,\n\n02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:41.360\neven though you had some disagreements.\n\n02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:43.360\nIt was interesting to hear you guys talk.\n\n02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:50.360\nI felt like I might be an award worthy cable access host.\n\n02:02:50.360
