Dino has lost his voice.\n\n00:56.000 --> 01:00.000\nSpeaking of people who have lost their voices, let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown.\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:18.000\nWe have Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:36.000\nYou will be with me.\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:44.000\nI would like to thank our nine and a half...\n\n01:44.000 --> 02:00.000\nThank you, Goliath, for doing the sound tonight and making sure that all the microphones are at the right height.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:10.000\nWho puts a mic that high?

Leads to the degradation of the human body.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:12.000\nSo you kids, trigger warning.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:18.000\nDon't...

I sang Sussudio.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:54.000\nWhen Harmon does Sussudio, it's fucking...\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:56.000\nMake you regret it.\n\n03:56.000 --> 04:02.000\nIf you put my name in the hat and Phil Collins is involved,\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:06.000\nI will make sure that you and Phil Collins\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:10.000\nand the ghost of every girlfriend I've ever had,\n\n04:10.000 -->

04:30.000\nWhoa.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:32.000\nNow.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:34.000\nThank you.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:36.000\nGive me a chance.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:38.000\nGive me a sign.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:40.000\nIt's coming back.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:42.000\nMy lyrics are poorly written.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:46.000\nYou know the worst written song in the world?\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:49.000\nPink by Sarah Smith.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:51.000\nTerrible song.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:54.000\nPink is a color...\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:56.000\nThat's what ruined my voice.\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:58.000\nOkay, so anyways, so our voices...\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:00.000\nWhy is he ignoring me?\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:02.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:04.000\nYou're going to think that Dino is doing a bit right now\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:06.000\nspeaking in a falsetto.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:08.000\nThis is the only level that I could speak at.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:10.000\nBecause when I...\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:12.000\nI ruined the normal part of my voice.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:14.000\nI could talk a little bit like this.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:16.000\nBut I think this is cuter.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:18.000\nYeah, so he's been doing that\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:20.000\nand you think, oh, that would get old.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:22.000\nAll fucking dang.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:24.000\nBut...\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:26.000\nI was like...\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:28.000\nI was like, you fucking cunt!\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:32.000\nBut it does get charismatic after a

that.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:42.000\nAnd you can too.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nBecause it's a cartoon voice.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:46.000\nHey, he's like a racist steamboat Willie.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:48.000\nThat's...\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:50.000\nSteamboat Willie already racist.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:52.000\nOkay.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:54.000\nWhat are you doing?\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:56.000\nThat was my accident.\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:58.000\nStop making music.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:00.000\nAll right.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:02.000\nSo I apologize for my throat.\n\n06:02.000 -->

06:12.000\nIt's...\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:14.000\nThere's wear and tear involved.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:16.000\nWe have a great show for you tonight.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:18.000\nWhat I've...\n\n06:18.000

50:58.420\nOh my God, it's coming over here.\n\n50:58.420 --> 51:03.180\nBased on, based on what Jeff Davis' story is about,\n\n51:03.180 --> 51:06.340\nI believe that your story will go something like this.\n\n51:06.340 --> 51:08.420\nScott, get ready to fill in as-\n\n51:08.420 --> 51:11.180\nI was at a place,\n\n51:12.420 --> 51:13.820\nand I was just hanging out.\n\n51:13.820 --> 51:16.380\nAnd I was reading Moby Dick.\n\n51:16.380 --> 51:20.780\nSo far, you're right on target.\n\n51:21.780 --> 51:22.940\nI was just reading it,\n\n51:22.940 --> 51:25.260\nbecause I think it's interesting.\n\n51:25.260 --> 51:28.060\nI wasn't reading it, because it's a classic.\n\n51:28.060 --> 51:30.260\nI didn't even know what a classic is.\n\n51:32.260 --> 51:36.260\nAnd the first of two women came up to me and said,\n\n51:37.260 --> 51:39.260\nwhat are you doing?\n\n51:39.260 --> 51:40.260\nWhat are you doing?\n\n51:41.260 --> 51:43.260\nAnd I said, Moby Dick.\n\n51:43.260 --> 51:47.260\nAnd she said, thank you.\n\n51:47.260 --> 51:54.260\nSo, thank you.\n\n51:55.260 --> 51:58.260\nAnd then her sister came up.\n\n51:58.260 --> 52:00.260\nI said, what's going on?\n\n52:00.260 --> 52:03.260\nAnd she said, this guy's reading Moby Dick.\n\n52:03.260 --> 52:05.260\nAnd she's like, why?\n\n52:05.260 --> 52:07.260\nAnd I explained Moby Dick to her.\n\n52:07.260 --> 52:10.260\nAnd when I finished, she went, thank you.\n\n52:11.260 --> 52:13.260\nAnd then we went back.\n\n52:13.260 --> 52:17.260\nI'm sorry, I was spilling it.\n\n52:17.260 --> 52:20.260\nI was spilling it anyway.\n\n52:23.260 --> 52:25.260\nBlood magic.\n\n52:27.260 --> 52:31.260\nThere isn't a show after us tonight.\n\n52:32.260 --> 52:36.260\nAnd then we had sex and they both said, thank you.\n\n52:39.260 --> 52:41.260\nWhat was your story?\n\n52:41.260 --> 52:44.260\nWell, now he's going to lie.\n\n52:45.260 --> 52:47.260\nIn a threesome.\n\n52:47.260 --> 52:50.260\nDina, you've had more threesome than I've had for certain.\n\n52:50.260 --> 52:53.260\nBecause you're a purveyor of weird threesome.\n\n52:53.260 --> 52:55.260\nYeah, I'm very insecure.\n\n52:56.260 --> 52:59.260\nUsually there's somebody that says, let's have a threesome.\n\n52:59.260 --> 53:03.260\nAnd that person is the one that gets bummed out at the end of it.\n\n53:03.260 --> 53:07.260\nBecause they didn't get all the attention they wanted.\n\n53:07.260 --> 53:12.260\nAnd I was like, you can just be there. I didn't want anything out of this except\n\n53:12.260 --> 53:15.260\nyou got bummed out during the threesome.\n\n53:15.260 --> 53:16.260\nRight?\n\n53:16.260 --> 53:18.260\nYeah, it's usually one of the women.\n\n53:20.260 --> 53:23.260\nYeah, because they outnumber you two to one, statistically.\n\n53:23.260 --> 53:27.260\nWell, yeah, I already gave up from the beginning.\n\n53:27.260 --> 53:29.260\nI'm like, I'm just going to sit this one out.\n\n53:29.260 --> 53:32.260\nBy the way, is there anybody, because it's New York, who knows.\n\n53:32.260 --> 53:36.260\nIs there anybody that's had an awesome threesome that also wants to talk about it?\n\n53:36.260 --> 53:37.260\nWith Jeff?\n\n53:37.260 --> 53:39.260\nI see a handle.\n\n53:39.260 --> 53:41.260\nWho here had a threesome with me?\n\n53:41.260 --> 53:43.260\nWell, I see a guy pointing at his friend.\n\n53:43.260 --> 53:45.260\nWhich means that you were a purveyor.\n\n53:45.260 --> 53:48.260\nCan we get a bearded guy with a wristband on him?\n\n53:48.260 --> 53:50.260\nDo you want to talk about it?\n\n53:50.260 --> 53:52.260\nYour friend wants you to talk about it.\n\n53:52.260 --> 53:53.260\nDo you want to talk about it?\n\n53:53.260 --> 53:54.260\nHe's got a good beard.\n\n53:54.260 --> 53:55.260\nJust bring him up.\n\n53:56.260 --> 53:58.260\nAlso, Jane's raising her hand.\n\n53:58.260 --> 54:00.260\nWe'll get

I put a red wig on him in the right size...\n\n56:38.260 --> 56:39.260\nBecause of the fingerless gloves.\n\n56:39.260 --> 56:40.260\nI wouldn't...\n\n56:40.260 --> 56:44.260\nNo one with a dick my size would ever wear fingerless gloves.\n\n56:44.260 --> 56:45.260\nFingerless gloves?\n\n56:45.260 --> 56:48.260\nBecause they go like, well, what am I trying to prove?\n\n56:48.260 -->

girlfriend for eight years.\n\n58:47.260 --> 58:55.260\nI moved to New York City from Maryland seven years ago.\n\n58:55.260 --> 58:57.260\nI grew up in Potomac.\n\n58:57.260 --> 59:00.260\nThey just started a Real Housewives of Potomac this season.\n\n59:00.260 --> 59:03.260\nBut that's not important.\n\n59:03.260 --> 59:05.260\nArshan, sit down.\n\n59:05.260 --> 59:06.260\nWe have enough information.\n\n59:06.260 --> 59:07.260\nNo, come on.\n\n59:07.260 --> 59:08.260\nWhat are you doing?\n\n59:08.260 --> 59:09.260\nSo I moved up here.\n\n59:09.260 --> 59:10.260\nLet him tell us.\n\n59:10.260 --> 59:15.260\nAnd then the first girlfriend I got, she went to NYU.\n\n59:15.260 --> 59:18.260\nShe's very smart.\n\n59:18.260 --> 59:21.260\nYou have to be to go to that school.\n\n59:21.260 --> 59:22.260\nRight?\n\n59:22.260 --> 59:25.260\nWe dated for seven years.\n\n59:25.260 --> 59:27.260\nShare your face with the audience.\n\n59:27.260 --> 59:28.260\nAnd then...\n\n59:28.260 --> 59:29.260\nGood.\n\n59:29.260 --> 59:30.260\nWe grew apart.\n\n59:30.260 --> 59:31.260\nWe grew apart.\n\n59:31.260 --> 59:36.260\nAnd then once we grew apart, we got back together.\n\n59:36.260 --> 59:42.260\nAnd then it basically all became about just having fun.\n\n59:42.260 --> 59:44.260\nAnd what does fun mean?\n\n59:44.260 --> 59:47.260\nFun means we date other people.\n\n59:47.260 --> 59:50.260\nSo fun is not being with each other.\n\n59:50.260 --> 59:51.260\nYeah.\n\n59:51.260 --> 59:55.260\nWe now take it to Arshan's threesome.\n\n59:55.260 --> 59:58.260\nI want to hear the story.\n\n59:58.260 --> 59:59.260\nI want to hear more.\n\n59:59.260 --> 01:00:01.260\nDon't heckle him.\n\n01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:03.260\nHe's volunteering information.\n\n01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:04.260\nSo...\n\n01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:05.260\nHe might sing.\n\n01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:06.260\nLook at him.\n\n01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:07.260\nI'm like Seinfeld.\n\n01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:09.260\nWhen Kramer was racist and Cypher was like...\n\n01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:10.260\nStop.\n\n01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:11.260\nCan we get Arshan?\n\n01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:12.260\nIt's not funny.\n\n01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:19.260\nCan we get Arshan a special light?\n\n01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:20.260\nPerfect.\n\n01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:28.260\nSo they met on Tinder and they got along really well.\n\n01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:33.260\nThey were nice to each other.\n\n01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:38.260\nMy girlfriend, she had just colored her hair red.\n\n01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:42.260\nThe girl she was with, her hair was actually red.\n\n01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:47.260\nShe was a redhead.\n\n01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:50.260\nShe was like, hey, so when are you coming home tonight?\n\n01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:53.260\nI was like, I'll be home like 12, maybe 12, 15.\n\n01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:55.260\nI was like, okay, that's fine.\n\n01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:57.260\nIf you come a little later, it's cool.\n\n01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.260\nI'll be with you.\n\n01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:04.260\nLet's just say her name is Quarter.\n\n01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:07.260\nSorry, what is her name?\n\n01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:09.260\nGo back to that part.\n\n01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:12.260\nUse other delineations of change.\n\n01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:15.260\nQuarter, dime.\n\n01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:19.260\nI didn't say you're protecting the time from defamation.\n\n01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:22.260\nSo you're saying her name is Penny, but you're going to call her Quarter.\n\n01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:23.260\nScott!\n\n01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:25.260\nOkay, okay, okay.\n\n01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:27.260\nThe names have been changed.\n\n01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.260\nThat's cool.\n\n01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:29.260\nApparently.\n\n01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:33.260\nCould you just call her Kennedy Head instead?\n\n01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:35.260\nKennedy Head.\n\n01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:37.260\nYes, that's fine.\n\n01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.260\nI'll be home a little bit later.\n\n01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:44.260\nSo I was out gallivanting with Ryan, who's over there.\n\n01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:51.260\nThen I get home and, oh, so you and Penny are friends.\n\n01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:54.260\nCome on, no, come on, come on.\n\n01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:56.260\nI'm protecting him.\n\n01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:58.260\nHe's volunteering information.\n\n01:01:58.260 --> 01:01:59.260\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:01.260\nSo I...\n\n01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:03.260\nStop, no, stop it.\n\n01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:05.260\nStop, stop heckling.\n\n01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:06.260\nThat's my whole story.\n\n01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:09.260\nSo I walk into the apartment and they're having fun.\n\n01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:10.260\nWhat does fun mean?\n\n01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:12.260\nI just joined in.\n\n01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:13.260\nSo their fun is being together.\n\n01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:16.260\nYour fun is not being with your girlfriend.\n\n01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:17.260\nThat's not what I said.\n\n01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:21.260\nThat was my first introduction into this moment.\n\n01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:23.260\nSo the two of them were having fun.\n\n01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:26.260\nAnd then I come in and they're like, hey, join in.\n\n01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:27.260\nIt's over.\n\n01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:28.260\nOh, okay.\n\n01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:29.260\nOkay, all right.\n\n01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:32.260\nSo your girlfriend's name?\n\n01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:33.260\nEmily.\n\n01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:34.260\nEmily.\n\n01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.260\nAnd the other girl?\n\n01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:36.260\nPenny.\n\n01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:37.260\nQuarter.\n\n01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:38.260\nPenny?\n\n01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:39.260\nPenny.\n\n01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:40.260\nPenny.\n\n01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:41.260\nEmily and Penny.\n\n01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:42.260\nEmily and Penny.\n\n01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:43.260\nAll right.\n\n01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.260\nWhat was your name?\n\n01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:45.260\nArshan.\n\n01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:46.260\nArshan.\n\n01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.260\nRespect him.\n\n01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:50.260\nHe asked for sexual permission and he came up and volunteered it.\n\n01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:58.260\nIt's not that impressive of a story, but I feel like they shouldn't be that impressive,\n\n01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:00.260\nbecause threesomes should be normal.\n\n01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:01.260\nWhat year is this?\n\n01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:02.260\nI don't know.\n\n01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:03.260\nHow many?\n\n01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:04.260\nAll right.\n\n01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:05.260\nAm I going to get beat up?\n\n01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:06.260\nArshan?\n\n01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:07.260\nWhat year is this?\n\n01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:08.260\nI don't know why it was awkward.\n\n01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:10.260\nI think it's just happened all the time.\n\n01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:11.260\nIt was this year.\n\n01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:12.260\nIt was this year.\n\n01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:13.260\nIt was this year.\n\n01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.260\nIt was this year.\n\n01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:15.260\nAll right.\n\n01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:16.260\nWe now take you to Arshan's first or second present.\n\n01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:17.260\nThank you, Arshan.\n\n01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:18.260\nThank you very much.\n\n01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:19.260\nThank you.\n\n01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:20.260\nThank you.\n\n01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:21.260\nFor your vulnerability and your honesty.\n\n01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:22.260\nThank you.\n\n01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:24.260\nWho wants to play the role of Arshan right now?\n\n01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:25.260\nI will be Arshan.\n\n01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:27.260\nScott adds it will play the role of Arshan.\n\n01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:30.260\nAnd that means Dan and Dino.\n\n01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:33.260\nI should not be in this.\n\n01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:36.260\nI definitely think you should be in this.\n\n01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:39.260\nDan will play Emily and Dino will play Penny.\n\n01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:41.260\nI wasn't listening.\n\n01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:42.260\nOkay.\n\n01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:44.260\nWe hadn't actually gotten to your part yet.\n\n01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:46.260\nI was so fucking bored.\n\n01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:48.260\nDino, it was all preamble.\n\n01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:51.260\nThere was no story yet.\n\n01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.260\nIt's 9-11.\n\n01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:56.260\nThank you, New York.\n\n01:03:56.260 --> 01:04:01.260\nFade in.\n\n01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:02.260\nFade in.\n\n01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:05.260\nTom Clancy presents.\n\n01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:10.260\nPrelude to a shit storm.\n\n01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:18.260\nThe year is 2075.\n\n01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:24.260\nFor the radio audience, Jeff is doing a brilliant cigarette character bit.\n\n01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.260\nPenny.\n\n01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:28.260\nPenny.\n\n01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:30.260\nDino, you're Penny.\n\n01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:32.260\nI'm who?\n\n01:04:32.260

phone.\n\n01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:42.260\nWe both saw it.\n\n01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:44.260\nScott adds it and I both said that was fake.\n\n01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:46.260\nTen minutes later.\n\n01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:50.260\nTen minutes later.\n\n01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:52.260\nThat's real.\n\n01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:54.260\nThat's real.\n\n01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:57.260\nI wasn't listening to the story.\n\n01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:59.260\nPenny.\n\n01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:02.260\nPenny, I know you're taking a shit.\n\n01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:05.260\nI feel bad about you falling down just now.\n\n01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:07.260\nFive minutes ago.\n\n01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:11.260\nBut my boyfriend, or Sean, is coming over.\n\n01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:12.260\nWhat?\n\n01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:18.260\nYes, I'm dating an Armenian.\n\n01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:20.260\nEven my best friends don't know that.\n\n01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:25.260\nBut I'm telling you, Penny, that I'm dating an Armenian.\n\n01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:26.260\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:30.260\nI'm not an improviser.\n\n01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.260\nPenny, it's okay.\n\n01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:32.260\nBe in the moment.\n\n01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:35.260\nSay yes and that's all that matters.\n\n01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:38.260\nBecause we're going to have a threesome soon.\n\n01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:42.260\nI don't care that you weren't listening during our Sean's monologue.\n\n01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:44.260\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:46.260\nYeah, you're not allowed to.\n\n01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:47.260\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:49.260\nI'm God.\n\n01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:51.260\nOh, Penny.\n\n01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:58.260\nIgnorance isn't an excuse.\n\n01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:00.260\nPenny, the Lord has spoken.\n\n01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:01.260\nThe Lord has spoken.\n\n01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:03.260\nMy Armenian boyfriend is coming over.\n\n01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:04.260\nOkay.\n\n01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:05.260\nHe might be Syrian.\n\n01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:06.260\nI don't fucking know.\n\n01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:07.260\nOkay.\n\n01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:08.260\nDino.\n\n01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:09.260\nDino.\n\n01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:10.260\nYeah, what?\n\n01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:11.260\nThis is the devil.\n\n01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:13.260\nFuck this scene up.\n\n01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:15.260\nDino?\n\n01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:17.260\nDon't listen to the devil.\n\n01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:18.260\nSay

scene.\n\n01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:28.260\nIf you are, it's a bad scene.\n\n01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:31.260\nDino, this is Emily.\n\n01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:32.260\nStay in the moment.\n\n01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:36.260\nWhy are you calling me my name, but you're a character?\n\n01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:37.260\nYou're Penny.\n\n01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:39.260\nI'm only using this because you don't know where the fuck we are.\n\n01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:40.260\nYou said Dino.\n\n01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:41.260\nEmily, I meant Penny.\n\n01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:42.260\nDino.\n\n01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:43.260\nYou're fucking Penny.\n\n01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:46.260\nDino, you can win this scene.\n\n01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:47.260\nDino.\n\n01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:48.260\nDino.\n\n01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:49.260\nWhat?\n\n01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:56.260\nYou can win this scene if you give the audience on your side, not on Jeff's.\n\n01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:58.260\nDino, this is God.\n\n01:06:58.260

01:11:43.260\nRight.\n\n01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:49.260\nHe's all eyebrows and no cock.\n\n01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:54.260\nSome stereotypes are true.\n\n01:11:54.260 --> 01:12:00.260\nWhen he gets here, I want me to be the bottom.\n\n01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:07.260\nI want you to be the top and I want him to be the peanut butter in that sandwich.\n\n01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:12.260\nNow Dino's going to become a certain kind of character, like a cowboy or a pirate.\n\n01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:18.260\nSo what kind of character should Dino be?\n\n01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:19.260\nAnybody?\n\n01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:20.260\nAnybody?\n\n01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:21.260\nWhat is it?\n\n01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:22.260\nObsessive compulsive.\n\n01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:23.260\nObsessive compulsive.\n\n01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:24.260\nObsessive compulsive.\n\n01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:25.260\nObsessive compulsive.\n\n01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:26.260\nObsessive compulsive.\n\n01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:27.260\nObsessive compulsive.\n\n01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:28.260\nObsessive compulsive.\n\n01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:29.260\nObsessive compulsive.\n\n01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:30.260\nI could go.\n\n01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:33.260\nYeah, yeah yeah.\n\n01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:37.260\nI'd say Arshan should be the peanut butter in the sandwich.\n\n01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:38.260\nWhat do you think?\n\n01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:43.260\nHold on, I've got to turn the lights on and off about a thousand times.\n\n01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:44.260\nFreeze!\n\n01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:51.260\nNow Jeff is going to continue this in a different style like a western or a pirate movie.\n\n01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:57.960\nSo what is Jeff going to do on the scene now?\n\n01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:04.960\nI heard improv scene. Improv scene, go. Improv scene. Improv scene. No, you shouldn't.\n\n01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:18.120\nFreeze! Okay, well we need now. Freeze, freeze, freeze. In this improv scene, the character\n\n01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:24.200\nof Scott Adson is asking for suggestions. He is played by your favorite actor. Your favorite\n\n01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:31.200\nactor. Liam Neeson. No, we go with the first suggestion. I heard Liam Neeson. Liam Neeson\n\n01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:41.560\nis now running the improv scene. Liam Neeson. This is Liam Neeson playing an improv caller.\n\n01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:48.560\nOkay, so this is what's going to happen. Okay, what we need, what we need is the last\n\n01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:55.560\nline. Freeze, freeze, freeze. Your favorite period in history. Victorian, call an improv\n\n01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:05.160\nscene in the Victorian era. What we're going to do now, right away, is we're going to get\n\n01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:17.160\none last suggestion, which is a last line of dialogue. What wraps up that old scene and\n\n01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:24.120\nkeeps everybody on their cobblers? So, what's the last line of dialogue? I heard,\n\n01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:31.120\nroom, power, look out! That's the last line or first line? That's the last line of dialogue,\n\n01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:41.240\nmy cheeky. Arshon, I'm here with Penny, my friend. She's in the bathroom right now.\n\n01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:47.240\nWe're going to have the world's worst threesome. Who's we? You and me, Arshon. You're Arshon\n\n01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:54.080\nnow. And her? Yeah, Penny is in the bathroom. Follow me. You know I'm Armenian. I don't\n\n01:14:54.080 --> 01:15:01.080\ndeserve this. Racially, racially. Freeze! I'm going to respond to something even more\n\n01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:08.080\nracist. Who can think of something even more racist? Nigger! Nigger! Nigger! Nigger! Nigger!\n\n01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:16.080\nNigger! Nigger! Nigger! Nigger! Nigger! Nigger! And scene, scene, everybody. Thank you so\n\n01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:23.080\nmuch. You see, improv isn't hard. Improv is easy. All you have to do is be a racist. Let's bring\n\n01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:30.080\nup transgender Jay! You all ready to open your mind? You all thought you knew what gender\n\n01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:37.080\nwas? You're wrong. Transgender Jay! You all thought you knew what gender was? You're\n\n01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:44.080\nwrong. Transgender Jay! This motherfucker doesn't give a shit about gender! If you don't know\n\n01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:14.080\nwhat gender is, you probably do give a lot of shits about gender. Dignity. I bring some\n\n01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:21.760\ndignity to the stage. Good luck. I hope. What are you talking about tonight? We said so\n\n01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:28.600\nmany things. I've cried eight times. I'll talk to you over the last two days. One of\n\n01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:38.600\nthe reasons I cried is because... By the way, we are doing a downshift right now. We're going to\n\n01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:45.600\nhike here, Jay. No, this is about to be the funniest. You downshift and you're going uphill.\n\n01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:53.600\nRaise your expectations. Raise them. When a transgender person comes up and you talk\n\n01:16:53.600 --> 01:17:00.600\nabout transgender, you should raise your expectations. Don't lower them. Raise them. This better\n\n01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:07.760\nbe the funniest part of the show. And if it's not, maybe we need to re-examine. What we\n\n01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:18.360\ntolerate? We never have... I don't know. Let's talk about the tolerance for white\n\n01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:25.360\ncis males. I'm so drugged. You guys have been running hard. Is one or more of your sons\n\n01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:39.200\nhere tonight? Is one of your kids here tonight? No, no, no children here tonight. Jane, threesomes,\n\n01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:44.720\nhave you had one or more? No children here, but they both listened to the podcast. Have\n\n01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:51.720\nyou had a threesome, Jane? I've had a threesome and a foursome in my life. We have a winner.\n\n01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:58.720\nA foursome? Jane, were they all with yourself? Come on. Fuck you. Jane, the foursome. How\n\n01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:13.520\ndo you know when you're having a foursome? What was the lineup in the foursome? What was\n\n01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:19.520\nthe ratio of male female presenters? What did you have? Oh, God, that's complicated. Yeah.\n\n01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:25.520\nThat's my point. What's the difference between a foursome and just a weird night at a hotel?\n\n01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:31.520\nSo I think... All of the others were... The Henderson's came over for Christmas. Yeah.\n\n01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:37.520\nAnd it was a foursome. That foursome, who were they? Or in terms of gender, specificity,\n\n01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:44.520\nand what was the set up to that? Let's see, we had me, a genetic male presenting female\n\n01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:51.800\nthis pre-hormone. We had three then genetic females, two of whom are sort of... Two were\n\n01:18:54.320 --> 01:19:00.320\nbisexual, one was non-bisexual, where they exactly sit in terms of gender preference\n\n01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:07.320\nand presentation. Two of them enjoyed doing drag kings, so they certainly had sort of\n\n01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:11.320\nthat sort of aspect. Drag kings. Drag kings. That's the thing. I love that. Oh, my God.\n\n01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:18.320\nDrag kings, that's women who do parody male presentation. Yeah. But they weren't dragging\n\n01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:23.720\nat the time that we were doing this, but it was just this level of complexity. Who's\n\n01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:30.720\nthat guy? Oh, he's a peer provider. No, but... What are the things that we've talked about\n\n01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:37.800\na lot? What are you describing as Oprah's primordial soup of sexuality? Well, it was\n\n01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:42.200\na situation where four people really enjoyed each other and it really didn't matter what\n\n01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:49.200\nparts they brought to the game. And so four people doing it, right? I think that happened\n\n01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:56.200\nat some point. Yeah, it doesn't look bad. But yeah, there were some shaking parts, yes.\n\n01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:07.720\nWas the foursome a successful event? Did everybody get what they wanted? Was it a good affair?\n\n01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:14.720\nIt was wonderful. It was beautiful and spiritual and it was fabulous. You always have to one\n\n01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:21.720\nup me, don't you? Sorry. And yeah. Do you ever... Dan, pick your foursome. Who is it?\n\n01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:34.680\nLike cast your foursome. Cast your own foursome. Okay. Karen Gillum from Dr. Hoot is just\n\n01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:41.680\nthere, but she's not involved. She's directing. She's wearing jot purse and like a hat that\n\n01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:52.280\nsays director. If she takes off her clothes, she'll gain too much status. So she's there.\n\n01:20:52.280 --> 01:21:06.040\nShe's watching through a glass booth. I'm... I love that guy. That guy's like, he's like,\n\n01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:13.040\nfuck it, I want Karen Gillum to watch me fuck. She's behind glass bulletproof. Dan, for real,\n\n01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:23.040\nlike... What? For real. Let's get behind the facade of the guy who gets fired in the five weeks. I\n\n01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:29.040\nwant to know what turns you on in a foursome. I'm telling you. But you're fumfering. I'm\n\n01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:37.040\ntrying to figure it out. I'm fumfering. What did you say? I'm sorry to say. I'll pick three\n\n01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:53.040\npeople. That guy is a fascist. Guess what? I don't have to pick three people. You don't buy it\n\n01:21:53.040 --> 01:22:01.040\nfor me. You're right to not buy that. Pick three genders. You only get three genders. Pick\n\n01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:06.040\nthree genders. He doesn't have to only three genders though. He can pick among three genders.\n\n01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:12.040\nThey can be all one or they can be all three. Or agendered. But don't corner yourself out of\n\n01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:18.040\nthis. I will say I want to bring this to a respectable place because you guys are being\n\n01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:26.040\nbad people. So I want to be vulnerable and tell you. I had a dream recently. In my dream, I had a\n\n01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:36.040\nvery vivid sexual dream where my ex-girlfriend, ex-ex, like previous relationship, I walked into\n\n01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:44.040\na party and she was splayed out on a couch. And there were like people, like she was very\n\n01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:52.040\nsexy. And they were like, in the dream, I was very, I was just turned on by, I was just\n\n01:22:52.040 --> 01:23:05.040\nwatching her get sexed with guys that were like, you know, Ryan Gosling. Like they did sit-ups\n\n01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:13.040\never. And she was like, I'm so happy you've done sit-ups. But she wasn't like, oh, you're\n\n01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:19.040\ndick so much bigger than Dan Harmon's. She was like, happy to see me. And I was happy to see\n\n01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:25.040\nher. But I was also happy to see her plowed by like bucks.\n\n01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:35.040\nWere you chatting friendly? I was like watching and jerking off. And then I woke up. So I don't\n\n01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:40.040\nknow where I got. But I wanted to volunteer that because I want this show to be a place where\n\n01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:46.040\npeople are vulnerable. Thank you, sir. I want this to be a place where people are vulnerable.\n\n01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:53.040\nDan, in that dream, cast three guys that you want to see that, whatever the ex-girlfriend is, who\n\n01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:58.040\nare the three people that you want to see your ex-girlfriend in that dream be fucking?\n\n01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:00.040\nWell, I don't, I mean, the guys would be, I mean-\n\n01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:04.040\nYou said Ryan Gosling.

I'm saying pick the guy.\n\n01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:32.040\nI don't pick the guy. I know you want it to be you and you're fine.\n\n01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:34.040\nNo, you can do it. You can do it.\n\n01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:36.040\nNo, I want it to be Antonio Banderas.\n\n01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:40.040\nNo, you can fuck Sarah Johnson.\n\n01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:44.040\nAll right,

You fucking sold out.\n\n01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:08.040\nThose people are good people.\n\n01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:11.040\nWell, everyone's good people, and I'm going to take a shit on the stage.\n\n01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:13.040\nYeah, go ahead.\n\n01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:16.040\nAlso, like a million people got shot last night.\n\n01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:18.040\nAll right, go ahead.\n\n01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:21.040\nThanks for that, Tia.\n\n01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:26.040\nToo late?\n\n01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:29.040\nToo real, or not real enough, I don't know.\n\n01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:31.040\nWe had to walk through it.\n\n01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:34.040\nI didn't kind of distract us with that.\n\n01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:38.040\nThere's 12 NYPD guys outside.\n\n01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:42.040\nFor me, because we talked about this earlier today,\n\n01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:49.040\nI'm a dummy coming late to the party of knowing how to have a vocabulary about how to address it.\n\n01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:52.040\nThe pronouns is like the trouble for me.\n\n01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:55.040\nWe just want to know how to say things, but like meeting you,\n\n01:39:55.040 --> 01:40:01.040\nyou're my first introduction into saying...\n\n01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:07.040\nHaving a concept about the idea that gender could be any old thing.\n\n01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:09.040\nCould be anything, right?\n\n01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:16.040\nIt really comes down to from the part of the person who's presenting themselves\n\n01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:21.040\nas a non-traditional gender combination or whatever it is.\n\n01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:24.040\nSensitivity just has to be there from everybody.\n\n01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:29.040\nEveryone's kind of coming into this new game, kind of unprepared.\n\n01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:31.040\nOur culture isn't prepared to deal.\n\n01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:33.040\nOur language isn't prepared to deal with it.\n\n01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:40.040\nSo given that, and given the fact that people deserve to be treated humanely on both sides,\n\n01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:41.040\neveryone...\n\n01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:43.040\nWell, don't be a dick.\n\n01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:46.040\nEveryone has to be ready to engage.\n\n01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:49.040\nAnd if someone isn't ready to engage, say with me,\n\n01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:54.040\nand they insist on calling me he, he, he, or whatever,\n\n01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:55.040\nwhat am I going to do?\n\n01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:56.040\nChange them? No.\n\n01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:58.040\nIf we're going to change them all, I'm going to change them.\n\n01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:00.040\nI'm just continuing to be a good person.\n\n01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:03.040\nAnd you've just got to learn to let things roll off your back.\n\n01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:06.040\nI've been letting things roll off my back for a long time.\n\n01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:11.040\nThe world isn't going to change in my lifetime.\n\n01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:13.040\nI can't...\n\n01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:16.040\nBut I've got to go on and have my life and have it as good as I can\n\n01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:18.040\nand make the life as good for everybody.\n\n01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:20.040\nWhat's great about you, and also other friends of ours,\n\n01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:24.040\nis that when we fuck up, when we mispronounce,\n\n01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:28.040\nand we say the wrong thing, you never go, you did it wrong.\n\n01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:30.040\nYou never shame us.\n\n01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:32.040\nYou should be ashamed of yourself.\n\n01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:34.040\nThere's no resolution there.\n\n01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:37.040\nYou did it wrong, here's how to do it right.\n\n01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:40.040\nThat's not how you teach people, that's not how you model good behavior.\n\n01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:45.040\nYou just step back, and if there's an opportunity to re-engage and educate,\n\n01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:47.040\ngreat, you do that, if it's not...\n\n01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:49.040\nThis isn't a formal education, it's informal education.\n\n01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:53.040\nIt's nice being in a city, and there are cities all over the world\n\n01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:59.040\nthat where people are progressive and open themselves up to this stuff.\n\n01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:01.040\nThe fact that there's a conversation that happens about this,\n\n01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:07.040\nwhen I was a kid, there was gay, straight, and maybe a third color called bi.\n\n01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:10.040\nThere were three colors in that.\n\n01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:13.040\nI was hungry, I was hungry.\n\n01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:20.040\nThe idea now that sexuality can be any shade, any thing,\n\n01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:23.040\nis a new thing for everybody.\n\n01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:27.040\nIt's always been there.\n\n01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.040\nWe never have vocabulary for it.\n\n01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:31.040\nExactly, exactly, and that's what's been brilliant lately,\n\n01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:34.040\nis that really coming from kids mostly,\n\n01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:39.040\nis just redefining the language and coming up with all these great terms.\n\n01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:41.040\nUnfortunately, it makes for the alphabet suit of like,\n\n01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:44.040\nlgbtqqia...\n\n01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:47.040\nQQGGIA.com\n\n01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:50.040\nJane, you look like a guy,\n\n01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:54.040\na converse in jeans and stuff,\n\n01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:59.040\nand to say she, I have to wrap my brain around that,\n\n01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:03.040\nand it's a new thing that I have to let myself do.\n\n01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:05.040\nLet me tell you an interesting story.\n\n01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:08.040\nEvery time I go, when I fly, and I go through the airport,\n\n01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:11.040\nand I go through the porno scanner,\n\n01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:15.040\nI get flagged, and I'm usually dressing,\n\n01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:18.040\nI tend to present relatively male,\n\n01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:21.040\nbut because I come through and I'm presenting male,\n\n01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:24.040\nit is someone's job, and it's going to be,\n\n01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:28.040\nit's honestly someone's job, to push a button on that machine,\n\n01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:32.040\na red, a pink button, or a blue button, literally,\n\n01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:36.040\nthat they read, okay, I'm reading this person as male,\n\n01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:38.040\npush the blue button.\n\n01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:40.040\nThat sets up a particular algorithm in the machine\n\n01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:43.040\nthat then says, okay, look, when you do this scan,\n\n01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:47.040\nif there's anything close to the outline of a standard body\n\n01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:50.040\nthat is an anomaly, that person needs to be checked.\n\n01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:54.040\nSo if I'm going through and I'm reading as male,\n\n01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:58.040\nI'm wearing a bra, and so I have a bra strap in the back\n\n01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:00.040\nthat sets off the machine.\n\n01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:02.040\nYou have to be stepped over.\n\n01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:04.040\nAnd that's the pink button, right?\n\n01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:06.040\nNo, so they push the blue button.\n\n01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:09.040\nI thought pink meant like your dick color.\n\n01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:11.040\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:13.040\nThat's a different pink.\n\n01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:15.040\nIt's not the color of his dick.\n\n01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:17.040\nI didn't know.\n\n01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:18.040\nThey're trying to read that.\n\n01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:19.040\nI didn't know.\n\n01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:21.040\nYeah, be educated, be educated.\n\n01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:26.040\nBut the thing that's also really fucked up then\n\n01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:28.040\nis because I was read as male,\n\n01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:32.040\na male, a guy comes up to actually do my pat down.\n\n01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:34.040\nWhich by the way, I mean...\n\n01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:36.040\nBut then I have to look him in the eye and say,\n\n01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:38.040\nthere's something between your shoulder blades.\n\n01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:42.040\nAnd I have to go, it's my bra.\n\n01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:44.040\nBut that puts it on me.\n\n01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:47.040\nI'll do it, and it feels pretty cool to do it.\n\n01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:50.040\nBut it's also, it sucks.\n\n01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:53.040\nIt sucks that there's a system in place at this point.\n\n01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:55.040\nI mean, it's not just friends misreading\n\n01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:58.040\nor messing up on a pronoun.\n\n01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:00.040\nThis is an entire system, security system,\n\n01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:02.040\nI'm forced to go through to go on a plan.\n\n01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:04.040\nI could go around, I could do TSA pre-check,\n\n01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:07.040\nor I could just go straight to a pat down.\n\n01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:10.040\nWe all know 95% is not effective.\n\n01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:13.040\nAnd they're not, they're trying their best\n\n01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:16.040\nbecause they're going, oh, what we don't want\n\n01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:21.040\nis for a lady to feel violated by a dude going,\n\n01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:25.040\noh, are you Al Qaeda? You're pussy.\n\n01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:27.040\nThey're trying.\n\n01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:31.040\nThey made their rules based on actually respect.\n\n01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:35.040\nBut based on respect of a dichotomy.\n\n01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:38.040\nOf a dichotomy that has been sort of irrelevant for 15 years.\n\n01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:40.040\nThe hardest thing we all have to do now is release\n\n01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:42.040\nfrom the fucking dichotomy.\n\n01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:44.040\nThat's the education thing.\n\n01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:46.040\nIt would be great for bars and restaurants\n\n01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:48.040\nbecause how much real estate do you think,\n\n01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:51.040\nthat you have to have a men's room and a women's room?\n\n01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:53.040\nIt's like, like, fucking, like, combine them.\n\n01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:55.040\nI did one shitty bathroom.\n\n01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:57.040\nThere's a hole in the floor and you're like,\n\n01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:01.040\nshit, I'm a shit in the block.\n\n01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:05.040\nThe place in Paris that you were talking about?\n\n01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:07.040\nLa Pérouse, yeah.\n\n01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:10.040\nI got this picture at an airport\n\n01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:13.040\nand it was the male bathroom, the female bathroom.\n\n01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:15.040\nIt actually had like male symbols there\n\n01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:17.040\nand blue lights of above and pink lights.\n\n01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:19.040\nThis brick wall in between the male and the female.\n\n01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:21.040\nAnd so I did this picture where it was like,\n\n01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:23.040\nthat's bathroom nine and three quarters.\n\n01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:27.040\nThat's where I need to go through that wall.\n\n01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:29.040\nThere's like all these fantasy bathrooms.\n\n01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:32.040\nThere's like trans men who are like in bathrooms\n\n01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:34.040\ndoing selfies and they're like all bummed out\n\n01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:36.040\nbecause they're like...\n\n01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:38.040\nBecause they have to be in the women's room\n\n01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:40.040\nbecause according to the rules...\n\n01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:42.040\nI'm sad.\n\n01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:44.040\nI look like Tom Scarrett, but I'm sad.\n\n01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:47.040\nLike in the women's room.\n\n01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:54.040\nI'm going to do a podcast history wrap.\n\n01:46:58.040 --> 01:47:02.040\nAnd it's going to make your struggle, Jane.\n\n01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:06.040\nSeem like nothing.\n\n01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:08.040\nI'm going to actually...\n\n01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:11.040\nEveryone who's ever had a problem...\n\n01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:15.040\nI'm going to make you feel like shit.\n\n01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:19.040\nBecause I'm going back to the streets.\n\n01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:22.040\nAnd if you think you've suffered,\n\n01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:24.040\nyou're full of shit.\n\n01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:29.040\nBecause equality.\n\n01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:31.040\nYo.\n\n01:47:31.040 -->
