WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:24.000
From New York, California, at the Gramercy Theater, the Gramercy Theater, New York City.

00:24.000 --> 00:38.000
This is my new favorite place, the Gramercy Theater. Harmontown is now in session.

00:38.000 --> 00:48.000
Let's bring out our Game Masters, Dino Stamatopoulos.

00:48.000 --> 00:56.000
That's ridiculous. Where do I sit? Go over there. Dino has lost his voice.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
Speaking of people who have lost their voices, let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown.

01:00.000 --> 01:18.000
We have Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:18.000 --> 01:36.000
You will be with me.

01:36.000 --> 01:44.000
I would like to thank our nine and a half...

01:44.000 --> 02:00.000
Thank you, Goliath, for doing the sound tonight and making sure that all the microphones are at the right height.

02:00.000 --> 02:10.000
Who puts a mic that high? I'm six feet tall. No, you're not. What? Are you? Are you six feet tall?

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
No, you're like five...

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
I'm glad I could come to New York and find out who my friends are.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
I'm clearly six feet tall, and I always have been.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
If anything...

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
All right, I'm sorry.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
Let's talk about your absence of voice right now.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
You're noticing that my voice is weird. So here's the thing.

02:42.000 --> 02:50.000
Alcoholism.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Kids, kids, thank you, thank you.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Don't brag. It's also karaoke.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
Alcoholism, comma, left unchecked.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
Leads to karaoke. Leads to the degradation of the human body.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
So you kids, trigger warning.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
Don't... Why am I holding...

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
You kids, trigger warning. You're gonna die.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
Spoiler alert.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
As you die, one of the things that will first start to die is your throat.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
I think it was just karaoke a couple of nights ago.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Don't underplay the fact that I'm dying.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
I'm dying.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
I think you're overselling the fact that you just...

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
A lot of bad karaoke a couple of nights ago.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Well, bad karaoke...

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
No, no. I sang Sussudio.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
When Harmon does Sussudio, it's fucking...

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Make you regret it.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
If you put my name in the hat and Phil Collins is involved,

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
I will make sure that you and Phil Collins

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
and the ghost of every girlfriend I've ever had,

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
walk away sad.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
I know that I'm too young.

04:18.000 --> 04:26.000
If it's just Sussudio...

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Hold it.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Whoa.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Now.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Thank you.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Give me a chance.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Give me a sign.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
It's coming back.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
My lyrics are poorly written.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
You know the worst written song in the world?

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Pink by Sarah Smith.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Terrible song.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Pink is a color...

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
That's what ruined my voice.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Okay, so anyways, so our voices...

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Why is he ignoring me?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
No, no, no.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
You're going to think that Dino is doing a bit right now

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
speaking in a falsetto.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
This is the only level that I could speak at.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Because when I...

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I ruined the normal part of my voice.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I could talk a little bit like this.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
But I think this is cuter.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Yeah, so he's been doing that

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
and you think, oh, that would get old.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
All fucking dang.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
But...

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
I was like...

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
I was like, you fucking cunt!

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
But it does get charismatic after a while.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
It's funny.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
It's like falsetto.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
You nigger!

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
And you can too.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Because it's a cartoon voice.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Hey, he's like a racist steamboat Willie.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
That's...

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Steamboat Willie already racist.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Okay.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
What are you doing?

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
That was my accident.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Stop making music.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
All right.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
So I apologize for my throat.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
It's...

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
And I say you're welcome for mine.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
It's...

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
It's...

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
It's...

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
There's wear and tear involved.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
We have a great show for you tonight.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
What I've...

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Dan and Dina are going to do some

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Everly Brothers hits.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
They're going to do a chain melody.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
It's going to be great.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Wake up, little Susie!

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
What I've done for you tonight

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
because you're the greatest city

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
in the world.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
And you're not petty people

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
who would ever applaud for that

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
because you're...

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Because you're practical people.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
You would never be baited like that.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
You would never go, yeah, I'm a good city.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Ooh!

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
That's what makes you a good city.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
You can't just call people a city.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
These people aren't a city.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
These people are the city.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
You guys are seeing

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
a very rare occurrence of the great

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
North American panda bear.

07:02.000 --> 07:08.000
LAUGHTER

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Did you...

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Did you write that?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
That's...

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
As far as you know, yeah.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
That's good.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
The panda bear.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Anyways, obviously you're a good city.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Obviously.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
History has borne that out.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
You don't need your dick sucked for that.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Dan, tell these people...

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
I got to be a city.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Big deal.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
I'm New York. I'm up city.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
I'm here forever.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Big deal.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
But you're good people.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Sorry to interrupt you.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Excuse me for one second.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
What the fuck?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
We should tell boys to shut up for a second.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Your new nickname is

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Voice.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
You got something on your face too?

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Yeah.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
You didn't look perfect.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
I know that you love New York City.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
It's one of your favorite cities in the world, correct?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
What?

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
The top ten.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
OK.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Is it in your top three?

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
It's my favorite city ever.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
OK.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Tell these people a little history

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
about New York, about how it was founded.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
LAUGHTER

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Tony!

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Because Dan, when we got really, really drunk

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
last time we were here,

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Dan went into a blackout.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Uh...

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Stay with me.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Stay with me on this concept.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Dan became a fellow named Anthony

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
who would tell you how to get around New York City.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
LAUGHTER

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
And if I ask Dan

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
where his favorite piece of pizza is

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
or how to get across town

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
or how to get to Bushwick

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
during one share of traffic,

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
you got lots of advice about it.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Yeah, I'm Anthony. I'm from New York.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
LAUGHTER

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
All right, now, Anthony.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Before you...

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Before you even ask me...

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
OK.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
I hope your question doesn't involve being below

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
103rd Street.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Well, we...

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Because the truth is, people tell you one thing or another,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
but going to New York,

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
between A Street and B Street,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
that's not New York.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
LAUGHTER

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
You guys are laughing at a different thing that...

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
LAUGHTER

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
I was laughing at...

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
I thought my character was killing me.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
I thought I was Billy Crystal.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I didn't know it was...

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
I was laughing at you spilling nine ounces of vodka.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Anthony...

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Anthony, I'm...

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
We're at 23rd and Lexington.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Oh, we shouldn't be.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
You don't want me at 23rd and Lexington.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
OK, all right.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
But that's where we are.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
We're above 103rd, or we're not New Yorkers.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
OK.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Wait, wait.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
We're below 103rd, we're not New York?

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Don't do New York below 103rd.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
LAUGHTER

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
That's where your dad lives, that's where your mom lives.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
They're good people.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
They built the city.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Are your parents all Dominican?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Look, I don't have...

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I don't have parents.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Whoa! OK, well, shit.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
New York's my parents.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
My mom was Tower One

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
and my dad was Tower Two.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
CHEERING

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Just, just soon enough.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
So, so don't...

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Don't he's an orphan?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Don't question me.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
So he's the only guy that's allowed to be there?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Yeah, don't question me.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Anthony, Anthony...

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Anyway, are you Italian?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
The falafel's good.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Above 103rd.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Any fucking arguments?

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Like, below 104th is shit.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Fucking, that's Haiti.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
You might as well go to Haiti.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Not to be racist.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
But that's where the Haitians are.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Anthony, are you Italian?

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
What are your heritage?

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
No, there's no Italy, there's no Italian.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
New York's a country.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
New York's a state of being.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Above 104th.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
That's who I am.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Now, Anthony, when you go to Little Italy,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
what street should I go?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
In Italy, there's no such thing as a Little Italy.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
There's only Little People.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Little Italians.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I think that was actors.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Little Italians, there's no Little Italy.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Italy's big.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Let's say Chinatown.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Chinatown, you know Chinatown.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
China's not a town.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
That's where you fucked up right there.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
See what you did? You fucked up.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
In New York, China

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
is

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
a principality

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
between 104th

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
and A Street.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
No, what?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Motherfucker, no.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
I'm asking you.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
I apologize, but fuck you.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
My name's Anthony.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
I'm from New York.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I've lived here my whole life.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
If you go above 104th Street,

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
that's China.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
If you go below 103rd Street,

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
that's Haiti.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
If everything left of A Street,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
that's Hebrew.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
That's good.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
That's where the good pizza is.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
If everyone's speaking Hebrew,

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
that's where you eat the pizza.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
What? Excuse me a second.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
What the fuck?

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
You brought up pizza.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
What's your favorite slice?

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Hebrew pizza.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
You don't have to interrupt to say that.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
What's the secret of Hebrew pizza?

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
The secret is obviously a covenant

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
between a chosen tribe

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
and the impersonal cosmic force.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
A fucking long-suffering

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
people that

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
wandered the fucking desert

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
and were slaves.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Like fucking, yeah.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
The secret? What do you think the fucking secret is?

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
It's a fucking juice.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Why does that translate into good pizza?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
You fucking eat the pizza. You eat the pain.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
You eat every

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
every nugget of it.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
It's a fucking...

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
I love that. Tony loves juice.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
I love...

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Look, whatever you guys are saying,

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
you fucking racist and you're bad people,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
everything below

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
103rd is

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
racist.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Everything above

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
104th is

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
misogynist. Anthony? Everything

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
to the left of A Street

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
is racist. Anthony.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
So if you go,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
if you're below

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
104th on C

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
that's

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
absolute racism.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
That's Nazi Germany.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
But they're good people, they're New Yorkers.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Those are the Nazis

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
and they're German,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
but they're New Yorkers.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
And they know how to make a good pizza.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Because they love, because they know

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
you gotta eat

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
the Hebrew God.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
You go to the left, am I losing you?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Take the A train down to the L Street.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Go, get off.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Get off outside Tony Romano's.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Go up to...

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
My friend, go upstairs

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
to the thing. Everything's vertical.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Go to the bridge.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Keep walking.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Go out the door.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
There won't be a bridge there.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
You have to walk.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
There's air.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
You have to be confident enough to walk.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
The...

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
No, it's New York.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
You gotta walk.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
You gotta walk on air

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
if you're from New York.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
If you're not from New York,

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
you'll fall to your death.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
If you're from

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
104th up above there

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
and you're walking on air,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
get the best haircut

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
at Sammy

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Romano's

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
On 23rd

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
and A

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
on A

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Best haircut

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
is on A Street

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
and A Avenue.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
On the corner of A...

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
On the corner of A...

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
I'll go up two streets up.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Welcome to New York, motherfucker.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
A Street and A Avenue.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Dan, I'm sorry, Anthony.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
What about Brooklyn?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
What's your...

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Brooklyn's not New York.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
People say...

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I'm not going to win any popularity contest.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
I'm not here to

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
win

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
a popularity contest.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
I...

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Brooklyn's not New York.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Brooklyn's...

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Brooklyn's Staten Island.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
No, yeah.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
yeah, yeah.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
No, you know it.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
That's why you reacted that way

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
because you know what I'm saying is true.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Brooklyn is

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Staten Island.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
It's true.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Yeah, it's a true fact.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
I can say it

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
and yell at you and make it true.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Brooklyn is

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Staten Island.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Manhattan

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
is Brooklyn.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
From 1993

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
to 103rd Street,

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Manhattan's Brooklyn.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Queens

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
is Los Feliz

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
in Los Angeles.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Basically,

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
all of New York went to Los Angeles

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
after 1995.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Everybody in Queens

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
went to Los Angeles.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Queens is...

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Just get your pizza from a Jew.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Their dough is

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
chewy.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Because they're scared of God.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Who else

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
is scared of God

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
more than the Jews?

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
They make good pizza.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
You bite into it and they're like,

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
when they make the pizza, they're like,

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
I hope God don't kill me.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
And then you eat the pizza,

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
you're like, I hope God don't kill me.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
It's good.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
And put the pepperoni and the sugar dish.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
The sugar dish?

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Who makes the best sugar dish?

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Anthony.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Oh, Maron.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Excuse me for a second.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
What the fuck?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
I was going to ask you, who makes the best sugar dish?

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
I don't know who makes the best sugar dish.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
You go to the third, you go to Sally's.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
You go to Sally's.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Do you live?

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
And fourth B Street.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
The fourth B Street.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
There's four B Streets in Manhattan.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
The first is in Staten Island.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Don't go there.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
The third B Street?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Queens. That's New York.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
I think you said Queens was in Staten Island.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Queens and Houston.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
That's New York.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
As far as I know.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
That's the epicenter of New York.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
As far as I heard.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
That's where the Statue of Liberty is.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
That's what it used to be.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
That's New York.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
I don't think you're from New York at all.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
I lived here for a hundred million nine elevens.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
I lived here for a million nine elevens.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
I lived here for a million nine elevens.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
I was here.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
I lived here since nine ten.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
You piece of shit.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
You pussy.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
You fucking Los Angeles.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Fucking white collar piece of shit.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
I lived here since nine ten.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Where did you live?

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Probably below a hundred and third.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
I think you lost it.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
I'm sure you're fucking

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
muscle and pizza.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Why a hundred and fourth street?

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
You have a weird

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
context with a hundred and third.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Everybody below a hundred and third can go fuck themselves.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
That's most of the city.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
The bits.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
The bits old.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Am I right or am I wrong?

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
The bits old.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
You got your Staten Island bit.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
You got your Brooklyn bit.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
You keep doing the same bit.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
If I drew the bit, then what am I?

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
What am I? Queens?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
What am I? Brooklyn?

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
What do you do for a living?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
The bit is old.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Obviously I work for SpaceX.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
I work for Elon Musk.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
That's obvious.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
That's more interesting.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
No, I weld spaceship holes.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Really?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
I cold rivet you fucking racist.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I didn't.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I wasn't racist.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
I tell you what I do.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
I'll tell you everything you do.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
I do it above a hundred and third.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
I fuck it.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I do whatever you ask.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
If I go...

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Did something bad happen to you below a hundred and third?

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Nothing good ever happens to anybody below a hundred and third.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I already said the bit.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
I already said...

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
I have a joke.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Didn't I already say the bit was done?

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I think his dad touched him below a hundred and third.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
All right. Well, yeah.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
The bit's over.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
I killed it.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
My name...

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
My name's Anthony.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I'm from New York.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
It's a classic character.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
I'm like the church lady

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
or the broccoli book guy.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I'm Anthony

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
and I love New York.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
All right.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Anyways.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
How's your voice?

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
That voice is the best

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
for that character, actually.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
I took these guys to do karaoke

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
and their voices are fucked.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Let's all do karaoke

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
so I can lose my voice too, shall we?

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
You're cheering for just random things.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Don't...

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Okay.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
That's...

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
You're cheering for random things.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Okay.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
You're cheering for cheering.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Okay, wait a minute.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Okay, now you're cheering for cheering

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
for cheering for cheering.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
What the fuck, you guys?

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
It's like your whole city

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
has got a heart.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
All right.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
So this is my real voice.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
This is what I sound like.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Dino came up

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
with the solution of talking

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
in falsetto.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
So that's what I do.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Because if your throat is shredded,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
if you talk in falsetto,

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
it's not...

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
But you don't want two guys doing that?

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
No.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
But Dino's been talking in falsetto

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
for 24 hours.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
It's a fucking nightmare.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I can't get laid.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
It becomes funny.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Dino, last night

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
we talked about the fact that you had

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
procured a threesome for yourself.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
That's right.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Are you going to be a dominant person

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
in this threesome?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Yeah, I'm going to be dominant.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Okay.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Aren't you normally...

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Aren't you normally the bottom in a threesome?

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Well, I mean, it depends.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Sometimes I don't have the patience

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
to be submissive.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Tomorrow you have a threesome happening, right?

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
You're going to be the slave

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
or the master?

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
No, I'm going to be the master.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
How could you be the master with this voice?

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
How do you tell two women...

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Hey, you tell me.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
It's a nightmare.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
How does it work?

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Two women are going to come to your hotel room

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
or are you going to their place?

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Yeah.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
No, they're going to come to my hotel room.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
And when they walk in, you're going to...

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Hi, I'm Dino. Hello.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Take the pants off.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
It's going to be quite surprising.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
For one of them...

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
I think one of them is here tonight, actually.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Wait, for real?

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Yeah, but she doesn't want to be known.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Okay, let's pick a fake name for her.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Let's call her...

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Cinnamon?

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Cinnamon.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Does Cinnamon know the other girl?

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Yeah.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
She does.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Yeah, I don't think she likes her.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
But that's going to make it better.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Wait, so...

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
You're going to be the master

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
speaking like Mickey Mouse the whole time.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I don't believe it.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
It's not the perfect scenario.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Yeah, it's not, yeah.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Are you going to tell Cinnamon to do

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
things to the other girl?

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Oh, yeah.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Woo-hoo!

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Well, what could we impose

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
and ask for some foreshadowing?

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
What you would sound like?

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Well, in false telling Cinnamon

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
what to do.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I mean, I think you've been hearing it.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
It was like, you know, just...

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Whip! Whip Cinnamon!

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Wait, wait.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
I'm sorry, I didn't understand you.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
You want Cinnamon to be whipped by the other girl.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Yeah.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Okay.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Do you bring your own whips?

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
No, Cinnamon's bringing the whip.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Cinnamon brings her own whips.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
I bought her a whip.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
You bought her a whip.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
And she's going to bring it.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
She's going to get it whipped by it.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
It's the ultimate humiliation.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Oh, she will.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Won't you?

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Yup.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
You cunt!

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
See?

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
No.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Dina, when there's a threesome

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
happening where you're the master

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
and people are whipping each other,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
are you fucking them

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
or is this all about masturbating

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
after the fact?

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Well, it depends.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Sometimes I might be fucking one of them

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
when someone's being whipped.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
People think you're doing a bit.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
No, it's not a bit.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
The only thing funny about this

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
is my voice, really.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
I, you know...

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
It's erotic.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Draw the best case scenario

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
for tomorrow night.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
I don't want to.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
I don't want to ruin it for me.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
I don't want to, like, just tell them.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Can I try?

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Yeah.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
I had two women...

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
You go to 103rd Street.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Two women that agreed

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
to be at a threesome

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
with me. Yeah, with me.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Okay.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Wait, Dina, are you being Dina

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
or yourself?

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
What would you actually ask for?

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Huh?

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Pick your...

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Do your favorite threesome

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
where you have two girls

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
that one hates the other girl

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
coming to your hotel.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
No, I don't want to.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Okay, so hate each other.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Two girls are coming to your place tonight.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
You're a recently single gentleman.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
You've got the money.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
You've got the wherewithal.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
You're staying at a nice hotel.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
You're staying...

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
You're staying at the Bowery Room 503, everybody.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
That's a fucking...

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
In this fantasy scenario,

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
you're saying I have, like, white privilege?

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Well...

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Yeah, Dan, suspend

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
your own disbelief and

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
imagine you have white privilege.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Just for the sake of this...

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
White privilege?

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Huh.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
I guess I run

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
all business

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
and control people's

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
thought, marginalizing

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
their opinions.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Oh, sorry, sexually.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
I got lost for a second.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
You are a person...

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Two women that you are attracted to

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
are coming to your place.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Both of these people, these two women,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
do not know each other.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
So, Dan...

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Set the scene.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Fade in on...

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
What do we fade in on this fantasy?

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
I want to answer this honestly, I do.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Fade in.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
And believe me, as you probably can already tell,

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
I'm not going to try to win any popularity contests.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Like, I want to actually answer this honestly.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
By the way, this whole scene takes place

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
by the way.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Any interesting equal time?

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
After I answer this question, I want to bring one

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
female up and I want her to answer

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
what would you do with two dudes?

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Just anybody that has big...

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Do you think that's fair?

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
I think we should bring up so many women on stage

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
that we have the world's worst five-some of all time.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
By the way, it might be hard to believe,

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
but I would be with two dudes.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
No, it's not about that.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Do you know...

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Would you rather be with two women tonight

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
or would you rather be with two men tonight?

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Well, it depends who they were.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Yeah?

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
So it could be two guys.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
It could be two guys.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Now if it was two guys, do you want to be a master

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
or do you want to be a slave when two guys come over?

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
I'm not sure.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
I really am not sure.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
I mean, I'd have to meet them, we'd have to talk.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Not too much.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Why don't we just use this show as an American Idol

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
and we just keep bringing men and women on stage

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
until Dino evaporates?

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Wait, did we ever up something?

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Were you going to start something?

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
We fade in on Denham and Threesome.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
We take you to the Barry Hotel room 503.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
First of all, what are you wearing?

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
What am I wearing?

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Dino, are you wearing your fishing underwear?

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
I'm not.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Dino passed out last time in New York

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
with his pants around his waist

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
and he had high concept fishing underwear on.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Are you wearing those?

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
No, I'm not wearing them tonight.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
No?

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
We fade in on Denham and Threesome.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Can we lower the lights?

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Perfect.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Can we do one drop spot on Denham?

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Can we just drop spot?

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Okay.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
He looks good.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
I knew a man bowed jangles

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
and he danced for...

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Okay, I'm trying.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
First of all, my first answer is

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
I'm so insecure sexually

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
that I can't, honestly,

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
the idea of a threesome, I can't.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
I'd be like, I'm outnumbered by the people

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
that would judge me.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
That's my first answer.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Fade in.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
I'm trying to get beyond that.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Den, you promised last night

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
that you would verify whether or not

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
the girl you jerked off to in the commercial

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
was of age or not.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
I looked her up and then I got distracted.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
I fell asleep.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Tomorrow night.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Den, so...

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Page 1, fade in on you

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
or somebody else.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
What's the fade in?

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
I want to be honest.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
I want to do this right.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Just leave her alone.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Let me do it.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Do you know how you sing dance to chicken shit?

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
No, I'm saying that...

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
No, I'm trying to think.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
You're pushing him too hard.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Just let him think. Give him some time.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Page 1, let me think.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
I'm trying to think.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Take your time.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
I love you, Jeff, but you're pushing him.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
I love you, Dina.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
I'm going to fuck you so hard.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Actually, Jeff and I are going to fuck

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
behind him right now.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
My perfect threesome.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
By Dan Harmon.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
There's a woman.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Yeah, I went there.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Where...

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
And...

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
She...

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
I want to get this right.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
She's...

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
She works...

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
She works...

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
She works at a library, for sure.

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
She's a library. I guess you could call her a librarian.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
So that's how the story starts.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
I walk into a library.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
And I say...

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
I'm...

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Not smart.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
And she has glasses.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Red hair.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
And blouse.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
But...

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Well, Batgirl...

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Don't yell stuff out, sir.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
It's not that kind of show.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Okay, it's Batgirl. You're right.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
It's Batgirl.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
It's Batgirl.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
But...

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Batgirl works at Barbara Gordon.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Barbara Gordon in a world where

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
mesh tops are in style.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
But not slutty.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Like...

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Like the shoulders.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Like, do you know those tops that are like

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
nylon on the shoulders?

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
But then there's like tasteful.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
It's tasteful.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
I don't know if that's a library.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
It doesn't matter. This is my world.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
But it's like...

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
I want you guys to understand it's tasteful.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Like, this is not a person that's to be

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
disrespected.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
This is a person with a lot of power.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
An agency.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
I'm not saying that to impress you.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
It's what I jerk off to.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
I want...

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
I want... I jerk off to women with agency.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Thank you.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
You're welcome.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Dan, remember.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
This is leading towards...

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
This is leading towards your threesome.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Right. No, Jeff, please.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
I'm in the middle of something.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
I really know this is a fantasy

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
because Dan said

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
she's not...

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
he's not smarter than her.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
You know, she's smarter than me.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Yeah.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Yeah, she's smarter than me.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Yeah, that's what makes it a fantasy.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
That's...

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
misogynist.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
But also, I want to...

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
we're not going into a world

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
where I'm trying to impress you.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
So...

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
I'm not bullying him.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
You guys can do whatever you want.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
So you walk in...

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
We have some guests tonight.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
We should probably bring up...

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Some of them...

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Should we bring our guests out?

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
And the guests play one of the girls

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
in this fantasy? Yes.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Okay, yes. Let's welcome Scott...

33:50.000 --> 34:00.000
Scott Asif.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
You know him...

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
as Pete Harnberger

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
on 30 Rock.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
So Dan,

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
the music is still playing.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Scott playing girl, back girl,

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
but librarian number one.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Can you hear any of that?

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
The second girl that comes into the scene.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Grounded.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Grounded, long-form improv.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Can you be a redhead,

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
bespectacled,

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
meh-top,

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
librarian,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
beautiful woman?

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
She's redhead? Yeah.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Okay, yeah.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
All right.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
So I...

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
I...

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
So...

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Let's fade back in.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
She's redhead...

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Scott is redhead, back girl, librarian.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Okay, a fade in.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
So I'm coming in.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
I'm already here.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Okay, yeah, you're a librarian.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
You've been there since 9 a.m.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Okay, I'm coming in.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
Jingle-ing-ding, jingle-ing-ding, jingle-ing-ding.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Hello.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Hi.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
I'm Anagirth.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
I'm sorry.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
I didn't understand what you said.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
My name is Anagirth.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Your name is...

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Anagirth?

35:38.000 --> 35:42.000
It's just one word, Anagirth.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
That's your first name.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Okay, well...

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Hello. Do you like what I'm wearing?

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
I do.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
I think it's tasteful.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
I do.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
I do.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
What would you like me to call you?

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Daniel.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Daniel?

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
I like that. It's sexy.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
It's Hebrew.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
That's what I said.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
I brought a book back.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
It's late.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I bought a book back, and it's late.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Oh.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
It's very late.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
It's really late.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
I know I'm smiling, but I feel bad.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
The library closes in five minutes.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Five minutes, ladies and gentlemen.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Five minutes. Keep it tasteful.

37:10.000 --> 37:14.000
Well, I guess you need some kind of reprimand.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Well, I...

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Do you...

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
Are you consulting me?

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Are you asking me or telling me?

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
I'm telling you.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
That I need a reprimand?

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Really?

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
For real?

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
For me?

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Well...

37:36.000 --> 37:40.000
I'm not going to argue with you.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
I...

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Oh, are you hitting me?

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Are you hitting me?

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Are you hitting me?

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
My library closes in one minute.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
One minute.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
By the way, I don't like that.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
All right, so that's not the scenario you like.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
No, it's not.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
When you're being punished.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
No, I don't want to be hit.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
I need to find some other punishments.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
I've got hit by people that were...

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Okay.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
I'm starting to understand.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
It's a shades of things.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
We're going...

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
So it's not.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
It's about what I don't want.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Is that the idea?

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
I'm in a girth.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
What are you doing here?

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Who's this?

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
I'm the library closer.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
She's much superior.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Okay.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
She works beneath me.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
And when I say she works beneath me,

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
I mean, she works on top of me.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
We don't like to think of it as work, though.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
You guys both...

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Are you Hebrew?

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
My name, my name is Hebrew.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
We're gonna...

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Five minutes later, back at a hotel room.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
What?

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
All right. Fine.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Fine.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
But that's a turnoff.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
It's a turnoff.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
It's a big time jump. We're now in the middle of a scene.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Can we rewind?

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
No, no. We're in the hotel room now.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
It's my professional.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
We're in the middle of the scene. Ready?

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Here we go.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
I can't believe we got to the hotel in five minutes.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
That was Saturday night.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
That was light traffic.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Don't ruin the fantasy.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
I know.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Now...

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Daniel's in the bathroom right now.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Should we work up at number two

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
or at number six?

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
What's the scenario you want to do?

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
I don't think his heart could take a number six.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Really?

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
He's...

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
I mean...

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
He looks like an old prospector.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
What's your suggestion then?

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
I say we go easy.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
We make him feel loved.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
I mean, I don't...

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Make him feel loved.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Well, I tried punishing him. He didn't like it.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Okay.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
I think we're gonna...

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
We're gonna...

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
I'm punishing him. He didn't like it.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
I think what he's looking for

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
is someone to actually respect him and love him.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Okay.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
I'm gonna go outside the hotel room.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
I'll knock when you're ready.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Okay.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
All right.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Okay.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Okay.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Okay.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Okay.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Okay.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Okay.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Okay.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Okay.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Okay.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Ladies...

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
I'm here.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Okay.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Okay.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Okay.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Okay.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Okay.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Okay.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Okay.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Okay.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Okay.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
I can smell it.

41:14.000 --> 41:18.000
It's one of the most manly musks I've ever smelt.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
I know that...

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
you don't mean that.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
So

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
you seem very

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
lovable and

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
sweet.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
It seems like you're lying.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
You seem intelligent and successful.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Okay.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
To sprayed.

41:38.000 --> 41:45.000
recently divorced. Ding dong. That's the hotel doorbell. Hello. I'm from NBC. You're hired. I'm a

41:57.320 --> 42:03.320
sexy redhead and you're hired at NBC. Well that's not my fantasy either. I don't like being whipped

42:03.320 --> 42:09.320
or being hired by NBC. You guys think that you know it. I'm sorry, I have the wrong room. You

42:13.700 --> 42:19.700
have my apartment. You're topping from the bottom right now. Isn't that my job? No, you should

42:19.700 --> 42:26.700
just be like, are you me or are you you? I'm me. Ding dong. Ding dong. Who is that? Hello. I am a

42:26.700 --> 42:32.700
girl that you can endow me with any property if you want. Oh, you're made of fiberglass. I'm a, oh,

42:32.700 --> 42:42.700
you turn into Kim Cattrell when no one's looking. Yeah. Yeah. I'm a girl that you can endow me

42:42.700 --> 43:00.700
with any property if you want. I'm a girl that you can endow me with any property if you want. I'm a

43:00.700 --> 43:10.700
girl that neither you can endow me with a property if you want to endow me with a property

43:10.700 --> 43:17.700
No, Daniel. Hebrew Daniel. There's no reason to be insecure. This is your fantasy. You get to do

43:19.040 --> 43:24.040
whatever you want. To Scott Asset and Jeff Davis right now.

43:24.040 --> 43:31.040
Okay, okay, okay, okay. I love, I like both of you, but I don't know, well, I don't know who

43:31.040 --> 43:38.040
she is. You're, I've seen you in the Wendy's commercials. I'm the redhead from the McDonald's

43:38.040 --> 43:56.040
commercials. I'm the aerobic instructor from Knight Rider. It's your fantasy, Dan. This is your fantasy. Make it weird. You're

44:09.040 --> 44:16.040
the Wendy's girl. And you're the Time Warner girl. I'm Time Warner? Yes. So let's now cut to the

44:17.300 --> 44:24.300
middle of the action. So I guess I'm really doing this for my daughter. She has autism and I just

44:24.300 --> 44:31.300
can't afford it with a regular job. I work at the library and that just doesn't pay enough.

44:31.300 --> 44:38.300
The bills are paying up and I've got two ex-humans. They take it all away from me. I'm going to die. I'm going to die alone. You're really wasting my Time Warner down here.

44:38.300 --> 44:41.140
work at the library and that just doesn't pay enough.

44:41.140 --> 44:44.460
And the bills, the bills are paying up

44:44.460 --> 44:45.900
and I've got two ex-humans.

44:45.900 --> 44:48.740
They're taking it all away from me.

44:48.740 --> 44:53.740
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die alone, I'm gonna die alone.

44:56.540 --> 44:59.300
You're really wasting my time warner down here, I was like.

44:59.300 --> 45:04.300
I'm gonna die alone, I'm purposely miming my dick bigger

45:04.300 --> 45:09.300
than it is, it's so small, I'm gonna die alone.

45:11.380 --> 45:14.700
Dan, this is your fantasy.

45:14.700 --> 45:15.540
All right, all right, all right.

45:15.540 --> 45:16.500
You can do whatever you want.

45:16.500 --> 45:17.540
Right, well, yeah.

45:17.540 --> 45:18.860
Get, get specificer.

45:18.860 --> 45:19.700
Okay.

45:19.700 --> 45:21.820
All right.

45:23.540 --> 45:24.380
Minecraft it.

45:26.460 --> 45:31.460
Both of you are interested in Minecraft.

45:31.460 --> 45:36.460
Oh my God, is that a weird cube in front of you?

45:38.620 --> 45:41.580
Walk up to it and see if that book opens

45:41.580 --> 45:43.220
or if it closes when you walk away from it.

45:43.220 --> 45:44.300
It does all of the above.

45:44.300 --> 45:46.100
Why, why does the book open?

45:46.100 --> 45:49.180
Because I'm smart, but what's in the book?

45:49.180 --> 45:51.820
Do you have an inventory of all the things in the book?

45:51.820 --> 45:52.660
I got, I got.

45:52.660 --> 45:55.060
Oh my God, I'm gonna score it all over your face.

45:55.060 --> 45:59.940
Do you, do you like Minecraft?

45:59.940 --> 46:02.940
I didn't hear you say it.

46:05.460 --> 46:06.500
I'm a librarian.

46:06.500 --> 46:08.660
I don't know anything about Minecraft.

46:08.660 --> 46:11.340
10 minutes later, it's me and, what's your name?

46:11.340 --> 46:13.060
Am I in the girth?

46:13.060 --> 46:15.220
Anagirth, Anagirth.

46:15.220 --> 46:17.540
She and I are in the, and Powder Anagirth knows.

46:19.100 --> 46:21.700
I don't think this guy knows what fantasies mean.

46:21.700 --> 46:26.580
We offered him anything he chose

46:26.580 --> 46:29.860
and he wants us to watch him play video games.

46:29.860 --> 46:31.380
He has no imagination.

46:31.380 --> 46:33.340
I know, and you think it's weird.

46:33.340 --> 46:35.100
He's a creator of TV shows.

46:35.100 --> 46:36.540
What did he create?

46:36.540 --> 46:39.380
Some, some canceled show on NBC, I don't know.

46:40.860 --> 46:43.660
But the thing is like, he's got lots of money.

46:43.660 --> 46:45.620
He could do anything he wanted right now.

46:45.620 --> 46:50.620
I think, I think our services are being wasted on, on this guy.

46:50.620 --> 46:51.900
Well, you must have a fantasy.

46:51.900 --> 46:53.140
Why don't we just spend it on him?

46:53.140 --> 46:54.460
Five minutes later.

46:54.460 --> 46:59.460
You guys, you guys, you guys take big shits.

47:03.820 --> 47:06.620
Oh, Judd Appetown.

47:06.620 --> 47:08.260
Whoa.

47:08.260 --> 47:09.260
And scene.

47:09.260 --> 47:10.100
And scene.

47:12.140 --> 47:13.140
Scott, that's it.

47:16.900 --> 47:19.100
That's called Improv Olympic Train.

47:19.100 --> 47:23.300
I want, I want, I want to thank you guys

47:23.300 --> 47:27.180
from saving me from a night of a horrible threesome.

47:27.180 --> 47:28.260
Never gonna have a threesome.

47:28.260 --> 47:30.100
Yeah, don't have a threesome.

47:30.100 --> 47:33.260
Well, because honestly, we'll talk about this for one second

47:33.260 --> 47:36.860
because everybody in the audience fantasizes

47:36.860 --> 47:41.860
about polyamorous adventures.

47:44.180 --> 47:47.540
And like, there's no, like, like, like, like, like.

47:47.540 --> 47:48.700
Can I just say this is like a fantasy?

47:48.700 --> 47:51.140
This is like Grover talking to Daniel Tiger.

47:53.420 --> 47:56.540
Tell us, tell us things that make us happy

47:56.540 --> 47:59.300
because most of the people here tonight are like,

47:59.300 --> 48:04.300
yeah, I think about the idea of like a double harmonica.

48:04.700 --> 48:09.700
Like, on my wiener, like two ladies going like,

48:11.660 --> 48:13.140
it's like a harmonica.

48:15.380 --> 48:17.820
I can't even figure out which of us are we.

48:17.820 --> 48:20.620
Should we suck it or are we kissing?

48:20.620 --> 48:21.860
Ladies, I don't know.

48:21.860 --> 48:24.820
Dan, enjoy your confusion.

48:24.820 --> 48:25.660
Harmon.

48:25.660 --> 48:27.100
What are you doing down there?

48:27.100 --> 48:29.980
Oh, they're so quixotic.

48:29.980 --> 48:32.660
Dan, have you ever had a threesome?

48:32.660 --> 48:33.940
No, no, never.

48:33.940 --> 48:35.420
I haven't, no.

48:35.420 --> 48:37.380
It sounds like you've never had a blow job.

48:37.380 --> 48:49.380
Have you ever had a twosome?

48:49.380 --> 48:52.540
But when I hear from people who have had threesomes,

48:52.540 --> 48:53.660
they're kind of a nightmare.

48:53.660 --> 48:55.140
That they're high maintenance.

48:55.140 --> 49:00.140
Yeah, well, I mean, really all you need is one human being

49:00.300 --> 49:04.700
on your vagina or on your dick.

49:04.700 --> 49:06.820
Really, that's all you need.

49:06.820 --> 49:07.660
Right.

49:07.660 --> 49:09.980
And yet you've set one up for this trip.

49:09.980 --> 49:13.220
Well, yeah, because you just, what did you throw off me?

49:13.220 --> 49:14.220
A piece of you.

49:14.220 --> 49:18.380
Scott, have you ever had a threesome?

49:18.380 --> 49:19.220
I've not.

49:19.220 --> 49:20.060
Never?

49:20.060 --> 49:20.900
No.

49:20.900 --> 49:22.420
It's difficult because, you know,

49:22.420 --> 49:24.540
there's egos involved a lot, you know?

49:24.540 --> 49:25.380
Yeah, it's definitely.

49:25.380 --> 49:27.380
You're primates, you're not supposed to.

49:27.380 --> 49:30.980
Yeah, once somebody is usually like,

49:30.980 --> 49:32.380
jealous or something, not me.

49:32.380 --> 49:35.620
I mean, the women just fuck each other and I go to sleep.

49:35.620 --> 49:40.620
I've once been woken up with laughter

49:40.780 --> 49:42.620
because I was snoring during a threesome.

49:42.620 --> 49:45.280
I swear to God.

49:46.780 --> 49:47.620
Yeah.

49:47.620 --> 49:48.460
You've ordered the threesome.

49:48.460 --> 49:49.300
They're kind of boring.

49:49.300 --> 49:50.140
Just so you can get to sleep.

49:50.140 --> 49:50.980
They're kind of boring.

49:50.980 --> 49:51.820
They're a good hour.

49:51.820 --> 49:52.660
They're kind of boring.

49:52.660 --> 49:54.860
So everyone that's terrified of having a threesome

49:54.860 --> 49:56.940
is technically a hero.

49:56.940 --> 49:58.020
Well, yeah, I don't know.

49:58.020 --> 49:58.860
I don't think so.

49:58.860 --> 49:59.700
I think they're-

49:59.700 --> 50:00.540
Okay, well, that's what I heard.

50:00.540 --> 50:02.220
That's what I heard.

50:02.220 --> 50:04.260
Jeff, have you had a threesome?

50:04.260 --> 50:05.100
Many.

50:05.100 --> 50:05.940
Come on.

50:05.940 --> 50:08.620
Every one of his threesome's are gonna be amazing.

50:08.620 --> 50:10.420
But it was a nightmare, right?

50:10.420 --> 50:11.460
No, fuck.

50:11.460 --> 50:12.300
He's got-

50:12.300 --> 50:15.940
No, he never tells a bad story about himself, by the way.

50:15.940 --> 50:18.940
Epper, fucking pisses me off.

50:20.620 --> 50:21.460
Oh shit.

50:22.460 --> 50:23.780
I would say-

50:23.780 --> 50:28.420
We once around the room and told shitty stories

50:28.420 --> 50:31.340
about ourselves and Jeff told this shitty story

50:31.340 --> 50:32.900
that I didn't.

50:32.900 --> 50:35.700
Oh wait, no, everyone is blubbing me.

50:35.700 --> 50:37.500
That's not true.

50:37.500 --> 50:39.100
That is exactly true.

50:40.020 --> 50:43.940
I had two bad threesome's, where-

50:43.940 --> 50:44.780
Can I-

50:44.780 --> 50:47.020
Wait, can we stop pulling out alcohol?

50:47.020 --> 50:48.540
No, no, no, no, no, we can't.

50:48.540 --> 50:51.140
Can I do, can I, before you tell your story-

50:51.140 --> 50:51.980
Okay.

50:51.980 --> 50:53.620
Can I do my impression of what I predict

50:53.620 --> 50:55.180
your threesome's story would be?

50:55.180 --> 50:58.420
Oh my God, it's coming over here.

50:58.420 --> 51:03.180
Based on, based on what Jeff Davis' story is about,

51:03.180 --> 51:06.340
I believe that your story will go something like this.

51:06.340 --> 51:08.420
Scott, get ready to fill in as-

51:08.420 --> 51:11.180
I was at a place,

51:12.420 --> 51:13.820
and I was just hanging out.

51:13.820 --> 51:16.380
And I was reading Moby Dick.

51:16.380 --> 51:20.780
So far, you're right on target.

51:21.780 --> 51:22.940
I was just reading it,

51:22.940 --> 51:25.260
because I think it's interesting.

51:25.260 --> 51:28.060
I wasn't reading it, because it's a classic.

51:28.060 --> 51:30.260
I didn't even know what a classic is.

51:32.260 --> 51:36.260
And the first of two women came up to me and said,

51:37.260 --> 51:39.260
what are you doing?

51:39.260 --> 51:40.260
What are you doing?

51:41.260 --> 51:43.260
And I said, Moby Dick.

51:43.260 --> 51:47.260
And she said, thank you.

51:47.260 --> 51:54.260
So, thank you.

51:55.260 --> 51:58.260
And then her sister came up.

51:58.260 --> 52:00.260
I said, what's going on?

52:00.260 --> 52:03.260
And she said, this guy's reading Moby Dick.

52:03.260 --> 52:05.260
And she's like, why?

52:05.260 --> 52:07.260
And I explained Moby Dick to her.

52:07.260 --> 52:10.260
And when I finished, she went, thank you.

52:11.260 --> 52:13.260
And then we went back.

52:13.260 --> 52:17.260
I'm sorry, I was spilling it.

52:17.260 --> 52:20.260
I was spilling it anyway.

52:23.260 --> 52:25.260
Blood magic.

52:27.260 --> 52:31.260
There isn't a show after us tonight.

52:32.260 --> 52:36.260
And then we had sex and they both said, thank you.

52:39.260 --> 52:41.260
What was your story?

52:41.260 --> 52:44.260
Well, now he's going to lie.

52:45.260 --> 52:47.260
In a threesome.

52:47.260 --> 52:50.260
Dina, you've had more threesome than I've had for certain.

52:50.260 --> 52:53.260
Because you're a purveyor of weird threesome.

52:53.260 --> 52:55.260
Yeah, I'm very insecure.

52:56.260 --> 52:59.260
Usually there's somebody that says, let's have a threesome.

52:59.260 --> 53:03.260
And that person is the one that gets bummed out at the end of it.

53:03.260 --> 53:07.260
Because they didn't get all the attention they wanted.

53:07.260 --> 53:12.260
And I was like, you can just be there. I didn't want anything out of this except

53:12.260 --> 53:15.260
you got bummed out during the threesome.

53:15.260 --> 53:16.260
Right?

53:16.260 --> 53:18.260
Yeah, it's usually one of the women.

53:20.260 --> 53:23.260
Yeah, because they outnumber you two to one, statistically.

53:23.260 --> 53:27.260
Well, yeah, I already gave up from the beginning.

53:27.260 --> 53:29.260
I'm like, I'm just going to sit this one out.

53:29.260 --> 53:32.260
By the way, is there anybody, because it's New York, who knows.

53:32.260 --> 53:36.260
Is there anybody that's had an awesome threesome that also wants to talk about it?

53:36.260 --> 53:37.260
With Jeff?

53:37.260 --> 53:39.260
I see a handle.

53:39.260 --> 53:41.260
Who here had a threesome with me?

53:41.260 --> 53:43.260
Well, I see a guy pointing at his friend.

53:43.260 --> 53:45.260
Which means that you were a purveyor.

53:45.260 --> 53:48.260
Can we get a bearded guy with a wristband on him?

53:48.260 --> 53:50.260
Do you want to talk about it?

53:50.260 --> 53:52.260
Your friend wants you to talk about it.

53:52.260 --> 53:53.260
Do you want to talk about it?

53:53.260 --> 53:54.260
He's got a good beard.

53:54.260 --> 53:55.260
Just bring him up.

53:56.260 --> 53:58.260
Also, Jane's raising her hand.

53:58.260 --> 54:00.260
We'll get to you, Jane.

54:00.260 --> 54:05.260
Uh, yeah, I just, yeah, I guess it feels...

54:08.260 --> 54:10.260
There's your mic!

54:11.260 --> 54:12.260
Hello.

54:12.260 --> 54:14.260
What's your name, sir?

54:14.260 --> 54:16.260
Hi, I'm Arshan.

54:16.260 --> 54:17.260
Arshan?

54:17.260 --> 54:18.260
Arshan.

54:18.260 --> 54:19.260
Arshan.

54:19.260 --> 54:20.260
Yeah.

54:20.260 --> 54:21.260
You got a nice ass.

54:21.260 --> 54:22.260
ARSH.

54:22.260 --> 54:23.260
ARSH.

54:23.260 --> 54:24.260
Thank you.

54:24.260 --> 54:26.260
How many threesome's have you had, Arshan?

54:26.260 --> 54:28.260
Two.

54:28.260 --> 54:29.260
Two.

54:29.260 --> 54:31.260
How many were successful out of those two?

54:31.260 --> 54:32.260
One or neither?

54:32.260 --> 54:33.260
They were both successful.

54:33.260 --> 54:34.260
They were?

54:34.260 --> 54:35.260
Yeah.

54:35.260 --> 54:37.260
Nobody got bummed out during the middle of it?

54:37.260 --> 54:38.260
Um, no.

54:38.260 --> 54:40.260
No one got bummed out.

54:40.260 --> 54:41.260
What's your secret, Arshan?

54:41.260 --> 54:44.260
What's the secret to successful threesome's?

54:44.260 --> 54:45.260
Um...

54:47.260 --> 54:49.260
That's not lying, sir.

54:49.260 --> 54:50.260
He's a liar.

54:50.260 --> 54:52.260
That's not nice.

54:52.260 --> 54:56.260
I've had a girlfriend for eight years, and we are an open relationship.

54:56.260 --> 54:57.260
And...

54:57.260 --> 54:58.260
The whole time?

54:58.260 --> 55:01.260
We have an open relationship.

55:01.260 --> 55:04.260
So, there's girls and guys and...

55:04.260 --> 55:05.260
Coming in and out.

55:05.260 --> 55:06.260
Yeah.

55:06.260 --> 55:07.260
Coming in hot.

55:07.260 --> 55:10.260
Now, Arshan, are you into only women?

55:10.260 --> 55:11.260
Or bi?

55:11.260 --> 55:12.260
Which is...

55:12.260 --> 55:16.260
Um, so our openness is only with other girls.

55:16.260 --> 55:17.260
Only women.

55:17.260 --> 55:18.260
Yeah.

55:18.260 --> 55:20.260
You selfish piece of shit.

55:20.260 --> 55:22.260
If you're gonna be...

55:22.260 --> 55:24.260
If you're gonna be open minded...

55:24.260 --> 55:27.260
That's the best kind of open minded to be.

55:27.260 --> 55:28.260
All right.

55:28.260 --> 55:30.260
So I'm gonna make the rules.

55:30.260 --> 55:32.260
Arshan, take us to the best...

55:32.260 --> 55:34.260
Let's... let's homophobic bash him.

55:34.260 --> 55:35.260
Pick...

55:35.260 --> 55:38.260
Pick the best threesome of the two.

55:38.260 --> 55:40.260
And, uh, walk us through how the...

55:40.260 --> 55:41.260
The origin...

55:41.260 --> 55:42.260
From top to bottom.

55:42.260 --> 55:43.260
Yeah.

55:43.260 --> 55:44.260
Starting at Sizzler.

55:44.260 --> 55:46.260
All the way through.

55:46.260 --> 55:47.260
The best of the two.

55:47.260 --> 55:50.260
So, um, the...

55:50.260 --> 55:56.260
My girlfriend, uh, had met the other girl on a dating app, Tinder.

55:56.260 --> 55:57.260
And...

55:57.260 --> 55:58.260
Not cliche.

55:58.260 --> 55:59.260
Dating app.

55:59.260 --> 56:02.260
So she was like, hey, let's...

56:02.260 --> 56:06.260
So she's dating you, but she's also on a dating app?

56:06.260 --> 56:07.260
Yeah.

56:07.260 --> 56:08.260
We both are on all of them.

56:08.260 --> 56:10.260
That's how good you are in bed.

56:10.260 --> 56:11.260
She's online.

56:11.260 --> 56:12.260
Or...

56:12.260 --> 56:16.260
I can't say I'm good in bed, but she's where we...

56:16.260 --> 56:17.260
Yeah.

56:17.260 --> 56:18.260
Okay.

56:18.260 --> 56:19.260
Maybe I...

56:19.260 --> 56:20.260
Yeah.

56:20.260 --> 56:21.260
I'm really good in bed.

56:21.260 --> 56:22.260
Yeah.

56:22.260 --> 56:23.260
That's exactly why.

56:23.260 --> 56:24.260
Um...

56:24.260 --> 56:25.260
I think he would be.

56:25.260 --> 56:26.260
Oh.

56:26.260 --> 56:27.260
Thank you.

56:27.260 --> 56:28.260
I don't need you to be.

56:28.260 --> 56:29.260
If you're...

56:29.260 --> 56:30.260
No.

56:30.260 --> 56:31.260
I mean, if you're a bad person.

56:31.260 --> 56:32.260
Dan, if I put a red...

56:32.260 --> 56:36.260
I assume you have a larger penis than me.

56:36.260 --> 56:38.260
Dan, if I put a red wig on him in the right size...

56:38.260 --> 56:39.260
Because of the fingerless gloves.

56:39.260 --> 56:40.260
I wouldn't...

56:40.260 --> 56:44.260
No one with a dick my size would ever wear fingerless gloves.

56:44.260 --> 56:45.260
Fingerless gloves?

56:45.260 --> 56:48.260
Because they go like, well, what am I trying to prove?

56:48.260 --> 56:49.260
The finger...

56:49.260 --> 56:50.260
I'd be like, no.

56:50.260 --> 56:51.260
The fingerless gloves.

56:51.260 --> 56:52.260
My fingers warm.

56:52.260 --> 56:54.260
Are you a very successful safe cracker?

56:54.260 --> 56:56.260
What's going on with it?

56:56.260 --> 56:59.260
Um...

56:59.260 --> 57:01.260
What's about to happen with these fingerless gloves?

57:01.260 --> 57:06.260
My hands are about to stay warmer, but I can crack a safe VD1.

57:06.260 --> 57:07.260
Right.

57:07.260 --> 57:08.260
Yeah.

57:08.260 --> 57:09.260
Or...

57:09.260 --> 57:10.260
Yeah.

57:10.260 --> 57:11.260
I got you.

57:11.260 --> 57:15.260
So the girlfriend says, Arshan, ring a ding ding, tender called.

57:15.260 --> 57:16.260
Yeah.

57:16.260 --> 57:17.260
Um...

57:17.260 --> 57:18.260
So...

57:18.260 --> 57:23.260
By the way, this guy bothered to come up here and is like vulnerable, so don't...

57:23.260 --> 57:25.260
Don't tease him.

57:25.260 --> 57:26.260
So...

57:26.260 --> 57:27.260
Asshole!

57:27.260 --> 57:35.260
A lot of text messages happen intermediately, but she has the same dog that we have, so

57:35.260 --> 57:38.260
it's a dog walking trip, and then...

57:38.260 --> 57:39.260
Yeah.

57:39.260 --> 57:41.260
Wait, what do you mean, yeah?

57:41.260 --> 57:42.260
So, yeah.

57:42.260 --> 57:44.260
Wait, we asked you...

57:44.260 --> 57:45.260
What?

57:45.260 --> 57:47.260
And then I fucked two women.

57:47.260 --> 57:48.260
I don't know.

57:48.260 --> 57:50.260
We asked you about a threesome.

57:50.260 --> 57:51.260
I was not agreeing.

57:51.260 --> 57:52.260
He was Thanksgiving.

57:52.260 --> 57:53.260
Two women fucked me.

57:53.260 --> 57:54.260
No!

57:54.260 --> 57:56.260
Tell us the story!

57:56.260 --> 58:01.260
You're a terrible person.

58:01.260 --> 58:03.260
Everyone that was bullying him...

58:03.260 --> 58:04.260
That's what I said!

58:04.260 --> 58:05.260
Bullying him.

58:05.260 --> 58:06.260
Okay, okay.

58:06.260 --> 58:07.260
Arshan.

58:07.260 --> 58:08.260
Scott, someone hold my hand.

58:08.260 --> 58:09.260
Arshan, hold it.

58:09.260 --> 58:10.260
Hold it.

58:10.260 --> 58:12.260
Hold it, Arshan.

58:12.260 --> 58:13.260
Arshan.

58:13.260 --> 58:17.260
Stay right where you are.

58:17.260 --> 58:18.260
Scott.

58:18.260 --> 58:20.260
Is this what?

58:20.260 --> 58:23.260
Look what he's doing.

58:23.260 --> 58:28.260
He's getting another threesome story.

58:28.260 --> 58:32.260
Scott, you're a professional improviser.

58:32.260 --> 58:35.260
I think we should just recreate that threesome.

58:35.260 --> 58:38.260
With all of Arshan's information, let's turn this right now.

58:38.260 --> 58:39.260
Perfect.

58:39.260 --> 58:40.260
Okay.

58:40.260 --> 58:41.260
Give us more, yeah.

58:41.260 --> 58:42.260
Yeah, yeah.

58:42.260 --> 58:43.260
Okay, so...

58:43.260 --> 58:47.260
I've been with my girlfriend for eight years.

58:47.260 --> 58:55.260
I moved to New York City from Maryland seven years ago.

58:55.260 --> 58:57.260
I grew up in Potomac.

58:57.260 --> 59:00.260
They just started a Real Housewives of Potomac this season.

59:00.260 --> 59:03.260
But that's not important.

59:03.260 --> 59:05.260
Arshan, sit down.

59:05.260 --> 59:06.260
We have enough information.

59:06.260 --> 59:07.260
No, come on.

59:07.260 --> 59:08.260
What are you doing?

59:08.260 --> 59:09.260
So I moved up here.

59:09.260 --> 59:10.260
Let him tell us.

59:10.260 --> 59:15.260
And then the first girlfriend I got, she went to NYU.

59:15.260 --> 59:18.260
She's very smart.

59:18.260 --> 59:21.260
You have to be to go to that school.

59:21.260 --> 59:22.260
Right?

59:22.260 --> 59:25.260
We dated for seven years.

59:25.260 --> 59:27.260
Share your face with the audience.

59:27.260 --> 59:28.260
And then...

59:28.260 --> 59:29.260
Good.

59:29.260 --> 59:30.260
We grew apart.

59:30.260 --> 59:31.260
We grew apart.

59:31.260 --> 59:36.260
And then once we grew apart, we got back together.

59:36.260 --> 59:42.260
And then it basically all became about just having fun.

59:42.260 --> 59:44.260
And what does fun mean?

59:44.260 --> 59:47.260
Fun means we date other people.

59:47.260 --> 59:50.260
So fun is not being with each other.

59:50.260 --> 59:51.260
Yeah.

59:51.260 --> 59:55.260
We now take it to Arshan's threesome.

59:55.260 --> 59:58.260
I want to hear the story.

59:58.260 --> 59:59.260
I want to hear more.

59:59.260 --> 01:00:01.260
Don't heckle him.

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:03.260
He's volunteering information.

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:04.260
So...

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:05.260
He might sing.

01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:06.260
Look at him.

01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:07.260
I'm like Seinfeld.

01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:09.260
When Kramer was racist and Cypher was like...

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:10.260
Stop.

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:11.260
Can we get Arshan?

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:12.260
It's not funny.

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:19.260
Can we get Arshan a special light?

01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:20.260
Perfect.

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:28.260
So they met on Tinder and they got along really well.

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:33.260
They were nice to each other.

01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:38.260
My girlfriend, she had just colored her hair red.

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:42.260
The girl she was with, her hair was actually red.

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:47.260
She was a redhead.

01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:50.260
She was like, hey, so when are you coming home tonight?

01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:53.260
I was like, I'll be home like 12, maybe 12, 15.

01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:55.260
I was like, okay, that's fine.

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:57.260
If you come a little later, it's cool.

01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.260
I'll be with you.

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:04.260
Let's just say her name is Quarter.

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:07.260
Sorry, what is her name?

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:09.260
Go back to that part.

01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:12.260
Use other delineations of change.

01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:15.260
Quarter, dime.

01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:19.260
I didn't say you're protecting the time from defamation.

01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:22.260
So you're saying her name is Penny, but you're going to call her Quarter.

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:23.260
Scott!

01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:25.260
Okay, okay, okay.

01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:27.260
The names have been changed.

01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.260
That's cool.

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:29.260
Apparently.

01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:33.260
Could you just call her Kennedy Head instead?

01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:35.260
Kennedy Head.

01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:37.260
Yes, that's fine.

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.260
I'll be home a little bit later.

01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:44.260
So I was out gallivanting with Ryan, who's over there.

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:51.260
Then I get home and, oh, so you and Penny are friends.

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:54.260
Come on, no, come on, come on.

01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:56.260
I'm protecting him.

01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:58.260
He's volunteering information.

01:01:58.260 --> 01:01:59.260
I'm sorry.

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:01.260
So I...

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:03.260
Stop, no, stop it.

01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:05.260
Stop, stop heckling.

01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:06.260
That's my whole story.

01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:09.260
So I walk into the apartment and they're having fun.

01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:10.260
What does fun mean?

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:12.260
I just joined in.

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:13.260
So their fun is being together.

01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:16.260
Your fun is not being with your girlfriend.

01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:17.260
That's not what I said.

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:21.260
That was my first introduction into this moment.

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:23.260
So the two of them were having fun.

01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:26.260
And then I come in and they're like, hey, join in.

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:27.260
It's over.

01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:28.260
Oh, okay.

01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:29.260
Okay, all right.

01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:32.260
So your girlfriend's name?

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:33.260
Emily.

01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:34.260
Emily.

01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.260
And the other girl?

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:36.260
Penny.

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:37.260
Quarter.

01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:38.260
Penny?

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:39.260
Penny.

01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:40.260
Penny.

01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:41.260
Emily and Penny.

01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:42.260
Emily and Penny.

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:43.260
All right.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.260
What was your name?

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:45.260
Arshan.

01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:46.260
Arshan.

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.260
Respect him.

01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:50.260
He asked for sexual permission and he came up and volunteered it.

01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:58.260
It's not that impressive of a story, but I feel like they shouldn't be that impressive,

01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:00.260
because threesomes should be normal.

01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:01.260
What year is this?

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:02.260
I don't know.

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:03.260
How many?

01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:04.260
All right.

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:05.260
Am I going to get beat up?

01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:06.260
Arshan?

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:07.260
What year is this?

01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:08.260
I don't know why it was awkward.

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:10.260
I think it's just happened all the time.

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:11.260
It was this year.

01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:12.260
It was this year.

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:13.260
It was this year.

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.260
It was this year.

01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:15.260
All right.

01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:16.260
We now take you to Arshan's first or second present.

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:17.260
Thank you, Arshan.

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:18.260
Thank you very much.

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:19.260
Thank you.

01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:20.260
Thank you.

01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:21.260
For your vulnerability and your honesty.

01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:22.260
Thank you.

01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:24.260
Who wants to play the role of Arshan right now?

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:25.260
I will be Arshan.

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:27.260
Scott adds it will play the role of Arshan.

01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:30.260
And that means Dan and Dino.

01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:33.260
I should not be in this.

01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:36.260
I definitely think you should be in this.

01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:39.260
Dan will play Emily and Dino will play Penny.

01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:41.260
I wasn't listening.

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:42.260
Okay.

01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:44.260
We hadn't actually gotten to your part yet.

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:46.260
I was so fucking bored.

01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:48.260
Dino, it was all preamble.

01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:51.260
There was no story yet.

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.260
It's 9-11.

01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:56.260
Thank you, New York.

01:03:56.260 --> 01:04:01.260
Fade in.

01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:02.260
Fade in.

01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:05.260
Tom Clancy presents.

01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:10.260
Prelude to a shit storm.

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:18.260
The year is 2075.

01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:24.260
For the radio audience, Jeff is doing a brilliant cigarette character bit.

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.260
Penny.

01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:28.260
Penny.

01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:30.260
Dino, you're Penny.

01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:32.260
I'm who?

01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:35.260
Oh, hi.

01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:36.260
Fake.

01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:37.260
Fake.

01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:38.260
Fake phone.

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:40.260
Fake phone.

01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:42.260
We both saw it.

01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:44.260
Scott adds it and I both said that was fake.

01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:46.260
Ten minutes later.

01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:50.260
Ten minutes later.

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:52.260
That's real.

01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:54.260
That's real.

01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:57.260
I wasn't listening to the story.

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:59.260
Penny.

01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:02.260
Penny, I know you're taking a shit.

01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:05.260
I feel bad about you falling down just now.

01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:07.260
Five minutes ago.

01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:11.260
But my boyfriend, or Sean, is coming over.

01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:12.260
What?

01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:18.260
Yes, I'm dating an Armenian.

01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:20.260
Even my best friends don't know that.

01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:25.260
But I'm telling you, Penny, that I'm dating an Armenian.

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:26.260
What are you talking about?

01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:30.260
I'm not an improviser.

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.260
Penny, it's okay.

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:32.260
Be in the moment.

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:35.260
Say yes and that's all that matters.

01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:38.260
Because we're going to have a threesome soon.

01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:42.260
I don't care that you weren't listening during our Sean's monologue.

01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:44.260
It doesn't matter.

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:46.260
Yeah, you're not allowed to.

01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:47.260
I'm sorry.

01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:49.260
I'm God.

01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:51.260
Oh, Penny.

01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:58.260
Ignorance isn't an excuse.

01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:00.260
Penny, the Lord has spoken.

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:01.260
The Lord has spoken.

01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:03.260
My Armenian boyfriend is coming over.

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:04.260
Okay.

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:05.260
He might be Syrian.

01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:06.260
I don't fucking know.

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:07.260
Okay.

01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:08.260
Dino.

01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:09.260
Dino.

01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:10.260
Yeah, what?

01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:11.260
This is the devil.

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:13.260
Fuck this scene up.

01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:15.260
Dino?

01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:17.260
Don't listen to the devil.

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:18.260
Say yes and.

01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:21.260
And don't ask questions and set the where.

01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:23.260
Dino, this is God.

01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:24.260
You're not in a scene.

01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:28.260
If you are, it's a bad scene.

01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:31.260
Dino, this is Emily.

01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:32.260
Stay in the moment.

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:36.260
Why are you calling me my name, but you're a character?

01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:37.260
You're Penny.

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:39.260
I'm only using this because you don't know where the fuck we are.

01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:40.260
You said Dino.

01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:41.260
Emily, I meant Penny.

01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:42.260
Dino.

01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:43.260
You're fucking Penny.

01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:46.260
Dino, you can win this scene.

01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:47.260
Dino.

01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:48.260
Dino.

01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:49.260
What?

01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:56.260
You can win this scene if you give the audience on your side, not on Jeff's.

01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:58.260
Dino, this is God.

01:06:58.260 --> 01:06:59.260
Hello.

01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:01.260
You can't win a scene.

01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:03.260
The only winner.

01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:04.260
Dino.

01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:05.260
Dino.

01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:06.260
Okay.

01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:07.260
Okay.

01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:08.260
Mission accomplished.

01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:09.260
Mission accomplished.

01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:10.260
Mission accomplished.

01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:11.260
Mission accomplished.

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:12.260
Mission accomplished.

01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:17.260
Mission accomplished.

01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:20.260
Dino, you have done well, my students.

01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:22.260
Listen to that crowd roar.

01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:23.260
I agree.

01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:24.260
I agree.

01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:27.260
Is it two hours yet?

01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:28.260
God in the devil.

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:30.260
Oh, I don't know how to improvise.

01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:31.260
I agree.

01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:32.260
Penny.

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:33.260
Penny.

01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:34.260
Penny.

01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:35.260
My boyfriend, Arshon, is coming over.

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:36.260
I thought that was the ender.

01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:37.260
Dino.

01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:38.260
This is God.

01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:39.260
You can't control.

01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:40.260
Lights down.

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:41.260
Lights down.

01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:45.260
Penny, I'm going to leave you alone for a moment while you have your own internal

01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:46.260
moment.

01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:49.260
If you guys ever improvise, it's a nightmare.

01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:51.260
It's the worst job ever.

01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:53.260
I love you, Dino.

01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:54.260
I love me too.

01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:56.260
That's why I want out of here.

01:07:56.260 --> 01:08:01.260
Get it over with.

01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:06.260
Come in.

01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:20.260
You can't tell me I did that wrong.

01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:23.260
My name is Mr. Johnson.

01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:24.260
Jen.

01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:25.260
What?

01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:26.260
I love you.

01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:27.260
We're friends, right?

01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:28.260
We were drinking all day.

01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:29.260
My name is Mr. Johnson.

01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:38.260
I know, but I like you.

01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:39.260
You're a nice guy.

01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:40.260
My name is Mr. Johnson.

01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:44.260
I know, but we're having fun on stage and people are laughing.

01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:45.260
It's great.

01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:47.260
My name is Mr. Johnson.

01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:52.260
I know we're having good time.

01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:58.260
Well, okay, so I brought you a package.

01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:05.260
What's in it?

01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:14.260
I'm glad you asked.

01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:24.260
I'll tell you.

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:39.260
A pair of socks.

01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:40.260
Okay.

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:41.260
I think.

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:42.260
I think.

01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:43.260
Come on.

01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:44.260
Let's end the show.

01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:56.260
No, no, I'll play along.

01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:57.260
I'll play along.

01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:59.260
I brought you a package.

01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:00.260
Okay.

01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:02.260
Did you set this up at all?

01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:04.260
The package has socks.

01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:07.260
Then I opened it.

01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:09.260
So what's in it?

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:10.260
Penny.

01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:13.260
Don't open that package.

01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:14.260
Am I Penny?

01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:15.260
You're Penny.

01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:16.260
I'm Emily.

01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:17.260
Okay.

01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:18.260
Hi.

01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:19.260
What?

01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:21.260
I shouldn't open it.

01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:24.260
Don't break the fourth wall and don't open that package.

01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:25.260
Okay.

01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:26.260
Am I going to open it?

01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:27.260
Okay.

01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:28.260
I'm going to go back on the bedroom.

01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:29.260
Okay.

01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:31.260
Also, let's never have a threesome no matter what happens.

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:33.260
Jeff, what's in the package?

01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:34.260
My name's Emily.

01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:35.260
I'm Emily.

01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:36.260
All right.

01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:37.260
Okay.

01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:41.260
I also don't want to have a threesome.

01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:59.260
I've been the UPS man or lady because honestly, yeah, UPS person.

01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:01.260
Now I get it.

01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:04.260
Enjoy your socks.

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:06.260
Thank you.

01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:14.260
You know, sometimes I think threesomes are good.

01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:16.260
Sometimes I think threesomes are bad.

01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:19.260
Hello, Penny.

01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:21.260
I'm your female roommate, Emily.

01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:22.260
Freeze.

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:28.260
New choice.

01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:29.260
Please tag me.

01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:30.260
Tag me.

01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:31.260
It's not freeze tag.

01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:32.260
It's new choice.

01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:33.260
Oh, new choice?

01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:35.260
I don't know that one.

01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:36.260
Just tag me.

01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:37.260
My boyfriend is coming in.

01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:38.260
His name is Arshan.

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:39.260
He's Armenian.

01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:40.260
New choice.

01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:42.260
My friend is Assyrian.

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:43.260
Right.

01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:49.260
He's all eyebrows and no cock.

01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:54.260
Some stereotypes are true.

01:11:54.260 --> 01:12:00.260
When he gets here, I want me to be the bottom.

01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:07.260
I want you to be the top and I want him to be the peanut butter in that sandwich.

01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:12.260
Now Dino's going to become a certain kind of character, like a cowboy or a pirate.

01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:18.260
So what kind of character should Dino be?

01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:19.260
Anybody?

01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:20.260
Anybody?

01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:21.260
What is it?

01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:22.260
Obsessive compulsive.

01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:23.260
Obsessive compulsive.

01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:24.260
Obsessive compulsive.

01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:25.260
Obsessive compulsive.

01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:26.260
Obsessive compulsive.

01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:27.260
Obsessive compulsive.

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:28.260
Obsessive compulsive.

01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:29.260
Obsessive compulsive.

01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:30.260
I could go.

01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:33.260
Yeah, yeah yeah.

01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:37.260
I'd say Arshan should be the peanut butter in the sandwich.

01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:38.260
What do you think?

01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:43.260
Hold on, I've got to turn the lights on and off about a thousand times.

01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:44.260
Freeze!

01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:51.260
Now Jeff is going to continue this in a different style like a western or a pirate movie.

01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:57.960
So what is Jeff going to do on the scene now?

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:04.960
I heard improv scene. Improv scene, go. Improv scene. Improv scene. No, you shouldn't.

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:18.120
Freeze! Okay, well we need now. Freeze, freeze, freeze. In this improv scene, the character

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:24.200
of Scott Adson is asking for suggestions. He is played by your favorite actor. Your favorite

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:31.200
actor. Liam Neeson. No, we go with the first suggestion. I heard Liam Neeson. Liam Neeson

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:41.560
is now running the improv scene. Liam Neeson. This is Liam Neeson playing an improv caller.

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:48.560
Okay, so this is what's going to happen. Okay, what we need, what we need is the last

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:55.560
line. Freeze, freeze, freeze. Your favorite period in history. Victorian, call an improv

01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:05.160
scene in the Victorian era. What we're going to do now, right away, is we're going to get

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:17.160
one last suggestion, which is a last line of dialogue. What wraps up that old scene and

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:24.120
keeps everybody on their cobblers? So, what's the last line of dialogue? I heard,

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:31.120
room, power, look out! That's the last line or first line? That's the last line of dialogue,

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:41.240
my cheeky. Arshon, I'm here with Penny, my friend. She's in the bathroom right now.

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:47.240
We're going to have the world's worst threesome. Who's we? You and me, Arshon. You're Arshon

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:54.080
now. And her? Yeah, Penny is in the bathroom. Follow me. You know I'm Armenian. I don't

01:14:54.080 --> 01:15:01.080
deserve this. Racially, racially. Freeze! I'm going to respond to something even more

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:08.080
racist. Who can think of something even more racist? Nigger! Nigger! Nigger! Nigger! Nigger!

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:16.080
Nigger! Nigger! Nigger! Nigger! Nigger! Nigger! And scene, scene, everybody. Thank you so

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:23.080
much. You see, improv isn't hard. Improv is easy. All you have to do is be a racist. Let's bring

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:30.080
up transgender Jay! You all ready to open your mind? You all thought you knew what gender

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:37.080
was? You're wrong. Transgender Jay! You all thought you knew what gender was? You're

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:44.080
wrong. Transgender Jay! This motherfucker doesn't give a shit about gender! If you don't know

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:14.080
what gender is, you probably do give a lot of shits about gender. Dignity. I bring some

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:21.760
dignity to the stage. Good luck. I hope. What are you talking about tonight? We said so

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:28.600
many things. I've cried eight times. I'll talk to you over the last two days. One of

01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:38.600
the reasons I cried is because... By the way, we are doing a downshift right now. We're going to

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:45.600
hike here, Jay. No, this is about to be the funniest. You downshift and you're going uphill.

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:53.600
Raise your expectations. Raise them. When a transgender person comes up and you talk

01:16:53.600 --> 01:17:00.600
about transgender, you should raise your expectations. Don't lower them. Raise them. This better

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:07.760
be the funniest part of the show. And if it's not, maybe we need to re-examine. What we

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:18.360
tolerate? We never have... I don't know. Let's talk about the tolerance for white

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:25.360
cis males. I'm so drugged. You guys have been running hard. Is one or more of your sons

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:39.200
here tonight? Is one of your kids here tonight? No, no, no children here tonight. Jane, threesomes,

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:44.720
have you had one or more? No children here, but they both listened to the podcast. Have

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:51.720
you had a threesome, Jane? I've had a threesome and a foursome in my life. We have a winner.

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:58.720
A foursome? Jane, were they all with yourself? Come on. Fuck you. Jane, the foursome. How

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:13.520
do you know when you're having a foursome? What was the lineup in the foursome? What was

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:19.520
the ratio of male female presenters? What did you have? Oh, God, that's complicated. Yeah.

01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:25.520
That's my point. What's the difference between a foursome and just a weird night at a hotel?

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:31.520
So I think... All of the others were... The Henderson's came over for Christmas. Yeah.

01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:37.520
And it was a foursome. That foursome, who were they? Or in terms of gender, specificity,

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:44.520
and what was the set up to that? Let's see, we had me, a genetic male presenting female

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:51.800
this pre-hormone. We had three then genetic females, two of whom are sort of... Two were

01:18:54.320 --> 01:19:00.320
bisexual, one was non-bisexual, where they exactly sit in terms of gender preference

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:07.320
and presentation. Two of them enjoyed doing drag kings, so they certainly had sort of

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:11.320
that sort of aspect. Drag kings. Drag kings. That's the thing. I love that. Oh, my God.

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:18.320
Drag kings, that's women who do parody male presentation. Yeah. But they weren't dragging

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:23.720
at the time that we were doing this, but it was just this level of complexity. Who's

01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:30.720
that guy? Oh, he's a peer provider. No, but... What are the things that we've talked about

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:37.800
a lot? What are you describing as Oprah's primordial soup of sexuality? Well, it was

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:42.200
a situation where four people really enjoyed each other and it really didn't matter what

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:49.200
parts they brought to the game. And so four people doing it, right? I think that happened

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:56.200
at some point. Yeah, it doesn't look bad. But yeah, there were some shaking parts, yes.

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:07.720
Was the foursome a successful event? Did everybody get what they wanted? Was it a good affair?

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:14.720
It was wonderful. It was beautiful and spiritual and it was fabulous. You always have to one

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:21.720
up me, don't you? Sorry. And yeah. Do you ever... Dan, pick your foursome. Who is it?

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:34.680
Like cast your foursome. Cast your own foursome. Okay. Karen Gillum from Dr. Hoot is just

01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:41.680
there, but she's not involved. She's directing. She's wearing jot purse and like a hat that

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:52.280
says director. If she takes off her clothes, she'll gain too much status. So she's there.

01:20:52.280 --> 01:21:06.040
She's watching through a glass booth. I'm... I love that guy. That guy's like, he's like,

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:13.040
fuck it, I want Karen Gillum to watch me fuck. She's behind glass bulletproof. Dan, for real,

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:23.040
like... What? For real. Let's get behind the facade of the guy who gets fired in the five weeks. I

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:29.040
want to know what turns you on in a foursome. I'm telling you. But you're fumfering. I'm

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:37.040
trying to figure it out. I'm fumfering. What did you say? I'm sorry to say. I'll pick three

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:53.040
people. That guy is a fascist. Guess what? I don't have to pick three people. You don't buy it

01:21:53.040 --> 01:22:01.040
for me. You're right to not buy that. Pick three genders. You only get three genders. Pick

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:06.040
three genders. He doesn't have to only three genders though. He can pick among three genders.

01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:12.040
They can be all one or they can be all three. Or agendered. But don't corner yourself out of

01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:18.040
this. I will say I want to bring this to a respectable place because you guys are being

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:26.040
bad people. So I want to be vulnerable and tell you. I had a dream recently. In my dream, I had a

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:36.040
very vivid sexual dream where my ex-girlfriend, ex-ex, like previous relationship, I walked into

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:44.040
a party and she was splayed out on a couch. And there were like people, like she was very

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:52.040
sexy. And they were like, in the dream, I was very, I was just turned on by, I was just

01:22:52.040 --> 01:23:05.040
watching her get sexed with guys that were like, you know, Ryan Gosling. Like they did sit-ups

01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:13.040
ever. And she was like, I'm so happy you've done sit-ups. But she wasn't like, oh, you're

01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:19.040
dick so much bigger than Dan Harmon's. She was like, happy to see me. And I was happy to see

01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:25.040
her. But I was also happy to see her plowed by like bucks.

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:35.040
Were you chatting friendly? I was like watching and jerking off. And then I woke up. So I don't

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:40.040
know where I got. But I wanted to volunteer that because I want this show to be a place where

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:46.040
people are vulnerable. Thank you, sir. I want this to be a place where people are vulnerable.

01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:53.040
Dan, in that dream, cast three guys that you want to see that, whatever the ex-girlfriend is, who

01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:58.040
are the three people that you want to see your ex-girlfriend in that dream be fucking?

01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:00.040
Well, I don't, I mean, the guys would be, I mean-

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:04.040
You said Ryan Gosling. Yeah, but I don't, I mean, that's my placeholder.

01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:06.040
But I'm saying now, pick like-

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:09.040
Well, I don't want a particular guy to fuck.

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:12.040
It's not about the specificity of that guy.

01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:14.040
That's what I'm saying though.

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:16.040
Those guys are mannequins.

01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:22.040
But now I'm asking you to be specific.

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:24.040
I don't want that guy.

01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:29.040
I'm saying now, I'm Satan. I'm saying pick the guy.

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:32.040
I don't pick the guy. I know you want it to be you and you're fine.

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:34.040
No, you can do it. You can do it.

01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:36.040
No, I want it to be Antonio Banderas.

01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:40.040
No, you can fuck Sarah Johnson.

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:44.040
All right, let's say that you are, it's Rosemary's baby.

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:47.040
You're, you're Rosemary.

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:50.040
Can I just say, Jane, you are one of the best guests we've ever had on the show.

01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:52.040
Thank you.

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:54.040
Jane, okay.

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:56.040
I want to say this so fast.

01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:01.040
Jane, let's say you had a dream where Dan was watching his girlfriend be fucked by other people.

01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:06.040
Who would you cast as the three guys that fucked Dan's ex-girlfriend?

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:08.040
Your cast was directed, Jane.

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:14.040
Okay, so, so keeping in mind that I'm, I'm, I'm a little older and I'm a father of three.

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:16.040
Okay, two, two.

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:20.040
Cast the people fucking Dan's ex-girlfriend in his dream.

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:22.040
Gene Kelly.

01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:24.040
Gene Kelly.

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:32.040
Along that line, Donald O'Connor.

01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:35.040
He's funny, but he's Donald O'Connor.

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:38.040
It's, it's funnier than Gene, it's funnier than Gene Kelly.

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:39.040
Donald O'Connor.

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:40.040
From the talking Mule movies.

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:41.040
Yeah, yeah.

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:43.040
Also from singing in the rain.

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:44.040
Singing in the rain, yeah.

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:46.040
He's the guy who runs and does the flips off the wall.

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:47.040
He jumps off the wall, yeah.

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:48.040
He makes them laugh.

01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:49.040
All right.

01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:50.040
You know what?

01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:51.040
He's very cute.

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:53.040
As long as she's happy and has agency.

01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:54.040
Yeah, yeah.

01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:55.040
And then, and then, and then for you.

01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:56.040
Then I'm going to come.

01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:57.040
All right.

01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:58.040
Jane.

01:25:58.040 --> 01:25:59.040
Then call back for Dan, Mark Ruffalo.

01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:00.040
Mark Ruffalo.

01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:01.040
Yeah.

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:02.040
Yeah.

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:03.040
Yeah.

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:05.040
Yeah.

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:07.040
I'd watch him fuck me.

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:09.040
That's how much I want to watch him fuck.

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:11.040
I think he said once you want him to show you how to guard.

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:13.040
I love Mark Ruffalo.

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:17.040
Dan, Dan, let's say you're having a dream.

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:19.040
Mark Ruffalo, David DeCupney.

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:21.040
You know, if you go to a gay place.

01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:22.040
Okay.

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:23.040
Here we go.

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:24.040
Here we go.

01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:25.040
Loosen up.

01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:26.040
I have more ready answers for dudes.

01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:27.040
All right.

01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:28.040
If I, if I, if I.

01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:29.040
For yourself.

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:30.040
Put a gun to my head.

01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:31.040
Force him with a game.

01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:32.040
Force him.

01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:33.040
I'm sorry.

01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:40.040
I, I, I think it's weird that you're yelling things out, but I do want to hear what you're

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:41.040
like.

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:42.040
Roger Morris.

01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:43.040
Roger Morris.

01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:54.040
I've heard a lot of interesting things, but I'm going to say, we take you now to Roger

01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:56.040
Morris fucking Dan Hyman.

01:26:56.040 --> 01:27:00.040
But what I'm going to say is Prince.

01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:05.040
Oh, David DeCupney, Mark Ruffalo, Prince.

01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:06.040
And me.

01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:09.040
And my open butthole.

01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:12.040
Now who's racist?

01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:15.040
Waiting, waiting to learn what it means to be a real.

01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:18.040
I think we've made some progress here tonight, Daniel.

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:19.040
Yeah.

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:20.040
Yeah.

01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:21.040
Would you bet your ass?

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:22.040
Uh, um.

01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:26.040
I, I want to say, G, G, Joe, like I, Scott, Scott, that's it.

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:29.040
Who, who would you like to see fucking Dino, male or female?

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:36.040
If you had to, if you had to fantasize not on stage, you got to pick anybody in the world

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:40.040
to be in bed and having complicated sex with.

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:43.040
And these are people I've never actually seen fucking him before.

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:44.040
No, no.

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:48.040
It could be, it could be anybody in the world past or present.

01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:50.040
Uh, that guy?

01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:51.040
That guy.

01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:53.040
Let's bring him up.

01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:55.040
Let's bring him up.

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:57.040
Come up here.

01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:59.040
Get the fuck up on stage.

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.040
Here he comes.

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:01.040
Where is he?

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:02.040
Oh Jesus Christ.

01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:03.040
There's a guy with a beard coming.

01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:05.040
Where'd he go?

01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:06.040
Where is he?

01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:07.040
Oh, he's leaving.

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:09.040
Wait, he, he doesn't know how things work.

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:10.040
The stage is this way.

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:11.040
Okay.

01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:12.040
Oh dear.

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:13.040
Have you not been looking the wrong way?

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:14.040
Sexy Spencer.

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:15.040
Sexy Spencer's on stage.

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.040
Everybody.

01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:17.040
Oh.

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:21.040
Oh, look at this.

01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:28.040
What's your name, sir?

01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:37.040
What's your, what's your name?

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:38.040
Vincent.

01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:39.040
Vincent.

01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:40.040
Vincent.

01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:42.040
Vincent, take your fucking pants off.

01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:44.040
Do you want to take my mic?

01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:45.040
Take my mic.

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:47.040
Do you want me to take my pants off?

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:48.040
Hello everybody.

01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:50.040
What do you want me to take my pants off?

01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:51.040
Do you want me to do a scene?

01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:53.040
Are we really doing the scene or Vincent?

01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:55.040
We should do a scene with Vincent, right?

01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:56.040
Yeah, we should do it.

01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:57.040
Just get it over with.

01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:58.040
I don't want to be in it.

01:28:58.040 --> 01:28:59.040
I don't want to be in it.

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:01.040
No, Dino, you're in it because this is about you.

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:03.040
Just do the scene.

01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:07.040
You know, if we don't make it a scene, Dino can just fuck this guy right now.

01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:08.040
Yeah.

01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:10.040
That I could do.

01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:14.040
So have you, I'll save you $800.

01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:17.040
No questions, no denials.

01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:19.040
Do an improv scene.

01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:20.040
improv scene about what?

01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:22.040
just fucking Gino.

01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:23.040
Dino.

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.040
Dino.

01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:25.040
Dino.

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:26.040
Dino.

01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:27.040
Dino.

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:28.040
Dino.

01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:29.040
Dino.

01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:30.040
Dino.

01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:31.040
Dino.

01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:32.040
Dino.

01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:33.040
Dino.

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.040
Dino.

01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:35.040
I deserve it.

01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:36.040
I deserve it.

01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:37.040
You're not worthy of having a real name.

01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:38.040
Can you beat me?

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:39.040
No.

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:40.040
Please.

01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:41.040
Well, we're in a library.

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:42.040
She's gonna bomb.

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:46.040
The library is burning down.

01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:48.040
And they are a fireman, come on.

01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:56.040
You don't have to narrate. You can just be in the moment. He doesn't even know, I don't even

01:29:56.040 --> 01:30:01.040
know how to improv and he's worse than me. We're in a library.

01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:05.040
Vincent, this is God. Tickle Geno's tits.

01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:14.040
Wait, wait, wait a second here. Here's the thing, I just, I mean, we could do it and it might

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:16.040
get some reaction. I don't think it's going to be that funny.

01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:20.040
Dino, this is not God. God just told you to let this guy tickle your tits.

01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:26.040
All right, tickle my tits. It's not going to tickle.

01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:33.040
All right, tickle. Okay. Hi.

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:36.040
Five minutes earlier at God's house.

01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:39.040
Five minutes earlier at God's house.

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:46.040
Oh, God. There are days and there are days.

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:51.040
What is this? Why do I have to?

01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:53.040
Am I in this or not?

01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:56.040
God, I'm your secretary.

01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:58.040
Well, I'm just going over this ledger.

01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:02.040
In four and a half minutes you have to make somebody tickle somebody's tits.

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:09.040
Man, is this about gay people again?

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:13.040
No, no. Don't be transnormative.

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:17.040
I'm God.

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:21.040
God, this is your God.

01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:23.040
Holy shit. Holy shit.

01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:25.040
Jesus Christ.

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:26.040
What the fuck?

01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:28.040
Holy fucking shit. Holy shit.

01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:33.040
You're in Daphne. Get out of here. Get out of here.

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:36.040
Get out. Get out. Get out.

01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:38.040
Get out.

01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:40.040
I'm not taking any calls.

01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:45.040
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:46.040
Yes, sir.

01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:49.040
Don't grovel if there's one thing I can't stand is groveling.

01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:51.040
I know that. I know that. I know that.

01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:53.040
I'm not doing it. I'm not groveling.

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:56.040
Just being God the way you said I should be.

01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:58.040
I started as nothing, exploded into everything.

01:31:58.040 --> 01:32:00.040
I made a universe where everyone's confused.

01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:02.040
There's someone who has a message for you, God.

01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:07.040
God, God. This is God, God, God.

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:10.040
Sorry, you're breaking up.

01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:13.040
This is God, God, God.

01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:15.040
Hang on, I've got another call.

01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:18.040
God, God? Yes, God, God, God.

01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:21.040
You're doing a great job.

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:23.040
Fucking keep it going.

01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:26.040
Oh, man, that's a blessing.

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:29.040
I guess if he's on hold, I might as well just make beads.

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:32.040
God. God.

01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:34.040
Oh, I was too late.

01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:37.040
Aids. Aids. Aids.

01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:39.040
Hey, hey, stop it. Stop it.

01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:43.040
Aids. Aids. Aids. Aids.

01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:45.040
God, please.

01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:47.040
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What?

01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:48.040
I'm glad I got that.

01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:49.040
No, I didn't hear you.

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:51.040
God, God. God, God, God.

01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:53.040
God, God? Yes, God, God, God.

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:55.040
This is God. I know who it is.

01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:57.040
The only person who can talk to me like this.

01:32:57.040 --> 01:33:01.040
Why does God keep creating...

01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:04.040
Can we stop this guy from creating aids over the place?

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:07.040
I was... I had just stopped him when you called me to you.

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:09.040
I gave you two jobs.

01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:12.040
One was to not let this guy create aids over the place.

01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:15.040
Also, sins is a bummer.

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:18.040
Sins is a bummer.

01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:20.040
All right, I'll take care of both.

01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:21.040
We're breaking up.

01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:23.040
I'm the worst God ever.

01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:25.040
Hey, God. Yeah.

01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:26.040
All right, let's stop with the aids,

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:27.040
or at least diminish it by...

01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:30.040
Oh, no, you buried the lead, buddy.

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:33.040
I just gave everyone aids.

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:34.040
Everybody?

01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:35.040
Yeah.

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:36.040
Okay, we've got a section of everyone's aids.

01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:39.040
Well, everyone in Africa.

01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:40.040
Okay, listen.

01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:41.040
Too soon?

01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:48.040
Fucking donate some money, you pricks.

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:51.040
I'm sorry, I'm...

01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:52.040
It's guilty.

01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:53.040
No, it's okay.

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:56.040
I'm glad you're finally talking to people down on Earth.

01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:57.040
What?

01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:58.040
Sorry, I'm sorry.

01:33:58.040 --> 01:33:59.040
What?

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:00.040
Aids.

01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:01.040
What?

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:02.040
Listen, God, there's someone who has to talk to,

01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:03.040
who has a message for you,

01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:04.040
and you need to talk to this person.

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:05.040
Do you understand?

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:06.040
Yeah, yeah.

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:07.040
Am I going to get fired?

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:11.040
The name of this person is Jane.

01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:12.040
Okay.

01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:15.040
You can call me Goddess.

01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:20.040
Well, which is it?

01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:21.040
Go to bed.

01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:23.040
You've been a naughty boy.

01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:27.040
It's time to go to bed, God.

01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:28.040
Good night.

01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:29.040
Shh.

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:30.040
Shh.

01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:31.040
It's okay.

01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:32.040
I'm sleeping.

01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:33.040
I'm sleeping God.

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:34.040
I'm sleeping God.

01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:35.040
I'm sleeping God.

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:36.040
I'm sleeping God.

01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:37.040
Kissy, kissy.

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:38.040
Kissy, kissy.

01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:54.040
God, sleepy guy, sleepy guy, kissy kissy, no water, stay in bed, no water, go to bed.

01:34:54.040 --> 01:35:13.040
Meanwhile, in God's dream. Hello, my name is Penny, and see you!

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:26.040
Okay, that's probably good enough. Big hand for Vincent, everybody. Let's give New York something.

01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:36.040
I swear to God, I know it's a bad thing. I know it's me being a bad podcaster, but I swear to God,

01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:43.040
I want, I guess when Jane was like for a while, like Jane was like not coming up in the podcast,

01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:52.040
and I was so excited about her coming up, and I'm 42 years old and I'm talking to every 16-year-old out there

01:35:52.040 --> 01:36:01.040
that has Tumblr message me, that doesn't like me, and says, I think you're a fat piece of shit,

01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:08.040
but like, Jane being on the show makes me think that you may not be a fat piece of shit,

01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:17.040
and you're wrong, I am a fat piece of shit, but you're right, I, like, you have no idea how many lives

01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:30.040
that you've probably saved, because you've been nice, and I think that you've probably gone through

01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:38.040
some pain, I think that people have probably beaten you online, and I want to try to offset that

01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:45.040
and say, here's your crown, here's your fucking scepter, because you're like through all of it,

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:51.040
this roller coaster ride of me going from like, what, a guy or a girl, I don't know what's going on,

01:36:51.040 --> 01:37:01.040
man, man, man, you've been the person that has, like, you're the George Washington of everything.

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:13.040
She's the George Washington of everything. Where can I go with the N-scene?

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:24.040
I guess, yeah, I mean, I'm not used to being well-known.

01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:30.040
Fist tuned with, well, genius? No, no, that, oh, sorry, no, no, no.

01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:34.040
He was hoping for a second. I wasn't fishing for that.

01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:43.040
There's been lots of people who, actually very few people who've really, like, approached me on

01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:48.040
Twitter or something, who've really come after me, but when they do, of course, I mean, it hurts,

01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:54.040
because, I mean, this has hurt my whole life, but it's also, because of the opportunity that you've

01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:57.040
given, I'm going to turn this around on you.

01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:02.040
What do people say online that hurts? How do they come at you?

01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:05.040
I can't imagine somebody would come at you in a hurtful way.

01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:08.040
Oh, no, really, people are great.

01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:11.040
What the fuck is the matter with you?

01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:16.040
People have a natural grace to them that just confounds the imagination.

01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:24.040
There's situations where people say, what the hell is trans?

01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:28.040
You're really a guy. Go kill yourself.

01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:31.040
You get that level of, yeah, absolutely.

01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:35.040
You're 16 and you don't know who you are.

01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:41.040
It's good for you to get passionate about this shit, and it's good for you to look at someone like me

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:45.040
and go, that guy's Jim Bellucci. I don't like him.

01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:50.040
I totally support you and accept that.

01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:56.040
But the idea that anybody ever said to you because you came on the show and because you talked to me,

01:38:56.040 --> 01:39:02.040
because I use the pronoun.

01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:06.040
Oh, you're a piece of shit. You fucking sold out.

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:08.040
Those people are good people.

01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:11.040
Well, everyone's good people, and I'm going to take a shit on the stage.

01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:13.040
Yeah, go ahead.

01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:16.040
Also, like a million people got shot last night.

01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:18.040
All right, go ahead.

01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:21.040
Thanks for that, Tia.

01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:26.040
Too late?

01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:29.040
Too real, or not real enough, I don't know.

01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:31.040
We had to walk through it.

01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:34.040
I didn't kind of distract us with that.

01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:38.040
There's 12 NYPD guys outside.

01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:42.040
For me, because we talked about this earlier today,

01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:49.040
I'm a dummy coming late to the party of knowing how to have a vocabulary about how to address it.

01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:52.040
The pronouns is like the trouble for me.

01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:55.040
We just want to know how to say things, but like meeting you,

01:39:55.040 --> 01:40:01.040
you're my first introduction into saying...

01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:07.040
Having a concept about the idea that gender could be any old thing.

01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:09.040
Could be anything, right?

01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:16.040
It really comes down to from the part of the person who's presenting themselves

01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:21.040
as a non-traditional gender combination or whatever it is.

01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:24.040
Sensitivity just has to be there from everybody.

01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:29.040
Everyone's kind of coming into this new game, kind of unprepared.

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:31.040
Our culture isn't prepared to deal.

01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:33.040
Our language isn't prepared to deal with it.

01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:40.040
So given that, and given the fact that people deserve to be treated humanely on both sides,

01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:41.040
everyone...

01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:43.040
Well, don't be a dick.

01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:46.040
Everyone has to be ready to engage.

01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:49.040
And if someone isn't ready to engage, say with me,

01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:54.040
and they insist on calling me he, he, he, or whatever,

01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:55.040
what am I going to do?

01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:56.040
Change them? No.

01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:58.040
If we're going to change them all, I'm going to change them.

01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:00.040
I'm just continuing to be a good person.

01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:03.040
And you've just got to learn to let things roll off your back.

01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:06.040
I've been letting things roll off my back for a long time.

01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:11.040
The world isn't going to change in my lifetime.

01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:13.040
I can't...

01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:16.040
But I've got to go on and have my life and have it as good as I can

01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:18.040
and make the life as good for everybody.

01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:20.040
What's great about you, and also other friends of ours,

01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:24.040
is that when we fuck up, when we mispronounce,

01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:28.040
and we say the wrong thing, you never go, you did it wrong.

01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:30.040
You never shame us.

01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:32.040
You should be ashamed of yourself.

01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:34.040
There's no resolution there.

01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:37.040
You did it wrong, here's how to do it right.

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:40.040
That's not how you teach people, that's not how you model good behavior.

01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:45.040
You just step back, and if there's an opportunity to re-engage and educate,

01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:47.040
great, you do that, if it's not...

01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:49.040
This isn't a formal education, it's informal education.

01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:53.040
It's nice being in a city, and there are cities all over the world

01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:59.040
that where people are progressive and open themselves up to this stuff.

01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:01.040
The fact that there's a conversation that happens about this,

01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:07.040
when I was a kid, there was gay, straight, and maybe a third color called bi.

01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:10.040
There were three colors in that.

01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:13.040
I was hungry, I was hungry.

01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:20.040
The idea now that sexuality can be any shade, any thing,

01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:23.040
is a new thing for everybody.

01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:27.040
It's always been there.

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.040
We never have vocabulary for it.

01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:31.040
Exactly, exactly, and that's what's been brilliant lately,

01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:34.040
is that really coming from kids mostly,

01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:39.040
is just redefining the language and coming up with all these great terms.

01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:41.040
Unfortunately, it makes for the alphabet suit of like,

01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:44.040
lgbtqqia...

01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:47.040
QQGGIA.com

01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:50.040
Jane, you look like a guy,

01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:54.040
a converse in jeans and stuff,

01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:59.040
and to say she, I have to wrap my brain around that,

01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:03.040
and it's a new thing that I have to let myself do.

01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:05.040
Let me tell you an interesting story.

01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:08.040
Every time I go, when I fly, and I go through the airport,

01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:11.040
and I go through the porno scanner,

01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:15.040
I get flagged, and I'm usually dressing,

01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:18.040
I tend to present relatively male,

01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:21.040
but because I come through and I'm presenting male,

01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:24.040
it is someone's job, and it's going to be,

01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:28.040
it's honestly someone's job, to push a button on that machine,

01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:32.040
a red, a pink button, or a blue button, literally,

01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:36.040
that they read, okay, I'm reading this person as male,

01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:38.040
push the blue button.

01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:40.040
That sets up a particular algorithm in the machine

01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:43.040
that then says, okay, look, when you do this scan,

01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:47.040
if there's anything close to the outline of a standard body

01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:50.040
that is an anomaly, that person needs to be checked.

01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:54.040
So if I'm going through and I'm reading as male,

01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:58.040
I'm wearing a bra, and so I have a bra strap in the back

01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:00.040
that sets off the machine.

01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:02.040
You have to be stepped over.

01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:04.040
And that's the pink button, right?

01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:06.040
No, so they push the blue button.

01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:09.040
I thought pink meant like your dick color.

01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:11.040
No, no, no, no, no.

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:13.040
That's a different pink.

01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:15.040
It's not the color of his dick.

01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:17.040
I didn't know.

01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:18.040
They're trying to read that.

01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:19.040
I didn't know.

01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:21.040
Yeah, be educated, be educated.

01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:26.040
But the thing that's also really fucked up then

01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:28.040
is because I was read as male,

01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:32.040
a male, a guy comes up to actually do my pat down.

01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:34.040
Which by the way, I mean...

01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:36.040
But then I have to look him in the eye and say,

01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:38.040
there's something between your shoulder blades.

01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:42.040
And I have to go, it's my bra.

01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:44.040
But that puts it on me.

01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:47.040
I'll do it, and it feels pretty cool to do it.

01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:50.040
But it's also, it sucks.

01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:53.040
It sucks that there's a system in place at this point.

01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:55.040
I mean, it's not just friends misreading

01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:58.040
or messing up on a pronoun.

01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:00.040
This is an entire system, security system,

01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:02.040
I'm forced to go through to go on a plan.

01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:04.040
I could go around, I could do TSA pre-check,

01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:07.040
or I could just go straight to a pat down.

01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:10.040
We all know 95% is not effective.

01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:13.040
And they're not, they're trying their best

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:16.040
because they're going, oh, what we don't want

01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:21.040
is for a lady to feel violated by a dude going,

01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:25.040
oh, are you Al Qaeda? You're pussy.

01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:27.040
They're trying.

01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:31.040
They made their rules based on actually respect.

01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:35.040
But based on respect of a dichotomy.

01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:38.040
Of a dichotomy that has been sort of irrelevant for 15 years.

01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:40.040
The hardest thing we all have to do now is release

01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:42.040
from the fucking dichotomy.

01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:44.040
That's the education thing.

01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:46.040
It would be great for bars and restaurants

01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:48.040
because how much real estate do you think,

01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:51.040
that you have to have a men's room and a women's room?

01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:53.040
It's like, like, fucking, like, combine them.

01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:55.040
I did one shitty bathroom.

01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:57.040
There's a hole in the floor and you're like,

01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:01.040
shit, I'm a shit in the block.

01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:05.040
The place in Paris that you were talking about?

01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:07.040
La Pérouse, yeah.

01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:10.040
I got this picture at an airport

01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:13.040
and it was the male bathroom, the female bathroom.

01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:15.040
It actually had like male symbols there

01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:17.040
and blue lights of above and pink lights.

01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:19.040
This brick wall in between the male and the female.

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:21.040
And so I did this picture where it was like,

01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:23.040
that's bathroom nine and three quarters.

01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:27.040
That's where I need to go through that wall.

01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:29.040
There's like all these fantasy bathrooms.

01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:32.040
There's like trans men who are like in bathrooms

01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:34.040
doing selfies and they're like all bummed out

01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:36.040
because they're like...

01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:38.040
Because they have to be in the women's room

01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:40.040
because according to the rules...

01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:42.040
I'm sad.

01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:44.040
I look like Tom Scarrett, but I'm sad.

01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:47.040
Like in the women's room.

01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:54.040
I'm going to do a podcast history wrap.

01:46:58.040 --> 01:47:02.040
And it's going to make your struggle, Jane.

01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:06.040
Seem like nothing.

01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:08.040
I'm going to actually...

01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:11.040
Everyone who's ever had a problem...

01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:15.040
I'm going to make you feel like shit.

01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:19.040
Because I'm going back to the streets.

01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:22.040
And if you think you've suffered,

01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:24.040
you're full of shit.

01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:29.040
Because equality.

01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:31.040
Yo.

01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:32.040
Yo.

01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:33.040
Yo.

01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:34.040
Yo.

01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:35.040
Everybody.

01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:36.040
Yo.

01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:37.040
Okay.

01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:38.040
Yo.

01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:39.040
Sorry.

01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:41.040
Yo.

01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:42.040
Okay.

01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:48.040
The transgender community is going to like this wrap.

01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:51.040
They're very easy to please.

01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:54.040
And then they're going to like this wrap.

01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:55.040
Yo.

01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:56.040
Yo.

01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:57.040
Yo.

01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:58.040
Yo.

01:47:58.040 --> 01:47:59.040
Yeah.

01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:00.040
Podcast history.

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.040
Just kidding.

01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:02.040
Yeah.

01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:04.040
World's best improv wrap of all time.

01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:05.040
Yo.

01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:06.040
You're powerful.

01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:07.040
Yo.

01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:08.040
You're powerful.

01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:09.040
Yo.

01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:10.040
You're powerful.

01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:14.040
You're the most powerful person in the world.

01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:16.040
You're powerful.

01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:17.040
Yo.

01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:19.040
You're powerful.

01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:21.040
You're powerful.

01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:22.040
You have all the power.

01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:23.040
But you should have more.

01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:24.040
You should have more power.

01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:28.040
World's best improv wrap.

01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:30.040
I don't mean to imply that you...

01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:31.040
I'm feeling so good about this.

01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:32.040
Enough power.

01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:34.040
You should have more power.

01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:35.040
Okay.

01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:36.040
Let me try.

01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:37.040
Okay.

01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:38.040
Yeah.

01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:39.040
This wrap is...

01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:41.040
That was the transgender...

01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:42.040
They got that.

01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:43.040
No.

01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:45.040
Let's go back to the slow rap.

01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:46.040
I like that.

01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:48.040
The transgender community got their wrap.

01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:49.040
That was good.

01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:52.040
If they're not satisfied with that, frankly...

01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:53.040
Here we go.

01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:54.040
What?

01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:55.040
There's no pleasing them.

01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:56.040
Den.

01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:58.040
This wrap is for the ladies.

01:48:58.040 --> 01:48:59.040
Here we go.

01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:02.040
This is for identifying more to the ladies.

01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:04.040
The cisgender ladies.

01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:07.040
This is for the medium ladies in the house.

01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:09.040
Who just love being a lady.

01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:10.040
Yeah.

01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:11.040
No joke.

01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:12.040
Yeah.

01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:13.040
You're grown.

01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:14.040
And pleasure.

01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:15.040
Yo.

01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:20.040
I know who you are.

01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:24.040
I know you want a car.

01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:27.040
And I'm gonna give it to you.

01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:33.040
I'm gonna give you a car.

01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:37.040
Your hair is probably red.

01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:40.040
And it's shoulder length.

01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:42.040
And that's good.

01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:49.040
And when I see you, I don't perceive you as human.

01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:52.040
But I worship you.

01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:57.040
So, hey, what's the big deal?

01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:02.040
Can't I just play Minecraft?

01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:06.040
Can't we work out some kind of arrangement?

01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:08.040
Because I love you.

01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:12.040
Julia, we should fuck this guy right now.

01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:17.040
I am a man of means.

01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:23.040
21st century, I love the ladies.

01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:32.040
Oh.

01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:38.040
I have a cyst above my ass crack.

01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:42.040
World.

01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:47.040
What's going on?

01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:56.040
I don't understand what's going on, but my self-esteem is low enough

01:50:56.040 --> 01:51:02.040
that I will try this.

01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:03.040
Oh, shit.

01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:04.040
Okay, yeah.

01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:05.040
Yeah.

01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:10.040
We're doing it in Brooklyn.

01:51:10.040 --> 01:51:12.040
Uptown, downtown.

01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:14.040
Thank you for having me.

01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:17.040
It was so pretty.

01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:19.040
Let's hear it.

01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:20.040
That's it.

01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:27.040
Do you know Sametabulous?

01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:28.040
Jane Cook.

01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:30.040
Down midtown.

01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:32.040
103.

01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:35.040
Go down to 101.

01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:37.040
Don't, don't, don't.

01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:39.040
My dick is small.

01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:42.040
I don't want to see it.

01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:44.040
No, don't, don't shame me.

01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:45.040
Put it back down.

01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:47.040
Oh, you want to cover that?

01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:48.040
Okay.

01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:49.040
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:50.040
I'm your mayor, Dan Harmon.

01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:54.040
Downtown, midtown, uptown.

01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:59.040
Go around, got the uptown, midtown.

01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:00.040
Jane.

01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:05.040
Jane is a hero for bringing us to the Grand Rapids.

01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:06.040
She's a great fan of me.

01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:09.040
You don't have to be anything you don't want to be.

01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:10.040
Jane.

01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:12.040
Jane is a great fan of me.

01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:13.040
Whoa.

01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:14.040
What?

01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:15.040
What?

01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:16.040
Very fast.

01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:17.040
Take chances.

01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:18.040
Yo.

01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:19.040
Yo.

01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:20.040
Yeah.

01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:24.040
Uptown, midtown, downtown.

01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:26.040
101 to 103.

01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:29.040
I'm going to do what everyone does.

01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:33.040
I'm a guy from New York.

01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:36.040
130 to A Street.

01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:37.040
Hangin' out.

01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:39.040
Doin' the beat.

01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:40.040
Hello.

01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:41.040
Hello.

01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:42.040
Hello.

Who cares?

01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:19.040

Nope, nope, nope, nope.

01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:07.040
Some of you are saying for a Farsi rap,

it's never gonna happen.

01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:10.040
If you stand up, you're allowed to get the fuck out of here.

01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:11.040
You're a bad person.

01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:13.040
If you stand up, you're a bad person.

01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:15.040
We're all going to have drinks at the library bar

01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:16.040
in the East Village.

01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:18.040
You know when you go to see a movie about the holocaust

01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:19.040

01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:56.920
Just talk to somebody

01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:03.800
I love you guys well different Mike, okay, let's do a new show

01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:14.960
Did you ever see women got the long hair when they go shopping

01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:20.240
Why they go shopping if they got long hair

01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:37.920
Yeah, this is a different show. What's it? What's what's happened? No, let me just finish up my 45

01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:45.520
Everybody's stand up and walk outside. Oh

01:57:45.520 --> 01:58:04.520
Oh shit, oh shit women are have holes where their wieners should be hold on. Sorry. I

01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:11.400
Don't I don't okay. Yes, what?

01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:17.400
Is that no, that's my uncle he's good

01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:23.680
All right, so what he told me is women be shopping

01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:27.160
And it reminds me of

01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:30.200
The fact I

01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:34.840
Have a test. I know you ladies don't want to shop. I

01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:40.960
Know you don't want to shop, but you do shop

01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:49.400
And so I came up with a little test if you know whether you like to shop I

01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:52.520
Came up with a test

01:58:52.520 --> 01:59:00.480
For instance, if you think hot dogs are

01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:03.920
Shot shot things you should shop for

01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:21.920
You might be a woman

01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:35.920
Yeah

01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:46.960
So don't let your dick don't let your dick fall out. There's cops in the room. What don't let your dick fall out. Okay, so

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:52.280
Tonight there's a lot of ladies in the room. Am I right?

01:59:53.800 --> 01:59:55.800
You know who you are

01:59:56.120 --> 01:59:58.120
You know what you do

01:59:58.480 --> 02:00:00.480
You know what you're doing

02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:02.480
You

02:00:03.240 --> 02:00:09.760
Know what you do, you know why you do it the thing about women is women do a good thing

02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:12.440
Women are good people

02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:16.360
They're exactly the same as men in every respect

02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:19.080
every respect

02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:21.320
however

02:00:21.320 --> 02:00:23.320
women are different

02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:28.040
Biochemically they're different

02:00:28.040 --> 02:00:32.480
No, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, he's a woman. He's a woman

02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:37.640
So for instance couple of examples

02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:45.120
Let's say what happens is an apocalypse

02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:53.120
Let's say nuclear weapons go down every guy's blown up fuck dead

02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:59.360
Every guy's blown up you driving around you got rubber tire armor

02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:02.160
You got you got armor made out of rubber tires

02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:07.400
You're like, I'm driving I need some water. I need some gasoline

02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:09.960
But I'm a man

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
You run into a woman

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:23.000
She got a robot arm

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:34.200
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. I will I will electrocute you. Sorry. I'm sorry

02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:36.200
Sorry

02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:43.520
Okay, okay, I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry about that

02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:47.400
But you got a robot arm

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:54.320
In the middle of apocalyptic wasteland you got a robot arm

02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:00.040
Anyways, what else is going on

02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:04.760
You see these people this Donald Trump's

02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:09.560
Donald Trump's be talking about some shit

02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:17.040
Is it this guy's running for president he says I want to be president my name's Donald Trump

02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:21.040
Think about it

02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:24.920
Why would you want to be president if your name was Donald Trump?

02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:28.040
Why not just be Donald Trump?

02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:31.280
That's more powerful than a president

02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:34.040
Don't be present

02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:37.640
Now you you could be president of a company

02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:41.160
You could be you could be president of

02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:46.560
Sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:51.320
I'm saying it's not a joke. I was saying like Donald Trump should be happy by now

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.880
He was born. He was born with a standard amount of wealth

02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:58.000
Like standard for a white man

02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:01.000
but he had enough wealth and

02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:03.880
Relative to his position

02:03:03.880 --> 02:03:07.200
Like what he did with his wealth is actually a failure

02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:14.800
So why is him why why why is he you should he should he should you should look at him and say he did a

02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:16.960
Bad job

02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:19.460
Sorry, I'm sorry. Hold on one second. Hold on

02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:22.480
Let's go

02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:24.480
Listen, okay

02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:27.240
No, it's okay. It's okay

02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:31.640
It's a horrible horrible thing for

02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:36.240
Trump to think that he has anything close to

02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:40.560
Any opportunity to become the president but

02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:46.800
It's entertaining right right, but what if women were in charge of the political process?

02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:50.360
You know that would be different

02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:56.120
You know, you know if women were in charge of presidents

02:03:57.080 --> 02:03:59.920
That shit would go real fast

02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:05.120
You'd be like, oh, I'd like to be president. They'd be like

02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:17.720
Hold on hold on hold on hold on

02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:20.360
Can you hold can you hold this?

02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:42.720
Everybody needs to get calm

02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:47.640
Oh, everybody didn't need some juice and everything's fucked up

02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:50.760
Shit, what else is going on?

02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:55.640
You got you got you got Isis you got Isis

02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:00.320
Isis

02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:02.480
Isis bad

02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:09.440
Bad people these people are bad people shit

02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:16.880
You you walk around you got Isis talking about shopping women

02:05:17.440 --> 02:05:19.440
If Isis were women

02:05:19.960 --> 02:05:21.960
That would go a lot differently

02:05:23.880 --> 02:05:27.400
If Isis were women they'd be out of business

02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:35.280
Because women

02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:41.280
Aren't human and nor is Isis

02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:45.280
So if you do both together

02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:52.680
Everybody everybody's doing something different

02:05:53.360 --> 02:05:55.360
Everybody's always doing something different

02:05:56.320 --> 02:06:00.640
Everybody's always doing something different. Nobody ever wants to know what's going on

02:06:00.640 --> 02:06:06.280
Everybody wants to know what's going on. Nobody wants to know what's going on for instance

02:06:08.240 --> 02:06:13.480
No, come on. Don't don't don't shame. No, don't

02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:19.000
Don't

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
No, don't

02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:24.640
My dick is small

02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:30.960
It's gonna be a big deal. You find out my dick is small. I told you all my dick is small. Don't

All right, well, okay, so

02:06:46.040 --> 02:06:52.880
Everything knows go wrong those sounds make a combination of syllables going wrong going down

02:06:52.880 --> 02:07:00.280
Every syllable goes down if you say it a certain way if you say words

02:07:01.120 --> 02:07:02.400
different

02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:04.400
They will sound effective

02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:06.920
