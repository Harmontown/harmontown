00:00.000 --> 00:16.480
From the Bureau of Manhattan Community College, Tribeca Performing Arts Senator, and the New

00:16.480 --> 00:22.480
York Comedy Festival, Harmontown is now in session.

00:22.480 --> 00:34.480
How about we introduce our Game Master, Mrs. Spencer Crittenden.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.480
Hello.

00:36.480 --> 00:38.480
Hello, Spencer.

00:38.480 --> 00:40.480
Thank you.

00:40.480 --> 00:43.480
You got a really adorable little desk there.

00:43.480 --> 00:44.480
Oh, yeah.

00:44.480 --> 00:46.480
I'm owning my space.

00:46.480 --> 01:01.480
Let's bring out your Mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:01.480 --> 01:03.480
Big Apple, not too small.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.480
Big Apple, buildings tall.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.480
Lots of windows, lots of cars.

01:07.480 --> 01:11.480
Hey, this city ours.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.480
Good to me.

01:13.480 --> 01:17.480
Oh, all the New York history.

01:17.480 --> 01:24.480
George Washington once invaded.

01:24.480 --> 01:25.480
The River.

01:25.480 --> 01:28.480
The Third Street.

01:28.480 --> 01:33.480
Patrick Henry had a birthday here.

01:33.480 --> 01:37.480
Dan, you want to give us a little, some of your, your, your known as kind of a New York,

01:37.480 --> 01:40.480
like, kind of a, kind of a guide.

01:40.480 --> 01:43.480
You're like the Anthony Bourdain of New York.

01:43.480 --> 01:45.480
You know that podcast, The Bowery Boys.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.480
You know, it's like a podcast and they talk about New York.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.480
The Living Thriving New York.

01:50.480 --> 01:55.480
That's the, when I listen to those guys, I'm like, it'd be nice if they knew a thing or two about the city.

01:55.480 --> 01:56.480
Right.

01:56.480 --> 02:00.480
Where can I get the best spats?

02:00.480 --> 02:01.480
Spats.

02:01.480 --> 02:06.480
1853, right at the prime when Central Park was just a cattle ranch.

02:06.480 --> 02:08.480
That's when the spat was invented.

02:08.480 --> 02:13.480
What happened is General MacArthur, who used, it was part of the Sugar Trust.

02:13.480 --> 02:14.480
Right.

02:14.480 --> 02:19.480
He wanted to figure out a way to turn shoes into boots.

02:19.480 --> 02:26.480
Because a lot of people don't understand us, but the sodium street lights were highly combustible.

02:26.480 --> 02:34.480
And so it was a sign of wealth if you were singed.

02:34.480 --> 02:41.480
Because Fifth Avenue was basically a, before it was a candy bar, it was a fire hazard.

02:41.480 --> 02:44.480
But it was where the wealthy lived.

02:44.480 --> 02:57.480
And so boots were less popular than shoes because how could you survive a sodium streetlight fire with your boots intact?

02:57.480 --> 03:08.480
So the wealthy liked to wear shoes, which a lot of people don't know this, where shoes were invented.

03:08.480 --> 03:12.480
A shoe is a burnt boot.

03:12.480 --> 03:16.480
A shoe doesn't make any sense.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.480
Everything was a boot.

03:18.480 --> 03:22.480
And then this fashion thing happened where you needed to look like you were in a fire.

03:22.480 --> 03:26.480
So the more of the top of your shoe that was burnt off meant you were a sign of wealth.

03:26.480 --> 03:43.480
The more, the nearer the Rockefellers you were, who in that day you could see dancing at the Green Mile over on Third and Crenshaw.

03:43.480 --> 04:00.480
You know there were only three boroughs back then representing the two gangs of New York and of course the unofficial mayor of New York at that time, Butterfinger,

04:00.480 --> 04:06.480
Butterfinger boss Todd and his famously corrupt mayor.

04:06.480 --> 04:10.480
You were talking earlier then about why they call Wall Street Wall Street.

04:10.480 --> 04:15.480
Right. Well it was originally a wall.

04:15.480 --> 04:19.480
It wasn't a street because it's where people were making money and you don't want a street there.

04:19.480 --> 04:23.480
Poor people follow streets. You don't want them to go where your money goes.

04:23.480 --> 04:27.480
And then there was a sort of like famous like squabble.

04:27.480 --> 04:38.480
They threw a bunch of ticker tape into the harbor and the rich people said, what if it's a wall and a street and Wall Street was born?

04:38.480 --> 04:44.480
Just make it a street but we'll call it Wall Street because it means if you're here you're not welcome.

04:44.480 --> 04:50.480
Now go ahead. You can take your trolley. You can make your lightning bike.

04:50.480 --> 04:55.480
New York history. I'm just full of it.

04:55.480 --> 04:59.480
Where's the best place in town for you to get a nice Chinese hot pot?

04:59.480 --> 05:05.480
Well I know a lot of people will tell you never to go above a hundred and third.

05:05.480 --> 05:11.480
But the truth is the Upper East is the new meat pack.

05:11.480 --> 05:19.480
And I will find myself right between 95 and 97 on the corner of A and A.

05:19.480 --> 05:25.480
The best wontons in the Duplo.

05:25.480 --> 05:29.480
Look we don't have a lot of time. We're ripping through. This is a festival set.

05:29.480 --> 05:36.480
For those of you listening at home you're going to be like, whoa this podcast is really impressive.

05:36.480 --> 05:42.480
No we're just moving at a higher crisper pace because it's a festival energy.

05:42.480 --> 05:48.480
We're in a packed house here. I think we're at the...

05:48.480 --> 05:52.480
There's not a single empty seat.

05:52.480 --> 05:55.480
Don't look it up.

05:55.480 --> 05:59.480
I think tonight's attendance is 48,000 people.

05:59.480 --> 06:04.480
We're at the Metropolitan Opera House and we couldn't be...

06:04.480 --> 06:09.480
A lot of you people could have been at Elton John tonight at the Madison Square Garden but no they chose to be here.

06:09.480 --> 06:16.480
And the fire department's been turning people away. They can't fit all that people in here.

06:16.480 --> 06:23.480
There was not to make light of awful, awful current mass shootings or the mass shooting du jour.

06:23.480 --> 06:26.480
Maybe a little bit.

06:26.480 --> 06:32.480
What I think is odd is getting on a plane to go from California to New York

06:32.480 --> 06:37.480
and feeling safer because Griffith Park's on fire right now as we speak.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.480
My house is about to maybe burn down.

06:40.480 --> 06:44.480
We've been keeping eyes on that all day.

06:44.480 --> 06:51.480
It just feels nice to come out to a nice quiet evening in New York.

06:51.480 --> 06:55.480
Yeah man. We've got it under control.

06:55.480 --> 06:59.480
Where the stops are frisked.

06:59.480 --> 07:03.480
So at a certain point...

07:03.480 --> 07:09.480
No guests. I'm not going to come to New York and bring out...

07:09.480 --> 07:15.480
Here's John Oliver. It easily could. That would be an easy thing I could do.

07:15.480 --> 07:20.480
Butterfinger boss Todd is here tonight.

07:20.480 --> 07:25.480
But it would take time. He'd be playing catch up and all this stuff.

07:25.480 --> 07:29.480
Look. I brought Rob Schrab. Let's bring him out.

07:29.480 --> 07:32.480
Yeah.

07:48.480 --> 07:51.480
Look at this.

07:51.480 --> 07:53.480
How does that feel?

07:53.480 --> 07:56.480
What the fuck is going on here?

07:56.480 --> 08:00.480
What?

08:00.480 --> 08:04.480
Did you bring enough gum for the rest of the class?

08:04.480 --> 08:08.480
What is the... For the listeners we're describing...

08:08.480 --> 08:11.480
That's my dick.

08:11.480 --> 08:15.480
It looks like a walker had sex with a desk.

08:15.480 --> 08:18.480
What is a little black plastic thing in front?

08:18.480 --> 08:21.480
My dick's just popping out back here.

08:21.480 --> 08:27.480
Where are you from? You're fucking kidding me.

08:27.480 --> 08:30.480
Photos are good podcasting.

08:30.480 --> 08:33.480
I can't even take the picture. I can't even take the picture.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.480
He really can't.

08:36.480 --> 08:38.480
What is the front plastic section of the...

08:38.480 --> 08:41.480
It's to hide my dick.

08:41.480 --> 08:44.480
And the microphone is glued to the top?

08:44.480 --> 08:46.480
Or what?

08:46.480 --> 08:49.480
Why would you think that? That's a stupid thing.

08:49.480 --> 08:51.480
Turn the desk upside down.

08:51.480 --> 08:53.480
No, it's not stuck. Why would you think that?

08:53.480 --> 08:55.480
Lift it up.

08:59.480 --> 09:02.480
Don't make me move to the next stool.

09:02.480 --> 09:04.480
Oh, God.

09:04.480 --> 09:07.480
You were saying, Dan, I'm so sorry.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.480
This is kind of a rear show.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.480
It's not the first time coming to New York.

09:11.480 --> 09:14.480
We take the show on the road. We love going places.

09:14.480 --> 09:21.480
This is probably the first show that if we talk about the flight out here,

09:21.480 --> 09:23.480
it's the only thing we're ever going to talk about.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.480
That's good, though. That's a good show.

09:25.480 --> 09:29.480
We learned a lot of material on the way over here.

09:29.480 --> 09:32.480
I'm going to give you some headlines.

09:32.480 --> 09:37.480
First, in the interest of the...

09:37.480 --> 09:40.480
We took a limo to LAX from Los Feliz.

09:40.480 --> 09:44.480
You get into one of these limos and there's an ice thing,

09:44.480 --> 09:46.480
and there's some glasses.

09:46.480 --> 09:52.480
Every time I go, like, well, then we should have booze.

09:52.480 --> 09:55.480
I don't know what that is. Oh, I think it's called alcoholism.

09:55.480 --> 09:58.480
But you see ice, and you see glasses, and then you're like,

09:58.480 --> 10:02.480
well, then I go and get a bottle of vodka,

10:02.480 --> 10:04.480
and I get a bottle of Fernet Bronco,

10:04.480 --> 10:09.480
which is that Hitler medicine that Jeff's always talking about.

10:09.480 --> 10:11.480
If you're a fan of the podcast.

10:11.480 --> 10:14.480
Is it fixed or Hitler yet?

10:14.480 --> 10:16.480
You came down with some Hitler.

10:16.480 --> 10:20.480
I had a 24-hour Hitler.

10:20.480 --> 10:24.480
Hitler medicine.

10:24.480 --> 10:28.480
And we're just drinking in the traffic on the way to LAX,

10:28.480 --> 10:29.480
and we're having a good time.

10:29.480 --> 10:30.480
And we were fine.

10:30.480 --> 10:32.480
We were listening to Celine Dion.

10:32.480 --> 10:34.480
There was a CD in the limo.

10:34.480 --> 10:36.480
I think that's the last time the limo was used.

10:36.480 --> 10:39.480
You were playing the little mermaid soundtrack

10:39.480 --> 10:41.480
as loud as it could go.

10:41.480 --> 10:46.480
You and Cody were screaming along a different song,

10:46.480 --> 10:48.480
different lyrics to the song.

10:48.480 --> 10:49.480
I do.

10:49.480 --> 10:51.480
I remember everything up until about...

10:51.480 --> 10:53.480
Do you remember me going, maybe another song?

10:53.480 --> 10:55.480
Maybe a different one.

10:55.480 --> 10:58.480
I knew it was starting when Cody was like,

10:58.480 --> 10:59.480
play Chicago.

10:59.480 --> 11:04.480
What's the song where he had it coming?

11:04.480 --> 11:06.480
And I'm like, play he had it coming.

11:06.480 --> 11:08.480
And Jeff's like, it's called he had it coming?

11:08.480 --> 11:09.480
I don't know.

11:09.480 --> 11:11.480
And it's not called he had it coming.

11:11.480 --> 11:13.480
It's a cell block tango.

11:13.480 --> 11:16.480
But it's like, you know, Cody kind of like,

11:16.480 --> 11:19.480
I can see, you know, I've been with her for many years,

11:19.480 --> 11:21.480
and I can kind of start to see, like,

11:21.480 --> 11:24.480
which is usually an adorable amount of like,

11:24.480 --> 11:27.480
when the Gary Busey starts to come out, like the...

11:27.480 --> 11:28.480
Can I just stop you?

11:28.480 --> 11:31.480
When she starts to like, like, like, starts to become...

11:31.480 --> 11:35.480
There's like lines being drawn in the sand for no reason.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.480
Let me just paint one picture.

11:37.480 --> 11:40.480
Also, Cody is dressed like a garage mechanic.

11:40.480 --> 11:41.480
She's...

11:41.480 --> 11:42.480
Well, yeah.

11:42.480 --> 11:45.480
She has this like, comfortable, very sexy

11:45.480 --> 11:47.480
for how comfortable and practical it is.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.480
Usually those things don't overlap,

11:49.480 --> 11:51.480
but at the middle of that Vendaya...

11:51.480 --> 11:55.480
Bright pink chrome shoes, dressed like a mechanic.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.480
She looks like a mechanical night writer, yeah.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.480
Arms, everywhere.

11:59.480 --> 12:01.480
And she's like, you know, she's like,

12:01.480 --> 12:03.480
put it on that song, I love that song.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.480
And then that song starts and it's like,

12:05.480 --> 12:08.480
it starts with like, pop, swish, Schwartz,

12:08.480 --> 12:10.480
Cicero or whatever, you know, that's what I was talking about.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.480
And Cody's...

12:11.480 --> 12:14.480
Cody's of all the songs to defiantly pretend

12:14.480 --> 12:16.480
you know the lyrics to.

12:16.480 --> 12:19.480
I was like, pop, Cicero, Schwartz, like,

12:19.480 --> 12:21.480
you're just saying what you're hearing.

12:21.480 --> 12:23.480
You don't know the song anyways.

12:23.480 --> 12:26.480
But we're like, so we roll up to LAX and I'm like...

12:26.480 --> 12:29.480
See, now, if I can hit pause here,

12:29.480 --> 12:31.480
this is the last thing I remember.

12:31.480 --> 12:34.480
And this is like the forward of the story.

12:34.480 --> 12:38.480
Right, because the stars of the story that emerge

12:38.480 --> 12:42.480
are gonna be Jeff Davis and Cody Heller and...

12:42.480 --> 12:43.480
Steve Levy.

12:43.480 --> 12:48.480
I would call it a tale of two kinds of drunk.

12:48.480 --> 12:50.480
I don't know what happened.

12:50.480 --> 12:51.480
I feel like I really...

12:51.480 --> 12:53.480
You drank a lot and got drunk, that's what happened.

12:53.480 --> 12:56.480
But I disappeared.

12:56.480 --> 12:57.480
I became...

12:57.480 --> 12:58.480
Right, we'll get there.

12:58.480 --> 12:59.480
I think it's...

12:59.480 --> 13:00.480
He disappeared.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.480
It's actually a rare story that's actually

13:03.480 --> 13:06.480
probably most important to just cut ahead.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.480
It's like one of those like...

13:08.480 --> 13:13.480
Jeff will be awoken by...

13:13.480 --> 13:14.480
Police.

13:14.480 --> 13:17.480
LAX police on a bench.

13:17.480 --> 13:19.480
So there are questions.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.480
And ask him, where are you going?

13:21.480 --> 13:25.480
And his answer will be Los Angeles.

13:25.480 --> 13:28.480
And they will say, you're in Los Angeles.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.480
And he will then...

13:30.480 --> 13:31.480
Where are you going?

13:31.480 --> 13:34.480
And after a while, they'll arrive at New York.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.480
No, no, they got me there.

13:37.480 --> 13:38.480
They pitched New York.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.480
They said, where are you going?

13:40.480 --> 13:42.480
I said, I paused and I thought about it.

13:42.480 --> 13:44.480
I said, I don't know.

13:44.480 --> 13:46.480
I thought I was coming home.

13:46.480 --> 13:48.480
So because what happened...

13:48.480 --> 13:50.480
What we've pieced together...

13:50.480 --> 13:52.480
I can tell you the subjective things.

13:52.480 --> 13:54.480
I can tell you that I last saw Jeff and Cody.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.480
We got split up into the TSA checkpoint line.

13:56.480 --> 13:57.480
I looked over.

13:57.480 --> 13:58.480
These are my friends.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.480
I'm having a great time.

14:00.480 --> 14:01.480
I'm actually...

14:01.480 --> 14:03.480
I thought I was going to be the self-destructive rockstar.

14:03.480 --> 14:04.480
Because I'm like...

14:04.480 --> 14:05.480
The guy goes...

14:05.480 --> 14:07.480
I'm in my anti-TSA mode where I'm just like...

14:07.480 --> 14:09.480
I can't understand what you're saying.

14:09.480 --> 14:11.480
You have to take your laptop out of the bag.

14:11.480 --> 14:13.480
The guy goes to Dan.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.480
Sir, can I look in your bag?

14:15.480 --> 14:17.480
And Dan goes, what if I say no?

14:17.480 --> 14:19.480
And I'm like, oh Jesus Christ.

14:19.480 --> 14:21.480
That's how drunk I was.

14:21.480 --> 14:23.480
I'm like, oh God.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.480
He's the third drunkest person in the store.

14:25.480 --> 14:27.480
I'm like, oh my God.

14:27.480 --> 14:31.480
I was like, okay, I'm just going to fight the government.

14:31.480 --> 14:33.480
Let me answer that question.

14:33.480 --> 14:36.480
I end up being the Matthew Broderick in this story.

14:36.480 --> 14:40.480
I end up being the Anthony Michael Hall of this breakfast club.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.480
And I'm like, what are you going to do?

14:43.480 --> 14:45.480
Take me to Guantanamo?

14:45.480 --> 14:49.480
So I get through that line.

14:49.480 --> 14:51.480
And then Cody somehow,

14:51.480 --> 14:54.480
maybe it got activated by the backscatter machine.

14:54.480 --> 14:58.480
Like, she's a marionette of Courtney Love

14:58.480 --> 15:00.480
when she gets to the other side.

15:00.480 --> 15:04.480
And the only person holding the strings is...

15:04.480 --> 15:06.480
God.

15:06.480 --> 15:10.480
And God is not a good puppeteer.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.480
He's not.

15:12.480 --> 15:14.480
But I don't want to derail us with that stuff.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.480
We'll get back to that.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.480
We'll get back to that.

15:18.480 --> 15:22.480
We get up to the lounge where...

15:22.480 --> 15:24.480
Cody's like...

15:24.480 --> 15:26.480
It's delayed.

15:26.480 --> 15:28.480
It probably takes 20 minutes.

15:28.480 --> 15:30.480
We were over-served in the limo.

15:30.480 --> 15:33.480
And it must just be hitting her.

15:33.480 --> 15:37.480
And she's getting unable to be motile.

15:37.480 --> 15:40.480
And she's starting to like...

15:40.480 --> 15:44.480
She's just making sounds.

15:44.480 --> 15:51.480
And all you can register is that she's defiant about something.

15:51.480 --> 15:56.480
But then I'm not a good person either.

15:56.480 --> 16:00.480
You get to do your impression of me.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.480
Yeah, go, Schrab.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.480
Schrab has the best version of this story.

16:04.480 --> 16:07.480
Because I'm looking around and I'm seeing a guy.

16:07.480 --> 16:12.480
If I see Cody being Lucy Goosey in a fluorescent lit lounge at 6 p.m.

16:12.480 --> 16:15.480
And then I see a guy across from her going like this.

16:15.480 --> 16:17.480
Maybe that guy's playing Pokemons.

16:17.480 --> 16:19.480
But maybe he's TMZ.

16:19.480 --> 16:22.480
And I'm just like, I don't want to feel protective.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.480
Anyway, chaos.

16:24.480 --> 16:27.480
We get into the lounge, chaos, chaos, chaos.

16:27.480 --> 16:29.480
I'm like, here's my ticket.

16:29.480 --> 16:31.480
You're in first class. Go ahead.

16:31.480 --> 16:33.480
All right, that's great.

16:33.480 --> 16:35.480
I start walking.

16:35.480 --> 16:38.480
I'm walking around enough in time to see Cody

16:38.480 --> 16:40.480
going to the woman across the counter to go,

16:40.480 --> 16:43.480
what up, bitch?

16:43.480 --> 16:45.480
What up, bitch?

16:45.480 --> 16:48.480
And I'm like, oh, my God.

16:48.480 --> 16:51.480
And just to give you an indication of how...

16:51.480 --> 16:55.480
That bitch's response was in German.

16:55.480 --> 16:57.480
It was like, she was just...

16:57.480 --> 16:59.480
There was absolutely no way that she...

16:59.480 --> 17:01.480
We don't have the papers.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.480
Well, German maybe evokes that stuff.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.480
I'm just saying, like, make her Swiss.

17:05.480 --> 17:07.480
But she was a tourist.

17:07.480 --> 17:09.480
She didn't speak English because her response

17:09.480 --> 17:11.480
to what up, bitch, was Weltenschlangen?

17:11.480 --> 17:13.480
I don't know.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.480
What is happening?

17:15.480 --> 17:17.480
I came here for the gummy bears and the Seattle needle.

17:17.480 --> 17:19.480
I get so...

17:19.480 --> 17:21.480
My brain goes blank with deuce chills.

17:21.480 --> 17:23.480
Like, I'm just like going to...

17:23.480 --> 17:25.480
And I turn away and then I turn back again

17:25.480 --> 17:27.480
in time for you to catch you saying

17:27.480 --> 17:29.480
to the Swiss German woman,

17:29.480 --> 17:31.480
look,

17:31.480 --> 17:34.480
we don't work here and you're acting like

17:34.480 --> 17:36.480
we're supposed to know this stuff.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.480
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.480
Holy shit.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.480
You're confusing. I wouldn't say that.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.480
I'm not saying that to the tour.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.480
I was saying that to the people at the counter

17:46.480 --> 17:48.480
that worked for the airline.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.480
Yeah, wasn't she the Swiss German woman?

17:48.480 --> 17:50.480
No, Cody wasn't saying what up, bitch,

17:50.480 --> 17:52.480
to a person that worked for the airline.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.480
She was saying it to some poor bystander

17:54.480 --> 17:56.480
who was also sitting in the reading area.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.480
Okay, well, I was far away.

17:58.480 --> 18:01.480
So I'm glad we had this discussion.

17:58.480 --> 18:01.480
We're piecing it together.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.480
Right.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.480
And the great thing is, again,

18:03.480 --> 18:05.480
it gets worse.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.480
So...

18:05.480 --> 18:07.480
So Cody...

18:07.480 --> 18:09.480
So Cody is like...

18:09.480 --> 18:11.480
And she lost her boarding pass at this point, right?

18:11.480 --> 18:14.480
And her footing, she fell down a couple of times.

18:17.480 --> 18:19.480
We all love Cody, by the way.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.480
Yeah, we love Cody.

18:19.480 --> 18:22.480
You do a little nonlinear storytelling thing here

18:22.480 --> 18:25.480
because the whole time there's also this, like,

18:25.480 --> 18:29.480
the sideline of, like, Steve Levy is...

18:29.480 --> 18:31.480
Right, we have a mention.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.480
He's doing this, like,

18:31.480 --> 18:33.480
get him to the Greek if there's, like,

18:33.480 --> 18:37.480
eight Russell brands.

18:37.480 --> 18:41.480
And the theme I keep hearing is, like,

18:41.480 --> 18:43.480
well, can you try to...

18:43.480 --> 18:45.480
I'm gonna try to find Jeff.

18:45.480 --> 18:47.480
And I just keep thinking, like, where's Jeff?

18:47.480 --> 18:49.480
Where's Jeff?

18:49.480 --> 18:51.480
And then later, when we were driving here,

18:51.480 --> 18:53.480
Jeff's listening to the stories about Cody.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.480
And then Jeff's...

18:55.480 --> 18:57.480
Jeff at one point goes, uh...

18:57.480 --> 18:59.480
He goes, oh, well, maybe I was there

18:59.480 --> 19:01.480
and that's why I left?

19:01.480 --> 19:03.480
And Schrab goes, no.

19:03.480 --> 19:05.480
You were gone in the Star Wars crawl.

19:05.480 --> 19:07.480
You were...

19:07.480 --> 19:09.480
You were the Silver C-3PO.

19:09.480 --> 19:11.480
Which is true

19:11.480 --> 19:13.480
because, well, we base together...

19:13.480 --> 19:15.480
Here's what Jeff did.

19:15.480 --> 19:17.480
Jeff...

19:17.480 --> 19:19.480
Jeff was in the TSA checkpoint.

19:19.480 --> 19:21.480
The TSA checkpoint.

19:19.480 --> 19:21.480
We think he got through security, right?

19:21.480 --> 19:23.480
I was pretty sure he got through the X-ray machine.

19:23.480 --> 19:25.480
I was pretty sure he got through the X-ray machine.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.480
Right, he was just in a line and then disappeared.

19:27.480 --> 19:29.480
And then fate turned his body

19:29.480 --> 19:31.480
physically around enough

19:31.480 --> 19:33.480
that 40 years of touring

19:33.480 --> 19:35.480
and landing at LAX

19:35.480 --> 19:37.480
and eight quarts of Fernet Branca

19:37.480 --> 19:39.480
broke his sim

19:39.480 --> 19:41.480
and he...

19:41.480 --> 19:43.480
he ended up just walking

19:43.480 --> 19:45.480
to a baggage claim

19:45.480 --> 19:47.480
from the fucking X-ray machine.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.480
Better call an Uber.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.480
And he did call a lift.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.480
And he woke up on a bench

19:53.480 --> 19:55.480
three hours later

19:55.480 --> 19:57.480
by stun baton.

19:57.480 --> 19:59.480
Between... between getting out...

19:59.480 --> 20:01.480
between getting out of the limo,

20:01.480 --> 20:03.480
the next thing I remember

20:03.480 --> 20:05.480
is police tapping me on the shoulder.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.480
I was sitting downstairs

20:07.480 --> 20:09.480
outside at arrivals

20:09.480 --> 20:11.480
and a cop is going,

20:11.480 --> 20:13.480
sir, your friends are looking for you.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.480
Because Steve Levy called the fuzz.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.480
Because...

20:17.480 --> 20:19.480
Here's the thing.

20:19.480 --> 20:21.480
I was never... I was in New York

20:21.480 --> 20:23.480
when this was all happening.

20:23.480 --> 20:25.480
I was already in New York in a hotel room.

20:25.480 --> 20:27.480
Because for some reason, Spencer doesn't like

20:27.480 --> 20:29.480
to travel with us.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.480
Right.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.480
So...

20:35.480 --> 20:37.480
I put foam on all the sharp corners and stuff.

20:37.480 --> 20:39.480
It was two

20:39.480 --> 20:41.480
LAX cops that tapped me on the shoulder

20:41.480 --> 20:43.480
and said, hey, your friend, they moved your flight,

20:43.480 --> 20:45.480
come with us.

20:45.480 --> 20:47.480
Steve is now boarding the flight that is leaving

20:47.480 --> 20:49.480
without Jeff.

20:49.480 --> 20:51.480
And he's like, Spencer, Jeff is missing.

20:51.480 --> 20:53.480
Can you call someone?

20:53.480 --> 20:55.480
And not only did I have nine texts

20:55.480 --> 20:57.480
from Steve,

20:57.480 --> 20:59.480
I had four or five texts

20:59.480 --> 21:01.480
from the lift driver that I called.

21:01.480 --> 21:03.480
Because I was going to go home.

21:03.480 --> 21:05.480
And she's like, I'm here.

21:05.480 --> 21:07.480
Where are you? I'm upstairs.

21:07.480 --> 21:09.480
What the fuck?

21:09.480 --> 21:11.480
And I called the car thinking I was leaving

21:11.480 --> 21:13.480
the goddamn thing.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.480
And they were taking me back in

21:15.480 --> 21:17.480
to Alaska Airlines.

21:17.480 --> 21:19.480
And they go, okay, we have a flight for you.

21:19.480 --> 21:21.480
You're going to be in first class,

21:21.480 --> 21:23.480
so there's one seat available.

21:23.480 --> 21:25.480
And the woman says,

21:25.480 --> 21:27.480
and the cop says, sir, where are you going?

21:27.480 --> 21:29.480
And I said, Los Angeles.

21:29.480 --> 21:31.480
And he goes, you're in Los Angeles.

21:31.480 --> 21:33.480
Where are you going?

21:33.480 --> 21:35.480
And I went, I don't know.

21:35.480 --> 21:37.480
And then we all laughed.

21:37.480 --> 21:39.480
The cops and the lady,

21:39.480 --> 21:41.480
we all had a good laugh about it.

21:41.480 --> 21:43.480
I said, look, I've been on tour a lot

21:43.480 --> 21:45.480
and I'm very disoriented right now.

21:45.480 --> 21:47.480
I don't know what's going on.

21:47.480 --> 21:49.480
Disoriented.

21:49.480 --> 21:51.480
I tour a lot every Friday night, too.

21:51.480 --> 21:53.480
But I lost my compass now.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.480
I'm going to tour after I get done with you.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.480
Somehow, because Levy is awesome

21:57.480 --> 21:59.480
and he got me a driver

21:59.480 --> 22:01.480
from JFK,

22:01.480 --> 22:03.480
I somehow managed to make it

22:03.480 --> 22:05.480
to our hotel with my bags

22:05.480 --> 22:07.480
and all of my stuff.

22:07.480 --> 22:09.480
We thought you were going to come out on the carousel

22:09.480 --> 22:11.480
when we got to New York.

22:11.480 --> 22:13.480
We were so sure.

22:13.480 --> 22:15.480
But I just realized we're committing a major podcast crime,

22:15.480 --> 22:17.480
like all the true crime shows

22:17.480 --> 22:19.480
that focus on the murderers

22:19.480 --> 22:21.480
and not enough on the victims.

22:21.480 --> 22:23.480
I want to bring out Steve Levy.

22:23.480 --> 22:25.480
Because...

22:25.480 --> 22:27.480
Levy?

22:33.480 --> 22:35.480
Awesome.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.480
Because he was the only sober one

22:37.480 --> 22:39.480
to be able to piece all this together

22:39.480 --> 22:41.480
by asking him questions.

22:41.480 --> 22:43.480
I'm so sorry.

22:43.480 --> 22:45.480
Can we have Steve Levy come back on?

22:45.480 --> 22:47.480
I have a different music drop for him.

22:47.480 --> 22:49.480
Oh, damn.

22:49.480 --> 22:51.480
I'm so sorry. This will just take a second.

22:51.480 --> 22:53.480
Can you play it through your mic?

22:53.480 --> 22:55.480
I can try.

22:55.480 --> 23:07.480
MUSIC

23:07.480 --> 23:09.480
Wasn't this so much better?

23:09.480 --> 23:11.480
Thank you, Spencer.

23:11.480 --> 23:13.480
It's a good theme for you.

23:13.480 --> 23:15.480
A muffled, muted distance.

23:15.480 --> 23:17.480
That's what he deserves.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.480
He doesn't deserve a generic sound clip.

23:19.480 --> 23:21.480
All right.

23:21.480 --> 23:23.480
So, all's well that ends well.

23:23.480 --> 23:25.480
I get the car home, I make it.

23:25.480 --> 23:27.480
But, meanwhile, there's a whole...

23:27.480 --> 23:29.480
The A story is still happening aboard the original flight.

23:29.480 --> 23:31.480
Yeah, because most of the story happens while you're unconscious.

23:31.480 --> 23:33.480
Yeah.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.480
It's more fun to talk about Cody,

23:35.480 --> 23:37.480
but that's because we have answers about her.

23:37.480 --> 23:39.480
You...

23:39.480 --> 23:41.480
You went into the black hole.

23:41.480 --> 23:43.480
I did.

23:43.480 --> 23:45.480
I think I roofied myself. I don't know what happened.

23:45.480 --> 23:47.480
I got to tell you,

23:47.480 --> 23:49.480
I went to the University of Miami,

23:49.480 --> 23:51.480
and when I was there,

23:51.480 --> 23:53.480
we won Playboy Party School

23:53.480 --> 23:55.480
of the Year.

23:55.480 --> 23:57.480
And I had a lot of training

23:57.480 --> 23:59.480
being the only sober person

23:59.480 --> 24:01.480
at that school.

24:01.480 --> 24:03.480
Dealing with the most

24:03.480 --> 24:05.480
drunken people,

24:05.480 --> 24:07.480
and I really got to use those tools

24:07.480 --> 24:09.480
last night that I sharpened.

24:09.480 --> 24:11.480
You were great.

24:11.480 --> 24:13.480
Some highlights that I wasn't there for,

24:13.480 --> 24:15.480
because eventually I had to leave Cody in the lounge

24:15.480 --> 24:17.480
because I was like you people

24:17.480 --> 24:19.480
who I've not met, but hello,

24:19.480 --> 24:21.480
including Ruthie Aslan's cousin.

24:21.480 --> 24:23.480
Ruthie Aslan

24:23.480 --> 24:25.480
was a community editor.

24:25.480 --> 24:27.480
She was my right hand

24:27.480 --> 24:29.480
on a lot of amazing stuff I made

24:29.480 --> 24:31.480
and her cousins here.

24:31.480 --> 24:33.480
Shout out to her.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.480
You know what, you can be Ruthie's cousin and be a guy.

24:35.480 --> 24:37.480
It's a new world.

24:37.480 --> 24:39.480
Wow.

24:39.480 --> 24:41.480
Shout out to cousins

24:41.480 --> 24:43.480
for being inherently non-binary.

24:45.480 --> 24:47.480
Fuck your heteronormative

24:47.480 --> 24:49.480
nephews and nieces.

24:49.480 --> 24:51.480
Cousins are where it's at.

24:51.480 --> 24:53.480
They can be anything.

24:53.480 --> 24:55.480
Alright, anyways.

24:55.480 --> 24:57.480
Yeah, I mean...

24:57.480 --> 24:59.480
I'm sorry.

24:59.480 --> 25:01.480
I don't want this show to go by without people knowing

25:01.480 --> 25:03.480
that my girlfriend

25:03.480 --> 25:05.480
on the bridge to the...

25:05.480 --> 25:07.480
what do they call the bridgey thing?

25:07.480 --> 25:09.480
She made it...

25:09.480 --> 25:11.480
I never thought you would get her that far.

25:11.480 --> 25:13.480
Well, let's go back.

25:13.480 --> 25:15.480
Let's start from...

25:15.480 --> 25:17.480
Let's do a little...

25:17.480 --> 25:19.480
I mean, this is a little Rashomon, right?

25:19.480 --> 25:21.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:21.480 --> 25:23.480
I just wanted to...

25:23.480 --> 25:25.480
She saw a baby like in a stroller

25:25.480 --> 25:27.480
and said way too loud,

25:27.480 --> 25:29.480
look at that fucking baby.

25:29.480 --> 25:31.480
She...

25:31.480 --> 25:33.480
I was standing Cody up against the wall

25:33.480 --> 25:35.480
and I was looking at Cody.

25:35.480 --> 25:37.480
I was like, Codes, tell me something.

25:37.480 --> 25:39.480
And then she sees this baby.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.480
It's about two feet to her right.

25:41.480 --> 25:43.480
She goes, look at this fucking baby.

25:43.480 --> 25:45.480
An inch away from touching its hand

25:45.480 --> 25:47.480
and the mother's just like, uh...

25:47.480 --> 25:49.480
Oh, no.

25:49.480 --> 25:51.480
That's what Cody does.

25:51.480 --> 25:53.480
Cody drinks too much.

25:53.480 --> 25:55.480
She becomes Richard Dawson from the 70s,

25:55.480 --> 25:57.480
like Family Feud.

25:57.480 --> 25:59.480
She just keeps...

25:59.480 --> 26:01.480
She keeps welcoming people

26:01.480 --> 26:03.480
to her drunk of her.

26:03.480 --> 26:05.480
When she got on the plane,

26:05.480 --> 26:07.480
she looked over and there were two

26:07.480 --> 26:09.480
incredibly handsome gay dudes

26:09.480 --> 26:11.480
who were like...

26:11.480 --> 26:13.480
Two straight guys that handsome

26:13.480 --> 26:15.480
were hanging out together.

26:15.480 --> 26:17.480
It's just not possible.

26:17.480 --> 26:19.480
When you and I hang out,

26:19.480 --> 26:21.480
it's not a big deal.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.480
They were a very...

26:23.480 --> 26:25.480
They were clean cut,

26:25.480 --> 26:27.480
like straight edge kind of looking guys,

26:27.480 --> 26:29.480
but just actually strikingly

26:29.480 --> 26:31.480
chiseled and like

26:31.480 --> 26:33.480
handsome.

26:33.480 --> 26:35.480
But these are the thoughts you keep

26:35.480 --> 26:37.480
in your head.

26:37.480 --> 26:39.480
But not when

26:39.480 --> 26:41.480
you're America's aunt,

26:41.480 --> 26:43.480
my girlfriend after a drink,

26:43.480 --> 26:45.480
who

26:45.480 --> 26:47.480
comes on the plane and

26:47.480 --> 26:49.480
she plops down

26:49.480 --> 26:51.480
in the seat and looks over at those guys

26:51.480 --> 26:53.480
and goes like,

26:53.480 --> 26:55.480
Whoa, look at these good-looking fellas.

26:55.480 --> 26:57.480
Look at these handsome guys.

26:57.480 --> 26:59.480
They're very handsome.

26:59.480 --> 27:01.480
They're very handsome.

27:01.480 --> 27:03.480
Were you guys going to Alaska?

27:03.480 --> 27:05.480
Because we're on Alaska Airlines?

27:05.480 --> 27:07.480
Yeah.

27:07.480 --> 27:09.480
And they go,

27:09.480 --> 27:11.480
no, are you going to Alaska?

27:13.480 --> 27:15.480
Is that how they dress in Alaska now?

27:15.480 --> 27:17.480
Are you skipping over

27:17.480 --> 27:19.480
part of that baby encounter?

27:19.480 --> 27:21.480
I'm skipping over a million things.

27:21.480 --> 27:23.480
This is a post-Netflix audience.

27:23.480 --> 27:25.480
They can handle it.

27:25.480 --> 27:27.480
Did you know that Jonah Hill's character

27:27.480 --> 27:29.480
was actually an octopus after...

27:29.480 --> 27:31.480
Wasn't there a much more important thing

27:31.480 --> 27:33.480
with the baby?

27:33.480 --> 27:35.480
I just want

27:35.480 --> 27:37.480
people to know how much I love my girlfriend

27:37.480 --> 27:39.480
and why.

27:39.480 --> 27:41.480
I like that even the

27:41.480 --> 27:43.480
worst-case scenario with my girlfriend

27:43.480 --> 27:45.480
is

27:45.480 --> 27:47.480
Dark Bill Murray.

27:47.480 --> 27:49.480
Or that she's like,

27:49.480 --> 27:51.480
Look at this fucking baby.

27:51.480 --> 27:53.480
She was starting to unzip

27:53.480 --> 27:55.480
her knight or mechanic jumper.

27:55.480 --> 27:57.480
She happily unzipped her jumper

27:57.480 --> 27:59.480
and her boobs were out a little bit.

27:59.480 --> 28:01.480
And I don't know what...

28:01.480 --> 28:03.480
She's trying to feed the baby.

28:03.480 --> 28:05.480
She's like, hey, kid.

28:05.480 --> 28:07.480
Come over here.

28:07.480 --> 28:09.480
After she flaps down

28:09.480 --> 28:11.480
and says, take a look at these good-looking dudes,

28:11.480 --> 28:13.480
and they're going, oh, okay,

28:13.480 --> 28:15.480
right, whatever.

28:15.480 --> 28:17.480
And I'm sitting like a row or two behind.

28:17.480 --> 28:19.480
And then so for the next

28:19.480 --> 28:21.480
hour, I hear, go to sleep.

28:21.480 --> 28:23.480
Go to sleep.

28:23.480 --> 28:25.480
That's great.

28:25.480 --> 28:27.480
Go to sleep.

28:27.480 --> 28:29.480
Go to sleep.

28:29.480 --> 28:31.480
Are you going to break up with me?

28:31.480 --> 28:33.480
Go to sleep.

28:33.480 --> 28:35.480
Go to sleep.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.480
But she never went to sleep.

28:37.480 --> 28:39.480
No.

28:39.480 --> 28:41.480
She just sat there

28:41.480 --> 28:43.480
and kept looking over at me

28:43.480 --> 28:45.480
like my dad

28:45.480 --> 28:47.480
after eight Southern comforts.

28:47.480 --> 28:49.480
When I was 10, I would just get this

28:49.480 --> 28:51.480
feel this glare and I would go to sleep.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.480
I did nothing for five

28:53.480 --> 28:55.480
hours. I pretended to look at my phone

28:55.480 --> 28:57.480
while I was like,

28:57.480 --> 28:59.480
you're drunk too.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.480
You don't get mad.

29:01.480 --> 29:03.480
Just go to sleep

29:03.480 --> 29:05.480
and wake up normal.

29:05.480 --> 29:07.480
But she never did.

29:07.480 --> 29:09.480
She just slowly got more charismatic.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.480
She had

29:11.480 --> 29:13.480
best friends with the flight attendants

29:13.480 --> 29:15.480
and everybody.

29:15.480 --> 29:17.480
She's like, I'm fun.

29:17.480 --> 29:19.480
I know you're fun. I hate you.

29:21.480 --> 29:23.480
Dan's in the lounge

29:23.480 --> 29:25.480
going, I don't know what to do.

29:25.480 --> 29:27.480
I'm waving my options.

29:27.480 --> 29:29.480
You're a piece of celery right now.

29:29.480 --> 29:31.480
You're a piece of celery.

29:31.480 --> 29:33.480
I want to dump you in a dumpster.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.480
You're going to dump me? Why?

29:37.480 --> 29:39.480
Just like, oh my God.

29:39.480 --> 29:41.480
I want to die.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.480
Whereas I, like a gentleman,

29:43.480 --> 29:45.480
was just having a nice little map outside

29:45.480 --> 29:47.480
on a bench.

29:47.480 --> 29:49.480
Levy, do something to mitigate that

29:49.480 --> 29:51.480
glimpse he just gave these people

29:51.480 --> 29:53.480
of me talking to my girlfriend when she's

29:53.480 --> 29:55.480
incapacitated.

29:55.480 --> 29:57.480
So here's

29:57.480 --> 29:59.480
my side of this.

29:59.480 --> 30:01.480
So we get through security.

30:01.480 --> 30:03.480
Jeff is not,

30:03.480 --> 30:05.480
nowhere to be found.

30:05.480 --> 30:07.480
I'm like, well, look, Jeff,

30:07.480 --> 30:09.480
one thing about Jeff is every time we travel,

30:09.480 --> 30:11.480
he always splits up from the group and goes to a bar.

30:11.480 --> 30:13.480
Oh yeah, first thing that happens when we get through security.

30:13.480 --> 30:15.480
He just ditches us and goes and reads a book somewhere.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.480
You know, it's like, go read Moby Dick

30:17.480 --> 30:19.480
in the coolest bar in your city so he can come out here

30:19.480 --> 30:21.480
and say, oh, I love the penny pincher.

30:21.480 --> 30:23.480
And we go, oh, that's, wow, that's extra cool.

30:23.480 --> 30:25.480
I can't believe you read a Cormac McCarthy

30:25.480 --> 30:27.480
book in the fucking phone booth cafe.

30:27.480 --> 30:29.480
So,

30:29.480 --> 30:31.480
so

30:31.480 --> 30:33.480
our little touring family was like, look,

30:33.480 --> 30:35.480
this is what Jeff does, this is what Jeff does.

30:35.480 --> 30:37.480
I was going, no, he did not make it through security.

30:37.480 --> 30:39.480
Who do you think, Jeff's the grown up?

30:39.480 --> 30:41.480
And I

30:41.480 --> 30:43.480
knew I had to get them to the lounge.

30:43.480 --> 30:45.480
So I get them to the lounge.

30:45.480 --> 30:47.480
We had the altercation

30:47.480 --> 30:49.480
at the front desk where

30:49.480 --> 30:51.480
we couldn't get in because

30:51.480 --> 30:53.480
she lost her boarding pass, right?

30:53.480 --> 30:55.480
Cody lost her boarding pass. Dan didn't know

30:55.480 --> 30:57.480
which card he had to give to get us into the lounge.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.480
Schrab was already checked in. Cody was going,

30:59.480 --> 31:01.480
this bitch, she's so, she's got this,

31:01.480 --> 31:03.480
she's got this fucking bitch.

31:03.480 --> 31:05.480
She's,

31:05.480 --> 31:07.480
and the lady's just like,

31:07.480 --> 31:09.480
she's not going to make it on this. They will

31:09.480 --> 31:11.480
not let her on the flight if she's like this. And then I'm like,

31:11.480 --> 31:13.480
fuck, okay, well, this changes

31:13.480 --> 31:15.480
my night entirely.

31:15.480 --> 31:17.480
Then we realize how bad the situation

31:17.480 --> 31:19.480
is. Dan sits Cody down.

31:19.480 --> 31:21.480
She's stumbling. She could barely stand up

31:21.480 --> 31:23.480
at this point. She's stumbling while

31:23.480 --> 31:25.480
sitting down.

31:25.480 --> 31:27.480
Yeah. Yeah.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.480
She was in danger

31:29.480 --> 31:31.480
of missing the chair she had been

31:31.480 --> 31:33.480
sitting in for 10 minutes.

31:35.480 --> 31:37.480
She was still in the process

31:37.480 --> 31:39.480
of sitting in it.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.480
Schrab's texting me.

31:41.480 --> 31:43.480
What's the Wi-Fi?

31:43.480 --> 31:45.480
What's the Wi-Fi?

31:45.480 --> 31:47.480
What's the Wi-Fi?

31:47.480 --> 31:49.480
A man is dead. A big, pretty quiet.

31:49.480 --> 31:51.480
I'm like, oh, look at these lunatics.

31:51.480 --> 31:53.480
And I'm like, hey, I can't figure out,

31:53.480 --> 31:55.480
there's signs, literally a billboard right

31:55.480 --> 31:57.480
ahead of me. The Wi-Fi password

31:57.480 --> 31:59.480
is, what's the Wi-Fi password?

31:59.480 --> 32:01.480
I say,

32:01.480 --> 32:03.480
I say to the group, I got to find Jeff.

32:03.480 --> 32:05.480
They're like, you're being ridiculous.

32:05.480 --> 32:07.480
Jeff is fine. No, I got to find Jeff.

32:07.480 --> 32:09.480
So I go down and I look

32:09.480 --> 32:11.480
at every airport bar.

32:11.480 --> 32:13.480
No Jeff to be found.

32:13.480 --> 32:15.480
I call Spencer. I'm like,

32:15.480 --> 32:17.480
I know you just got to the hotel.

32:17.480 --> 32:19.480
I can't find Jeff.

32:19.480 --> 32:21.480
I might have to call you in a little bit

32:21.480 --> 32:23.480
to help me with this one.

32:23.480 --> 32:25.480
I'll let you know how things go.

32:25.480 --> 32:27.480
Cody's really blasted, too.

32:27.480 --> 32:29.480
We may not make it on this flight.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.480
I don't know what the hell is going to happen.

32:31.480 --> 32:33.480
And then I get back up to the lounge.

32:33.480 --> 32:35.480
Cody's gotten worse.

32:35.480 --> 32:37.480
She's wearing her black glasses

32:37.480 --> 32:39.480
and she's like...

32:39.480 --> 32:41.480
I thought that was cool.

32:41.480 --> 32:43.480
It's probably a terrible

32:43.480 --> 32:45.480
co-dependent relationship,

32:45.480 --> 32:47.480
but I was kind of turned on

32:47.480 --> 32:49.480
some of the time.

32:49.480 --> 32:51.480
I called Jeff about 10 times.

32:51.480 --> 32:53.480
Couldn't get in touch with him.

32:53.480 --> 32:55.480
I called church.

32:55.480 --> 32:57.480
She hadn't heard from him.

32:57.480 --> 32:59.480
And then the flight starts boarding

32:59.480 --> 33:01.480
and I'm like, Rob, you guys have to get on this flight.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.480
I turn to Dan.

33:03.480 --> 33:05.480
I'm like, what's boarding?

33:05.480 --> 33:07.480
You know, we have to make a decision.

33:07.480 --> 33:09.480
And Dan's like, to Cody,

33:09.480 --> 33:11.480
Cody, I love you.

33:11.480 --> 33:13.480
I think the best thing for me to do

33:13.480 --> 33:15.480
is cancel this video.

33:15.480 --> 33:17.480
Take you home.

33:17.480 --> 33:19.480
Take care of you because

33:19.480 --> 33:21.480
you're not going to get it.

33:21.480 --> 33:23.480
Yeah, give them the mic.

33:23.480 --> 33:25.480
You're cutting it out.

33:25.480 --> 33:27.480
Yeah, give them the other mic.

33:27.480 --> 33:29.480
Now you take the other mic on the stool.

33:29.480 --> 33:31.480
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:31.480 --> 33:33.480
You got it, you got it.

33:33.480 --> 33:35.480
You know, a lot of people could do that

33:35.480 --> 33:37.480
without any words.

33:37.480 --> 33:39.480
So

33:41.480 --> 33:43.480
he looks at me.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.480
What am I doing?

33:45.480 --> 33:47.480
I can't deal with it.

33:47.480 --> 33:49.480
They're not going to let her on this flight.

33:49.480 --> 33:51.480
Look at her. She can't stand up.

33:51.480 --> 33:53.480
I said,

33:53.480 --> 33:55.480
I got it. Don't worry about it.

33:55.480 --> 33:57.480
Just get on the flight.

33:57.480 --> 33:59.480
I'll figure it out.

33:59.480 --> 34:01.480
Dan goes, I don't know how you're going to figure this out.

34:01.480 --> 34:03.480
But, okay,

34:03.480 --> 34:05.480
I don't want to cancel this show.

34:05.480 --> 34:07.480
I don't want to go to New York without Cody.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.480
He turns to Cody.

34:09.480 --> 34:11.480
He tells her that he loves her about 12 times.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.480
He kisses her and he goes,

34:13.480 --> 34:15.480
I'm so sorry.

34:15.480 --> 34:17.480
I believe he's going to figure this one out somehow.

34:17.480 --> 34:19.480
And he goes,

34:19.480 --> 34:21.480
and I look at Cody and I'm like,

34:21.480 --> 34:23.480
Codes, it's you and me, bros tonight.

34:23.480 --> 34:25.480
We're going to figure this out somehow.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.480
Where's your boarding pass?

34:27.480 --> 34:29.480
She's like, I don't know.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.480
I had printed her a second boarding pass at this point.

34:31.480 --> 34:33.480
She lost this one.

34:33.480 --> 34:35.480
I was like, okay, Cody,

34:35.480 --> 34:37.480
we're going to get on this flight.

34:37.480 --> 34:39.480
It's boarding. Don't even trip.

34:39.480 --> 34:41.480
I got to find Jeff.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.480
She's like, yeah, Jeff, where is that guy?

34:43.480 --> 34:45.480
Are we going to make this flight?

34:45.480 --> 34:47.480
What's Jeff doing?

34:47.480 --> 34:49.480
And so I go and I talk to the lady at the front.

34:49.480 --> 34:51.480
I'm like, I need three flights,

34:51.480 --> 34:53.480
like three seats on the next flight.

34:53.480 --> 34:55.480
She's like, there's only one first class seat

34:55.480 --> 34:57.480
for the next three flights to New York.

34:57.480 --> 34:59.480
I was like,

34:59.480 --> 35:01.480
I don't think I'm going to make it on this flight

35:01.480 --> 35:03.480
without losing one of my team.

35:03.480 --> 35:05.480
So I called.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.480
I just want to pause here and point out

35:07.480 --> 35:09.480
that a podcast flying

35:09.480 --> 35:11.480
across a first world country

35:11.480 --> 35:13.480
to do a 90 minute show

35:13.480 --> 35:15.480
shouldn't have a casualty ratio

35:15.480 --> 35:17.480
as high as a police action

35:17.480 --> 35:19.480
in the 70s

35:19.480 --> 35:21.480
in a third world country.

35:21.480 --> 35:23.480
Like, oh, I think

35:23.480 --> 35:25.480
like, Spencer's like,

35:25.480 --> 35:27.480
you guys get on the plane.

35:27.480 --> 35:29.480
I'm like, yeah, there's some casualties.

35:29.480 --> 35:31.480
There's like seven of us

35:31.480 --> 35:33.480
came. Five of us are going to be

35:33.480 --> 35:35.480
at JFK.

35:35.480 --> 35:37.480
Yeah. So I was like,

35:37.480 --> 35:39.480
I had to make a decision. It's like, do I try to find

35:39.480 --> 35:41.480
Jeff or do I just try to get Cody on this flight?

35:41.480 --> 35:43.480
The woman at the front was like,

35:43.480 --> 35:45.480
you got to do your best at getting her on the flight.

35:45.480 --> 35:47.480
Just don't have her say a word.

35:47.480 --> 35:49.480
Try to make her walk as best

35:49.480 --> 35:51.480
as she can.

35:51.480 --> 35:53.480
And you can do it.

35:53.480 --> 35:55.480
You can get her on this flight.

35:55.480 --> 35:57.480
Everyone's rooting for you guys.

35:57.480 --> 35:59.480
You can get her on the flight.

35:59.480 --> 36:01.480
So I go to Cody. I was like, Codes,

36:01.480 --> 36:03.480
we got to go board this flight. We're going to be late.

36:03.480 --> 36:05.480
She's like, all right, let's do it.

36:05.480 --> 36:07.480
I'm really tired. I got a pee.

36:07.480 --> 36:09.480
I was like, we got to just wait.

36:09.480 --> 36:11.480
We got to wait until we get on the flight.

36:11.480 --> 36:13.480
She's like, can I wear my glasses?

36:13.480 --> 36:15.480
You better wear those glasses.

36:15.480 --> 36:17.480
You look so fucking cool.

36:17.480 --> 36:19.480
So I stand Cody up.

36:19.480 --> 36:21.480
She staggers a little bit.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.480
I'm like, here, here, hold my arm.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.480
And so I lead her to the elevator.

36:25.480 --> 36:27.480
I'm like, where's Jeff?

36:27.480 --> 36:29.480
Do these glasses make me look as cool

36:29.480 --> 36:31.480
as I think they do?

36:31.480 --> 36:33.480
And we're walking to the gate

36:33.480 --> 36:35.480
and

36:35.480 --> 36:37.480
we walk up to the guy

36:37.480 --> 36:39.480
and I'm like, can we scan in?

36:39.480 --> 36:41.480
He was like, yeah, I'm holding

36:41.480 --> 36:43.480
Cody's boarding pass so that she doesn't have to

36:43.480 --> 36:45.480
do anything. She's holding my arm

36:45.480 --> 36:47.480
very quietly. She knows exactly

36:47.480 --> 36:49.480
what she's doing too, like a child.

36:49.480 --> 36:51.480
She's like playing this game.

36:51.480 --> 36:53.480
I get scanned in and as soon as we hit

36:53.480 --> 36:55.480
the bridge to the plane,

36:55.480 --> 36:57.480
she goes, I killed it.

37:01.480 --> 37:03.480
They didn't know.

37:03.480 --> 37:05.480
They didn't know.

37:05.480 --> 37:07.480
And they didn't know.

37:07.480 --> 37:09.480
But then the first thing she does is

37:09.480 --> 37:11.480
she turns around and bumps the guy in front of us

37:11.480 --> 37:13.480
because there's still line to board the flight.

37:13.480 --> 37:15.480
And I was like, Cody, you can't.

37:15.480 --> 37:17.480
Please don't do that.

37:17.480 --> 37:19.480
I still can't get a hold of Jeff.

37:19.480 --> 37:21.480
She bumps the guy again.

37:21.480 --> 37:23.480
And then I leaned her up against that wall.

37:23.480 --> 37:25.480
She sees the baby. She does the thing like,

37:25.480 --> 37:27.480
oh, look at this fucking baby.

37:27.480 --> 37:29.480
And then she unzips her thing and then

37:29.480 --> 37:31.480
there was no buffer.

37:31.480 --> 37:33.480
She didn't go, look at this fucking baby.

37:33.480 --> 37:35.480
Hey, baby, admit it.

37:35.480 --> 37:37.480
You wish I was your mom.

37:37.480 --> 37:39.480
It was like about

37:39.480 --> 37:41.480
a three second between baby

37:41.480 --> 37:43.480
and me going,

37:43.480 --> 37:45.480
and this action.

37:47.480 --> 37:49.480
But then I walked her on the flight and Dan was like,

37:49.480 --> 37:51.480
oh, I don't.

37:51.480 --> 37:53.480
I sit her down.

37:53.480 --> 37:55.480
He's like, what the hell is happening?

37:55.480 --> 37:57.480
Where's Jeff?

37:57.480 --> 37:59.480
I sit in my seat. I'm calling everybody.

37:59.480 --> 38:01.480
I call Spencer.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.480
I'm like, are flights about to take off?

38:03.480 --> 38:05.480
Please, can you call like TSA and see if they

38:05.480 --> 38:07.480
they have Jeff

38:07.480 --> 38:09.480
in a room somewhere?

38:09.480 --> 38:11.480
While he's doing that,

38:11.480 --> 38:13.480
I'm calling the LAX police going,

38:13.480 --> 38:15.480
have you guys seen my friend Jeff Davis?

38:15.480 --> 38:17.480
They haven't. I go to the front of the plane.

38:17.480 --> 38:19.480
And she's like,

38:19.480 --> 38:21.480
well, who is it? They look it up

38:21.480 --> 38:23.480
and they're like, he didn't check in.

38:23.480 --> 38:25.480
And I was like, that's not possible.

38:25.480 --> 38:27.480
I checked him in on the computer.

38:27.480 --> 38:29.480
And I printed his boarding pass.

38:29.480 --> 38:31.480
She's like, well, they already lifted his seat.

38:31.480 --> 38:33.480
They already gave his seat away.

38:33.480 --> 38:35.480
And I was like, okay, well,

38:35.480 --> 38:37.480
I don't know.

38:37.480 --> 38:39.480
The LAX police didn't have him.

38:39.480 --> 38:41.480
And we took off.

38:41.480 --> 38:43.480
And you just said, hail Mary.

38:43.480 --> 38:45.480
Jeff called me just as the plane was moving.

38:45.480 --> 38:47.480
I was like, hey,

38:47.480 --> 38:49.480
where are you?

38:49.480 --> 38:51.480
Where are you?

38:51.480 --> 38:53.480
Play the message.

38:53.480 --> 38:55.480
Can you play the message alone?

38:55.480 --> 38:57.480
Yeah.

38:57.480 --> 38:59.480
Oh, no.

38:59.480 --> 39:01.480
It's not embarrassing.

39:01.480 --> 39:03.480
Jeff doesn't like this.

39:03.480 --> 39:05.480
Think of everything that we just told you.

39:05.480 --> 39:07.480
And then this is Jeff's explanation.

39:07.480 --> 39:09.480
I was like, Jeff, we're about to take off.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.480
We're about to take off.

39:11.480 --> 39:13.480
He's like, I can't hear you.

39:13.480 --> 39:15.480
This is the last time you see someone

39:15.480 --> 39:17.480
who's outside a subarrow

39:17.480 --> 39:19.480
in a Logan's Run complex

39:19.480 --> 39:21.480
that is illegal to

39:21.480 --> 39:23.480
cross certain thresholds

39:23.480 --> 39:25.480
where everything is so official.

39:25.480 --> 39:27.480
But you don't expect horns to be honking.

39:27.480 --> 39:29.480
The next time you hear from them.

39:29.480 --> 39:31.480
Dance Texting Me like, where is Jeff?

39:31.480 --> 39:33.480
And I'm like, he's on the street somewhere.

39:33.480 --> 39:35.480
There's a lot of honking in the background.

39:35.480 --> 39:37.480
I was impressed.

39:37.480 --> 39:39.480
He's the new Amelia Earhard.

39:39.480 --> 39:41.480
How did he get from a plane to a street?

39:41.480 --> 39:49.320
and that's illegal he he so he calls me he he keeps calling me he can't hear me

39:49.320 --> 39:54.400
can't hear me I was like text me and then he calls me one last time he goes

39:54.400 --> 39:58.000
like hey I'm gonna get on the next flight and then he called me again and

39:58.000 --> 40:02.520
he left me this message while I was mid-flight and we got it when I landed

40:02.520 --> 40:20.640
let's see oh I'm on flight 1420 from LAX to New York GFK oh someone called Steve

40:20.640 --> 40:26.280
it fucked it up sorry everybody I mean the point is this thing Jeff goes hey

40:26.280 --> 40:43.440
sorry I flaked out 11 30 p.m. so he was fine and we were right so the

40:43.440 --> 40:48.720
question is what's scarier you know the Cody version where it's like holy shit

40:48.720 --> 40:53.600
you had too much to drink your King Kong the government has to be like but

40:53.600 --> 40:59.720
meanwhile like a very frightening level of like he's like Denzel Washington and

40:59.720 --> 41:07.480
is he is that after he got woke up by cops yes so he's just like yeah so a

41:07.480 --> 41:15.680
little bit of a fucking spot of bother yeah nothing I can't handle baby it's

41:15.680 --> 41:26.720
in the way I fell asleep I was sleepy time Davis I was I spaced out I spaced

41:26.720 --> 41:31.920
out and all whilst you're going I mean that's the best you know when you

41:31.920 --> 41:37.000
space out we've all been there when you spaced out and then wake up on the

41:37.000 --> 41:44.440
street corner the cops poking you saying what city are you in it made me like

41:44.440 --> 41:48.520
rewind it since we've been like how many times you've said you've spaced out to

41:48.520 --> 41:55.040
me you space out sometimes we all space I fell asleep Rob while walking

41:55.040 --> 42:02.400
somewhere I was sleeping if I got I went through security and I thought you

42:02.400 --> 42:06.840
know what this seems like a bad flight to be on I don't like the vibe and I

42:06.840 --> 42:11.080
thought I'm gonna go out and sleep this one off yeah there's gonna be another

42:11.080 --> 42:15.720
flight and now we're talking to be good if you get sleepy while you're walking

42:15.720 --> 42:24.880
you might be a space neck all right a space fuck me for anticipating a laugh

42:24.880 --> 42:30.960
volume I should know better than that thank you for that valuable lesson okay

42:30.960 --> 42:43.680
now that we explained how we got here let's start the show okay from beautiful

42:43.680 --> 42:53.200
downtown New York it's Harmontown yeah I here's some things that Cody's doing

42:53.200 --> 42:58.000
when she's not offering a baby her breast on a random flight she she

42:58.000 --> 43:01.720
introducing me to this high maintenance show it's like you guys like

43:01.720 --> 43:05.600
high maintenance or New Yorkers I love that show I just wanted to I just wanted

43:05.600 --> 43:09.560
to signal boost it you seen this show high maintenance no I haven't what's it

43:09.560 --> 43:16.720
about it's like a like an anthology it's it's like like a lot of good shit the

43:16.720 --> 43:21.520
pitch doesn't go is a oh what a clever idea it's an anthology it's like a drug

43:21.520 --> 43:26.800
dealer in New York and like all of his it kind of like weaves through the lives

43:26.800 --> 43:31.400
of his customers and stuff and then his life as well but it's just really like

43:31.400 --> 43:34.600
it's just a good show does he sell different drugs I thought it was just

43:34.600 --> 43:38.320
weed it's mostly yeah it's weed okay yeah I've never watched it I mean I don't

43:38.320 --> 43:41.600
I don't they were there I didn't see every episode there might be stories about

43:41.600 --> 43:45.880
how maybe he can hook you up with Molly I don't know yeah but next season it's

43:45.880 --> 43:48.960
just really well it's just really really really exciting you think we can talk to

43:48.960 --> 43:53.520
somebody here at the Tribeca Performing Arts Center about buying this desk so we

43:53.520 --> 43:57.120
can bring us back to LA so Spencer can oh yeah Spencer can always be at that

43:57.120 --> 44:02.480
thing I like it here's a question that was asked in my hotel room but I think

44:02.480 --> 44:07.160
it's been asked in the podcast before I must have been Cody that asked it does

44:07.160 --> 44:12.600
Spencer's dick have a beard is that that sounds fake and made up that really

44:12.600 --> 44:16.120
happened there's a real question but I don't think I don't think she expected

44:16.120 --> 44:21.280
the answer yes yeah I think we're all dicks kind of have beards we were doing

44:21.280 --> 44:24.200
it we were doing a call back to the fact that we were ended up in a conversation

44:24.200 --> 44:27.960
oh shit

44:29.960 --> 44:32.440
she's already hangin' here everybody

44:32.440 --> 44:38.440
no no no we got places to go at the show

44:38.440 --> 44:46.400
the vodka back no no no go to sleep do you sleep do you feel okay about the

44:46.400 --> 44:50.880
coverage go to sleep wait didn't somebody then what was the person next to you

44:50.880 --> 44:54.880
said thank you like I asked you at the end of the flight about like having to

44:54.880 --> 44:58.880
sit next to her right yeah there was a guy like Cody Cody bolted up out of the

44:58.880 --> 45:01.600
seat as we were landing you know and at that point when everyone's got to get up

45:01.600 --> 45:05.160
to the you know stand up and Cody was immediately befriending the flight

45:05.160 --> 45:09.280
attendants and talking to them and you could you could kind of just hear her

45:09.280 --> 45:13.360
voice wafting back through the plane and at that point that another guy in

45:13.360 --> 45:18.960
first class looked at me and in a kind of like male bonding like or fellow

45:18.960 --> 45:23.920
traveler kind of thing was like you had to deal with that the whole flight big

45:23.920 --> 45:29.800
but because he didn't the I sent in me deal because I what he saw was he thought

45:29.800 --> 45:34.880
we were strange he thought he unloaded my fucking no man's sky laptop and my

45:34.880 --> 45:40.720
Xbox controller and like and then he saw everyone's aunt to get on the plane and

45:40.720 --> 45:46.760
plopped out and be like what's going on and and he probably never saw or heard

45:46.760 --> 45:51.760
any indication that we actually knew each other so he thought it was like I

45:51.760 --> 45:57.760
was in a planes trains and automobiles stitch but then he was like I nailed it

45:57.760 --> 46:01.440
I think I nailed the whole thing like I stand by what I said in that fucking

46:01.440 --> 46:08.520
bridge killed it like people people were digging my vibe like I was it was fun

46:08.520 --> 46:16.960
it was energetic no I don't remember you don't remember anyone not digging your

46:16.960 --> 46:23.680
that is true and I gotta tell you that's like look all's well that ends well

46:23.680 --> 46:30.680
best sex we ever had later when we checked into the hotel thank you Dan thank

46:30.680 --> 46:34.280
you okay but I did I actually came up here to clarify something else I don't

46:34.280 --> 46:38.880
really care about that story but yes I did for real ask if your dick had a beard

46:38.880 --> 46:42.920
okay well do you want to know the context of it well do you because you

46:42.920 --> 46:48.680
obviously people at pubic air I know but I guess I was wondering if yours yes I

46:48.680 --> 46:54.120
know this wasn't this while you were having sex with Dan no this is where

46:54.120 --> 47:00.320
I said best sex I ever had so that's a tip for you out tonight go home and talk

47:00.320 --> 47:06.920
about me ask me ask me more questions about Spencer's dick it was because

47:06.920 --> 47:11.720
earlier I had a beard do you think it has a beard it was because I don't know I

47:11.720 --> 47:18.560
don't know oh oh it was because earlier I asked if your dick floats in the bath

47:18.560 --> 47:24.440
oh yeah I remember that if it floats up like I wanted to know and Dan I don't

47:24.440 --> 47:28.880
know the time frame lines up Dan said must be nice because yeah everybody's

47:28.880 --> 47:33.680
always look I wasn't saying that yours wouldn't float right do you think do you

47:33.680 --> 47:41.480
think do you think I have a micro penis no you perfectly sized penis for human

47:41.480 --> 47:47.120
small pair of players yes you get you get you get a badge when we have that

47:47.120 --> 47:51.880
conversation and I get to be a toothpick I'd still want to know like I'm nailing

47:51.880 --> 47:58.400
it I guess it doesn't it doesn't matter okay found each other and I love it I

47:58.400 --> 48:03.240
love it you know how much I love it in fact on the way here you took a shower

48:03.240 --> 48:07.440
and while you were in the shower I was saying you know wash that dick dick

48:07.440 --> 48:11.880
extra good cuz I'm gonna suck on it later and then I and I and I heated that

48:11.880 --> 48:16.560
call working on it for like I conditioned it I'm ready first you

48:16.560 --> 48:20.720
refuse I'm looking forward to it this is usually a point of anxiety with

48:20.720 --> 48:27.840
previous lovers I'm looking forward to sex so I mean to you baby it's what my

48:27.840 --> 48:35.760
puke is gonna throw up right now but Spencer said that his dick does float in

48:35.760 --> 48:49.320
the water yes yes float yes no float no no float okay that's what I thought all

48:49.320 --> 48:54.000
the ladies out there with pendulous breasts which is a clinical term for the

48:54.000 --> 48:58.520
kind of breasts that like you know you can put a pencil under like some women

48:58.520 --> 49:01.320
don't have those kind of breasts they have just like pert little breasts you

49:01.320 --> 49:05.600
know I have the kind of pendulous breasts that in the water they get extra

49:05.600 --> 49:08.800
buoyant and they float so I was wondering if men have the same kind of

49:08.800 --> 49:14.200
experience right and they do oh well not doing yours does I think yours does but

49:14.200 --> 49:22.800
when your dick is basically a nipple you can send me to Mars send me let's skydive

49:22.800 --> 49:26.440
with me what's your dick doing I just wouldn't hear these conversations what

49:26.440 --> 49:30.320
was your what's your dick look like in a botanical dome and I'm just like this is

49:30.320 --> 49:33.920
more evidence the fact that this is a question for anyone means I have a really

49:33.920 --> 49:37.560
small dick because I this wouldn't be a question of everyone's dick look like mine

49:37.560 --> 49:42.120
can you you would never you would never be like does it float what do you mean

49:42.120 --> 49:48.400
it's a like it's a it's a pepperoni in a fucking turtleneck it's like a it's a

49:48.400 --> 49:55.160
it's an alien mandible that when in need when it's agitated when it's time to

49:55.160 --> 50:04.680
strike an impressive rick baker effect happens but not so impressive that I

50:04.680 --> 50:10.480
then in the realm of these people who apparently well flaccid have a floaty

50:10.480 --> 50:14.920
dick and it's not on top of the water it's just being upwardly mobile it's

50:14.920 --> 50:19.360
it's moving up it's trying to get there I picture your penis is so long no you're

50:19.360 --> 50:23.200
sitting in a bathtub and the head it's just like a pool it goes up like a

50:23.200 --> 50:28.040
bobber when you're fishing yeah no it's just floating and then like the rest of

50:28.040 --> 50:35.320
it is like a kite string no no Rob I couldn't does he dick float yeah yeah I

50:35.320 --> 50:40.840
just assume you guys were talking about I know I got a great big dick that's why

50:40.840 --> 50:43.360
I started thinking about it because you took a bath and I asked if you dick floated

50:43.360 --> 50:47.480
first you said you said did you use bubble bath and I said no he said so you

50:47.480 --> 50:54.760
just looked at your dick and I go yeah why do you think I took a bath okay well

50:54.760 --> 51:02.520
so I could have been I had I had a really profound therapy session before I

51:02.520 --> 51:07.640
came to New York because I've had a rough year and rough year for me means

51:07.640 --> 51:15.000
nothing but I was you know my therapist is privy to you know the little

51:15.000 --> 51:19.760
labyrinthine thing I've been going through and all the stuff and we really

51:19.760 --> 51:24.720
talked about it and I this all does relate because I kind of like she was

51:24.720 --> 51:28.040
asked she's like all right so all the shit's over with all the stuff that you

51:28.040 --> 51:31.560
were thinking at like are we're what is what do you what are you doing this

51:31.560 --> 51:34.160
weekend I'm like I'm going to New York doing the show that she's got all these

51:34.160 --> 51:37.400
questions as like what you going to New York what are you worried about going

51:37.400 --> 51:41.120
when you do a show in New York what are you worried about being in public or

51:41.120 --> 51:44.240
whatever I'm like what are these questions I don't even understand like

51:44.240 --> 51:47.560
what is your perception of me it goes in this guy look here's how I feel about

51:47.560 --> 51:55.280
this stuff right now I don't I feel like for a year I have not been able to do

51:55.280 --> 51:58.960
what I've done all my life again which I said on my last episode which is just

51:58.960 --> 52:07.440
talk like and and stay feeling safe because of the venting of the shame and

52:07.440 --> 52:10.440
letting people know where I'm at and all this stuff and I you know I started to

52:10.440 --> 52:17.240
get it was like it was I came I came through that session because she made

52:17.240 --> 52:26.040
me understand that she's like so you've been selling for 44 years this product

52:26.040 --> 52:33.480
called I don't care and that's been very comfortable for you and what you're

52:33.480 --> 52:40.520
really upset about right now is that you care and you resent people for making

52:40.520 --> 52:44.600
you feel that way and you resent the ramifications of that all the stuff and

52:44.600 --> 52:50.280
like hearing her kind of like parse it in this way I what I came around to was

52:50.280 --> 52:55.520
oh shit so my job is not whether or not I should keep doing this or not doing it

52:55.520 --> 53:03.160
or whatever it's like vulnerability is a good thing yeah it's a thing that I've

53:03.160 --> 53:07.400
been allergic to like when I went whenever I was on a playground and I

53:07.400 --> 53:12.360
would get beat up by the bully sometimes I'd fight back sometimes I'd take the

53:12.360 --> 53:19.120
punches so hard that the bully would start to freak out sometimes I'd just

53:19.120 --> 53:24.480
cry and piss my pants but but like like in any of those cases the only thing

53:24.480 --> 53:28.720
that actually fucked me up was when the well-intended person would come up

53:28.720 --> 53:32.360
behind me and go hey what are you doing why are you doing that to this guy and

53:32.360 --> 53:37.400
then the bully would go cuz he's dirty and his hair's nappy and he smells like

53:37.400 --> 53:42.000
a fish and and I and then it's not that's not what would I already knew

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
that's why I was getting the beating I was like I co-signed on that yeah it's

53:45.000 --> 53:52.200
I'm definitely not showering for this kind of person so let the beatings

53:52.200 --> 53:58.680
begin and whoa be to he who says enough it's I think that was some kind of from

53:58.680 --> 54:05.320
Macbeth the the thing that would make me cry is when that nice person would come

54:05.320 --> 54:10.160
up behind and then say to that bully go so what if he doesn't comb his hair so

54:10.160 --> 54:14.280
what if he smells like a fish that doesn't make him a bad person you're a

54:14.280 --> 54:17.760
mean person you're the one beating people up you shouldn't beat people up

54:17.760 --> 54:23.800
just because they smell like fish that would make me want to murder the guy

54:23.800 --> 54:28.200
sticking up for me and it would make me more importantly like want to get out

54:28.200 --> 54:32.720
of there who would make me really really sad it was the thing that hurt about

54:32.720 --> 54:39.200
getting beaten up it what not the beating like I fetishized getting beaten I

54:39.200 --> 54:44.280
fetishize the numbness I fetishize the abuse I was like like don't just don't

54:44.280 --> 54:49.960
ever ever fucking try to convince me that I'm vulnerable and because

54:49.960 --> 54:55.560
vulnerability means destruction but no it doesn't that's the thing that I

54:55.560 --> 55:00.840
recalibrated and so I just like these relationships between shame vulnerability

55:00.840 --> 55:06.120
and existence and what our job is what bravery is all this stuff I finally came

55:06.120 --> 55:11.640
out of that going okay so vulnerability is good it's actually good to tell

55:11.640 --> 55:15.880
people here's what here's what I'm embarrassed about here's what here's what

55:15.880 --> 55:20.360
makes me feel bad here's how you can actually hurt me here's the amount of

55:20.360 --> 55:25.840
pain that I'm feeling those are those that that's a good thing to to share

55:25.840 --> 55:32.960
that stuff it's a bad thing to let trauma push you back and cause you to

55:32.960 --> 55:39.120
start getting more and more practical that's called PTSD it's it's it's like

55:39.120 --> 55:44.040
it you experience a random piece of chaos that makes you wonder what the

55:44.040 --> 55:48.480
fuck you've been your whole life and then your solution is to limit your

55:48.480 --> 55:52.680
experience to a little straw so that the distance between the cup and your mouth

55:52.680 --> 55:57.520
doesn't have as much of an opportunity to be fucking violated again that's

55:57.520 --> 56:03.160
that's chaos winning that's that's cycle of abuse that's that's that's that's

56:03.160 --> 56:09.480
the problem and it's natural and it's good but like I finally figured it out

56:09.480 --> 56:13.760
like for this last year I've been like what am I what am I doing on this show

56:13.760 --> 56:19.960
what am I supposed to be doing I like like like if there's things that that

56:19.960 --> 56:26.840
talking about them actually helps Nazis like like then what what that so then

56:26.840 --> 56:31.080
might so then the way you fight Nazis is you pretend they're not Nazis and all

56:31.080 --> 56:34.440
this shit just like like the spiral of thought and all this shit with this

56:34.440 --> 56:38.600
fucking like mentally ill people weaponized by 4chan trolls and people

56:38.600 --> 56:42.560
like doing their best to try to get me fired and all this shit all of the

56:42.560 --> 56:47.440
experiences that I've gone through this last year the common theme has been well

56:47.440 --> 56:51.040
I know one thing's for sure the worst thing you could ever do is go out there

56:51.040 --> 56:56.280
and talk about it because and that I that it's been true that's a true thing

56:56.280 --> 57:03.360
and so it's it completely fucked me up but I now I got it I think I got it and

57:03.360 --> 57:08.080
I'm sharing this now because I'm pretty sure Jeff is probably pretty embarrassed

57:08.080 --> 57:16.920
that he he's such a 70s family feud drunkard that he that he can fall asleep

57:16.920 --> 57:24.920
on his feet and end up in the clutches of the police outside LAX but like I I

57:24.920 --> 57:30.560
you know I want I want you supported in that vulnerability I know what you

57:30.560 --> 57:36.000
punished for it I and I don't I don't I think if I were to enter your head I'd

57:36.000 --> 57:39.560
be like well don't talk to you frankly about this stuff because then when it

57:39.560 --> 57:43.000
comes down to whether or not you're this or that and whether you should quit

57:43.000 --> 57:46.000
doing this or quit doing that then everyone else has all the power because

57:46.000 --> 57:50.280
they're all weighing in on your life and all that shit but no that's not true we

57:50.280 --> 57:56.520
can continue to be pathologically unapologetic self exploratory narcissistic

57:56.520 --> 58:01.800
fucking sociopathic messes I think we have to double down now more than ever

58:01.800 --> 58:07.520
about what we find in our navel every morning if you're gay right now can I

58:07.520 --> 58:13.960
ask a favor of you could you please be more gay in everything that you say and

58:13.960 --> 58:17.880
everything that you do if you're if you're if you're a person of color can

58:17.880 --> 58:21.800
you and then you happen to have a distaste for identity politics could you

58:21.800 --> 58:25.920
find a little bit of a love for it just to antagonize the kinds of people that

58:25.920 --> 58:33.000
want to that so that we can draw battle lines between those who want shame to

58:33.000 --> 58:39.320
grow on trees and those who want to overcome it because that battle will

58:39.320 --> 58:44.840
be won by the people who oppose shame and but but this battle that we're

58:44.840 --> 58:49.560
fighting right now where it's like who should be more ashamed that well guess

58:49.560 --> 58:55.360
who's gonna win shame mongers shame experts yeah but I'm right to feel

58:55.360 --> 58:59.320
ashamed about my behavior today or last night last night Jeff how dare you imply

58:59.320 --> 59:05.120
that I've met read you wrong fuck you no I mean like it's I wasn't sure if I

59:05.120 --> 59:09.240
wanted to discuss this tonight because it is embarrassing but it happened and

59:09.240 --> 59:13.560
it and talking about it out loud makes me want to improve myself right not do

59:13.560 --> 59:20.600
that again like that's really really fucking bad it's really shady so weird

59:20.600 --> 59:24.760
cuz like I honestly hearing the story I was like standing back there hearing it

59:24.760 --> 59:30.760
about me and I was like fucking sounds so cool I'm fucking I'm fucking a fan of

59:30.760 --> 59:35.240
my I didn't even know I could say and do such cool shit I was wearing this

59:35.240 --> 59:41.120
fucking jumpsuit that I remember I remember peeing and a sleeve might have

59:41.120 --> 59:45.200
brushed the just the top of the water because for it to the jumpsuit you have

59:45.200 --> 59:49.520
to take off the whole thing and and sit down and you're like naked on top you

59:49.520 --> 59:54.560
know when you pee and I definitely remember being like remember not to let

59:54.560 --> 01:00:01.560
the sleeve go in the water and then I don't remember anything else up to that

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:08.960
anyway but I honestly you know I thought it was a win for most of us oh

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:15.280
yeah no we did it leavey I give you so I mean you know I love you man I don't

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:21.720

are real piece of shit though I didn't do anything I just was like oh god all

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:31.600
right I guess I'm ashamed of that I didn't I didn't help out what is a little

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.520
red pouch that you're holding Rob you've been holding a strange like kind of

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:42.560
leatherette this pouchy is my excuse me oh your glasses

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:52.720
I put my glasses in it oh have I ever told you guys that I've known Rob Schrab

01:00:52.720 --> 01:01:00.560
for 70 years whatever it is 72 72 on Monday and and he still maintains he's

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:08.040
never bothered to let this go that he one of the many neurotypical things that

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:17.200
he hates like Pictionary big words he hates you know he's like he absolutely

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:22.040
hates the happy birthday song and the crazy thing is it's about to be his

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:28.640
birthday and since we're here at the Metropolitan Opera House I I thought we

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:35.200
should we should make Rob kill himself by singing him happy birthday happy birthday

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:05.040
hey hey hey $25,000 for that Dan do you want to sing in the car now it's

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.480

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:15.560
sisters that own the right yeah TV thing with happy birthday that like it used

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:18.800
to cost a lot of money so that's why I'm like a lot of TV shows when they sing

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:24.080
the happy birthday song it's like a fake it's like happy happy birthday

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:29.200
Dan do you want to sing rock community when we fade in and it's Troy's birthday

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:36.920
they go to you and then on top of it and then the character goes like I don't

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:47.040
understand that song why why what do you mean to you because I'm a genius and it

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:52.040
was great it was a great episode but but I did I hear the crazy thing is that the

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:56.920
happy birthday song now it's Kleenex now anyone can just fucking come in it

01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:03.560
whatever you want but Mickey Mouse turns a hundred and seventy-five and it's you

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:10.320
know it's time to re-examine America's copyright laws I thought that was

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:13.840
amazing remember that happened it was like Mickey Mouse is about to be come as

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:19.960
old as Mark Twain novels like like like you you you're about to be able to do

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:25.040
whatever the fuck you want to Mickey Mouse and the entire establishment was

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:32.640
like well obviously we're gonna have that's not right and everyone react I

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:36.080
think yeah well what are you gonna do be able to like just use Mickey Mouse

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:40.800
that's not fair we all just rolled with it because well how would you protest

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:44.000
that like like what kind of group would that be what kind of Antifa would be

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:52.560
like out front of a building going like hey hey ho ho not letting me draw Mickey

01:03:52.560 --> 01:04:00.400
Mouse blowing the little mermaid has got to go and selling it as a t-shirt like

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:04.400
at Spencer's gifts not you all right let's sorry I could I've been drinking I

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:09.600
could be something all right Spencer's beard probably doesn't have a day so

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:14.600
yeah back to that what's what what do you mean like what's the beard part in

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:20.440
your mind and your conception that you would grow out your pubes like I don't

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:23.480
know that you would grow them out in a way that do the curtains not match the

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:27.920
tree well I do I do shave like the front three quarters of each ball wait it

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:31.560
curtains not to the drapes there wait wait what do you do I shave the three

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:36.320
quarters of each ball which each ball that sounds like you have more than two

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:42.280
right it gives it gives each of them a little beard we got we got we got it I

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:46.720
think like well only so here's what I heard I'm not on Twitter anymore so my

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:50.480
news comes through weird trickles I literally talked to people in a water

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:57.320
cooler now the Girl Scouts are suing the Boy Scouts because the Boy Scouts are

01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:03.880
dropping the boy part and therefore becoming scouts oh shit and so the Girl

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:12.320
Scouts are like fuck you you can't fucking horn in on our you can't

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:15.800
transition and then just invite yourself to our slumber party and start

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:20.680
talking about how dudes are full of shit like like like I was like the Girl

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:25.760
Scouts are that's what I that's what I heard isn't the Church of Satan suing

Netflix yeah yeah for what reason they use the image of boffo man who's boffo

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:39.120
man the Church of Satan in accordance to they have a boffo man boffo man is a

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:43.920
person or a building it's a it's a it's a depiction of Satan it's a depiction of

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:49.200
Satan this copy written well yeah it's copy written I mean a legend are you a

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:53.200

thinks it's at all cool is stupid well I'm sorry okay so okay next next here's

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:04.960
my here's my final tidbit that I learned at a party from our Swedish friend the

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:16.720
Swedish so so picture a swede are you are you picturing a diversity higher it's

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:21.640
just want to seed that because I was amazed to find out from our Swedish

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:28.840
friend that in Sweden there are now I'm gonna get a bunch I'm gonna butcher some

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:31.600
of this and some of you in a crowd this big are gonna be like no I know what

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:34.360
you're talking about and I actually know what I'm trying to try not to get too

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:45.280
agitated by my like thing but I there the Swedes are not oh gee Swedes like

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:50.640
they also like they moved into Sweden and there were people there that were

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:56.160
already Swedish who got marginalized and are hanging out and they still live

01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:02.840
there and it it's nothing any parallel you could they're called the Saa Saa Sami

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:07.840
Saa Saa Sama Spenska so I don't pronounce it but they they look like

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:15.400
old Navy Christmas elves from from they just they dress very festively in

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:21.600
Midwesterny they raise reindeer and they live in tents and they like I can't

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:25.320
would you pull up a picture of them they're just they also look like ABBA but

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:31.120
I guess their jaws are different or something I was so it was 2,000 years

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:36.480
ago that the Swedes showed up in Sweden and then these people then got pushed

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:44.640
aside I'm like you haven't fucked that problem out yet how well how much races

do want to let you know I have a pet peeve about this I don't

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:29.320
like that our society thinks it's totally fucking kosher this idea that

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:33.280
there's like a oh you go to prison which is supposed to be a bad place and I'm

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:36.120
not saying I'm not being a prude and saying let's stop making jokes about it

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:40.240
I think it's fucked up that we all have this like understanding that oh and then

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:44.440
when you get in there it's fucking horrible and like like in ways that make

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:48.840
no sense and that weren't ordered by a judge like you could get raped and you

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.200
could like get murdered and it all depends on whether or not you just and

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:55.440
we all just like go like yeah that's what prison is like because it should be a

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:59.240
bad place like come on these people fucking these are the only people you

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:06.760
caught and that showed up to court and were made themselves available to handcuffs

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:13.280
make a fucking life for them and but in the joint like it's probably this Alaska

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:21.520

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.400
always gonna be a drag let's stop accepting that that it's escape from

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:35.320
New York and that like oh where you're going I heard Bubba's gonna fuck your

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:39.720

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:48.440
better or stop joking that it's bad we should know jokes jokes smokes I'm

01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:52.920
saying we should we if we're gonna have the largest prison population in the

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:58.240
cut in the world we should start looking at prison the way we look at other

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:02.440
shit where we're like well you know here's you know like like tell them

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:07.440
America sent you like like the prison system is basically like a huge

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:12.000
gigantic fucking part of the American experience let's define ourselves by how

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.800
rehabilitative it is and how much it prepares you to be the next Elon Musk

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:23.240
like let's like like show people show the world go like just do grand larceny

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:28.160

Tesla and fucking started his own play on most but like becoming the least

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:43.160
likable person like every time you read a new story about this guy he's just

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:47.680
becoming a bigger twat and there's like Nazis Jeff huh there's Nazis all right

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:52.520
I just get scared cuz I'm I truly use I believe it's possible for me to go to

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:56.600
prison I mean I was like fucking like like acting badass about searching my

01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:00.240
laptop to some TSA guy like if you're at the wrong place at the wrong time you

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:05.120
end up in prison like like the people are gonna say well Dean Harmon's in

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:08.480
prison and then they're gonna go well then you know it's probably gonna get

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:13.440
raped and I'm like like that imagine how that feels like when you're behind

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:18.960
like what do you mean probably gonna get what that's not on the menu that's

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:23.760
that should be a thing I sign up for that like like all right well okay

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:28.520
preaching to the choir or I don't know what you definitely sign up for prison

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:32.440
oh that's true we might be in like the new this I think this theater there's a

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:36.600
prison being built across the street and all of these guys live in the attic

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:41.360
and they're like come on fairs fair we don't want this prison

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:45.520
it's all local politics that's why there's crazy shit with prisons that you

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:49.200
know they're all owned by companies and shit yeah we should open a fucking

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:53.440
prison and make it the best fucking prison that people like I'll tell you a

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:59.880
little tidbit Harmon jail I got in trouble let's open a harm we just put

01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:07.080
bars on the society yeah all ourselves prisoners of we can say we were

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:12.760
locked away like this yeah yeah sure everybody's in the mood to follow me in

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:16.480
some gimmick for the podcast what you really they really got that moon moon

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:21.680
payoff what's your tip tidbit you said yeah I was saying like I I think I could

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:26.600
start a cool present because when I was a kid I got I got caught smoking a

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:30.800
cigarette in the parking lot at school in high school I was with three other

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:34.760
girls the principal vice principal walked down made eye contact with me saw

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:38.760
that I clearly was smoking but I had enough time to like warn my friends so

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:41.720
they put their cigarettes out and I took the fall for all them and like the

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:45.880
principal she fucking knew she like she in the office she was like look I have

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:49.120
to like call your parents it is a big thing but like I want to give you

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:52.040
props like I saw what you did back there cool on you you know like there was an

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:56.880
unspoken thing at least I think we like organized crime but what happened was

01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:02.400
since she felt you know I think sympathetic toward me she she was like

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:05.000
listen I'm not gonna suspend you I'm gonna make I'm gonna make this like

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.000
limited thing where it's just lunchtime detention and all of you guys are gonna

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.480
have to go cuz like I know you guys weren't even allowed to be in the parking

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:15.880
lot so it was like lunchtime detention in this room right we to go every

01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:19.520
day and eat lunch there by the end of the week people were fucking getting in

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:23.320
trouble on purpose to be part of lunch bunch we wound up having our own page in

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:28.880
our yearbook okay on is what I'm saying and part of it was at first people were

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:32.120
just coming to hang out with us and then it was like no you have to you to get

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:34.880
into lunch bunch you have to actually get into get into trouble because the

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:40.480
teacher mr. Sherrod was like he outlawed it and so then they were getting in

01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:51.840
trouble yeah mr. Sherrod I have a question so lunch bunch sounds like an

01:16:51.840 --> 01:17:00.600
awesome sequel to breakfast club and there's a dinner sinners and it is a

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:07.680
good but I mean really to that point which is the society supposed to well

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:11.720
at least the liberal side of society says you're supposed to be defined by the

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:17.720
treatment the experience as the lowest person right so like if what's this like

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:23.440
like if you if someone were to propose prison reform and say like oh when you

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:28.640
go to prison actually you get kind of a fucking break like this nightmare for

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:32.840
people are like fuck them it's like like isn't there this like really easy thick

01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:36.800
line or it's like well then do you sounds like you want to go to prison which

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:40.600
it's isn't the same with gay marriage and drugs and also there's always this

01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:44.720
debate between people who are like well what what then everyone just starts

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:49.040
smoking joints all the time what the fuck what's to stop me from smoking a

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:53.880
joint and that's always the other person I was trying to do is like sounds like

01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:59.240
you want to fucking smoke a joint or you're worried that if you do you're

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:02.960
gonna punch somebody or that you're not gonna or that you're gonna die or

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:06.280
that you think and it's like that with prison reform it's kind of like what is

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:12.200
our real worry that oh we're gonna if you grow up in a shitty neighborhood and

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:18.760
you end up sentenced of a crime and then you like oh we're worried that the

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:23.160
slippery slope is that everyone's gonna want to go to prison and like what if

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:27.200
you pushed that gas pedal down and we're like yeah make a society where

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:32.760
everyone wants to go to prison figure it out like like by the time you figure

01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:36.720
out how to create that society I think you're gonna have accidentally created

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:42.040
proper fixes itself because you're gonna be like well then why is it prison and

01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:46.640
then you're gonna be like yeah I come out of prison a better person is no I

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:49.800
don't know you don't know what I'm talking about you ruined everything I

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:55.760
was being so clear they were they were silent because I was being clear you

01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:59.920
ruined it that's the way I choose to remember this which I will not in 10

01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:04.120
minutes I'm sorry I ruined the show with my

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:07.480
pontifications about society but I feel like in my head there's like a

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:12.880
definition like the podcast 70% how we got here even though we were drunk and

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:18.280
then I choose to make 30% somehow educational or something it was good

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:26.400
it's a throwback to my 80s education that was like public access programming

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:30.640
was born of that they're guy well we'll give you a monopoly over television the

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:38.440
cable company but you have to let poor people use cameras it's fine it's a new

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:44.680
