{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:16.480\nFrom the Bureau of Manhattan Community College, Tribeca Performing Arts Senator, and the New\n\n00:16.480 --> 00:22.480\nYork Comedy Festival, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:22.480 --> 00:34.480\nHow about we introduce our Game Master, Mrs. Spencer Crittenden.\n\n00:34.480 --> 00:36.480\nHello.\n\n00:36.480 --> 00:38.480\nHello, Spencer.\n\n00:38.480 --> 00:40.480\nThank you.\n\n00:40.480 --> 00:43.480\nYou got a really adorable little desk there.\n\n00:43.480 --> 00:44.480\nOh, yeah.\n\n00:44.480 --> 00:46.480\nI'm owning my space.\n\n00:46.480 --> 01:01.480\nLet's bring out your Mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n01:01.480 --> 01:03.480\nBig Apple, not too small.\n\n01:03.480 --> 01:05.480\nBig Apple, buildings tall.\n\n01:05.480 --> 01:07.480\nLots of windows, lots of cars.\n\n01:07.480 --> 01:11.480\nHey, this city ours.\n\n01:11.480 --> 01:13.480\nGood to me.\n\n01:13.480 --> 01:17.480\nOh, all the New York history.\n\n01:17.480 --> 01:24.480\nGeorge Washington once invaded.\n\n01:24.480 --> 01:25.480\nThe River.\n\n01:25.480 --> 01:28.480\nThe Third Street.\n\n01:28.480 --> 01:33.480\nPatrick Henry had a birthday here.\n\n01:33.480 --> 01:37.480\nDan, you want to give us a little, some of your, your, your known as kind of a New York,\n\n01:37.480 --> 01:40.480\nlike, kind of a, kind of a guide.\n\n01:40.480 --> 01:43.480\nYou're like the Anthony Bourdain of New York.\n\n01:43.480 --> 01:45.480\nYou know that podcast, The Bowery Boys.\n\n01:45.480 --> 01:48.480\nYou know, it's like a podcast and they talk about New York.\n\n01:48.480 --> 01:50.480\nThe Living Thriving New York.\n\n01:50.480 --> 01:55.480\nThat's the, when I listen to those guys, I'm like, it'd be nice if they knew a thing or two about the city.\n\n01:55.480 --> 01:56.480\nRight.\n\n01:56.480 --> 02:00.480\nWhere can I get the best spats?\n\n02:00.480 --> 02:01.480\nSpats.\n\n02:01.480 --> 02:06.480\n1853, right at the prime when Central Park was just a cattle ranch.\n\n02:06.480 --> 02:08.480\nThat's when the spat was invented.\n\n02:08.480 --> 02:13.480\nWhat happened is General MacArthur, who used, it was part of the Sugar Trust.\n\n02:13.480 --> 02:14.480\nRight.\n\n02:14.480 --> 02:19.480\nHe wanted to figure out a way to turn shoes into boots.\n\n02:19.480 --> 02:26.480\nBecause a lot of people don't understand us, but the sodium street lights were highly combustible.\n\n02:26.480 --> 02:34.480\nAnd so it was a sign of wealth if you were singed.\n\n02:34.480 --> 02:41.480\nBecause Fifth Avenue was basically a, before it was a candy bar, it was a fire hazard.\n\n02:41.480 --> 02:44.480\nBut it was where the wealthy lived.\n\n02:44.480 --> 02:57.480\nAnd so boots were less popular than shoes because how could you survive a sodium streetlight fire with your boots intact?\n\n02:57.480 --> 03:08.480\nSo the wealthy liked to wear shoes, which a lot of people don't know this, where shoes were invented.\n\n03:08.480 --> 03:12.480\nA shoe is a burnt boot.\n\n03:12.480 --> 03:16.480\nA shoe doesn't make any sense.\n\n03:16.480 --> 03:18.480\nEverything was a boot.\n\n03:18.480 --> 03:22.480\nAnd then this fashion thing happened where you needed to look like you were in a fire.\n\n03:22.480 --> 03:26.480\nSo the more of the top of your shoe that was burnt off meant you were a sign of wealth.\n\n03:26.480 --> 03:43.480\nThe more, the nearer the Rockefellers you were, who in that day you could see dancing at the Green Mile over on Third and Crenshaw.\n\n03:43.480 --> 04:00.480\nYou know there were only three boroughs back then representing the two gangs of New York and of course the unofficial mayor of New York at that time, Butterfinger,\n\n04:00.480 --> 04:06.480\nButterfinger boss Todd and his famously corrupt mayor.\n\n04:06.480 --> 04:10.480\nYou were talking earlier then about why they call Wall Street Wall Street.\n\n04:10.480 --> 04:15.480\nRight. Well it was originally a wall.\n\n04:15.480 --> 04:19.480\nIt wasn't a street because it's where people were making money and you don't want a street there.\n\n04:19.480 --> 04:23.480\nPoor people follow streets. You don't want them to go where your money goes.\n\n04:23.480 --> 04:27.480\nAnd then there was a sort of like famous like squabble.\n\n04:27.480 --> 04:38.480\nThey threw a bunch of ticker tape into the harbor and the rich people said, what if it's a wall and a street and Wall Street was born?\n\n04:38.480 --> 04:44.480\nJust make it a street but we'll call it Wall Street because it means if you're here you're not welcome.\n\n04:44.480 --> 04:50.480\nNow go ahead. You can take your trolley. You can make your lightning bike.\n\n04:50.480 --> 04:55.480\nNew York history. I'm just full of it.\n\n04:55.480 --> 04:59.480\nWhere's the best place in town for you to get a nice Chinese hot pot?\n\n04:59.480 --> 05:05.480\nWell I know a lot of people will tell you never to go above a hundred and third.\n\n05:05.480 --> 05:11.480\nBut the truth is the Upper East is the new meat pack.\n\n05:11.480 --> 05:19.480\nAnd I will find myself right between 95 and 97 on the corner of A and A.\n\n05:19.480 --> 05:25.480\nThe best wontons in the Duplo.\n\n05:25.480 --> 05:29.480\nLook we don't have a lot of time. We're ripping through. This is a festival set.\n\n05:29.480 --> 05:36.480\nFor those of you listening at home you're going to be like, whoa this podcast is really impressive.\n\n05:36.480 --> 05:42.480\nNo we're just moving at a higher crisper pace because it's a festival energy.\n\n05:42.480 --> 05:48.480\nWe're in a packed house here. I think we're at the...\n\n05:48.480 --> 05:52.480\nThere's not a single empty seat.\n\n05:52.480 --> 05:55.480\nDon't look it up.\n\n05:55.480 --> 05:59.480\nI think tonight's attendance is 48,000 people.\n\n05:59.480 --> 06:04.480\nWe're at the Metropolitan Opera House and we couldn't be...\n\n06:04.480 --> 06:09.480\nA lot of you people could have been at Elton John tonight at the Madison Square Garden but no they chose to be here.\n\n06:09.480 --> 06:16.480\nAnd the fire department's been turning people away. They can't fit all that people in here.\n\n06:16.480 --> 06:23.480\nThere was not to make light of awful, awful current mass shootings or the mass shooting du jour.\n\n06:23.480 --> 06:26.480\nMaybe a little bit.\n\n06:26.480 --> 06:32.480\nWhat I think is odd is getting on a plane to go from California to New York\n\n06:32.480 --> 06:37.480\nand feeling safer because Griffith Park's on fire right now as we speak.\n\n06:37.480 --> 06:40.480\nMy house is about to maybe burn down.\n\n06:40.480 --> 06:44.480\nWe've been keeping eyes on that all day.\n\n06:44.480 --> 06:51.480\nIt just feels nice to come out to a nice quiet evening in New York.\n\n06:51.480 --> 06:55.480\nYeah man. We've got it under control.\n\n06:55.480 --> 06:59.480\nWhere the stops are frisked.\n\n06:59.480 --> 07:03.480\nSo at a certain point...\n\n07:03.480 --> 07:09.480\nNo guests. I'm not going to come to New York and bring out...\n\n07:09.480 --> 07:15.480\nHere's John Oliver. It easily could. That would be an easy thing I could do.\n\n07:15.480 --> 07:20.480\nButterfinger boss Todd is here tonight.\n\n07:20.480 --> 07:25.480\nBut it would take time. He'd be playing catch up and all this stuff.\n\n07:25.480 --> 07:29.480\nLook. I brought Rob Schrab. Let's bring him out.\n\n07:29.480 --> 07:32.480\nYeah.\n\n07:48.480 --> 07:51.480\nLook at this.\n\n07:51.480 --> 07:53.480\nHow does that feel?\n\n07:53.480 --> 07:56.480\nWhat the fuck is going on here?\n\n07:56.480 --> 08:00.480\nWhat?\n\n08:00.480 --> 08:04.480\nDid you bring enough gum for the rest of the class?\n\n08:04.480 --> 08:08.480\nWhat is the... For the listeners we're describing...\n\n08:08.480 --> 08:11.480\nThat's my dick.\n\n08:11.480 --> 08:15.480\nIt looks like a walker had sex with a desk.\n\n08:15.480 --> 08:18.480\nWhat is a little black plastic thing in front?\n\n08:18.480 --> 08:21.480\nMy dick's just popping out back here.\n\n08:21.480 --> 08:27.480\nWhere are you from? You're fucking kidding me.\n\n08:27.480 --> 08:30.480\nPhotos are good podcasting.\n\n08:30.480 --> 08:33.480\nI can't even take the picture. I can't even take the picture.\n\n08:33.480 --> 08:36.480\nHe really can't.\n\n08:36.480 --> 08:38.480\nWhat is the front plastic section of the...\n\n08:38.480 --> 08:41.480\nIt's to hide my dick.\n\n08:41.480 --> 08:44.480\nAnd the microphone is glued to the top?\n\n08:44.480 --> 08:46.480\nOr what?\n\n08:46.480 --> 08:49.480\nWhy would you think that? That's a stupid thing.\n\n08:49.480 --> 08:51.480\nTurn the desk upside down.\n\n08:51.480 --> 08:53.480\nNo, it's not stuck. Why would you think that?\n\n08:53.480 --> 08:55.480\nLift it up.\n\n08:59.480 --> 09:02.480\nDon't make me move to the next stool.\n\n09:02.480 --> 09:04.480\nOh, God.\n\n09:04.480 --> 09:07.480\nYou were saying, Dan, I'm so sorry.\n\n09:07.480 --> 09:09.480\nThis is kind of a rear show.\n\n09:09.480 --> 09:11.480\nIt's not the first time coming to New York.\n\n09:11.480 --> 09:14.480\nWe take the show on the road. We love going places.\n\n09:14.480 --> 09:21.480\nThis is probably the first show that if we talk about the flight out here,\n\n09:21.480 --> 09:23.480\nit's the only thing we're ever going to talk about.\n\n09:23.480 --> 09:25.480\nThat's good, though. That's a good show.\n\n09:25.480 --> 09:29.480\nWe learned a lot of material on the way over here.\n\n09:29.480 --> 09:32.480\nI'm going to give you some headlines.\n\n09:32.480 --> 09:37.480\nFirst, in the interest of the...\n\n09:37.480 --> 09:40.480\nWe took a limo to LAX from Los Feliz.\n\n09:40.480 --> 09:44.480\nYou get into one of these limos and there's an ice thing,\n\n09:44.480 --> 09:46.480\nand there's some glasses.\n\n09:46.480 --> 09:52.480\nEvery time I go, like, well, then we should have booze.\n\n09:52.480 --> 09:55.480\nI don't know what that is. Oh, I think it's called alcoholism.\n\n09:55.480 --> 09:58.480\nBut you see ice, and you see glasses, and then you're like,\n\n09:58.480 --> 10:02.480\nwell, then I go and get a bottle of vodka,\n\n10:02.480 --> 10:04.480\nand I get a bottle of Fernet Bronco,\n\n10:04.480 --> 10:09.480\nwhich is that Hitler medicine that Jeff's always talking about.\n\n10:09.480 --> 10:11.480\nIf you're a fan of the podcast.\n\n10:11.480 --> 10:14.480\nIs it fixed or Hitler yet?\n\n10:14.480 --> 10:16.480\nYou came down with some Hitler.\n\n10:16.480 --> 10:20.480\nI had a 24-hour Hitler.\n\n10:20.480 --> 10:24.480\nHitler medicine.\n\n10:24.480 --> 10:28.480\nAnd we're just drinking in the traffic on the way to LAX,\n\n10:28.480 --> 10:29.480\nand we're having a good time.\n\n10:29.480 --> 10:30.480\nAnd we were fine.\n\n10:30.480 --> 10:32.480\nWe were listening to Celine Dion.\n\n10:32.480 --> 10:34.480\nThere was a CD in the limo.\n\n10:34.480 --> 10:36.480\nI think that's the last time the limo was used.\n\n10:36.480 --> 10:39.480\nYou were playing the little mermaid soundtrack\n\n10:39.480 --> 10:41.480\nas loud as it could go.\n\n10:41.480 --> 10:46.480\nYou and Cody were screaming along a different song,\n\n10:46.480 --> 10:48.480\ndifferent lyrics to the song.\n\n10:48.480 --> 10:49.480\nI do.\n\n10:49.480 --> 10:51.480\nI remember everything up until about...\n\n10:51.480 --> 10:53.480\nDo you remember me going, maybe another song?\n\n10:53.480 --> 10:55.480\nMaybe a different one.\n\n10:55.480 --> 10:58.480\nI knew it was starting when Cody was like,\n\n10:58.480 --> 10:59.480\nplay Chicago.\n\n10:59.480 --> 11:04.480\nWhat's the song where he had it coming?\n\n11:04.480 --> 11:06.480\nAnd I'm like, play he had it coming.\n\n11:06.480 --> 11:08.480\nAnd Jeff's like, it's called he had it coming?\n\n11:08.480 --> 11:09.480\nI don't know.\n\n11:09.480 --> 11:11.480\nAnd it's not called he had it coming.\n\n11:11.480 --> 11:13.480\nIt's a cell block tango.\n\n11:13.480 --> 11:16.480\nBut it's like, you know, Cody kind of like,\n\n11:16.480 --> 11:19.480\nI can see, you know, I've been with her for many years,\n\n11:19.480 --> 11:21.480\nand I can kind of start to see, like,\n\n11:21.480 --> 11:24.480\nwhich is usually an adorable amount of like,\n\n11:24.480 --> 11:27.480\nwhen the Gary Busey starts to come out, like the...\n\n11:27.480 --> 11:28.480\nCan I just stop you?\n\n11:28.480 --> 11:31.480\nWhen she starts to like, like, like, starts to become...\n\n11:31.480 --> 11:35.480\nThere's like lines being drawn in the sand for no reason.\n\n11:35.480 --> 11:37.480\nLet me just paint one picture.\n\n11:37.480 --> 11:40.480\nAlso, Cody is dressed like a garage mechanic.\n\n11:40.480 --> 11:41.480\nShe's...\n\n11:41.480 --> 11:42.480\nWell, yeah.\n\n11:42.480 --> 11:45.480\nShe has this like, comfortable, very sexy\n\n11:45.480 --> 11:47.480\nfor how comfortable and practical it is.\n\n11:47.480 --> 11:49.480\nUsually those things don't overlap,\n\n11:49.480 --> 11:51.480\nbut at the middle of that Vendaya...\n\n11:51.480 --> 11:55.480\nBright pink chrome shoes, dressed like a mechanic.\n\n11:55.480 --> 11:57.480\nShe looks like a mechanical night writer, yeah.\n\n11:57.480 --> 11:59.480\nArms, everywhere.\n\n11:59.480 --> 12:01.480\nAnd she's like, you know, she's like,\n\n12:01.480 --> 12:03.480\nput it on that song, I love that song.\n\n12:03.480 --> 12:05.480\nAnd then that song starts and it's like,\n\n12:05.480 --> 12:08.480\nit starts with like, pop, swish, Schwartz,\n\n12:08.480 --> 12:10.480\nCicero or whatever, you know, that's what I was talking about.\n\n12:10.480 --> 12:11.480\nAnd Cody's...\n\n12:11.480 --> 12:14.480\nCody's of all the songs to defiantly pretend\n\n12:14.480 --> 12:16.480\nyou know the lyrics to.\n\n12:16.480 --> 12:19.480\nI was like, pop, Cicero, Schwartz, like,\n\n12:19.480 --> 12:21.480\nyou're just saying what you're hearing.\n\n12:21.480 --> 12:23.480\nYou don't know the song anyways.\n\n12:23.480 --> 12:26.480\nBut we're like, so we roll up to LAX and I'm like...\n\n12:26.480 --> 12:29.480\nSee, now, if I can hit pause here,\n\n12:29.480 --> 12:31.480\nthis is the last thing I remember.\n\n12:31.480 --> 12:34.480\nAnd this is like the forward of the story.\n\n12:34.480 --> 12:38.480\nRight, because the stars of the story that emerge\n\n12:38.480 --> 12:42.480\nare gonna be Jeff Davis and Cody Heller and...\n\n12:42.480 --> 12:43.480\nSteve Levy.\n\n12:43.480 --> 12:48.480\nI would call it a tale of two kinds of drunk.\n\n12:48.480 --> 12:50.480\nI don't know what happened.\n\n12:50.480 --> 12:51.480\nI feel like I really...\n\n12:51.480 --> 12:53.480\nYou drank a lot and got drunk, that's what happened.\n\n12:53.480 --> 12:56.480\nBut I disappeared.\n\n12:56.480 --> 12:57.480\nI became...\n\n12:57.480 --> 12:58.480\nRight, we'll get there.\n\n12:58.480 --> 12:59.480\nI think it's...\n\n12:59.480 --> 13:00.480\nHe disappeared.\n\n13:00.480 --> 13:03.480\nIt's actually a rare story that's actually\n\n13:03.480 --> 13:06.480\nprobably most important to just cut ahead.\n\n13:06.480 --> 13:08.480\nIt's like one of those like...\n\n13:08.480 --> 13:13.480\nJeff will be awoken by...\n\n13:13.480 --> 13:14.480\nPolice.\n\n13:14.480 --> 13:17.480\nLAX police on a bench.\n\n13:17.480 --> 13:19.480\nSo there are questions.\n\n13:19.480 --> 13:21.480\nAnd ask him, where are you going?\n\n13:21.480 --> 13:25.480\nAnd his answer will be Los Angeles.\n\n13:25.480 --> 13:28.480\nAnd they will say, you're in Los Angeles.\n\n13:28.480 --> 13:30.480\nAnd he will then...\n\n13:30.480 --> 13:31.480\nWhere are you going?\n\n13:31.480 --> 13:34.480\nAnd after a while, they'll arrive at New York.\n\n13:34.480 --> 13:37.480\nNo, no, they got me there.\n\n13:37.480 --> 13:38.480\nThey pitched New York.\n\n13:38.480 --> 13:40.480\nThey said, where are you going?\n\n13:40.480 --> 13:42.480\nI said, I paused and I thought about it.\n\n13:42.480 --> 13:44.480\nI said, I don't know.\n\n13:44.480 --> 13:46.480\nI thought I was coming home.\n\n13:46.480 --> 13:48.480\nSo because what happened...\n\n13:48.480 --> 13:50.480\nWhat we've pieced together...\n\n13:50.480 --> 13:52.480\nI can tell you the subjective things.\n\n13:52.480 --> 13:54.480\nI can tell you that I last saw Jeff and Cody.\n\n13:54.480 --> 13:56.480\nWe got split up into the TSA checkpoint line.\n\n13:56.480 --> 13:57.480\nI looked over.\n\n13:57.480 --> 13:58.480\nThese are my friends.\n\n13:58.480 --> 14:00.480\nI'm having a great time.\n\n14:00.480 --> 14:01.480\nI'm actually...\n\n14:01.480 --> 14:03.480\nI thought I was going to be the self-destructive rockstar.\n\n14:03.480 --> 14:04.480\nBecause I'm like...\n\n14:04.480 --> 14:05.480\nThe guy goes...\n\n14:05.480 --> 14:07.480\nI'm in my anti-TSA mode where I'm just like...\n\n14:07.480 --> 14:09.480\nI can't understand what you're saying.\n\n14:09.480 --> 14:11.480\nYou have to take your laptop out of the bag.\n\n14:11.480 --> 14:13.480\nThe guy goes to Dan.\n\n14:13.480 --> 14:15.480\nSir, can I look in your bag?\n\n14:15.480 --> 14:17.480\nAnd Dan goes, what if I say no?\n\n14:17.480 --> 14:19.480\nAnd I'm like, oh Jesus Christ.\n\n14:19.480 --> 14:21.480\nThat's how drunk I was.\n\n14:21.480 --> 14:23.480\nI'm like, oh God.\n\n14:23.480 --> 14:25.480\nHe's the third drunkest person in the store.\n\n14:25.480 --> 14:27.480\nI'm like, oh my God.\n\n14:27.480 --> 14:31.480\nI was like, okay, I'm just going to fight the government.\n\n14:31.480 --> 14:33.480\nLet me answer that question.\n\n14:33.480 --> 14:36.480\nI end up being the Matthew Broderick in this story.\n\n14:36.480 --> 14:40.480\nI end up being the Anthony Michael Hall of this breakfast club.\n\n14:40.480 --> 14:43.480\nAnd I'm like, what are you going to do?\n\n14:43.480 --> 14:45.480\nTake me to Guantanamo?\n\n14:45.480 --> 14:49.480\nSo I get through that line.\n\n14:49.480 --> 14:51.480\nAnd then Cody somehow,\n\n14:51.480 --> 14:54.480\nmaybe it got activated by the backscatter machine.\n\n14:54.480 --> 14:58.480\nLike, she's a marionette of Courtney Love\n\n14:58.480 --> 15:00.480\nwhen she gets to the other side.\n\n15:00.480 --> 15:04.480\nAnd the only person holding the strings is...\n\n15:04.480 --> 15:06.480\nGod.\n\n15:06.480 --> 15:10.480\nAnd God is not a good puppeteer.\n\n15:10.480 --> 15:12.480\nHe's not.\n\n15:12.480 --> 15:14.480\nBut I don't want to derail us with that stuff.\n\n15:14.480 --> 15:16.480\nWe'll get back to that.\n\n15:16.480 --> 15:18.480\nWe'll get back to that.\n\n15:18.480 --> 15:22.480\nWe get up to the lounge where...\n\n15:22.480 --> 15:24.480\nCody's like...\n\n15:24.480 --> 15:26.480\nIt's delayed.\n\n15:26.480 --> 15:28.480\nIt probably takes 20 minutes.\n\n15:28.480 --> 15:30.480\nWe were over-served in the limo.\n\n15:30.480 --> 15:33.480\nAnd it must just be hitting her.\n\n15:33.480 --> 15:37.480\nAnd she's getting unable to be motile.\n\n15:37.480 --> 15:40.480\nAnd she's starting to like...\n\n15:40.480 --> 15:44.480\nShe's just making sounds.\n\n15:44.480 --> 15:51.480\nAnd all you can register is that she's defiant about something.\n\n15:51.480 --> 15:56.480\nBut then I'm not a good person either.\n\n15:56.480 --> 16:00.480\nYou get to do your impression of me.\n\n16:00.480 --> 16:02.480\nYeah, go, Schrab.\n\n16:02.480 --> 16:04.480\nSchrab has the best version of this story.\n\n16:04.480 --> 16:07.480\nBecause I'm looking around and I'm seeing a guy.\n\n16:07.480 --> 16:12.480\nIf I see Cody being Lucy Goosey in a fluorescent lit lounge at 6 p.m.\n\n16:12.480 --> 16:15.480\nAnd then I see a guy across from her going like this.\n\n16:15.480 --> 16:17.480\nMaybe that guy's playing Pokemons.\n\n16:17.480 --> 16:19.480\nBut maybe he's TMZ.\n\n16:19.480 --> 16:22.480\nAnd I'm just like, I don't want to feel protective.\n\n16:22.480 --> 16:24.480\nAnyway, chaos.\n\n16:24.480 --> 16:27.480\nWe get into the lounge, chaos, chaos, chaos.\n\n16:27.480 --> 16:29.480\nI'm like, here's my ticket.\n\n16:29.480 --> 16:31.480\nYou're in first class.

44:12.600\nSpencer's dick have a beard is that that sounds fake and made up that really\n\n44:12.600 --> 44:16.120\nhappened there's a real question but I don't think I don't think she expected\n\n44:16.120 --> 44:21.280\nthe answer yes yeah I think we're all dicks kind of have beards we were doing\n\n44:21.280 --> 44:24.200\nit we were doing a call back to the fact that we were

person next to you\n\n44:50.880 --> 44:54.880\nsaid thank you like I asked you at the end of the flight about like having to\n\n44:54.880 --> 44:58.880\nsit next to her right yeah there was a guy like Cody Cody bolted up out of the\n\n44:58.880 --> 45:01.600\nseat as we were landing you know and at that point when everyone's got to get up\n\n45:01.600 --> 45:05.160\nto the you know stand up and Cody was immediately befriending the flight\n\n45:05.160 --> 45:09.280\nattendants and talking to them and you could you could kind of just hear her\n\n45:09.280 --> 45:13.360\nvoice wafting back through the plane and at that point that another guy in\n\n45:13.360 --> 45:18.960\nfirst class looked at me and in a kind of like male bonding like or fellow\n\n45:18.960 --> 45:23.920\ntraveler kind of thing was like you had to deal with that the whole flight big\n\n45:23.920 --> 45:29.800\nbut because he didn't the I sent in me deal because I what he saw was he thought\n\n45:29.800 --> 45:34.880\nwe were strange he thought he unloaded my fucking no man's sky laptop and my\n\n45:34.880 --> 45:40.720\nXbox controller and like and then he saw everyone's aunt to get on the plane and\n\n45:40.720 --> 45:46.760\nplopped out and be like what's going on and and he probably never saw or heard\n\n45:46.760 --> 45:51.760\nany indication that we actually knew each other so he thought it was like I\n\n45:51.760 --> 45:57.760\nwas in a planes trains and automobiles stitch but then he was like I nailed it\n\n45:57.760 --> 46:01.440\nI think I nailed the whole thing like I stand by what I said in that fucking\n\n46:01.440 --> 46:08.520\nbridge killed it like people people were digging my vibe like I was it was fun\n\n46:08.520 --> 46:16.960\nit was energetic no I don't remember you don't remember anyone not digging your\n\n46:16.960 --> 46:23.680\nthat is true and I gotta tell you that's like look all's well that ends well\n\n46:23.680 --> 46:30.680\nbest sex we ever had

care about that story but yes I did for real ask if your dick had a beard\n\n46:38.880 --> 46:42.920\nokay well do you want to know the context of it well do you because you\n\n46:42.920 --> 46:48.680\nobviously people at pubic air I know but I guess I was wondering if yours yes I\n\n46:48.680 --> 46:54.120\nknow this wasn't this while you were having sex with Dan no this is where\n\n46:54.120 --> 47:00.320\nI said best sex I ever had so that's a tip for you out tonight go home and talk\n\n47:00.320 --> 47:06.920\nabout me ask me ask me more questions about Spencer's dick it was because\n\n47:06.920 --> 47:11.720\nearlier I had a beard do you think it has a beard it was because I don't know I\n\n47:11.720 --> 47:18.560\ndon't know oh oh it was because earlier I asked if your dick floats in the bath\n\n47:18.560 --> 47:24.440\noh yeah I remember that if it floats up like I wanted to know and Dan I don't\n\n47:24.440 --> 47:28.880\nknow the time frame lines up Dan said must be nice because yeah everybody's\n\n47:28.880 --> 47:33.680\nalways look I wasn't saying that yours wouldn't float right do you think do you\n\n47:33.680 --> 47:41.480\nthink do you think I have a micro penis no you perfectly sized penis for human\n\n47:41.480 --> 47:47.120\nsmall pair of players yes you get you get you get a badge when we have that\n\n47:47.120 --> 47:51.880\nconversation and I get to be a toothpick I'd still want to know like I'm nailing\n\n47:51.880 --> 47:58.400\nit I guess it doesn't it doesn't matter okay found each other and I love it I\n\n47:58.400 --> 48:03.240\nlove it you know how much I love it in fact on the way here you took a shower\n\n48:03.240 --> 48:07.440\nand while you were in the shower I was saying you know wash that dick dick\n\n48:07.440 --> 48:11.880\nextra good cuz I'm gonna suck on it later and then I and I and I heated that\n\n48:11.880 --> 48:16.560\ncall working on it for like I conditioned it I'm ready first you\n\n48:16.560 --> 48:20.720\nrefuse I'm looking forward to it this is usually a point of anxiety with\n\n48:20.720 --> 48:27.840\nprevious lovers I'm looking forward to sex so I mean to you baby it's what my\n\n48:27.840 --> 48:35.760\npuke is gonna throw up right now but Spencer said that his dick does float in\n\n48:35.760 --> 48:49.320\nthe water yes yes float yes no float no no float okay that's what I thought all\n\n48:49.320 --> 48:54.000\nthe ladies out there with pendulous breasts which is a clinical term for the\n\n48:54.000 --> 48:58.520\nkind of breasts that like you know you can put a pencil under like some women\n\n48:58.520 --> 49:01.320\ndon't have those kind of breasts they have just like pert little breasts you\n\n49:01.320 --> 49:05.600\nknow I have the kind of pendulous breasts that in the water they get extra\n\n49:05.600 --> 49:08.800\nbuoyant and they float so I was wondering if men have the same kind of\n\n49:08.800 --> 49:14.200\nexperience right and they do oh well not doing yours does I think yours does but\n\n49:14.200 --> 49:22.800\nwhen your dick is basically a nipple you can send me to Mars send me let's skydive\n\n49:22.800 --> 49:26.440\nwith me what's your dick doing I just wouldn't hear these conversations what\n\n49:26.440 --> 49:30.320\nwas your what's your dick look like in a botanical dome and I'm just like this is\n\n49:30.320 --> 49:33.920\nmore evidence the fact that this is a question for anyone means I have a really\n\n49:33.920 --> 49:37.560\nsmall dick because I this wouldn't be a question of everyone's dick look like mine\n\n49:37.560 --> 49:42.120\ncan you you would never you would never be like does it float what do you mean\n\n49:42.120 --> 49:48.400\nit's a like it's a it's a pepperoni in a fucking turtleneck it's like a it's a\n\n49:48.400 --> 49:55.160\nit's an alien mandible that when in need when it's agitated when it's time to\n\n49:55.160 --> 50:04.680\nstrike an impressive rick baker effect happens but not so impressive that I\n\n50:04.680 --> 50:10.480\nthen in the realm of these people who apparently well flaccid have a floaty\n\n50:10.480 --> 50:14.920\ndick and it's not on top of the water it's just being upwardly mobile it's\n\n50:14.920 --> 50:19.360\nit's moving up it's trying to get there I picture your penis is so long no you're\n\n50:19.360 --> 50:23.200\nsitting in a bathtub and the head it's just like a pool it goes up like a\n\n50:23.200 --> 50:28.040\nbobber when you're fishing yeah no it's just floating and then like the rest of\n\n50:28.040 --> 50:35.320\nit is like a kite string no no Rob I couldn't does he dick float yeah yeah I\n\n50:35.320 --> 50:40.840\njust assume you guys were talking about I know I got a great big dick that's why\n\n50:40.840 --> 50:43.360\nI started thinking about it because you took a bath and I asked if you dick floated\n\n50:43.360 --> 50:47.480\nfirst you said you said did you use bubble bath and I said no he said so you\n\n50:47.480 --> 50:54.760\njust looked at your dick and I go yeah why do you think I took a bath okay well\n\n50:54.760 --> 51:02.520\nso I could have been I had I had a really profound therapy session before I\n\n51:02.520 --> 51:07.640\ncame to New York because I've had a rough year and rough year for me means\n\n51:07.640 --> 51:15.000\nnothing but I was you know my therapist is privy to you know the little\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:19.760\nlabyrinthine thing I've been going through and all the stuff and we really\n\n51:19.760 --> 51:24.720\ntalked about it and I this all does relate because I kind of like she was\n\n51:24.720 --> 51:28.040\nasked she's like all right so all the shit's over with all the stuff that you\n\n51:28.040 --> 51:31.560\nwere thinking at like are we're what is what do you what are you doing this\n\n51:31.560 --> 51:34.160\nweekend I'm like I'm going to New York doing the show that she's got all these\n\n51:34.160 --> 51:37.400\nquestions as like what you going to New York what are you worried about going\n\n51:37.400 --> 51:41.120\nwhen you do a show in New York what are you worried about being in public or\n\n51:41.120 --> 51:44.240\nwhatever I'm like what are these questions I don't even understand like\n\n51:44.240 --> 51:47.560\nwhat is your perception of me it goes in this guy look here's how I feel about\n\n51:47.560 --> 51:55.280\nthis stuff right now I don't I feel like for a year I have not been able to do\n\n51:55.280 --> 51:58.960\nwhat I've done all my life again which I said on my last episode which is just\n\n51:58.960 --> 52:07.440\ntalk like and and stay feeling safe because of the venting of the shame and\n\n52:07.440 --> 52:10.440\nletting people know where I'm at and all this stuff and I you know I started to\n\n52:10.440 --> 52:17.240\nget it was like it was I came I came through that session because she made\n\n52:17.240 --> 52:26.040\nme understand that she's like so you've been selling for 44 years this product\n\n52:26.040 --> 52:33.480\ncalled I don't care and that's been very comfortable for you and what you're\n\n52:33.480 --> 52:40.520\nreally upset about right now is that you care and you resent people for making\n\n52:40.520 --> 52:44.600\nyou feel that way and you resent the ramifications of that all the stuff and\n\n52:44.600 --> 52:50.280\nlike hearing her kind of like parse it in this way I what I came around to was\n\n52:50.280 --> 52:55.520\noh shit so my job is not whether or not I should keep doing this or not doing it\n\n52:55.520 --> 53:03.160\nor whatever it's like vulnerability is a good thing yeah it's a thing that I've\n\n53:03.160 --> 53:07.400\nbeen allergic to like when I went whenever I was on a playground and I\n\n53:07.400 --> 53:12.360\nwould get beat up by the bully sometimes I'd fight back sometimes I'd take the\n\n53:12.360 --> 53:19.120\npunches so hard that the bully would start to freak out sometimes I'd just\n\n53:19.120 --> 53:24.480\ncry and piss my pants but but like like in any of those cases the only thing\n\n53:24.480 --> 53:28.720\nthat actually fucked me up was when the well-intended person would come up\n\n53:28.720 --> 53:32.360\nbehind me and go hey what are you doing why are you doing that to this guy and\n\n53:32.360 --> 53:37.400\nthen the bully would go cuz he's dirty and his hair's nappy and he smells like\n\n53:37.400 --> 53:42.000\na fish and and I and then it's not that's not what would I already knew\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:45.000\nthat's why I was getting the beating I was like I co-signed on that yeah it's\n\n53:45.000 --> 53:52.200\nI'm definitely not showering for this kind of person so let the beatings\n\n53:52.200 --> 53:58.680\nbegin and whoa be to he who says enough it's I think that was some kind of from\n\n53:58.680 --> 54:05.320\nMacbeth the the thing that would make me cry is when that nice person would come\n\n54:05.320 --> 54:10.160\nup behind and then say to that bully go so what if he doesn't comb his hair so\n\n54:10.160 --> 54:14.280\nwhat if he smells like a fish that doesn't make him a bad person you're a\n\n54:14.280 --> 54:17.760\nmean person you're the one beating people up you shouldn't beat people up\n\n54:17.760 --> 54:23.800\njust because they smell like fish that would make me want to murder the guy\n\n54:23.800 --> 54:28.200\nsticking up for me and it would make me more importantly like want to get out\n\n54:28.200 --> 54:32.720\nof there who would make me really really sad it was the thing that hurt about\n\n54:32.720 --> 54:39.200\ngetting beaten up it what not the beating like I fetishized getting beaten I\n\n54:39.200 --> 54:44.280\nfetishize the numbness I fetishize the abuse I was like like don't just don't\n\n54:44.280 --> 54:49.960\never ever fucking try to convince me that I'm vulnerable and because\n\n54:49.960 --> 54:55.560\nvulnerability means destruction but no it doesn't that's the thing that I\n\n54:55.560 --> 55:00.840\nrecalibrated and so I just like these relationships between shame vulnerability\n\n55:00.840 --> 55:06.120\nand existence and what our job is what bravery is all this stuff I finally came\n\n55:06.120 --> 55:11.640\nout of that going okay so vulnerability is good it's actually good to tell\n\n55:11.640 --> 55:15.880\npeople here's what here's what I'm embarrassed about here's what here's what\n\n55:15.880 --> 55:20.360\nmakes me feel bad here's how you can actually hurt me here's the amount of\n\n55:20.360 --> 55:25.840\npain that I'm feeling those are those that that's a good thing to to share\n\n55:25.840 --> 55:32.960\nthat stuff it's a bad thing to let trauma push you back and cause you to\n\n55:32.960 --> 55:39.120\nstart getting more and more practical that's called PTSD it's it's it's like\n\n55:39.120 --> 55:44.040\nit you experience a random piece of chaos that makes you wonder what the\n\n55:44.040 --> 55:48.480\nfuck you've been your whole life and then your solution is to limit your\n\n55:48.480 --> 55:52.680\nexperience to a little straw so that the distance between the cup and your mouth\n\n55:52.680 --> 55:57.520\ndoesn't have as much of an opportunity to be fucking violated again that's\n\n55:57.520 --> 56:03.160\nthat's chaos winning that's that's cycle of abuse that's that's that's that's\n\n56:03.160 --> 56:09.480\nthe problem and it's natural and it's good but like I finally figured it out\n\n56:09.480 --> 56:13.760\nlike for this last year I've been like what am I what am I doing on this show\n\n56:13.760 --> 56:19.960\nwhat am I supposed to be doing I like like like if there's things that that\n\n56:19.960 --> 56:26.840\ntalking about them actually helps Nazis like like then what what that so then\n\n56:26.840 --> 56:31.080\nmight so then the way you fight Nazis is you pretend they're not Nazis and all\n\n56:31.080 --> 56:34.440\nthis shit just like like the spiral of thought and all this shit with this\n\n56:34.440 --> 56:38.600\nfucking like mentally ill people weaponized by 4chan trolls and people\n\n56:38.600 --> 56:42.560\nlike doing their best to try to get me fired and all this shit all of the\n\n56:42.560 --> 56:47.440\nexperiences that I've gone through this last year the common theme has been well\n\n56:47.440 --> 56:51.040\nI know one thing's for sure the worst thing you could ever do is go out there\n\n56:51.040 --> 56:56.280\nand talk about it because and that I that it's been true that's a true thing\n\n56:56.280 --> 57:03.360\nand so it's it completely fucked me up but I now I got it I think I got it and\n\n57:03.360 --> 57:08.080\nI'm sharing this now because I'm pretty sure Jeff is probably pretty embarrassed\n\n57:08.080 --> 57:16.920\nthat he he's such a 70s family feud drunkard that he that he can fall asleep\n\n57:16.920 --> 57:24.920\non his feet and end up in the clutches of the police outside LAX but like I I\n\n57:24.920 --> 57:30.560\nyou know I want I want you supported in that vulnerability I know what you\n\n57:30.560 --> 57:36.000\npunished for it I and I don't I don't I think if I were to enter your head I'd\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:39.560\nbe like well don't talk to you frankly about this stuff because then when it\n\n57:39.560 --> 57:43.000\ncomes down to whether or not you're this or that and whether you should quit\n\n57:43.000 --> 57:46.000\ndoing this or quit doing that then everyone else has all the power because\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:50.280\nthey're all weighing in on your life and all that shit but no that's not true we\n\n57:50.280 --> 57:56.520\ncan continue to be pathologically unapologetic self exploratory narcissistic\n\n57:56.520 --> 58:01.800\nfucking sociopathic messes I think we have to double down now more than ever\n\n58:01.800 --> 58:07.520\nabout what we find in our navel every morning if you're gay right now can I\n\n58:07.520 --> 58:13.960\nask a favor of you could you please be more gay in everything that you say and\n\n58:13.960 --> 58:17.880\neverything that you do if you're if you're if you're a person of color can\n\n58:17.880 --> 58:21.800\nyou and then you happen to have a distaste for identity politics could you\n\n58:21.800 --> 58:25.920\nfind a little bit of a love for it just to antagonize the kinds of people that\n\n58:25.920 --> 58:33.000\nwant to that so that we can draw battle lines between those who want shame to\n\n58:33.000 --> 58:39.320\ngrow on trees and those who want to overcome it because that battle will\n\n58:39.320 --> 58:44.840\nbe won by the people who oppose shame and but but this battle that we're\n\n58:44.840 --> 58:49.560\nfighting right now where it's like who should be more ashamed that well guess\n\n58:49.560 --> 58:55.360\nwho's gonna win shame mongers shame experts yeah but I'm right to feel\n\n58:55.360 --> 58:59.320\nashamed about my behavior today or last night last night Jeff how dare you imply\n\n58:59.320 --> 59:05.120\nthat I've met read you wrong fuck you no I mean like it's I wasn't sure if

right not do\n\n59:13.560 --> 59:20.600\nthat again like that's really really fucking bad it's really shady so weird\n\n59:20.600 --> 59:24.760\ncuz like I honestly hearing the story I was like standing back there hearing it\n\n59:24.760 --> 59:30.760\nabout me and I was like fucking sounds so cool I'm fucking I'm fucking a fan of\n\n59:30.760 --> 59:35.240\nmy I didn't even know I could say

I'm not being a prude and saying let's stop making jokes about it\n\n01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:40.240\nI think it's fucked up that we all have this like understanding that oh and then\n\n01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:44.440\nwhen you get in there it's fucking horrible and like like in ways that make\n\n01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:48.840\nno sense and that weren't ordered by a judge like you could get raped and you\n\n01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.200\ncould like get murdered and it all depends on whether or not you just and\n\n01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:55.440\nwe all just like go like yeah that's what prison is like because it should be a\n\n01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:59.240\nbad place like come on these people fucking these are the only people you\n\n01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:06.760\ncaught and that showed up to

like the new this I think this theater there's a\n\n01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:36.600\nprison being built across the street and all of these guys live in the attic\n\n01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:41.360\nand they're like come on fairs fair we don't want this prison\n\n01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:45.520\nit's all local politics that's why there's crazy shit with prisons that you\n\n01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:49.200\nknow they're all owned by companies and shit yeah we should open a fucking\n\n01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:53.440\nprison and make it the best fucking prison that people like I'll tell you a\n\n01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:59.880\nlittle tidbit Harmon jail I got in trouble let's open a harm we just put\n\n01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:07.080\nbars on the society yeah all ourselves prisoners of we can say we were\n\n01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:12.760\nlocked away like this yeah yeah sure everybody's in the mood to follow me in\n\n01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:16.480\nsome gimmick for the podcast what you really they really got that moon moon\n\n01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:21.680\npayoff what's your tip tidbit you said yeah I was saying like I I think I could\n\n01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:26.600\nstart a cool present because when I was a kid I got I got caught smoking a\n\n01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:30.800\ncigarette in the parking lot at school in high school I was with three other\n\n01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:34.760\ngirls the principal vice principal walked down made eye contact with me saw\n\n01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:38.760\nthat I clearly was smoking but I had enough time to like warn my friends so\n\n01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:41.720\nthey put their cigarettes out and I took the fall for all them and like the\n\n01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:45.880\nprincipal she fucking knew she like she in the office she was like look I have\n\n01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:49.120\nto like call your parents it is a big thing but like I want to give you\n\n01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:52.040\nprops like I saw what you did back there cool on you you know like there was an\n\n01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:56.880\nunspoken thing at least I think we like organized crime but what happened was\n\n01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:02.400\nsince she felt you know I think sympathetic toward me she she was like\n\n01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:05.000\nlisten I'm not gonna suspend you I'm gonna make I'm gonna make this like\n\n01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.000\nlimited thing where it's just lunchtime detention and all of you guys are gonna\n\n01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.480\nhave to go cuz like I know you guys weren't even allowed to be in the parking\n\n01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:15.880\nlot so it was like lunchtime detention in this room right we to go every\n\n01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:19.520\nday and eat lunch there by the end of the week people were fucking getting in\n\n01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:23.320\ntrouble on purpose to be part of lunch bunch we wound up having our own page in\n\n01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:28.880\nour yearbook okay on is what I'm saying and part of it was at first people were\n\n01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:32.120\njust coming to hang out with us and then it was like no you have to you to get\n\n01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:34.880\ninto lunch bunch you have to actually get into get into trouble because the\n\n01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:40.480\nteacher mr. Sherrod was like he outlawed it and so then they were getting in\n\n01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:51.840\ntrouble yeah mr. Sherrod I have a question so lunch bunch sounds like an\n\n01:16:51.840 --> 01:17:00.600\nawesome sequel to breakfast club and there's a dinner sinners and it is a\n\n01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:07.680\ngood but I mean really to that point which is the society supposed to well\n\n01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:11.720\nat least the liberal side of society says you're supposed to be defined by the\n\n01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:17.720\ntreatment the experience as the lowest person right so like if what's this like\n\n01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:23.440\nlike if you if someone were to propose prison reform and say like oh when you\n\n01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:28.640\ngo to prison actually you get kind of a fucking break like this nightmare for\n\n01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:32.840\npeople are like fuck them it's like like isn't there this like really easy thick\n\n01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:36.800\nline or it's like well then do you sounds like you want to go to prison which\n\n01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:40.600\nit's isn't the same with gay marriage and drugs and also there's always this\n\n01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:44.720\ndebate between people who are like well what what then everyone just starts\n\n01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:49.040\nsmoking joints all the time what the fuck what's to stop me from smoking a\n\n01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:53.880\njoint and that's always the other person I was trying to do is like sounds like\n\n01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:59.240\nyou want to fucking smoke a joint or you're worried that if you do you're\n\n01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:02.960\ngonna punch somebody or that you're not gonna or that you're gonna die or\n\n01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:06.280\nthat you think and it's like that with prison reform it's kind of like what is\n\n01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:12.200\nour real worry that oh we're gonna if you grow up in a shitty neighborhood and\n\n01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:18.760\nyou end up sentenced of a crime and then you like oh we're worried that the\n\n01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:23.160\nslippery slope is that everyone's gonna want to go to prison and like what if\n\n01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:27.200\nyou pushed that gas pedal down and we're like yeah make a society where\n\n01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:32.760\neveryone wants to go to prison figure it out like like by the time you figure\n\n01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:36.720\nout how to create that society I think you're gonna have accidentally created\n\n01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:42.040\nproper fixes itself because you're gonna be like well then why is it prison and\n\n01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:46.640\nthen you're gonna be like yeah I come out of prison a better person is no I\n\n01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:49.800\ndon't know you don't know what I'm talking about you ruined everything I\n\n01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:55.760\nwas being so clear they were they were silent because I was being clear you\n\n01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:59.920\nruined it that's the way I choose to remember this which I will not in 10\n\n01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:04.120\nminutes I'm sorry I ruined the show with my\n\n01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:07.480\npontifications about society but I feel like in my head there's like a\n\n01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:12.880\ndefinition like the podcast 70% how we got here even though we were drunk and\n\n01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:18.280\nthen I choose to make 30% somehow educational or something it was good\n\n01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:26.400\nit's a throwback to my 80s education that was like public access programming\n\n01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:30.640\nwas born of that they're guy well we'll give you a
