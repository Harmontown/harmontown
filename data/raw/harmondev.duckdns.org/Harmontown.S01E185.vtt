the\n\n57:15.000 --> 57:17.000\nMusic\n\n57:17.000 --> 57:19.000\nOh no\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:21.000\nI can't control the inferno\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:23.000\nThe fire's coming down\n\n57:23.000 --> 57:27.000\nAnd I am sexing all around\n\n57:27.000 --> 57:29.000\nChicago\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:31.000\nChicago\n\n57:31.000 --> 57:33.000\nChicago\n\n57:33.000 --> 57:35.000\nChicago\n\n57:35.000 --> 57:37.000\nChicago\n\n57:37.000 --> 57:41.000\nWe are a land of you\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:47.000\nC-H-I-C-A-G-O\n\n57:49.000 --> 57:51.000\nPeriod\n\n57:51.000 --> 57:53.000\nWoo\n\n57:55.000 --> 57:57.000\nYeah, alright\n\n57:57.000 --> 57:59.000\nYou got it\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:01.000\nThat's enough\n\n58:01.000 --> 58:03.000\nI know sarcasm when I hear it\n\n58:03.000 --> 58:05.000\nSo you didn't like it\n\n58:05.000 --> 58:07.000\nBig deal\n\n58:07.000 --> 58:09.000\nGuess what, I made it up\n\n58:09.000 --> 58:11.000\nIt took me no time\n\n58:11.000 --> 58:13.000\nSo you're sitting there judging it\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:15.000\nYou're like, I didn't like this as much as the other thing\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:17.000\nI don't even know what it is\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:19.000\nYou robot\n\n58:19.000 --> 58:21.000\nI just live from\n\n58:21.000 --> 58:23.000\nI'm a genius\n\n58:25.000 --> 58:27.000\nCan I pitch something to you?\n\n58:27.000 --> 58:29.000\nI ate a pizza the other night\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:31.000\nLike a whole pizza before I went to sleep\n\n58:31.000 --> 58:33.000\nAnd then I had a dream\n\n58:33.000 --> 58:35.000\nBut it was a dream\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:37.000\nIt was a whole fucking like movie\n\n58:37.000 --> 58:39.000\nAnd I wrote it down\n\n58:39.000 --> 58:41.000\nWhen I woke up, can I pitch the movie to you?\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:43.000\nI swear to God, this is all a dream\n\n58:47.000 --> 58:49.000\nAnd it's supposed to be a comedy\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:51.000\nIt's called Hot Rod Parade\n\n58:51.000 --> 58:53.000\nIt's called, I'm sorry\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:55.000\nHot Rod Parade\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:57.000\nHot rod, like a hot rod\n\n58:57.000 --> 58:59.000\nA hot rod\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:01.000\nSo, Luke is in love with Becky\n\n59:05.000 --> 59:07.000\nBut she's into Brad\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:09.000\nBecause he's got the hottest hot rod\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:11.000\nThat she knows\n\n59:11.000 --> 59:13.000\nAnd she knows it's going to come\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:15.000\nIn first place at the local Hot Rod Parade\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:19.000\nYou dreamt this and then wrote it down?\n\n59:19.000 --> 59:21.000\nYeah, I woke up\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:23.000\nI'm like, this is an amazing movie\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:25.000\nLuke\n\n59:27.000 --> 59:29.000\nWishes he had $500,000\n\n59:29.000 --> 59:31.000\nTo buy the Turbo 5000\n\n59:33.000 --> 59:35.000\nI don't know anything about cars, by the way\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:37.000\nI think you become a genius in dreams\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:39.000\nFor some reason\n\n59:41.000 --> 59:43.000\nThe Turbo 5000, a hot rod\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:45.000\nThat would blow Brad's hot rod\n\n59:45.000 --> 59:47.000\nOut of the water\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:49.000\nBut Luke is poor\n\n59:49.000 --> 59:51.000\nAnd his dad is only\n\n59:51.000 --> 59:53.000\nA Chinese philosophy teacher\n\n59:55.000 --> 59:57.000\nThat's like the lowest job of all\n\n59:57.000 --> 59:59.000\nYeah\n\n59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000\nAnd he's Chinese\n\n01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nHe's a Chinese philosophy teacher\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000\nAnd he's Chinese\n\n01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000\nWait, wait\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000\nGo back\n\n01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000\nDoes he teach Chinese philosophy?\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000\nYeah, and he also happens\n\n01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000\nWell, I mean, happens\n\n01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000\nIt's no coincidence\n\n01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000\nHow do I know what?\n\n01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000\nHow do you know that from the\n\n01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000\nBecause I dreamed it, I saw it a little squinty\n\n01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000\nIt's your dream, okay, I'm sorry\n\n01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000\nI'm sorry\n\n01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000\nSo he's a Chinese philosophy teacher\n\n01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000\nThe most underfunded program\n\n01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000\nIn the college\n\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000\nLike you said\n\n01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000\nBrad's dad, the bad guy\n\n01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000\nRuns the auto arts and mechanics department\n\n01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000\nAnd is not only rich\n\n01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000\nBut makes sure Brad can add\n\n01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000\nCapitalist accessories\n\n01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000\nOn to his hot rod\n\n01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000\nYou just woke up\n\n01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000\nAnd wrote this\n\n01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000\nYes\n\n01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000\nI swear to God\n\n01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000\nSo Luke's dad, the little Chinaman\n\n01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000\nTells him\n\n01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000\nHe doesn't need material things\n\n01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000\nTo get Becky\n\n01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000\nHe can get her with his inner light\n\n01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000\nLuke's just\n\n01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000\nEmbarrassed of his dad\n\n01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000\nThe auto arts class\n\n01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000\nIn order to build a hot rod from scratch\n\n01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000\nBut Brad\n\n01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000\nWhose dad runs it\n\n01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000\nLearns the plan and gets his dad to\n\n01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000\nThwart Luke around every corner\n\n01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000\nLuke gets very frustrated\n\n01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000\nAnd in his\n\n01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000\nFinal desperation learns to\n\n01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000\nOvercome his frustrations through meditation\n\n01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000\nAnd finds his inner light\n\n01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000\nI'm only halfway through\n\n01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000\nWhen you finished thumbing this in\n\n01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000\nDid you have to go back to sleep\n\n01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000\nBecause your whole day had gone by\n\n01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000\nThrough this Luke makes the coolest\n\n01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000\nHot rod ever regardless of dad's\n\n01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000\nBrad's thwarting\n\n01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000\nIt's a day before the hot rod parade\n\n01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000\nAnd Brad just breaks into the shop\n\n01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000\nAnd destroys\n\n01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000\nI love that it's a hot rod parade\n\n01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000\nIt's not a race\n\n01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000\nBut you still gotta come in first\n\n01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000\nIt's a parade\n\n01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000\nIt's like there's a flag at the end\n\n01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000\nSo\n\n01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000\nSo Brad breaks into the shop\n\n01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000\nDestroys Luke's hot rod\n\n01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000\nLuke meditates so much\n\n01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000\nInner light\n\n01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000\nThat he is\n\n01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000\nObserved by a\n\n01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000\nMacArthur Grant committee member\n\n01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000\nMy friend\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000\nActually in New York\n\n01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000\nGot the MacArthur grant and I've been\n\n01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000\nObsessing over it for years actually\n\n01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000\nAnd\n\n01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000\nHe gets an award for his meditation\n\n01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000\nI don't know if you could get an award\n\n01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000\nPlus he wins Becky\n\n01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000\nAnd his dad says see\n\n01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000\nIt's\n\n01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000\nIt's not your material needs\n\n01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000\nIt's your light that got her\n\n01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000\nAnd Luke half heartedly at the end\n\n01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000\nSays thanks dad\n\n01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000\nAs the old Chinaman leaves\n\n01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000\nAnd then Luke winks at the camera\n\n01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000\nBecky with his brand new turbo 5000\n\n01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000\nThat he bought with the MacArthur grant money\n\n01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000\nAnd that's your\n\n01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000\nThat was the dream\n\n01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000\nSince then I added this\n\n01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000\nI added like flutes playing\n\n01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000\nAnd like you see\n\n01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000\nLuke's dad from behind like by a pond\n\n01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000\nLike just sitting peacefully\n\n01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000\nAnd just like it's from behind\n\n01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000\nAnd you close up on him\n\n01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000\nAnd it's just like really beautiful\n\n01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000\nAnd then you cut to in front of him\n\n01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000\nAnd he's just jacking off\n\n01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000\nI think that's a good ending\n\n01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000\nWell sorry what do you think\n\n01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000\nI had\n\n01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nI went to a therapist once\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000\nAnd he\n\n01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000\nAnd he said\n\n01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000\nAnd like he was really expensive\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000\nAnd I couldn't keep going to him\n\n01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000\nBut he said\n\n01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000\nGive yourself permission to have a\n\n01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000\nSignificant dream tonight\n\n01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000\nWhen you get home\n\n01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000\nI have this really significant dream\n\n01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000\nBut I never went back to the guy\n\n01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000\nMaybe we don't want to be healthy\n\n01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000\nNo we don't\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000\nYeah I don't want to be healthy\n\n01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000\nI don't think it was\n\n01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000\nI think I didn't go back to the guy\n\n01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000\nBecause he might have made me sane\n\n01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000\nYeah and who wants a sane Harmon\n\n01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000\nNo one\n\n01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000\nNot crazy Harmon\n\n01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000\nI don't know\n\n01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000\nWould you buy that movie\n\n01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000\nWhat\n\n01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nI didn't see Karate Kid\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000\nBut I think it has some Karate Kid in it\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000\nWhat sane Harmon\n\n01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000\nNo my pit\n\n01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000\nYou're such a narcissist\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000\nI'm talking about me\n\n01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nDo you remember my pitch\n\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000\nWith the Chinese guy\n\n01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000\nLittle Chinaman\n\n01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000\nCome on\n\n01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000\nNo\n\n01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000\nYou wouldn't buy it\n\n01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000\nYou wouldn't buy my dream\n\n01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000\nI'd like your dream\n\n01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000\nWould you buy it\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000\nI want it\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000\nI want it for a million

baby, what does that say?\n\n01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000\nYou're the exception\n\n01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000\nThat proves the rule\n\n01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000\nFind the candy

01:11:25.000\nAmbien\n\n01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000\nAnd it was amazing\n\n01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000\nBecause I could sleep\n\n01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000\nJust sleep, just effortlessly sleep\n\n01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000\nLike the\n\n01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000\nThe joy of just being able to\n\n01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000\nFucking go to sleep\n\n01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000\nAnd dream, you know what I mean\n\n01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000\nAnd feel completely rested the next day\n\n01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000\nThat in and of itself is addictive\n\n01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000\nBut it's also highly\n\n01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000\nChemically addictive\n\n01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000\nSo\n\n01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000\nSo my doctor\n\n01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000\nSo my doctor was like\n\n01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000\nAre you having side effects?\n\n01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000\nDo you sleep eat or sleep drive?\n\n01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000\nOr call people?\n\n01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000\nAnd I didn't do any of those things\n\n01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000\nI didn't have hallucinations\n\n01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000\nI didn't need to keep increasing my dose\n\n01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000\nSo she said just keep taking it\n\n01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000\nAnd I was like, I'm taking it every night\n\n01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000\nAnd she was like, well\n\n01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000\nIf it's working for you\n\n01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000\nGo ahead\n\n01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000\nSo like eight years later\n\n01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000\nI've been taking it every night for eight years\n\n01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000\nAnd these studies start coming out\n\n01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000\nThat link at long-term\n\n01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000\nAmbien used to like\n\n01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000\nMajor instances of like\n\n01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000\nEarly onset dementia\n\n01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000\nAnd cancer\n\n01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000\nAnd I started actually investigating it\n\n01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000\nAnd I learned this drug was never\n\n01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000\nDesigned or intended to be taken\n\n01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000\nLong-term, like at all\n\n01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000\nAll right, well that makes for a bad night\n\n01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000\nI think\n\n01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000\nYou deserve a second microphone\n\n01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000\nThere you go\n\n01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000\nI guess my experiment worked out perfectly\n\n01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000\nI haven't even gotten to the worst part yet\n\n01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000\nOh no, no\n\n01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000\nTake us to the worst\n\n01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000\nThe horror story kids, come on\n\n01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000\nUse both\n\n01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000\nOkay, I'm sorry\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000\nLike a ball joke in there\n\n01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000\nBut I don't know what to say\n\n01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000\nYou gotta wait in the fuck up when you're around here\n\n01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000\nOkay, so I went off\n\n01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000\nAmbien, I tapered off\n\n01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000\nI tapered off my dose\n\n01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000\nWhich is what you're supposed to do\n\n01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000\nYou tapered off your dose\n\n01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000\nYou know, like tape less and less\n\n01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000\nAnd then until I was finally off of it\n\n01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000\nAnd I had a couple nights where I didn't sleep at all\n\n01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000\nBut when you're an insomniac\n\n01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000\nYou're used to that, like that's kid stuff, right?\n\n01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000\nAnd then this other symptom\n\n01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000\nStarted all of a sudden, this withdrawal symptom\n\n01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000\nWhere\n\n01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000\nSo\n\n01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000\nYou know how you drift off, there's a name for this state\n\n01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000\nWhich I can't remember, but you know when you drift off to sleep\n\n01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000\nThere's that state in between\n\n01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000\nConscious and unconscious\n\n01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000\nYeah, it's like\n\n01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000\nHypogargic or something\n\n01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000\nHypnip jerk\n\n01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000\nHypnogargic\n\n01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000\nIt's called really tired\n\n01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000\nThat state\n\n01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000\nYou know how people get hypnip\n\n01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000\nIt's called the taint, I think\n\n01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000\nI'm tainty\n\n01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000\nI'm not in the balls of wakefulness\n\n01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000\nNor the anus hole\n\n01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000\nAll right\n\n01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000\nSo\n\n01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000\nYou know how when you fall asleep\n\n01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000\nEverybody gets this once in a while\n\n01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000\nThat thing where you're in that state\n\n01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000\nAnd you get that feeling that you're falling and you wake up\n\n01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000\nHypnip jerks\n\n01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000\nYeah, okay, hypnip jerks, right?\n\n01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000\nHypnip\n\n01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000\nIt's the name of my punk band\n\n01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000\nShe's crazy guys, take it easy\n\n01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000\nSo\n\n01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000\nI started getting this thing where\n\n01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000\nI was fall asleep and as soon as I would hit that state\n\n01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000\nI would get a surge of adrenaline and I wake up\n\n01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000\nAnd the thing is\n\n01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000\nIt happens every single time\n\n01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000\nSo as I lay there\n\n01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000\nFor the whole night, every single time\n\n01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000\nWhich is roughly every 10 minutes\n\n01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000\nEvery time I get tired enough to drift off to sleep\n\n01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000\nI get a surge of adrenaline\n\n01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000\nWhich feels like getting an epi-pen injection\n\n01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000\nWhich I know from allergies\n\n01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000\nAnd it hurts after a while\n\n01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000\nAnd so you wake up\n\n01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000\nThroughout the night again and again\n\n01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000\nYou don't get any sleep\n\n01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000\nYou keep getting adrenaline rushes\n\n01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000\nAnd then it keeps happening like every night\n\n01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000\nAll right\n\n01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000\nWell\n\n01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000\nSilver lining\n\n01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000\nIt has\n\n01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000\nTranquilized\n\n01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000\nBut if you can sleep and I can just watch you sleep\n\n01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000\nThat'll be enough for me\n\n01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000\nAll right, well\n\n01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000\nSorry, thanks for listening\n\n01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000\nNo, thank you for sharing your\n\n01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000\nSounds\n\n01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000\nTerrific\n\n01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000\nIt was a good story, but this is the park west\n\n01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000\nWe need to entertain people here\n\n01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000\nLet's do a little dance like you did\n\n01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000\nYeah, dance it baby\n\n01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000\nFight, how about a cat fight\n\n01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000\nLet's have a hand for Camilla\n\n01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000\nEverybody, thank you\n\n01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000\nAll right\n\n01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000\nOkay\n\n01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000\nThat social cue is not universal\n\n01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000\nWhat's the karma battery?\n\n01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000\nThe other day I was thinking\n\n01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000\nIt's\n\n01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000\nIt's\n\n01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000\nHow does the karma battery work?\n\n01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000\nAll right, Camilla\n\n01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000\nYou go back to\n\n01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000\nEnjoy the rest of the show, Camilla\n\n01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000\nAnd where I want to do another thing\n\n01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000\nWhere\n\n01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000\nYou stay here, Camille\n\n01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000\nCamille, yeah\n\n01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000\nI still want to find the anti-camille\n\n01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000\nOkay\n\n01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000\nWho's called Camilla out there?\n\n01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000\nAll right, you know what\n\n01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000\nYeah, come on up, sorry\n\n01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000\nYeah\n\n01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000\nTrying to sell tickets here\n\n01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000\nI know\n\n01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000\nThis guy\n\n01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000\nHe's got the weight of the world on his shoulders\n\n01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000\nI hope you know how to dance\n\n01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000\nOh, okay, here, sorry\n\n01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000\nYou don't have to look for it\n\n01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000\nAll right, what's your name, sir?\n\n01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000\nMy name is Sean\n\n01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000\nTell us about your evening\n\n01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000\nSay hi to Spencer\n\n01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000\nHey, Spencer\n\n01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000\nMy evening is going all right\n\n01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000\nI loved hearing how everything\n\n01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000\nWas really inspiring\n\n01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000\nFor you\n\n01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000\nEverything that's happened with this show\n\n01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000\nWas really inspiring for you\n\n01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000\nAnd it was kind of like\n\n01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000\nIt was kind of like that for me\n\n01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000\nWhen your show first started\n\n01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000\nWhen this podcast first started\n\n01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000\nThe thing that amazed me the most about it\n\n01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000\nWas that you and Jeff\n\n01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000\nNever quit\n\n01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000\nIf you're a freestyle\n\n01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000\nOr whatever didn't work, you just kept going\n\n01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000\nAnd you never gave up\n\n01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000\nAnd it was you and Aaron\n\n01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nSorry, and you guys never stopped\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000\nAnd I was just meeting\n\n01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000\nI was just meeting\n\n01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000\nI was just meeting\n\n01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000\nThe woman that I would marry\n\n01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000\nAnd I was like\n\n01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000\nOh my god, this guy never stops\n\n01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000\nIt's like sometimes it gets difficult\n\n01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000\nAnd sometimes it gets embarrassing\n\n01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000\nAnd sad, but he never stops\n\n01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000\nThis is amazing\n\n01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000\nNo matter how fat he gets\n\n01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000\nOr how unfunny he is\n\n01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000\nOr how gross everyone thinks he is\n\n01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000\nHow much everyone hates him\n\n01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000\nAnd then it stopped\n\n01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000\nAnd it's not your fault\n\n01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000\nOf course it's not your fault\n\n01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000\nIt's like\n\n01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000\nSomething was really sad about that\n\n01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000\nMan, something made me\n\n01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000\nReally sad\n\n01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000\nThey're turning against you\n\n01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000\nBecause what you and Aaron had going\n\n01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000\nIt seemed to mirror\n\n01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000\nMy relationship so perfectly\n\n01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000\nLeave them alone, Camilla\n\n01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000\nAnd\n\n01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000\nI just thought it was amazing\n\n01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000\nAnd then some changed\n\n01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000\nAnd I just, I guess I don't know how to\n\n01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000\nI shouldn't have this much investment\n\n01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000\nIn your life at all\n\n01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000\nAre you saying the podcast got worse\n\n01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000\nWhen...\n\n01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000\nNo, he's saying\n\n01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000\nHe's saying your desperation\n\n01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000\nTo be funny is kind of\n\n01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000\nSad and...\n\n01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000\nLike I'm saying\n\n01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000\nThere's been times\n\n01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000\nWhen I believe\n\n01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000\nThat what I was doing could work\n\n01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000\nBecause you always made it work\n\n01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000\nYou always made it work\n\n01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000\nYou never stopped\n\n01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000\nHe never stops\n\n01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000\nHe gets exhausted\n\n01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000\nYou're disillusioned by my\n\n01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000\nDisillusioned by your divorce\n\n01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000\nAnd that's completely unfair\n\n01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000\nIt's completely unfair\n\n01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000\nNever stopping isn't a good...\n\n01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000\nI have bipolar disorder\n\n01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000\nAnd sometimes I go really, really fast\n\n01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000\nBecause I get in like a manic episode\n\n01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000\nAnd it feels really good while it's happening\n\n01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000\nBut also you gotta stop sometimes\n\n01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000\nRight before the other poll\n\n01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000\nIt isn't good for you\n\n01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000\nIf you're bipolar\n\n01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000\nJust do the one poll\n\n01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000\nIt's cheating\n\n01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000\nIt seems like cheating\n\n01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000\nBut it's not good for you\n\n01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000\nBecause eventually you have to\n\n01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000\nFind like a middle ground\n\n01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000\nWell, I mean\n\n01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000\nObviously in some ways\n\n01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000\nI failed a lot with this experiment\n\n01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000\nBut\n\n01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000\nIn a lot of ways I did not at all\n\n01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000\nI did not at all\n\n01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000\nNo\n\n01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000\nYou're like this Tesla coil\n\n01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000\nExcitement\n\n01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000\nYou're like I fucking everything\n\n01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000\nI nailed it tonight\n\n01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000\nI just wanted some Oscar the Grouch to come up and go\n\n01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000\nWell, the line was too long\n\n01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000\nAnd\n\n01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000\nThe cookies had raisins\n\n01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000\nAnd I don't like raisins\n\n01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000\nAnd it's dumb of me to be a control freak\n\n01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000\nAnd think that I can like paint\n\n01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000\nWith human fucking souls\n\n01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000\nAnd I'm afraid that I'm never gonna make it\n\n01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000\nNow\n\n01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000\nBecause of\n\n01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000\nWhat you just did tonight\n\n01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000\nYou damaged something\n\n01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000\nNo\n\n01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000\nI feel like I invested too much\n\n01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000\nMaybe emotionally in your show\n\n01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000\nInto my show\n\n01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000\nInto my marriage with Aaron\n\n01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000\nIf that can't work then why\n\n01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000\nBecause they said it would work\n\n01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000\nThat marriage was built on paper and mush\n\n01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000\nIt was nothing\n\n01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000\nI was there mother fuckers\n\n01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000\nYou were\n\n01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000\nI remember\n\n01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000\nWhen Aaron said where you guys\n\n01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000\nHad your registry\n\n01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000\nSo I sent\n\n01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000\nI bought a gift off your registry\n\n01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000\nI never gave a name to it\n\n01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000\nBut I bought a gift off your registry\n\n01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000\nJust because I appreciated what you put out\n\n01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000\nThat's why you wait a year before you buy a wedding gift\n\n01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000\nShould I go?\n\n01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000\nThat's the tradition\n\n01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000\nPlease come on\n\n01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000\nLook\n\n01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000\nI'm glad you brought this up\n\n01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000\nI mean\n\n01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000\nOf course I'm gonna think about that too\n\n01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000\nI got married for 11 months\n\n01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000\nAnd then I got divorced\n\n01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000\nWhat the fuck does that even mean\n\n01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000\nI thought marriage meant something\n\n01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000\nHow could you be married for 11 months\n\n01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000\nIf it means something\n\n01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000\nThe fact that\n\n01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000\nWe never talk shit about each other\n\n01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000\nThe fact that we were on the same team\n\n01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000\nLike got married\n\n01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000\nDidn't find out that\n\n01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000\nMarriage was\n\n01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000\nOur best form together\n\n01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000\nAnd just went\n\n01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000\nI bid you adieu\n\n01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000\nAnd that we're not\n\n01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000\nStabbing each other in the face\n\n01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000\nI think it's a\n\n01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000\nSorry Spencer\n\n01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000\nWhat? Oh sorry\n\n01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000\nI'm sorry\n\n01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000\nI was checking my phone\n\n01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000\nI mean nobody gets married thinking\n\n01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000\nThey're gonna get divorced\n\n01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000\nThe first rate is like 85%\n\n01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000\nAnd I'm like\n\n01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000\nI do think\n\n01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000\nNot us honey\n\n01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000\nI could see definitely\n\n01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000\nI've been in relationships with people\n\n01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000\nWhen we've had weird totem couples\n\n01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000\nAnd those people break up\n\n01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000\nWoody Allen makes movies about that shit\n\n01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000\nWhere it's like oh they broke up\n\n01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000\nWhat does that mean about us\n\n01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000\nLike\n\n01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000\nFucking people\n\n01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000\nDivorce is the fucking best thing\n\n01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000\nPeople fucking stay together\n\n01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000\nIngmar Bergman\n\n01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000\nDirected this\n\n01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000\nSix\n\n01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000\nEpisode series\n\n01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000\nCalled Scenes from a Marriage\n\n01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000\nAnd he said the best thing that happened\n\n01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000\nWas after that aired the divorce rate\n\n01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000\nFucking skyrocketed\n\n01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000\nIn Sweden because people weren't making each other\n\n01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000\nMiserable in their kids\n\n01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000\nAnd divorce is great and we should\n\n01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000\nJust get the fuck\n\n01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:31.000\nMy high horse about divorce\n\n01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000\nNo it's great\n\n01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000\nI'm glad you guys are friends\n\n01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000\nAnd it's not a sad event\n\n01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000\nIt's great\n\n01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000\nBut it doesn't mean\n\n01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000\nThat love doesn't exist\n\n01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000\nThat's the mistake that we make\n\n01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000\nSay what?\n\n01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000\nHe said focus on science\n\n01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000\nFocus on science\n\n01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000\nProbably a Rick and Morty reference\n\n01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000\nOr something\n\n01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000\nAre those mutually exclusive really?\n\n01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000\nIs that where we're going?\n\n01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000\nYeah it's love or science\n\n01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000\nSpeaking of science\n\n01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000\nLook what I discovered\n\n01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000\nYou could like do this with mics\n\n01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000\nHave you guys been watching porn\n\n01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000\nWith each other by the way?\n\n01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000\nDoes this remind you of porn?\n\n01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000\nOh yeah I'm sorry\n\n01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000\nOkay so what was your name?\n\n01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000\nNewsy\n\n01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000\nYour

--> 01:25:33.000\nWe have three girls together\n\n01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000\nBut he's having another\n\n01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000\nHe had a baby already\n\n01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000\nHe's

01:25:45.000\nBeen trying to see you for a year and a half\n\n01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000\nDidn't get to\n\n01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000\nAs I'm in line\n\n01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000\nThe stepmom texts me that\n\n01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000\nShe's pregnant and having another baby\n\n01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000\nAnd they're buying this big gorgeous\n\n01:25:55.000 -->

get to have this big house\n\n01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000\nAnd my marriage was really bad\n\n01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000\nSo\n\n01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000\nAnd now he's like\n\n01:26:09.000 -->

you\n\n01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000\nYou guys have that kind of relationship\n\n01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000\nHe texts me anything that you think might\n\n01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000\nPsychologically\n\n01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000\nI'm having a really good night\n\n01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000\nWe get along for the most part\n\n01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000\nFor the kids\n\n01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000\nLet's play catchphrase\n\n01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000\nWe just stick around as a family\n\n01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000\nShe started throwing weird shit at me\n\n01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000\nLook how big my house is\n\n01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000\nI don't think she realizes\n\n01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000\nThe rude things\n\n01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000\nThere's random times where she's just like\n\n01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000\nOh well\n\n01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000\nShe told me she ain't been called out\n\n01:27:05.000 -->

decisions\n\n01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000\nThey're my kids\n\n01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000\nSo tonight was another thing\n\n01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000\nLook at our big giant house\n\n01:27:19.000

01:27:41.000\nMaybe half a time\n\n01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000\nHonestly, I think Anomalyza should\n\n01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000\nYeah, we're not going to get that\n\n01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000\nAnomalyza should have won the Golden Globe\n\n01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000\nReally, honestly\n\n01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000\nIf you're out there\n\n01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000\nAnd you're voting for the Oscars\n\n01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000\nI just want to ask you\n\n01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000\nIf a movie takes\n\n01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000\n800 people to make\n\n01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000\nCome on, how good can it be\n\n01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000\nWe only used\n\n01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000\n113 people\n\n01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000\nAnd look back into the 90s\n\n01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000\nThe fucking Herman's Head\n\n01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000\nYeah, Jesus Christ\n\n01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000\nIt's such a fucking

do with the venue\n\n01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000\nObviously what we've learned tonight\n\n01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000\nIs that this place is awesome\n\n01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000\nMaybe happier\n\n01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000\nBecause no one has any stories about\n\n01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000\nHaving to wait for anything\n\n01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000\nOff of the sidewalk\n\n01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000\nI didn't mean to\n\n01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000\nCome on, that's a terrible way\n\n01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000\nTo end the show\n\n01:28:49.000 -->

loved one right now\n\n01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000\nIt goes into you\n\n01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000\nYou're going to forget about all of that\n\n01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000\nAll of that man that done you wrong\n\n01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000\nThat done man done you wrong\n\n01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000\nAnd now that's\n\n01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000\nYour happiness is leaving your head\n\n01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000\nYou're a little less happy\n\n01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000\nYou're a little less happy\n\n01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000\nBut you're a little more happy\n\n01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000\nYou're both just equal out\n\n01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000\nThen we're just pacified\n\n01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000\nUp your version, Mary and the Count\n\n01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000\nCapitalism\n\n01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000\nCapitalism\n\n01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000\nIt works\n\n01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000\nCamille and

of your joy away\n\n01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000\nIt's that time where\n\n01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000\nYou always sing the sad version\n\n01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000\nOf Beethoven's poop in your butt\n\n01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000\nNo, it's that time when we\n\n01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000\nRecount the things that we've learned\n\n01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000\nBut also, Spencer, were

that you tell people\n\n01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000\nWhen they're finished\n\n01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000\nYou go to bed the rest of the day\n\n01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000\nAnd eventually get out of bed\n\n01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000\nAll right\n\n01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000\nSorry about that\n\n01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000\nHey, what is everybody\n\n01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000\nFrom here to here do?\n\n01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000\nHow do you know when you're finished?\n\n01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000\nAll right\n\n01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000\nChicago\n\n01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000\nCome on, you little scamp\n\n01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000\nWho are all you people?\n\n01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000\nThere's so many of you\n\n01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000\nAll right\n\n01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000\nSo, all right, let's do this\n\n01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000\nLet's finish the show in the best way\n\n01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000\nPossible\n\n01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000\nAnd it's not on me if it's bad\n\n01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000\nArmed combat\n\n01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000\nThere are\n\n01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000\nTwo weapons under two of those\n\n01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000\nStools\n\n01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000\nWe're gonna play it\n\n01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000\nDave's getting a head start\n\n01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000\nWe're gonna play a new experimental\n\n01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000\nGame\n\n01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000\nOkay, so\n\n01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000\nHave you guys ever heard of a game\n\n01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000\nCalled Super Fight?\n\n01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000\nNope\n\n01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000\nSo here's the deal\n\n01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000\nHave you ever played apples to apples?\n\n01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000\nYes\n\n01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000\nYou keep yelling at each other\n\n01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000\nAll right\n\n01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000\nWhat's gonna happen is you're gonna have cards\n\n01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000\nThat represent fighters\n\n01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000\nAnd they're gonna fight\n\n01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000\nBut you guys are gonna have to apples to apples\n\n01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000\nTo argue why your fighter is gonna win this fight\n\n01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000\nOkay\n\n01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000\nSo normally we gotta get like a consensus\n\n01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000\nBut maybe we can like use the audience\n\n01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000\nAs like the judge\n\n01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000\nOf who wins\n\n01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000\nTino's\n\n01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000\nI was texting, where are we doing something?\n\n01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000\nNo, I think\n\n01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000\nLet's just try a two-way fight\n\n01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000\nBetween the two of you\n\n01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000\nOh, I'm not in it\n\n01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:33.000\nOkay, I'm gonna go take a shit\n\n01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000\nAll right\n\n01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000\nSo which of you guys\n\n01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000\nDan, pick a white card\n\n01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000\nAnd a black card, and that will form your fighter\n\n01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000\nOkay, and then Friedel, you do the same\n\n01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.000\nWe only have\n\n01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000\nA bit of time\n\n01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000\nSo these are characters\n\n01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000\nAnd then they're gonna have attributes\n\n01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000\nAnd we're gonna see\n\n01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000\nWho's winning the fight\n\n01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000\nAnd you guys gotta really be comedic\n\n01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000\nOtherwise it's not gonna work\n\n01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000\nNo, I mean\n\n01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000\nWho cares\n\n01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000\nAll right, so Dan, you go first\n\n01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000\nWho's your fighter?\n\n01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000\nA crocodile hunter\n\n01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000\nWho is a hoarder\n\n01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000\nA crocodile hunter\n\n01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000\nWho is a hoarder\n\n01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000\nVersus\n\n01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000\nA queen armed with a sniper rifle\n\n01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000\nA queen armed with a sniper rifle\n\n01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000\nSo, okay\n\n01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000\nWho would win in a fight\n\n01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000\nBetween a crocodile hunter\n\n01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000\nWho's a hoarder\n\n01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000\nAnd a queen with a sniper rifle\n\n01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000\nWell, they gotta argue first\n\n01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000\nThey gotta argue\n\n01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000\nLet's hear them yell at each other\n\n01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000\nI will bring down the monarchy on you\n\n01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000\nI hunt crocodiles\n\n01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000\nSo when I hoard\n\n01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000\nWhat I'm hoarding are crocodiles\n\n01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000\nSo I'm like always\n\n01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000\nEven when I'm at my least functional\n\n01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000\nI'm surrounded by\n\n01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000\nOne of the most terrifying beasts\n\n01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000\nI'm a queen with a sniper rifle\n\n01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000\nI can shoot you from afar\n\n01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000\nWell, you can shoot a wall of crocodiles\n\n01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000\nFrom afar\n\n01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000\nI will have hoarded them\n\n01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000\nThat's what you'll see\n\n01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000\nI will have hoarded crocodiles\n\n01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000\nI hunt and hoard crocodiles\n\n01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000\nBut they are slow-moving, right?\n\n01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000\nThey can be dead\n\n01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000\nTheir skin is thick\n\n01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000\nCan they climb well?\n\n01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000\nThey stack well\n\n01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000\nI'm hoarding them\n\n01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000\nI'm not\n\n01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000\nRelying on them to do my bidding\n\n01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000\nI'm hoarding them\n\n01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000\nCarcasses and all\n\n01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000\nWhatever, I don't have any reloads\n\n01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000\nOn this sniper rifle\n\n01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000\nBut I imagine I can take you out from afar\n\n01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000\nThat's a good point\n\n01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000\nYou could shoot him before he unleashes the crocodiles\n\n01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000\nYou're just\n\n01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000\nHiding out watching that crocodile shed\n\n01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000\nBut I assume that this\n\n01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000\nThis conflict is happening\n\n01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000\nAt a moment subsequent to me\n\n01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000\nBeing identifiable as a hoarder\n\n01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000\nOf crocodiles\n\n01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000\nWhich means\n\n01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000\nThat\n\n01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000\nI am already fortified\n\n01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000\nWith crocodile flesh\n\n01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000\nAny closing arguments?\n\n01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000\nI got nothing\n\n01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000\nWhatever\n\n01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000\nI got a sniper rifle\n\n01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000\nI'm a coward\n\n01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000\nI'm the queen and the coward\n\n01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000\nDan?\n\n01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000\nI do one thing\n\n01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000\nDuring the day\n\n01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000\nI hunt crocodiles\n\n01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000\nI do one thing at night\n\n01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000\nI aggregate\n\n01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000\nCrocodiles\n\n01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000\nI live in a fucking\n\n01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000\nLike\n\n01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000\nCocoon of crocodile hide\n\n01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000\nSo\n\n01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000\nOkay, so\n\n01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000\nLet's do this by applause\n\n01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000\nWho thinks the crocodile hunter wins?\n\n01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000\nAnd who thinks the queen\n\n01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000\nWith the sniper rifle wins?\n\n01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000\nThat actually sounds kind of\n\n01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000\nI got to give the edge to the queen\n\n01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000\nWith the sniper rifle\n\n01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000\nOkay, alright\n\n01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000\nI feel like the sniper rifle\n\n01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000\nThe boys are\n\n01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000\nAnd I feel like there's a special place in hell\n\n01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000\nFor you, if you\n\n01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000\nSo that's a fair point\n\n01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000\nAnd I think a lot of people would agree\n\n01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000\nWith you and say that\n\n01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000\nEven if there's no evidence of it whatsoever\n\n01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000\nBut let's\n\n01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000\nDo you guys want to do another round?\n\n01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000\nWe could do one more round\n\n01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000\nAlright\n\n01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000\nDid Gino really look\n\n01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000\nLike Dan, you pick another fighter\n\n01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000\nAlright\n\n01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000\nSo what happens now is\n\n01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000\nWe got Dino\n\n01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000\nNow you pick another fighter\n\n01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000\nWho you can try and beat a queen\n\n01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000\nArmed with a sniper rifle\n\n01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000\nBecause that's the fight\n\n01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000\nYou see?\n\n01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000\nDino\n\n01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000\nDino, what were you doing?\n\n01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000\nWhat were you doing?\n\n01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000\nHe doesn't like games\n\n01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000\nI wasn't listening\n\n01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000\nI had to pick another\n\n01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000\nI got another\n\n01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000\nGo for it\n\n01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000\nWhat is it?\n\n01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000\nI'm an evil doll\n\n01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000\nCovered in eyes\n\n01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000\nOkay\n\n01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000\nSo that's taken on\n\n01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000\nThe reigning champion of queen\n\n01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000\nSo a doll\n\n01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000\nAn evil doll?\n\n01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000\nFull of eyes, covered in eyes\n\n01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000\nCovered in eyes\n\n01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000\nSo\n\n01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000\nSo now argue about that\n\n01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000\nYou have this still\n\n01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000\nYou got to keep this, it's the winner\n\n01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000\nYou're the winner, you won\n\n01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000\nI won, but\n\n01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000\nNo, no\n\n01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000\nThis is all good\n\n01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000\nYou're just still being the same thing\n\n01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000\nYeah, it's like a
