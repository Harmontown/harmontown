58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
I know sarcasm when I hear it

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
So you didn't like it

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Big deal

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Guess what, I made it up

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
It took me no time

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
So you're sitting there judging it

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
You're like, I didn't like this as much as the other thing

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
I don't even know what it is

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
You robot

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
I just live from

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
I'm a genius

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Can I pitch something to you?

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
I ate a pizza the other night

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Like a whole pizza before I went to sleep

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
And then I had a dream

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
But it was a dream

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
It was a whole fucking like movie

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
And I wrote it down

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
When I woke up, can I pitch the movie to you?

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
I swear to God, this is all a dream

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
And it's supposed to be a comedy

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
It's called Hot Rod Parade

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
It's called, I'm sorry

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Hot Rod Parade

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Hot rod, like a hot rod

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
A hot rod

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
So, Luke is in love with Becky

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
But she's into Brad

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Because he's got the hottest hot rod

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
That she knows

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
And she knows it's going to come

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
In first place at the local Hot Rod Parade

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
You dreamt this and then wrote it down?

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Yeah, I woke up

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
I'm like, this is an amazing movie

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Luke

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Wishes he had $500,000

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
To buy the Turbo 5000

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
I don't know anything about cars, by the way

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
I think you become a genius in dreams

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
For some reason

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
The Turbo 5000, a hot rod

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
That would blow Brad's hot rod

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Out of the water

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
But Luke is poor

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
And his dad is only

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
A Chinese philosophy teacher

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
That's like the lowest job of all

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Yeah

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
And he's Chinese

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
He's a Chinese philosophy teacher

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
And he's Chinese

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Wait, wait

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Go back

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
What do you mean?

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Does he teach Chinese philosophy?

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Yeah, and he also happens

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Well, I mean, happens

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
It's no coincidence

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
How do I know what?

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
How do you know that from the

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Because I dreamed it, I saw it a little squinty

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
It's your dream, okay, I'm sorry

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
I'm sorry

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
So he's a Chinese philosophy teacher

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
The most underfunded program

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
In the college

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Like you said

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Brad's dad, the bad guy

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Runs the auto arts and mechanics department

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
And is not only rich

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
But makes sure Brad can add

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Capitalist accessories

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
On to his hot rod

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
You just woke up

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
And wrote this

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Yes

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
I swear to God

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
So Luke's dad, the little Chinaman

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Tells him

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
He doesn't need material things

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
To get Becky

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
He can get her with his inner light

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Luke's just

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Embarrassed of his dad

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
The auto arts class

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
In order to build a hot rod from scratch

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
But Brad

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Whose dad runs it

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Learns the plan and gets his dad to

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Thwart Luke around every corner

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Luke gets very frustrated

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
And in his

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Final desperation learns to

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Overcome his frustrations through meditation

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
And finds his inner light

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
I'm only halfway through

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
When you finished thumbing this in

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Did you have to go back to sleep

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Because your whole day had gone by

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Through this Luke makes the coolest

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Hot rod ever regardless of dad's

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Brad's thwarting

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
It's a day before the hot rod parade

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
And Brad just breaks into the shop

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
And destroys

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I love that it's a hot rod parade

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
It's not a race

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
But you still gotta come in first

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
It's a parade

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
It's like there's a flag at the end

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
So

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
So Brad breaks into the shop

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Destroys Luke's hot rod

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Luke meditates so much

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Inner light

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
That he is

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Observed by a

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
MacArthur Grant committee member

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
My friend

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Actually in New York

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Got the MacArthur grant and I've been

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Obsessing over it for years actually

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
And

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
He gets an award for his meditation

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I don't know if you could get an award

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Plus he wins Becky

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
And his dad says see

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
It's

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
It's not your material needs

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
It's your light that got her

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
And Luke half heartedly at the end

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Says thanks dad

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
As the old Chinaman leaves

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
And then Luke winks at the camera

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Becky with his brand new turbo 5000

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
That he bought with the MacArthur grant money

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
And that's your

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
That was the dream

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Since then I added this

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
I added like flutes playing

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
And like you see

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Luke's dad from behind like by a pond

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Like just sitting peacefully

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
And just like it's from behind

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
And you close up on him

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
And it's just like really beautiful

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
And then you cut to in front of him

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
And he's just jacking off

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
I think that's a good ending

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Well sorry what do you think

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
I had

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I went to a therapist once

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
And he

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
And he said

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
And like he was really expensive

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
And I couldn't keep going to him

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
But he said

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Give yourself permission to have a

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Significant dream tonight

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
When you get home

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
I have this really significant dream

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
But I never went back to the guy

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Maybe we don't want to be healthy

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
No we don't

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Yeah I don't want to be healthy

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I don't think it was

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
I think I didn't go back to the guy

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Because he might have made me sane

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Yeah and who wants a sane Harmon

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
No one

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Not crazy Harmon

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I don't know

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Would you buy that movie

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
What

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
I didn't see Karate Kid

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
But I think it has some Karate Kid in it

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
What sane Harmon

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
No my pit

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
You're such a narcissist

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I'm talking about me

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Do you remember my pitch

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
With the Chinese guy

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Little Chinaman

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Come on

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
No

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
You wouldn't buy it

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
You wouldn't buy my dream

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I'd like your dream

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Would you buy it

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
I want it

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
I want it for a million dollars

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
I guarantee

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
The show is going to be over

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
We're going to be eating Greek food

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
He's going to say I lied about a million dollars

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Alright

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I want to do a new thing tonight

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
We're going to create a karma battery

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
I want the person

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
The best night of their life

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Somebody left to their feet

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Is that a young lady

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
You

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Yes, you

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Come up

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
If you're

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Come on down

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
I don't know what I'm doing

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
It doesn't matter

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Let's see what she has to pitch

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
What's your name

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
My name is Camille

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Camille, alright, Camille

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
We know of Camille

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
I'm from Minnesota

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I go to college here

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Which college

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
I go to Columbia College Chicago

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Columbia

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
You know I went to Columbia

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
I fake graduated there

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I pretended I graduated

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
I stole

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Jesus fucking Christ

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
That's right

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Ask Pastor George

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
I already forgot your name

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Camille

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Just think of Camille Cosby, right?

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
No

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Why?

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Just think of the sound of Camille

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
It's a name

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
That's his wife

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
That's the wife he fucked around on

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
He gave pills to women

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I'm so sorry

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Camille, so you're kind of

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
You're feeling your privilege

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
You're walking on the fucking cloud

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
I'm so happy right now

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Give me just examples

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Just little snatches of it

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Okay

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
So like

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Lowkey, you've saved my life a bunch of times

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Lowkey? The god of mischief

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Saved your life?

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
That's a Norwegian god, right?

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Lowkey

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
It's going to get really personal

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Are you Norwegian?

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Or macro cosmological

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Maybe

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
There's a Tesseractin ball

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Probably

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Sorry

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
That's the chair

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
That was the chair

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I have a lot of

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
I

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Go ahead

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
I've had some issues with like mental health in my life

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
And I've gotten a lot better recently

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
How did you end up in my audience?

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
I know, don't let me get there

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
And I listen to your podcast

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
And you make me laugh

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Well, all of you do

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Do I make you laugh too?

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Well, tonight you're kind of

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
On the edge a little bit

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Like you said the N word at the beginning

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Which N word?

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
What?

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I don't know

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Then why are you worried about it?

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I like you though, I think you're really funny

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
I appreciate you

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
I appreciate you

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
But I would like listen to your podcast

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
And you would make me laugh

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
And it would just make me really happy

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
And I love this whole crowd

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Like you guys are the best people in the world

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Okay, and the reason that today is

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Like the best day of my life, right?

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Is because I didn't know that there was a show tonight

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
But then I found out and it was already sold out

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
And I was like, oh man, but I got to be here

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
So I like

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Got down here, I took the brown line

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
And I was just going to like wait in line

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
And like see what kind of miracles could happen, right?

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
And

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I was waiting out like in the like

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
At the end of the line and the two most wonderful people

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
In the world, Spencer and Nicole

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
They're my new friends

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
They were behind me talking

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
And I was like listening to music

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Like I was listening to the Ben Folds cover

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Of Bitches Ain't Shit

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
But it was quiet enough

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
That I could hear Spencer talking behind me

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Not this Spencer, not me

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
And he said that he had a free ticket

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Well he didn't have a free ticket, but he had an extra ticket

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
And I turned around and I was like, dude, you have an extra ticket?

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
And he was like, yeah, I'll just give it to you

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
So he gave me his extra ticket

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
And now I'm here and I'm talking to you

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Nice guy, yeah

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
This is like the best night of my life

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
So I'm just really happy

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Thank you so much

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Thank you, Spencer and Nicole

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Thank you so much

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
So now you know what I want to do, but it feels terrible

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Like I kind of like I just have this weird mad scientist

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Directive, like I have to

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Find a person who had the worst night tonight

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Oh no!

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
I want to just watch the electricity

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Ark

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Like between the two people

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
And listen man

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
If in your heart

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
You were really like cranky tonight

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
And like I had a bad night

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Okay, young lady

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Do you want to come up?

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Yeah

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
I just kind of, I don't know, curious

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Have her stay up here and then

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Have them fight it out, like punch out

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
They don't have any quarrel with each other

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
It's just that they've had two different nights

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Not quarrels, just fight, punch, like a cat fight

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Come over here and

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Is there

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
There's a

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Dino, you have a mic

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Find the candy baby

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
There we go

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Thank you very much

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Fool me once

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
What was your name?

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Camilla

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Oh my god

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Don't touch each other

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
It's like time cop

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
This is great

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Holy shit, my name's Camilla

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I am the best podcast ever

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
My name's Camilla too

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Okay, Camilla, what was your experience?

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Well

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
So I'm an insomniac

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Like a lot of people

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Like a lot of creative people

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Don't go to them

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
I sleep like a baby, what does that say?

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
You're the exception

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
That proves the rule

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Find the candy baby

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Oh my soul

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
So about eight years ago

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
My doctor gave me some

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Ambien

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
And it was amazing

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Because I could sleep

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Just sleep, just effortlessly sleep

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Like the

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
The joy of just being able to

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Fucking go to sleep

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
And dream, you know what I mean

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
And feel completely rested the next day

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
That in and of itself is addictive

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
But it's also highly

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Chemically addictive

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
So

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
So my doctor

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
So my doctor was like

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Are you having side effects?

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Do you sleep eat or sleep drive?

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Or call people?

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
And I didn't do any of those things

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
I didn't have hallucinations

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
I didn't need to keep increasing my dose

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
So she said just keep taking it

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
And I was like, I'm taking it every night

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
And she was like, well

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
If it's working for you

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Go ahead

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
So like eight years later

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
I've been taking it every night for eight years

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
And these studies start coming out

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
That link at long-term

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Ambien used to like

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Major instances of like

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Early onset dementia

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
And cancer

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
And I started actually investigating it

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
And I learned this drug was never

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Designed or intended to be taken

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Long-term, like at all

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
All right, well that makes for a bad night

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
I think

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
You deserve a second microphone

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
There you go

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
I guess my experiment worked out perfectly

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
I haven't even gotten to the worst part yet

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Oh no, no

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Take us to the worst

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
The horror story kids, come on

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Use both

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Okay, I'm sorry

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Like a ball joke in there

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
But I don't know what to say

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
You gotta wait in the fuck up when you're around here

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Okay, so I went off

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Ambien, I tapered off

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
I tapered off my dose

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Which is what you're supposed to do

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
You tapered off your dose

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
You know, like tape less and less

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
And then until I was finally off of it

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
And I had a couple nights where I didn't sleep at all

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
But when you're an insomniac

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
You're used to that, like that's kid stuff, right?

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
And then this other symptom

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Started all of a sudden, this withdrawal symptom

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Where

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
So

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
You know how you drift off, there's a name for this state

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Which I can't remember, but you know when you drift off to sleep

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
There's that state in between

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Conscious and unconscious

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Yeah, it's like

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Hypogargic or something

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Hypnip jerk

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Hypnogargic

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
It's called really tired

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
That state

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
You know how people get hypnip

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
It's called the taint, I think

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
I'm tainty

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
I'm not in the balls of wakefulness

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Nor the anus hole

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
All right

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
So

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
You know how when you fall asleep

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Everybody gets this once in a while

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
That thing where you're in that state

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
And you get that feeling that you're falling and you wake up

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Hypnip jerks

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Yeah, okay, hypnip jerks, right?

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Hypnip

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
It's the name of my punk band

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
She's crazy guys, take it easy

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
So

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
I started getting this thing where

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
I was fall asleep and as soon as I would hit that state

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
I would get a surge of adrenaline and I wake up

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
And the thing is

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
It happens every single time

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
So as I lay there

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
For the whole night, every single time

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Which is roughly every 10 minutes

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Every time I get tired enough to drift off to sleep

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
I get a surge of adrenaline

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Which feels like getting an epi-pen injection

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Which I know from allergies

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
And it hurts after a while

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
And so you wake up

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Throughout the night again and again

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
You don't get any sleep

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
You keep getting adrenaline rushes

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
And then it keeps happening like every night

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
All right

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Well

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Silver lining

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
It has

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Tranquilized

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
But if you can sleep and I can just watch you sleep

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
That'll be enough for me

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
All right, well

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Sorry, thanks for listening

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
No, thank you for sharing your

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Sounds

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Terrific

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
It was a good story, but this is the park west

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
We need to entertain people here

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Let's do a little dance like you did

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Yeah, dance it baby

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Fight, how about a cat fight

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Let's have a hand for Camilla

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Everybody, thank you

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
All right

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Okay

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
That social cue is not universal

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
What's the karma battery?

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
The other day I was thinking

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
It's

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
It's

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
How does the karma battery work?

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
All right, Camilla

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
You go back to

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Enjoy the rest of the show, Camilla

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
And where I want to do another thing

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Where

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
You stay here, Camille

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Camille, yeah

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
I still want to find the anti-camille

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Okay

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Who's called Camilla out there?

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
All right, you know what

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Yeah, come on up, sorry

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Yeah

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Trying to sell tickets here

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
I know

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
This guy

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
He's got the weight of the world on his shoulders

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
I hope you know how to dance

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Oh, okay, here, sorry

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
You don't have to look for it

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
All right, what's your name, sir?

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
My name is Sean

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Tell us about your evening

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Say hi to Spencer

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Hey, Spencer

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
My evening is going all right

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
I loved hearing how everything

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Was really inspiring

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
For you

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Everything that's happened with this show

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Was really inspiring for you

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
And it was kind of like

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
It was kind of like that for me

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
When your show first started

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
When this podcast first started

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
The thing that amazed me the most about it

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Was that you and Jeff

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Never quit

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
If you're a freestyle

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Or whatever didn't work, you just kept going

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
And you never gave up

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
And it was you and Aaron

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Sorry, and you guys never stopped

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
And I was just meeting

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
I was just meeting

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
I was just meeting

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
The woman that I would marry

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
And I was like

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Oh my god, this guy never stops

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
It's like sometimes it gets difficult

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
And sometimes it gets embarrassing

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
And sad, but he never stops

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
This is amazing

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
No matter how fat he gets

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Or how unfunny he is

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Or how gross everyone thinks he is

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
How much everyone hates him

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
And then it stopped

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
And it's not your fault

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Of course it's not your fault

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
It's like

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Something was really sad about that

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Man, something made me

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Really sad

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
They're turning against you

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Because what you and Aaron had going

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
It seemed to mirror

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
My relationship so perfectly

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Leave them alone, Camilla

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
And

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
I just thought it was amazing

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
And then some changed

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
And I just, I guess I don't know how to

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
I shouldn't have this much investment

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
In your life at all

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Are you saying the podcast got worse

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
When...

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
No, he's saying

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
He's saying your desperation

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
To be funny is kind of

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Sad and...

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Like I'm saying

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
There's been times

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
When I believe

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
That what I was doing could work

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Because you always made it work

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
You always made it work

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
You never stopped

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
He never stops

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
He gets exhausted

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
You're disillusioned by my

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Disillusioned by your divorce

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
And that's completely unfair

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
It's completely unfair

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Never stopping isn't a good...

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
I have bipolar disorder

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
And sometimes I go really, really fast

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Because I get in like a manic episode

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
And it feels really good while it's happening

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
But also you gotta stop sometimes

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Right before the other poll

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
It isn't good for you

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
If you're bipolar

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Just do the one poll

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
It's cheating

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
It seems like cheating

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
But it's not good for you

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Because eventually you have to

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Find like a middle ground

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Well, I mean

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Obviously in some ways

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
I failed a lot with this experiment

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
But

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
In a lot of ways I did not at all

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
I did not at all

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
No

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
You're like this Tesla coil

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Excitement

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
You're like I fucking everything

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
I nailed it tonight

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
I just wanted some Oscar the Grouch to come up and go

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Well, the line was too long

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
And

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
The cookies had raisins

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
And I don't like raisins

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
And it's dumb of me to be a control freak

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
And think that I can like paint

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
With human fucking souls

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
And I'm afraid that I'm never gonna make it

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Now

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Because of

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
What you just did tonight

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
You damaged something

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
No

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
I feel like I invested too much

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Maybe emotionally in your show

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Into my show

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Into my marriage with Aaron

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
If that can't work then why

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Because they said it would work

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
That marriage was built on paper and mush

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
It was nothing

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
I was there mother fuckers

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000
You were

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
I remember

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
When Aaron said where you guys

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Had your registry

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
So I sent

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
I bought a gift off your registry

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
I never gave a name to it

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
But I bought a gift off your registry

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Just because I appreciated what you put out

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
That's why you wait a year before you buy a wedding gift

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Should I go?

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
That's the tradition

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Please come on

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Look

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
I'm glad you brought this up

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
I mean

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Of course I'm gonna think about that too

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
I got married for 11 months

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
And then I got divorced

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
What the fuck does that even mean

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
I thought marriage meant something

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
How could you be married for 11 months

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
If it means something

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
The fact that

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
We never talk shit about each other

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
The fact that we were on the same team

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Like got married

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Didn't find out that

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Marriage was

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Our best form together

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
And just went

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
I bid you adieu

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
And that we're not

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Stabbing each other in the face

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
I think it's a

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Sorry Spencer

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
What? Oh sorry

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
I'm sorry

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
I was checking my phone

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
I mean nobody gets married thinking

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
They're gonna get divorced

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
The first rate is like 85%

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
And I'm like

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
I do think

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Not us honey

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
I could see definitely

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
I've been in relationships with people

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
When we've had weird totem couples

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
And those people break up

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Woody Allen makes movies about that shit

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Where it's like oh they broke up

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
What does that mean about us

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Like

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Fucking people

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Divorce is the fucking best thing

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
People fucking stay together

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Ingmar Bergman

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Directed this

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Six

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Episode series

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Called Scenes from a Marriage

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
And he said the best thing that happened

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Was after that aired the divorce rate

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Fucking skyrocketed

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
In Sweden because people weren't making each other

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Miserable in their kids

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
And divorce is great and we should

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Just get the fuck

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:31.000
My high horse about divorce

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
No it's great

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
I'm glad you guys are friends

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
And it's not a sad event

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
It's great

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
But it doesn't mean

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
That love doesn't exist

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
That's the mistake that we make

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Say what?

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
He said focus on science

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Focus on science

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Probably a Rick and Morty reference

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Or something

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Are those mutually exclusive really?

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Is that where we're going?

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Yeah it's love or science

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Speaking of science

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Look what I discovered

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
You could like do this with mics

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Have you guys been watching porn

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
With each other by the way?

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Does this remind you of porn?

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Oh yeah I'm sorry

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Okay so what was your name?

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Newsy

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Your name was not Newsy

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
It's Sean right?

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Sean?

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
This is bullying

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I was bullying you

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
I'm rubbing off on you I think

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
I bullied you

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
I bullied you

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
I bullied you

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
He's been bullied

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Sean

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Camille

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Stay there

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
I want to break your soul

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
You want to break my soul?

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
It's going to be hard

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
People say that I'm like a Morty

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
You're pointing at your friend

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Or are you pointing at yourself

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Did you ask her up or she just came out?

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
She's got a little bit of both

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
What's your name?

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Trisha, okay so do you think you have

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
The anti-camille?

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
I had an emotional bad day

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
So I'm divorced

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Yeah

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
It's been a little while

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
He's getting remarried

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
We have three girls together

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
But he's having another

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
He had a baby already

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
He's about to be two

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
As I'm standing in line to this wonderful show

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Where I'm super excited and never got to see you

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Been trying to see you for a year and a half

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Didn't get to

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
As I'm in line

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
The stepmom texts me that

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
She's pregnant and having another baby

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
And they're buying this big gorgeous

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Home somewhere in town

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
And so I was like okay

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
My children get to live with you

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
You get to have this big house

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
And my marriage was really bad

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
So

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
And now he's like

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
And he is actually really sweet to her

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
And he treats her really well

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
And I was like well that could have been my family

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
So where's my big house

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
And where's my extra babies

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
They still love my thunder

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
I don't know what the

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
I was the

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Before wife and now she gets

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
The good part of

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
It's a gamble baby

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
You pulled out too soon

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Why is she texting you

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
You guys have that kind of relationship

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
He texts me anything that you think might

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Psychologically

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
I'm having a really good night

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
We get along for the most part

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
For the kids

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Let's play catchphrase

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
We just stick around as a family

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
She started throwing weird shit at me

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Look how big my house is

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
I don't think she realizes

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
The rude things

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
There's random times where she's just like

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Oh well

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
She told me she ain't been called out

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
I'm too nice

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
I am

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
She has the weird stabs at me

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
It's a week to make these decisions

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
They're my kids

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
So tonight was another thing

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Look at our big giant house

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
By the way, I'm having another baby

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
I feel like this is compatible

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
You had this great night

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
You're like Amy Poehler

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Inside out

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
I'm Mr. Sunshine Pants

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Yes, exactly

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
And you're Blueberry

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
But whatever

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
I watched the movie

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Maybe half a time

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Honestly, I think Anomalyza should

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Yeah, we're not going to get that

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Anomalyza should have won the Golden Globe

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Really, honestly

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
If you're out there

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
And you're voting for the Oscars

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
I just want to ask you

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
If a movie takes

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
800 people to make

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Come on, how good can it be

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
We only used

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
113 people

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
And look back into the 90s

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
The fucking Herman's Head

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Yeah, Jesus Christ

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
It's such a fucking trope

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Come on, stop

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
You didn't hear that shit from me

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
I want that Oscar, man

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Nothing's more important than the world

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Your name was Trisha

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Trisha

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Had nothing to do with the venue

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Obviously what we've learned tonight

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Is that this place is awesome

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Maybe happier

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Because no one has any stories about

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Having to wait for anything

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Off of the sidewalk

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
I didn't mean to

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Come on, that's a terrible way

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
To end the show

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
I just want to suck some of your energy

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
I'm sorry

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Not any of yours

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
I want to suck some of your energy

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
And give it to her

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
That's it, that's all I'm going to do

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
How are you going to do that

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
What's your social security number?

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
What's your social security number?

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Last four numbers

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Four, three

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Four, three, two, one

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Four, three, two, three

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Four, three, two, six

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Four, three, two, six

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Social security number going into

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
This loved one right now

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
It goes into you

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
You're going to forget about all of that

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
All of that man that done you wrong

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
That done man done you wrong

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
And now that's

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Your happiness is leaving your head

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
You're a little less happy

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
You're a little less happy

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
But you're a little more happy

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
You're both just equal out

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Then we're just pacified

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Up your version, Mary and the Count

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Capitalism

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Capitalism

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
It works

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Camille and Tricia

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Give them a big hand

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
I mean

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Yeah

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Yeah, I know, I know, it's not your fault

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Yeah, no, yes, go ahead, go leave

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm sorry

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
We didn't take any of your joy away

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
It's that time where

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
You always sing the sad version

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Of Beethoven's poop in your butt

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
No, it's that time when we

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Recount the things that we've learned

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
But also, Spencer, were we

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
It's that time where you reject Dino's way

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Of getting out of the show

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Wasn't there a game that we

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
We're running, we're running, we're running

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Overtime, I don't know

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
We don't have much time

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Isn't Dave Friedel here?

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Yeah, Dave Friedel's here

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
You have time?

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
I mean, we have a cutoff

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
What's the time?

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
It's a second to the cutoff

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
No, we have 15 minutes

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
I don't know, I love Dave Friedel

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Bring Friedel up here

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
We owe these people a show

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
He might not want to come

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Yeah, he doesn't have to, who cares

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
I doubt it, he's coming

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
I guess he's on the second floor

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
That guy's going to the bar

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
My name is Friedel

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
I'm coming from the second floor

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
He's coming down the stairs

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
House lights up, please

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
There he is

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
He's in the checkered

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
David Friedel, everyone

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Harmon's best friend from Milwaukee

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Has he been on the show before?

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
We should probably meet some of the

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
I couldn't hear you

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
What's your name, sir?

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
I'm Bob

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
What's your name, sir?

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Colin

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
What do you do for a living?

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Nothing

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
How do you know when you're finished?

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
It actually worked

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
He said the setup

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
What do you do for a living?

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
I'm a writer

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
You know because you finish writing

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
What do you do for a living?

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
I work on websites for the government

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
You probably know

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
You probably know when you're finished

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
It's for kids with autism

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Congratulations

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
You fucking throng of shit fucks

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
And just add

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
No one will ever look it up

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Tell them it's transgender autistics

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
They're going through a lot of ideas

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Dude, Jeff, way to go

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Big nuts

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
What do you do for a living?

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Your mom

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
How do you

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
All right

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Come on, Chicago

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
How do you

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Wait, no

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
No one does my mom

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
No

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
I'm in control

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
I'm in control of this room

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
I ask you again, madam

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
What do you do?

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Sir, I was just trying to tell you my honest

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Occupation, I do it your mother

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
What? No

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
No

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
I don't know

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
It's a theater town

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Are you going to be Oprah

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
And interview Friedel from there?

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Friedel

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Wait

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Just give me one second

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
What's your name, sir? I'm Dave

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Dave, how do you know when you're finished?

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
What's your name? Harry Charles

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Harry Charles, all right

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Fucking specific

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
For real

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Just told you his name

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
That's not

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
What?

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
All right, just give me

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
What do you do, sir?

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
I tell people when they're finished

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
How do you

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Wait, well take me through

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Your normal work day

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
So you know there's a start

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Right

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
What do you do first thing in the morning?

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Jerk off

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
And then when you finish

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
With that you tell people

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
When they're finished

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
You go to bed the rest of the day

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
And eventually get out of bed

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
All right

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Sorry about that

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Hey, what is everybody

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
From here to here do?

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
How do you know when you're finished?

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
All right

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Chicago

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Come on, you little scamp

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Who are all you people?

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
There's so many of you

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
All right

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
So, all right, let's do this

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Let's finish the show in the best way

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Possible

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
And it's not on me if it's bad

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Armed combat

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
There are

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Two weapons under two of those

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Stools

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
We're gonna play it

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Dave's getting a head start

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
We're gonna play a new experimental

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Game

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Okay, so

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Have you guys ever heard of a game

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Called Super Fight?

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Nope

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
So here's the deal

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Have you ever played apples to apples?

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Yes

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
You keep yelling at each other

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
All right

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
What's gonna happen is you're gonna have cards

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
That represent fighters

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
And they're gonna fight

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
But you guys are gonna have to apples to apples

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
To argue why your fighter is gonna win this fight

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Okay

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
So normally we gotta get like a consensus

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
But maybe we can like use the audience

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
As like the judge

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Of who wins

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Tino's

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
I was texting, where are we doing something?

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
No, I think

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Let's just try a two-way fight

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Between the two of you

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Oh, I'm not in it

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Okay, I'm gonna go take a shit

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
All right

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
So which of you guys

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Dan, pick a white card

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
And a black card, and that will form your fighter

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Okay, and then Friedel, you do the same

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.000
We only have

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
A bit of time

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
So these are characters

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
And then they're gonna have attributes

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
And we're gonna see

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Who's winning the fight

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
And you guys gotta really be comedic

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Otherwise it's not gonna work

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
No, I mean

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Who cares

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
All right, so Dan, you go first

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Who's your fighter?

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
A crocodile hunter

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Who is a hoarder

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
A crocodile hunter

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Who is a hoarder

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Versus

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
A queen armed with a sniper rifle

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
A queen armed with a sniper rifle

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
So, okay

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Who would win in a fight

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Between a crocodile hunter

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Who's a hoarder

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
And a queen with a sniper rifle

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Well, they gotta argue first

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
They gotta argue

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Let's hear them yell at each other

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
I will bring down the monarchy on you

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
I hunt crocodiles

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
So when I hoard

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
What I'm hoarding are crocodiles

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
So I'm like always

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Even when I'm at my least functional

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
I'm surrounded by

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
One of the most terrifying beasts

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
I'm a queen with a sniper rifle

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
I can shoot you from afar

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Well, you can shoot a wall of crocodiles

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
From afar

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
I will have hoarded them

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
That's what you'll see

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
I will have hoarded crocodiles

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
I hunt and hoard crocodiles

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
But they are slow-moving, right?

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
They can be dead

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Their skin is thick

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Can they climb well?

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
They stack well

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
I'm hoarding them

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
I'm not

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Relying on them to do my bidding

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
I'm hoarding them

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Carcasses and all

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Whatever, I don't have any reloads

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
On this sniper rifle

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
But I imagine I can take you out from afar

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
That's a good point

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
You could shoot him before he unleashes the crocodiles

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
You're just

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Hiding out watching that crocodile shed

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
But I assume that this

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
This conflict is happening

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
At a moment subsequent to me

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Being identifiable as a hoarder

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Of crocodiles

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Which means

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
That

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
I am already fortified

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
With crocodile flesh

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Any closing arguments?

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
I got nothing

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Whatever

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
I got a sniper rifle

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
I'm a coward

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
I'm the queen and the coward

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Dan?

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
I do one thing

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
During the day

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
I hunt crocodiles

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
I do one thing at night

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
I aggregate

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Crocodiles

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
I live in a fucking

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Like

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Cocoon of crocodile hide

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
So

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Okay, so

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Let's do this by applause

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Who thinks the crocodile hunter wins?

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
And who thinks the queen

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
With the sniper rifle wins?

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
That actually sounds kind of

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
I got to give the edge to the queen

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
With the sniper rifle

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Okay, alright

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
I feel like the sniper rifle

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
The boys are

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
And I feel like there's a special place in hell

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
For you, if you

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
So that's a fair point

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
And I think a lot of people would agree

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
With you and say that

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Even if there's no evidence of it whatsoever

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
But let's

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Do you guys want to do another round?

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
We could do one more round

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Alright

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Did Gino really look

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Like Dan, you pick another fighter

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Alright

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
So what happens now is

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
We got Dino

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Now you pick another fighter

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Who you can try and beat a queen

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Armed with a sniper rifle

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Because that's the fight

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
You see?

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Dino

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Dino, what were you doing?

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
What were you doing?

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
He doesn't like games

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
I wasn't listening

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
I had to pick another

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
I got another

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Go for it

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
What is it?

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
I'm an evil doll

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Covered in eyes

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Okay

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
So that's taken on

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
The reigning champion of queen

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
So a doll

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
An evil doll?

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Full of eyes, covered in eyes

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Covered in eyes

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
So

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
So now argue about that

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
You have this still

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
You got to keep this, it's the winner

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
You're the winner, you won

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
I won, but

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
No, no

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
This is all good

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
You're just still being the same thing

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Yeah, it's like a winner

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
It's like real fighting

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
It's like an entertaining game

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Are we still at the park west?

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Yeah

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Well

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
I feel like

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
My sniper rifle will crush you

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
I feel like

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Because you work in the sniper

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Sniper field

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
That you are somehow

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Accountable

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
To

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Evil

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
I as an agent of evil

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Can probably pull strings

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
From above you

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
He's got an evil doll card

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
No cheating

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Like, aren't you

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
As a sniper, aren't you just a gun for hire?

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Don't you just snipe?

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Essentially, I'm a Zen Wolf

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Yeah, that's what I do

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Done and done

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
I'm also the queen

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
I have an entire nation behind me

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Supporting me as a sniper

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
I'm covered in eyes

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
And each eye is dedicated to

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Evil

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Which

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Traditionally is

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Has intelligence

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
And articulation at its

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Disposal

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Three minute warning

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
I mean, you're a queen

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
You're

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
What do you mean?

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
No secrets

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
It's a goddamn show

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
No cheating

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
He's asking me if he can do stuff

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
I think that means I won, right?

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
I'm an evil doll covered in eyes

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
I'm gonna be a queen

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Sniper rifle

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
I make you hate yourself

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
I make you

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
I see everything

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
That you should hate

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
You fall down the stairs and you die

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Doesn't matter what you are

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
I'm an evil doll covered in eyes

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
I see everything

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
I see your weird thoughts

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
About all kinds of

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Underage people

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
I've seen everything

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
I'm a

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Evil doll with eyes

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
I like that underage gets an O

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
He didn't say sex anywhere

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
No, I'm saying I see

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
I've seen it

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
I've seen it

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
I've seen your evil

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
You can see through the queen

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Let's just put it to a vote

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Evil doll covered in eyes

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Who wins?

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
All right, and a queen with a sniper rifle

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
I don't know

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
I feel like a tie

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
I think that was a tie

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
I gotta say

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
One minute warning

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
All right

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Rap battle about a doll with eyes

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Rap it up, battle!

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Who's the best rapper?

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Who's the best rapper in Chicago?

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
You're the best rapper in Chicago?

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
All right

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
All right

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
We need a beatboxer

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Or we can trade off if you want to trade off

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Yeah, let's just do it

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
You want to start? I'll beatbox for you

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
I'm going to start at a unit

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
However you're comfortable

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Oh, oh, shit

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Oh, oh, oh, shit

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
Oh, yo, yo

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Yo, yo, yo

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
To the mic comes the king of mics

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
My name is Dan Harmon

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Psyche, my name is Daniel

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Last name Harmonious

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
I fucked your mama

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
I was felonious

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
That means I stole her pussy

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
I fucked your mama so hard

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Your daddy came in shushy

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
That's a new adjective

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
That means he was

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Like going shh

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Yeah

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
He was

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
And that your daddy was

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
shh

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
But I fucked your mama and your daddy was

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
shh

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
I fucked your daddy

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Your daddy was

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
