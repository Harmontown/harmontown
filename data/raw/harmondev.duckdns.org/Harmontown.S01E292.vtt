{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:11.000\nFrom the beautiful theater district in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n00:11.000 --> 00:26.000\nOne of my favorite theaters in the United States, the beautiful Wilbur Theater here.\n\n00:26.000 --> 00:33.000\nI'm very, very excited to announce my favorite words of all time.\n\n00:33.000 --> 00:41.000\nHarmontown is now in session.\n\n00:41.000 --> 00:52.000\nSpencer Crittenden!\n\n00:52.000 --> 01:03.000\nOh yeah!\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:12.000\nLet's bring out the mayor of Harmontown. Give it up for Dan Harmon.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:15.000\nThank you!\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:19.000\nThank you, Boston.\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:22.000\nMy goodness.\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:25.000\nWow.\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:28.000\nOh, and they have cabaret style seating. This is wonderful.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:30.000\nWhat a great theater. This is really nice.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:35.000\nI thought we had a one person standing ovation, but that was the cocktail waiter down there.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:37.000\nIt sounds like they're standing up in their hearts.\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:46.000\nThat's one of the warmest receptions we've ever gotten. Thank you, Boston.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:52.000\nThank you, thank you. We haven't been in front of an audience in a while and had to come out here.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:58.000\nThe last three weeks in Los Angeles, we've been farting around and getting our sea legs back.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:10.000\nThis is nice. I'm probably a little nervous because I wrote you guys a song because I wanted to get on your good side.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:16.000\nI have that privilege where I could just not know as a thousand people and they paid.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:20.000\nWhat did you guys pay? Too much.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:24.000\nIt's a working class town. It's always too much, right?\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:29.000\nEverything's too much. I got toilets to make out of porcelain.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:34.000\nI didn't want to have you plunging them, nor is that a bad occupation, sir.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:37.000\nI think this guy makes them.\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:45.000\nTo me, it's all drudgery. I sit in a zeppelin thinking thoughts for money.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:52.000\nTen migrant workers then just type the thoughts for me.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:59.000\nI love all of them more than any Republican.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:05.000\nI would sell you out, America.\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:09.000\nIf you're an unemployed welder who's been replaced by a robot, you're right.\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:14.000\nI'm a coastal elite. I hate you more than the people we're bringing in over the border.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:18.000\nI'd love them because they pick my strawberries. I would trade you for anything.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:24.000\nIt's all about extremes. It's a war between whether or not we're going to just let everyone flood in\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:30.000\nand eat each other alive or whether we have to have a fucking baby Schwitz.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:35.000\nBaby Schwitz? Pointed.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:39.000\nHashtag baby Schwitz.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:44.000\nAnd again, my apologies to people who, through whatever connection or whatever philosophical loyalty\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:55.000\nor actual familial connection, feel offense at the now-every-day maybe glib comparisons to third-rightishness.\n\n03:55.000 --> 04:02.000\nBut I gotta say, look, I've said it before. I'll say it again.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:07.000\nWhen it comes to comparing you to Hitler, I like to jump the gun.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:11.000\nI like to get way up early.\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:17.000\nAnd I just think the worst thing that happens to you is you're a politician that got compared to Hitler too early\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:20.000\nand you should learn to live with that.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:24.000\nAll politicians should be able to survive being compared to Hitler.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:28.000\nIt's not that hard a litmus test.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:32.000\nDid you have a hard day, honey? Yeah, it was hard. What happened?\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:35.000\nSome of the people compared me to Hitler.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:40.000\nDid you act like Hitler in any perceivable way?\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:44.000\nWell, my health care bill's a little draconian.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:52.000\nOkay, but yeah, okay, they'll get over it, go to bed, sleep like a non-Hitler baby.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:56.000\nI'm gonna run that flow chart through today's reality.\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:58.000\nHave a hard day. Yeah, compare me to Hitler.\n\n04:58.000 --> 04:59.000\nWhat did you do?\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:01.000\nMmm, baby schwitz.\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:06.000\nBaby schwitz. It sounds like a delicious beer.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:09.000\nCrack into a cold baby schwitz.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:11.000\nThe press wants to get in.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:13.000\nWell, the real news or the fake news?\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:16.000\nOh, the Lugan press for sure. I mean, the fake news.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:20.000\nYeah, they're trying to get in, but they won't wait the two weeks.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:24.000\nI mean, why do you need two weeks to let people in to see the kids?\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:29.000\nWhat are you doing that takes two weeks to change about your baby schwitz?\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:38.000\nIt's either a room full of babies that deserve to be behind a beautiful, clean, comfortable chain link fence\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:42.000\nthat I'm not at all saying is inhumane, especially for criminals,\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:46.000\nwhich everyone is that tries to get in no matter what.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:51.000\nThere's aboveboard ways to try to get in, and if you don't, you're a criminal.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:54.000\nAnd so if you're a criminal and there's like a baby blanket,\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:58.000\nor a little in a Buck Rogers space blanket, you're fine.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:00.000\nSorry, I don't want to get political tonight.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:08.000\nBut Dan, a lot of these babies are dangerous political dissidents and intellectuals.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:10.000\nWe got to weed out the bad babies.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:16.000\nSo even taking it like there should be a face value thing here.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:19.000\nSo it's like, I understand that you need the babies locked up.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:25.000\nSo now where do we get into this part where I'm like, hey, can I come take a look at them?\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:28.000\nMaybe in two weeks.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:30.000\nWhat?\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:33.000\nThat's cause for alarm.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:40.000\nThat's way more time than my landlord has to wait before he opens my fucking door and comes in\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:43.000\nand looks at my bong and like, right?\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:46.000\nLike when I lived in an apartment, I was like, I could yell at the landlord\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:51.000\nif he like tried to get in, and I was like, you need to wait 30 hours.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:53.000\nIt's the law.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:55.000\nOh, it's fine, but you haven't paid your rent in six months.\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:58.000\nYes, so what? I got rights.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:02.000\nYou need to wait 30 hours.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:04.000\nAll right, anyways, here's my stuff.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:07.000\nThat was Dan's Boston song, everybody.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:13.000\nAnd hey, these are turbulent times.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:17.000\nAnd if you're having passionate feelings, and I don't even care if you're wrong.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:21.000\nLike if you're passionate feelings are wrong, like, look, I know I live in a bubble.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:22.000\nI'm coming out from LA.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:23.000\nYou people are my hosts.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.000\nYou're being gracious to me rolling out a red carpet.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:26.000\nYou're feeding me your food.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:28.000\nYou're putting me up in your hotel.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:30.000\nI mean, not, yeah, you are.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:33.000\nI'm sure your tax is paid for that hotel.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:37.000\nI mean, I am a guest here, so I just want to thank you.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:40.000\nI did not intend to go off about this thing that everyone's talking about.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:42.000\nAnd if you are, there's a thousand people here.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:45.000\nSo there's probably, there are a couple of you that have like feelings\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:48.000\nthat I'm rubbing up against with my liberal claptrap.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:54.000\nAnd I want to thank, thank you for, thank you for, thank you for zipping it.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:56.000\nIt's what I was going to say, let me finish.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:59.000\nI was about to thank you for, shut the fuck up.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:02.000\nBut no, I really appreciate that.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:04.000\nI don't, because I don't want to start a fucking show with me.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nOh, and then someone's like,\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:11.000\nBecause we're just going to do what we've been doing on Twitter for six months.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:12.000\nYeah.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:15.000\nI want to reward your patience and your silence and your,\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:17.000\nwell, hopefully not your total silence,\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nbut maybe your intermittent applause.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:20.000\nYou know what I could go for right now, Dan?\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:21.000\nA song?\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:26.000\nYeah, well, a song and the smooth taste of a nice cold baby Swiss.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:32.000\nThe low carb beer with a nipple on it.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:33.000\nYes.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:36.000\nTry new baby schlitz lime.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:39.000\nTuck into the room, temperature, titty.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:45.000\nThat rewards you like a good mama after a hard day in the rock yard.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:47.000\nBaby Swiss.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:54.000\nYeah.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:57.000\nLet's hear this song for God's sake.\n\n08:57.000 --> 08:58.000\nI have not heard this song.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nI didn't know that you composed a little, a little.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:01.000\nYeah.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:02.000\nAnd I got to do it acapella.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:03.000\nIf I had time, I would have,\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:05.000\nI would have like gotten out garage behind or something.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:06.000\nIt would have been a disaster.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:07.000\nSo it's acapella.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:08.000\nI don't know.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:12.000\nAnd I'm not really a singer or a musician, but you, you, you, you paid.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:20.000\nAnd I don't do a lot of research about the cities I go to.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nI know the typewriter was invented here.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:38.000\nBoston, Massachusetts, you sits on the Boston Bay.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:46.000\nAnd the tea you tossed into it made the British go away.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:49.000\nYour buildings and your streets are famous.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:53.000\nSo is all your food.\n\n09:53.000 --> 10:00.000\nBut here's what I've learned while walking from the lobby to my room.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:07.000\nYou might be alcoholics, Boston.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:13.000\nAnd I don't throw that word around.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:16.000\nYou maybe have a problem, Boston.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:26.000\nAnd that makes you my kind of town.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:33.000\nBoston, Massachusetts, you sits on the Boston Mall.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:37.000\nAnd you may, hey, hey, hey,\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:42.000\nBe the cutest of them all.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:55.000\nSo now you're on my side for, I got you for an hour and a half.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:59.000\nI could do whatever now, I could fart on a fucking shoe.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:03.000\nI spent a lot of, just spent most of the afternoon today.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:06.000\nI spent most of my afternoon today just hanging out by the Boston Bay.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:08.000\nIt was so nice out of there.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:10.000\nYou're going to drop by that mall too.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:11.000\nThe mall.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:13.000\nThe famous mall of Boston.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nThey got Sephora, they got the baby gap.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:17.000\nThe birthplace of Quincy Jones.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:20.000\nQuincy Jones.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:28.000\nWhen he was working on Thriller with Button Gwyneth.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:30.000\nI was having some pizza up at what do you call it, the North End?\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:32.000\nThe North End, yeah.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:40.000\nAnd I was just typing in, I was there not that long ago and my girlfriend and I, we went and saw all the kind of the big touristy historical spots.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:44.000\nAnd I just typed in, let's see what I'm around historically.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:48.000\nAnd number three on Yelp, Skinny House.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:51.000\nFamous for being a skinny house, that's it.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:53.000\nOh, it's not, it's not.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:57.000\nNo, the Paul Revere statue was number five.\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nWell, it's been there forever.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nWhat has it done for anyone lately?\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:07.000\nIt's the Paul Revere statue, like spit out burgers, you know, if you, it's there to keep the red coats away.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:09.000\nIt's doing its job.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:15.000\nYeah, we take it for granted a little bit, but it's kind of a gargoyle, you know, you take a picture, you move on.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:18.000\nSkinny House, that sounds like important.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:21.000\nI thought it was a vegan restaurant.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nSkinny House.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:25.000\nIt should be.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:29.000\nThe only restaurant where you leave thinner than you came in.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:32.000\nThat would be Beverly Hills.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:34.000\nYou can't even get out.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:37.000\nYeah, if we've done our job, you won't be able to leave.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:42.000\nWe're going to feed you so well that you're a fire hazard.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:44.000\nBut seriously, there is it now.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:46.000\nObviously, my view is skewed.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:51.000\nWhen I, my first few times I was in New York, I was working as a writer and all I saw was Times Square.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:55.000\nI was staying at a hotel and I'm like telling everybody, yeah, New York's like this and it's like that.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:59.000\nThere's hot dogs all over the place and vomit.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nOh, no, I don't like New York.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:11.000\nAnd then my friend took me and like, he's like, no, there's like, you know, you got to go below 105th and whatever the fuck people talk about there.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:24.000\nSo my view of Boston is limited to a hotel lobby, but I will say, I think, I think it's safe to say there is a broader definition of when you're supposed to call the police.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:35.000\nLike, on a man, that is like, our show is being interrupted.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:54.000\nUh, it's Schrab is crawling onto the stage wearing an outfit or costume. It's hard to explain.\n\n13:54.000 --> 14:09.000\nIt's hard to explain.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:28.000\nIt's hard to explain.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:35.000\nThank you. Thank you.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:39.000\nI bet she thought I was a dog.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:42.000\nI thought you were a seal. I thought you were doing like a little seal bit.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:47.000\nThe sea dog of the ocean.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:51.000\nThe first rule of theater always make an entrance.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:56.000\nOr be wait to be brought out.\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:59.000\nHe doesn't like being, he doesn't like waiting to be brought out.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:01.000\nNo, he doesn't like, he's not a patient man.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:06.000\nSo before we started the show, Rob was like brainstorming stage work and stuff.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:11.000\nLike I saw him pulling various props off the wall and he was like trying to use chairs as stilts.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:14.000\nIt was really watching a master honing his craft.\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:19.000\nAnd to see that that resulted in the result it did, it was truly just wonderful for me.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nThis, this is only, this is only the first part of it.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:24.000\nYeah. This is act one.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:33.000\nHe's got, Rob has, Rob promises more costume changes tonight than Dolly Parton.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:37.000\nOh look, they stooled with no back.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:42.000\nYou get so sad then.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:43.000\nWhere's he going?\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:48.000\nStrob, everybody.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:52.000\nOur next guest.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:58.000\nAnyways, there's, I mean, I'm just saying in the, in the, in the day that I've been in my hotel,\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:06.000\nI have seen a lot of grown men.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:12.000\nHe's going to hurt himself.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:16.000\nSteve, come help.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:17.000\nDan, just continue.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:18.000\nHe's going.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:20.000\nKeep going.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:23.000\nHe's stilting on chairs.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:24.000\nKeep going.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:25.000\nDo your thing.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:36.000\nDo your part and I'll do my part, he says.\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:38.000\nGet even with us.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:39.000\nFifty-fifty.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:40.000\nDon't upstages.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:41.000\nYeah.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:42.000\nYeah.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:43.000\nRob.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:46.000\nDon't upstages.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:47.000\nYou've been great.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:52.000\nHere's, here's my impression of Schrab on an airplane.\n\n16:52.000 --> 17:02.000\nYou know, they say if you get on the airplane's Wi-Fi, that's how you get hacked.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:07.000\nAnd then here's Rob at the hotel this morning in the, in the lobby.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:17.000\nYou know, if you get on the hotel's Wi-Fi, isn't that how I get your credit card?\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:18.000\nYeah.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:22.000\nAnd I, and I'm like, yeah, Schrab, have you heard that they're cutting people's ankles\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:25.000\nand the, and the grocery store parking lot?\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:31.000\nI'll forward you an email about it because I'm 70.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:35.000\nSee, he's a very prudent, cautious man in real life.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:39.000\nHe doesn't like to.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:43.000\nI'm prudent, unconscious.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:47.000\nI got, I, that was just me hitting the thing by accident.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nOh.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:53.000\nIt's very sensitive.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:55.000\nI feel like I'm rolling with a lot of punches.\n\n17:55.000 --> 18:01.000\nYou're doing great.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:08.000\nOkay, well, don't, don't, unlike other people, I don't need that.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:10.000\nI don't thrive on that.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:12.000\nI will earn that.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:19.000\nLike, you don't think I was, would be doing that in my living room by myself.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:23.000\nCrawling around with a wookie jacket.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:25.000\nIt flew you out here, man.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nI know.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:34.000\nIt was a recent show, but it was like, he found out he was coach and he, he almost had a meltdown.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:36.000\nThat's not true.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:39.000\nHad to bump him up to first class during the show.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:43.000\nWhen's the last time, toilet maker, when's the last time you flew first class?\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:45.000\nYeah, never.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:49.000\nYour boss maybe did on his way to a ceramic seminar.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:53.000\nBecause he said, to figure out how to gouge your labor.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:57.000\nOkay, with these sitting in the back of the plane while you're up there with your...\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:59.000\nNo, I wouldn't feel okay.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:03.000\nBecause I have empathy and I treat people with respect.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:06.000\nAnd I don't, I don't trump all over their shows.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:07.000\nYes.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:08.000\nYou know.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:09.000\nThank you.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:10.000\nThat's very, very nice of you.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:12.000\nI open my doors to my friends.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:13.000\nThank you.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:16.000\nAnd then, and then I respect and support them.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:17.000\nCool.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:18.000\nAnd then I...\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:26.000\nSo anyways, my, I was just, all I was going to say is that there's a lot of drunk people\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:27.000\nhere.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:28.000\nI, I...\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:32.000\nIt's a, it's a weird thing.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:33.000\nIt's weird.\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:34.000\nIt's not the amount.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:35.000\nIt's the age.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:38.000\nIt's the fact that it's like a all ages affair.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:42.000\nLike guys that just look like, like a friend of my dad's.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:45.000\nLike, just swaying.\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:48.000\nI'm like, like, like people...\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:49.000\nYeah, we were out last night.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:50.000\nWe got into town late.\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:53.000\nDan and I went for a quick, like, like, you know, like, like nightcap.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:54.000\nAnd there was a guy.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:57.000\nOh, let's, let's put him at 57 years old.\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:58.000\n54?\n\n19:58.000 --> 19:59.000\nMaybe...\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:00.000\nHe looked like a prop master.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:01.000\nIs that a reference to...\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:02.000\nNo.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:03.000\nYou guys aren't TV show runners.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:04.000\nHe looked like a prop master.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:05.000\nYeah.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:06.000\nYeah.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:09.000\nHe looked like a, like a, like a vice principal of something.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:10.000\nAnd, uh...\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:11.000\nI put him more below the line.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:12.000\nYeah.\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:18.000\nBut he, he came out of the bathroom and he was, like, completely, like, using all the\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:20.000\nsurfaces to not fall down.\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:21.000\nLike...\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:22.000\nLike a xenomorph.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:27.000\nBut he had this, he had this incredible, like, if I, if I was that drunk, I'd go,\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:31.000\noh fuck, I gotta make it all the way out, out there through a very narrow corridor of\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:34.000\nbar stools and people moving and people serving drinks.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:38.000\nI would, I would get on my knees and say, take me to jail.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:41.000\nBut this is not good, this is not good podcasting.\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:44.000\nThis is the, he was so excited about it.\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:47.000\nThis is what separates Boston from Drunks that I see in Los Angeles.\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:50.000\nThis is the look on the guy's face as he was barely making it.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:52.000\nHe was going...\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:53.000\nYeah.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:54.000\nVery happy about it.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:57.000\nIt's a, it's a friendly town.\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:59.000\nI think, I think that's the key.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:03.000\nCause I was gonna say, in New York in LA, like, I've been, in both, in New York in LA, I've\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:10.000\nbeen with drunk people all the way up to Andy Dick levels of, of, of actual Andy Dick.\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:14.000\nAnd like, there's that, but even if you're not Andy Dick and you're famous and you have\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:18.000\nthis like, like tag in your heads, like, like New York bouncers will be like, they'll,\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:22.000\nit's very impressive the way that they'll, like, even a guy who's like a functional\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:26.000\nalcoholic, but you can, he's in that dark pocket of the night.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:30.000\nLike, and he's just like, he's, he's pulling it off with his friends, but the\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nbouncer will be like, nope.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:38.000\nLike, he's like, and I was like, I have a bartender go, go like, uh-uh, not you.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:40.000\nYou, you won't look me in the eye.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:46.000\nLike it's very empathic and like, like, sentimental kind of like, like, like hierarchy there.\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:50.000\nIt's like, like, like, like, but, but, but I do think that, I mean, here there's like a\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:53.000\nsupport of the, which I guess reminds me of Milwaukee.\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:57.000\nIt's like, it's like, like, like that guy, that guy had a smile on his face cause he\n\n21:57.000 --> 22:02.000\nwasn't ashamed of what was happening to him because, because the bartender was probably\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:06.000\nafter we left was probably like, Kevin, you want another one?\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:13.000\nYou know, she probably put out a rope ladder for him to get to the bar and he, and, and,\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:15.000\nand, and he said, am I on a helicopter?\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:18.000\nShe probably said, you can be Kevin, you can be.\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:23.000\nIf you just dream had enough.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:25.000\nYou were waiting for me to.\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:26.000\nOh shit.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:27.000\nYou were waiting for me to do the.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:28.000\nIt's gonna be that easy.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:30.000\nThe master of accents.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:33.000\nYou've heard my Australian tour.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:36.000\nI am a man of a thousand dialects.\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:37.000\nWhat's, what do you?\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:39.000\nThey're liking that hat mate.\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:41.000\nThey're liking that happen.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:46.000\nSay that you like the hat, that hat mate, but in a, in a full hardcore Southie Boston.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:47.000\nYou like that hat.\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:48.000\nYeah.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:49.000\nI don't know.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:50.000\nI don't know.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:51.000\nI don't know.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:52.000\nI just know that ours go away.\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:53.000\nI don't know anything.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:57.000\nBut I do know my friend Dave Horowitz, I think he lived here for a while and he said at this\n\n22:57.000 --> 23:01.000\nvery theater, there was a blue man group show and there was a commercial for it on TV in\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:03.000\nthe nineties that he told me about.\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:04.000\nHe's like, oh, you're going to Boston.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:07.000\nYou know, every time I think of Boston, I think of this hilarious commercial for the\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:10.000\nblue man group at the Wilbur theater in the nineties.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:12.000\nAnd it was a, you know, blue man group.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:15.000\nAnd there was one of those things where they do the theatrical testimonials like the audience\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:20.000\npeople are like, like the every man Joe is like, like, like come see the show.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:21.000\nAnd it was great.\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:24.000\nAnd I'm trying to find the quote.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:26.000\nHe told me, uh, fuck God.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:27.000\nDammit.\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:28.000\nHarmon.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:29.000\nOther people in the sky.\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:32.000\nThere's two balconies.\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:33.000\nRob.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:34.000\nRob.\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:35.000\nRob.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:37.000\nThat's called a balcony.\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:38.000\nOh, okay.\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:39.000\nSorry.\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:43.000\nSo it's just, it is, he's, there's just this guy with like a baseball hat on and he, any,\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:45.000\nuh, okay, we're all going to die.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:49.000\nUh, the, the, the, it's for blue man group.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:51.000\nThey're like, blue man group, come see the show.\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:52.000\nThey're critics are raving.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:54.000\nOh, the blue man groups at the Wilbur theater.\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:58.000\nAnd then there's just this guy in the lobby of the Wilbur doing one of those testimonials\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:00.000\nand he goes like, he goes, hell of a ride.\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:02.000\nPack your bags.\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:11.000\nIt was like Greg, Greg groups is all joking.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:12.000\nHe goes, all the thing in Boston.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:13.000\nLike I, you try to flirt.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:17.000\nEvery girl you talk to is like flirting with Cliff Clavin.\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:18.000\nYeah.\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:21.000\nI mean, I got pulled over in Delaware once by a cop.\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:26.000\nAnd I could, it was my first time talking to anyone from that region at all.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:28.000\nAnd I was, so I was going through this horrible experience.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:31.000\nCause I was like, I felt like the other man's coming down on me.\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:33.000\nAnd it's like, but also he's like, it sounds like a cartoon.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:35.000\nHe was like, you don't have an insurance card.\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:37.000\nAnd I was like, come on, this is silly.\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:40.000\nLike you, you can't have a gun.\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:43.000\nYou sound like a, you sound like a TV show.\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:47.000\nBut then people where I'm from, if you tell them how I talk where we come from,\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:48.000\npeople go like, no, that's Fargo.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:49.000\nThat's not real.\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:50.000\nI'm like, that is real.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:52.000\nWe talk like that in Milwaukee.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:58.000\nI have just dropped to that accent in support of a professional career.\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:02.000\nI no longer speak like a Philistine.\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:06.000\nI talk like Tom Brokaw all the time.\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:10.000\nI have no nasal twang.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:12.000\nI lost the song.\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:15.000\nLuster, you guys are losing faith in me.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:16.000\nNo, we're not Dan.\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:17.000\nWe love you.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:18.000\nOkay.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:19.000\nOkay.\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:20.000\nHere's the thing.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:25.000\nI'm like, what are you, Tony Danza?\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:28.000\nWhat are you doing?\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:29.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:30.000\nYou want me to be uncomfortable?\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:31.000\nOkay.\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:32.000\nI don't know.\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:33.000\nWould you rather I'd be uncomfortable?\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:40.000\nBecause it's your show.\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:42.000\nSchrab pointed at the Harmontown.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:44.000\nBasically it's a table.\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:48.000\nSchrab, what was the, we took a long, a car ride from...\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:49.000\nOkay.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:50.000\nThis is something.\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:51.000\nI don't know.\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:58.000\nThe whole ride from Dan's place to LAX takes about, let's call it 40 minutes.\n\n25:58.000 --> 25:59.000\nIt was like an hour.\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:02.000\n40 minutes to an hour.\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:03.000\nThat's fair.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:04.000\nThat's very fair.\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:07.000\nAnd I had something to get off my chest.\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:11.000\nDo you guys have movie posters here?\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:18.000\nLike, not just movie posters, like coming this summer, but like, like, like, like bus\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:22.000\nstop signs that have movie posters and stuff like that.\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:23.000\nOkay.\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:24.000\nOkay.\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:27.000\nSo you know what a movie poster is, then?\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:31.000\nNow we can get, now we can start my thing.\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:32.000\nOkay.\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:36.280\nI don't know if you guys heard about this, but a couple of months ago, and I think it's\n\n26:36.280 --> 26:44.000\nstill in theaters, there was this movie called Peter Rabbit, and it's about a, yeah.\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:52.400\nAnd it's about a, it's a movie with a bunch of computer-generated rabbits in it, one\n\n26:52.400 --> 26:54.000\nof them named Peuner.\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:58.000\nI know it's about time.\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:02.800\nNow I haven't seen this movie, I'm sure it's fine, and I'm sure the people worked really\n\n27:02.800 --> 27:06.000\nhard on it.\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:12.000\nBut the advertisers, there's a poster that says, and I go through this every time one\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:18.000\nof these movies comes out, it says, there's a picture of Peter Rabbit, no pants, shirt,\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:26.000\ngoing like this, in front of a blue void, and then it says, in big blocky letters, better\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:29.000\neight than never.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:33.000\nA-T-E, better eight than never.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:34.000\nRight.\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:38.000\nWhat the fuck does that mean?\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:42.000\nWhat the fuck does that mean?\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:48.000\nIs this, is this a sequel to a movie that he ate something in?\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:54.000\nIs this, is this something that we've been waiting for, the Peter Rabbit movie?\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:57.000\nThey're like, Paddington 2, where's Peter Rabbit?\n\n27:57.000 --> 28:00.000\nGod damn it, better eight than never.\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:03.000\nGood, wait a minute, why eight?\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:08.000\nWell, because he'd also have to be like Peter Stumick or something, you know, like Peter,\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:11.000\nPeter Eater, you know, like better, better eight than never.\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:16.000\nBut he's got no pants on and he's jumping like this, his stomach is flat, his washboard,\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:20.000\nI, and, is he holding a carrot level?\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:27.000\nNo, no, not no carrot, no stump carrots, no, nothing, not a pile of carrots, not a full,\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:30.000\nno, no, better eight than never.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:36.000\nThis happens all the time, remember the fucking Peabody movie, the dog movie?\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:37.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:41.000\nSherman and Peabody movie, the tagline for that was, anybody?\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nCome on, you know this.\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:46.000\nThe dog, the dog father of all comedies.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:47.000\nRight.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:56.000\nSherman and Peabody, it's about a talking dog who gets a pet boy who travels in time,\n\n28:56.000 --> 29:07.000\nnot to mob times, dinosaurs, Abe Lincoln, Napoleon, not to mob times, mob times,\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:10.000\nand it's the dog father of all comedies.\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:15.000\nYou know that thing when we go, well, you know, it's the mother of all comedies,\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:19.000\nand then it's the, you know, the sisterhood of all comedies,\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:22.000\nbut the dog father of all comedies, the godfather of all comedies.\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:26.000\nAnd we all know that there's the father of all comedies, that's a very common thing to say.\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:33.000\nBut I guess, I guess dog and god rhyme, no, they don't.\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:39.000\nThe dog father of all comedies, better eight than never.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:42.000\nLook for it, it'll piss you off.\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:49.000\nYou'll be driving down the street and you'll go, rabbit, ate, I guess all animals eat,\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:54.000\nand this one must have ate something and he's happy about it\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:57.000\nand I should go see this movie because of why.\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:59.000\nBecause it's better than never.\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:06.000\nNever can come and soon enough.\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:09.000\nBecause that's when I'm going to see your movie.\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:11.000\nJesus, come on.\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:22.000\nBetter eight than never. Get the fuck out of here with that.\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:25.000\nGet the fuck out of here with that.\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:27.000\nI got to pick the kids up.\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:30.000\nIt's going to be, I mean, like the 405 is a parking lot.\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:32.000\nWhy don't we just, better eight than never.\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:34.000\nOkay, send it. Put it out.\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:36.000\nI got to get home.\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:42.000\nI got to get home. The fucking water jug guy is delivering today.\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:44.000\nIf I don't open the door.\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:47.000\nSir, you're the head of a studio. We need you to sign on.\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:49.000\nNobody's watching. Nobody cares.\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:52.000\nThey're just driving by. They see rabbit.\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:54.000\nThey see a bunch of words.\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:55.000\nMaybe I'll see it.\n\n30:55.000 --> 31:00.000\nAll of those posters should just say custody weekend is coming.\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:04.000\nThey should just say, drop your kids off.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:07.000\nThey'll be relatively safe for two hours.\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:08.000\nProbably not.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:15.000\nWhen did, when did, when was rhyming such an important part of movie taglines?\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:18.000\nI mean, long, long ago in a galaxy far, far away.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:19.000\nDoesn't rhyme with anything.\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:23.000\nYou know, 26 million years in the making.\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:24.000\nYou will believe a man can fly.\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:25.000\nRight, right.\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:26.000\nSuperman.\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:27.000\nIn space, no one can hear you scream.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:28.000\nNo rhyming involved.\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:35.000\nEverything is like, better up than pop.\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:36.000\nYeah, you're right.\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:38.000\nYou're right.\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:41.000\nLevy, Levy, what was the yogi bear one?\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:42.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:44.000\nDo you remember the yogi bear?\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:51.000\nGreat things come in bears.\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:53.000\nThat's a, that's a very Boston.\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:54.000\nWhich?\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:56.000\nI can see why that, that captures your heart.\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:59.000\nIt feels like a very, very high, like them apples.\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:01.000\nBut that sounds like, well, first of all.\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:04.000\nThat sounds like a gay porn tagline.\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:06.000\nThat's why they like it.\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:08.000\nThey're like, yeah, great things come in bears.\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:09.000\nYeah.\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:10.000\nHey, come on.\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:11.000\nThis is retarded.\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:12.000\nThis is from Boston.\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:13.000\nThis is from Mark Wahlberg.\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:14.000\nRetarded, man.\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:16.000\nThis is retarded.\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:19.000\nI'm coming in your bag.\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nWicked piss ass.\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.000\nFucking your bag.\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:26.000\nHe's fucking a chair.\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:32.000\nGreat things come in bears.\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:35.000\nI hope it's another bear.\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:37.000\nI hope it's a great bear.\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:38.000\nI think it's Mark Wahlberg.\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:42.000\nI think he's, that's, that's why he talks to animals so much.\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:44.000\nHe's, he's grooming them.\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:47.000\nThat's why he bought a zoo.\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:49.000\nDid he, did he buy a zoo?\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:50.000\nThat's why he bought it.\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:51.000\nThat's Matt Damon.\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:55.000\nI don't get those guys mixed up.\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:59.000\nYeah, I'm going to accept that groan.\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:01.000\nI might have gone over the line.\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:07.000\nI might have accidentally asked you to trivialize pedophilia in your mind.\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:10.000\nThat's good to find your boundaries, Boston.\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:13.000\nCertainly didn't find them in the elevator.\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:17.000\nLike guys that look like they should be a senator just fucking swaying\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:20.000\nand breathing out of their ears.\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:22.000\nThey're drunk and they're like, like,\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:25.000\nclapping their hands randomly.\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:28.000\nI mean, they're probably from out of town, but you're, you're...\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:29.000\nI got an elevator.\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:31.000\nYou laid out that carpet for them.\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:36.000\nWe're staying at a nice hotel and we, I stupidly chose to stay way up top.\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:40.000\nLike I'm on the top floor, but it's a big convention in town.\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:41.000\nIt's like a big car thing.\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:43.000\nSo it's a lot of like fast and furious looking dudes.\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:47.000\nLike a lot of big, a lot of giant, like very tanned biceps\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:49.000\nand a lot of big fake titties.\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:52.000\nAnd so I get to stop at every stop on the way down.\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:53.000\nAnd it's just a lot of cologne.\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:56.000\nIt's a potpourri of muscles and perfumes.\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:59.000\nAnd everybody's lovely and nice and like, no one was a jerk at everything.\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:02.000\nBut just one guy gets in and he's just, you know, he's like probably my age,\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:06.000\nbut because of all the tanning, he looks a little older and he's really big and buff.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:09.000\nAnd he stands, he does the thing where he doesn't turn around and face the door.\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:11.000\nHe just, because we're rammed in there.\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:12.000\nSo he's got us back to the door.\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:15.000\nHe's like, everyone knows no one talks in elevators?\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:16.000\nOh boy.\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:19.000\nAnybody got me coke? I'm the guy.\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:22.000\nOh, there's a kid. Hey kid, you like to do coconut?\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:24.000\nI don't like that guy. I don't like that guy.\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:29.000\nThe guy that gets on the bus or the tram or the, you know,\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:31.000\nand it's just like, what is this? The fossil flyer?\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:33.000\nCome on. Put a smile on your face.\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:36.000\nLike, wait, come on, we're not, we're not sitting here in silence\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:41.000\nbecause we lack the fucking aptitude to be jocular.\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:44.000\nWe're just, we're in mass transit.\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:46.000\nWe're having a bad day. We're minding our own business.\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:51.000\nLike, you know, people eat people on these things.\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:54.000\nWe want, we're prepared for that. How's that sound?\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nWe weren't prepared for your open mic.\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:59.000\nAnd then the door opened and there wasn't really room for three people,\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:02.000\nbut three people were waiting to get on like halfway down.\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:07.000\nAnd he goes, he goes, I can't do the accent because you're cute.\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:09.000\nYou get on and we'll kick some of the ugly guys off.\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:13.000\nEvery floor had a new routine. It was, it was, it was disappointing.\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:16.000\nIt was anybody like going, well, they have to.\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:19.000\nThat's the thing is that people nervous laugh\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:21.000\nand then they take the nervous laugh and they don't,\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:23.000\nthey don't, something in their brain doesn't tell nervous laughter\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:26.000\nfrom fucking real laughter. They're like, I'm killing over here.\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:29.000\nOh, I'm not, like, we got them in LA.\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:32.000\nWe got them in Burbank. We got them in, we got them in Detroit.\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:35.000\nWe got them in Detroit.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:37.000\nMe and Logan.\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:40.000\nLiving in America.\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:43.000\nWhat is the Huey Lewis song?\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:46.000\nWell, is Boston mentioned in the Huey Lewis song, the Hard Rock and Roll?\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:47.000\nHard Rock and Roll.\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:49.000\nOr is it, or is it, because when I was, when I was,\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:50.000\nI think it is.\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:52.000\nMy local radio station sent a version of that song\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:57.000\nand then he would like, I think Huey Lewis like said all 70,000 American cities\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nand then they would put it in.\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:02.000\nSo it was like during the like the extended dance mix.\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:06.000\nYou guys are too young to be, have been alive at a time when there was radio,\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:09.000\nlet alone when radio was so unaccountable.\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:12.000\nHuey Lewis 10-minute mixes were being played.\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:16.000\nHuey Lewis at one point roamed the earth as a god.\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:18.000\nAnd there was just not enough Huey Lewis to still,\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:21.000\nthey would stretch what they had out into power mixes\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:25.000\nwhile you were driving to work at your sundial plant\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:30.000\nand to prepare your Brancho Burgers.\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:34.000\nAnd so, and then they would just have random snippets of Huey Lewis going,\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:36.000\nMilwaukee!\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:39.000\nBecause you lived in Milwaukee and I'm assuming that he, that he, somewhere else,\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:40.000\nhe's like...\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:41.000\nHe probably wouldn't hear it.\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:42.000\nMedford!\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:43.000\nLapute!\n\n36:43.000 -->

kudos.\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:52.000\nYou guys, come on.\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:54.000\nYou're vending machines.\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:01.000\nIs the pay range thing catching on?\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:02.000\nPay range?\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:03.000\nHave you heard of this?\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:04.000\nShe's, she's...\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:05.000\nOne person.\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:06.000\nThat's awesome.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:07.000\nI'm gonna fucking weep.\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:10.000\nI was so sad last night because I'm in a hotel.\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:14.000\nThe food, the room service is in the past 11, which I don't understand.\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:16.000\nLike, if I'm, if I'm in a, why would you,\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:21.000\nwhy would you stop having people make food for people in a hotel after 11\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:25.000\nwhen, if I wanted food before 11, I wouldn't eat at a hotel.\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:27.000\nI don't know, that doesn't make any sense.\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:30.000\nLike, why are you, what do you think room service is for?\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:32.000\nI'm drunk, I'm dangerous.\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:39.000\nLike, like, quell me or face the fucking urban legends that will befall you.\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:43.000\nI, I, I, I have a sea of accountants and lawyers.\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:47.000\nI can do anything I want to this weird hipster colonial art.\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:52.000\nUm, I could, I could just fold this up and put it in my duffel bag.\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:53.000\nI like Paul Revere.\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:55.000\nI'm gonna play it.\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:58.000\nI've, I've done, I've broken shit lately.\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:00.000\nI'm entering a dark chapter of my life.\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:06.000\nI, I, I've just unscrewed weird urban art fixtures and just like dropped them and\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:10.000\nI've, I've gotten very good at putting, at putting together like Legos,\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:13.000\nthe remote control because the remote controls never work at some point.\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:16.000\nI just throw it out the wall and they go, I'm gonna put that back together now.\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:18.000\nYeah, it usually works.\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:21.000\nYou know people take, sorry, you know people take remote controls traveling\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:25.000\nbecause it's more, it's easier for them than like using the fucking hotel remotes.\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:27.000\nOh yeah, like really, that's brilliant.\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:29.000\nThat's like next level.\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:30.000\nThat's fucked up.\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:31.000\nI love you too.\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:32.000\nThat's nice.\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:33.000\nAnyways.\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:34.000\nThank you

38:40.000\nThat's the key.\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:41.000\nBut so I was very sad.\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:42.000\nThere's other problems.\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:44.000\nI got back to the hotel at like 11, 10 or something.\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:45.000\nThere's no room service.\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:46.000\nThere's nothing you can do.\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:47.000\nThere's nothing.\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:48.000\nSo I got, oh god.\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:49.000\nAre there vending machines?\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:50.000\nI don't know.\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:51.000\nI call the front desk guest services.\n\n38:51.000 -->

royal treatment.\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:10.000\nIt's just like we're drunk.\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:11.000\nWe're hungry.\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:13.000\nSo, but, but anyways, I didn't.\n\n39:13.000 -->

one?\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:49.000\nOh, the corner can't be folded.\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:50.000\nThe corner has to be folded.\n\n39:50.000 --> 39:52.000\nThe, the, the White House should be showing.\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:55.000\nThat's not the White House.\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:57.000\nIt's the Lincoln place.\n\n39:57.000 --> 39:59.000\nI know my shit.\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:00.000\nIt's the Lincoln Bay.\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:06.000\nI don't come to Boston Harbor without the Boston mall without, without, anyways.\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:09.000\nSo, so I go up to the thing and I'm like, oh, here we go again.\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:11.000\nThere's a little sticker on the thing with a little QR code.\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:14.000\nIt says, hey, get the app.\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:16.000\nI fucking pull out my phone.\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:17.000\nWhat?\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:18.000\nI point the camera at the QR code.\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:24.000\nA little link comes down and goes, you want to go and get this app?\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:29.000\nI go to the app store because there's the app they were talking about.\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:34.000\nApp goes, what's up?\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:36.000\nYou want to download me?\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:38.000\nAnd they're like, look, we don't want anything from you.\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:39.000\nThey're like, thanks for signing up.\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:40.000\nGive us your email.\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:42.000\nWe're going to shoot you an email.\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:44.000\nYou confirm you want to join our club, whatever.\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:46.000\nYou can give us a fake email if you want.\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:47.000\nDon't give us a fake email.\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:48.000\nHere's $2.\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:50.000\n$2 in the vending machine.\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:53.000\nI got a free bag of fucking popcorn.\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:55.000\n$1.25.\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:57.000\nI ran to my room.\n\n40:57.000 --> 40:58.000\nI looked around.\n\n40:58.000 --> 40:59.000\nI went back to my room.\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:04.000\nI'm eating a free bag of popcorn from a vending machine because I downloaded an app.\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:06.000\nHomeless people don't have a chance.\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:12.000\nThey're never going to catch up to our Logan's Run Society.\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:15.000\nThere's people out on the street going, can I please have a quarter?\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:19.000\nWe're like, quarters don't exist.\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:25.000\nPopcorn is now exchanged on a currency of ideals.\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:28.000\nThank you for your interest in our institution.\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:29.000\nHere's your popcorn.\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:31.000\nI didn't even do anything.\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:34.000\nI didn't make a toilet for that money, even indirectly.\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:38.000\nEven the toilet making that I do in Hollywood called Monster House.\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:41.000\nNone of that went into this thing.\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:42.000\nI did nothing.\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:44.000\nI was just a dude with a phone.\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:47.000\nSo I got popcorn for being a dude with a phone.\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:50.000\nI went back and then I'm like, these people need all my money.\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:54.000\nWhatever they're working on that needs to spread and it needs to be how all of society works.\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:59.000\nSo I did go through the maybe 40 to 80 minute process of getting my credit card in there.\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:04.000\nBut it's an app for vending machines.\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:07.000\nIt makes you like the Tarzan of vending machines.\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:11.000\nWhen you're near a vending machine that has this thing in it,\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:16.000\nthe vending machines, if you turn on your notifications, it's consensual.\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:18.000\nYou can choose to not do it.\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:27.000\nThe vending machines will vibrate your pocket and go, I know you like Twizzlers.\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:29.000\nYou've bought a lot of them.\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:32.000\nWe're trying to get rid of some over here.\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:36.000\nWe being a box of food that normally you can only,\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:40.000\nthat you love and you look inside and you see all these fun things behind these robot arms\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:44.000\nand you're like, but the filthy dollar thing that turns you off.\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:50.000\nI don't want to engage in this gross fucking capitalist sex thing\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:55.000\nwith this herpy fucking handshake that you do with these robots.\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:59.000\nGive me your dirty fucking hepatitis money and I'll give you some back\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:04.000\nin a fucking bubblegum laden pit and you fucking bite it.\n\n43:04.000 --> 43:08.000\nEverything's filthy and disgusting and nothing works.\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:10.000\nThey've eliminated it.\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:15.000\nIt goes, hey, you like Diet Coke, two for one, bro, get over here.\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:17.000\nYou say, you're like, I gotta go.\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:19.000\nWhere are you going?\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:21.000\nSomething.\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:24.000\nAnd you go to the thing and you don't do anything.\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:27.000\nIt's like, here you are $25 on your credit.\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:28.000\nIt's like lights up.\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:32.000\nIf you've never seen that little LED thing on a vending machine,\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:37.000\nsay credit $25.\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nIt's like you won life.\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:42.000\nAnd then you're just like fucking salted nut rolls.\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:44.000\nBoom.\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:46.000\nPeanut butter crackers.\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:48.000\nI give a fuck now.\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:50.000\nI don't usually get those.\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:54.000\nI mean, they look gross and dry and orange, but why

lore?\n\n50:33.000 --> 50:35.000\nOh, awesome.\n\n50:35.000 --> 50:42.000\nThis is Aaron Mankey, everybody.\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:43.000\nHi.\n\n50:43.000 --> 50:45.000\nThanks for, thanks for, thank you.\n\n50:45.000 --> 50:46.000\nI'm such a big fan.\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:49.000\nYou don't know who I am, but I'm a big fan.\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:51.000\nI love this shit.\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:53.000\nHoly shit.\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:54.000\nYeah.\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:56.000\nFor those who don't know, lore is a very popular podcast.\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:59.000\nIt's, you know, Aaron's kind of a self starter and it's like,\n\n50:59.000 --> 51:00.000\nit's lore.\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:03.000\nIt's like, which I would describe as the crossroads between\n\n51:03.000 --> 51:05.000\nlegend and historical fact.\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:06.000\nRight.\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:10.000\nLike, like, it's like, oh, for every, for every vampire that\n\n51:10.000 --> 51:14.000\nwe hear exists, there's like a reason why we heard vampires\n\n51:14.000 --> 51:17.000\nexist, which goes back to some actual historical thing.\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:19.000\nAnd that's what lore is.\n\n51:19.000 --> 51:20.000\nRight.\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:21.000\nThat's a pretty good description.\n\n51:21.000 --> 51:22.000\nYeah.\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:23.000\nYeah.\n\n51:23.000 --> 51:25.000\nSo I discuss football and politics.\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:26.000\nYeah.\n\n51:26.000 --> 51:30.000\nBut, but, you know, and I think, I think particularly like I would\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:33.000\nsay the real reason for the success is that you take it very\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:34.000\nseriously.\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:37.000\nYou're a good researcher and you're a good, you're a good performer\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:38.000\ntoo.\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:39.000\nLike you, you're reading your own stuff.\n\n51:39.000 --> 51:44.000\nYou kind of, you kind of, to me, you embody why podcasting is\n\n51:44.000 --> 51:48.000\nbetter than other media at its best.\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:52.000\nIt's because there's an authenticity in addition to the\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:53.000\nprofessionalism.\n\n51:53.000 --> 51:55.000\nYou're not just a mannequin that was like, that would be hot.\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:59.000\nBut that was, that was like, that was carved out by the\n\n51:59.000 --> 52:00.000\nsystem's needs.\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:03.000\nSo it's like, oh, he's really good at making people believe him.\n\n52:03.000 --> 52:05.000\nSo he's cast behind this desk.\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:07.000\nAnd then these people that are good at writing things and these\n\n52:07.000 --> 52:08.000\npeople are good at shooting things.\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:11.000\nYou're a one man team that like you're interested in this stuff.\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:14.000\nAnd then you, you are who you are and your personality like exudes\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:18.000\nso we can trust you and listen to you talk about Loch Ness and\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:22.000\nvampires and werewolves and magic beans.\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:27.000\nAnd they're the magic fruit.\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:32.000\nWe made friends online because I, because I tweeted that after\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:35.000\nlistening to your podcast a lot and I'm going to have Aaron like\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:37.000\nread you so that people aren't familiar with him.\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:39.000\nI'm going to have him do a cold read of one of his lore\n\n52:39.000 --> 52:40.000\nintros.\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:41.000\nOpenings.\n\n52:41.000 --> 52:47.000\nWhich I just feel I have a certain style to them.\n\n52:47.000 --> 52:52.000\nAnd to the point where I like, I tweeted that after I make love\n\n52:52.000 --> 53:00.000\nto Cody, I like to just finish by saying, I'm Aaron Mankey.\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:05.000\nAnd let me say Cody has confirmed this is true.\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:09.000\nAnd then you tweeted back and we're like clearly unafended by it\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:11.000\nand we became fast friends.\n\n53:11.000 --> 53:16.000\nWe met up for drinks and we like each other's jibs.\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:23.000\nBut yeah, I mean, yeah, I'm not good at anything.\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:27.000\nBut do you want to, let's just give him a taste of, this is Aaron\n\n53:27.000 --> 53:31.000\ndoing a live cold read of kind of like what he does at the top of\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:32.000\neach of his episodes.\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:33.000\nYou've got one pulled up.\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:34.000\nThat's the text.\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:36.000\nAnd Jeff, you've got some of the music.\n\n53:36.000 --> 53:37.000\nI've got some of your music here.\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:38.000\nYeah.\n\n53:38.000 --> 53:40.000\nMake sure to eat that mic, brother.\n\n53:40.000 --> 53:42.000\nYeah, get the mic right at close.\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:43.000\nThis is Boston.\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:44.000\nThey don't fucking.\n\n53:44.000 --> 53:46.000\nDo you want me to start?\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:47.000\nCan I get a lapel mic, please?\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:48.000\nAnd a suit jacket?\n\n53:48.000 --> 53:51.000\nAnd a glass of, I'm going to live it 20 years.\n\n53:51.000 --> 53:52.000\nChablis.\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:53.000\nYes.\n\n53:53.000 --> 53:55.000\nDo you want the music to begin?\n\n53:55.000 --> 53:56.000\nPlease.\n\n53:56.000 --> 53:57.000\nOkay, here we go.\n\n53:57.000 --> 53:58.000\nYeah.\n\n53:58.000 --> 54:15.000\nOn June 24th, 1408, a French court sentenced a murderer to death\n\n54:15.000 --> 54:16.000\nby execution.\n\n54:16.000 --> 54:20.000\nShe had entered the home of a neighbor and found a four month old\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:23.000\nchild inside alone and unattended.\n\n54:23.000 --> 54:27.000\nAlthough she never disclosed her reason for doing so.\n\n54:27.000 --> 54:31.000\nShe killed the child right there in the house.\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:34.000\nAfter her trial, she was moved to the prison to be held until her\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:35.000\nexecution.\n\n54:35.000 --> 54:39.000\nThe others who were in prison there most certainly jeered at her.\n\n54:39.000 --> 54:41.000\nThey called her names.\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:45.000\nYes, they were hardened criminals, but to kill a child, even they were\n\n54:45.000 --> 54:46.000\nappalled.\n\n54:46.000 --> 54:51.000\nThe prison, however, treated her with the same as the same as those\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:53.000\nmen charged.\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:56.000\nCharged her family the same daily rate for her meals.\n\n54:56.000 --> 55:00.000\nThe quality was a rare thing for her, you see.\n\n55:00.000 --> 55:05.000\nOn July 17th, she was guided to the platform and a rope was placed\n\n55:05.000 --> 55:06.000\naround her neck.\n\n55:06.000 --> 55:10.000\nA crowd was most likely gathered that day to watch the spectacle.\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:14.000\nLike the criminals inside the prison, they too had mocked her and\n\n55:14.000 --> 55:15.000\nshouted insults.\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:20.000\nAnd then after the trapdoor snapped open, she plummeted to her\n\n55:20.000 --> 55:21.000\ndeath.\n\n55:21.000 --> 55:23.000\nIt was over.\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:26.000\nHistory is full of these stories.\n\n55:26.000 --> 55:30.000\nA criminal goes to trial and justice wins the day.\n\n55:30.000 --> 55:35.000\nWhat was odd about that trial in 1408, though, was the suspect,\n\n55:35.000 --> 55:39.000\nbecause she wasn't a local woman or even a relative of the child she\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:40.000\nkilled.\n\n55:40.000 --> 55:43.000\nShe wasn't even human, you see.\n\n55:43.000 --> 55:45.000\nShe was a pig.\n\n55:45.000 --> 55:51.000\nLiterally, a farm animal tried in the court of law and sentenced to be\n\n55:51.000 --> 56:03.000\nshot to death and then executed on the gallows three weeks later.\n\n56:03.000 --> 56:05.000\nSay it.\n\n56:05.000 --> 56:07.000\nSay it.\n\n56:07.000 --> 56:29.000\nBetter eight than never.\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:33.000\nDuring the long history of criminal trials, spanning cultures and\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:37.000\nhistories, all manner of oddities have entered the courtroom.\n\n56:37.000 --> 56:41.000\nAs unusual as it might sound to put livestock on trial, humans have\n\n56:41.000 --> 56:43.000\nbeen guilty of worse.\n\n56:43.000 --> 56:49.000\nYou see, sometimes even the dead get to testify.\n\n56:49.000 --> 57:04.000\nI'm Aaron Mankey, and this is Harmontown.\n\n57:04.000 --> 57:09.000\nIt's the podcasting equivalent of having, like, skrillex up here.\n\n57:09.000 --> 57:12.000\nHe's like, wow, he really does just do it that way.\n\n57:12.000 --> 57:17.000\nI thought you'd be like, well, I need 70 takes.\n\n57:17.000 --> 57:20.000\nYeah, you paused and we thought you were going to say I'm Aaron Mankey,\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:23.000\nand you said better eight than never.\n\n57:23.000 --> 57:25.000\nThat wasn't in the original, was it?\n\n57:25.000 --> 57:26.000\nNo.\n\n57:26.000 --> 57:27.000\nJust checking.\n\n57:27.000 --> 57:29.000\nJust checking because it would have worked there.\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:30.000\nThat would have been great.\n\n57:30.000 --> 57:31.000\nIt would have been great in there.\n\n57:31.000 --> 57:32.000\nI would have been okay with that.\n\n57:32.000 --> 57:33.000\nNo sense on that poster.\n\n57:33.000 --> 57:35.000\nDo you want me to go back and edit that audio?\n\n57:35.000 --> 57:36.000\nWould you please?\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:37.000\nFor the old episode?\n\n57:37.000 --> 57:38.000\nWould you please?\n\n57:38.000 --> 57:39.000\nWould you please?\n\n57:39.000 --> 57:42.000\nDo you think back in 1408 they were frugal enough and frifty enough that they\n\n57:42.000 --> 57:46.000\nate that pig, or do you not eat a condemned pig?\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:48.000\nI'm going to guess they ate it.\n\n57:48.000 --> 57:49.000\nYeah.\n\n57:49.000 --> 57:54.000\nI mean, I want it very badly to be able to do this because most fans of podcasts,\n\n57:54.000 --> 57:59.000\nlike, we listen to you, and then I want to do what you do.\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:02.000\nAnd I don't know, and I've been thinking, like, well, Jeff has the music,\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:09.000\nand I want to try doing it, but I don't know how to, like, I just want to try one.\n\n58:09.000 --> 58:11.000\nYou just play the music.\n\n58:11.000 --> 58:17.000\nAnd give me a, will you give me a topic to, give me a, or what?\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:19.000\nGive them some folklore to riff on.\n\n58:19.000 --> 58:20.000\nYeah.\n\n58:20.000 --> 58:24.000\nI don't know if we're local enough for that.\n\n58:24.000 --> 58:26.000\nI do Salem witch trials.\n\n58:26.000 --> 58:27.000\nSalem witch trials?\n\n58:27.000 --> 58:28.000\nYeah.\n\n58:28.000 --> 58:32.000\nSo then I have to, what I've learned from you is I have to back up three, three,\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:36.000\nlike, boxes from Salem witch trials or even witches.\n\n58:36.000 --> 58:37.000\nSo, okay.\n\n58:37.000 --> 58:38.000\nRight.\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:41.000\nI'm going to start off by talking about the history of Antiochquist.\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:42.000\nRight.\n\n58:42.000 --> 58:43.000\nAnd then we'll work our way up to.\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:44.000\nYeah.\n\n58:44.000 --> 58:45.000\nYou ready then?\n\n58:45.000 --> 58:46.000\nYeah.\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:47.000\nWhat?\n\n58:47.000 --> 58:48.000\nHere we go.\n\n58:48.000 --> 59:01.000\nIn 1981, Arnold Palmer was at the top of the charts.\n\n59:01.000 --> 59:07.000\nHe loved music, but what he really loved was socks.\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:15.000\nSocks made of cotton and Arnold Palmer could only buy those socks in one store.\n\n59:15.000 --> 59:25.000\nYou see, cotton was scarce and socks being made from them were scarcer.\n\n59:25.000 --> 59:34.000\nSo when Arnold Palmer walked into the Sears that day, what he didn't know.\n\n59:34.000 --> 59:38.000\nWell, is that he'd be starting on fire?\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:46.000\nThe fluorescent lights due to faulty wiring in the section above the men's socks caught\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:57.000\nfire and fell on his head, bursting him into flames and ending the career of a celebrated\n\n59:57.000 --> 59:59.500\nmusician.\n\n59:59.500 --> 01:00:09.500\nYou see, America burns what it loves.\n\n01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:16.840\nWhether it's Michael Jackson or a witch.\n\n01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:27.440\nWhat is a witch and where does a witch go if a witch doesn't know?\n\n01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:37.600\nWhen I think about witches, I think about Salem, the capital of witches, but not a good place\n\n01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:40.320\nfor them to live.\n\n01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:56.440\nYou see, in Salem, as far back as 1492, these witches far from sailing the ocean blue.\n\n01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:06.440\nWere subjected to the opposite of oceans, fire, the same fire that burnt Arnold Palmer\n\n01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:14.440\nand Michael Jackson and eventually the Loch Ness Monster.\n\n01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:25.440\nBut that cold day in 1492, Salem was about to learn that what goes around burns around.\n\n01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.440\nI'm Aaron Mahnke.\n\n01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:40.440\nAnd this is Lore.\n\n01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:42.440\nI have a couple of follow-up questions about that.\n\n01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:44.440\nI think I was thinking of Robert Palmer, by the way.\n\n01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:46.440\nRobert Palmer would be...\n\n01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.440\nNot that it matters.\n\n01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:50.440\nPeople forget about that.\n\n01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.440\nNot only was Arnie a great golfer, but he had some great hits in the early 80s.\n\n01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.440\nHe was simply irresistible.\n\n01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:00.440\nRemember that video where he's got the golf club and the girls with the lipstick?\n\n01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:01.440\nArnold.\n\n01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:07.440\nShe's so fine, she got a bogey on the back night.\n\n01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:16.440\nShe's so fine, there's iced tea in her lemonade.\n\n01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:23.440\nSo your podcast, you let go, okay, so there's these monsters and stuff and this is how you get rid of them?\n\n01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:30.440\nLike if a Dracula shows up.\n\n01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:34.440\nIf a Dracula shows up, you could say, well, actually, garlic doesn't work on Dracula.\n\n01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.440\nIt only works on Boris Barlow.\n\n01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:41.440\nI'm not really the Neil deGrasse Tyson of folklore.\n\n01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:42.440\nThat's not what I do.\n\n01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:48.440\nWho is, in your opinion, today in the world?\n\n01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:57.440\nNo, but I haven't heard of this until now, so I'm going to check it out.\n\n01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:03.440\nWell, here's the rock because you're not as much of a...\n\n01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:04.440\nDog?\n\n01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.440\nHe's more of a visual guy.\n\n01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:14.440\nYou'd be happy to know he's working on his second season of the hit show lore based on his podcast and that there's a season out.\n\n01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:15.440\nWhat is it, Amazon?\n\n01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:16.440\nAmazon.\n\n01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.440\nYou can watch it.\n\n01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:18.440\nOh, okay, even better.\n\n01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:22.440\nYou can watch it come to life and Robert Patrick's in one.\n\n01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:25.440\nYou remember him from The Terminator.\n\n01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:28.440\nHe's so stupid you have to trick him into smart stuff.\n\n01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.440\nRobert Patrick?\n\n01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:35.440\nRobert Patrick is stupid?\n\n01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:38.440\nShit.\n\n01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.440\nBut Erin, are you from Boston?\n\n01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.440\nNo, no, I grew up in the Midwest.\n\n01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:45.440\nWhy do you have a relationship with the Wilbur?\n\n01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:49.440\nI remember because you saw that I was performing here and you're like, hey, I'm going to be there.\n\n01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:52.440\nThe folks that run the Wilbur have a tour company for folks like us.\n\n01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:53.440\nOkay.\n\n01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:55.440\nAnd they represent me in book venues.\n\n01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.440\nI played here a year and a half ago.\n\n01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:00.440\nYou ever see the blue man group here?\n\n01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.440\nHow would you get rid of a blue man?\n\n01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:04.440\nBack to your bags.\n\n01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.440\nAll right.\n\n01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.440\nWhat gets rid of a blue man?\n\n01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:10.440\nWhat's the origin of the blue man?\n\n01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:13.440\nYou make a circle of salt, right?\n\n01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.440\nAnd it stops them.\n\n01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:15.440\nOkay.\n\n01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.440\nLike slugs.\n\n01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:17.440\nAll right.\n\n01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:19.440\nSpencer, will you do a lore intro about the blue man group?\n\n01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:20.440\nIf it's bad.\n\n01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.440\nSure.\n\n01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:30.440\nUh-oh.\n\n01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.440\nWait, it's being weird.\n\n01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:33.440\nAll right.\n\n01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.440\nSomebody help me out.\n\n01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:35.440\nWhere'd it go?\n\n01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.440\nLet's talk about immigration.\n\n01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.440\nOkay.\n\n01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:42.440\nI think it's a problem.\n\n01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:47.440\nIt drives me nuts when somebody posts a picture and it'll be a picture of a pretty white girl\n\n01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:52.440\nand it'll say, like, separated from her family when an immigrant shot her.\n\n01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.440\nAnd you go, okay.\n\n01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:55.440\nOkay.\n\n01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.440\nSo you care about people.\n\n01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:03.440\nSo let's pass a bunch of sweeping legislation to protect people.\n\n01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:05.440\nI'm sure you're into all of those.\n\n01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:08.440\nAnd then they go, well, it's contrary to what you might think.\n\n01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:09.440\nI'm not just some trailer trash.\n\n01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:11.440\nI do have opinions about it.\n\n01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:15.440\nIt's like, why are we having a grown-up conversation that you crashed with your fucking photo of\n\n01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:17.440\nsomebody saying, like, ooh, a brown person shot.\n\n01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:20.440\nThere's, like, people just post memes.\n\n01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.440\nAnd then they're like, look at this.\n\n01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:23.440\nOogity boogity.\n\n01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:26.440\nAnd it's like a dead rat they bring in from the backyard.\n\n01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:30.440\nAnd then you're supposed to dim the lights and pour some wine and talk to them like adults.\n\n01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:33.440\nIs that how you get rid of a blue man?\n\n01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.440\nNo.\n\n01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:35.440\nCan you get a blue rat?\n\n01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:36.440\nNo.\n\n01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:37.440\nOkay.\n\n01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:38.440\nBut keep looking.\n\n01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:43.440\nWhat could I get rid of with that spell?\n\n01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:46.440\nI think I'm not understanding the show yet.\n\n01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.440\nIt's, well...\n\n01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:49.440\nStill.\n\n01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:52.440\nIt's about actual shit.\n\n01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.440\nThe asshole.\n\n01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:56.440\nThe blue man group exists.\n\n01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:57.440\nI've seen commercials.\n\n01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.440\nYeah, so...\n\n01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:01.440\nSo name something...\n\n01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:02.440\nDickhead!\n\n01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:03.440\nName something that doesn't exist.\n\n01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:07.440\nTelling him that I'm stupid with the Robert Patrick side mouth?\n\n01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:09.440\nYou didn't think I saw that?\n\n01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:17.440\nYou're talking into a microphone, you dipshit.\n\n01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:27.440\nI'm glad I came.\n\n01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:30.440\nThat is the most twisted attack on anyone ever.\n\n01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:32.440\nI'm glad I'm here.\n\n01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:33.440\nYou know what?\n\n01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:36.440\nYou deserve me being in your life.\n\n01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:39.440\nI couldn't have happened to a better person.\n\n01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:42.440\nSo I found what it's like to be on Twitter.\n\n01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:43.440\nRight here.\n\n01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:45.440\nYeah.\n\n01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:46.440\nYeah.\n\n01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:50.440\nWell, you know, you had a little dust-up with Crystalia,\n\n01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:54.440\nand you've been active on Twitter,\n\n01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:57.440\nand you've been like, you know, you're Aaron Mankey,\n\n01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:01.440\nand you have your opinions,\n\n01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.440\nand you're finding out what all of us are,\n\n01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.440\nwhich is like, well, people might like your podcast\n\n01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.440\nbecause it's about werewolves,\n\n01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:08.440\nand they might also maybe vote differently from you\n\n01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.440\nor have a different opinion,\n\n01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.440\nand then you tweet something,\n\n01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.440\nand then people pile on you, right?\n\n01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.440\nThey go like, what the fuck, bro?\n\n01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:19.440\nMy girlfriend and I try to fuck to your podcast, man.\n\n01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:23.440\nThe fuck you talking about baby-switch for?\n\n01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.440\nTalk about werewolves on your Twitter,\n\n01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:30.440\nand then you're like, eat me, right?\n\n01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:31.440\nWell, you know.\n\n01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.440\nIn so many words.\n\n01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:33.440\nRight.\n\n01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:34.440\nYeah.\n\n01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:35.440\nRight.\n\n01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:38.440\nThat's probably the last thing I could say, right?\n\n01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:39.440\nProbably.\n\n01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:41.440\nBut you don't get on Twitter to become happy, right?\n\n01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:44.440\nWe can recognize at least as a population\n\n01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.440\nthat we don't get on Twitter to make ourselves happy.\n\n01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:48.440\nWe're getting on Twitter to make ourselves unhappy.\n\n01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:51.440\nLike, we never go like, I'm so happy right now.\n\n01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:53.440\nI should be happier.\n\n01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:54.440\nI'm gonna get on Twitter.\n\n01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:56.440\nIf you're happy, you forget to get on Twitter.\n\n01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.440\nIf you're sad, you're like, I'm so fucking sad.\n\n01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:01.440\nI don't know whether I should eat glass,\n\n01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:05.440\nlike eat a box of donuts,\n\n01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:07.440\nlike dip my head in turpentine,\n\n01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.440\nor get on Twitter.\n\n01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:11.440\nTwitter's the closest thing you can do.\n\n01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.440\nBefriend a vending machine.\n\n01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.440\nWhat's that?\n\n01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.440\nOr befriend a vending machine?\n\n01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:17.440\nYeah, well, no.\n\n01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:18.440\nI mean, that was a joyous night.\n\n01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.440\nLike, I won't have you...\n\n01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.440\nYou guys are acting like I was described.\n\n01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:24.440\nI was happy last night.\n\n01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:27.440\nThat's a new thing I learned from my personal trainer, Dave Kline,\n\n01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:30.440\nif you watch my Instagram workouts.\n\n01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:32.440\nDave Kline has been on the show.\n\n01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:36.440\nHe told me, you know, he kind of blew my mind with this.\n\n01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:39.440\nI'm trying to practice this and seeing how it goes.\n\n01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:43.440\nHe said, you know, love can be a weapon.\n\n01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:45.440\nHe didn't put it that way.\n\n01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:49.440\nLike, you can choose to express love\n\n01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:54.440\nand be in a loving place as an assertion of your power.\n\n01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.440\nI'm paraphrasing him.\n\n01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:00.440\nWe associate love with, like, acquiescence and, like,\n\n01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:06.440\noh, I have to break through past all of my needs to be in control\n\n01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:09.440\nand not feel stupid.\n\n01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:12.440\nAnd, like, all these things that society kind of, like, demands of us in the moment.\n\n01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:16.440\nLike, it's kind of incompatible with this idea we have about love,\n\n01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:19.440\nwhich is that you're zen and you're open to everything\n\n01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:22.440\nand you're even kind of weak on purpose\n\n01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:25.440\nand you're osmosically going to absorb everyone's point of view and stuff.\n\n01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:29.440\nBut there's this version of love where you can just be like,\n\n01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:32.440\nI love everything because that gives me power.\n\n01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:36.440\nThat makes me a good person and it gives me power over everyone.\n\n01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:41.440\nLike, it makes me a more evolved person.\n\n01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:44.440\nYou can choose to do it for kind of selfish reasons to be like,\n\n01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:46.440\nI'm in love with what's going on right now\n\n01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:49.440\nbecause I'm better than people.\n\n01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:51.440\nI think that's fair.\n\n01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:55.440\nI mean, that seems like it slots in with the four agreements, honestly.\n\n01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.440\nIt's certainly, like...\n\n01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.440\nIt's very nice.\n\n01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.440\nYou know, maybe it's not the best way to be taught about love,\n\n01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.440\nbut it's certainly, like, maybe a rope into the pit\n\n01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:04.440\nwhen you're not feeling love at all.\n\n01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:08.440\nAnd you're like, like, oh, man, I just want to, like, eat a rock right now.\n\n01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:10.440\nI don't want to love anything.\n\n01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.440\nAnd it's always like, yeah, but you know what love is,\n\n01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:15.440\nit's making everybody else eat your fucking love shit.\n\n01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.440\nYou know?\n\n01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:20.440\nLike, if I get off the elevator at Rick and Morty's offices\n\n01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:23.440\nand I come out and I'm feeling like I love being there,\n\n01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:27.440\nI'm going to, everyone else is going to be happier\n\n01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.440\nand do a better job.\n\n01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:33.440\nAnd, like, it is strength and it is leadership.\n\n01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.440\nHow are you going to do that?\n\n01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.440\n70 episodes.\n\n01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.440\nI mean, how?\n\n01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.440\nBy loving, by loving it.\n\n01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:47.440\nI love it.\n\n01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:51.440\nThere's so many, Dan, it's so many episodes.\n\n01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:53.440\n70.\n\n01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:55.440\nHow many have you done so far?\n\n01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:56.440\nWhat's the answer?\n\n01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:57.440\nI have a question.\n\n01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:59.440\nWhat's the answer to your question?\n\n01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.440\nWhat's a Rick and Mortis?\n\n01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.440\nNo.\n\n01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:10.440\nYou know, there's supposed to be an unspoken exchange of fandom here.\n\n01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.440\nRight?\n\n01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.440\nNo, it's the current news.\n\n01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:15.440\nAre you ready with the...\n\n01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:16.440\nSo many episodes.\n\n01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.440\nYeah, what are you doing here?\n\n01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.440\nSpencer's going to do it.\n\n01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:20.440\nWhy are you here?\n\n01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:21.440\nAre you writing right now?\n\n01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.440\nWhat's that?\n\n01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:23.440\nShould you be writing it?\n\n01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:24.440\nYou should be writing it right now.\n\n01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:25.440\nI had to cut.\n\n01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:26.440\nYou haven't even started.\n\n01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:29.440\nWe've been waiting how long.\n\n01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:31.440\nMonths. Months?\n\n01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:32.440\nRight?\n\n01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.440\nI mean, come on.\n\n01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.440\nCome on, where is it?\n\n01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:38.440\nWhere is it, Dan?\n\n01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:39.440\nWhere is it?\n\n01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.440\nDan, where's it?\n\n01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:42.440\nWhere is it?\n\n01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:43.440\nWhat are you doing?\n\n01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:45.440\nYou better start writing it.\n\n01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:48.440\nAre you going to write one right now, Dan?\n\n01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.440\nGod.\n\n01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:50.440\nIf I have to.\n\n01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.440\nHe'll try.\n\n01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:52.440\n70 episodes. Get to work.\n\n01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:54.440\nCan we pull up...\n\n01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:00.440\nWelcome to Notes.\n\n01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:07.440\nI can't wait to see that first porn page just open up.\n\n01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:09.440\nThis is Levy's laptop.\n\n01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:11.440\nHe's asexual.\n\n01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.440\nHe's not asexual.\n\n01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.440\nHe listens to Dave Matthews.\n\n01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.440\nHe's not last night.\n\n01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:18.440\nThe only thing I hear is...\n\n01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:20.440\nI stand correct to her dates, believe me.\n\n01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:22.440\nI take it back.\n\n01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:24.440\nNo, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.\n\n01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:26.440\nAnd also, you can be asexual.\n\n01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.440\nI admire you if you are.\n\n01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:30.440\nIt's not an insult.\n\n01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:34.440\nIt's actually, I think, I envy you.\n\n01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.440\nI would like to be asexual.\n\n01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:38.440\nWould you like to be...are you asexual?\n\n01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:41.440\nFirst, are you?\n\n01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:44.440\nFirst question. Want to fuck?\n\n01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:46.440\nDo you think that's like an asexual thing?\n\n01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.440\nPeople get together at asexual bars and they're like,\n\n01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:50.440\nI don't need to have sex. Me neither.\n\n01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:53.440\nMe as well then, right?

1982.\n\n01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:21.440\nMankind, or should I say, some kind,\n\n01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:39.440\nhas sought to answer one particular nagging question.\n\n01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:48.440\nWho am I?\n\n01:24:48.440 --> 01:25:02.440\nWhere did I get here from?\n\n01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:03.440\nCrunch, crunch, crunch.\n\n01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:13.440\nHow can I guarantee that a Dracula won't bury me alive?\n\n01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:18.440\nThe answer has come in a variety of forms.\n\n01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:30.440\nFrom shoes to Tonka trucks and tampons.\n\n01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:34.440\nBut one theme continues to emerge\n\n01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:50.440\non the winding road of mortality.\n\n01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:52.440\nI'm Aaron Mankey.\n\n01:25:52.440 --> 01:26:01.440\nAnd this is the Omega protocol.\n\n01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:04.440\nThat was a good line read.\n\n01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:12.440\nAaron Mankey turns into a moth man.\n\n01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:19.440\nRun, Morty!\n\n01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:40.440\nI just wanted to make toilets.\n\n01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:44.440\nAll will be consumed by the flame eye circle.\n\n01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:46.440\nOh, that does actually make sense.\n\n01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:50.440\nI thought it was a typo, but no, that's good.\n\n01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:52.440\nYou liked the delivery, was that good?\n\n01:26:52.440 --> 01:27:04.440\nAaron Mankey eats everyone.\n\n01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:16.440\nThat's here for crew, everybody.\n\n01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:22.440\nI don't think that's going to be riveting radio.\n\n01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:25.440\nBut it's going to be great television.\n\n01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:30.440\nSo the season is 70 episodes long?\n\n01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:32.440\nWho does that?\n\n01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:34.440\nEveryone keeps going, oh, so it'll be seven seasons.\n\n01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:37.440\nI'm like, no, welcome to 25 episodes a year\n\n01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:40.440\nand early retirement.\n\n01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:45.440\nI will show you how bad a Rick and Morty can get.\n\n01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:49.440\nI'm writing one right now with my extra Iron Man suit at home.\n\n01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:53.440\nThis is episode eight.\n\n01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:55.440\nI'll fuck up a Spider-Man from here.\n\n01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:56.440\nI don't care.\n\n01:27:56.440 --> 01:28:01.440\nI'm like training Spider-Man with one suit.\n\n01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:04.440\nMarvel loyalists.\n\n01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:06.440\nIt's felt like Spider-Man deserves to not just become\n\n01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:10.440\nlike an adjunct to the Iron Man.\n\n01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:13.440\nCome on, Spider-Man.\n\n01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:18.440\nAll right, let's hear the blue man group.\n\n01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:20.440\nOh, shit, this is going to be...\n\n01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:22.440\nBlue man group, Laura, intro by Spencer.\n\n01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:32.440\nAPPLAUSE\n\n01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:36.440\nMankind has been eating food for years,\n\n01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:38.440\ndecades, if we're honest.\n\n01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:43.440\nAnd for most of that time, it hasn't been salted.\n\n01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:47.440\nWhen John Wilkes Booth walked into the mall one day,\n\n01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:53.440\nhe had no idea what he was about to add to the culinary landscape.\n\n01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:57.440\nSpying a big crystalline rock, he needed to lick it.\n\n01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:00.440\nAnd lick it, he did.\n\n01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:02.440\nSince then, salt has been commonplace at the dinner table\n\n01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:06.440\nacross America and the world.\n\n01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:08.440\nBut that made no difference to Margaret Cho\n\n01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:10.440\nas she left her house one morning,\n\n01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:15.440\nheaded to the same mall.\n\n01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:19.440\nThe sound was peculiar.\n\n01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:24.440\nA corpse torn asunder, covered in blue markings,\n\n01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:30.440\nand surrounded by the remnants of a broken salt circle.\n\n01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:36.440\nNo one knows what the first sighting of the blue man group was.\n\n01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:39.440\nAnd one doesn't have to, to fear.\n\n01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:43.440\nYou see, things that are blue have a way\n\n01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:46.440\nof coming back around,\n\n01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:51.440\nand things that aren't might just surprise you.\n\n01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:56.440\nI'm Aaron Mankey, and this is Lore.\n\n01:29:56.440 --> 01:30:01.440\nAPPLAUSE\n\n01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:04.440\nThat's a good Lore! That's a good Lore!\n\n01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:06.440\nThat's good!\n\n01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:09.440\nI am a huge fan. I love your stuff.\n\n01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:11.440\nYou've got the job!\n\n01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:13.440\nThank you.\n\n01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:15.440\nThere's some overlap with Dungeon Mastery.\n\n01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:19.440\nNo, I seriously, the real-world take on folklore\n\n01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:21.440\nis very inspiring as someone who weaves folklore\n\n01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:23.440\ninto fantasy narratives.\n\n01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:26.440\nI think it's a really cool source of inspiration.\n\n01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:29.440\nI constantly hear from people that do D&D campaigns\n\n01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:32.440\nand they take inspiration from the show to build stuff.\n\n01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:34.440\nI play D&D every week.\n\n01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:36.440\nOh, nice!\n\n01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:39.440\nAPPLAUSE\n\n01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:41.440\nWith racists.\n\n01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:43.440\nWhile we're on the topic, everyone...\n\n01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:45.440\nEveryone will...\n\n01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.440\nThat's the new thing.\n\n01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:49.440\nAlt-right D&D is ticking off, man.\n\n01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.440\nYeah.\n\n01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:54.440\nAnd a couple of campaigns ago, I was the Lore Bard.\n\n01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:56.440\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:56.440\nYou can believe it, yeah.\n\n01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:58.440\nA Lore Bard?\n\n01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:58.440\nYeah, if you're a Bard,\n\n01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:00.440\nyou can pick one of the colleges.\n\n01:30:58.440

one of the best spells.\n\n01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:06.440\nYou just make fun of people the entire night.\n\n01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:09.440\nYeah, you can kill someone by insulting them.\n\n01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:11.440\nIt's amazing.\n\n01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:11.440\nI would hate to get insulted by Aaron Mahnke.\n\n01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:13.440\nCan you imagine?\n\n01:31:11.440 -->

be entirely removed from that purpose,\n\n01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:36.440\nall together.\n\n01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:40.440\nThey look like raggedy-ass Kmart pants.\n\n01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:45.440\nI'm

A monculous?\n\n01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:38.440\nA monculous.\n\n01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:40.440\nThere was no magic to that.\n\n01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:42.440\nIt's actual experiments on trying to\n\n01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:44.440\nraise the dead.\n\n01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:46.440\nIt's actual things that people actually did.\n\n01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:48.440\nIt's not mythical.\n\n01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:50.440\nI don't know, people did this.\n\n01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:52.440\nThese are court cases that actually happens.\n\n01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.440\nGet yourself a dried gourd\n\n01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:56.440\nand fill it with some blood and some semen\n\n01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:58.440\nand maybe some ground bones,\n\n01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:00.440\nand then shove it up a horse's womb\n\n01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:02.440\nand wait for it.\n\n01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:04.440\nAnd then crack open a nice cool baby Schwitz.\n\n01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:06.440\nAs babyschwitz.com\n\n01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:08.440\nslash lore, offer code lore.\n\n01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:10.440\nGet a gourd\n\n01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:12.440\nand fill it with blood and

01:42:20.440\nIt doesn't make sense.\n\n01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:22.440\nBut we only know it doesn't make sense\n\n01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:24.440\nbecause we're standing on the shoulders of scientists.\n\n01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:26.440\nExactly.\n\n01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:28.440\nAnd actually that would be science at a certain point\n\n01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:30.440\nbecause you'd be like, well,\n\n01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:32.440\nother things have blood and semen in them\n\n01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:34.440\nand then a baby comes out so you're like,\n\n01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:36.440\nhow about if I put blood and semen in a gourd?\n\n01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:38.440\nThere's a misogynistic underpinning there, right?\n\n01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:40.440\nIt's like\n\n01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:42.440\nmen going like, come on,\n\n01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:44.440\nwe've got to be able to do this alone.\n\n01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:46.440\nIt's\n\n01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:48.440\nthey keep pulling this out\n\n01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:50.440\nin every argument.\n\n01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:52.440\nLike without me,\n\n01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:54.440\npeople like you wouldn't exist.\n\n01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:56.440\nI just got to be able to wave something at her face\n\n01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:58.440\nand go, I could come in a gourd.\n\n01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:00.440\nI could make a horse gourd.\n\n01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:02.440\nI haven't seen it written yet,\n\n01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:04.440\nbut we could make the argument that the alchemists\n\n01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:06.440\nwere like the first incels, right?\n\n01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:08.440\nYeah.\n\n01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:10.440\nOh.\n\n01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:12.440\nThey're definitely hacking and trolling\n\n01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:14.440\nbecause it was gold, basically,\n\n01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:16.440\nI mean, her emails.\n\n01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:18.440\nThere was an alchemist\n\n01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:20.440\nwho believed he could take urine\n\n01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:22.440\nand distill it into gold because, you know,\n\n01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:24.440\nthey're both yellow, right?\n\n01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:26.440\nSo he filled his basement\n\n01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:28.440\nwith buckets of his own piss.\n\n01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:30.440\nDo you want to riff this?\n\n01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:32.440\nCan we go to the...\n\n01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:34.440\nNo.\n\n01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:36.440\nCome on.\n\n01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:38.440\nI want to hear what it sounds like\n\n01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:40.440\nwhen you do our impression.\n\n01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:42.440\nLet's just try one.\n\n01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:44.440\nDo buckets of urine or whatever you want.\n\n01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:46.440\nAll right, you want me to give you something else?\n\n01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:48.440\nThat's my favorite Bob Dylan song.\n\n01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:50.440\nWhat about the Chupacabra?\n\n01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:56.440\nWait, you got to play...\n\n01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:58.440\nWell, get him with the music.\n\n01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:00.440\nThat's his spirit.\n\n01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:02.440\nThat's what he needs.\n\n01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:04.440\nIn 1121,\n\n01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:06.440\nJohanna spun fucking face.\n\n01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:08.440\nI wanted to make gold.\n\n01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:10.440\nSorry.\n\n01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:12.440\nSorry.\n\n01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:14.440\nThey did.\n\n01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:16.440\nThey wanted to make gold.\n\n01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:18.440\nThat's right.\n\n01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:20.440\nIt's true.\n\n01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:22.440\nThat's a secret.\n\n01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:24.440\nAdd a little truth.\n\n01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:26.440\nSo he bought himself five dozen buckets.\n\n01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:32.440\nUsing an ancient tome,\n\n01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:34.440\nhe lined the buckets up in his basement\n\n01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:36.440\nin a nice grid.\n\n01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:38.440\nAnd then he peed in them.\n\n01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:42.440\nIt smelled.\n\n01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:44.440\nHe had asparagus that night,\n\n01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:46.440\nbut that's what happens.\n\n01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:48.440\nBut six weeks later,\n\n01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:50.440\nthat urine had evaporated\n\n01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:52.440\nand left a sticky yellow residue.\n\n01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:56.440\nSadly, it didn't turn into gold,\n\n01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:58.440\nbut that cologne\n\n01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:00.440\nkept the ladies away for decades.\n\n01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:04.440\nI'm Aaron Mankey,\n\n01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:06.440\nand you pulled out.\n\n01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:08.440\nYou pulled out.\n\n01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:10.440\nIt's good.\n\n01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:12.440\nI mean, you've got the weapon\n\n01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:14.440\nthat it is your real voice.\n\n01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:16.440\nSo you can...\n\n01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:18.440\nIt's just fun to listen to it.\n\n01:45:18.440

Mack get some extra\n\n01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:28.440\nfeature of power last time?\n\n01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:30.440\nWhat's my AC?\n\n01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:32.440\n17.\n\n01:48:32.440 -->

how's it going?\n\n01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:50.440\nGreat.\n\n01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:52.440\nAwesome.\n\n01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:54.440\nLast time\n\n01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:56.440\non Harmontown.\n\n01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:58.440\nYeah!\n\n01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:00.440\nOur heroes.\n\n01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:02.440\nWhere were they?\n\n01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:04.440\nThey were in that town.\n\n01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:06.440\nDornester.\n\n01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:08.440\nDornester on the quest for Patchen's Gem.\n\n01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:10.440\nThey tried,\n\n01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:12.440\nnot very hard.\n\n01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:14.440\nThey gave up easily,\n\n01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:16.440\nand DJ went back at it\n\n01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:18.440\nand got captured.\n\n01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:20.440\nSensing imminent defeat,\n\n01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:22.440\nour heroes leapt into action\n\n01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:24.440\nand went to rescue DJ.\n\n01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:26.440\nAnd they found a fight.\n\n01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:28.440\nOh, they fought. Jeff turned into a tree.\n\n01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:30.440\nA bear showed up.\n\n01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:32.440\nA dwarf with a whiffleball\n\n01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:34.440\nteleported people outside of the building.\n\n01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:36.440\nAfter all was said and done,\n\n01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:38.440\nthey had a hostage.\n\n01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:40.440\nThey interrogated the hostage,\n\n01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:42.440\nand that led them to\n\n01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:44.440\na big farm.\n\n01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:46.440\nAt the farm, our heroes were\n\n01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:48.440\ninterrogated by the mute Boykin Hodge\n\n01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:50.440\nand with his help,\n\n01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:52.440\nthey found the stable they were looking for.\n\n01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:54.440\nAnd the gem,\n\n01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:56.440\nthat was Patchen's.\n\n01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:58.440\nBut then they were attacked\n\n01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:00.440\nby that very same man,\n\n01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:02.440\nwho turned out to be a vampire.\n\n01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:04.440\nHe was easily killed.\n\n01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:06.440\nWhat'll happen next?\n\n01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:08.440\nFind out now\n\n01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:13.440\non Harmon Time.\n\n01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:20.440\nOkay, sorry everybody.\n\n01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:23.440\nSo, you're in Boykin Hodge's big stables.\n\n01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:25.440\nYou just killed him and he exploded\n\n01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:27.440\ninto dust and skeletons after being\n\n01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:29.440\nstaked by Garry Shandling's fingers.\n\n01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:32.440\nDust and skeletons\n\n01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:35.440\nhe exploded into.\n\n01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:37.440\nYeah, multiple.\n\n01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:39.440\nMultiple dusts.\n\n01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:41.440\nI collected the dust\n\n01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:43.440\nand put it in my glass jar.\n\n01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:45.440\nThank you very much, DJ.\n\n01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:47.440\nThat's very nice.\n\n01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:49.440\nYou know, before, sorry.\n\n01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:51.440\nNo, you go.\n\n01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:53.440\nThat's not sarcasm.\n\n01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:55.440\nYou know, before...\n\n01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:57.440\nBut that was...\n\n01:50:57.440 --> 01:50:59.440\nBefore killing this vampire,\n\n01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:01.440\nI was having second thoughts\n\n01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:03.440\nabout whether or not we were good\n\n01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:05.440\nor bad people.\n\n01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:07.440\nI'm a monster, but, you know,\n\n01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:10.440\nI'm also a decent person.\n\n01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:12.440\nSo, I, you know,\n\n01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:14.440\nbut we did some good work here,\n\n01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:16.440\nor pretty much just me,\n\n01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:18.440\nbut there was a good things here\n\n01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:20.440\nbecause this vampire probably\n\n01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:22.440\nwould have hurt some other people\n\n01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:24.440\nand creating more vampires,\n\n01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:26.440\nwhich would hurt other people.\n\n01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:29.440\nSo, you're welcome.\n\n01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:31.440\nI'm gonna stick around, I'm thinking.\n\n01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:33.440\nOh, stick around.\n\n01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:35.440\nAre you currently holding the gem?\n\n01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:36.440\nDo you have it, Carlos?\n\n01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:37.440\nLet's say Carlos, yeah.\n\n01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:39.440\nYeah, we were thinking about\n\n01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:41.440\nputting it in Barony Max,\n\n01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:43.440\nbut because...\n\n01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:45.440\nI should hold it because I killed the vampire,\n\n01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:46.440\nso just...\n\n01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:47.440\nI support that.\n\n01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:48.440\nThank you.\n\n01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:49.440\nThank you, Bear.\n\n01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:51.440\nYou know, they say if you take a gem\n\n01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:53.440\nand you put some blood and some jizz on it,\n\n01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:55.440\nyou put it up a bear's ass.\n\n01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:57.440\nI don't know what they say.\n\n01:51:57.440 --> 01:51:59.440\nI just...\n\n01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:02.440\nI am gonna hold on to it.\n\n01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:05.440\nBut you didn't kill the vampire.\n\n01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:07.440\nNo, he's kind of a George for part of our A-team.\n\n01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:09.440\nI say we let him...\n\n01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:11.440\nI just think...\n\n01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:12.440\nI just...\n\n01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:14.440\nYou're an outlier.\n\n01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:18.440\nAn outlier?\n\n01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:21.440\nI don't know what...\n\n01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:23.440\nAll right, here's the gem.\n\n01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:26.440\nThank you.\n\n01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:30.440\nBut it's not a...\n\n01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:32.440\nIt's...\n\n01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:34.440\nYou understand it's not for comedy.\n\n01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:36.440\nIt's like we've been looking for it for a long time.\n\n01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:39.440\nWhy would it be for comedy if we've been...\n\n01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:41.440\nI just put it in my leaf.\n\n01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:43.440\nI know, it's just not a bit.\n\n01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:45.440\nYou seem to be made of bits.\n\n01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:46.440\nI don't know...\n\n01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:48.440\nI'm giving a gem to a guy that's like\n\n01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:50.440\nmade of bits.\n\n01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:52.440\nBits of...\n\n01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:53.440\nOf comedy.\n\n01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:54.440\nI don't know...\n\n01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:56.440\nDo you even have pockets?\n\n01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:57.440\nYou're like...\n\n01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:59.440\nI'm a shambling mound.\n\n01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:01.440\nPockets of stuff all over the place.\n\n01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:03.440\nIt's like falling off of you.\n\n01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:05.440\nIf Autumn comes, does the gem...\n\n01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:06.440\nNo, give it...\n\n01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:07.440\nHere, take it.\n\n01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:08.440\nWhat's in your pockets?\n\n01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:09.440\nTake it.\n\n01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:10.440\nWhat's in your pockets?\n\n01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:11.440\nNo, wait.\n\n01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:12.440\nTake it.\n\n01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:13.440\nTake it back.\n\n01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:14.440\nSince you...\n\n01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:15.440\nNo, no.\n\n01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:16.440\nSee...\n\n01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:17.440\nI don't want it.\n\n01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:18.440\nFine.\n\n01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:19.440\nIt's on the ground.\n\n01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:20.440\nGreat.\n\n01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:22.440\nI pick it up and put it in my glass jar.\n\n01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:23.440\nOkay.\n\n01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:25.440\nAaron, is this how you play D&D?\n\n01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:26.440\nThis is how you do it?\n\n01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:27.440\nWell, there's always the one guy\n\n01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:29.440\nwho picks everything up and puts it in the glass jar.\n\n01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:30.440\nAnd the audience and everything?\n\n01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:31.440\nYeah.\n\n01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:32.440\nOkay.\n\n01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:33.440\nAll right, so do we need to...\n\n01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:35.440\nWait, what's in your pockets?\n\n01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:36.440\nThank you.\n\n01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:37.440\nLeaves.\n\n01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:38.440\nMore leaves.\n\n01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:40.440\nHow many pockets of leaves do you have?\n\n01:53:40.440 --> 01:53:41.440\nAll of them.\n\n01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:42.440\nI don't know.\n\n01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:44.440\nAre you just a big pocket of leaves?\n\n01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:45.440\nYeah.\n\n01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:47.440\nSo why do you have pockets of leaves?\n\n01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:48.440\nWhat are...\n\n01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:50.440\nOkay, you know,\n\n01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:52.440\nlet's just move on from this.\n\n01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:53.440\nHe's got it.\n\n01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:55.440\nI thought I, you know,\n\n01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:57.440\nyou appreciated what I did,\n\n01:53:57.440 --> 01:53:58.440\nbut you didn't.\n\n01:53:58.440 --> 01:53:59.440\nSo it doesn't matter.\n\n01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:00.440\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:01.440\nYou don't have to appreciate...\n\n01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:02.440\nNo, we need to...\n\n01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:03.440\nDo we need to find Patchens\n\n01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:05.440\nand return this gem to Patchens?\n\n01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:07.440\nWhat a great question.\n\n01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:09.440\nWhy were you finding Patchens, Jim?\n\n01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:11.440\nDo you guys remember?\n\n01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:13.440\nWell, because we felt guilty\n\n01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:16.440\nbecause we got waylaid by bandits on the road\n\n01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:18.440\nand they took Patchens' gem.\n\n01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:20.440\nRight, and so you're getting it for him.\n\n01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:21.440\nYes.\n\n01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:22.440\nSo we have to...\n\n01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:24.440\nWe have to get this back to Patchens.\n\n01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:25.440\nYeah.\n\n01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:26.440\nWe have to get this back to you,\n\n01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:27.440\nbut yeah, kinda.\n\n01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:28.440\nYeah, I mean...\n\n01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:30.440\nAll right, let's go find Patchens.\n\n01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:32.440\nOkay, so last time you saw Patchens,\n\n01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:34.440\nhe was in the town before it caught fire.\n\n01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:36.440\nAll right, let's go back to

01:59:44.440\nYeah.\n\n01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:45.440\nWhat happens?\n\n01:59:45.440 --> 01:59:46.440\nWhat are they saying?\n\n01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:47.440\nThey start pointing you out\n\n01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:49.440\nbecause you're kind of running fast\n\n01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:51.440\nand they're all very busy.\n\n01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:52.440\nBut you start to notice people\n\n01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:54.440\nwho aren't involved in firefighting\n\n01:59:54.440 --> 01:59:57.440\nstart to cluster and accumulate around you.\n\n01:59:57.440 --> 02:00:00.440\nI quietly walk backward away from him.\n\n02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:01.440\nAll right.\n\n02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:04.440\nThe only person with the rapport\n\n02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:08.440\nwith the town exits the situation.\n\n02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:10.440\nI think that's a smart move.\n\n02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:13.440\nAll right, so, yeah,\n\n02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:15.440\nit looks like people are sizing you up\n\n02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:18.440\nmaybe to attack you\n\n02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:21.440\nor to call the police or something.\n\n02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:24.440\nOh, it is in these times of trial by fire\n\n02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:26.440\nthat we must consult the silver flames\n\n02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:28.440\nteachings on the matter.\n\n02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:31.440\nFor non-silver flame\n\n02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:34.440\nis always the result of friction\n\n02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:37.440\nand friction comes from fear of fire\n\n02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:40.440\nsuch that fire will consume the earth\n\n02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:43.440\nif the silver flame is not acquiesced to.\n\n02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:45.440\nAnd what is the silver flame?\n\n02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:49.440\nBut love, acceptance, acquiescence,\n\n02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:53.440\nwater even is more silverflamey\n\n02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:55.440\nthan orangeflamey.\n\n02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:59.440\nI sneak to the back of the crowd\n\n02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:01.440\nwhile he's talking.\n\n02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:02.440\nI go,\n\n02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:05.440\nsounds like a pretty good idea.\n\n02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:08.440\nI like what he's saying.\n\n02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:11.440\nGive him a chance to talk.\n\n02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:14.440\nYou're a great distraction\n\n02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:16.440\nand everyone turns to look at you\n\n02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:18.440\nbecause you're a giant monster trying to like\n\n02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:21.440\npretend to be various nondescript people.\n\n02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:23.440\nIt doesn't mean I don't believe what...\n\n02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:25.440\nNo matter your neighbor, whoever you live near\n\n02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:29.440\nbe they bear or shambling mound\n\n02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:31.440\nor human or out of towner\n\n02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:35.440\nor mischievous darting flame wizard person.\n\n02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:37.440\nAll of us must work together.\n\n02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:39.440\nIn a war worth fighting\n\n02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:41.440\nyou will find yourselves shoulder to shoulder\n\n02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:42.440\nwith those you mistrust\n\n02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:45.440\nor else the war is no war at all.\n\n02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:47.440\nFor it is the real orange flame\n\n02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:49.440\nthat we must put out now\n\n02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:51.440\nwith love and accepting everyone\n\n02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:54.440\nabsolutely unconditionally.\n\n02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:56.440\nFire is the real enemy.\n\n02:01:56.440 --> 02:01:57.440\nFire is the real enemy.\n\n02:01:57.440 --> 02:01:58.440\nFire is the real enemy.\n\n02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:00.440\nIf something's not actively on fire\n\n02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:03.440\nit's not worth paying attention to.\n\n02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:05.440\nAt this particular time\n\n02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:08.440\nyour other conflicts will keep.\n\n02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:10.440\nYou could jump on somebody and say\n\n02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:12.440\nhey, you offended me.\n\n02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:13.440\nThat was microaggressive.\n\n02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:17.440\nAfter we beat these Nazis\n\n02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:19.440\nthere's a town on fire.\n\n02:02:19.440 --> 02:02:21.440\nWater it.\n\n02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:22.440\nWater the fire.\n\n02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:23.440\nWater it.\n\n02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:24.440\nWater it.\n\n02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:25.440\nFire.\n\n02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:26.440\nWater with water.\n\n02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:27.440\nWater.\n\n02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:28.440\nIsn't that...\n\n02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:30.440\nThat seems like the opposite of what you were saying\n\n02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:32.440\nup till that point.\n\n02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:34.440\nI may have digressed.\n\n02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:36.440\nAs Carlos was giving that speech\n\n02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:38.440\nI'm sneaking around the crowd\n\n02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:39.440\ntrying to see if I can find\n\n02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:41.440\npatches in the crowd.\n\n02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:44.440\nYou're still pretty recognizable.\n\n02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:45.440\nI'm also looking around though\n\n02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:47.440\nand everybody likes me.\n\n02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:49.440\nEveryone's loving it.\n\n02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:50.440\nTo create a distraction\n\n02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:51.440\nI go to the center of everybody\n\n02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:53.440\nI throw my shield down\n\n02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:54.440\nkick out my sword\n\n02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:55.440\nand just start doing the craziest\n\n02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:57.440\nfucking dance I could think of.\n\n02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:00.440\nThere are now five distractions.\n\n02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:03.440\nHey look at that guy dance.\n\n02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:04.440\nHow about a sixth?\n\n02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:07.440\nYou hear the pounding of hook beats on pavement\n\n02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:09.440\nthe familiar sound of a horse with a rider\n\n02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:11.440\nand on that horse\n\n02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:12.440\nyou hear a voice ring out\n\n02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:15.440\na familiar voice from a grizzled old man.\n\n02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:17.440\nThis is what happens to those\n\n02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:19.440\nwho spurn the flames light.\n\n02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:20.440\nIt's Geffen.\n\n02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:21.440\nHe's wearing brown armor\n\n02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:23.440\nand he's wheeled in a big flaming mace\n\n02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:25.440\nand he's bashing it into wooden structures\n\n02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:26.440\nand setting fires.\n\n02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:27.440\nWhat?\n\n02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:29.440\nDungeons and Dragons fans will remember\n\n02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:33.440\nGeffen from episode 241\n\n02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:36.440\nExcelsior!\n\n02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:38.440\nRefresh my memory on Geffen.\n\n02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:39.440\nHe's just a guy you know.\n\n02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:40.440\nOkay.\n\n02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:41.440\nIs he friend or foe?\n\n02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:43.440\nHe's a friend generally.\n\n02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:45.440\nHe feels like he toes the line though.\n\n02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:47.440\nOh doesn't it?\n\n02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:49.440\nWas he friends with Patchens?\n\n02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:50.440\nNo he doesn't.\n\n02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:52.440\nHe knows who Patchens is.\n\n02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:54.440\nBut anyway he's like lighting more fires\n\n02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:56.440\nand he rides his horse\n\n02:03:56.440 --> 02:03:58.440\nthrough the line of Volunteer Fireman\n\n02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:00.440\nand smashes one in the head with a flaming mace.\n\n02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:02.440\nOh Geffen why?\n\n02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:03.440\nThis is what happens to those\n\n02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:05.440\nwho spurn the flames light.\n\n02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:06.440\nAlright.\n\n02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:07.440\nAlright Geffen.\n\n02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:09.440\nDan you flash back to a moment\n\n02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:11.440\non your prior campaign of the Eldine reaches\n\n02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:13.440\nwhen you and Geffen were also\n\n02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:15.440\nlighting villages on fire.\n\n02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:18.440\nBut now you feel worse about it\n\n02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:20.440\nbecause like it seems fucked up\n\n02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:21.440\nlike in the present.\n\n02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:22.440\nGod.\n\n02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:24.440\nVietnam.\n\n02:04:27.440 -->

thing\n\n02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:33.440\nwhen you were doing it back then\n\n02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:34.440\nand now it's like you don't like\n\n02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:35.440\nthat it's

02:05:15.440\nYou know.\n\n02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:17.440\nBut I was trying to make a distinction\n\n02:05:17.440 --> 02:05:20.440\nbetween the real fire\n\n02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:22.440\nand the silver flame\n\n02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:24.440\nwhich is actually not real fire.\n\n02:05:24.440 --> 02:05:25.440\nWell it is.\n\n02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:26.440\nThe fire is very real.\n\n02:05:26.440 --> 02:05:27.440\nIt's inflanky.\n\n02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:29.440\nI know the fire is very real\n\n02:05:29.440 --> 02:05:31.440\nbut the kind that needs to be put out\n\n02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:33.440\nis not the kind that you use to put it out\n\n02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:35.440\nwhich is the flame of faith.\n\n02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:37.440\nI was trying to split a hair\n\n02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:39.440\nto get my friends from being arrested\n\n02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:44.440\nand Geffen, bad time for the geffer.\n\n02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:45.440\nYeah.\n\n02:05:47.440 -->

--> 02:06:09.440\nI call out Patchens.\n\n02:06:09.440 --> 02:06:10.440\nAll right.\n\n02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:11.440\nYou hear no response.\n\n02:06:11.440 --> 02:06:12.440\nActually maybe we did commit to it.\n\n02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:13.440\nNow I'm thinking,\n\n02:06:13.440 --> 02:06:16.440\nwhy am I trying to be a good person?\n\n02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:19.440\nI thought you said we were the good guys.\n\n02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:23.440\nMaybe that's not what this town deserves.\n\n02:06:26.440 --> 02:06:28.440\nAnd it seems like everything we do\n\n02:06:28.440 --> 02:06:30.440\nwe end up being the bad guys.\n\n02:06:30.440 --> 02:06:31.440\nOkay.\n\n02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:32.440\nI'm just starting to think\n\n02:06:32.440 --> 02:06:34.440\nI'm remembering my previous life with Geffen\n\n02:06:34.440 --> 02:06:35.440\nand I'm like,\n\n02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:38.440\noh yeah, actually we were good at one thing.\n\n02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:40.440\nBurning towns\n\n02:06:40.440 --> 02:06:42.440\nand murdering people.\n\n02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:44.440\nMaking people understand that it was God\n\n02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:46.440\nthat was doing it to them.\n\n02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:47.440\nSo we should,\n\n02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:50.440\ninstead of trying to put the fire out,\n\n02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:53.440\nwe should put the fire on.\n\n02:06:53.440 --> 02:06:54.440\nOkay.\n\n02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:55.440\nI like fire.\n\n02:06:57.440 --> 02:06:58.440\nHe said he likes it.\n\n02:06:58.440 --> 02:06:59.440\nHe doesn't say he lights it.\n\n02:06:59.440 --> 02:07:00.440\nOh yeah.\n\n02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:01.440\nYeah.\n\n02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:02.440\nYou're still looking...\n\n02:07:02.440 --> 02:07:03.440\nI know.\n\n02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:04.440\nAre you applying as a attention master?\n\n02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:06.440\nHave I had a change of heart?\n\n02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:07.440\nOr are you just saying...\n\n02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:08.440\nThat was my understanding\n\n02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:10.440\nis that you met like Steve and Geffen.\n\n02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:11.440\nRight.\n\n02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:13.440\nThis is not what the church is for.\n\n02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:14.440\nI'm the right person\n\n02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:16.440\nand I'm going to change the church from the inside.\n\n02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:17.440\nOkay.\n\n02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:18.440\nWell that's cool.\n\n02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:19.440\nThat's an arc.\n\n02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:20.440\nI hope so.\n\n02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:22.440\nThe fact that we keep doing this\n\n02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:24.440\nis fine, it's forgivable\n\n02:07:24.440 --> 02:07:26.440\nand it's actually just admirable\n\n02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:28.440\nthat I don't want to do it anymore.\n\n02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:30.440\nDid Geffen really ride off?\n\n02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:31.440\nYeah.\n\n02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:33.440\nHe seemed kind of embarrassed\n\n02:07:33.440 --> 02:07:35.440\nbut also he really enjoyed it\n\n02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:37.440\nand he looked bad in front of you\n\n02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:39.440\nby doing the wrong thing\n\n02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:40.440\nbut he thought it was the right...\n\n02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:41.440\nYou know?\n\n02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:42.440\nDoes he really respect me that much?\n\n02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:44.440\nNo, he just thought that it was killing time.\n\n02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:45.440\nOh.\n\n02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:47.440\nAnd he really bases that on me?\n\n02:07:47.440 --> 02:07:48.440\nWell he heard you preaching.\n\n02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:49.440\nHe might have heard you...\n\n02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:50.440\nHe might have heard you about as good\n\n02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:51.440\nas I was listening.\n\n02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:52.440\nHmm.\n\n02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:55.440\nWhich I apparently misinterpreted\n\n02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:56.440\nsome of your words\n\n02:07:56.440 --> 02:07:59.440\nand saw you were inciting violence.\n\n02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:01.440\nWait, but you also thought\n\n02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:04.440\nthat my arc was that I was becoming better\n\n02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:05.440\nthan I wanted to be better\n\n02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:06.440\nso then didn't you think it was odd\n\n02:08:06.440 --> 02:08:09.440\nthat I was preaching to burn the town?\n\n02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:11.440\nThat's what it seemed like\n\n02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:13.440\nbut I thought you were being a distraction.\n\n02:08:13.440 --> 02:08:14.440\nI didn't think you were earnest about it.\n\n02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:16.440\nYou were just trying to be distracting.\n\n02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:18.440\nI didn't get that you wanted to burn the town down.\n\n02:08:18.440 --> 02:08:20.440\nHe was talking about how great fire was.\n\n02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:23.440\nYou wanted to purify it with the fire of righteousness.\n\n02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:25.440\nI'm not saying that I heard him accurately.\n\n02:08:25.440 --> 02:08:26.440\nI'm saying I didn't hear him.\n\n02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:29.440\nI thought you were about to get lynched\n\n02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:32.440\nand then he was coming in to stop.\n\n02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:34.440\nYou know what real fire would do?\n\n02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:35.440\nFire would fight fire\n\n02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:37.440\nand understand that people that look like\n\n02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:39.440\nthey started the fire are probably just firefighters.\n\n02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:41.440\nSo that's what happened ten minutes ago.\n\n02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:42.440\nYeah.\n\n02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:44.440\nIt was probably fifteen minutes ago.\n\n02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:45.440\nI have a question.\n\n02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:46.440\nYeah.\n\n02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:47.440\nCan we attack something?\n\n02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:48.440\nYeah, yeah.\n\n02:08:48.440 --> 02:08:49.440\nAwesome.\n\n02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:50.440\nYou could attack the people.\n\n02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:52.440\nNo, there's no real monsters.\n\n02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:54.440\nI attacked these waffles.\n\n02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:55.440\nPatches!\n\n02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:56.440\nPatches!\n\n02:08:56.440 --> 02:08:58.440\nWhere is Patches?\n\n02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:00.440\nYeah, Patches is not around.\n\n02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:01.440\nGod damn it.\n\n02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:02.440\nHas anyone seen Patches?\n\n02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:04.440\nAre there any buildings not on fire?\n\n02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:06.440\nYeah, Shrove's house.\n\n02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:07.440\nLet's go there.\n\n02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:08.440\nLet's go check inside.\n\n02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:09.440\nYeah.\n\n02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:12.440\nThe barren shambling mound go to Shrove's house.\n\n02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:13.440\nYou go to Shrove's house.\n\n02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:14.440\nIt's empty.\n\n02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:15.440\nNo one's home.\n\n02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:16.440\nI just want to hang behind and say,\n\n02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:19.440\nmy brothers and sisters that aren't fighting the fire,\n\n02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:22.440\nI am on a quest for the Church of the Silver Flame.\n\n02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:25.440\nHas anyone seen Patches?\n\n02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:26.440\nGod.\n\n02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:28.440\nNo one's really paying too close attention to you.\n\n02:09:28.440 --> 02:09:30.440\nThey're like attending to the wounded and dead\n\n02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:31.440\nand fighting the fire.\n\n02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:34.440\nOf the many sins that people can commit\n\n02:09:34.440 --> 02:09:36.440\nagainst the Silver Flame is being distracted.\n\n02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:38.440\nOne must focus on what's important.\n\n02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:39.440\nGeffen comes back.\n\n02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:40.440\nI try to get...\n\n02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:42.440\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:45.440\nGeffen is like my Tyler Dyrton.\n\n02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:48.440\nHe shows off his...\n\n02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:51.440\nHey, Carlos, you want their attention?\n\n02:09:51.440 --> 02:09:53.440\nYou want their attention?\n\n02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:54.440\nI...\n\n02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:55.440\nYes.\n\n02:09:55.440 --> 02:09:56.440\nDo you want...\n\n02:09:56.440 --> 02:09:57.440\nYeah.\n\n02:09:57.440 --> 02:09:58.440\nNo, no, I don't...\n\n02:09:58.440 --> 02:10:00.440\nOn a human level, what are you planning to do?\n\n02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:01.440\nAre we low on time, by the way?\n\n02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:03.440\nAre we going to get kicked off stage?\n\n02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:04.440\nWe have like two minutes.\n\n02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:05.440\nOkay, sorry, everybody.\n\n02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:11.440\nThe red coats come at...\n\n02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:13.440\nYeah, no, we like doing the show.\n\n02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:16.440\nYeah, we're having a great time.\n\n02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:19.440\nYou would eventually become as bored as us, believe me.\n\n02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:20.440\nNo, we're having fun.\n\n02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:22.440\nSo Geffen's back?\n\n02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:23.440\nNo, no, that was a good joke.\n\n02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:25.440\nThat was a great joke.\n\n02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:27.440\nOkay, what are you...\n\n02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:28.440\nNo, no, no, what are you trying to...\n\n02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:30.440\nI just wanted to find out where Patchens is.\n\n02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:31.440\nYeah, me too.\n\n02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:32.440\nPatchens!\n\n02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:33.440\nBut he's not...\n\n02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:34.440\nHe's not here.\n\n02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:35.440\nI wanted to be...\n\n02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:36.440\nHe's not here.\n\n02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:37.440\nPatchens!\n\n02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:39.440\nI thought I would engage them in making a religious thing.\n\n02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:41.440\nThey're looking through Schrabb's house.\n\n02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:44.440\nWe're looking for anything that will put out fire.\n\n02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:47.440\nI'm a cleric, so I thought I would be religious\n\n02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:48.440\nand ask for Patchens.\n\n02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:49.440\nSand.\n\n02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:52.440\nBut he said that they're not going to pay attention to you\n\n02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:54.440\nbecause they're too busy putting the fire out.\n\n02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:55.440\nI found that out.\n\n02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:56.440\nDo we find anything?\n\n02:10:56.440 --> 02:10:59.440\nYou find a bag that looks like it has water symbols on it.\n\n02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:00.440\nA bag?\n\n02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:01.440\nYeah, like a sack.\n\n02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:06.440\nHey, hey, Bernie, bag with water symbols on it.\n\n02:11:06.440 --> 02:11:07.440\nWhat do you think?\n\n02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:08.440\nIt's a bag of water.\n\n02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:10.440\nOkay, let's go.\n\n02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:16.440\nI ride Bernie Mac into Back to Town,\n\n02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:19.440\nwaving this bag with water symbols on it.\n\n02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:20.440\nGo ahead.\n\n02:11:20.440 --> 02:11:25.440\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.\n\n02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:30.440\nThis is the Breeders' album.\n\n02:11:34.440 --> 02:11:35.440\nOkay, so...\n\n02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:40.440\nSo you're flailing around the bag and drops the water\n\n02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:42.440\nand water is spilling out of it.\n\n02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:44.440\nIt's like a full bucket or something.\n\n02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:45.440\nI'm going to go, wow.\n\n02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:47.440\nHey, Bernie, I'm going to start spinning it.\n\n02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:49.440\nDo you think you could run in a circle?\n\n02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:51.440\nAbsolutely.\n\n02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:53.440\nOkay, let's give it a shot.\n\n02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:55.440\nWhip it around.\n\n02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:57.440\nAround the fire.\n\n02:11:57.440 --> 02:11:59.440\nWhip it around.\n\n02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:01.440\nYou know, let's pick a building. Just one building first and try it.\n\n02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:03.440\nYou're steering, man.
