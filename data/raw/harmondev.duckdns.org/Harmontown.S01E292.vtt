WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
From the beautiful theater district in Boston, Massachusetts.

00:11.000 --> 00:26.000
One of my favorite theaters in the United States, the beautiful Wilbur Theater here.

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
I'm very, very excited to announce my favorite words of all time.

00:33.000 --> 00:41.000
Harmontown is now in session.

00:41.000 --> 00:52.000
Spencer Crittenden!

00:52.000 --> 01:03.000
Oh yeah!

01:03.000 --> 01:12.000
Let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown. Give it up for Dan Harmon.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Thank you!

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Thank you, Boston.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
My goodness.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
Wow.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Oh, and they have cabaret style seating. This is wonderful.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
What a great theater. This is really nice.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
I thought we had a one person standing ovation, but that was the cocktail waiter down there.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
It sounds like they're standing up in their hearts.

01:37.000 --> 01:46.000
That's one of the warmest receptions we've ever gotten. Thank you, Boston.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
Thank you, thank you. We haven't been in front of an audience in a while and had to come out here.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
The last three weeks in Los Angeles, we've been farting around and getting our sea legs back.

01:58.000 --> 02:10.000
This is nice. I'm probably a little nervous because I wrote you guys a song because I wanted to get on your good side.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
I have that privilege where I could just not know as a thousand people and they paid.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
What did you guys pay? Too much.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
It's a working class town. It's always too much, right?

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
Everything's too much. I got toilets to make out of porcelain.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
I didn't want to have you plunging them, nor is that a bad occupation, sir.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
I think this guy makes them.

02:37.000 --> 02:45.000
To me, it's all drudgery. I sit in a zeppelin thinking thoughts for money.

02:45.000 --> 02:52.000
Ten migrant workers then just type the thoughts for me.

02:52.000 --> 02:59.000
I love all of them more than any Republican.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
I would sell you out, America.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
If you're an unemployed welder who's been replaced by a robot, you're right.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
I'm a coastal elite. I hate you more than the people we're bringing in over the border.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
I'd love them because they pick my strawberries. I would trade you for anything.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
It's all about extremes. It's a war between whether or not we're going to just let everyone flood in

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
and eat each other alive or whether we have to have a fucking baby Schwitz.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
Baby Schwitz? Pointed.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
Hashtag baby Schwitz.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
And again, my apologies to people who, through whatever connection or whatever philosophical loyalty

03:44.000 --> 03:55.000
or actual familial connection, feel offense at the now-every-day maybe glib comparisons to third-rightishness.

03:55.000 --> 04:02.000
But I gotta say, look, I've said it before. I'll say it again.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
When it comes to comparing you to Hitler, I like to jump the gun.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
I like to get way up early.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
And I just think the worst thing that happens to you is you're a politician that got compared to Hitler too early

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
and you should learn to live with that.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
All politicians should be able to survive being compared to Hitler.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
It's not that hard a litmus test.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
Did you have a hard day, honey? Yeah, it was hard. What happened?

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
Some of the people compared me to Hitler.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
Did you act like Hitler in any perceivable way?

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
Well, my health care bill's a little draconian.

04:44.000 --> 04:52.000
Okay, but yeah, okay, they'll get over it, go to bed, sleep like a non-Hitler baby.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
I'm gonna run that flow chart through today's reality.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Have a hard day. Yeah, compare me to Hitler.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
What did you do?

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Mmm, baby schwitz.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
Baby schwitz. It sounds like a delicious beer.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
Crack into a cold baby schwitz.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
The press wants to get in.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Well, the real news or the fake news?

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Oh, the Lugan press for sure. I mean, the fake news.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
Yeah, they're trying to get in, but they won't wait the two weeks.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
I mean, why do you need two weeks to let people in to see the kids?

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
What are you doing that takes two weeks to change about your baby schwitz?

05:29.000 --> 05:38.000
It's either a room full of babies that deserve to be behind a beautiful, clean, comfortable chain link fence

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
that I'm not at all saying is inhumane, especially for criminals,

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
which everyone is that tries to get in no matter what.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
There's aboveboard ways to try to get in, and if you don't, you're a criminal.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
And so if you're a criminal and there's like a baby blanket,

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
or a little in a Buck Rogers space blanket, you're fine.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Sorry, I don't want to get political tonight.

06:00.000 --> 06:08.000
But Dan, a lot of these babies are dangerous political dissidents and intellectuals.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
We got to weed out the bad babies.

06:10.000 --> 06:16.000
So even taking it like there should be a face value thing here.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
So it's like, I understand that you need the babies locked up.

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
So now where do we get into this part where I'm like, hey, can I come take a look at them?

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
Maybe in two weeks.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
What?

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
That's cause for alarm.

06:33.000 --> 06:40.000
That's way more time than my landlord has to wait before he opens my fucking door and comes in

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
and looks at my bong and like, right?

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Like when I lived in an apartment, I was like, I could yell at the landlord

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
if he like tried to get in, and I was like, you need to wait 30 hours.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
It's the law.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Oh, it's fine, but you haven't paid your rent in six months.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Yes, so what? I got rights.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
You need to wait 30 hours.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
All right, anyways, here's my stuff.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
That was Dan's Boston song, everybody.

07:07.000 --> 07:13.000
And hey, these are turbulent times.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
And if you're having passionate feelings, and I don't even care if you're wrong.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
Like if you're passionate feelings are wrong, like, look, I know I live in a bubble.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
I'm coming out from LA.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
You people are my hosts.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
You're being gracious to me rolling out a red carpet.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
You're feeding me your food.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
You're putting me up in your hotel.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
I mean, not, yeah, you are.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
I'm sure your tax is paid for that hotel.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
I mean, I am a guest here, so I just want to thank you.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
I did not intend to go off about this thing that everyone's talking about.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
And if you are, there's a thousand people here.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
So there's probably, there are a couple of you that have like feelings

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
that I'm rubbing up against with my liberal claptrap.

07:48.000 --> 07:54.000
And I want to thank, thank you for, thank you for, thank you for zipping it.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
It's what I was going to say, let me finish.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
I was about to thank you for, shut the fuck up.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
But no, I really appreciate that.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I don't, because I don't want to start a fucking show with me.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Oh, and then someone's like,

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
Because we're just going to do what we've been doing on Twitter for six months.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Yeah.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
I want to reward your patience and your silence and your,

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
well, hopefully not your total silence,

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
but maybe your intermittent applause.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
You know what I could go for right now, Dan?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
A song?

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
Yeah, well, a song and the smooth taste of a nice cold baby Swiss.

08:26.000 --> 08:32.000
The low carb beer with a nipple on it.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Yes.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Try new baby schlitz lime.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Tuck into the room, temperature, titty.

08:39.000 --> 08:45.000
That rewards you like a good mama after a hard day in the rock yard.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Baby Swiss.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Yeah.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
Let's hear this song for God's sake.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
I have not heard this song.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
I didn't know that you composed a little, a little.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Yeah.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
And I got to do it acapella.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
If I had time, I would have,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
I would have like gotten out garage behind or something.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
It would have been a disaster.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
So it's acapella.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
I don't know.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
And I'm not really a singer or a musician, but you, you, you, you paid.

09:12.000 --> 09:20.000
And I don't do a lot of research about the cities I go to.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
I know the typewriter was invented here.

09:22.000 --> 09:38.000
Boston, Massachusetts, you sits on the Boston Bay.

09:38.000 --> 09:46.000
And the tea you tossed into it made the British go away.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Your buildings and your streets are famous.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
So is all your food.

09:53.000 --> 10:00.000
But here's what I've learned while walking from the lobby to my room.

10:00.000 --> 10:07.000
You might be alcoholics, Boston.

10:07.000 --> 10:13.000
And I don't throw that word around.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
You maybe have a problem, Boston.

10:16.000 --> 10:26.000
And that makes you my kind of town.

10:26.000 --> 10:33.000
Boston, Massachusetts, you sits on the Boston Mall.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
And you may, hey, hey, hey,

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
Be the cutest of them all.

10:42.000 --> 10:55.000
So now you're on my side for, I got you for an hour and a half.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
I could do whatever now, I could fart on a fucking shoe.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
I spent a lot of, just spent most of the afternoon today.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
I spent most of my afternoon today just hanging out by the Boston Bay.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
It was so nice out of there.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
You're going to drop by that mall too.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
The mall.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
The famous mall of Boston.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
They got Sephora, they got the baby gap.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
The birthplace of Quincy Jones.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
Quincy Jones.

11:20.000 --> 11:28.000
When he was working on Thriller with Button Gwyneth.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
I was having some pizza up at what do you call it, the North End?

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
The North End, yeah.

11:32.000 --> 11:40.000
And I was just typing in, I was there not that long ago and my girlfriend and I, we went and saw all the kind of the big touristy historical spots.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
And I just typed in, let's see what I'm around historically.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
And number three on Yelp, Skinny House.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Famous for being a skinny house, that's it.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Oh, it's not, it's not.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
No, the Paul Revere statue was number five.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Well, it's been there forever.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
What has it done for anyone lately?

12:01.000 --> 12:07.000
It's the Paul Revere statue, like spit out burgers, you know, if you, it's there to keep the red coats away.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
It's doing its job.

12:09.000 --> 12:15.000
Yeah, we take it for granted a little bit, but it's kind of a gargoyle, you know, you take a picture, you move on.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Skinny House, that sounds like important.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
I thought it was a vegan restaurant.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Skinny House.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
It should be.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
The only restaurant where you leave thinner than you came in.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
That would be Beverly Hills.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
You can't even get out.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
Yeah, if we've done our job, you won't be able to leave.

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
We're going to feed you so well that you're a fire hazard.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
But seriously, there is it now.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Obviously, my view is skewed.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
When I, my first few times I was in New York, I was working as a writer and all I saw was Times Square.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
I was staying at a hotel and I'm like telling everybody, yeah, New York's like this and it's like that.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
There's hot dogs all over the place and vomit.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Oh, no, I don't like New York.

13:01.000 --> 13:11.000
And then my friend took me and like, he's like, no, there's like, you know, you got to go below 105th and whatever the fuck people talk about there.

13:11.000 --> 13:24.000
So my view of Boston is limited to a hotel lobby, but I will say, I think, I think it's safe to say there is a broader definition of when you're supposed to call the police.

13:24.000 --> 13:35.000
Like, on a man, that is like, our show is being interrupted.

13:35.000 --> 13:54.000
Uh, it's Schrab is crawling onto the stage wearing an outfit or costume. It's hard to explain.

13:54.000 --> 14:09.000
It's hard to explain.

14:09.000 --> 14:28.000
It's hard to explain.

14:28.000 --> 14:35.000
Thank you. Thank you.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
I bet she thought I was a dog.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
I thought you were a seal. I thought you were doing like a little seal bit.

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
The sea dog of the ocean.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
The first rule of theater always make an entrance.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
Or be wait to be brought out.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
He doesn't like being, he doesn't like waiting to be brought out.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
No, he doesn't like, he's not a patient man.

15:01.000 --> 15:06.000
So before we started the show, Rob was like brainstorming stage work and stuff.

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
Like I saw him pulling various props off the wall and he was like trying to use chairs as stilts.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
It was really watching a master honing his craft.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
And to see that that resulted in the result it did, it was truly just wonderful for me.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
This, this is only, this is only the first part of it.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
Yeah. This is act one.

15:24.000 --> 15:33.000
He's got, Rob has, Rob promises more costume changes tonight than Dolly Parton.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
Oh look, they stooled with no back.

15:37.000 --> 15:42.000
You get so sad then.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Where's he going?

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
Strob, everybody.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
Our next guest.

15:52.000 --> 15:58.000
Anyways, there's, I mean, I'm just saying in the, in the, in the day that I've been in my hotel,

15:58.000 --> 16:06.000
I have seen a lot of grown men.

16:06.000 --> 16:12.000
He's going to hurt himself.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
Steve, come help.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Dan, just continue.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
He's going.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Keep going.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
He's stilting on chairs.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Keep going.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Do your thing.

16:25.000 --> 16:36.000
Do your part and I'll do my part, he says.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Get even with us.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Fifty-fifty.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Don't upstages.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Yeah.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Yeah.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Rob.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
Don't upstages.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
You've been great.

16:47.000 --> 16:52.000
Here's, here's my impression of Schrab on an airplane.

16:52.000 --> 17:02.000
You know, they say if you get on the airplane's Wi-Fi, that's how you get hacked.

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
And then here's Rob at the hotel this morning in the, in the lobby.

17:07.000 --> 17:17.000
You know, if you get on the hotel's Wi-Fi, isn't that how I get your credit card?

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Yeah.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
And I, and I'm like, yeah, Schrab, have you heard that they're cutting people's ankles

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
and the, and the grocery store parking lot?

17:25.000 --> 17:31.000
I'll forward you an email about it because I'm 70.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
See, he's a very prudent, cautious man in real life.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
He doesn't like to.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
I'm prudent, unconscious.

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
I got, I, that was just me hitting the thing by accident.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Oh.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
It's very sensitive.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
I feel like I'm rolling with a lot of punches.

17:55.000 --> 18:01.000
You're doing great.

18:01.000 --> 18:08.000
Okay, well, don't, don't, unlike other people, I don't need that.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
I don't thrive on that.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
I will earn that.

18:12.000 --> 18:19.000
Like, you don't think I was, would be doing that in my living room by myself.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
Crawling around with a wookie jacket.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
It flew you out here, man.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
I know.

18:27.000 --> 18:34.000
It was a recent show, but it was like, he found out he was coach and he, he almost had a meltdown.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
That's not true.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
Had to bump him up to first class during the show.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
When's the last time, toilet maker, when's the last time you flew first class?

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Yeah, never.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
Your boss maybe did on his way to a ceramic seminar.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
Because he said, to figure out how to gouge your labor.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
Okay, with these sitting in the back of the plane while you're up there with your...

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
No, I wouldn't feel okay.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
Because I have empathy and I treat people with respect.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
And I don't, I don't trump all over their shows.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Yes.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
You know.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Thank you.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
That's very, very nice of you.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
I open my doors to my friends.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Thank you.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
And then, and then I respect and support them.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Cool.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
And then I...

19:18.000 --> 19:26.000
So anyways, my, I was just, all I was going to say is that there's a lot of drunk people

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
here.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
I, I...

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
It's a, it's a weird thing.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
It's weird.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
It's not the amount.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
It's the age.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
It's the fact that it's like a all ages affair.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
Like guys that just look like, like a friend of my dad's.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
Like, just swaying.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
I'm like, like, like people...

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Yeah, we were out last night.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
We got into town late.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
Dan and I went for a quick, like, like, you know, like, like nightcap.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
And there was a guy.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
Oh, let's, let's put him at 57 years old.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
54?

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Maybe...

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
He looked like a prop master.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Is that a reference to...

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
No.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
You guys aren't TV show runners.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
He looked like a prop master.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Yeah.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Yeah.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
He looked like a, like a, like a vice principal of something.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
And, uh...

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
I put him more below the line.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Yeah.

20:12.000 --> 20:18.000
But he, he came out of the bathroom and he was, like, completely, like, using all the

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
surfaces to not fall down.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Like...

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Like a xenomorph.

20:22.000 --> 20:27.000
But he had this, he had this incredible, like, if I, if I was that drunk, I'd go,

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
oh fuck, I gotta make it all the way out, out there through a very narrow corridor of

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
bar stools and people moving and people serving drinks.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
I would, I would get on my knees and say, take me to jail.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
But this is not good, this is not good podcasting.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
This is the, he was so excited about it.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
This is what separates Boston from Drunks that I see in Los Angeles.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
This is the look on the guy's face as he was barely making it.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
He was going...

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Yeah.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Very happy about it.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
It's a, it's a friendly town.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
I think, I think that's the key.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
Cause I was gonna say, in New York in LA, like, I've been, in both, in New York in LA, I've

21:03.000 --> 21:10.000
been with drunk people all the way up to Andy Dick levels of, of, of actual Andy Dick.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
And like, there's that, but even if you're not Andy Dick and you're famous and you have

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
this like, like tag in your heads, like, like New York bouncers will be like, they'll,

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
it's very impressive the way that they'll, like, even a guy who's like a functional

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
alcoholic, but you can, he's in that dark pocket of the night.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
Like, and he's just like, he's, he's pulling it off with his friends, but the

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
bouncer will be like, nope.

21:32.000 --> 21:38.000
Like, he's like, and I was like, I have a bartender go, go like, uh-uh, not you.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
You, you won't look me in the eye.

21:40.000 --> 21:46.000
Like it's very empathic and like, like, sentimental kind of like, like, like hierarchy there.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
It's like, like, like, like, but, but, but I do think that, I mean, here there's like a

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
support of the, which I guess reminds me of Milwaukee.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
It's like, it's like, like, like that guy, that guy had a smile on his face cause he

21:57.000 --> 22:02.000
wasn't ashamed of what was happening to him because, because the bartender was probably

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
after we left was probably like, Kevin, you want another one?

22:06.000 --> 22:13.000
You know, she probably put out a rope ladder for him to get to the bar and he, and, and,

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
and, and he said, am I on a helicopter?

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
She probably said, you can be Kevin, you can be.

22:18.000 --> 22:23.000
If you just dream had enough.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
You were waiting for me to.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Oh shit.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
You were waiting for me to do the.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
It's gonna be that easy.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
The master of accents.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
You've heard my Australian tour.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
I am a man of a thousand dialects.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
What's, what do you?

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
They're liking that hat mate.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
They're liking that happen.

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
Say that you like the hat, that hat mate, but in a, in a full hardcore Southie Boston.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
You like that hat.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Yeah.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
I don't know.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
I don't know.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
I don't know.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
I just know that ours go away.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
I don't know anything.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
But I do know my friend Dave Horowitz, I think he lived here for a while and he said at this

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
very theater, there was a blue man group show and there was a commercial for it on TV in

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
the nineties that he told me about.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
He's like, oh, you're going to Boston.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
You know, every time I think of Boston, I think of this hilarious commercial for the

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
blue man group at the Wilbur theater in the nineties.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
And it was a, you know, blue man group.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
And there was one of those things where they do the theatrical testimonials like the audience

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
people are like, like the every man Joe is like, like, like come see the show.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
And it was great.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
And I'm trying to find the quote.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
He told me, uh, fuck God.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Dammit.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Harmon.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
Other people in the sky.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
There's two balconies.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
Rob.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Rob.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Rob.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
That's called a balcony.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Oh, okay.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Sorry.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
So it's just, it is, he's, there's just this guy with like a baseball hat on and he, any,

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
uh, okay, we're all going to die.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
Uh, the, the, the, it's for blue man group.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
They're like, blue man group, come see the show.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
They're critics are raving.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Oh, the blue man groups at the Wilbur theater.

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
And then there's just this guy in the lobby of the Wilbur doing one of those testimonials

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
and he goes like, he goes, hell of a ride.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Pack your bags.

24:02.000 --> 24:11.000
It was like Greg, Greg groups is all joking.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
He goes, all the thing in Boston.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Like I, you try to flirt.

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
Every girl you talk to is like flirting with Cliff Clavin.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Yeah.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
I mean, I got pulled over in Delaware once by a cop.

24:21.000 --> 24:26.000
And I could, it was my first time talking to anyone from that region at all.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
And I was, so I was going through this horrible experience.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
Cause I was like, I felt like the other man's coming down on me.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
And it's like, but also he's like, it sounds like a cartoon.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
He was like, you don't have an insurance card.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
And I was like, come on, this is silly.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
Like you, you can't have a gun.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
You sound like a, you sound like a TV show.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
But then people where I'm from, if you tell them how I talk where we come from,

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
people go like, no, that's Fargo.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
That's not real.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
I'm like, that is real.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
We talk like that in Milwaukee.

24:52.000 --> 24:58.000
I have just dropped to that accent in support of a professional career.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
I no longer speak like a Philistine.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
I talk like Tom Brokaw all the time.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
I have no nasal twang.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
I lost the song.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
Luster, you guys are losing faith in me.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
No, we're not Dan.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
We love you.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Okay.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Okay.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Here's the thing.

25:20.000 --> 25:25.000
I'm like, what are you, Tony Danza?

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
What are you doing?

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
I'm sorry.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
You want me to be uncomfortable?

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Okay.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
I don't know.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Would you rather I'd be uncomfortable?

25:33.000 --> 25:40.000
Because it's your show.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Schrab pointed at the Harmontown.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Basically it's a table.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
Schrab, what was the, we took a long, a car ride from...

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
Okay.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
This is something.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
I don't know.

25:51.000 --> 25:58.000
The whole ride from Dan's place to LAX takes about, let's call it 40 minutes.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
It was like an hour.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
40 minutes to an hour.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
That's fair.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
That's very fair.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
And I had something to get off my chest.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
Do you guys have movie posters here?

26:11.000 --> 26:18.000
Like, not just movie posters, like coming this summer, but like, like, like, like bus

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
stop signs that have movie posters and stuff like that.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Okay.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
Okay.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
So you know what a movie poster is, then?

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
Now we can get, now we can start my thing.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Okay.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.280
I don't know if you guys heard about this, but a couple of months ago, and I think it's

26:36.280 --> 26:44.000
still in theaters, there was this movie called Peter Rabbit, and it's about a, yeah.

26:44.000 --> 26:52.400
And it's about a, it's a movie with a bunch of computer-generated rabbits in it, one

26:52.400 --> 26:54.000
of them named Peuner.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
I know it's about time.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.800
Now I haven't seen this movie, I'm sure it's fine, and I'm sure the people worked really

27:02.800 --> 27:06.000
hard on it.

27:06.000 --> 27:12.000
But the advertisers, there's a poster that says, and I go through this every time one

27:12.000 --> 27:18.000
of these movies comes out, it says, there's a picture of Peter Rabbit, no pants, shirt,

27:18.000 --> 27:26.000
going like this, in front of a blue void, and then it says, in big blocky letters, better

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
eight than never.

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
A-T-E, better eight than never.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
Right.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
What the fuck does that mean?

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
What the fuck does that mean?

27:42.000 --> 27:48.000
Is this, is this a sequel to a movie that he ate something in?

27:48.000 --> 27:54.000
Is this, is this something that we've been waiting for, the Peter Rabbit movie?

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
They're like, Paddington 2, where's Peter Rabbit?

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
God damn it, better eight than never.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
Good, wait a minute, why eight?

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
Well, because he'd also have to be like Peter Stumick or something, you know, like Peter,

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
Peter Eater, you know, like better, better eight than never.

28:11.000 --> 28:16.000
But he's got no pants on and he's jumping like this, his stomach is flat, his washboard,

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
I, and, is he holding a carrot level?

28:20.000 --> 28:27.000
No, no, not no carrot, no stump carrots, no, nothing, not a pile of carrots, not a full,

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
no, no, better eight than never.

28:30.000 --> 28:36.000
This happens all the time, remember the fucking Peabody movie, the dog movie?

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
Oh, yeah.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
Sherman and Peabody movie, the tagline for that was, anybody?

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Come on, you know this.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
The dog, the dog father of all comedies.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Right.

28:50.000 --> 28:56.000
Sherman and Peabody, it's about a talking dog who gets a pet boy who travels in time,

28:56.000 --> 29:07.000
not to mob times, dinosaurs, Abe Lincoln, Napoleon, not to mob times, mob times,

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
and it's the dog father of all comedies.

29:10.000 --> 29:15.000
You know that thing when we go, well, you know, it's the mother of all comedies,

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
and then it's the, you know, the sisterhood of all comedies,

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
but the dog father of all comedies, the godfather of all comedies.

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
And we all know that there's the father of all comedies, that's a very common thing to say.

29:26.000 --> 29:33.000
But I guess, I guess dog and god rhyme, no, they don't.

29:33.000 --> 29:39.000
The dog father of all comedies, better eight than never.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
Look for it, it'll piss you off.

29:42.000 --> 29:49.000
You'll be driving down the street and you'll go, rabbit, ate, I guess all animals eat,

29:49.000 --> 29:54.000
and this one must have ate something and he's happy about it

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
and I should go see this movie because of why.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Because it's better than never.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
Never can come and soon enough.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
Because that's when I'm going to see your movie.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Jesus, come on.

30:11.000 --> 30:22.000
Better eight than never. Get the fuck out of here with that.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
Get the fuck out of here with that.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
I got to pick the kids up.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
It's going to be, I mean, like the 405 is a parking lot.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Why don't we just, better eight than never.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Okay, send it. Put it out.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
I got to get home.

30:36.000 --> 30:42.000
I got to get home. The fucking water jug guy is delivering today.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
If I don't open the door.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
Sir, you're the head of a studio. We need you to sign on.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Nobody's watching. Nobody cares.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
They're just driving by. They see rabbit.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
They see a bunch of words.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Maybe I'll see it.

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
All of those posters should just say custody weekend is coming.

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
They should just say, drop your kids off.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
They'll be relatively safe for two hours.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Probably not.

31:08.000 --> 31:15.000
When did, when did, when was rhyming such an important part of movie taglines?

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
I mean, long, long ago in a galaxy far, far away.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Doesn't rhyme with anything.

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
You know, 26 million years in the making.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
You will believe a man can fly.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Right, right.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
Superman.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
In space, no one can hear you scream.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
No rhyming involved.

31:28.000 --> 31:35.000
Everything is like, better up than pop.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
Yeah, you're right.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
You're right.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
Levy, Levy, what was the yogi bear one?

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
Oh, yeah.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Do you remember the yogi bear?

31:44.000 --> 31:51.000
Great things come in bears.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
That's a, that's a very Boston.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
Which?

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
I can see why that, that captures your heart.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
It feels like a very, very high, like them apples.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
But that sounds like, well, first of all.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
That sounds like a gay porn tagline.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
That's why they like it.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
They're like, yeah, great things come in bears.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
Yeah.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
Hey, come on.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
This is retarded.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
This is from Boston.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
This is from Mark Wahlberg.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Retarded, man.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
This is retarded.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
I'm coming in your bag.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Wicked piss ass.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Fucking your bag.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
He's fucking a chair.

32:26.000 --> 32:32.000
Great things come in bears.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
I hope it's another bear.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
I hope it's a great bear.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
I think it's Mark Wahlberg.

32:38.000 --> 32:42.000
I think he's, that's, that's why he talks to animals so much.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
He's, he's grooming them.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
That's why he bought a zoo.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Did he, did he buy a zoo?

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
That's why he bought it.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
That's Matt Damon.

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
I don't get those guys mixed up.

32:55.000 --> 32:59.000
Yeah, I'm going to accept that groan.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
I might have gone over the line.

33:01.000 --> 33:07.000
I might have accidentally asked you to trivialize pedophilia in your mind.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
That's good to find your boundaries, Boston.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
Certainly didn't find them in the elevator.

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
Like guys that look like they should be a senator just fucking swaying

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
and breathing out of their ears.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
They're drunk and they're like, like,

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
clapping their hands randomly.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
I mean, they're probably from out of town, but you're, you're...

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
I got an elevator.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
You laid out that carpet for them.

33:31.000 --> 33:36.000
We're staying at a nice hotel and we, I stupidly chose to stay way up top.

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
Like I'm on the top floor, but it's a big convention in town.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
It's like a big car thing.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
So it's a lot of like fast and furious looking dudes.

33:43.000 --> 33:47.000
Like a lot of big, a lot of giant, like very tanned biceps

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
and a lot of big fake titties.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
And so I get to stop at every stop on the way down.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
And it's just a lot of cologne.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
It's a potpourri of muscles and perfumes.

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
And everybody's lovely and nice and like, no one was a jerk at everything.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
But just one guy gets in and he's just, you know, he's like probably my age,

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
but because of all the tanning, he looks a little older and he's really big and buff.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
And he stands, he does the thing where he doesn't turn around and face the door.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
He just, because we're rammed in there.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
So he's got us back to the door.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
He's like, everyone knows no one talks in elevators?

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
Oh boy.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
Anybody got me coke? I'm the guy.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
Oh, there's a kid. Hey kid, you like to do coconut?

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
I don't like that guy. I don't like that guy.

34:24.000 --> 34:29.000
The guy that gets on the bus or the tram or the, you know,

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
and it's just like, what is this? The fossil flyer?

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Come on. Put a smile on your face.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
Like, wait, come on, we're not, we're not sitting here in silence

34:36.000 --> 34:41.000
because we lack the fucking aptitude to be jocular.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
We're just, we're in mass transit.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
We're having a bad day. We're minding our own business.

34:46.000 --> 34:51.000
Like, you know, people eat people on these things.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
We want, we're prepared for that. How's that sound?

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
We weren't prepared for your open mic.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
And then the door opened and there wasn't really room for three people,

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
but three people were waiting to get on like halfway down.

35:02.000 --> 35:07.000
And he goes, he goes, I can't do the accent because you're cute.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
You get on and we'll kick some of the ugly guys off.

35:09.000 --> 35:13.000
Every floor had a new routine. It was, it was, it was disappointing.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
It was anybody like going, well, they have to.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
That's the thing is that people nervous laugh

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
and then they take the nervous laugh and they don't,

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
they don't, something in their brain doesn't tell nervous laughter

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
from fucking real laughter. They're like, I'm killing over here.

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
Oh, I'm not, like, we got them in LA.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
We got them in Burbank. We got them in, we got them in Detroit.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
We got them in Detroit.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Me and Logan.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
Living in America.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
What is the Huey Lewis song?

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
Well, is Boston mentioned in the Huey Lewis song, the Hard Rock and Roll?

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
Hard Rock and Roll.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Or is it, or is it, because when I was, when I was,

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
I think it is.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
My local radio station sent a version of that song

35:52.000 --> 35:57.000
and then he would like, I think Huey Lewis like said all 70,000 American cities

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
and then they would put it in.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
So it was like during the like the extended dance mix.

36:02.000 --> 36:06.000
You guys are too young to be, have been alive at a time when there was radio,

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
let alone when radio was so unaccountable.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
Huey Lewis 10-minute mixes were being played.

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
Huey Lewis at one point roamed the earth as a god.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
And there was just not enough Huey Lewis to still,

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
they would stretch what they had out into power mixes

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
while you were driving to work at your sundial plant

36:25.000 --> 36:30.000
and to prepare your Brancho Burgers.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
And so, and then they would just have random snippets of Huey Lewis going,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Milwaukee!

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
Because you lived in Milwaukee and I'm assuming that he, that he, somewhere else,

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
he's like...

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
He probably wouldn't hear it.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Medford!

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
Lapute!

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Yeah.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
Ah.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
Valencia!

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Harder rock and roll.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
Um, oh, so anyways, oh, kudos.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
You guys, come on.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
You're vending machines.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
Is the pay range thing catching on?

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
Pay range?

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Have you heard of this?

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
She's, she's...

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
One person.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
That's awesome.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
I'm gonna fucking weep.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
I was so sad last night because I'm in a hotel.

37:10.000 --> 37:14.000
The food, the room service is in the past 11, which I don't understand.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Like, if I'm, if I'm in a, why would you,

37:16.000 --> 37:21.000
why would you stop having people make food for people in a hotel after 11

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
when, if I wanted food before 11, I wouldn't eat at a hotel.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
I don't know, that doesn't make any sense.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
Like, why are you, what do you think room service is for?

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
I'm drunk, I'm dangerous.

37:32.000 --> 37:39.000
Like, like, quell me or face the fucking urban legends that will befall you.

37:39.000 --> 37:43.000
I, I, I, I have a sea of accountants and lawyers.

37:43.000 --> 37:47.000
I can do anything I want to this weird hipster colonial art.

37:47.000 --> 37:52.000
Um, I could, I could just fold this up and put it in my duffel bag.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
I like Paul Revere.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
I'm gonna play it.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
I've, I've done, I've broken shit lately.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
I'm entering a dark chapter of my life.

38:00.000 --> 38:06.000
I, I, I've just unscrewed weird urban art fixtures and just like dropped them and

38:06.000 --> 38:10.000
I've, I've gotten very good at putting, at putting together like Legos,

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
the remote control because the remote controls never work at some point.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
I just throw it out the wall and they go, I'm gonna put that back together now.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Yeah, it usually works.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
You know people take, sorry, you know people take remote controls traveling

38:21.000 --> 38:25.000
because it's more, it's easier for them than like using the fucking hotel remotes.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Oh yeah, like really, that's brilliant.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
That's like next level.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
That's fucked up.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
I love you too.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
That's nice.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
Anyways.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
Thank you sir.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
I got on off a little digression there but uh, the key is fill me with chili

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
and you won't have a problem but, but the.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
That's the key.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
But so I was very sad.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
There's other problems.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
I got back to the hotel at like 11, 10 or something.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
There's no room service.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
There's nothing you can do.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
There's nothing.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
So I got, oh god.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
Are there vending machines?

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
I don't know.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
I call the front desk guest services.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
I'm like, why, why is there a guest services?

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Have that guy make sandwiches.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
I, I, what, what else is his job?

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
There's nothing else available.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
He just has to keep answering and saying, we can't do anything.

39:00.000 --> 39:04.000
That's like, make sandwiches.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
Just bad ones even.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
Just be like, look, I was like, we've all crashed at friends houses.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
We don't expect royal treatment.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
It's just like we're drunk.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
We're hungry.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
So, but, but anyways, I didn't.

39:13.000 --> 39:18.000
I'm sorry to bug you with this, but are there, are there vending machines?

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
I don't know.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
He's like, well, there should be one right on your floor.

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
If you, if you go right towards the window and I go, okay, thank you.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
Vending machines.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
I need to find my role of cash.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
Here we go.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
The vending machine trip.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
Am I right kids?

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
Dollar by dollar with the, oh, face it this way.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
And oh, it's spitting back out.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
You don't know what, like, what is it?

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
What does it want from us?

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Like what, what, this one's crisp.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
This one's got bubble gum on it.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
You like that one?

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Oh, the corner can't be folded.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
The corner has to be folded.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
The, the, the White House should be showing.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
That's not the White House.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
It's the Lincoln place.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
I know my shit.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
It's the Lincoln Bay.

40:00.000 --> 40:06.000
I don't come to Boston Harbor without the Boston mall without, without, anyways.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
So, so I go up to the thing and I'm like, oh, here we go again.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
There's a little sticker on the thing with a little QR code.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
It says, hey, get the app.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
I fucking pull out my phone.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
What?

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
I point the camera at the QR code.

40:18.000 --> 40:24.000
A little link comes down and goes, you want to go and get this app?

40:24.000 --> 40:29.000
I go to the app store because there's the app they were talking about.

40:29.000 --> 40:34.000
App goes, what's up?

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
You want to download me?

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
And they're like, look, we don't want anything from you.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
They're like, thanks for signing up.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
Give us your email.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
We're going to shoot you an email.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
You confirm you want to join our club, whatever.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
You can give us a fake email if you want.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
Don't give us a fake email.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
Here's $2.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
$2 in the vending machine.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
I got a free bag of fucking popcorn.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
$1.25.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
I ran to my room.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
I looked around.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
I went back to my room.

40:59.000 --> 41:04.000
I'm eating a free bag of popcorn from a vending machine because I downloaded an app.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Homeless people don't have a chance.

41:06.000 --> 41:12.000
They're never going to catch up to our Logan's Run Society.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
There's people out on the street going, can I please have a quarter?

41:15.000 --> 41:19.000
We're like, quarters don't exist.

41:19.000 --> 41:25.000
Popcorn is now exchanged on a currency of ideals.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
Thank you for your interest in our institution.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
Here's your popcorn.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
I didn't even do anything.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
I didn't make a toilet for that money, even indirectly.

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
Even the toilet making that I do in Hollywood called Monster House.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
None of that went into this thing.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
I did nothing.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
I was just a dude with a phone.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
So I got popcorn for being a dude with a phone.

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
I went back and then I'm like, these people need all my money.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
Whatever they're working on that needs to spread and it needs to be how all of society works.

41:54.000 --> 41:59.000
So I did go through the maybe 40 to 80 minute process of getting my credit card in there.

41:59.000 --> 42:04.000
But it's an app for vending machines.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
It makes you like the Tarzan of vending machines.

42:07.000 --> 42:11.000
When you're near a vending machine that has this thing in it,

42:11.000 --> 42:16.000
the vending machines, if you turn on your notifications, it's consensual.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
You can choose to not do it.

42:18.000 --> 42:27.000
The vending machines will vibrate your pocket and go, I know you like Twizzlers.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
You've bought a lot of them.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
We're trying to get rid of some over here.

42:32.000 --> 42:36.000
We being a box of food that normally you can only,

42:36.000 --> 42:40.000
that you love and you look inside and you see all these fun things behind these robot arms

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
and you're like, but the filthy dollar thing that turns you off.

42:44.000 --> 42:50.000
I don't want to engage in this gross fucking capitalist sex thing

42:50.000 --> 42:55.000
with this herpy fucking handshake that you do with these robots.

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
Give me your dirty fucking hepatitis money and I'll give you some back

42:59.000 --> 43:04.000
in a fucking bubblegum laden pit and you fucking bite it.

43:04.000 --> 43:08.000
Everything's filthy and disgusting and nothing works.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
They've eliminated it.

43:10.000 --> 43:15.000
It goes, hey, you like Diet Coke, two for one, bro, get over here.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
You say, you're like, I gotta go.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Where are you going?

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Something.

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
And you go to the thing and you don't do anything.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
It's like, here you are $25 on your credit.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
It's like lights up.

43:28.000 --> 43:32.000
If you've never seen that little LED thing on a vending machine,

43:32.000 --> 43:37.000
say credit $25.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
It's like you won life.

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
And then you're just like fucking salted nut rolls.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Boom.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Peanut butter crackers.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
I give a fuck now.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
I don't usually get those.

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
I mean, they look gross and dry and orange, but why not?

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
There's nothing.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
And I just like, and you don't have to like load up

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
because you can come back.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
It's yours.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
You own the vending machine now.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
That isn't your property.

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
You just walk the fuck away. There's no change.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
There's nothing.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
Isn't this how like they get your credit card number?

44:13.000 --> 44:23.000
It's great.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
I don't know what.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
I called back.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
If this was a comedy album, that would be a great,

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
it would be like, OK, then there'd be a little bit of silence.

44:31.000 --> 44:34.000
And then my next bit would be like, diapers are hard to buy.

44:34.000 --> 44:39.000
I don't have kids, but I wish they were easier to buy.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
So now you, do you still have credit on?

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Is this just that one particular jukebox?

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
A jukebox.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
Because we have the jukebox app too.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
But is this vending machines all around the world now

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
that you can do this?

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
No, it's like, it's like everything's,

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
everything's being amplified.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
So it's like, like, it's like, it's like this,

44:57.000 --> 45:02.000
this thing uses other apps and banks and things to like,

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
like, it interfaces with Apple Pay,

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
or MasterCard has a thing that's like Apple Pay,

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
or there's like all these services where you can take a credit card,

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
it's basically like PayPal, you can like put,

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
you can put some of your money in a reservoir.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
But it's your money, it's just that the vending machine now knows

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
you're good for it.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
You're a fish, you're a whale.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Oh, shit, Harmon's in town.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
The moment you walk down Cheetos, like a fucking,

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
this guy moves Cheetos, we've been trying to move Cheetos.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
I'm telling you, they have discounts.

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
Think of all the times that you've bought stuff out of a vending machine,

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
what if you were, what if you were recognized for that by vending machines?

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
What if all of them respected you for that?

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
You would be famous, like vending machine famous?

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
Who vending machines?

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
Yes, that you would like walk by them and they go, hey,

45:49.000 --> 45:54.000
like, hey Tony, like, do you want, do you want a payday?

45:54.000 --> 45:58.000
We don't have salted gut rolls, but I know you like peanuts and nougat,

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
and you just go like, maybe later.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
And they're like, fine, like, we don't care,

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
but like, we'd love for you to have what we have,

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
and just feel, I cried, I cried all night.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
I was a little drunk, but I just, I really had an emotional reaction.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
I was like, weeping to my girlfriend.

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
I was like, this is, I have a sea of text messages,

46:16.000 --> 46:20.000
like, and she's going, okay, I'm glad you're happy.

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
But I didn't punch a wall, and I didn't break any light bulbs,

46:24.000 --> 46:29.000
and I didn't get on Twitter and like yell at a 15 year old kid

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
until he hung himself.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
Because you were descending into a diabetic coma.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Yeah.

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
How many items do you reckon you had last night?

46:38.000 --> 46:41.000
That's the other things, because I didn't have to look up.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
How many? How many?

46:43.000 --> 46:47.000
I had a bag of Cheetos, I had a bag of free popcorn,

46:47.000 --> 46:51.000
which doesn't count, and then the aforementioned,

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
like glow-in-the-dark orange peanut butter crackers.

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
Just as an experimentation, which I am now free to do,

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
because I'm a vending machine lord, I can now,

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
this is good for everybody, this is churn.

47:03.000 --> 47:08.000
Like, I'm now going to be a more open-minded Vendee.

47:08.000 --> 47:12.000
Vendetta?

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
What a lot of people don't know, and Dan would be embarrassed if I mentioned it.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
I looked up my hotel window last night, about 1 a.m.,

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
there was Dan standing in the corner of Charles and Stuart

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
just handing food out to the homeless all night long.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Just hear some Cheetos.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Very giving.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Wait, I don't know where he's going with that.

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
Did you guys have a hard time sleeping last night?

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Because we're on L.A. time?

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
Yeah.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
You had a hard time sleeping?

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Oh, yeah, so hard.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
What'd you do? Would you do anything?

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
I yelled at people online.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Okay.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
What's the beef?

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
Let's skip it.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
What's your beef?

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
I forced myself to stay up until like 3 a.m.,

47:55.000 --> 47:59.000
just helping places I wanted to eat at when I got up.

47:59.000 --> 48:05.000
I didn't have to force myself because there were two ladies

48:05.000 --> 48:10.000
upstairs on the balcony talking all night long.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
Wait, can you, let me, I can't believe I'm doing this.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
Do you mind if I disrupt you for a second?

48:16.000 --> 48:21.000
I can't even, I can't even believe myself.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
Why do I, but I just want to put the wheels in motion

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
because I have a friend here that I want to,

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
I want to introduce people to.

48:28.000 --> 48:32.000
Erin, if you want to start making your clumsy way,

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
whatever circuitous path you can.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Erin McGathy, everybody.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
It's a lie, it's a lie, it's a trick.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Sorry, sorry, we're sorry.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
I fell for it myself.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
What a weird lie.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Obviously everyone would believe that.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Oh, his ex-wife is here.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
We miss her.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
That was an awful joke.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
I felt, I felt.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
It was great for everybody but you.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
What's that?

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
What?

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
Help?

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
Oh, wait, someone needs help.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Hey, can we get someone, is there someone,

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
someone needs help, call 911 or something?

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
Is he hurt?

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
He needs help, he needs medical help.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
Oh, shit.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
Can we get a, a doctor?

49:13.000 --> 49:16.000
Can we, can we get an ambulance here?

49:16.000 --> 49:19.000
Do we have any medical team out here?

49:19.000 --> 49:24.000
Was he choking?

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
All right.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
Does he need water?

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
Oh, no, it's okay.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
You did, you did absolutely the right thing.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
Thank you for.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
Yeah.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
It sounds like he's getting faint.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
All right, awesome.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
Organum some air.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Okay, great.

49:37.000 --> 49:43.000
Yeah.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Thanks for pulling together.

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
Everybody would appreciate it.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Look what you're doing.

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
You're killing people.

49:51.000 --> 49:59.000
I'm so sorry.

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
Your vending machine gave him the vapors.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
He probably got excited.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
We're not going to make jokes about what happens.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
That's not the joke area for us right now.

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
We're going to wait, we're going to wait until tomorrow

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
and we can make all the jokes we want.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
Dance.

50:15.000 --> 50:18.000
But anyways, no, anyway, that, that, that, yeah,

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
air is airing.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
Is that him?

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
Oh.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
Oh, hey.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
Let's introduce him.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
Have a stool.

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
Have a stool.

50:25.000 --> 50:33.000
Have you guys ever heard of the podcast lore?

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Oh, awesome.

50:35.000 --> 50:42.000
This is Aaron Mankey, everybody.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
Hi.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Thanks for, thanks for, thank you.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
I'm such a big fan.

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
You don't know who I am, but I'm a big fan.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
I love this shit.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Holy shit.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
Yeah.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
For those who don't know, lore is a very popular podcast.

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
It's, you know, Aaron's kind of a self starter and it's like,

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
it's lore.

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
It's like, which I would describe as the crossroads between

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
legend and historical fact.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
Right.

51:06.000 --> 51:10.000
Like, like, it's like, oh, for every, for every vampire that

51:10.000 --> 51:14.000
we hear exists, there's like a reason why we heard vampires

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
exist, which goes back to some actual historical thing.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
And that's what lore is.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
Right.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
That's a pretty good description.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
Yeah.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
Yeah.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
So I discuss football and politics.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
Yeah.

51:26.000 --> 51:30.000
But, but, you know, and I think, I think particularly like I would

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
say the real reason for the success is that you take it very

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
seriously.

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
You're a good researcher and you're a good, you're a good performer

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
too.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
Like you, you're reading your own stuff.

51:39.000 --> 51:44.000
You kind of, you kind of, to me, you embody why podcasting is

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
better than other media at its best.

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
It's because there's an authenticity in addition to the

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
professionalism.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
You're not just a mannequin that was like, that would be hot.

51:55.000 --> 51:59.000
But that was, that was like, that was carved out by the

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
system's needs.

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
So it's like, oh, he's really good at making people believe him.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
So he's cast behind this desk.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
And then these people that are good at writing things and these

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
people are good at shooting things.

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
You're a one man team that like you're interested in this stuff.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
And then you, you are who you are and your personality like exudes

52:14.000 --> 52:18.000
so we can trust you and listen to you talk about Loch Ness and

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
vampires and werewolves and magic beans.

52:22.000 --> 52:27.000
And they're the magic fruit.

52:27.000 --> 52:32.000
We made friends online because I, because I tweeted that after

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
listening to your podcast a lot and I'm going to have Aaron like

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
read you so that people aren't familiar with him.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
I'm going to have him do a cold read of one of his lore

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
intros.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
Openings.

52:41.000 --> 52:47.000
Which I just feel I have a certain style to them.

52:47.000 --> 52:52.000
And to the point where I like, I tweeted that after I make love

52:52.000 --> 53:00.000
to Cody, I like to just finish by saying, I'm Aaron Mankey.

53:00.000 --> 53:05.000
And let me say Cody has confirmed this is true.

53:05.000 --> 53:09.000
And then you tweeted back and we're like clearly unafended by it

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
and we became fast friends.

53:11.000 --> 53:16.000
We met up for drinks and we like each other's jibs.

53:16.000 --> 53:23.000
But yeah, I mean, yeah, I'm not good at anything.

53:23.000 --> 53:27.000
But do you want to, let's just give him a taste of, this is Aaron

53:27.000 --> 53:31.000
doing a live cold read of kind of like what he does at the top of

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
each of his episodes.

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
You've got one pulled up.

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
That's the text.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
And Jeff, you've got some of the music.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
I've got some of your music here.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
Yeah.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
Make sure to eat that mic, brother.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Yeah, get the mic right at close.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
This is Boston.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
They don't fucking.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Do you want me to start?

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
Can I get a lapel mic, please?

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
And a suit jacket?

53:48.000 --> 53:51.000
And a glass of, I'm going to live it 20 years.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
Chablis.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
Yes.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Do you want the music to begin?

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
Please.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
Okay, here we go.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
Yeah.

53:58.000 --> 54:15.000
On June 24th, 1408, a French court sentenced a murderer to death

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
by execution.

54:16.000 --> 54:20.000
She had entered the home of a neighbor and found a four month old

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
child inside alone and unattended.

54:23.000 --> 54:27.000
Although she never disclosed her reason for doing so.

54:27.000 --> 54:31.000
She killed the child right there in the house.

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
After her trial, she was moved to the prison to be held until her

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
execution.

54:35.000 --> 54:39.000
The others who were in prison there most certainly jeered at her.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
They called her names.

54:41.000 --> 54:45.000
Yes, they were hardened criminals, but to kill a child, even they were

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
appalled.

54:46.000 --> 54:51.000
The prison, however, treated her with the same as the same as those

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
men charged.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
Charged her family the same daily rate for her meals.

54:56.000 --> 55:00.000
The quality was a rare thing for her, you see.

55:00.000 --> 55:05.000
On July 17th, she was guided to the platform and a rope was placed

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
around her neck.

55:06.000 --> 55:10.000
A crowd was most likely gathered that day to watch the spectacle.

55:10.000 --> 55:14.000
Like the criminals inside the prison, they too had mocked her and

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
shouted insults.

55:15.000 --> 55:20.000
And then after the trapdoor snapped open, she plummeted to her

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
death.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
It was over.

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
History is full of these stories.

55:26.000 --> 55:30.000
A criminal goes to trial and justice wins the day.

55:30.000 --> 55:35.000
What was odd about that trial in 1408, though, was the suspect,

55:35.000 --> 55:39.000
because she wasn't a local woman or even a relative of the child she

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
killed.

55:40.000 --> 55:43.000
She wasn't even human, you see.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
She was a pig.

55:45.000 --> 55:51.000
Literally, a farm animal tried in the court of law and sentenced to be

55:51.000 --> 56:03.000
shot to death and then executed on the gallows three weeks later.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Say it.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Say it.

56:07.000 --> 56:29.000
Better eight than never.

56:29.000 --> 56:33.000
During the long history of criminal trials, spanning cultures and

56:33.000 --> 56:37.000
histories, all manner of oddities have entered the courtroom.

56:37.000 --> 56:41.000
As unusual as it might sound to put livestock on trial, humans have

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
been guilty of worse.

56:43.000 --> 56:49.000
You see, sometimes even the dead get to testify.

56:49.000 --> 57:04.000
I'm Aaron Mankey, and this is Harmontown.

57:04.000 --> 57:09.000
It's the podcasting equivalent of having, like, skrillex up here.

57:09.000 --> 57:12.000
He's like, wow, he really does just do it that way.

57:12.000 --> 57:17.000
I thought you'd be like, well, I need 70 takes.

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
Yeah, you paused and we thought you were going to say I'm Aaron Mankey,

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
and you said better eight than never.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
That wasn't in the original, was it?

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
No.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
Just checking.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Just checking because it would have worked there.

57:29.000 --> 57:30.000
That would have been great.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
It would have been great in there.

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
I would have been okay with that.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
No sense on that poster.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Do you want me to go back and edit that audio?

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
Would you please?

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
For the old episode?

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
Would you please?

57:38.000 --> 57:39.000
Would you please?

57:39.000 --> 57:42.000
Do you think back in 1408 they were frugal enough and frifty enough that they

57:42.000 --> 57:46.000
ate that pig, or do you not eat a condemned pig?

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
I'm going to guess they ate it.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
Yeah.

57:49.000 --> 57:54.000
I mean, I want it very badly to be able to do this because most fans of podcasts,

57:54.000 --> 57:59.000
like, we listen to you, and then I want to do what you do.

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
And I don't know, and I've been thinking, like, well, Jeff has the music,

58:02.000 --> 58:09.000
and I want to try doing it, but I don't know how to, like, I just want to try one.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
You just play the music.

58:11.000 --> 58:17.000
And give me a, will you give me a topic to, give me a, or what?

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Give them some folklore to riff on.

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
Yeah.

58:20.000 --> 58:24.000
I don't know if we're local enough for that.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
I do Salem witch trials.

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
Salem witch trials?

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
Yeah.

58:28.000 --> 58:32.000
So then I have to, what I've learned from you is I have to back up three, three,

58:32.000 --> 58:36.000
like, boxes from Salem witch trials or even witches.

58:36.000 --> 58:37.000
So, okay.

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
Right.

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
I'm going to start off by talking about the history of Antiochquist.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
Right.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
And then we'll work our way up to.

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
Yeah.

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
You ready then?

58:45.000 --> 58:46.000
Yeah.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.000
What?

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
Here we go.

58:48.000 --> 59:01.000
In 1981, Arnold Palmer was at the top of the charts.

59:01.000 --> 59:07.000
He loved music, but what he really loved was socks.

59:07.000 --> 59:15.000
Socks made of cotton and Arnold Palmer could only buy those socks in one store.

59:15.000 --> 59:25.000
You see, cotton was scarce and socks being made from them were scarcer.

59:25.000 --> 59:34.000
So when Arnold Palmer walked into the Sears that day, what he didn't know.

59:34.000 --> 59:38.000
Well, is that he'd be starting on fire?

59:38.000 --> 59:46.000
The fluorescent lights due to faulty wiring in the section above the men's socks caught

59:46.000 --> 59:57.000
fire and fell on his head, bursting him into flames and ending the career of a celebrated

59:57.000 --> 59:59.500
musician.

59:59.500 --> 01:00:09.500
You see, America burns what it loves.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:16.840
Whether it's Michael Jackson or a witch.

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:27.440
What is a witch and where does a witch go if a witch doesn't know?

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:37.600
When I think about witches, I think about Salem, the capital of witches, but not a good place

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:40.320
for them to live.

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:56.440
You see, in Salem, as far back as 1492, these witches far from sailing the ocean blue.

01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:06.440
Were subjected to the opposite of oceans, fire, the same fire that burnt Arnold Palmer

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:14.440
and Michael Jackson and eventually the Loch Ness Monster.

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:25.440
But that cold day in 1492, Salem was about to learn that what goes around burns around.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.440
I'm Aaron Mahnke.

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:40.440
And this is Lore.

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:42.440
I have a couple of follow-up questions about that.

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:44.440
I think I was thinking of Robert Palmer, by the way.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:46.440
Robert Palmer would be...

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.440
Not that it matters.

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:50.440
People forget about that.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.440
Not only was Arnie a great golfer, but he had some great hits in the early 80s.

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.440
He was simply irresistible.

01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:00.440
Remember that video where he's got the golf club and the girls with the lipstick?

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:01.440
Arnold.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:07.440
She's so fine, she got a bogey on the back night.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:16.440
She's so fine, there's iced tea in her lemonade.

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:23.440
So your podcast, you let go, okay, so there's these monsters and stuff and this is how you get rid of them?

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:30.440
Like if a Dracula shows up.

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:34.440
If a Dracula shows up, you could say, well, actually, garlic doesn't work on Dracula.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.440
It only works on Boris Barlow.

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:41.440
I'm not really the Neil deGrasse Tyson of folklore.

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:42.440
That's not what I do.

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:48.440
Who is, in your opinion, today in the world?

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:57.440
No, but I haven't heard of this until now, so I'm going to check it out.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:03.440
Well, here's the rock because you're not as much of a...

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:04.440
Dog?

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.440
He's more of a visual guy.

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:14.440
You'd be happy to know he's working on his second season of the hit show lore based on his podcast and that there's a season out.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:15.440
What is it, Amazon?

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:16.440
Amazon.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.440
You can watch it.

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:18.440
Oh, okay, even better.

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:22.440
You can watch it come to life and Robert Patrick's in one.

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:25.440
You remember him from The Terminator.

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:28.440
He's so stupid you have to trick him into smart stuff.

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.440
Robert Patrick?

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:35.440
Robert Patrick is stupid?

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:38.440
Shit.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.440
But Erin, are you from Boston?

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.440
No, no, I grew up in the Midwest.

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:45.440
Why do you have a relationship with the Wilbur?

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:49.440
I remember because you saw that I was performing here and you're like, hey, I'm going to be there.

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:52.440
The folks that run the Wilbur have a tour company for folks like us.

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:53.440
Okay.

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:55.440
And they represent me in book venues.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.440
I played here a year and a half ago.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:00.440
You ever see the blue man group here?

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.440
How would you get rid of a blue man?

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:04.440
Back to your bags.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.440
All right.

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.440
What gets rid of a blue man?

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:10.440
What's the origin of the blue man?

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:13.440
You make a circle of salt, right?

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.440
And it stops them.

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:15.440
Okay.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.440
Like slugs.

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:17.440
All right.

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:19.440
Spencer, will you do a lore intro about the blue man group?

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:20.440
If it's bad.

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.440
Sure.

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:30.440
Uh-oh.

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.440
Wait, it's being weird.

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:33.440
All right.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.440
Somebody help me out.

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:35.440
Where'd it go?

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.440
Let's talk about immigration.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.440
Okay.

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:42.440
I think it's a problem.

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:47.440
It drives me nuts when somebody posts a picture and it'll be a picture of a pretty white girl

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:52.440
and it'll say, like, separated from her family when an immigrant shot her.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.440
And you go, okay.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:55.440
Okay.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.440
So you care about people.

01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:03.440
So let's pass a bunch of sweeping legislation to protect people.

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:05.440
I'm sure you're into all of those.

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:08.440
And then they go, well, it's contrary to what you might think.

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:09.440
I'm not just some trailer trash.

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:11.440
I do have opinions about it.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:15.440
It's like, why are we having a grown-up conversation that you crashed with your fucking photo of

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:17.440
somebody saying, like, ooh, a brown person shot.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:20.440
There's, like, people just post memes.

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.440
And then they're like, look at this.

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:23.440
Oogity boogity.

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:26.440
And it's like a dead rat they bring in from the backyard.

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:30.440
And then you're supposed to dim the lights and pour some wine and talk to them like adults.

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:33.440
Is that how you get rid of a blue man?

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.440
No.

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:35.440
Can you get a blue rat?

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:36.440
No.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:37.440
Okay.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:38.440
But keep looking.

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:43.440
What could I get rid of with that spell?

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:46.440
I think I'm not understanding the show yet.

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.440
It's, well...

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:49.440
Still.

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:52.440
It's about actual shit.

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.440
The asshole.

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:56.440
The blue man group exists.

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:57.440
I've seen commercials.

01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.440
Yeah, so...

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:01.440
So name something...

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:02.440
Dickhead!

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:03.440
Name something that doesn't exist.

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:07.440
Telling him that I'm stupid with the Robert Patrick side mouth?

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:09.440
You didn't think I saw that?

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:17.440
You're talking into a microphone, you dipshit.

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:27.440
I'm glad I came.

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:30.440
That is the most twisted attack on anyone ever.

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:32.440
I'm glad I'm here.

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:33.440
You know what?

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:36.440
You deserve me being in your life.

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:39.440
I couldn't have happened to a better person.

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:42.440
So I found what it's like to be on Twitter.

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:43.440
Right here.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:45.440
Yeah.

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:46.440
Yeah.

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:50.440
Well, you know, you had a little dust-up with Crystalia,

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:54.440
and you've been active on Twitter,

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:57.440
and you've been like, you know, you're Aaron Mankey,

01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:01.440
and you have your opinions,

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.440
and you're finding out what all of us are,

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.440
which is like, well, people might like your podcast

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.440
because it's about werewolves,

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:08.440
and they might also maybe vote differently from you

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.440
or have a different opinion,

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.440
and then you tweet something,

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.440
and then people pile on you, right?

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.440
They go like, what the fuck, bro?

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:19.440
My girlfriend and I try to fuck to your podcast, man.

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:23.440
The fuck you talking about baby-switch for?

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.440
Talk about werewolves on your Twitter,

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:30.440
and then you're like, eat me, right?

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:31.440
Well, you know.

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.440
In so many words.

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:33.440
Right.

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:34.440
Yeah.

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:35.440
Right.

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:38.440
That's probably the last thing I could say, right?

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:39.440
Probably.

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:41.440
But you don't get on Twitter to become happy, right?

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:44.440
We can recognize at least as a population

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.440
that we don't get on Twitter to make ourselves happy.

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:48.440
We're getting on Twitter to make ourselves unhappy.

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:51.440
Like, we never go like, I'm so happy right now.

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:53.440
I should be happier.

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:54.440
I'm gonna get on Twitter.

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:56.440
If you're happy, you forget to get on Twitter.

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.440
If you're sad, you're like, I'm so fucking sad.

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:01.440
I don't know whether I should eat glass,

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:05.440
like eat a box of donuts,

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:07.440
like dip my head in turpentine,

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.440
or get on Twitter.

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:11.440
Twitter's the closest thing you can do.

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.440
Befriend a vending machine.

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.440
What's that?

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.440
Or befriend a vending machine?

01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:17.440
Yeah, well, no.

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:18.440
I mean, that was a joyous night.

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.440
Like, I won't have you...

01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.440
You guys are acting like I was described.

01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:24.440
I was happy last night.

01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:27.440
That's a new thing I learned from my personal trainer, Dave Kline,

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:30.440
if you watch my Instagram workouts.

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:32.440
Dave Kline has been on the show.

01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:36.440
He told me, you know, he kind of blew my mind with this.

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:39.440
I'm trying to practice this and seeing how it goes.

01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:43.440
He said, you know, love can be a weapon.

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:45.440
He didn't put it that way.

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:49.440
Like, you can choose to express love

01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:54.440
and be in a loving place as an assertion of your power.

01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.440
I'm paraphrasing him.

01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:00.440
We associate love with, like, acquiescence and, like,

01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:06.440
oh, I have to break through past all of my needs to be in control

01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:09.440
and not feel stupid.

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:12.440
And, like, all these things that society kind of, like, demands of us in the moment.

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:16.440
Like, it's kind of incompatible with this idea we have about love,

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:19.440
which is that you're zen and you're open to everything

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:22.440
and you're even kind of weak on purpose

01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:25.440
and you're osmosically going to absorb everyone's point of view and stuff.

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:29.440
But there's this version of love where you can just be like,

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:32.440
I love everything because that gives me power.

01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:36.440
That makes me a good person and it gives me power over everyone.

01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:41.440
Like, it makes me a more evolved person.

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:44.440
You can choose to do it for kind of selfish reasons to be like,

01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:46.440
I'm in love with what's going on right now

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:49.440
because I'm better than people.

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:51.440
I think that's fair.

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:55.440
I mean, that seems like it slots in with the four agreements, honestly.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.440
It's certainly, like...

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.440
It's very nice.

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.440
You know, maybe it's not the best way to be taught about love,

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.440
but it's certainly, like, maybe a rope into the pit

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:04.440
when you're not feeling love at all.

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:08.440
And you're like, like, oh, man, I just want to, like, eat a rock right now.

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:10.440
I don't want to love anything.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.440
And it's always like, yeah, but you know what love is,

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:15.440
it's making everybody else eat your fucking love shit.

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.440
You know?

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:20.440
Like, if I get off the elevator at Rick and Morty's offices

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:23.440
and I come out and I'm feeling like I love being there,

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:27.440
I'm going to, everyone else is going to be happier

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.440
and do a better job.

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:33.440
And, like, it is strength and it is leadership.

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.440
How are you going to do that?

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.440
70 episodes.

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.440
I mean, how?

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.440
By loving, by loving it.

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:47.440
I love it.

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:51.440
There's so many, Dan, it's so many episodes.

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:53.440
70.

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:55.440
How many have you done so far?

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:56.440
What's the answer?

01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:57.440
I have a question.

01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:59.440
What's the answer to your question?

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.440
What's a Rick and Mortis?

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.440
No.

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:10.440
You know, there's supposed to be an unspoken exchange of fandom here.

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.440
Right?

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.440
No, it's the current news.

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:15.440
Are you ready with the...

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:16.440
So many episodes.

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.440
Yeah, what are you doing here?

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.440
Spencer's going to do it.

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:20.440
Why are you here?

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:21.440
Are you writing right now?

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.440
What's that?

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:23.440
Should you be writing it?

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:24.440
You should be writing it right now.

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:25.440
I had to cut.

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:26.440
You haven't even started.

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:29.440
We've been waiting how long.

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:31.440
Months. Months?

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:32.440
Right?

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.440
I mean, come on.

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.440
Come on, where is it?

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:38.440
Where is it, Dan?

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:39.440
Where is it?

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.440
Dan, where's it?

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:42.440
Where is it?

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:43.440
What are you doing?

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:45.440
You better start writing it.

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:48.440
Are you going to write one right now, Dan?

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.440
God.

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:50.440
If I have to.

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.440
He'll try.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:52.440
70 episodes. Get to work.

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:54.440
Can we pull up...

01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:00.440
Welcome to Notes.

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:07.440
I can't wait to see that first porn page just open up.

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:09.440
This is Levy's laptop.

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:11.440
He's asexual.

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.440
He's not asexual.

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.440
He listens to Dave Matthews.

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.440
He's not last night.

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:18.440
The only thing I hear is...

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:20.440
I stand correct to her dates, believe me.

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:22.440
I take it back.

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:24.440
No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:26.440
And also, you can be asexual.

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.440
I admire you if you are.

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:30.440
It's not an insult.

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:34.440
It's actually, I think, I envy you.

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.440
I would like to be asexual.

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:38.440
Would you like to be...are you asexual?

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:41.440
First, are you?

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:44.440
First question. Want to fuck?

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:46.440
Do you think that's like an asexual thing?

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.440
People get together at asexual bars and they're like,

01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:50.440
I don't need to have sex. Me neither.

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:53.440
Me as well then, right? Yeah.

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:55.440
And they have the best sex ever.

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:57.440
Because they're like, this doesn't matter.

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.440
I agree.

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.440
It's like, that's how we feel about Krispy Kreme, right?

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.440
Like, there's nothing...

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:05.440
They would be great. That would be the best sex.

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:07.440
That's how sex should be, probably.

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:10.440
I don't mean to...I don't want to trivialize it for romantics, though.

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:12.440
Sex should be important to you if it's important to you.

01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:16.440
Is sex important to you, Aaron Mankey?

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:18.440
When you're done, do you say,

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:23.440
I'm Aaron Mankey?

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:25.440
Everybody that's here tonight on a date,

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:30.440
just please go home and fucking say that afterwards.

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:34.440
I'm Aaron Mankey.

01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:43.440
And you may be carrying lore.

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:45.440
So far, I love it.

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:47.440
Can we enlarge that? Can we go full...

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.440
Is that as big as it gets?

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:51.440
I can't.

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:53.440
I don't know.

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:55.440
Is there a font size?

01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:01.440
Press that green button.

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:03.440
Let Aaron Mankey tell me.

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:04.440
A, A.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.440
Right on your menu, on your toolbar.

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:07.440
A, A.

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:08.440
No, down in the window.

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:09.440
Oh, top of the screen.

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:10.440
A, A.

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:11.440
This is why it's taking so fucking long.

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.440
It's like alcohol and synonymous.

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:18.440
Oh, there, okay.

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:21.440
We'll have evolved out of, like,

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:25.440
pinkies before the show is finished.

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:27.440
Well, I don't know. Look, there's been technical...

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:30.440
I'm happy to bake it.

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:34.440
Dan just maximized the window.

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:36.440
Fade in. Fade in.

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.440
All right, so it's...

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:43.440
It doesn't, it doesn't...

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:48.440
Steve Levy.

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:51.440
Make it big.

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:52.440
All right.

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:55.440
Steve, Steve, why don't...

01:14:55.440 --> 01:15:01.440
Oh!

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.440
Boo!

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:04.440
Yeah, boo!

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:05.440
Boo!

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:06.440
Shame.

01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:08.440
Credit card information.

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:10.440
Credit card information.

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:11.440
Explaining this wouldn't help.

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.440
Bank account.

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:15.440
Bank account number.

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:17.440
Vending machine password.

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.440
Venmo.

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.440
Rah, rah, rah, rah.

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:24.440
Rah, rah, rah, rah.

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:29.440
Just select it all.

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:31.440
All right, for the listeners at home,

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:33.440
Steve Levy and then Aaron Mankey and Dan

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:35.440
are trying to figure out how computers work.

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:38.440
And Dan, Dan is going to freestyle...

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.440
Oh, which template would you like?

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:41.440
I think that...

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:45.440
All right.

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.440
Now we're talking.

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.440
You could, you could, you could, Spencer...

01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:55.440
Steve just plugged in.

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:57.440
He got word open.

01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:00.440
That whole ordeal was opening one file.

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:02.440
Dan, Dan, for the home listener,

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:04.440
do you want me to narrate as you write or no?

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:08.440
Sure.

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:10.440
Or if you wanted to be a surprise,

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:13.440
keep your eyes closed.

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:17.440
Interior Rick's Garage Day.

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:23.440
Rick is making science.

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.440
Rick.

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:28.440
Brackets scientifically.

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:32.440
This should be some good burp.

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:37.440
Science.

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.440
Yeah!

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:43.440
Whoo!

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:48.440
Morty.

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:49.440
Morty, 14.

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:51.440
Hot, but doesn't know it enters.

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.440
Morty.

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:53.440
Hi.

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:54.440
Hi, Don.

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:55.440
Jeez, Rick.

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:58.440
Are you making more science?

01:16:58.440 --> 01:16:59.440
Rick.

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:02.440
No, Morty.

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:03.440
Morty.

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:05.440
Are you lying?

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.440
Rick.

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:10.440
Does it matter?

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:12.440
Morty.

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:19.440
Someone with an empirical moral compass.

01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:21.440
Does anybody out there do a really good Rick

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:22.440
or Morty impression?

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:23.440
You're doing great.

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.440
Twilight Guy?

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:25.440
Twilight Maker.

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:26.440
Get up here.

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:34.440
The Twilight Maker says he does.

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:35.440
Check one, two.

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:37.440
What's your name, Twilight Maker?

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:38.440
Crew.

01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:39.440
Crew.

01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:40.440
Crew.

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:41.440
Give it up for Crew.

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:42.440
All right.

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:43.440
I do Morty.

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:44.440
I don't do both.

01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:45.440
Okay.

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:46.440
Do you have a Rick out there?

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:47.440
Does anyone do a Rick?

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:48.440
You're too far away.

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:49.440
I'll do Rick.

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:50.440
Okay.

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:51.440
Do Morty.

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:52.440
Oh, sorry.

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:53.440
Wait.

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:54.440
That's Rick.

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:55.440
I'm Morty.

01:17:55.440 --> 01:18:00.440
Morty, you're trying to make words sound more important

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:03.440
by training ones that are longer than other ones together

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:05.440
and it's only going to result in a bunch of words.

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:08.440
You may as well just accept your cosmic role as a dumbass.

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:09.440
Oh, okay, Rick.

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:14.440
Rick, whatever you say.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:20.440
Morty, you sound more like Mickey Mouse to be quite honest with you.

01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:21.440
Jeff's going off the hook.

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:22.440
Oh, geez.

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.440
I hope there's no copyright infringement, Rick.

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:25.440
Oh, boy.

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:26.440
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:27.440
Come on.

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:28.440
Sorry.

01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:29.440
Sorry, Rob.

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:30.440
Stick to the script.

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:31.440
We're not paying you.

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:32.440
We're paying him.

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:37.440
I thought this was who's line.

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:46.440
Morty, are you okay?

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:47.440
Improvised.

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:51.440
It's Rick, aren't it?

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:56.440
Aren't you the guy from the audience, the Dan Harmon?

01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:04.440
He pointed out every time he talked about toilet making.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:13.440
Yes.

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:23.440
This episode is good enough to pretty slow start, Morty.

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:25.440
This has gone off the rails, Morty.

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:32.440
Then, Sinister, do you want to see the rails, Morty?

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:53.440
The Donnie Darko guidelines that make everything we haven't done the things that we're already

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:59.440
going to do.

01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:02.440
This is Sir Bon Jovi.

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:07.440
Yes.

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:12.440
Follow me, or don't.

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:20.440
You already have.

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:31.440
Rick walks into a thing and pushes a thing.

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:33.440
Justin usually deals with the visuals.

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:37.440
A drawer opens inside a thing.

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:46.440
Stairs are in it.

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:47.440
Back to dialogue, okay?

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:50.440
It's what I'm good at, Morty.

01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:53.440
Yes, please, Rick.

01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:58.440
Oh, jeez, Rick.

01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:02.440
Take me down to the funky town.

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:06.440
Rick?

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:11.440
What?

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:22.440
The funky town?

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:33.440
It's a new millennial euphemism for bathrooms.

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:37.440
Morty, what the fuck?

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:40.440
Never mind.

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:52.440
Down the stairs to the rails.

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.440
There's Rick impression.

01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:57.440
Real number on your voice, Morty.

01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:59.440
Oh, jeez, not mine.

01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:06.440
No, no, no, no, come on.

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:10.440
I'm not going to tell you again.

01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:12.440
Rick takes Morty down stairs.

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:14.440
My voice is...

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:18.440
9-11!

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:21.440
Spencer, I'm having vocal surgery in a few days.

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:22.440
You want to take over as Rick?

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:25.440
Yeah, yeah, okay.

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:29.440
It's 9-11, Morty.

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:33.440
So?

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:35.440
Oh, it's my 9-11 alarm.

01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:37.440
So it's important to never forget it.

01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:38.440
His phone is ringing.

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:39.440
It's my 9-11 alarm.

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:40.440
That's...

01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:41.440
Sorry.

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:42.440
Do you need to take that?

01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:44.440
No, it's for 9-11, sorry.

01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:45.440
Is it the toilet company?

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:47.440
Sorry, sorry.

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:53.440
We could have used that on 9-11.

01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:57.440
Okay, but does remembering it have to distract us from things we're already doing?

01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:59.440
No.

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:15.440
Aaron Mankey, 30-ish, hot and nosy, steps from the shadows.

01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:22.440
Hello.

01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:23.440
Holy shit, Morty.

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:30.440
It's Aaron Mankey.

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:49.440
Or is it?

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:52.440
Identity has always been...

01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:56.440
An awkward concept.

01:23:56.440 --> 01:24:03.440
From the shores of Salem.

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:09.440
In 1492.

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:14.440
To the Boston Mall in 1982.

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:21.440
Mankind, or should I say, some kind,

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:39.440
has sought to answer one particular nagging question.

01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:48.440
Who am I?

01:24:48.440 --> 01:25:02.440
Where did I get here from?

01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:03.440
Crunch, crunch, crunch.

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:13.440
How can I guarantee that a Dracula won't bury me alive?

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:18.440
The answer has come in a variety of forms.

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:30.440
From shoes to Tonka trucks and tampons.

01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:34.440
But one theme continues to emerge

01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:50.440
on the winding road of mortality.

01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:52.440
I'm Aaron Mankey.

01:25:52.440 --> 01:26:01.440
And this is the Omega protocol.

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:04.440
That was a good line read.

01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:12.440
Aaron Mankey turns into a moth man.

01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:19.440
Run, Morty!

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:40.440
I just wanted to make toilets.

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:44.440
All will be consumed by the flame eye circle.

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:46.440
Oh, that does actually make sense.

01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:50.440
I thought it was a typo, but no, that's good.

01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:52.440
You liked the delivery, was that good?

01:26:52.440 --> 01:27:04.440
Aaron Mankey eats everyone.

01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:16.440
That's here for crew, everybody.

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:22.440
I don't think that's going to be riveting radio.

01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:25.440
But it's going to be great television.

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:30.440
So the season is 70 episodes long?

01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:32.440
Who does that?

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:34.440
Everyone keeps going, oh, so it'll be seven seasons.

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:37.440
I'm like, no, welcome to 25 episodes a year

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:40.440
and early retirement.

01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:45.440
I will show you how bad a Rick and Morty can get.

01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:49.440
I'm writing one right now with my extra Iron Man suit at home.

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:53.440
This is episode eight.

01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:55.440
I'll fuck up a Spider-Man from here.

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:56.440
I don't care.

01:27:56.440 --> 01:28:01.440
I'm like training Spider-Man with one suit.

01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:04.440
Marvel loyalists.

01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:06.440
It's felt like Spider-Man deserves to not just become

01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:10.440
like an adjunct to the Iron Man.

01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:13.440
Come on, Spider-Man.

01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:18.440
All right, let's hear the blue man group.

01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:20.440
Oh, shit, this is going to be...

01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:22.440
Blue man group, Laura, intro by Spencer.

01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:32.440
APPLAUSE

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:36.440
Mankind has been eating food for years,

01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:38.440
decades, if we're honest.

01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:43.440
And for most of that time, it hasn't been salted.

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:47.440
When John Wilkes Booth walked into the mall one day,

01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:53.440
he had no idea what he was about to add to the culinary landscape.

01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:57.440
Spying a big crystalline rock, he needed to lick it.

01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:00.440
And lick it, he did.

01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:02.440
Since then, salt has been commonplace at the dinner table

01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:06.440
across America and the world.

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:08.440
But that made no difference to Margaret Cho

01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:10.440
as she left her house one morning,

01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:15.440
headed to the same mall.

01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:19.440
The sound was peculiar.

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:24.440
A corpse torn asunder, covered in blue markings,

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:30.440
and surrounded by the remnants of a broken salt circle.

01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:36.440
No one knows what the first sighting of the blue man group was.

01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:39.440
And one doesn't have to, to fear.

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:43.440
You see, things that are blue have a way

01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:46.440
of coming back around,

01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:51.440
and things that aren't might just surprise you.

01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:56.440
I'm Aaron Mankey, and this is Lore.

01:29:56.440 --> 01:30:01.440
APPLAUSE

01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:04.440
That's a good Lore! That's a good Lore!

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:06.440
That's good!

01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:09.440
I am a huge fan. I love your stuff.

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:11.440
You've got the job!

01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:13.440
Thank you.

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:15.440
There's some overlap with Dungeon Mastery.

01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:19.440
No, I seriously, the real-world take on folklore

01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:21.440
is very inspiring as someone who weaves folklore

01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:23.440
into fantasy narratives.

01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:26.440
I think it's a really cool source of inspiration.

01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:29.440
I constantly hear from people that do D&D campaigns

01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:32.440
and they take inspiration from the show to build stuff.

01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:34.440
I play D&D every week.

01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:36.440
Oh, nice!

01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:39.440
APPLAUSE

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:41.440
With racists.

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:43.440
While we're on the topic, everyone...

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:45.440
Everyone will...

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.440
That's the new thing.

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:49.440
Alt-right D&D is ticking off, man.

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.440
Yeah.

01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:54.440
And a couple of campaigns ago, I was the Lore Bard.

01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:56.440
Oh, yeah.

01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:56.440
You can believe it, yeah.

01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:58.440
A Lore Bard?

01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:58.440
Yeah, if you're a Bard,

01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:00.440
you can pick one of the colleges.

01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:00.440
I always wanted to be...

01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:02.440
Lore Bard.

01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:02.440
Oh, yeah.

01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:04.440
And one of the cutting words is one of the best spells.

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:06.440
You just make fun of people the entire night.

01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:09.440
Yeah, you can kill someone by insulting them.

01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:11.440
It's amazing.

01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:11.440
I would hate to get insulted by Aaron Mahnke.

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:13.440
Can you imagine?

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:13.440
He'd go,

01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:15.440
throughout history,

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:17.440
pants

01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:20.440
have had one purpose.

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:24.440
To cover or present

01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:27.440
the extremities below the abdomen.

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:30.440
However, your pants

01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:34.440
appear to be entirely removed from that purpose,

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:36.440
all together.

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:40.440
They look like raggedy-ass Kmart pants.

01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:45.440
I'm Aaron Mahnke.

01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:48.440
You burnt.

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:52.440
And this is Lore Bard.

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:55.440
I'm Aaron Mahnke,

01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:58.440
and those converse are piss wipers.

01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:00.440
I used to call bad shit piss wipers.

01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:02.440
When I was a kid, you had to have, like,

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:04.440
these big, crazy,

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:06.440
your shoes had to be, like,

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:06.440
rag-anomic, fucking, like,

01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:08.440
Nike things that had, like,

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:10.440
pumps and Velcro

01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:12.440
and zippers,

01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:14.440
and Michael Jackson had to be

01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:16.440
in one of the laces.

01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:18.440
And if you had anything lesser than that,

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:20.440
like, something that, you know,

01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:22.440
more recently would be

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:25.440
really nice shoes that people like.

01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:27.440
They're like those canvas all-stars.

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:29.440
They were called piss wipers,

01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:31.440
because they kind of turned yellow over time.

01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:33.440
Piss wipers.

01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:35.440
Were they wicked piss wipers?

01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:37.440
Wicked piss wipers.

01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:40.440
You got wicked retarded piss wipers.

01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:42.440
Honey, I like damn apples.

01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:45.440
I like them just fine

01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:48.440
from the seas of Boston Bay

01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:53.440
to the hotel that I'm staying in.

01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:57.440
That's the two locations I know.

01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:00.440
The home of Quincy Jones.

01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:02.440
Go to Little Italy.

01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:04.440
Eat a pie.

01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:06.440
Go to see a lantern in the sky.

01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:10.440
Old-timey lanterns.

01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:12.440
Two if by C.

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:14.440
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:16.440
It's the jingle for the Boston Tourism Board.

01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:18.440
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:20.440
Come check out our fancy streets

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:22.440
and see where fallout three happened.

01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:24.440
See how many things...

01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:26.440
See how many things...

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:28.440
That's what I was most excited about.

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:30.440
That's where fallout three is.

01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:32.440
Dan.

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:34.440
Fallout four.

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:36.440
He played it. He actually played it.

01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:38.440
You did. You played fallout four.

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:40.440
No, wait. Fallout four was New Vegas, I thought.

01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:42.440
No, fallout New Vegas was after fallout three

01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:44.440
but before fallout four.

01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:46.440
He definitely played it.

01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:48.440
I'm very happy that you guys are that upset about it

01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:50.440
because that makes you my kind.

01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:52.440
Dan, you said you were going to get political tonight.

01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:56.440
Wait, let me get this straight.

01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:58.440
Fallout three was like the big one.

01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:00.440
Yeah.

01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:02.440
Then fallout New Vegas.

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:04.440
Then fallout New Vegas, which was not a number.

01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:06.440
It was just fallout New Vegas.

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:08.440
It was like an expansion.

01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:10.440
So then fallout four.

01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:12.440
Boston.

01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:14.440
Got it. That's why I got confused.

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:16.440
Do you get to go down the Liberty Trail

01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:18.440
and kick ass?

01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:20.440
Yeah, you follow the Liberty Trail.

01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:22.440
That's a thing.

01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:24.440
Dan, from your knowledge of fallout four,

01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:26.440
how many stops do you think

01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:28.440
if you were a true guy, you could name

01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:30.440
on the Liberty Trail?

01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:32.440
No, I can't know.

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:34.440
The place where you fight the big giants

01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:36.440
and you hide in the cargo bin.

01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:38.440
Oh, yeah, the super mutants hide out.

01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:40.440
Yeah.

01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:42.440
Fallout four!

01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:44.440
Fallout four!

01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:46.440
Fallout four!

01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:48.440
Fallout four!

01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:50.440
I appreciate the effort.

01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:52.440
Fallout four!

01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:54.440
Fallout four!

01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:56.440
Fallout four!

01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:58.440
Fallout four!

01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:00.440
Fallout four!

01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:02.440
He's communicating with them.

01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:04.440
Did you hear?

01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:06.440
It's amazing.

01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:08.440
I like to just think that they love all video games

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:10.440
this much.

01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:12.440
If we were overwatched, they'd be like,

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:14.440
Tracer! Oh, my God!

01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:16.440
They just love video games.

01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:18.440
Yeah, see?

01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:20.440
I would have been equally unsurprised

01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:22.440
if you guys hated Fallout four

01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:24.440
because it was like, that's a bullshit

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:26.440
reproduction of our historical

01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:28.440
districts.

01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:30.440
There's no fish monster in the park.

01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:32.440
And if there was,

01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:34.440
you certainly wouldn't have that many health packs around it.

01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:36.440
He wouldn't need a legal seafood.

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:38.440
He would have gotten a unionized house.

01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:44.440
All right.

01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:46.440
What have we done so far?

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:48.440
We've covered a lot of ground.

01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:50.440
There's just half of the

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:52.440
season of Rick and Morty.

01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:54.440
Right.

01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:56.440
We've done a bunch of episodes of

01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:58.440
lore.

01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:00.440
The blue man rap.

01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:02.440
That's still the come.

01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:04.440
I'd like to bring the word cockamamie back

01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:06.440
a little bit.

01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:08.440
Oh, they're on board.

01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:10.440
Here's a thought. A great way to make me less of an elitist

01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:12.440
would be to show me how much better

01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:14.440
an anonymous horde would be at running my fucking life

01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:18.440
or kill me.

01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:20.440
Oh, yeah. I'm an elitist.

01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:22.440
I think I'm better than a bunch of people

01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:24.440
I don't know.

01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:26.440
Who the fuck do you think I want to run my life?

01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:28.440
A bunch of people I don't know?

01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:30.440
All right.

01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:32.440
Of course you guys wouldn't be into that.

01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:34.440
You're a bunch of people I don't know.

01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:36.440
You're biased.

01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:38.440
But each one of you

01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:40.440
as an individual is a fucking elitist.

01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:42.440
And you're very near the coast.

01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:44.440
You're basically coastal elites.

01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:46.440
I'm Aaron Menke.

01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:48.440
The avert.

01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:50.440
The elusive libtard

01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:52.440
is a creature

01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:54.440
referred to

01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:56.440
in the forests and catacombs

01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:58.440
of almost every urban city

01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:00.440
throughout history.

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:02.440
As opposed to not urban cities,

01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:06.440
the libtard seems to manifest itself

01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:08.440
in times and places where,

01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:10.440
well,

01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:12.440
people don't have

01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:14.440
much

01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:16.440
going on.

01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:22.440
Abraham Lincoln

01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:24.440
couldn't have expected his boots

01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:26.440
to start talking to him.

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:28.440
But that's exactly what they did

01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:32.440
on the morning of October 11th,

01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:34.440
1928.

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:38.440
Returning to his home,

01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:40.440
having absconded with the Lindbergh baby,

01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:42.440
a weary Lincoln

01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:44.440
placed the child down on the table

01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:46.440
expecting it, perhaps justifiably,

01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:48.440
to fly.

01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:54.440
Only to watch it

01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:56.440
die.

01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:58.440
Abe Lincoln would return

01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:00.440
that baby to the wooded edges

01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:02.440
outside the Lindbergh estate.

01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:04.440
But in so doing,

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:06.440
he would start

01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:08.440
a bit of a dilemma

01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:12.440
among

01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:14.440
the rural non-elites.

01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:16.440
You see,

01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:22.440
Abe Lincoln was

01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:24.440
above all

01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:26.440
a libtard.

01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:30.440
And he had now killed the baby of

01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:32.440
perhaps one of the most celebrated

01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:34.440
blue-collar heroes,

01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:36.440
a man who single-handedly

01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:38.440
flew from

01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:40.440
Paris to New York,

01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:42.440
thereby proving

01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:44.440
that we didn't need the former.

01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:52.440
When

01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:54.440
Johnny Lindbergh was

01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:56.440
buried in those woods,

01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:58.440
his fractured cranium

01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:00.440
oozing

01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:02.440
baby brains, I'm sorry,

01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:04.440
someone hurt Jesus.

01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:06.440
I know,

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.440
try being me.

01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:10.440
I like this.

01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:12.440
I thought you were about to say

01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:14.440
chocolate and candies,

01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:16.440
which wouldn't have been offensive at all.

01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:18.440
I'm trying to wrap it up.

01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:20.440
Tonight's lore has been brought to you by the cool, refreshing taste of baby schwits.

01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:26.440
By the way,

01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:28.440
It's time to crack open the baby schwits.

01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:30.440
The baby schwits.

01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:32.440
Lore is brought to you with limited

01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:34.440
commercial interruption.

01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:36.440
However, you will be hearing some

01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:38.440
in-line branded content.

01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:42.440
I'm Aaron Budweiser.

01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:46.440
And this is the cold,

01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:48.440
clear taste

01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:50.440
of fully-croisoned beer.

01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:52.440
I don't know.

01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:54.440
Aaron Mankey,

01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:56.440
didn't you...

01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:58.440
Aaron Mankey,

01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:00.440
Aaron Mankey,

01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:02.440
why do you like lore?

01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:04.440
Not the production,

01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:06.440
the thing that you

01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:08.440
stole the title from.

01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:10.440
The lore,

01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:12.440
why do you like lore?

01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:14.440
We know why you like lore,

01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:16.440
because you own it.

01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:18.440
Why do you like lore?

01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:20.440
Who doesn't like creepy stories?

01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:22.440
Especially ones that are real.

01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:24.440
Yeah.

01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:26.440
You could easily, there's a million podcast.

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:28.440
You could just be like,

01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:30.440
hey, here's some unresearched

01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:32.440
urban legends about

01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:34.440
werewolves and things,

01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:36.440
but you like the idea that the truth is

01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:38.440
that this stuff might be,

01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:40.440
that our world might be more magical?

01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:42.440
Or do you like the fact that

01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:44.440
we shouldn't even be calling it magic?

01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:46.440
It should just be called normal,

01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:48.440
because real life is fucking creepy.

01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:50.440
Good question. I'm like fucking Bob Costas.

01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:52.440
Wow.

01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:54.440
Except you don't look like a little boy.

01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:56.440
Yeah.

01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:58.440
Bob Costas looks like a little boy.

01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:00.440
I just know I can't say Charlie Rose anymore.

01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:02.440
No.

01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:04.440
Yeah.

01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:06.440
You can't.

01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:08.440
Yeah, people are monsters.

01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:10.440
What are we talking about?

01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:12.440
Was that one of your guiding themes

01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:14.440
that you wanted to express through the podcast,

01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:16.440
or did you find that after your research?

01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:18.440
Because that's like the main theme

01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:20.440
in your stuff, right?

01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:22.440
Yeah, it's become that.

01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:24.440
Originally, it was,

01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:26.440
wow, check out this creepy stuff I found out

01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:28.440
about this village that dug up one of their ladies

01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:30.440
and cut her heart out and made a tonic out of it,

01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:32.440
and then they drank it.

01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:34.440
The one that I heard, Aaron,

01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:36.440
What do you call it? A monculous?

01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:38.440
A monculous.

01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:40.440
There was no magic to that.

01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:42.440
It's actual experiments on trying to

01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:44.440
raise the dead.

01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:46.440
It's actual things that people actually did.

01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:48.440
It's not mythical.

01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:50.440
I don't know, people did this.

01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:52.440
These are court cases that actually happens.

01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.440
Get yourself a dried gourd

01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:56.440
and fill it with some blood and some semen

01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:58.440
and maybe some ground bones,

01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:00.440
and then shove it up a horse's womb

01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:02.440
and wait for it.

01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:04.440
And then crack open a nice cool baby Schwitz.

01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:06.440
As babyschwitz.com

01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:08.440
slash lore, offer code lore.

01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:10.440
Get a gourd

01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:12.440
and fill it with blood and semen

01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:14.440
and put it in a horse.

01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:16.440
That's been done.

01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:18.440
Yeah, that makes sense.

01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:20.440
It doesn't make sense.

01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:22.440
But we only know it doesn't make sense

01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:24.440
because we're standing on the shoulders of scientists.

01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:26.440
Exactly.

01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:28.440
And actually that would be science at a certain point

01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:30.440
because you'd be like, well,

01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:32.440
other things have blood and semen in them

01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:34.440
and then a baby comes out so you're like,

01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:36.440
how about if I put blood and semen in a gourd?

01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:38.440
There's a misogynistic underpinning there, right?

01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:40.440
It's like

01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:42.440
men going like, come on,

01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:44.440
we've got to be able to do this alone.

01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:46.440
It's

01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:48.440
they keep pulling this out

01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:50.440
in every argument.

01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:52.440
Like without me,

01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:54.440
people like you wouldn't exist.

01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:56.440
I just got to be able to wave something at her face

01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:58.440
and go, I could come in a gourd.

01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:00.440
I could make a horse gourd.

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:02.440
I haven't seen it written yet,

01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:04.440
but we could make the argument that the alchemists

01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:06.440
were like the first incels, right?

01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:08.440
Yeah.

01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:10.440
Oh.

01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:12.440
They're definitely hacking and trolling

01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:14.440
because it was gold, basically,

01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:16.440
I mean, her emails.

01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:18.440
There was an alchemist

01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:20.440
who believed he could take urine

01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:22.440
and distill it into gold because, you know,

01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:24.440
they're both yellow, right?

01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:26.440
So he filled his basement

01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:28.440
with buckets of his own piss.

01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:30.440
Do you want to riff this?

01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:32.440
Can we go to the...

01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:34.440
No.

01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:36.440
Come on.

01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:38.440
I want to hear what it sounds like

01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:40.440
when you do our impression.

01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:42.440
Let's just try one.

01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:44.440
Do buckets of urine or whatever you want.

01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:46.440
All right, you want me to give you something else?

01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:48.440
That's my favorite Bob Dylan song.

01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:50.440
What about the Chupacabra?

01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:56.440
Wait, you got to play...

01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:58.440
Well, get him with the music.

01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:00.440
That's his spirit.

01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:02.440
That's what he needs.

01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:04.440
In 1121,

01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:06.440
Johanna spun fucking face.

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:08.440
I wanted to make gold.

01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:10.440
Sorry.

01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:12.440
Sorry.

01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:14.440
They did.

01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:16.440
They wanted to make gold.

01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:18.440
That's right.

01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:20.440
It's true.

01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:22.440
That's a secret.

01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:24.440
Add a little truth.

01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:26.440
So he bought himself five dozen buckets.

01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:32.440
Using an ancient tome,

01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:34.440
he lined the buckets up in his basement

01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:36.440
in a nice grid.

01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:38.440
And then he peed in them.

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:42.440
It smelled.

01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:44.440
He had asparagus that night,

01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:46.440
but that's what happens.

01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:48.440
But six weeks later,

01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:50.440
that urine had evaporated

01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:52.440
and left a sticky yellow residue.

01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:56.440
Sadly, it didn't turn into gold,

01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:58.440
but that cologne

01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:00.440
kept the ladies away for decades.

01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:04.440
I'm Aaron Mankey,

01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:06.440
and you pulled out.

01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:08.440
You pulled out.

01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:10.440
It's good.

01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:12.440
I mean, you've got the weapon

01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:14.440
that it is your real voice.

01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:16.440
So you can...

01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:18.440
It's just fun to listen to it.

01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:20.440
All right.

01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:22.440
These people paid a lot of...

01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:24.440
They paid top dollar,

01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:26.440
especially on a toilet maker's salary.

01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:30.440
The money these people paid tonight,

01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:32.440
they're definitely entitled

01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:34.440
to D&D, right?

01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:40.440
Let's bring out Steve Levy, everybody.

01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:42.440
Steve Levy.

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:48.440
All right.

01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:50.440
Hey.

01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:50.440
Just trying to accommodate.

01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:52.440
Aaron, are you going to stay around?

01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:54.440
Are you going to stick around with us?

01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:54.440
Play a little D&D with us, maybe?

01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:56.440
Sure.

01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:56.440
All right.

01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:58.440
You can be Barony Mack.

01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:00.440
Okay, good.

01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:02.440
Would you stay and play the character

01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:04.440
of Barony Mack?

01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:06.440
He's a bear that was

01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:08.440
brought into existence.

01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:08.440
Of course I would.

01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:10.440
Because good things come in bears.

01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:12.440
Yes, they do.

01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:14.440
Oh, damn.

01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:18.440
In 1967,

01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:20.440
a bear was found unconscious,

01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:22.440
filled with semen.

01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:24.440
Its lungs collapsed

01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:26.440
from crying for help.

01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:28.440
All right.

01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:30.440
So, I don't know if you guys are...

01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:32.440
I don't know where

01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:34.440
our boundaries are,

01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:36.440
but I keep...

01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:38.440
Every time we brush up against each other,

01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:40.440
I find myself respecting you guys more.

01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:42.440
I haven't...

01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:44.440
Every time you guys are like,

01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:46.440
ah, or boo,

01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:48.440
you should get that right, I'm like,

01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:50.440
these guys are good people.

01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:52.440
It's good to have

01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:54.440
that much curation of the fallout franchise.

01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:56.440
It's...

01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:58.440
It's good to take civic pride.

01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:00.440
I really...

01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:02.440
I want to impart that to you.

01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:04.440
I'm leaving improved.

01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:06.440
I'm sorry, I soiled you tonight.

01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:08.440
I do like you.

01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:16.440
It doesn't sound the same as it does

01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:18.440
in your skull, that's all I can tell you.

01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:20.440
To you, it sounds like crystal clear.

01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:22.440
Up here,

01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:24.440
it's just...

01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:30.440
All right, now, Spencer,

01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:32.440
for those of you who are up today on it,

01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:34.440
we found Patchen's Gem last time,

01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:36.440
which might have...

01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:38.440
Yeah.

01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:40.440
Yeah, we did.

01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:42.440
The church militant

01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:44.440
of the Silver Flame,

01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:46.440
we finally did something right.

01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:48.440
Spencer,

01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:50.440
we might be embarking on a new

01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:52.440
journey possible, all right?

01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:54.440
We might just.

01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:56.440
All right, so we got...

01:47:56.440 --> 01:47:58.440
I'm Chad the Fire Liker.

01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:00.440
We got Garry Shandling, the Shambling Mound, we got...

01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:04.440
We got Diarrhea Jr.

01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:06.440
And you're going to be a...

01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:08.440
You're a talking sentient bear.

01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:10.440
All bears are probably sentient,

01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:12.440
but you're a talking sentient bear.

01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:14.440
And your name is Bearney Mack.

01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:16.440
The green one's for Rob.

01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:18.440
Bearney Mack?

01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:20.440
You can't get one, unfortunately.

01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:22.440
You have bear powers, and...

01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:24.440
If you want to do stuff, you know...

01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:26.440
Didn't Bearney Mack get some extra

01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:28.440
feature of power last time?

01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:30.440
What's my AC?

01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:32.440
17.

01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:34.440
Okay.

01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:36.440
Am I wearing armor?

01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:38.440
No.

01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:40.440
But yeah, Bearney Mack

01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:42.440
or James Addomean called him

01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:44.440
Irr-signed Wells,

01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:46.440
something like that.

01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:48.440
Okay, hey guys, how's it going?

01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:50.440
Great.

01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:52.440
Awesome.

01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:54.440
Last time

01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:56.440
on Harmontown.

01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:58.440
Yeah!

01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:00.440
Our heroes.

01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:02.440
Where were they?

01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:04.440
They were in that town.

01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:06.440
Dornester.

01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:08.440
Dornester on the quest for Patchen's Gem.

01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:10.440
They tried,

01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:12.440
not very hard.

01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:14.440
They gave up easily,

01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:16.440
and DJ went back at it

01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:18.440
and got captured.

01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:20.440
Sensing imminent defeat,

01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:22.440
our heroes leapt into action

01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:24.440
and went to rescue DJ.

01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:26.440
And they found a fight.

01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:28.440
Oh, they fought. Jeff turned into a tree.

01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:30.440
A bear showed up.

01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:32.440
A dwarf with a whiffleball

01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:34.440
teleported people outside of the building.

01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:36.440
After all was said and done,

01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:38.440
they had a hostage.

01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:40.440
They interrogated the hostage,

01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:42.440
and that led them to

01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:44.440
a big farm.

01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:46.440
At the farm, our heroes were

01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:48.440
interrogated by the mute Boykin Hodge

01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:50.440
and with his help,

01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:52.440
they found the stable they were looking for.

01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:54.440
And the gem,

01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:56.440
that was Patchen's.

01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:58.440
But then they were attacked

01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:00.440
by that very same man,

01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:02.440
who turned out to be a vampire.

01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:04.440
He was easily killed.

01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:06.440
What'll happen next?

01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:08.440
Find out now

01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:13.440
on Harmon Time.

01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:20.440
Okay, sorry everybody.

01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:23.440
So, you're in Boykin Hodge's big stables.

01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:25.440
You just killed him and he exploded

01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:27.440
into dust and skeletons after being

01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:29.440
staked by Garry Shandling's fingers.

01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:32.440
Dust and skeletons

01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:35.440
he exploded into.

01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:37.440
Yeah, multiple.

01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:39.440
Multiple dusts.

01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:41.440
I collected the dust

01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:43.440
and put it in my glass jar.

01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:45.440
Thank you very much, DJ.

01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:47.440
That's very nice.

01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:49.440
You know, before, sorry.

01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:51.440
No, you go.

01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:53.440
That's not sarcasm.

01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:55.440
You know, before...

01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:57.440
But that was...

01:50:57.440 --> 01:50:59.440
Before killing this vampire,

01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:01.440
I was having second thoughts

01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:03.440
about whether or not we were good

01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:05.440
or bad people.

01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:07.440
I'm a monster, but, you know,

01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:10.440
I'm also a decent person.

01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:12.440
So, I, you know,

01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:14.440
but we did some good work here,

01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:16.440
or pretty much just me,

01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:18.440
but there was a good things here

01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:20.440
because this vampire probably

01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:22.440
would have hurt some other people

01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:24.440
and creating more vampires,

01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:26.440
which would hurt other people.

01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:29.440
So, you're welcome.

01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:31.440
I'm gonna stick around, I'm thinking.

01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:33.440
Oh, stick around.

01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:35.440
Are you currently holding the gem?

01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:36.440
Do you have it, Carlos?

01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:37.440
Let's say Carlos, yeah.

01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:39.440
Yeah, we were thinking about

01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:41.440
putting it in Barony Max,

01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:43.440
but because...

01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:45.440
I should hold it because I killed the vampire,

01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:46.440
so just...

01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:47.440
I support that.

01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:48.440
Thank you.

01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:49.440
Thank you, Bear.

01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:51.440
You know, they say if you take a gem

01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:53.440
and you put some blood and some jizz on it,

01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:55.440
you put it up a bear's ass.

01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:57.440
I don't know what they say.

01:51:57.440 --> 01:51:59.440
I just...

01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:02.440
I am gonna hold on to it.

01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:05.440
But you didn't kill the vampire.

01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:07.440
No, he's kind of a George for part of our A-team.

01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:09.440
I say we let him...

01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:11.440
I just think...

01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:12.440
I just...

01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:14.440
You're an outlier.

01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:18.440
An outlier?

01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:21.440
I don't know what...

01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:23.440
All right, here's the gem.

01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:26.440
Thank you.

01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:30.440
But it's not a...

01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:32.440
It's...

01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:34.440
You understand it's not for comedy.

01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:36.440
It's like we've been looking for it for a long time.

01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:39.440
Why would it be for comedy if we've been...

01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:41.440
I just put it in my leaf.

01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:43.440
I know, it's just not a bit.

01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:45.440
You seem to be made of bits.

01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:46.440
I don't know...

01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:48.440
I'm giving a gem to a guy that's like

01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:50.440
made of bits.

01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:52.440
Bits of...

01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:53.440
Of comedy.

01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:54.440
I don't know...

01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:56.440
Do you even have pockets?

01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:57.440
You're like...

01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:59.440
I'm a shambling mound.

01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:01.440
Pockets of stuff all over the place.

01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:03.440
It's like falling off of you.

01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:05.440
If Autumn comes, does the gem...

01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:06.440
No, give it...

01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:07.440
Here, take it.

01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:08.440
What's in your pockets?

01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:09.440
Take it.

01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:10.440
What's in your pockets?

01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:11.440
No, wait.

01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:12.440
Take it.

01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:13.440
Take it back.

01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:14.440
Since you...

01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:15.440
No, no.

01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:16.440
See...

01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:17.440
I don't want it.

01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:18.440
Fine.

01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:19.440
It's on the ground.

01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:20.440
Great.

01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:22.440
I pick it up and put it in my glass jar.

01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:23.440
Okay.

01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:25.440
Aaron, is this how you play D&D?

01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:26.440
This is how you do it?

01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:27.440
Well, there's always the one guy

01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:29.440
who picks everything up and puts it in the glass jar.

01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:30.440
And the audience and everything?

01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:31.440
Yeah.

01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:32.440
Okay.

01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:33.440
All right, so do we need to...

01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:35.440
Wait, what's in your pockets?

01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:36.440
Thank you.

01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:37.440
Leaves.

01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:38.440
More leaves.

01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:40.440
How many pockets of leaves do you have?

01:53:40.440 --> 01:53:41.440
All of them.

01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:42.440
I don't know.

01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:44.440
Are you just a big pocket of leaves?

01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:45.440
Yeah.

01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:47.440
So why do you have pockets of leaves?

01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:48.440
What are...

01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:50.440
Okay, you know,

01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:52.440
let's just move on from this.

01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:53.440
He's got it.

01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:55.440
I thought I, you know,

01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:57.440
you appreciated what I did,

01:53:57.440 --> 01:53:58.440
but you didn't.

01:53:58.440 --> 01:53:59.440
So it doesn't matter.

01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:00.440
It doesn't matter.

01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:01.440
You don't have to appreciate...

01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:02.440
No, we need to...

01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:03.440
Do we need to find Patchens

01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:05.440
and return this gem to Patchens?

01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:07.440
What a great question.

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:09.440
Why were you finding Patchens, Jim?

01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:11.440
Do you guys remember?

01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:13.440
Well, because we felt guilty

01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:16.440
because we got waylaid by bandits on the road

01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:18.440
and they took Patchens' gem.

01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:20.440
Right, and so you're getting it for him.

01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:21.440
Yes.

01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:22.440
So we have to...

01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:24.440
We have to get this back to Patchens.

01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:25.440
Yeah.

01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:26.440
We have to get this back to you,

01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:27.440
but yeah, kinda.

01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:28.440
Yeah, I mean...

01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:30.440
All right, let's go find Patchens.

01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:32.440
Okay, so last time you saw Patchens,

01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:34.440
he was in the town before it caught fire.

01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:36.440
All right, let's go back to town.

01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:38.440
The fire's probably out by now.

01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:39.440
It's not.

01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:40.440
You can see it from the farm,

01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:41.440
but it's still going.

01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:44.440
All right, well, let's go sneak into town.

01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:46.440
There's probably a big commotion going on.

01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:47.440
How did the fire start?

01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:48.440
Wait, do we have any enemies

01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:49.440
that are still outstanding?

01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:51.440
Well, the whole town, yeah.

01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:53.440
Yeah, but it's sort of like...

01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:54.440
Okay.

01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:55.440
They're dealing with shit.

01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:58.440
All right, so should we just let that sort itself out?

01:54:58.440 --> 01:54:59.440
Yeah, I don't know.

01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:00.440
Sometimes I hear true crime podcasts,

01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:01.440
or it's like, you know,

01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:02.440
someone disappears on 9.10,

01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:04.440
and then it's like...

01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:07.440
You know, like, it's part of the fucking thing.

01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:09.440
It's like, then 9.11 happened,

01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:10.440
and then like...

01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:12.440
I'm saying, like, they're undergoing a thing

01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:13.440
in that town right now

01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:17.440
where we could probably relax the law a little bit.

01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:18.440
Like, we don't...

01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:20.440
Are you saying we go back or we don't go back?

01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:21.440
I'm saying we go back.

01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:23.440
I'm saying we go back.

01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:24.440
No need for disguises.

01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:26.440
I'm pretty sure people have their hands full.

01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:27.440
I feel comfort.

01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:28.440
Okay, cool.

01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:31.440
Let's just grab a couple TVs on our way in.

01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:32.440
Yeah, yeah.

01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:34.440
How far away is the town?

01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:35.440
Can we see?

01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:36.440
You're technically in the town.

01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:38.440
You're just in like the farming area.

01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:39.440
So we're already here.

01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:40.440
Yeah, but it's like,

01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:42.440
the fire is on the other side of the town,

01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:43.440
so that's why you can see it,

01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:45.440
and you're not like in a fire right now.

01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:46.440
Okay.

01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:47.440
All right.

01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:48.440
So let's go walk in

01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:50.440
and start our Patchen's hunt.

01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:51.440
Okay.

01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:52.440
Just look around for him.

01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:53.440
Yeah.

01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:55.440
Or shamble around for him.

01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:58.440
Thank you.

01:55:58.440 --> 01:55:59.440
Don't you have a little song

01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:01.440
that you can sing when you shamble?

01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:05.440
I'm Gary's shamblin' mountain

01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:08.440
shamblin' through this side of town

01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:12.440
it's on fire.

01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:14.440
All right, so we're walkin' through the town, Spencer.

01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:15.440
Let's go ahead.

01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:16.440
All right.

01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:18.440
Shamblin' on the shamblin'

01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:19.440
You're walkin' through the town

01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:21.440
and most of the people aren't around.

01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:22.440
It's kind of night,

01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:24.440
and so it's like late night,

01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:25.440
but everyone,

01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:26.440
you can hear a commotion coming from the fire.

01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:28.440
It seems like everyone's working together

01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:29.440
to try to put out the fire.

01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:32.440
Hey, are they doing an okay job?

01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:33.440
You can't quite see him

01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:34.440
because you're still like,

01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:36.440
there's rows of houses and buildings

01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:37.440
that are interposing your vision.

01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:38.440
Why don't we go act like,

01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:39.440
let's go lend a hand.

01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:40.440
Let's like play ball with these people.

01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:41.440
Okay.

01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:42.440
Or what?

01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:43.440
It's a little sociopathic.

01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:46.440
We could be the town's heroes.

01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:47.440
Town's on fire.

01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:48.440
Okay.

01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:49.440
You win back their favor.

01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:50.440
Excuse me.

01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:51.440
All right.

01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:52.440
Well, maybe it's a good way

01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:53.440
to look for passion.

01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:54.440
How are they putting out the fire

01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:55.440
with like sand?

01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:56.440
You can't see

01:56:56.440 --> 01:56:57.440
because you're not looking.

01:56:57.440 --> 01:56:58.440
Let's go check it out.

01:56:58.440 --> 01:56:59.440
The town has a well.

01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:00.440
Yeah, it has a well.

01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:01.440
I'm going to run to the well

01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:02.440
and look for a bucket.

01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:03.440
Okay.

01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:04.440
You run to the well

01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:05.440
and there's no buckets.

01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:06.440
There's a hole,

01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:07.440
like what do you call it,

01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:08.440
like a citizen's ladder.

01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:09.440
They're stationed from the well

01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:10.440
all the way to the fire

01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:11.440
and they're very engaged

01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:12.440
in passing water.

01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:13.440
Can I help?

01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:14.440
Oh, yeah.

01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:15.440
They look at you

01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:16.440
and wave you over

01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:17.440
and immediately insinuate you

01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:18.440
into their lines.

01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:20.440
So this town has cooked this.

01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:21.440
It's such a crisis

01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:23.440
that they're okay with a bear

01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:24.440
coming in.

01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:25.440
No, Bearney Mack.

01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:26.440
Like any part in a storm.

01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:27.440
Just to be...

01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:29.440
Bearney Mack is a fixture

01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:30.440
around town.

01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:31.440
Oh, okay.

01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:32.440
All right.

01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:33.440
He's like a town mascot.

01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:35.440
Could you bear some more help?

01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:36.440
Everyone's laughing.

01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:38.440
They're fucking loving this shit.

01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:39.440
Okay.

01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:40.440
But he's not the bear

01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:41.440
that was in charge

01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:42.440
of fire prevention, right?

01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:43.440
Because...

01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:44.440
Okay.

01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:45.440
No, different bear.

01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:46.440
Wait, no.

01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:47.440
Because if I was smoky,

01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:48.440
the bear showed up to like

01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:49.440
help put out a fire.

01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:50.440
I'd be like,

01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:51.440
fuck you.

01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:52.440
Where were you?

01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:56.440
This shouldn't have happened.

01:57:56.440 --> 01:57:58.440
Am I immune to fire

01:57:58.440 --> 01:57:59.440
because I have all these

01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:00.440
fire things?

01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:01.440
You have some resistance.

01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:02.440
Yeah.

01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:03.440
I mean,

01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:04.440
maybe I can put my fire

01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:05.440
abilities to use here.

01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:06.440
Yeah, I mean...

01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:07.440
You can fight fire with fire.

01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:08.440
That is what started the fire.

01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:09.440
Right, right.

01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:10.440
I've heard that extent.

01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:11.440
Okay.

01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:12.440
I go...

01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:13.440
I go,

01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:14.440
everybody,

01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:15.440
just everybody,

01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:16.440
what are you doing?

01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:17.440
I walk up and I say,

01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:18.440
I'm not a big scientist.

01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:19.440
I work for the church.

01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:21.440
I have the silver flame.

01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:24.440
But I go up to a building on fire

01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:28.440
and I shoot fire in a ring

01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:29.440
around the fire

01:58:29.440 --> 01:58:31.440
to consume the oxygen

01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:32.440
around it

01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:33.440
and smother the fire.

01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:35.440
What spell is that?

01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:36.440
Backdraft.

01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:38.440
Produce flame.

01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:40.440
Produce flame.

01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:41.440
Not enough fire.

01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:42.440
You can try that.

01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:43.440
Okay, hang on.

01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:46.440
Let me... God damn it.

01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:47.440
So...

01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:48.440
Can he control the fire

01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:49.440
with his powers?

01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:50.440
Produce flame...

01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:51.440
I mean, a little tiny bit.

01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:52.440
Like, control fire

01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:53.440
is a different spell to fire,

01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:54.440
you know what I'm saying?

01:58:54.440 --> 01:58:55.440
Do you have control?

01:58:55.440 --> 01:58:56.440
Okay, I do this.

01:58:56.440 --> 01:58:58.440
It's kind of a trick.

01:58:58.440 --> 01:58:59.440
I do produce flames

01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:00.440
so I have a fireball.

01:59:00.440 --> 01:59:01.440
I can create a fireball

01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:02.440
in my hand, right?

01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:03.440
Yeah, yeah.

01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:04.440
So I go,

01:59:04.440 --> 01:59:05.440
I'm gonna get rid of this fire

01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:06.440
in my way

01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:07.440
and I go in

01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:08.440
and I get close to the fire

01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:09.440
and then produce a flame

01:59:09.440 --> 01:59:10.440
and then run off with it

01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:12.440
and throw it down the well.

01:59:12.440 --> 01:59:15.440
You don't even care about the actual...

01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:18.440
I keep running back and forth

01:59:18.440 --> 01:59:20.440
and just like...

01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:23.440
I'm digging a hole.

01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:25.440
He's a centrist.

01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:27.440
That's what they call him, right?

01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:29.440
Yeah, donut.

01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:36.440
You're almost immediately recognized

01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:38.440
as the guy who started the fire.

01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:41.440
Remember that?

01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:44.440
Yeah.

01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:45.440
What happens?

01:59:45.440 --> 01:59:46.440
What are they saying?

01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:47.440
They start pointing you out

01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:49.440
because you're kind of running fast

01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:51.440
and they're all very busy.

01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:52.440
But you start to notice people

01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:54.440
who aren't involved in firefighting

01:59:54.440 --> 01:59:57.440
start to cluster and accumulate around you.

01:59:57.440 --> 02:00:00.440
I quietly walk backward away from him.

02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:01.440
All right.

02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:04.440
The only person with the rapport

02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:08.440
with the town exits the situation.

02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:10.440
I think that's a smart move.

02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:13.440
All right, so, yeah,

02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:15.440
it looks like people are sizing you up

02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:18.440
maybe to attack you

02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:21.440
or to call the police or something.

02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:24.440
Oh, it is in these times of trial by fire

02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:26.440
that we must consult the silver flames

02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:28.440
teachings on the matter.

02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:31.440
For non-silver flame

02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:34.440
is always the result of friction

02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:37.440
and friction comes from fear of fire

02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:40.440
such that fire will consume the earth

02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:43.440
if the silver flame is not acquiesced to.

02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:45.440
And what is the silver flame?

02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:49.440
But love, acceptance, acquiescence,

02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:53.440
water even is more silverflamey

02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:55.440
than orangeflamey.

02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:59.440
I sneak to the back of the crowd

02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:01.440
while he's talking.

02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:02.440
I go,

02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:05.440
sounds like a pretty good idea.

02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:08.440
I like what he's saying.

02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:11.440
Give him a chance to talk.

02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:14.440
You're a great distraction

02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:16.440
and everyone turns to look at you

02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:18.440
because you're a giant monster trying to like

02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:21.440
pretend to be various nondescript people.

02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:23.440
It doesn't mean I don't believe what...

02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:25.440
No matter your neighbor, whoever you live near

02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:29.440
be they bear or shambling mound

02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:31.440
or human or out of towner

02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:35.440
or mischievous darting flame wizard person.

02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:37.440
All of us must work together.

02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:39.440
In a war worth fighting

02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:41.440
you will find yourselves shoulder to shoulder

02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:42.440
with those you mistrust

02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:45.440
or else the war is no war at all.

02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:47.440
For it is the real orange flame

02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:49.440
that we must put out now

02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:51.440
with love and accepting everyone

02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:54.440
absolutely unconditionally.

02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:56.440
Fire is the real enemy.

02:01:56.440 --> 02:01:57.440
Fire is the real enemy.

02:01:57.440 --> 02:01:58.440
Fire is the real enemy.

02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:00.440
If something's not actively on fire

02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:03.440
it's not worth paying attention to.

02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:05.440
At this particular time

02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:08.440
your other conflicts will keep.

02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:10.440
You could jump on somebody and say

02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:12.440
hey, you offended me.

02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:13.440
That was microaggressive.

02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:17.440
After we beat these Nazis

02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:19.440
there's a town on fire.

02:02:19.440 --> 02:02:21.440
Water it.

02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:22.440
Water the fire.

02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:23.440
Water it.

02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:24.440
Water it.

02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:25.440
Fire.

02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:26.440
Water with water.

02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:27.440
Water.

02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:28.440
Isn't that...

02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:30.440
That seems like the opposite of what you were saying

02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:32.440
up till that point.

02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:34.440
I may have digressed.

02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:36.440
As Carlos was giving that speech

02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:38.440
I'm sneaking around the crowd

02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:39.440
trying to see if I can find

02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:41.440
patches in the crowd.

02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:44.440
You're still pretty recognizable.

02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:45.440
I'm also looking around though

02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:47.440
and everybody likes me.

02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:49.440
Everyone's loving it.

02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:50.440
To create a distraction

02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:51.440
I go to the center of everybody

02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:53.440
I throw my shield down

02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:54.440
kick out my sword

02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:55.440
and just start doing the craziest

02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:57.440
fucking dance I could think of.

02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:00.440
There are now five distractions.

02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:03.440
Hey look at that guy dance.

02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:04.440
How about a sixth?

02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:07.440
You hear the pounding of hook beats on pavement

02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:09.440
the familiar sound of a horse with a rider

02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:11.440
and on that horse

02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:12.440
you hear a voice ring out

02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:15.440
a familiar voice from a grizzled old man.

02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:17.440
This is what happens to those

02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:19.440
who spurn the flames light.

02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:20.440
It's Geffen.

02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:21.440
He's wearing brown armor

02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:23.440
and he's wheeled in a big flaming mace

02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:25.440
and he's bashing it into wooden structures

02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:26.440
and setting fires.

02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:27.440
What?

02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:29.440
Dungeons and Dragons fans will remember

02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:33.440
Geffen from episode 241

02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:36.440
Excelsior!

02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:38.440
Refresh my memory on Geffen.

02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:39.440
He's just a guy you know.

02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:40.440
Okay.

02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:41.440
Is he friend or foe?

02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:43.440
He's a friend generally.

02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:45.440
He feels like he toes the line though.

02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:47.440
Oh doesn't it?

02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:49.440
Was he friends with Patchens?

02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:50.440
No he doesn't.

02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:52.440
He knows who Patchens is.

02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:54.440
But anyway he's like lighting more fires

02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:56.440
and he rides his horse

02:03:56.440 --> 02:03:58.440
through the line of Volunteer Fireman

02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:00.440
and smashes one in the head with a flaming mace.

02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:02.440
Oh Geffen why?

02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:03.440
This is what happens to those

02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:05.440
who spurn the flames light.

02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:06.440
Alright.

02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:07.440
Alright Geffen.

02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:09.440
Dan you flash back to a moment

02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:11.440
on your prior campaign of the Eldine reaches

02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:13.440
when you and Geffen were also

02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:15.440
lighting villages on fire.

02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:18.440
But now you feel worse about it

02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:20.440
because like it seems fucked up

02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:21.440
like in the present.

02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:22.440
God.

02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:24.440
Vietnam.

02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:28.440
Yeah.

02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:29.440
Shit.

02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:30.440
This is like what you used to be doing

02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:32.440
but you know it was a good thing

02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:33.440
when you were doing it back then

02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:34.440
and now it's like you don't like

02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:35.440
that it's happening.

02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:36.440
Alright.

02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:38.440
Hey Geffen.

02:04:38.440 --> 02:04:40.440
Come on.

02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:43.440
I heard you preaching.

02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:45.440
Is that not what you were doing?

02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:46.440
You wanted more fire?

02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:47.440
No.

02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:49.440
Fuck.

02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:50.440
He rides off.

02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:52.440
You were doing that because of...

02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:53.440
No no he doesn't.

02:04:53.440 --> 02:04:54.440
Sorry.

02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:55.440
He doesn't.

02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:56.440
He doesn't ride off.

02:04:56.440 --> 02:04:57.440
That's funny.

02:04:57.440 --> 02:04:59.440
Is he really doing it because of me?

02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:00.440
Well yeah.

02:05:00.440 --> 02:05:01.440
Because you know I...

02:05:01.440 --> 02:05:03.440
You might not remember this about your character

02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:05.440
but you used to be like this fucked up guy

02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:06.440
who did a lot of shitty shit.

02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:07.440
I still am.

02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:08.440
Yeah.

02:05:08.440 --> 02:05:09.440
And so like...

02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:11.440
So like this guy was a partner in crime.

02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:12.440
You know?

02:05:12.440 --> 02:05:13.440
He's like your foil maybe?

02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:14.440
I don't know.

02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:15.440
You know.

02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:17.440
But I was trying to make a distinction

02:05:17.440 --> 02:05:20.440
between the real fire

02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:22.440
and the silver flame

02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:24.440
which is actually not real fire.

02:05:24.440 --> 02:05:25.440
Well it is.

02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:26.440
The fire is very real.

02:05:26.440 --> 02:05:27.440
It's inflanky.

02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:29.440
I know the fire is very real

02:05:29.440 --> 02:05:31.440
but the kind that needs to be put out

02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:33.440
is not the kind that you use to put it out

02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:35.440
which is the flame of faith.

02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:37.440
I was trying to split a hair

02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:39.440
to get my friends from being arrested

02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:44.440
and Geffen, bad time for the geffer.

02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:45.440
Yeah.

02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:52.440
Geffen, dial it back.

02:05:54.440 --> 02:05:55.440
Well now he rides off.

02:05:55.440 --> 02:05:56.440
Okay.

02:05:56.440 --> 02:05:57.440
All right.

02:05:57.440 --> 02:05:58.440
Sorry.

02:05:58.440 --> 02:05:59.440
That's...

02:05:59.440 --> 02:06:00.440
No need to apologize.

02:06:00.440 --> 02:06:02.440
It was weird.

02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:03.440
What a weird...

02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:04.440
Yeah.

02:06:04.440 --> 02:06:05.440
I call out

02:06:05.440 --> 02:06:07.440
because now the jig is up anyway.

02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:09.440
I call out Patchens.

02:06:09.440 --> 02:06:10.440
All right.

02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:11.440
You hear no response.

02:06:11.440 --> 02:06:12.440
Actually maybe we did commit to it.

02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:13.440
Now I'm thinking,

02:06:13.440 --> 02:06:16.440
why am I trying to be a good person?

02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:19.440
I thought you said we were the good guys.

02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:23.440
Maybe that's not what this town deserves.

02:06:26.440 --> 02:06:28.440
And it seems like everything we do

02:06:28.440 --> 02:06:30.440
we end up being the bad guys.

02:06:30.440 --> 02:06:31.440
Okay.

02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:32.440
I'm just starting to think

02:06:32.440 --> 02:06:34.440
I'm remembering my previous life with Geffen

02:06:34.440 --> 02:06:35.440
and I'm like,

02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:38.440
oh yeah, actually we were good at one thing.

02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:40.440
Burning towns

02:06:40.440 --> 02:06:42.440
and murdering people.

02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:44.440
Making people understand that it was God

02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:46.440
that was doing it to them.

02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:47.440
So we should,

02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:50.440
instead of trying to put the fire out,

02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:53.440
we should put the fire on.

02:06:53.440 --> 02:06:54.440
Okay.

02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:55.440
I like fire.

02:06:57.440 --> 02:06:58.440
He said he likes it.

02:06:58.440 --> 02:06:59.440
He doesn't say he lights it.

02:06:59.440 --> 02:07:00.440
Oh yeah.

02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:01.440
Yeah.

02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:02.440
You're still looking...

02:07:02.440 --> 02:07:03.440
I know.

02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:04.440
Are you applying as a attention master?

02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:06.440
Have I had a change of heart?

02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:07.440
Or are you just saying...

02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:08.440
That was my understanding

02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:10.440
is that you met like Steve and Geffen.

02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:11.440
Right.

02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:13.440
This is not what the church is for.

02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:14.440
I'm the right person

02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:16.440
and I'm going to change the church from the inside.

02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:17.440
Okay.

02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:18.440
Well that's cool.

02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:19.440
That's an arc.

02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:20.440
I hope so.

02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:22.440
The fact that we keep doing this

02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:24.440
is fine, it's forgivable

02:07:24.440 --> 02:07:26.440
and it's actually just admirable

02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:28.440
that I don't want to do it anymore.

02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:30.440
Did Geffen really ride off?

02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:31.440
Yeah.

02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:33.440
He seemed kind of embarrassed

02:07:33.440 --> 02:07:35.440
but also he really enjoyed it

02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:37.440
and he looked bad in front of you

02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:39.440
by doing the wrong thing

02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:40.440
but he thought it was the right...

02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:41.440
You know?

02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:42.440
Does he really respect me that much?

02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:44.440
No, he just thought that it was killing time.

02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:45.440
Oh.

02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:47.440
And he really bases that on me?

02:07:47.440 --> 02:07:48.440
Well he heard you preaching.

02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:49.440
He might have heard you...

02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:50.440
He might have heard you about as good

02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:51.440
as I was listening.

02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:52.440
Hmm.

02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:55.440
Which I apparently misinterpreted

02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:56.440
some of your words

02:07:56.440 --> 02:07:59.440
and saw you were inciting violence.

02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:01.440
Wait, but you also thought

02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:04.440
that my arc was that I was becoming better

02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:05.440
than I wanted to be better

02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:06.440
so then didn't you think it was odd

02:08:06.440 --> 02:08:09.440
that I was preaching to burn the town?

02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:11.440
That's what it seemed like

02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:13.440
but I thought you were being a distraction.

02:08:13.440 --> 02:08:14.440
I didn't think you were earnest about it.

02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:16.440
You were just trying to be distracting.

02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:18.440
I didn't get that you wanted to burn the town down.

02:08:18.440 --> 02:08:20.440
He was talking about how great fire was.

02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:23.440
You wanted to purify it with the fire of righteousness.

02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:25.440
I'm not saying that I heard him accurately.

02:08:25.440 --> 02:08:26.440
I'm saying I didn't hear him.

02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:29.440
I thought you were about to get lynched

02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:32.440
and then he was coming in to stop.

02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:34.440
You know what real fire would do?

02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:35.440
Fire would fight fire

02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:37.440
and understand that people that look like

02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:39.440
they started the fire are probably just firefighters.

02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:41.440
So that's what happened ten minutes ago.

02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:42.440
Yeah.

02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:44.440
It was probably fifteen minutes ago.

02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:45.440
I have a question.

02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:46.440
Yeah.

02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:47.440
Can we attack something?

02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:48.440
Yeah, yeah.

02:08:48.440 --> 02:08:49.440
Awesome.

02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:50.440
You could attack the people.

02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:52.440
No, there's no real monsters.

02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:54.440
I attacked these waffles.

02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:55.440
Patches!

02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:56.440
Patches!

02:08:56.440 --> 02:08:58.440
Where is Patches?

02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:00.440
Yeah, Patches is not around.

02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:01.440
God damn it.

02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:02.440
Has anyone seen Patches?

02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:04.440
Are there any buildings not on fire?

02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:06.440
Yeah, Shrove's house.

02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:07.440
Let's go there.

02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:08.440
Let's go check inside.

02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:09.440
Yeah.

02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:12.440
The barren shambling mound go to Shrove's house.

02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:13.440
You go to Shrove's house.

02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:14.440
It's empty.

02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:15.440
No one's home.

02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:16.440
I just want to hang behind and say,

02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:19.440
my brothers and sisters that aren't fighting the fire,

02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:22.440
I am on a quest for the Church of the Silver Flame.

02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:25.440
Has anyone seen Patches?

02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:26.440
God.

02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:28.440
No one's really paying too close attention to you.

02:09:28.440 --> 02:09:30.440
They're like attending to the wounded and dead

02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:31.440
and fighting the fire.

02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:34.440
Of the many sins that people can commit

02:09:34.440 --> 02:09:36.440
against the Silver Flame is being distracted.

02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:38.440
One must focus on what's important.

02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:39.440
Geffen comes back.

02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:40.440
I try to get...

02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:42.440
No, no, no, no.

02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:45.440
Geffen is like my Tyler Dyrton.

02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:48.440
He shows off his...

02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:51.440
Hey, Carlos, you want their attention?

02:09:51.440 --> 02:09:53.440
You want their attention?

02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:54.440
I...

02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:55.440
Yes.

02:09:55.440 --> 02:09:56.440
Do you want...

02:09:56.440 --> 02:09:57.440
Yeah.

02:09:57.440 --> 02:09:58.440
No, no, I don't...

02:09:58.440 --> 02:10:00.440
On a human level, what are you planning to do?

02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:01.440
Are we low on time, by the way?

02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:03.440
Are we going to get kicked off stage?

02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:04.440
We have like two minutes.

02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:05.440
Okay, sorry, everybody.

02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:11.440
The red coats come at...

02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:13.440
Yeah, no, we like doing the show.

02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:16.440
Yeah, we're having a great time.

02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:19.440
You would eventually become as bored as us, believe me.

02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:20.440
No, we're having fun.

02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:22.440
So Geffen's back?

02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:23.440
No, no, that was a good joke.

02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:25.440
That was a great joke.

02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:27.440
Okay, what are you...

02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:28.440
No, no, no, what are you trying to...

02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:30.440
I just wanted to find out where Patchens is.

02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:31.440
Yeah, me too.

02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:32.440
Patchens!

02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:33.440
But he's not...

02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:34.440
He's not here.

02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:35.440
I wanted to be...

02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:36.440
He's not here.

02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:37.440
Patchens!

02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:39.440
I thought I would engage them in making a religious thing.

02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:41.440
They're looking through Schrabb's house.

02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:44.440
We're looking for anything that will put out fire.

02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:47.440
I'm a cleric, so I thought I would be religious

02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:48.440
and ask for Patchens.

02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:49.440
Sand.

02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:52.440
But he said that they're not going to pay attention to you

02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:54.440
because they're too busy putting the fire out.

02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:55.440
I found that out.

02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:56.440
Do we find anything?

02:10:56.440 --> 02:10:59.440
You find a bag that looks like it has water symbols on it.

02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:00.440
A bag?

02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:01.440
Yeah, like a sack.

02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:06.440
Hey, hey, Bernie, bag with water symbols on it.

02:11:06.440 --> 02:11:07.440
What do you think?

02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:08.440
It's a bag of water.

02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:10.440
Okay, let's go.

02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:16.440
I ride Bernie Mac into Back to Town,

02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:19.440
waving this bag with water symbols on it.

02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:20.440
Go ahead.

02:11:20.440 --> 02:11:25.440
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:30.440
This is the Breeders' album.

02:11:34.440 --> 02:11:35.440
Okay, so...

02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:40.440
So you're flailing around the bag and drops the water

02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:42.440
and water is spilling out of it.

02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:44.440
It's like a full bucket or something.

02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:45.440
I'm going to go, wow.

02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:47.440
Hey, Bernie, I'm going to start spinning it.

02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:49.440
Do you think you could run in a circle?

02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:51.440
Absolutely.

02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:53.440
Okay, let's give it a shot.

02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:55.440
Whip it around.

02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:57.440
Around the fire.

02:11:57.440 --> 02:11:59.440
Whip it around.

02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:01.440
You know, let's pick a building. Just one building first and try it.

02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:03.440
You're steering, man. I'm whipping.

02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:05.440
I'm whipping it around.

02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:07.440
I'm whipping it around.

02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:09.440
And we're doing,

02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:11.440
percentage-wise, how good of a job?

02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:13.440
Not great. The bag is, like, tied off.

02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:15.440
And so it's not really...

02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:17.440
Oh, okay.

02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:19.440
I untie the bag and then

02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:21.440
we start again.

02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:23.440
Running around, building up your choice.

02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:25.440
You're waving it.

02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:27.440
Whip it around now with the bag untied.

02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:29.440
With the symbols on it, okay?

02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:31.440
It's crazy magic. It's like you're holding the fullest bucket everywhere.

02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:33.440
And every motion just splashes

02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:35.440
hordes of water.

02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:37.440
Ah!

02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:39.440
Ah!

02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:41.440
Join it. Join it.

02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:43.440
Right around.

02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:45.440
How many, like,

02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:47.440
do we do 30 laps?

02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:49.440
Yeah, okay.

02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:51.440
Does that put out the fire?

02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:53.440
Yeah, it takes about 10 minutes, but you put out the building on fire.

02:12:53.440 --> 02:12:55.440
Okay, one building down.

02:12:55.440 --> 02:12:57.440
Yeah, you freed up a lot of real

02:12:57.440 --> 02:12:59.440
estate for firefighters to stand.

02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:01.440
Right, right. Okay.

02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:03.440
All right, next building.

02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:05.440
We do the same thing.

02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:07.440
Ah!

02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:09.440
Ah!

02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:11.440
Patience!

02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:13.440
Okay.

02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:15.440
Do you want to keep doing that?

02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:17.440
Oh, yeah!

02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:19.440
Let's say we've done that. Right, yeah.

02:13:19.440 --> 02:13:21.440
All over town. Yeah. The fire is out.

02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:23.440
It's been two hours.

02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:25.440
Woo!

02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:27.440
You know something, Carlos?

02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:31.440
You're right.

02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:33.440
We are the good guys.

02:13:33.440 --> 02:13:35.440
Cliff Hanger!

02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:37.440
Yeah!

02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:43.440
Thank you, Wilbur. Thank you, Boston.

02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:45.440
Thank you, Massachusetts.

02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:49.440
Rock over, London.

02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:51.440
Let's give it up for Aaron Mankey.

02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:53.440
Weedies, breakfast and champions.

02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:55.440
Tonight, we are all Aaron Mankey.
