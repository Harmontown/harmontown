{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:09.240\nfrom downtown ish, Los Angeles ish, from MacArthur Park and the prestigious stabbing\n\n00:09.240 --> 00:25.560\ndistrict, Harmontown is now in session. Let's welcome Spencer Crittenden in the stage.\n\n00:25.560 --> 00:31.680\nSo thin, so live, only three episodes until you just absolutely evaporate and disappear.\n\n00:31.680 --> 00:38.960\nThat's what everybody wants. I love your little sexy desk. Just for good measure, let's bring\n\n00:38.960 --> 00:50.000\nout the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon. Thank you.\n\n00:50.000 --> 01:04.160\nGod damn it. The text don't go out. Oh, rap, rap, rap. I'm gonna rap about it.\n\n01:04.160 --> 01:12.640\nRap, rap, rap, rap, rap south and rap to the east. I'm gonna rap to your mama's\n\n01:12.640 --> 01:19.640\ncity. That's the feast that love. Put some gravy on it. All right, you know our deal that we made.\n\n01:19.640 --> 01:28.120\nIf it's not going, if it's not working, we stop. I think you came out not really feeling the rap\n\n01:28.120 --> 01:32.600\nlike before this, before it happened. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Here's some other things that came out\n\n01:32.600 --> 01:39.600\nnot feeling. Humanity, like life. I don't care, you know, like I'm fine, but I don't, yeah,\n\n01:39.600 --> 01:46.840\nI'm not, I'm not particularly connected to the brotherhood of man this week. I'm not like\n\n01:46.840 --> 02:16.480\nrooting for anybody. Rob Schrab has taken the stage and sat down, just staring at Dan. Rob Schrab, an unheralded Rob Schrab came out. Hello, Rob, how you doing? Hi, Jeff. Are you feeling humanity right now, Rob? Am I feeling humanity? Dan said he wasn't feeling humanity.\n\n02:16.480 --> 02:26.040\nEspecially not the brotherhood of humanity, which is good because that's a very dangerous cult. You should not worry about them. I don't think I am feeling\n\n02:26.040 --> 02:35.080\nthe brotherhood of humanity. I'm being very isolated lately. It seems like Jeff didn't get what he was instigating. Jeff, do you want to try to\n\n02:35.080 --> 02:56.840\nre-instigate something? Rob didn't respond to that. What I just found out is that you guys both aren't feeling it right now. So that you guys are at Sympaticale. Yeah. What's the worst thing that you saw this week that made you think the best thing you could do is hide from everyone?\n\n02:56.840 --> 03:17.560\nWhat was the worst thing? Yeah, what's the thing? What's an event or something? Well, I got to tell you, this Kavanaugh shit is really bumming me out. I mean, this is where we're at, people. No, I was watching Vine compilations on YouTube and I got really sad.\n\n03:17.560 --> 03:33.840\nBecause Vine's gone? Yeah, I like Vine. Vine was fun. It was good. There were some very, very, very funny things. I know you and I had our disagreements as to when and where it should be listened to.\n\n03:33.840 --> 03:50.840\nYeah, you shouldn't play Vine in a fancy restaurant. No, even if everyone in the room is enjoying it. Everyone at the table. Everyone at the table. Obviously, everyone at the restaurant can't enjoy you playing Vine. That's not, like maybe in a Vine commercial, like, oh, what's going on over there?\n\n03:50.840 --> 04:05.840\nIt's like a Milton Bradley commercial for Vine where, oh, the chef comes out. I was trying to make food, but if someone's playing a Vine at top volume, I'll stop making the food. Well, I was hungry, but I'd rather eat this Vine.\n\n04:05.840 --> 04:22.840\nSo what's the burr in your boot, Harmon? Like, is there anything in particular? I think it was like, like, I had a great week, or a great, what are we talking about? Yeah, I was like, I guess we're going, like, since the last time I saw everybody. Like, it's been great.\n\n04:22.840 --> 04:28.840\nWhat are you doing? You get a fart? Why did you put the microphone in your ass?\n\n04:28.840 --> 04:37.840\nWhat were you, no. You're talking. Why would I interrupt you? Please continue. It's just insane to me. What are you doing?\n\n04:37.840 --> 04:42.840\nI'm not doing anything. Why are you so against humanity?\n\n04:42.840 --> 04:44.840\nWhat are you doing?\n\n04:44.840 --> 04:49.840\nI'm listening to my friend talk on his show.\n\n04:49.840 --> 04:53.840\nYou're putting the microphone under your ass.\n\n04:53.840 --> 05:04.840\nI would have to have something in the chamber to do that, and I'm telling you as a friend, I don't. Please continue with your story.\n\n05:04.840 --> 05:10.840\nHe's not saying you were farting into the mic, but we both heard you drag the microphone up your butt.\n\n05:10.840 --> 05:12.840\nWe all saw it with our eyes.\n\n05:12.840 --> 05:16.840\nI can't help that.\n\n05:16.840 --> 05:24.840\nI don't know where I went sour. I think it was relatively recently. I can work backwards from here and go.\n\n05:24.840 --> 05:33.840\nActually, I got really sour just now backstage because I was scrolling through Instagram, and I followed Mark Hamill on Instagram.\n\n05:33.840 --> 05:36.840\nHe's the best. He should be on the show.\n\n05:36.840 --> 05:37.840\nWe should have him on the show.\n\n05:37.840 --> 05:39.840\nI would love to have him on the show.\n\n05:39.840 --> 05:48.840\nHe's unapologetically, look, I don't think Mark Hamill is out there asking how am I driving in terms of how he's handling being famous.\n\n05:48.840 --> 06:00.840\nObviously, I'm projecting a lot to the guy, but I see him as a guy who has passed a couple of return thresholds into, yes, I'll say it, a return of a kind of Jedi,\n\n06:00.840 --> 06:05.840\nwhere he's like, I got my robot hand, and I don't fucking care.\n\n06:05.840 --> 06:10.840\nI'm throwing down my lightsaber, which to a lot of people means picking one up, but fuck them.\n\n06:10.840 --> 06:14.840\nHe's like, yeah, I'm liberal, and I fucking don't like the president.\n\n06:14.840 --> 06:19.840\nYou're following Mark Hamill, not Luke Skywalker on fucking Instagram.\n\n06:19.840 --> 06:36.840\nI got it. It's like a magnet. Negative stuff is sticky. I want to look through his, because if I see Mark Hamill, he'll Instagram something that's just unapologetically left.\n\n06:36.840 --> 06:42.840\nHe's liberal. I don't like this trunk fella.\n\n06:42.840 --> 06:50.840\nThen it'll say like 6,000 comments, and I'm like, this probably isn't 6,000 people saying, and may the force also be with you.\n\n06:50.840 --> 07:00.840\nI know what it's going to be, and I just have to click on it, and I'm just like, I hate, I hate, I hate everyone.\n\n07:00.840 --> 07:14.840\nI just hate, I hate reality. I hate this fucking like, it's just stupid, just dumb people. Like, why, who cares if you really...\n\n07:14.840 --> 07:16.840\nIs he doing the butt?\n\n07:16.840 --> 07:17.840\nHe was.\n\n07:17.840 --> 07:19.840\nHe was putting the microphone under his ass.\n\n07:19.840 --> 07:21.840\nNo, I'm not. I'm not. I was...\n\n07:21.840 --> 07:23.840\nWhat are you lying? You're lying to people.\n\n07:23.840 --> 07:25.840\nWhat am I lying? I was listening.\n\n07:25.840 --> 07:29.840\nThere's 63 people out here.\n\n07:29.840 --> 07:32.840\nThat can see you sticking a mic under your ass.\n\n07:32.840 --> 07:40.840\nOh, yeah. Yeah, you got busted. You're putting the mic on your butt, and you're doing a microphone butt wipe, and he's talking about Mark Hamill.\n\n07:40.840 --> 07:43.840\nOkay, well, we'll never know.\n\n07:43.840 --> 07:45.840\nThat's not what we agreed to.\n\n07:45.840 --> 07:47.840\nHe's doing a thing.\n\n07:47.840 --> 07:54.840\nYeah, so anyways, it just made me grumpy. I scrolled through it, and I'm just like, it just toxifies.\n\n07:54.840 --> 08:01.840\nI'm just like, ah, God, people are fucking dumb. I just don't like, I don't like people. But it's not, those aren't people.\n\n08:01.840 --> 08:04.840\nIt's like looking at a fish tank at the zoo. You're like, you're not seeing the fish.\n\n08:04.840 --> 08:07.840\nYou're not seeing people? Those are fish.\n\n08:07.840 --> 08:18.840\nIt's like you're seeing people, you're seeing a sample of humanity that were driven to comment on an Instagram of a guy that played Luke Skywalker.\n\n08:18.840 --> 08:20.840\nI don't know why I would choose to do that.\n\n08:20.840 --> 08:23.840\nWhat did you do? Did you successfully...\n\n08:23.840 --> 08:26.840\nHow do we know when you've done what you wanted to do?\n\n08:26.840 --> 08:28.840\nIt depends how the fart sounds.\n\n08:28.840 --> 08:37.840\nI think you think it's going to sound like a fart, and you think a fart is going to be louder than you continually sliding a microphone along fabric.\n\n08:37.840 --> 08:41.840\nIt's going to be, you know, this episode.\n\n08:41.840 --> 08:43.840\nSpencer, are you on my side?\n\n08:43.840 --> 08:47.840\nI'm on the world side.\n\n08:47.840 --> 08:49.840\nBut not humanity's side.\n\n08:49.840 --> 08:52.840\nAre there fish at the zoo, or do you have to go to the aquarium?\n\n08:52.840 --> 08:56.840\nThere's so many fish. It's not a focus, but they're there.\n\n08:56.840 --> 09:00.840\nThey don't stay because the water keeps going through the bars.\n\n09:00.840 --> 09:04.840\nThey have to keep free-filling the cages.\n\n09:04.840 --> 09:08.840\nThey're still trying to figure that out.\n\n09:08.840 --> 09:12.840\nGod damn it, why aren't these fish comfortable in captivity?\n\n09:12.840 --> 09:15.840\nThe monkeys are playing ball. What the fuck, fish?\n\n09:15.840 --> 09:19.840\nEvery zookeeper keeps ordering a cage on Amazon.\n\n09:19.840 --> 09:23.840\nAnd the description with iPhone products is just like...\n\n09:23.840 --> 09:27.840\nGiraffes, hippos, fish, snakes.\n\n09:27.840 --> 09:29.840\nFits all models.\n\n09:29.840 --> 09:33.840\nIn case you're searching for anything, you type snake cage, and they're like,\n\n09:33.840 --> 09:36.840\nhere's a cage, works for snakes. You can fit a snake in there.\n\n09:36.840 --> 09:40.840\nThe snake comes out, bites you.\n\n09:40.840 --> 09:42.840\nI didn't say it worked.\n\n09:42.840 --> 09:44.840\nThe aquarium house...\n\n09:44.840 --> 09:46.840\nIt is a snake cage.\n\n09:46.840 --> 09:50.840\nThe Milwaukee public zoo was my favorite.\n\n09:50.840 --> 09:54.840\nMilwaukee had a relatively good zoo for the size of the city.\n\n09:54.840 --> 09:57.840\nThey called it the aquarium house?\n\n09:57.840 --> 10:00.840\nI don't know. A fish house? I don't know.\n\n10:00.840 --> 10:03.840\nYou said the aquarium house.\n\n10:03.840 --> 10:05.840\nThey probably didn't call it that.\n\n10:05.840 --> 10:08.840\nThey called it the aquarium.\n\n10:08.840 --> 10:13.840\nWhich probably includes a Latin suffix for house.\n\n10:13.840 --> 10:16.840\nEum probably means house.\n\n10:16.840 --> 10:19.840\nIt's an aquarium house.\n\n10:19.840 --> 10:21.840\nOpera house.\n\n10:21.840 --> 10:24.840\nYou're describing an operarium.\n\n10:24.840 --> 10:27.840\nWhat?\n\n10:27.840 --> 10:33.840\nI miss when Rob was using the microphone to make butt sounds.\n\n10:33.840 --> 10:37.840\nIt'll happen again.\n\n10:37.840 --> 10:39.840\nSo did you fart?\n\n10:39.840 --> 10:41.840\nNo, not. You would have.\n\n10:41.840 --> 10:43.840\nI'm just asking.\n\n10:43.840 --> 10:46.840\nI'm getting comfortable. I'm enjoying myself on the show.\n\n10:46.840 --> 10:49.840\nI think you're funnier and less comfortable chairs.\n\n10:49.840 --> 10:53.840\nNow that we've got you these comfy chairs, you're too relaxed.\n\n10:53.840 --> 10:55.840\nI think you're used to dates.\n\n10:55.840 --> 10:58.840\nTalk about what we talked about when you brought up before the show.\n\n10:58.840 --> 11:00.840\nYou want to address that?\n\n11:00.840 --> 11:02.840\nYour anxieties?\n\n11:02.840 --> 11:04.840\nSure. Yeah.\n\n11:04.840 --> 11:07.840\nYou feel like you've been listening to the show.\n\n11:07.840 --> 11:09.840\nI'm bored with my own shit.\n\n11:09.840 --> 11:13.840\nI feel like all I do is come out here and complain.\n\n11:13.840 --> 11:17.840\nMy voice gets to that register that nobody likes.\n\n11:17.840 --> 11:22.840\nI feel like I've got to switch it up a bit.\n\n11:22.840 --> 11:25.840\nThat's why I came out up earlier.\n\n11:25.840 --> 11:28.840\nDude, you're misinterpreting.\n\n11:28.840 --> 11:30.840\nThat is not me.\n\n11:30.840 --> 11:35.840\nI was just stretching.\n\n11:35.840 --> 11:39.840\nI love the idea that you sincerely were like,\n\n11:39.840 --> 11:41.840\nyeah, I'm tired of this shit.\n\n11:41.840 --> 11:43.840\nI'm going to change it up.\n\n11:43.840 --> 11:46.840\nYou changing it up in your eyes is farting into the microphone.\n\n11:46.840 --> 11:48.840\nI didn't, though.\n\n11:48.840 --> 11:53.840\nAs long as I'm not cranky.\n\n11:53.840 --> 12:00.840\nNo, I posted a picture of Tom Kenny and myself from back in the comedy sports days.\n\n12:00.840 --> 12:03.840\nI think it was like 1993.\n\n12:03.840 --> 12:07.840\n1991. No, it was before Skud.\n\n12:07.840 --> 12:10.840\n1991 before Skud.\n\n12:10.840 --> 12:12.840\nIt was a great day.\n\n12:12.840 --> 12:17.840\nThat was the day Tom Kenny gave me this amazing advice about comedy and writing.\n\n12:17.840 --> 12:21.840\nNo one comes up to me and he goes,\n\n12:21.840 --> 12:23.840\nthis is you?\n\n12:23.840 --> 12:26.840\nI was like, yeah, do I look that much different?\n\n12:26.840 --> 12:28.840\nThis guy's smiling.\n\n12:28.840 --> 12:31.840\nHe's got so much hope in his eyes.\n\n12:31.840 --> 12:33.840\nReally? Is that what I'm projecting?\n\n12:33.840 --> 12:40.840\nAnd I guess I am. I'm projecting this hopeless, depressed, sad, angry, pissy, pissy.\n\n12:40.840 --> 12:42.840\nOkay.\n\n12:42.840 --> 12:44.840\nAll right. Okay.\n\n12:44.840 --> 12:47.840\nI don't want that to be me.\n\n12:47.840 --> 12:50.840\nWell, don't you...\n\n12:50.840 --> 12:52.840\nI would interpret that as...\n\n12:52.840 --> 12:54.840\nI love that song, by the way.\n\n12:54.840 --> 12:58.840\nI would interpret that as like Nolan's living in the Shire.\n\n12:58.840 --> 13:01.840\nAnd he's like, oh, I love it when Gandalf comes to visit.\n\n13:01.840 --> 13:04.840\nAnd if you asked the Shire to fill out a survey,\n\n13:04.840 --> 13:06.840\ndon't you think it would come back?\n\n13:06.840 --> 13:09.840\nOn the Shire news today,\n\n13:09.840 --> 13:15.840\n90% of hobbits feel like Gandalf should smile more.\n\n13:15.840 --> 13:17.840\nWell, of course they're going to say that.\n\n13:17.840 --> 13:19.840\nBut I feel like I'm always smiling.\n\n13:19.840 --> 13:21.840\nWell, no, it's the fuck how Gandalf...\n\n13:21.840 --> 13:24.840\nGandalf is happy the way he is,\n\n13:24.840 --> 13:28.840\nand it's like, you don't want to go to the Shire for how you should be a wizard.\n\n13:28.840 --> 13:30.840\nHere's the thing.\n\n13:30.840 --> 13:33.840\nNolan was just saying, like, I can't believe you've become a life master.\n\n13:33.840 --> 13:36.840\nYou have so much power. You could turn a pine cone into a fireball.\n\n13:36.840 --> 13:38.840\nRight.\n\n13:38.840 --> 13:41.840\nThis guy that fights a ball rock and says, you shall not pass.\n\n13:41.840 --> 13:44.840\nIt's crazy that you were once a kid.\n\n13:44.840 --> 13:47.840\nYou made the dawn come early, so things turn into stone.\n\n13:47.840 --> 13:49.840\nI get it.

slowly die I'm pretty I'm pretty sure we don't need\n\n48:50.800 --> 48:55.760\nto like invent a sudden death for me to not have met the deadline of writing up\n\n48:55.760 --> 49:00.840\nhow I should be buried let's say probably put that project off let's say\n\n49:00.840 --> 49:04.840\nyour friends and family get up there who do you expect would be first it\n\n49:04.840 --> 49:15.640\nprobably event Nicole Brown from seems like she's a you guys are pretty tight\n\n49:15.640 --> 49:21.280\nwell I just know she's a Christian person and she'd be like oh god Dan died\n\n49:21.280 --> 49:25.240\nand I'm like you weren't joking you're saying that event gets up there first I\n\n49:25.240 --> 49:28.880\nthink I think you can guarantee she seems like I'm a person that would hope that\n\n49:28.880 --> 49:34.400\nwould be emotional but be composed she always had higher hopes for me you know\n\n49:34.400 --> 49:39.840\nshe was a Christian do you think Chevy gets in there at all or no I have a\n\n49:39.840 --> 49:50.120\nfeeling like he'll be otherwise disposed do you think Rob will get up there\n\n49:50.120 --> 49:56.680\nand speak me look you know and I mean this is like it's a year I could stay\n\n49:56.680 --> 50:01.120\non the outside of this of this of this concept which where I'm like doing bits\n\n50:01.120 --> 50:04.880\nor like but I don't think those bits will be funny because I'll be on the\n\n50:04.880 --> 50:08.680\noutside I think was the thing to do would be to like actually think about\n\n50:08.680 --> 50:13.920\nthis but thinking about it is a little it is a little uncomfortable it's like\n\n50:13.920 --> 50:18.400\nlike I don't mean necessarily like stop I reject this let's not talk about it but\n\n50:18.400 --> 50:23.920\nI was like like gosh I mean what's your fear of like what somebody might say it\n\n50:23.920 --> 50:30.960\nlike yellow jazzing you oh I don't I think the what I don't think I think if you\n\n50:30.960 --> 50:34.440\ncan't come up with good stuff to say about me after I'm dead like I think I\n\n50:34.440 --> 50:39.480\nfeel like I've heard the worst of it through Google Autofill like I don't\n\n50:39.480 --> 50:44.160\nI don't I don't think Google Autofill is gonna be at my funeral you know people\n\n50:44.160 --> 50:51.320\nwill tweet that would be so good it's just like Dan Harmon Chevy Dan Harmon\n\n50:51.320 --> 50:59.840\nbad question and people are just crying I would like to think that that that if I\n\n50:59.840 --> 51:05.760\ncan I can make it the ten years necessary that like that the only people at\n\n51:05.760 --> 51:12.640\nmy my memorial would be just people that knew me you know like wouldn't it\n\n51:12.640 --> 51:16.360\nwouldn't be like a thing that people would comment on like I felt I felt pretty\n\n51:16.360 --> 51:21.040\nbad for as much as you can feel bad for a memory of someone I felt a little\n\n51:21.040 --> 51:25.080\nbad for Hugh Hefner I thought I thought it was a little awkward and sad that Hugh\n\n51:25.080 --> 51:30.600\nHefner lived for so long that if Hugh Hefner had died at 70 instead of 90\n\n51:30.600 --> 51:34.840\nwhatever he was that that he would have been like there would have been a 60\n\n51:34.840 --> 51:37.760\nminutes like peace or whatever and it's like it says nothing to do with whether\n\n51:37.760 --> 51:43.200\nor not it was right or wrong it's just like the timing of it felt so sad to me\n\n51:43.200 --> 51:48.480\nthat we were so awakened and stuff that Hugh Hefner who we don't we don't know I\n\n51:48.480 --> 51:53.200\nmean all we know is that like Brian Wilson or you know let's put Michael\n\n51:53.200 --> 51:57.000\nJackson in there like I don't know it's like that people who do terrible things\n\n51:57.000 --> 52:04.440\npeople who do who who are so visible and so like are effective that then like I\n\n52:04.440 --> 52:10.880\ndon't did you know it was like the context of him dying was it was like shit\n\n52:10.880 --> 52:15.240\nthis is like like he really died at the exact wrong time are you saying that you\n\n52:15.240 --> 52:19.920\nmight agree I might I might die early just to make I may like I'll be like\n\n52:19.920 --> 52:24.960\nsensing that the Dow Jones of die death value like this would be a perfect time\n\n52:24.960 --> 52:31.160\nto die are you worried that you that you might you might die under a shadow of\n\n52:31.160 --> 52:37.200\nno no no I I just what I'm saying is I don't think I think I'll be I'll be fine\n\n52:37.200 --> 52:42.000\nI don't think that I have to worry about what the world would say about a\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:48.320\ncorpse like I will I think I could step outside and get hit by a bus but I\n\n52:48.320 --> 52:55.560\nbelieve I'll make it first what the first bus cross your dick in the day\n\n52:55.560 --> 53:03.840\nyou're like what you're a grown man it's a like like I don't it's I'm pretty\n\n53:03.840 --> 53:08.240\nsure you're the reason why this topic is happening and like you just like because\n\n53:08.240 --> 53:13.440\nI'm you're like you know you're like a fucking kitten you know you like you ever\n\n53:13.440 --> 53:17.040\nhave a kitten and then like you you could roll up a paper ball and throw it\n\n53:17.040 --> 53:20.400\nand the kitten will just spend 20 minutes being so freaked out by the\n\n53:20.400 --> 53:24.000\nfucking paper ball it's like we're running sideways it's so and you're like\n\n53:24.000 --> 53:28.080\nthat's adorable the kitten thinks that the paper ball it needs to be attacked\n\n53:28.080 --> 53:33.160\nand stuff like this is you're like hey it's me I'm gonna fart in the mic and I\n\n53:33.160 --> 53:37.760\ndidn't oh I'm flexible enough that I'm like oh that farting in the mic reminds\n\n53:37.760 --> 53:42.200\nme of death let's talk about death and then you're like blah blah blah what\n\n53:42.200 --> 53:48.320\nabout me you haven't changed at all what a what were you trying to accomplish\n\n53:48.320 --> 53:54.120\nwhen you were moving that mic in such a way you were gonna fart in the mic well\n\n53:54.120 --> 53:58.680\nlet's let's not let's not let's let him let's let him answer let's try I was\n\n53:58.680 --> 54:04.880\nadjusting the cushion with the mic with my hand and you want people to respect\n\n54:04.880 --> 54:11.680\nyou and like you I bet those days are over with you know it'd be funny you\n\n54:11.680 --> 54:18.040\nguys if when you died you got a service a skydiving service to put your corpse\n\n54:18.040 --> 54:23.000\nin a parachute that has a time-lapse so it triggers itself so your corpse just\n\n54:23.000 --> 54:27.320\nkind of like skydives just somewhere and so people are like oh it's a skydiver\n\n54:27.320 --> 54:33.680\noh wait he's coming into the city oh he's landing right here oh well he's not\n\n54:33.680 --> 54:39.360\ngetting out from under his parachute oh is he okay we got to help him he's dead\n\n54:39.360 --> 54:46.960\noh no he's dead what happened and it's fuckers this was my plan all along like\n\n54:46.960 --> 54:51.640\nin the into the Super Bowl like you would yeah it would be amazing it would be so\n\n54:51.640 --> 54:57.440\ngood it would take so long to figure out if you could have a parachute\n\n54:57.440 --> 55:02.360\ncanopy that like had like like like you're a corpse you're in the thing yeah\n\n55:02.360 --> 55:06.600\nand you're going down and it's the Super Bowl or it's there the you know the\n\n55:06.600 --> 55:13.680\nchampions like like the soccer or the soccer or the football winners thingies\n\n55:13.680 --> 55:19.600\nthen and but a big game and you just the big but you have like servos and shit\n\n55:19.600 --> 55:25.360\nthe fly you at right dead guy lands right yeah yeah on the 50 yard line he's so\n\n55:25.360 --> 55:31.080\ngood I guess but that's I mean I I guess I I suggested that and then I take it\n\n55:31.080 --> 55:34.360\nback like I think the parachute thing's amazing but then if you're like oh my\n\n55:34.360 --> 55:40.080\nfinal act is I want to I want to disrupt the like the Super Bowl like then it's\n\n55:40.080 --> 55:44.800\nlike no wonder you're a corpse like anyway it wouldn't it wouldn't be it\n\n55:44.800 --> 55:48.360\nwouldn't be disrupting any but it would be it would be like oh you're hacking the\n\n55:48.360 --> 55:54.920\nSuper Bowl you figure it out how to ruin one astronaut that jumped jumped off\n\n55:54.920 --> 56:01.440\nlike a saddle and it was like an insane skydive didn't didn't you see that\n\n56:01.440 --> 56:06.080\nfootage or whatever yeah he jumped from the other like the atmosphere skydive\n\n56:06.080 --> 56:11.120\nfrom yeah and it was a parachute like whatever here's what you do I like\n\n56:11.120 --> 56:16.680\nSpencer's idea he just didn't go high enough okay take the corpse up high okay\n\n56:16.680 --> 56:22.400\nsuper high throw it out of the ship right let it go down burns in the\n\n56:22.400 --> 56:28.680\natmosphere you're a falling star people can wish on you somebody can make a\n\n56:28.680 --> 56:36.720\nwish on you but why did it have to be a call Elon you better call Elon and say\n\n56:36.720 --> 56:44.280\nhey I got some ideas Elon hey Elon hey don't rip off my idea that was my idea\n\n56:44.280 --> 56:50.920\nI'll sue you Elon if you steal my idea remember the time that Elon must have\n\n56:50.920 --> 56:55.320\nsent a super cool red convertible sports car in a space and then it turned out he\n\n56:55.320 --> 56:59.240\nwas a douchebag remember that time talking about one of my best friends and\n\n56:59.240 --> 57:03.920\nI won't like I think I saw his car recently remember that time that I was\n\n57:03.920 --> 57:08.960\ndriving my route in my very securitest route to get to get back home for the\n\n57:08.960 --> 57:14.520\nsecond time and my Tesla said raising suspension based on location because I\n\n57:14.520 --> 57:18.920\nwas in a neighborhood with speed bumps and I was like I love you too Elon fucking\n\n57:18.920 --> 57:26.000\namazing car the man can do no wrong what does he smell like apples the ultimate\n\n57:26.000 --> 57:33.920\nsmell smells like a bushel of a South African apples just as a more American\n\n57:33.920 --> 57:39.480\nthan the apples he seemed can I be I thought you said owls he seems like an\n\n57:39.480 --> 57:45.960\nunsupportable asshole like I well you you you you go you go you he's my best\n\n57:45.960 --> 57:51.520\nfriend can I just say that I think the Internet's mean to him and that's not to\n\n57:51.520 --> 57:55.880\nabsolve him of any of anything that anyone has against him but it's hard\n\n57:55.880 --> 58:00.400\nwhen you're a weird guy in the first place it's hard to be visible yeah it's\n\n58:00.400 --> 58:04.160\ncalling that's that's again not to give him like too much credit or anything but\n\n58:04.160 --> 58:08.320\nI don't want to create the joke I don't think the internet is being hard and I\n\n58:08.320 --> 58:12.120\nthink the stock market is being harder than because he keeps fucking I think we\n\n58:12.120 --> 58:17.240\ncould really be you know be be driving a man off the cliff because it's fun on\n\n58:17.240 --> 58:21.480\nthe internet right yeah you really want to support a system that's like oh you're\n\n58:21.480 --> 58:29.040\nthe new like car magnet and you made a completely green car and like oh you got\n\n58:29.040 --> 58:32.960\nhigh with Joe Rogan like we should definitely like punish that until you\n\n58:32.960 --> 58:38.920\nkill yourself like I mean like I don't like look I he seems like a dish canoe\n\n58:38.920 --> 58:46.800\nuntil further notice until he does what he bench presses a nun like my first\n\n58:46.800 --> 58:49.800\nrhetorical question is what does he have to do to get anyone's approval and my\n\n58:49.800 --> 58:54.400\nsecond question is go fuck yourself play like who cares if he does that like I\n\n58:54.400 --> 59:01.360\nlike I'm obviously biased I am I am I am in a healthy way very toxified about the\n\n59:01.360 --> 59:06.240\nthe like I need to move into my Gandalf the white the extremely white\n\n59:06.240 --> 59:12.360\nprivileged period where I'm like yeah I gotta get over my approval addiction so\n\n59:12.360 --> 59:18.720\nthat's tainting my my view of everything but in a healthy way like I it makes me\n\n59:18.720 --> 59:24.680\nall the more like fucking rabidly like human rights like oriented because I'm\n\n59:24.680 --> 59:28.200\nlike everyone should stop being fucking ashamed like everyone should stop\n\n59:28.200 --> 59:31.440\nshaming each other that includes everything that you think you're allowed\n\n59:31.440 --> 59:37.320\nto shame people for there shouldn't be any exceptions to that I'm tired of you\n\n59:37.320 --> 59:41.880\nknow it's like I we've all been on a big roller coaster ride and for my money\n\n59:41.880 --> 59:46.880\nI've been like you know I started here and I fucking do but do and I kind of\n\n59:46.880 --> 59:50.760\nlike you know when I think back to the beginning of the podcast when I was like\n\n59:50.760 --> 59:55.760\nthis boner that like you know was like democracy doesn't matter and you shouldn't\n\n59:55.760 --> 59:59.840\nvote and all this stuff like I've changed in a lot of ways and I've changed back\n\n59:59.840 --> 01:00:03.000\nin a lot of ways like the one thing that's come around full circle is I'm\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.720\nkind of like fuck everybody stop telling me to tie my shoes go fuck yourself like\n\n01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:11.960\nI got to get out of here and and and I and I would never ever ever hurt a\n\n01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:17.440\nperson that that that wanted to just be who they were like I don't I don't want\n\n01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:22.040\nanybody to feel pain you're still a boner Dan I know that's what I'm saying like\n\n01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:26.840\nlike if that's the new definition of boner I'm like good because like I spent\n\n01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:30.520\ntoo much time in the deprivation tank of like thinking that that could be the\n\n01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:35.200\ndefinition of a good person because it can't if you are kind of like across the\n\n01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:40.000\nboard in favor of everybody being happy sooner or later you're gonna fuck you\n\n01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.640\nhave to accept that that's gonna piss a good 70% of people off and if you're\n\n01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:49.760\nnot adult enough to handle 70% of people like being pissed at you then you\n\n01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:53.760\nshouldn't be bandying about this concept of this that this supposed position you\n\n01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:58.080\nhave like like you got to nut up to pardon the expression because some\n\n01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:02.320\npeople need to that some people that don't have nuts or want nuts like you\n\n01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:05.640\nguard nutting up and like like teaching me lessons and being like yeah you got\n\n01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:10.600\nto fucking like it gets bad like you got to handle like like this idea that you\n\n01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:14.200\ndon't give a fuck what people think because that way you can have self-esteem\n\n01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:19.560\nand you'll inspire people to go oh yeah etc right what do you think percentage\n\n01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:24.440\nwise is here like you're you're you're Q rating your global Q right now there's\n\n01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.880\n20 people out in the audience here they were willing to pay ten dollars on a\n\n01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:35.600\nMonday night and I think that's that's a metric I'll use like like 20 out of like\n\n01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:41.120\n8 billion yeah I don't say I mean I was like I'm incredibly biased but I think\n\n01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:50.960\nlike in 2018 I think that fame is a really really like it's it's a dangerous\n\n01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:56.360\nthing I think that if you have no money and you can become famous like that's a\n\n01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:04.280\nsmart parkour move you could like jump from from zero fame and zero money up\n\n01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:08.240\nto fame and zero money and then with the right twisting and the right\n\n01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:15.680\ncircumstances you could leap from fame and no money to some money and then my\n\n01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:20.760\nadvice is grab that money hang on to that and don't fucking use too much fame\n\n01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:27.400\nas your parkour point because visibility means you're you're like hanging out\n\n01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:31.800\nthere and it's fun right now I'm not I'm trying I'm not I'm not I don't want to be\n\n01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:37.320\nlike like Aaron Sorkin and you know like my predecessors and be like this\n\n01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:42.000\ninternet the fuck you I'm saying as a 45 year old dude like spent like 30 years\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.960\nbeing like hey look at me look at me look at me and I want to spend my life\n\n01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:49.200\nonline and I want everybody to know what's going on with me and no no no harm\n\n01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.240\ncan come of that if I just commit to that and all this stuff I'm just saying\n\n01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:57.720\nlike like we've arrived at a world where like there's so much fame to go around\n\n01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:03.480\nand it's it's so like it's like kind of like helium or some gas that just sort of\n\n01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:07.520\nlike you could become you can be famous for 30 minutes you can be famous for\n\n01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:11.760\n20 years you can be you can be this famous that famous it's just like like\n\n01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:16.440\nit but it all has one thing in common which is that it's like it's like it's\n\n01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:23.600\nlike the ratio of safety that it provides to risk that it creates has gone\n\n01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:29.160\nway into if I was your broker and I was like don't buy fame like sell sell\n\n01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:35.940\nbecause it'll make you it could destroy you more than it could help is there a\n\n01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:40.800\nratio for you that like that like if you could achieve a certain amount of wealth\n\n01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:50.160\nthat you could retire on divided by or multiplied by the love of strangers like\n\n01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:54.560\nlike how important is it's not fame for you I don't I don't think you ever wanted\n\n01:03:54.560 --> 01:04:00.080\nfame no I didn't want fame because I was like I I did I was like I was like\n\n01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:04.280\nthere's no question about it that like I'm not I'm not a victim of anything like\n\n01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:10.800\nI absolutely engineered every day of my life I was like how can I be visible how\n\n01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:16.400\ncan I make people know my name like I branded myself I am every bit responsible\n\n01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:21.720\nfor like every fucking ounce I put nothing but energy into the idea of\n\n01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:27.000\npeople knowing who I am knowing what I am I I will even go so far as to say like\n\n01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.280\nI even like added in these elements of like oh he's drunk and he's cantankerous\n\n01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:35.960\nand he's like oh he's a torture genius and like I I wish that I could have\n\n01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:43.000\ncontrolled it every fucking micro bit of it but it's all ingredients that I aimed\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.760\nat a cauldron and set at a temperature that I was like called fame or called\n\n01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:55.440\ncalled called attention or obsolescence insurance called called you can't if I'm\n\n01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:00.840\nif I'm a showrunner on an NBC sitcom you can't fire me quietly called like you\n\n01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:05.760\ncan't like you I'm Colonel Sanders so whether you like me or not my head's on\n\n01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:14.560\na bucket and like like and like like that's called tenure that's as close as\n\n01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:21.680\nwe get it's it's like oh you can't just here's something Colonel Sanders wasn't\n\n01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:29.560\na Colonel yeah and I'm not the whatever the fuck we thought I was I am a guy\n\n01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:35.200\nthat was like hey look at me which is which is anybody that's like into me is\n\n01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:39.240\nlike yeah that's why I like you you're not you've never pretended to be higher\n\n01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:43.120\nthan us but when you when you said that you wanted you want your name to be\n\n01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:47.720\nindelible and like you want to be everlasting like in that way like no\n\n01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:50.680\nmatter whether they liked you or not you're not for legacy just for tenure\n\n01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:55.400\nfor job security but so it's job security but it's like like dick wolf\n\n01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:59.360\nlike where's dick wolf dick wolf is here tonight we don't know oh yeah we should\n\n01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:04.080\nwe did dick wolf we don't is he alive is he dead is he in a admiral pike like\n\n01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:08.400\nthing like dick wolf like he's got 900 TV shows his name's dick wolf like you can\n\n01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:14.200\nlike Tom Clancy yeah Tom stand up Tom Clancy like like what is that what you\n\n01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:18.880\nwant yes yes yes you want to be and could I also have a different name other\n\n01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:23.600\nthan the thing like can I can I so that I can stop when I when I get on Google can\n\n01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:28.280\nI stop being reminded that is it important to you and these are questions\n\n01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:31.360\nthat I probably maybe knows the answer because I've known you for a long time\n\n01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:35.400\nmaybe not maybe maybe we never talk about it is it important to you that to\n\n01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:39.120\nwalk in the street and feel love or just attempt or our tension I think that\n\n01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:42.640\nmight have been important to me at 32 I that no it's not it's not important\n\n01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:47.520\nanymore I've gotten I've I've gotten so much of that drink like I love it like\n\n01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:51.240\nit's so good it was so nourishing when you when you talk about now because you\n\n01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:54.600\nkeep repeating that fact the idea that you want to retire and go away and\n\n01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:59.440\ndisappear do you think that you've achieved what you wanted out of that yes\n\n01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:06.440\nbecause because you can't be 70 and be like check the dailies did how did I do\n\n01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:11.320\ntoday that's not what we want from a 70 I don't see any version of you that when\n\n01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:17.640\nyou're 70 that's not gonna still want oh I have more faith in me I mean I I don't\n\n01:07:17.640 -->

the what's necessary what's your courage to make him stay 16 which pretty\n\n01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:37.720\naccurate it's not bad it's not really a metaphor it's like that's exactly my\n\n01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:43.640\ncharisma but I'm a plant person right but I'm an inclusive supposed to talk to\n\n01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:50.680\nplants I'm I can talk to anybody stay I'm with the church of the silver flame\n\n01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:55.480\nstay what are you doing isn't there a demon about to kill us yeah\n\n01:22:55.480 --> 01:23:04.560\ncan we oh my god I I try to focus on the the the inherent peril going on right\n\n01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:08.360\nnow and I examine the surroundings what's going on around so I don't know\n\n01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:12.720\nwhat Steve was doing last but Schrab walking away and leaving the circle is\n\n01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:16.680\nlike making the circle which has been distorted and messed up kind of tighten\n\n01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:20.920\nmore around the demon he's kind of half in and half out of it so it's kind of\n\n01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:25.520\nholding him fast and he's like oh no this is bad but being like a 25 foot tall\n\n01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:29.640\ndemon he can still lash out and attack and stuff so it's not a solved problem\n\n01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:35.520\nwait so him walking away Garry Shandling walking away that's making it harder for\n\n01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:40.520\nthe demon like yeah because Steven Robb helped summon the demon they were one\n\n01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:44.360\nof like about the seven to eight people that stood in the summoning circle to\n\n01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:49.120\nsummon the demon so when they left their places it had an effect on the ritual is\n\n01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:55.320\nwhat you're gleaning hey Gary and diarrhea junior walk away from each other\n\n01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:59.120\nand it'll it'll make it harder for the demon to move well that's happened at\n\n01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:05.040\nthis point that has occurred all right I walk you guys think our alcoholism is\n\n01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:08.320\nyour sandbox that's what you just think you could just do whatever you want\n\n01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:13.800\nduring my blackouts well you can't I mean you can but then I will during the\n\n01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:18.520\nnext blackout hear about it and then I'll be like what the fuck do we know\n\n01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:24.880\nabout how many HP the the demon has right now it looks like it has all of it\n\n01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:30.280\nall of it what how much of its body is through the circle about half but like a\n\n01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:37.320\ndiagonal half but mostly the upper all right whoa I'm walking away yeah that\n\n01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:41.440\nwas a mistake you didn't help summon the demons so I wasn't helping anyway so it\n\n01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:45.760\ndoesn't change it but you are you're farther away from it which is good because\n\n01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:52.840\nit's it has a long reach you know yeah are we in combat like churn mode right\n\n01:24:52.840 --> 01:25:00.960\nnow technically technically we always are I mean whose turn is it how about\n\n01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:20.640\nit's yours his name is Cornelius he's a he's a fire ant he he's I'm a fire\n\n01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:23.720\nelemental kind of fair I'm a chick you're supposed to I'm Chad the fire\n\n01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:30.880\nhe's a fiery ant and and he has some of my fire elemental power well let's have\n\n01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:36.200\na shower for him then let's find out if you summon why are you why are you\n\n01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:41.800\nshaming my I'm saying like it's not healthy like wait to see oh no you can\n\n01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:47.000\nsummon it's fine yeah Cornelius you were doubting my ability\n\n01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:53.400\nnature's alley fire ants don't use real fire yeah but but because I'm a far because\n\n01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:58.600\nI'm a fire liker he he's a fire ants right yeah he's a he's a real pain in\n\n01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:04.720\nthe butt the also like spicy food he loves yeah he he loves\n\n01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:17.880\nfar he's some people karma a fur and let's do it okay so hello Cornelius attack\n\n01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:25.840\nall right it goes it rushes it's in a rage yeah oh boy if I know Cornelius\n\n01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:32.000\nhe's fucking in a full-on range Cornelius don't fucking play being summoned\n\n01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:38.440\nfrom another plane it makes them all crazy and such there's just a plane of\n\n01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:43.880\nants there's a whole yeah there's a plane for every monster it's really fucked\n\n01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:47.760\nup these planes on these planes are they like the dominant life form are these\n\n01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:51.320\nplanes like functional like the material plane or they just planes where\n\n01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:55.760\nthere's like ghost ants like like I always imagine it just being like\n\n01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:00.240\nswirling monsters in space but it probably is something more I would have\n\n01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:10.080\nsummoned the snake from a plane but it's not they were busy all right the the\n\n01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:13.800\nant bites him it doesn't seem like it hurts very bad it bites him for 3d\n\n01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:18.560\ndamage 3 is fucking better than no it's it does look like it's better than no\n\n01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:27.560\ndamage by a thin margin Cornelius relocate he really he makes as to\n\n01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:33.040\nrelocate because Cornelius is a rogue ant and he likes to do sneak attacks\n\n01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:40.880\nthis guy good well he's like I go to college I use but pretend pretend to be\n\n01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:46.120\na cop so that my role as a kingpin can be bolstered I use my turn I summoned an\n\n01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:50.160\nant did 3 damage what have you done for me yeah I can't do anything you can you\n\n01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:55.000\nget the departed rolling out here you've got like

slice all the cultists as I\n\n01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:35.680\nrun in a circle all right well you can only attack one at a time what to okay\n\n01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:44.040\nlet's do it we're doing it I just feel like we're we do everything wrong what\n\n01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:49.560\nare we doing I'm just trying to be proactive I can't just sit around wait\n\n01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:54.240\nalso I partially caused this problem you summoned a demon and now it's our job\n\n01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:58.880\nto kill this demon I would I would suppose you chopped the leg off one of\n\n01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:05.360\nthe cultists hell yeah yeah there's six more but that one he's on the ground\n\n01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:10.160\nbleeding what if what are the real what are the other cultists doing they're\n\n01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:14.720\nhanging out it's there they're existing within the five seconds most of this\n\n01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:22.280\naction is taking place within ish does it help when we chop down cultists it\n\n01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:28.080\ncertainly helps you should ask that before you that always the order should\n\n01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:34.960\nbe you're describing a conscience you ask that question then then then you\n\n01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:41.640\nchop them I did dismember this leg but was it good well is it is it is the is\n\n01:30:41.640 -->

01:38:36.840\nfighting the demon right I guess yeah well like you witness a cavalry arrive\n\n01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:41.440\nand it's it's you know them as the fourth cavalry of the church militant\n\n01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:47.080\nit's a faction of the the members of the church who saved people from evil\n\n01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:52.480\ndemons and they actually just kind of make quick work of the cult and the\n\n01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:57.000\ndemons because they're highly trained this is exactly what they do and then\n\n01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.160\nthey just kind of high five you

can\n\n01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:25.560\nwe all I wasn't supposed to be leading either that was just what was gonna\n\n01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:29.400\nhappen oh yeah we trust you not to create weird\n\n01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:33.120\nprinces in the pee situations that guide us but can we all kind of a lot of\n\n01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:36.960\ncan the four of us get together and have a little huddle DJ we came up with a\n\n01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:40.520\nnew handshake go quit what's the new handshake with your thumbs down and you\n\n01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:45.720\nmake a fart noise that's in and of itself\n\n01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:50.160\ntill all our wall handshake\n\n01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:58.400\nwell DJ's back there good journey no we're all together all together now we're\n\n01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:02.960\nall DJ that all happened in the past while you guys were were hashing it out\n\n01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:09.120\nwith with with Rob and then then he just caught up to damage what we all agree\n\n01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:13.760\nright now that we're all together now but it's for us it's not for the it's\n\n01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:17.680\nnot for the church it's for what we believe in yeah and I know that that's\n\n01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:22.480\nit's a less powerful conviction given that really it's not the church's fault\n\n01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:28.280\nthat we're constantly drunk and forgetting everything we did but I do\n\n01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:33.080\nthink it's like you can do the right things for the wrong reasons like I\n\n01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:37.880\nthink that we we were doing the wrong things for the right reasons we will\n\n01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:40.880\nwe've been trying to be good soldiers and like for the church and stuff and\n\n01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:45.360\nit's not a job we're cut out for no I feel like this is my hope and maybe this\n\n01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:50.960\nis unhealthy thinking if we start doing adventures that that are based on our\n\n01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:58.240\nown agenda that we might remember him better and we won't fuck him up hey uh hey\n\n01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:05.240\nCornelius he disappeared like a minute ago he can't summon an aunt that'll then\n\n01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:11.240\njust hang out sorry I don't mean to I I've never summoned in that before and I\n\n01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:16.120\nlook am I a bad person no it's sad that you thought it was like a teddy bear\n\n01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:21.120\nI think it's not it's a crime you would gladly watch dive is he alive is he dead it's a\n\n01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:24.360\nsoldier that you would have watched fight for you and he killed you and then\n\n01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:29.920\nyou're like hey can I ask you a question like it's Jen Hirsch on taxi it's like\n\n01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:39.200\nwell pick a lane I summon a person whose opinion I value to fight a troll well\n\n01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:44.440\nif we're relinquishing our allegiance to the church keep your voice down should\n\n01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:49.320\nwe should we call the new group name like like horse friends or super squad or\n\n01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:54.280\nsomething here's my vote I don't think the church gives that much of a fuck\n\n01:41:54.280 --> 01:42:00.000\nabout us they have no reason to care I don't think we need to say to them hey\n\n01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:07.200\nI will declare my independence they'll stamp us out like but what we can do is\n\n01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:12.400\ndecide that we're not we're not working for them anymore the silver flame didn't\n\n01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:17.520\nsay make this church and have this church be in charge of me the silver flame\n\n01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:23.960\nis a real thing does it actually talk yeah I believe it does it I believe in\n\n01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:26.980\nthe myth of the silver flame and I'm using the word myth in the cambillian\n\n01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:31.480\nphrase and Campbell is the thing I'll tell you about later or but but like it's\n\n01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:36.960\nI believe the story I believe the silver flame is real like I you can well while\n\n01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:41.520\nCarlos is talking because I think this is gonna go somewhere pretty big and\n\n01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:46.800\nimportant for yeah for where we're headed do I have it a second level spell\n\n01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:58.720\nin me so sure I cast Al's wisdom which gives you who's Al Al from happy it gives\n\n01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:12.400\nyou a plus four on wisdom right now yeah that could be good yeah so yeah I do not\n\n01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:19.760\npollute like that's a reference to okay so I then I continue babbling and I it\n\n01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:25.000\nsounds wiser yeah way wise like I'm saying like look it doesn't I mean if\n\n01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.520\nthis the silver flame is real the allegiance with the church like I\n\n01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:35.920\ndon't know man like I think they sent us out here on what we call a fuck run\n\n01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:42.200\nfucking out Al's wisdom making it up working right man there's no such phrase\n\n01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:59.240\nbut but well you didn't cast no articulation I'm saying it's working\n\n01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:05.000\nyou like we were in a fucking fuck run yeah the truth is the reason why I\n\n01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:12.180\njoined the church was was personal and I like it had to do with the purific\n\n01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:16.480\nation and that the silver flame represents the idea that there is an\n\n01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:20.880\nempirical difference between good and bad and that and pure and impure and that\n\n01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:27.000\nit's not it's not based on like people's subjective opinions that there is a\n\n01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:33.520\ntruth out there an ideal that we should strive for and God bless the church but\n\n01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:37.720\nlike I don't I don't think you can organize something to that to the level\n\n01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:43.080\nthat our church has organized us and and and and be without corruption of that\n\n01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:46.840\nthing and I'm not even saying that's why we should quit it I'm saying actually\n\n01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:53.040\nhonestly I'm an alcoholic and like I'm a I'm a bad cleric like they got they had\n\n01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:58.000\nme in the library and like they strategically like designed it so that\n\n01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.920\nit was a certain distance from the break room they knew they knew about my drink\n\n01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:05.120\nso what's your what do you what's your pitch I'm saying they let me out they\n\n01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:09.840\nsent me on an adventure they knew I was gonna get drunk and they didn't care so\n\n01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:14.400\nthat means they didn't care if we lived or died I'm saying to you guys as a\n\n01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:18.880\nperson with a Swiss cheese brain who can't I can't I'm from one moment to\n\n01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:24.440\nthe next I can't remember what we were doing like it's a bad like I think we\n\n01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:30.000\nshould we should be renegades it would suit us better so we shouldn't go to the\n\n01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:39.000\nmining town well we should have the mining town come to us I guess there's\n\n01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.960\nreally nothing we can accomplish if we continue to not be able to remember what\n\n01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:51.320\nwe did from one moment to the next that's a good point whoa maybe we should\n\n01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:57.000\ntry to be oh it's a sunflower I left the coal oh I'm just\n\n01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:08.280\nsorry no I don't exist all right okay must be nice sorry there was a spiritual\n\n01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:13.720\ntrack what you're saying is simplify simplify and and and maybe play once a\n\n01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:19.280\nweek I did I well yeah if maybe if we I don't know man I'm yeah I don't know I\n\n01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:28.000\nmean I know that I'm worried here's I'm worried that I don't remember that we\n\n01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:31.880\nsummoned a demon like I felt like that was like a warning sign like when you\n\n01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:35.560\nwake up and you're like like oh it was summoned a demon and the like like I\n\n01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:42.440\ndon't know when we did like I honestly I also as

can't always be here to cast Al's wisdom on people and\n\n01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:59.880\nseven ants like I said sometimes I have to go do like sing dick jokes like in\n\n01:46:59.880 -->
