00:00.000 --> 00:09.240
from downtown ish, Los Angeles ish, from MacArthur Park and the prestigious stabbing

00:09.240 --> 00:25.560
district, Harmontown is now in session. Let's welcome Spencer Crittenden in the stage.

00:25.560 --> 00:31.680
So thin, so live, only three episodes until you just absolutely evaporate and disappear.

00:31.680 --> 00:38.960
That's what everybody wants. I love your little sexy desk. Just for good measure, let's bring

00:38.960 --> 00:50.000
out the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon. Thank you.

00:50.000 --> 01:04.160
God damn it. The text don't go out. Oh, rap, rap, rap. I'm gonna rap about it.

01:04.160 --> 01:12.640
Rap, rap, rap, rap, rap south and rap to the east. I'm gonna rap to your mama's

01:12.640 --> 01:19.640
city. That's the feast that love. Put some gravy on it. All right, you know our deal that we made.

01:19.640 --> 01:28.120
If it's not going, if it's not working, we stop. I think you came out not really feeling the rap

01:28.120 --> 01:32.600
like before this, before it happened. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Here's some other things that came out

01:32.600 --> 01:39.600
not feeling. Humanity, like life. I don't care, you know, like I'm fine, but I don't, yeah,

01:39.600 --> 01:46.840
I'm not, I'm not particularly connected to the brotherhood of man this week. I'm not like

01:46.840 --> 02:16.480
rooting for anybody. Rob Schrab has taken the stage and sat down, just staring at Dan. Rob Schrab, an unheralded Rob Schrab came out. Hello, Rob, how you doing? Hi, Jeff. Are you feeling humanity right now, Rob? Am I feeling humanity? Dan said he wasn't feeling humanity.

02:16.480 --> 02:26.040
Especially not the brotherhood of humanity, which is good because that's a very dangerous cult. You should not worry about them. I don't think I am feeling

02:26.040 --> 02:35.080
the brotherhood of humanity. I'm being very isolated lately. It seems like Jeff didn't get what he was instigating. Jeff, do you want to try to

02:35.080 --> 02:56.840
re-instigate something? Rob didn't respond to that. What I just found out is that you guys both aren't feeling it right now. So that you guys are at Sympaticale. Yeah. What's the worst thing that you saw this week that made you think the best thing you could do is hide from everyone?

02:56.840 --> 03:17.560
What was the worst thing? Yeah, what's the thing? What's an event or something? Well, I got to tell you, this Kavanaugh shit is really bumming me out. I mean, this is where we're at, people. No, I was watching Vine compilations on YouTube and I got really sad.

03:17.560 --> 03:33.840
Because Vine's gone? Yeah, I like Vine. Vine was fun. It was good. There were some very, very, very funny things. I know you and I had our disagreements as to when and where it should be listened to.

03:33.840 --> 03:50.840
Yeah, you shouldn't play Vine in a fancy restaurant. No, even if everyone in the room is enjoying it. Everyone at the table. Everyone at the table. Obviously, everyone at the restaurant can't enjoy you playing Vine. That's not, like maybe in a Vine commercial, like, oh, what's going on over there?

03:50.840 --> 04:05.840
It's like a Milton Bradley commercial for Vine where, oh, the chef comes out. I was trying to make food, but if someone's playing a Vine at top volume, I'll stop making the food. Well, I was hungry, but I'd rather eat this Vine.

04:05.840 --> 04:22.840
So what's the burr in your boot, Harmon? Like, is there anything in particular? I think it was like, like, I had a great week, or a great, what are we talking about? Yeah, I was like, I guess we're going, like, since the last time I saw everybody. Like, it's been great.

04:22.840 --> 04:28.840
What are you doing? You get a fart? Why did you put the microphone in your ass?

04:28.840 --> 04:37.840
What were you, no. You're talking. Why would I interrupt you? Please continue. It's just insane to me. What are you doing?

04:37.840 --> 04:42.840
I'm not doing anything. Why are you so against humanity?

04:42.840 --> 04:44.840
What are you doing?

04:44.840 --> 04:49.840
I'm listening to my friend talk on his show.

04:49.840 --> 04:53.840
You're putting the microphone under your ass.

04:53.840 --> 05:04.840
I would have to have something in the chamber to do that, and I'm telling you as a friend, I don't. Please continue with your story.

05:04.840 --> 05:10.840
He's not saying you were farting into the mic, but we both heard you drag the microphone up your butt.

05:10.840 --> 05:12.840
We all saw it with our eyes.

05:12.840 --> 05:16.840
I can't help that.

05:16.840 --> 05:24.840
I don't know where I went sour. I think it was relatively recently. I can work backwards from here and go.

05:24.840 --> 05:33.840
Actually, I got really sour just now backstage because I was scrolling through Instagram, and I followed Mark Hamill on Instagram.

05:33.840 --> 05:36.840
He's the best. He should be on the show.

05:36.840 --> 05:37.840
We should have him on the show.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.840
I would love to have him on the show.

05:39.840 --> 05:48.840
He's unapologetically, look, I don't think Mark Hamill is out there asking how am I driving in terms of how he's handling being famous.

05:48.840 --> 06:00.840
Obviously, I'm projecting a lot to the guy, but I see him as a guy who has passed a couple of return thresholds into, yes, I'll say it, a return of a kind of Jedi,

06:00.840 --> 06:05.840
where he's like, I got my robot hand, and I don't fucking care.

06:05.840 --> 06:10.840
I'm throwing down my lightsaber, which to a lot of people means picking one up, but fuck them.

06:10.840 --> 06:14.840
He's like, yeah, I'm liberal, and I fucking don't like the president.

06:14.840 --> 06:19.840
You're following Mark Hamill, not Luke Skywalker on fucking Instagram.

06:19.840 --> 06:36.840
I got it. It's like a magnet. Negative stuff is sticky. I want to look through his, because if I see Mark Hamill, he'll Instagram something that's just unapologetically left.

06:36.840 --> 06:42.840
He's liberal. I don't like this trunk fella.

06:42.840 --> 06:50.840
Then it'll say like 6,000 comments, and I'm like, this probably isn't 6,000 people saying, and may the force also be with you.

06:50.840 --> 07:00.840
I know what it's going to be, and I just have to click on it, and I'm just like, I hate, I hate, I hate everyone.

07:00.840 --> 07:14.840
I just hate, I hate reality. I hate this fucking like, it's just stupid, just dumb people. Like, why, who cares if you really...

07:14.840 --> 07:16.840
Is he doing the butt?

07:16.840 --> 07:17.840
He was.

07:17.840 --> 07:19.840
He was putting the microphone under his ass.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.840
No, I'm not. I'm not. I was...

07:21.840 --> 07:23.840
What are you lying? You're lying to people.

07:23.840 --> 07:25.840
What am I lying? I was listening.

07:25.840 --> 07:29.840
There's 63 people out here.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.840
That can see you sticking a mic under your ass.

07:32.840 --> 07:40.840
Oh, yeah. Yeah, you got busted. You're putting the mic on your butt, and you're doing a microphone butt wipe, and he's talking about Mark Hamill.

07:40.840 --> 07:43.840
Okay, well, we'll never know.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.840
That's not what we agreed to.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.840
He's doing a thing.

07:47.840 --> 07:54.840
Yeah, so anyways, it just made me grumpy. I scrolled through it, and I'm just like, it just toxifies.

07:54.840 --> 08:01.840
I'm just like, ah, God, people are fucking dumb. I just don't like, I don't like people. But it's not, those aren't people.

08:01.840 --> 08:04.840
It's like looking at a fish tank at the zoo. You're like, you're not seeing the fish.

08:04.840 --> 08:07.840
You're not seeing people? Those are fish.

08:07.840 --> 08:18.840
It's like you're seeing people, you're seeing a sample of humanity that were driven to comment on an Instagram of a guy that played Luke Skywalker.

08:18.840 --> 08:20.840
I don't know why I would choose to do that.

08:20.840 --> 08:23.840
What did you do? Did you successfully...

08:23.840 --> 08:26.840
How do we know when you've done what you wanted to do?

08:26.840 --> 08:28.840
It depends how the fart sounds.

08:28.840 --> 08:37.840
I think you think it's going to sound like a fart, and you think a fart is going to be louder than you continually sliding a microphone along fabric.

08:37.840 --> 08:41.840
It's going to be, you know, this episode.

08:41.840 --> 08:43.840
Spencer, are you on my side?

08:43.840 --> 08:47.840
I'm on the world side.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.840
But not humanity's side.

08:49.840 --> 08:52.840
Are there fish at the zoo, or do you have to go to the aquarium?

08:52.840 --> 08:56.840
There's so many fish. It's not a focus, but they're there.

08:56.840 --> 09:00.840
They don't stay because the water keeps going through the bars.

09:00.840 --> 09:04.840
They have to keep free-filling the cages.

09:04.840 --> 09:08.840
They're still trying to figure that out.

09:08.840 --> 09:12.840
God damn it, why aren't these fish comfortable in captivity?

09:12.840 --> 09:15.840
The monkeys are playing ball. What the fuck, fish?

09:15.840 --> 09:19.840
Every zookeeper keeps ordering a cage on Amazon.

09:19.840 --> 09:23.840
And the description with iPhone products is just like...

09:23.840 --> 09:27.840
Giraffes, hippos, fish, snakes.

09:27.840 --> 09:29.840
Fits all models.

09:29.840 --> 09:33.840
In case you're searching for anything, you type snake cage, and they're like,

09:33.840 --> 09:36.840
here's a cage, works for snakes. You can fit a snake in there.

09:36.840 --> 09:40.840
The snake comes out, bites you.

09:40.840 --> 09:42.840
I didn't say it worked.

09:42.840 --> 09:44.840
The aquarium house...

09:44.840 --> 09:46.840
It is a snake cage.

09:46.840 --> 09:50.840
The Milwaukee public zoo was my favorite.

09:50.840 --> 09:54.840
Milwaukee had a relatively good zoo for the size of the city.

09:54.840 --> 09:57.840
They called it the aquarium house?

09:57.840 --> 10:00.840
I don't know. A fish house? I don't know.

10:00.840 --> 10:03.840
You said the aquarium house.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.840
They probably didn't call it that.

10:05.840 --> 10:08.840
They called it the aquarium.

10:08.840 --> 10:13.840
Which probably includes a Latin suffix for house.

10:13.840 --> 10:16.840
Eum probably means house.

10:16.840 --> 10:19.840
It's an aquarium house.

10:19.840 --> 10:21.840
Opera house.

10:21.840 --> 10:24.840
You're describing an operarium.

10:24.840 --> 10:27.840
What?

10:27.840 --> 10:33.840
I miss when Rob was using the microphone to make butt sounds.

10:33.840 --> 10:37.840
It'll happen again.

10:37.840 --> 10:39.840
So did you fart?

10:39.840 --> 10:41.840
No, not. You would have.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.840
I'm just asking.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.840
I'm getting comfortable. I'm enjoying myself on the show.

10:46.840 --> 10:49.840
I think you're funnier and less comfortable chairs.

10:49.840 --> 10:53.840
Now that we've got you these comfy chairs, you're too relaxed.

10:53.840 --> 10:55.840
I think you're used to dates.

10:55.840 --> 10:58.840
Talk about what we talked about when you brought up before the show.

10:58.840 --> 11:00.840
You want to address that?

11:00.840 --> 11:02.840
Your anxieties?

11:02.840 --> 11:04.840
Sure. Yeah.

11:04.840 --> 11:07.840
You feel like you've been listening to the show.

11:07.840 --> 11:09.840
I'm bored with my own shit.

11:09.840 --> 11:13.840
I feel like all I do is come out here and complain.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.840
My voice gets to that register that nobody likes.

11:17.840 --> 11:22.840
I feel like I've got to switch it up a bit.

11:22.840 --> 11:25.840
That's why I came out up earlier.

11:25.840 --> 11:28.840
Dude, you're misinterpreting.

11:28.840 --> 11:30.840
That is not me.

11:30.840 --> 11:35.840
I was just stretching.

11:35.840 --> 11:39.840
I love the idea that you sincerely were like,

11:39.840 --> 11:41.840
yeah, I'm tired of this shit.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.840
I'm going to change it up.

11:43.840 --> 11:46.840
You changing it up in your eyes is farting into the microphone.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.840
I didn't, though.

11:48.840 --> 11:53.840
As long as I'm not cranky.

11:53.840 --> 12:00.840
No, I posted a picture of Tom Kenny and myself from back in the comedy sports days.

12:00.840 --> 12:03.840
I think it was like 1993.

12:03.840 --> 12:07.840
1991. No, it was before Skud.

12:07.840 --> 12:10.840
1991 before Skud.

12:10.840 --> 12:12.840
It was a great day.

12:12.840 --> 12:17.840
That was the day Tom Kenny gave me this amazing advice about comedy and writing.

12:17.840 --> 12:21.840
No one comes up to me and he goes,

12:21.840 --> 12:23.840
this is you?

12:23.840 --> 12:26.840
I was like, yeah, do I look that much different?

12:26.840 --> 12:28.840
This guy's smiling.

12:28.840 --> 12:31.840
He's got so much hope in his eyes.

12:31.840 --> 12:33.840
Really? Is that what I'm projecting?

12:33.840 --> 12:40.840
And I guess I am. I'm projecting this hopeless, depressed, sad, angry, pissy, pissy.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.840
Okay.

12:42.840 --> 12:44.840
All right. Okay.

12:44.840 --> 12:47.840
I don't want that to be me.

12:47.840 --> 12:50.840
Well, don't you...

12:50.840 --> 12:52.840
I would interpret that as...

12:52.840 --> 12:54.840
I love that song, by the way.

12:54.840 --> 12:58.840
I would interpret that as like Nolan's living in the Shire.

12:58.840 --> 13:01.840
And he's like, oh, I love it when Gandalf comes to visit.

13:01.840 --> 13:04.840
And if you asked the Shire to fill out a survey,

13:04.840 --> 13:06.840
don't you think it would come back?

13:06.840 --> 13:09.840
On the Shire news today,

13:09.840 --> 13:15.840
90% of hobbits feel like Gandalf should smile more.

13:15.840 --> 13:17.840
Well, of course they're going to say that.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.840
But I feel like I'm always smiling.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.840
Well, no, it's the fuck how Gandalf...

13:21.840 --> 13:24.840
Gandalf is happy the way he is,

13:24.840 --> 13:28.840
and it's like, you don't want to go to the Shire for how you should be a wizard.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.840
Here's the thing.

13:30.840 --> 13:33.840
Nolan was just saying, like, I can't believe you've become a life master.

13:33.840 --> 13:36.840
You have so much power. You could turn a pine cone into a fireball.

13:36.840 --> 13:38.840
Right.

13:38.840 --> 13:41.840
This guy that fights a ball rock and says, you shall not pass.

13:41.840 --> 13:44.840
It's crazy that you were once a kid.

13:44.840 --> 13:47.840
You made the dawn come early, so things turn into stone.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.840
I get it. I know. I'm pretty cool.

13:49.840 --> 13:51.840
Did he make it come early? Was he doing it?

13:51.840 --> 13:54.840
I was looking at that part of the book as he was just waiting.

13:54.840 --> 13:57.840
He just stalled them and then the sun came up.

13:57.840 --> 14:01.840
I don't think he made the sun move faster,

14:01.840 --> 14:03.840
because that would screw up everybody in China.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.840
They would be going, what the hell's going on?

14:05.840 --> 14:07.840
Middle China.

14:07.840 --> 14:09.840
Middle China.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.840
What?

14:11.840 --> 14:13.840
I just put the kids to bed.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.840
The kids are going to school.

14:15.840 --> 14:19.840
Now, I think he probably slowed time.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.840
Slowed it?

14:21.840 --> 14:23.840
What?

14:23.840 --> 14:25.840
Or sped it up.

14:25.840 --> 14:27.840
So you think he moved the sun?

14:27.840 --> 14:29.840
No.

14:29.840 --> 14:31.840
I think the perception of the, let's get this straight.

14:31.840 --> 14:33.840
We've got to figure this out.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.840
I truly believe that that story was just stalling them.

14:36.840 --> 14:39.840
He's like, you shouldn't eat them. You should hang out.

14:39.840 --> 14:42.840
And then he cracked a rock that revealed the sun was there.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.840
Maybe he did that.

14:44.840 --> 14:48.840
My theory is that in Spencer, don't go anywhere.

14:48.840 --> 14:50.840
What's he the lord of?

14:50.840 --> 14:52.840
You know what I'm saying?

14:52.840 --> 14:56.840
Beards?

14:56.840 --> 14:58.840
Not the rings.

14:58.840 --> 15:02.840
The better title, and we don't have to edit much.

15:02.840 --> 15:05.840
The better title, we don't have to edit much.

15:05.840 --> 15:07.840
Lords of the ring.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.840
Lords of the ring.

15:09.840 --> 15:11.840
That's perfect.

15:11.840 --> 15:13.840
Send it out.

15:13.840 --> 15:17.840
We fixed it and didn't have to waste any ink.

15:17.840 --> 15:19.840
It's the other rings.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.840
Even though you acknowledge that they exist,

15:21.840 --> 15:23.840
they don't really play a prominent part.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.840
They don't do anything.

15:25.840 --> 15:29.840
It should also be called jaw.

15:29.840 --> 15:31.840
I see both jaws.

15:31.840 --> 15:33.840
You see two of them.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.840
They make it seem like there's a million jaws.

15:35.840 --> 15:37.840
There's an upper and lower jaw.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.840
Bad example.

15:39.840 --> 15:41.840
I thought I had them for a second.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.840
They should call it Star War.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.840
That's fair.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.840
Okay, all right.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.840
Episode one instead of Brandon.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.840
Stars War.

15:51.840 --> 15:53.840
Because there's multiple stars.

15:53.840 --> 15:55.840
There's one war.

15:55.840 --> 15:57.840
Stars War.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.840
I like this exercise.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.840
They should call it

16:01.840 --> 16:05.840
the horror at a specific house in Amityville.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.840
Right.

16:07.840 --> 16:09.840
Because who are we kidding?

16:09.840 --> 16:11.840
I bet that place was a great place to have brunch.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.840
They should also call them

16:13.840 --> 16:15.840
Mission Possible.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.840
All right.

16:17.840 --> 16:19.840
This is great, guys.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.840
This guy keeps nailing it all the time.

16:21.840 --> 16:23.840
They should call it

16:23.840 --> 16:25.840
Meaningful Woman.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.840
Oh, pretty woman.

16:27.840 --> 16:29.840
Sorry.

16:29.840 --> 16:31.840
Valuable Woman.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.840
That was the story.

16:33.840 --> 16:35.840
They should call it Woman Who Shouldn't Be.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.840
She means more than just her...

16:37.840 --> 16:39.840
Human Woman.

16:39.840 --> 16:41.840
Yeah.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.840
Human Woman, they should call it.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.840
Human Woman.

16:45.840 --> 16:47.840
Walking down the street.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.840
Human Woman.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.840
Richard Garrett likes your feet.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.840
Yeah.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.840
Her existence does not exclude

16:55.840 --> 16:57.840
non-binary people.

16:57.840 --> 16:59.840
You're a foot guy. You're into foot.

16:59.840 --> 17:01.840
You like the foot. You like feet.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.840
Of course. You like feet.

17:03.840 --> 17:05.840
Just jerk out the feet and feed videos and stuff.

17:05.840 --> 17:07.840
I don't get it.

17:07.840 --> 17:09.840
That's the Dead Harmon Foot stab.

17:09.840 --> 17:11.840
So you like jerking off on feet.

17:11.840 --> 17:13.840
Okay.

17:13.840 --> 17:15.840
Would you jerk off on the feet?

17:15.840 --> 17:17.840
I don't know. Nine years from now,

17:17.840 --> 17:19.840
will that be terrible?

17:19.840 --> 17:21.840
Probably.

17:21.840 --> 17:23.840
Okay, well, then I better not.

17:23.840 --> 17:25.840
Feet have rights.

17:25.840 --> 17:27.840
You hate it.

17:27.840 --> 17:29.840
I'm just here doing a show

17:29.840 --> 17:31.840
until I fucking die.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.840
Yes, go on. What's your point

17:33.840 --> 17:35.840
about feet?

17:35.840 --> 17:37.840
I'm happy for you.

17:37.840 --> 17:39.840
Okay.

17:39.840 --> 17:41.840
No, no, no, no.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.840
Okay, so let's get back to the Hobbit thing.

17:43.840 --> 17:45.840
So they're trolls or goblins?

17:45.840 --> 17:47.840
Hobbits?

17:49.840 --> 17:51.840
No, when they

17:51.840 --> 17:53.840
when they turn to stone,

17:53.840 --> 17:55.840
those are trolls.

17:55.840 --> 17:57.840
They're trolls because they might be ogres.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.840
Some like turns trolls to

17:59.840 --> 18:01.840
stone, right?

18:01.840 --> 18:03.840
I remember those being trolls.

18:03.840 --> 18:05.840
Those are trolls.

18:05.840 --> 18:07.840
Why did the sun come

18:07.840 --> 18:09.840
so soon?

18:09.840 --> 18:11.840
I wasn't paying attention to it.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.840
I think what Gandalf did was

18:13.840 --> 18:15.840
he put a spell

18:15.840 --> 18:17.840
on him to make them think

18:17.840 --> 18:19.840
that there was more time

18:19.840 --> 18:21.840
than they thought. Called Pad.

18:21.840 --> 18:23.840
Like he did like a technique

18:23.840 --> 18:25.840
that Penn and Teller did.

18:25.840 --> 18:27.840
Speed time?

18:27.840 --> 18:29.840
Mindfog.

18:29.840 --> 18:31.840
Fascination.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.840
Fascination.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.840
Okay.

18:35.840 --> 18:37.840
All right.

18:37.840 --> 18:39.840
Their feet turned to stone?

18:39.840 --> 18:41.840
Their whole things.

18:41.840 --> 18:43.840
Oh, not just their feet.

18:43.840 --> 18:45.840
They should call it face on.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.840
Yeah.

18:47.840 --> 18:49.840
Faces on.

18:49.840 --> 18:51.840
Faces on.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.840
Oh, yeah, because they put faces on.

18:53.840 --> 18:55.840
There's hardly any of that movie

18:55.840 --> 18:57.840
spent with face off.

18:57.840 --> 18:59.840
No.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.840
Most of that movie is faces on.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.840
Wrong faces on.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.840
They should call it face swap.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.840
Faces swap.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.840
I really hate to interrupt you,

19:09.840 --> 19:11.840
and I mean that sincerely.

19:11.840 --> 19:13.840
I usually love interrupting you,

19:13.840 --> 19:15.840
but I hate interrupting you

19:15.840 --> 19:17.840
because I'm turning over a new link.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.840
I hate interrupting you, so I'm going to interrupt you anyway.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.840
Okay.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.840
Raiders of the Lost Ark.

19:23.840 --> 19:25.840
Nazis go,

19:25.840 --> 19:27.840
we want to get

19:27.840 --> 19:29.840
the Ark of the Covenant

19:29.840 --> 19:31.840
as whoever owns the Ark

19:31.840 --> 19:33.840
wins the war.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.840
Okay, so the Ark of the Covenant.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.840
A Jewish...

19:37.840 --> 19:39.840
Yeah.

19:39.840 --> 19:41.840
Let's get the box of Jew power.

19:41.840 --> 19:43.840
And like, does anybody go...

19:43.840 --> 19:45.840
Okay, so we believe

19:45.840 --> 19:47.840
that this Jewish artifact

19:47.840 --> 19:49.840
is super powerful

19:49.840 --> 19:51.840
and it's got a direct link

19:51.840 --> 19:53.840
to Jesus Christ

19:53.840 --> 19:55.840
not even Jesus.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.840
Fucking Yahweh.

19:57.840 --> 19:59.840
Okay, maybe we're on the wrong side.

19:59.840 --> 20:01.840
Yeah, like...

20:01.840 --> 20:03.840
Maybe the Jews

20:03.840 --> 20:05.840
who we're going to steal

20:05.840 --> 20:07.840
their Death Star in a box

20:07.840 --> 20:09.840
have got...

20:09.840 --> 20:11.840
are onto something.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.840
Maybe they...

20:13.840 --> 20:15.840
they... we are admitting

20:15.840 --> 20:17.840
that it's just God.

20:17.840 --> 20:19.840
He's not going to read the room

20:19.840 --> 20:21.840
when you open this thing.

20:21.840 --> 20:23.840
There's one guy in that movie

20:23.840 --> 20:25.840
that comes up to the guy,

20:25.840 --> 20:27.840
he's uncomfortable with this

20:27.840 --> 20:29.840
Jewish ritual.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.840
And the guy's like, yeah, whatever.

20:31.840 --> 20:33.840
Like, come on, we're going to...

20:33.840 --> 20:35.840
This is going to be great.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.840
You're uncomfortable with it

20:37.840 --> 20:39.840
because it's going to work really good

20:39.840 --> 20:41.840
and we're going to win the war

20:41.840 --> 20:43.840
because of Jew magic.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.840
And you're...

20:45.840 --> 20:47.840
They should have called the movie

20:47.840 --> 20:49.840
Jew magic.

20:49.840 --> 20:51.840
Like, yeah.

20:51.840 --> 20:53.840
But here's the...

20:53.840 --> 20:55.840
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

20:55.840 --> 20:57.840
So we're...

20:57.840 --> 20:59.840
We're going out of our way.

20:59.840 --> 21:01.840
We've got a special task for us.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.840
We've got one guy

21:03.840 --> 21:05.840
that's going to track down Mary

21:05.840 --> 21:07.840
and we've got the fucking... the thing

21:07.840 --> 21:09.840
that's going to put it on the other thing

21:09.840 --> 21:11.840
and then we'll know where the thing is

21:11.840 --> 21:13.840
and that thing is going to make us win the war

21:13.840 --> 21:15.840
because it's super powerful

21:15.840 --> 21:17.840
because it's connected to God.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.840
Wait a minute, God? The God?

21:19.840 --> 21:21.840
Yes, God. How?

21:21.840 --> 21:23.840
They're Jewish. The Hebrews are on to something.

21:23.840 --> 21:25.840
They're on to something. What? Religion.

21:25.840 --> 21:27.840
They're religion? We don't have a religion.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.840
Maybe we should get a religion. What are you crazy?

21:29.840 --> 21:31.840
Maybe we should just join forces with them.

21:31.840 --> 21:33.840
Why are we doing this?

21:33.840 --> 21:35.840
God kind of likes them.

21:35.840 --> 21:37.840
Why are we killing everybody?

21:37.840 --> 21:39.840
What?

21:39.840 --> 21:41.840
Hitler doesn't like that kind of talk.

21:41.840 --> 21:43.840
He just wants us to look at...

21:43.840 --> 21:45.840
We just got to feed the beast.

21:45.840 --> 21:47.840
This is thousands of years ago.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.840
We did the biplane

21:49.840 --> 21:51.840
and we did the Messerschmitt

21:51.840 --> 21:53.840
and the apple pie kuchen

21:53.840 --> 21:55.840
and stuff. What are we doing here?

21:55.840 --> 21:57.840
That's all we got. We got the kuchen,

21:57.840 --> 21:59.840
the tank and the Messerschmitt

21:59.840 --> 22:01.840
and they've got a box

22:01.840 --> 22:03.840
with Moses' bones in there

22:03.840 --> 22:05.840
that'll shoot a laser

22:05.840 --> 22:07.840
and melt everybody

22:07.840 --> 22:09.840
and we're saying that they're rat people

22:09.840 --> 22:11.840
and they should be destroyed.

22:11.840 --> 22:13.840
It doesn't make any sense. What are we doing here?

22:13.840 --> 22:15.840
What's pointed at ourselves?

22:15.840 --> 22:17.840
Also, you can't put a rock inside

22:17.840 --> 22:19.840
of a tank and it blows the tank up.

22:19.840 --> 22:21.840
It'll just shoot the rock out.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.840
Remember when they put the fucking rock in there?

22:23.840 --> 22:25.840
Wait, who put a rock? Is that the third one?

22:25.840 --> 22:27.840
Somebody runs alongside?

22:27.840 --> 22:29.840
That's the third one, right?

22:29.840 --> 22:31.840
One more Indiana Jones...

22:31.840 --> 22:33.840
One more Raiders note.

22:33.840 --> 22:35.840
Bellach, arg.

22:35.840 --> 22:37.840
What the fuck?

22:37.840 --> 22:39.840
Dr. Jones, I am your shadow self.

22:39.840 --> 22:41.840
Oh, this watch.

22:41.840 --> 22:43.840
If you bury it, it becomes valuable.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.840
God doesn't exist. I'm the shadow you cast

22:45.840 --> 22:47.840
with your atheism. I'm Bellach.

22:47.840 --> 22:49.840
I'm the evil version of you.

22:49.840 --> 22:51.840
I'm a cautionary tale. I hold nothing sacred.

22:51.840 --> 22:53.840
I'm the guy that didn't give a fuck

22:53.840 --> 22:55.840
about the idol. I just want to keep it

22:55.840 --> 22:57.840
so I'm able to speak the language

22:57.840 --> 22:59.840
that the natives speak and so you,

22:59.840 --> 23:01.840
who are going to put it in a museum, have to run from them.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.840
How ironic. I'm the smarmy guy

23:03.840 --> 23:05.840
that knows the shit, knows how to play the game

23:05.840 --> 23:07.840
but I don't believe in God.

23:07.840 --> 23:09.840
Either do you. You're just an academic.

23:09.840 --> 23:11.840
You work in a museum and then it's like they sit down

23:11.840 --> 23:13.840
and he's like, hey, isn't it great?

23:13.840 --> 23:15.840
We're both atheists. We both give

23:15.840 --> 23:17.840
two shits about people's culture

23:17.840 --> 23:19.840
and what the fuck. But Bellach

23:19.840 --> 23:21.840
is the guy who's just like, I can't

23:21.840 --> 23:23.840
wait and I don't care if Hitler.

23:23.840 --> 23:25.840
Hitler can take a flying fuck.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.840
He just emerges as this weird

23:27.840 --> 23:29.840
like, he's like, fuck you guys.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.840
I believe in God. I'm going to put on this

23:31.840 --> 23:33.840
Pope hat and I'm going to open this thing

23:33.840 --> 23:35.840
and the Nazis are like, I just

23:35.840 --> 23:37.840
thought of this. He's like, go fuck yourself. Open it.

23:37.840 --> 23:39.840
Like, where did that,

23:39.840 --> 23:41.840
where was that Bellach

23:41.840 --> 23:43.840
when he was closing the well? I was like, hey, Bellach

23:43.840 --> 23:45.840
you believe in God. Don't seal me in here. Fuck you.

23:45.840 --> 23:47.840
He really

23:47.840 --> 23:49.840
thought. I mean, he put on the outfit.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.840
They've got the cameras running.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.840
They're like going,

23:53.840 --> 23:55.840
something's going to happen. What was Bellach

23:55.840 --> 23:57.840
hoping would happen? I know the Nazis hoped

23:57.840 --> 23:59.840
that God's ghost

23:59.840 --> 24:01.840
would come out and go

24:01.840 --> 24:03.840
boo.

24:03.840 --> 24:05.840
And they'd go boo for Jews

24:05.840 --> 24:07.840
and that God would be like, hey

24:07.840 --> 24:09.840
you opened the box. I'm like

24:09.840 --> 24:11.840
a genie, genie rules.

24:11.840 --> 24:13.840
And they'd be like, good

24:13.840 --> 24:15.840
Heil Hitler and the God would be like, Heil

24:15.840 --> 24:17.840
who?

24:17.840 --> 24:19.840
Okay, whatever you say, just give me more ghost

24:19.840 --> 24:21.840
snacks.

24:21.840 --> 24:23.840
And it tracks with Nazis

24:23.840 --> 24:25.840
They should have called the movie ghost snacks.

24:25.840 --> 24:27.840
But

24:27.840 --> 24:29.840
Bellach was like, it's just

24:29.840 --> 24:31.840
weird that like, he's got the

24:31.840 --> 24:33.840
bazooka, Indiana Jones is like, I'm going to blow

24:33.840 --> 24:35.840
it up and Bellach's like, go ahead

24:35.840 --> 24:37.840
blow it up. You know you want to open

24:37.840 --> 24:39.840
this box as bad as I do.

24:39.840 --> 24:41.840
I never really got

24:41.840 --> 24:43.840
it. But then if you don't

24:43.840 --> 24:45.840
look at it, you're okay.

24:45.840 --> 24:47.840
Close your eyes. I looked this up.

24:47.840 --> 24:49.840
That is a deleted scene.

24:49.840 --> 24:51.840
Seriously, there was a scene

24:51.840 --> 24:53.840
where it says, only

24:53.840 --> 24:55.840
if you look on this

24:55.840 --> 24:57.840
without blah blah blah. There was something

24:57.840 --> 24:59.840
in there. Well, I vote

24:59.840 --> 25:01.840
undelete. I

25:01.840 --> 25:03.840
needed that. I was like, close your eyes.

25:03.840 --> 25:05.840
Okay, I mean I granted

25:05.840 --> 25:07.840
nothing much else to do.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.840
He can't say, break your ropes.

25:09.840 --> 25:11.840
I don't know if it was a deleted scene, but it

25:11.840 --> 25:13.840
was in the script. Now,

25:13.840 --> 25:15.840
can I say,

25:15.840 --> 25:17.840
because you haven't said it yet, maybe if they fix

25:17.840 --> 25:19.840
it, they'll be famous.

25:19.840 --> 25:21.840
Yeah, you can do that. I don't do that

25:21.840 --> 25:23.840
anymore. It's positive

25:23.840 --> 25:25.840
Rob, the microphone farter.

25:27.840 --> 25:29.840
I'm glad to get that stuff off my chest. I wonder how many

25:29.840 --> 25:31.840
of these kids even saw this movie about this guy

25:31.840 --> 25:33.840
that raids a lost Ark.

25:33.840 --> 25:35.840
You

25:35.840 --> 25:37.840
don't have to try to impress me.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.840
I don't need you.

25:39.840 --> 25:41.840
I'm not one of these people that's like,

25:41.840 --> 25:43.840
you know, I don't care. Okay, pick any religion.

25:43.840 --> 25:45.840
Any religion.

25:45.840 --> 25:47.840
Pick any religion.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.840
Judaism.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.840
Something that we were raised in.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.840
Lutheranism.

25:53.840 --> 25:55.840
Oh, Catholicism.

25:55.840 --> 25:57.840
Jesus fucking Christ.

25:57.840 --> 25:59.840
There's a finite number of religions.

25:59.840 --> 26:01.840
Shinto.

26:01.840 --> 26:03.840
Shinto.

26:03.840 --> 26:05.840
We're at war with the Shinto's.

26:05.840 --> 26:07.840
I hear

26:07.840 --> 26:09.840
that they have

26:09.840 --> 26:11.840
a magic hat.

26:11.840 --> 26:13.840
That if you put it on,

26:13.840 --> 26:15.840
it will

26:15.840 --> 26:17.840
kill everybody

26:17.840 --> 26:19.840
because their religion is real.

26:19.840 --> 26:21.840
Because it has the power of the Shinto God.

26:21.840 --> 26:23.840
Right, because

26:23.840 --> 26:25.840
their religion is real. They believe in a God.

26:25.840 --> 26:27.840
The people that we hate.

26:27.840 --> 26:29.840
That if you put this hat on

26:29.840 --> 26:31.840
and you look at somebody,

26:31.840 --> 26:33.840
they'll melt and everything like that.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.840
So they have it?

26:35.840 --> 26:37.840
They have it because, yes, it's their religion

26:37.840 --> 26:39.840
and we don't like them. Well, why haven't they won yet?

26:39.840 --> 26:41.840
We've been killing them for a while.

26:41.840 --> 26:43.840
It's lost.

26:43.840 --> 26:45.840
Are you thinking where I'm thinking?

26:45.840 --> 26:47.840
I'm thinking we find the thing

26:47.840 --> 26:49.840
before they do,

26:49.840 --> 26:51.840
put it on,

26:51.840 --> 26:53.840
and then kill them with their own God.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.840
Let me just back up.

26:55.840 --> 26:57.840
The reason we don't like them

26:57.840 --> 26:59.840
is because of their faith.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.840
Yeah, I mean, it's gross.

27:01.840 --> 27:03.840
I have a lot of questions about it. Ding dong.

27:03.840 --> 27:05.840
Oh, hello.

27:05.840 --> 27:07.840
Guys, I've started to interrupt an important meeting.

27:07.840 --> 27:09.840
There's a very sexy archaeologist

27:09.840 --> 27:11.840
who is...

27:11.840 --> 27:13.840
I think he might

27:13.840 --> 27:15.840
have the hat. Send him in.

27:15.840 --> 27:17.840
No, no, I'm saying

27:17.840 --> 27:19.840
the hat you're looking for, the magic Shinto hat.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.840
I think there's a

27:21.840 --> 27:23.840
atheist archaeologist who has your hat.

27:23.840 --> 27:25.840
He came here? No, no, he's got the hat.

27:25.840 --> 27:27.840
Oh, you mean you found out about him?

27:27.840 --> 27:29.840
Okay, well, Brian, I thought you were Amazon.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.840
No, what?

27:31.840 --> 27:33.840
I'm waiting for a mouse.

27:33.840 --> 27:35.840
I'm saying...

27:35.840 --> 27:37.840
Look, you can be passive aggressive if you want.

27:37.840 --> 27:39.840
I'm saying I think the guy...

27:39.840 --> 27:41.840
I'm being absolutely actively aggressive, don't you, Brian?

27:41.840 --> 27:43.840
How about this?

27:43.840 --> 27:45.840
I'm telling you, there's an atheist

27:45.840 --> 27:47.840
archaeologist

27:47.840 --> 27:49.840
archaeologist that might have your magic Shinto hat.

27:49.840 --> 27:51.840
Well, let's go...

27:51.840 --> 27:53.840
I'm saying you guys should double your efforts.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.840
I just snapped at you. Okay, that's right.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.840
Thank you. I didn't understand what you meant.

27:57.840 --> 27:59.840
I thought he was in the lobby.

27:59.840 --> 28:01.840
Thank you, Brian.

28:01.840 --> 28:03.840
Hey, let me take you aside. Listen, I know it's

28:03.840 --> 28:05.840
Christmas time and I heard about your dad.

28:05.840 --> 28:07.840
It's not traditional

28:07.840 --> 28:09.840
to tell people a bonus

28:09.840 --> 28:11.840
is coming, but like...

28:11.840 --> 28:13.840
Am I Brian?

28:13.840 --> 28:15.840
Yeah, you're right.

28:15.840 --> 28:17.840
I want to give you your Christmas bonus

28:17.840 --> 28:19.840
early. I'm going to have Shirley

28:19.840 --> 28:21.840
write you a check, because it might help

28:21.840 --> 28:23.840
your dad's radiology. This seems like a trap.

28:23.840 --> 28:25.840
No.

28:25.840 --> 28:27.840
We're not Nazis to each other.

28:29.840 --> 28:31.840
The whole point is

28:31.840 --> 28:33.840
to help.

28:33.840 --> 28:35.840
Okay.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.840
Or tell on you if you're gay.

28:37.840 --> 28:39.840
Okay, well, let's unpack that.

28:39.840 --> 28:41.840
Well, you're not gay.

28:41.840 --> 28:43.840
Are you? Because I'll put you on a list and they'll

28:43.840 --> 28:45.840
turn you in.

28:45.840 --> 28:47.840
That's my job as a Nazi.

28:47.840 --> 28:49.840
I'm gender fluid.

28:49.840 --> 28:51.840
Ooh.

28:51.840 --> 28:53.840
Boy.

28:53.840 --> 28:55.840
Huh?

28:55.840 --> 28:57.840
Sorry, I had a little Tim Allen act

28:57.840 --> 28:59.840
right there.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.840
Nazi style.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.840
My third rite got kind of home-improved

29:03.840 --> 29:05.840
down to...

29:05.840 --> 29:07.840
I'm going to put my two-week notice in and quit,

29:07.840 --> 29:09.840
and also I don't give a fuck about your magic hat.

29:09.840 --> 29:11.840
Also, look,

29:11.840 --> 29:13.840
you work for a company that thinks that hats are magic

29:13.840 --> 29:15.840
and this whole thing is stupid.

29:15.840 --> 29:17.840
Brian,

29:17.840 --> 29:19.840
take a breath. You're incredibly important to me.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.840
I won't turn you in.

29:21.840 --> 29:23.840
I will personally recognize

29:23.840 --> 29:25.840
behind closed doors your gender fluidity

29:25.840 --> 29:27.840
if you never tell

29:27.840 --> 29:29.840
anyone that I did that.

29:29.840 --> 29:31.840
And what are you hiding? It seems like there's nothing.

29:31.840 --> 29:33.840
Hiding my approval of you.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.840
That's a lot.

29:35.840 --> 29:37.840
That's me going an extra mile for you in a Nazi

29:37.840 --> 29:39.840
empire. I'm doing...

29:39.840 --> 29:41.840
I'm practically a chindler here.

29:41.840 --> 29:43.840
Boss, you're so DL.

29:43.840 --> 29:45.840
It's not even...

29:45.840 --> 29:47.840
You're so DL.

29:47.840 --> 29:49.840
Download?

29:49.840 --> 29:51.840
Everybody fucking knows.

29:51.840 --> 29:53.840
Everybody knows.

29:53.840 --> 29:55.840
I'm download?

29:55.840 --> 29:57.840
You're download, you weird gender

29:57.840 --> 29:59.840
fluid Nazi?

29:59.840 --> 30:01.840
I already quit.

30:01.840 --> 30:03.840
Good luck out there.

30:03.840 --> 30:05.840
How about this?

30:05.840 --> 30:07.840
I won't tell you where the archaeologist is

30:07.840 --> 30:09.840
with your fucking eyes.

30:09.840 --> 30:11.840
Come on.

30:11.840 --> 30:13.840
He's hard to look up.

30:13.840 --> 30:15.840
Brian, get in. Will you come in?

30:15.840 --> 30:17.840
See?

30:17.840 --> 30:19.840
I'll give you a raise.

30:19.840 --> 30:21.840
I'll forget what you said

30:21.840 --> 30:23.840
about gender fluidity.

30:23.840 --> 30:25.840
Why?

30:25.840 --> 30:27.840
You're going to be the first gender fluid Nazi.

30:27.840 --> 30:29.840
I never gave a shit about it.

30:29.840 --> 30:31.840
This is that important.

30:31.840 --> 30:33.840
You're just so hung up on your own shit.

30:33.840 --> 30:35.840
You brought it up.

30:35.840 --> 30:37.840
You laid that up my doorstep.

30:37.840 --> 30:39.840
It's a fascist empire.

30:39.840 --> 30:41.840
I have to report you or I'm guilty of silence.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.840
How bad do you want this magic?

30:43.840 --> 30:45.840
How important is that to you?

30:45.840 --> 30:47.840
I'm telling you how badly.

30:47.840 --> 30:49.840
I'm telling you I'm willing to forget

30:49.840 --> 30:51.840
what you told me about yourself.

30:51.840 --> 30:53.840
I'm willing to pinch the hose of honesty

30:53.840 --> 30:55.840
just enough to extend your career

30:55.840 --> 30:57.840
and your ascension through the fascist ranks.

30:57.840 --> 30:59.840
That's the best gift we can give each other.

30:59.840 --> 31:01.840
That's what we do.

31:01.840 --> 31:03.840
This is what we do here at Nazi.

31:03.840 --> 31:05.840
We withhold damaging information about each other.

31:05.840 --> 31:07.840
That's a high five.

31:07.840 --> 31:09.840
I could have told so many other people

31:09.840 --> 31:11.840
what that was.

31:11.840 --> 31:13.840
That's what I don't want you to do.

31:13.840 --> 31:15.840
I'm coming clean.

31:15.840 --> 31:17.840
I'm laying a couple of cards in the table.

31:17.840 --> 31:19.840
Now I have the leverage.

31:19.840 --> 31:21.840
I would like to know who this archaeologist is.

31:21.840 --> 31:23.840
Of course you would.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.840
I'm promising you as a Nazi.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.840
How about this?

31:27.840 --> 31:29.840
I would like you to be honest with me for one minute.

31:29.840 --> 31:31.840
Then I'll tell you anything you want to know.

31:31.840 --> 31:33.840
You've earned that.

31:33.840 --> 31:43.840
I'm willing to pinch the hose of honesty.

31:43.840 --> 31:45.840
Could you give us five minutes?

31:45.840 --> 31:47.840
Yes.

31:49.840 --> 31:51.840
Brian, what does that mean?

31:51.840 --> 31:53.840
That was a metaphor

31:53.840 --> 31:55.840
that you brought up and I thought

31:55.840 --> 31:57.840
that you were being DL again.

31:57.840 --> 31:59.840
DL? What does DL mean?

31:59.840 --> 32:01.840
You're on the down low.

32:01.840 --> 32:03.840
Down low?

32:03.840 --> 32:05.840
Yes, you're on the down low.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.840
You're being closeted.

32:07.840 --> 32:09.840
You think I'm DL?

32:09.840 --> 32:11.840
Everybody knows that.

32:11.840 --> 32:13.840
You think I'm a gay Nazi?

32:13.840 --> 32:15.840
You're the most down low.

32:15.840 --> 32:17.840
There's such a thing as a gay Nazi.

32:17.840 --> 32:19.840
That's the call.

32:23.840 --> 32:25.840
Sorry.

32:25.840 --> 32:27.840
I thought you guys were done.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.840
I'm not saying you're a gay Nazi.

32:29.840 --> 32:31.840
I'm just saying like,

32:31.840 --> 32:33.840
you can be honest about the fluidity

32:33.840 --> 32:35.840
of what's going on with you.

32:35.840 --> 32:37.840
This isn't about magic hats.

32:37.840 --> 32:39.840
No, we have to.

32:39.840 --> 32:41.840
Everything is about magic hats.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.840
Is it? Okay.

32:43.840 --> 32:45.840
Yes, because if I find the magic hat,

32:45.840 --> 32:47.840
I'll be a fucking gay Nazi.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.840
I can change the system from the inside.

32:53.840 --> 32:55.840
Just tell me you're a gay Nazi

32:55.840 --> 32:57.840
and I'll get you the hat.

32:57.840 --> 32:59.840
I can't get you the hat.

32:59.840 --> 33:01.840
I can tell you where the

33:01.840 --> 33:03.840
sexy cis male

33:03.840 --> 33:05.840
archaeologist

33:05.840 --> 33:07.840
who knows where the hat is.

33:07.840 --> 33:09.840
You're going to have to fight a cis white male

33:09.840 --> 33:11.840
fucking

33:11.840 --> 33:13.840
archaeologist for this hat.

33:13.840 --> 33:15.840
This is a phitom. The Americans are this close

33:15.840 --> 33:17.840
to flipping. We'll find them.

33:17.840 --> 33:19.840
We just got to talk to them.

33:19.840 --> 33:21.840
Look, we all hate Shinto people.

33:21.840 --> 33:23.840
We're on a razor's edge here.

33:23.840 --> 33:25.840
Tell me three things about Shinto.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.840
They believe...

33:29.840 --> 33:31.840
It doesn't matter.

33:31.840 --> 33:33.840
Is that a...

33:33.840 --> 33:35.840
You just want...

33:35.840 --> 33:37.840
Tell me three things about being gender fluid.

33:37.840 --> 33:39.840
I know. Let me write it down.

33:39.840 --> 33:41.840
Right?

33:41.840 --> 33:43.840
What do you know about it?

33:43.840 --> 33:45.840
It goes in my file.

33:45.840 --> 33:47.840
That's what you're doing.

33:47.840 --> 33:49.840
I'm a Nazi. That's what's important.

33:49.840 --> 33:51.840
It's not this magic hat so you get to be

33:51.840 --> 33:53.840
the biggest gay Nazi in the world

33:53.840 --> 33:55.840
and feel okay about it.

33:55.840 --> 33:57.840
Which is alright. It's okay to be a gay Nazi.

33:57.840 --> 33:59.840
You can be the gayest Nazi.

33:59.840 --> 34:01.840
I want to do right by...

34:01.840 --> 34:03.840
Do you think Hermann Göring is a straight Nazi?

34:03.840 --> 34:05.840
He's a guy...

34:05.840 --> 34:07.840
See? Right?

34:07.840 --> 34:09.840
Shit! Fuck! God damn it!

34:11.840 --> 34:13.840
I was going like this.

34:13.840 --> 34:15.840
He stole all of Gustav Klimt's art.

34:15.840 --> 34:17.840
He stole Gustav Klimt's art.

34:17.840 --> 34:19.840
Like...

34:19.840 --> 34:21.840
Okay, okay.

34:21.840 --> 34:23.840
What do you want me to...

34:23.840 --> 34:25.840
Nobody does anything except for the microphones.

34:25.840 --> 34:27.840
Okay. Cone of silence between you and me.

34:27.840 --> 34:29.840
We have an alliance.

34:29.840 --> 34:31.840
I have no horse in this race.

34:31.840 --> 34:33.840
I was like...

34:33.840 --> 34:35.840
We're not going to change Nazism from the outside.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.840
Like, let's...

34:37.840 --> 34:39.840
You be a trans Nazi. I'll be a gay Nazi.

34:39.840 --> 34:41.840
We can't be out.

34:41.840 --> 34:43.840
I'm not trans and fluid.

34:43.840 --> 34:45.840
I'm sorry I got the language wrong.

34:45.840 --> 34:47.840
Like, what are you, a trans Nazi Nazi?

34:49.840 --> 34:51.840
Because I won't tolerate that.

34:53.840 --> 34:55.840
I believe in freedom of speech.

34:57.840 --> 34:59.840
Don't you dare try to refine my language.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.840
Bitch!

35:05.840 --> 35:07.840
Let's just keep each other's secrets.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.840
Because otherwise we don't do each other any good dead.

35:11.840 --> 35:13.840
I just don't see the future in our...

35:13.840 --> 35:15.840
This relationship.

35:15.840 --> 35:17.840
Hold on a second!

35:17.840 --> 35:19.840
And if you listen at the door, I will fucking

35:19.840 --> 35:21.840
convince people you're Jewish.

35:21.840 --> 35:23.840
Sorry.

35:23.840 --> 35:25.840
I'll tell you our future, Brian.

35:25.840 --> 35:27.840
Our future is

35:27.840 --> 35:29.840
we are the Nazis that deliver

35:29.840 --> 35:31.840
the magic hat to defeat the Shinto's.

35:31.840 --> 35:33.840
You don't...

35:33.840 --> 35:35.840
And then after we do that,

35:35.840 --> 35:37.840
come on, at the rap party

35:37.840 --> 35:39.840
for World War II.

35:39.840 --> 35:41.840
Guess what's okay now

35:41.840 --> 35:43.840
by the ice sculpture?

35:43.840 --> 35:45.840
Like, oh by the way,

35:45.840 --> 35:47.840
sometimes I...

35:47.840 --> 35:49.840
And we fucking change it.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.840
We change shit from the inside.

35:51.840 --> 35:53.840
We're not going to change anything from outside.

35:53.840 --> 35:55.840
Come on, just fucking sell out with me,

35:55.840 --> 35:57.840
make me this deal.

35:57.840 --> 35:59.840
What?

35:59.840 --> 36:01.840
The airplane's ready.

36:01.840 --> 36:03.840
Fuck, they just invented it.

36:07.840 --> 36:09.840
They invented it 42 years ago.

36:09.840 --> 36:11.840
No, I know it. This is a special airplane.

36:11.840 --> 36:13.840
Okay.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.840
It's pretty special.

36:17.840 --> 36:19.840
I got to be honest with you.

36:19.840 --> 36:21.840
I'm not super confident that if I give you

36:21.840 --> 36:23.840
the whereabouts of the magic hat

36:23.840 --> 36:25.840
Shinto had,

36:25.840 --> 36:27.840
you're going to use this for the right reasons.

36:27.840 --> 36:29.840
Maybe the

36:29.840 --> 36:31.840
cis white male guy should have that.

36:31.840 --> 36:33.840
Oh yeah, you should go trust

36:33.840 --> 36:35.840
the one Nazi down the hall

36:35.840 --> 36:37.840
that doesn't share this

36:37.840 --> 36:39.840
shame with you.

36:39.840 --> 36:41.840
You didn't share shit.

36:41.840 --> 36:43.840
We have our fucking balls by the

36:43.840 --> 36:45.840
nut hair.

36:45.840 --> 36:47.840
This is called a fucking

36:47.840 --> 36:49.840
friendship you can believe in.

36:49.840 --> 36:51.840
Nazi style. We could each destroy each other.

36:51.840 --> 36:53.840
Now let's move up together.

36:53.840 --> 36:55.840
I pinky Nazi swear.

36:55.840 --> 36:57.840
I will never tell anybody

36:57.840 --> 36:59.840
about your fluidity.

36:59.840 --> 37:01.840
You never tell anybody I'm gay.

37:01.840 --> 37:03.840
If you violate the pinky Nazi square,

37:03.840 --> 37:05.840
you realize what the consequences of that are.

37:05.840 --> 37:07.840
Fucking A, man.

37:07.840 --> 37:09.840
Yeah.

37:09.840 --> 37:11.840
Of course I know.

37:11.840 --> 37:13.840
What?

37:13.840 --> 37:15.840
That's the most sacred oath of Nazi.

37:15.840 --> 37:17.840
Yeah, in other words,

37:17.840 --> 37:19.840
we have a thing that you can betray.

37:19.840 --> 37:21.840
Okay, pinky Nazi square.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.840
Pinky Nazi square.

37:23.840 --> 37:25.840
And you're not going to...

37:25.840 --> 37:27.840
It's a pinky...

37:27.840 --> 37:29.840
If I violate this shit,

37:29.840 --> 37:31.840
if either of us violates this shit,

37:31.840 --> 37:33.840
we're worse than a Nazi.

37:33.840 --> 37:35.840
We sell out.

37:35.840 --> 37:37.840
And a coward.

37:37.840 --> 37:39.840
What's wrong with being a Nazi?

37:39.840 --> 37:41.840
Did I...

37:41.840 --> 37:43.840
Did I use that as a metric of madness?

37:43.840 --> 37:45.840
Yes.

37:45.840 --> 37:47.840
Well, look.

37:47.840 --> 37:49.840
In my defense...

37:49.840 --> 37:51.840
It's funny you say that.

37:51.840 --> 37:53.840
I work for the Gestapo,

37:53.840 --> 37:55.840
and you just admitted that you're a

37:55.840 --> 37:57.840
self-shaming Nazi.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.840
Brian, come on. Anyone can do that.

37:59.840 --> 38:01.840
I work for the Gestapo.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.840
I take off my lightweight tunic,

38:03.840 --> 38:05.840
and underneath it is a leather jacket.

38:05.840 --> 38:07.840
Yeah, well, I take off

38:07.840 --> 38:09.840
my lightweight tunic,

38:09.840 --> 38:11.840
and now I don't have to close on.

38:11.840 --> 38:13.840
I take off...

38:13.840 --> 38:15.840
I take off my leather jacket,

38:15.840 --> 38:17.840
and now I'm nude.

38:17.840 --> 38:19.840
I'm already nude, and I've been working out.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.840
I...

38:21.840 --> 38:23.840
I take out a bottle of baby oil,

38:23.840 --> 38:25.840
and I start putting it on my thighs.

38:25.840 --> 38:27.840
I fucking put...

38:27.840 --> 38:29.840
Get the fuck out!

38:29.840 --> 38:31.840
It's exactly what it looks like.

38:31.840 --> 38:33.840
I'll tell the airplane it could just go.

38:33.840 --> 38:35.840
No, Walter, get in here, Walter.

38:35.840 --> 38:37.840
Okay.

38:37.840 --> 38:39.840
I don't want to come in.

38:39.840 --> 38:41.840
Walter, I don't want to come in.

38:41.840 --> 38:43.840
Walter, get the fuck in here.

38:43.840 --> 38:45.840
I will send you straight to fucking downtown.

38:45.840 --> 38:47.840
Walter, if you walk away,

38:47.840 --> 38:49.840
so help me God, I may go down,

38:49.840 --> 38:51.840
but I will make sure you go down

38:51.840 --> 38:53.840
six times as much.

38:53.840 --> 38:55.840
That's what she said.

38:55.840 --> 38:57.840
Walter, you fucking...

38:57.840 --> 38:59.840
Walter, get in here.

38:59.840 --> 39:01.840
You knocked and then opened the door.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.840
You don't do that.

39:03.840 --> 39:05.840
It defeats the purpose of the knock.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.840
You fucking knock, knock, knock, open.

39:07.840 --> 39:09.840
It doesn't matter.

39:09.840 --> 39:11.840
Yeah.

39:11.840 --> 39:13.840
Walter, you need to watch this.

39:13.840 --> 39:15.840
Okay.

39:15.840 --> 39:17.840
So that you are culpable.

39:17.840 --> 39:19.840
We all have something on each other now.

39:23.840 --> 39:25.840
I'm holding you and kissing you.

39:25.840 --> 39:27.840
And we're making Walter watch it,

39:27.840 --> 39:29.840
which is pretty bad,

39:29.840 --> 39:31.840
but we are Nazis.

39:33.840 --> 39:35.840
All right, then we do it.

39:35.840 --> 39:37.840
We're doing it.

39:37.840 --> 39:39.840
Are we doing it?

39:39.840 --> 39:41.840
Do you want it done?

39:41.840 --> 39:43.840
No, no, it's three weeks later.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.840
Three weeks.

39:45.840 --> 39:47.840
Jesus Christ, someone give me water.

39:47.840 --> 39:49.840
Oh, my fucking God,

39:49.840 --> 39:51.840
I love this job.

39:51.840 --> 39:53.840
You know something?

39:53.840 --> 39:55.840
You convinced me.

39:55.840 --> 39:57.840
You wore me down.

39:57.840 --> 39:59.840
Hold my calls.

39:59.840 --> 40:01.840
Unhold them.

40:01.840 --> 40:03.840
No, I said hold my calls.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.840
Three weeks.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.840
Oh, my God.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.840
It's an old Nazi gay joke.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.840
Now, Brian,

40:13.840 --> 40:15.840
can we go see this guy?

40:15.840 --> 40:17.840
Oh, guys, ding dong.

40:17.840 --> 40:19.840
I have a delivery here.

40:19.840 --> 40:21.840
I have a box.

40:21.840 --> 40:23.840
This is a nice gift.

40:23.840 --> 40:25.840
I would like you to open this up.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.840
Thank you, Brian.

40:27.840 --> 40:29.840
It looks a little bit like a hat box.

40:29.840 --> 40:31.840
Thank you, Brian.

40:31.840 --> 40:33.840
No spoilers, but it looks a little bit like a hat box.

40:33.840 --> 40:35.840
Oh, Heil Hitler, Brian.

40:35.840 --> 40:37.840
Three weeks.

40:37.840 --> 40:39.840
Thank you.

40:39.840 --> 40:41.840
What have we got in here?

40:41.840 --> 40:43.840
Oh, Shinto hat.

40:43.840 --> 40:45.840
Oh, my gosh.

40:45.840 --> 40:47.840
Turn your eyes away.

40:47.840 --> 40:49.840
Turn your eyes away.

40:49.840 --> 40:51.840
Hang on.

40:55.840 --> 40:57.840
Ghosts of my grandparents.

41:01.840 --> 41:03.840
They're playing my ribs like a Xylophone.

41:05.840 --> 41:07.840
Up my ass and out of my mouth.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.840
The fucking spirits of death.

41:09.840 --> 41:11.840
Oh, God.

41:11.840 --> 41:13.840
The fucking Old Testament wrath of Shinto.

41:13.840 --> 41:15.840
Oh, my God.

41:15.840 --> 41:22.480
every nerve ending it burns with the fire of fucking evil everything I was

41:22.480 --> 41:31.120
ever told by my unconscious is true I chose wrong I chose wrong I was fine

41:31.120 --> 41:40.680
being gay but I shouldn't have been a nazi they're telling me that the

41:40.680 --> 41:47.720
ghosts are saying this isn't because you were gay it's important to people to

41:47.720 --> 41:51.800
clarify that after they see the whole world they're like what you don't hurt

41:51.800 --> 41:56.000
anybody by being gay you hurt everyone by being a nazi

41:56.000 --> 42:09.680
what do you think of that Spencer I was I was trying to come up with rap

42:09.680 --> 42:14.440
lyrics I think I think a takeaway is that Shinto sounds pretty fucked up yeah

42:14.440 --> 42:30.480
Spencer yeah Shinto thoughts what do you think thumbs up thumbs down on Shinto

42:30.480 --> 42:35.560
they really had it all figured out with that hat huh there's really no need to

42:35.560 --> 42:40.480
argue once you have an artifact like that from which to base a religion how do

42:40.480 --> 42:44.840
you think that how do you think having that hat went south for the Shinto they

42:44.840 --> 42:47.400
lost it

it's gonna be in a church right you're not gonna have like a vegan funeral where

45:23.880 --> 45:27.280
they where they shoot arrows made out it's funny because it's something that's

45:27.280 --> 45:34.200
important to me that's why it's funny that's why it's funny

45:35.320 --> 45:40.720
it's funny the one thing no it's funny the idea of vegans as like Vikings that

45:40.720 --> 45:44.700
they have like a special funeral it is legitimately funny I give myself an A

45:44.700 --> 45:49.560

45:49.560 --> 45:54.320

45:54.320 --> 45:59.960

great you're gonna be so successful and happy big words yeah it's really me

48:24.960 --> 48:29.680
you're gonna be so jazzed you know be cool to do I'm gonna gain the ability to

48:29.680 --> 48:37.160
not return text yeah let's say you you just got you got crushed by a falling

48:37.160 --> 48:41.040
piano tomorrow and your funeral happened that you didn't you didn't write up a

48:41.040 --> 48:46.000
like right dick first a pitch meaning about how you want piano falls on your

48:46.000 --> 48:50.800
dick right and that and you slowly die I'm pretty I'm pretty sure we don't need

48:50.800 --> 48:55.760
to like invent a sudden death for me to not have met the deadline of writing up

48:55.760 --> 49:00.840
how I should be buried let's say probably put that project off let's say

49:00.840 --> 49:04.840
your friends and family get up there who do you expect would be first it

49:04.840 --> 49:15.640
probably event Nicole Brown from seems like she's a you guys are pretty tight

49:15.640 --> 49:21.280
well I just know she's a Christian person and she'd be like oh god Dan died

49:21.280 --> 49:25.240
and I'm like you weren't joking you're saying that event gets up there first I

49:25.240 --> 49:28.880
think I think you can guarantee she seems like I'm a person that would hope that

49:28.880 --> 49:34.400
would be emotional but be composed she always had higher hopes for me you know

49:34.400 --> 49:39.840
she was a Christian do you think Chevy gets in there at all or no I have a

49:39.840 --> 49:50.120
feeling like he'll be otherwise disposed do you think Rob will get up there

49:50.120 --> 49:56.680
and speak me look you know and I mean this is like it's a year I could stay

49:56.680 --> 50:01.120
on the outside of this of this of this concept which where I'm like doing bits

50:01.120 --> 50:04.880
or like but I don't think those bits will be funny because I'll be on the

50:04.880 --> 50:08.680
outside I think was the thing to do would be to like actually think about

50:08.680 --> 50:13.920
this but thinking about it is a little it is a little uncomfortable it's like

50:13.920 --> 50:18.400
like I don't mean necessarily like stop I reject this let's not talk about it but

50:18.400 --> 50:23.920
I was like like gosh I mean what's your fear of like what somebody might say it

50:23.920 --> 50:30.960
like yellow jazzing you oh I don't I think the what I don't think I think if you

50:30.960 --> 50:34.440
can't come up with good stuff to say about me after I'm dead like I think I

50:34.440 --> 50:39.480
feel like I've heard the worst of it through Google Autofill like I don't

50:39.480 --> 50:44.160
I don't I don't think Google Autofill is gonna be at my funeral you know people

50:44.160 --> 50:51.320
will tweet that would be so good it's just like Dan Harmon Chevy Dan Harmon

50:51.320 --> 50:59.840
bad question and people are just crying I would like to think that that that if I

50:59.840 --> 51:05.760
can I can make it the ten years necessary that like that the only people at

51:05.760 --> 51:12.640
my my memorial would be just people that knew me you know like wouldn't it

51:12.640 --> 51:16.360
wouldn't be like a thing that people would comment on like I felt I felt pretty

51:16.360 --> 51:21.040
bad for as much as you can feel bad for a memory of someone I felt a little

51:21.040 --> 51:25.080
bad for Hugh Hefner I thought I thought it was a little awkward and sad that Hugh

51:25.080 --> 51:30.600
Hefner lived for so long that if Hugh Hefner had died at 70 instead of 90

51:30.600 --> 51:34.840
whatever he was that that he would have been like there would have been a 60

51:34.840 --> 51:37.760
minutes like peace or whatever and it's like it says nothing to do with whether

51:37.760 --> 51:43.200
or not it was right or wrong it's just like the timing of it felt so sad to me

51:43.200 --> 51:48.480
that we were so awakened and stuff that Hugh Hefner who we don't we don't know I

51:48.480 --> 51:53.200
mean all we know is that like Brian Wilson or you know let's put Michael

51:53.200 --> 51:57.000
Jackson in there like I don't know it's like that people who do terrible things

51:57.000 --> 52:04.440
people who do who who are so visible and so like are effective that then like I

52:04.440 --> 52:10.880
don't did you know it was like the context of him dying was it was like shit

52:10.880 --> 52:15.240
this is like like he really died at the exact wrong time are you saying that you

52:15.240 --> 52:19.920
might agree I might I might die early just to make I may like I'll be like

52:19.920 --> 52:24.960
sensing that the Dow Jones of die death value like this would be a perfect time

52:24.960 --> 52:31.160
to die are you worried that you that you might you might die under a shadow of

52:31.160 --> 52:37.200
no no no I I just what I'm saying is I don't think I think I'll be I'll be fine

52:37.200 --> 52:42.000
I don't think that I have to worry about what the world would say about a

52:42.000 --> 52:48.320
corpse like I will I think I could step outside and get hit by a bus but I

52:48.320 --> 52:55.560
believe I'll make it first what the first bus cross your dick in the day

52:55.560 --> 53:03.840
you're like what you're a grown man it's a like like I don't it's I'm pretty

53:03.840 --> 53:08.240
sure you're the reason why this topic is happening and like you just like because

53:08.240 --> 53:13.440
I'm you're like you know you're like a fucking kitten you know you like you ever

53:13.440 --> 53:17.040
have a kitten and then like you you could roll up a paper ball and throw it

53:17.040 --> 53:20.400
and the kitten will just spend 20 minutes being so freaked out by the

53:20.400 --> 53:24.000
fucking paper ball it's like we're running sideways it's so and you're like

53:24.000 --> 53:28.080
that's adorable the kitten thinks that the paper ball it needs to be attacked

53:28.080 --> 53:33.160
and stuff like this is you're like hey it's me I'm gonna fart in the mic and I

53:33.160 --> 53:37.760
didn't oh I'm flexible enough that I'm like oh that farting in the mic reminds

53:37.760 --> 53:42.200
me of death let's talk about death and then you're like blah blah blah what

53:42.200 --> 53:48.320
about me you haven't changed at all what a what were you trying to accomplish

53:48.320 --> 53:54.120
when you were moving that mic in such a way you were gonna fart in the mic well

53:54.120 --> 53:58.680
let's let's not let's not let's let him let's let him answer let's try I was

53:58.680 --> 54:04.880
adjusting the cushion with the mic with my hand and you want people to respect

54:04.880 --> 54:11.680
you and like you I bet those days are over with you know it'd be funny you

54:11.680 --> 54:18.040
guys if when you died you got a service a skydiving service to put your corpse

54:18.040 --> 54:23.000
in a parachute that has a time-lapse so it triggers itself so your corpse just

54:23.000 --> 54:27.320
kind of like skydives just somewhere and so people are like oh it's a skydiver

54:27.320 --> 54:33.680
oh wait he's coming into the city oh he's landing right here oh well he's not

54:33.680 --> 54:39.360
getting out from under his parachute oh is he okay we got to help him he's dead

54:39.360 --> 54:46.960
oh no he's dead what happened and it's fuckers this was my plan all along like

54:46.960 --> 54:51.640
in the into the Super Bowl like you would yeah it would be amazing it would be so

54:51.640 --> 54:57.440
good it would take so long to figure out if you could have a parachute

54:57.440 --> 55:02.360
canopy that like had like like like you're a corpse you're in the thing yeah

55:02.360 --> 55:06.600
and you're going down and it's the Super Bowl or it's there the you know the

55:06.600 --> 55:13.680
champions like like the soccer or the soccer or the football winners thingies

55:13.680 --> 55:19.600
then and but a big game and you just the big but you have like servos and shit

55:19.600 --> 55:25.360
the fly you at right dead guy lands right yeah yeah on the 50 yard line he's so

55:25.360 --> 55:31.080
good I guess but that's I mean I I guess I I suggested that and then I take it

55:31.080 --> 55:34.360
back like I think the parachute thing's amazing but then if you're like oh my

55:34.360 --> 55:40.080
final act is I want to I want to disrupt the like the Super Bowl like then it's

55:40.080 --> 55:44.800
like no wonder you're a corpse like anyway it wouldn't it wouldn't be it

55:44.800 --> 55:48.360
wouldn't be disrupting any but it would be it would be like oh you're hacking the

55:48.360 --> 55:54.920
Super Bowl you figure it out how to ruin one astronaut that jumped jumped off

55:54.920 --> 56:01.440
like a saddle and it was like an insane skydive didn't didn't you see that

56:01.440 --> 56:06.080
footage or whatever yeah he jumped from the other like the atmosphere skydive

56:06.080 --> 56:11.120
from yeah and it was a parachute like whatever here's what you do I like

56:11.120 --> 56:16.680
Spencer's idea he just didn't go high enough okay take the corpse up high okay

56:16.680 --> 56:22.400
super high throw it out of the ship right let it go down burns in the

56:22.400 --> 56:28.680
atmosphere you're a falling star people can wish on you somebody can make a

56:28.680 --> 56:36.720
wish on you but why did it have to be a call Elon you better call Elon and say

56:36.720 --> 56:44.280
hey I got some ideas Elon hey Elon hey don't rip off my idea that was my idea

56:44.280 --> 56:50.920
I'll sue you Elon if you steal my idea remember the time that Elon must have

56:50.920 --> 56:55.320
sent a super cool red convertible sports car in a space and then it turned out he

56:55.320 --> 56:59.240
was a douchebag remember that time talking about one of my best friends and

56:59.240 --> 57:03.920
I won't like I think I saw his car recently remember that time that I was

57:03.920 --> 57:08.960
driving my route in my very securitest route to get to get back home for the

57:08.960 --> 57:14.520
second time and my Tesla said raising suspension based on location because I

57:14.520 --> 57:18.920
was in a neighborhood with speed bumps and I was like I love you too Elon fucking

57:18.920 --> 57:26.000
amazing car the man can do no wrong what does he smell like apples the ultimate

57:26.000 --> 57:33.920
smell smells like a bushel of a South African apples just as a more American

57:33.920 --> 57:39.480
than the apples he seemed can I be I thought you said owls he seems like an

57:39.480 --> 57:45.960
unsupportable asshole like I well you you you you go you go you he's my best

57:45.960 --> 57:51.520
friend can I just say that I think the Internet's mean to him and that's not to

57:51.520 --> 57:55.880
absolve him of any of anything that anyone has against him but it's hard

57:55.880 --> 58:00.400
when you're a weird guy in the first place it's hard to be visible yeah it's

58:00.400 --> 58:04.160
calling that's that's again not to give him like too much credit or anything but

58:04.160 --> 58:08.320
I don't want to create the joke I don't think the internet is being hard and I

58:08.320 --> 58:12.120
think the stock market is being harder than because he keeps fucking I think we

58:12.120 --> 58:17.240
could really be you know be be driving a man off the cliff because it's fun on

58:17.240 --> 58:21.480
the internet right yeah you really want to support a system that's like oh you're

58:21.480 --> 58:29.040
the new like car magnet and you made a completely green car and like oh you got

58:29.040 --> 58:32.960
high with Joe Rogan like we should definitely like punish that until you

58:32.960 --> 58:38.920
kill yourself like I mean like I don't like look I he seems like a dish canoe

58:38.920 --> 58:46.800
until further notice until he does what he bench presses a nun like my first

58:46.800 --> 58:49.800
rhetorical question is what does he have to do to get anyone's approval and my

58:49.800 --> 58:54.400
second question is go fuck yourself play like who cares if he does that like I

58:54.400 --> 59:01.360
like I'm obviously biased I am I am I am in a healthy way very toxified about the

59:01.360 --> 59:06.240
the like I need to move into my Gandalf the white the extremely white

59:06.240 --> 59:12.360
privileged period where I'm like yeah I gotta get over my approval addiction so

59:12.360 --> 59:18.720
that's tainting my my view of everything but in a healthy way like I it makes me

59:18.720 --> 59:24.680
all the more like fucking rabidly like human rights like oriented because I'm

59:24.680 --> 59:28.200
like everyone should stop being fucking ashamed like everyone should stop

59:28.200 --> 59:31.440
shaming each other that includes everything that you think you're allowed

59:31.440 --> 59:37.320
to shame people for there shouldn't be any exceptions to that I'm tired of you

59:37.320 --> 59:41.880
know it's like I we've all been on a big roller coaster ride and for my money

59:41.880 --> 59:46.880
I've been like you know I started here and I fucking do but do and I kind of

59:46.880 --> 59:50.760
like you know when I think back to the beginning of the podcast when I was like

59:50.760 --> 59:55.760
this boner that like you know was like democracy doesn't matter and you shouldn't

59:55.760 --> 59:59.840
vote and all this stuff like I've changed in a lot of ways and I've changed back

59:59.840 --> 01:00:03.000
in a lot of ways like the one thing that's come around full circle is I'm

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.720
kind of like fuck everybody stop telling me to tie my shoes go fuck yourself like

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:11.960
I got to get out of here and and and I and I would never ever ever hurt a

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:17.440
person that that that wanted to just be who they were like I don't I don't want

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:22.040
anybody to feel pain you're still a boner Dan I know that's what I'm saying like

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:26.840
like if that's the new definition of boner I'm like good because like I spent

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:30.520
too much time in the deprivation tank of like thinking that that could be the

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:35.200
definition of a good person because it can't if you are kind of like across the

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:40.000
board in favor of everybody being happy sooner or later you're gonna fuck you

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.640
have to accept that that's gonna piss a good 70% of people off and if you're

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:49.760
not adult enough to handle 70% of people like being pissed at you then you

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:53.760
shouldn't be bandying about this concept of this that this supposed position you

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:58.080
have like like you got to nut up to pardon the expression because some

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:02.320
people need to that some people that don't have nuts or want nuts like you

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:05.640
guard nutting up and like like teaching me lessons and being like yeah you got

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:10.600
to fucking like it gets bad like you got to handle like like this idea that you

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:14.200
don't give a fuck what people think because that way you can have self-esteem

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:19.560
and you'll inspire people to go oh yeah etc right what do you think percentage

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:24.440
wise is here like you're you're you're Q rating your global Q right now there's

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.880
20 people out in the audience here they were willing to pay ten dollars on a

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:35.600
Monday night and I think that's that's a metric I'll use like like 20 out of like

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:41.120
8 billion yeah I don't say I mean I was like I'm incredibly biased but I think

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:50.960
like in 2018 I think that fame is a really really like it's it's a dangerous

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:56.360
thing I think that if you have no money and you can become famous like that's a

01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:04.280
smart parkour move you could like jump from from zero fame and zero money up

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:08.240
to fame and zero money and then with the right twisting and the right

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:15.680
circumstances you could leap from fame and no money to some money and then my

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:20.760
advice is grab that money hang on to that and don't fucking use too much fame

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:27.400
as your parkour point because visibility means you're you're like hanging out

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:31.800
there and it's fun right now I'm not I'm trying I'm not I'm not I don't want to be

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:37.320
like like Aaron Sorkin and you know like my predecessors and be like this

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:42.000
internet the fuck you I'm saying as a 45 year old dude like spent like 30 years

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.960
being like hey look at me look at me look at me and I want to spend my life

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:49.200
online and I want everybody to know what's going on with me and no no no harm

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.240
can come of that if I just commit to that and all this stuff I'm just saying

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:57.720
like like we've arrived at a world where like there's so much fame to go around

01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:03.480
and it's it's so like it's like kind of like helium or some gas that just sort of

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:07.520
like you could become you can be famous for 30 minutes you can be famous for

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:11.760
20 years you can be you can be this famous that famous it's just like like

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:16.440
it but it all has one thing in common which is that it's like it's like it's

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:23.600
like the ratio of safety that it provides to risk that it creates has gone

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:29.160
way into if I was your broker and I was like don't buy fame like sell sell

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:35.940
because it'll make you it could destroy you more than it could help is there a

01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:40.800
ratio for you that like that like if you could achieve a certain amount of wealth

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:50.160
that you could retire on divided by or multiplied by the love of strangers like

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:54.560
like how important is it's not fame for you I don't I don't think you ever wanted

01:03:54.560 --> 01:04:00.080
fame no I didn't want fame because I was like I I did I was like I was like

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:04.280
there's no question about it that like I'm not I'm not a victim of anything like

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:10.800
I absolutely engineered every day of my life I was like how can I be visible how

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:16.400
can I make people know my name like I branded myself I am every bit responsible

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:21.720
for like every fucking ounce I put nothing but energy into the idea of

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:27.000
people knowing who I am knowing what I am I I will even go so far as to say like

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.280
I even like added in these elements of like oh he's drunk and he's cantankerous

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:35.960
and he's like oh he's a torture genius and like I I wish that I could have

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:43.000
controlled it every fucking micro bit of it but it's all ingredients that I aimed

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.760
at a cauldron and set at a temperature that I was like called fame or called

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:55.440
called called attention or obsolescence insurance called called you can't if I'm

01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:00.840
if I'm a showrunner on an NBC sitcom you can't fire me quietly called like you

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:05.760
can't like you I'm Colonel Sanders so whether you like me or not my head's on

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:14.560
a bucket and like like and like like that's called tenure that's as close as

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:21.680
we get it's it's like oh you can't just here's something Colonel Sanders wasn't

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:29.560
a Colonel yeah and I'm not the whatever the fuck we thought I was I am a guy

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:35.200
that was like hey look at me which is which is anybody that's like into me is

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:39.240
like yeah that's why I like you you're not you've never pretended to be higher

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:43.120
than us but when you when you said that you wanted you want your name to be

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:47.720
indelible and like you want to be everlasting like in that way like no

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:50.680
matter whether they liked you or not you're not for legacy just for tenure

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:55.400
for job security but so it's job security but it's like like dick wolf

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:59.360
like where's dick wolf dick wolf is here tonight we don't know oh yeah we should

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:04.080
we did dick wolf we don't is he alive is he dead is he in a admiral pike like

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:08.400
thing like dick wolf like he's got 900 TV shows his name's dick wolf like you can

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:14.200
like Tom Clancy yeah Tom stand up Tom Clancy like like what is that what you

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:18.880
want yes yes yes you want to be and could I also have a different name other

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:23.600
than the thing like can I can I so that I can stop when I when I get on Google can

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:28.280
I stop being reminded that is it important to you and these are questions

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:31.360
that I probably maybe knows the answer because I've known you for a long time

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:35.400
maybe not maybe maybe we never talk about it is it important to you that to

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:39.120
walk in the street and feel love or just attempt or our tension I think that

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:42.640
might have been important to me at 32 I that no it's not it's not important

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:47.520
anymore I've gotten I've I've gotten so much of that drink like I love it like

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:51.240
it's so good it was so nourishing when you when you talk about now because you

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:54.600
keep repeating that fact the idea that you want to retire and go away and

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:59.440
disappear do you think that you've achieved what you wanted out of that yes

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:06.440
because because you can't be 70 and be like check the dailies did how did I do

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:11.320
today that's not what we want from a 70 I don't see any version of you that when

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:17.640
you're 70 that's not gonna still want oh I have more faith in me I mean I I don't

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:21.080
think you should see a version of me but I do in my therapist office and what I

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:26.080
looked at was so amazing about watching you talk to Norman Lear who was maybe

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:30.920
for me the most intimidating guest we ever had in the show because he was well

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:40.200
into his 80s and he was fit and spry and groovy and showed no signs of wanting

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:43.640
to not keep making television and stuff like that like he was just one of those

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:48.640
guys but like you you're saying I would like to just like retire now but I can't

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:54.160
see no but I retire from the from the part from the visibility thing retire

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:58.840
from the public from the what does that mean now how can you well I don't know

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:04.640
how can you I mean like stop doing your podcast stop stop doing like you know

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:11.280
it's like I don't do interviews I don't want you know like yeah and you said you

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:16.920
did you use you know like me used about talking like like not doing Highland

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:19.920
Town anymore which is fine with me there I can't believe it's gone on this long

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:26.040
but yeah it's been a good run but if you stop doing it like what would you miss

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:32.800
a fallout for yeah I would I'd play and I say this with like with like with love

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:36.960
and and with all due respect like I don't know a version of you that doesn't

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:42.840
want to walk out on stage and find out that 63 strangers are happy to see you

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:49.040
I'm sure I'm sure I would miss it but it's also like it's not unachievable like

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:53.480
when you stop doing it once a week is a regular thing that you you know how it's

01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:57.600
it's you could it's Los Angeles I guess if it's still worth anything and you

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:04.280
really missed it you can always go like I'm gonna do I'm gonna stand on stage

01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:14.480
next Wednesday and answer questions about writing please don't ask can I have a

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:22.320
job I won't be able to give you one I fucked your mama so hard I fucked her to

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:28.360

I forget the other directions oh look there's Rob

01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:39.920
oh he's burning up in the with his with his jetpack now wait let me ask you a

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:44.400
question about that the guy that did that he didn't burn up in the atmosphere

01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:52.360
you don't think like he his live stopped him from burning like you're saying

01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:56.880
just like yeah okay so I don't know you're saying go to that altitude jump

01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:01.480
my corpse out and it'll burn it'll burn up yeah yeah yeah but you want to be

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:04.240
unconscious for that part because that sounds like a nightmare oh yeah I don't

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:10.600
think this is a method of euthanization I think you're already dead wait a minute

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:17.980
wait best suicide ever best way around an insurance policy you're like I'm an

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:21.080
astronaut like no one's more alive than me and they're like all right we're gonna

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:24.880
cover you but you bet this better not be a suicide no I'm just visiting the

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:34.240
atmosphere I'm gonna colonize atmosphere why is your space it looked like Batman

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:41.280
why does it have rice paper and fire crackers on it what why do you have

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:53.200
5,000 GoPros around you why did your corpse explode into happy New Year YOLO

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:58.040
fucking like I support the trans community they like why were there's all

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:02.080
this like five messages like I just thought that would be a fun way to come

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:07.400
back home it'd be a lot of inside jokes that we did you know listen to my

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:11.440
podcast so what were you gonna say sorry kid you get derailed no no no I was

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:15.480
trying I was trying to interject and I was interrupting okay well I was like

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:20.120
saying let's beat out like like how like I was going well this isn't gonna be

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:24.280
very is gonna be expensive because like there's just be shut because people are

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:30.640
dying every second sorry kids that there's just be hauling like payloads of

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:35.680
corpses up and throwing them at the earth oh yeah we're not suggest well what

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:40.320
I'm suggesting that everyone do this maybe it would be easier is if we shot

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:45.480
them up in a cannon right and then they fell down but they so we would have to

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:50.320
really pay so just be shooting dead people up into the sky to fall down and

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:57.560
then you could control it like okay friends and family do your funeral

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:03.240
service we've got it locked and we're aiming for right Portland right like you

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:08.160
should more you pay the more more precise the aiming gets right if you're a

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:12.480
death row inmate we're just like I don't know we shot them up what about if a

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:16.640
government that like like ours like in like several countries that can afford

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:21.920
a space program if your government approval rating goes under like 30%

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:26.400
everybody gets shot up into space and we all get to watch them and then the

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:30.840
night sky just to send like like like meteorites we have a regular purge of

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:36.960
Congress like we set we send them up every two years we send all of the

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:43.080
government up to a summit where we're like good luck better come back down

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:47.600
with a functional budget yes we'd love to bring you back down we'd love to be

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:56.360
able to afford to bring you back down alive time to earn that fucking lifestyle

01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:00.080
or you're like get to wear your little outfits and like be a lawmaker and you

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:04.520
don't get parking tickets and they all go up like okay and they radio down to us

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:10.200
we're working on it yeah not good enough midnight's coming yeah and then I'm

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:14.120
like oh here we go they put it and everyone like it's a win-win for the

01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:19.280
people because you're just like look look it's a new beginning it's raining

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:27.560
sparkle people hallelujah I mean they were probably all 85 like otherwise how

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:30.840
did they end up lawmakers right so they're like just like it's like oh my

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:34.440
god they lived longer than the poor poor people that they are legislating you know

01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:38.800
like they were just like oh they sparkly now they would want to live it's like a

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:42.800
Logan's run but like healthy you know it's not like you get killed at 30 you

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:47.840
know it's like 85 and your your atoms get scattered into the universe and you

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:53.280
you know like the iron in your blood like like or the amino acids might like

01:13:53.280 --> 01:14:00.320
start a new civilization somewhere yeah oh oh or they get or they get totally

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:08.880
disintegrated space works I want to believe what you're pitching here if I

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:12.920
go up to a space station and they just drop me out of the space it's possible

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:17.560
my I'll start a new well I mean species I mean the atoms in your body won't

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:22.480
disappear the law of conservation of energy and stuff like you'll still

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:27.760
those atoms and things will still exist and be dispersed somewhere yeah we will

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:31.080
that goes for us too you know you don't have to die in space yeah but it's more

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:34.840
fun because it might go somewhere cool but that's the part where again you're

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:40.720
getting out here you're like I feel like you're mixing this like we all breathe

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:44.280
Julius Caesar every four breaths or whatever you know that stuff where it's

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:49.480
like oh every every every breath every breath has like one atom of Julius

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:52.480
Caesar in it or whatever and you're mixing that with this idea of putting

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:56.640
the senators they're all gonna fall back to earth and they're just dying there's

01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:00.960
gonna be like they're gonna become a rock in Florida that will be ignominious I

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:05.400
just think we should take people that actually want to be they're like I got

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:09.880
an idea what if I told everybody what to do hey I think that's a great idea I

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:14.080
think here's the rules and we should like make them brutal you know speaking

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:17.680
of rules why don't we play some D&D for once in a while you want to play some

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:55.360
LinkedIn for you oh man okay so no you guys left the town you got reassigned

01:19:55.360 --> 01:20:00.400
you were reassigned from the town you were looking for patches just on your

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:07.340
own time and you got reassigned you got sent on your way to this new place where

01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:11.880
shit was going down it was a mining town and the mining town was like going on

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:16.880
strike you were there to like investigate clear up the log jams you

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:23.840
know as you are want to do and on your way there was demons oh boy well I guess

01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:29.200
it was there was cults you found a cult you found a different cult you help the

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:35.280
different cults summon a demon the demon was summoned and you continued to help

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:41.240
some of the demon and then you kind of find at the demon a little bit in effect

01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:48.400
Julie the demon was strong maybe even very incredibly strong but that's the

01:20:48.400 --> 01:21:02.040
situation you found yourself to wait didn't leave it makes you think like what

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:06.880
if the reason the world is the way it is right now is because God is dungeon

01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:14.920
master and he's given up and he's just like you guys are in a cave tell me what

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:21.000
you want to tell you we want to sneak and he's like yeah to what's your agility

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:45.280

01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:50.680
can never do anything right fuck off take this and this and you keep these

01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:57.640
stupid things goodbye stay stay stay oh my god I love that he's pretending his

01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:07.720
character is leaving stay my character is saying stay my character wants your

01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:23.320
character to not leave stay please stay I want my my character is nicer I do

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:33.680
what's the what's necessary what's your courage to make him stay 16 which pretty

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:37.720
accurate it's not bad it's not really a metaphor it's like that's exactly my

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:43.640
charisma but I'm a plant person right but I'm an inclusive supposed to talk to

01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:50.680
plants I'm I can talk to anybody stay I'm with the church of the silver flame

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:55.480
stay what are you doing isn't there a demon about to kill us yeah

01:22:55.480 --> 01:23:04.560
can we oh my god I I try to focus on the the the inherent peril going on right

01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:08.360
now and I examine the surroundings what's going on around so I don't know

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:12.720
what Steve was doing last but Schrab walking away and leaving the circle is

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:16.680
like making the circle which has been distorted and messed up kind of tighten

01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:20.920
more around the demon he's kind of half in and half out of it so it's kind of

01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:25.520
holding him fast and he's like oh no this is bad but being like a 25 foot tall

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:29.640
demon he can still lash out and attack and stuff so it's not a solved problem

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:35.520
wait so him walking away Garry Shandling walking away that's making it harder for

01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:40.520
the demon like yeah because Steven Robb helped summon the demon they were one

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:44.360
of like about the seven to eight people that stood in the summoning circle to

01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:49.120
summon the demon so when they left their places it had an effect on the ritual is

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:55.320
what you're gleaning hey Gary and diarrhea junior walk away from each other

01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:59.120
and it'll it'll make it harder for the demon to move well that's happened at

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:05.040
this point that has occurred all right I walk you guys think our alcoholism is

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:08.320
your sandbox that's what you just think you could just do whatever you want

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:13.800
during my blackouts well you can't I mean you can but then I will during the

01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:18.520
next blackout hear about it and then I'll be like what the fuck do we know

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:24.880
about how many HP the the demon has right now it looks like it has all of it

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:30.280
all of it what how much of its body is through the circle about half but like a

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:37.320
diagonal half but mostly the upper all right whoa I'm walking away yeah that

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:41.440
was a mistake you didn't help summon the demons so I wasn't helping anyway so it

01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:45.760
doesn't change it but you are you're farther away from it which is good because

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:52.840
it's it has a long reach you know yeah are we in combat like churn mode right

01:24:52.840 --> 01:25:00.960
now technically technically we always are I mean whose turn is it how about

01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:20.640
it's yours his name is Cornelius he's a he's a fire ant he he's I'm a fire

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:23.720
elemental kind of fair I'm a chick you're supposed to I'm Chad the fire

01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:30.880
he's a fiery ant and and he has some of my fire elemental power well let's have

01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:36.200
a shower for him then let's find out if you summon why are you why are you

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:41.800
shaming my I'm saying like it's not healthy like wait to see oh no you can

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:47.000
summon it's fine yeah Cornelius you were doubting my ability

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:53.400
nature's alley fire ants don't use real fire yeah but but because I'm a far because

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:58.600
I'm a fire liker he he's a fire ants right yeah he's a he's a real pain in

01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:04.720
the butt the also like spicy food he loves yeah he he loves

01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:17.880
far he's some people karma a fur and let's do it okay so hello Cornelius attack

01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:25.840
all right it goes it rushes it's in a rage yeah oh boy if I know Cornelius

01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:32.000
he's fucking in a full-on range Cornelius don't fucking play being summoned

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:38.440
from another plane it makes them all crazy and such there's just a plane of

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:43.880
ants there's a whole yeah there's a plane for every monster it's really fucked

01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:47.760
up these planes on these planes are they like the dominant life form are these

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:51.320
planes like functional like the material plane or they just planes where

01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:55.760
there's like ghost ants like like I always imagine it just being like

01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:00.240
swirling monsters in space but it probably is something more I would have

01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:10.080
summoned the snake from a plane but it's not they were busy all right the the

01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:13.800
ant bites him it doesn't seem like it hurts very bad it bites him for 3d

01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:18.560
damage 3 is fucking better than no it's it does look like it's better than no

01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:27.560
damage by a thin margin Cornelius relocate he really he makes as to

01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:33.040
relocate because Cornelius is a rogue ant and he likes to do sneak attacks

01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:40.880
this guy good well he's like I go to college I use but pretend pretend to be

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:46.120
a cop so that my role as a kingpin can be bolstered I use my turn I summoned an

01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:50.160
ant did 3 damage what have you done for me yeah I can't do anything you can you

01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:55.000
get the departed rolling out here you've got like 90 moves like happening let's

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:03.880
that was my joke you should go I would like to wait wait what I'd like to wait

01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:08.240
wait wait wait for what for your awesome jokes to land and hurting my

01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:12.200
feelings now hurting your feeling why do you you're you're a fucking macho guy

01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:18.600
with attack today well I don't the demon I think was a mistake I'm stepping back

01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:24.800
and I'm I'm like we shouldn't have done this I don't remember doing it yeah you

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:29.360
didn't actually you didn't you they did it but I'll be frank and say I don't

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:33.800
remember not doing it sure so we should I should cop to my but you're saying that

01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:37.680
that you're wasting a turn on not doing anything well I want to be a

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:41.480
participant and go like look while this is happening oh everything I can to make

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:46.400
sure you're saying I pass okay I got you yeah I think it would be helpful if

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:50.880
during this yeah it'd be helpful if the toughest guy in our group didn't do shit

01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:56.960
during during this fight I think Rob's the toughest guy I thought you were I mean

01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:02.840
Rob has the most you wait a shambling mounds are toughest guy well he's

01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:15.160
stat is a monster I didn't hey Spencer hey guys

01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:24.600
can I I'm gonna take my elvish blade and I'm going to run in a circle around

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:30.320
with where the cultists are and just again like slice all the cultists as I

01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:35.680
run in a circle all right well you can only attack one at a time what to okay

01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:44.040
let's do it we're doing it I just feel like we're we do everything wrong what

01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:49.560
are we doing I'm just trying to be proactive I can't just sit around wait

01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:54.240
also I partially caused this problem you summoned a demon and now it's our job

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:58.880
to kill this demon I would I would suppose you chopped the leg off one of

01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:05.360
the cultists hell yeah yeah there's six more but that one he's on the ground

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:10.160
bleeding what if what are the real what are the other cultists doing they're

01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:14.720
hanging out it's there they're existing within the five seconds most of this

01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:22.280
action is taking place within ish does it help when we chop down cultists it

01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:28.080
certainly helps you should ask that before you that always the order should

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:34.960
be you're describing a conscience you ask that question then then then you

01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:41.640
chop them I did dismember this leg but was it good well is it is it is the is

01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:48.000
the gateway closing no at this point the gateway looks as closed as it can get

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:54.960

go find that weird brony kid that like is obsessed with horses and and it's

01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:10.560
ironically the one that keeps getting us in huge amounts of trouble just random

01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:16.800
fucking DJ like DJ get over here we're all talking shit about the church of

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:20.520
silver flame and I mean we believe in a silver flame but the religious part of

01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:31.160
it is kind of getting us down what am I there Spence well okay so you're you're

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:36.840
fighting the demon right I guess yeah well like you witness a cavalry arrive

01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:41.440
and it's it's you know them as the fourth cavalry of the church militant

01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:47.080
it's a faction of the the members of the church who saved people from evil

01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:52.480
demons and they actually just kind of make quick work of the cult and the

01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:57.000
demons because they're highly trained this is exactly what they do and then

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.160
they just kind of high five you and they give you stuff and then they send you on

01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:05.960
your way so they're like then you catch then you catch back up so they're like

01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:14.840
silver-flamed swat hey Gary play play a cool you know time and a place let's

01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:22.080
change let's change the Nazis from the inside let's make an agreement okay can

01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:25.560
we all I wasn't supposed to be leading either that was just what was gonna

01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:29.400
happen oh yeah we trust you not to create weird

01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:33.120
princes in the pee situations that guide us but can we all kind of a lot of

01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:36.960
can the four of us get together and have a little huddle DJ we came up with a

01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:40.520
new handshake go quit what's the new handshake with your thumbs down and you

01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:45.720
make a fart noise that's in and of itself

01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:50.160
till all our wall handshake

01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:58.400
well DJ's back there good journey no we're all together all together now we're

01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:02.960
all DJ that all happened in the past while you guys were were hashing it out

01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:09.120
with with with Rob and then then he just caught up to damage what we all agree

01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:13.760
right now that we're all together now but it's for us it's not for the it's

01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:17.680
not for the church it's for what we believe in yeah and I know that that's

01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:22.480
it's a less powerful conviction given that really it's not the church's fault

01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:28.280
that we're constantly drunk and forgetting everything we did but I do

01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:33.080
think it's like you can do the right things for the wrong reasons like I

01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:37.880
think that we we were doing the wrong things for the right reasons we will

01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:40.880
we've been trying to be good soldiers and like for the church and stuff and

01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:45.360
it's not a job we're cut out for no I feel like this is my hope and maybe this

01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:50.960
is unhealthy thinking if we start doing adventures that that are based on our

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:58.240
own agenda that we might remember him better and we won't fuck him up hey uh hey

01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:05.240
Cornelius he disappeared like a minute ago he can't summon an aunt that'll then

01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:11.240
just hang out sorry I don't mean to I I've never summoned in that before and I

01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:16.120
look am I a bad person no it's sad that you thought it was like a teddy bear

01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:21.120
I think it's not it's a crime you would gladly watch dive is he alive is he dead it's a

01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:24.360
soldier that you would have watched fight for you and he killed you and then

01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:29.920
you're like hey can I ask you a question like it's Jen Hirsch on taxi it's like

01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:39.200
well pick a lane I summon a person whose opinion I value to fight a troll well

01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:44.440
if we're relinquishing our allegiance to the church keep your voice down should

01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:49.320
we should we call the new group name like like horse friends or super squad or

01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:54.280
something here's my vote I don't think the church gives that much of a fuck

01:41:54.280 --> 01:42:00.000
about us they have no reason to care I don't think we need to say to them hey

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:07.200
I will declare my independence they'll stamp us out like but what we can do is

01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:12.400
decide that we're not we're not working for them anymore the silver flame didn't

01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:17.520
say make this church and have this church be in charge of me the silver flame

01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:23.960
is a real thing does it actually talk yeah I believe it does it I believe in

01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:26.980
the myth of the silver flame and I'm using the word myth in the cambillian

01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:31.480
phrase and Campbell is the thing I'll tell you about later or but but like it's

01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:36.960
I believe the story I believe the silver flame is real like I you can well while

01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:41.520
Carlos is talking because I think this is gonna go somewhere pretty big and

01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:46.800
important for yeah for where we're headed do I have it a second level spell

01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:58.720
in me so sure I cast Al's wisdom which gives you who's Al Al from happy it gives

01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:12.400
you a plus four on wisdom right now yeah that could be good yeah so yeah I do not

01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:19.760
pollute like that's a reference to okay so I then I continue babbling and I it

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:25.000
sounds wiser yeah way wise like I'm saying like look it doesn't I mean if

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.520
this the silver flame is real the allegiance with the church like I

01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:35.920
don't know man like I think they sent us out here on what we call a fuck run

01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:42.200
fucking out Al's wisdom making it up working right man there's no such phrase

01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:59.240
but but well you didn't cast no articulation I'm saying it's working

01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:05.000
you like we were in a fucking fuck run yeah the truth is the reason why I

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:12.180
joined the church was was personal and I like it had to do with the purific

01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:16.480
ation and that the silver flame represents the idea that there is an

01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:20.880
empirical difference between good and bad and that and pure and impure and that

01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:27.000
it's not it's not based on like people's subjective opinions that there is a

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:33.520
truth out there an ideal that we should strive for and God bless the church but

01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:37.720
like I don't I don't think you can organize something to that to the level

01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:43.080
that our church has organized us and and and and be without corruption of that

01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:46.840
thing and I'm not even saying that's why we should quit it I'm saying actually

01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:53.040
honestly I'm an alcoholic and like I'm a I'm a bad cleric like they got they had

01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:58.000
me in the library and like they strategically like designed it so that

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.920
it was a certain distance from the break room they knew they knew about my drink

01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:05.120
so what's your what do you what's your pitch I'm saying they let me out they

01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:09.840
sent me on an adventure they knew I was gonna get drunk and they didn't care so

01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:14.400
that means they didn't care if we lived or died I'm saying to you guys as a

01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:18.880
person with a Swiss cheese brain who can't I can't I'm from one moment to

01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:24.440
the next I can't remember what we were doing like it's a bad like I think we

01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:30.000
should we should be renegades it would suit us better so we shouldn't go to the

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:39.000
mining town well we should have the mining town come to us I guess there's

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.960
really nothing we can accomplish if we continue to not be able to remember what

01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:51.320
we did from one moment to the next that's a good point whoa maybe we should

01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:57.000
try to be oh it's a sunflower I left the coal oh I'm just

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:08.280
sorry no I don't exist all right okay must be nice sorry there was a spiritual

01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:13.720
track what you're saying is simplify simplify and and and maybe play once a

01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:19.280
week I did I well yeah if maybe if we I don't know man I'm yeah I don't know I

01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:28.000
mean I know that I'm worried here's I'm worried that I don't remember that we

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:31.880
summoned a demon like I felt like that was like a warning sign like when you

01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:35.560
wake up and you're like like oh it was summoned a demon and the like like I

01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:42.440
don't know when we did like I honestly I also as look you guys know that I'm a

01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:47.080
gnome druid and you also know that I have improv gigs that come up once in a

01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:52.720
while so I look I can't I can't always be here to cast Al's wisdom on people and

01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:59.880
seven ants like I said sometimes I have to go do like sing dick jokes like in

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:03.480
Rochester New York do you guys remember Barony Mack whatever happened to that

01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:10.200
guy he's not here don't don't remember him don't didn't remember he was a gnome

01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:15.520
don't remember he had tour dates don't remember a lot what happened to whatever

try to steal our potatoes look how long we spent getting passions gem what was

01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:12.360
passions response you know you guys are gross you know he's gone you know what

01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:18.640
the first thing we need to do is we get like like a painter to paint our portrait

01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:25.320
and and put out calendars of our potato farm business that's the first thing we

01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:32.800
should do I know a guy who paints really good likenesses and we'll just get like

01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:38.080

after it okay yeah I fucking I love this look look it's it's it's it's I never

01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:50.680

01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:55.080
and growing a potato and having something to eat at the end of the day we're

01:49:55.080 --> 01:50:00.280

thing wrong. We could come up with the name later. Tater skins. Tater skins. Tater skins.

01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:06.820
Don't hate the tater. Don't hate the tater. Hate the field. Don't hate the tater till the...

01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:18.660
We don't need to come up with a name that's not the thing that makes a potato feel. We don't have the

01:55:18.660 --> 01:55:31.980
calendar. We're not capitalists. We don't even know if we're... First we have to walk away. We're walking.

01:55:31.980 --> 01:55:39.980
Then we have to plant potatoes. How much gold do we all have? How much gold do we all have?

01:55:39.980 --> 01:55:52.460
I can't do the harmony of stuff. Ten gold pieces. If that's not a sign that we should have been

01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:59.940
potato farmers by now, I think I have five. How long have we been doing this?

01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:11.700
Gold pieces. I have 2,000 silver pieces. We're not spud boys. Who made you

01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:29.060
God? Hash brown tag. Odd venture gratin. No. Look, you know what? I didn't fuck. No. You know what? I don't care.

01:56:29.060 --> 01:56:41.940
Potatoes all day. Potatoes all day. That's more like Google-y like millennial. Yeah, just go lateral.

01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:48.780
Potatoes all day. Or call it bad potatoes. That would be millennial. Bad potatoes. People would be

01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:50.340
be like, what bad potatoes?

01:56:50.340 --> 01:56:51.180
Potato sluts.

01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:53.380
And they'd be like, you're talking about it.

01:56:53.380 --> 01:56:54.020
What?

01:56:54.020 --> 01:56:54.860
Potato sluts.

01:56:54.860 --> 01:56:55.700
Potato sluts.

01:56:55.700 --> 01:56:56.900
Potato sluts.

01:56:56.900 --> 01:56:57.900
Potato sluts.

01:56:57.900 --> 01:56:58.900
Potato sluts.

01:56:58.900 --> 01:57:00.180
Potato sluts.

01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:00.940
OK.

01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:02.100
It challenges people.

01:57:02.100 --> 01:57:03.380
Potato sluts.

01:57:03.380 --> 01:57:04.860
It's like, yeah, we're sex positive.

01:57:04.860 --> 01:57:07.180
There's going to be lines in front of our potatoes,

01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:08.740
and people are going to be taking pictures of us

01:57:08.740 --> 01:57:09.300
for no reason.

01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:11.220
If Jezebel comes and wants to do an article,

01:57:11.220 --> 01:57:13.580
we're like, obviously, we're not slut-shaming anybody.

01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:15.020
We're a potato slut.

01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:17.380
We're such sluts about potatoes.

01:57:17.380 --> 01:57:19.620
We want you to be a potato slut.

01:57:19.620 --> 01:57:21.300
We think you should be a potato slut.

01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:23.860
We're taking the word back, and they'll be like, yeah,

01:57:23.860 --> 01:57:25.740
and we'll be like, yeah, have some potatoes.

01:57:25.740 --> 01:57:28.500
And they'll be like, these are good.

01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:29.580
You know, we'll be fine.

01:57:29.580 --> 01:57:30.460
Yeah, you're soaking it in.

01:57:30.460 --> 01:57:31.660
I think we'll make it.

01:57:31.660 --> 01:57:32.660
Spud slut.

01:57:32.660 --> 01:57:33.660
Spud slut.

01:57:33.660 --> 01:57:34.660
Spud slut.

01:57:34.660 --> 01:57:36.140
Potato slut.

01:57:36.140 --> 01:57:37.140
Potatoes maybe?

01:57:37.140 --> 01:57:38.140
Potatoes maybe?

01:57:38.140 --> 01:57:44.140
I don't get where we're going.

01:57:44.140 --> 01:57:45.420
I don't get potatoes maybe.

01:57:45.420 --> 01:57:50.100
Our genuinely organic millennial pitches for potatoes maybe

01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:54.020
is truly like, if you'd be like, hey, have you had potatoes

01:57:54.020 --> 01:57:56.300
maybe, you'd be like, no.

01:57:56.300 --> 01:57:57.860
And you'd already be like, I'm sure.

01:57:57.860 --> 01:58:00.180
I want to hear the best potatoes.

01:58:00.180 --> 01:58:03.420
I like potatoes maybe.

01:58:03.420 --> 01:58:06.980
Also, if we call ourselves potatoes maybe,

01:58:06.980 --> 01:58:10.340
then the moment we stop wanting to be potato farmers,

01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:11.980
it was like, we're potatoes maybe.

01:58:11.980 --> 01:58:13.180
Right, we get out clean.

01:58:13.180 --> 01:58:13.980
Yeah, exactly.

01:58:13.980 --> 01:58:15.980
But same with potato slut, I mean, that's the thing.

01:58:15.980 --> 01:58:17.580
Like, hey, we don't fucking care.

01:58:17.580 --> 01:58:18.140
You know what?

01:58:18.140 --> 01:58:19.460
Look, Colonel Sanders cared.

01:58:19.460 --> 01:58:21.020
Like, don't fucking trust us.

01:58:21.020 --> 01:58:22.540
We're just here to fucking help you out.

01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:23.340
It's your internet.

01:58:26.700 --> 01:58:27.780
You know, like, hey, we're here.

01:58:27.780 --> 01:58:29.500
Oh, shit, a purple worm.

01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:31.020
Oh, what?

01:58:31.020 --> 01:58:32.020
You can't do that.

01:58:32.020 --> 01:58:33.140
That's a monster.

01:58:33.140 --> 01:58:36.460
All right, look, I think what I'm convinced of

01:58:36.460 --> 01:58:38.180
is we're going to come up with a great name.

01:58:38.180 --> 01:58:38.700
Right.

01:58:38.700 --> 01:58:39.660
I think it's great.

01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:44.340
I think that I want to be an agriculture.

01:58:44.340 --> 01:58:46.540
What are the chances that we could just

01:58:46.540 --> 01:58:51.460
make a peaceful existence and demons didn't attack us?

01:58:51.460 --> 01:58:56.180
There was no awful things on the horizon at all times.

01:58:56.180 --> 01:58:57.300
How amazing would that be?

01:58:57.300 --> 01:58:59.940
Yeah, our only.

01:58:59.940 --> 01:59:00.980
I think it's possible.

01:59:00.980 --> 01:59:02.340
You know, when we're walking down the road,

01:59:02.340 --> 01:59:03.660
look at all these people we're passing.

01:59:03.660 --> 01:59:06.100
They're wearing rags and they're going like this.

01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:07.820
Like, you think they're doing it on a loop

01:59:07.820 --> 01:59:09.300
because they're there for background.

01:59:09.300 --> 01:59:11.940
Those are people.

01:59:11.940 --> 01:59:14.340
Just because they don't have a quest marker above their head

01:59:14.340 --> 01:59:16.740
doesn't mean that they're not living, breathing people.

01:59:16.740 --> 01:59:19.380
They're like, they're hoeing potatoes and shit.

01:59:19.380 --> 01:59:21.140
Let's try to be one of them.

01:59:21.140 --> 01:59:22.620
Maybe.

01:59:22.620 --> 01:59:24.540
Cliff Hanger.

01:59:24.540 --> 01:59:27.260
Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.

01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:28.260
Will they make potatoes?

01:59:31.460 --> 01:59:34.460
Will they still have to save the world from evil?

01:59:34.460 --> 01:59:40.260
Let's give it up for Steve Levy, everybody.

01:59:40.260 --> 01:59:41.700
The one and only Rob Schrab.

01:59:44.540 --> 01:59:49.420

Thank you, Chris, for coming.

02:00:02.140 --> 02:00:03.500
Drive fast, take chances, everybody.

Have a good one, Steve.

02:00:20.500 --> 02:00:22.500
Did you get any of that?

02:00:22.500 --> 02:00:34.500
It's a good show.
