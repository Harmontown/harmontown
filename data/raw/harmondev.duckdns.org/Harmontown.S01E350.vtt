{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:27.500\nWhat if I told you there was nothing to be scared of?\n\n00:27.500 --> 00:37.500\nI'm going to show you what I'm going to show you.\n\n00:37.500 --> 00:47.500\nI'm going to show you what I'm going to show you.\n\n00:47.500 --> 01:15.500\nI'm going to show you what I'm going to show you.\n\n01:15.500 --> 01:25.500\nI'm going to show you what I'm going to show you.\n\n01:25.500 --> 01:35.500\nI'm going to show you what I'm going to show you.\n\n01:35.500 --> 01:55.500\nI'm going to show you what I'm going to show you.\n\n01:55.500 --> 02:15.500\nI'm going to show you what I'm going to show you.\n\n02:15.500 --> 02:35.500\nI'm going to show you what I'm going to show you.\n\n02:35.500 --> 03:03.500\nI'm going to show you what I'm going to show you.\n\n03:03.500 --> 03:11.500\nWe have this culture in TV, no matter how modern and progressive we get,\n\n03:11.500 --> 03:21.500\nno matter how sensitive and gentle we become, underneath it all, all of the men and women.\n\n03:21.500 --> 03:25.500\nI think we pride ourselves on an almost militaristic mindset.\n\n03:25.500 --> 03:35.500\nWe're doing something so important here that requires so much discipline and hierarchy and collaboration and intuitiveness.\n\n03:35.500 --> 03:45.500\nIt simultaneously dehumanizes the people you work with while making them the most important people in the world.\n\n03:45.500 --> 03:59.500\nI don't know if it's just my narcissism or if this is a common thing that people experience with grief,\n\n03:59.500 --> 04:05.500\nbut I just hear that someone is gone and then I'm immediately parsing it.\n\n04:05.500 --> 04:09.500\nWhat is wrong with me? What's wrong with me?\n\n04:09.500 --> 04:13.500\nWhat have I done? Why am I like this?\n\n04:13.500 --> 04:19.500\nWhy do I not understand that every single human being on earth,\n\n04:19.500 --> 04:25.500\nlike the ones you know, the ones you don't know, but especially the ones that you rely on every day,\n\n04:25.500 --> 04:33.500\nthe people that you just, in the truest sense of the phrase, take for granted?\n\n04:33.500 --> 04:41.500\nWhy is it so hard for us to go about our fucking day-to-day understanding that it's while very unlikely\n\n04:41.500 --> 04:46.500\nbut perfectly possible that someone will be gone tomorrow?\n\n04:46.500 --> 04:50.500\nAnd why can't we treat everybody and ourselves?\n\n04:50.500 --> 04:55.500\nI don't just mean like, oh, I was mean to this guy.\n\n04:55.500 --> 05:07.500\nWhat I was was completely just, I just didn't regard him as anything other than a load-bearing pillar of what we were doing,\n\n05:07.500 --> 05:16.500\nthat there would one day be some silly vacation to celebrate retirement or something, some opportunity,\n\n05:16.500 --> 05:26.500\nmaybe even the funeral of a person that was supposed to go on some schedule that I apparently think death works on,\n\n05:26.500 --> 05:32.500\nwhere we would finally sit down and interact as human beings.\n\n05:32.500 --> 05:40.500\nThat's my narcissism, parsing another person's death.\n\n05:40.500 --> 05:52.500\nIt's all about me, I guess, but I just feel like I'm made of straw tonight.\n\n05:52.500 --> 05:55.500\nI feel like if I move too quickly, my hand will fly off.\n\n05:55.500 --> 05:58.500\nI just feel like everything is so delicate.\n\n05:58.500 --> 06:00.500\nHow long did you know him for?\n\n06:00.500 --> 06:06.500\nWell, he's been there since the beginning, I mean since the moment that it became not a little pilot,\n\n06:06.500 --> 06:14.500\na little idea to the moment that it needed to start pulling up its big boy pants and being on the air, he was there.\n\n06:14.500 --> 06:24.500\nAnd he was unmistakably the reason why we're able to take something so childish where there's people having me sign\n\n06:24.500 --> 06:30.500\na corporate manufactured thing where the name of the character is Mr. Poopy Butthole.\n\n06:30.500 --> 06:42.500\nThe reason why you can be that stupid and childish and yet be so lucrative, compatible with mainstream society\n\n06:42.500 --> 06:47.500\nis because the guy is making the trains run on time.\n\n06:47.500 --> 06:52.500\nIt's coming to us from the Simpsons and the world of getting the job done.\n\n06:52.500 --> 07:00.500\nIf everybody was like me and Justin, you'd be watching two episodes of Rick and Morty every eight years.\n\n07:00.500 --> 07:03.500\nAnd it was out of the blue. I don't think I've ever met him.\n\n07:03.500 --> 07:04.500\nTotally out of the blue.\n\n07:04.500 --> 07:07.500\nAnd Levi said he was with him yesterday and everything was fine.\n\n07:07.500 --> 07:12.500\nThe crew went to the baseball game.\n\n07:12.500 --> 07:23.500\nThe upside is that he was surrounded by co-workers and they were all having a great time.\n\n07:23.500 --> 07:28.500\nHis wife and he just put a daughter in college and I just think it's such a rollercoaster ride.\n\n07:28.500 --> 07:32.500\nAll of these things, I guess that's the bargaining phase of...\n\n07:32.500 --> 07:33.500\nGreat for you.\n\n07:33.500 --> 07:37.500\nYou're kind of like, well, good thing it doesn't have a kid that's like six.\n\n07:37.500 --> 07:39.500\nAnd then I'm like, are you kidding me?\n\n07:39.500 --> 07:42.500\nA young adult has to spend the...\n\n07:42.500 --> 07:48.500\nThey're crossing a threshold into the rest of their life and you get this kneecap.\n\n07:48.500 --> 07:52.500\nThere's a little hatch here.\n\n07:52.500 --> 07:53.500\nI do two things.\n\n07:53.500 --> 07:55.500\nI go numb and I get mad.\n\n07:55.500 --> 08:01.500\nAnd I think that comes from upbringing and there's a hatch here where if I were to open it,\n\n08:01.500 --> 08:04.500\nwhich I won't do because it's bad podcasting,\n\n08:04.500 --> 08:10.500\nit does have to do with thinking about his wife who Rob and I was one of the first people that we worked with.\n\n08:10.500 --> 08:16.500\nShe was the casting director on Heat Vision and Jack and I'm just...\n\n08:16.500 --> 08:18.500\nThey were two lovely people.\n\n08:18.500 --> 08:21.500\nThey were just like great, wonderful people.\n\n08:21.500 --> 08:25.500\nIt's that thought because then that connects to the idea of my God.\n\n08:25.500 --> 08:27.500\nWhat if something happened to Cody?\n\n08:27.500 --> 08:29.500\nWhat if something happened to me?\n\n08:29.500 --> 08:35.500\nIt's just that I can't... I'm opening that hatch by saying I'm not opening that hatch.\n\n08:35.500 --> 08:38.500\nI can't go there.\n\n08:38.500 --> 08:50.500\nMy deepest sympathies and condolences to his family and I guess that's...\n\n08:50.500 --> 08:54.500\nI felt like I'd be remiss in not saying that this happened,\n\n08:54.500 --> 09:01.500\nbut at the same time, I could have said nothing.\n\n09:01.500 --> 09:07.500\nI don't consider it our job to stop the world and that doesn't do anybody any favors.\n\n09:07.500 --> 09:10.500\nI'm just very confused.\n\n09:10.500 --> 09:14.500\nI think there's one more thing that I would say about it,\n\n09:14.500 --> 09:24.500\nwhich is the continual frustration throughout the day of wanting someone to say something that finally makes sense,\n\n09:24.500 --> 09:29.500\nwhich I finally atoned with by around 3 p.m. today where I suddenly realized that,\n\n09:29.500 --> 09:44.500\nwait a minute, my big pet peeve with the deaths that we encounter is people making too much sense of them.\n\n09:44.500 --> 09:47.500\nI've talked about that here before.\n\n09:47.500 --> 09:53.500\nI was telling Dino today, Dino and I, no matter what we do until the day we finally die,\n\n09:53.500 --> 10:00.500\nand no matter how we die, if Dino or I walk under a piano and it falls on us,\n\n10:00.500 --> 10:02.500\npeople are going to make sense of that death.\n\n10:02.500 --> 10:07.500\nThey're going to go like, well, he had a problematic life and he was probably in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\n10:07.500 --> 10:12.500\nThat piano had his name on it, the way and the choices he made.\n\n10:12.500 --> 10:20.500\nThat's my big pet peeve, in spite of the fact that as we all know, Dave Foley drinks 50 cups of coffee a day.\n\n10:20.500 --> 10:27.500\nThere's an instinct in us that no matter what happens to Dave, if he lives to 110 grade,\n\n10:27.500 --> 10:34.500\nif something terrible happens tomorrow, we want it to make sense because we are afraid of death.\n\n10:34.500 --> 10:36.500\nThis happened because of that.\n\n10:36.500 --> 10:37.500\nI got that figured out.\n\n10:37.500 --> 10:43.500\nI think the subtext of that is this really, really arrogant idea that all of us left\n\n10:43.500 --> 10:50.500\nbelonged to some club that made the right decisions and that is really offensive.\n\n10:50.500 --> 10:58.500\nAt least because it was so, it was like, I was getting angry about the nonsense of it.\n\n10:58.500 --> 10:59.500\nThis is a healthy man.\n\n10:59.500 --> 11:00.500\nHe played hockey.\n\n11:00.500 --> 11:03.500\nHe was ripped, man.\n\n11:03.500 --> 11:10.500\nHe was visceral.\n\n11:10.500 --> 11:17.500\nI'm like, someone tell me something and then I finally came around to, no, nobody tell me anything.\n\n11:17.500 --> 11:20.500\nPlease, dear God, give me a senseless death.\n\n11:20.500 --> 11:22.500\nGive me a confusing one.\n\n11:22.500 --> 11:28.500\nLet me go quickly and let people be puzzled by it.\n\n11:28.500 --> 11:35.500\nI think that may be the equivalent of leaving a little pencil splash in the pool and an Olympic dive.\n\n11:35.500 --> 11:43.500\nIf you know, just like no turbulence to the point where people are like, how'd that work?\n\n11:43.500 --> 11:48.500\nGod speed you, Mike.\n\n11:48.500 --> 11:59.500\nJust to make it about me one more time, I can't believe that guy left this world.\n\n11:59.500 --> 12:08.500\nHis story ends with Trump being president and me still working on a fucking draft of a script.\n\n12:08.500 --> 12:21.500\nI hope his last moments weren't fucking having to deal with my horrible bottleneck effect on production.\n\n12:21.500 --> 12:29.500\nWorking on this fucking draft and he's the guy that has to, he's got to be the hero.\n\n12:29.500 --> 12:34.500\nHe's got to absorb all that energy.\n\n12:34.500 --> 12:50.500\nI just hate myself for not turning that thing in, but it's stupid because getting to go to a baseball game is more important\n\n12:50.500 --> 12:55.500\nthan he wasn't going to get joy out of me finishing a draft.\n\n12:55.500 --> 12:58.500\nI talked enough about that.\n\n12:58.500 --> 13:06.500\nI had one item on my list, but it was kind of like, I think maybe Spencer, that's probably for a Spencer night.\n\n13:06.500 --> 13:10.500\nI don't want you to feel left out.\n\n13:10.500 --> 13:13.500\nYou're saving your best up for Spencer?\n\n13:13.500 --> 13:21.500\nI don't like this term hot swappable with hard drives.\n\n13:21.500 --> 13:23.500\nI just think it's a lie.\n\n13:23.500 --> 13:31.500\nYou get a drive, like a little thing that, oh, this reads these kind of cards or these disks and it's hot swappable.\n\n13:31.500 --> 13:36.500\nAnd the implication there is that, oh, so I can poke a little stick into my computer.\n\n13:36.500 --> 13:40.500\nI can write some stuff on it and I can pop it out, throw it in the other thing that I want to think.\n\n13:40.500 --> 13:43.500\nAnd the computer won't go, hey, what are you doing?\n\n13:43.500 --> 13:45.500\nOh, inject much.\n\n13:45.500 --> 13:48.500\nBut it does do that no matter what.\n\n13:48.500 --> 13:50.500\nThere is no such thing as a hot swappable drive.\n\n13:50.500 --> 13:51.500\nThank you.\n\n13:51.500 --> 13:55.500\nI'll be Spencer for you during this.\n\n13:55.500 --> 13:57.500\nI think he just did it.\n\n13:57.500 --> 13:58.500\nThat was it?\n\n13:58.500 --> 13:59.500\nYeah.\n\n13:59.500 --> 14:02.500\nI was just going to add, yeah, man.\n\n14:02.500 --> 14:04.500\nYeah, it's rough.\n\n14:04.500 --> 14:05.500\nYeah.\n\n14:05.500 --> 14:11.500\nYeah, what you really want to do is you get yourself a network card.\n\n14:11.500 --> 14:12.500\nOh, man.\n\n14:12.500 --> 14:13.500\nOh, man.\n\n14:13.500 --> 14:17.500\nYou got real blazing speeds there, real blazing speeds.\n\n14:17.500 --> 14:19.500\nWhere is he?\n\n14:19.500 --> 14:20.500\nWhere is Spencer?\n\n14:20.500 --> 14:22.500\nSpencer goes from that low.\n\n14:22.500 --> 14:23.500\nYeah, man.\n\n14:23.500 --> 14:24.500\nHe's down here.\n\n14:24.500 --> 14:26.500\nBut then he gets really up here.\n\n14:26.500 --> 14:28.500\nHe's got a lot of range.\n\n14:28.500 --> 14:30.500\nI don't know where Spencer is.\n\n14:30.500 --> 14:32.500\nAre we worried about him?\n\n14:32.500 --> 14:35.500\nWell, he's not here and you're doing reverse.\n\n14:35.500 --> 14:36.500\nHot swappable.\n\n14:36.500 --> 14:37.500\nYeah.\n\n14:37.500 --> 14:39.500\nMaybe Spencer's hot swappable.\n\n14:39.500 --> 14:41.500\nHe's just at a different podcast.\n\n14:41.500 --> 14:46.500\nI really hope this is not a long answer, but what is hot swapping?\n\n14:46.500 --> 14:49.500\nThat's where you poop on somebody's chest, right?\n\n14:49.500 --> 14:51.500\nWell, I would say a stint.\n\n14:51.500 --> 14:55.500\nI think in general, the concept is just the idea of being able to...\n\n14:55.500 --> 14:57.500\nSteve Levy in the booze, everybody.\n\n14:57.500 --> 14:59.500\nSteve Levy.\n\n14:59.500 --> 15:01.500\nHello, Steve.\n\n15:01.500 --> 15:03.500\nThat's an option.\n\n15:03.500 --> 15:04.500\nWhatever.\n\n15:04.500 --> 15:05.500\nSpencer took the night off.\n\n15:05.500 --> 15:06.500\nOh.\n\n15:14.500 --> 15:15.500\nWhat?\n\n15:15.500 --> 15:19.500\nPoor beleaguered saltmine worker, Rob Schrab.\n\n15:19.500 --> 15:23.500\nOh, you owe your soul to the company store, right?\n\n15:23.500 --> 15:25.500\nThis poor guy.\n\n15:25.500 --> 15:27.500\nThat's an option.\n\n15:27.500 --> 15:29.500\nWhat are you, Fred Flintstone?\n\n15:29.500 --> 15:31.500\nMr. Slate?\n\n15:31.500 --> 15:33.500\nI'm just whipping you.\n\n15:33.500 --> 15:36.500\nYeah, I got to make you come talk to Ed Newmire,\n\n15:36.500 --> 15:39.500\nthe author of the Robocop screenplay.\n\n15:39.500 --> 15:41.500\nThat was an awkward way to introduce our guest.\n\n15:41.500 --> 15:43.500\nLet's bring out Ed Newmire.\n\n15:51.500 --> 15:53.500\nHello, Ed.\n\n15:53.500 --> 15:55.500\nHello.\n\n15:59.500 --> 16:01.500\nDan, don't screw this up.\n\n16:01.500 --> 16:03.500\nThis is really important to me tonight.\n\n16:07.500 --> 16:09.500\nI'm sorry about those awful chairs.\n\n16:09.500 --> 16:13.500\nIntroduce or give him the, you know, the introduction\n\n16:13.500 --> 16:16.500\nthat a fellow of his stature deserves.\n\n16:16.500 --> 16:21.500\nI mean, my introduction of you would be one of my rambling things\n\n16:21.500 --> 16:23.500\nor Jeff would cut me off and say, please welcome Ed Newmire\n\n16:23.500 --> 16:25.500\nin the middle of me trying to introduce you\n\n16:25.500 --> 16:29.500\nbecause I'd be like, look, we've had some legends up here.\n\n16:29.500 --> 16:31.500\nI get nervous.\n\n16:31.500 --> 16:34.500\nI am a bad interviewer.\n\n16:34.500 --> 16:37.500\nBut there's a difference here where it's just like,\n\n16:37.500 --> 16:40.500\ngenuinely you are a hero to me.\n\n16:40.500 --> 16:45.500\nYou're a person that just exemplifies, like,\n\n16:45.500 --> 16:48.500\nnot only to me what we'll talk about,\n\n16:48.500 --> 16:50.500\nwhether you think this is true,\n\n16:50.500 --> 16:55.500\nbut it demonstrates the highest kind of, like,\n\n16:55.500 --> 17:01.500\ncoda of the craft of writing movies\n\n17:01.500 --> 17:05.500\nand also, like, demonstrates that that pays off,\n\n17:05.500 --> 17:08.500\nthat you pick your shots and whatever.\n\n17:08.500 --> 17:10.500\nBut let's get to know you a little bit\n\n17:10.500 --> 17:14.500\nbecause, God, I'm a bad interviewer.\n\n17:14.500 --> 17:19.500\nBut I think that we'll go through the early biography.\n\n17:19.500 --> 17:21.500\nLike, are you a Californian?\n\n17:21.500 --> 17:23.500\nWere you born here?\n\n17:23.500 --> 17:27.500\nI was actually born in Vienna, Austria by Chance\n\n17:27.500 --> 17:29.500\nand I grew up in the Marin County,\n\n17:29.500 --> 17:31.500\nSan Francisco Bay Area, Marin County.\n\n17:31.500 --> 17:33.500\nI grew up in San Samo.\n\n17:33.500 --> 17:35.500\nAnd you were a journalism major?\n\n17:35.500 --> 17:37.500\nYeah, my parents were both journalists\n\n17:37.500 --> 17:40.500\nand so that followed me through high school.\n\n17:40.500 --> 17:44.500\nI was the editor of my high school newspaper.\n\n17:44.500 --> 17:46.500\nBut I always wanted to do movies.\n\n17:46.500 --> 17:49.500\nWas there anything, too, because I was also a journalism major\n\n17:49.500 --> 17:52.500\nand my justification for it being from Wisconsin\n\n17:52.500 --> 17:56.500\nwas that I couldn't possibly make the leap\n\n17:56.500 --> 18:00.500\nto, well, I'm going to major in writing.\n\n18:00.500 --> 18:02.500\nI'm going to be a writer.\n\n18:02.500 --> 18:04.500\nI'm going to be creative for a living.\n\n18:04.500 --> 18:09.500\nI had to find a Midwestern-compatible version\n\n18:09.500 --> 18:11.500\nof being a person that sits at a typewriter\n\n18:11.500 --> 18:15.500\nthat also felt enough like welding to...\n\n18:15.500 --> 18:18.500\nWas there anything to that?\n\n18:18.500 --> 18:20.500\nIt was kind of the first time I ever had a little thing\n\n18:20.500 --> 18:22.500\nwhere you could do something.\n\n18:22.500 --> 18:25.500\nAnd I immediately started turning it into a place to do...\n\n18:25.500 --> 18:28.500\nI used to do violent satires, like my friend\n\n18:28.500 --> 18:30.500\nwho was the school president.\n\n18:30.500 --> 18:33.500\nWe shot him in front of the school.\n\n18:33.500 --> 18:36.500\nWe did Zapruder films and things like that.\n\n18:36.500 --> 18:40.500\nCertainly, propaganda is such a huge part\n\n18:40.500 --> 18:42.500\nof some of the most effective parts\n\n18:42.500 --> 18:44.500\nof the things you're most known for,\n\n18:44.500 --> 18:47.500\nlike the groupers, like both really interesting things\n\n18:47.500 --> 18:49.500\nto talk about.\n\n18:49.500 --> 18:53.500\nBut both of them have these Shakespearean heralds\n\n18:53.500 --> 18:55.500\nthat are the media.\n\n18:55.500 --> 18:57.500\nAnd so I imagine...\n\n18:57.500 --> 18:59.500\nI think I was always interested in that stuff.\n\n18:59.500 --> 19:01.500\nAnd I was literally all my...\n\n19:01.500 --> 19:04.500\nSome of my friends now were my people who were...\n\n19:04.500 --> 19:06.500\nLike Woodward and Bernstein were big guys.\n\n19:06.500 --> 19:09.500\nAnd so I know the guys who knew them and stuff like that.\n\n19:09.500 --> 19:11.500\nI know a lot of journalists and that kind of thing.\n\n19:11.500 --> 19:13.500\nAnd that was an exciting idea.\n\n19:13.500 --> 19:15.500\nThat here was the chorus.\n\n19:15.500 --> 19:17.500\nI don't know, it was an interesting device also.\n\n19:17.500 --> 19:19.500\nAnd it was cheap.\n\n19:19.500 --> 19:21.500\nYou could do a lot of things without spending any money.\n\n19:21.500 --> 19:23.500\nIt's the same as having a guy come out\n\n19:23.500 --> 19:26.500\nand explain the Montague's and the Capulets.\n\n19:26.500 --> 19:29.500\nThey're just like, well, here's what's going on.\n\n19:29.500 --> 19:33.500\nBut the more important thing is that unlike that guy,\n\n19:33.500 --> 19:36.500\nthe world as a character...\n\n19:36.500 --> 19:38.500\nDetroit is a character in Robocop.\n\n19:38.500 --> 19:41.500\nIt's so important to understand the relationship\n\n19:41.500 --> 19:44.500\nbetween people and media, what's going on in the world.\n\n19:44.500 --> 19:46.500\nAnd even though the whole story takes place\n\n19:46.500 --> 19:49.500\nin a really gritty, local part of this new earth,\n\n19:49.500 --> 19:54.500\nit's so effective to be able to zoom in\n\n19:54.500 --> 19:56.500\nfrom a global perspective.\n\n19:56.500 --> 19:58.500\nRight, and show other little parts of that world\n\n19:58.500 --> 20:00.500\nand imply a bigger world.\n\n20:00.500 --> 20:02.500\nAnd that was always there.\n\n20:02.500 --> 20:04.500\nAnd it was something that...\n\n20:04.500 --> 20:06.500\nI think Verhoeven had a big fight about that at one point\n\n20:06.500 --> 20:08.500\nbecause I always wanted it to be completely separate\n\n20:08.500 --> 20:10.500\nfrom the story, that it was different.\n\n20:10.500 --> 20:14.500\nOne time he said, well, maybe we'll be in a TV studio\n\n20:14.500 --> 20:16.500\nand you'll see the news and you'll...\n\n20:16.500 --> 20:18.500\nAnd I was like, I don't know why I was this way.\n\n20:18.500 --> 20:19.500\nI was 27 years old.\n\n20:19.500 --> 20:21.500\nI was like, no, that's terrible. You can't do that.\n\n20:21.500 --> 20:23.500\nWe had a huge fight about it.\n\n20:23.500 --> 20:24.500\nOh, really?\n\n20:24.500 --> 20:25.500\nYeah, and then he came around and he said,\n\n20:25.500 --> 20:26.500\nokay, all right, I get it.\n\n20:26.500 --> 20:28.500\nAnd then he said it was more...\n\n20:28.500 --> 20:30.500\nHe said, oh, that's actually more modern.\n\n20:30.500 --> 20:31.500\nThat's a really Brechtian idea.\n\n20:31.500 --> 20:35.500\nI don't think he said Brechtian, but it is a Brechtian idea.\n\n20:35.500 --> 20:37.500\nOkay, well, yeah, I'm kidding.\n\n20:37.500 --> 20:40.500\nSo because part of this is your story is interesting\n\n20:40.500 --> 20:42.500\nbecause Robocop, correct me if I'm wrong,\n\n20:42.500 --> 20:44.500\nthis is your first screen credit.\n\n20:44.500 --> 20:46.500\nIt's your first project.\n\n20:46.500 --> 20:47.500\nRight.\n\n20:47.500 --> 20:48.500\nI came to the business.\n\n20:48.500 --> 20:52.500\nI went to UCLA Film School and then my girlfriend\n\n20:52.500 --> 20:54.500\nbroke up with me and I couldn't finish UCLA's film school.\n\n20:54.500 --> 20:59.500\nBut I got a job on taxi and they paid me $175 a month\n\n20:59.500 --> 21:01.500\nor something to be a runner.\n\n21:01.500 --> 21:03.500\nAnd I did that for a little while.\n\n21:03.500 --> 21:06.500\nYou were a PA on taxi and which made us immediately go,\n\n21:06.500 --> 21:08.500\noh, was there an intersection between you and Sam Simon?\n\n21:08.500 --> 21:09.500\nAnd the answer's no, but...\n\n21:09.500 --> 21:11.500\nNo, no, but I did...\n\n21:11.500 --> 21:14.500\nI was the guy who used to sit outside the door\n\n21:14.500 --> 21:16.500\nand wait for the script pages.\n\n21:16.500 --> 21:19.500\nAnd I had to drive them to a place called Barber's Place\n\n21:19.500 --> 21:21.500\nand they typed them up and then I had to pick them up\n\n21:21.500 --> 21:22.500\nat six in the morning.\n\n21:22.500 --> 21:23.500\nAnd Barber's Place was what?\n\n21:23.500 --> 21:24.500\nIt was a typing place.\n\n21:24.500 --> 21:25.500\nIt was just where you typed your scripts up.\n\n21:25.500 --> 21:27.500\nThis was before there were computers.\n\n21:27.500 --> 21:28.500\nYeah.\n\n21:28.500 --> 21:30.500\nOh, yeah, I need myself.\n\n21:30.500 --> 21:31.500\nThey would type it.\n\n21:31.500 --> 21:32.500\nIt's not a copy place.\n\n21:32.500 --> 21:34.500\nIt was like they would just type them on.\n\n21:34.500 --> 21:36.500\nNo, they would literally...\n\n21:36.500 --> 21:38.500\nThere were a bunch of people who sat up, mostly women,\n\n21:38.500 --> 21:40.500\nwho sat up all night and re-typed the scripts.\n\n21:40.500 --> 21:42.500\nAnd then they were delivered to the...\n\n21:42.500 --> 21:45.500\nThey would take drafts with notes on them and stuff like that\n\n21:45.500 --> 21:47.500\nand just do a clean copy of them.\n\n21:47.500 --> 21:49.500\nRight, because there's no word processing.\n\n21:49.500 --> 21:51.500\nThey would give them to a guy and they would drive them\n\n21:51.500 --> 21:53.500\nin their little car and then go pick up a box of scripts.\n\n21:53.500 --> 21:55.500\nWe were talking about this afternoon,\n\n21:55.500 --> 21:59.500\nlike how there were so many roadblocks back then.\n\n21:59.500 --> 22:02.500\nAnd people still got stuff done.\n\n22:02.500 --> 22:04.500\nLike, where is it today?\n\n22:04.500 --> 22:06.500\nIt's like, oh, I can't connect with a Wi-Fi and print.\n\n22:06.500 --> 22:07.500\nFuck it.\n\n22:07.500 --> 22:08.500\nJust fuck it.\n\n22:08.500 --> 22:09.500\nYou know, it's like...\n\n22:09.500 --> 22:10.500\nI mean, including us, Jonathan.\n\n22:10.500 --> 22:12.500\nYeah, we were talking today about, you know,\n\n22:12.500 --> 22:15.500\nas people tend to in the loss of a colleague,\n\n22:15.500 --> 22:17.500\nwe're having drinks and we're suddenly going\n\n22:17.500 --> 22:18.500\nthrough our whole lives.\n\n22:18.500 --> 22:21.500\nAnd yeah, we were briefly marveling\n\n22:21.500 --> 22:24.500\nin how we had a radio show in Milwaukee\n\n22:24.500 --> 22:26.500\nand how we would get up at 5 a.m.,\n\n22:26.500 --> 22:29.500\ndrink two pots of coffee, write five scripts,\n\n22:29.500 --> 22:31.500\nget in a car, drive them down icy roads\n\n22:31.500 --> 22:34.500\nto a Kinko's because they had a printer\n\n22:34.500 --> 22:37.500\nand pay them the money that they wanted\n\n22:37.500 --> 22:40.500\nto print up these scripts and then drive.\n\n22:40.500 --> 22:42.500\nIt's like, yeah, I would never do that these days.\n\n22:42.500 --> 22:43.500\nYeah.\n\n22:43.500 --> 22:45.500\nAnyways, but you...\n\n22:45.500 --> 22:47.500\nAnd then right from that PA job,\n\n22:47.500 --> 22:55.500\nit says your Wikipedia page is so joyfully Spartan.\n\n22:55.500 --> 22:58.500\nYou're a proofreader at Paramount?\n\n22:58.500 --> 23:00.500\nNo, I was a scriptreader.\n\n23:00.500 --> 23:02.500\nI was a reader in the Story Analyst Guild.\n\n23:02.500 --> 23:04.500\nAnd they pay people.\n\n23:04.500 --> 23:05.500\nYou probably...\n\n23:05.500 --> 23:06.500\nDoing coverage?\n\n23:06.500 --> 23:07.500\nTo do coverage for executives.\n\n23:07.500 --> 23:09.500\nAnd you read everything that comes in\n\n23:09.500 --> 23:10.500\nand you do a report on it.\n\n23:10.500 --> 23:12.500\nYeah, they call a proofreader on your Wikipedia.\n\n23:12.500 --> 23:13.500\nYou're going to...\n\n23:13.500 --> 23:14.500\nYeah.\n\n23:14.500 --> 23:15.500\nSomeone's going to bring the hammer down.\n\n23:15.500 --> 23:17.500\nDo you remember any of the scripts that you read that went,\n\n23:17.500 --> 23:18.500\noh, this is great.\n\n23:18.500 --> 23:19.500\nSomebody...\n\n23:19.500 --> 23:20.500\nNo, no, I did.\n\n23:20.500 --> 23:21.500\nI remember reading Star Wars.\n\n23:21.500 --> 23:22.500\nStar Wars.\n\n23:22.500 --> 23:23.500\nI read War Games and I said,\n\n23:23.500 --> 23:24.500\nyou should make this movie.\n\n23:24.500 --> 23:26.500\nAnd they said, nobody wants to see a movie\n\n23:26.500 --> 23:27.500\nabout nuclear war.\n\n23:27.500 --> 23:36.500\nAnd then you said, but I can get you Daphne Coleman.\n\n23:36.500 --> 23:38.500\nAnd then I read a script which I really...\n\n23:38.500 --> 23:41.500\nI made my reputation at Columbia Pictures on these...\n\n23:41.500 --> 23:45.500\nI read a risky business and I wrote a coverage for it.\n\n23:45.500 --> 23:48.500\nIt was like 18 pages long, which is not what you want\n\n23:48.500 --> 23:50.500\nwhen you're an executive at the morning meeting.\n\n23:50.500 --> 23:51.500\nAnd I said, this is the greatest movie in the world.\n\n23:51.500 --> 23:52.500\nYou have to make it.\n\n23:52.500 --> 23:55.500\nAnd there was a memo came around and said,\n\n23:55.500 --> 23:58.500\nFrank Price, the chairman, saying that there would no longer be\n\n23:58.500 --> 24:00.500\nany coverage longer than two pages.\n\n24:00.500 --> 24:05.500\nAnd then when the movie came out,\n\n24:05.500 --> 24:07.500\nthey were interested in me suddenly.\n\n24:07.500 --> 24:10.500\nAnd when the movie came out, I bet somebody 100 bucks,\n\n24:10.500 --> 24:12.500\nthe vice president, that it was going to be a hit.\n\n24:12.500 --> 24:13.500\nAnd it was.\n\n24:13.500 --> 24:15.500\nAnd then suddenly they offered me a job.\n\n24:15.500 --> 24:19.500\nAnd for a moment, I was an executive who had his finger\n\n24:19.500 --> 24:21.500\non the pulse of youth.\n\n24:21.500 --> 24:24.500\nAnd that lasted for about a year at Universal.\n\n24:24.500 --> 24:26.500\nAnd I wasn't really suited for it.\n\n24:26.500 --> 24:30.500\nI read that you were offered to be the vice president at Universal.\n\n24:30.500 --> 24:32.500\nI was on a track.\n\n24:32.500 --> 24:34.500\nThey called them CEs now.\n\n24:34.500 --> 24:36.500\nI was a junior executive.\n\n24:36.500 --> 24:39.500\nAnd that's sort of how I learned all the business stuff,\n\n24:39.500 --> 24:40.500\nif you will.\n\n24:40.500 --> 24:41.500\nAnd I was under a VP.\n\n24:41.500 --> 24:44.500\nAnd yes, if I had stayed there, I would have been a VP,\n\n24:44.500 --> 24:46.500\nwhich I later was at another production company,\n\n24:46.500 --> 24:47.500\nMartin Rantsehoff.\n\n24:47.500 --> 24:50.500\nI was the VP of development and stuff like that.\n\n24:50.500 --> 24:52.500\nAnd this is where it gets really interesting.\n\n24:52.500 --> 24:56.500\nAnd this is where I start to kind of worship you\n\n24:56.500 --> 24:58.500\nin the story of your path.\n\n24:58.500 --> 25:04.500\nBecause in the underworld, where the werewolves of suits\n\n25:04.500 --> 25:07.500\nand the vampires of writers are in constant war,\n\n25:07.500 --> 25:09.500\nyou can root for one or the other.\n\n25:09.500 --> 25:12.500\nAnd there's all kinds of hybrids that are exciting and heroic.\n\n25:12.500 --> 25:14.500\nBut there is a war nonetheless.\n\n25:14.500 --> 25:18.500\nAnd so there is something really romantic about a guy\n\n25:18.500 --> 25:20.500\nthat does what you did.\n\n25:20.500 --> 25:24.500\nYou can just imagine the biopic tee-up of this moment,\n\n25:24.500 --> 25:29.500\nwhere you have this easier, you know, you're on this path.\n\n25:29.500 --> 25:32.500\nAnd then for whatever reason, you decide,\n\n25:32.500 --> 25:36.500\nno, I'd like to go behind door number two.\n\n25:36.500 --> 25:42.500\nI'm going to abandon this career of being liked,\n\n25:42.500 --> 25:46.500\nbeing on the side that calls the shots, makes the money.\n\n25:46.500 --> 25:49.500\nBecause I'm really passionate about this idea.\n\n25:49.500 --> 25:55.500\nI had called Robocop.\n\n25:55.500 --> 25:57.500\nIt's true.\n\n25:57.500 --> 26:00.500\nDuring this period, I thought, I'm really not this guy.\n\n26:00.500 --> 26:02.500\nI don't want to have...\n\n26:02.500 --> 26:05.500\nI wasn't good at returning 100 phone calls a day.\n\n26:05.500 --> 26:07.500\nAnd there were people who were.\n\n26:07.500 --> 26:09.500\nThere were people I really admired who really were good at that.\n\n26:09.500 --> 26:11.500\nSome of them are good writers, too.\n\n26:11.500 --> 26:15.500\nI mean, Mike Waldron, a shout out to him,\n\n26:15.500 --> 26:19.500\nhe was kind of an Ed Newmeyer at Star Burns,\n\n26:19.500 --> 26:22.500\nmy little studio where it was like,\n\n26:22.500 --> 26:24.500\nyou hire young people,\n\n26:24.500 --> 26:27.500\nand you make them do the stuff you're too busy to do.\n\n26:27.500 --> 26:30.500\nSome of it is reading other people's stuff, taking...\n\n26:30.500 --> 26:35.500\nIt's like, he's a very handsome kid from Georgia,\n\n26:35.500 --> 26:37.500\nand people like talking to him,\n\n26:37.500 --> 26:39.500\nand he doesn't mind talking on the phone,\n\n26:39.500 --> 26:40.500\nand I remember him saying to me,\n\n26:40.500 --> 26:43.500\njust so you remember, I did come out here to be a writer,\n\n26:43.500 --> 26:45.500\nand I was like, too bad, you're a daywalker.\n\n26:45.500 --> 26:48.500\nLike, Whistler's got more plans for you.\n\n26:48.500 --> 26:51.500\nBut I will return the favor to you\n\n26:51.500 --> 26:55.500\nif you do this shitty neurotypical stuff.\n\n26:55.500 --> 26:58.500\nI will help you as much as I can.\n\n26:58.500 --> 27:01.500\nAnd it amazes me that some people are just good at both,\n\n27:01.500 --> 27:04.500\nthat there are charming people who...\n\n27:04.500 --> 27:06.500\nYeah, they're good writers.\n\n27:06.500 --> 27:09.500\nThey're just cursed with this networking ability.\n\n27:09.500 --> 27:11.500\nYou know, I don't think I really did.\n\n27:11.500 --> 27:12.500\nI wasn't comfortable with that.\n\n27:12.500 --> 27:15.500\nI was never... I never felt cool enough for the job.\n\n27:15.500 --> 27:17.500\nAnd when I meet executives over time,\n\n27:17.500 --> 27:19.500\nthey all seem much cooler than I ever was.\n\n27:19.500 --> 27:23.500\nDo you buy into the dichotomy of the introvert versus the extrovert,\n\n27:23.500 --> 27:27.500\nwhere it's like the introvert is recharging their batteries\n\n27:27.500 --> 27:31.500\nwhile they're alone, while they're operating individually,\n\n27:31.500 --> 27:35.500\nand they don't mind interacting with other people,\n\n27:35.500 --> 27:36.500\nbut that's a discharge.\n\n27:36.500 --> 27:39.500\nAnd then there are some people who are actually receiving\n\n27:39.500 --> 27:42.500\nan energy charge from of all things\n\n27:42.500 --> 27:44.500\ninteracting with other people.\n\n27:44.500 --> 27:47.500\nAnd it gets them through having to play Minecraft,\n\n27:47.500 --> 27:48.500\nwhich blows my fucking mind.\n\n27:48.500 --> 27:49.500\nThey're just sitting there,\n\n27:49.500 --> 27:51.500\nso I hope the phone rings.\n\n27:51.500 --> 27:53.500\nThat's you.\n\n27:53.500 --> 27:56.500\nWhen you're sitting at home, you're like,\n\n27:56.500 --> 27:58.500\nGod damn it.\n\n27:58.500 --> 28:00.500\nI get ants in my pants.\n\n28:00.500 --> 28:02.500\nI gotta go out and be around the people.\n\n28:02.500 --> 28:06.500\nSo then you can recharge and get through those lonely nights\n\n28:06.500 --> 28:09.500\nbetween the sticks calling you\n\n28:09.500 --> 28:13.500\nand having you come out to a concert.\n\n28:13.500 --> 28:18.500\nI don't think we talked about my tour with sticks enough.\n\n28:18.500 --> 28:20.500\nI replaced Tommy's shot.\n\n28:20.500 --> 28:21.500\nNo, that's a...\n\n28:21.500 --> 28:22.500\nOkay, come on.\n\n28:22.500 --> 28:23.500\nYeah, I am an extrovert.\n\n28:23.500 --> 28:26.500\nI don't think I need other people to totally recharge,\n\n28:26.500 --> 28:27.500\nbut I do...\n\n28:27.500 --> 28:28.500\nI don't know.\n\n28:28.500 --> 28:31.500\nI think it's both ways.\n\n28:31.500 --> 28:32.500\nI need to be alone,\n\n28:32.500 --> 28:34.500\nbut I also need to be around people.\n\n28:34.500 --> 28:37.500\nAnd both of those are...\n\n28:37.500 --> 28:39.500\nRecharge and discharge in a way.\n\n28:39.500 --> 28:40.500\nWell, okay.\n\n28:40.500 --> 28:41.500\nAll right, so...\n\n28:41.500 --> 28:42.500\nCome on, man.\n\n28:42.500 --> 28:43.500\nYou figured out a way to be...\n\n28:43.500 --> 28:45.500\nYou don't have to choose one or the other.\n\n28:45.500 --> 28:47.500\nI'm not sure if I can answer this right,\n\n28:47.500 --> 28:49.500\nbut what I would say is...\n\n28:49.500 --> 28:50.500\nI always want to...\n\n28:50.500 --> 28:51.500\nWhen I was...\n\n28:51.500 --> 28:53.500\nMany years ago, when I wrote Robocop,\n\n28:53.500 --> 28:54.500\nand when it was successful,\n\n28:54.500 --> 28:56.500\nthere were times that I would entertain myself\n\n28:56.500 --> 28:58.500\nof thinking, well, I did this and I did that.\n\n28:58.500 --> 29:00.500\nI did that and I did that.\n\n29:00.500 --> 29:01.500\nLike thinking about...\n\n29:01.500 --> 29:03.500\nAnd then now, more and more,\n\n29:03.500 --> 29:05.500\nI think, well, no, I did that because Paul was there,\n\n29:05.500 --> 29:07.500\nand we talked about this.\n\n29:07.500 --> 29:09.500\nAnd we did this because John Davidson said,\n\n29:09.500 --> 29:11.500\nwell, you can have 25 cents to do that\n\n29:11.500 --> 29:12.500\nand some 10-foil.\n\n29:12.500 --> 29:14.500\nAnd there were a lot of people involved in that process\n\n29:14.500 --> 29:16.500\nthat made it what it was.\n\n29:16.500 --> 29:23.500\nAge sweetens the recognition of the myth...\n\n29:23.500 --> 29:25.500\nThat the auteur myth is an auteur.\n\n29:25.500 --> 29:27.500\nYou start to open up to...\n\n29:27.500 --> 29:29.500\nSo Verhoeven and I get together,\n\n29:29.500 --> 29:31.500\nand we've been getting together for 35 years,\n\n29:31.500 --> 29:33.500\nand we've done most of our work over breakfast.\n\n29:33.500 --> 29:35.500\nAnd we get together now still.\n\n29:35.500 --> 29:36.500\nWe just did recently.\n\n29:36.500 --> 29:37.500\nAnd the last time we got together,\n\n29:37.500 --> 29:39.500\nall we did was talk about what a great producer\n\n29:39.500 --> 29:40.500\nJohn Davidson was\n\n29:40.500 --> 29:42.500\nand how the movie never would have happened\n\n29:42.500 --> 29:44.500\nwithout John Davidson in a million different ways.\n\n29:44.500 --> 29:47.500\nNow, John and Paul didn't even speak during the movie.\n\n29:47.500 --> 29:50.500\nThey couldn't even talk to each other in the room.\n\n29:50.500 --> 29:53.500\nI was the middle child who would try to get the parents\n\n29:53.500 --> 29:54.500\nto come in and talk,\n\n29:54.500 --> 29:56.500\nand then they would run out after cursing at each other.\n\n29:56.500 --> 29:58.500\nBut now, they realize that it was...\n\n29:58.500 --> 30:00.500\nWell, I think they even did then.\n\n30:00.500 --> 30:02.500\nWhen you wrote it,\n\n30:02.500 --> 30:04.500\ndid you always, while you were writing this,\n\n30:04.500 --> 30:07.500\nbecause this is going to be called Robocop?\n\n30:07.500 --> 30:08.500\nI did.\n\n30:08.500 --> 30:11.500\nNo, no, it never ever happened to me since,\n\n30:11.500 --> 30:13.500\nbut it actually...\n\n30:13.500 --> 30:15.500\nI was working as a reader,\n\n30:15.500 --> 30:18.500\nand then Columbia Pictures was out,\n\n30:18.500 --> 30:19.500\nnot in Culver City,\n\n30:19.500 --> 30:22.500\nbut it was in Burbank on a lot called TBS then,\n\n30:22.500 --> 30:24.500\nwhich is now known as the Warner Brothers Lot.\n\n30:24.500 --> 30:26.500\nAnd I had an office right next to the...\n\n30:26.500 --> 30:27.500\nIt was a trailer office,\n\n30:27.500 --> 30:29.500\nand it was right next to one of the big backlots.\n\n30:29.500 --> 30:31.500\nAnd suddenly, they were making this giant picture,\n\n30:31.500 --> 30:33.500\nthis giant science fiction picture,\n\n30:33.500 --> 30:35.500\nwhich no one would tell you what it was.\n\n30:35.500 --> 30:36.500\nAnd I would get out of...\n\n30:36.500 --> 30:37.500\nI would leave my office,\n\n30:37.500 --> 30:39.500\nand I would go out onto the set.\n\n30:39.500 --> 30:41.500\nAnd what I really wanted to do in those days was make a movie.\n\n30:41.500 --> 30:43.500\nAnd there were so many people on this movie\n\n30:43.500 --> 30:45.500\nthat they didn't know who was working on it and who wasn't.\n\n30:45.500 --> 30:46.500\nThey were shooting all night,\n\n30:46.500 --> 30:48.500\nand so I would go and work on the art department\n\n30:48.500 --> 30:51.500\nand stay there until about three or four in the morning.\n\n30:51.500 --> 30:52.500\nAnd I said,\n\n30:52.500 --> 30:53.500\nso what's the first night?\n\n30:53.500 --> 30:54.500\nWhat's this movie about?\n\n30:54.500 --> 30:55.500\nAnd it's about a robot,\n\n30:55.500 --> 30:57.500\nand they pointed at a girl in a tutu\n\n30:57.500 --> 30:59.500\nand said, that's a robot.\n\n30:59.500 --> 31:01.500\nAnd it was Blade Runner.\n\n31:01.500 --> 31:03.500\nAnd then I watched them shoot someone Blade Runner.\n\n31:03.500 --> 31:05.500\nI was on that set.\n\n31:05.500 --> 31:06.500\nIt was extraordinary.\n\n31:06.500 --> 31:07.500\nI'd never seen anything like it.\n\n31:07.500 --> 31:10.500\nAnd then about three o'clock in the morning,\n\n31:10.500 --> 31:12.500\none night, I sort of had this idea\n\n31:12.500 --> 31:15.500\nof what I thought a robot should look like on that street.\n\n31:15.500 --> 31:17.500\nAnd it was looking...\n\n31:17.500 --> 31:19.500\nIt was a robot that looked a little like Robocop.\n\n31:19.500 --> 31:21.500\nAnd it was next to that blue car.\n\n31:21.500 --> 31:23.500\nThey call it the spinner.\n\n31:23.500 --> 31:26.500\nAnd suddenly, the title just...\n\n31:26.500 --> 31:29.500\ncame into my mind, like Robocop.\n\n31:29.500 --> 31:30.500\nBoom.\n\n31:30.500 --> 31:31.500\nAnd it was really weird.\n\n31:31.500 --> 31:33.500\nAnd I think it's the power of location.\n\n31:33.500 --> 31:34.500\nI truly do.\n\n31:34.500 --> 31:35.500\nIf you are on a...\n\n31:35.500 --> 31:36.500\nIt's very...\n\n31:36.500 --> 31:37.500\nAt least for me, location and architecture\n\n31:37.500 --> 31:38.500\nand things like that,\n\n31:38.500 --> 31:40.500\nare very creative ideas come to me in that.\n\n31:40.500 --> 31:43.500\nAnd I think that was such a supercharged set\n\n31:43.500 --> 31:45.500\nfor a young man to be on, like...\n\n31:45.500 --> 31:48.500\nNow, looking backwards through...\n\n31:48.500 --> 31:51.500\nSo that kid who's having that moment is like,\n\n31:51.500 --> 31:53.500\nokay, I think I'm gonna write this movie.\n\n31:53.500 --> 31:54.500\nIt's gonna be called Robocop.\n\n31:54.500 --> 31:55.500\nI don't want him to be in a tutu.\n\n31:55.500 --> 31:56.500\nI want him to...\n\n31:56.500 --> 31:58.500\nWhatever happened to the...\n\n31:58.500 --> 32:01.500\nIt's a very Schrabby sounding thing.\n\n32:01.500 --> 32:02.500\nThis is Rob Schrab.\n\n32:02.500 --> 32:03.500\nI'm Rob Schrab.\n\n32:03.500 --> 32:08.500\nTo be like, come on, it's a robot.\n\n32:08.500 --> 32:09.500\nHello.\n\n32:09.500 --> 32:12.500\nIf you knock on it, your hand should hurt.\n\n32:18.500 --> 32:20.500\nAnd after like 30 years, it becomes a...\n\n32:20.500 --> 32:23.500\nThat was the original poster.\n\n32:23.500 --> 32:27.500\nThe poster for you kids was Robocop climbing out of the car\n\n32:27.500 --> 32:29.500\nand the poster said,\n\n32:29.500 --> 32:33.500\npart man, part machine, all cop.\n\n32:33.500 --> 32:35.500\nAnd I remember being 15 and I was like,\n\n32:35.500 --> 32:37.500\nhere's the thing is that until you see that movie,\n\n32:37.500 --> 32:38.500\nuntil you see a frame of it,\n\n32:38.500 --> 32:41.500\nI mean, you're a wash in a world of like,\n\n32:41.500 --> 32:44.500\noh, Spielberg came out with six pieces of crap,\n\n32:44.500 --> 32:46.500\none of them will stick and write history.\n\n32:46.500 --> 32:47.500\nAnd you're very...\n\n32:47.500 --> 32:49.500\nYou're jaded even back then.\n\n32:49.500 --> 32:50.500\nAnd you have permission to be jaded.\n\n32:50.500 --> 32:52.500\nAnd I saw that poster and I was like,\n\n32:52.500 --> 32:53.500\nthis is...\n\n32:53.500 --> 32:55.500\nThis misses the mark.\n\n32:55.500 --> 32:56.500\nThis is silly.\n\n32:56.500 --> 32:57.500\nWhat do they mean Robocop?\n\n32:57.500 --> 32:59.500\nLike Schrab said backstage.\n\n32:59.500 --> 33:01.500\nIt sounds like a kid's movie.\n\n33:01.500 --> 33:04.500\nNow, this is the difficult part of the question.\n\n33:04.500 --> 33:07.500\nSo this kid who's visualizing this,\n\n33:07.500 --> 33:11.500\nat that point, where are you at tonally?\n\n33:11.500 --> 33:14.500\nAre you thinking to yourself...\n\n33:14.500 --> 33:19.500\nThat part of the point of it is that it's going to be\n\n33:19.500 --> 33:23.500\na disarming like hypodermic for some seriously\n\n33:23.500 --> 33:26.500\nlike potent kind of edge?\n\n33:26.500 --> 33:29.500\nOr are you simply at that time going like,\n\n33:29.500 --> 33:31.500\ngee whiz robots are swell?\n\n33:31.500 --> 33:32.500\nYeah, no, no.\n\n33:32.500 --> 33:35.500\nI think the answer is there were two levels going on.\n\n33:35.500 --> 33:38.500\nThere was this has to be a movie for eight year olds or whatever.\n\n33:38.500 --> 33:41.500\nAnd this has to be a movie for people who were thinking.\n\n33:41.500 --> 33:43.500\nAnd it can be both of those things at the same time.\n\n33:43.500 --> 33:45.500\nI don't think I immediately thought that.\n\n33:45.500 --> 33:48.500\nWhat I thought was I want to make a movie about business\n\n33:48.500 --> 33:51.500\nand how the corporate world is a dangerous world.\n\n33:51.500 --> 33:54.500\nI wanted to see businessmen killing each other.\n\n33:54.500 --> 33:56.500\nAnd that that was because...\n\n33:56.500 --> 33:57.500\nYou weren't thinking that.\n\n33:57.500 --> 33:58.500\nI was thinking that.\n\n33:58.500 --> 33:59.500\nOh, okay, sorry.\n\n33:59.500 --> 34:01.500\nThat's what I was really thinking about the time\n\n34:01.500 --> 34:02.500\nwas before robots even was,\n\n34:02.500 --> 34:04.500\noh, I want to do a world about business\n\n34:04.500 --> 34:06.500\nwhere executives actually kill each other.\n\n34:06.500 --> 34:09.500\nAnd so that title, the idea that would always be called that title,\n\n34:09.500 --> 34:12.500\nand the fact that that title sounds a little silly.\n\n34:12.500 --> 34:15.500\nFrom the very beginning, that was all as designed.\n\n34:15.500 --> 34:19.500\nYou were thinking, it's like naming your movie\n\n34:19.500 --> 34:23.500\nlike Mr. Stretchy or something.\n\n34:23.500 --> 34:25.500\nIt's kind of like supposed to sound childish.\n\n34:25.500 --> 34:27.500\nI used to say it's good.\n\n34:27.500 --> 34:29.500\nI used to say, oh, that's really stupid.\n\n34:29.500 --> 34:30.500\nMeaning that's really good.\n\n34:30.500 --> 34:31.500\nThat's really wonderful.\n\n34:31.500 --> 34:32.500\nFucking love it.\n\n34:32.500 --> 34:33.500\nFucking love it.\n\n34:33.500 --> 34:34.500\nFucking love it.\n\n34:34.500 --> 34:37.500\nThat was my big go-to was, oh, that's kind of stupid.\n\n34:37.500 --> 34:38.500\nLet's do that.\n\n34:38.500 --> 34:41.500\nMonster House.\n\n34:42.500 --> 34:44.500\nThe house is a monster.\n\n34:44.500 --> 34:48.500\nKung Fu Panda.\n\n34:48.500 --> 34:50.500\nBut it did imply another part of this world\n\n34:50.500 --> 34:52.500\nthat also had to support all of that.\n\n34:52.500 --> 34:55.500\nAnd the more difficult part of it was to convince people\n\n34:55.500 --> 34:57.500\nthat it could be funny.\n\n34:57.500 --> 34:59.500\nEverybody wanted it to be straight.\n\n34:59.500 --> 35:02.500\nAnd it was, I always knew it would have impact.\n\n35:02.500 --> 35:04.500\nBut I really had this theory,\n\n35:04.500 --> 35:06.500\nmaybe someone else had had it,\n\n35:06.500 --> 35:08.500\nbut as a young man trying to figure out how to write a screenplay,\n\n35:08.500 --> 35:12.500\nI had this idea that if you had a really, really violent scene\n\n35:12.500 --> 35:15.500\nthat was shocking, and then you told a joke,\n\n35:15.500 --> 35:17.500\neven a bad one afterwards, it would be much funnier.\n\n35:17.500 --> 35:20.500\nAnd that was one of the things that was invested throughout writing.\n\n35:20.500 --> 35:23.500\nWhen I think of the movies, we all love this movie to pieces.\n\n35:23.500 --> 35:27.500\nWe always talk about what are the few, like,\n\n35:27.500 --> 35:30.500\nhandful of just perfect movies that you wouldn't take anything out of\n\n35:30.500 --> 35:31.500\nor add anything to.\n\n35:31.500 --> 35:35.500\nAnd Robocop is for us definitely one of those movies.\n\n35:35.500 --> 35:37.500\nI think it's very sad.\n\n35:37.500 --> 35:40.500\nIt's an incredibly sad film.\n\n35:40.500 --> 35:43.500\nAt the core, it's a really depressing story.\n\n35:43.500 --> 35:45.500\nAnd it's really about how he's...\n\n35:45.500 --> 35:49.500\nI remember I was, I think what you do when you do something the first time\n\n35:49.500 --> 35:52.500\nor what I often hear other people talking about\n\n35:52.500 --> 35:55.500\nis you're kind of making up your own rules for how you do something\n\n35:55.500 --> 35:57.500\nand you have to figure it out yourself.\n\n35:57.500 --> 36:00.500\nAnd that was really, that was me trying to figure out something.\n\n36:00.500 --> 36:01.500\nHow does three acts work?\n\n36:01.500 --> 36:03.500\nHere's the beginning, middle, and the end.\n\n36:03.500 --> 36:04.500\nI mean, boy, you've lost.\n\n36:04.500 --> 36:07.500\nYou wielded the fucking...\n\n36:07.500 --> 36:09.500\nIt's really intimidating\n\n36:09.500 --> 36:10.500\nbecause I actually...\n\n36:10.500 --> 36:12.500\nGod damn it.\n\n36:12.500 --> 36:14.500\nI still haven't...\n\n36:14.500 --> 36:17.500\nI still can't write a decent three act story.\n\n36:17.500 --> 36:25.500\nAnd part of my training was trying to get Sid Field's stuff to work for me\n\n36:25.500 --> 36:30.500\nby deconstructing Robocop and Die Hard really specifically.\n\n36:30.500 --> 36:34.500\nAnd even more so than Die Hard,\n\n36:34.500 --> 36:40.500\nwhich I really fetishize a great deal on this stage.\n\n36:40.500 --> 36:43.500\nRobocop is just...\n\n36:43.500 --> 36:48.500\nIt's uncanny the structural integrity of that story.\n\n36:48.500 --> 36:51.500\nCan I ask a bunch of questions here, please?\n\n36:51.500 --> 36:54.500\nOkay, so...\n\n36:54.500 --> 36:56.500\nWhat's it like to kiss a girl?\n\n36:56.500 --> 36:58.500\nShut up. Just shut up.\n\n36:58.500 --> 37:01.500\nJust shut your mouth.\n\n37:01.500 --> 37:02.500\nDon't listen to him.\n\n37:02.500 --> 37:03.500\nIt wasn't me.\n\n37:03.500 --> 37:05.500\nShut up.\n\n37:05.500 --> 37:09.500\nSo how many drafts of this?\n\n37:09.500 --> 37:13.500\nI mean, you wrote it, you unspec,\n\n37:13.500 --> 37:16.500\ndid you do multiple drafts before you started handing it around?\n\n37:16.500 --> 37:21.500\nDid you start doing multiple drafts when John Davidson and Paul Verhoeven got involved?\n\n37:21.500 --> 37:25.500\nI have a partner on this, so let me get to that.\n\n37:25.500 --> 37:31.500\nSo the way it worked was I was sort of a semi-miserable junior executive at Universal,\n\n37:31.500 --> 37:34.500\nand I was trying to meet people that were interesting to me.\n\n37:34.500 --> 37:39.500\nSo I actually put the word out to UCLA film schools, particularly because I'd been there,\n\n37:39.500 --> 37:42.500\nthat anybody who wanted to come in and talk to me could.\n\n37:42.500 --> 37:46.500\nAnd so all these people who didn't pay any attention to me before came to see me,\n\n37:46.500 --> 37:50.500\namong the Michael Miner, who was seven years older than I was,\n\n37:50.500 --> 37:53.500\nand he was kind of a star at UCLA.\n\n37:53.500 --> 37:56.500\nHe made a movie and he had been a DP,\n\n37:56.500 --> 37:59.500\nand he said, what do you want to do?\n\n37:59.500 --> 38:02.500\nWell, I'm working on this movie about a robot, and I told him,\n\n38:02.500 --> 38:05.500\nit's called Robocop, and it's about a robot, and I told him the story,\n\n38:05.500 --> 38:07.500\nand he was like, oh, let's do that.\n\n38:07.500 --> 38:09.500\nAnd I didn't really have anything much better on.\n\n38:09.500 --> 38:11.500\nI had slowed down a little bit with it.\n\n38:11.500 --> 38:13.500\nIt was taking me about a year since I had done it.\n\n38:13.500 --> 38:17.500\nSo I said, OK, why don't we write a script together?\n\n38:17.500 --> 38:23.500\nAnd I had it fairly well outlined the first act, as it is now, more or less.\n\n38:23.500 --> 38:27.500\nAnd the ending was there, and the middle was a little bit more of a mess.\n\n38:27.500 --> 38:32.500\nAnd the first thing I did was I kind of wanted to write the first act on my own.\n\n38:32.500 --> 38:34.500\nI didn't want to hurt Michael's feelings, but I didn't know him that well yet,\n\n38:34.500 --> 38:36.500\nand I wanted to make sure I was getting it.\n\n38:36.500 --> 38:43.500\nAnd so I told my bosses at Universal that my grandfather had died.\n\n38:43.500 --> 38:45.500\nHe had died a long time ago.\n\n38:45.500 --> 38:46.500\nSo it wasn't a lie.\n\n38:46.500 --> 38:47.500\nHe died in World War II.\n\n38:47.500 --> 38:50.500\nI had to go, and I went back to San Enselmo where I grew up,\n\n38:50.500 --> 38:53.500\nand a friend had left me their house to work on,\n\n38:53.500 --> 38:57.500\nand I wrote the first act in about two weeks.\n\n38:57.500 --> 39:01.500\nAnd during that time, they sent me flowers, which I felt really bad about.\n\n39:01.500 --> 39:05.500\nAnd when I came back, I had to go back to work, and I stopped working.\n\n39:05.500 --> 39:07.500\nAnd then we kind of finished it on nights and weekends,\n\n39:07.500 --> 39:09.500\nbut the first act sort of set the tone.\n\n39:09.500 --> 39:14.500\nAnd then we had a really rough draft, and we gave it to some friends.\n\n39:14.500 --> 39:17.500\nAnd I gave it to, I had made friends who knew a guy named John Davison,\n\n39:17.500 --> 39:20.500\nwho had done Airplane, and I had heard about him.\n\n39:20.500 --> 39:23.500\nJohn Davison was a particular character, had a particular way of speaking,\n\n39:23.500 --> 39:25.500\nand everybody would imitate the way he talked.\n\n39:25.500 --> 39:28.500\nAnd I could even kind of talk like him before I met him.\n\n39:28.500 --> 39:32.500\nBut when I had the script, I gave it to a friend of his,\n\n39:32.500 --> 39:36.500\na director named Jonathan Kaplan, that a friend of a friend knew,\n\n39:36.500 --> 39:38.500\nhoping that he would give it to John Davison.\n\n39:38.500 --> 39:40.500\nAnd he did give it to John Davison.\n\n39:40.500 --> 39:42.500\nHe said John Davison would be perfect for this.\n\n39:42.500 --> 39:45.500\nAnd it was sort of amazing because John Davison was perfect for it,\n\n39:45.500 --> 39:46.500\nfor a whole bunch of reasons.\n\n39:46.500 --> 39:48.500\nWait, wait, he did Airplane.\n\n39:48.500 --> 39:49.500\nHe did Airplane?\n\n39:49.500 --> 39:51.500\nThat seems like a weird fit.\n\n39:51.500 --> 39:53.500\nWell, except it was funny.\n\n39:53.500 --> 39:55.500\nAnd I wanted this to be funny.\n\n39:55.500 --> 39:56.500\nSo I think that was helpful.\n\n39:56.500 --> 39:58.500\nOther people read it, and they thought it was serious,\n\n39:58.500 --> 39:59.500\nand they thought it should be serious.\n\n39:59.500 --> 40:00.500\nHe was the only one who said,\n\n40:00.500 --> 40:02.500\nah, this could be funny, you know?\n\n40:02.500 --> 40:04.500\nAnd he had the cash, he had proven that...\n\n40:04.500 --> 40:06.500\nWell, he had a deal with Orion.\n\n40:06.500 --> 40:09.500\nHe was a really, he is a very, a penurious producer.\n\n40:09.500 --> 40:11.500\nHe makes everything as cheap as he can.\n\n40:11.500 --> 40:12.500\nPenurious.\n\n40:12.500 --> 40:13.500\nPenurious.\n\n40:13.500 --> 40:15.500\nThat's a new word for me.\n\n40:15.500 --> 40:17.500\nNot a new word for any of those languages.\n\n40:17.500 --> 40:20.500\nI just the first time I've ever heard that word.\n\n40:20.500 --> 40:21.500\nHe's not just a writer.\n\n40:21.500 --> 40:23.500\nHe makes up words all the time.\n\n40:23.500 --> 40:27.500\nAt what point did the prime directives like start coming in?\n\n40:27.500 --> 40:32.500\nBecause I want to talk about the ending at one point, because...\n\n40:32.500 --> 40:33.500\nWell, how about later?\n\n40:33.500 --> 40:35.500\nIt's an ending.\n\n40:35.500 --> 40:36.500\nThat's why he says later.\n\n40:36.500 --> 40:38.500\nHere's what, I'll pitch you what I want to talk about.\n\n40:38.500 --> 40:40.500\nYou can tell us who's a better...\n\n40:42.500 --> 40:46.500\nWell, I'm so curious about now the Verhoeven entering this picture,\n\n40:46.500 --> 40:49.500\nbecause I'm picturing the producers and it's springtime for Hitler.\n\n40:49.500 --> 40:54.500\nVerhoeven character enters the story.\n\n40:54.500 --> 40:56.500\nLet me fast forward to this.\n\n40:56.500 --> 40:58.500\nWe get set up.\n\n40:58.500 --> 41:04.500\nWe get a deal at Orion, which is a big deal for people who have never done anything before.\n\n41:04.500 --> 41:08.500\nWe go over there and they give us some notes.\n\n41:08.500 --> 41:14.500\nOne of the notes was somehow the bad guy Clarence and the guy at the top, Dick Jones,\n\n41:14.500 --> 41:16.500\nshould be somehow joined.\n\n41:16.500 --> 41:18.500\nThat was the only real work we took from them.\n\n41:18.500 --> 41:19.500\nThat's a good note.\n\n41:19.500 --> 41:20.500\nIt was a good note.\n\n41:20.500 --> 41:22.500\nAnd so we wrote a second draft.\n\n41:22.500 --> 41:26.500\nAnd midway through the draft, I turned to Michael and I said,\n\n41:26.500 --> 41:28.500\nMichael, this can be funny.\n\n41:28.500 --> 41:30.500\nIt's okay if it's funny.\n\n41:30.500 --> 41:33.500\nAnd we started having fun writing a script.\n\n41:33.500 --> 41:36.500\nNow, that has never happened to me since and hadn't happened to me before.\n\n41:36.500 --> 41:39.500\nBut it was fun for about two weeks.\n\n41:39.500 --> 41:43.500\nAnd we laughed and we made jokes and we couldn't believe how entertaining we were.\n\n41:43.500 --> 41:45.500\nAnd we wrote it pretty well.\n\n41:45.500 --> 41:50.500\nIs that where the absurd elements, I'd buy that for a dollar, runner, or is that?\n\n41:50.500 --> 41:54.500\nI'd have to look and see.\n\n41:54.500 --> 41:56.500\nI'd buy that for a dollar.\n\n41:56.500 --> 42:00.500\nI had spent some time at Paramount around all the Gary Marshall sitcoms.\n\n42:00.500 --> 42:04.500\nSo that was my attempt at coming up with a tagline for a...\n\n42:04.500 --> 42:08.500\nBy the way, when your system is shocked, and we all know this from writing a roller coaster,\n\n42:08.500 --> 42:14.500\nI mean, not only are you having this weird, like, why am I laughing? I'm terrified.\n\n42:14.500 --> 42:19.500\nSo we're already familiar with, like, you can get a good laugh out of somebody who's scared shitless\n\n42:19.500 --> 42:21.500\nor upset just like...\n\n42:21.500 --> 42:22.500\nYeah, it's a pressure release.\n\n42:22.500 --> 42:24.500\nTraumatized, absolutely.\n\n42:24.500 --> 42:29.500\nBut it also occurs to me that it works the opposite way, too.\n\n42:29.500 --> 42:35.500\nThe villains in Robocop are especially traumatizing.\n\n42:35.500 --> 42:41.500\nAnd therefore, you're very immersed in Peter Weller's character, Murphy, who becomes Robocop.\n\n42:41.500 --> 42:51.500\nLike, his conduit to becoming Robocop is a horrible, violent trend.\n\n42:51.500 --> 42:57.500\nAnd it's absolutely more horrific because these guys are goofballs.\n\n42:57.500 --> 43:00.500\nThey fancy themselves real cut-ups.\n\n43:00.500 --> 43:11.500\nAnd their leader, played by Kirkwood Smith, is like, I had never seen a receding hairline guy\n\n43:11.500 --> 43:16.500\nwith glasses playing a villain in an action movie.\n\n43:16.500 --> 43:21.500\nThat counted as diversity back then.\n\n43:21.500 --> 43:27.500\nBecause he looked like he should be giving James Bond his weapons in a lab, and he's the big bad.\n\n43:27.500 --> 43:35.500\nHe was so effective, the sway he held over his minions, the way they interacted with each other,\n\n43:35.500 --> 43:41.500\nthe fact that they watched television and enjoyed it, that they went in and out of being grody.\n\n43:41.500 --> 43:43.500\nIt was just, you felt...\n\n43:43.500 --> 43:45.500\nHe taught Bobby how to fly?\n\n43:45.500 --> 43:46.500\nYou felt so...\n\n43:46.500 --> 43:48.500\nWell, that's an example.\n\n43:48.500 --> 43:53.500\nYeah, I mean, he's not gonna slow his adrenaline junkiness down.\n\n43:53.500 --> 43:59.500\nHe's throwing one of his minions, the thing, but it was just like, you're watching Peter Weller go into that warehouse,\n\n43:59.500 --> 44:03.500\nand if you're watching this movie a sixth, seventh, eight hundredth time,\n\n44:03.500 --> 44:15.500\nyou're now realizing that this first act has been so cold riveted tightly that the corporate story has been mentioning offhand.\n\n44:15.500 --> 44:18.500\nYes, we've been relocating candidates according to risk factor,\n\n44:18.500 --> 44:24.500\nand that you're going like, oh, God, and Peter Weller was available...\n\n44:24.500 --> 44:26.500\nMurphy was available for that job.\n\n44:26.500 --> 44:29.500\nHe was a candidate that was relocated according to risk factor.\n\n44:29.500 --> 44:30.500\nWhy?\n\n44:30.500 --> 44:33.500\nBecause his kid loves TJ Laser.\n\n44:33.500 --> 44:34.500\nHe wants to...\n\n44:34.500 --> 44:38.500\nNancy Allen asks him, what are you doing with your gun?\n\n44:38.500 --> 44:42.500\nHe's like, well, I just want to learn this thing.\n\n44:42.500 --> 44:45.500\nSo is that the desire of the character to be a good cop?\n\n44:45.500 --> 44:46.500\nYeah.\n\n44:46.500 --> 44:47.500\nI think it is, actually.\n\n44:47.500 --> 44:48.500\nTo be a cowboy.\n\n44:48.500 --> 44:52.500\nI was looking at your story cycle, and I thought, oh, the scene where he says,\n\n44:52.500 --> 44:56.500\nmy kid wants me to be a good cop, and all good cops do that.\n\n44:56.500 --> 44:57.500\nHe has...\n\n44:57.500 --> 45:02.500\nWe're going to find out through ghostly flashbacks as this character that we become is trapped in this metal cage,\n\n45:02.500 --> 45:06.500\nbut we'll find out that he actually had an idyllic life.\n\n45:06.500 --> 45:11.500\nWe can only speculate that it wasn't enough for him for what reason.\n\n45:11.500 --> 45:17.500\nGod, the best reason of all, not because he was tired of fucking his beautiful wife, not because he wished he had more money,\n\n45:17.500 --> 45:21.500\nbecause he felt like maybe he was failing as a dad.\n\n45:21.500 --> 45:25.500\nAnd I would say the subtext there was like, you're seeing the flashbacks.\n\n45:25.500 --> 45:26.500\nThe kid is watching television.\n\n45:26.500 --> 45:28.500\nHe's watching TJ Laser.\n\n45:28.500 --> 45:33.500\nThese days, what that would be is the kid was so absorbed in his iPad,\n\n45:33.500 --> 45:39.500\nor he was literally jacked into some video game, and it was like, how can I reach this kid?\n\n45:39.500 --> 45:43.500\nI want to become a bigger-than-life thing.\n\n45:43.500 --> 45:48.500\nI want this kid to understand that law enforcement can be heroic,\n\n45:48.500 --> 45:53.500\nwhich is absolutely the opposite realization that this world is going through.\n\n45:53.500 --> 46:00.500\nThey're having their first police strike following the purchase of the police at the hands of a consumer electronics company.\n\n46:00.500 --> 46:03.500\nAnd so the cops are having this...\n\n46:03.500 --> 46:05.500\nThere's just so many goddamn details.\n\n46:05.500 --> 46:07.500\nI just went off on this weird off-road thing.\n\n46:07.500 --> 46:10.500\nBut yeah, I mean, I do. It's funny that you're asking.\n\n46:10.500 --> 46:16.500\nAnd that's another thing that I think is so amazing about the job is that you can ask questions like that,\n\n46:16.500 --> 46:22.500\neven though you wrote the goddamn script, because how much of the...\n\n46:22.500 --> 46:24.500\nThis job is about channeling, isn't it?\n\n46:24.500 --> 46:28.500\nIt's not clear how much you can know and how much just comes in somehow.\n\n46:28.500 --> 46:31.500\nIt's really amazing when it happens, and it's not reliable.\n\n46:31.500 --> 46:36.500\nI truly believe that these things are out there, and that when we're doing our best,\n\n46:36.500 --> 46:39.500\nwe're doing the opposite of proving that we're good at what we do.\n\n46:39.500 --> 46:48.500\nWe're actually only able to untighten some sphincter in us just enough to accidentally let something noble.\n\n46:48.500 --> 46:51.500\nThat just needs an antenna.\n\n46:51.500 --> 46:53.500\nI don't know if we were trying to do anything noble,\n\n46:53.500 --> 46:58.500\nbut it was like just pursuing the things you were interested in and really saying,\n\n46:58.500 --> 47:00.500\nwell, there were all sorts of things that...\n\n47:00.500 --> 47:07.500\nLike, Ed 209, when I sat down with Phil Tippett, we started looking at certain kind of Japanese things,\n\n47:07.500 --> 47:12.500\nand then I said, yeah, but what this is really about, Phil, is it's really like, it's kind of the Vietnam War.\n\n47:12.500 --> 47:17.500\nThis is a Huey helicopter, and this guy, Dr. McNamara, is there, and it's...\n\n47:17.500 --> 47:20.500\nI didn't push that there, but I was always in the background there,\n\n47:20.500 --> 47:23.500\nand then when you look at it, you realize, oh, that is kind of like a helicopter.\n\n47:23.500 --> 47:24.500\nThat is kind of like that.\n\n47:24.500 --> 47:27.500\nAnd with Rabotin, who did the suit, we talked...\n\n47:27.500 --> 47:28.500\nSo fucking cool.\n\n47:28.500 --> 47:30.500\nAnd Rabotin is a great artist.\n\n47:30.500 --> 47:31.500\nSo fucking cool.\n\n47:31.500 --> 47:32.500\nI mean, these are...\n\n47:32.500 --> 47:35.500\nHe had him, Phil Tippett, I mean, Jesus.\n\n47:35.500 --> 47:38.500\nAnd he said, and one day, many years later, I said, you know,\n\n47:38.500 --> 47:40.500\nit's really interesting because it's all about Detroit.\n\n47:40.500 --> 47:41.500\nAnd what I...\n\n47:41.500 --> 47:46.500\nThe book I had read kind of as research for this was a book called The Reckoning by David Halberstam,\n\n47:46.500 --> 47:51.500\nall about how Detroit and Nissan had gone to war and Detroit had lost.\n\n47:51.500 --> 47:54.500\nAnd it was about the decline of the American car.\n\n47:54.500 --> 47:57.500\nAnd that was like what I was writing about with the decline of corporate stuff.\n\n47:57.500 --> 47:59.500\nI was a kid who liked cars.\n\n47:59.500 --> 48:01.500\nAnd this was the meaning of it.\n\n48:01.500 --> 48:02.500\nAnd when you look at...\n\n48:02.500 --> 48:07.500\nOne day I said to Rabotin, I said, it really looks like a truck, man.\n\n48:07.500 --> 48:09.500\nIt looks like a ram truck or something like it.\n\n48:09.500 --> 48:10.500\nIt looks like American road iron.\n\n48:10.500 --> 48:12.500\nAnd Rabotin was like, oh, I like that.\n\n48:12.500 --> 48:13.500\nBut I think it really did.\n\n48:13.500 --> 48:16.500\nI think he channeled that because it looks like a car in a weird way.\n\n48:16.500 --> 48:17.500\nWhen you look at the design...\n\n48:17.500 --> 48:19.500\nAnd they end up at an abandoned steel mill.\n\n48:19.500 --> 48:21.500\nI mean, it's where he has to go.\n\n48:21.500 --> 48:24.500\nIt's where metal is made and unmade.\n\n48:24.500 --> 48:27.500\nNo, it's all about the rust belt. And that's why it was Detroit.\n\n48:27.500 --> 48:29.500\nAnd that's why it was this kind of thing.\n\n48:29.500 --> 48:31.500\nAnd I remember the line producer saying, well, come on.\n\n48:31.500 --> 48:32.500\nWe can shoot it.\n\n48:32.500 --> 48:34.500\nAnd Los Angeles can go home at night.\n\n48:34.500 --> 48:38.500\nBut somehow going to Pittsburgh to this horrible little...\n\n48:38.500 --> 48:41.500\nThis awful place where the town had fallen apart\n\n48:41.500 --> 48:44.500\naround this old steel mill that was haunted.\n\n48:44.500 --> 48:45.500\nAnd backstage...\n\n48:45.500 --> 48:46.500\nFun fact, we established that.\n\n48:46.500 --> 48:48.500\nIt's Ed 209 and his name is also Ed.\n\n48:48.500 --> 48:49.500\nSo he threw that one in there.\n\n48:49.500 --> 48:51.500\nI love that.\n\n48:51.500 --> 48:56.500\nIf I could show you a tally of the number of times in 20 years\n\n48:56.500 --> 48:59.500\nthat in the most important of conversations that I've had,\n\n48:59.500 --> 49:02.500\nand it's important to me relative to what I was working on,\n\n49:02.500 --> 49:05.500\nhow important it was for me to try to communicate something,\n\n49:05.500 --> 49:10.500\nthe number of times that I have referenced story points in Robocop\n\n49:10.500 --> 49:13.500\nso that I could achieve some kind of vocabulary with whoever I'm talking to,\n\n49:13.500 --> 49:15.500\nwhether or not they'd seen the movie.\n\n49:15.500 --> 49:18.500\nBecause honestly, as long as I know what I'm talking about,\n\n49:18.500 --> 49:21.500\nthen maybe I have a chance of explaining to this other person.\n\n49:21.500 --> 49:27.500\nOtherwise, I'm just babbling this like paste of fucking like...\n\n49:27.500 --> 49:29.500\nNon-connected references.\n\n49:29.500 --> 49:34.500\nBut for me to be able to dive into a story that is so well constructed\n\n49:34.500 --> 49:38.500\nthat I can also then later when I'm talking to the same person go,\n\n49:38.500 --> 49:40.500\nremember that thing I keep referencing Robocop?\n\n49:40.500 --> 49:42.500\nWell, now we're talking about this part of the story.\n\n49:42.500 --> 49:44.500\nSo again, I'm going to reference that.\n\n49:44.500 --> 49:46.500\nNow you already know what I explain to you.\n\n49:46.500 --> 49:53.500\nEvery threshold, the atonement with the father being so literal,\n\n49:53.500 --> 49:57.500\nit's amazing that that was a note that a suit gave that was like,\n\n49:57.500 --> 49:59.500\neh, and it's such a...\n\n49:59.500 --> 50:02.500\nFrom the mouths of babes or capitalists,\n\n50:02.500 --> 50:06.500\nit's just sort of like, I'd like to see both bad guys be cousins.\n\n50:06.500 --> 50:09.500\nIt's kind of a shrug like, yeah, it'd be easier to follow about.\n\n50:09.500 --> 50:11.500\nBut it's like, I had heard like,\n\n50:11.500 --> 50:16.500\nBrillstein or Gray or somebody like when Bob and David pitched Mr. Show,\n\n50:16.500 --> 50:19.500\nthey were like, it should be Mr. Show with Bob and David.\n\n50:19.500 --> 50:21.500\nOtherwise, people like people.\n\n50:21.500 --> 50:26.500\nBut it was sort of like, you guys should come out and introduce the show.\n\n50:26.500 --> 50:29.500\nAnd then at the time, I think they thought that was such a ridiculous\n\n50:29.500 --> 50:31.500\nlike baby boomerang note.\n\n50:31.500 --> 50:36.500\nBut I mean, it's like, god damn, what a great note.\n\n50:36.500 --> 50:43.500\nBut you could take a stopwatch\n\n50:43.500 --> 50:49.500\nand you could take a circle and break the 360 degrees down\n\n50:49.500 --> 50:52.500\nso that every second meant how many pages or whatever.\n\n50:52.500 --> 50:55.500\nAnd you could go around that movie\n\n50:55.500 --> 51:01.500\nand kaboom the moment when Joseph Campbell, who has never met you\n\n51:01.500 --> 51:07.500\nand who didn't even like movies, is talking about the importance\n\n51:07.500 --> 51:11.500\nof this sort of like going to meet your maker\n\n51:11.500 --> 51:18.500\nand how the extent to which you are still driven by fear\n\n51:18.500 --> 51:23.500\nis the extent to which the ogre aspect of the father will present itself\n\n51:23.500 --> 51:28.500\nand be impenetrable and only through just this cosmic pummeling\n\n51:28.500 --> 51:33.500\nby that maker's hand are you ever going to atone and become your own maker\n\n51:33.500 --> 51:36.500\nand realize I kicked my own ass back there.\n\n51:36.500 --> 51:43.500\nRobocop has rounded up his road of friles of bad guys.\n\n51:43.500 --> 51:50.500\nLike Clint Eastwood character, he's haunted by these visions of people\n\n51:50.500 --> 51:52.500\nwho killed his human counterpart.\n\n51:52.500 --> 51:55.500\nAnd he's going and knocking them off one by one.\n\n51:55.500 --> 51:56.500\nJust full of dollars.\n\n51:56.500 --> 52:01.500\nAnd then the trail leads to the Clarence Bonnaker,\n\n52:01.500 --> 52:05.500\nI believe probably right at the fucking meeting with the goddess point\n\n52:05.500 --> 52:07.500\nis like it's Dick Jones.\n\n52:07.500 --> 52:12.500\nDick Jones runs OCP, OCP runs the cops, you're a cop.\n\n52:12.500 --> 52:14.500\nHe just lays it out.\n\n52:14.500 --> 52:16.500\nBut that's a lovely line, isn't it?\n\n52:16.500 --> 52:17.500\nIt's fantastic.\n\n52:17.500 --> 52:19.500\nAll of your lines are lovely.\n\n52:19.500 --> 52:23.500\nThey're all really like kind of hyper attenuated B movie lines.\n\n52:23.500 --> 52:29.500\nAnd you understand that because another thing is another thing that makes you a hero.\n\n52:29.500 --> 52:35.500\nYou're the only audio commentary that I've ever listened all the way through on a DVD.\n\n52:35.500 --> 52:40.500\nAnd I was just sucked in because you were so,\n\n52:40.500 --> 52:47.500\nit was like all of a sudden you're just listening to a guy that understands Robocop.\n\n52:47.500 --> 52:48.500\nAnd he wrote it.\n\n52:48.500 --> 52:50.500\nIt's just not, you know how it is.\n\n52:50.500 --> 52:53.500\nYou meet people who worked on such and such and you want to have,\n\n52:53.500 --> 52:56.500\nyou ask them one question and then the very first answer is sort of like,\n\n52:56.500 --> 52:58.500\noh, okay.\n\n52:58.500 --> 53:00.500\nYou become disillusioned.\n\n53:00.500 --> 53:07.500\nIt's a prismatic kind of spraying of your mythologization of something into a realization\n\n53:07.500 --> 53:10.500\nthat everything's a fluke and it was just sort of like a bunch of random stuff.\n\n53:10.500 --> 53:14.500\nTo hear a writer on an audio commentary,\n\n53:14.500 --> 53:20.500\njust you're so unabashed.\n\n53:20.500 --> 53:24.500\nThere's a point when Nancy Wilson's character, Nancy Allen,\n\n53:24.500 --> 53:30.500\nNancy Allen's character is being introduced and you're describing the importance of Peter Weller watching her\n\n53:30.500 --> 53:36.500\nand that she kicks somebody's ass and that she takes off her helmet and then she like throws it to somebody\n\n53:36.500 --> 53:43.500\nand then like, and then you're just talking and talking about the importance of these characters\n\n53:43.500 --> 53:48.500\nand things and then you say something like you're like,\n\n53:48.500 --> 53:52.500\nand then that's why it was important for me that Murphy had a line\n\n53:52.500 --> 53:56.500\nand it's coming up right here and I'll loop it for you,\n\n53:56.500 --> 53:58.500\ncool stuff or whatever his line is.\n\n53:58.500 --> 54:02.500\nIt was an ad lib that Peter did where he looks at her and goes,\n\n54:02.500 --> 54:03.500\npretty neat.\n\n54:03.500 --> 54:04.500\nNow he's probably right.\n\n54:04.500 --> 54:06.500\nHe probably needed a line there that I didn't give him,\n\n54:06.500 --> 54:08.500\nbut I always thought, again, as a young arrogant writer,\n\n54:08.500 --> 54:10.500\nI thought, oh, that's a stupid line.\n\n54:10.500 --> 54:13.500\nI was being mean by following it there.\n\n54:13.500 --> 54:20.500\nBut if you've ever seen a commentary where the person that's talking is so in sync with what you're watching\n\n54:20.500 --> 54:23.500\nthat they actually just bother to recreationally like,\n\n54:23.500 --> 54:27.500\ndub the lips of the person as they do a line,\n\n54:27.500 --> 54:30.500\nand that's when it came up with the Hasta la vista, baby anyway.\n\n54:30.500 --> 54:32.500\nIt's just so satisfying.\n\n54:32.500 --> 54:33.500\nIt's what you dream of as a consumer.\n\n54:33.500 --> 54:36.500\nIt's because I wrote all the Foley and all the background dialogue and everything\n\n54:36.500 --> 54:37.500\nand was in for the recording.\n\n54:37.500 --> 54:39.500\nOh, sorry.\n\n54:39.500 --> 54:42.500\nThat's another 40 pages of writing.\n\n54:42.500 --> 54:44.500\nSchrab's turn.\n\n54:44.500 --> 54:45.500\nOK, Schrab Corner.\n\n54:45.500 --> 54:49.500\nLet me ask you these fucking questions about the goddamn shape of the hat.\n\n54:49.500 --> 54:55.500\nSo anyway, was the Prime Directive stuff, was that always from the first draft?\n\n54:55.500 --> 54:57.500\nThere were always Prime Directives.\n\n54:57.500 --> 55:00.500\nAnd I don't remember what they were in the first draft,\n\n55:00.500 --> 55:02.500\nbut there was always a Prime Directive.\n\n55:02.500 --> 55:04.500\nAnd then we sat down with a guy named Forrest Ackerman.\n\n55:04.500 --> 55:07.500\nThis is why John Davison was such a great guy.\n\n55:07.500 --> 55:09.500\nHe said, I want you to meet this guy.\n\n55:09.500 --> 55:11.500\nAnd this old guy in a trench coat comes to sit in his John's office and he says,\n\n55:11.500 --> 55:12.500\nHe's the famous monster.\n\n55:12.500 --> 55:13.500\nI read your script.\n\n55:13.500 --> 55:15.500\nYeah, I didn't even realize how famous he was.\n\n55:15.500 --> 55:16.500\nI read your script.\n\n55:16.500 --> 55:20.500\nAnd well, you know, Asimov said there should be three rules of robotics.\n\n55:20.500 --> 55:22.500\nSo you should have three.\n\n55:22.500 --> 55:24.500\nSo it became three.\n\n55:24.500 --> 55:27.500\nAnd one of them, literally, we were at lunch one day,\n\n55:27.500 --> 55:29.500\nand there was a fortune cookie that said,\n\n55:29.500 --> 55:30.500\nyou serve the public trust.\n\n55:30.500 --> 55:32.500\nAnd I went, God, no.\n\n55:32.500 --> 55:37.500\nAnd there was always the forth-classified one.\n\n55:37.500 --> 55:38.500\nWell, hey, hey.\n\n55:38.500 --> 55:39.500\nI got it.\n\n55:39.500 --> 55:41.500\nThe fortune cookie wrote your movie.\n\n55:41.500 --> 55:42.500\nThe Prime Directive.\n\n55:42.500 --> 55:46.500\nThat is such a brilliant thing because it is like Asimov,\n\n55:46.500 --> 55:48.500\nand it's a robot movie.\n\n55:48.500 --> 55:50.500\nSo you're going, oh, OK, so we have to do this.\n\n55:50.500 --> 55:53.500\nBut it comes up a couple of times.\n\n55:53.500 --> 55:55.500\nIt comes up, I believe, three times in the film.\n\n55:55.500 --> 56:00.500\nAnd then finally, the fucking home run of an ending.\n\n56:00.500 --> 56:05.500\nRobocop is off the top of my head.\n\n56:05.500 --> 56:09.500\nThe three best endings, I think, of all time are like Star Wars.\n\n56:09.500 --> 56:14.500\nRobocop and Get Out was like, it's like you're taking your character\n\n56:14.500 --> 56:19.500\nat the lowest point and then making him go to the highest point.\n\n56:19.500 --> 56:22.500\nAnd the quicker you can do that, the more likely\n\n56:22.500 --> 56:25.500\nyou're going to get a standing ovation, which is what I did\n\n56:25.500 --> 56:27.500\nwhen he said, Dick, you're fired.\n\n56:27.500 --> 56:30.500\nThe first time I saw it in 87, I stood up in the theater\n\n56:30.500 --> 56:32.500\nand went, fucking yeah.\n\n56:32.500 --> 56:35.500\nAnd then as the credits are rolling, I said, we're going back\n\n56:35.500 --> 56:37.500\ntomorrow to see this movie.\n\n56:37.500 --> 56:39.500\nThis is the best movie ever because it's so...\n\n56:39.500 --> 56:42.500\nThere's something really, really satisfying about the violence at the end.\n\n56:42.500 --> 56:44.500\nYou must have been when you were done typing that one.\n\n56:44.500 --> 56:45.500\nOh, shit.\n\n56:45.500 --> 56:46.500\nLet's find some...\n\n56:46.500 --> 56:48.500\nOh, my fingers are smoking.\n\n56:48.500 --> 56:49.500\nOh, my God.\n\n56:49.500 --> 56:50.500\nNo.\n\n56:50.500 --> 56:55.500\nYou had your shirt off like Hugh Jackman and Swordfish.\n\n56:55.500 --> 56:56.500\nHoly shit.\n\n56:56.500 --> 57:03.500\nYou went to Barbara's place and made two women leave the typewriters.\n\n57:03.500 --> 57:09.500\nBecause at the end of the second act, he gets his ass kicked by Ed 209\n\n57:09.500 --> 57:13.500\nbecause he can't arrest Ronnie Cox.\n\n57:13.500 --> 57:15.500\nBecause the world is run by money.\n\n57:15.500 --> 57:16.500\nHe can't do anything.\n\n57:16.500 --> 57:21.500\nHe's totally blocked and then he goes up and he goes up anyway.\n\n57:21.500 --> 57:24.500\nHe's like, I'm going to get my ass kicked again,\n\n57:24.500 --> 57:31.500\nbut he tells the guy's boss, I can't arrest this guy because he works for you.\n\n57:31.500 --> 57:35.500\nAnd he goes, dick, you're fired and then fucking kills him.\n\n57:35.500 --> 57:36.500\nAnd it's the best.\n\n57:36.500 --> 57:38.500\nIt's so fucking good.\n\n57:38.500 --> 57:43.500\nBut the roar in 1987 was when he said Murphy, which is what's fascinating to me.\n\n57:43.500 --> 57:45.500\nIt's a real, like, where did that come from?\n\n57:45.500 --> 57:48.500\nAnd the audience really identifies with that moment.\n\n57:48.500 --> 57:54.500\nWell, a little segue, but we can go back to talking about Robocop all night,\n\n57:54.500 --> 57:58.500\nbut I do think it's such a weird opportunity your career represents\n\n57:58.500 --> 58:02.500\nbecause 10 years apart from each other, you write this amazing film.\n\n58:02.500 --> 58:05.500\nIt's directed by this guy who just, it works perfectly.\n\n58:05.500 --> 58:09.500\nThe chemistry between writer and director clearly are just, it just creates this thing.\n\n58:09.500 --> 58:14.500\nAnd all of the collaborators playing their parts.\n\n58:14.500 --> 58:18.500\nTo have the same writer and director 10 years later work together again.\n\n58:18.500 --> 58:24.500\nAnd to have them be unmistakably doing the thing that they were doing in the other movie.\n\n58:24.500 --> 58:30.500\nI went to see Starship Troopers, incredibly excited, more grown up now.\n\n58:30.500 --> 58:35.500\nHaving spent 10 years like asking myself, why do I love Robocop?\n\n58:35.500 --> 58:39.500\nAnd learning your name, learning that there's a thing called screenplays and all these things.\n\n58:39.500 --> 58:41.500\nAnd I go to see Starship Troopers.\n\n58:41.500 --> 58:47.500\nAnd while I'm unmistakably riveted by all of these details, all of this tone,\n\n58:47.500 --> 58:49.500\nthere's something missing for me.\n\n58:49.500 --> 59:00.500\nAnd I walked out going like, oh, did I misunderstand Robocop's message?\n\n59:00.500 --> 59:08.500\nDid Robocop actually, was Robocop not rooting for humanity?\n\n59:08.500 --> 59:13.500\nWhat's happening here? There was as much irony and cynicism to Starship Troopers.\n\n59:13.500 --> 59:19.500\nBut I think maybe because it was a war movie and not this movie about this guy, Murphy, the cowboy.\n\n59:19.500 --> 59:21.500\nThe subjective experience.\n\n59:21.500 --> 59:26.500\nMacbeth, Hamlet, Shane, just a dude.\n\n59:26.500 --> 59:28.500\nOne movie's a gunfighter. It's about a gunfighter.\n\n59:28.500 --> 59:31.500\nAnd I think Americans...\n\n59:31.500 --> 59:34.500\nThe other movie comes out of a different genre.\n\n59:34.500 --> 59:39.500\nIt comes out of the movies that were made during World War II to make you go fight.\n\n59:39.500 --> 59:46.500\nAnd there are movies like Air Force by Howard Hawks and Action in the North Atlantic by Edward Dimitriak or something like that.\n\n59:46.500 --> 59:48.500\nAnd they all have this similar...\n\n59:48.500 --> 59:50.500\nPropaganda is kind of like...\n\n59:50.500 --> 59:58.500\nTheir propaganda, but they also have a similar structure that they all kind of follow a similar structure in any event.\n\n59:58.500 --> 01:00:02.500\nIt's before the war and there's a bunch of people and then there's a war.\n\n01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:06.500\nAnd then they meet a bunch of other people and they all say they kind of meet different kinds of people.\n\n01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:11.500\nAnd then they train together and then they learn that one day one of them is going to have to die.\n\n01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:13.500\nSomeone's going to have to send someone to die.\n\n01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:17.500\nThe thing about like...\n\n01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:19.500\nSorry to cut you off, Ed.\n\n01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.500\nIt's not his personal story.\n\n01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:28.500\nYeah. The thing about Murphy is we were talking about tone where we can be funny, we can be violent and everything.\n\n01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:32.500\nMurphy doesn't know he's in a comedy.\n\n01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.500\nEverything about it is tragic.\n\n01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:35.500\nHe's taking it seriously.\n\n01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.500\nHe's kind of a nerd.\n\n01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.500\nHe doesn't deserve this.\n\n01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:44.500\nWe feel so bad for him because you don't shy away from the violence when he does get killed.\n\n01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:49.500\nYou don't shy away from the tragedy of his kid and his wife.\n\n01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:53.500\nWhen they're waving and you're backing away from his home and his life.\n\n01:00:53.500 --> 01:01:00.500\nAnd I think that's why the tone works so well is that the tragedy is real.\n\n01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:08.500\nThe relatability is real and everything else is kind of like up to a 11 or 12 or whatever.\n\n01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:09.500\nYeah.\n\n01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:22.500\nWell, I don't think you can discount the power of the trauma of Robocop, the subjective trauma of his true crime worthy experience of being the victim of gang mutilation.\n\n01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:31.500\nThat it's a joke to these sociopaths that he's a cop and he's now in their hands and how much fun they're having torturing him.\n\n01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:41.500\nBefore they finally in a world that clearly has suffered a certain amount of inflation in terms of the amount of bullets a human body can take.\n\n01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:46.500\nEven they spend too much lead killing Dr. Weller.\n\n01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:51.500\nI keep forgetting is Dr. Weller as of 2014 Peter Weller got his doctorate in like Renaissance.\n\n01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:52.500\nI love this history show.\n\n01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.500\nHe was so into like Greece.\n\n01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:57.500\nHe just really kind of boner for like pyramids and stuff like that.\n\n01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:00.500\nSomebody does 70 movies and gets a PhD in something.\n\n01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:02.500\nYou're pretty sure what they got a PhD in.\n\n01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:03.500\nThey're pretty passionate.\n\n01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:08.500\nI want to watch Robocop tell me about, you know, Sumeria all day long.\n\n01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:09.500\nIt's a fucking way.\n\n01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:13.500\nIf I was an actor in 70 movies, my PhD would be in cocaine.\n\n01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.500\nI'd be dead.\n\n01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:21.500\nAnyways, the yeah, I just like I just and maybe maybe it's because I was an adolescent.\n\n01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:26.500\nSo I was like, I was coming into your hands like and God was I lucky.\n\n01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:30.500\nI mean, do you think about just the crap I could have seen while going through puberty.\n\n01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:42.500\nAnd and I walked out of a theater in Milwaukee just to my my I could feel my neurology changed.\n\n01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:50.500\nI it's hard to make another generation understand because you can't even say these days back then there was no internet.\n\n01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:51.500\nThat doesn't make any sense.\n\n01:02:51.500 --> 01:03:00.500\nBut also even even the difference between like a world where like when I Schrab was the first guy to ever show me like a Jackie Chan movie.\n\n01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:01.500\nIt wasn't there.\n\n01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.500\nYou didn't see wire work until the matrix.\n\n01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:08.500\nIt was previous to that was a bootleg VHS thing.\n\n01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:15.500\nYou had to you had to be you had to be looking under rocks to see things that didn't feel like E.T.\n\n01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:27.500\nAnd and to just wander in and for the same movie ticket price have this completely different psychological serum injected into you and a walk out going.\n\n01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:33.500\nWhy was that funny and violent and and why did it love and hate America?\n\n01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:41.500\nWhy why is it OK for me to be simultaneously rooting for humanity and very cynical about the way the world works?\n\n01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:46.500\nLike why why is this movie baptized me into a new religion?\n\n01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:48.500\nI don't how does that work?\n\n01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:49.500\nAre there other movies like this?\n\n01:03:49.500 --> 01:04:01.500\nIt was a lifesaver and just because you you you bristled when I invoked the word nobility when we talk like I for me nobility just means efficacy in our craft.\n\n01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:08.500\nMaybe if we were poets or street musicians or doctors we the big three.\n\n01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:14.500\nYou know maybe nobility would have would have to but I affecting lives even just making people laugh.\n\n01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:17.500\nI don't I don't even mean to it's like oh you changed a little boy's life.\n\n01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:21.500\nI that doesn't have to be the standard just reach.\n\n01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:22.500\nYou know that's what we do.\n\n01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:23.500\nIt's populism.\n\n01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:27.500\nIt's it's it's it's it's no it's noble when the story is powerful.\n\n01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:37.500\nI agree listen I agree with you there's nothing more important than that in what we do that somehow I don't know when you were talking I think sometimes there's movies that really hit us and it depends on how old we are and it depends on the movies.\n\n01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:46.500\nBut you know I feel sometimes I've seen a movie like when I saw Chinatown for the first time in a theater I was a young person and I thought I'd been struck by lightning.\n\n01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:50.500\nChinatown seems like yeah I can imagine seeing Chinatown in adolescence.\n\n01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.500\nChinatown I was completely obsessed with Chinatown.\n\n01:04:52.500 --> 01:05:02.500\nI got I before the Internet before anything before I went out and every time I could I see it and then I would and I got I somehow I met his brother and I got a copy of the script.\n\n01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:08.500\nI read the script and I outlined the script and that was my that was kind of before I wrote Robocop.\n\n01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:10.500\nI had this whole obsession with Chinatown.\n\n01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:11.500\nThat's really interesting.\n\n01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:20.500\nI got the script for Clockwork Orange and sometimes if you look at it you see wow there's a circular structure in Clockwork Orange and there's a circular interesting structure.\n\n01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:26.500\nSo I don't know how that happened but I think it was the things I was interested in were made their way in.\n\n01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:33.500\nIt's interesting to me because Sid Field obsesses about body heat and Chinatown.\n\n01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:40.500\nAnd so that's why partly like I'm like god damn it like what about Robocop?\n\n01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:43.500\nWhat about Die Hard because I'm of a slightly to maybe a half generation.\n\n01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:46.500\nNo Die Hard is also a movie you can't stop watching.\n\n01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.500\nThere's something about it.\n\n01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:54.500\nBut it's funny that you're one of these you're one of these craftsmen between those that you're watching Robert Townes work and you're deconstructing it.\n\n01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:55.500\nYou're learning to program.\n\n01:05:55.500 --> 01:06:01.500\nYou're you're you're you're needing you you're wanting to appeal that onion and figure out how to do it.\n\n01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.500\nFor some reason I wanted to be the screenwriter.\n\n01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:04.500\nWere you a big Western fan?\n\n01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.500\nYeah, I know I like Westerns.\n\n01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:15.500\nWe used to always talk about OK that we had we had John Wayne rules like that that ran what Robocop could do and what he couldn't do.\n\n01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:16.500\nWe were always aware of those kind of things.\n\n01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:20.500\nYeah, because that's I mean the Prime Directive like the Western is a genre.\n\n01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:32.500\nThere's there's a set of a code code you know code of ethics a code of morality and with your Glenn Ford or Gary Cooper or Clint Eastwood or John Wayne that there's there's things there's do's and don'ts.\n\n01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:35.500\nAnd you are punished for having that code.\n\n01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.500\nThe code is what puts you in peril.\n\n01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:38.500\nRight.\n\n01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.500\nThe bad guys don't have a code.\n\n01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:41.500\nTheir code is do what you want.\n\n01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:45.500\nAnd so you're so there's a real fantasy fulfillment when he is killed because.\n\n01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:49.500\nEssentially because he's a cop and he he gets killed and he comes back as Robocop.\n\n01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.500\nHe gets to you can shoot him now.\n\n01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:52.500\nThat's he can't.\n\n01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.500\nAnd that's really what makes that character.\n\n01:06:54.500 --> 01:07:01.500\nMy favorite Western is High Plains Drifter because he's either a savior or he's Satan.\n\n01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:06.500\nHe's come back to either punish the town or save the town and both at the same times.\n\n01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:10.500\nAnd he is you don't know until the very end what exactly he is, but he's never given a name.\n\n01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:13.500\nBut he he he was the brother or was he.\n\n01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.500\nHe was the sheriff they killed in the beginning.\n\n01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.500\nI know that's kind of kind of Robocop.\n\n01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.500\nWell, I think those were things.\n\n01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.500\nThose were movies of my youth.\n\n01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:22.500\nYeah.\n\n01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:25.500\nBut then he has this kind of invulnerability.\n\n01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:31.500\nNot that he's bulletproof, but he's got like he comes from like he's.\n\n01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.500\nHe's he's he's also pure.\n\n01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:35.500\nAnd that's the other thing that you like about him.\n\n01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:41.500\nHe's he's actually a presexual character and he's pure and he's not he's not in any way diminished.\n\n01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:43.500\nAnd he really believes in justice.\n\n01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:46.500\nAnd there's something that's really people like about like that.\n\n01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:47.500\nYeah.\n\n01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:50.500\nAnd it reflects in the relationship with Nancy Allen, which is not sexualized.\n\n01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:51.500\nRight.\n\n01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:58.500\nBut when she sees him spin the gun and I I'll still get I'll still get choked up about that because like that's such a good fucking.\n\n01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:00.500\nOh, yeah, that relationship with Nancy Allen.\n\n01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:06.500\nYeah, it's worth noting it's for anything to hold up that was made in 1987.\n\n01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:09.500\nI say this very cynically as a person is just like, look, come on.\n\n01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:11.500\nRevenge of the Nerds is amazing.\n\n01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:16.500\nIt's a tragedy that culture moves so fast that some of these movies that are so influential and great.\n\n01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:28.500\nThey just end up having so many cultural problem points because this is how people, you know, it's like, like, oh, if you had telekinesis back then, you popped a girl's bra off and like it would have been.\n\n01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:29.500\nIt's weird science.\n\n01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:42.500\nYou were it's it Robocop does not have you it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't throb with the problematizable.\n\n01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:47.500\nNo, no, it's because by the way, I was an executive on weird science when it was in script form.\n\n01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:51.500\nAnd I thought it was I just watched that recent land boy that doesn't really hold up.\n\n01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:58.500\nBut I think the reason that is because I grew up in Marin County, which is a very, very neoliberal place.\n\n01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:01.500\nAnd it was very granola in the days that I grew up there.\n\n01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:09.500\nAnd my mother was the title nine officer at Redwood High School, and she was part of an sort of a feminist movement there.\n\n01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:16.500\nAnd so I was sort of steeped in that my mother had, you know, one night Gloria Steinem showed up at the house and when I was 13.\n\n01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:24.500\nSo I think all of that had an effect on me in a way that I really did want to create a role with Lewis that was just a role for a cop.\n\n01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.500\nYeah, wasn't about anything else.\n\n01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:30.500\nI love that. And sometimes it's as easy as what you don't do. It restraint.\n\n01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:39.500\nSo in casting, we couldn't cast it and we we had all this problem casting it and we kept looking at and very often really understood this too at some level.\n\n01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:41.500\nAnd again, if you look at his movies, you can see why.\n\n01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:49.500\nBut we kept looking at women and they would come into all these beautiful women came in and whenever you imagine them with him, it became this kind of thing.\n\n01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:51.500\nShe's going to rub her hands on the chassis of his chest.\n\n01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:59.500\nYeah, he sexualizes it somehow. And so one day, one day, Paul said, Yeah, I keep seeing the poster of Annie.\n\n01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:03.500\nI think she should look like the girl from Annie. And then Nancy Allen walked in.\n\n01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:05.500\nSo there's this kind of like trove.\n\n01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:10.500\nShe's sunny, she's feminine, but she's not sexual and she's kind of tough.\n\n01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:13.500\nShe has a legacy as a victim in movies. She's a scream queen.\n\n01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:16.500\nYeah, she really likes this movie because it's not it's not that.\n\n01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:24.500\nThat's what she's reborn in this movie as and there's it's also so immediately notable.\n\n01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:30.500\nI thought this was just brilliant futurism in your movie that in the locker room scenes, they're coed.\n\n01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:34.500\nAnd as a 15 year old in 1987, it made perfect sense.\n\n01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:37.500\nIt was such a it cost no money.\n\n01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.500\nNo production value put into it.\n\n01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:41.500\nThere it is. We're in the future.\n\n01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:42.500\nWhy the men and the women?\n\n01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:45.500\nYeah, of course, eventually we're going to stop.\n\n01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:49.500\n10 years later, we did the shower scene in Starship the same for the same reason.\n\n01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:55.500\nYeah, was it when you got the budget, was it more than you dreamed of or way less than you hoped for?\n\n01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:56.500\nFor Robocup?\n\n01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:57.500\nYeah.\n\n01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:59.500\nWell, the movie almost didn't get made a couple of times.\n\n01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:03.500\nIt was it was supposed to be seven six because that's what Terminator had cost.\n\n01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:05.500\nAnd they were going to spend a dollar more.\n\n01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:08.500\nAnd then one day we came into the office and everybody's gone home and it was over.\n\n01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:14.500\nAnd then they turned around and they decided they found some more money because they found some money in Japan\n\n01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:19.500\nbecause Peter Weller had done Bakaru Banzai and they were interested in Peter.\n\n01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.500\nAnd so suddenly we were on again.\n\n01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:26.500\nAnd we went in at like $10 million or something.\n\n01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:34.500\nAnd then we immediately had trouble and we were the final cost of the movies was 13.9, which is actually an amazing budget for that.\n\n01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:35.500\nIt would be about 28.\n\n01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:39.500\nLike normally like Blue Thunder was a movie that was made during that time as an action picture.\n\n01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:41.500\nAnd that was 28 at the time.\n\n01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:44.500\nSo John Davidson.\n\n01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:45.500\nBlue Thunder was $28 million. That's so sad.\n\n01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:49.500\nIt's super power was not making noise.\n\n01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:51.500\nIt was a super helicopter.\n\n01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:54.500\nIf it wanted it, you could turn the volume down on it.\n\n01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:55.500\nThat's right.\n\n01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:56.500\nThat's right.\n\n01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:58.500\nBut boy did it play with Roy Scheider's alcoholism.\n\n01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:03.500\nBut I like my uncle wrote that.\n\n01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:07.500\nThe but and it made what 50 million.\n\n01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:08.500\nWhich Robocup?\n\n01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:12.500\nIt was made $54 million, which in those days was a hit.\n\n01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:13.500\nYeah.\n\n01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:14.500\nSleeper hit of the summer.\n\n01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:15.500\nSo then you're a made man.\n\n01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:19.500\nI kind of want to talk about the two jakes of Robocup.\n\n01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:23.500\nRobocup 2 would be only because historically it's so interesting.\n\n01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:33.500\nI was reading the Wikipedia and I was like, Oh God, what a forest gumpy kind of thing that Robocup 2 is interesting sequel.\n\n01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:37.500\nYou definitely even if you don't read a single credit, you're kind of like, what's going on here?\n\n01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:46.500\nAnd, you know, they went to Frank Miller to write the script because it was 1988 and the WGA strike.\n\n01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:47.500\nWGA strike.\n\n01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:50.500\nAnd you had a script in the chamber.\n\n01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:51.500\nRight.\n\n01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.500\nYou got another new Meyer coming out.\n\n01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:54.500\nOh, you did?\n\n01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:55.500\nYou'd written one?\n\n01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:56.500\nWell, okay.\n\n01:12:56.500 --> 01:13:03.500\nSo they when the movie came out and we were made as you said, they said, okay, you have to write a new Robocup immediately or you're fired.\n\n01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:06.500\nThey literally said, if you don't immediately write a new story, we can fire you.\n\n01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:08.500\nAnd so we said, okay.\n\n01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:10.500\nAnd then Oliver Stone wanted us to write a script.\n\n01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:15.500\nAnd so four called about the CIA in Nicaragua.\n\n01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:18.500\nAnd that was kind of sexy, you know, and they sent us down to Nicaragua.\n\n01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:20.500\nYou get to work with Jim Belushi.\n\n01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:22.500\nWe got to run around with Sandinistas.\n\n01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:25.500\nIt was really, it was really groovy and he had just done platoon.\n\n01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:26.500\nSo he was the man.\n\n01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:29.500\nSo we wrote two scripts at the same time, which is a mistake.\n\n01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:35.500\nAnd we did it in three months and one script turned out better than the other and the Robocup script that we had written right before the strike.\n\n01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:36.500\nIt was okay.\n\n01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:38.500\nYou wrote Salvador?\n\n01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:41.500\nNo, we wrote a thing called Company Man right after platoon.\n\n01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:45.500\nAnd it was about it was about Nicaragua, not where was it?\n\n01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:46.500\nWhere is Salvador?\n\n01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:47.500\nIt's probably Salvador.\n\n01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:48.500\nYeah.\n\n01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:51.500\nThis was about the Sandinistas and we had to go down and do all that.\n\n01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:54.500\nIt was kind of a fun script, but they, Oliver didn't make it.\n\n01:13:54.500 --> 01:14:01.500\nAnd then we got fired because there was a writer strike and they hire, they signed a waiver and hired Frank Miller, who I had introduced to John Davis.\n\n01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:02.500\nThis is a really cool guy.\n\n01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:03.500\nI don't really know him.\n\n01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.500\nAnd so Frank did that script.\n\n01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:08.500\nHe did a, he did one script, which they, they rejected.\n\n01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:12.500\nAnd then they brought in Waylon Green, who wrote the Wild Bunch and they did a second script.\n\n01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:13.500\nWow.\n\n01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:15.500\nAnd it was kind of based on the creature.\n\n01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:21.500\nIn some ways, I believe it was based on the creature that Phil Tippett was going to do for it because John and Phil really had this idea.\n\n01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:28.500\nAnd there's, I don't love the movie, but there's the drug dealer kid is something I feel I could redeem if I had been writing it.\n\n01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:29.500\nYeah.\n\n01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:30.500\nWell, okay.\n\n01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:36.500\nThat was a roller coaster sentence because I was like, I, you know, one thing I fucking hate about that movie is that obnoxious ventriloquist, dummy kid.\n\n01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:37.500\nNo, I know.\n\n01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:38.500\nBut there's something.\n\n01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:39.500\nBut you're absolutely right.\n\n01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:40.500\nYes.\n\n01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:41.500\nThe things you could have done.\n\n01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:42.500\nYeah.\n\n01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:48.500\nI don't remember anything about Robocop 2 because I hated it and I just, I did nothing sticks to my brain.\n\n01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:53.500\nThe thing that sticks to my brain that I, it reminds me of something that you could have done a lot with.\n\n01:14:53.500 --> 01:15:03.500\nI thought it was a great, wonderful idea that the tragedy of the Robocop story and Robocop 2 is that the prime directives go up for committee.\n\n01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:04.500\nRight.\n\n01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.500\nAnd he ends up with like 109 directives.\n\n01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:10.500\nLike, would it, it won't kill you to smile now and then.\n\n01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:14.500\nAnd kind of like, it's just sort of like Robocop becomes this schizophrenic.\n\n01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:16.500\nI don't know if it's true, but I bet you that's a John Davison idea.\n\n01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:18.500\nBecause that's really what John, that would have been.\n\n01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:21.500\nDirective number four was don't sweat the little shit.\n\n01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:25.500\nRight. I mean, I just, I find that kind of, it's funny and it's absurd and realistic.\n\n01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:27.500\nLike, it's just like the, it's resonant.\n\n01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:30.500\nThe idea of like, oh God, this would be the thing that would kill Robocop.\n\n01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:42.500\nHe would end up having like all these directives and then like, but yeah, that, that, that, but it's, if it wasn't called Robocop, it might even be like a cult favorite of mine.\n\n01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:51.500\nBecause it would be like this weird comic booky cyber punky movie with Tom Noonan as this crackhead that turns into a crackhead robot.\n\n01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:55.500\nBut as a Robocop sequel, boy, how could you, how could you.\n\n01:15:55.500 --> 01:16:03.500\nIt's got to make you feel kind of, kind of good that, you know, nobody can make it work.\n\n01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:05.500\nBecause there's been so many different like.\n\n01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:08.500\nWhen you drop swords, they just merge with stones.\n\n01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:14.500\nThey just, they can make a Robocop remake of TV series.\n\n01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:16.500\nWell, I hope they'll get it right one of these days.\n\n01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:17.500\nYeah.\n\n01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:19.500\nMGM wants to make another one and we're trying to help, but we'll see.\n\n01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:25.500\nYeah. So there is a, there was a, there was this reboot in 2014, which I didn't watch.\n\n01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:28.500\nAnd I'm not usually a snob about reboots, but this is too personal for me.\n\n01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:30.500\nI knew there was absolutely no way.\n\n01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:33.500\nI saw the, I saw the suit and I, I got mad.\n\n01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:34.500\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:35.500\nI'm like, maybe.\n\n01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:36.500\nI mean, give me a break.\n\n01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:38.500\nAgain, I was like, I saw the.\n\n01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.500\nRob, that personally just wounded.\n\n01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:42.500\nI'm just so pissed off.\n\n01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:45.500\nI mean, it's just, cause it's just like somebody went, no, I think we can do better.\n\n01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.500\nAnd that's, that's what they come up with.\n\n01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:52.500\nAnd it's like, get the, get, get seriously, get out, get out of here.\n\n01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:54.500\nThe arrogance is astounding.\n\n01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:55.500\nOut of here.\n\n01:16:55.500 --> 01:17:03.500\nEspecially when even for your time, it was already, it was already a, a, a confident bet.\n\n01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:11.500\nIt wasn't, it wasn't like all the rage was guys in ridiculous tin man costumes, like\n\n01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:12.500\nthat looked like tanks.\n\n01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:15.500\nIt wasn't like, oh, you just rode that, those coattails.\n\n01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:20.500\nIt was like, it would already been established that if you just trust this like singular\n\n01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:24.500\ntone and let it be its own thing and then for them to go like, yeah, but everything's black\n\n01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:25.500\nand rubber now.\n\n01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:29.500\nIt's hot, but I don't want to bag on that stuff and shake my cane at it.\n\n01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:34.500\nBut they're, it's important to note, so you got Robocop, you got Robocop two, you got\n\n01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:39.500\nRobocop three, where I think there's like ninjas in that one and a jet pack.\n\n01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:40.500\nThere's been a cartoon.\n\n01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:42.500\nThere's been a, all kinds of stuff.\n\n01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:43.500\nComic books.\n\n01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:45.500\nAnd then the, there's the reboot, which I didn't watch.\n\n01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:46.500\nSo I don't know what it was.\n\n01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:47.500\nIt was a Canadian TV series.\n\n01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:48.500\nCanonically.\n\n01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:50.500\nPrime directive.\n\n01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:54.500\nNow they're, I don't know what stage they're at.\n\n01:17:54.500 --> 01:18:02.000\nThey can fill us in on the details, but they're, they, they're going to do a sequel to the\n\n01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.500\noriginal that ignores all of this other stuff.\n\n01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:07.500\nIs that, that's what I, well, we'll see what's going to happen.\n\n01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:08.500\nAnd we'll see.\n\n01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:12.500\nAnd, but I have to say that MGM has been very, very nice to me since the reboot.\n\n01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:18.500\nI, when I got credited because of the WGA, I had to go in and meet with them.\n\n01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:21.500\nAnd I met with the, the president of MGM.\n\n01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:26.500\nAnd you'll see online, as I was confused, it's like, like Ed's got a credit on the 2014\n\n01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:31.500\nRobocop reboot, which micro broke a little part of my heart for a second.\n\n01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:33.500\nWell, it was, I had nothing to do with it.\n\n01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:34.500\nRight.\n\n01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.500\nIt was sort of nice to get the residuals.\n\n01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:42.500\nAnd it's because just to clarify, it's, it's because the writers in, in basing it on your\n\n01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:48.500\nkind of your, your, your characters and your story, they evoked enough of it, that arbitration.\n\n01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:54.500\nThey took so many pieces of it and used it that in the arbitration process, they, they\n\n01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:56.500\nassigned us a fair amount of credit for it.\n\n01:18:56.500 --> 01:19:01.500\nNow I feel like that's got to feel good because that's not even like the, the, like it's,\n\n01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:05.500\nit's a, it's a, it's a maybe like a 15 year old boy fantasy to be like, yeah.\n\n01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:08.500\nAnd then, and then they did it without me and it sucked.\n\n01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:16.500\nAnd it's like, it's, but like that's a, that's a proper like mentor wizard fantasy of like,\n\n01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:22.500\nit's been 30 years and these kids are trying your craft and like the blood magic gets out\n\n01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:28.500\nof control and you're just like, yeah, you're, you're, you're sitting there and you're lazy\n\n01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:30.500\nboy and you're like, oh, I felt a tingle.\n\n01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:34.500\nSomeone's trying to do what I did again.\n\n01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:37.500\nThey always, they always think they, they, they're always sure that what they're doing\n\n01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:38.500\nis the right thing.\n\n01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:44.500\nDo you feel like maybe you can, or can't talk about what stage this new possible straight\n\n01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:48.500\nsequel thing is, but do you feel confident if you went back and tried to do the sequel\n\n01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:53.500\nthat you have, like, that you, like, you know where you're going with that and you could\n\n01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:54.500\npull it off?\n\n01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:56.500\nWe've had, we've had a bunch of conversation about this.\n\n01:19:56.500 --> 01:20:00.500\nI was going to, what happened, which was interesting was I went in when they were,\n\n01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:03.500\nwhen I, when I met them, they'd all just finished this movie, hadn't come out yet.\n\n01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:07.500\nAnd I had a kind of, it was kind of a weird, like, how did I feel about this?\n\n01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:08.500\nThey were remaking this movie.\n\n01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:13.500\nI was meeting all these people, but I remembered having made a couple of movies that were traumatic,\n\n01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:17.500\nlike that they were all probably in shock and that had been a very difficult experience.\n\n01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:18.500\nAnd it really had been.\n\n01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:22.500\nAnd so I decided to just interview them about that.\n\n01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:24.500\nAnd I interviewed everyone I could.\n\n01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:27.500\nI interviewed the writer that we got credit from.\n\n01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:28.500\nI interviewed the president.\n\n01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:29.500\nI interviewed the director.\n\n01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.500\nAnd I would just sit there and say, well, what was that like?\n\n01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:33.500\nAnd how did that happen?\n\n01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:36.500\nAnd they sort of remembered that somehow.\n\n01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:38.500\nAnd when the movie came out, it didn't do that well.\n\n01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:41.500\nI got a call from the president of production saying, why don't you come in here and tell\n\n01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:43.500\nus any Robocop ideas you have?\n\n01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:48.500\nAnd I went in and I said, well, you know, there was, I started telling him this idea I had.\n\n01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:53.500\nAnd he said, are you pitching me the original sequel that you guys wrote back in 1988?\n\n01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:55.500\nAnd I said, well, yeah, kind of.\n\n01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.500\nAnd he said, oh, okay.\n\n01:20:57.500 --> 01:21:00.500\nAnd that sort of has set us off in a different direction.\n\n01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:02.500\nOh, fuck yeah.\n\n01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:04.500\nBaby.\n\n01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:05.500\nAre you kidding me?\n\n01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:06.500\nNo, but we'll see.\n\n01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:08.500\nThere's a lot of work to be done.\n\n01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:11.500\nAnd then Neil Blumkamp came swooping in when he heard they were going to do it.\n\n01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.500\nAnd look at Rob.\n\n01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.500\nHe was going to do it for a while.\n\n01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:20.500\nHe said, well, there's one funny story about it.\n\n01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:22.500\nThen it didn't work out.\n\n01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:26.500\nThey developed a few scripts and he had a bunch of different ideas.\n\n01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:28.500\nAnd I don't think it ever really came together.\n\n01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:31.500\nBut at one point he decided, and I thought this was interesting.\n\n01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:35.500\nHe said, we really got to go and do it like it happened right after the first one.\n\n01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:37.500\nThat it was Verhoeven's next movie.\n\n01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:40.500\nHe said, I'm going to do it just like Paul Verhoeven.\n\n01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:43.500\nSo the other day I'm sitting with Paul Verhoeven.\n\n01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:47.500\nHe said, yeah, he said he was going to do it just like Paul Verhoeven.\n\n01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:49.500\nI can't quite do Paul's voice.\n\n01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:50.500\nIt sounds better.\n\n01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:53.500\nAnd he said, but he said, I can't do it like Paul Verhoeven.\n\n01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:57.500\nHe said, because I won't have the same set of circumstances creatively.\n\n01:21:57.500 --> 01:22:00.500\nI'm not trying to make a movie for $10 million.\n\n01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:02.500\nI don't have John Davidson.\n\n01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:03.500\nI don't have Phil Tippett then.\n\n01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:04.500\nI don't have you.\n\n01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:06.500\nI don't have all these people together.\n\n01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:11.500\nAnd for him, that's as much a part of the creative thing in that moment as anything else.\n\n01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:16.500\nYeah, because that movie does kind of feel like...\n\n01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:21.500\nAnd Die Hard 2, that's more of a kind of a larger production, maybe.\n\n01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:24.500\nBut they feel like B-movies that were done perfectly.\n\n01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:28.500\nAnd they kind of feel like they were made in secrets.\n\n01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:30.500\nThey were made for you.\n\n01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:35.500\nWhen you walk into the theater, we turned over a rock and found a diamond.\n\n01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:39.500\nIt's not like you go in there and there's this giant tent pole kind of thing.\n\n01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.500\nWell, they're not shoving it down your throat as we were talking.\n\n01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:42.500\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:43.500\nIt's like the Robocop.\n\n01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:48.500\nI feel a personal relationship with that in a way that I don't feel with like E.T.\n\n01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:52.500\nor things like that that are just these giant juggernaut kind of things.\n\n01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:56.500\nI think that might have something to do with just not to sound like an old cane shaker,\n\n01:22:56.500 --> 01:23:01.500\nbut I think it just has to do with the singularity that hasn't happened yet, which is CG.\n\n01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:08.500\nWhen CG starts to happen, the vastness of your world is not related in any way to your budget.\n\n01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:14.500\nIf Kronenberg wants to reboot the fly, he has to rent a warehouse.\n\n01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:16.500\nHe has to build telepods.\n\n01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:21.500\nAnd these characters, these Rick Bakers, these Phil Tippets, these craftsmen have to come in\n\n01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:26.500\nand figure out how to make a beetle into a person and vice versa.\n\n01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:34.500\nAnd there's a relationship there between budget, scope, but more importantly, like,\n\n01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:38.500\noh, if this guy is going to become a fly in this movie, then it's all the more important\n\n01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:42.500\nthat we understand that he's a human being because of the budget,\n\n01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:46.500\nbecause of the practicality of the makeup and everything.\n\n01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:50.500\nWe can't waste anyone's time here on an emotional level.\n\n01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:54.500\nAnd then you start to get into like, okay, you're going to show up at Warner Brothers.\n\n01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:57.500\nThere's going to be a 90-foot sheet of green.\n\n01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:01.500\nYou're not going to be in a scene with any other actor.\n\n01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:03.500\nWe just need your head.\n\n01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:05.500\nWe're going to scan it from 360 degrees.\n\n01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:10.500\nSign this form that says, if you die, you can be a cracker.\n\n01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:15.500\nAnd congratulations because the computer says you already made $100 million in Hong Kong\n\n01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:17.500\nand go, goodbye.\n\n01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:22.500\nAnd we've made some amazing movies with this technology,\n\n01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:29.500\nbut what we've also done is we've lost that middle class.\n\n01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:31.500\nI don't know what to call it.\n\n01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:35.500\nWell, Verhoeven always would say that reality is the best special effect\n\n01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:37.500\nand that reality is what makes these things work.\n\n01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:39.500\nAnd even in a story level, he would go, I don't like that.\n\n01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:40.500\nIt's not real.\n\n01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:41.500\nIt's not how it would happen.\n\n01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:45.500\nEven if you're talking about absurd things like robots and law enforcement and stuff like that.\n\n01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:49.500\nAnd also, you really feel the reality of a man in a suit.\n\n01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:52.500\nThe performance is because of that suit.\n\n01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:53.500\nOh, let's talk about that a little bit.\n\n01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:54.500\nSure.\n\n01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:55.500\nDr. Weller, PhD.\n\n01:24:55.500 --> 01:25:00.500\nSo I always assumed, and I think this is incredibly easy to assume,\n\n01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:03.500\nand I'm so intrigued that the answer is not exactly,\n\n01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:09.500\nthat when you watch Robocop, because I didn't, it's like, who was Peter Weller?\n\n01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:12.500\nIt turns out, Bucca Rubanzi, right, okay.\n\n01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:15.500\nBut I watched that movie and I was like, who's this guy?\n\n01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:20.500\nOh, they must have cast him for those like weird kissy lips.\n\n01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:23.500\nHis like almost feminine jawline.\n\n01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:27.500\nBecause they knew that they were committing this cardinal sin,\n\n01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:30.500\nthat they were going to be casting this actor with no,\n\n01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:34.500\nthis character was going to have no eyes, no nose, no ears.\n\n01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:36.500\nAnd it was so important.\n\n01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:40.500\nIt was a picture like these auditions where these actors are coming in and standing under a sheet\n\n01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:46.500\nthat's on C stands and the only thing visible is their lips and that Peter Weller walked away with the part.\n\n01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:47.500\nNot the case at all.\n\n01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:49.500\nHe was Bucca Rubanzi.\n\n01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:52.500\nWell, it really helps that Peter was really thin.\n\n01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:54.500\nThat helps a lot when you're building a suit like that.\n\n01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:58.500\nAnd so if you put the wrong person in the suit, you're going to get the Michelin man.\n\n01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:03.500\nBut he's very, he also has this kind of perfect look of,\n\n01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:06.500\nI used to say when I was being meaner,\n\n01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:11.500\nbut he has this kind of tragic look, mythic self pity or something.\n\n01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:15.500\nBut there's a tragedy about his face that really works well in that.\n\n01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:17.500\nBut no, he's got those kissy lips.\n\n01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:22.500\nWe had, we always, I always thought you needed a real actor in the park.\n\n01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:25.500\nWe had, we went out to a bunch of different people came in.\n\n01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:27.500\nI mean, Keith Carradine wanted to do it.\n\n01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:32.500\nRobert Carradine, no, not David Carradine really wanted to do it.\n\n01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:36.500\nAnd so we had all those kinds of things, but it came down to, I think...\n\n01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:39.500\nThere's a great SNL sketch here, obviously.\n\n01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:42.500\nJack Lemon and the Robocop.\n\n01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:47.500\nPeter was somebody that was, we knew he was a good actor.\n\n01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:52.500\nHe had, Orion liked him because he had, Bucca Rubanzi had made some money in Japan.\n\n01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:54.500\nAnd he came in, he wouldn't read on tape.\n\n01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:55.500\nSo he read with me.\n\n01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:58.500\nHe says he didn't read, but we actually had to read with me.\n\n01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:00.500\nAnd it was actually kind of scary.\n\n01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:03.500\nAnd Paul and I, well, Paul said, okay, that's good.\n\n01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:04.500\nWe'll go with him.\n\n01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:08.500\nAnd then he went out and trained with a mime coach, Monee Yacum,\n\n01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:14.500\nfor a long time in hockey gear, in Central Park, trying to get all these moves.\n\n01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:15.500\nThat's so cool.\n\n01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:18.500\nIt's so important that his movements are so...\n\n01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:19.500\nDid anybody ask him to do that?\n\n01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:22.500\nAnd of course, now you will start acting like a man.\n\n01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:23.500\nI think he wanted to do that.\n\n01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:24.500\nHe knew that was an issue.\n\n01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:26.500\nJohn Davidson, everybody knew that was a good idea.\n\n01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:31.500\nSo meantime, the suit...\n\n01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:34.500\nWell, the suit is being made and it's being made.\n\n01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:37.500\nAnd then the suit is a week late in production,\n\n01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:40.500\nwhich really causes a lot of trouble, but it's for good reasons.\n\n01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:43.500\nCome quietly or there will be trouble.\n\n01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:46.500\nWhen Peter is thrown into that suit for the first time,\n\n01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:51.500\nit's a huge crisis in the production because he's never been in the suit before.\n\n01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:54.500\nAnd even though there's been all this prep and all this stuff,\n\n01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:57.500\nnow you've got to make the character work.\n\n01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:00.500\nAnd it was a really bad weekend.\n\n01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:03.500\nAnd it was sort of a cauldron.\n\n01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:06.500\nAnd out of that bad, bad weekend came this suit movements.\n\n01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:09.500\nAll the stuff he'd done before, now he's working with Paul.\n\n01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:11.500\nAnd that's how...\n\n01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:14.500\nIt was like it was born under huge pressure.\n\n01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:17.500\nWait, well, I want to make sure I'm clear on what you're saying.\n\n01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:19.500\nYou're saying there was this sort of travesty.\n\n01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:21.500\nIt almost sounds like the Jaws story of the Sharks Network.\n\n01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:23.500\nNo, there wasn't anything wrong with the suit.\n\n01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:26.500\nThe minute the last minute, it was more complicated than everybody.\n\n01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:31.500\nAnd was his work with the Mime people as a result of the awkwardness of the suit being late?\n\n01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:33.500\nHe had never really been in the suit before.\n\n01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:36.500\nAnd then the suit came on to the set later than it was supposed to.\n\n01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:39.500\nSo there was a lot of pressure, like let's suit it tomorrow.\n\n01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:42.500\nAnd in those days, when you had a suit,\n\n01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:44.500\nthe first time you put it on, it took 14 hours.\n\n01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:46.500\nSo the first day he shot maybe an hour.\n\n01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:48.500\n14 hours?\n\n01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:51.500\nAnd then by the time they got it right, it was a much quicker in and of.\n\n01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:53.500\nBut it was a big deal.\n\n01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:57.500\nBut it was somehow, everybody at the time, we had other problems.\n\n01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:58.500\nWe almost got shut down.\n\n01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:01.500\nThe production guarantee came in.\n\n01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:03.500\nAnd for a moment, it looked really bad.\n\n01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:07.500\nAnd it was under this kind of pressurized situation at the beginning of the movie\n\n01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:10.500\nthat the suit came in and he had to get in it.\n\n01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.500\nAnd it was where the character was born.\n\n01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:16.500\nThis is something that can't be discounted because at the time, although there's no CG,\n\n01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:23.500\nit is something that absolutely makes all of what you're doing on this set so potentially disastrous.\n\n01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:24.500\nIt didn't work.\n\n01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:25.500\nIt wasn't going to work.\n\n01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:27.500\nThat was the entire moment right there.\n\n01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:28.500\nEverything else was working.\n\n01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:33.500\nBut if that didn't come together, if Peter, if you didn't buy Peter in the suit as Rebel Cop,\n\n01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:38.500\nthen that was anybody that knows their 1980s popcorn movie,\n\n01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:42.500\nyou mentioned a movie from 1986 that you were so when you saw it.\n\n01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:43.500\nShort circuit.\n\n01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:44.500\nYeah.\n\n01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:48.500\nI was like, oh, God, I never thought about short circuit in relation to Rebel Cop.\n\n01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:51.500\nAnd it was your nightmare because it was like, that's how you do it.\n\n01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:53.500\nThey were going to beat us into the theaters.\n\n01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:56.500\nIt was like, that's what a robot was in that day.\n\n01:29:56.500 --> 01:30:00.500\nNo CG yet, but absolutely armatures, erectors.\n\n01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:02.500\nI am a remote control.\n\n01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:04.500\nE.T. is a robot, essentially.\n\n01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:05.500\nAnd I was really relieved.\n\n01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:06.500\nI was like, oh, thank God.\n\n01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:07.500\nThis is so different from that.\n\n01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:11.500\nThe stupid question, the gun holster that comes out of his leg,\n\n01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:13.500\nwas that a practical effect or is that stop motion?\n\n01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:17.500\nThat was a practical effect that it was a leg that Robertine made.\n\n01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:19.500\nAnd Robertine, here's how good Robertine is.\n\n01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:20.500\nRobertine just made that.\n\n01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:21.500\nWhat?\n\n01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:22.500\nWe didn't talk to him about it.\n\n01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:24.500\nHe just said, oh, no, it has to be this way.\n\n01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:25.500\nAnd he just made that.\n\n01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:27.500\nHe just myth-bustered it and said, fuck it,\n\n01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:29.500\nthe thing comes out and I'm thinking of the gun.\n\n01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:30.500\nOf the many, many, many.\n\n01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:32.500\nI kind of want to talk about Foley.\n\n01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:35.500\nI want to talk about the loop group because it's like, I wonder,\n\n01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:39.500\nis it a loop group line where it's like in that firing squad thing where,\n\n01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:43.500\nokay, so everyone's just shooting on the firing line\n\n01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:47.500\nand then slowly the sound of this weird gun.\n\n01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:49.500\nAnd then everyone's running.\n\n01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:51.500\nVerhoeven's doing this thing.\n\n01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:52.500\nThe camera's going.\n\n01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:53.500\nEveryone's running.\n\n01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:57.500\nAnd then there's this one voice rings out.\n\n01:30:57.500 --> 01:31:00.500\nThere's this guy going, look at that fucking gun.\n\n01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:03.500\nI meant to bring it to you.\n\n01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:04.500\nI'll bring you the script.\n\n01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:05.500\nIt's in the script.\n\n01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:06.500\nIt's in the script?\n\n01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:07.500\nI love it.\n\n01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:13.500\nThe cop's reaction to Robocop is so important\n\n01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:20.500\nbecause, again, they do say while they're running\n\n01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:23.500\nand they're separated by Chainlink,\n\n01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:25.500\nthey're watching this robot who, by the way,\n\n01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:28.500\nis being meticulously revealed.\n\n01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:30.500\nThat was Verhoeven.\n\n01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:32.500\nVerhoeven, I remember from the commentary,\n\n01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:34.500\nthe brilliant idea of the first time you see him\n\n01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:36.500\nis essentially on video assist.\n\n01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:37.500\nHe walks by.\n\n01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:40.500\nAnd it's so smart because it goes\n\n01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:41.500\nand it's subjective.\n\n01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:46.500\nThe transformation where you go into death itself\n\n01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:48.500\nand then the only thing you're conscious of\n\n01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:51.500\nis the reassembly of your life.\n\n01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:56.500\nYou, the audience, including a weird female executive\n\n01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:59.500\nin a pencil skirt who is not a character in the film\n\n01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:02.500\nbut is a character in your formative life\n\n01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:05.500\nwho made out with you drunk at a New Year's Eve party.\n\n01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:07.500\nBut that's the...\n\n01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:08.500\nYou mean Tyler.\n\n01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:09.500\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:11.500\nYeah, I'm saying, like, she's not in the movie.\n\n01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:12.500\nShe doesn't have an arc.\n\n01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:13.500\nNo, she is.\n\n01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:14.500\nShe is actually the...\n\n01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:15.500\nWell, she didn't have an arc.\n\n01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:17.500\nI know I'm saying, like, she has a story\n\n01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:19.500\nonly within Robocop's nursery.\n\n01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:21.500\nIt's so ancient Greek.\n\n01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:23.500\nIt's like, we don't have to carry her.\n\n01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:26.500\nWe didn't have to figure out how she's related to this and that\n\n01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:29.500\never when Dick Jones gets fired goes,\n\n01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:30.500\nlike, can I be promoted?\n\n01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:32.500\nIt's like, she is simply...\n\n01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:35.500\nHer job, mythically, is that she is this Athena\n\n01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:37.500\nthat is there.\n\n01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:40.500\nThe addition of this idea that during this assembly\n\n01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:42.500\nof what you're becoming Robocop,\n\n01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:45.500\nand so you don't know how much time is passing,\n\n01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:47.500\nand then...\n\n01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:49.500\nAnd, like, the targeting systems are like,\n\n01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:51.500\nall right, no, hold it.\n\n01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:53.500\nAh, shit!\n\n01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:54.500\nAnd you're watching them.\n\n01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:55.500\nAnd then...\n\n01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:58.500\nAnd it comes to life and you hear in the distance\n\n01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:00.500\nmusic, party favors,\n\n01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:03.500\nand this drunk version of this woman\n\n01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:06.500\nwho has smugly crushed Miguel Ferrer's hand\n\n01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:08.500\nwith the prosthesis and, like,\n\n01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:10.500\nshe just comes into the...\n\n01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:12.500\nShe sneaks over to the camera\n\n01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:14.500\nand puts a big lipstick kiss on it.\n\n01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:15.500\nSage Parker.\n\n01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:17.500\nAnd that's an interesting scene\n\n01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:19.500\nbecause that's the only ad-lib scene in the whole movie.\n\n01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:23.500\nWe were at the Mary Cape cosmetics company in Dallas,\n\n01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:24.500\nwhich is where that shot.\n\n01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:26.500\nAnd somebody, the prop person,\n\n01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:29.500\nbrought in a box of props for a New Year's Eve\n\n01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:31.500\nparty or something.\n\n01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:33.500\nI don't know why they were there, and I said,\n\n01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:35.500\noh, we have to use this crown,\n\n01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:37.500\nand we have to do this New Year's Eve party.\n\n01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:38.500\nAnd I wrote it.\n\n01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:39.500\nThe only time I've ever done this,\n\n01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:41.500\nI went into a room in Mary Cape Place,\n\n01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:43.500\nand I wrote this thing, and they shot it.\n\n01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:44.500\nAnd that was the scene.\n\n01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:45.500\nAnd that was really...\n\n01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:48.500\nThe kiss was something that was sort of ad-libbed on the set.\n\n01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:50.500\nAnd so the cops, then, like, yeah,\n\n01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:51.500\nI went off on several tangents there,\n\n01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:53.500\nbut the cops, even though, like,\n\n01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:55.500\nthe story is just mounting, and it's like,\n\n01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:58.500\nwe're just not seeing all of Robocop yet.\n\n01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:01.500\nAnd now we're seeing enough of him\n\n01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:03.500\nthrough the eyes of the cops.\n\n01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:05.500\nAnd the cops are both one.\n\n01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:07.500\nThey can't get enough of seeing him.\n\n01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:09.500\nThey just want to see him.\n\n01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:11.500\nBut at the same time, they're absolutely aware,\n\n01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:13.500\nand one of them says something like,\n\n01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:14.500\nthey're going to replace him.\n\n01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:15.500\nWe're out of a job.\n\n01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:16.500\nWe're out of a job.\n\n01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:19.500\nIt's like...\n\n01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:21.500\nYou feel like if you're developing a movie\n\n01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:23.500\nthat somebody would have the note of, like,\n\n01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:25.500\ndo the cops like Robocop or not?\n\n01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:26.500\nIt's just saying, I'm confused,\n\n01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:28.500\nbecause you got them running,\n\n01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:30.500\nand it seems like they're big fans of Robocop.\n\n01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:32.500\nBut don't they want cops to be not Robocops?\n\n01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:33.500\nWe were really...\n\n01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:36.500\nJohn Davison really kept some of those things away.\n\n01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:38.500\nI mean, you know, we had to deal with some notes,\n\n01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:40.500\nbut we didn't have to deal with too many of them,\n\n01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:42.500\nand they kind of really let us, you know,\n\n01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:43.500\nbring them the script.\n\n01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:45.500\nAnd I guess each time we brought them one,\n\n01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:46.500\nthere was never...\n\n01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:47.500\nWe never had those notes,\n\n01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:49.500\nor I don't remember any of those.\n\n01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:52.500\nI also remember not taking too many of their notes,\n\n01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:55.500\nor just I learned that you could ignore the bad ones.\n\n01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:59.500\nYeah, I mean, they'll call you difficult,\n\n01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:02.500\nbut if you make $50 million,\n\n01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:04.500\nwho's gonna remember that?\n\n01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:06.500\nSo what did you prefer?\n\n01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:08.500\nBecause it seems like when you look at your filmography,\n\n01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:12.500\nyou seem more invested in the Starship Trooper franchise.\n\n01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:14.500\nThat seems like something that kind of...\n\n01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:16.500\nNo, I mean, they offered me...\n\n01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:20.500\nI kept getting paid to write the Starship Trooper stuff.\n\n01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:22.500\nAnd John Davison wanted to do...\n\n01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:24.500\nJohn Davison always wanted to help\n\n01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:26.500\nPhil Tippett direct a movie,\n\n01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:28.500\nso that was Starship 2,\n\n01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:30.500\nand I came along to help him a little bit.\n\n01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:32.500\nAre the bugs the good guys?\n\n01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:36.500\nNot really.\n\n01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:38.500\nI felt like the movie was saying,\n\n01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:39.500\nha, ha.\n\n01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:42.500\nThe movie says maybe you have been rooting for the Nazis\n\n01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:44.500\nin the act in actually...\n\n01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:46.500\nWhich is not something that when you say,\n\n01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:48.500\nyou talk about referencing these movies,\n\n01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:51.500\nthat's not an element of the movies\n\n01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:53.500\nthat you're referencing.\n\n01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:55.500\nMilitary movies that are selling warbots.\n\n01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:57.500\nWell, what do you mean?\n\n01:35:57.500 --> 01:35:59.500\nThe moral ambiguity of the,\n\n01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:01.500\nwell, you never know what makes us so different from the Nazis.\n\n01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:03.500\nI think that's not an element of those movies.\n\n01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:05.500\nOf which movies?\n\n01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:08.500\nOf the American propaganda movies,\n\n01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:11.500\nbut we also looked at all the movies they were making, too.\n\n01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:13.500\nI mean, we were just trying to come...\n\n01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:15.500\nThe Nazi propaganda.\n\n01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:17.500\nWould you like to know more?\n\n01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:19.500\nWell, there you go.\n\n01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:21.500\nYeah, those sequences are amazing.\n\n01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:23.500\nThe narrative pieces.\n\n01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:25.500\nDid you kind of meticulously write those?\n\n01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:27.500\nAre you...\n\n01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:29.500\nThose are my favorite things.\n\n01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:31.500\nThose are the things that I like.\n\n01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:33.500\nI can imagine you agonizing over page by page,\n\n01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:35.500\nwhere it's like...\n\n01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:37.500\nHave you ever had a moment when you're doing work\n\n01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:39.500\nthat turned out to be great?\n\n01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:41.500\nSpoilers, I need the answer to be yes.\n\n01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:43.500\nWhere it's like,\n\n01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:45.500\nyou're not allowed to tell anybody\n\n01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:47.500\nwhat you've done in the last six hours\n\n01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:49.500\nbecause the actual technical answer\n\n01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:51.500\nis dialogue.\n\n01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:53.500\nWell, that's my entire writing life.\n\n01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:55.500\nAll right, thank you.

I mean he's surrounded with Kevlar.\n\n01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:07.500\nIt's his blessing in his curse.\n\n01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:09.500\nPaul just said\n\n01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:11.500\nit was so lovely he had that idea because\n\n01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:13.500\nit got us out of this problem.\n\n01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:15.500\nJust think that there's\n\n01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:17.500\nno way, sometimes in my worst moments\n\n01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:19.500\nI'm rehearsing myself because I'm like\n\n01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:21.500\nI imagine you writing that somehow.\n\n01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:23.500\nI didn't write that.\n\n01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:25.500\nIn the script, how did he get out of there?\n\n01:44:25.500 --> 01:44:27.500\nI think there was a cut and then a new scene\n\n01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:29.500\nand he was running away and there was nobody around.\n\n01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:31.500\nSomething like that.\n\n01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:33.500\nYou did like a newspaper\n\n01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:35.500\nand Robocampus came out.\n\n01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:37.500\nIt was heroin.\n\n01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:39.500\nHe had to be saved by Lewis.\n\n01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:41.500\nExtreme, extreme.\n\n01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:43.500\nRobot man gets away.\n\n01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:45.500\nMust have cost him a fortune.\n\n01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:47.500\nAnd says,\n\n01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:49.500\nMurphy is me, Lewis.\n\n01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:51.500\nWe knew that.\n\n01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:53.500\nIn fact, I once pitched that to Stan Lee.\n\n01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:55.500\nStan Lee liked that so much.\n\n01:44:55.500 --> 01:44:57.500\nHe said, oh wait, here's the really good part\n\n01:44:57.500 --> 01:44:59.500\nwhere he comes and finds his character.\n\n01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:01.500\nWhat you don't know is that\n\n01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:03.500\nthis almost was a Marvel comic book.\n\n01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:05.500\nAnd thank God it wasn't because they were going to buy it.\n\n01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:07.500\nStan Lee wanted to buy it\n\n01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:09.500\nat a certain point for a comic book.\n\n01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:11.500\nThen he asked me if it was\n\n01:45:11.500 --> 01:45:13.500\nhadn't I just read Deathlock\n\n01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:15.500\nand they don't know it anyway.\n\n01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:17.500\nAnd then they decided, because Marvel wasn't a very successful company,\n\n01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:19.500\nthen they decided not to do it.\n\n01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:21.500\nAnd it went to Orion.\n\n01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:23.500\nThank God for Stan Lee's lack of success.\n\n01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:25.500\nWell, he did okay after that.\n\n01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:27.500\nThat's so funny.\n\n01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:29.500\nI love the baller and I'm going to be a cynic\n\n01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:31.500\nand say, I bet Stan Lee\n\n01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:33.500\nas a Hail Mary in every meeting\n\n01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:35.500\nback then would say,\n\n01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:37.500\nnever having even seen Deathlock,\n\n01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:39.500\nthat he would just go,\n\n01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:41.500\nare you sure this isn't just Deathlock?\n\n01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:43.500\nBecause 10% of the time a writer\n\n01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:45.500\nwould cave and go, yeah, it is.\n\n01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:47.500\nI didn't realize how dangerous it was\n\n01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:49.500\nto talk to people like that at the time.\n\n01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:51.500\nBecause they had all these characters,\n\n01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:53.500\nbut I think Marvel was more a bun.\n\n01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:55.500\nThere was a secretary\n\n01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:57.500\nand one other guy in Stan Lee out here\n\n01:45:57.500 --> 01:45:59.500\nand that was it.\n\n01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:01.500\nI met him when I was a young executive universal\n\n01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:03.500\nand he had nothing better to do\n\n01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:05.500\nthan go out to have lunch with me.\n\n01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:07.500\nWho at the\n\n01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:09.500\nFortune Cookie Place writes\n\n01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:11.500\nI don't know,\n\n01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:13.500\nbut it was right on Robertson.\n\n01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:15.500\nIt was right there.\n\n01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:17.500\nFortune Cookies were badass though.\n\n01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:19.500\nDid you save that Fortune Cookie?\n\n01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:21.500\nI don't know.\n\n01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:23.500\nI might be somewhere in a box.\n\n01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:25.500\nThey became advice cookies.\n\n01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:27.500\nThey became like, you know, sometimes wearing a tie\n\n01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:29.500\ncan make you feel more confident.\n\n01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:31.500\nDid someone start suing Fortune Cookies?\n\n01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:33.500\nBecause they used to say like,\n\n01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:35.500\na dude's going to murder you with something red.\n\n01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:37.500\nThey were fun.\n\n01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:39.500\nDuck.\n\n01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:41.500\nThat was the menu, you dummy.\n\n01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:47.500\nBiggest cookie I ever saw.\n\n01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:49.500\nCouldn't even eat it.\n\n01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:51.500\nI get drunk for how to show it.\n\n01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:55.500\nI'm never going to get over\n\n01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:57.500\nthat one of the prime directors was from a Fortune Cookie.\n\n01:46:57.500 --> 01:46:59.500\nThat's just like the universe\n\n01:46:59.500 --> 01:47:01.500\njust helping you make a movie.\n\n01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:03.500\nI think there's something worth noting,\n\n01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:05.500\nwhich is your legacy.\n\n01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:07.500\nOne of your kids\n\n01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:09.500\nis this really interesting\n\n01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:11.500\nand the description of their work\n\n01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:13.500\nis so\n\n01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:15.500\nthoroughly modern.\n\n01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:17.500\nShane is a disability rights activist.\n\n01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:19.500\nThey're a lawyer.\n\n01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:21.500\nDisability activist,\n\n01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:23.500\nbut also a whole\n\n01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:25.500\ntransgender activist.\n\n01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:31.500\nIt's as if you had a child\n\n01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:33.500\nthat became\n\n01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:35.500\na trans\n\n01:47:35.500 --> 01:47:37.500\nit's a trans thing, isn't it?\n\n01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:39.500\nIt's a trans human idea\n\n01:47:39.500 --> 01:47:41.500\nin a weird way.\n\n01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:43.500\nThere is something about that.\n\n01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:45.500\nSomething future future.\n\n01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:49.500\nI imagine that must make you\n\n01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:51.500\nproud.\n\n01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:53.500\nI don't want to assume\n\n01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:55.500\nme.\n\n01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:57.500\nI'm frightened of\n\n01:47:57.500 --> 01:47:59.500\nwhat they do these days.\n\n01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:01.500\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:03.500\nThey just won a big settlement\n\n01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:05.500\nagainst a place that\n\n01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:07.500\nuses electric shock on kids.\n\n01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:11.500\nAre they an autistic activist as well?\n\n01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:13.500\nYeah.\n\n01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:15.500\nAnd also about\n\n01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:17.500\nhow the mentally ill\n\n01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:19.500\nare treated.\n\n01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:21.500\nIt's not a pretty picture, of course.\n\n01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:23.500\nBut Shane does\n\n01:48:23.500 --> 01:48:25.500\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:27.500\nAnd I do feel like Shane\n\n01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:29.500\nin what they're doing\n\n01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:31.500\nis saying, I don't want to be\n\n01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:33.500\na human like other humans are.\n\n01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:35.500\nI am not a human like other humans are.\n\n01:48:35.500 --> 01:48:37.500\nBut what I am\n\n01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:39.500\nis they are autistic.\n\n01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:41.500\nThey have facial anomalies.\n\n01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:43.500\nThey don't look like other people.\n\n01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:45.500\nAnd that is an interesting experience that

good\n\n01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:41.500\nwell there's that guy, there's my partner\n\n01:55:41.500 --> 01:55:43.500\nthere's the other piston of this engine\n\n01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:45.500\nbut minus me\n\n01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:47.500\nyeah there was a moment where Paul was going to be\n\n01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:49.500\nno Paul had already done two movies in a row\n\n01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:51.500\nthat Paul was the biggest director\n\n01:55:51.500 --> 01:55:53.500\nin Hollywood for a moment and a half there\n\n01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:55.500\nbecause he'd done total recall\n\n01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:57.500\nhe's amazing\n\n01:55:57.500 --> 01:55:59.500\nhe clearly is\n\n01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:01.500\nand then he did showgirls\n\n01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:03.500\nthere was almost a moment where I thought\n\n01:56:03.500 --> 01:56:05.500\nhe won't do this movie because he can do anything\n\n01:56:05.500 --> 01:56:07.500\nand so when showgirls\n\n01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:09.500\ncrashed and burned a little it was kind of good for me\n\n01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:11.500\nand actually\n\n01:56:11.500 --> 01:56:13.500\nthe sort of neat
