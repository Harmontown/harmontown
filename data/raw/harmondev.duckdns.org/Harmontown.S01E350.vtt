00:00.000 --> 00:27.500
What if I told you there was nothing to be scared of?

00:27.500 --> 00:37.500
I'm going to show you what I'm going to show you.

00:37.500 --> 00:47.500
I'm going to show you what I'm going to show you.

00:47.500 --> 01:15.500
I'm going to show you what I'm going to show you.

01:15.500 --> 01:25.500
I'm going to show you what I'm going to show you.

01:25.500 --> 01:35.500
I'm going to show you what I'm going to show you.

01:35.500 --> 01:55.500
I'm going to show you what I'm going to show you.

01:55.500 --> 02:15.500
I'm going to show you what I'm going to show you.

02:15.500 --> 02:35.500
I'm going to show you what I'm going to show you.

02:35.500 --> 03:03.500
I'm going to show you what I'm going to show you.

03:03.500 --> 03:11.500
We have this culture in TV, no matter how modern and progressive we get,

03:11.500 --> 03:21.500
no matter how sensitive and gentle we become, underneath it all, all of the men and women.

03:21.500 --> 03:25.500
I think we pride ourselves on an almost militaristic mindset.

03:25.500 --> 03:35.500
We're doing something so important here that requires so much discipline and hierarchy and collaboration and intuitiveness.

03:35.500 --> 03:45.500
It simultaneously dehumanizes the people you work with while making them the most important people in the world.

03:45.500 --> 03:59.500
I don't know if it's just my narcissism or if this is a common thing that people experience with grief,

03:59.500 --> 04:05.500
but I just hear that someone is gone and then I'm immediately parsing it.

04:05.500 --> 04:09.500
What is wrong with me? What's wrong with me?

04:09.500 --> 04:13.500
What have I done? Why am I like this?

04:13.500 --> 04:19.500
Why do I not understand that every single human being on earth,

04:19.500 --> 04:25.500
like the ones you know, the ones you don't know, but especially the ones that you rely on every day,

04:25.500 --> 04:33.500
the people that you just, in the truest sense of the phrase, take for granted?

04:33.500 --> 04:41.500
Why is it so hard for us to go about our fucking day-to-day understanding that it's while very unlikely

04:41.500 --> 04:46.500
but perfectly possible that someone will be gone tomorrow?

04:46.500 --> 04:50.500
And why can't we treat everybody and ourselves?

04:50.500 --> 04:55.500
I don't just mean like, oh, I was mean to this guy.

04:55.500 --> 05:07.500
What I was was completely just, I just didn't regard him as anything other than a load-bearing pillar of what we were doing,

05:07.500 --> 05:16.500
that there would one day be some silly vacation to celebrate retirement or something, some opportunity,

05:16.500 --> 05:26.500
maybe even the funeral of a person that was supposed to go on some schedule that I apparently think death works on,

05:26.500 --> 05:32.500
where we would finally sit down and interact as human beings.

05:32.500 --> 05:40.500
That's my narcissism, parsing another person's death.

05:40.500 --> 05:52.500
It's all about me, I guess, but I just feel like I'm made of straw tonight.

05:52.500 --> 05:55.500
I feel like if I move too quickly, my hand will fly off.

05:55.500 --> 05:58.500
I just feel like everything is so delicate.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.500
How long did you know him for?

06:00.500 --> 06:06.500
Well, he's been there since the beginning, I mean since the moment that it became not a little pilot,

06:06.500 --> 06:14.500
a little idea to the moment that it needed to start pulling up its big boy pants and being on the air, he was there.

06:14.500 --> 06:24.500
And he was unmistakably the reason why we're able to take something so childish where there's people having me sign

06:24.500 --> 06:30.500
a corporate manufactured thing where the name of the character is Mr. Poopy Butthole.

06:30.500 --> 06:42.500
The reason why you can be that stupid and childish and yet be so lucrative, compatible with mainstream society

06:42.500 --> 06:47.500
is because the guy is making the trains run on time.

06:47.500 --> 06:52.500
It's coming to us from the Simpsons and the world of getting the job done.

06:52.500 --> 07:00.500
If everybody was like me and Justin, you'd be watching two episodes of Rick and Morty every eight years.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.500
And it was out of the blue. I don't think I've ever met him.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.500
Totally out of the blue.

07:04.500 --> 07:07.500
And Levi said he was with him yesterday and everything was fine.

07:07.500 --> 07:12.500
The crew went to the baseball game.

07:12.500 --> 07:23.500
The upside is that he was surrounded by co-workers and they were all having a great time.

07:23.500 --> 07:28.500
His wife and he just put a daughter in college and I just think it's such a rollercoaster ride.

07:28.500 --> 07:32.500
All of these things, I guess that's the bargaining phase of...

07:32.500 --> 07:33.500
Great for you.

07:33.500 --> 07:37.500
You're kind of like, well, good thing it doesn't have a kid that's like six.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.500
And then I'm like, are you kidding me?

07:39.500 --> 07:42.500
A young adult has to spend the...

07:42.500 --> 07:48.500
They're crossing a threshold into the rest of their life and you get this kneecap.

07:48.500 --> 07:52.500
There's a little hatch here.

07:52.500 --> 07:53.500
I do two things.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.500
I go numb and I get mad.

07:55.500 --> 08:01.500
And I think that comes from upbringing and there's a hatch here where if I were to open it,

08:01.500 --> 08:04.500
which I won't do because it's bad podcasting,

08:04.500 --> 08:10.500
it does have to do with thinking about his wife who Rob and I was one of the first people that we worked with.

08:10.500 --> 08:16.500
She was the casting director on Heat Vision and Jack and I'm just...

08:16.500 --> 08:18.500
They were two lovely people.

08:18.500 --> 08:21.500
They were just like great, wonderful people.

08:21.500 --> 08:25.500
It's that thought because then that connects to the idea of my God.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.500
What if something happened to Cody?

08:27.500 --> 08:29.500
What if something happened to me?

08:29.500 --> 08:35.500
It's just that I can't... I'm opening that hatch by saying I'm not opening that hatch.

08:35.500 --> 08:38.500
I can't go there.

08:38.500 --> 08:50.500
My deepest sympathies and condolences to his family and I guess that's...

08:50.500 --> 08:54.500
I felt like I'd be remiss in not saying that this happened,

08:54.500 --> 09:01.500
but at the same time, I could have said nothing.

09:01.500 --> 09:07.500
I don't consider it our job to stop the world and that doesn't do anybody any favors.

09:07.500 --> 09:10.500
I'm just very confused.

09:10.500 --> 09:14.500
I think there's one more thing that I would say about it,

09:14.500 --> 09:24.500
which is the continual frustration throughout the day of wanting someone to say something that finally makes sense,

09:24.500 --> 09:29.500
which I finally atoned with by around 3 p.m. today where I suddenly realized that,

09:29.500 --> 09:44.500
wait a minute, my big pet peeve with the deaths that we encounter is people making too much sense of them.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.500
I've talked about that here before.

09:47.500 --> 09:53.500
I was telling Dino today, Dino and I, no matter what we do until the day we finally die,

09:53.500 --> 10:00.500
and no matter how we die, if Dino or I walk under a piano and it falls on us,

10:00.500 --> 10:02.500
people are going to make sense of that death.

10:02.500 --> 10:07.500
They're going to go like, well, he had a problematic life and he was probably in the wrong place at the wrong time.

10:07.500 --> 10:12.500
That piano had his name on it, the way and the choices he made.

10:12.500 --> 10:20.500
That's my big pet peeve, in spite of the fact that as we all know, Dave Foley drinks 50 cups of coffee a day.

10:20.500 --> 10:27.500
There's an instinct in us that no matter what happens to Dave, if he lives to 110 grade,

10:27.500 --> 10:34.500
if something terrible happens tomorrow, we want it to make sense because we are afraid of death.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.500
This happened because of that.

10:36.500 --> 10:37.500
I got that figured out.

10:37.500 --> 10:43.500
I think the subtext of that is this really, really arrogant idea that all of us left

10:43.500 --> 10:50.500
belonged to some club that made the right decisions and that is really offensive.

10:50.500 --> 10:58.500
At least because it was so, it was like, I was getting angry about the nonsense of it.

10:58.500 --> 10:59.500
This is a healthy man.

10:59.500 --> 11:00.500
He played hockey.

11:00.500 --> 11:03.500
He was ripped, man.

11:03.500 --> 11:10.500
He was visceral.

11:10.500 --> 11:17.500
I'm like, someone tell me something and then I finally came around to, no, nobody tell me anything.

11:17.500 --> 11:20.500
Please, dear God, give me a senseless death.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.500
Give me a confusing one.

11:22.500 --> 11:28.500
Let me go quickly and let people be puzzled by it.

11:28.500 --> 11:35.500
I think that may be the equivalent of leaving a little pencil splash in the pool and an Olympic dive.

11:35.500 --> 11:43.500
If you know, just like no turbulence to the point where people are like, how'd that work?

11:43.500 --> 11:48.500
God speed you, Mike.

11:48.500 --> 11:59.500
Just to make it about me one more time, I can't believe that guy left this world.

11:59.500 --> 12:08.500
His story ends with Trump being president and me still working on a fucking draft of a script.

12:08.500 --> 12:21.500
I hope his last moments weren't fucking having to deal with my horrible bottleneck effect on production.

12:21.500 --> 12:29.500
Working on this fucking draft and he's the guy that has to, he's got to be the hero.

12:29.500 --> 12:34.500
He's got to absorb all that energy.

12:34.500 --> 12:50.500
I just hate myself for not turning that thing in, but it's stupid because getting to go to a baseball game is more important

12:50.500 --> 12:55.500
than he wasn't going to get joy out of me finishing a draft.

12:55.500 --> 12:58.500
I talked enough about that.

12:58.500 --> 13:06.500
I had one item on my list, but it was kind of like, I think maybe Spencer, that's probably for a Spencer night.

13:06.500 --> 13:10.500
I don't want you to feel left out.

13:10.500 --> 13:13.500
You're saving your best up for Spencer?

13:13.500 --> 13:21.500
I don't like this term hot swappable with hard drives.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.500
I just think it's a lie.

13:23.500 --> 13:31.500
You get a drive, like a little thing that, oh, this reads these kind of cards or these disks and it's hot swappable.

13:31.500 --> 13:36.500
And the implication there is that, oh, so I can poke a little stick into my computer.

13:36.500 --> 13:40.500
I can write some stuff on it and I can pop it out, throw it in the other thing that I want to think.

13:40.500 --> 13:43.500
And the computer won't go, hey, what are you doing?

13:43.500 --> 13:45.500
Oh, inject much.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.500
But it does do that no matter what.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.500
There is no such thing as a hot swappable drive.

13:50.500 --> 13:51.500
Thank you.

13:51.500 --> 13:55.500
I'll be Spencer for you during this.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.500
I think he just did it.

13:57.500 --> 13:58.500
That was it?

13:58.500 --> 13:59.500
Yeah.

13:59.500 --> 14:02.500
I was just going to add, yeah, man.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.500
Yeah, it's rough.

14:04.500 --> 14:05.500
Yeah.

14:05.500 --> 14:11.500
Yeah, what you really want to do is you get yourself a network card.

14:11.500 --> 14:12.500
Oh, man.

14:12.500 --> 14:13.500
Oh, man.

14:13.500 --> 14:17.500
You got real blazing speeds there, real blazing speeds.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.500
Where is he?

14:19.500 --> 14:20.500
Where is Spencer?

14:20.500 --> 14:22.500
Spencer goes from that low.

14:22.500 --> 14:23.500
Yeah, man.

14:23.500 --> 14:24.500
He's down here.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.500
But then he gets really up here.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.500
He's got a lot of range.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.500
I don't know where Spencer is.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.500
Are we worried about him?

14:32.500 --> 14:35.500
Well, he's not here and you're doing reverse.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.500
Hot swappable.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.500
Yeah.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.500
Maybe Spencer's hot swappable.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.500
He's just at a different podcast.

14:41.500 --> 14:46.500
I really hope this is not a long answer, but what is hot swapping?

14:46.500 --> 14:49.500
That's where you poop on somebody's chest, right?

14:49.500 --> 14:51.500
Well, I would say a stint.

14:51.500 --> 14:55.500
I think in general, the concept is just the idea of being able to...

14:55.500 --> 14:57.500
Steve Levy in the booze, everybody.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.500
Steve Levy.

14:59.500 --> 15:01.500
Hello, Steve.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.500
That's an option.

15:03.500 --> 15:04.500
Whatever.

15:04.500 --> 15:05.500
Spencer took the night off.

15:05.500 --> 15:06.500
Oh.

15:14.500 --> 15:15.500
What?

15:15.500 --> 15:19.500
Poor beleaguered saltmine worker, Rob Schrab.

15:19.500 --> 15:23.500
Oh, you owe your soul to the company store, right?

15:23.500 --> 15:25.500
This poor guy.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.500
That's an option.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.500
What are you, Fred Flintstone?

15:29.500 --> 15:31.500
Mr. Slate?

15:31.500 --> 15:33.500
I'm just whipping you.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.500
Yeah, I got to make you come talk to Ed Newmire,

15:36.500 --> 15:39.500
the author of the Robocop screenplay.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.500
That was an awkward way to introduce our guest.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.500
Let's bring out Ed Newmire.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.500
Hello, Ed.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.500
Hello.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.500
Dan, don't screw this up.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.500
This is really important to me tonight.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.500
I'm sorry about those awful chairs.

16:09.500 --> 16:13.500
Introduce or give him the, you know, the introduction

16:13.500 --> 16:16.500
that a fellow of his stature deserves.

16:16.500 --> 16:21.500
I mean, my introduction of you would be one of my rambling things

16:21.500 --> 16:23.500
or Jeff would cut me off and say, please welcome Ed Newmire

16:23.500 --> 16:25.500
in the middle of me trying to introduce you

16:25.500 --> 16:29.500
because I'd be like, look, we've had some legends up here.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.500
I get nervous.

16:31.500 --> 16:34.500
I am a bad interviewer.

16:34.500 --> 16:37.500
But there's a difference here where it's just like,

16:37.500 --> 16:40.500
genuinely you are a hero to me.

16:40.500 --> 16:45.500
You're a person that just exemplifies, like,

16:45.500 --> 16:48.500
not only to me what we'll talk about,

16:48.500 --> 16:50.500
whether you think this is true,

16:50.500 --> 16:55.500
but it demonstrates the highest kind of, like,

16:55.500 --> 17:01.500
coda of the craft of writing movies

17:01.500 --> 17:05.500
and also, like, demonstrates that that pays off,

17:05.500 --> 17:08.500
that you pick your shots and whatever.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.500
But let's get to know you a little bit

17:10.500 --> 17:14.500
because, God, I'm a bad interviewer.

17:14.500 --> 17:19.500
But I think that we'll go through the early biography.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.500
Like, are you a Californian?

17:21.500 --> 17:23.500
Were you born here?

17:23.500 --> 17:27.500
I was actually born in Vienna, Austria by Chance

17:27.500 --> 17:29.500
and I grew up in the Marin County,

17:29.500 --> 17:31.500
San Francisco Bay Area, Marin County.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.500
I grew up in San Samo.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.500
And you were a journalism major?

17:35.500 --> 17:37.500
Yeah, my parents were both journalists

17:37.500 --> 17:40.500
and so that followed me through high school.

17:40.500 --> 17:44.500
I was the editor of my high school newspaper.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.500
But I always wanted to do movies.

17:46.500 --> 17:49.500
Was there anything, too, because I was also a journalism major

17:49.500 --> 17:52.500
and my justification for it being from Wisconsin

17:52.500 --> 17:56.500
was that I couldn't possibly make the leap

17:56.500 --> 18:00.500
to, well, I'm going to major in writing.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.500
I'm going to be a writer.

18:02.500 --> 18:04.500
I'm going to be creative for a living.

18:04.500 --> 18:09.500
I had to find a Midwestern-compatible version

18:09.500 --> 18:11.500
of being a person that sits at a typewriter

18:11.500 --> 18:15.500
that also felt enough like welding to...

18:15.500 --> 18:18.500
Was there anything to that?

18:18.500 --> 18:20.500
It was kind of the first time I ever had a little thing

18:20.500 --> 18:22.500
where you could do something.

18:22.500 --> 18:25.500
And I immediately started turning it into a place to do...

18:25.500 --> 18:28.500
I used to do violent satires, like my friend

18:28.500 --> 18:30.500
who was the school president.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.500
We shot him in front of the school.

18:33.500 --> 18:36.500
We did Zapruder films and things like that.

18:36.500 --> 18:40.500
Certainly, propaganda is such a huge part

18:40.500 --> 18:42.500
of some of the most effective parts

18:42.500 --> 18:44.500
of the things you're most known for,

18:44.500 --> 18:47.500
like the groupers, like both really interesting things

18:47.500 --> 18:49.500
to talk about.

18:49.500 --> 18:53.500
But both of them have these Shakespearean heralds

18:53.500 --> 18:55.500
that are the media.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.500
And so I imagine...

18:57.500 --> 18:59.500
I think I was always interested in that stuff.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.500
And I was literally all my...

19:01.500 --> 19:04.500
Some of my friends now were my people who were...

19:04.500 --> 19:06.500
Like Woodward and Bernstein were big guys.

19:06.500 --> 19:09.500
And so I know the guys who knew them and stuff like that.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.500
I know a lot of journalists and that kind of thing.

19:11.500 --> 19:13.500
And that was an exciting idea.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.500
That here was the chorus.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.500
I don't know, it was an interesting device also.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.500
And it was cheap.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.500
You could do a lot of things without spending any money.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.500
It's the same as having a guy come out

19:23.500 --> 19:26.500
and explain the Montague's and the Capulets.

19:26.500 --> 19:29.500
They're just like, well, here's what's going on.

19:29.500 --> 19:33.500
But the more important thing is that unlike that guy,

19:33.500 --> 19:36.500
the world as a character...

19:36.500 --> 19:38.500
Detroit is a character in Robocop.

19:38.500 --> 19:41.500
It's so important to understand the relationship

19:41.500 --> 19:44.500
between people and media, what's going on in the world.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.500
And even though the whole story takes place

19:46.500 --> 19:49.500
in a really gritty, local part of this new earth,

19:49.500 --> 19:54.500
it's so effective to be able to zoom in

19:54.500 --> 19:56.500
from a global perspective.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.500
Right, and show other little parts of that world

19:58.500 --> 20:00.500
and imply a bigger world.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.500
And that was always there.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.500
And it was something that...

20:04.500 --> 20:06.500
I think Verhoeven had a big fight about that at one point

20:06.500 --> 20:08.500
because I always wanted it to be completely separate

20:08.500 --> 20:10.500
from the story, that it was different.

20:10.500 --> 20:14.500
One time he said, well, maybe we'll be in a TV studio

20:14.500 --> 20:16.500
and you'll see the news and you'll...

20:16.500 --> 20:18.500
And I was like, I don't know why I was this way.

20:18.500 --> 20:19.500
I was 27 years old.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.500
I was like, no, that's terrible. You can't do that.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.500
We had a huge fight about it.

20:23.500 --> 20:24.500
Oh, really?

20:24.500 --> 20:25.500
Yeah, and then he came around and he said,

20:25.500 --> 20:26.500
okay, all right, I get it.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.500
And then he said it was more...

20:28.500 --> 20:30.500
He said, oh, that's actually more modern.

20:30.500 --> 20:31.500
That's a really Brechtian idea.

20:31.500 --> 20:35.500
I don't think he said Brechtian, but it is a Brechtian idea.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.500
Okay, well, yeah, I'm kidding.

20:37.500 --> 20:40.500
So because part of this is your story is interesting

20:40.500 --> 20:42.500
because Robocop, correct me if I'm wrong,

20:42.500 --> 20:44.500
this is your first screen credit.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.500
It's your first project.

20:46.500 --> 20:47.500
Right.

20:47.500 --> 20:48.500
I came to the business.

20:48.500 --> 20:52.500
I went to UCLA Film School and then my girlfriend

20:52.500 --> 20:54.500
broke up with me and I couldn't finish UCLA's film school.

20:54.500 --> 20:59.500
But I got a job on taxi and they paid me $175 a month

20:59.500 --> 21:01.500
or something to be a runner.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.500
And I did that for a little while.

21:03.500 --> 21:06.500
You were a PA on taxi and which made us immediately go,

21:06.500 --> 21:08.500
oh, was there an intersection between you and Sam Simon?

21:08.500 --> 21:09.500
And the answer's no, but...

21:09.500 --> 21:11.500
No, no, but I did...

21:11.500 --> 21:14.500
I was the guy who used to sit outside the door

21:14.500 --> 21:16.500
and wait for the script pages.

21:16.500 --> 21:19.500
And I had to drive them to a place called Barber's Place

21:19.500 --> 21:21.500
and they typed them up and then I had to pick them up

21:21.500 --> 21:22.500
at six in the morning.

21:22.500 --> 21:23.500
And Barber's Place was what?

21:23.500 --> 21:24.500
It was a typing place.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.500
It was just where you typed your scripts up.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.500
This was before there were computers.

21:27.500 --> 21:28.500
Yeah.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.500
Oh, yeah, I need myself.

21:30.500 --> 21:31.500
They would type it.

21:31.500 --> 21:32.500
It's not a copy place.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.500
It was like they would just type them on.

21:34.500 --> 21:36.500
No, they would literally...

21:36.500 --> 21:38.500
There were a bunch of people who sat up, mostly women,

21:38.500 --> 21:40.500
who sat up all night and re-typed the scripts.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.500
And then they were delivered to the...

21:42.500 --> 21:45.500
They would take drafts with notes on them and stuff like that

21:45.500 --> 21:47.500
and just do a clean copy of them.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.500
Right, because there's no word processing.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.500
They would give them to a guy and they would drive them

21:51.500 --> 21:53.500
in their little car and then go pick up a box of scripts.

21:53.500 --> 21:55.500
We were talking about this afternoon,

21:55.500 --> 21:59.500
like how there were so many roadblocks back then.

21:59.500 --> 22:02.500
And people still got stuff done.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.500
Like, where is it today?

22:04.500 --> 22:06.500
It's like, oh, I can't connect with a Wi-Fi and print.

22:06.500 --> 22:07.500
Fuck it.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.500
Just fuck it.

22:08.500 --> 22:09.500
You know, it's like...

22:09.500 --> 22:10.500
I mean, including us, Jonathan.

22:10.500 --> 22:12.500
Yeah, we were talking today about, you know,

22:12.500 --> 22:15.500
as people tend to in the loss of a colleague,

22:15.500 --> 22:17.500
we're having drinks and we're suddenly going

22:17.500 --> 22:18.500
through our whole lives.

22:18.500 --> 22:21.500
And yeah, we were briefly marveling

22:21.500 --> 22:24.500
in how we had a radio show in Milwaukee

22:24.500 --> 22:26.500
and how we would get up at 5 a.m.,

22:26.500 --> 22:29.500
drink two pots of coffee, write five scripts,

22:29.500 --> 22:31.500
get in a car, drive them down icy roads

22:31.500 --> 22:34.500
to a Kinko's because they had a printer

22:34.500 --> 22:37.500
and pay them the money that they wanted

22:37.500 --> 22:40.500
to print up these scripts and then drive.

22:40.500 --> 22:42.500
It's like, yeah, I would never do that these days.

22:42.500 --> 22:43.500
Yeah.

22:43.500 --> 22:45.500
Anyways, but you...

22:45.500 --> 22:47.500
And then right from that PA job,

22:47.500 --> 22:55.500
it says your Wikipedia page is so joyfully Spartan.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.500
You're a proofreader at Paramount?

22:58.500 --> 23:00.500
No, I was a scriptreader.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.500
I was a reader in the Story Analyst Guild.

23:02.500 --> 23:04.500
And they pay people.

23:04.500 --> 23:05.500
You probably...

23:05.500 --> 23:06.500
Doing coverage?

23:06.500 --> 23:07.500
To do coverage for executives.

23:07.500 --> 23:09.500
And you read everything that comes in

23:09.500 --> 23:10.500
and you do a report on it.

23:10.500 --> 23:12.500
Yeah, they call a proofreader on your Wikipedia.

23:12.500 --> 23:13.500
You're going to...

23:13.500 --> 23:14.500
Yeah.

23:14.500 --> 23:15.500
Someone's going to bring the hammer down.

23:15.500 --> 23:17.500
Do you remember any of the scripts that you read that went,

23:17.500 --> 23:18.500
oh, this is great.

23:18.500 --> 23:19.500
Somebody...

23:19.500 --> 23:20.500
No, no, I did.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.500
I remember reading Star Wars.

23:21.500 --> 23:22.500
Star Wars.

23:22.500 --> 23:23.500
I read War Games and I said,

23:23.500 --> 23:24.500
you should make this movie.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.500
And they said, nobody wants to see a movie

23:26.500 --> 23:27.500
about nuclear war.

23:27.500 --> 23:36.500
And then you said, but I can get you Daphne Coleman.

23:36.500 --> 23:38.500
And then I read a script which I really...

23:38.500 --> 23:41.500
I made my reputation at Columbia Pictures on these...

23:41.500 --> 23:45.500
I read a risky business and I wrote a coverage for it.

23:45.500 --> 23:48.500
It was like 18 pages long, which is not what you want

23:48.500 --> 23:50.500
when you're an executive at the morning meeting.

23:50.500 --> 23:51.500
And I said, this is the greatest movie in the world.

23:51.500 --> 23:52.500
You have to make it.

23:52.500 --> 23:55.500
And there was a memo came around and said,

23:55.500 --> 23:58.500
Frank Price, the chairman, saying that there would no longer be

23:58.500 --> 24:00.500
any coverage longer than two pages.

24:00.500 --> 24:05.500
And then when the movie came out,

24:05.500 --> 24:07.500
they were interested in me suddenly.

24:07.500 --> 24:10.500
And when the movie came out, I bet somebody 100 bucks,

24:10.500 --> 24:12.500
the vice president, that it was going to be a hit.

24:12.500 --> 24:13.500
And it was.

24:13.500 --> 24:15.500
And then suddenly they offered me a job.

24:15.500 --> 24:19.500
And for a moment, I was an executive who had his finger

24:19.500 --> 24:21.500
on the pulse of youth.

24:21.500 --> 24:24.500
And that lasted for about a year at Universal.

24:24.500 --> 24:26.500
And I wasn't really suited for it.

24:26.500 --> 24:30.500
I read that you were offered to be the vice president at Universal.

24:30.500 --> 24:32.500
I was on a track.

24:32.500 --> 24:34.500
They called them CEs now.

24:34.500 --> 24:36.500
I was a junior executive.

24:36.500 --> 24:39.500
And that's sort of how I learned all the business stuff,

24:39.500 --> 24:40.500
if you will.

24:40.500 --> 24:41.500
And I was under a VP.

24:41.500 --> 24:44.500
And yes, if I had stayed there, I would have been a VP,

24:44.500 --> 24:46.500
which I later was at another production company,

24:46.500 --> 24:47.500
Martin Rantsehoff.

24:47.500 --> 24:50.500
I was the VP of development and stuff like that.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.500
And this is where it gets really interesting.

24:52.500 --> 24:56.500
And this is where I start to kind of worship you

24:56.500 --> 24:58.500
in the story of your path.

24:58.500 --> 25:04.500
Because in the underworld, where the werewolves of suits

25:04.500 --> 25:07.500
and the vampires of writers are in constant war,

25:07.500 --> 25:09.500
you can root for one or the other.

25:09.500 --> 25:12.500
And there's all kinds of hybrids that are exciting and heroic.

25:12.500 --> 25:14.500
But there is a war nonetheless.

25:14.500 --> 25:18.500
And so there is something really romantic about a guy

25:18.500 --> 25:20.500
that does what you did.

25:20.500 --> 25:24.500
You can just imagine the biopic tee-up of this moment,

25:24.500 --> 25:29.500
where you have this easier, you know, you're on this path.

25:29.500 --> 25:32.500
And then for whatever reason, you decide,

25:32.500 --> 25:36.500
no, I'd like to go behind door number two.

25:36.500 --> 25:42.500
I'm going to abandon this career of being liked,

25:42.500 --> 25:46.500
being on the side that calls the shots, makes the money.

25:46.500 --> 25:49.500
Because I'm really passionate about this idea.

25:49.500 --> 25:55.500
I had called Robocop.

25:55.500 --> 25:57.500
It's true.

25:57.500 --> 26:00.500
During this period, I thought, I'm really not this guy.

26:00.500 --> 26:02.500
I don't want to have...

26:02.500 --> 26:05.500
I wasn't good at returning 100 phone calls a day.

26:05.500 --> 26:07.500
And there were people who were.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.500
There were people I really admired who really were good at that.

26:09.500 --> 26:11.500
Some of them are good writers, too.

26:11.500 --> 26:15.500
I mean, Mike Waldron, a shout out to him,

26:15.500 --> 26:19.500
he was kind of an Ed Newmeyer at Star Burns,

26:19.500 --> 26:22.500
my little studio where it was like,

26:22.500 --> 26:24.500
you hire young people,

26:24.500 --> 26:27.500
and you make them do the stuff you're too busy to do.

26:27.500 --> 26:30.500
Some of it is reading other people's stuff, taking...

26:30.500 --> 26:35.500
It's like, he's a very handsome kid from Georgia,

26:35.500 --> 26:37.500
and people like talking to him,

26:37.500 --> 26:39.500
and he doesn't mind talking on the phone,

26:39.500 --> 26:40.500
and I remember him saying to me,

26:40.500 --> 26:43.500
just so you remember, I did come out here to be a writer,

26:43.500 --> 26:45.500
and I was like, too bad, you're a daywalker.

26:45.500 --> 26:48.500
Like, Whistler's got more plans for you.

26:48.500 --> 26:51.500
But I will return the favor to you

26:51.500 --> 26:55.500
if you do this shitty neurotypical stuff.

26:55.500 --> 26:58.500
I will help you as much as I can.

26:58.500 --> 27:01.500
And it amazes me that some people are just good at both,

27:01.500 --> 27:04.500
that there are charming people who...

27:04.500 --> 27:06.500
Yeah, they're good writers.

27:06.500 --> 27:09.500
They're just cursed with this networking ability.

27:09.500 --> 27:11.500
You know, I don't think I really did.

27:11.500 --> 27:12.500
I wasn't comfortable with that.

27:12.500 --> 27:15.500
I was never... I never felt cool enough for the job.

27:15.500 --> 27:17.500
And when I meet executives over time,

27:17.500 --> 27:19.500
they all seem much cooler than I ever was.

27:19.500 --> 27:23.500
Do you buy into the dichotomy of the introvert versus the extrovert,

27:23.500 --> 27:27.500
where it's like the introvert is recharging their batteries

27:27.500 --> 27:31.500
while they're alone, while they're operating individually,

27:31.500 --> 27:35.500
and they don't mind interacting with other people,

27:35.500 --> 27:36.500
but that's a discharge.

27:36.500 --> 27:39.500
And then there are some people who are actually receiving

27:39.500 --> 27:42.500
an energy charge from of all things

27:42.500 --> 27:44.500
interacting with other people.

27:44.500 --> 27:47.500
And it gets them through having to play Minecraft,

27:47.500 --> 27:48.500
which blows my fucking mind.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.500
They're just sitting there,

27:49.500 --> 27:51.500
so I hope the phone rings.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.500
That's you.

27:53.500 --> 27:56.500
When you're sitting at home, you're like,

27:56.500 --> 27:58.500
God damn it.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.500
I get ants in my pants.

28:00.500 --> 28:02.500
I gotta go out and be around the people.

28:02.500 --> 28:06.500
So then you can recharge and get through those lonely nights

28:06.500 --> 28:09.500
between the sticks calling you

28:09.500 --> 28:13.500
and having you come out to a concert.

28:13.500 --> 28:18.500
I don't think we talked about my tour with sticks enough.

28:18.500 --> 28:20.500
I replaced Tommy's shot.

28:20.500 --> 28:21.500
No, that's a...

28:21.500 --> 28:22.500
Okay, come on.

28:22.500 --> 28:23.500
Yeah, I am an extrovert.

28:23.500 --> 28:26.500
I don't think I need other people to totally recharge,

28:26.500 --> 28:27.500
but I do...

28:27.500 --> 28:28.500
I don't know.

28:28.500 --> 28:31.500
I think it's both ways.

28:31.500 --> 28:32.500
I need to be alone,

28:32.500 --> 28:34.500
but I also need to be around people.

28:34.500 --> 28:37.500
And both of those are...

28:37.500 --> 28:39.500
Recharge and discharge in a way.

28:39.500 --> 28:40.500
Well, okay.

28:40.500 --> 28:41.500
All right, so...

28:41.500 --> 28:42.500
Come on, man.

28:42.500 --> 28:43.500
You figured out a way to be...

28:43.500 --> 28:45.500
You don't have to choose one or the other.

28:45.500 --> 28:47.500
I'm not sure if I can answer this right,

28:47.500 --> 28:49.500
but what I would say is...

28:49.500 --> 28:50.500
I always want to...

28:50.500 --> 28:51.500
When I was...

28:51.500 --> 28:53.500
Many years ago, when I wrote Robocop,

28:53.500 --> 28:54.500
and when it was successful,

28:54.500 --> 28:56.500
there were times that I would entertain myself

28:56.500 --> 28:58.500
of thinking, well, I did this and I did that.

28:58.500 --> 29:00.500
I did that and I did that.

29:00.500 --> 29:01.500
Like thinking about...

29:01.500 --> 29:03.500
And then now, more and more,

29:03.500 --> 29:05.500
I think, well, no, I did that because Paul was there,

29:05.500 --> 29:07.500
and we talked about this.

29:07.500 --> 29:09.500
And we did this because John Davidson said,

29:09.500 --> 29:11.500
well, you can have 25 cents to do that

29:11.500 --> 29:12.500
and some 10-foil.

29:12.500 --> 29:14.500
And there were a lot of people involved in that process

29:14.500 --> 29:16.500
that made it what it was.

29:16.500 --> 29:23.500
Age sweetens the recognition of the myth...

29:23.500 --> 29:25.500
That the auteur myth is an auteur.

29:25.500 --> 29:27.500
You start to open up to...

29:27.500 --> 29:29.500
So Verhoeven and I get together,

29:29.500 --> 29:31.500
and we've been getting together for 35 years,

29:31.500 --> 29:33.500
and we've done most of our work over breakfast.

29:33.500 --> 29:35.500
And we get together now still.

29:35.500 --> 29:36.500
We just did recently.

29:36.500 --> 29:37.500
And the last time we got together,

29:37.500 --> 29:39.500
all we did was talk about what a great producer

29:39.500 --> 29:40.500
John Davidson was

29:40.500 --> 29:42.500
and how the movie never would have happened

29:42.500 --> 29:44.500
without John Davidson in a million different ways.

29:44.500 --> 29:47.500
Now, John and Paul didn't even speak during the movie.

29:47.500 --> 29:50.500
They couldn't even talk to each other in the room.

29:50.500 --> 29:53.500
I was the middle child who would try to get the parents

29:53.500 --> 29:54.500
to come in and talk,

29:54.500 --> 29:56.500
and then they would run out after cursing at each other.

29:56.500 --> 29:58.500
But now, they realize that it was...

29:58.500 --> 30:00.500
Well, I think they even did then.

30:00.500 --> 30:02.500
When you wrote it,

30:02.500 --> 30:04.500
did you always, while you were writing this,

30:04.500 --> 30:07.500
because this is going to be called Robocop?

30:07.500 --> 30:08.500
I did.

30:08.500 --> 30:11.500
No, no, it never ever happened to me since,

30:11.500 --> 30:13.500
but it actually...

30:13.500 --> 30:15.500
I was working as a reader,

30:15.500 --> 30:18.500
and then Columbia Pictures was out,

30:18.500 --> 30:19.500
not in Culver City,

30:19.500 --> 30:22.500
but it was in Burbank on a lot called TBS then,

30:22.500 --> 30:24.500
which is now known as the Warner Brothers Lot.

30:24.500 --> 30:26.500
And I had an office right next to the...

30:26.500 --> 30:27.500
It was a trailer office,

30:27.500 --> 30:29.500
and it was right next to one of the big backlots.

30:29.500 --> 30:31.500
And suddenly, they were making this giant picture,

30:31.500 --> 30:33.500
this giant science fiction picture,

30:33.500 --> 30:35.500
which no one would tell you what it was.

30:35.500 --> 30:36.500
And I would get out of...

30:36.500 --> 30:37.500
I would leave my office,

30:37.500 --> 30:39.500
and I would go out onto the set.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.500
And what I really wanted to do in those days was make a movie.

30:41.500 --> 30:43.500
And there were so many people on this movie

30:43.500 --> 30:45.500
that they didn't know who was working on it and who wasn't.

30:45.500 --> 30:46.500
They were shooting all night,

30:46.500 --> 30:48.500
and so I would go and work on the art department

30:48.500 --> 30:51.500
and stay there until about three or four in the morning.

30:51.500 --> 30:52.500
And I said,

30:52.500 --> 30:53.500
so what's the first night?

30:53.500 --> 30:54.500
What's this movie about?

30:54.500 --> 30:55.500
And it's about a robot,

30:55.500 --> 30:57.500
and they pointed at a girl in a tutu

30:57.500 --> 30:59.500
and said, that's a robot.

30:59.500 --> 31:01.500
And it was Blade Runner.

31:01.500 --> 31:03.500
And then I watched them shoot someone Blade Runner.

31:03.500 --> 31:05.500
I was on that set.

31:05.500 --> 31:06.500
It was extraordinary.

31:06.500 --> 31:07.500
I'd never seen anything like it.

31:07.500 --> 31:10.500
And then about three o'clock in the morning,

31:10.500 --> 31:12.500
one night, I sort of had this idea

31:12.500 --> 31:15.500
of what I thought a robot should look like on that street.

31:15.500 --> 31:17.500
And it was looking...

31:17.500 --> 31:19.500
It was a robot that looked a little like Robocop.

31:19.500 --> 31:21.500
And it was next to that blue car.

31:21.500 --> 31:23.500
They call it the spinner.

31:23.500 --> 31:26.500
And suddenly, the title just...

31:26.500 --> 31:29.500
came into my mind, like Robocop.

31:29.500 --> 31:30.500
Boom.

31:30.500 --> 31:31.500
And it was really weird.

31:31.500 --> 31:33.500
And I think it's the power of location.

31:33.500 --> 31:34.500
I truly do.

31:34.500 --> 31:35.500
If you are on a...

31:35.500 --> 31:36.500
It's very...

31:36.500 --> 31:37.500
At least for me, location and architecture

31:37.500 --> 31:38.500
and things like that,

31:38.500 --> 31:40.500
are very creative ideas come to me in that.

31:40.500 --> 31:43.500
And I think that was such a supercharged set

31:43.500 --> 31:45.500
for a young man to be on, like...

31:45.500 --> 31:48.500
Now, looking backwards through...

31:48.500 --> 31:51.500
So that kid who's having that moment is like,

31:51.500 --> 31:53.500
okay, I think I'm gonna write this movie.

31:53.500 --> 31:54.500
It's gonna be called Robocop.

31:54.500 --> 31:55.500
I don't want him to be in a tutu.

31:55.500 --> 31:56.500
I want him to...

31:56.500 --> 31:58.500
Whatever happened to the...

31:58.500 --> 32:01.500
It's a very Schrabby sounding thing.

32:01.500 --> 32:02.500
This is Rob Schrab.

32:02.500 --> 32:03.500
I'm Rob Schrab.

32:03.500 --> 32:08.500
To be like, come on, it's a robot.

32:08.500 --> 32:09.500
Hello.

32:09.500 --> 32:12.500
If you knock on it, your hand should hurt.

32:18.500 --> 32:20.500
And after like 30 years, it becomes a...

32:20.500 --> 32:23.500
That was the original poster.

32:23.500 --> 32:27.500
The poster for you kids was Robocop climbing out of the car

32:27.500 --> 32:29.500
and the poster said,

32:29.500 --> 32:33.500
part man, part machine, all cop.

32:33.500 --> 32:35.500
And I remember being 15 and I was like,

32:35.500 --> 32:37.500
here's the thing is that until you see that movie,

32:37.500 --> 32:38.500
until you see a frame of it,

32:38.500 --> 32:41.500
I mean, you're a wash in a world of like,

32:41.500 --> 32:44.500
oh, Spielberg came out with six pieces of crap,

32:44.500 --> 32:46.500
one of them will stick and write history.

32:46.500 --> 32:47.500
And you're very...

32:47.500 --> 32:49.500
You're jaded even back then.

32:49.500 --> 32:50.500
And you have permission to be jaded.

32:50.500 --> 32:52.500
And I saw that poster and I was like,

32:52.500 --> 32:53.500
this is...

32:53.500 --> 32:55.500
This misses the mark.

32:55.500 --> 32:56.500
This is silly.

32:56.500 --> 32:57.500
What do they mean Robocop?

32:57.500 --> 32:59.500
Like Schrab said backstage.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.500
It sounds like a kid's movie.

33:01.500 --> 33:04.500
Now, this is the difficult part of the question.

33:04.500 --> 33:07.500
So this kid who's visualizing this,

33:07.500 --> 33:11.500
at that point, where are you at tonally?

33:11.500 --> 33:14.500
Are you thinking to yourself...

33:14.500 --> 33:19.500
That part of the point of it is that it's going to be

33:19.500 --> 33:23.500
a disarming like hypodermic for some seriously

33:23.500 --> 33:26.500
like potent kind of edge?

33:26.500 --> 33:29.500
Or are you simply at that time going like,

33:29.500 --> 33:31.500
gee whiz robots are swell?

33:31.500 --> 33:32.500
Yeah, no, no.

33:32.500 --> 33:35.500
I think the answer is there were two levels going on.

33:35.500 --> 33:38.500
There was this has to be a movie for eight year olds or whatever.

33:38.500 --> 33:41.500
And this has to be a movie for people who were thinking.

33:41.500 --> 33:43.500
And it can be both of those things at the same time.

33:43.500 --> 33:45.500
I don't think I immediately thought that.

33:45.500 --> 33:48.500
What I thought was I want to make a movie about business

33:48.500 --> 33:51.500
and how the corporate world is a dangerous world.

33:51.500 --> 33:54.500
I wanted to see businessmen killing each other.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.500
And that that was because...

33:56.500 --> 33:57.500
You weren't thinking that.

33:57.500 --> 33:58.500
I was thinking that.

33:58.500 --> 33:59.500
Oh, okay, sorry.

33:59.500 --> 34:01.500
That's what I was really thinking about the time

34:01.500 --> 34:02.500
was before robots even was,

34:02.500 --> 34:04.500
oh, I want to do a world about business

34:04.500 --> 34:06.500
where executives actually kill each other.

34:06.500 --> 34:09.500
And so that title, the idea that would always be called that title,

34:09.500 --> 34:12.500
and the fact that that title sounds a little silly.

34:12.500 --> 34:15.500
From the very beginning, that was all as designed.

34:15.500 --> 34:19.500
You were thinking, it's like naming your movie

34:19.500 --> 34:23.500
like Mr. Stretchy or something.

34:23.500 --> 34:25.500
It's kind of like supposed to sound childish.

34:25.500 --> 34:27.500
I used to say it's good.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.500
I used to say, oh, that's really stupid.

34:29.500 --> 34:30.500
Meaning that's really good.

34:30.500 --> 34:31.500
That's really wonderful.

34:31.500 --> 34:32.500
Fucking love it.

34:32.500 --> 34:33.500
Fucking love it.

34:33.500 --> 34:34.500
Fucking love it.

34:34.500 --> 34:37.500
That was my big go-to was, oh, that's kind of stupid.

34:37.500 --> 34:38.500
Let's do that.

34:38.500 --> 34:41.500
Monster House.

34:42.500 --> 34:44.500
The house is a monster.

34:44.500 --> 34:48.500
Kung Fu Panda.

34:48.500 --> 34:50.500
But it did imply another part of this world

34:50.500 --> 34:52.500
that also had to support all of that.

34:52.500 --> 34:55.500
And the more difficult part of it was to convince people

34:55.500 --> 34:57.500
that it could be funny.

34:57.500 --> 34:59.500
Everybody wanted it to be straight.

34:59.500 --> 35:02.500
And it was, I always knew it would have impact.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.500
But I really had this theory,

35:04.500 --> 35:06.500
maybe someone else had had it,

35:06.500 --> 35:08.500
but as a young man trying to figure out how to write a screenplay,

35:08.500 --> 35:12.500
I had this idea that if you had a really, really violent scene

35:12.500 --> 35:15.500
that was shocking, and then you told a joke,

35:15.500 --> 35:17.500
even a bad one afterwards, it would be much funnier.

35:17.500 --> 35:20.500
And that was one of the things that was invested throughout writing.

35:20.500 --> 35:23.500
When I think of the movies, we all love this movie to pieces.

35:23.500 --> 35:27.500
We always talk about what are the few, like,

35:27.500 --> 35:30.500
handful of just perfect movies that you wouldn't take anything out of

35:30.500 --> 35:31.500
or add anything to.

35:31.500 --> 35:35.500
And Robocop is for us definitely one of those movies.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.500
I think it's very sad.

35:37.500 --> 35:40.500
It's an incredibly sad film.

35:40.500 --> 35:43.500
At the core, it's a really depressing story.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.500
And it's really about how he's...

35:45.500 --> 35:49.500
I remember I was, I think what you do when you do something the first time

35:49.500 --> 35:52.500
or what I often hear other people talking about

35:52.500 --> 35:55.500
is you're kind of making up your own rules for how you do something

35:55.500 --> 35:57.500
and you have to figure it out yourself.

35:57.500 --> 36:00.500
And that was really, that was me trying to figure out something.

36:00.500 --> 36:01.500
How does three acts work?

36:01.500 --> 36:03.500
Here's the beginning, middle, and the end.

36:03.500 --> 36:04.500
I mean, boy, you've lost.

36:04.500 --> 36:07.500
You wielded the fucking...

36:07.500 --> 36:09.500
It's really intimidating

36:09.500 --> 36:10.500
because I actually...

36:10.500 --> 36:12.500
God damn it.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.500
I still haven't...

36:14.500 --> 36:17.500
I still can't write a decent three act story.

36:17.500 --> 36:25.500
And part of my training was trying to get Sid Field's stuff to work for me

36:25.500 --> 36:30.500
by deconstructing Robocop and Die Hard really specifically.

36:30.500 --> 36:34.500
And even more so than Die Hard,

36:34.500 --> 36:40.500
which I really fetishize a great deal on this stage.

36:40.500 --> 36:43.500
Robocop is just...

36:43.500 --> 36:48.500
It's uncanny the structural integrity of that story.

36:48.500 --> 36:51.500
Can I ask a bunch of questions here, please?

36:51.500 --> 36:54.500
Okay, so...

36:54.500 --> 36:56.500
What's it like to kiss a girl?

36:56.500 --> 36:58.500
Shut up. Just shut up.

36:58.500 --> 37:01.500
Just shut your mouth.

37:01.500 --> 37:02.500
Don't listen to him.

37:02.500 --> 37:03.500
It wasn't me.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.500
Shut up.

37:05.500 --> 37:09.500
So how many drafts of this?

37:09.500 --> 37:13.500
I mean, you wrote it, you unspec,

37:13.500 --> 37:16.500
did you do multiple drafts before you started handing it around?

37:16.500 --> 37:21.500
Did you start doing multiple drafts when John Davidson and Paul Verhoeven got involved?

37:21.500 --> 37:25.500
I have a partner on this, so let me get to that.

37:25.500 --> 37:31.500
So the way it worked was I was sort of a semi-miserable junior executive at Universal,

37:31.500 --> 37:34.500
and I was trying to meet people that were interesting to me.

37:34.500 --> 37:39.500
So I actually put the word out to UCLA film schools, particularly because I'd been there,

37:39.500 --> 37:42.500
that anybody who wanted to come in and talk to me could.

37:42.500 --> 37:46.500
And so all these people who didn't pay any attention to me before came to see me,

37:46.500 --> 37:50.500
among the Michael Miner, who was seven years older than I was,

37:50.500 --> 37:53.500
and he was kind of a star at UCLA.

37:53.500 --> 37:56.500
He made a movie and he had been a DP,

37:56.500 --> 37:59.500
and he said, what do you want to do?

37:59.500 --> 38:02.500
Well, I'm working on this movie about a robot, and I told him,

38:02.500 --> 38:05.500
it's called Robocop, and it's about a robot, and I told him the story,

38:05.500 --> 38:07.500
and he was like, oh, let's do that.

38:07.500 --> 38:09.500
And I didn't really have anything much better on.

38:09.500 --> 38:11.500
I had slowed down a little bit with it.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.500
It was taking me about a year since I had done it.

38:13.500 --> 38:17.500
So I said, OK, why don't we write a script together?

38:17.500 --> 38:23.500
And I had it fairly well outlined the first act, as it is now, more or less.

38:23.500 --> 38:27.500
And the ending was there, and the middle was a little bit more of a mess.

38:27.500 --> 38:32.500
And the first thing I did was I kind of wanted to write the first act on my own.

38:32.500 --> 38:34.500
I didn't want to hurt Michael's feelings, but I didn't know him that well yet,

38:34.500 --> 38:36.500
and I wanted to make sure I was getting it.

38:36.500 --> 38:43.500
And so I told my bosses at Universal that my grandfather had died.

38:43.500 --> 38:45.500
He had died a long time ago.

38:45.500 --> 38:46.500
So it wasn't a lie.

38:46.500 --> 38:47.500
He died in World War II.

38:47.500 --> 38:50.500
I had to go, and I went back to San Enselmo where I grew up,

38:50.500 --> 38:53.500
and a friend had left me their house to work on,

38:53.500 --> 38:57.500
and I wrote the first act in about two weeks.

38:57.500 --> 39:01.500
And during that time, they sent me flowers, which I felt really bad about.

39:01.500 --> 39:05.500
And when I came back, I had to go back to work, and I stopped working.

39:05.500 --> 39:07.500
And then we kind of finished it on nights and weekends,

39:07.500 --> 39:09.500
but the first act sort of set the tone.

39:09.500 --> 39:14.500
And then we had a really rough draft, and we gave it to some friends.

39:14.500 --> 39:17.500
And I gave it to, I had made friends who knew a guy named John Davison,

39:17.500 --> 39:20.500
who had done Airplane, and I had heard about him.

39:20.500 --> 39:23.500
John Davison was a particular character, had a particular way of speaking,

39:23.500 --> 39:25.500
and everybody would imitate the way he talked.

39:25.500 --> 39:28.500
And I could even kind of talk like him before I met him.

39:28.500 --> 39:32.500
But when I had the script, I gave it to a friend of his,

39:32.500 --> 39:36.500
a director named Jonathan Kaplan, that a friend of a friend knew,

39:36.500 --> 39:38.500
hoping that he would give it to John Davison.

39:38.500 --> 39:40.500
And he did give it to John Davison.

39:40.500 --> 39:42.500
He said John Davison would be perfect for this.

39:42.500 --> 39:45.500
And it was sort of amazing because John Davison was perfect for it,

39:45.500 --> 39:46.500
for a whole bunch of reasons.

39:46.500 --> 39:48.500
Wait, wait, he did Airplane.

39:48.500 --> 39:49.500
He did Airplane?

39:49.500 --> 39:51.500
That seems like a weird fit.

39:51.500 --> 39:53.500
Well, except it was funny.

39:53.500 --> 39:55.500
And I wanted this to be funny.

39:55.500 --> 39:56.500
So I think that was helpful.

39:56.500 --> 39:58.500
Other people read it, and they thought it was serious,

39:58.500 --> 39:59.500
and they thought it should be serious.

39:59.500 --> 40:00.500
He was the only one who said,

40:00.500 --> 40:02.500
ah, this could be funny, you know?

40:02.500 --> 40:04.500
And he had the cash, he had proven that...

40:04.500 --> 40:06.500
Well, he had a deal with Orion.

40:06.500 --> 40:09.500
He was a really, he is a very, a penurious producer.

40:09.500 --> 40:11.500
He makes everything as cheap as he can.

40:11.500 --> 40:12.500
Penurious.

40:12.500 --> 40:13.500
Penurious.

40:13.500 --> 40:15.500
That's a new word for me.

40:15.500 --> 40:17.500
Not a new word for any of those languages.

40:17.500 --> 40:20.500
I just the first time I've ever heard that word.

40:20.500 --> 40:21.500
He's not just a writer.

40:21.500 --> 40:23.500
He makes up words all the time.

40:23.500 --> 40:27.500
At what point did the prime directives like start coming in?

40:27.500 --> 40:32.500
Because I want to talk about the ending at one point, because...

40:32.500 --> 40:33.500
Well, how about later?

40:33.500 --> 40:35.500
It's an ending.

40:35.500 --> 40:36.500
That's why he says later.

40:36.500 --> 40:38.500
Here's what, I'll pitch you what I want to talk about.

40:38.500 --> 40:40.500
You can tell us who's a better...

40:42.500 --> 40:46.500
Well, I'm so curious about now the Verhoeven entering this picture,

40:46.500 --> 40:49.500
because I'm picturing the producers and it's springtime for Hitler.

40:49.500 --> 40:54.500
Verhoeven character enters the story.

40:54.500 --> 40:56.500
Let me fast forward to this.

40:56.500 --> 40:58.500
We get set up.

40:58.500 --> 41:04.500
We get a deal at Orion, which is a big deal for people who have never done anything before.

41:04.500 --> 41:08.500
We go over there and they give us some notes.

41:08.500 --> 41:14.500
One of the notes was somehow the bad guy Clarence and the guy at the top, Dick Jones,

41:14.500 --> 41:16.500
should be somehow joined.

41:16.500 --> 41:18.500
That was the only real work we took from them.

41:18.500 --> 41:19.500
That's a good note.

41:19.500 --> 41:20.500
It was a good note.

41:20.500 --> 41:22.500
And so we wrote a second draft.

41:22.500 --> 41:26.500
And midway through the draft, I turned to Michael and I said,

41:26.500 --> 41:28.500
Michael, this can be funny.

41:28.500 --> 41:30.500
It's okay if it's funny.

41:30.500 --> 41:33.500
And we started having fun writing a script.

41:33.500 --> 41:36.500
Now, that has never happened to me since and hadn't happened to me before.

41:36.500 --> 41:39.500
But it was fun for about two weeks.

41:39.500 --> 41:43.500
And we laughed and we made jokes and we couldn't believe how entertaining we were.

41:43.500 --> 41:45.500
And we wrote it pretty well.

41:45.500 --> 41:50.500
Is that where the absurd elements, I'd buy that for a dollar, runner, or is that?

41:50.500 --> 41:54.500
I'd have to look and see.

41:54.500 --> 41:56.500
I'd buy that for a dollar.

41:56.500 --> 42:00.500
I had spent some time at Paramount around all the Gary Marshall sitcoms.

42:00.500 --> 42:04.500
So that was my attempt at coming up with a tagline for a...

42:04.500 --> 42:08.500
By the way, when your system is shocked, and we all know this from writing a roller coaster,

42:08.500 --> 42:14.500
I mean, not only are you having this weird, like, why am I laughing? I'm terrified.

42:14.500 --> 42:19.500
So we're already familiar with, like, you can get a good laugh out of somebody who's scared shitless

42:19.500 --> 42:21.500
or upset just like...

42:21.500 --> 42:22.500
Yeah, it's a pressure release.

42:22.500 --> 42:24.500
Traumatized, absolutely.

42:24.500 --> 42:29.500
But it also occurs to me that it works the opposite way, too.

42:29.500 --> 42:35.500
The villains in Robocop are especially traumatizing.

42:35.500 --> 42:41.500
And therefore, you're very immersed in Peter Weller's character, Murphy, who becomes Robocop.

42:41.500 --> 42:51.500
Like, his conduit to becoming Robocop is a horrible, violent trend.

42:51.500 --> 42:57.500
And it's absolutely more horrific because these guys are goofballs.

42:57.500 --> 43:00.500
They fancy themselves real cut-ups.

43:00.500 --> 43:11.500
And their leader, played by Kirkwood Smith, is like, I had never seen a receding hairline guy

43:11.500 --> 43:16.500
with glasses playing a villain in an action movie.

43:16.500 --> 43:21.500
That counted as diversity back then.

43:21.500 --> 43:27.500
Because he looked like he should be giving James Bond his weapons in a lab, and he's the big bad.

43:27.500 --> 43:35.500
He was so effective, the sway he held over his minions, the way they interacted with each other,

43:35.500 --> 43:41.500
the fact that they watched television and enjoyed it, that they went in and out of being grody.

43:41.500 --> 43:43.500
It was just, you felt...

43:43.500 --> 43:45.500
He taught Bobby how to fly?

43:45.500 --> 43:46.500
You felt so...

43:46.500 --> 43:48.500
Well, that's an example.

43:48.500 --> 43:53.500
Yeah, I mean, he's not gonna slow his adrenaline junkiness down.

43:53.500 --> 43:59.500
He's throwing one of his minions, the thing, but it was just like, you're watching Peter Weller go into that warehouse,

43:59.500 --> 44:03.500
and if you're watching this movie a sixth, seventh, eight hundredth time,

44:03.500 --> 44:15.500
you're now realizing that this first act has been so cold riveted tightly that the corporate story has been mentioning offhand.

44:15.500 --> 44:18.500
Yes, we've been relocating candidates according to risk factor,

44:18.500 --> 44:24.500
and that you're going like, oh, God, and Peter Weller was available...

44:24.500 --> 44:26.500
Murphy was available for that job.

44:26.500 --> 44:29.500
He was a candidate that was relocated according to risk factor.

44:29.500 --> 44:30.500
Why?

44:30.500 --> 44:33.500
Because his kid loves TJ Laser.

44:33.500 --> 44:34.500
He wants to...

44:34.500 --> 44:38.500
Nancy Allen asks him, what are you doing with your gun?

44:38.500 --> 44:42.500
He's like, well, I just want to learn this thing.

44:42.500 --> 44:45.500
So is that the desire of the character to be a good cop?

44:45.500 --> 44:46.500
Yeah.

44:46.500 --> 44:47.500
I think it is, actually.

44:47.500 --> 44:48.500
To be a cowboy.

44:48.500 --> 44:52.500
I was looking at your story cycle, and I thought, oh, the scene where he says,

44:52.500 --> 44:56.500
my kid wants me to be a good cop, and all good cops do that.

44:56.500 --> 44:57.500
He has...

44:57.500 --> 45:02.500
We're going to find out through ghostly flashbacks as this character that we become is trapped in this metal cage,

45:02.500 --> 45:06.500
but we'll find out that he actually had an idyllic life.

45:06.500 --> 45:11.500
We can only speculate that it wasn't enough for him for what reason.

45:11.500 --> 45:17.500
God, the best reason of all, not because he was tired of fucking his beautiful wife, not because he wished he had more money,

45:17.500 --> 45:21.500
because he felt like maybe he was failing as a dad.

45:21.500 --> 45:25.500
And I would say the subtext there was like, you're seeing the flashbacks.

45:25.500 --> 45:26.500
The kid is watching television.

45:26.500 --> 45:28.500
He's watching TJ Laser.

45:28.500 --> 45:33.500
These days, what that would be is the kid was so absorbed in his iPad,

45:33.500 --> 45:39.500
or he was literally jacked into some video game, and it was like, how can I reach this kid?

45:39.500 --> 45:43.500
I want to become a bigger-than-life thing.

45:43.500 --> 45:48.500
I want this kid to understand that law enforcement can be heroic,

45:48.500 --> 45:53.500
which is absolutely the opposite realization that this world is going through.

45:53.500 --> 46:00.500
They're having their first police strike following the purchase of the police at the hands of a consumer electronics company.

46:00.500 --> 46:03.500
And so the cops are having this...

46:03.500 --> 46:05.500
There's just so many goddamn details.

46:05.500 --> 46:07.500
I just went off on this weird off-road thing.

46:07.500 --> 46:10.500
But yeah, I mean, I do. It's funny that you're asking.

46:10.500 --> 46:16.500
And that's another thing that I think is so amazing about the job is that you can ask questions like that,

46:16.500 --> 46:22.500
even though you wrote the goddamn script, because how much of the...

46:22.500 --> 46:24.500
This job is about channeling, isn't it?

46:24.500 --> 46:28.500
It's not clear how much you can know and how much just comes in somehow.

46:28.500 --> 46:31.500
It's really amazing when it happens, and it's not reliable.

46:31.500 --> 46:36.500
I truly believe that these things are out there, and that when we're doing our best,

46:36.500 --> 46:39.500
we're doing the opposite of proving that we're good at what we do.

46:39.500 --> 46:48.500
We're actually only able to untighten some sphincter in us just enough to accidentally let something noble.

46:48.500 --> 46:51.500
That just needs an antenna.

46:51.500 --> 46:53.500
I don't know if we were trying to do anything noble,

46:53.500 --> 46:58.500
but it was like just pursuing the things you were interested in and really saying,

46:58.500 --> 47:00.500
well, there were all sorts of things that...

47:00.500 --> 47:07.500
Like, Ed 209, when I sat down with Phil Tippett, we started looking at certain kind of Japanese things,

47:07.500 --> 47:12.500
and then I said, yeah, but what this is really about, Phil, is it's really like, it's kind of the Vietnam War.

47:12.500 --> 47:17.500
This is a Huey helicopter, and this guy, Dr. McNamara, is there, and it's...

47:17.500 --> 47:20.500
I didn't push that there, but I was always in the background there,

47:20.500 --> 47:23.500
and then when you look at it, you realize, oh, that is kind of like a helicopter.

47:23.500 --> 47:24.500
That is kind of like that.

47:24.500 --> 47:27.500
And with Rabotin, who did the suit, we talked...

47:27.500 --> 47:28.500
So fucking cool.

47:28.500 --> 47:30.500
And Rabotin is a great artist.

47:30.500 --> 47:31.500
So fucking cool.

47:31.500 --> 47:32.500
I mean, these are...

47:32.500 --> 47:35.500
He had him, Phil Tippett, I mean, Jesus.

47:35.500 --> 47:38.500
And he said, and one day, many years later, I said, you know,

47:38.500 --> 47:40.500
it's really interesting because it's all about Detroit.

47:40.500 --> 47:41.500
And what I...

47:41.500 --> 47:46.500
The book I had read kind of as research for this was a book called The Reckoning by David Halberstam,

47:46.500 --> 47:51.500
all about how Detroit and Nissan had gone to war and Detroit had lost.

47:51.500 --> 47:54.500
And it was about the decline of the American car.

47:54.500 --> 47:57.500
And that was like what I was writing about with the decline of corporate stuff.

47:57.500 --> 47:59.500
I was a kid who liked cars.

47:59.500 --> 48:01.500
And this was the meaning of it.

48:01.500 --> 48:02.500
And when you look at...

48:02.500 --> 48:07.500
One day I said to Rabotin, I said, it really looks like a truck, man.

48:07.500 --> 48:09.500
It looks like a ram truck or something like it.

48:09.500 --> 48:10.500
It looks like American road iron.

48:10.500 --> 48:12.500
And Rabotin was like, oh, I like that.

48:12.500 --> 48:13.500
But I think it really did.

48:13.500 --> 48:16.500
I think he channeled that because it looks like a car in a weird way.

48:16.500 --> 48:17.500
When you look at the design...

48:17.500 --> 48:19.500
And they end up at an abandoned steel mill.

48:19.500 --> 48:21.500
I mean, it's where he has to go.

48:21.500 --> 48:24.500
It's where metal is made and unmade.

48:24.500 --> 48:27.500
No, it's all about the rust belt. And that's why it was Detroit.

48:27.500 --> 48:29.500
And that's why it was this kind of thing.

48:29.500 --> 48:31.500
And I remember the line producer saying, well, come on.

48:31.500 --> 48:32.500
We can shoot it.

48:32.500 --> 48:34.500
And Los Angeles can go home at night.

48:34.500 --> 48:38.500
But somehow going to Pittsburgh to this horrible little...

48:38.500 --> 48:41.500
This awful place where the town had fallen apart

48:41.500 --> 48:44.500
around this old steel mill that was haunted.

48:44.500 --> 48:45.500
And backstage...

48:45.500 --> 48:46.500
Fun fact, we established that.

48:46.500 --> 48:48.500
It's Ed 209 and his name is also Ed.

48:48.500 --> 48:49.500
So he threw that one in there.

48:49.500 --> 48:51.500
I love that.

48:51.500 --> 48:56.500
If I could show you a tally of the number of times in 20 years

48:56.500 --> 48:59.500
that in the most important of conversations that I've had,

48:59.500 --> 49:02.500
and it's important to me relative to what I was working on,

49:02.500 --> 49:05.500
how important it was for me to try to communicate something,

49:05.500 --> 49:10.500
the number of times that I have referenced story points in Robocop

49:10.500 --> 49:13.500
so that I could achieve some kind of vocabulary with whoever I'm talking to,

49:13.500 --> 49:15.500
whether or not they'd seen the movie.

49:15.500 --> 49:18.500
Because honestly, as long as I know what I'm talking about,

49:18.500 --> 49:21.500
then maybe I have a chance of explaining to this other person.

49:21.500 --> 49:27.500
Otherwise, I'm just babbling this like paste of fucking like...

49:27.500 --> 49:29.500
Non-connected references.

49:29.500 --> 49:34.500
But for me to be able to dive into a story that is so well constructed

49:34.500 --> 49:38.500
that I can also then later when I'm talking to the same person go,

49:38.500 --> 49:40.500
remember that thing I keep referencing Robocop?

49:40.500 --> 49:42.500
Well, now we're talking about this part of the story.

49:42.500 --> 49:44.500
So again, I'm going to reference that.

49:44.500 --> 49:46.500
Now you already know what I explain to you.

49:46.500 --> 49:53.500
Every threshold, the atonement with the father being so literal,

49:53.500 --> 49:57.500
it's amazing that that was a note that a suit gave that was like,

49:57.500 --> 49:59.500
eh, and it's such a...

49:59.500 --> 50:02.500
From the mouths of babes or capitalists,

50:02.500 --> 50:06.500
it's just sort of like, I'd like to see both bad guys be cousins.

50:06.500 --> 50:09.500
It's kind of a shrug like, yeah, it'd be easier to follow about.

50:09.500 --> 50:11.500
But it's like, I had heard like,

50:11.500 --> 50:16.500
Brillstein or Gray or somebody like when Bob and David pitched Mr. Show,

50:16.500 --> 50:19.500
they were like, it should be Mr. Show with Bob and David.

50:19.500 --> 50:21.500
Otherwise, people like people.

50:21.500 --> 50:26.500
But it was sort of like, you guys should come out and introduce the show.

50:26.500 --> 50:29.500
And then at the time, I think they thought that was such a ridiculous

50:29.500 --> 50:31.500
like baby boomerang note.

50:31.500 --> 50:36.500
But I mean, it's like, god damn, what a great note.

50:36.500 --> 50:43.500
But you could take a stopwatch

50:43.500 --> 50:49.500
and you could take a circle and break the 360 degrees down

50:49.500 --> 50:52.500
so that every second meant how many pages or whatever.

50:52.500 --> 50:55.500
And you could go around that movie

50:55.500 --> 51:01.500
and kaboom the moment when Joseph Campbell, who has never met you

51:01.500 --> 51:07.500
and who didn't even like movies, is talking about the importance

51:07.500 --> 51:11.500
of this sort of like going to meet your maker

51:11.500 --> 51:18.500
and how the extent to which you are still driven by fear

51:18.500 --> 51:23.500
is the extent to which the ogre aspect of the father will present itself

51:23.500 --> 51:28.500
and be impenetrable and only through just this cosmic pummeling

51:28.500 --> 51:33.500
by that maker's hand are you ever going to atone and become your own maker

51:33.500 --> 51:36.500
and realize I kicked my own ass back there.

51:36.500 --> 51:43.500
Robocop has rounded up his road of friles of bad guys.

51:43.500 --> 51:50.500
Like Clint Eastwood character, he's haunted by these visions of people

51:50.500 --> 51:52.500
who killed his human counterpart.

51:52.500 --> 51:55.500
And he's going and knocking them off one by one.

51:55.500 --> 51:56.500
Just full of dollars.

51:56.500 --> 52:01.500
And then the trail leads to the Clarence Bonnaker,

52:01.500 --> 52:05.500
I believe probably right at the fucking meeting with the goddess point

52:05.500 --> 52:07.500
is like it's Dick Jones.

52:07.500 --> 52:12.500
Dick Jones runs OCP, OCP runs the cops, you're a cop.

52:12.500 --> 52:14.500
He just lays it out.

52:14.500 --> 52:16.500
But that's a lovely line, isn't it?

52:16.500 --> 52:17.500
It's fantastic.

52:17.500 --> 52:19.500
All of your lines are lovely.

52:19.500 --> 52:23.500
They're all really like kind of hyper attenuated B movie lines.

52:23.500 --> 52:29.500
And you understand that because another thing is another thing that makes you a hero.

52:29.500 --> 52:35.500
You're the only audio commentary that I've ever listened all the way through on a DVD.

52:35.500 --> 52:40.500
And I was just sucked in because you were so,

52:40.500 --> 52:47.500
it was like all of a sudden you're just listening to a guy that understands Robocop.

52:47.500 --> 52:48.500
And he wrote it.

52:48.500 --> 52:50.500
It's just not, you know how it is.

52:50.500 --> 52:53.500
You meet people who worked on such and such and you want to have,

52:53.500 --> 52:56.500
you ask them one question and then the very first answer is sort of like,

52:56.500 --> 52:58.500
oh, okay.

52:58.500 --> 53:00.500
You become disillusioned.

53:00.500 --> 53:07.500
It's a prismatic kind of spraying of your mythologization of something into a realization

53:07.500 --> 53:10.500
that everything's a fluke and it was just sort of like a bunch of random stuff.

53:10.500 --> 53:14.500
To hear a writer on an audio commentary,

53:14.500 --> 53:20.500
just you're so unabashed.

53:20.500 --> 53:24.500
There's a point when Nancy Wilson's character, Nancy Allen,

53:24.500 --> 53:30.500
Nancy Allen's character is being introduced and you're describing the importance of Peter Weller watching her

53:30.500 --> 53:36.500
and that she kicks somebody's ass and that she takes off her helmet and then she like throws it to somebody

53:36.500 --> 53:43.500
and then like, and then you're just talking and talking about the importance of these characters

53:43.500 --> 53:48.500
and things and then you say something like you're like,

53:48.500 --> 53:52.500
and then that's why it was important for me that Murphy had a line

53:52.500 --> 53:56.500
and it's coming up right here and I'll loop it for you,

53:56.500 --> 53:58.500
cool stuff or whatever his line is.

53:58.500 --> 54:02.500
It was an ad lib that Peter did where he looks at her and goes,

54:02.500 --> 54:03.500
pretty neat.

54:03.500 --> 54:04.500
Now he's probably right.

54:04.500 --> 54:06.500
He probably needed a line there that I didn't give him,

54:06.500 --> 54:08.500
but I always thought, again, as a young arrogant writer,

54:08.500 --> 54:10.500
I thought, oh, that's a stupid line.

54:10.500 --> 54:13.500
I was being mean by following it there.

54:13.500 --> 54:20.500
But if you've ever seen a commentary where the person that's talking is so in sync with what you're watching

54:20.500 --> 54:23.500
that they actually just bother to recreationally like,

54:23.500 --> 54:27.500
dub the lips of the person as they do a line,

54:27.500 --> 54:30.500
and that's when it came up with the Hasta la vista, baby anyway.

54:30.500 --> 54:32.500
It's just so satisfying.

54:32.500 --> 54:33.500
It's what you dream of as a consumer.

54:33.500 --> 54:36.500
It's because I wrote all the Foley and all the background dialogue and everything

54:36.500 --> 54:37.500
and was in for the recording.

54:37.500 --> 54:39.500
Oh, sorry.

54:39.500 --> 54:42.500
That's another 40 pages of writing.

54:42.500 --> 54:44.500
Schrab's turn.

54:44.500 --> 54:45.500
OK, Schrab Corner.

54:45.500 --> 54:49.500
Let me ask you these fucking questions about the goddamn shape of the hat.

54:49.500 --> 54:55.500
So anyway, was the Prime Directive stuff, was that always from the first draft?

54:55.500 --> 54:57.500
There were always Prime Directives.

54:57.500 --> 55:00.500
And I don't remember what they were in the first draft,

55:00.500 --> 55:02.500
but there was always a Prime Directive.

55:02.500 --> 55:04.500
And then we sat down with a guy named Forrest Ackerman.

55:04.500 --> 55:07.500
This is why John Davison was such a great guy.

55:07.500 --> 55:09.500
He said, I want you to meet this guy.

55:09.500 --> 55:11.500
And this old guy in a trench coat comes to sit in his John's office and he says,

55:11.500 --> 55:12.500
He's the famous monster.

55:12.500 --> 55:13.500
I read your script.

55:13.500 --> 55:15.500
Yeah, I didn't even realize how famous he was.

55:15.500 --> 55:16.500
I read your script.

55:16.500 --> 55:20.500
And well, you know, Asimov said there should be three rules of robotics.

55:20.500 --> 55:22.500
So you should have three.

55:22.500 --> 55:24.500
So it became three.

55:24.500 --> 55:27.500
And one of them, literally, we were at lunch one day,

55:27.500 --> 55:29.500
and there was a fortune cookie that said,

55:29.500 --> 55:30.500
you serve the public trust.

55:30.500 --> 55:32.500
And I went, God, no.

55:32.500 --> 55:37.500
And there was always the forth-classified one.

55:37.500 --> 55:38.500
Well, hey, hey.

55:38.500 --> 55:39.500
I got it.

55:39.500 --> 55:41.500
The fortune cookie wrote your movie.

55:41.500 --> 55:42.500
The Prime Directive.

55:42.500 --> 55:46.500
That is such a brilliant thing because it is like Asimov,

55:46.500 --> 55:48.500
and it's a robot movie.

55:48.500 --> 55:50.500
So you're going, oh, OK, so we have to do this.

55:50.500 --> 55:53.500
But it comes up a couple of times.

55:53.500 --> 55:55.500
It comes up, I believe, three times in the film.

55:55.500 --> 56:00.500
And then finally, the fucking home run of an ending.

56:00.500 --> 56:05.500
Robocop is off the top of my head.

56:05.500 --> 56:09.500
The three best endings, I think, of all time are like Star Wars.

56:09.500 --> 56:14.500
Robocop and Get Out was like, it's like you're taking your character

56:14.500 --> 56:19.500
at the lowest point and then making him go to the highest point.

56:19.500 --> 56:22.500
And the quicker you can do that, the more likely

56:22.500 --> 56:25.500
you're going to get a standing ovation, which is what I did

56:25.500 --> 56:27.500
when he said, Dick, you're fired.

56:27.500 --> 56:30.500
The first time I saw it in 87, I stood up in the theater

56:30.500 --> 56:32.500
and went, fucking yeah.

56:32.500 --> 56:35.500
And then as the credits are rolling, I said, we're going back

56:35.500 --> 56:37.500
tomorrow to see this movie.

56:37.500 --> 56:39.500
This is the best movie ever because it's so...

56:39.500 --> 56:42.500
There's something really, really satisfying about the violence at the end.

56:42.500 --> 56:44.500
You must have been when you were done typing that one.

56:44.500 --> 56:45.500
Oh, shit.

56:45.500 --> 56:46.500
Let's find some...

56:46.500 --> 56:48.500
Oh, my fingers are smoking.

56:48.500 --> 56:49.500
Oh, my God.

56:49.500 --> 56:50.500
No.

56:50.500 --> 56:55.500
You had your shirt off like Hugh Jackman and Swordfish.

56:55.500 --> 56:56.500
Holy shit.

56:56.500 --> 57:03.500
You went to Barbara's place and made two women leave the typewriters.

57:03.500 --> 57:09.500
Because at the end of the second act, he gets his ass kicked by Ed 209

57:09.500 --> 57:13.500
because he can't arrest Ronnie Cox.

57:13.500 --> 57:15.500
Because the world is run by money.

57:15.500 --> 57:16.500
He can't do anything.

57:16.500 --> 57:21.500
He's totally blocked and then he goes up and he goes up anyway.

57:21.500 --> 57:24.500
He's like, I'm going to get my ass kicked again,

57:24.500 --> 57:31.500
but he tells the guy's boss, I can't arrest this guy because he works for you.

57:31.500 --> 57:35.500
And he goes, dick, you're fired and then fucking kills him.

57:35.500 --> 57:36.500
And it's the best.

57:36.500 --> 57:38.500
It's so fucking good.

57:38.500 --> 57:43.500
But the roar in 1987 was when he said Murphy, which is what's fascinating to me.

57:43.500 --> 57:45.500
It's a real, like, where did that come from?

57:45.500 --> 57:48.500
And the audience really identifies with that moment.

57:48.500 --> 57:54.500
Well, a little segue, but we can go back to talking about Robocop all night,

57:54.500 --> 57:58.500
but I do think it's such a weird opportunity your career represents

57:58.500 --> 58:02.500
because 10 years apart from each other, you write this amazing film.

58:02.500 --> 58:05.500
It's directed by this guy who just, it works perfectly.

58:05.500 --> 58:09.500
The chemistry between writer and director clearly are just, it just creates this thing.

58:09.500 --> 58:14.500
And all of the collaborators playing their parts.

58:14.500 --> 58:18.500
To have the same writer and director 10 years later work together again.

58:18.500 --> 58:24.500
And to have them be unmistakably doing the thing that they were doing in the other movie.

58:24.500 --> 58:30.500
I went to see Starship Troopers, incredibly excited, more grown up now.

58:30.500 --> 58:35.500
Having spent 10 years like asking myself, why do I love Robocop?

58:35.500 --> 58:39.500
And learning your name, learning that there's a thing called screenplays and all these things.

58:39.500 --> 58:41.500
And I go to see Starship Troopers.

58:41.500 --> 58:47.500
And while I'm unmistakably riveted by all of these details, all of this tone,

58:47.500 --> 58:49.500
there's something missing for me.

58:49.500 --> 59:00.500
And I walked out going like, oh, did I misunderstand Robocop's message?

59:00.500 --> 59:08.500
Did Robocop actually, was Robocop not rooting for humanity?

59:08.500 --> 59:13.500
What's happening here? There was as much irony and cynicism to Starship Troopers.

59:13.500 --> 59:19.500
But I think maybe because it was a war movie and not this movie about this guy, Murphy, the cowboy.

59:19.500 --> 59:21.500
The subjective experience.

59:21.500 --> 59:26.500
Macbeth, Hamlet, Shane, just a dude.

59:26.500 --> 59:28.500
One movie's a gunfighter. It's about a gunfighter.

59:28.500 --> 59:31.500
And I think Americans...

59:31.500 --> 59:34.500
The other movie comes out of a different genre.

59:34.500 --> 59:39.500
It comes out of the movies that were made during World War II to make you go fight.

59:39.500 --> 59:46.500
And there are movies like Air Force by Howard Hawks and Action in the North Atlantic by Edward Dimitriak or something like that.

59:46.500 --> 59:48.500
And they all have this similar...

59:48.500 --> 59:50.500
Propaganda is kind of like...

59:50.500 --> 59:58.500
Their propaganda, but they also have a similar structure that they all kind of follow a similar structure in any event.

59:58.500 --> 01:00:02.500
It's before the war and there's a bunch of people and then there's a war.

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:06.500
And then they meet a bunch of other people and they all say they kind of meet different kinds of people.

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:11.500
And then they train together and then they learn that one day one of them is going to have to die.

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:13.500
Someone's going to have to send someone to die.

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:17.500
The thing about like...

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:19.500
Sorry to cut you off, Ed.

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.500
It's not his personal story.

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:28.500
Yeah. The thing about Murphy is we were talking about tone where we can be funny, we can be violent and everything.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:32.500
Murphy doesn't know he's in a comedy.

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.500
Everything about it is tragic.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:35.500
He's taking it seriously.

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.500
He's kind of a nerd.

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.500
He doesn't deserve this.

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:44.500
We feel so bad for him because you don't shy away from the violence when he does get killed.

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:49.500
You don't shy away from the tragedy of his kid and his wife.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:53.500
When they're waving and you're backing away from his home and his life.

01:00:53.500 --> 01:01:00.500
And I think that's why the tone works so well is that the tragedy is real.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:08.500
The relatability is real and everything else is kind of like up to a 11 or 12 or whatever.

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:09.500
Yeah.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:22.500
Well, I don't think you can discount the power of the trauma of Robocop, the subjective trauma of his true crime worthy experience of being the victim of gang mutilation.

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:31.500
That it's a joke to these sociopaths that he's a cop and he's now in their hands and how much fun they're having torturing him.

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:41.500
Before they finally in a world that clearly has suffered a certain amount of inflation in terms of the amount of bullets a human body can take.

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:46.500
Even they spend too much lead killing Dr. Weller.

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:51.500
I keep forgetting is Dr. Weller as of 2014 Peter Weller got his doctorate in like Renaissance.

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:52.500
I love this history show.

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.500
He was so into like Greece.

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:57.500
He just really kind of boner for like pyramids and stuff like that.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:00.500
Somebody does 70 movies and gets a PhD in something.

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:02.500
You're pretty sure what they got a PhD in.

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:03.500
They're pretty passionate.

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:08.500
I want to watch Robocop tell me about, you know, Sumeria all day long.

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:09.500
It's a fucking way.

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:13.500
If I was an actor in 70 movies, my PhD would be in cocaine.

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.500
I'd be dead.

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:21.500
Anyways, the yeah, I just like I just and maybe maybe it's because I was an adolescent.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:26.500
So I was like, I was coming into your hands like and God was I lucky.

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:30.500
I mean, do you think about just the crap I could have seen while going through puberty.

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:42.500
And and I walked out of a theater in Milwaukee just to my my I could feel my neurology changed.

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:50.500
I it's hard to make another generation understand because you can't even say these days back then there was no internet.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:51.500
That doesn't make any sense.

01:02:51.500 --> 01:03:00.500
But also even even the difference between like a world where like when I Schrab was the first guy to ever show me like a Jackie Chan movie.

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:01.500
It wasn't there.

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.500
You didn't see wire work until the matrix.

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:08.500
It was previous to that was a bootleg VHS thing.

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:15.500
You had to you had to be you had to be looking under rocks to see things that didn't feel like E.T.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:27.500
And and to just wander in and for the same movie ticket price have this completely different psychological serum injected into you and a walk out going.

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:33.500
Why was that funny and violent and and why did it love and hate America?

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:41.500
Why why is it OK for me to be simultaneously rooting for humanity and very cynical about the way the world works?

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:46.500
Like why why is this movie baptized me into a new religion?

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:48.500
I don't how does that work?

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:49.500
Are there other movies like this?

01:03:49.500 --> 01:04:01.500
It was a lifesaver and just because you you you bristled when I invoked the word nobility when we talk like I for me nobility just means efficacy in our craft.

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:08.500
Maybe if we were poets or street musicians or doctors we the big three.

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:14.500
You know maybe nobility would have would have to but I affecting lives even just making people laugh.

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:17.500
I don't I don't even mean to it's like oh you changed a little boy's life.

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:21.500
I that doesn't have to be the standard just reach.

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:22.500
You know that's what we do.

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:23.500
It's populism.

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:27.500
It's it's it's it's it's no it's noble when the story is powerful.

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:37.500
I agree listen I agree with you there's nothing more important than that in what we do that somehow I don't know when you were talking I think sometimes there's movies that really hit us and it depends on how old we are and it depends on the movies.

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:46.500
But you know I feel sometimes I've seen a movie like when I saw Chinatown for the first time in a theater I was a young person and I thought I'd been struck by lightning.

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:50.500
Chinatown seems like yeah I can imagine seeing Chinatown in adolescence.

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.500
Chinatown I was completely obsessed with Chinatown.

01:04:52.500 --> 01:05:02.500
I got I before the Internet before anything before I went out and every time I could I see it and then I would and I got I somehow I met his brother and I got a copy of the script.

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:08.500
I read the script and I outlined the script and that was my that was kind of before I wrote Robocop.

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:10.500
I had this whole obsession with Chinatown.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:11.500
That's really interesting.

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:20.500
I got the script for Clockwork Orange and sometimes if you look at it you see wow there's a circular structure in Clockwork Orange and there's a circular interesting structure.

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:26.500
So I don't know how that happened but I think it was the things I was interested in were made their way in.

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:33.500
It's interesting to me because Sid Field obsesses about body heat and Chinatown.

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:40.500
And so that's why partly like I'm like god damn it like what about Robocop?

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:43.500
What about Die Hard because I'm of a slightly to maybe a half generation.

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:46.500
No Die Hard is also a movie you can't stop watching.

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.500
There's something about it.

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:54.500
But it's funny that you're one of these you're one of these craftsmen between those that you're watching Robert Townes work and you're deconstructing it.

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:55.500
You're learning to program.

01:05:55.500 --> 01:06:01.500
You're you're you're you're needing you you're wanting to appeal that onion and figure out how to do it.

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.500
For some reason I wanted to be the screenwriter.

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:04.500
Were you a big Western fan?

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.500
Yeah, I know I like Westerns.

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:15.500
We used to always talk about OK that we had we had John Wayne rules like that that ran what Robocop could do and what he couldn't do.

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:16.500
We were always aware of those kind of things.

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:20.500
Yeah, because that's I mean the Prime Directive like the Western is a genre.

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:32.500
There's there's a set of a code code you know code of ethics a code of morality and with your Glenn Ford or Gary Cooper or Clint Eastwood or John Wayne that there's there's things there's do's and don'ts.

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:35.500
And you are punished for having that code.

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.500
The code is what puts you in peril.

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:38.500
Right.

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.500
The bad guys don't have a code.

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:41.500
Their code is do what you want.

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:45.500
And so you're so there's a real fantasy fulfillment when he is killed because.

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:49.500
Essentially because he's a cop and he he gets killed and he comes back as Robocop.

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.500
He gets to you can shoot him now.

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:52.500
That's he can't.

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.500
And that's really what makes that character.

01:06:54.500 --> 01:07:01.500
My favorite Western is High Plains Drifter because he's either a savior or he's Satan.

01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:06.500
He's come back to either punish the town or save the town and both at the same times.

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:10.500
And he is you don't know until the very end what exactly he is, but he's never given a name.

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:13.500
But he he he was the brother or was he.

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.500
He was the sheriff they killed in the beginning.

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.500
I know that's kind of kind of Robocop.

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.500
Well, I think those were things.

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.500
Those were movies of my youth.

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:22.500
Yeah.

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:25.500
But then he has this kind of invulnerability.

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:31.500
Not that he's bulletproof, but he's got like he comes from like he's.

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.500
He's he's he's also pure.

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:35.500
And that's the other thing that you like about him.

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:41.500
He's he's actually a presexual character and he's pure and he's not he's not in any way diminished.

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:43.500
And he really believes in justice.

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:46.500
And there's something that's really people like about like that.

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:47.500
Yeah.

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:50.500
And it reflects in the relationship with Nancy Allen, which is not sexualized.

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:51.500
Right.

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:58.500
But when she sees him spin the gun and I I'll still get I'll still get choked up about that because like that's such a good fucking.

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:00.500
Oh, yeah, that relationship with Nancy Allen.

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:06.500
Yeah, it's worth noting it's for anything to hold up that was made in 1987.

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:09.500
I say this very cynically as a person is just like, look, come on.

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:11.500
Revenge of the Nerds is amazing.

01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:16.500
It's a tragedy that culture moves so fast that some of these movies that are so influential and great.

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:28.500
They just end up having so many cultural problem points because this is how people, you know, it's like, like, oh, if you had telekinesis back then, you popped a girl's bra off and like it would have been.

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:29.500
It's weird science.

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:42.500
You were it's it Robocop does not have you it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't throb with the problematizable.

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:47.500
No, no, it's because by the way, I was an executive on weird science when it was in script form.

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:51.500
And I thought it was I just watched that recent land boy that doesn't really hold up.

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:58.500
But I think the reason that is because I grew up in Marin County, which is a very, very neoliberal place.

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:01.500
And it was very granola in the days that I grew up there.

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:09.500
And my mother was the title nine officer at Redwood High School, and she was part of an sort of a feminist movement there.

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:16.500
And so I was sort of steeped in that my mother had, you know, one night Gloria Steinem showed up at the house and when I was 13.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:24.500
So I think all of that had an effect on me in a way that I really did want to create a role with Lewis that was just a role for a cop.

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.500
Yeah, wasn't about anything else.

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:30.500
I love that. And sometimes it's as easy as what you don't do. It restraint.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:39.500
So in casting, we couldn't cast it and we we had all this problem casting it and we kept looking at and very often really understood this too at some level.

01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:41.500
And again, if you look at his movies, you can see why.

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:49.500
But we kept looking at women and they would come into all these beautiful women came in and whenever you imagine them with him, it became this kind of thing.

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:51.500
She's going to rub her hands on the chassis of his chest.

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:59.500
Yeah, he sexualizes it somehow. And so one day, one day, Paul said, Yeah, I keep seeing the poster of Annie.

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:03.500
I think she should look like the girl from Annie. And then Nancy Allen walked in.

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:05.500
So there's this kind of like trove.

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:10.500
She's sunny, she's feminine, but she's not sexual and she's kind of tough.

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:13.500
She has a legacy as a victim in movies. She's a scream queen.

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:16.500
Yeah, she really likes this movie because it's not it's not that.

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:24.500
That's what she's reborn in this movie as and there's it's also so immediately notable.

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:30.500
I thought this was just brilliant futurism in your movie that in the locker room scenes, they're coed.

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:34.500
And as a 15 year old in 1987, it made perfect sense.

01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:37.500
It was such a it cost no money.

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.500
No production value put into it.

01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:41.500
There it is. We're in the future.

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:42.500
Why the men and the women?

01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:45.500
Yeah, of course, eventually we're going to stop.

01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:49.500
10 years later, we did the shower scene in Starship the same for the same reason.

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:55.500
Yeah, was it when you got the budget, was it more than you dreamed of or way less than you hoped for?

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:56.500
For Robocup?

01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:57.500
Yeah.

01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:59.500
Well, the movie almost didn't get made a couple of times.

01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:03.500
It was it was supposed to be seven six because that's what Terminator had cost.

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:05.500
And they were going to spend a dollar more.

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:08.500
And then one day we came into the office and everybody's gone home and it was over.

01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:14.500
And then they turned around and they decided they found some more money because they found some money in Japan

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:19.500
because Peter Weller had done Bakaru Banzai and they were interested in Peter.

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.500
And so suddenly we were on again.

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:26.500
And we went in at like $10 million or something.

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:34.500
And then we immediately had trouble and we were the final cost of the movies was 13.9, which is actually an amazing budget for that.

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:35.500
It would be about 28.

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:39.500
Like normally like Blue Thunder was a movie that was made during that time as an action picture.

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:41.500
And that was 28 at the time.

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:44.500
So John Davidson.

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:45.500
Blue Thunder was $28 million. That's so sad.

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:49.500
It's super power was not making noise.

01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:51.500
It was a super helicopter.

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:54.500
If it wanted it, you could turn the volume down on it.

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:55.500
That's right.

01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:56.500
That's right.

01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:58.500
But boy did it play with Roy Scheider's alcoholism.

01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:03.500
But I like my uncle wrote that.

01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:07.500
The but and it made what 50 million.

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:08.500
Which Robocup?

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:12.500
It was made $54 million, which in those days was a hit.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:13.500
Yeah.

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:14.500
Sleeper hit of the summer.

01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:15.500
So then you're a made man.

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:19.500
I kind of want to talk about the two jakes of Robocup.

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:23.500
Robocup 2 would be only because historically it's so interesting.

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:33.500
I was reading the Wikipedia and I was like, Oh God, what a forest gumpy kind of thing that Robocup 2 is interesting sequel.

01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:37.500
You definitely even if you don't read a single credit, you're kind of like, what's going on here?

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:46.500
And, you know, they went to Frank Miller to write the script because it was 1988 and the WGA strike.

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:47.500
WGA strike.

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:50.500
And you had a script in the chamber.

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:51.500
Right.

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.500
You got another new Meyer coming out.

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:54.500
Oh, you did?

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:55.500
You'd written one?

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:56.500
Well, okay.

01:12:56.500 --> 01:13:03.500
So they when the movie came out and we were made as you said, they said, okay, you have to write a new Robocup immediately or you're fired.

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:06.500
They literally said, if you don't immediately write a new story, we can fire you.

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:08.500
And so we said, okay.

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:10.500
And then Oliver Stone wanted us to write a script.

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:15.500
And so four called about the CIA in Nicaragua.

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:18.500
And that was kind of sexy, you know, and they sent us down to Nicaragua.

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:20.500
You get to work with Jim Belushi.

01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:22.500
We got to run around with Sandinistas.

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:25.500
It was really, it was really groovy and he had just done platoon.

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:26.500
So he was the man.

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:29.500
So we wrote two scripts at the same time, which is a mistake.

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:35.500
And we did it in three months and one script turned out better than the other and the Robocup script that we had written right before the strike.

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:36.500
It was okay.

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:38.500
You wrote Salvador?

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:41.500
No, we wrote a thing called Company Man right after platoon.

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:45.500
And it was about it was about Nicaragua, not where was it?

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:46.500
Where is Salvador?

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:47.500
It's probably Salvador.

01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:48.500
Yeah.

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:51.500
This was about the Sandinistas and we had to go down and do all that.

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:54.500
It was kind of a fun script, but they, Oliver didn't make it.

01:13:54.500 --> 01:14:01.500
And then we got fired because there was a writer strike and they hire, they signed a waiver and hired Frank Miller, who I had introduced to John Davis.

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:02.500
This is a really cool guy.

01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:03.500
I don't really know him.

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.500
And so Frank did that script.

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:08.500
He did a, he did one script, which they, they rejected.

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:12.500
And then they brought in Waylon Green, who wrote the Wild Bunch and they did a second script.

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:13.500
Wow.

01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:15.500
And it was kind of based on the creature.

01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:21.500
In some ways, I believe it was based on the creature that Phil Tippett was going to do for it because John and Phil really had this idea.

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:28.500
And there's, I don't love the movie, but there's the drug dealer kid is something I feel I could redeem if I had been writing it.

01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:29.500
Yeah.

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:30.500
Well, okay.

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:36.500
That was a roller coaster sentence because I was like, I, you know, one thing I fucking hate about that movie is that obnoxious ventriloquist, dummy kid.

01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:37.500
No, I know.

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:38.500
But there's something.

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:39.500
But you're absolutely right.

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:40.500
Yes.

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:41.500
The things you could have done.

01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:42.500
Yeah.

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:48.500
I don't remember anything about Robocop 2 because I hated it and I just, I did nothing sticks to my brain.

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:53.500
The thing that sticks to my brain that I, it reminds me of something that you could have done a lot with.

01:14:53.500 --> 01:15:03.500
I thought it was a great, wonderful idea that the tragedy of the Robocop story and Robocop 2 is that the prime directives go up for committee.

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:04.500
Right.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.500
And he ends up with like 109 directives.

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:10.500
Like, would it, it won't kill you to smile now and then.

01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:14.500
And kind of like, it's just sort of like Robocop becomes this schizophrenic.

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:16.500
I don't know if it's true, but I bet you that's a John Davison idea.

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:18.500
Because that's really what John, that would have been.

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:21.500
Directive number four was don't sweat the little shit.

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:25.500
Right. I mean, I just, I find that kind of, it's funny and it's absurd and realistic.

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:27.500
Like, it's just like the, it's resonant.

01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:30.500
The idea of like, oh God, this would be the thing that would kill Robocop.

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:42.500
He would end up having like all these directives and then like, but yeah, that, that, that, but it's, if it wasn't called Robocop, it might even be like a cult favorite of mine.

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:51.500
Because it would be like this weird comic booky cyber punky movie with Tom Noonan as this crackhead that turns into a crackhead robot.

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:55.500
But as a Robocop sequel, boy, how could you, how could you.

01:15:55.500 --> 01:16:03.500
It's got to make you feel kind of, kind of good that, you know, nobody can make it work.

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:05.500
Because there's been so many different like.

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:08.500
When you drop swords, they just merge with stones.

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:14.500
They just, they can make a Robocop remake of TV series.

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:16.500
Well, I hope they'll get it right one of these days.

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:17.500
Yeah.

01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:19.500
MGM wants to make another one and we're trying to help, but we'll see.

01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:25.500
Yeah. So there is a, there was a, there was this reboot in 2014, which I didn't watch.

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:28.500
And I'm not usually a snob about reboots, but this is too personal for me.

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:30.500
I knew there was absolutely no way.

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:33.500
I saw the, I saw the suit and I, I got mad.

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:34.500
What the fuck?

01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:35.500
I'm like, maybe.

01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:36.500
I mean, give me a break.

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:38.500
Again, I was like, I saw the.

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.500
Rob, that personally just wounded.

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:42.500
I'm just so pissed off.

01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:45.500
I mean, it's just, cause it's just like somebody went, no, I think we can do better.

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.500
And that's, that's what they come up with.

01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:52.500
And it's like, get the, get, get seriously, get out, get out of here.

01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:54.500
The arrogance is astounding.

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:55.500
Out of here.

01:16:55.500 --> 01:17:03.500
Especially when even for your time, it was already, it was already a, a, a confident bet.

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:11.500
It wasn't, it wasn't like all the rage was guys in ridiculous tin man costumes, like

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:12.500
that looked like tanks.

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:15.500
It wasn't like, oh, you just rode that, those coattails.

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:20.500
It was like, it would already been established that if you just trust this like singular

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:24.500
tone and let it be its own thing and then for them to go like, yeah, but everything's black

01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:25.500
and rubber now.

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:29.500
It's hot, but I don't want to bag on that stuff and shake my cane at it.

01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:34.500
But they're, it's important to note, so you got Robocop, you got Robocop two, you got

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:39.500
Robocop three, where I think there's like ninjas in that one and a jet pack.

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:40.500
There's been a cartoon.

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:42.500
There's been a, all kinds of stuff.

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:43.500
Comic books.

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:45.500
And then the, there's the reboot, which I didn't watch.

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:46.500
So I don't know what it was.

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:47.500
It was a Canadian TV series.

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:48.500
Canonically.

01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:50.500
Prime directive.

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:54.500
Now they're, I don't know what stage they're at.

01:17:54.500 --> 01:18:02.000
They can fill us in on the details, but they're, they, they're going to do a sequel to the

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.500
original that ignores all of this other stuff.

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:07.500
Is that, that's what I, well, we'll see what's going to happen.

01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:08.500
And we'll see.

01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:12.500
And, but I have to say that MGM has been very, very nice to me since the reboot.

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:18.500
I, when I got credited because of the WGA, I had to go in and meet with them.

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:21.500
And I met with the, the president of MGM.

01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:26.500
And you'll see online, as I was confused, it's like, like Ed's got a credit on the 2014

01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:31.500
Robocop reboot, which micro broke a little part of my heart for a second.

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:33.500
Well, it was, I had nothing to do with it.

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:34.500
Right.

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.500
It was sort of nice to get the residuals.

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:42.500
And it's because just to clarify, it's, it's because the writers in, in basing it on your

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:48.500
kind of your, your, your characters and your story, they evoked enough of it, that arbitration.

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:54.500
They took so many pieces of it and used it that in the arbitration process, they, they

01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:56.500
assigned us a fair amount of credit for it.

01:18:56.500 --> 01:19:01.500
Now I feel like that's got to feel good because that's not even like the, the, like it's,

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:05.500
it's a, it's a, it's a maybe like a 15 year old boy fantasy to be like, yeah.

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:08.500
And then, and then they did it without me and it sucked.

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:16.500
And it's like, it's, but like that's a, that's a proper like mentor wizard fantasy of like,

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:22.500
it's been 30 years and these kids are trying your craft and like the blood magic gets out

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:28.500
of control and you're just like, yeah, you're, you're, you're sitting there and you're lazy

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:30.500
boy and you're like, oh, I felt a tingle.

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:34.500
Someone's trying to do what I did again.

01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:37.500
They always, they always think they, they, they're always sure that what they're doing

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:38.500
is the right thing.

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:44.500
Do you feel like maybe you can, or can't talk about what stage this new possible straight

01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:48.500
sequel thing is, but do you feel confident if you went back and tried to do the sequel

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:53.500
that you have, like, that you, like, you know where you're going with that and you could

01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:54.500
pull it off?

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:56.500
We've had, we've had a bunch of conversation about this.

01:19:56.500 --> 01:20:00.500
I was going to, what happened, which was interesting was I went in when they were,

01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:03.500
when I, when I met them, they'd all just finished this movie, hadn't come out yet.

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:07.500
And I had a kind of, it was kind of a weird, like, how did I feel about this?

01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:08.500
They were remaking this movie.

01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:13.500
I was meeting all these people, but I remembered having made a couple of movies that were traumatic,

01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:17.500
like that they were all probably in shock and that had been a very difficult experience.

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:18.500
And it really had been.

01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:22.500
And so I decided to just interview them about that.

01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:24.500
And I interviewed everyone I could.

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:27.500
I interviewed the writer that we got credit from.

01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:28.500
I interviewed the president.

01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:29.500
I interviewed the director.

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.500
And I would just sit there and say, well, what was that like?

01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:33.500
And how did that happen?

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:36.500
And they sort of remembered that somehow.

01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:38.500
And when the movie came out, it didn't do that well.

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:41.500
I got a call from the president of production saying, why don't you come in here and tell

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:43.500
us any Robocop ideas you have?

01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:48.500
And I went in and I said, well, you know, there was, I started telling him this idea I had.

01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:53.500
And he said, are you pitching me the original sequel that you guys wrote back in 1988?

01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:55.500
And I said, well, yeah, kind of.

01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.500
And he said, oh, okay.

01:20:57.500 --> 01:21:00.500
And that sort of has set us off in a different direction.

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:02.500
Oh, fuck yeah.

01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:04.500
Baby.

01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:05.500
Are you kidding me?

01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:06.500
No, but we'll see.

01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:08.500
There's a lot of work to be done.

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:11.500
And then Neil Blumkamp came swooping in when he heard they were going to do it.

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.500
And look at Rob.

01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.500
He was going to do it for a while.

01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:20.500
He said, well, there's one funny story about it.

01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:22.500
Then it didn't work out.

01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:26.500
They developed a few scripts and he had a bunch of different ideas.

01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:28.500
And I don't think it ever really came together.

01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:31.500
But at one point he decided, and I thought this was interesting.

01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:35.500
He said, we really got to go and do it like it happened right after the first one.

01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:37.500
That it was Verhoeven's next movie.

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:40.500
He said, I'm going to do it just like Paul Verhoeven.

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:43.500
So the other day I'm sitting with Paul Verhoeven.

01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:47.500
He said, yeah, he said he was going to do it just like Paul Verhoeven.

01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:49.500
I can't quite do Paul's voice.

01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:50.500
It sounds better.

01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:53.500
And he said, but he said, I can't do it like Paul Verhoeven.

01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:57.500
He said, because I won't have the same set of circumstances creatively.

01:21:57.500 --> 01:22:00.500
I'm not trying to make a movie for $10 million.

01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:02.500
I don't have John Davidson.

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:03.500
I don't have Phil Tippett then.

01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:04.500
I don't have you.

01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:06.500
I don't have all these people together.

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:11.500
And for him, that's as much a part of the creative thing in that moment as anything else.

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:16.500
Yeah, because that movie does kind of feel like...

01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:21.500
And Die Hard 2, that's more of a kind of a larger production, maybe.

01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:24.500
But they feel like B-movies that were done perfectly.

01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:28.500
And they kind of feel like they were made in secrets.

01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:30.500
They were made for you.

01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:35.500
When you walk into the theater, we turned over a rock and found a diamond.

01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:39.500
It's not like you go in there and there's this giant tent pole kind of thing.

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.500
Well, they're not shoving it down your throat as we were talking.

01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:42.500
Yeah, exactly.

01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:43.500
It's like the Robocop.

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:48.500
I feel a personal relationship with that in a way that I don't feel with like E.T.

01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:52.500
or things like that that are just these giant juggernaut kind of things.

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:56.500
I think that might have something to do with just not to sound like an old cane shaker,

01:22:56.500 --> 01:23:01.500
but I think it just has to do with the singularity that hasn't happened yet, which is CG.

01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:08.500
When CG starts to happen, the vastness of your world is not related in any way to your budget.

01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:14.500
If Kronenberg wants to reboot the fly, he has to rent a warehouse.

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:16.500
He has to build telepods.

01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:21.500
And these characters, these Rick Bakers, these Phil Tippets, these craftsmen have to come in

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:26.500
and figure out how to make a beetle into a person and vice versa.

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:34.500
And there's a relationship there between budget, scope, but more importantly, like,

01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:38.500
oh, if this guy is going to become a fly in this movie, then it's all the more important

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:42.500
that we understand that he's a human being because of the budget,

01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:46.500
because of the practicality of the makeup and everything.

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:50.500
We can't waste anyone's time here on an emotional level.

01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:54.500
And then you start to get into like, okay, you're going to show up at Warner Brothers.

01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:57.500
There's going to be a 90-foot sheet of green.

01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:01.500
You're not going to be in a scene with any other actor.

01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:03.500
We just need your head.

01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:05.500
We're going to scan it from 360 degrees.

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:10.500
Sign this form that says, if you die, you can be a cracker.

01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:15.500
And congratulations because the computer says you already made $100 million in Hong Kong

01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:17.500
and go, goodbye.

01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:22.500
And we've made some amazing movies with this technology,

01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:29.500
but what we've also done is we've lost that middle class.

01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:31.500
I don't know what to call it.

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:35.500
Well, Verhoeven always would say that reality is the best special effect

01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:37.500
and that reality is what makes these things work.

01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:39.500
And even in a story level, he would go, I don't like that.

01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:40.500
It's not real.

01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:41.500
It's not how it would happen.

01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:45.500
Even if you're talking about absurd things like robots and law enforcement and stuff like that.

01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:49.500
And also, you really feel the reality of a man in a suit.

01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:52.500
The performance is because of that suit.

01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:53.500
Oh, let's talk about that a little bit.

01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:54.500
Sure.

01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:55.500
Dr. Weller, PhD.

01:24:55.500 --> 01:25:00.500
So I always assumed, and I think this is incredibly easy to assume,

01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:03.500
and I'm so intrigued that the answer is not exactly,

01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:09.500
that when you watch Robocop, because I didn't, it's like, who was Peter Weller?

01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:12.500
It turns out, Bucca Rubanzi, right, okay.

01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:15.500
But I watched that movie and I was like, who's this guy?

01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:20.500
Oh, they must have cast him for those like weird kissy lips.

01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:23.500
His like almost feminine jawline.

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:27.500
Because they knew that they were committing this cardinal sin,

01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:30.500
that they were going to be casting this actor with no,

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:34.500
this character was going to have no eyes, no nose, no ears.

01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:36.500
And it was so important.

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:40.500
It was a picture like these auditions where these actors are coming in and standing under a sheet

01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:46.500
that's on C stands and the only thing visible is their lips and that Peter Weller walked away with the part.

01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:47.500
Not the case at all.

01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:49.500
He was Bucca Rubanzi.

01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:52.500
Well, it really helps that Peter was really thin.

01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:54.500
That helps a lot when you're building a suit like that.

01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:58.500
And so if you put the wrong person in the suit, you're going to get the Michelin man.

01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:03.500
But he's very, he also has this kind of perfect look of,

01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:06.500
I used to say when I was being meaner,

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:11.500
but he has this kind of tragic look, mythic self pity or something.

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:15.500
But there's a tragedy about his face that really works well in that.

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:17.500
But no, he's got those kissy lips.

01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:22.500
We had, we always, I always thought you needed a real actor in the park.

01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:25.500
We had, we went out to a bunch of different people came in.

01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:27.500
I mean, Keith Carradine wanted to do it.

01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:32.500
Robert Carradine, no, not David Carradine really wanted to do it.

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:36.500
And so we had all those kinds of things, but it came down to, I think...

01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:39.500
There's a great SNL sketch here, obviously.

01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:42.500
Jack Lemon and the Robocop.

01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:47.500
Peter was somebody that was, we knew he was a good actor.

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:52.500
He had, Orion liked him because he had, Bucca Rubanzi had made some money in Japan.

01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:54.500
And he came in, he wouldn't read on tape.

01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:55.500
So he read with me.

01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:58.500
He says he didn't read, but we actually had to read with me.

01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:00.500
And it was actually kind of scary.

01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:03.500
And Paul and I, well, Paul said, okay, that's good.

01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:04.500
We'll go with him.

01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:08.500
And then he went out and trained with a mime coach, Monee Yacum,

01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:14.500
for a long time in hockey gear, in Central Park, trying to get all these moves.

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:15.500
That's so cool.

01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:18.500
It's so important that his movements are so...

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:19.500
Did anybody ask him to do that?

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:22.500
And of course, now you will start acting like a man.

01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:23.500
I think he wanted to do that.

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:24.500
He knew that was an issue.

01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:26.500
John Davidson, everybody knew that was a good idea.

01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:31.500
So meantime, the suit...

01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:34.500
Well, the suit is being made and it's being made.

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:37.500
And then the suit is a week late in production,

01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:40.500
which really causes a lot of trouble, but it's for good reasons.

01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:43.500
Come quietly or there will be trouble.

01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:46.500
When Peter is thrown into that suit for the first time,

01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:51.500
it's a huge crisis in the production because he's never been in the suit before.

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:54.500
And even though there's been all this prep and all this stuff,

01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:57.500
now you've got to make the character work.

01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:00.500
And it was a really bad weekend.

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:03.500
And it was sort of a cauldron.

01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:06.500
And out of that bad, bad weekend came this suit movements.

01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:09.500
All the stuff he'd done before, now he's working with Paul.

01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:11.500
And that's how...

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:14.500
It was like it was born under huge pressure.

01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:17.500
Wait, well, I want to make sure I'm clear on what you're saying.

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:19.500
You're saying there was this sort of travesty.

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:21.500
It almost sounds like the Jaws story of the Sharks Network.

01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:23.500
No, there wasn't anything wrong with the suit.

01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:26.500
The minute the last minute, it was more complicated than everybody.

01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:31.500
And was his work with the Mime people as a result of the awkwardness of the suit being late?

01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:33.500
He had never really been in the suit before.

01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:36.500
And then the suit came on to the set later than it was supposed to.

01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:39.500
So there was a lot of pressure, like let's suit it tomorrow.

01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:42.500
And in those days, when you had a suit,

01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:44.500
the first time you put it on, it took 14 hours.

01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:46.500
So the first day he shot maybe an hour.

01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:48.500
14 hours?

01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:51.500
And then by the time they got it right, it was a much quicker in and of.

01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:53.500
But it was a big deal.

01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:57.500
But it was somehow, everybody at the time, we had other problems.

01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:58.500
We almost got shut down.

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:01.500
The production guarantee came in.

01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:03.500
And for a moment, it looked really bad.

01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:07.500
And it was under this kind of pressurized situation at the beginning of the movie

01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:10.500
that the suit came in and he had to get in it.

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.500
And it was where the character was born.

01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:16.500
This is something that can't be discounted because at the time, although there's no CG,

01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:23.500
it is something that absolutely makes all of what you're doing on this set so potentially disastrous.

01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:24.500
It didn't work.

01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:25.500
It wasn't going to work.

01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:27.500
That was the entire moment right there.

01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:28.500
Everything else was working.

01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:33.500
But if that didn't come together, if Peter, if you didn't buy Peter in the suit as Rebel Cop,

01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:38.500
then that was anybody that knows their 1980s popcorn movie,

01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:42.500
you mentioned a movie from 1986 that you were so when you saw it.

01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:43.500
Short circuit.

01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:44.500
Yeah.

01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:48.500
I was like, oh, God, I never thought about short circuit in relation to Rebel Cop.

01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:51.500
And it was your nightmare because it was like, that's how you do it.

01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:53.500
They were going to beat us into the theaters.

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:56.500
It was like, that's what a robot was in that day.

01:29:56.500 --> 01:30:00.500
No CG yet, but absolutely armatures, erectors.

01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:02.500
I am a remote control.

01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:04.500
E.T. is a robot, essentially.

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:05.500
And I was really relieved.

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:06.500
I was like, oh, thank God.

01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:07.500
This is so different from that.

01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:11.500
The stupid question, the gun holster that comes out of his leg,

01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:13.500
was that a practical effect or is that stop motion?

01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:17.500
That was a practical effect that it was a leg that Robertine made.

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:19.500
And Robertine, here's how good Robertine is.

01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:20.500
Robertine just made that.

01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:21.500
What?

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:22.500
We didn't talk to him about it.

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:24.500
He just said, oh, no, it has to be this way.

01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:25.500
And he just made that.

01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:27.500
He just myth-bustered it and said, fuck it,

01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:29.500
the thing comes out and I'm thinking of the gun.

01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:30.500
Of the many, many, many.

01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:32.500
I kind of want to talk about Foley.

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:35.500
I want to talk about the loop group because it's like, I wonder,

01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:39.500
is it a loop group line where it's like in that firing squad thing where,

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:43.500
okay, so everyone's just shooting on the firing line

01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:47.500
and then slowly the sound of this weird gun.

01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:49.500
And then everyone's running.

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:51.500
Verhoeven's doing this thing.

01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:52.500
The camera's going.

01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:53.500
Everyone's running.

01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:57.500
And then there's this one voice rings out.

01:30:57.500 --> 01:31:00.500
There's this guy going, look at that fucking gun.

01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:03.500
I meant to bring it to you.

01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:04.500
I'll bring you the script.

01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:05.500
It's in the script.

01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:06.500
It's in the script?

01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:07.500
I love it.

01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:13.500
The cop's reaction to Robocop is so important

01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:20.500
because, again, they do say while they're running

01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:23.500
and they're separated by Chainlink,

01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:25.500
they're watching this robot who, by the way,

01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:28.500
is being meticulously revealed.

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:30.500
That was Verhoeven.

01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:32.500
Verhoeven, I remember from the commentary,

01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:34.500
the brilliant idea of the first time you see him

01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:36.500
is essentially on video assist.

01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:37.500
He walks by.

01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:40.500
And it's so smart because it goes

01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:41.500
and it's subjective.

01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:46.500
The transformation where you go into death itself

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:48.500
and then the only thing you're conscious of

01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:51.500
is the reassembly of your life.

01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:56.500
You, the audience, including a weird female executive

01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:59.500
in a pencil skirt who is not a character in the film

01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:02.500
but is a character in your formative life

01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:05.500
who made out with you drunk at a New Year's Eve party.

01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:07.500
But that's the...

01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:08.500
You mean Tyler.

01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:09.500
Yeah, yeah.

01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:11.500
Yeah, I'm saying, like, she's not in the movie.

01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:12.500
She doesn't have an arc.

01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:13.500
No, she is.

01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:14.500
She is actually the...

01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:15.500
Well, she didn't have an arc.

01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:17.500
I know I'm saying, like, she has a story

01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:19.500
only within Robocop's nursery.

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:21.500
It's so ancient Greek.

01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:23.500
It's like, we don't have to carry her.

01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:26.500
We didn't have to figure out how she's related to this and that

01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:29.500
ever when Dick Jones gets fired goes,

01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:30.500
like, can I be promoted?

01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:32.500
It's like, she is simply...

01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:35.500
Her job, mythically, is that she is this Athena

01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:37.500
that is there.

01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:40.500
The addition of this idea that during this assembly

01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:42.500
of what you're becoming Robocop,

01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:45.500
and so you don't know how much time is passing,

01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:47.500
and then...

01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:49.500
And, like, the targeting systems are like,

01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:51.500
all right, no, hold it.

01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:53.500
Ah, shit!

01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:54.500
And you're watching them.

01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:55.500
And then...

01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:58.500
And it comes to life and you hear in the distance

01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:00.500
music, party favors,

01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:03.500
and this drunk version of this woman

01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:06.500
who has smugly crushed Miguel Ferrer's hand

01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:08.500
with the prosthesis and, like,

01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:10.500
she just comes into the...

01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:12.500
She sneaks over to the camera

01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:14.500
and puts a big lipstick kiss on it.

01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:15.500
Sage Parker.

01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:17.500
And that's an interesting scene

01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:19.500
because that's the only ad-lib scene in the whole movie.

01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:23.500
We were at the Mary Cape cosmetics company in Dallas,

01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:24.500
which is where that shot.

01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:26.500
And somebody, the prop person,

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:29.500
brought in a box of props for a New Year's Eve

01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:31.500
party or something.

01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:33.500
I don't know why they were there, and I said,

01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:35.500
oh, we have to use this crown,

01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:37.500
and we have to do this New Year's Eve party.

01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:38.500
And I wrote it.

01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:39.500
The only time I've ever done this,

01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:41.500
I went into a room in Mary Cape Place,

01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:43.500
and I wrote this thing, and they shot it.

01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:44.500
And that was the scene.

01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:45.500
And that was really...

01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:48.500
The kiss was something that was sort of ad-libbed on the set.

01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:50.500
And so the cops, then, like, yeah,

01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:51.500
I went off on several tangents there,

01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:53.500
but the cops, even though, like,

01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:55.500
the story is just mounting, and it's like,

01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:58.500
we're just not seeing all of Robocop yet.

01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:01.500
And now we're seeing enough of him

01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:03.500
through the eyes of the cops.

01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:05.500
And the cops are both one.

01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:07.500
They can't get enough of seeing him.

01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:09.500
They just want to see him.

01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:11.500
But at the same time, they're absolutely aware,

01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:13.500
and one of them says something like,

01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:14.500
they're going to replace him.

01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:15.500
We're out of a job.

01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:16.500
We're out of a job.

01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:19.500
It's like...

01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:21.500
You feel like if you're developing a movie

01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:23.500
that somebody would have the note of, like,

01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:25.500
do the cops like Robocop or not?

01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:26.500
It's just saying, I'm confused,

01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:28.500
because you got them running,

01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:30.500
and it seems like they're big fans of Robocop.

01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:32.500
But don't they want cops to be not Robocops?

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:33.500
We were really...

01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:36.500
John Davison really kept some of those things away.

01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:38.500
I mean, you know, we had to deal with some notes,

01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:40.500
but we didn't have to deal with too many of them,

01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:42.500
and they kind of really let us, you know,

01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:43.500
bring them the script.

01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:45.500
And I guess each time we brought them one,

01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:46.500
there was never...

01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:47.500
We never had those notes,

01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:49.500
or I don't remember any of those.

01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:52.500
I also remember not taking too many of their notes,

01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:55.500
or just I learned that you could ignore the bad ones.

01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:59.500
Yeah, I mean, they'll call you difficult,

01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:02.500
but if you make $50 million,

01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:04.500
who's gonna remember that?

01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:06.500
So what did you prefer?

01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:08.500
Because it seems like when you look at your filmography,

01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:12.500
you seem more invested in the Starship Trooper franchise.

01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:14.500
That seems like something that kind of...

01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:16.500
No, I mean, they offered me...

01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:20.500
I kept getting paid to write the Starship Trooper stuff.

01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:22.500
And John Davison wanted to do...

01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:24.500
John Davison always wanted to help

01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:26.500
Phil Tippett direct a movie,

01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:28.500
so that was Starship 2,

01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:30.500
and I came along to help him a little bit.

01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:32.500
Are the bugs the good guys?

01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:36.500
Not really.

01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:38.500
I felt like the movie was saying,

01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:39.500
ha, ha.

01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:42.500
The movie says maybe you have been rooting for the Nazis

01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:44.500
in the act in actually...

01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:46.500
Which is not something that when you say,

01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:48.500
you talk about referencing these movies,

01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:51.500
that's not an element of the movies

01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:53.500
that you're referencing.

01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:55.500
Military movies that are selling warbots.

01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:57.500
Well, what do you mean?

01:35:57.500 --> 01:35:59.500
The moral ambiguity of the,

01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:01.500
well, you never know what makes us so different from the Nazis.

01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:03.500
I think that's not an element of those movies.

01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:05.500
Of which movies?

01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:08.500
Of the American propaganda movies,

01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:11.500
but we also looked at all the movies they were making, too.

01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:13.500
I mean, we were just trying to come...

01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:15.500
The Nazi propaganda.

01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:17.500
Would you like to know more?

01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:19.500
Well, there you go.

01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:21.500
Yeah, those sequences are amazing.

01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:23.500
The narrative pieces.

01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:25.500
Did you kind of meticulously write those?

01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:27.500
Are you...

01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:29.500
Those are my favorite things.

01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:31.500
Those are the things that I like.

01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:33.500
I can imagine you agonizing over page by page,

01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:35.500
where it's like...

01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:37.500
Have you ever had a moment when you're doing work

01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:39.500
that turned out to be great?

01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:41.500
Spoilers, I need the answer to be yes.

01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:43.500
Where it's like,

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:45.500
you're not allowed to tell anybody

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:47.500
what you've done in the last six hours

01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:49.500
because the actual technical answer

01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:51.500
is dialogue.

01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:53.500
Well, that's my entire writing life.

01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:55.500
All right, thank you. God damn.

01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:57.500
It takes me forever.

01:36:57.500 --> 01:36:59.500
To answer your question a long time,

01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:01.500
there were five drafts of Robocop.

01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:03.500
If somebody gives me an email,

01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:05.500
I'll send you the production draft.

01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:07.500
I'll send you mine.

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:09.500
LAUGHTER

01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:11.500
We should plug, by the way,

01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:13.500
your Creepshow series is coming out.

01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:15.500
Creepshow.

01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:17.500
Yeah.

01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:19.500
It starts Thursday

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:21.500
on Shutter

01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:23.500
and a first episode

01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:25.500
directed by Greg Nicotero.

01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:27.500
It's based off of

01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:29.500
the Stephen King story, Grey Matter.

01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:31.500
And second one is directed

01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:33.500
by George Harrison, who worked

01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:35.500
on the original Creepshow.

01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:37.500
And

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:39.500
there's two

01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:41.500
installments for episode.

01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:43.500
I'm in the second episode.

01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:45.500
So not this week, Thursday,

01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:47.500
but the following Thursday

01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:49.500
is my episode.

01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:51.500
And I think we have a

01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:53.500
special guest, Ed.

01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:55.500
I didn't know that they were going to

01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:57.500
show up, but...

01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:59.500
Ed Neumeyer.

01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:01.500
LAUGHTER

01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:03.500
You have ten seconds

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:05.500
to comply with my interview

01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:07.500
questions.

01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:09.500
Oh my gosh, this is...

01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:11.500
Oh my gosh, it's the Ed2O9

01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:13.500
Access Hollywood segment.

01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:15.500
Do-do-do-do-do-do.

01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:17.500
This little picture-in-picture

01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:19.500
swooping by of Ed2O9 interviewing

01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:21.500
Tom Cruise and Mickey Rourke.

01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:23.500
So did you two get along on set?

01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:25.500
Uh...

01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:27.500
I will ask the questions.

01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:29.500
Oh, sorry.

01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:31.500
Ed Neumeyer.

01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:33.500
LAUGHTER

01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:35.500
What is your purpose on this premises?

01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:37.500
LAUGHTER

01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:39.500
Sorry, I'm not really teeing you up.

01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:41.500
LAUGHTER

01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:43.500
I'm trying to figure out more

01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:45.500
what would Ed2O9 ask.

01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:47.500
And it's not really setting you up

01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:49.500
for success as a performer.

01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:51.500
LAUGHTER

01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:53.500
That's one of my pet peeves.

01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:55.500
People ask a funny question,

01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:57.500
and then you're supposed to go,

01:38:57.500 --> 01:38:59.500
yes?

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:01.500
LAUGHTER

01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:03.500
I don't like it.

01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:05.500
Hey, guys,

01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:07.500
I'm in the production booth.

01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:09.500
Throw to commercials.

01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:11.500
Right. We'll be right back.

01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:13.500
Okay. Hey, Ed.

01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:15.500
What's going on over there?

01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:17.500
LAUGHTER

01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:19.500
Come on.

01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:21.500
I have been made extremely nervous

01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:23.500
by interviewing my own creator.

01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:25.500
Okay, well...

01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:27.500
I understand that,

01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:29.500
but you have the three-by-five cards in front of you.

01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:31.500
Just read the questions that we went over

01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:33.500
before he came in.

01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.500
So now we're in Blade Runner.

01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:37.500
LAUGHTER

01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:39.500
We'll be right back.

01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:41.500
Yes.

01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:43.500
LAUGHTER

01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:45.500
Ed.

01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:47.500
Newmeyer.

01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:49.500
LAUGHTER

01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:51.500
What are stairs like?

01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:53.500
LAUGHTER

01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:55.500
Okay, yeah, that was the thing.

01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:57.500
They built the perfect robot.

01:39:57.500 --> 01:39:59.500
Motherfucker can't get upstairs.

01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:01.500
But that was absolutely brilliant.

01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:03.500
That, to me, seems a little bit like

01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:05.500
Robert Zemeckis talked about

01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:07.500
the use of not being able to

01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:09.500
write past the point and back to the future

01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:11.500
where he's got to either make out with his mom

01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:13.500
in a car or the movie's over.

01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:15.500
LAUGHTER

01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:17.500
And that there was, like, just years of

01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:19.500
boy, to the extent that the story

01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:21.500
tells itself,

01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:23.500
we are in a box here.

01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:25.500
LAUGHTER

01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:27.500
America doesn't love incest yet.

01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:29.500
Pornhub hasn't come out.

01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:31.500
LAUGHTER

01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:33.500
And then they just came up with the

01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:35.500
best thing, which was

01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:37.500
she kisses him and she says

01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:39.500
it's like kissing my brother.

01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:41.500
You talk about the roar line of Murphy

01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:43.500
and it's just like, unproductive.

01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:45.500
And I think what they're saying is

01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:47.500
thank you for getting us out of that

01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:49.500
Hellraiser incest box.

01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:51.500
That's how I imagine the staircase.

01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:53.500
Good interview again.

01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:55.500
I never thought the staircase gag was going to be

01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:57.500
as funny as it was.

01:40:57.500 --> 01:40:59.500
I thought I hoped it was good enough

01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:01.500
and then Phil Tippett made it work.

01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:03.500
It all starts to get worse because

01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:05.500
it really doesn't occur to you.

01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:07.500
Robocop goes to the skyscraper,

01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:09.500
he walks to the CEO

01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:11.500
of this thing, goes you're under arrest

01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:13.500
and the guy goes ha ha ha, capitalism,

01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:15.500
power, I've got the big guns, I've got

01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:17.500
the money, I've got everything.

01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:19.500
I believe you know Ed 209, Ed 209's got

01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:21.500
rockets, got gatling guns

01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.500
and Robocop can only get away

01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:25.500
from him by going

01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:27.500
downstairs.

01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:29.500
And then you have this comical

01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:31.500
ad moment of Ed 209, like a little

01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:33.500
chicken on its back

01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:35.500
on the stairs. I love the fact that

01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:37.500
Ed 209 knows he can't do stairs

01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:39.500
that he does a little tiptoe.

01:41:39.500 --> 01:41:41.500
He's like

01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:43.500
He's like a dog

01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:45.500
trying to go in the pool.

01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:47.500
The thing that Phil did that was interesting is

01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:49.500
he always thought Phil was a baby, he was a prototype.

01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:51.500
So he always made him

01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:53.500
like a young idea.

01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:55.500
You sort of like him a little bit

01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:57.500
because he's trying so hard.

01:41:57.500 --> 01:41:59.500
He just thought, yeah.

01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:03.500
To the design phase, we got to

01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:05.500
make him stair capable.

01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:07.500
Right?

01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:09.500
It's really true.

01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:11.500
The hubris.

01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:13.500
He's for urban

01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:15.500
pacification.

01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:17.500
I love that.

01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:19.500
Who cares if it didn't work?

01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:21.500
Well, realizing that

01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:23.500
something as simple as stairs

01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:25.500
that we don't associate with humanization

01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:27.500
can actually

01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:29.500
make the difference between us and the system.

01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:31.500
What's the doctor who guys that can't get up the stairs?

01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:33.500
Daleks.

01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:35.500
Daleks can't get up the stairs.

01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:37.500
But also just the rock people, there's the big old

01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:39.500
rock fuckers.

01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:41.500
You're something that's really important to me.

01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:43.500
The return threshold

01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:45.500
which I'm always at.

01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:47.500
This is a really complicated thing to talk

01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:49.500
to people about.

01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:51.500
What is this fucking return threshold?

01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:53.500
You get your ass kicked

01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:55.500
and it's like, I think by far

01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:57.500
is the most often that I

01:42:57.500 --> 01:42:59.500
reference this particular thing in Robocop

01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:01.500
which, however, it seems to have

01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:03.500
so much to do with location

01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:05.500
scouting, choreography.

01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:07.500
It's the fact that Robocop

01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:09.500
after fleeing at 209

01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:11.500
and he goes out front and now

01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:13.500
the floodlights come on him

01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:15.500
and his own brother policemen

01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:17.500
have been assigned to kill him.

01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:19.500
They open fire on him.

01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:21.500
He retreats into the parking garage

01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:23.500
just a way, but it's like

01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:25.500
I don't know if Piric Victory is the right description

01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:27.500
of it, but he

01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:29.500
he's in a parking

01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:31.500
garage laying down and he simply

01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:33.500
rolls

01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:35.500
like

01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:37.500
the other day I'm having lunch with Paul Verhoeven

01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:39.500
and I said, so how do you work with

01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:41.500
Yandaban versus how do you work with Yosef

01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:43.500
Khanna? These are the two cinematographers

01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:45.500
that he worked with. Yandaban, by the way, showed

01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:47.500
that I heard.

01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:49.500
He told me this one was this way

01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:51.500
and this one was that way and he said

01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:53.500
Yost always had really good ideas

01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:55.500
and I remember this and he told me this

01:43:55.500 --> 01:43:57.500
I remember Yosef going, oh wait, over here

01:43:57.500 --> 01:43:59.500
see where all these ramps are going? He can get away

01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:01.500
that way. And no human could?

01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:03.500
I don't know, it just worked out.

01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:05.500
It's things that works in movies. I mean he's surrounded with Kevlar.

01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:07.500
It's his blessing in his curse.

01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:09.500
Paul just said

01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:11.500
it was so lovely he had that idea because

01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:13.500
it got us out of this problem.

01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:15.500
Just think that there's

01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:17.500
no way, sometimes in my worst moments

01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:19.500
I'm rehearsing myself because I'm like

01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:21.500
I imagine you writing that somehow.

01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:23.500
I didn't write that.

01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:25.500
In the script, how did he get out of there?

01:44:25.500 --> 01:44:27.500
I think there was a cut and then a new scene

01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:29.500
and he was running away and there was nobody around.

01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:31.500
Something like that.

01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:33.500
You did like a newspaper

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:35.500
and Robocampus came out.

01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:37.500
It was heroin.

01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:39.500
He had to be saved by Lewis.

01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:41.500
Extreme, extreme.

01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:43.500
Robot man gets away.

01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:45.500
Must have cost him a fortune.

01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:47.500
And says,

01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:49.500
Murphy is me, Lewis.

01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:51.500
We knew that.

01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:53.500
In fact, I once pitched that to Stan Lee.

01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:55.500
Stan Lee liked that so much.

01:44:55.500 --> 01:44:57.500
He said, oh wait, here's the really good part

01:44:57.500 --> 01:44:59.500
where he comes and finds his character.

01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:01.500
What you don't know is that

01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:03.500
this almost was a Marvel comic book.

01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:05.500
And thank God it wasn't because they were going to buy it.

01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:07.500
Stan Lee wanted to buy it

01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:09.500
at a certain point for a comic book.

01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:11.500
Then he asked me if it was

01:45:11.500 --> 01:45:13.500
hadn't I just read Deathlock

01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:15.500
and they don't know it anyway.

01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:17.500
And then they decided, because Marvel wasn't a very successful company,

01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:19.500
then they decided not to do it.

01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:21.500
And it went to Orion.

01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:23.500
Thank God for Stan Lee's lack of success.

01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:25.500
Well, he did okay after that.

01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:27.500
That's so funny.

01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:29.500
I love the baller and I'm going to be a cynic

01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:31.500
and say, I bet Stan Lee

01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:33.500
as a Hail Mary in every meeting

01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:35.500
back then would say,

01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:37.500
never having even seen Deathlock,

01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:39.500
that he would just go,

01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:41.500
are you sure this isn't just Deathlock?

01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:43.500
Because 10% of the time a writer

01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:45.500
would cave and go, yeah, it is.

01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:47.500
I didn't realize how dangerous it was

01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:49.500
to talk to people like that at the time.

01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:51.500
Because they had all these characters,

01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:53.500
but I think Marvel was more a bun.

01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:55.500
There was a secretary

01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:57.500
and one other guy in Stan Lee out here

01:45:57.500 --> 01:45:59.500
and that was it.

01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:01.500
I met him when I was a young executive universal

01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:03.500
and he had nothing better to do

01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:05.500
than go out to have lunch with me.

01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:07.500
Who at the

01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:09.500
Fortune Cookie Place writes

01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:11.500
I don't know,

01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:13.500
but it was right on Robertson.

01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:15.500
It was right there.

01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:17.500
Fortune Cookies were badass though.

01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:19.500
Did you save that Fortune Cookie?

01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:21.500
I don't know.

01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:23.500
I might be somewhere in a box.

01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:25.500
They became advice cookies.

01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:27.500
They became like, you know, sometimes wearing a tie

01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:29.500
can make you feel more confident.

01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:31.500
Did someone start suing Fortune Cookies?

01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:33.500
Because they used to say like,

01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:35.500
a dude's going to murder you with something red.

01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:37.500
They were fun.

01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:39.500
Duck.

01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:41.500
That was the menu, you dummy.

01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:47.500
Biggest cookie I ever saw.

01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:49.500
Couldn't even eat it.

01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:51.500
I get drunk for how to show it.

01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:55.500
I'm never going to get over

01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:57.500
that one of the prime directors was from a Fortune Cookie.

01:46:57.500 --> 01:46:59.500
That's just like the universe

01:46:59.500 --> 01:47:01.500
just helping you make a movie.

01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:03.500
I think there's something worth noting,

01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:05.500
which is your legacy.

01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:07.500
One of your kids

01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:09.500
is this really interesting

01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:11.500
and the description of their work

01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:13.500
is so

01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:15.500
thoroughly modern.

01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:17.500
Shane is a disability rights activist.

01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:19.500
They're a lawyer.

01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:21.500
Disability activist,

01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:23.500
but also a whole

01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:25.500
transgender activist.

01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:31.500
It's as if you had a child

01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:33.500
that became

01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:35.500
a trans

01:47:35.500 --> 01:47:37.500
it's a trans thing, isn't it?

01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:39.500
It's a trans human idea

01:47:39.500 --> 01:47:41.500
in a weird way.

01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:43.500
There is something about that.

01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:45.500
Something future future.

01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:49.500
I imagine that must make you

01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:51.500
proud.

01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:53.500
I don't want to assume

01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:55.500
me.

01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:57.500
I'm frightened of

01:47:57.500 --> 01:47:59.500
what they do these days.

01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:01.500
No, I'm kidding.

01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:03.500
They just won a big settlement

01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:05.500
against a place that

01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:07.500
uses electric shock on kids.

01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:11.500
Are they an autistic activist as well?

01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:13.500
Yeah.

01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:15.500
And also about

01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:17.500
how the mentally ill

01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:19.500
are treated.

01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:21.500
It's not a pretty picture, of course.

01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:23.500
But Shane does

01:48:23.500 --> 01:48:25.500
all that kind of stuff.

01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:27.500
And I do feel like Shane

01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:29.500
in what they're doing

01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:31.500
is saying, I don't want to be

01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:33.500
a human like other humans are.

01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:35.500
I am not a human like other humans are.

01:48:35.500 --> 01:48:37.500
But what I am

01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:39.500
is they are autistic.

01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:41.500
They have facial anomalies.

01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:43.500
They don't look like other people.

01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:45.500
And that is an interesting experience that way

01:48:45.500 --> 01:48:47.500
to be so different

01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:49.500
in the world. I think sometimes

01:48:49.500 --> 01:48:51.500
it's extremely difficult for them.

01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:53.500
But also it gives them a certain kind of

01:48:53.500 --> 01:48:55.500
power and audacity.

01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:57.500
One of my favorite things

01:48:57.500 --> 01:48:59.500
that happens occasionally, Shane will call me up

01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:01.500
and say, well, I went to the airport the other day

01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:03.500
and they talked to me like I was mentally retarded.

01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:05.500
And I always

01:49:05.500 --> 01:49:07.500
kind of laugh when that happens.

01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:09.500
Because I know what's coming next.

01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:11.500
Shane will tell them that they're a lawyer

01:49:11.500 --> 01:49:13.500
and watch out.

01:49:15.500 --> 01:49:17.500
What is their relationship with your work?

01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:21.500
You've got this kid

01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:23.500
and you're going through

01:49:23.500 --> 01:49:25.500
decades of a screenwriting career

01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:27.500
and you're

01:49:27.500 --> 01:49:29.500
celebrated. You're on red carpets.

01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:31.500
There's VHS boxes

01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:33.500
lying at the grocery store.

01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:35.500
I don't know how the ages work out.

01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:37.500
How old Shane was and how old Casey was.

01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:39.500
Shane was born the year the movie came out

01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:41.500
and my son was born

01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:43.500
two years later.

01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:45.500
They grew up with that in the shadow of that.

01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:47.500
I often think

01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:49.500
that it's almost

01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:51.500
hard to see.

01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:53.500
It's just like everywhere around.

01:49:53.500 --> 01:49:55.500
And

01:49:55.500 --> 01:49:57.500
I think it was later

01:49:57.500 --> 01:49:59.500
that they would both in different ways experience something about it.

01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:01.500
I noticed that both of them don't talk about it much.

01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:03.500
Occasionally they'll pull it out

01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:05.500
if it's the right thing to pull out.

01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:07.500
Which I'm really happy that they can get anything out of it at all.

01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:09.500
But mostly it's just like

01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:11.500
I think they had to put up with all the other parts of me.

01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:13.500
Is it weird for you

01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:15.500
when you hear

01:50:15.500 --> 01:50:17.500
Dan and Rob and I

01:50:17.500 --> 01:50:19.500
probably half the people you've met

01:50:19.500 --> 01:50:21.500
since 1987

01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:23.500
talk about the stuff that you've made

01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:25.500
and kind of

01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:27.500
when they talk about what it meant to them

01:50:27.500 --> 01:50:29.500
or what their reaction to it is

01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:31.500
do you ever just feel like

01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:33.500
they're

01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:35.500
you're hearing them say things

01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:37.500
about the movie that you didn't intend

01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:39.500
but like

01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:41.500
I actually don't think it has that much to

01:50:41.500 --> 01:50:43.500
all of that is it's a wonderful thing that happens

01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:45.500
and I kind of like it

01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:47.500
but it doesn't have anything to do with me.

01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:49.500
It's not me, it's the movie

01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:51.500
and the fact that people like it

01:50:51.500 --> 01:50:53.500
and are in any way inspired by it

01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:55.500
is sort of amazing to me

01:50:55.500 --> 01:50:57.500
and it wasn't something I thought

01:50:57.500 --> 01:50:59.500
could ever happen.

01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:01.500
I've heard people say well the reason I went

01:51:01.500 --> 01:51:03.500
to film school sitting literally

01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:05.500
where I was sitting at UCLA is because of this movie

01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:07.500
and that's weird.

01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:09.500
Sometimes I think well I hope that was weird.

01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:11.500
When it was done

01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:13.500
when the script was done went into production

01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:15.500
and they're making the film and you got through the suit

01:51:15.500 --> 01:51:17.500
problems and all the stuff and you were going into

01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:19.500
editing how confident were you

01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:21.500
that this was going to be a success or a failure

01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:23.500
or was it totally up like it?

01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:25.500
I remember the first time we saw the first cut of it

01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:27.500
it was really and I had never seen a first cut

01:51:27.500 --> 01:51:29.500
of anything before and I remember the

01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:31.500
director and I walked out like

01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:33.500
what is that and the sound

01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:35.500
was all wrong and everything was wrong and when

01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:37.500
he walked it sound like he was walking on toilet

01:51:37.500 --> 01:51:39.500
plungers it was just terrible.

01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:41.500
Big shake like that.

01:51:41.500 --> 01:51:43.500
It was like that and then

01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:45.500
all the stuff it was great

01:51:45.500 --> 01:51:47.500
learning process for me and then all the sound came in

01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:49.500
and Steve Flick who did all those

01:51:49.500 --> 01:51:51.500
sounds and did the roar and put the

01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:53.500
lion's roar.

01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:55.500
The footsteps. Could you talk about the footsteps

01:51:55.500 --> 01:51:57.500
or what kind of footsteps?

01:51:57.500 --> 01:51:59.500
That's because Steve Flick is a genius

01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:01.500
and Steve Flick did

01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:03.500
Pulp Fiction and he did Starship and he was

01:52:03.500 --> 01:52:05.500
just the genius sound guy.

01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:07.500
Did he ever say like oh that's a hot dog

01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:09.500
vendor?

01:52:09.500 --> 01:52:11.500
You know Steve was the first guy who was saying

01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:13.500
well there's 100 tracks

01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:15.500
and you know

01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:17.500
so try to figure out what that is.

01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:19.500
Sometimes you get those fun things though

01:52:19.500 --> 01:52:21.500
like the exorcist with the cage

01:52:21.500 --> 01:52:23.500
of bees or someone else.

01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:25.500
There's a lion roar and an ape roar

01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:27.500
in that thing that you're doing with

01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:29.500
Ed 209. That's really a lion

01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:31.500
and an ape and something else.

01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:33.500
I honestly just thought that was the MGM lion.

01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:35.500
No it was an MGM until later.

01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:37.500
That's a good idea we should put that in.

01:52:37.500 --> 01:52:39.500
I'll tell them.

01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:41.500
But anyway to answer your question

01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:43.500
it was like

01:52:43.500 --> 01:52:45.500
I didn't know if it would work. I remember

01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:47.500
hoping it would work.

01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:49.500
And then I saw it and I thought

01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:51.500
I had to see it in front of an audience for the first time

01:52:51.500 --> 01:52:53.500
and people laughed right away and I thought

01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:55.500
oh that's good. And then the second screening

01:52:55.500 --> 01:52:57.500
they laughed in all the same places.

01:52:57.500 --> 01:52:59.500
One of the things that happened in the first screening was

01:52:59.500 --> 01:53:01.500
when Murphy gets killed

01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:03.500
in the first version it was much bloodier

01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:05.500
and there were these shots of the floor

01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:07.500
that were covered with blood.

01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:09.500
Every time that happened

01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:11.500
women would get up and leave the room

01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:13.500
and when we cut the floor out

01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:15.500
and we cut shots to a blood out

01:53:15.500 --> 01:53:17.500
it

01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:19.500
then only one person got it.

01:53:19.500 --> 01:53:21.500
I was tired. It's a traumatic thing

01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:23.500
and I guess that's a tight rub

01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:25.500
because it's your point of immersion

01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:27.500
but I guess if you're overdoing it

01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:29.500
and it feels pornographic then the women are going to go

01:53:29.500 --> 01:53:31.500
you know it seems like you're having fun with this

01:53:31.500 --> 01:53:33.500
as opposed to it seems like maybe you

01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:35.500
understand.

01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:37.500
Now it occurs to me that there's a lot of stuffing

01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:39.500
coming out of

01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:41.500
it's almost like it's a horrible violent killing

01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:43.500
of a teddy bear.

01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:45.500
Well if you look at it it's also a crucifixion

01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:47.500
he plays it that way for a second.

01:53:47.500 --> 01:53:49.500
Well he gets his hands shot off. It's so awful.

01:53:49.500 --> 01:53:51.500
There's even a moment where he's like

01:53:51.500 --> 01:53:53.500
like that and that was one of the things

01:53:53.500 --> 01:53:55.500
so to ask you to answer a question

01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:57.500
earlier Verhoeven coming into it

01:53:57.500 --> 01:53:59.500
Verhoeven reads the second draft

01:53:59.500 --> 01:54:01.500
and reads the title page Robocop

01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:03.500
The Future of Law Enforcement and he goes

01:54:03.500 --> 01:54:05.500
I'm never going to do this and he doesn't read the script

01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:07.500
and so

01:54:07.500 --> 01:54:09.500
Barbara Boyle at Orion Pictures

01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:11.500
sent it to him and said why don't you read it

01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:13.500
maybe you could read it again

01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:15.500
for the subtext so he gave it to his wife

01:54:15.500 --> 01:54:17.500
Martine

01:54:17.500 --> 01:54:19.500
and she read it and she said you know

01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:21.500
I think you should read this I think there's going to be

01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:23.500
something in it that you like

01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:25.500
and he got to the scene with the hand being blown off

01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:27.500
and he says he said

01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:29.500
let's go we're going to go to America we're going to go do this

01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:31.500
so he really said he'd never seen anything like that

01:54:31.500 --> 01:54:33.500
he liked that he responded well to that

01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:35.500
can you say there was a lot of like

01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:37.500
Jesus metaphors

01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:39.500
in there like he's walking on the water

01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:41.500
we always knew we were playing around

01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:43.500
with Jesus and Frankenstein

01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:45.500
depending on which

01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:47.500
and he's very interested in Jesus

01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:49.500
he actually was a Jesus scholar

01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:51.500
for 25 years and he really wanted to do

01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:53.500
the story of Jesus but when we were in Pittsburgh

01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:55.500
and we were in that

01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:57.500
that steel plant

01:54:57.500 --> 01:54:59.500
and he took me over

01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:01.500
to that tank and he said that with these big

01:55:01.500 --> 01:55:03.500
walls and he said that's one of the most beautiful

01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:05.500
things I've ever seen and it's like

01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:07.500
the walls of an ancient city and

01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:09.500
I said well that's great we got to use that

01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:11.500
and so that became the walking on the water

01:55:11.500 --> 01:55:13.500
scene came out of that did Martine and he

01:55:13.500 --> 01:55:15.500
break up before showgirls

01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:17.500
no okay sorry

01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:19.500
no no no

01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:21.500
they're still happily married

01:55:21.500 --> 01:55:23.500
together all these many years later

01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:25.500
alright why

01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:27.500
did you like showgirls

01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:29.500
well you know

01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:31.500
showgirls was the movie he was doing

01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:33.500
when

01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:35.500
we were trying to get him to do it

01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:37.500
when I wanted him to do structure

01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:39.500
talking about the things that make you feel good

01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:41.500
well there's that guy, there's my partner

01:55:41.500 --> 01:55:43.500
there's the other piston of this engine

01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:45.500
but minus me

01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:47.500
yeah there was a moment where Paul was going to be

01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:49.500
no Paul had already done two movies in a row

01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:51.500
that Paul was the biggest director

01:55:51.500 --> 01:55:53.500
in Hollywood for a moment and a half there

01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:55.500
because he'd done total recall

01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:57.500
he's amazing

01:55:57.500 --> 01:55:59.500
he clearly is

01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:01.500
and then he did showgirls

01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:03.500
there was almost a moment where I thought

01:56:03.500 --> 01:56:05.500
he won't do this movie because he can do anything

01:56:05.500 --> 01:56:07.500
and so when showgirls

01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:09.500
crashed and burned a little it was kind of good for me

01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:11.500
and actually

01:56:11.500 --> 01:56:13.500
the sort of neat thing about him was

01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:15.500
I went over to see him like on a Thursday

01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:17.500
the movie was going to come out on a Friday

01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:19.500
and he was so full of himself

01:56:19.500 --> 01:56:21.500
and he was so like yeah maybe we'll do your movie

01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:23.500
I'm not sure

01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:25.500
we'll buy Mars or something like that

01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:27.500
and then it came out

01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:29.500
and it got bad reviews and on

01:56:29.500 --> 01:56:31.500
Sunday

01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:33.500
he came out to my house in Eagle Rock

01:56:33.500 --> 01:56:35.500
and we sat down and we started working on Starship

01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:37.500
and later on I asked him how did you recover

01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:39.500
from that that was such a drubbing

01:56:39.500 --> 01:56:41.500
I mean how do you deal with that because it's hard

01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:43.500
to deal with that stuff and he said I just went to work right away

01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:45.500
right with you

01:56:45.500 --> 01:56:47.500
with me which I take

01:56:47.500 --> 01:56:49.500
it's true

01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:51.500
are you still friends with him today?

01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:53.500
I just had lunch with him on Friday

01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:55.500
let's bring him out

01:56:55.500 --> 01:56:57.500
I told him I was going to do this

01:56:57.500 --> 01:56:59.500
and he's going to listen and now he's never

01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:01.500
well I don't know if he'll listen

01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:03.500
we're ending the show anyway it doesn't matter

01:57:03.500 --> 01:57:05.500
he might hear about it maybe he won't

01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:07.500
alright thanks for coming in that's been our time everybody

01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:09.500
give it up for Ed Neumeyer everybody

01:57:09.500 --> 01:57:11.500

01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:31.500
drive fast and take chances

01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:51.500
before you get beat up

01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:53.500
did you get any of that?

01:57:53.500 --> 01:58:03.500
it's a good show
